<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo; Hello.</p>
<p>Hello. Hello.</p>
<p>Hello. Hello.</p>
<p>Hello. Hello.</p>
<p>Hello. Hello, everyone, my name is Dan</p>
<p>deacon. Thanks for coming here early.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real pleasure to be sharing the stage with some of</p>
<p>my all-time favorites, G-mail and Google Calendar.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to &ndash; I&rsquo;m going to play some songs, and a lot of</p>
<p>the content is going to be made using Fanake and Bard and Music</p>
<p>LM, so I&rsquo;m just going to get started.</p>
<p>This first one is a song of mine called &ldquo;when I was done dying</p>
<p>kwo,&rdquo; and the video was generated</p>
<p>thanks to the lyrics of this song.</p>
<p>Thanks so much. When I was done dying, my</p>
<p>conscience regained So I began my struggle, a</p>
<p>nothingness strained Out a flash made of time, my new</p>
<p>form blasted out And it startled me so and I</p>
<p>burst out a shout My legs ran frantic</p>
<p>like birds from a nest And I ran until drained, leaving</p>
<p>no choice but rest So I fell asleep softly at the</p>
<p>edge of a cave But I should have gone deeper</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not so brave And like that I was torn out and</p>
<p>thrown in the sky And I said all my prayers</p>
<p>because surely I&rsquo;ll die As I crashed down and smashed</p>
<p>into earth, into dirt How my skin did explode, leaving</p>
<p>only my shirt But from shirt grew a tree and</p>
<p>then tree grew a fruit And I became the seed and that</p>
<p>seed was a brute And I clawed through the ground</p>
<p>with my roots and my leaves Tore up the shirt and I</p>
<p>ate up the sleeves And they laughed out at me and</p>
<p>said &ldquo;what is your plan?&rdquo; But their question was foreign,</p>
<p>I could not understand When then suddenly I&rsquo;m ripped up</p>
<p>Placed in a mouth And it swallowed me down at</p>
<p>which time I head south</p>
<p>No need to fear them, no reason to run.</p>
<p>Reached out to touch them faded too soon yet their mouth still</p>
<p>remained standing up towards the moon</p>
<p>And I looked up beyond that beautiful sky, and I</p>
<p>Oh, it greeted me kindly and then we all drank</p>
<p>And we drooled out together right onto the ground</p>
<p>And the ocean grew quickly right up all around</p>
<p>And the earth looked at me and said &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I replied &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I hurt anyone&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without even thinking cast me into space</p>
<p>But before she did that she wiped off my own face</p>
<p>She said better luck next time don&rsquo;t worry so much</p>
<p>Without ears I couldn&rsquo;t hear I could just feel the touch</p>
<p>As I fell asleep softly at the edge of a cave</p>
<p>But I should have gone deeper but I&rsquo;m not so brave</p>

<p>Thank you very much. [Cheers and Applause].</p>

<p>Whew! All right.</p>
<p>Now that all the morsh pits hav subsided, we can return to our</p>
<p>seats. Let&rsquo;s get center, and where we</p>
<p>are in the present, in the now, and I do a lot of shows like</p>
<p>this. Normally, they&rsquo;re at night in</p>
<p>the dark, and unseated rooms, so I thought maybe we could just</p>
<p>all try to do a guided visualization so we can all get</p>
<p>in the same place. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of you traveled</p>
<p>here today. So let&rsquo;s just fully relax our</p>
<p>shoulders, feel our bodies in the seats, our feet on the</p>
<p>floor. I used Bard, and I was like how</p>
<p>can I structure a guided visualization?</p>
<p>For this event. They gave me some suggestions.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s envision now that we&rsquo;re slowly, slowly lifting up from</p>
<p>our seats, floating into the a r air, and let&rsquo;s imagine the air</p>
<p>is not really cold. Let&rsquo;s imagine the air is a</p>
<p>wonderful, wonderful temperature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re floating here above the shoreline afAmpitheater.</p>
<p>We see everyone else below. They&rsquo;re floating up with us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re becoming mist. Vapor.</p>
<p>And there, we see a beautiful, beautiful entity come towards</p>
<p>us. And what is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bird. A bird with lips.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t pay too much attention to the lips, but the bird has lips.</p>
<p>And the bird says to you, hey, I just got a two-bedroom</p>
<p>apartment. I&rsquo;m looking for a roommate.</p>
<p>And you think, wow. I never thought about</p>
<p>relocating, but what neighborhood is it in?</p>
<p>And the bird says, it&rsquo;s in this neighborhood that you&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>wanted to live in. You say that sounds great.</p>
<p>Do you live with anybody else? And you&rsquo;re like, yes, I do love</p>
<p>playing board games. I have friends over.</p>
<p>We play board games. Great.</p>
<p>Maybe my friends can become your friends and we&rsquo;ll start a whole</p>
<p>community. The bird&rsquo;s like, great, the only</p>
<p>thing is it&rsquo;s kind of a small kitchen, so I don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>many kitchen appliances. And you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wonderful. I normally eat out, but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to cook more at home. They&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>We can make meals together. So now that we&rsquo;re all on the</p>
<p>same page, we&rsquo;re recentered here, let&rsquo;s just think of how</p>
<p>wonderful the world would be if there was a bird with flips that</p>
<p>invited us to make meals with them, and we could make</p>
<p>wonderful, wonderful meals together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of what this whole process has felt like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like being a bird and finding a new roommate and</p>
<p>making it work with them. I&rsquo;ll explain more.</p>
<p>As a composer, it&rsquo;s always interested me in that composing</p>
<p>music is an endless and evolving system about finding ways and</p>
<p>communicating ideas about how to make sounds.</p>
<p>Music has always been expanding with ways to share ideas and</p>
<p>about how to make sounds while exploring what sounds are</p>
<p>available to us that can be called music.</p>
<p>Another thing that fascinates me as a composer is that throughght</p>
<p>music&rsquo;s history, advancements in technology have always led to</p>
<p>and coincided with advancements in music thinking.</p>
<p>New tools lead to new instruments, which lead to new</p>
<p>music, which leads to new boundaries to break, which leads</p>
<p>to a restart for new tools. At one point in time, the</p>
<p>trombone was a reflection of cutting-edge musical technology.</p>
<p>And like many technologies, when the first trombones entered the</p>
<p>scene, they were viewed as highly controversial pieces of</p>
<p>music tech. The same could be said for</p>
<p>player pianos, synthesizers, synchronizing sound with film,</p>
<p>home recording studios and midi. I love all these things, and</p>
<p>when I started getting in to making ecomputer music as a</p>
<p>teenage nerd on my family computer, all those tools were</p>
<p>readily established and antiquated, but they were there</p>
<p>for people to make music with, and every since those early case</p>
<p>of days of me playing with the keyboard, I&rsquo;ve been exploring</p>
<p>new ways of making new sounds. So when Google invited me to</p>
<p>come meet with some of their AI researchers and talk about what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been working on, I was pretty ecstatic to be one of the</p>
<p>first people to use these tools and see how they&rsquo;re being shaped</p>
<p>and make new music with them. Last month I was pretty lucky to</p>
<p>spend time with the music researchers.</p>
<p>They showed me the tools that they&rsquo;ve been making and</p>
<p>explained the concepts behind how they worked and allowed me</p>
<p>to experiment with making sounds, music and visuals with</p>
<p>them. It felt a lot like those early</p>
<p>days of sitting in front of a computer is and having no idea</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m doing or taking out a keyboard and hitting buttons</p>
<p>and see what happens. I had no idea what happened, and</p>
<p>that was sort of the fun part, just seeing what it is and</p>
<p>making something new with it. It reminded me a lot of being a</p>
<p>child again. So you hear that drum beat, and</p>
<p>that would start, and the auto cords would start, and the</p>
<p>outputs from AI felt the same way.</p>
<p>They would spark new ideas, they created building blocks to make</p>
<p>new socks. So the music that accompanied</p>
<p>our guided visualization about becoming roommates with a duck</p>
<p>with lips, that was generated using the text prompt and text</p>
<p>to music using sad, moody, new age music, sad piano and</p>
<p>synthesizer. Once we found an output that we</p>
<p>liked, we started experimenting with it and processing it with</p>
<p>sing song to create your variations to accompany the</p>
<p>text-to-music outputs. We fed those results into</p>
<p>themselves countless times, making dozens of iterations to</p>
<p>explore, and the results weree the songs you heard again while</p>
<p>I was rambling on about the birds with lips.</p>
<p>Th It is available.</p>
<p>You can sign up for the wait list now.</p>
<p>We also made a new track that we&rsquo;re about to play using a</p>
<p>single-word prompt. Chip tune.</p>
<p>The name of the band is Chip Tune and our album is Chip Tune</p>
<p>and if you would like to also join the band, you&rsquo;re welcome to</p>
<p>join the band. This is our first show.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all members of the band, so thanks for joining the band.</p>
<p>You can also quit the band at my time, and let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So we put the word chip tune in, and this is the output that</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>we got. [Music playing].</p>
<p>And we realized we needed another section of the song, so</p>
<p>we fit it back into itself. And that gave us this B section.</p>
<p>We knew it needed to be a full song.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t just be these two riffs, but as you know, every</p>
<p>song needs a chorus, so we made the opening part our refrain,</p>
<p>and here we are back at it. And we&rsquo;re like, all right, well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a chip tune song so maybe we should add some sort of</p>
<p>adventure theme, so we were like all right, we know what comes</p>
<p>after this. And what comes after this was a</p>
<p>breakdown because every song needs a breakdown, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like, all right, we&rsquo;re going to be at the Shoreline, people are</p>
<p>going to be nuts in their seats. There&rsquo;s going to be mosh pits</p>
<p>everywhere, so when the breakdown is done, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going to be we did this work, the full-on release.</p>
<p>So this part came as kind of an unexpected little gift.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really know what we would get, and that was the fun</p>
<p>part of this discovery being like what we would put in would</p>
<p>be like finding out a new sound that we didn&rsquo;t even expect to</p>
<p>create. But then, of course, we go back</p>
<p>to our beautiful refrain. Which we fell in love with at</p>
<p>the beginning. &raquo; Thank you very much.</p>
<p>That was our first show. [Applause].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For our band Chip Tune. Some of the other band members</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>are here in the audience, and some of our band members don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist in the physical realm. I&rsquo;ve never been in a band where</p>
<p>the band members aren&rsquo;t physical entities.</p>
<p>So, all right. Now that we&rsquo;ve been basking in</p>
<p>the Chip Tune, let&rsquo;s return to our guided meditation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a long day of Google ahead of us, and now let&rsquo;s place</p>
<p>ourselves in a beautiful woods, where the &ndash; our roommate&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house is. We&rsquo;re wandering through the</p>
<p>woods. We&rsquo;re coming back from a long</p>
<p>day, and we&rsquo;re thinking about all of the G Ggle jokes that we</p>
<p>could make, and you&rsquo;re excited to tell your roommate the joke</p>
<p>that you came up with and you&rsquo;re like, and then they appear, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, hey, duck with lips, doing this event for</p>
<p>Google and I&rsquo;m thinking about using this joke.</p>
<p>The duck&rsquo;s like, what is it? You just get me America rised by</p>
<p>the feathers. You&rsquo;re pulled deeper and deeper</p>
<p>into the realm of pure feathers. The duck says, hey, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>but I finished the another milk. You&rsquo;re like, oh, I was really</p>
<p>looking forward to having that with my cereal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, okay, I&rsquo;ll go out and get more.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like no, I got this joke I want to tell you.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve been making another milk and home, and we</p>
<p>talked specifically about not having so many kitchen</p>
<p>appliances, it&rsquo;s a small kitchen, but I think we can</p>
<p>expand the kitchen and your heart just fills with pure love</p>
<p>of the idea of blowing out the kitchen.</p>
<p>Adding more walls, adding more cabinetry, so you can make</p>
<p>almond milk at home, another milk at home, maybe even build a</p>
<p>little stable, so you could have a million milks, and the bird is</p>
<p>like this is the best roommate relationship I&rsquo;ve ever had,nd</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, this is wonderful, bird with lips, thank you so</p>
<p>much, and then you go back to the house and you&rsquo;re trying so</p>
<p>deeply to remember the joke that you were going to make, and you</p>
<p>remember, in the streets, it&rsquo;s Google Maps, and in the sheets,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Google Sheets, and the duck is like, I think you could have</p>
<p>delivered it earlier. It might have landed a little</p>
<p>better. Why don&rsquo;t we just go relax back</p>
<p>in our home, drift away into the ethernet of tomorrow.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find a way to find that joke in our everyday life, and</p>
<p>you just wish so badly that the duck with lips was real.</p>
<p>So if we could all now just collectively, with all of our</p>
<p>ability, and all of our might, try to manifest a duck with</p>
<p>lips, and if we think hard enough, perhaps we can put this</p>
<p>creature into reality and we can share this utopian life with</p>
<p>this beautiful roommate, the duck with  lips.</p>
<p>So this will be my last song. And then I&rsquo;m going to do like a</p>
<p>five-hour set later, so don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>This song is called &ldquo;change your li</p>
<p>life,&rdquo; and it seemed like a good thing to do right before this</p>
<p>talk where I think all of our lives with going to drastically</p>
<p>changed. And thanks so much.</p>
<p>Again, my name is Dan Deacon. And again, these visuals were</p>
<p>generated using Fanake. Tonight&rsquo;s the night, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna change your life Tonight&rsquo;s the night, you&rsquo;re</p>

<p>[Cheers and Applause]. [Music playing].</p>
<p>Ten. Nine.</p>
<p>Eight. Seven.</p>
<p>Six. Five.</p>
<p>Four. Three.</p>
<p>Two. One.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo; Since day one, we set out to</p>
<p>significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.</p>
<p>And with a little help, you found new answers, discovered</p>
<p>new places. The right words came at just the</p>
<p>right time. And we even learned how to spell</p>
<p>the word epicurean. Life got a little easier.</p>
<p>Our photos got a little better. And we got closer to a world</p>
<p>where we all belong. &raquo; All stations ready to resume</p>
<p>count, 3-2-1&hellip; we have liftoff! &raquo; So as we stand on the cusp of</p>
<p>a new area, new breakthroughs in AI will reimagine the ways we</p>
<p>can help. We will have the chance to</p>
<p>improve the lives of billions of people.</p>
<p>We will give businesses the opportunity to thrive and grow,</p>
<p>and help society answer the toughest questions we have to</p>
<p>face. Now, we don&rsquo;t take this for</p>
<p>granted. So while our ambition is bold,</p>
<p>our approach will always be responsible, because our goal is</p>
<p>to make AI helpful for everyone.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo;SUNDAR: Good morning,</p>
<p>everyone. Welcome to Google I/O.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. It&rsquo;s great to see so many</p>
<p>of you here at Shoreline, so many developers,</p>
<p>and a huge thanks to the millions joining from around the</p>
<p>world, from Bangladesh to Brazil to our new Bay View Campus right</p>
<p>next door. It&rsquo;s so great to have you, as</p>
<p>always. As you may have heard, AI is</p>
<p>having a very busy year, so we&rsquo;ve got lots to talk about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started. Seven years into our journey, as</p>
<p>an AI-first company, we are at an exciting inflection point.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to make AI even more helpful for people,</p>
<p>for businesses, for communities, for everyone.</p>
<p>We have been applying AI to make our products radically more</p>
<p>helpful for a while. With generative AI, we&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>the next step. With a bold and responsible</p>
<p>approach, we&rsquo;re reimagining all our core products, including</p>
<p>Search. You will hear more later in the</p>
<p>keynote. Let me start with a few examples</p>
<p>of how generative AI is helping to evolve our products, starting</p>
<p>with G-mail. In 2017, we launched Smart</p>
<p>Reply, short responses you could select with just one click.</p>
<p>Next came Smart Compose, which offered writing suggestions as</p>
<p>you type. Smart Compose led to more</p>
<p>advanced writing features powered by AI.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been used in WorkSpace over 180 billion times in the</p>
<p>past year alone. And now, with a much more</p>
<p>powerful generative model, we are taking the next step in</p>
<p>G-mail with &ldquo;Help me write.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s say you got this E-mail</p>
<p>that your flight was cancelled. The airline has sent you a</p>
<p>voucher, but what you really want is a full refund.</p>
<p>You could reply and use Help Me Write.</p>
<p>Just type in the prompt of what you want, and E-mail to ask for</p>
<p>a full refund, hit create, and a full draft appears.</p>
<p>As you can see, it conveniently pulled in flight details from</p>
<p>the previous E-mail. And it looks pretty close to</p>
<p>what you want to send. Maybe you want to refine it</p>
<p>further. In this case, a more elaborate</p>
<p>E-mail might increase the chances of getting the refund.</p>
<p>[Laughter]. [Applause].</p>
<p>And there you go. I think it&rsquo;s ready to send!</p>
<p>Help me write will start rolling out as part of our WorkSpace</p>
<p>updates. And just like with Smart</p>
<p>Compose, you will see it get better over time.</p>
<p>The next example is Maps. Since the early days of Street</p>
<p>View, AI has stitched together billions of panoramic images so</p>
<p>people can explore the world from their device.</p>
<p>At last year&rsquo;s I/O, we introduced Immersive View, which</p>
<p>uses AI to create a high fidelity representation of a</p>
<p>place so you can experience it before you visit.</p>
<p>Now we are expanding that same technology to do what Maps does</p>
<p>best:  Help you get where you want to go.</p>
<p>Google Maps provides 20 billion kilometers of directions every</p>
<p>day. That&rsquo;s a lot of trips.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could see your whole trip in advance.</p>
<p>With Immersive View for routes, now you can, whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>walking, cycling or driving. Let me show you what I mean.</p>
<p>Say I&rsquo;m in New York City and I want to go on a bike ride.</p>
<p>Maps has given me a couple of options close to where I am.</p>
<p>I like the one on the waterfront, so let&rsquo;s go with</p>
<p>that. Looks scenic.</p>
<p>And I want to get a feel for it first.</p>
<p>Click on immersive view for routes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an entirely new way to look at my journey.</p>
<p>I can zoom in to get an incredible bird&rsquo;s eye view of</p>
<p>the ride. And as we turn, we get on to a</p>
<p>great bike path. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s going to be a beautiful ride.</p>
<p>You can also check today&rsquo;s air quality.</p>
<p>Looks really AQI is 43. Pretty good.</p>
<p>And if I want to check traffic and weather and see how they</p>
<p>might change over the next few hours, I can do that.</p>
<p>Looks like it&rsquo;s going to pour later, so maybe I want to get</p>
<p>going now. Immersive View for routes will</p>
<p>begin to roll out over the summer and launch in 15 cities</p>
<p>by the end of the year, including London, New York,</p>
<p>Tokyo and San Francisco. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>Another product made better by AI is Google Photos.</p>
<p>We introduced it at I/O in 2015, and it was one of our first AI</p>
<p>native products. Breakthroughs in machine</p>
<p>learning made it possible to search your photos for things</p>
<p>like people, sunsets or waterfalls.</p>
<p>Of course, we want you to do more than just search photos.</p>
<p>We also want to help you make them better.</p>
<p>In fact, every month, 1.7 billion images are edited in</p>
<p>Google photos. AI advancements give us more</p>
<p>powerful ways to do this. For example, Magic Eraser,</p>
<p>launched first on Pixel, uses AI-powered computational</p>
<p>photography to remove unwanted distractions.</p>
<p>And later this year, using a combination of semantic</p>
<p>understanding and generative AI, you can do much more with the</p>
<p>new experience called Magic Editor.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look. Say you&rsquo;re on a hike and stop to</p>
<p>take a photo in front of a waterfall.</p>
<p>You wish you had taken your bag off for the photo, so let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>ahead and remove that bag strap. The photo feels a bit dark, so</p>
<p>you can improve the lighting. And maybe you want to even get</p>
<p>rid of some clouds to make it feel as sunny as you remember</p>
<p>it. [Laughter].</p>
<p>Looking even closer, you wish you had posed so it looks like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really catching the water in your hand.</p>
<p>No problem. You can adjust that.</p>
<p>[Laughter]. [Applause].</p>
<p>There you go. Let&rsquo;s look at one more photo.</p>
<p>This is a great photo, but as a parent, you always want your kid</p>
<p>at the center of it all. And it looks like the balloons</p>
<p>got cut off in this one. So you can go ahead and</p>
<p>reposition the birthday boy. Magic Editor automatically</p>
<p>re-creates parts of the bench and balloons that were not</p>
<p>captured in the original shot. And as a finishing touch, you</p>
<p>can punch up the sky. This also changes the lighting</p>
<p>in the rest of the photo so the edit feels consistent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly magical. We are excited to roll out Magic</p>
<p>Editor in Google Photos later this year.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. From G-mail and Photos to Maps,</p>
<p>these are just a few examples of how AI can help you in moments</p>
<p>that matter. And there is so much more we can</p>
<p>do to deliver the full potential of AI across the products you</p>
<p>know and love. Today, we have 15 products that</p>
<p>each serve more than half a billion people and businesses,</p>
<p>and six of those products serve over two billion users each.</p>
<p>This gives us so many opportunities to deliver on our</p>
<p>mission, to organize the world&rsquo;s information and make it</p>
<p>universally accessible and useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a timeless mission that feels more relevant with each</p>
<p>passing year. And looking ahead, making AI</p>
<p>helpful for everyone, is the most profound way we will</p>
<p>advance our mission. And we are doing this in four</p>
<p>important ways. First, by improving your</p>
<p>knowledge and learning, and deepening your understanding of</p>
<p>the world. Second, by boosting creativity</p>
<p>and productivity so you can express yourself and get things</p>
<p>done. Third, by enabling developers</p>
<p>and businesses to build their own transformative products and</p>
<p>services. And finally, by building and</p>
<p>deploying AI responsibly so that everyone can benefit equally.</p>
<p>We are so excited by the opportunities ahead.</p>
<p>Our ability to make AI helpful for everyone relies on</p>
<p>continuously advancing our foundation models.</p>
<p>So I want to take a moment to share how we are approaching</p>
<p>them. Last year, you heard us talk</p>
<p>about PaLM, which led to many improvements across our</p>
<p>products. Today, we are ready to announce</p>
<p>our latest PaLM model in production, PaLM 2.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. PaLM 2 builds on our fundamental</p>
<p>research and our latest infrastructure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s highly capable at a wide range of tasks, and easy to</p>
<p>deploy. We are announcing over 25</p>
<p>products and features powered by PaLM 2 today.</p>
<p>PaLM 2 models deliver excellent foundational capabilities across</p>
<p>a wide range of sizes. We have affectionately named</p>
<p>them Gecko, Otter, Bison and Unicorn.</p>
<p>Gecko is so light-weight that it can work on mobile devices, fast</p>
<p>enough for great interactive applications on device, even</p>
<p>when offline. PaLM 2 models are stronger in</p>
<p>logic and reasoning, thanks to broad training on scientific and</p>
<p>mathematical topics. It&rsquo;s also trained on</p>
<p>multi-lingual texts, spanning over 100 languages so it</p>
<p>understands and generates nuanced results.</p>
<p>Combined with powerful coding capabilities, PaLM 2 can also</p>
<p>help developers collaborating around the world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this example. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re working with a</p>
<p>colleague in Seoul and you&rsquo;re debugging code.</p>
<p>You can ask it to fix a bug and help out your teammate by adding</p>
<p>comments in Korean to the code. It first recognizes the code is</p>
<p>recursive, suggests a fix and even explains the reasoning</p>
<p>behind the fix. And as you can see, it added</p>
<p>comments in Korean, just like you asked.</p>
<p>[Applause]. While PaLM 2 is highly capable,</p>
<p>it really shines when fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge.</p>
<p>We recently released Sec-PaLM, a version of PaLM 2, fine-tuned</p>
<p>for security use cases. It uses AI to better detect</p>
<p>malicious scripts and can help security experts understand and</p>
<p>resolve threats. Another example is Med-PaLM 2.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s fine-tuned on medical knowledge.</p>
<p>This fine-tuning achieved a 9x reduction in inaccurate</p>
<p>reasoning when compared to the model, approaching the</p>
<p>performance of clinician experts who answered the same set of</p>
<p>questions. In fact, Med-PaLM 2 was the</p>
<p>first language model to perform at &ldquo;expert level&rdquo; on medical</p>
<p>licensing exam-style questions, and is currently the</p>
<p>state-of-the-art. We are also working to add</p>
<p>capabilities to Med-PaLM 2 so that it can synthesize</p>
<p>information from medical imaging like plain films and mammograms.</p>
<p>You can imagine an AI collaborator that helps</p>
<p>radiologists, interpret images and communicate the results.</p>
<p>These are some examples of PaLM 2 being used in specialized</p>
<p>domains. We can&rsquo;t wait to see it used in</p>
<p>more. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m pleased</p>
<p>announce that it is now available in preview.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll let Thomas share more. [Applause].</p>
<p>PaLM 2 is the latest step in our decade-long journey to bring AI</p>
<p>in responsible ways to billions of people.</p>
<p>It builds on progress made by two world-class teams, the Brain</p>
<p>Team and DeepMind. Looking back at the defining AI</p>
<p>breakthroughs over the last decade, these teams have</p>
<p>contributed to a significant number of them.</p>
<p>AlphaGo, Transformers, sequence-to-sequence models, and</p>
<p>so on. All this helped set the stage</p>
<p>for the inflection point we are at today.</p>
<p>We recently brought these two teams together in to a single</p>
<p>unit, Google DeepMind. Using the computational</p>
<p>resources of Google, they are focused on building more capable</p>
<p>systems safely and responsibly. This includes our next</p>
<p>generation foundation model, Gemini, which is still in</p>
<p>training. Gemini was created from the</p>
<p>ground up to be multi-modal, highly efficient at tool and API</p>
<p>integrations, and built to enable future innovations like</p>
<p>memory and planning. While still early, we&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>seeing impressive multi-modal capabilities not seen in prior</p>
<p>models. Once fine-tuned and rigorously</p>
<p>tested for safety, Gemini will be available at various sizes</p>
<p>and capabilities just like PaLM 2.</p>
<p>As we invest in more advanced models, we are also deeply</p>
<p>investing in AI responsibility. This includes having the tools</p>
<p>to identify synthetically generated content whenever you</p>
<p>encounter it. Two important approaches are</p>
<p>watermarking and metadata. Watermarking embeds information</p>
<p>directly into content in ways that are maintained even through</p>
<p>modest image editing. Moving forward, we are building</p>
<p>our models to include watermarking and other</p>
<p>techniques from the start. So if you look at this synthetic</p>
<p>image, it&rsquo;s impressive how real it looks, so you can imagine how</p>
<p>important this is going to be in the future.</p>
<p>Metadata allows content creators to associate additional context</p>
<p>with original files, giving you more information whenever you</p>
<p>encounter an image. We&rsquo;ll ensure every one of our</p>
<p>AI-generated images has that metadata.</p>
<p>James will talk about our responsible approach to AI</p>
<p>later. As models get better and more</p>
<p>capable, one of the most exciting opportunities is making</p>
<p>them available for people to engage with directly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opportunity we have with Bard, our experiment for</p>
<p>conversational AI. We are rapidly evolving Bard.</p>
<p>It now supports a wide range of programming capabilities, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotten much smarter at reasoning and math prompts.</p>
<p>And as of today, it is now fully running on PaLM 2.</p>
<p>To share more about what&rsquo;s coming, let me turn it over to</p>
<p>Sissie. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sissie Hsiao: Thanks, Sundar. Large language models have</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>captured the world&rsquo;s imagination, changing how we</p>
<p>think about the future of computing.</p>
<p>We launched Bard as a limited access experiment on a</p>
<p>lightweight large language model to get feedback and iterate.</p>
<p>Since then, the team has been working hard to make rapid</p>
<p>improvements,and launch them quickly.</p>
<p>With PaLM 2 Bard&rsquo;s math, logic and reasoning skills made a huge</p>
<p>leap forward, underpinning its ability to help developers with</p>
<p>programming. Bard can now collaborate on</p>
<p>tasks like code generation, debugging and explaining code</p>
<p>snippets. Bard has already learned more</p>
<p>than 20 programming languages, including C++, Go, JavaScript,</p>
<p>Python, Kotlin, and even Google Sheets functions.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re thrilled to see that coding has quickly become one of</p>
<p>the most popular things people are doing with Bard.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at an example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been learning chess, and, for fun, I thought</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d see if I can program a move in Python.</p>
<p>How would I use Python to generate the &ldquo;Scholar&rsquo;s Mate&rdquo;</p>
<p>move in chess? Okay.</p>
<p>Here, Bard created a script to re-create this chess move in</p>
<p>Python. And notice how it also formatted</p>
<p>the code nicely, making it easy to read.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve alsosoeard great feedback from developers about how Bard</p>
<p>provides code e tations. And starting next week, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>notice something right here. We&rsquo;re making code citations even</p>
<p>more precise. If Bard brings in a block of</p>
<p>code, just click this annotation and Bard will underline the</p>
<p>block and link to the source. Now, Bard can also help me</p>
<p>understand the code. Could you tell me what</p>
<p>&lsquo;chess.Board()&rsquo; does in this code?</p>
<p>Now, this is a super helpful explanation of what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>and makes things more clear. All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can make this code a little better.</p>
<p>How would I improve this code? Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, there&rsquo;s a list comprehension, creating a</p>
<p>function, and using a generator. Those are great suggestions!</p>
<p>Now, could you join them in to one single Python code block?</p>
<p>Okay. Bard is rebuilding the code with</p>
<p>these improvements. Okay.</p>
<p>Great. How easy was that?</p>
<p>And in a couple clicks, I can move this directly into Colab.</p>
<p>Developers love the ability to bring code from Bard into their</p>
<p>workflow, like Colab, so coming soon, we&rsquo;re adding the</p>
<p>ability to export and run code with our partner Replit,</p>
<p>starting with Python. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also heard that you want Dark theme, so starting today,</p>
<p>you can activate it &ndash; [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>You can activate it right in Bard or let it follow your OS</p>
<p>settings. Speaking of exporting things,</p>
<p>people often ask Bard for a head start drafting E-mails and</p>
<p>documents. So today we&rsquo;re launching two</p>
<p>more Export Actions, making it easy to move Bard&rsquo;s responses</p>
<p>right in to G-mail and Docs. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re excited by how quickly Bard and the underlying models</p>
<p>are improving, but we&rsquo;re not stopping there.</p>
<p>We want to bring more capabilities to Bard to fuel</p>
<p>your curiosity and imagination. And so, I&rsquo;m excited to announce</p>
<p>that tools are coming to Bard. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>As you collaborate with Bard, you&rsquo;ll be able to tap into</p>
<p>services from Google and extensions with partners to let</p>
<p>you do things never before possible.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;ll approach this responsibly, in a secure</p>
<p>and private way, letting you always stay in control.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting with some of the Google apps that people love and</p>
<p>use every day. It&rsquo;s incredible what Bard can</p>
<p>already do with text, but images are such a fundamental part of</p>
<p>how we learn and express. So in the next few weeks, Bard</p>
<p>will become more visual, both in its responses, and your prompts.</p>
<p>So if you ask, What are some must-see sights in New Orleans?</p>
<p>Bard&rsquo;s going to use Google Search and the Knowledge Graph</p>
<p>to find the most relevant images.</p>
<p>Okay. Here we go.</p>
<p>Hmmm, the French Quarter, the Garden District.</p>
<p>These images really give me a much better sense of what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>exploring. We&rsquo;ll also make it easy for you</p>
<p>to prompt Bard with images, giving you even more ways to</p>
<p>explore and create. People love Google Lens, and in</p>
<p>coming months, we&rsquo;re bringing the powers of Lens to Bard.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. So if you&rsquo;re looking to have</p>
<p>some fun with your fur babies, you might upload an image and</p>
<p>ask Bard to &ldquo;Write a funny caption about these two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lens detects this is a photo of a goofy German Shepherd and a</p>
<p>Golden Retriever. And then Bard uses that to</p>
<p>create some funny captions. If you ask me, I think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>both good boys. Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do another one. Imagine I&rsquo;m 18 and I need to</p>
<p>apply to college. I won&rsquo;t date myself with how</p>
<p>long it&rsquo;s been, but it&rsquo;s still an overwhelming process.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m thinking about colleges, but I&rsquo;m not sure what I want to</p>
<p>focus on. I&rsquo;m into video games.</p>
<p>And what kinds of programs might be interesting?</p>
<p>Okay. This is a really helpful head</p>
<p>start. Hmmm, animation looks pretty</p>
<p>interesting. Now I could ask, help me find</p>
<p>colleges with animation programs in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Okay. Great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good list of schools. Now, to see where these are, I</p>
<p>might now say, show these on a map.</p>
<p>Here, Bard&rsquo;s using Google Maps to visualize where these schools</p>
<p>are. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>This is super helpful, and exciting to see that plenty of</p>
<p>options are not too far from home.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s start organizing things a bit.</p>
<p>Show these options as a table. Nice.</p>
<p>Structured and organized. But there&rsquo;s more I want to know.</p>
<p>Add a column showing whether they are public or private</p>
<p>schools. [Applause]e]</p>
<p>Perfect. This is a great start to build</p>
<p>on. And now, let&rsquo;s move this to</p>
<p>Google Sheets so my family can jump in later to help me with my</p>
<p>search. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>You can see how easy it will be to get a jump start in Bard and</p>
<p>quickly have something useful to move over to apps like Docs or</p>
<p>Sheets to build on with others. Okay.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a taste of what&rsquo;s possible when Bard meets some of</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s apps, but that&rsquo;s just the start.</p>
<p>Bard will be able to tap into all kinds of services from</p>
<p>across the Web, with extensions from incredible partners like</p>
<p>Instacart, Indeed, Khan Academy and many more.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at one coming in the next couple months.</p>
<p>With Adobe Firefly, you&rsquo;ll be able to generate completely new</p>
<p>images from your imagination, right in Bard.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m planning a birthday party for my</p>
<p>seven-year-old who loves unicorns.</p>
<p>I want a fun image to send out with the invitations.</p>
<p>Make an image of a unicorn and a cake at a kid&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>Okay. Now Bard is working with Firefly</p>
<p>to bring what I imagined to life.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. How amazing is that?</p>
<p>This will unlock all kinds of ways that you can take your</p>
<p>creativity further and faster. And we are so excited for this</p>
<p>partnership. Bard continues to rapidly</p>
<p>improve and learn new abilities, and we want to let people around</p>
<p>the world try it out and share their feedback.</p>
<p>And so today, we are removing the wait list and opening up</p>
<p>Bard to over 180 countries and territ</p>
<p>territories. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>With more coming soon. Bard is also becoming available</p>
<p>in more languages. Beyond English, starting today,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to talk to Bard in Japanese and Korean.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. Adding languages responsibly</p>
<p>involves deep work to get things like quality and local nuances</p>
<p>right, and we&rsquo;re pleased to share that we&rsquo;re on track to</p>
<p>support 40 languages soon! It&rsquo;s amazing to see the rate of</p>
<p>progress so far. More advanced models, so many</p>
<p>new capabilities, and the ability for even more people to</p>
<p>collaborate with Bard. And when we&rsquo;re ready to move</p>
<p>Bard to our Gemini model, I&rsquo;m really excited about more</p>
<p>advancements to come. So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going with</p>
<p>Bard, connecting tools from Google and amazing services</p>
<p>across the Web, to help you do and create anything you can</p>
<p>imagine. Through a fluid collaboration</p>
<p>with our most cacable large language models.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much to share in the days ahead.</p>
<p>And now, to hear more about how large language models are</p>
<p>enabling next generation productivity features right in</p>
<p>wo WorkSpace, I&rsquo;ll hand it over to</p>
<p>Aparna. [Cheererand Applause].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>APARNA PAPPU: From the very beginning, Workspace was built</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>to allow you to collaborate in realtime with other people.</p>
<p>Now you can collaborate in real time with AI.</p>
<p>AI can act as a coach, a thought partner, source of inspiration,</p>
<p>as well as a productivity booster across all of the apps</p>
<p>of Workspace. Our first steps with AI as a</p>
<p>collaborator were via the help me write feature in G-mail and</p>
<p>Docs, which launched to trusted testers in March.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been truly blown away by the clever and creative ways</p>
<p>these features are being used, from writing essays, sales</p>
<p>pitches, project plans, client outreach, and so much more.</p>
<p>Since then, we&rsquo;ve been busy expanding these helpful features</p>
<p>across more surfaces. Let me show you a few examples.</p>
<p>One of our most popular use cases is the trusty job</p>
<p>description. Every business, big or small,</p>
<p>needs to hire people. A good job description can make</p>
<p>all the difference. Here&rsquo;s how Docs has been</p>
<p>helping. Say you run a fashion boutique</p>
<p>and need to hire a textile designer.</p>
<p>To get started, you enter just a few words as a prompt, &ldquo;Senior</p>
<p>level job description for textile designer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Docs will take that prompt and send it to our PaLM 2 based</p>
<p>model. And let&rsquo;s see what I get back.</p>
<p>Nod bad. With just seven words, the model</p>
<p>came back with a good starting point, written out really</p>
<p>nicely. Now, you can take that and</p>
<p>customize it for the kind of experience, education and skill</p>
<p>set that this role needs, saving you a ton of time and effort.</p>
<p>[Applause]. Next, let me show you how you</p>
<p>can get more organized with Sheets.</p>
<p>Imagine you run a dog-walking business and need to keep track</p>
<p>of things like your clients, logistics about the dogs, like</p>
<p>what time they need to be walked, for how long, et cetera.</p>
<p>Sheets can help you get organized.</p>
<p>In a new Sheet, simply type something like,&ldquo;Client and pet</p>
<p>roroer for a dog-walking business with rates,&rdquo; and hit</p>
<p>Create. Sheets sends this input to a</p>
<p>fine-tuned model that we&rsquo;ve been training with all sorts of</p>
<p>Sheets-specific use cases. Look at that!</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. The model figured out what you</p>
<p>might need. The again rated table has things</p>
<p>like the dog&rsquo;s name, client info, notes, et cetera.</p>
<p>This is a good start for you to tinker with.</p>
<p>Sheets made it easy for you to get started, so you can get back</p>
<p>to doing what you love. Speaking of getting back to</p>
<p>things you love, let&rsquo;s talk about Google Slides.</p>
<p>People use Slides for storytelling all the time,</p>
<p>whether at work or in their personal lives.</p>
<p>For example, you get your extended family to collect</p>
<p>anecdotes/haikus/jokes for your parents&rsquo; 50th wedding</p>
<p>anniversary in a slide deck. Everyone does their bit, but</p>
<p>maybe this deck could have more pizzazz.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pick one of the slides and use the poem on there as a</p>
<p>prompt for image generation. &ldquo;Mom loves her pizza cheesy and</p>
<p>true, while Dad&rsquo;s favorite treat is a warm pot of fondue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hit create and see what it comes up with.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, that quote is sent as input to our</p>
<p>text-2-image models. And we know it&rsquo;s unlikely that</p>
<p>the user will be happy with just one option so we generate six to</p>
<p>eight images so that you have the ability to choose and</p>
<p>refine. Whoa!</p>
<p>I have some oddly delicious-looking fondue pizza</p>
<p>images! Now, the style is a little too</p>
<p>cartoony for me. So I&rsquo;m going to ask it to try</p>
<p>again. Let&rsquo;s change the style to</p>
<p>&ldquo;photography.&rdquo; And give it a whirl.</p>
<p>Just as weird, but it works for me.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. You can have endless fun with</p>
<p>this, with no limits on cheesiness or creativity.</p>
<p>Starting next month, trusted testers will be able to try this</p>
<p>and six more generative AI features across Workspace.</p>
<p>And later this year, all of this will be generally available to</p>
<p>business and consumer Workspace users via a new service called</p>
<p>Duet AI for Workspace. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>Stepping back a bit, I showed you a few powerful examples of</p>
<p>how Workspace can help you get more done with just a few words</p>
<p>as prompts. Prompts are a powerful way of</p>
<p>collaborating with AI. The right prompt can unlock far</p>
<p>more from these models. However, it can be daunting for</p>
<p>many of us to even know where to start.</p>
<p>Well, what if we could solve that for you?</p>
<p>What if AI could proactively offer you prompts?</p>
<p>Even better, what if these prompts were actually contextual</p>
<p>and changed based on what you are working on?</p>
<p>I am super excited to show you a preview of just that.</p>
<p>This is how we see the future of collaboration with AI coming to</p>
<p>life. Let&rsquo;s switch to a live demo so I</p>
<p>can show you what I mean. Tony&rsquo;s here to help with that.</p>
<p>Hey, Tony. &raquo; TONY: Hey, Aparna.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo;APARNA PAPPU: My niece, Meera,</p>
<p>and I are working on a spooky story</p>
<p>together for summer camp. We&rsquo;ve already written a few</p>
<p>paragraphs, but now we&rsquo;re stuck. Let&rsquo;s get some help.</p>
<p>As you can see, we launched a side panel, something the team</p>
<p>fondly calls Sidekick. Sidekick instantly reads and</p>
<p>processes the document, and offers some really neat</p>
<p>suggestions, along with an open-prompt dialogue.</p>
<p>If we look closely, we can see some of the suggestions, like,</p>
<p>what happened to the golden seashell?</p>
<p>What are common mystery plot twists?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try the seashell option and see what it comes back with.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening behind the scenes is that we&rsquo;ve provided</p>
<p>the document as context to the model, along with the suggested</p>
<p>prompt. Let&rsquo;s see what we got.</p>
<p>The golden seashell was eaten by a giant squid that lives in the</p>
<p>cove? This is a good start.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s insert these ideas as notes so we can continue our</p>
<p>little project. Now, one of the interesting</p>
<p>observations we have is that it&rsquo;s actually easier to react to</p>
<p>something or perhaps use that that to say, hmmm, I want to go</p>
<p>in a different direction. And this is exactly what AI can</p>
<p>help with. I see a new suggestion for</p>
<p>generating images. Let&rsquo;s see what this does.</p>
<p>This story has a village, a golden seashell and some other</p>
<p>details. Instead of having to type all</p>
<p>that out, the model picks up these details from the document</p>
<p>and generates images. These are some cool pictures,</p>
<p>and I bet my niece will love these.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s insert them into the doc for fun.</p>
<p>Thank you, Tony! [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to walk you through some more examples, and this</p>
<p>will help you see how this powerful new contextual</p>
<p>collaboration is such a remarkable boost to productivity</p>
<p>and creativity. Say you are writing to your</p>
<p>neighbors about an upcoming potluck.</p>
<p>Now, as you can see, Sidekick has summarized what this</p>
<p>conversation is about. Last year, everyone brought</p>
<p>hummus. Who doesn&rsquo;t love hummus!</p>
<p>But this year, you want a little more variety.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what people signed up to bring.</p>
<p>Now, somewhere in this thread is a Google sheet, where you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>collected that information. You can get some help by typing,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write a note about the main dishes people are bringing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s see what we get back. Awesome!</p>
<p>It found the right sheet and cited the source, in the &ldquo;Found</p>
<p>in&rdquo; section, giving you confidence that this is not made</p>
<p>up. Looks good.</p>
<p>You can insert it directly into your E-mail.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s end with an example of how this can help you at work.</p>
<p>Say you are about to give an important presentation, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been so focused on the content that you forgot to</p>
<p>prepare speaker notes. The presentation is in an hour.</p>
<p>Uh-oh. No need to panic.</p>
<p>Look at what one of the suggestions is:  Create speaker</p>
<p>notes for each slide. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what happens. What happened behind the scenes</p>
<p>here is that the presentation and other</p>
<p>relevant context is sent to the model to help create</p>
<p>these notes. Once you&rsquo;ve reviewed them, you</p>
<p>can hit insert and edit the notes to convey what you</p>
<p>intended. So you can now deliver the</p>
<p>presentation without worrying about the notes.</p>
<p>As you can see, we&rsquo;ve been having a ton of fun playing with</p>
<p>this. We can see the true potential of</p>
<p>AI as a collaborator, and will be bringing this experience to</p>
<p>Duet AI for Workspace. With that, I&rsquo;ll hand it back to</p>
<p>Sundar. [Cheers and Applause].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SUNDAR: Thanks, Aparna. It&rsquo;s exciting to see all the</p>

<p>innovation coming to Google WorkSpace.</p>
<p>As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on</p>
<p>giving helpful features to our users.</p>
<p>And starting today, we are giving you a new way to preview</p>
<p>some of the experiences across WorkSpace and other products.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Labs. I say new, but Google has a long</p>
<p>history of bringing labs, and, you know, we&rsquo;ve made it</p>
<p>available throughout our history as well.</p>
<p>You can check it out at Google.com/labs.</p>
<p>Next up, we&rsquo;re going to talk about Search.</p>
<p>Search has been our founding product from our earliest days.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve always approached it placing user trust about</p>
<p>everything else. To give you a sense of how we</p>
<p>bringing generating AI on to search, I&rsquo;m going to invite</p>
<p>Cathy on to stage. Cathy.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo;CATHY EDWARDS: Thanks, Sundar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on Search for many years, and what inspires me</p>
<p>So much is how it continues to be an unsolved problem, and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m just so excited by the potential of bringing</p>
<p>generative AI in to Search. Let&rsquo;s give it a whirl.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with a search for what&rsquo;s better for a family with</p>
<p>kids under three and a dog, Bryce Canyon or Arches.</p>
<p>Now, although this is the question you have, you probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t ask it in this way today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d break it down into smaller ones, sift through information,</p>
<p>and then piece things together yourself.</p>
<p>Now, Search does the heavy lifting for you.</p>
<p>What you see here looks pretty different, so let me first give</p>
<p>you a quick tour. You&rsquo;ll notice a new integrated</p>
<p>search results page so you can get even more out of a single</p>
<p>search. There&rsquo;s an AI-powered snapshot</p>
<p>that quickly gives you the lay of the land on a topic.</p>
<p>And so here you can see that while both parks are</p>
<p>kid-friendly, only Bryce Canyon has more options for your furry</p>
<p>friend. If you want to dig deeper, there</p>
<p>are links included in the snapshot.</p>
<p>You can also click to expand your view.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see how information is corroborated, so you can</p>
<p>check out more details and real the topic.</p>
<p>This new experience builds on Google&rsquo;s ranking and safety</p>
<p>systems that we&rsquo;ve been fine-tuning for decades.</p>
<p>Search will continue to be your jumping-off point to what makes</p>
<p>the Web so special, its diverse range of content, from</p>
<p>publishers to creators, businesses, and even people like</p>
<p>you and me. So you can check out</p>
<p>recommendations from experts like the National Park Service,</p>
<p>and learn from authentic, first-hand experiences like the</p>
<p>MOM Trotter blog. Because even in a world where AI</p>
<p>can provide insights, we know that people will always value</p>
<p>the input of other people, and a thriving Web is essential to</p>
<p>that. These new generative AI</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. Thank you!</p>
<p>These new generative AI capabilities will make Search</p>
<p>smarter, and searching simpler. And as you&rsquo;ve seen, this is</p>
<p>especially helpful when you need to make sense of something</p>
<p>complex, with multiple angles to explore.</p>
<p>You know, those times when even your question has questions.</p>
<p>So, for example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re searching for a good bike</p>
<p>for a five-mile commute with hills.</p>
<p>This can be a big purchase. So you want to do some research.</p>
<p>In the AI-powered snapshot, you&rsquo;ll see important</p>
<p>considerations like motor and battery for taking on those</p>
<p>hills, and suspension for a comfortable ride.</p>
<p>Right below, you&rsquo;ll see products that fit the bill, each</p>
<p>with images, reviews, helpful descriptions and current</p>
<p>pricing. This is built on Google&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Shopping Graph, the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive dataset of</p>
<p>constantly changing products, sellers, brands, reviews and</p>
<p>inventory out there, with over 35 billion listings.</p>
<p>In fact, there are 1.8 billion live updates to our Shopping</p>
<p>Graph every hour. So you can shop with confidence</p>
<p>in this new experience, knowing that you&rsquo;ll get fresh, relevant</p>
<p>results. And for commercial queries like</p>
<p>this, we also know that ads can be especially helpful to connect</p>
<p>people with useful information and help businesses get</p>
<p>discovered online. They&rsquo;re here, clearly labeled,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re exploring different ways to integrate them as we</p>
<p>roll out n n experiences in Search.</p>
<p>And now that you&rsquo;ve done some research, you might want to</p>
<p>explore more. So right under the snapshot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see the option to ask a follow-up question, or select a</p>
<p>suggested next step. Tapping any of these options</p>
<p>will bring you into our brand new conversational mode.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. In this case, maybe you want to</p>
<p>ask a follow-up about eBikes, so you look for one in your</p>
<p>favorite color, red. And without having to go back to</p>
<p>square one, Google Search understands your full intent,</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re looking specifically for ebikes in red</p>
<p>that would be good for a five- mile commute with hills.</p>
<p>And even when you&rsquo;re in this conversational mode, it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>integrated experience, so you can simply scroll to see other</p>
<p>search results. Now, maybe this eBike seems to</p>
<p>be a good fit for your commute. With just a click, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>able to see a variety of retailers that have it in stock,</p>
<p>and some that offer free delivery or returns.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also see current prices, including deals, and can</p>
<p>seamlessly go to a merchant&rsquo;s site, check out, and turn your</p>
<p>attention to what really matters, getting ready to ride.</p>
<p>These new generative AI capabilities also unlock a whole</p>
<p>new category of experiences on Search.</p>
<p>It could help you create a clever name for your cycling</p>
<p>club, craft the perfect social post to show off your new</p>
<p>wheels, or even test your knowledge on bicycle hand</p>
<p>signals. These are thnings you may never</p>
<p>have thought to ask Search for before.</p>
<p>Shopping is just one example of where this can be helpful.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through another one in a live demo.</p>
<p>What do you say? [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>Yeah. So special shout-out to my</p>
<p>three-year-old daughter, who is obsessed with whales.</p>
<p>I wanted to teach her about whale songs, so let me go to the</p>
<p>Google app and ask, why do whales like to sing?</p>
<p>And so here I see a snapshot that organizations the Web</p>
<p>results and gets me to key things I want to know so I can</p>
<p>understand quickly that oh, they sing for a lot of different</p>
<p>reasons, like to communicate with other whales, but also to</p>
<p>find food. And I can click &ldquo;see more&rdquo; to</p>
<p>expand here as well. Now, if I was actually with my</p>
<p>daughter, and not on stage in front of thousands of people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be checking out some of these Web results right now.</p>
<p>They look pretty good. Now I&rsquo;m thinking she would get a</p>
<p>kick out of seeing one up close, so let me ask, can I see whales</p>
<p>in California? And so the LLMs right now are</p>
<p>working behind the scenes to generate my snapshot,</p>
<p>distilling insights and perspectives from across the</p>
<p>Web. It looks like in northern</p>
<p>California, I can see humpbacks around this time of year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool. I&rsquo;ll have to plan to take her on</p>
<p>a trip soon. And again, I can see some really</p>
<p>great results from across the Web.</p>
<p>And if I want to refer to the results from my previous</p>
<p>question, I can just scroll right up.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s got a birthday coming up, so I can follow up</p>
<p>with plush ones for kids under $40.</p>
<p>Again, the LLMs are organizing this information for me, and</p>
<p>this process will get faster over time.</p>
<p>These seem like some great options.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;ll really like the second one.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in to orcas as well. Phew!</p>
<p>Live demos are always nerve racking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad that one went whale!</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. What you&rsquo;ve seen today is just a</p>
<p>first look at how we&rsquo;re experimenting with generative AI</p>
<p>in Search, and we&rsquo;re excited to keep improving with your</p>
<p>feedback through our Search Labs Program.</p>
<p>This new Search generative experience, also known as SGE,</p>
<p>will be available in labs, along with some other experiments.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be rolling out in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the U.S., you can join the wait list today by</p>
<p>tapping the labs icon in the latest versions of the Google</p>
<p>app or Chrome desktop. This new experience reflects the</p>
<p>beginning of a new chapter, and you can think of this evolution</p>
<p>as Search, super charged. Search has been at the core of</p>
<p>our timeless mission for 25 years.</p>
<p>And as we build for the future, we&rsquo;re so excited for you to turn</p>
<p>to Google for things you never dreamed you  you could.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an early look at what&rsquo;s to come for AI in Search.</p>
<p>[Music playing] &raquo; Hey!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;mma make&rsquo;em talk like. I&rsquo;mma make&rsquo;em talk like whoa.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo;SUNDAR: Is a hotdog a</p>
<p>sandwich? I think it&rsquo;s more like a taco</p>
<p>because the bread goes around it.</p>
<p>[Laughter]. That comes from the expert</p>
<p>viewpoint of a vegetarian. [Laughter].</p>
<p>Thanks, Cathy. It&rsquo;s so exciting to see how we</p>
<p>are evolving Search and look forward to building it with you.</p>
<p>So far today, we have shared how AI can help unlock creativity,</p>
<p>productivity and knowledge. As you can see, AI is not only a</p>
<p>powerful enabler, it&rsquo;s also a big platform shift.</p>
<p>Every business and organization is thinking about how to drive</p>
<p>transformation. That&rsquo;s why we are focused on</p>
<p>making it easy and scalable for others to innovate with AI.</p>
<p>That means providing the most advanced computing</p>
<p>infrastructure, including state-of-the-art TPUs and GPUs,</p>
<p>and expanding access to Google&rsquo;s latest foundation models that</p>
<p>have been rigorously tested in our own products.</p>
<p>We are also working to provide world-class tooling so customers</p>
<p>can train, fine-tune and run their own models, with</p>
<p>enterprise-grade safety, security and privacy.</p>
<p>To tell you more about how we are doing this with Google</p>
<p>Cloud, please welcome Thomas. [Applause].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THOMAS KURIAN: All of the AI investments you&rsquo;ve heard about</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>today are also coming to businesses.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re an individual developer or a full-scale</p>
<p>enterprise, Google is using the power of AI to transform the way</p>
<p>you work. There are already thousands of</p>
<p>companies using our generative AI platform to create amazing</p>
<p>content, to synthesize and organize information, to</p>
<p>automate processes, and to build incredible customer experiences.</p>
<p>And yes, each and every one of you can, too.</p>
<p>There are three ways Google Cloud can help you take</p>
<p>advantage of the massive opportunity in front of you.</p>
<p>First, you can quickly build generative applications using</p>
<p>our AI platform, Vertex AI. With Vertex you can access</p>
<p>foundation models for chat, text and image.</p>
<p>You just select the model you want to use, create prompts to</p>
<p>tune the model, and you can even fine-tune the model&rsquo;s weights on</p>
<p>your own dedicated compute clusters.</p>
<p>To help you retrieve fresh and factual information from your</p>
<p>company&rsquo;s databases, your corporate internet, your Web</p>
<p>site and enterprise applications, we offer</p>
<p>Enterprise Search. Our AI platform is so compelling</p>
<p>for businesses because it guarantees the privacy of your</p>
<p>data. With both Vertex and Enterprise</p>
<p>Search, you have sole control of your data and the costs of using</p>
<p>generative AI models. In other words, your data is</p>
<p>your data, and no one else&rsquo;s. You can also choose the best</p>
<p>model for your specific needs across many sizes that have been</p>
<p>optimized for cost, latency and quality.</p>
<p>Many leading companies are using our generative AI technologies</p>
<p>to build super-cool applications, and we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>blown away by what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear from a few of them. &raquo;AMJAD MASAD: The unique thing</p>
<p>about Google Cloud is the expansive offering.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TODD PENEGOR: The Google partnership has taught us to</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>lean in, to iterate, to test and learn and have the courage to</p>
<p>fail fast where we need to. &raquo;STEVE JARRETT: But also Google</p>
<p>is a really AI centric company, and so there&rsquo;s a lot for us to</p>
<p>learn directly from the engineering team.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BERND LEUKERT: Now with generative AI, you can have a</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>much smarter conversation with our customers</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>MEL PERKINS: We have been really enjoying taking the</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>latest and greatest technology and making that accessible to</p>
<p>our entire community. &raquo;KAMRAN ZARGAHI: Getting early</p>
<p>access to Vertex APIs opens a lot of doors for us to be most</p>
<p>efficient and productive in the way we create experiences for</p>
<p>Uber customers. &raquo;AMJAD MASAD: The act of making</p>
<p>software is really suddenly open up to everyone.</p>
<p>Now you can talk to the AI on the Replit app and tell it,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMake me a workout program.‚Äù And with one click, we can</p>
<p>deploy it to a Google Cloud VM and you have an app that you</p>
<p>just talked into existence. &raquo;MEL PERKINS: We have an</p>
<p>extraordinarily exciting feature in the pipeline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Magic Video, and it enables you to take your videos</p>
<p>and images, and with just a couple of clicks, turn that into</p>
<p>a cohesive story. It is powered by Google&rsquo;s PaLM</p>
<p>technology, and it truly empowers everyone to be able to</p>
<p>create a video with absolute ease.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TODD PENEGOR: Folks come to a Wendy&rsquo;s, and a lot of times they</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>use some of our acronyms. The Junior Bacon Cheeseburger,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll come in and, ‚ÄúGive me a JBC.‚Äù</p>
<p>We need to understand what that really means, and voice AI can</p>
<p>help make sure that order is accurate every single time.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BERND LEUKERT: Genenative AI can be incorporated in all the</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>business processes Deutsche Bank is running.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>TODD PENEGOR: The partnership with Google has inspired us to</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>leverage technology, to truly transform the whole restaurant</p>
<p>experience. &raquo;BERND LEUKERT: There is no</p>
<p>limitations. &raquo;AMJAD MASAD: There&rsquo;s no other</p>
<p>way to describe it. Google&rsquo;s just living in the</p>
<p>future. [Applause].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>THOMAS KURIAN: We&rsquo;re also doing this with partners like</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Character AI. We provide Character with the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s most performant and cost-efficient infrastructure</p>
<p>for training and serving their models.</p>
<p>By combining its own AI capabilities with those of</p>
<p>Google Cloud, consumers can create their own deeply</p>
<p>personalized characters and interact with them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also partnering with Salesforce to integrate Google</p>
<p>Cloud&rsquo;s AI models and Big Query with their data cloud and</p>
<p>Einstein, their AI-infused CRM assistant.</p>
<p>In fact, we are working with many other incredible partners,</p>
<p>including consultancies, software as a service leaders,</p>
<p>consumer internet companies to build remarkable experiences</p>
<p>with our AI technologies. In addition to PaLM 2, we are</p>
<p>excited to introduce three new models in Vertex, including</p>
<p>Imag Imagine, which powers image</p>
<p>generation editing and customization from text inputs.</p>
<p>Codey for code completion and generation, which you can train</p>
<p>on your own code base to help you build applications faster,</p>
<p>and Chirp, a universal speech model which brings</p>
<p>speech-to-text accuracy for over 300 languages.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also introducing Reinforcement Learning From</p>
<p>Human Feedback into Vertex AI. You can fine-tune pre-trained</p>
<p>models by incorporating human feedback to further improve the</p>
<p>model&rsquo;s results. You can also fine-tune a model</p>
<p>on domain or industry-specific data, as we have with Sec-PaLM</p>
<p>and Med-PaLM, so they become even more powerful.</p>
<p>All of these features are now in preview, and I encourage each</p>
<p>and every one of you to try them.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. The second way we&rsquo;re helping you</p>
<p>take advantage of this opportunity is by introducing</p>
<p>Duet AI for Google Cloud. Earlier, Aparna told you about</p>
<p>Duet AI for Google Workspace and how it is an always-on AI</p>
<p>collaborator to help people get things done.</p>
<p>Well, the same thing is true with Duet AI for Google Cloud,</p>
<p>which serves as an AI expert pair programmer.</p>
<p>Duet uses generative AI to provide developers assistance</p>
<p>wherever you need it within the IDE, the Cloud console, or</p>
<p>directly within chat. It can provide contextual code</p>
<p>completion, offer suggestions tuned to your code base,</p>
<p>And generate entire functions in real-time.</p>
<p>It can even assist you with code reviews and code inspection.</p>
<p>Chen will show you more in the developer keynote.</p>
<p>The third way we are helping you seize this moment is by building</p>
<p>all of these capabilities on our AI-optimized infrastructure.</p>
<p>This infrastructure makes large-scale training workloads</p>
<p>up to 80 percent faster, and up to 50 percent cheaper compared</p>
<p>to any alternatives out there. Look, when you nearly double</p>
<p>performance &ndash; [Applause].</p>
<p>When you nearly double performance for less than half</p>
<p>the cost, amazing things can happen.</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to announce a new addition to this</p>
<p>infrastructure family, the A3 Virtual Machines based on</p>
<p>NVIDIA&rsquo;s H100 GPUs. We provide the widest choice of</p>
<p>compute options for leading AI companies like Anthropic and</p>
<p>Midjourney to build their future on Google Cloud.</p>
<p>And yes, there&rsquo;s so much more to come.</p>
<p>Next, Josh is here to show you exactly how we&rsquo;re making it easy</p>
<p>and scalable for every developer to innovate with AI and PaLM 2.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo;JOSH WOODWARD: Thanks, Thomas.</p>
<p>Our work is enabling businesses and it&rsquo;s also empowering</p>
<p>developers. PaLM 2, our most capable next</p>
<p>generation language model that Sundar talked about, powers the</p>
<p>PaLM API. Since March, we&rsquo;ve been running</p>
<p>a private preview with our PaLM API, and it&rsquo;s been amazing to</p>
<p>see how quickly developers have used it in their applications.</p>
<p>Like CHAPTR, who are generating stories so you can choose your</p>
<p>own adventure, forever changing storytime.</p>
<p>Or GameOn Technology, a company that makes chat apps for sports</p>
<p>fans and retail brands to connect with their audiences.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also Wendy&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;re using the PaLM API to</p>
<p>help customers place that correct order for the junior</p>
<p>bacon they talked about in their talk to menu feature.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m most excited by the response we&rsquo;ve gotten from</p>
<p>the developer tools community. Developers want choice when it</p>
<p>comes to language models, and we&rsquo;re working with</p>
<p>working with LangChain, Chroma, and many more to add PaLM API</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also integrated into Google developer tools like</p>
<p>Firebase and Colab. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>You can hear a lot more about the PaLM API in the Developer</p>
<p>Keynote, and sign up today. Now, to show you just how</p>
<p>powerful the PaLM API is, I want to share one concept that five</p>
<p>engineers at Google put together over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>The idea is called Project Tailwind, and we think of it as</p>
<p>an AI-first Notebook that helps you learn faster.</p>
<p>Like a real notebook, your notes and your sources power Tailwind.</p>
<p>How it works is you can simply pick the files from Google Drive</p>
<p>and it effectively creates a personalized and private AI</p>
<p>model that has expertise in the information that you give it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been developing this idea with authors like Steven</p>
<p>Johnson, and testing it at universities like Arizona State</p>
<p>and the University of Oklahoma, where I went to school.</p>
<p>Do you want to see how it works? Let&rsquo;s do a live demo.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that I&rsquo;m a student taking a computer history class.</p>
<p>I open up tailwind, and I can quickly see all my different</p>
<p>notes, assignments and reading. I can insert them and what will</p>
<p>happen when Tailwind loads up is you can see my different notes</p>
<p>and articles on the side. Here they are in the middle, and</p>
<p>it instantly creates a study guide on the right to give me</p>
<p>bearings. You can see it&rsquo;s pulling out key</p>
<p>concepts and questions, grounded in the materials that I&rsquo;ve given</p>
<p>it. Now, I can come over here and</p>
<p>quickly change it to go across all the different sources, and</p>
<p>type something like, create glossary for hopper.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s going to happen behind the scenes is it will</p>
<p>automatically compile a glossary associated with all the</p>
<p>different notes and articles relating to Grace Hopper, the</p>
<p>computer science history pioneer.</p>
<p>Look at this. Flowmattic, Coval, Compiler, all</p>
<p>created based on my notes. Now, let&rsquo;s try one more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try something else called different viewpoints on</p>
<p>Dynabook. So the Dynabook, this was a</p>
<p>concept from Alan Kay. Again, Tailwind, going out,</p>
<p>finding all the different things.</p>
<p>You can see how quickly it comes back.</p>
<p>There it is. And what&rsquo;s interesting here is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s helping me think through the concepts so it&rsquo;s giving me</p>
<p>different viewpoints. It was a visionary product.</p>
<p>It was a missed opportunity. But my favorite part is it shows</p>
<p>its work. You can see the citations here.</p>
<p>When I hover over, here&rsquo;s something from my class notes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something from ann artice the teacher assigned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all right here, grounded in my sources.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. Now, projProject Tailwind is st</p>
<p>in its early days, but we&rsquo;ve had so much fun making this</p>
<p>prototype, and we realized it&rsquo;s not just for students.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful for anyone synthesizing information from</p>
<p>many different sources that you choose.</p>
<p>Like writers researching an article, or analysts going</p>
<p>through earning calls, or even lawyers preparing for a case.</p>
<p>Imagine collaborating with an AI that&rsquo;s grounded in what you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>read and all your notes. We want to make it available to</p>
<p>try it out if you want to see it.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. There&rsquo;s a lot more you can do</p>
<p>with PaLM 2, and we can&rsquo;t wait to see what you build using the</p>
<p>PaLM API. Because generative AI is</p>
<p>changing what it means to develop new products.</p>
<p>At Google, we offer the best ML infrastructure, with powerful</p>
<p>models including those in Vertex, and APIs and tools to</p>
<p>quickly generate your own applications.</p>
<p>And building bold AI also requires a responsible approach,</p>
<p>so let me hand it over to James to share more.</p>
<p>Thanks. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>JAMES MANYIKA: Hi, everyone. I&rsquo;m James.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to Research, I lead a new area at Google called</p>
<p>Technology and Society. Growing up in Zimbabwe, I could</p>
<p>not have imagined all the amazing and ground-breaking</p>
<p>innovations that have been presented on this stage today.</p>
<p>And while I feel it&rsquo;s important to celebrate the incredible</p>
<p>progress in AI and the immense potential it has for people in</p>
<p>society everywhere, we must also acknowledge that it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>emerging technology that is still being developed, and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still so much more to do.</p>
<p>Earlier, you heard Sundar say that our approach to AI must be</p>
<p>both bold and responsible. While there is a natural tension</p>
<p>between the two, we believe it&rsquo;s not only possible, but, in fact,</p>
<p>critical to embrace that tension not only possible, but, in fact,</p>
<p>critical to embrace that tension productively.</p>
<p>The only way to be truly bold in the long-term is to be</p>
<p>responsible from the start. Our field-defining research is</p>
<p>helping scientists make bold advances in many scientific</p>
<p>fields, including medical breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Google DeepMind&rsquo;s AlphaFold program,</p>
<p>which can accurately predict the 3D shapes of 200 million</p>
<p>proteins. That&rsquo;s nearly all the cataloged</p>
<p>proteins known to science. AlphaFold gave us the equivalent</p>
<p>of nearly 400 million years of progress in just weeks.</p>
<p>[Applause]. So far, more than one million</p>
<p>researchers around the world have used AlphaFold&rsquo;s</p>
<p>predictions, including Feng Zhang&rsquo;s pioneering lab at the</p>
<p>Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.</p>
<p>In fact, in March this year, Zhang and his colleagues at MIT</p>
<p>announced they used AlphaFold to develop a novel molecular</p>
<p>syringe which could deliver drugs to help improve the</p>
<p>effectiveness of treatments for diseases like cancer.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. While it&rsquo;s exhilarating to see</p>
<p>such bold and beneficial breakthroughs, AI also has the</p>
<p>potential to worsen existing societal challenges like unfair</p>
<p>bias, as well as pose new challenges as it becomes more</p>
<p>advanced, and new uses emerge. That&rsquo;s why we believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>imperative to take a responsible approach to AI.</p>
<p>This work centers around our AI Principles that we first</p>
<p>established in 2018. These principles guide product</p>
<p>development, and they help us assess every AI application.</p>
<p>They prompt questions like, &ldquo;will it be socially</p>
<p>beneficial?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;could it lead to harm in</p>
<p>any way?&rdquo; One area that is top of mind for</p>
<p>us is misinformation. Generative AI makes it easier</p>
<p>than ever to create new content. But it also raises additional</p>
<p>questions about its trust worthiness.</p>
<p>This is why we&rsquo;re developing and providing people with tools to</p>
<p>evaluate online information. For example, have you come</p>
<p>across a photo on a Web site, or one shared by a friend, with</p>
<p>very little context, like this one of the moon landing, and</p>
<p>found yourself wondering, is this reliable?</p>
<p>I have. And I&rsquo;m sure many of you have as</p>
<p>well. In the coming months, we are</p>
<p>adding two new ways for people to evaluate images.</p>
<p>First, with our &ldquo;About this Image&rdquo; tool in Google Search.</p>
<p>You will be able to see important information such as</p>
<p>when and where similar images may have first appeared, where</p>
<p>else the image has been seen online, including news, fact</p>
<p>and social sites, all this providing you with helpful</p>
<p>context to determine if it&rsquo;s reliable.</p>
<p>Later this year, you&rsquo;ll also be able to use it if you search for</p>
<p>an image or screenshot using Google Lens, or when you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>websites in Chrome. And as we begin to roll out</p>
<p>generative image capabilities, like Sundar mentioned, we will</p>
<p>ensure that every one of our AI-generated images has</p>
<p>metadata, a markup in the original file, to give you</p>
<p>context if you come across it outside of our platforms.</p>
<p>Not only that, Creators and Publishers will be able to add</p>
<p>similar metadata, so you&rsquo;ll be able to see a label in images in</p>
<p>Google Search, marking them as AI-generated.</p>
<p>[Applause]. As we apply our AI principles,</p>
<p>we also start to see potential tensions when it comes to being</p>
<p>bold and responsible. Here is an example.</p>
<p>Universal Translator is an experimental AI video dubbing</p>
<p>service that helps experts translate a speaker&rsquo;s voice</p>
<p>while also matching their lip movements.</p>
<p>Let me show you how it works with an online college course,</p>
<p>created in partnership with Arizona State University.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What many college students don&rsquo;t realize is that knowing</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>when to ask for help, and then following through on using</p>
<p>helpful resources is actually a hallmark of becoming a</p>
<p>productive adult. [Foreign language].</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo;JAMES MANYIKA: We use next</p>
<p>generation translation models to translate what the speaker is</p>
<p>saying, models to replicate the style and the tone, and then</p>
<p>match the speaker&rsquo;s lip movem</p>
<p>movements, and then we bring it all together.</p>
<p>This is an enormous step forward for learning comprehension, and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing promising results with course completion rates.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an inherent tension here.</p>
<p>You can see how this can be incredibly beneficial, but some</p>
<p>of the same underlying technology could be misused by</p>
<p>bad actors to create deep fakes. So we&rsquo;ve built this service with</p>
<p>guardrails to help prevent misuse and, we make it</p>
<p>accessible only to authorized partners.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. And, as Sundar mentioned, soon</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be integrating our new innovations in watermarking into</p>
<p>our latest generative models to also help with the challenge of</p>
<p>misinformation. Our AI principles also help</p>
<p>guide us on what not to do. For instance, years ago, we were</p>
<p>the first major company to decide not to make a</p>
<p>general-purpose facial recognition API commercially</p>
<p>available. We felt there weren&rsquo;t adequate</p>
<p>safeguards in place. Another way we live up to our AI</p>
<p>principles is with innovations to tackle challenges as they</p>
<p>emerge, like reducing the risk of problematic outputs that may</p>
<p>be generated by our models. We are one of the first in the</p>
<p>industry to develop and launch automated adversarial testing</p>
<p>using large language model technology.</p>
<p>We do this for queries like this, to help us uncover and</p>
<p>reduce inaccurate outputs, like the one on the left, and make</p>
<p>them better, like the one on the right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing this at a scale that&rsquo;s never been done before at</p>
<p>Google, significantly improving the speed, quality and coverage</p>
<p>of testing, allowing safety experts to focus on the most</p>
<p>difficult cases. And we&rsquo;re sharing these</p>
<p>innovations with others. For example, our &ldquo;Perspective</p>
<p>API&rdquo;, originally created to help publishers mitigate toxicity is</p>
<p>now being used in large language models.</p>
<p>Academic researchers have used our perspective API to create an</p>
<p>industry evaluation standard. And today, all significant large</p>
<p>language models, including those from OpenAI and Anthropic,</p>
<p>incorporate this standard to evaluate toxicity generated by</p>
<p>their own models. [Applause].</p>
<p>Building AI responsibly must be a collective effort involving</p>
<p>researchers, social scientists, industry experts, governments</p>
<p>and everyday people, as well as creators and publishers.</p>
<p>Everyone benefits from a vibrant content ecosystem.</p>
<p>Today and in the future. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>feedback and will be working with the Web community on ways</p>
<p>to give publishers choice and control over their Web content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an exciting time. There&rsquo;s so much we can</p>
<p>accomplish, and so much we must get right together.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with all of you.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;ll hand it off to Sameer, who will speak to you</p>
<p>about all the exciting developments we&rsquo;re bringing to</p>
<p>Android. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo;SAMEER: Hi, everyone!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to be back at Google I/O.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve heard today, our bold and responsible approach to AI</p>
<p>can unlock people&rsquo;s creativity and potential.</p>
<p>But how can all this helpfulness reach as many people as</p>
<p>possible? At Google, our computing</p>
<p>platforms and hardware products have been integral to that</p>
<p>mission. From the beginning of Android,</p>
<p>we believed that an open OS would enable a whole ecosystem</p>
<p>and bring smartphones to everyone.</p>
<p>And as we all add more devices to our lives, like tablets, TVs,</p>
<p>cars and more, this openness creates the freedom to choose</p>
<p>the devices that are best for you.</p>
<p>With more than three billion Android devices, we&rsquo;ve now seen</p>
<p>the benefits of using AI to improve experiences at scale.</p>
<p>For example, this past year, Android used AI models to</p>
<p>protect users from more than 100 billion suspected spam messages</p>
<p>and calls. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>We can all agree, that&rsquo;s pretty useful!</p>
<p>There are so many opportunities where AI can just make things</p>
<p>better. Today, we&rsquo;ll talk about two big</p>
<p>ways Android is bringing that benefit of computing to</p>
<p>everyone. First, continuing to connect you</p>
<p>to the most complete ecosystem of devices, where everything</p>
<p>works better together. And second, using AI to make</p>
<p>things you love about Android even better, starting with</p>
<p>customization and expression. Let&rsquo;s begin by talking about</p>
<p>Android&rsquo;s ecosystem of devices, starting with two of the most</p>
<p>important: Tablets and watches. Over the last two years, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>redesigned the experience on large screens, including tablets</p>
<p>and foldables. We introduced a new system for</p>
<p>multi-tasking that makes it so much easier to take advantage of</p>
<p>all that extra screen real estate and seamlessly move</p>
<p>between apps. We&rsquo;ve made huge investments to</p>
<p>optimize more than 50 Google apps, including G-mail, photos</p>
<p>and meet. And we&rsquo;re working closely with</p>
<p>partners such as Minecraft, Spotify and Disney+ to build</p>
<p>beautiful experiences that feel intuitive on larger screens.</p>
<p>People are falling in love with Android tablets and there are</p>
<p>more great devices to pick from than ever.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for our hardware announcements, where you just</p>
<p>might see some of the awesome new features we&rsquo;re building for</p>
<p>tablets in action. It&rsquo;s really exciting to see the</p>
<p>&ndash; [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really exciting to see the momentum in smart watches as</p>
<p>well. WearOS is now the</p>
<p>fastest-growing watch platform, just two years after launching</p>
<p>WearOS 3 with Samsung. A top ask from fans has been for</p>
<p>more native messaging apps on the watch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to share that WhatsApp is bringing their</p>
<p>first-ever watch app to Wear this summer.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. I&rsquo;m really enjoying using</p>
<p>WhatsApp on my wrist. I can start a new conversation,</p>
<p>reply to messages by voice and even take calls.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for you to try it. Our partnership on WearOS with</p>
<p>Samsung has been amazing, and I&rsquo;m excited about our new</p>
<p>Android collaboration on immersive XR.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll share more later this year.</p>
<p>Now, we all know that to get the best experience, all these</p>
<p>devices need to work seamlessly together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be simple. That&rsquo;s why we built Fast Pair,</p>
<p>which lets you easily connect more than 300 headphones.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why we have Nearby Share to easily move files</p>
<p>between your phone, tablet or windows in Chrome OS computer.</p>
<p>And Cast, to make streaming video and audio to your devices</p>
<p>ultra simple, with support for over 3,000 apps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to have all of our devices connected, but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>anything like me, it can be hard to keep track of all the stuff.</p>
<p>Just ask my family. I misplace my earbuds at least</p>
<p>three times a day, which is why we&rsquo;re launching a major update</p>
<p>to our Find My Device experience to support a wide range of</p>
<p>devices in your life, including headphones, tablets and more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s powered by a network of billions of Android devices</p>
<p>around the world, so if you leave your earbuds at the gym,</p>
<p>other nearby Android devices can help you locate them.</p>
<p>And for other important things in your life, like your bicycle</p>
<p>or suitcase, Tile, Chipolo, and others, will have tracker tags</p>
<p>that work with the Find My Device Network as well.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. Now, we took some time to really</p>
<p>get this right, because protecting your privacy and</p>
<p>safety is vital. From the start, we designed the</p>
<p>network in a privacy-preserving way, where location information</p>
<p>is encrypted. No one else can tell where your</p>
<p>devices are located, not even Google.</p>
<p>This is also why we are introducing Unknown Tracker</p>
<p>Alerts. Your phone will tell you if an</p>
<p>unrecognized tracking tag is moving with you, and help you</p>
<p>locate it. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that these warnings work on your Android</p>
<p>phone, but on other types of phones as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why last week, we published a new industry stander</p>
<p>with Apple, outlining how unknown tracker alerts will work</p>
<p>across all smartphones. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>Both the new Find My Device experience and Unknown Tracker</p>
<p>Alerts are coming later this summer.</p>
<p>[Applause]. Now, we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about</p>
<p>connecting devices, but Android is also about connecting people.</p>
<p>After all, phones were created for us to communicate with our</p>
<p>friends and family. When you are texting in a group</p>
<p>chat, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about whether everyone is</p>
<p>using the same type of phone. Sending high-quality images and</p>
<p>video, getting typing notifications and end-to-end</p>
<p>encryption should all just work. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve worked with our</p>
<p>partners on upgrading old SMS and MMS technology to a modern</p>
<p>standard called RCS. That makes all of this possible,</p>
<p>and there are now over 800 million people with RCS.</p>
<p>On our way to over a billion by the end of the year.</p>
<p>We hope every mobile operating System &ndash; [Laughter] &ndash; gets the</p>
<p>message and adopts RCS. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>So we can all hang out in the group chat together, no matter</p>
<p>what device we&rsquo;re using. Whether it&rsquo;s connecting with</p>
<p>your loved ones or connecting all of your devices, Android&rsquo;s</p>
<p>complete ecosystem makes it easy.</p>
<p>Another thing people love about Android is the ability to</p>
<p>customize their devices and express themselves.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Dave to tell you how we are taking this to the next</p>
<p>level with generative AI. [Ae].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DAVE: Thanks, Sameer. And hello, everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>With Google&rsquo;s advances in generative AI so your phone can</p>
<p>feel even more personal. So let me show you what this</p>
<p>looks like. To start, messages and</p>
<p>conversation can be so much more expressive, fun and playful with</p>
<p>Magic Compose. It&rsquo;s a new feature coming to</p>
<p>Google Messages powered by generative AI that helps you add</p>
<p>that extra spark of personality to your conversation.</p>
<p>Just type your message like you normally would, and choose how</p>
<p>you want to sound. Magic Compose will do the</p>
<p>rest. So your messages give off more</p>
<p>positivity, more rhymes, more professionalism.</p>
<p>Or if you want, in the style of a certain playwright.</p>
<p>To try or not to try this feature, that is the question.</p>
<p>Now, we also have new personalizations coming to the</p>
<p>OS layer. At Google I/O two years ago, we</p>
<p>introduced Material You. It&rsquo;s a design system which</p>
<p>combines user inspiration with dynamic color science for a</p>
<p>fully personalized experience. We&rsquo;re continuing to expand on</p>
<p>this in Android 14 with all new customization options coming to</p>
<p>your lockscreen. Now, I can add my own</p>
<p>personalized style to the lockscreen clock so that it</p>
<p>looks just the way I want. And what&rsquo;s more, with the new</p>
<p>customizable lockscreen shortcuts, I can instantly jump</p>
<p>in to my most frequent activities.</p>
<p>Of course, what really makes your lockscreen and home screen</p>
<p>yours is the wallpaper, and it&rsquo;s first thing that many of us</p>
<p>set when we get a new phone. Now, emojis are such a fun and</p>
<p>simple way of expressing yourself so we thought wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it be cool to bring them to your wallpaper?</p>
<p>With Emoji wallpapers, you can choose your favorite combination</p>
<p>of emojis, pick the perfect pattern, and find just the right</p>
<p>color to bring it all together. So let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not going to use the laptops.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use a phone. All right.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see. I&rsquo;m going to go into the</p>
<p>wallpaper picker, and I&rsquo;m going to tap on the new option for</p>
<p>emojis. And I&rsquo;m feeling in a kind of, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know, zany mood, with all you people looking at me, so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to pick this guy and this guy, and let&rsquo;s see, who else is</p>
<p>in here? This one looks pretty cool.</p>
<p>I like the ape fit one, and obviously that one.</p>
<p>And somebody said there was a duck on stage earlier, so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go find a duck. Hello, duck.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the duck. Anyone see a duck?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the duck? There&rsquo;s the duck.</p>
<p>All right. There it is.</p>
<p>We got some ducks. Okay.</p>
<p>Cool. And then pattern-wise, we got a</p>
<p>bunch of different patterns you can pick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pick mosaic. That&rsquo;s my favorite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to play with the Zoom. Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get this just right. Okay.</p>
<p>I got enough ducks in there. Okay.</p>
<p>Cool. And then colors, let&rsquo;s see, ooh,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go with the more muted one.</p>
<p>That one. No, that looks good.</p>
<p>I like that one. All right.</p>
<p>Select that, set the wallpaper, and then I go, boom!</p>
<p>Looks pretty cool, huh? [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>And the little emojis, they react when you tap them, which I</p>
<p>find unusually satisfying. How much time have I got?</p>
<p>Okay. Now, of course, so many of us</p>
<p>like to use a favorite photo for our wallpaper, and so with the</p>
<p>new cinematic wallpaper feature you can create a stunning 3D</p>
<p>image from any regular photo and then use it as your wallpaper.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look. So this time I&rsquo;m going to go</p>
<p>into my photos. And I really like this photo of</p>
<p>my daughter, so let me select that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s a sparkle icon at the top.</p>
<p>So if I tap that, I then get an option for cinematic wallpaper.</p>
<p>So let me tap that, and wait for it.</p>
<p>Boom. Now, under the hood, we&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>an on-device convolutional neural network to estimate</p>
<p>depth, and a generative adversarial network for</p>
<p>inpainting as the background moves.</p>
<p>The result is a beautiful cinematic 3D photo.</p>
<p>So now let me set the wallpaper. And then I&rsquo;m going to return</p>
<p>home. And check out the parallax</p>
<p>effect as I tilt the device. It literally jumps off the</p>
<p>screen. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>Both Cinematic Wallpapers and Emoji Wallpapers are coming</p>
<p>first to Pixel devices next month.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. So let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the perfect wallpaper photo handy, or you just want to have</p>
<p>fun and create something new. With our new Generative AI</p>
<p>wallpapers, you choose what inspires you, and we create a</p>
<p>beautiful wallpaper to fit your vision.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look. So this time, I&rsquo;m going to go</p>
<p>and select create a wallpaper with AI.</p>
<p>And I like classic art, so let me tap that.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;ll notice at the bottom we use structured prompts to</p>
<p>make it easier to create. So for example, I can pick &ndash;</p>
<p>what am I going to do? City by the bay in a</p>
<p>post-impressionist style. Cool.</p>
<p>And I type &ndash; tap create wallpaper.</p>
<p>Nice. Now, behind the scenes, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using Google&rsquo;s text-to-image diffusion models to generate</p>
<p>completely new and original wallpapers.</p>
<p>And I can swipe through and see different options that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>created. And some of these look really</p>
<p>cool, right? [Applause].</p>
<p>So let me pick this one. I like this one.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll select that. Set the wallpaper.</p>
<p>And then return home. Cool.</p>
<p>So now, out of billions of sxroIs phones in the world, no</p>
<p>other phone will be quite like mine.</p>
<p>And thanks to Material You, you can see the system&rsquo;s color</p>
<p>palette automatically adapts to match the wallpaper I created.</p>
<p>Generative AI Wallpapers will be coming this fall.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. So from a thriving ecosystem of</p>
<p>devices to AI-powered expression, there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>going on right now in Android. Okay.</p>
<p>Rick is up next to show you how this Android innovation is</p>
<p>coming to life in the Pixel family of devices.</p>
<p>Thank you. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>RICK OSTERLOH: The pace of AI innovation over the past year</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>has been astounding. As you heard Sundar talk about</p>
<p>earlier, new advances are transforming everything from</p>
<p>creativity and productivity to knowledge and learning.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about what that innovation means for Pixel,</p>
<p>which has been leading the way in AI-driven hardware</p>
<p>experiences for years. Now, from the beginning, Pixel</p>
<p>was conceived as an AI-first mobile computer, bringing</p>
<p>together all the amazing breakthroughs across the</p>
<p>company, and putting them in to a Google device you can hold in</p>
<p>your hand. Other phones have AI features,</p>
<p>but Pixel is the only phone with AI at the center.</p>
<p>And I mean that literally. The Google Tensor G2 chip is</p>
<p>custom designed to put Google&rsquo;s leading-edge AI research to work</p>
<p>in our Pixel devices. By combining Tensor&rsquo;s on-device</p>
<p>intelligence with Google&rsquo;s AI in the cloud, Pixel delivers truly</p>
<p>personal AI. Your device adapts to your own</p>
<p>needs and preferences, and anticipates how it can help you</p>
<p>save time and get more done. This Personal AI enables all</p>
<p>those helpful experiences that Pixel is known for that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>available on any other mobile device.</p>
<p>on any other mobile device. Like pixel Call Assist, which</p>
<p>helps you avoid long hold times, navigate phone tree menus,</p>
<p>ignore the calls you don&rsquo;t want and get better sound quality on</p>
<p>the calls you do want. [Laughter].</p>
<p>Personal AI also enables helpful Pixel Speech capabilities.</p>
<p>On-device machine learning translates different languages</p>
<p>for you, transcribes conversations in real time, and</p>
<p>understands how you talk and type.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re protected with Pixel Safe, a collection of features</p>
<p>that keep you safe online and in the real world.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s Pixel Camera &ndash;</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. It understands faces,</p>
<p>expressions and skin tones to better depict you and the people</p>
<p>you care about, so your photos will always look amazing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also constantly working to make Pixel Camera more inclusive</p>
<p>and more accessible, with features like Real Tone and</p>
<p>Guided Frame. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>Pixel experiences continue to be completely unique in mobile</p>
<p>computing, and that&rsquo;s because Pixel is the only phone</p>
<p>engineered end-to-end by Google, and the only phone that combines</p>
<p>Google Tensor, Android and AI. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>With this combination of hardware and software, Pixel</p>
<p>lets you experience all those incredible new AI-powered</p>
<p>features you saw today in one place.</p>
<p>For example, the new Magic Editor in Google Photos that</p>
<p>Sundar showed you will be available for early access to</p>
<p>select Pixel phones later this year, opening up a whole new</p>
<p>avenue of creativity with your photos.</p>
<p>Dave just showed you how Android is adding depth to how you can</p>
<p>express yourself with new Generative AI wallpapers, and</p>
<p>across Search, Workspace and Bard, new features powered by</p>
<p>large language models can spark your imagination, make big tasks</p>
<p>more manageable, and help you find better answers to everyday</p>
<p>questions, all from your Pixel device.</p>
<p>We have so many more exciting developments in this space.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t wait to show you more in the coming months.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s probably no surprise that as AI keeps getting more</p>
<p>and more helpful, our Pixel portfolio keeps growing in</p>
<p>popularity. Last year&rsquo;s Pixel devices are</p>
<p>our most popular generation yet, with both users and respected</p>
<p>reviewers and analysts. [Applause].</p>
<p>Our Pixel phones won multiple Phone of the Year awards.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. Yes.</p>
<p>Thank you. And in the premium smartphone</p>
<p>category, Google is the fastest-growing OEM in our</p>
<p>markets. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>One of our more popular products is the Pixel A-series, which</p>
<p>delivers incredible &ndash; [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you. I&rsquo;m glad you like it.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It delivers incredible Pixel performance in a very affordable</p>
<p>device. And to continue the I/O</p>
<p>tradition, let me show you the newest member of our A-series.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. Today, we&rsquo;re completely</p>
<p>upgrading everything you love about our A-series with the</p>
<p>gorgeous new Pixel 7a. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>Like all Pixel 7 series devices, the Pixel 7a is powered by our</p>
<p>flagship Google Tensor G2 chip, and it&rsquo;s paired with eight</p>
<p>gigabytes of ram, which ensures Pixel 7a delivers best-in-class</p>
<p>performance and intelligence. And you&rsquo;re going to love the</p>
<p>camera. The 7a takes the crown from 6a</p>
<p>as the highest-rated camera in its class, with the biggest</p>
<p>upgrade ever to our A-series camera hardware, including a 72</p>
<p>percent bigger main camera sensor.</p>
<p>[Applause]. Now, here&rsquo;s the best part.</p>
<p>Pixel 7a is available today, starting at $499.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. It&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination</p>
<p>of design, performance and photography, all at a great</p>
<p>value. You can check out the entire</p>
<p>Pixel 7a lineup on the Google Store, including our exclusive</p>
<p>Coral color. Now, next up, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>show you how we&rsquo;re continuing to expand the Pixel portfolio into</p>
<p>new form factors. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>Yeah. Like foldables and tablets.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. You can see them right there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete ecosystem of AI-powered devices naerjd by</p>
<p>Google. Here&rsquo;s Rose to share what a</p>
<p>larger-screen Pixel can do for you.</p>
<p>[Applause]. &raquo;ROSE: Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk tablets. Which have been a little bit</p>
<p>frustrating. It has always been hard to know</p>
<p>where they fit in, and they haven&rsquo;t really changed the past</p>
<p>ten years. A lot of the time, they are</p>
<p>sitting, forgotten in a drawer, and that one moment you</p>
<p>need it, it is out of battery. [Laughter].</p>
<p>We believe tablets, and large screens in general, still have a</p>
<p>lot of potential. So we set out to build something</p>
<p>different, making big investments across Google apps,</p>
<p>Android and Pixel, to reimagine how large screens can deliver a</p>
<p>more helpful experience. Pixel Tablet is the only tablet</p>
<p>engineered by Google and designed specifically to be</p>
<p>helpful in your hand and in the place they are used the most,</p>
<p>the home. We designed the Pixel Tablet to</p>
<p>uniquely deliver helpful Pixel experiences, and that starts</p>
<p>with great hardware. A beautiful 11-inch,</p>
<p>high-resolution display with crisp audio from the four</p>
<p>built-in speakers. A premium aluminum enclosure</p>
<p>with a nanoceramic coating that feels great in the hand and is</p>
<p>cool to the touch. The world&rsquo;s best Android</p>
<p>experience on a tablet, powered by Google Tensor G2, for</p>
<p>long-lasting battery life and cutting-edge personal AI.</p>
<p>For example, with Tensor G2, we optimize the Pixel Camera</p>
<p>specifically for video calling. Tablets are fantastic video</p>
<p>calling devices. And with Pixel Tablet, you are</p>
<p>always in frame, in focus and looking your best.</p>
<p>The large screen makes Pixel Tablet the best Pixel device for</p>
<p>editing photos, with AI-powered tools like Magic Eraser, and</p>
<p>Photo Unblur. Now, typing on a tablet can be</p>
<p>so frustrating. With Pixel Speech and Tensor G2,</p>
<p>we have the best voice recognition, making voice typing</p>
<p>nearly three times faster than tapping.</p>
<p>And as Sameer mentioned, we&rsquo;ve been making huge investments to</p>
<p>create great app experiences for larger screens, including more</p>
<p>than 50 of our own apps. With Pixel tablet, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting great tablet hardware with great tablet apps, but we</p>
<p>saw an opportunity to make the tablet even more helpful in the</p>
<p>home. So we engineered a first of its</p>
<p>kind charging speaker dock. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>It gives the tablet a home. And now, you never have to worry</p>
<p>about it being charged. Pixel Tablet is always ready to</p>
<p>help, 24/7. When it&rsquo;s docked, the new Hub</p>
<p>Mode turns Pixel Tablet into a beautiful digital photo frame, a</p>
<p>powerful smart home controller, a voice activated helper, and a</p>
<p>shared entertainment device. It feels like a smart display,</p>
<p>but it has one huge advantage. With the ultra fast fingerprint</p>
<p>sensor, I can quickly unlock the device and get immediate access</p>
<p>to all of my favorite Android apps.</p>
<p>So I can quickly find a recipe with Side Chef, or discover a</p>
<p>new podcast on Spotify, or find something to watch with the</p>
<p>tablet-optimized Google TV app. Your media is going to look and</p>
<p>sound great with room-filling sound from the charging speaker</p>
<p>dock. Pixel Tablet is also the</p>
<p>ultimate way to control your smart home.</p>
<p>And that starts with the new, redesigned Google Home App.</p>
<p>It looks great on Pixel Tablet, and it brings together over</p>
<p>80,000 supported smart home devices, including all of your</p>
<p>Matter-Enabled devices. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>We also made it really easy to access your smart home controls</p>
<p>directly from Hub Mode. With the new home panel, any</p>
<p>family member can quickly adjust the lights, lock the doors or</p>
<p>see if a package was delivered. Or, if you&rsquo;re lazy, likee, you</p>
<p>can just use your voice. Now, we know that tablets are</p>
<p>often shared, so a tablet for the home needs to support</p>
<p>multiple users. Pixel Tablet makes switching</p>
<p>between users super easy, so you get your own apps and your own</p>
<p>content while maintaining your privacy.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. And my favorite part, it is so</p>
<p>easy to move content between devices.</p>
<p>Pixel Tablet is the first tablet with Chromecast built in, so</p>
<p>with a few taps &ndash; [Applause].</p>
<p>&ndash; I can easily cast some music or my favorite show from the</p>
<p>phone to the tablet. And then I can just take the</p>
<p>tablet off the dock and keep listening or watching all around</p>
<p>the house. We designed a new type of case</p>
<p>for Pixel Tablet that solves the pain of flimsy tablet cases.</p>
<p>It has a built-in stand that provides continuous flexibility</p>
<p>and is sturdy at all angles, so you can confidently use your</p>
<p>tablet anywhere, on a plane, in bed or in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The case easily docks, so you never have to take it off to</p>
<p>charge. It&rsquo;s just another example of how</p>
<p>we can make the tablet experience even more helpful.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. The new Pixel Tablet</p>
<p>comes in three colors. It is available for pre-order</p>
<p>today and ships next month, starting at just $499.</p>
<p>[Applause]. And the best part, every Pixel</p>
<p>Tablet comes bundled with a $129 charging speaker dock for free!</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. It is truly the best tablet in</p>
<p>your hand and in your home. To give you an idea of just how</p>
<p>helpful Pixel Tablet can be, we asked TV personality Michelle</p>
<p>Buteau to put it to the test. Let&rsquo;s see how that went.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>MICHELLE BUTEAU: When Google asked me to spend the day with</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>this tablet, I was a little apprehensive, because I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>tech person. I don&rsquo;t know how things work all</p>
<p>the time. But I&rsquo;m a woman in STEM now.</p>
<p>Some days I could barely find the floor, let alone the charger</p>
<p>for something, so when the Google folks said something</p>
<p>about a tablet that docks, I was like, okay then, Google, prove</p>
<p>it! [Music playing].</p>
<p>[Laughter]. I&rsquo;m on average two to five</p>
<p>meetings a day. Today I got stuck on all these</p>
<p>features, honey, the 360 of it all!</p>
<p>The last time I was around this much sand, some of it got caught</p>
<p>in my belly button, and I had a pearl two weeks later.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s a bird! So this is what I love about my</p>
<p>me time today. Six shows just popped up based</p>
<p>off of my preferences. And they were like, hey, girl!</p>
<p>[Laughter]. I would have made it funnier,</p>
<p>but that was good. My husband is actually a</p>
<p>photographer, so I have to rely on him to make everything nice</p>
<p>and pretty. But now, I love this picture of</p>
<p>me and my son, but there&rsquo;s a boom mic there.</p>
<p>Look. It&rsquo;s right here.</p>
<p>You see this one? Get this mic.</p>
<p>You see that? Magic Eraser, I can circle or</p>
<p>brush. I&rsquo;m going to do both.</p>
<p>Boom! How cute is that!</p>
<p>And so I hope not only you guys are happy with me reviewing</p>
<p>this, but that you&rsquo;ll also give me one, because, I mean &ndash;</p>
<p>[Laughter]. You&rsquo;re getting tired, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not! &raquo; You&rsquo;re not?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay. &lsquo;Cause I am.</p>
<p>[Applause]. &raquo;RICK: That&rsquo;s a pretty good</p>
<p>first review. Now, tablets aren&rsquo;t the only</p>
<p>large-screen device we want to show you today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been really exciting to see foldables take off over the past</p>
<p>few years. Android&rsquo;s driven so much</p>
<p>innovation in this new form-factor, and we see</p>
<p>tremendous potential here. We&rsquo;ve heard from our users</p>
<p>that the dream foldable should have a versatile form factor,</p>
<p>making it great to use both folded and unfolded.</p>
<p>It should also have a flagship-level camera system</p>
<p>that truly takes advantage of the unique design.</p>
<p>And an app experience that&rsquo;s fluid and seamless across both</p>
<p>screens. Creating a foldable like that</p>
<p>it really means pushing the envelope with state-of-the-art</p>
<p>technology, and that means an ultra-premium $1799 device.</p>
<p>Now, to get there, we&rsquo;ve been working closely with our Android</p>
<p>colleagues to create a new standard for foldable</p>
<p>technology. Introducing Google Pixel Fold.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. It combines Tensor G2 Android</p>
<p>innovation and AI for an incredible phone that unfolds</p>
<p>into an incredible compact tablet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only foldable engineered by Google to adapt to</p>
<p>how you want to use it, with a familiar front display that</p>
<p>works great when it&rsquo;s folded, and when it&rsquo;s unfolded, it&rsquo;s our</p>
<p>thinnest phone yet and the thinnest foldable on the market.</p>
<p>[Applause]. Now, to get there, we had to</p>
<p>pack a flagship-level phone into nearly half the thickness, which</p>
<p>meant completely redesigning components like the telephoto</p>
<p>lens and the battery, and a lot more.</p>
<p>So it can fold up and it can fit in your pocket, and retain that</p>
<p>familiar smartphone silhouette when it&rsquo;s in your hand, but</p>
<p>Pixelfold has three times the screen space of a normal phone.</p>
<p>You unfold it and you&rsquo;re treated to an expansive I 7.6-inch</p>
<p>display that opens flat with a custom 180-degree fluid-friction</p>
<p>hinge. So you&rsquo;re getting the best of</p>
<p>both worlds. It&rsquo;s a powerful smartphone when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s convenient and an immersive tablet when you need one.</p>
<p>And like every phone we make, Pixel Fold is built to last.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve extensively tested the hinge to be the most durable of</p>
<p>any foldable. Corning Gorilla Glass Victus</p>
<p>protects it from exterior scratches, while the IPX8 water</p>
<p>resistant design safeguards against the weather.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;d expect from a Pixel device, Pixel Fold gives you</p>
<p>entirely new ways to take stunning photos and videos with</p>
<p>Pixel Camera. Put the camera in tabletop</p>
<p>mode to capture the stars. And you can get closer with the</p>
<p>best zoom on a foldable. And use the best camera on the</p>
<p>phone for your selfies. The unique combination of form</p>
<p>factor, triple rear camera hardware, and Personal AI with</p>
<p>Tensor G2 make it the best foldable camera system.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. Now, there are so many</p>
<p>experiences that feel even more natural with a Pixel fold.</p>
<p>One is the Dual Screen Interpreter Mode.</p>
<p>Your Pixel Fold can use both displays, both displays, to</p>
<p>provide a live translation to you and the person you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking to. So it&rsquo;s really easy to connect</p>
<p>across languages. [Applause].</p>
<p>And powering all of this is Google Tensor G2.</p>
<p>Pixel Fold has all of the Personal AI features you would</p>
<p>expect from a top of the line Pixel device, across safety,</p>
<p>speech and call assist. Plus, great performance for</p>
<p>on-the-go multi-tasking and entertainment.</p>
<p>And the entire foldable experience is built on Android.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get Dave back out here to show you the latest improvements</p>
<p>to Android that you&rsquo;ll get to experience on Pixel Fold.</p>
<p>[Applause]. &raquo;DAVE: Thanks, Rick.</p>
<p>From new form factors and customizability to biometrics</p>
<p>and computational photography, Android has always been at the</p>
<p>forefront of mobile industry breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Recently, we&rsquo;ve been working on a ton of features and</p>
<p>improvements for large-screen devices like tablets and</p>
<p>foldables. So who thinks we should try a</p>
<p>bunch of live demos on the new Pixel Fold?</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. All right.</p>
<p>It starts the second I unfold the device with this stunning</p>
<p>wallpaper animation. The hinge sensor is actually</p>
<p>driving the animation, and it&rsquo;s a subtle thing, but it makes the</p>
<p>device feel so dynamic and alive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just love that. All right.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to the folded state.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking through Google photos at a recent snowboarding</p>
<p>trip. Now, the scenery is really</p>
<p>beautiful so I want to show you on the big screen.</p>
<p>I just open my phone, and the video instantly expands into</p>
<p>this gorgeous full-screen view. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>We call this continuity, and we&rsquo;ve obsessed over every</p>
<p>millisecond it takes for apps to seamlessly adapt from the</p>
<p>smaller screen to the larger screen.</p>
<p>Now, all work and no play makes Davey a dull boy, so I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to message my buddy about getting back out on the</p>
<p>mountain. I can just swipe to bring up the</p>
<p>new Android taskbar, and then drag Google messages to the side</p>
<p>to enter split screen mode like so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send my buddy a photo to try to inspire him.</p>
<p>I just drag and drop straight from Google Photos right into my</p>
<p>message. Like so.</p>
<p>And thanks to the new Jetpack drag and drop library, this is</p>
<p>now supported in a wide variety of apps from WorkSpace to</p>
<p>WhatsApp. You&rsquo;ll notice we&rsquo;ve made a bunch</p>
<p>of improvements throughout the OS to take advantage of the</p>
<p>larger screen. So for example, here&rsquo;s the new</p>
<p>split keyboard for faster typing.</p>
<p>And if I pull down from the top, you&rsquo;ll notice the new two-panel</p>
<p>shade showing about my notifications and my quick</p>
<p>settings at the same time. Now, Pixel Fold is great for</p>
<p>productivity on the go. And if I swipe up into Overview,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that we now keep the multi-tasking windows</p>
<p>paired. And for example, I was working</p>
<p>on a Google Docs and Slides earlier to prep for this</p>
<p>keynote, and I think I&rsquo;ve &ndash; I think I&rsquo;ve followed most of</p>
<p>these tips so far, but I&rsquo;m not quite done yet.</p>
<p>I can even adjust the split to suit the content that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>viewing, and, you know, working this way, it&rsquo;s like having a</p>
<p>dual monitor set up in the palm of my hand, allowing me to do</p>
<p>two things at once. Which reminds me, I should</p>
<p>probably send Rick a quick note, so I&rsquo;ll open G-mail and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of time so I&rsquo;m going to use the new help me write</p>
<p>feature, so let&rsquo;s try this out. Don&rsquo;t cheer yet.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if it works. Okay.</p>
<p>Rick, congrats on &ndash; what are we going to call this, Pixel Fold&rsquo;s</p>
<p>launch, amazing with Android. Okay.</p>
<p>And then I probably should say, Dave &ndash; not Andrew, Android.</p>
<p>Dave. It&rsquo;s hard to type with all you</p>
<p>people looking at me. All right.</p>
<p>Now, by the power of large language models, allow me to</p>
<p>elaborate. Dear Rick, congratulations on</p>
<p>the successful launch of Pixel Fold, I&rsquo;m really impressed with</p>
<p>the device and how well it works with Android.</p>
<p>The foldable screen is a game changer, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see</p>
<p>what you do &ndash; [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>All right. That&rsquo;s productivity.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more. The Pixel Efold is also an</p>
<p>awesome entertainment device, and YouTube is just a really</p>
<p>great showcase for this so let&rsquo;s start watching this video on the</p>
<p>big screen. Now, look what happens when I</p>
<p>fold the device at right angles. YouTube enters what we call</p>
<p>tabletop mode so that the video plays on the top half and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working on adding playback controls on the bottom half for</p>
<p>an awesome single-handed lean-back experience.</p>
<p>And the video just keeps playing fluidly through these</p>
<p>transitions without losing a beat.</p>
<p>Okay. One last thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re adding support for switching displays within an</p>
<p>app, and Pixel Efold&rsquo;s camera is a really great example of that.</p>
<p>Now, by the way, say hi to Julie behind me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the real star of the show. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>So Pixel Fold has this new button on the bottom right so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tap this and it means I can move the view finder</p>
<p>to the outside screen. So let me turn the device</p>
<p>around. Okay.</p>
<p>So why is this interesting? Well, it means that the feview</p>
<p>finder is now beside the rear camera system and that means I</p>
<p>can get a high-quality, ultra-wide, amazing selfie with</p>
<p>the best camera on the device. Speaking of which, and you knew</p>
<p>where this was going! Smile, everybody!</p>
<p>You look awesome! [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>I always wanted to do that on Google I/O keynote.</p>
<p>All right. So what you&rsquo;re seeing here is</p>
<p>the culmination of several years of work, in fact, on large</p>
<p>screens, spanning the Android OS and the most popular apps on the</p>
<p>play store. All this where it comes alive on</p>
<p>the amazing new Pixel Tablet and Pixel Fold, check out this</p>
<p>video. Thank you.</p>
<p>They ain&rsquo;t never seen it like. This ain&rsquo;t never seen it like</p>
<p>this. This, this, this like this.</p>
<p>Never seen it like this, this, this, this, this, like this.</p>
<p>They ain&rsquo;t never seen it like this.</p>
<p>This. Like this.</p>
<p>They ain&rsquo;t never seen it like this.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo; That demo is awesome.</p>
<p>Across Pixel and Android, we&rsquo;re making huge strides with</p>
<p>large-screen devices, and we can&rsquo;t wait to get Pixel Tablet</p>
<p>and Pixel Fold into your hands. And you&rsquo;re not going to have to</p>
<p>wait too long. You can pre-order Pixel Fold</p>
<p>starting today and it will ship next month.</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. And you&rsquo;ll get the most out of</p>
<p>our first ultra-premium foldable by pairing it with Pixel Watch.</p>
<p>So when you pre-order a Pixel Fold, you&rsquo;ll also get a Pixel</p>
<p>Watch on us. [Cheers and Applause].</p>
<p>The Pixel family continues to grow into the most dynamic</p>
<p>mobile hardware portfolio in the market today.</p>
<p>From a broad selection of smartphones to watches, earbuds,</p>
<p>and now tablets and foldables, there are more ways than ever to</p>
<p>experience the helpfulness Pixel is known for whenever and</p>
<p>wherever you need it. Now let me pass it back to</p>
<p>Sundar. Thanks, everyone!</p>
<p>[Cheers and Applause]. &raquo;SUNDAR: Thanks, Rick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really enjoying the new tablet and the first Pixel</p>
<p>foldable phone, and am proud of the progress Android is driving</p>
<p>across the ecosystem. As we wrap up, I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>reflecting on the big technology shifts that we have all been a</p>
<p>part of. The shift with AI is as big as</p>
<p>they come, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important that we make AI</p>
<p>helpful for everyone. We are approaching it boldly</p>
<p>with a sense of excitement, and because as we look ahead,</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s deep understanding of information, combined with the</p>
<p>capabilities of generative AI, can transform Search and all of</p>
<p>our products yet again. And we are doing this</p>
<p>responsibly in a way that underscores the deep commitment</p>
<p>we feel to get it right. No one company can do this</p>
<p>alone. Our developer community will be</p>
<p>key to unlocking the enormous opportunities ahead.</p>
<p>We look forward to working together and building together.</p>
<p>So on behalf of all of us at Google, thank you, and enjoy the</p>
<p>rest of I/O. [Cheers and Applause].</p>

<p>bring people together and make them feel present with each</p>
<p>other, even if physically they are miles apart.</p>
<p>Our earlier prototype relied on several cameras and sensors to</p>
<p>produce a live 3D image of the remote person.</p>

<p>you like. &raquo; I started my career as a</p>
<p>historian. Game development was never a</p>
<p>plan. But then games came into my</p>
<p>life, and I decided to combine history and entertainment to</p>
<p>touch people&rsquo;s heart. Our first game, Arida, is</p>
<p>influenced by a conflict that happened in Canudos, the</p>
<p>backlands of Bahia, in the 19th century.</p>
<p>I think the game could be a good way to make this memorable for</p>
<p>many generations. &raquo; You can only imagine how</p>
<p>liberated I feel, no longer being defined by my stutter.</p>
<p>It was only when I realized that with the right tools, with the</p>
<p>right training, stuttering is something that I could control.</p>

<p>and then maybe we can help other people as well.</p>

<p>CHLOE CONDON: Hi. Him Chloe.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I&rsquo;m Craig, and we&rsquo;re super excited to introduce you</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>to I/O Flip, a classic card game with a modern AI twist, powered</p>
<p>by Google, built for I/O and featuring a number of our</p>
<p>favorite products. &raquo; We just released it</p>
<p>yesterday, and a lot of you have already checked it out at</p>
<p>flip.with Google.com. If you haven&rsquo;t, make sure you</p>
<p>do. For now, we are here to give you</p>
<p>a real-time demo and details about some of the tech we used</p>
<p>like Flutter, Firebase and Google Cloud.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to stay tuned for the developer keynote coming up</p>
<p>after this to see how the game was made.</p>
<p>For this demo, Chloe and I, well, we happen to know the</p>
<p>folks that made this game. Hey, Filippo team, so we&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to play against each other just for today, and the winner gets</p>
<p>to take home that trophy right over there.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow! &raquo; I know the perfect place for</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>that trophy. &raquo; Chloe, how do you know what</p>
<p>my trophy case looks like? &raquo; Okay.</p>
<p>So to get started on I/O Flip, you get to build your own team,</p>
<p>customizing your cards with classes and special powers along</p>
<p>the way, and there are some extra bonuses that add to your</p>
<p>strength, like holographic cards and elemental powers, more on</p>
<p>those later. You win when your cards are more</p>
<p>powerful than your opponent&rsquo;s cards.</p>
<p>All right, Craig. We&rsquo;re going to try this out on</p>
<p>our new Pixel 7as right here. Are you ready to open a pack and</p>
<p>start building our teams? &raquo; Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s play I/O Flip. [Bell dinging].</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay. First we&rsquo;re going to build an AI</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>design pack of cards featuring some of our beloved Google</p>
<p>characters. Dash, Sparky, Android and Dino.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re going to assign them special powers and see what we</p>
<p>get. Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>What do I want for my team? Ooh, I&rsquo;m going to go with Fairy,</p>
<p>because an army of pixies sounds like a crew that I want to hang</p>
<p>out with. And let&rsquo;s see, for my special</p>
<p>power, I&rsquo;m going to choose break dancing because nothing is more</p>
<p>powerful than the power of tats. &raquo; Hmmm.</p>
<p>All right. Well, I&rsquo;ve chosen Pirate as my</p>
<p>class, and Chloe, you do know how to tell if someone&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pirate, right? Well, they&rsquo;re always talking</p>
<p>about plunder. All right.</p>
<p>So now I need a special power. Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Astro Astrology.</p>
<p>Only that had been astronomy, the pirates might have actually</p>
<p>been able to use it. Let&rsquo;s see, break dancing</p>
<p>pirates. What is this, pirates of</p>
<p>Penzance? Oh, fake crying!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good. Be careful, Chloe.</p>
<p>My parts are also good at emotional manipulation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never seen a guilt trip they wouldn&rsquo;t take.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fake crying. Huh.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that I had a super power.</p>
<p>We each get 12 cards in a pack, and from here we&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>swipe through and strategize and decide which three we think will</p>
<p>be our strongest competitors. Those three become our teams,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the cards that will compete with our opponent&rsquo;s</p>
<p>team. &raquo; Ooh, here&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>description. Sparky the pirate fake cries to</p>
<p>get out of trouble, but he always laughs it off.</p>
<p>Pretty childish, Sparky, but hopefully pretty good flavor</p>
<p>text. Now, MakerSuite helped us</p>
<p>prototype all of those prompts, and then the PaLM API generated</p>
<p>thousands of unique descriptions for all these cards.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And those animations are silky smooth with Flutter.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And what&rsquo;s even cooler is because those animations are</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>powered by code, they&rsquo;re really flexible, and because all of</p>
<p>this is made in Flutter, we don&rsquo;t only have a Web app here,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re most of the way toward a mobile app on Android and iOS as</p>
<p>well. &raquo; And all the images were</p>
<p>created with Google AI tools. We&rsquo;re committed to using AI</p>
<p>responsibly here at Google, so we collaborated with artists to</p>
<p>train our AI models which then generated the thousands of</p>
<p>images that you see in I/O Flip. &raquo; All the game play</p>
<p>communication like match making and results was easy to</p>
<p>implement with fire store, and with Cloud Run we&rsquo;re able to</p>
<p>deploy and scale our all dart back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. I/O Flip is full stack Dart.</p>
<p>Okay, Chloe, I think it&rsquo;s time to flip.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay. Now, this is a fast-paced game.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Things happen pretty quickly, so pay attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay. We&rsquo;re in.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay. I&rsquo;ve got my card.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>All right, fairies, let&rsquo;s break dance.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All right, pirates. Yar.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay. Moment of truth here.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! &raquo; Oh!</p>
<p>And your water elemental power further beating my fire, as if</p>
<p>you even needed it. Okay.</p>
<p>Round two, pressure&rsquo;s on. I think I&rsquo;ve got a winner.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see about that. Right into my trap.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, these are &ndash; these are real tears, Chloe.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That is my lowest card. &raquo; Woo-hoo!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is for all the marbles. &raquo; I feel good about this one.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to get that trophy.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh! Fire is about to get your metal!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But not enough! Chloe!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve taken it! Agh!</p>
<p>Well-played, Chloe. I suppose if anyone deserved</p>
<p>that trophy other than me, it would be you.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Craig. Once again, the power of dance</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>prevails. Super fun, super easy to play.</p>
<p>I love being able to customize my cards and characters and I</p>
<p>can play quick games if I&rsquo;m short on time, or I can play</p>
<p>again to extend my winning streak.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Want to play I/O Flip yourself?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Go to flip.withgoogle.com to play on your laptop, desktop or</p>
<p>mobile device. &raquo; Thanks for hanging out with</p>
<p>us and checking out I/O Flip, and you can learn more about the</p>
<p>AI technology actually used to make the game and so much more</p>
<p>coming up next in the developer keynote.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>See you there!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Ten. Nine.</p>
<p>Eight. Seven.</p>
<p>Six. Five.</p>
<p>Four. Three.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>On</p>
