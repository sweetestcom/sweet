    <p>Hi everyone, I&rsquo;m fresh off of bawling my fucking eyes out.</p>
<p>I finally stopped because I turned off Rufus Dussault.</p>
<p>I just had him in the background just like serenading me and all my Pisces placements,</p>
<p>just crying my fucking eyes out.</p>
<p>But I just had a really good conversation with my dad who I never really talk deep to.</p>
<p>You know dads, you just don&rsquo;t fucking get into certain shit.</p>
<p>I want to share something that he told me and then we&rsquo;re going to get into my whole</p>
<p>EDC trip because bitch, you got to fucking buckle your seatbelt for that one because</p>
<p>there was a lot of realizations that came from EDC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my first rave, my first festival, we&rsquo;re going to get all into that.</p>
<p>So the biggest thing that made me fucking boohoo like a toddler, he told me if everything</p>
<p>went bad and the world was ending and he had to walk through shit with somebody, he would</p>
<p>choose me.</p>
<p>And that like meant so much to me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think that he had ever seen me for me and I&rsquo;ve been really struggling with believing</p>
<p>that people see my value.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been struggling with feeling useful to others and like worth a fuck, really.</p>
<p>So that just like validated the absolute fuck out of everything I&rsquo;ve been insecure about.</p>
<p>And it made me feel really, really good and I boohooed like a little bitch about it because</p>
<p>I think it was like really deep.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to flip this into something that everybody can learn from.</p>
<p>So you just got to look through life and find the person that you would walk through shit</p>
<p>with or find the person that would want to walk through shit with you.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the person that&rsquo;s going to see you and see you fully and appreciate you</p>
<p>fully and see your strengths and your weaknesses and not be scared by your weaknesses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to see your strengths and be like, yes, this is someone that I want with</p>
<p>me because I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s other people that look at me and like, ew, I would never</p>
<p>like want to like Leo would not, I don&rsquo;t know who the fuck would look at me and think Leo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the person I would call if I needed help.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure there are people out there that think that that don&rsquo;t know me.</p>
<p>But the people that do know me know I&rsquo;m the motherfucker to call.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a matter of finding the people that know you&rsquo;re the one to call.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re capable of meeting needs for people, you&rsquo;re important to people, you just have</p>
<p>to find the people you&rsquo;re important to.</p>
<p>You have to find the people with the needs that you meet, and the people that can realize</p>
<p>your value.</p>
<p>And that also ties into like, it takes someone of value to realize someone else&rsquo;s value.</p>
<p>But we could do a whole fucking like episode on value because shit, that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to cry no more.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So another thing my dad said to me is, he knows in his heart that I&rsquo;m going to be successful.</p>
<p>And I feel like he&rsquo;s been watching me struggle so much, and especially with this app, this</p>
<p>fucking goddamn app that I&rsquo;m so frustrated with right now.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve put so much time and money and effort into it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in the middle of making really big changes to it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s taking up a lot of my fucking time.</p>
<p>And for him to like, see that I&rsquo;m struggling, and say he believes in me like God like it</p>
<p>just felt so good.</p>
<p>All the feel good feelings, bitch, like, oh my god, they were hitting me.</p>
<p>Because I feel like I&rsquo;m going to be successful.</p>
<p>I just feel it in me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be successful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a mindfuck.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a battle with myself when I feel it, I feel that I&rsquo;m meant to be successful</p>
<p>and to do something big and to help people and like, do some like, Leo type shit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not happening on the outside.</p>
<p>Like when you feel something internally, and it&rsquo;s not reflecting externally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the biggest fucking gaslight, in my opinion, like my real my life is gaslighting me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it fucking feels.</p>
<p>But him saying that just made me feel like, okay, someone else sees it, someone else feels</p>
<p>what I feel.</p>
<p>It just felt really good.</p>
<p>So moral of the story, validate people, motherfucking see people voice your appreciation of them</p>
<p>to them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna say this shit out loud, because I was on the verge of goddamn losing it today.</p>
<p>And like him saying that really just like, turned it around for me.</p>
<p>So you never know when someone&rsquo;s struggling, because I don&rsquo;t let people know.</p>
<p>So please, if you feel drawn to like, tell somebody how great they are, tell them, because</p>
<p>you never know.</p>
<p>Okay, now let&rsquo;s get into EDC because this was some shit.</p>
<p>All right, like it was the best time of my life.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know what to expect.</p>
<p>And it was better than my wildest dreams.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way I can describe it.</p>
<p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s all I got for you.</p>
<p>No, it was my first festival.</p>
<p>Like I said, it was my first rave of any kind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently gotten into EDM music.</p>
<p>And that shit rocked my socks off.</p>
<p>The people I went with were like friends, but like they were like, acquaintance-y friends.</p>
<p>Like we were, we weren&rsquo;t close, but like we was friends.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.</p>
<p>We were like going out friends and like spending the weekend with those friends made us tight.</p>
<p>And I feel like I am bonded to them.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t feel the same way, that&rsquo;s a problem because because I get attached to</p>
<p>people and if you don&rsquo;t get attached to me back, I&rsquo;m pissed off.</p>
<p>But I was introduced to two other friends through my other friends that I went with.</p>
<p>And these two bitches are like, oh my god, like we&rsquo;re all besties for the resty now.</p>
<p>Like I swear to God, the way that this group clicked, it could not have gone any better.</p>
<p>Everybody was so fucking cute.</p>
<p>Everybody was self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Everybody was like mature.</p>
<p>And what I mean by mature is like, we could handle our fucking self.</p>
<p>I know I sound like I&rsquo;m wheezing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been sick.</p>
<p>Leave me alone.</p>
<p>But the podcast needs to be done, bitch.</p>
<p>I committed to Sundays.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>I just needed to express my gratitude for this fucking group and this whole experience</p>
<p>before I get into telling you my realizations that I had.</p>
<p>Okay, so I, in the wise words of Lana Del Rey, was pushing past the limits, tripping</p>
<p>on hallucinogenics for three days straight.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re bound to have some motherfucking realizations because your brain and your soul</p>
<p>be like buttfucking.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like getting downloads from the universe and all the other things.</p>
<p>I mean, you might be just making shit up because some things are a little like meh, but I realized</p>
<p>the whole bunch.</p>
<p>My sexual ass was eating it up.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with the first day.</p>
<p>So the set that we were seeing was said the sky but say my name came on right before them.</p>
<p>So they did their set and then say my name came on.</p>
<p>And when I tell you I motherfucking boo hoode ugly cried for I shit you not an hour.</p>
<p>It was like half of each set.</p>
<p>I was fucking rubber band mouth fucking like ugly fucking crying in the crowd.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t let that stop me.</p>
<p>I was still singing.</p>
<p>I was still fist bumping.</p>
<p>I was still dancing.</p>
<p>Give a fuck what I look like, bitch.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look at me.</p>
<p>I was having a time of my life.</p>
<p>It just felt so good to let it out.</p>
<p>Like I just let that shit out and I let the tears fall.</p>
<p>And it was just a great beautiful moment for me.</p>
<p>Okay, so the realization that triggered me to cry.</p>
<p>There was two things kind of so like the first part that triggered me to start crying</p>
<p>initially was my own personal shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna tell nobody.</p>
<p>All right, leave me alone.</p>
<p>You could you like crying for an hour?</p>
<p>Like I said, like that&rsquo;s excessive, you know, like, what the fuck were you crying for an</p>
<p>hour to do, baby.</p>
<p>So I start crying because of the first thing.</p>
<p>And then like, I guess being in the emotionally receptive state I was in the universe threw</p>
<p>me a fucking realization.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what made me cry for another like 30 minutes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna start real broad.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So guys, the motive behind every action a human being takes is simply to feel better.</p>
<p>Now, don&rsquo;t fight me on that because I know how you girls like to tussle about your technicalities.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up and just take that in for a second.</p>
<p>If you look at every single action a human being takes, we take it to feel better.</p>
<p>At the base, any fucking action, we think it&rsquo;s going to make us feel better.</p>
<p>So I had this overwhelming sense like looking out in this crowd of people 300,000 people</p>
<p>were at this fucking rave, dude.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve I don&rsquo;t even know that many people exist.</p>
<p>Like I see it on social media.</p>
<p>I see the numbers but like I didn&rsquo;t realize that&rsquo;s like a thing.</p>
<p>Like I was like, this is the whole United States here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand numbers and population or geography, but that&rsquo;s separate.</p>
<p>To see all these people like in one place, like that many human beings, damn y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>So like I look, I was looking out backwards, like in the crowd because we were kind of</p>
<p>close to the stage and people were like, it would go back as far as I could see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tall y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>So I could see like real far and I could see back to a certain extent and I thought the</p>
<p>people ended, but I just couldn&rsquo;t see past it.</p>
<p>So my ugly ass is sitting here thinking, oh, this is just how many people is that this</p>
<p>one stage?</p>
<p>No, because I saw an aerial bird&rsquo;s eye view on the Instagram of EDC later on, bitch, when</p>
<p>I tell you there was so many fucking people, if I would have known there was that many</p>
<p>people there, while I was there, I had a panic attack and died right there on the spot.</p>
<p>Because it was literally a sea of people.</p>
<p>Like once I realized, oh my god, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to move once I see the amount</p>
<p>of people there.</p>
<p>I would have lost my shit.</p>
<p>But anyway, back to the realization head ass, why are you getting all off topic?</p>
<p>So I look back in the crowd of people, and I just start seeing all these just genuine</p>
<p>little like, kids, like little souls, like just little innocent little like people like</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s motive is just to feel better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I know people do fucked up shit.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no excuse for it.</p>
<p>But like, the intention for everybody is so pure, like everybody just wants to feel better.</p>
<p>And it like immediately in that moment, all my judgment of people was like lifted off</p>
<p>of me.</p>
<p>And I can explain it like it lifted off because that&rsquo;s how it felt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everything just like lifted up.</p>
<p>And the whole crowd was like, bare, not naked, but like everybody&rsquo;s facade and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bullshit and everybody&rsquo;s like, way they want to be perceived and everything was like lifted</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>And you could see the true intention of everybody was just to be loved and accepted and to feel</p>
<p>better.</p>
<p>Because everybody at that rave is looking to escape their fucking life and go have fun.</p>
<p>Why are we at the rave to feel better?</p>
<p>Like just seeing everyone so genuine and like pure.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s motives were just there like, in front of me, it was the coolest fucking</p>
<p>thing to experience.</p>
<p>And it was just so nice.</p>
<p>And it was such a relief because I instantly felt connected to every single human being</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>And then I started thinking about every other human being in the world.</p>
<p>And I was like, Nope, too much.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna reel it in.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just gonna focus on this crowd.</p>
<p>So I was like, I felt connected to everybody because I can relate to that we&rsquo;re all doing</p>
<p>the same shit.</p>
<p>Okay, so now let&rsquo;s get a little bit deeper.</p>
<p>When it comes to the judgments that I said were lifted, they were lifted because I realized</p>
<p>every single person is lost.</p>
<p>Every single person, if our motive is just to feel better, everybody is doing what they</p>
<p>think will make them feel better.</p>
<p>Because nobody actually fucking knows.</p>
<p>So for example, we see shit on social media, we see someone that is successful, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>rich, okay.</p>
<p>And they seem happy, they paint the image that they&rsquo;re happy.</p>
<p>So we look at that and we&rsquo;re like, Oh my god.</p>
<p>So being rich is what&rsquo;s gonna make us happy.</p>
<p>I mean, bitch, it sure as fuck will, it sure as fuck would me.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m talking about this.</p>
<p>But just my example that just popped in my head.</p>
<p>We see someone portray the image that money is what made them happy.</p>
<p>So now we all start looking to achieve this, we&rsquo;re like, Oh my god, they found the secret.</p>
<p>Oh my god, that&rsquo;s gonna make me feel better.</p>
<p>I need to do that.</p>
<p>I need to find that I need to make that I need to figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna make me happy.</p>
<p>And then people start trying to do that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just about money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about everything.</p>
<p>Anything that we see, make someone else happy.</p>
<p>We subconsciously are like, Oh my god, you get excited, you want to do that you want</p>
<p>to try that.</p>
<p>Now, your beliefs and shit could hold you back from that you might have negative associations</p>
<p>with certain things that can hold you back.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an idea for two seconds, that we&rsquo;re all just lost little children running</p>
<p>around trying to fucking feel better.</p>
<p>None of us know what to do.</p>
<p>None of us have it figured out.</p>
<p>We are all just trying and modeling after each other how to get it.</p>
<p>But the thing is, every single person is different.</p>
<p>We all have different wants and needs.</p>
<p>So happiness looks different for all of us.</p>
<p>Because going to a rave made me happy as a motherfucker, somebody else would have a goddamn</p>
<p>anxiety attack and would have lost their shit.</p>
<p>And there was such a relief that came with that.</p>
<p>Like once I realized, nobody has it figured out.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re all just trying our best.</p>
<p>We all have this same little intention and it&rsquo;s so cute and it&rsquo;s so like sweet, our little</p>
<p>intention of like, I just want to feel better.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s just what it is.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all just trying to achieve that in some way or another.</p>
<p>And then you start looking at the ways people do that and you realize, well, you can&rsquo;t blame</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s all they were taught.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they were shown was happiness.</p>
<p>Like, I thought for a long time, designer clothes and expensive shit would make you</p>
<p>happy because that&rsquo;s what I saw on social media.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the people around me thought too.</p>
<p>So why would I not mirror that if you&rsquo;re told this is what should do it?</p>
<p>Oh, fuck it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try it.</p>
<p>And then some people don&rsquo;t ever make it out of their coping mechanism.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t ever make it out or realize that what they&rsquo;re trying to do to gain happiness</p>
<p>is not actually it.</p>
<p>They just keep going for more and more and more.</p>
<p>I luckily woke up and I am going to do an entire episode about designer clothing and</p>
<p>buying expensive shit because that is something I never thought I would have been able to</p>
<p>break out of.</p>
<p>And I broke the fuck out of it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to be its own thing.</p>
<p>But that was just the example.</p>
<p>So I saw some guy at the rave in a full Prada outfit.</p>
<p>Like it was like an astronaut fit.</p>
<p>It was silver.</p>
<p>Like it was sick as fuck.</p>
<p>But like I was looking at him and I was like, Oh my God, like he looks good.</p>
<p>Like he looks cute.</p>
<p>And like he had the perfect hair, the perfect teeth, the perfect skin.</p>
<p>I was like, goddamn.</p>
<p>So I went up to him and I was like, yo, I was like, you look so fucking good.</p>
<p>I was like, is that a full Prada fit?</p>
<p>And he was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And I was like, damn.</p>
<p>I was like, you ballsy as shit wearing that here.</p>
<p>I was like, you look good though.</p>
<p>Keep doing it.</p>
<p>And then I walked off.</p>
<p>I kept doing my thing.</p>
<p>Like I just, I like to drop compliments and leave, you know, or I&rsquo;ll compliment them as</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m walking by.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no chance for it to be awkward.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need a response.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to thank you.</p>
<p>Like I just want to appreciate you out loud and let you know you look fucking good as</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making my way by.</p>
<p>But the reason I&rsquo;m using this boy as my example in the Prada fit is because some people look</p>
<p>at other people in designer clothes and think, oh my God, what a fucking stuck up asshole.</p>
<p>What a waste of fucking money.</p>
<p>What a loser.</p>
<p>How out of touch can you be?</p>
<p>Like people have really harsh judgments of people in designer clothing.</p>
<p>I used to be one of the people in designer clothing, so I know how like they get judged.</p>
<p>But the point of me using the boy in the Prada fit as an example is because with this realization</p>
<p>I had, I saw the intention.</p>
<p>His intention with wearing these clothes was to make him feel better.</p>
<p>Whatever reason it may be to prove his importance, to make him feel more confident, whatever</p>
<p>he thought it was going to do, he thought it was going to make him feel better.</p>
<p>I used to be the same way, but I&rsquo;m somebody now that I look at people that are fully perfect</p>
<p>hair, perfect skin, perfect nails, perfect shoes, perfect outfit.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s expensive.</p>
<p>How stiff they are and how uncomfortable they are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in your head the entire time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to ruin your shit.</p>
<p>How do I look?</p>
<p>Are people looking at me?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re in your head the whole time and it kind of pulls you out of whatever experience</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having when you&rsquo;re worried about fucking up your outfit or fucking up your hair or</p>
<p>making sure your makeup looks okay.</p>
<p>Like these people are putting their self through this because they think it&rsquo;s what will make</p>
<p>them happy.</p>
<p>The social media paints the fucking picture of you need to fucking have perfect hair,</p>
<p>perfect outfit, perfect nails.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to have all this shit and look together and perfect at every moment</p>
<p>and there is no room for error.</p>
<p>So these people try to mirror that and they try to be that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the expectation they hold for themselves.</p>
<p>So being out in public when this boy in his fucking outfit with his perfect makeup and</p>
<p>his hair and his Prada outfit, yeah, he&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolute fuck.</p>
<p>He is so uncomfortable and you can see it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s worried about who&rsquo;s looking at him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making sure his outfit&rsquo;s okay and no one spilled anything on it or he didn&rsquo;t rip</p>
<p>it or he didn&rsquo;t fuck up his fucking $5,000 outfit, however much it was, but it probably</p>
<p>was like around five grand cause he had the little necklace too.</p>
<p>But him dressing like this and wearing this is because he thinks it will make him feel</p>
<p>better.</p>
<p>He thinks enduring being uncomfortable will make him feel better.</p>
<p>So some people that are jealous or mad or whatever it may be, they&rsquo;re looking at him</p>
<p>and judging him like he&rsquo;s a fucking stuck up asshole when in reality he&rsquo;s just trying</p>
<p>to feel better.</p>
<p>And once you see that intention, once you&rsquo;re aware of everyone&rsquo;s intention is just to feel</p>
<p>better, the judgment falls away.</p>
<p>It like dissolves.</p>
<p>You realize that you can kind of see through it.</p>
<p>It becomes transparent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fucking word.</p>
<p>Like you can see through and like peek behind the curtain into everyone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad when you start to wake up and you see people still doing this shit because</p>
<p>I was this motherfucker for so many years.</p>
<p>I was him.</p>
<p>I were, I was these people that were trying to be perfect and dress in nice clothes and</p>
<p>nice shit just so I can feel worth a fuck.</p>
<p>But like with that situation, if that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve been told, how would they know any</p>
<p>different?</p>
<p>How would they know to not seek designer clothing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve been told.</p>
<p>Like why would they?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like expecting someone to know the fucking answer is ridiculous.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t really judge them for how they try and find their happiness.</p>
<p>And a lot of the times with people that are really successful, a lot of people judge them</p>
<p>and think they&rsquo;re stuck up in their assholes and they think they&rsquo;re better than everyone.</p>
<p>Half of them are not half of them are so cripplingly insecure that you have no fucking clue.</p>
<p>Some of them are fucking obnoxious assholes.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>You really never know.</p>
<p>But even the intention behind them is just to try and feel better too.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re just the ones that are loudly trying to voice their worth and put it in</p>
<p>your face when they&rsquo;re bragging.</p>
<p>But the ones that are quietly wearing like designer shit are like, look, I promise I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>important and I&rsquo;m not making fun of these people by any means because I get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to share that the intention behind everyone is just to feel better.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>To take it one step deeper.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s intention is to feel better, right?</p>
<p>We covered that.</p>
<p>No one knows the fucking answer, but we&rsquo;re all seeking the experience of feeling better.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>This is step three, bitch.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fucking get it wrong.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the third realization.</p>
<p>You cannot get this life wrong.</p>
<p>Every single person&rsquo;s experience and definition of what happy is for them is different.</p>
<p>No one fucking knows what you&rsquo;re meant to do.</p>
<p>There is no cheat sheet.</p>
<p>There is no nothing.</p>
<p>Your life is to experience your version of happy.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you try 50 different things and they&rsquo;re not it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That ain&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re at 50 steps closer in the right direction of what is going to make you happy.</p>
<p>You learn by contrast.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you experience something you don&rsquo;t like, you find something you do like,</p>
<p>you just flip it.</p>
<p>But that was such a huge relief for me is to realize you can&rsquo;t fuck up.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get it wrong.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s definition of happiness is wrong.</p>
<p>If it works for them, it&rsquo;s theirs.</p>
<p>They can have that.</p>
<p>If something makes someone feel better, that&rsquo;s theirs.</p>
<p>And there is no one thing you&rsquo;re meant to find.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s one thing like this whole idea of fucking soulmates and shit.</p>
<p>Eat my ass.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What kind of sick fucking game is that?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to throw two people on earth, make them be soulmates, but we&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to put them near each other.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just going to have to figure it out and find each other.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t find each other, they die.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Leave me alone with that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Same thing with like desire and trying to feel better.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s just one way to do it for every person.</p>
<p>I think every person has their own ways of doing it.</p>
<p>You just have to experience things and find them.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re always going to change.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like, oh, you&rsquo;re working toward this one goal.</p>
<p>You find it and you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You win.</p>
<p>You beat life.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re always changing because you&rsquo;re always becoming aware of new things.</p>
<p>And once you have a desire for something and you reach it, you&rsquo;re going to get a desire</p>
<p>for something else.</p>
<p>And then you get to follow that like it&rsquo;s a never ending search of feeling better and</p>
<p>feeling better and feeling better and it will happen.</p>
<p>And everything you experience is to lead you into the direction of what&rsquo;s going to make</p>
<p>you feel better.</p>
<p>You have new awareness of what&rsquo;s going to make you feel better than you currently do.</p>
<p>Like that one blew my fucking brain apart.</p>
<p>Your life is about discovering yourself.</p>
<p>Discovering what makes you happy and makes you feel better.</p>
<p>And if you know something you don&rsquo;t like, you know a fucking direction not to go.</p>
<p>I know it sounds so simple and I&rsquo;m making it seem like it is simple, but it is simple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m someone that overthinks everything as you can tell if you&rsquo;ve made it this far in</p>
<p>this podcast or if you listen to any of my other episodes, I&rsquo;d be overthinking the fuck</p>
<p>out of everything you could put in front of me.</p>
<p>And that really bites me in the ass sometimes because when things are simple, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just simple.</p>
<p>Like I will overanalyze it and make it difficult.</p>
<p>Like just let it be simple.</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t do that though.</p>
<p>But this is one of the things I do just have to let be simple and accept for what it is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that you can&rsquo;t get this life wrong.</p>
<p>And the intention of every single person is just to feel better.</p>
<p>So stop fucking judging everybody so goddamn hard y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>I highly recommend going to EDC.</p>
<p>I will be going every year now.</p>
<p>Like I went once and now I&rsquo;m addicted.</p>
<p>I only talked about in this episode, the realizations I had and how like great they were.</p>
<p>Those were just a speck of what made my experience so great.</p>
<p>The everything about EDC was great.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t, what the fuck other word is there besides great?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my synonyms?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my fucking thesaurus?</p>
<p>I need to look some shit up.</p>
<p>I need to find another word besides great, but there&rsquo;s no word to really encapsulate</p>
<p>what that whole experience was for me.</p>
<p>But every element of it, there was so much more to it than just, Oh, you fucking tripped</p>
<p>and had realizations like no bitch.</p>
<p>There was so much more to it.</p>
<p>The people that I met, like how fucking full my heart was, my whole perception of myself</p>
<p>has changed.</p>
<p>My whole perception of my body, my opinion of my body, the way that I look at myself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all changed.</p>
<p>I feel like I saw myself for the first time, girl, I sound real dramatic, but it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fucking truth.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So my recommendation is save whatever money you have to save.</p>
<p>Go do what you got to do.</p>
<p>Get your ass to an EDC if it ever comes near you or fucking go bitch, because we had to</p>
<p>drive six hours, like literally go.</p>
<p>I will be going every year for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I will be that old 60 year old man that is still out raving like a motherfucker.</p>
<p>Watch me like that experience was just so unforgettable and life changing for so many</p>
<p>reasons and the realizations were just one.</p>
<p>So if you ever get the opportunity to go, go, go live it up.</p>
<p>Go have fun.</p>
<p>Go enjoy your fucking life and find what makes you feel better.</p>
<p>It might just be EDC because bitch, it sure as shit was for me.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I will talk to you guys in episode four next week.</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
