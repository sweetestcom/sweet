<p>fascinating question manoa you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>with dr byrd</p>
<p>hello nice to meet you thank you so much</p>
<p>for you the word you do</p>
<p>sure i&rsquo;m from chile i&rsquo;m not a narrative</p>
<p>speaker of english language</p>
<p>the question is</p>
<p>i have anxiety i have adrenal issues</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>anxiety and of course insulin resistance</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i really deal with the problem that i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>a good quality of supplement to give a</p>
<p>really good support to my adrenals and i</p>
<p>had to deal with a lot of stress</p>
<p>what can i do</p>
<p>through the diet</p>
<p>to make sure that i&rsquo;m giving a good</p>
<p>support to my adrenals and keep the</p>
<p>anxiety under control</p>
<p>what what country are you from</p>
<p>chile chile okay</p>
<p>um i would imagine i would imagine they</p>
<p>have farmers markets there is that</p>
<p>correct</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>and i would imagine that um you have</p>
<p>some really good soils in south america</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s like some</p>
<p>some really good soils to grow really</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>food um</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>you know some of the key herbs that i</p>
<p>would recommend you grow and make your</p>
<p>own tea and maybe you could find them</p>
<p>because the problem here&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>when you buy</p>
<p>herbs that are good for adrenals like</p>
<p>adaptogens and things like that like</p>
<p>ashwagandha</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to know where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting it from and the soil with</p>
<p>the soil is the key</p>
<p>and so you don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>you know you have to find some local</p>
<p>farmers that grow ashwagandha and</p>
<p>ashwagandha is a really good adaptogen</p>
<p>it can help</p>
<p>calm your adrenals the other thing that</p>
<p>you definitely need to get is</p>
<p>nutritional yeast for the b1 the vitamin</p>
<p>b1</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>try to find a non-fortified one because</p>
<p>they make them with</p>
<p>synthetic</p>
<p>petroleum</p>
<p>products i mean</p>
<p>a lot of people don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>99 of all the b vitamins sold um</p>
<p>are sold by companies like dow chemical</p>
<p>company they make these synthetic</p>
<p>vitamins</p>
<p>chemically and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting and then they fortify it with</p>
<p>the nutritional yeast which you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really need to do that</p>
<p>and then if you took nutritional yeast</p>
<p>on a regular basis and maybe drank and</p>
<p>make drink on ashwagandha tea you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to feel</p>
<p>calmer you&rsquo;re going to feel like you can</p>
<p>tolerate more stress</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>start watching the videos that i have on</p>
<p>stress you know better sleep um</p>
<p>keeping your diet uh correct so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not doing too many carbs and um</p>
<p>also doing the intermittent fasting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things you can do with</p>
<p>stress but um</p>
<p>you want to get your body to a state</p>
<p>where you can tolerate</p>
<p>babysitting like maybe nine small</p>
<p>children in a room for about eight hours</p>
<p>then we know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>being able to drive behind okay very</p>
<p>slow driver for</p>
<p>for about four hours then we know you</p>
<p>can tolerate stress</p>
<p>okay yeah</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m doing a nutritional gist</p>
<p>actually i&rsquo;m taking your course and</p>
<p>keto and iaf i&rsquo;m starting the course and</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ll take your recommendations</p>
<p>because i really need them thank you so</p>
<p>much yeah you&rsquo;re welcome great and good</p>
<p>luck to you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well i tell you what</p>
<p>noah i&rsquo;m a great advocate of the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast so keep it up and all</p>
<p>those other great things and you feel</p>
<p>like a million bucks according to me</p>
<p>so anyway uh here&rsquo;s some fun stuff for</p>
<p>everybody dr berg why don&rsquo;t we kick off</p>
<p>the first quiz question and there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>interesting ones today and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first one</p>
<p>okay so the first question is what</p>
<p>percentage</p>
<p>of meat is water</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>so you eat the steak</p>
<p>what percentage that it actually is</p>
<p>water take a wild guess that&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>this will surprise you yeah it&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>us mad too because you spend 30 dollars</p>
<p>for one of those things these days and</p>
<p>if you tell me it&rsquo;s all water i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>be very sad feel cheated anyway that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the first question folks and why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go to social media don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>ignore them and zane from youtube</p>
<p>is required to take my meds three times</p>
<p>a day doesn&rsquo;t mention what they are but</p>
<p>how can i do that if i am uh fasting</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>um i would take them anyway um</p>
<p>do you always have to take things with</p>
<p>meals no not necessarily would it be</p>
<p>best maybe</p>
<p>but i would try to do it on empty</p>
<p>stomach and</p>
<p>um and not worry about it too much</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>i mean i will say if you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about medication and drugs maybe maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s toxic to your stomach and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re telling you to have a meal</p>
<p>in which case you got a problem because</p>
<p>um most medications you don&rsquo;t to take</p>
<p>three times a day unless it&rsquo;s for a</p>
<p>specific reason but it would be very</p>
<p>helpful to know what kind of medication</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about and also</p>
<p>to know why you&rsquo;re taking it so we can</p>
<p>give you another solution so you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>dependent on those medications for the</p>
<p>rest of your life</p>
<p>and you know the whole viewpoint the</p>
<p>medical community is like</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not coming off these</p>
<p>medications it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>well what what that doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>to me so</p>
<p>especially with psychiatric drugs like</p>
<p>once you start i&rsquo;m like is there a plan</p>
<p>to come off the problem is you start</p>
<p>becoming used to it now it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to come off</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like that situation</p>
<p>well good for you well anyway that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good start and maybe he can have his</p>
<p>doctor wean him off of those and boy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many stories about that here</p>
<p>on your channel dr berg where people go</p>
<p>back and the doctor goes shazam you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need such and watch you know your</p>
<p>a1c and all sugar all this stuff is</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s really exciting stuff</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s look here sophia yeah also on</p>
<p>youtube i have to take warfarin during a</p>
<p>valve implant i am restricted from</p>
<p>vitamin k foods should i start a keto</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>you should and you should just</p>
<p>do the vegetables uh low vitamin k i</p>
<p>mean i have a video on that if you um</p>
<p>just do the keto and then instead of</p>
<p>doing leafy greens you&rsquo;re gonna do like</p>
<p>a squash</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>other things that have other vegetables</p>
<p>that have low vitamin k1 so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>hard to do</p>
<p>you just need to get the list</p>
<p>and if you just</p>
<p>just type</p>
<p>google like</p>
<p>pdf um list of foods low vitamin k1 and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be right there and you focus on</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be very beneficial</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific let me see do</p>
<p>we have any answers yet</p>
<p>um we don&rsquo;t but we do have</p>
<p>an indication of how much people around</p>
<p>the world love the show and here&rsquo;s who</p>
<p>is watching us this morning people from</p>

<p>cyprus ireland hungary</p>
<p>ghana malaysia taiwan uh thailand uh</p>

<p>chile and we have already had manoa on</p>
<p>from chile representing the country very</p>
<p>well sweden puerto rico norway and all</p>
<p>across these united states of america</p>
<p>so thanks everybody around the world</p>
<p>including those in the green room for</p>
<p>tuning in to the dr berg show every</p>
<p>friday at 11 00</p>
<p>a.m east eastern time and let&rsquo;s see wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome yeah it really is let me</p>
<p>see uh what else we have uh from terry i</p>
<p>tell why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>uh oh here we go this is what i was</p>
<p>waiting for audience the answers to quiz</p>
<p>question number one and the quiz</p>
<p>question number one asked</p>
<p>what percentage of meat is water</p>
<p>and the audience responded 55 of them</p>
<p>say 75</p>
<p>40 say higher than 55 percent and 5 say</p>
<p>less than 55 percent</p>
<p>any close uh numbers there doubt well</p>
<p>i would imagine no one looked that up</p>
<p>real fast and put the answer down i know</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t do that but if you take a</p>
<p>steak and you just wring it out with the</p>
<p>water</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get 75 of that that meat being</p>
<p>water isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>wild</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not much water in steak 75</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s amazing wow that&rsquo;s mind-blowing</p>
<p>that is so</p>
<p>i mean it is true when you eat celery</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting like it&rsquo;s 95 water but</p>
<p>steak you would think it&rsquo;d be very very</p>
<p>dense</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um now you know you can get your water</p>
<p>by eating more steak well i want a 75</p>
<p>discount then i&rsquo;m going to demand it</p>
<p>next time i&rsquo;m over at the longhorn and</p>
<p>see what they have to say about that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure they&rsquo;ll give it to you oh i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>they will now let&rsquo;s see what else are we</p>
<p>going to do why don&rsquo;t we go back to um</p>
<p>our great lineup and let me see who i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to choose and here&rsquo;s a guy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the movie business david</p>
<p>from of all places burbank california</p>
<p>let me unmute him</p>
<p>and select his shot and david uh you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on with dr burke</p>
<p>david can you hear us</p>
<p>i think david</p>
<p>may be muted somehow let me go to</p>
<p>somebody else here uh here&rsquo;s a uh new</p>
<p>friend of mine his name is julian and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s sort of mobile right now he&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>not on the run he just likes to move</p>
<p>from state to state and julian you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>with dr byrd good morning good morning</p>
<p>dr byrd thank you good morning</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry david hang on just a moment we</p>
<p>lost you can you hear me yes stand by</p>
<p>just a moment david</p>
<p>okay go ahead julian with your question</p>
<p>hey hey i thought we were uh having</p>
<p>internet issues for saying um good</p>
<p>morning uh dr berg my my question for</p>
<p>you is</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m an explorer and</p>
<p>i just went into the whole keto thing</p>
<p>and uh to lower my blood pressure</p>
<p>and then i went for head to every health</p>
<p>benefit i can think of and now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing uh i&rsquo;m currently on a 120 hour</p>
<p>fast and this is my day i will break</p>
<p>that fast in</p>
<p>like four hours</p>
<p>and uh i also combined it with three</p>
<p>days of dry fasting</p>
<p>so wow</p>
<p>yes sir no water for 72 hours</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>my my question for you is i also do</p>
<p>training uh i uh hit training uh four</p>
<p>days a week</p>
<p>and i also walk walk a lot actively i</p>
<p>saw uh practice kung fu i did my horse</p>
<p>sense this morning and uh i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it was a lactic acid but that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole other topic i was just</p>
<p>uh getting through all that and um</p>
<p>my question for you is uh with the</p>
<p>acidity</p>
<p>that we uh build up through the</p>
<p>prolonged fast and i suppose the dry</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>i i don&rsquo;t take any any</p>
<p>minerals during the dry fast since i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not drinking i tried to take potassium</p>
<p>without water and uh i take it from a</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>chloride</p>
<p>and uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very very difficult but but my question</p>
<p>for you is um when when i break my fast</p>
<p>i break it with uh apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>and i remember you mentioning the</p>
<p>acidity and my my concern is um</p>
<p>is the combination of the acid the</p>
<p>acidity buildup</p>
<p>uh the bloating i i no longer drink</p>
<p>water while eating</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>i mean i notice i can eat so much more</p>
<p>when i don&rsquo;t drink any water</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>man my question is super scattered but</p>
<p>but pretty much</p>
<p>i do five uh 120 hour fasts every month</p>
<p>and then when i eat consecutively</p>
<p>days right after that i make sure i do</p>
<p>at least 20 hours of fasting</p>
<p>i also combine dry fasting with</p>
<p>everything though</p>
<p>since i don&rsquo;t um drink water with my</p>
<p>meals</p>
<p>i i drink water uh leading up to the</p>
<p>meal like every hour</p>
<p>and um i suppose my question is when i</p>
<p>drink the water</p>
<p>and without with that kind of fasting</p>
<p>lifestyle i do</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m also every two weeks is a three day</p>
<p>three day fast</p>
<p>and uh a two day fast regular i never</p>
<p>eat mondays or thursdays</p>
<p>um when i when i break my fast it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>apple cider it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a sauerkraut</p>
<p>and apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>diluted in a little thing of water</p>
<p>with uh</p>
<p>with lemon juice and a whole lemon</p>
<p>so julian so this is a this is</p>
<p>interesting you said that because um</p>
<p>first of all you are uh</p>
<p>i can imagine your body is</p>
<p>experiencing some real magical things</p>
<p>happening on the inside with your cells</p>
<p>with going that long and that that much</p>
<p>fasting because it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>your uh your immune system oh my gosh</p>
<p>your brain</p>
<p>your cells the anti-aging there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>sorts of magical things happening</p>
<p>i did a video on this a while ago</p>
<p>one thing you if you do prolong fasting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the time i don&rsquo;t recommend doing</p>
<p>outside of vinegar because what happens</p>
<p>is like that your</p>
<p>your acidity level like your ketones are</p>
<p>so high</p>
<p>when you do prolong fasting your</p>
<p>your ketones go above five you can go</p>
<p>six seven</p>
<p>maybe eight</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s not dangerous unless you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>diabetic so i don&rsquo;t wouldn&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>that but just think about how much acid</p>
<p>is flowing through your body and then</p>
<p>you have the outside of vinegar so</p>
<p>probably what would be better</p>
<p>when you do the prolonged fasting is to</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>once a day you do an eighth of a</p>
<p>teaspoon of baking soda with water</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll just kind of offset things it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not enough to mess up your stomach at</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>maybe you um break the fast with uh</p>
<p>instead of outside of vinegar you do</p>
<p>like a wheatgrass juice powder or um</p>
<p>a vegetable powder just to kind of</p>
<p>alkalize your body a little bit more and</p>
<p>then the sauerkraut is awesome</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s awesome and that won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>too acid and then</p>
<p>then wait wait for an hour or have a</p>
<p>little bit</p>
<p>of food maybe an egg or something wait a</p>
<p>little bit have a little bit more and</p>
<p>really slowly go into this because as</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>things that can happen if you go too</p>
<p>fast and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re not doing carbs</p>
<p>because the carbs are going to</p>
<p>really make um</p>
<p>that can that&rsquo;s the most dangerous thing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing carbs after prolonged</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>and also you&rsquo;re doing dry fasting for</p>
<p>three days which is incredible you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not drinking any water which</p>
<p>it just exaggerates more</p>
<p>benefits or enhances more benefits</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you have some serious discipline that is</p>
<p>awesome and uh i think you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>live a very long life actually so</p>
<p>wow thank you so much for that i um it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard for me to really phrase the</p>
<p>question because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>with the acidity thing i try to bypass</p>
<p>the bloating when i when i refeed but</p>
<p>since i&rsquo;ve gotten into this new</p>
<p>information that yeah you brought up</p>
<p>about uh water and bloating</p>
<p>that it was hilarious to me how i never</p>
<p>noticed it before and when you read it</p>
<p>online they say there&rsquo;s no correlation</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>when i eat i eat</p>
<p>two dozen eggs</p>
<p>on their pasture raised organic and i</p>
<p>also eat a pound of meat</p>
<p>or organic grass-fed</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i noticed for some reason i couldn&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>it anymore i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m pretty sure i</p>
<p>can eat about 5 000 calories</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>my my my assumption was well if i get</p>
<p>more acid hopefully i can get it in</p>
<p>and um one thing i did forget to mention</p>
<p>is i do this for autophagy i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>curious about it and my main purpose in</p>
<p>autophagy</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>the uh i want to see if i can rewire</p>
<p>habits in my brain and see if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>connected to any neural pathways that</p>
<p>can be corrected with uh my purpose for</p>
<p>survival</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i appreciate the information you provide</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like i would love to keep um</p>
<p>updating</p>
<p>you on on things that i&rsquo;m expect because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not finding any uh any</p>
<p>research on this so i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>trying to see what happens</p>
<p>yeah you are the research and so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like</p>
<p>um fasting is like</p>
<p>is a miracle grow for the for the brain</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting all this autophagy</p>
<p>recycling going on with the neurons</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s great great for your brain um</p>
<p>i think yeah carry on and uh good luck</p>
<p>to you thanks for that question you bet</p>
<p>julian anyway thanks that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>after hearing julian&rsquo;s routine i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>throw mine away that&rsquo;s all there is to</p>
<p>it just gonna chuck it out because uh</p>
<p>that sounds like a fantastic lifestyle</p>
<p>and you know i spent time on the road i</p>
<p>used to drive 50 000 miles a year for</p>
<p>my profession and man it was hard to go</p>
<p>by the speedways and you know the little</p>
<p>convenience stores but he&rsquo;s julian&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>the road 24 7 and somehow has remained a</p>
<p>level of discipline that uh hitherto i</p>
<p>have not known so good for you julian we</p>
<p>would love it even even even when you</p>
<p>start doing intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>then the stomach actually does</p>
<p>kind of</p>
<p>adapt to that it gets smaller so same</p>
<p>thing with prolonged fasting your</p>
<p>stomach will get smaller to adapt to</p>
<p>that and then all of a sudden you go</p>
<p>back and</p>
<p>try to put more food it&rsquo;s like whoa it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like not quite fitting in that that</p>
<p>small space anymore um so it&rsquo;s it takes</p>
<p>some adjustments because your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more efficient and it doesn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>need that much</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very efficient</p>
<p>all the systems adapt</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>versus other people they need to eat</p>
<p>like literally a cow like just a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of meat to get</p>
<p>satisfied um it&rsquo;s not a bad thing that</p>
<p>you need to eat less so yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really cool that&rsquo;s fantastic we look</p>
<p>forward to steve what do we got next</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;ve got another quiz question and</p>
<p>here it is</p>
<p>all right what percentage</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>what percentage of your body is water</p>
<p>what percentage of your body is water</p>
<p>back to the steak thing a little bit</p>
<p>um now let&rsquo;s see what else do we have um</p>
<p>jj and let&rsquo;s go to facebook this time</p>
<p>can people</p>
<p>uh can people food anxiety since being</p>
<p>diagnosed with an ulcer i&rsquo;m afraid of</p>
<p>eating acidic foods</p>
<p>could that be my detrimental to my</p>
<p>health so they&rsquo;re anxious about eating</p>
<p>acidic foods because of their ulcer</p>
<p>well first of all um</p>
<p>if you have an ulcer you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>be doing a set of foods because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to irritate your ulcer um i</p>
<p>i think i would i wouldn&rsquo;t worry about</p>
<p>eating acidic foods or alkaline foods i</p>
<p>would just eat healthy foods which</p>
<p>happen to be both</p>
<p>acidic and alkaline i mean like you got</p>
<p>the whole vegetable family which is</p>
<p>alkaline and then you&rsquo;ve got the meats</p>
<p>which are a little bit acid but of</p>
<p>course we&rsquo;re not eating sugar which by</p>
<p>the way will turn you alkaline not acid</p>
<p>which is interesting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and just so happens that like</p>
<p>the fats they&rsquo;re fatty acids</p>
<p>you have nucleic acids</p>
<p>you got all these acids that you have</p>
<p>that your body requires so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if it bothers you to consume acid foods</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about are you talking about tomatoes are</p>
<p>you talking about</p>
<p>lemons</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s hard to answer the question</p>
<p>without more data so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s all i</p>
<p>have steve well that&rsquo;s a lot now jamila</p>
<p>facebook wants uh</p>
<p>sorry alexa just</p>
<p>just butted her way in</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see jamila from facebook what</p>
<p>are the best foods for someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anemic it doesn&rsquo;t say whether she&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>know following any of your plans but</p>
<p>there you have it</p>
<p>red meat red meat</p>
<p>red meat wow so um rare red meat because</p>
<p>then you have the huma the uh the form</p>
<p>of iron that is um</p>
<p>very available</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>versus spinach which it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the best things for</p>
<p>anemia unless you like liver and then i</p>
<p>would go with the liver</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>but red meat should handle it pretty</p>
<p>pretty nicely and plus it has the b12 so</p>
<p>that can handle the other anemia that a</p>
<p>lot of people have but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing that and it doesn&rsquo;t work then we</p>
<p>know the ph of your stomach is not</p>
<p>strong enough so a lot of people are</p>
<p>anemic because they&rsquo;re especially as</p>
<p>they get older because they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough hydrochloric acid</p>
<p>um that could be caused from having</p>
<p>being on a low salt diet it could be</p>
<p>caused by</p>
<p>you know just aging so betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride apple cider vinegar are</p>
<p>really good acidifiers</p>
<p>but also to build up that acid you need</p>
<p>other things like the chloride from</p>
<p>sodium chloride from salt and also you</p>
<p>need uh even potassium to build the</p>
<p>stomach acid so there&rsquo;s several things</p>
<p>that you would need but if you eat</p>
<p>healthy your body will will make the</p>
<p>acid that you need</p>
<p>wonderful okay we&rsquo;ve got the answer uh</p>
<p>to question number two the audience as</p>
<p>usual is right on it and the question</p>
<p>asks what percentage of your fat or your</p>
<p>body excuse me is water what percentage</p>
<p>is water</p>
<p>and the audience astutely answered i</p>
<p>guess 75 say the body is composed of 80</p>
<p>percent water</p>
<p>20 say more than 80 and 5 say less than</p>
<p>80 who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s sixty percent about sixty</p>
<p>sixty-five percent um water but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing</p>
<p>um your muscles</p>
<p>which are which is your meat um is about</p>
<p>75 percent the same as meat so and then</p>
<p>you got your brain you got different</p>
<p>parts of your body that have more water</p>
<p>content</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the reason i&rsquo;m kind of talking about</p>
<p>this is because it&rsquo;s going to relate to</p>
<p>a video i&rsquo;m going to be doing next week</p>
<p>which i don&rsquo;t want to necessarily give</p>
<p>everything away</p>
<p>so i will stop right there</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s enough so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting five percent of the audience</p>
<p>wins the prize because they said less</p>
<p>than 80 so good for you and the rest of</p>
<p>you keep trying meanwhile becky from</p>
<p>facebook what are the differences</p>
<p>between potassium supplements potassium</p>
<p>chloride potassium citrate or potassium</p>
<p>gluconate</p>
<p>well that would be a bit more detailed</p>
<p>answer which would require more time but</p>
<p>i will say that um</p>
<p>the one i like is the potassium</p>
<p>citrate</p>
<p>however because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some data</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not extensive there&rsquo;s like a one</p>
<p>study that says when you have potassium</p>
<p>chloride there&rsquo;s a chance of having some</p>
<p>type of side effect blah blah blah but</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s why sometimes people</p>
<p>are afraid of taking potassium because</p>
<p>it can create</p>
<p>some problem with your stomach</p>
<p>but not with citrate i haven&rsquo;t said i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t not seen anything wrong with</p>
<p>citrate however</p>
<p>this is what you need to know about</p>
<p>potassium citrate</p>
<p>citrate</p>
<p>is a</p>
<p>is something that a lot of manufacturing</p>
<p>companies especially in the vitamin</p>
<p>industry</p>
<p>they buy the type that has</p>
<p>maltodextrin</p>
<p>so they have this it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a spray</p>
<p>agent that they use</p>
<p>and so a lot of the electrolyte out a</p>
<p>lot of electrolytes out there that use</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>the citrate forms like potassium citrate</p>
<p>calcium citrate magnesium citrate are</p>
<p>using the form with the hidden</p>
<p>maltodextrin which is</p>
<p>ash i mean so high on the glycemic index</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredibly cheap and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>they can sell these products really</p>
<p>cheap when you get the</p>
<p>non-multi-dextrin version</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very expensive to do that and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind of the version that we</p>
<p>use because i i don&rsquo;t want to do the</p>
<p>maltodextrin thing so um this is why</p>
<p>when sometimes when you buy electrolytes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re noticing this</p>
<p>after effect like why do i feel so kind</p>
<p>of like my blood sugars were just</p>
<p>affected i personally can taste it right</p>
<p>now i can just feel that so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like oh there&rsquo;s maltodextrin in here</p>
<p>but some people are not aware but it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>kind of give you a a weird feeling and</p>
<p>then all of a sudden you end up with a</p>
<p>little bit of a blood sugar thing by</p>
<p>taking even this keto friendly</p>
<p>electrolyte so um you have to be aware</p>
<p>of electrolytes you got to be aware of</p>
<p>certain ingredients and especially the</p>
<p>citrates are one way that they stick</p>
<p>that darn maltodextrin in there</p>
<p>interesting well i&rsquo;ll tell you what</p>
<p>maybe a shameless plug for your</p>
<p>electrolyte formula does that have a</p>
<p>remedy for it because i drink eight</p>
<p>ounces of that before i run i used to</p>
<p>get a little crampy and it seems to work</p>
<p>fabulous normally what&rsquo;s in that stuff</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s no maltodextrin</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just electrolytes trace</p>
<p>minerals</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>in a combination that gives you a lot</p>
<p>more potassium and that seems to be what</p>
<p>people tend to be most efficient in you</p>
<p>know steve there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s this mantra or</p>
<p>whatever this this theme with certain</p>
<p>medical doctors that i guess they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taught medical school that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying you know what you guys</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need supplements</p>
<p>you can get everything you need in food</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>assuming that</p>
<p>our soils are good and our food is</p>
<p>nutrient dense and that people are</p>
<p>eating enough of that and now every time</p>
<p>someone says that i always ask them</p>
<p>well what&rsquo;s our requirement what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>our days for potassium and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know they don&rsquo;t know that answer well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 4 700.</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if they start to really even figure out</p>
<p>the food that would take to to achieve</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>4 700 amount of potassium which is the</p>
<p>rda</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>quickly realize that wow maybe we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>consuming enough</p>
<p>maybe our foods don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>potassium and we&rsquo;re not consuming enough</p>
<p>of the right foods so um it&rsquo;s extremely</p>
<p>difficult nowadays to get our nutrients</p>
<p>from food</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>anyway you&rsquo;re going to hear that a lot</p>
<p>from the medical profession but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just simply because they&rsquo;re assuming</p>
<p>they they make all these assumptions</p>
<p>which are not based on a foundation that</p>
<p>is true they don&rsquo;t have that foundation</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>the understanding of</p>
<p>um the new basic nutrition they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand especially with the soils and</p>
<p>then the depletion of soils using like</p>
<p>just the farmers use npk which is three</p>
<p>three minerals to fortify the soil</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>what about all the other 90 minerals</p>
<p>that you need so</p>
<p>anyway don&rsquo;t get me started steve</p>
<p>absolutely not uh</p>
<p>you have a tendency to spill out a lot</p>
<p>of knowledge and we&rsquo;ve got to put a stop</p>
<p>to that near from youtube i do a low</p>
<p>carb diet and have been on omad since</p>
<p>october and lost 25 kilograms i guess</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about 50 pounds or something and</p>
<p>my triglycerides we&rsquo;ve heard this a lot</p>
<p>are now 185 why are they still so high</p>
<p>well you gotta realize that when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>burning fat okay when you&rsquo;re releasing</p>
<p>fat um the triglycerides are coming from</p>
<p>the fat cell the majority of your fat</p>
<p>cells are triglycerides so that has to</p>
<p>come out</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>your body can use those as fuel</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re not exercising enough</p>
<p>well then you&rsquo;re not using up that fuel</p>
<p>so it has to come out it&rsquo;s going to come</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>through your body so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one factor the other factor is</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if your liver is fatty and you have um</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have enough bile for example</p>
<p>that could be another reason why your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s not breaking down some of these</p>
<p>triglycerides</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a couple reasons it&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>to be worried about though</p>
<p>wonderful unless you&rsquo;re doing carbs ah</p>
<p>yes watch this</p>
<p>steve should we go to dave that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>waiting patiently because i know we</p>
<p>start tried to talk to dave but it</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t work or we are on the same page</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been texting him and he had some</p>
<p>sort of weird little delay so david</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s try this again you&rsquo;re on with dr</p>
<p>byrd</p>
<p>i think i&rsquo;m in now am i in you are</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re indeed</p>
<p>fantastic thank you dr berg so much uh</p>
<p>definitely a technical end on my end</p>
<p>when i fixed it just in time</p>
<p>um hello thank you again so much we</p>
<p>watch your videos daily you&rsquo;re our go-to</p>
<p>guy for when we have an issue and we</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s nutrition and some form of</p>
<p>supplementation so it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a 58 year old male</p>
<p>and i started doing intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and your healthy keto diet</p>
<p>in january of 2021</p>
<p>at 30 i became a vegetarian but</p>
<p>basically i was a standard american diet</p>
<p>vegetarian</p>
<p>with a lot of alcohol use and heavy</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>i gave up alcohol about six years ago</p>
<p>lost 20 pounds immediately</p>
<p>kept that off</p>
<p>found your channel found your program</p>
<p>started never ate more vegetables than i</p>
<p>did since</p>
<p>watching you even as a vegetarian</p>
<p>it was a lot of seed oils eating out a</p>
<p>lot of you know a lot of just standard</p>
<p>american vegetarian</p>
<p>and um i lost a lot more weight my</p>
<p>puffiness went down i&rsquo;ve always sort of</p>
<p>maintained 180 190 but you know never</p>
<p>been really trim and now i&rsquo;m trim</p>
<p>problem is i went back in for my blood</p>
<p>numbers</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say i impressed my doctor</p>
<p>my ldl went up 190 160 points</p>
<p>my total hd uh cholesterol is</p>
<p>proof to like 396.</p>
<p>uh 350 396. um</p>
<p>i was referred to a cardiologist he</p>
<p>immediately they all wanted to</p>
<p>immediately put me on 40 milligrams of</p>
<p>statin i&rsquo;ve seen two cardiologists now</p>
<p>everybody wants me to stop the keto diet</p>
<p>and go back to</p>
<p>a plant-based</p>
<p>low-fat</p>
<p>diet and</p>
<p>and then i had a calcium score at your</p>
<p>recommendation because of my heart</p>
<p>problems in my family and i found a</p>
<p>video on that and had it done and the</p>
<p>news just gets better i&rsquo;ve got a calcium</p>
<p>score of 888.</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>now what do i do</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s start with the calcium</p>
<p>score and if those people that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what we&rsquo;re talking about there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>way to identify calcium in the arteries</p>
<p>the coronary artery calcification score</p>
<p>it should be zero</p>
<p>but you know here&rsquo;s the thing that we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know dave we don&rsquo;t know what it</p>
<p>was before unfortunately that you did</p>
<p>this that would be fascinating because</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it was a thousand and now it&rsquo;s</p>
<ol start="800">
<li>it&rsquo;s kind of like you can&rsquo;t</li>
</ol>
<p>evaluate one number it always has to be</p>
<p>compared to something else so</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s kind of one thing</p>
<p>i had a stress test and a carotid</p>
<p>ultrasound at 50. and they were clear</p>
<p>and i was</p>
<p>perfect and i have no symptoms and my</p>
<p>second cardiologist is like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any symptoms i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>blockage i think it&rsquo;s more of a like</p>
<p>speed bump kind of a situation so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting another stress test and i feel</p>
<p>great i got to tell you i&rsquo;m in the best</p>
<p>shape</p>
<p>feeling the best i have no pain and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>my i feel betrayed by my body but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s 30 years of standard american</p>
<p>diet alcohol and sugar that&rsquo;s done this</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re up against</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re up against insulin resistance</p>
<p>chronically but here&rsquo;s the interesting</p>
<p>things i would highly recommend um</p>
<p>and i can even</p>
<p>help you with this um finding a a keto</p>
<p>friendly cardiologist and there i know</p>
<p>several of them</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>can basically help</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>order the right testing because you</p>
<p>needed advanced lipid profile tests have</p>
<p>you ever done one of those did it</p>
<p>you did it</p>
<p>what was the what was the particle size</p>
<p>with the small dense and</p>
<p>not good pattern not good okay pattern b</p>
<p>very high particle count okay so two</p>
<p>things you have a genetic high</p>
<p>cholesterol situation</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s always been above 200 around 250</p>
<p>and my ldl has always been around 160</p>
<p>170 and my triglycerides have kind of</p>
<p>been all over the map my whole life but</p>
<p>that my baseline is high cholesterol</p>
<p>then i wouldn&rsquo;t say that is</p>
<p>hypercholesterol or hypercholesterolema</p>
<p>as defined i don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>case but i&rsquo;ve never been they&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>tried to put me on a statin before</p>
<p>okay so um when you eat your foods are</p>
<p>you adding a lot of additional fats are</p>
<p>you just having the fat that normally</p>
<p>comes with the protein i was adding a</p>
<p>lot of fat and i was adding a lot of fat</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t experiment before that</p>
<p>fractional</p>
<p>uh following a feldman protocol and i</p>
<p>added a lot of fat in the days before</p>
<p>and i was hoping it would do the</p>
<p>opposite and it didn&rsquo;t so i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m a hyper responder type of</p>
<p>of this person i don&rsquo;t quite fruit in</p>
<p>that category really but i am definitely</p>
<p>hyper responding to the fact i have put</p>
<p>out the sad the added fat</p>
<p>dave dave would be a great great person</p>
<p>to work with on this just as a</p>
<p>consulting guy but here&rsquo;s the thing that</p>
<p>i would do i would like to</p>
<p>have you go get another advanced lipid</p>
<p>profile test and not do a lot of fat and</p>
<p>just see what a normal</p>
<p>diet would produce</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>okay so now what is the danger of this</p>
<p>situation well</p>
<p>we have um small dense lipoproteins the</p>
<p>small particle size</p>
<p>invading the inside of your arteries</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do to</p>
<p>counter that remember right right now is</p>
<p>uh take two katrina&rsquo;s on a regular basis</p>
<p>um tocatrinos are 50 times stronger</p>
<p>oh wow there you go</p>
<p>make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>tocopherols in there you want straight</p>
<p>tocatrinos got it i believe this is but</p>
<p>i will double check</p>
<p>and you have that like three times a day</p>
<p>that will greatly protect you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and uh you know</p>
<p>because you have</p>
<p>the majority of your</p>
<p>of good indicators we have this one bad</p>
<p>indicator situation</p>
<p>i think</p>
<p>you know if we take a look at what</p>
<p>organs responsible for</p>
<p>a lot of the issues you have it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>liver the liver is like the kind of the</p>
<p>area that</p>
<p>can make things look a certain way</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening in the</p>
<p>liver but juice but if you to focus on</p>
<p>the liver maybe a</p>
<p>milk thistle and do a little bit more</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting</p>
<p>that type of thing that would be</p>
<p>beneficial but um</p>
<p>i would really would like to know um</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t add more fat to the diet but just</p>
<p>have it don&rsquo;t try to go low and then</p>
<p>redo that advanced lipid profile and</p>
<p>shoot the numbers to me at dr berg dr</p>
<p>berg.com and they&rsquo;ll get them to me but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>i would bet that it would come out</p>
<p>really good if you did that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because it just it&rsquo;s illogical what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>because what causes those</p>
<p>small dense</p>
<p>ldl is is the uh his carbs</p>
<p>and um well i have to i have to admit i</p>
<p>uh you know i my transition did include</p>
<p>a cheat day</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>often not often i&rsquo;d say you know you</p>
<p>know i was i was making that transition</p>
<p>and i was always able to get back into</p>
<p>ketosis no problem but i do admit i do</p>
<p>admit that my i i since my numbers got</p>
<p>really bad i have cut out all cheat days</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t do it anymore</p>
<p>all processed carbs are gone</p>
<p>um you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m adding more fiber i&rsquo;m taking a</p>
<p>number of the supplements that you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>recommended including garb garlic ipa</p>
<p>uh i&rsquo;m doing omega-3 salmon</p>
<p>niacin i&rsquo;m doing some niacin therapy</p>
<p>which is great i love the flush it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so invigorating i imagine my</p>
<p>calcium sweeping out of my body every</p>
<p>time i feel that flush so i&rsquo;m doing all</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m definitely cutting down on the</p>
<p>saturated fat i am scheduled to come in</p>
<p>and do my lipids again for my doctors in</p>
<p>a couple of months and i&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>that fractional again and i guess i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do the cac in a year to see where i&rsquo;m at</p>
<p>and get you know</p>
<p>my my second cardiologist really wants</p>
<p>me to do this stress test i&rsquo;m doing that</p>
<p>in two weeks and if i&rsquo;m clear on that</p>
<p>which i feel great i&rsquo;m gonna get back</p>
<p>into exercise</p>
<p>and keep doing what i&rsquo;m keep doing what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re suggesting and i have cut out</p>
<p>this early i don&rsquo;t put the fat in my</p>
<p>coffee in in the morning and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>cooking with the butter anymore i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>using you know that kind of stuff so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m definitely and i will definitely</p>
<p>send you my numbers</p>
<p>great did you one last question did you</p>
<p>did you</p>
<p>have you done an a1c</p>
<p>i have not done an a1c okay um my</p>
<p>brother is uh diabetic pretty much on</p>
<p>the window my whole i&rsquo;m you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>my whole family is morbidly obese i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>literally the healthiest one in my</p>
<p>family and here i have the heart of an</p>
<p>88 year old but uh</p>
<p>um gonna reverse that gonna change yeah</p>
<p>i i i honestly now that you gave me some</p>
<p>additional data i think that um</p>
<p>maybe regular cheat day which even if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>more than once a week probably</p>
<p>altered your values enough because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just i&rsquo;ve never heard that before</p>
<p>having those values unless you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>some car</p>
<p>and the a1c would pick it right up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>someone comes in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re telling you they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and then the a1cs i&rsquo;m like oh</p>
<p>tell me if you had</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>once in a while like and then you find</p>
<p>out okay</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s probably more</p>
<p>motivation to be strict</p>
<p>and the cool thing is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see a change in your cac over</p>
<p>time and then</p>
<p>your risk will go way down so i think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re on the right track</p>
<p>thank you dr berg so much you confirmed</p>
<p>everything i thought very good awesome</p>
<p>wonderful david yeah do you let us know</p>
<p>what happens out there and enjoy by the</p>
<p>way he&rsquo;s in he&rsquo;s in the movie business</p>
<p>and i was telling him i do a little work</p>
<p>here at the local studio uh and uh there</p>
<p>is food everywhere and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>healthy food there because a lot of the</p>
<p>stars want that but man you can really</p>
<p>pack on some calor some you know high</p>
<p>carb calories if you are so inclined so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not going to blame you for doing</p>
<p>that david i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re showing a</p>
<p>great deal of restraint in that regard</p>
<p>but anyway thank you david please do get</p>
<p>back in touch with us and let us know</p>
<p>how things are going that was a</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>call and we wish you well okay here is</p>
<p>another david from facebook says that</p>
<p>uh oh he&rsquo;s actually uh commenting on</p>
<p>this i&rsquo;ll move on from that barbara from</p>
<p>facebook what uh if you have ketones in</p>
<p>your urine but my a1c there it is again</p>
<p>is five</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um yeah what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>ketones in my urine but my a1c is five</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what she said</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>okay well that&rsquo;s good that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>it means that you&rsquo;re in fat burning you</p>
<p>got ketones in your urine ketones</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>will be produced when your blood sugars</p>
<p>are low</p>
<p>if your a1c is 5 that&rsquo;s pretty good</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right on track there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that</p>
<p>but if your sugar is too high if your</p>
<p>a1c is too high you will not have</p>
<p>ketones show up</p>
<p>but i will say just as a side note steve</p>
<p>i i&rsquo;ve had several um</p>
<p>pretty top</p>
<p>actors and actresses call me and uh they</p>
<p>want they they have this part that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing and they need to lose</p>
<p>weight within like a month or so so i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>worked with several of them and uh</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll have to find out if i can kind of</p>
<p>reveal their name but it&rsquo;s uh great</p>
<p>stories of like being able to</p>
<p>be motivated to</p>
<p>just do it standardly and then just lose</p>
<p>the weight and then um</p>
<p>then watch the movie and go wow i helped</p>
<p>that person that was really cool yeah i</p>
<p>remember one of them i won&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>their name but you recommended they chop</p>
<p>off their left leg they lost 22 pounds</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m not sure if that really hated</p>
<p>them in their role it worked really fast</p>
<p>yeah absolutely cut it off you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like these legs are heavy nowadays you</p>
<p>know yeah they sure are okay now let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see what happens on the question and doc</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s our next one true false this time</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right fatty meals increase your risk</p>
<p>of gall stones is that a tr uh is that</p>
<p>um true or false</p>
<p>okay hop on it audience let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>social media deaths from youtube what</p>
<p>caused someone to crave</p>
<p>buttermilk should we drink it i mean</p>
<p>maybe something&rsquo;s triggering</p>
<p>uh dez to</p>
<p>go towards certain foods</p>
<p>well definitely it&rsquo;s better than milk</p>
<p>and i think there&rsquo;s some type of um</p>
<p>need for uh to support your gut</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what i think that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>it could be a need that you need calcium</p>
<p>as well people tend to crave</p>
<p>dairy if they crave if they need calcium</p>
<p>but it could also be something going on</p>
<p>the gut so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know which one it is</p>
<p>but typically people don&rsquo;t crave um</p>
<p>sauerkraut for some weird reason i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why they wouldn&rsquo;t want to crave</p>
<p>that i mean it&rsquo;s so good for you</p>
<p>absolutely see what else do we have here</p>
<p>um barbara from facebook i don&rsquo;t know we</p>
<p>already talked about her let&rsquo;s see as</p>
<p>steph from youtube why is the keto diet</p>
<p>better than the mediterranean diet</p>
<p>because the mediterranean diet includes</p>
<p>pasta</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>that is</p>
<p>you know you might say well people in</p>
<p>that area of the world live to you know</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>if you go to italy there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people eating pasta and they don&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>too skinny but there are certain you</p>
<p>know places like in the blue zone where</p>
<p>people live a long time but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also you know they&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>different thing they&rsquo;re outside they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gardening they&rsquo;re more social they</p>
<p>and the diet is definitely less</p>
<p>corrupted but it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these different version</p>
<p>versions of the mediterranean diet but i</p>
<p>i think yeah olive oil is great olive</p>
<p>oil is great you should add that into</p>
<p>the keto</p>
<p>tomatoes you can do that</p>
<p>but the problem is the pasta</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s interesting about pasta if</p>
<p>you check your blood sugars it won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spike right away it&rsquo;s delayed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s delayed sometimes by two or even</p>
<p>three hours but you&rsquo;ll get the spike</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more dense and it takes a</p>
<p>while for that to affect the sugars</p>
<p>so even like there&rsquo;s some interesting</p>
<p>data about um corn fiber there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>soluble corn fiber it&rsquo;s kind of it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that a lot of keto friendly</p>
<p>foods which i don&rsquo;t recommend by the way</p>
<p>the corn fiber and it sounds very very</p>
<p>um natural oh the fiber in corn but the</p>
<p>chemical process it takes to make that</p>
<p>and the blood sugars</p>
<p>they say it it lowers your blood sugars</p>
<p>but if you actually</p>
<p>check it six hours it will spike it so</p>
<p>it affects the blood sugars down lower</p>
<p>in the digestive tract so</p>
<p>um unfortunately</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t get the full picture of</p>
<p>some of these new</p>
<p>new fibers new functional fibers that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pushing out there</p>
<p>tapioca fiber and</p>
<p>you know i would avoid them i would</p>
<p>definitely just avoid them right now</p>
<p>because eventually they&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>oh sorry</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem with this</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>cigarette steve ugh boy did i have a run</p>
<p>with him quit when i was 33 one of the</p>
<p>hardest things i&rsquo;ve ever done those</p>
<p>pesky things will grab hold of you</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s they were supposed to help</p>
<p>you with pregnancy oh absolutely</p>
<p>so anyway we got an answer in from the</p>
<p>astute audience and it asks true false</p>
<p>fatty meals increase your risk of gall</p>
<p>stones and our audience uh 82 percent</p>
<p>said</p>
<p>false 18 said true</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>what do you think steve</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see um</p>
<p>i think</p>
<p>that they do i&rsquo;m just going to say it</p>
<p>does increase it</p>
<p>no it doesn&rsquo;t because uh what happens</p>
<p>with a fatty meal fat fat doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>gallstones fat</p>
<p>stimulates</p>
<p>uh the release</p>
<p>of bile and also the contraction of the</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different than making a stone</p>
<p>the stone comes from a concentrated</p>
<p>cholesterol without the bile so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really a bile deficiency in which case</p>
<p>you need gallbladder formula or another</p>
<p>bile salt</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that would be a false</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>dr berg lured me into a false answer</p>
<p>well i deserve it so anyway learn that</p>
<p>audience and listen here we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>really a lot of people piled up in the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in our green room so i&rsquo;m going to start</p>
<p>flying right through those and next up</p>
<p>is tiffany from the windy city chicago</p>
<p>and tiffany uh you are and make sure you</p>
<p>unmute yourself on with dr burb</p>
<p>hi dr berg thank you hello so much for</p>
<p>taking my call i really appreciate it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve actually been following you for</p>
<p>quite a while so i&rsquo;m 54</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m over i wait</p>
<p>january 2nd i weighed 284</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m down to 255.</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ve been doing pretty well i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing keto</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m extending fasting</p>
<p>so as i&rsquo;ve been listening to you um over</p>
<p>the years it&rsquo;s been you know i go back</p>
<p>and forth with my weight unfortunately</p>
<p>um you talk about insulin resistance a</p>
<p>lot and so i&rsquo;m like okay well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>reason i&rsquo;m insulin resistant because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really happy around my midriff i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>big here my mid-drip and my hips</p>
<p>so um and in my head i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>glucose and insulin is the same thing so</p>
<p>i keep looking at my glucose numbers and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re low</p>
<p>so i i did go get a uh insulin test so i</p>
<p>just want to tell you so my glucose was</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>my a1c is 4.8 my hdl 83 my triglycerides</p>
<p>are 66 and my insulin was 2.5</p>
<p>my l is high and it&rsquo;s always high it was</p>
<p>um 204.</p>
<p>so when i look at those numbers in my</p>
<p>head i feel like i&rsquo;m not insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>and so like i&rsquo;m fasting</p>
<p>and if i&rsquo;m not insulin resistant it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fasting that really is the thing i</p>
<p>should do to lose weight i&rsquo;m just really</p>
<p>confused okay well first of all those</p>
<p>numbers look wonderful you really got</p>
<p>some great numbers so obviously you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the program and things are going</p>
<p>great it&rsquo;s working and the question i</p>
<p>think you have am i still insulin</p>
<p>resistant well</p>
<p>it takes a while to</p>
<p>correct that you might be out of the</p>
<p>woods now because you&rsquo;re eating well</p>
<p>but if you went back to your old ways</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably find that</p>
<p>kicks right back in</p>
<p>the test for insulin resistance is a</p>
<p>little bit more than a fasting</p>
<p>insulin test and maybe you already had a</p>
<p>homa ir test i don&rsquo;t know but once you</p>
<p>do keto and intermittent fasting and you</p>
<p>recheck</p>
<p>homa ir</p>
<p>you might see it be normal</p>
<p>so it kind of improved it but</p>
<p>um the question is are you out of the</p>
<p>woods yet no because you&rsquo;ve had it</p>
<p>chronically so it takes a long time to</p>
<p>really make sure that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doing very very well it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really difficult to measure</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re looking at hormones and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at blood sugars but can</p>
<p>you actually measure the receptor the</p>
<p>ability for your receptor receive that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really hard test so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a problem of diagnostics how</p>
<p>do you measure this phenomena</p>
<p>all we know is that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve had chronic</p>
<p>weight problems your whole life or</p>
<p>whatever</p>
<p>or chronic carb in</p>
<p>ingestion</p>
<p>you have you have insulin resistance and</p>
<p>and then the reason why it takes longer</p>
<p>to get this weight off is that um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sitting in the background that</p>
<p>actually lowers the metabolism itself</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re on the right path and i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s things you can always do to</p>
<p>speed it up</p>
<p>but you really have to also know what</p>
<p>normal is sometimes people think well i</p>
<p>should be losing</p>
<p>this much pounds this many pounds per</p>
<p>week but actually</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re losing at your age and what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been through if you lose a pound</p>
<p>a week that&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>if you lose more that&rsquo;s incredible and</p>
<p>you drive the way but if you the more</p>
<p>fasting you do like julian you could</p>
<p>probably lose</p>
<p>up to five pounds a week if you really</p>
<p>did some even like stronger fasting um</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re taking the nutrients</p>
<p>getting the nutrients from the foods</p>
<p>and doing the fasting</p>
<p>with your values you&rsquo;re right on track</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna happen it&rsquo;s gonna happen your</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s coming out nicely and</p>
<p>you just want to ride the wave and</p>
<p>and continue to improve um those</p>
<p>receptors for insulin because you&rsquo;re now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not stimming any stimulating</p>
<p>insulin anymore so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to get better and better</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re retraining your body</p>
<p>uh we don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>raise insulin anymore as much and also</p>
<p>your blood sugars are fantastic so</p>
<p>yeah well i appreciate that just so you</p>
<p>know that those numbers were done before</p>
<p>i started like i was</p>
<p>like that was before i did really</p>
<p>yeah that was before</p>
<p>making numbers now which i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>actually go back and do some more lab</p>
<p>work</p>
<p>that was before so i have a question for</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um what is</p>
<p>okay before</p>
<p>what was your diet like were you eating</p>
<p>a lot of sugar</p>
<p>yeah a lot of crap</p>
<p>and your a1c was still</p>
<p>low like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always been low in fact like when i</p>
<p>do my extended fast</p>
<p>like uh it go down like my my glucose go</p>
<p>down to like 40.</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>are you talking about when you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>sugar your glucose goes down to 40. no</p>
<p>not when i&rsquo;m sure so when i&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>sugar it&rsquo;ll be like 90 the i tested it</p>
<p>it was like 120</p>
<p>and then it comes back down but if i was</p>
<p>going to extend it fast like i said</p>
<p>five days and go down to like 40. okay</p>
<p>well this is fascinating because um</p>
<p>you um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to keep these numbers in</p>
<p>check more than other people</p>
<p>so you must have some pretty good genes</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>i can imagine your values after you do</p>
<p>this for a period of time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be incredible and also</p>
<p>your blood sugars will come way down</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t feel bad if you feel good</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s your near normal that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>normal these these values are based on</p>
<p>the average person but who is this</p>
<p>average person i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>kind of a combination of people like you</p>
<p>and people that have like really high</p>
<p>numbers</p>
<p>like david</p>
<p>and then we get normal</p>
<p>whatever that is</p>
<p>but definitely because because i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>heavy there&rsquo;s definitely with some</p>
<p>insulin resistance</p>
<p>yeah most most likely because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happens when you have</p>
<p>the extra fat the fatty liver you start</p>
<p>developing insulin resistance and so</p>
<p>because insulin is at the heart of the</p>
<p>switch whether you gain fat or you lose</p>
<p>fat okay and so yeah</p>
<p>i keep doing what i&rsquo;m doing then i</p>
<p>appreciate it thank you so much no</p>
<p>problem good luck tiffany i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>chicago and get a blood transfusion from</p>
<p>tiffany man she&rsquo;s got the magic numbers</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you that&rsquo;s unbelievable thank</p>
<p>you tiffany best of luck on that and get</p>
<p>back with us as we ask all people to do</p>
<p>after you continued on let&rsquo;s see where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see now we&rsquo;ve got uh another</p>
<p>fascinating um true false doc and here</p>
<p>it is</p>
<p>all right good blackheads you know</p>
<p>blackheads um are dirty pores on your</p>
<p>skin is that true or false</p>
<p>gross all right answer that audience</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see where you&rsquo;re at with that and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s uh see if we can get another</p>
<p>person from the green room and this time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gwendolyn</p>
<p>and uh gwendolyn you are on with dr berg</p>
<p>hello can you hear me yes perfectly</p>
<p>okay very good well thank you thank you</p>
<p>for so much that you do</p>
<p>um so i&rsquo;ve been in healthcare for 37</p>
<p>years just retired very long and diverse</p>
<p>career actually and in my training and</p>
<p>teaching i feel like i&rsquo;ve spent my</p>
<p>entire life lying to people so i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>really i&rsquo;m fairly new to your program</p>
<p>i am signed up for the certification uh</p>
<p>for the functional nutrition piece of</p>
<p>all of this because it&rsquo;s fascinating to</p>
<p>me the insulin resistant piece the</p>
<p>insulin index being such a critical</p>
<p>component</p>
<p>all of it is i mean i cannot tell you</p>
<p>how embarrassed i am that i&rsquo;ve spent 37</p>
<p>years lying to people anyway so um even</p>
<p>with bio</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>nutritional biochemistry i took tons of</p>
<p>that so fast forward here is my question</p>
<p>that i want to bring to not only myself</p>
<p>but my people</p>
<p>we sometimes inadvertently</p>
<p>fall off of the sort of keto</p>
<p>good eating wagon and sometimes we do it</p>
<p>purposefully</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m trying to figure out a sort of a</p>
<p>kinder gentler way for a fast reset</p>
<p>um if and do you know what i mean</p>
<p>because sometimes those high carb days</p>
<p>it takes two days to kind of get through</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>the reset of all of that so is there a</p>
<p>recommendation or will that be covered</p>
<p>at the program i&rsquo;m about to take will</p>
<p>that be covered um how you kindly and</p>
<p>gently go into a really solid reset</p>
<p>yeah so</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s gonna i do talk about that</p>
<p>in the course uh if you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>the keto coaching program but i will say</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>you got two things when when people go</p>
<p>off the program they need to reset i i</p>
<p>use a very very very very light touch</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s almost like i go you know</p>
<p>what i got to make it really okay to go</p>
<p>off the program because uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>they feel bad about i mean i was i was</p>
<p>in whole foods once and uh i&rsquo;m shopping</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>i saw one of my patients uh</p>
<p>at the</p>
<p>bakery section and they were just about</p>
<p>to take one of the chocolate brownies</p>
<p>and put in their mouth and they happened</p>
<p>to catch catch me and they saw me</p>
<p>they turned</p>
<p>red and then white</p>
<p>and bolted the other way and i had to</p>
<p>run after them and say listen it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay i was i was the cheater i was</p>
<p>i had to hit bottom before i made</p>
<p>changes but just you know you got to be</p>
<p>like a</p>
<p>a gentle guy to help coach them and let</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>fall and just you know pick them back up</p>
<p>but the thing is that um i like to let</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>go off the program and then just</p>
<p>experience it until they</p>
<p>self-determinately by their own</p>
<p>determination decide okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>because this whole pressure thing</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work and twisting her arm it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t do that i just use a very light</p>
<p>touch and then they i try to educate</p>
<p>them on what they need to understand and</p>
<p>i will say that the longer they&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>the insulin resistance</p>
<p>the longer it takes to get back on track</p>
<p>so the point is like</p>
<p>if you want to go off the program</p>
<p>just do it with full awareness so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not on this automatic thing and and what</p>
<p>i mean by that is realize the</p>
<p>consequences like realize a little bit</p>
<p>of carb is going to create a lot of bad</p>
<p>things in your body it&rsquo;s going to stop</p>
<p>you from burning fat for 48 hours are</p>
<p>you willing to do it great then do it</p>
<p>but going in go into this with full</p>
<p>knowledge of that</p>
<p>and that way they um</p>
<p>they might go well well it&rsquo;s not worth</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>and not do that so</p>
<p>i just use that approach it seems to</p>
<p>work real nicely and uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know hopefully they won&rsquo;t be like me</p>
<p>and have to hit bottom which is harder</p>
<p>to count</p>
<p>the back to come back up because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like literally have to be</p>
<p>very very unhealthy before you go okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not going to eat that anymore so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a process and</p>
<p>it becomes easier because even</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is an exercise to</p>
<p>build up your willpower you become you</p>
<p>have a stronger willpower when you</p>
<p>actually do this longer because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about putting your self-control and</p>
<p>just exercising your self-control versus</p>
<p>caving to</p>
<p>the temptations all the time so</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it strengthens the person&rsquo;s willpower</p>
<p>over time</p>
<p>well thank you so much uh for that</p>
<p>gwendolyn</p>
<p>and i feel better and more inclined to</p>
<p>be honest now dr berg you know i tell</p>
<p>you i eat a nutritional yeast but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really a handful of skittles each time</p>
<p>so now that i&rsquo;ve gotten that out i feel</p>
<p>much much better uh</p>
<p>to give you the truth now listen but you</p>
<p>know you know even even like in school</p>
<p>like after i graduate i had to unlearn</p>
<p>things and i don&rsquo;t even know what i need</p>
<p>what was true or false and</p>
<p>you know you get this diploma</p>
<p>certification you&rsquo;re certified to have</p>
<p>this specialized knowledge but</p>
<p>is that true data you know even in</p>
<p>school</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough hours</p>
<p>to spend</p>
<p>to evaluate</p>
<p>if this is true or false is it just the</p>
<p>theory you know so</p>
<p>you have to almost have to graduate get</p>
<p>your certification and then then try to</p>
<p>figure it out to see what&rsquo;s true for you</p>
<p>with a lot of experience you know and</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s kind of the problem with</p>
<p>getting a</p>
<p>a degree from a university</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>indeed okay let&rsquo;s wrap up with the final</p>
<p>quiz excuse me true false in this case</p>
<p>blackheads are dirty pores in your skin</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see let me clear that layer</p>
<p>and get back to dr berg and our audience</p>
<p>84 say that that&rsquo;s false 16 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s totally false in fact when you</p>
<p>scrub your skin you make it worse you</p>
<p>damage it what you&rsquo;re dealing with is um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of a gland</p>
<p>with oil and a little protein plug</p>
<p>and if that plug is open</p>
<p>exposed to oxygen it oxidizes and turns</p>
<p>darker just like if you were to bite</p>
<p>into an apple and leave it exposed</p>
<p>auction it&rsquo;s gonna it&rsquo;s gonna brown a</p>
<p>little bit so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s not dirt it&rsquo;s uh you have</p>
<p>too many um</p>
<p>androgens and i will release a video</p>
<p>probably tomorrow</p>
<p>on this very interesting topic so if you</p>
<p>have blackheads or whatever and you</p>
<p>wanna or whiteheads whatever if you</p>
<p>wanna get rid of those i&rsquo;m gonna show</p>
<p>you exactly how to do it so it never</p>
<p>comes back ever</p>
<p>okay so stay tuned for that thanks thank</p>
<p>you everyone for being on and your</p>
<p>wonderful questions and your attention i</p>
<p>will talk to you guys</p>
<p>every day in the morning we want to</p>
<p>release a video</p>
