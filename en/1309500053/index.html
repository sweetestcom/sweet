    <p>hi friends how are you today</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Saarian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s Murder</p>
<p>Mystery and Makeup Monday Halloween</p>
<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>hi my name is Bailey Sarian</p>
<p>and on Mondays I sit down</p>
<p>and I talk about true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and I do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>but this time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be talking about some Halloween stories</p>
<p>while I get ready for a Halloween party</p>
<p>that I was not invited to awesome</p>
<p>so I will stop rambling</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s get right into it</p>
<p>so the year is 1966</p>
<p>a small town situated on the Ohio River</p>
<p>is a place called Point Pleasant</p>
<p>West Virginia</p>
<p>This town called Point Pleasant in West Virginia</p>
<p>like I had just said</p>
<p>had a population of about 5 000 people</p>
<p>at this time</p>
<p>it seemed like everybody kind of knew each other</p>
<p>I mean a lot of the people were very close knit</p>
<p>so it was said</p>
<p>and many of the people of the community</p>
<p>you know they just really stuck to themselves</p>
<p>minded their own business</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t much crime going on</p>
<p>it just kind of existed</p>
<p>which is a good thing right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Point Pleasant</p>
<p>they have to live up to that</p>
<p>my eyebrow looks really bad</p>
<p>most of the people in the community</p>
<p>really stayed out of trouble</p>
<p>there was a low crime</p>
<p>simple simple place</p>
<p>point pleasant</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always secretly wondered</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like to grow up in a small town</p>
<p>where everybody seems to know each other</p>
<p>or like I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>everyone knows each other&rsquo;s business</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s that like</p>
<p>yeah spill the deets</p>
<p>I think in my mind</p>
<p>it would be fun</p>
<p>but at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to be different</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not fun</p>
<p>but whatever</p>
<p>so in November of 1966</p>
<p>a man by the name of Roger Scarbury</p>
<p>was driving just</p>
<p>just a couple miles up from Point Pleasant</p>
<p>in the car with Roger was his wife Linda</p>
<p>their friend Steve Mary</p>
<p>and then their cousin Lonnie</p>
<p>so they were all pretty familiar with the area</p>
<p>and they were near the</p>
<p>Mcclintic Wildlife Management Area</p>
<p>and this was a nature preserve</p>
<p>that had housed the West Virginia Ordinance Works</p>
<p>which was like a hidden TNT factory from World War II</p>
<p>a hidden TNT factory</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>now the locals</p>
<p>they refer to this area as just the TNT area</p>
<p>and it had been long</p>
<p>long abandoned</p>
<p>and the whole area was gated off</p>
<p>since this place was not far from Point Pleasant</p>
<p>and was pretty low profile</p>
<p>it was a popular hangout spot for the local youths</p>
<p>you know young adults would go there hang out</p>
<p>probably smoke</p>
<p>hail Satan whatever you do</p>
<p>as young adults</p>
<p>but people would just go out there and hang out</p>
<p>Roger and his passengers</p>
<p>they were going to the area</p>
<p>just to hang out</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re bored</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>so Roger pulls over the car</p>
<p>in front of the factory gate right away</p>
<p>he said that something just felt off</p>
<p>it felt weird</p>
<p>now Roger couldn&rsquo;t go into great detail</p>
<p>about what felt weird</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve ever had that feeling</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can understand</p>
<p>something just feels off</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t really explain it</p>
<p>but Rogers there</p>
<p>with his friends</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s whatevs</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>the gang gets out of the car</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>hanging out</p>
<p>walking up towards the gate</p>
<p>and once they get up to the gated area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they notice</p>
<p>or they saw like</p>
<p>some red lights turn on</p>
<p>now this is weird</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s abandoned</p>
<p>so like what are these lights right</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all wondering what this is</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>looking at it right</p>
<p>and then they notice that the lights are moving</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not staying still</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>moving around</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re just watching these red lights</p>
<p>and kind of standing still</p>
<p>not saying much</p>
<p>and then they notice that the</p>
<p>lights are actually moving towards them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting bigger and bigger</p>
<p>and more clear</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when they realized that</p>
<p>these were not red lights at all nene</p>
<p>these red lights seem to be a pair of glowing red eyes</p>
<p>but the worst of all</p>
<p>there was a large</p>
<p>dark figure</p>
<p>becoming more clear to them</p>
<p>well actually it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because all they could tell</p>
<p>was that it was a large</p>
<p>dark figure</p>
<p>and then these red</p>
<p>glowing eyes</p>

<p>whatever this thing was it stood nearly 7ft tall</p>
<p>and seemed to have large wings folded behind its back</p>
<p>Satan is that you</p>
<p>so without hesitation</p>
<p>the gang skedaddled right out of there</p>
<p>they hopped right into their car</p>
<p>and Roger just floored it</p>
<p>now according to</p>
<p>well everybody in the car</p>
<p>this creature this thing</p>
<p>whatever it was</p>
<p>it immediately took flight</p>
<p>and followed their car down the road</p>
<p>I mean Roger would later say that he was flooring it</p>
<p>I mean he pushed the car up to a hundred miles per hour</p>
<p>but whatever it was was keeping up with them</p>
<p>just flying</p>
<p>Roger said that</p>
<p>whenever he looked into the rear view mirror</p>
<p>all he could see was a shadow of a thing</p>
<p>and of course the glowing red eyes</p>
<p>so Roger said that he drove straight to the Mason</p>
<p>County Courthouse to report what they all had witnessed</p>
<p>now the thing that was following them</p>
<p>I mean it followed them all the way to the courthouse</p>
<p>but as soon as they parked</p>
<p>it just kept flying</p>
<p>and then it flew off</p>
<p>so whatever that thing was</p>
<p>it just flew off into the night</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you wanna tell the police or whoever</p>
<p>and be like look</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on the roof</p>
<p>but it just</p>
<p>it flew off</p>
<p>you get it I&rsquo;m sure you do</p>
<p>okay now this was the first</p>
<p>but not last sighting of the creature</p>
<p>that would become known as the Mothman</p>
<p>all 5 of them go running into the courthouse</p>
<p>just yellin</p>
<p>all sorts of crazy</p>
<p>you know we saw something</p>
<p>it was flying red eyes</p>
<p>it was glowing</p>
<p>just like okay yeah okay</p>
<p>so naturally you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>well nobody&rsquo;s going to believe them</p>
<p>who would believe any of that nonsense</p>
<p>you know well</p>
<p>actually there was a deputy who was working</p>
<p>his name was Deputy</p>
<p>deputy Millard Halstead</p>
<p>and he just had this deep feeling</p>
<p>that they were actually telling the truth</p>
<p>very unusual</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s a mystery</p>
<p>so in an interview</p>
<p>he would say that he had known these kids</p>
<p>he kept calling them kids and stuff</p>
<p>and I was like</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t one of them married</p>
<p>so are these still kids</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>but he said that</p>
<p>he had known these kids all their lives</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;d never been in any trouble</p>
<p>and that they were just so terrified</p>
<p>and he had never seen them like that</p>
<p>that it just kind of gave him this feeling of like</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re not lying</p>
<p>why would they lie</p>
<p>now they would question each of the individuals</p>
<p>by themselves</p>
<p>in the room</p>
<p>and they all gave the exact same story</p>
<p>and this look of tear in their eyes</p>
<p>told the deputy</p>
<p>that something definitely had happened to them</p>
<p>Roger he ends up taking the deputy out to the spot</p>
<p>where they first spotted this creature</p>
<p>and they looked for any clues</p>
<p>or evidence</p>
<p>that this thing was actually</p>
<p>alive or existed</p>
<p>or he wasn&rsquo;t lying</p>
<p>you know you know</p>
<p>unfortunately for Roger though</p>
<p>they really didn&rsquo;t have any luck finding any evidence</p>
<p>smaller towns</p>
<p>people are talking</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t long until you know</p>
<p>word got out that there was this creature</p>
<p>this thing with red eyes</p>
<p>everyone had heard what happened</p>
<p>and where people in the community</p>
<p>were feeling all sorts of emotions</p>
<p>some were upset</p>
<p>some were unconvinced</p>
<p>others scared</p>
<p>you know just like a mix</p>
<p>a group of people decided</p>
<p>hey let&rsquo;s all go down to the TNT area</p>
<p>and look for this thing</p>
<p>maybe it lives there</p>
<p>maybe again</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some kind of evidence or sign that it was there</p>
<p>to see if it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>but once again</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t find anything</p>
<p>but at a nearby home</p>
<p>someone who wasn&rsquo;t looking for the demonic creature</p>
<p>would come across him</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s get back to today&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>that very same night</p>
<p>a young woman named Marcella Bennett</p>
<p>was visiting her friends</p>
<p>who lived very close to the TNT area</p>
<p>so Marcella was actually getting</p>
<p>ready to leave her friends home</p>
<p>when she walks out</p>
<p>she walks towards her parked car</p>
<p>just outside the house</p>
<p>with her baby in her arms</p>
<p>you know she&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like fidgeting</p>
<p>trying to find her car keys</p>
<p>trying to unlock the door</p>
<p>and the marcella looks over</p>
<p>and she sees a very large</p>
<p>gray looking</p>
<p>human like creature with giant wings</p>
<p>and red glowing eyes</p>
<p>what is this thing</p>
<p>marcella says that she just sees it</p>
<p>rising up from the ground</p>
<p>just steps in front of her</p>
<p>marcella said that she was so scared</p>
<p>that she dropped her infant daughter on the ground</p>
<p>and then fell on top of her</p>
<p>for minutes</p>
<p>Marcella said that she was just paralyzed with fear</p>
<p>and she couldn&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>but she could see this creature</p>
<p>just looking at her with these red eyes</p>
<p>marcella said that the only thing</p>
<p>that she could really make out</p>
<p>were these red</p>
<p>glowing eyes</p>
<p>just looking at her</p>
<p>marcella would tell others</p>
<p>I mean later on</p>
<p>that she was aware of what was happening to her</p>
<p>but quite literally</p>
<p>she was unable to move her body</p>
<p>marcella said that time</p>
<p>felt as if it was moving in slow motion</p>
<p>and she didn&rsquo;t know how long she was on the ground for</p>
<p>unable to move</p>
<p>but eventually</p>
<p>she was able to gain control of her body</p>
<p>she jumped up</p>
<p>she grabs her daughter</p>
<p>and then she runs the F</p>
<p>inside the house</p>
<p>of her friends</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what any of us would do in that situation</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably pee my pants</p>
<p>then throw my baby at the creature and run</p>
<p>you know like scary</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably why I shouldn&rsquo;t have children anyways</p>
<p>so Marcella runs back into her friend&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>with her baby</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>the baby&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>marcella runs inside</p>
<p>and she tells her friends like</p>
<p>what just happened</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all peeking outside the window</p>
<p>to figure out</p>
<p>like what it is</p>
<p>what she saw</p>
<p>so they rushed to call the police</p>
<p>because Marcella seems to be very</p>
<p>very distraught very upset</p>
<p>so whatever it was</p>
<p>must have been bad</p>
<p>now while on the phone with police</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they hear a loud thumb</p>
<p>on their front porch</p>
<p>so everybody inside the house</p>
<p>just kind of looks over</p>
<p>like what was that right</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking over</p>
<p>and they see</p>
<p>just outside their front window</p>
<p>a dark figure</p>
<p>is looking inside</p>
<p>red glowing eyes</p>
<p>staring right at them</p>
<p>everyone in the house</p>
<p>tries to barricade themselves in the home</p>
<p>and wait until the police arrive</p>
<p>but by that time</p>
<p>whatever it was was gone</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s talking about this creature</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when it was given the name Mothman</p>
<p>because of its wings</p>
<p>it flies red eyes</p>
<p>I would have named it</p>
<p>like a bug or something</p>
<p>well I guess</p>
<p>moth is a bug</p>
<p>Bailey it&rsquo;s an insect</p>
<p>okay so mothman</p>
<p>over the next following months</p>
<p>this mothman creature</p>
<p>seemed to terrorize the town</p>
<p>I mean nearly 100 people came forward</p>
<p>with eyewitness reports</p>
<p>between November 1966</p>
<p>and December 1967</p>
<p>now many eyewitnesses said</p>
<p>that they originally didn&rsquo;t want to say anything</p>
<p>about this thing</p>
<p>because they feared that the people</p>
<p>would think that they were lying right</p>
<p>the community would think that they&rsquo;re lying or worse</p>
<p>they would get labeled as crazy</p>
<p>you know like the others who spoke about</p>
<p>their experience</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the late sixties</p>
<p>being labeled crazy</p>
<p>is like the worst</p>
<p>thing possible crazy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not crazy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited I&rsquo;m Jenny</p>
<p>but the bright side</p>
<p>with all these witnesses coming forward to police</p>
<p>a sketch artist was able to compile drawings</p>
<p>of what this creature</p>
<p>may look like</p>
<p>or may have looked like</p>
<p>those who saw this</p>
<p>thing claimed</p>
<p>that it was very large</p>
<p>it was gray</p>
<p>it was a humanoid type creature</p>
<p>with massive wings</p>
<p>it was thought to stand between 5 and 7ft tall</p>
<p>with a 10ft wingspan</p>
<p>its head was described as being oddly shaped</p>
<p>and sitting close</p>
<p>to its body</p>
<p>some people even described him as being headless</p>
<p>with only 2 eyes protruding</p>
<p>above his chest</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>every single witness</p>
<p>who came forward</p>
<p>mentioned its bright red</p>
<p>glowing eyes</p>
<p>which were said to be extremely large</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>every witness that came forward</p>
<p>mentioned its bright red</p>
<p>glowing eyes</p>
<p>which were said to be extremely large</p>
<p>now when most people saw</p>
<p>whatever this thing was</p>
<p>take off or fly</p>
<p>some of them noted</p>
<p>that it would</p>
<p>spread its wings</p>
<p>before ascending</p>
<p>but it never flapped throughout</p>
<p>like a bird would</p>
<p>so there are many people</p>
<p>who are suggesting well</p>
<p>maybe it was just a bird</p>
<p>get over it</p>
<p>just a bird</p>
<p>but these witnesses</p>
<p>they were not convinced</p>
<p>no bird would fly like that</p>
<p>that first night</p>
<p>when it was keeping up with roger&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>they noticed</p>
<p>that it was capable of weaving</p>
<p>quickly in between the dense forest areas</p>
<p>and others said</p>
<p>that they witnessed it</p>
<p>rising straight up into the sky</p>
<p>like a helicopter</p>
<p>and was able to just</p>
<p>hover for like</p>
<p>a minute or so</p>
<p>mm mm nope I would be like</p>
<p>not today Satan</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really busy</p>
<p>something of my nightmares</p>
<p>or like Jeepers Creepers</p>
<p>right oh my God</p>
<p>is Jeepers Creepers</p>
<p>about Mothman</p>
<p>oh man that movie</p>
<p>ruined me as a teen</p>
<p>back to the story</p>
<p>so skeptics</p>
<p>they suggested that</p>
<p>this whole mothman garbage</p>
<p>could easily be explained</p>
<p>it was simply</p>
<p>a Sand Hill crane</p>
<p>which is a large bird</p>
<p>with red coloring</p>
<p>around its eyes</p>
<p>many people</p>
<p>are just not believing this</p>
<p>story right</p>
<p>many are thinking</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simply</p>
<p>a Sand Hill crane</p>
<p>calm your tits</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a bird</p>
<p>but some of the people</p>
<p>who had actually witnessed</p>
<p>this mothman</p>
<p>some of them</p>
<p>were hunters and</p>
<p>or fishermen</p>
<p>and they pushed back</p>
<p>because they felt confident</p>
<p>in saying that</p>
<p>this was not a bird</p>
<p>they would not mistake</p>
<p>a bird for a 7ft</p>
<p>tall winged</p>
<p>bug person thing</p>
<p>with glowing</p>
<p>red eyes I hunt</p>
<p>I would know</p>
<p>is what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen birds before</p>
<p>on November 2 1966</p>
<p>just 10 days before the</p>
<p>first mothman sighting</p>
<p>a man by the name of Woodrow</p>
<p>was driving home</p>
<p>to Mineral Wells</p>
<p>West Virginia</p>
<p>when he was cut off</p>
<p>by what he thought was a car</p>
<p>now it kind of caught him by surprise</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>any headlights</p>
<p>in his rear view mirror</p>
<p>or anything</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>he also didn&rsquo;t see any cars</p>
<p>approaching</p>
<p>but whoever</p>
<p>cut him off</p>
<p>went around him</p>
<p>and started</p>
<p>going slower than him</p>
<p>which side note</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cut people off</p>
<p>and then go</p>
<p>like the speed limit</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna cut me off</p>
<p>floor it okay</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand that</p>
<p>shit anyways</p>
<p>so which row</p>
<p>is like dude</p>
<p>what the hell</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s forcing</p>
<p>him to break</p>
<p>and then eventually</p>
<p>it forces him</p>
<p>to pull over</p>
<p>on the side of the road</p>
<p>because this douchebag</p>
<p>is messing with him</p>
<p>he then steps</p>
<p>out of his car</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>looking and</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>at this car</p>
<p>he realizes that</p>
<p>whatever this was</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a car at all</p>
<p>Woodrow said that</p>
<p>it looked like</p>
<p>a large unit</p>
<p>or it looked</p>
<p>like a kerosene</p>
<p>lamp chimney</p>
<p>aka UFO I know</p>
<p>some of you</p>
<p>are rolling your eyes</p>
<p>right now just</p>
<p>go on this journey with me</p>
<p>okay go on this journey</p>
<p>so Woodrow said that a large figure</p>
<p>then came out of the craft</p>
<p>and it walked towards him</p>
<p>Woodrow said that whatever it was</p>
<p>it looked like it was human</p>
<p>and he believed that whatever it was</p>
<p>was trying to talk to him</p>
<p>like it wasn&rsquo;t verbally saying anything</p>
<p>but Woodrow felt like it was speaking telepathically</p>
<p>through his mind</p>
<p>Woodrow felt that you know</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s just dreaming right</p>
<p>pinches himself</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not dreaming</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s certain of that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna call an alien</p>
<p>this alien went back into its craft and took off</p>
<p>it was gone within seconds</p>
<p>just whoosh</p>
<p>now of course</p>
<p>when Wood Trail went home</p>
<p>nobody really believed him</p>
<p>and when he tried to explain it to others</p>
<p>about his night</p>
<p>Woodrow knew that he sounded crazy but I mean</p>
<p>he spoke his truth</p>
<p>and unfortunately he was considered crazy</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m only bringing up with joe&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>because it would be more and more common in future</p>
<p>mothman sightings</p>
<p>to have UFO reports coming in</p>
<p>around the same time as the sightings of the mothman</p>
<p>so many would later believe that perhaps the 2</p>
<p>went hand in hand</p>
<p>and that maybe this creature was actually an alien</p>
<p>or they were connected in some way</p>
<p>so one of the main routes into Point Pleasant</p>
<p>was over a steel bridge</p>
<p>which joined the state of Ohio and West Virginia</p>
<p>many would take that bridge to and from work</p>
<p>but overall</p>
<p>it was just a well traveled route</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m getting at</p>
<p>you get it December 15th 1967</p>
<p>the steel bridge collapsed tragically</p>
<p>killing 46 people</p>
<p>but get this</p>
<p>that very same evening</p>
<p>there were numerous</p>
<p>phone calls made to the local police</p>
<p>saying that there was a large figure with red eyes</p>
<p>red glowing eyes</p>
<p>that was seen hanging around the bridge</p>
<p>now this was concerning because</p>
<p>could Mothman be responsible for the bridge collapsing</p>
<p>so a lot of again</p>
<p>rumors are going around</p>
<p>and many are talking</p>
<p>many are thinking that</p>
<p>maybe the Mothman was responsible for this</p>
<p>and more and more people are getting scared</p>
<p>because you know</p>
<p>is this Mothman guy here to harm us</p>
<p>this whole bridge crashed</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s an awful sad tragedy</p>
<p>but also some people in the community</p>
<p>were believing that maybe just</p>
<p>maybe the mothman was actually there to warn people</p>
<p>of certain tragedies to come</p>
<p>and maybe the mothman wasn&rsquo;t the bad guy</p>
<p>maybe they had it all wrong</p>
<p>it was like an angel trying to warn them</p>
<p>if that were true</p>
<p>though Mothman did a real bad job</p>
<p>warning people of this bridge collapsing</p>
<p>am I right as the years pass</p>
<p>reports of this Mothman creature have been made</p>
<p>around the world</p>
<p>all of those who had witnessed him</p>
<p>reported the same thing over and over and over again</p>
<p>red glowing eyes</p>
<p>large dark figure huge wings</p>
<p>some paranormal authors and cryptozoologists</p>
<p>believe that the mothman may have been an alien</p>
<p>some suggesting that maybe it was just as simple as</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>an unknown species</p>
<p>in the 1975 book</p>
<p>the Mothman Prophecies</p>
<p>author John Keel</p>
<p>claim that the Point Pleasant residents who witnessed</p>
<p>mothman also experienced visions happening</p>
<p>visions into the future</p>
<p>and they said that they were like</p>
<p>having random dreams</p>
<p>random thoughts</p>
<p>but of things happening</p>
<p>hear me out okay</p>
<p>some of the witnesses said that they saw</p>
<p>the silver bridge collapsing</p>
<p>before it actually happened</p>
<p>other witnesses</p>
<p>said that they saw unidentified flying objects</p>
<p>around the same time</p>
<p>that they witnessed the mothman</p>
<p>and others said that they had visits from men</p>
<p>dressed in all black</p>
<p>yeah threatening them</p>
<p>that if they spoke of their experiences to anyone</p>
<p>or kept digging around</p>
<p>for answers</p>
<p>something very terrible</p>
<p>may happen to them</p>
<p>or maybe even their families</p>
<p>which kept a lot of witnesses quiet</p>
<p>for years and years</p>
<p>for a good reason</p>
<p>out of fear</p>
<p>to this day</p>
<p>occasionally</p>
<p>you will hear stories</p>
<p>of people who have witnessed Mothman</p>
<p>many believing</p>
<p>they if there is more than one</p>
<p>are out there among us</p>
<p>watching us</p>
<p>waiting observing</p>
<p>but whether you believe in mothman or not</p>
<p>many would say</p>
<p>without a doubt</p>
<p>that Mothman is no urban legend</p>
<p>but a real life monster</p>
<p>and that my Friends</p>
<p>is a story of mothman</p>
<p>or the legend of Mothman</p>
<p>do you believe in the mothman or not</p>
<p>I mean why not</p>
<p>you know life is short</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like sure</p>
<p>you got nothing to lose</p>
<p>anyways I just want to say a big thank you to you guys</p>
<p>for hanging out with me today</p>
<p>I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day ahead</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later</p>
<p>make a choices</p>
<p>thank you so much bye</p>
