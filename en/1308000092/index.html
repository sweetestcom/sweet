    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Okay, so I wanted to introduce somebody.</p>
<p>This is an incredible story of a turnaround of a business that impacts a lot of us in</p>
<p>America, if you care about climate change, etc.</p>
<p>His name is Jim Letinsky, and here&rsquo;s a guy who had all the success in the world, running</p>
<p>a hedge fund successfully.</p>
<p>A business called Molly Corp goes into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>He basically puts his entire fund in it, brings it out of bankruptcy, manages to build</p>
<p>one of the first mines that was completely cleared.</p>
<p>You heard what Elon said about California.</p>
<p>In California, that mines some of these rare earths and critical metals that we need to</p>
<p>make permanent magnets that we use in electric motors.</p>
<p>On the front lines of climate change, building factories now in South Carolina with GM, etc.</p>
<p>So Jim&rsquo;s just going to walk you through a few things, and we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>some climate change stuff after this.</p>
<p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m Jim.</p>
<p>I used to run a hedge fund, and now I&rsquo;m an accidental industrialist.</p>
<p>I want to take you through that journey, and then while I do that, we&rsquo;ll go through the</p>
<p>problem that I&rsquo;d like to solve.</p>
<p>Just to provide some context, if we think about a lot of the things that just came up</p>
<p>with respect to the economy, it&rsquo;s been about a decade plus since the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>In that decade plus, we&rsquo;ve been in this environment where there&rsquo;s been essentially a full-on boom.</p>
<p>A lot of money printing, and essentially a very low or negative cost of capital in</p>
<p>growth in technology.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ve seen now, I guess, we&rsquo;re on the beginning stages of the aftermath of experiencing</p>
<p>that economic enema, as was just discussed.</p>
<p>But we have just been through this period of over a decade where there&rsquo;s been all this</p>
<p>money that has gone to growth.</p>
<p>And what has happened during that time simultaneously is the real economy has been starved.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t seen, I doubt many of you have friends that are investing in new steel mills</p>
<p>or aluminum mills or nickel mines.</p>
<p>Maybe nickel mines now, right?</p>
<p>But while the real economy has been starved, actually, interestingly, we haven&rsquo;t noticed</p>
<p>it so much.</p>
<p>One, because we&rsquo;re just starting to scale into electrification.</p>
<p>But China&rsquo;s made investments.</p>
<p>So pretty much all of the incremental steel and aluminum and commodities capacity in the</p>
<p>world over the last decade has come online because China has led the way.</p>
<p>And as an aside, interestingly, about 80% of the aluminum and 80% of the steel production</p>
<p>in China is done with coal.</p>
<p>So not only has this been, not only have they sort of taken over the real stuff, and this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t about, you know, wherever you are on the spectrum of, you know, are they just a</p>
<p>really tough competitor or is this, you know, some kind of economic World War III?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is that the incremental stuff in the real world has really, the way has</p>
<p>been led by China.</p>
<p>And so when we think about what&rsquo;s now happening in the world as we electrify, I want to move</p>
<p>on to the next one here.</p>
<p>I think one good thing about going after Elon is I don&rsquo;t have to really explain this chart.</p>
<p>We are electrifying.</p>
<p>And as we electrify, what a lot of people might not fully understand is that while all</p>
<p>this real stuff has come online, the Chinese have actually moved downstream very intelligently.</p>
<p>And so when we think about a lot of people may have heard of China 2025, but a lot of</p>
<p>people probably haven&rsquo;t heard of China 2035, which is the current MO, which is to move</p>
<p>downstream into standardization.</p>
<p>And so actually when we look around the world today, four of the top 10 OEMs are Chinese</p>
<p>by global battery electric share.</p>
<p>And so when we think about the single largest private employer in the country, the auto</p>
<p>industry, we think about all these industries that are mineral intensive.</p>
<p>The Chinese are actually have moved downstream.</p>
<p>And these are very mineral intensive industries.</p>
<p>So what this slide shows is as we go from a fossil fuel world to an electrification</p>
<p>world, which we all, I think everyone in this room believes is fake complete, and this actually</p>
<p>excludes steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>Just in the content of copper, nickel, lithium, and then what I focus on rare earths and some</p>
<p>of these other things, there&rsquo;s seven times as much content.</p>
<p>And so when we think about the past of the fossil fuel driving geopolitical gamesmanship</p>
<p>and power in the world, the future is about minerals.</p>
<p>And what I focus on are rare earths.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to get to my journey as an accidental industrialist in a minute.</p>
<p>But what you can see here is rare earths, they&rsquo;re kind of the way to think about it</p>
<p>is sort of like a young cousin of semiconductors to the EV business.</p>
<p>So regardless of how electrification happens, regardless of battery chemistry, how that</p>
<p>energy gets to a motor, that motor moves via magnets.</p>
<p>And so this industry is expected to explode.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just EVs, it&rsquo;s wind turbines, drones, robots.</p>
<p>Can anyone actually guess where this robot is from?</p>
<p>This is actually from Short Circuit, Johnny No. 5, but I&rsquo;m hoping Elon will get us a better</p>
<p>robot of the future.</p>
<p>But when we think about all these industries, magnetics, it&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m focused, and this is just an example of the commodity needs as</p>
<p>we electrify.</p>
<p>If we take those projections of what&rsquo;s going to happen in electrification, just in my space,</p>
<p>so this is NDPR, this is the stuff that we make, the input into magnetics, you can see</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge deficit that is looming.</p>
<p>And moving on, look at my space, here&rsquo;s the challenge.</p>
<p>So outside of us, this entire supply chain is essentially domiciled in China.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t even have to be nefarious, but what happens when the largest manufacturers</p>
<p>in the world are all competing for, what I showed you on that prior slide, a shortage</p>
<p>of supply, and we&rsquo;ve seen lots of headlines, whether it&rsquo;s the semiconductor issue, or just</p>
<p>today there was a headline that Rivian is fighting with a supplier over seat costs,</p>
<p>all these things where we&rsquo;re seeing the shortages in the supply chain that are flowing through.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s an allocation of materials, and the materials are controlled by China or another</p>
<p>geopolitical rival, which downstream businesses do we think are going to get those materials?</p>
<p>And this is actually now an existential issue for all of us.</p>
<p>So back to my story.</p>
<p>So this is Mountain Pass, this is the mine Chamath mentioned that we bought this out</p>
<p>of bankruptcy in my fund, so going back about five years ago, this site went bankrupt.</p>
<p>It was a public company, it rose and then it fell, and nobody believed that we could</p>
<p>compete against China.</p>
<p>And in fact I had to, we showed up, I showed up in the Delaware courthouse steps, I mean</p>
<p>it was literally like out of a movie, there were other creditors pushing to send this</p>
<p>thing into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>And you look at this thing and you&rsquo;re like, wait, this is one of the most valuable rare</p>
<p>earth materials mines in the world, and this is the future, this is a material for electrification,</p>
<p>and no one wants it.</p>
<p>Not only does no one want it, but people think that actually we can&rsquo;t even produce here economically</p>
<p>because the Chinese have taken over the industry.</p>
<p>And so we actually kicked in a couple million dollars just to keep it in care maintenance,</p>
<p>just to keep the eight employees on site going, so that this thing could actually keep its</p>
<p>permit through the bankruptcy, because otherwise they were just going to raise it to the ground.</p>
<p>So we went through that journey, and we ended up buying it, and so these assets, this is</p>
<p>about two billion dollars of replacement cost, not to mention the fact that this is one of</p>
<p>the marquee sites in the world, and it&rsquo;s in a stable jurisdiction.</p>
<p>All these assets up over here to the left, these are what make it environmentally friendly,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t put anything back into the water supply.</p>
<p>We have dry tailings, which essentially means that for sure we&rsquo;re the cleanest rare earth</p>
<p>operation in the world.</p>
<p>If you go onto YouTube, you can kind of see how historically some of that mining and processing</p>
<p>is done.</p>
<p>But no one wanted it, and everyone thought that this couldn&rsquo;t be done, but we bought</p>
<p>it out of bankruptcy, we took on, it was sort of a distressed turnaround and startup at</p>
<p>the same time.</p>
<p>We had no accounting software, we literally had eight people and a mine, and I show up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a hedge fund manager, and people thought I was pretty insane.</p>
<p>And probably if I knew what I was getting into, like I said, it was an accident.</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t believe that no one else wanted to do this, and frankly I felt as an American,</p>
<p>somebody had to do this.</p>
<p>And there I was on the courthouse steps, and so I went for it.</p>
<p>And fast forward to today, and we&rsquo;re now public, as Chamath mentioned, we went public a couple</p>
<p>years ago, we&rsquo;re a six and a half billion dollar market cap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been obviously a massive, thank you.</p>
<p>So this has been a massive home run for myself and my investors, but more importantly, and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t belittle that, ultimately we&rsquo;re capitalists here, we want to do a great job for our clients</p>
<p>and ourselves.</p>
<p>But I hope that we can kind of contextualize this for what needs to happen throughout our</p>
<p>economy, because I do think that as painful as the adjustment may be that we&rsquo;re now in</p>
<p>this period that we&rsquo;re about to be in, as the capital comes out of the growth space,</p>
<p>there is going to be a big, beautiful bull market in real stuff.</p>
<p>And it is just beginning, and I&rsquo;ll give some statistics with the besties, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to ruin my besties time, so I&rsquo;m going to finish up real quick, but there is a lot of</p>
<p>stuff that needs to get built, and this supply chain stuff is existential.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re doing at MP, you can see our stage one, we&rsquo;re doing, we just reported</p>
<p>our quarter a couple weeks ago, we&rsquo;re now, from a site four years ago that I had to beg</p>
<p>on the courthouse steps just to keep it alive, we&rsquo;re now doing approximately 450 million</p>
<p>of run rate EBITDA today.</p>
<p>So, and then we announced a deal with GM, we actually have already broken ground at</p>
<p>a magnetics facility in Fort Worth, Texas, and this is a scale deal, it&rsquo;s not exclusive,</p>
<p>we expect to bring in other OEMs, where we&rsquo;ll be making magnets, so we&rsquo;ll be shipping material</p>
<p>that will be environmentally produced from Mountain Pass, California over to our site</p>
<p>in Fort Worth and make magnetics, and our goal is to build a western magnetics champion.</p>
<p>And so, I guess with all that I would say, hopefully this kind of thing can inspire</p>
<p>you, we need, the good news is there needs to be a lot more stuff like this, maybe I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>share some stats on some of the other space, because I don&rsquo;t want to make this just about</p>
<p>rare earths, but when we think about all the materials that we need for this electrification</p>
<p>boom, and the supply chain that needs to be built, this is like, this is the era of, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s the 19-teens and Ford is just out, I mean there is an entire supply chain,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just EVs, it&rsquo;s wind turbines, it&rsquo;s drones, it&rsquo;s robots, and it needs to</p>
<p>be a bunch of real stuff that we all create, and so I don&rsquo;t think, some percentage of us</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to necessarily debate whether crypto is going to go up or down, now is a time to</p>
<p>pivot I think, because this is something that we need to do to get competitive again, so</p>
<p>I guess with that I&rsquo;ll flip the mic and feel the fire from the besties, thank you.</p>
<p>Tesla in their quarterly earnings said something to the effect of, you know, we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>consider becoming a mining company as well, right, and then I think Elon said something</p>
<p>on the earnings call which I thought was really interesting, he&rsquo;s like, I encourage every</p>
<p>entrepreneur out there to get into lithium, please become a lithium miner, right, so maybe</p>
<p>if you can just quantify for us, and you showed the gap for your, for NDPR, but broadly speaking</p>
<p>lithium and all the other things that we need to actually electrify and get to a reasonable</p>
<p>place in climate change, how behind the curve are we really?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great question, and the data is tough because a lot of it is reliant on battery</p>
<p>chemistry, and so we don&rsquo;t know exactly how much nickel it&rsquo;ll be, you know, but we do</p>
<p>know certainly lithium, nickel, copper, all of these things, it&rsquo;s multiple, so we need,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s actually, maybe this is a great stat, some good source that I utilize estimated</p>
<p>that we probably need on the order of 40 to 50 copper and nickel projects over the next</p>
<p>couple decades, so call it roughly $200 billion of CapEx to satisfy the demand for electrification</p>
<p>that we have over the next couple decades, and what&rsquo;s so interesting, you mentioned,</p>
<p>and obviously I assume Elon sees this, is if you look at the multiples, you know, just</p>
<p>think about it from a strict investor point of view, from a financial arbitrage standpoint,</p>
<p>look at the multiples of where auto OEMs trade, or, you know, certainly Tesla, and then look</p>
<p>at what&rsquo;s happening in the mining industry today, so actually the nickel industry is</p>
<p>dominated by essentially Glencore and Vale, those two businesses, and I&rsquo;m not, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not pitching stocks, but as an investor, you know, we&rsquo;ll see with the next panel, those</p>
<p>two businesses right now at today&rsquo;s commodities prices are essentially going to free cash</p>
<p>flow themselves out in three years, and they&rsquo;re buying back stock, right, and so this is how</p>
<p>stark the arbitrage is, that in the real economy, mining and materials companies, steel companies</p>
<p>are trading at double digit free cash flow yields, they&rsquo;re buying back stock, they have</p>
<p>no leverage in their businesses, and then downstream, everyone&rsquo;s relying on them, and</p>
<p>upstream, these guys, they don&rsquo;t want to spend to build out new capacity, because the cost</p>
<p>of capital is too high, so what&rsquo;s going to happen is, I think you&rsquo;re going to see maybe</p>
<p>an AOL Time Warner moment, and I don&rsquo;t mean it the negative way, but I think you could</p>
<p>see a Tesla or someone like that buy upstream into these industries, because ultimately</p>
<p>downstream they all realize that the real stuff is in shortage, and you can&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>enterprise value downstream, because it&rsquo;s like musical chairs.</p>
<p>How much of your night, when you&rsquo;re sleeping, do you think, there&rsquo;s an X percent chance</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have some huge environmental catastrophe, like part of I think why a lot</p>
<p>of folks, you know, folks like this, who could probably go into that business, don&rsquo;t, is</p>
<p>in the back of their mind, they think, man, this is like, this is a lot of gnarly stuff</p>
<p>if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>How do you manage that risk, and how big is that risk if we try to do this in America?</p>
<p>So the single most important thing we do at MP is safety, and we actually in our last</p>
<p>earnest call said, you know, last two years, we&rsquo;ve had two years without a lost time injury,</p>
<p>and we gave everybody, every single employee in the company a cash bonus to celebrate that</p>
<p>milestone, which is really critical.</p>
<p>The reality is, this isn&rsquo;t software, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real stuff.</p>
<p>All we can do is our best.</p>
<p>I just think, I think frankly as a human being, as an American, I would rather have mines</p>
<p>being done in America, in the state of California, over elsewhere in the world, where I certainly</p>
<p>know that, I assure you that nickel mining in Russia is not as environmentally friendly</p>
<p>as it is in Canada.</p>
<p>Well, I think most people may or may not know this, but for example, all of the, you know,</p>
<p>cobalt that goes into a lot of these EVs, a lot of it comes from DRC, and if you go</p>
<p>and see the state of governance in DRC, women&rsquo;s rights in DRC, child rights in DRC, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>non-existent.</p>
<p>And so, it is a very, very complicated, dirty supply chain that feeds the beast, and even</p>
<p>though you may think you&rsquo;re doing the right thing by, you know, driving this plug-in hybrid</p>
<p>or, you know, your Toyota Prius, if you trace that stuff back, it&rsquo;s a really complicated</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve all gotten a big education on supply chain over the last two years with</p>
<p>COVID, and the value may be of redundancy, and what happens if you give a dictator a</p>
<p>little too much power?</p>
<p>I think the Germans are learning a hard lesson about what happens when you shut down nuclear</p>
<p>reactors and decide, hey, let&rsquo;s buy our, let&rsquo;s buy our energy from Putin.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a great point you raise about the Germans, because I think it&rsquo;s a fair analogy</p>
<p>to say that Germany is to NatGas as we are to China supply chain.</p>
<p>And so, we see, we see this coming, right?</p>
<p>We see, and again, this speaks to geopolitical leverage.</p>
<p>This is a national security issue, is it not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a national security issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a democracy issue.</p>
<p>Is it a war issue?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it something that gets to the point where we would have to go to war if, for example,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t get the natural resources and critical elements we need?</p>
<p>Not that you say that it could, not it would happen, but could it happen where it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>important that all these other countries can electrify and‚Äî</p>
<p>Well, how about this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make a prediction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that in the next five years, we will see a major household name OEM fail or need</p>
<p>a bailout due to, not, you know, prices went up on them, but lack of access to a material,</p>
<p>some kind of critical material.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re talking a GM, a Ford, a somebody.</p>
<p>Somebody.</p>
<p>Probably not GM.</p>
<p>I mean, and Shamath, think about it.</p>
<p>Do we, if you think about it, Shamath, do we need to even predict this?</p>
<p>We went to a number of wars in the Middle East over oil.</p>
<p>So if this is the new oil, and that is the analogy, it&rsquo;s clearly going to cause, you</p>
<p>know, conflicts, and the question is, you know, are we going to build a strategic reserve</p>
<p>of these materials?</p>
<p>Do we have a strategic reserve?</p>
<p>We talked about the food supply problem, and Freeberg educated us on, hey, we&rsquo;ve got, like,</p>
<p>30 days of food.</p>
<p>This country has 90 days of food.</p>
<p>Do we need to have a strategic reserve of these rare earth minerals in the United States?</p>
<p>Jason, I just don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be enough, because when you think about, this is, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about a multi, trillions of dollars a year to electrify across.</p>
<p>So the demand is so great.</p>
<p>The demand is so great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t build up supply.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t build up supply, or if we can&rsquo;t, we need to put the capital in, and right now,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why, you know, again, we&rsquo;ll let the investor panel, maybe they can bleed into</p>
<p>this, but that&rsquo;s why I think the whole space is a screaming buy, because if you look across</p>
<p>all these companies, the cost of capital is just so high, and so one of two things has</p>
<p>to happen, or both, which is prices just have to go vertical, or someone starts taking</p>
<p>them out, or we&rsquo;re just not going to have the stuff to electrify.</p>
<p>I understand that there&rsquo;s now been demonstrated significantly more lithium, tell me if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>off on this, in the oceans than there is in the crust, and there may be systems for extracting</p>
<p>lithium from the oceans that are electrochemical in nature, that would allow us to kind of</p>
<p>access that resource, and obviously, if you can get a system that can scale, you can get</p>
<p>it all out very quickly, so I mean, have you looked into these systems, in a sense, for</p>
<p>the opportunity?</p>
<p>Let me step back and then step down to that.</p>
<p>So investment styles are cyclical, just like industries, you know, I believe in cycles,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>The cure for high prices is high prices.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question in my mind whether it&rsquo;s that, or there will be someone, or frankly,</p>
<p>maybe someone in this audience will have some breakthrough, right?</p>
<p>And so we will solve this problem, but the challenge is, is that I don&rsquo;t even think that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve ignited the proper focus and resources to actually solve this problem, and so there</p>
<p>may be, that may be an example of a solution, but that&rsquo;ll take five to ten years, but in</p>
<p>the meantime, there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of resources that need to be applied to</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Adam Jonas, who is the auto-analyst at Morgan Stanley, calls this the mother of all cat-back</p>
<p>cycles, I think, right?</p>
<p>And I think his estimate was like, you know, something like three trillion dollars of capex</p>
<p>needs to get spent over the next decade, even to have a fighting chance on all of this stuff.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re looking at new areas, so take your NDPR, NP materials hat off, but</p>
<p>if you were in the same position you were back then now, not really, you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to go to the courthouse steps, but where would you be looking, you know?</p>
<p>Would you look at lithium?</p>
<p>Would you look at nickel?</p>
<p>Would you look at trying to do what, you know, China&rsquo;s doing and create better and simpler</p>
<p>and cheaper chemistries for batteries?</p>
<p>Like where would you spend your time right now if you weren&rsquo;t doing NP?</p>
<p>So I think you actually said it perfectly well in the lead-in, which is just anything</p>
<p>that is real stuff, and so yeah, all of it, lithium, copper, nickel, steel, aluminum,</p>
<p>all of these areas that have been starved, the cost of capital is just so high across</p>
<p>the board that if you can come up with solutions to deliver the shortages, and again, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying the next three months, we could have a brutal recession for six months, but we</p>
<p>see the long-term five, ten-year trend.</p>
<p>I think anywhere you look in this space, you&rsquo;re looking in the right direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wind at your back as opposed to, and again, I&rsquo;m not, you know, taking a view, but</p>
<p>to come up with a new cryptocurrency right now, it&rsquo;s a huge wind at your back relative</p>
<p>to the headwind.</p>
<p>Could you get your mine operational in today&rsquo;s political environment, do you think?</p>
<p>Like if you had to start from scratch, or if you found a new thing in Nevada or, you</p>
<p>know, wherever it is?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question, and that&rsquo;s the challenge, is that it takes, to get any of these things,</p>
<p>it takes a decade, right?</p>
<p>It takes, if you have all the capital in place, all the human capital, all the, just the,</p>
<p>you know, going through that process to build it, the materials cost, and so could I do</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>I think the world needs it, and I think that what we do environmentally is so unique that</p>
<p>I think we could get it done, but this is a big challenge, and I think, frankly, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a, you know, you guys were talking in the last session about we need to come together.</p>
<p>This is a big-time area where we need to come together.</p>
<p>There should be a grand bargain, right?</p>
<p>There should be, the environmentalists should say, okay, I accept that we need this stuff,</p>
<p>I accept that we don&rsquo;t want it to be only made in Russia and China, and they should</p>
<p>loosen up on some of the permitting stuff, and I think the people who are just like,</p>
<p>you know, drill, drill, drill, mine, mine, mine, don&rsquo;t care, need to accept that we need</p>
<p>to have really tough standards, and I think we should have some kind of grand bargain,</p>
<p>and it could be, you know, tax policy focused on it, but there needs to be some kind of</p>
<p>coming together in our country to recognize that we need this stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s be intellectually honest.</p>
<p>People are hypocrites.</p>
<p>The people in the EU, people in the United States, they want the energy, they want it</p>
<p>to be cheap, they&rsquo;re complaining about the expense of, you know, even a modest increase</p>
<p>in energy costs, 10%, 20%, which they could withstand.</p>
<p>They will complain about it, and they will not allow fracking in their country, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more than willing to let Russia frack for it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want the cobalt coming out of the ground in California.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more than willing to let 15-year-olds dig it out of the ground without a mess.</p>
<p>Eight-year-olds.</p>
<p>Eight-year-olds.</p>
<p>As horrific as it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intellectually dishonest, it&rsquo;s hypocrisy, and I think we have to own the fact that we</p>
<p>want to live in large houses, and we want to blow the air conditioner on some ridiculous</p>
<p>setting.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s homes are three times bigger than other homes.</p>
<p>So to build on this, two very quick stories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a massive deposit of lithium in Nevada, which would be enough to basically feed Tesla</p>
<p>and another OEM, okay?</p>
<p>So this would get probably somewhere between one and one and a half million cars pure electric</p>
<p>on the road by 2030.</p>
<p>And they were completely permitted by the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management, and there</p>
<p>was a lawsuit that was filed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s still wrangling its way through the federal court system, and what it is is a</p>
<p>claim that there is an upper wood grouse that could be endangered through this mining.</p>
<p>They have yet to find an actual upper wood grouse in the area.</p>
<p>But nothing can happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s theoretical.</p>
<p>And so the problem is that we&rsquo;ve now delayed two years.</p>
<p>It could get resolved this year, but it could be another two or three years, which means</p>
<p>lithium isn&rsquo;t actually available until 2030.</p>
<p>Global warming continues to happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one story.</p>
<p>Second story is that just yesterday, the city of Costa Mesa rejected a bid to build an electrolysis</p>
<p>facility to create a hundred million liters of clean water every single day.</p>
<p>Just a desal plant.</p>
<p>The desal plant.</p>
<p>Because they didn&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re going to lose some jellyfish or something.</p>
<p>No, they just didn&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>They thought, ah, it&rsquo;s unsightly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want this in Costa Mesa.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, we&rsquo;re in a huge drought.</p>
<p>You know, pretty, it&rsquo;s a Costa, it&rsquo;s a Mesa.</p>
<p>So you know.</p>
<p>And so to your point, when the rubber meets the road, these unfortunate decisions get made.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way to, you know, sort of calm top down.</p>
<p>These people want to take 30-minute showers.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the hypocrisy of it.</p>
<p>If Americans really want to talk about conservation.</p>
<p>First of all, 30 minutes, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a 30-minute shower.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t calling you out specifically, but since you unclothed yourself, it&rsquo;s gratuitous,</p>
<p>in fact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely gratuitous.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a great point.</p>
<p>And my entire argument is that we&rsquo;re going to, we will answer this question as a country,</p>
<p>either now or later.</p>
<p>In the point about four of the 10 largest auto OEMs in the world are now Chinese companies.</p>
<p>And so this is now a competitive issue.</p>
<p>And so we can, we can keep kicking the can or we&rsquo;ll face a crisis.</p>
<p>We will lose jobs.</p>
<p>Are you beloved by the government?</p>
<p>Are you beloved by, like, can you kind of like beeline and just cut through the nonsense</p>
<p>because of, Nevada government looks like you.</p>
<p>Well, I think, I think that it&rsquo;s fair to say that the local officials are very happy with</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve done, with what we&rsquo;ve achieved.</p>
<p>Your plant is in South Carolina, right?</p>
<p>In Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>Fort Worth, Texas facility.</p>
<p>You know, we have some partnerships with DoD.</p>
<p>The president announced those.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the GM facility?</p>
<p>Oh, the GM thing&rsquo;s in Texas.</p>
<p>In Texas.</p>
<p>In Texas.</p>
<p>So I think that there is, frankly, support from both sides of the aisle for what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>You know, there were executive orders on the rare earth magnetics industry, specifically</p>
<p>both in the Trump administration and in the Biden administration.</p>
<p>So I think what we&rsquo;re doing is hopefully nonpartisan.</p>
<p>And frankly, I think all of this should be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, the point about the grand bargain.</p>
<p>But even, you raise a great point about just all of this stuff, it&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much pushback and we need to, we need to figure out a way to get past that because</p>
<p>this stuff has to, has to get made.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredible what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>Disclaimer.</p>
<p>I was also an investment company.</p>
<p>Well, I am not an investment company, but we do appreciate you giving us the education</p>
<p>and we do need to be independent from communist countries and really have the supply chain</p>
<p>situation dialed in.</p>
<p>So we appreciate the hard work for America and for freedom.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a huge fan of you guys.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>We let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Brain man, David Sackman.</p>
<p>And it said we open sourced it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Wesley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m queen of Kinhuat.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>

<p>We should all just get a room and just have one thank you, Georgie, because they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sexual tension that we just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What A Beat.</p>
<p>What A Beat.</p>
<p>What A Beat.</p>
<p>What A Beat.</p>
<p>What A Beat.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
