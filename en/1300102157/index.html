<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>the joe rogan experience</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>music that&rsquo;s the opening music</p>
<p>because uh me and duncan trestle</p>
<p>are flying to the fucking sky</p>
<p>right now ladies and gentlemen hello hello</p>
<p>we are uh this is worth attempting to do a podcast</p>
<p>from a plane</p>
<p>and we were just having this intense conversation</p>
<p>we dropped an edible about an hour ago yeah</p>
<p>about an hour ago</p>
<p>and i think it&rsquo;s just starting to kick in</p>
<p>and the conversation was</p>
<p>mostly about the origins of creativity and the</p>
<p>the the sort of non</p>
<p>local feeling when</p>
<p>when you come</p>
<p>up with ideas when you really tap into ideas how</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not it&rsquo;s not really you doing it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re an antenna</p>
<p>right yeah it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tuning into something that&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the word for no i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard this weird new</p>
<p>age word for it too and i can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>one that uses one that everybody likes to use for</p>
<p>creativity no some kind of like universal library</p>
<p>or something there&rsquo;s a name for it some kind of like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like some universal</p>
<p>matrix of information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s non local that</p>
<p>mystics tune</p>
<p>into and channel and that&rsquo;s kind of the source of</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>majority of like the real religions out there or what</p>
<p>causes religion</p>
<p>well we got on the subject because duncan has</p>
<p>plans for an isolation tank in his new place</p>
<p>and we were talking</p>
<p>about how the</p>
<p>thing about the tank one of the reasons why you</p>
<p>could be so creative in there</p>
<p>is that you really kind of lose the</p>
<p>whole idea of you</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t see yourself</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>nobody else sees you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in total darkness and</p>
<p>total silence</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t feel your body and you have no sensory</p>
<p>input coming in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to</p>
<p>think of yourself</p>
<p>as oh i&rsquo;m a red sox fan or you know hey you know</p>
<p>you know me</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a democrat till i die</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>start you start</p>
<p>thinking you</p>
<p>start and instead</p>
<p>kind of considering the ideas and considering life</p>
<p>you know for what it really is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about it just to being</p>
<p>alone like that there just</p>
<p>strips away all the bullshit you know yeah everything</p>
<p>in your waking environment</p>
<p>is an affirmation of whoever you</p>
<p>think you are</p>
<p>you know like when you look at people&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t that the</p>
<p>weirdest thing when you go to someone&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and you see all this</p>
<p>stuff on the wall like it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to remind themselves of what they are like</p>
<p>pictures of</p>
<p>their family like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna forget that or like</p>
<p>someone will have like an oil</p>
<p>painting that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst thing i saw</p>
<p>i went to someone&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>they had an oil</p>
<p>painting of them</p>
<p>with their wife on the mantle</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like what do you need to do you need</p>
<p>to be reminded of what&rsquo;s happening or what&rsquo;s the idea</p>
<p>why are you doing that i can see that they just want</p>
<p>to like see it and get a good feeling of</p>
<p>their loved ones on the wall</p>
<p>i could see both ways i</p>
<p>could see that being like sort of a positive</p>
<p>thing like they</p>
<p>appreciate those people</p>
<p>and so they get a little</p>
<p>positive feeling</p>
<p>every time they see him on the wall</p>
<p>but i could also see it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they do it because</p>
<p>everybody else is doing and look at my beautiful</p>
<p>house look at my</p>
<p>how did i get here</p>
<p>we we&rsquo;ve got a picture of</p>
<p>on our refrigerator one picture</p>
<p>of someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter i can&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>who she is now but it&rsquo;s just this one little girl on an</p>
<p>empty refrigerator it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>creepiest thing ever</p>
<p>but yeah we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna we wanna put</p>
<p>on our cause we have a</p>
<p>space that&rsquo;s like a mantle area</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out what to put there</p>
<p>cause we just</p>
<p>moved in and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna put one of those like</p>
<p>cheesy football posters that say</p>
<p>pride or discipline</p>
<p>just to confuse everybody</p>
<p>cause it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense why we</p>
<p>would have that</p>
<p>those are awesome</p>
<p>those are so off faith</p>
<p>yeah believing</p>
<p>what is they always had this i was at a weed</p>
<p>store the other day</p>
<p>and in the back room they had ten of them on the wall</p>
<p>and i couldn&rsquo;t read them</p>
<p>but it was all like passion</p>
<p>and it showed like a guy</p>
<p>running near a mountain you know it&rsquo;s like what</p>
<p>determination</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an eagle coming in for a kill like</p>
<p>but i mean i get i</p>
<p>get the idea of you wanting to be inspired and you know</p>
<p>i enjoy being inspired</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about people that only post</p>
<p>cool shit that</p>
<p>other people say</p>
<p>like god damn</p>
<p>it don&rsquo;t you have any cool shit of your own</p>
<p>with your own</p>
<p>thing yeah i like</p>
<p>i like when someone post a cool oscar wild</p>
<p>quote or something like that</p>
<p>but at a certain</p>
<p>point in time like i need you to say something too</p>
<p>i need to know who you are you&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>a jumble of</p>
<p>quotes oh i deserve to get</p>
<p>oscar wild quote uh</p>
<p>success isn&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>friends must fail haha</p>
<p>oh oh how many people are like that</p>
<p>i i a lot a lot of people like that man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p>
<p>secretly want you to</p>
<p>crash into the rocks oh yeah you can always tell</p>
<p>cause their ears perk up when you talk</p>
<p>start talking about something bad happening to you yeah</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s people when you</p>
<p>start talking</p>
<p>about some disaster that happened in your life</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like a dry plot of land that&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>water for the first time just soaking it in like yeah</p>
<p>come on go on oh that sounds terrible</p>
<p>what else happened</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t wait to go home and tell</p>
<p>their girlfriend</p>
<p>about your failure</p>
<p>and eventually</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll go and</p>
<p>break up with you and then she&rsquo;ll be talking</p>
<p>about how you got into talking</p>
<p>about everybody&rsquo;s failures</p>
<p>but you wouldn&rsquo;t deal with your own bullshit</p>
<p>over and over and over</p>
<p>again and on and on and on</p>
<p>until you rot of cancer you fuck yeah</p>
<p>called the evil eye</p>
<p>it really is that&rsquo;s real man</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is the negative energy is so real when</p>
<p>it comes from people like the whole idea</p>
<p>sounds so hippie</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>around so many times i&rsquo;ve been around people</p>
<p>where i felt shitty</p>
<p>because i was around them</p>
<p>cause i knew they had bad thoughts i used to</p>
<p>i was trying to animate this cartoon once called box</p>
<p>bleach friend</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>boxed leech friend yeah box</p>
<p>leech friend and it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>leech you can order</p>
<p>and it goes on it get rock</p>
<p>like a pet rock and you put it on your arm and it just</p>
<p>compliments you</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s sucking your life out of you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>great hold on a</p>
<p>second we might not want to put this on the podcast i</p>
<p>think you could actually sell this</p>
<p>i think you shouldn&rsquo;t release this on the podcast</p>
<p>i think a leech as a friend like</p>
<p>goth kids would totally be into that</p>
<p>like i guarantee</p>
<p>you dude i guarantee you if you got in with the</p>
<p>right crowd you can</p>
<p>start selling pet leeches</p>
<p>for sure i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>come on that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not preposterous at all i&rsquo;m totally being</p>
<p>serious i believe i believe you i believe that you</p>
<p>could sell real leeches</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t kill you</p>
<p>a leech is not</p>
<p>gonna kill you and they used to use them for medicine</p>
<p>yeah all that has to happen is like</p>
<p>marilyn manson</p>
<p>has to put one on his face and everybody i</p>
<p>wanna do it</p>
<p>yeah you if you</p>
<p>could get them if</p>
<p>marilyn manson</p>
<p>started putting them on</p>
<p>and then selling them</p>
<p>like marilyn manson like showed up at</p>
<p>some red carpet event and he did something on his arm</p>
<p>and if what&rsquo;s that on your arm marilyn</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>leech i sell them</p>
<p>yeah yeah but you</p>
<p>could get them</p>
<p>colored or put like</p>
<p>you could be dazzle them</p>
<p>bedazzle your leech</p>
<p>what do do you</p>
<p>think are are</p>
<p>there is there any danger</p>
<p>like why did they use them for what is i don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ignorant as to like what the</p>
<p>medicinal uses were what</p>
<p>do they use when people had poison or something to draw</p>
<p>blood like yeah</p>
<p>i think the idea was it&rsquo;s like your</p>
<p>when you remove the</p>
<p>blood it forces your body to make new</p>
<p>blood i they they thought i</p>
<p>think that your</p>
<p>blood was infected</p>
<p>and so you like you know you remove</p>
<p>blood from your body new</p>
<p>bloods made the new</p>
<p>bloods clean</p>
<p>you know until you heal</p>
<p>imagine how</p>
<p>much it sucked to have a broken leg like a hundred and</p>
<p>fifty two hundred years ago</p>
<p>oh that was it</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;re fucked that was it died</p>
<p>right yeah it was it was pretty much over</p>
<p>i mean you were</p>
<p>you you might you</p>
<p>might you know you would</p>
<p>you would either have a limp you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really do anything you&rsquo;d have to get an amputation</p>
<p>amputation was just like a leather</p>
<p>strap in your</p>
<p>mouth maybe some</p>
<p>some form of opiate</p>
<p>and then a saw</p>
<p>covered in the dried</p>
<p>blood of all the former patients because they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smart enough to figure out</p>
<p>about germs yet</p>
<p>they were idiots dude</p>
<p>you know they used to</p>
<p>think you know</p>
<p>where they used to</p>
<p>think flies came from</p>
<p>where they thought that</p>
<p>flies just magically appeared like if there</p>
<p>if you ever notice how like</p>
<p>your dog shits</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s always astounded me how</p>
<p>quickly flies get around the ship you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>flies anywhere</p>
<p>so i guess flies just hide out in</p>
<p>grass and they like wait for a shit and i like go go go</p>
<p>but like back then</p>
<p>they thought that</p>
<p>it was called i</p>
<p>think it was called spontaneous</p>
<p>generation or</p>
<p>spot they have</p>
<p>a name for i don&rsquo;t know you guys can let us know but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where just like a fly</p>
<p>would appear out of nowhere</p>
<p>they just believed</p>
<p>if you had like disease fly just kind of</p>
<p>popped in from another fly universe or something</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know that this is</p>
<p>i heard this a very long time ago in one of my</p>
<p>classes so i&rsquo;m sure i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>butchering it well</p>
<p>the whole idea</p>
<p>about mushrooms</p>
<p>i mean john</p>
<p>marco legros</p>
<p>work on mushrooms</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an arguments</p>
<p>about whether or not he got the</p>
<p>what is etymology</p>
<p>etymology the word</p>
<p>right but what his</p>
<p>his his work what he was saying was that</p>
<p>the word christ</p>
<p>traced back to a cimmerian word</p>
<p>that meant a mushroom</p>
<p>covered in god&rsquo;s semen</p>
<p>and that what they believed</p>
<p>since they didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>microscopes and they couldn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>spores when</p>
<p>mushrooms just popped up out of nowhere and they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there was any seeds there they</p>
<p>understood seeds</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>these mushrooms</p>
<p>could just exist so quickly</p>
<p>and then of course</p>
<p>you know you take them and you have</p>
<p>these intense</p>
<p>psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences so they</p>
<p>would think of course well this is gifts from god</p>
<p>you know that was a supposition</p>
<p>it makes sense i mean</p>
<p>if you were living 3 000 years ago you didn&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>spores were and you</p>
<p>ate mushrooms</p>
<p>and you saw god well that is really what happened</p>
<p>you really did see god i mean</p>
<p>back then there were</p>
<p>if there is</p>
<p>no science and there is no measurement there are no</p>
<p>spores and there is no</p>
<p>origin of you know</p>
<p>of of rain and the</p>
<p>clouds and if there&rsquo;s no knowledge like that well then</p>
<p>guess what that</p>
<p>experience exists on its own</p>
<p>and if that</p>
<p>experience exists on its own with no context</p>
<p>that really is god</p>
<p>yeah absolutely it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like less shit becomes gone because we</p>
<p>understand it more</p>
<p>until we understand</p>
<p>everything and then</p>
<p>everything becomes</p>
<p>god that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i was</p>
<p>thinking like</p>
<p>you know about the</p>
<p>shockers you believe in the shockers</p>
<p>yes yeah i i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s possible i i know</p>
<p>vaguely what the what the thought behind it is but</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s been around a long</p>
<p>long time and is connected to yoga</p>
<p>i always give it some</p>
<p>validity because</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s something that i read or i</p>
<p>heard actually i</p>
<p>heard mckenna say this</p>
<p>i think he was quoting somebody else but</p>
<p>what the quote is that</p>
<p>um yogis and</p>
<p>schizophrenics</p>
<p>all swim in the same water</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that the yogi has</p>
<p>scuba equipment</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s badass</p>
<p>well i think there&rsquo;s something to all of that stuff</p>
<p>i think what yoga really is at the</p>
<p>heart of it besides being</p>
<p>a method for</p>
<p>tuning into cannabis</p>
<p>because all</p>
<p>those yogi smoked</p>
<p>crazy amounts of hash and we still do</p>
<p>still do in</p>
<p>india you see them smoking weed all the time they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>baked man all the time</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like part of</p>
<p>their you know</p>
<p>their thing is like</p>
<p>taking pride in how many chillums you can</p>
<p>smoke yeah they</p>
<p>are dude how</p>
<p>stone do you have to be</p>
<p>to grow dreadlocks</p>
<p>sit on a mat and</p>
<p>cover yourself in the</p>
<p>ashes of cremated bodies</p>
<p>you are so hot</p>
<p>when that start makes</p>
<p>that that makes sense</p>
<p>and they do that</p>
<p>you can look on youtube</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a form of</p>
<p>yoga they hang out it&rsquo;s shy bites and shiva worshippers</p>
<p>hang out in</p>
<p>graveyard the</p>
<p>adults i think they</p>
<p>carry a little</p>
<p>skull around with them</p>
<p>there there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like totally</p>
<p>about getting as</p>
<p>close to death as you can to try to</p>
<p>merge with the</p>
<p>consciousness through the</p>
<p>death energy</p>
<p>but they also get</p>
<p>really high</p>
<p>yeah i think um</p>
<p>the times that i&rsquo;ve done yoga when i really got into it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve um i&rsquo;ve done yoga and been</p>
<p>completely sober and at the end of it</p>
<p>absolutely been high</p>
<p>like no doubt</p>
<p>about it like</p>
<p>had like a real</p>
<p>feeling of intoxication for sure you get</p>
<p>mean really high i&rsquo;ve walked out of yoga like</p>
<p>super stoned or and not i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t smoked anything and</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you know you&rsquo;re dealing with like</p>
<p>these energy</p>
<p>systems that</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>somehow been missed by western science</p>
<p>which is kind of</p>
<p>weird i mean</p>
<p>think of like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it called chi gong</p>
<p>or like what&rsquo;s that what&rsquo;s that called or tai chi</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dealing with like this</p>
<p>slow chinese</p>
<p>martial movement and it&rsquo;s like this energy</p>
<p>system that like</p>
<p>i think acupuncture has something to do with it</p>
<p>i i know people who&rsquo;ve like</p>
<p>cured smoking from acupuncture</p>
<p>that could also though be that they thought they were</p>
<p>gonna cure smoking from acupuncture</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like the the</p>
<p>power of the mind like the placebo</p>
<p>effect is an unquestionable thing</p>
<p>it really works on a lot of people if they believe</p>
<p>that you know the</p>
<p>sugar pill is gonna</p>
<p>cure cancer</p>
<p>or help them do something they will i mean they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>proven it with a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>things even athletic performance people</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not everyone</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work on everyone some people are skeptical</p>
<p>but for for people that are true believers</p>
<p>the mind has some</p>
<p>weird untapped ability to do</p>
<p>things and we don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>we we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why we don&rsquo;t know why you can&rsquo;t just say hey</p>
<p>um i have a problem with my body</p>
<p>what i should do is just think</p>
<p>about it and heal it</p>
<p>well you can do that but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way easier to pretend that you know this pill is</p>
<p>gonna heal it</p>
<p>and also your body just does it on its own</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so weird how your mind can be</p>
<p>your enemy or your best friend your mind is like</p>
<p>if you you know in the bag of akita</p>
<p>they compare</p>
<p>the mind to</p>
<p>earth the human body the mind</p>
<p>senses to a chariot</p>
<p>like the greatest and most</p>
<p>powerful chariot</p>
<p>that there is</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t have control of</p>
<p>those forces</p>
<p>you are dead meat</p>
<p>yeah if i dropped you in a</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m saying i</p>
<p>dropped you in a chariot with</p>
<p>super powerful horses</p>
<p>and was like</p>
<p>have fun and you didn&rsquo;t know how to control</p>
<p>those horses</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;d have like a zero lifespan</p>
<p>well you know what i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s part of it is like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda like a</p>
<p>self fulfilling prophecy thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to your ability to create</p>
<p>because of your ability to create positive</p>
<p>things you can also create negative things</p>
<p>so if like you know the</p>
<p>whole idea behind the</p>
<p>secret is that you can manifest your own</p>
<p>world and you create your own destiny well</p>
<p>to a certain extent yes</p>
<p>to a certain extent if you really</p>
<p>truly believe in</p>
<p>things things can happen for you</p>
<p>but if you really</p>
<p>truly believe in shitty</p>
<p>things then shitty</p>
<p>things can happen too</p>
<p>so you can create your own</p>
<p>reality just with your paranoia</p>
<p>just with your negative</p>
<p>thinking like</p>
<p>you just as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the same thing as</p>
<p>that you can</p>
<p>create a positive reality it&rsquo;s that creative energy</p>
<p>you just don&rsquo;t have a hold of it well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve just been reading this awesome</p>
<p>physics book</p>
<p>and the chapter i&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>right now is</p>
<p>about reflection</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s when you</p>
<p>start thinking</p>
<p>about the concept of reflection</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really mind blowing because</p>
<p>everything you see</p>
<p>and everything you hear</p>
<p>is a reflection</p>
<p>of a certain waveform</p>
<p>bouncing off of matter</p>
<p>and going into</p>
<p>your optic nerve or</p>
<p>going into your ears now</p>
<p>if you think that that just stops with</p>
<p>light and sound you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>crazy right</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>other things that are being reflected for example</p>
<p>your actions in the</p>
<p>world get reflected in the direct</p>
<p>result of the way or</p>
<p>get reflected in the way people treat you</p>
<p>and the way your life is this is a</p>
<p>direct reflection of how</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re behaving you&rsquo;re reflecting so much more so</p>
<p>the secret and all that</p>
<p>stuff it does make</p>
<p>sense when you</p>
<p>think yeah if in your</p>
<p>brain you have</p>
<p>awful thoughts and you&rsquo;re radiating this</p>
<p>foul energy</p>
<p>that energy is bouncing</p>
<p>right back to you through</p>
<p>other people and events and circumstances</p>
<p>so it makes sense with</p>
<p>stuff like yoga</p>
<p>what that stuff is is really like</p>
<p>sort of a method</p>
<p>for controlling your body and</p>
<p>directing your life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like all</p>
<p>those ancient</p>
<p>meditation methods all</p>
<p>those like even tai chi</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a method for utilizing the the</p>
<p>vehicle of the body</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s it and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that yeah people</p>
<p>spent a long time</p>
<p>figuring this shit out yeah</p>
<p>like yoga didn&rsquo;t just wasn&rsquo;t just some like</p>
<p>indian dude is like i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>stretch out</p>
<p>stretch guys</p>
<p>yeah i like i watch pain</p>
<p>tellers bullshit and i like that show</p>
<p>but i felt i thought it was so offensive</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re dismissing yoga</p>
<p>as like oh look</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just stretching like he&rsquo;s stretching</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like whoa man are you discounting discipline</p>
<p>are you discounting</p>
<p>the ability</p>
<p>to transform you and</p>
<p>control your body and to get a hold of your mind and</p>
<p>get a hold of</p>
<p>your consciousness because you&rsquo;re no longer</p>
<p>negatively influenced</p>
<p>by a stressful fucked up body you&rsquo;re discounting that</p>
<p>by saying it&rsquo;s stretching</p>
<p>like come on man you&rsquo;re a fat</p>
<p>fuck you&rsquo;re a fat fuck is not taking care of your body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it yeah he&rsquo;s just shoving</p>
<p>steaks down his mouth</p>
<p>he can barely bend over what yeah i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>like come on man you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t talk to me about</p>
<p>what the benefits of yoga are</p>
<p>after you stretch for five minutes on a</p>
<p>television show that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s disingenuous and that you know i</p>
<p>that drives me</p>
<p>crazy i know that the</p>
<p>whole idea is that</p>
<p>everything is bullshit</p>
<p>on that show</p>
<p>but that guy&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>smart for that</p>
<p>you know yeah that yeah they do take some</p>
<p>artistic liberties in that show</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about yoga that is it does something</p>
<p>amazing for your mind</p>
<p>it calms your mind and centers your mind</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re calling it centering</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a reason why everybody uses that term</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a balancing</p>
<p>issue i saw a</p>
<p>video on the internet of a yogi</p>
<p>taking cloth</p>
<p>if you ever seen this and swallowing it down his i</p>
<p>should say by the way that i love pen tell</p>
<p>and tell her</p>
<p>i love both of</p>
<p>those guys and i feel like</p>
<p>a douchebag for just shit on i&rsquo;m calling him a fat fuck</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a super cool guy and he had me on his</p>
<p>radio show and i love the guy but</p>
<p>you know it is what it is sorry</p>
<p>i love you buddy</p>
<p>yeah me too</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>angel that&rsquo;s the coolest he&rsquo;s just you know you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>wrong about that</p>
<p>and and you also wrong</p>
<p>about martial arts</p>
<p>that was another show they had</p>
<p>they were saying that</p>
<p>you you should</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be better off</p>
<p>taking the money that you would</p>
<p>spend a martial arts</p>
<p>lessons and giving it to a mugger</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s stupid</p>
<p>ridiculous and also if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>telling beat your fans not to do yoga you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>tricking them into being unhealthy what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dumb</p>
<p>well dunk trussle just</p>
<p>got a nice salad look</p>
<p>heirloom tomatoes look at this this is no joke here</p>
<p>first class in air canada bitches look at that</p>
<p>fresh lettuce</p>

<p>salad right there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for as far as</p>
<p>plain salads go</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a goddamn nice salad</p>
<p>yeah especially cause like</p>
<p>the last six</p>
<p>months i&rsquo;ve been traveling</p>

<p>months the last</p>
<p>many years of my life i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>traveling in the back in the</p>
<p>slave quarters</p>
<p>this is insane man i feel like fucking</p>
<p>little or fannie</p>
<p>up here when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been flying in the shit section of the</p>
<p>plane and suddenly they plop down a healthy</p>
<p>salad in front of you</p>
<p>i wanna piss myself with joy right now</p>
<p>i wonder how many people get annoyed by this podcast</p>
<p>people in the on the plane</p>
<p>maybe we should cash it in yeah i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>you want to take a break and eat your salad yeah okay</p>
<p>so this is part one this is the end of part one</p>
<p>thank you for tuning in and</p>
<p>as always we love you bitches bye</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the music</p>
<p>for take two episode two the podcast the</p>
<p>first one just a nice</p>
<p>20 minute one</p>
<p>and then duncan had his delicious</p>
<p>salad and then we got online</p>
<p>and got very distracted because we&rsquo;re online</p>
<p>so we decided to</p>
<p>fire it up again</p>
<p>because i listened to the</p>
<p>first one for a couple minutes so the</p>
<p>sound is good i was</p>
<p>worried about that that it</p>
<p>would be it</p>
<p>would drown it out but</p>
<p>we actually</p>
<p>could put this online yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really awesome but</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s awesome is that</p>
<p>edible kicked in yet oh yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an amazing mix they</p>
<p>should give</p>
<p>those out to people when they get on the</p>
<p>plane yeah fuck</p>
<p>drinks you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>drink this is doing to the plane</p>
<p>what ecstasy does for a rave</p>
<p>like when you go to a rave if you&rsquo;re not an</p>
<p>ecstasy it kind of</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense or if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>tripping out</p>
<p>it kind of doesn&rsquo;t make sense on a</p>
<p>planes make</p>
<p>sense to me now</p>
<p>yeah i made a</p>
<p>whole blog entry</p>
<p>about how i like to get high</p>
<p>and then get on planes</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m not operating</p>
<p>heavy machinery i&rsquo;m not hurting anybody</p>
<p>i know i&rsquo;m gonna be in a seat for like four hours</p>
<p>and i know if i take a cookie at the airport</p>
<p>and i get on the plane</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>gotta time it</p>
<p>right take it</p>
<p>right when you get out of your car</p>
<p>come tom chomp eat it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>carry anything with you on the plane</p>
<p>you get on the plane</p>
<p>and an hour and</p>
<p>twenty minutes</p>
<p>later you&rsquo;re in the air</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gone</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re just rocketing through</p>
<p>space and when you listen to an ipod that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>when you have good</p>
<p>music like synced up on your ipod</p>
<p>and you know you have like a surround</p>
<p>sound headphones like a</p>
<p>strong headphones like the</p>
<p>i got these beats dr dre beats they</p>
<p>sound so good man and they</p>
<p>their noise counsel canceling</p>
<p>so they cancel the outside bullshit out and just hear</p>
<p>crisp clean sound</p>
<p>and your barbecue</p>
<p>i wrote this</p>
<p>whole blog about</p>
<p>it makes it a</p>
<p>mundane boring tiresome sort of a</p>
<p>chore it turns into like a really fun time</p>
<p>the only thing</p>
<p>about it that sucks</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t supply in</p>
<p>first class</p>
<p>a whip that you can run through the business</p>
<p>class whipping people with</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;ve become</p>
<p>like very quickly a snob</p>
<p>snob i feel like a roman emperor you&rsquo;re an elitist</p>
<p>i know i feel like crucifying one of the i feel like a</p>
<p>roman emperor</p>
<p>this is incredible guys</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t for me this is like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t do this but i&rsquo;ve got my computer</p>
<p>plugged into my spacious console at the front</p>
<p>i just had a delicious salad</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve got my ipod</p>
<p>charging i&rsquo;m on wireless</p>
<p>this is incredible it&rsquo;s pretty intense</p>
<p>cause you know</p>
<p>one one thing that is helping the</p>
<p>strips is the fact that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in like we&rsquo;re out front</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>these trips</p>
<p>will be so useful if you&rsquo;re back in the business</p>
<p>class inhaling the farts of the poor</p>
<p>i think george carlin</p>
<p>said something like that in a joke so that&rsquo;s an end for</p>
<p>theft it&rsquo;s not theft i remember</p>
<p>yeah now i know what he meant</p>
<p>so a bunch of people are</p>
<p>tweeting us</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re on wi</p>
<p>fi so i said hey you guys got any questions and we like</p>
<p>fifty right away</p>
<p>but a lot of them are</p>
<p>about wikileaks man</p>
<p>a lot of people have</p>
<p>questions about that and yeah i know</p>
<p>you and i were talking</p>
<p>about this yesterday we had to go we had like a real</p>
<p>quick conversation with the</p>
<p>phone but the</p>
<p>whole case is very fascinating</p>
<p>first of all the fact that there was this</p>
<p>interpol warning</p>
<p>to go get this guy or notice to get this guy and</p>
<p>he was just</p>
<p>it was charged with having sex</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all he did it wasn&rsquo;t even rain</p>
<p>it was sex without a condom</p>
<p>which is just incredible i mean</p>
<p>how can you</p>
<p>drag someone into</p>
<p>jail for another country for that i mean that that is</p>
<p>so transparent how many</p>
<p>trains how many countries</p>
<p>would you be wanted in joe</p>
<p>uh just one really</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never had condomless sex anywhere else oh really</p>
<p>i try not to</p>
<p>actually yeah that&rsquo;s probably right i</p>
<p>wanna be bringing some first of all i mean for kids</p>
<p>funk back that&rsquo;s a good point</p>
<p>um julian assange</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s an amazing guy and i think he&rsquo;s do you</p>
<p>i am torn somebody farted somebody farted in this plane</p>
<p>stop me it didn&rsquo;t come from the front it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>motherfuckers came from the back</p>
<p>nasty ass bitches</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you need to run back and lash them</p>
<p>anytime a fart wasp</p>
<p>you should have</p>
<p>a strap you can grab</p>
<p>flashing to the back</p>
<p>anyway this wikileaks guy</p>
<p>i think the</p>
<p>whole thing is</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re arresting him for release</p>
<p>those documents</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sending a message that we can get you with anything</p>
<p>the woman has been linked to the cia and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of stories</p>
<p>about that and she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy feminist who actually has a website that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dedicated showing people</p>
<p>how to get back at men</p>
<p>you know showing people how to get revenge</p>
<p>who who&rsquo;s buying this shit though</p>
<p>is there like what there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>four geriatrics in new jersey or like he&rsquo;s a rapist</p>
<p>like everyone is like a</p>
<p>lot of people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people on my message</p>
<p>board that were saying that um</p>
<p>this one guy</p>
<p>had i believe was a history</p>
<p>teacher was telling him that this</p>
<p>was that this guy was a rapist</p>
<p>she was saying this</p>
<p>those are the words she was using</p>
<p>and the guy in the message</p>
<p>was like well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not what they said they said he had sex with a condom</p>
<p>and she you know was just like completely</p>
<p>resolved this</p>
<p>this conclusion and this guy is a</p>
<p>rapist and that&rsquo;s it and that is the end of</p>
<p>story and he&rsquo;s a bad person and</p>
<p>i guess the best time</p>
<p>to commit rape is</p>
<p>right before you leak shit</p>
<p>loads of information because</p>
<p>then you can be like</p>
<p>yeah like i raped</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously a setup</p>
<p>or they would</p>
<p>paint you what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing with this guy the saying that he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>liar well yeah that&rsquo;s and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>truth he&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>clearly the whole</p>
<p>things fixed</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t have any question</p>
<p>about that it&rsquo;s amazing it&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a rapist</p>
<p>and if you call someone a</p>
<p>rapist all right immediately that person gets</p>
<p>locked in this subhuman</p>
<p>shitty category of people who don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>about other</p>
<p>people and they&rsquo;re a hundred percent out for themselves</p>
<p>to the detriment of all others</p>
<p>but the problem is</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t use the word</p>
<p>rapist for shit that&rsquo;s not rape</p>
<p>like having sex consensual sex without a condom</p>
<p>oh yeah consensual sex when a condom</p>
<p>broke i was talking to a friend of mine</p>
<p>who went to law</p>
<p>school and he was</p>
<p>you know telling me</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t use the word right</p>
<p>you can only use</p>
<p>the word in</p>
<p>court in court</p>
<p>yeah so they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>using an acceptable way in</p>
<p>court but yet they have said rape</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of different versions of</p>
<p>the stories that it&rsquo;s gotten out but i have read rape</p>
<p>well um one</p>
<p>thing he said is</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>having sex with a prostitute</p>
<p>and then not paying her</p>
<p>that is not rape</p>
<p>that is consensual sex</p>
<p>but a lot of times a prostitute</p>
<p>will get ripped off and</p>
<p>claimed that she was raped it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>rape is non consensual</p>
<p>sex so when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>consensual but then you don&rsquo;t pay what is that is that</p>
<p>fraud or it&rsquo;s not because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>shoplifting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just jacking that pussy</p>
<p>exact it son</p>
<p>oh i mean what do you call that because it&rsquo;s a crime</p>
<p>and you you know you&rsquo;re admitting</p>
<p>you know that you were you committed a</p>
<p>crime and selling your body for sex</p>
<p>this guy didn&rsquo;t pay you</p>
<p>for your criminal deed</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t really have a stake</p>
<p>you have that&rsquo;s the problem with</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a case</p>
<p>illegal you can&rsquo;t report somebody</p>
<p>like you have to take matters into your own hands</p>
<p>yeah how annoying is that man</p>
<p>you have to become remember</p>
<p>that hbo show a long time ago</p>
<p>avenging angel</p>
<p>about the prostitute that killed people</p>
<p>no it was a</p>
<p>whole terrible series</p>
<p>like a prostitute went</p>
<p>crazy with shotguns don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch it i don&rsquo;t i can&rsquo;t believe i just remembered</p>

<p>why would you do that you</p>
<p>think he had to and i</p>
<p>think the pressure</p>
<p>of being on the run was probably unbearable</p>
<p>you know everybody knows what he looks like</p>
<p>all over the</p>
<p>world all over</p>
<p>magazines all over newspapers on the</p>
<p>cover of time</p>
<p>magazine right now</p>
<p>who was this guy</p>
<p>before he was this wikileaks guy do you know he was um</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s australian</p>
<p>and he was into political</p>
<p>activism i saw</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really good interview with him on ted</p>
<p>um that you</p>
<p>could look up</p>
<p>where he talks</p>
<p>about his past but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>had a very interesting life he&rsquo;s really into</p>
<p>um activist</p>
<p>journalism or what</p>
<p>is just real</p>
<p>you just doing real</p>
<p>journalism it&rsquo;s a real journalist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what real</p>
<p>journalist used to do that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>power of a real</p>
<p>journalist is like</p>
<p>they create</p>
<p>giant waves through society the</p>
<p>journalists we have now are just</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what they are do you</p>
<p>when when the wiki league came out that</p>
<p>hillary clinton had</p>
<p>ordered us to spy on members of the un</p>
<p>on the front page of cnn</p>
<p>i remember it</p>
<p>it was it&rsquo;s rosa</p>
<p>parks birthday</p>
<p>and then next to that was something</p>
<p>about lindsay lohan</p>
<p>meanwhile a</p>
<p>cable had come out</p>
<p>from hillary clinton</p>
<p>saying gather</p>
<p>biometric information</p>
<p>on the members of the united nations</p>
<p>and this is directly</p>
<p>against um um international law</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t spy on members of the un</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what julian assang said he said well</p>
<p>if she&rsquo;s in violation of this she</p>
<p>should resign</p>
<p>and the people in the united states</p>
<p>should be saying</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t hillary clinton resigning if she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>breaking international law</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t george</p>
<p>bush being held accountable when in his book</p>
<p>he says he authorized</p>
<p>uh uh actions that go</p>
<p>against the geneva conventions</p>
<p>why aren&rsquo;t we holding our leaders to the law</p>
<p>and the very fact that we&rsquo;re not is why</p>
<p>we have to go</p>
<p>through seven</p>
<p>you know seven different security</p>
<p>systems at the airport and get our balls</p>
<p>squeezed people</p>
<p>wanna blow us the fuck up</p>
<p>because our leaders aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sticking to the law you&rsquo;ve got to</p>
<p>stick to the law</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>front and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stick to the law god i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry i keep quoting the bag of akita because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna sound like a dick but</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>it says in the bag of akita</p>
<p>what a great man does</p>
<p>others will follow</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>front of the fucking ant parade</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going in the right way</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re telling all the</p>
<p>other ants to go in the</p>
<p>right way it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and then we have chaos and</p>
<p>the degradation of society and</p>
<p>then the next</p>
<p>thing you know julian asan</p>
<p>just being arrested for nothing</p>
<p>and everyone knows it but no one&rsquo;s doing anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why one of the uh</p>
<p>more popular conspiracy theories</p>
<p>theories have always been that the government creates</p>
<p>drama so that we have to take away your</p>
<p>rights to protect you from this drama</p>
<p>you know whether</p>
<p>especially things like</p>
<p>faceless things like terrorism</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>so many claims by all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>groups i don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>validity to it but there&rsquo;s so many people talking</p>
<p>about it you</p>
<p>gotta wonder if this has ever been a real strategy</p>
<p>and that strategy is</p>
<p>to attack people and</p>
<p>blame it on terror</p>
<p>so that you can change laws</p>
<p>so that you can move around easier</p>
<p>you know and it</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>something there&rsquo;s no way that we</p>
<p>would ever do</p>
<p>it sounds like some horrific terrible thing</p>
<p>until you go back and you just review american history</p>
<p>you know you have</p>
<p>review why we really got into a</p>
<p>bunch of different wars</p>
<p>and it had nothing to do with protecting people and</p>
<p>everything to do with economics</p>
<p>so if if there&rsquo;s a way to make more</p>
<p>money and there&rsquo;s a way to move around easier</p>
<p>and all that way requires is</p>
<p>you have to create some drama</p>
<p>and in that</p>
<p>drama you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to change the law</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna help but you can</p>
<p>justify that even if you&rsquo;re really not that terrible</p>
<p>you could say we need this to protect</p>
<p>people it&rsquo;s the reality of the business you know</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t or will say something like that about</p>
<p>you know what wasn&rsquo;t it didn&rsquo;t have some</p>
<p>quote about</p>
<p>people sleep</p>
<p>in their bed</p>
<p>safe at night</p>
<p>because hard men are out there doing you know</p>
<p>terrible things something like that</p>
<p>terrible paraphrase</p>
<p>but that was his</p>
<p>it was you know his</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>like the only way to be safe is if</p>
<p>we you let us take care of it all</p>
<p>you know and we promise you</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to protect you</p>
<p>from all this</p>
<p>other stuff</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of other</p>
<p>stuff and you can&rsquo;t know about it</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>government taking on the figure of your your parents</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>the constitution this will probably piss people off but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the constant</p>
<p>basically like everyone goes back to the</p>
<p>great founding here with</p>
<p>those things no</p>
<p>everything i&rsquo;m headphones on</p>
<p>and i was like god</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>muffled i forgot i had headphones</p>
<p>i had ear plugs in</p>
<p>if you like</p>
<p>you know like everyone goes back to like what would the</p>
<p>founding fathers do</p>
<p>and we must</p>
<p>never change anything in the constitution or</p>
<p>our government is</p>
<p>clearly the constitution</p>
<p>is not functioning</p>
<p>in the way that it was intended to function anymore</p>
<p>the founding fathers</p>
<p>intended i imagine</p>
<p>democracy to work in a way where</p>
<p>votes meant something and leaders</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t being</p>
<p>manipulated and controlled by massive corporations but</p>
<p>people get hooked on the past</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna take matters into</p>
<p>their own hand</p>
<p>so what you have happening</p>
<p>right now is</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a pale reflection of what may have been intended</p>
<p>when you know in the</p>
<p>the idea being that each</p>
<p>human being in america</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re supposed to be seeking out their</p>
<p>greatest happiness</p>
<p>which is an incredible idea</p>
<p>that is not what&rsquo;s happening anymore</p>
<p>and so what you have is this anaconda</p>
<p>effect happening</p>
<p>on anaconda</p>
<p>kill kills people</p>
<p>yeah so that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s constriction the way an anaconda kills people is</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s awful</p>
<p>you breathe out</p>
<p>the anaconda</p>
<p>squeezes in</p>
<p>you know what i mean you</p>
<p>you let air out the anaconda</p>
<p>squeezes in</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t take as much air in the next time and</p>
<p>every time you breathe out the anaconda</p>
<p>squeezes in and in and in</p>
<p>so what you have happening now is these</p>
<p>awful attacks</p>
<p>happened or whatever they were who the fuck knows very</p>
<p>suspicious events happen</p>
<p>and all of a sudden now</p>
<p>we go to the airport</p>
<p>and we just have to take it for granted</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>you know get ladies</p>
<p>and gentlemen</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to be closing up the duty free within</p>
<p>the next fifteen minutes what do you want to duty free</p>
<p>selling your bullshit</p>
<p>duty free booze</p>
<p>for alcoholics who want to not pay taxes on their booze</p>
<p>how much taxes</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i never understood it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>listen to that french as you can show</p>
<p>what a great language man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good one</p>
<p>so what we&rsquo;re saying my point is</p>
<p>it seems like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening and what&rsquo;s really disturbing is it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>everything that</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>in fascism or</p>
<p>every anytime</p>
<p>anything&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bad it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never done on the surface like this is a bad</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>done for a really reasonable justifiable cause</p>
<p>and in that same way it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening at the airport security</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very dangerous because soon that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to spread to the subways and then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to spread to the</p>
<p>in greyhound</p>
<p>stations and pretty much anywhere you want to</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;ll ever get to a</p>
<p>point where it&rsquo;s in cars</p>
<p>where people will</p>
<p>be able to stop you get out of your car and then just</p>
<p>search your car</p>
<p>well i mean i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s cops</p>
<p>yeah but i mean like a true</p>
<p>like a line</p>
<p>like you just</p>
<p>drive somewhere</p>
<p>and you have to stop get out</p>
<p>of your car they have to go look around it and then you</p>
<p>drive on well yeah like what happens when you</p>
<p>drive into the airport they stop you give you a</p>
<p>quick look over and let you go through</p>
<p>did you say that</p>
<p>about israel it&rsquo;s like that in israel</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like that in israel they</p>
<p>and you know in israel it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there you kind of</p>
<p>understand it because</p>
<p>they they went through that period</p>
<p>where cafes were just getting</p>
<p>blown up and and</p>
<p>every day like suicide bombs were</p>
<p>going off and</p>
<p>the united states</p>
<p>these events</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not happening and</p>
<p>i know people are like they&rsquo;re not happening because of</p>
<p>those security</p>
<p>measures but really no the security measures</p>
<p>are only at the airports</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>at the hardware</p>
<p>stores where</p>
<p>anybody who&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>minor understanding of chemistry</p>
<p>could probably whip together a bomb and</p>
<p>stick it somewhere and kill people</p>
<p>the secure i just i heard that</p>
<p>more people&rsquo;s lives</p>
<p>would be saved if</p>
<p>they were giving</p>
<p>measuring people&rsquo;s hearts</p>
<p>for irregular</p>
<p>heartbeats when they were</p>
<p>going through airport security and telling them they</p>
<p>might have a problem with</p>
<p>their heart</p>
<p>and scanning people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true but</p>
<p>if there was no</p>
<p>scanning in this climate i</p>
<p>truly believe that someone</p>
<p>would try to do something</p>
<p>stupid again</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a problem with scanning</p>
<p>i know a problem with</p>
<p>scanning cause i don&rsquo;t have a bomb on me</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t want anybody else to have a bomb on them</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t see it as a problem because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a meme out there and that meme is</p>
<p>blowing up airplanes and people been doing it already</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s become a part of that</p>
<p>you know the the terrorist culture</p>
<p>i mean whenever they</p>
<p>wanna get a lot of attention they know</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s terrified of flying so it&rsquo;s like a bonus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like terror times ten</p>
<p>you know cause terror</p>
<p>on a bus is like well i&rsquo;m not scared to be in a bus</p>
<p>but when i&rsquo;m on a</p>
<p>plane i&rsquo;m thirty thousand feet in the air</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s afraid that</p>
<p>plane&rsquo;s gonna go down and that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna die that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>giant fucking visceral fear that people have</p>
<p>cause they know we&rsquo;re not really supposed to be up here</p>
<p>you and i are</p>
<p>right now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thirty thousand goddamn feet in the air</p>
<p>going five hundred</p>
<p>miles an hour</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>and if you add someone blowing that up it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>double blow up</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>scary so because of that</p>
<p>i like scanning i don&rsquo;t have a problem with it</p>
<p>i think everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>about everybody</p>
<p>grabbing their balls and</p>
<p>everything but look</p>
<p>look just go through it&rsquo;s not that hard</p>
<p>why why are they</p>
<p>freaking out why are they a pain in the ass why they</p>
<p>aggressive i&rsquo;ll tell you why</p>
<p>cause their job sucks</p>
<p>and because nobody wants to go through this bullshit</p>
<p>so people are complaining all day</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re in a negative mood</p>
<p>their job sucks</p>
<p>but really i</p>
<p>in this climate in this day and</p>
<p>age of underwear</p>
<p>bombs and shoe bombs and fucking what else bombs it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be next</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s next you know</p>
<p>fucking breath machine bombs and you know</p>
<p>bose earphone bombs i mean come on man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they can keep</p>
<p>going on and on you gotta</p>
<p>check shit out you</p>
<p>gotta i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just too many nutty people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not our</p>
<p>fault that our government is doing all this</p>
<p>crazy shit all over the world</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty obvious no matter who you vote in</p>
<p>you know obama promised that he was</p>
<p>gonna get out we</p>
<p>voted him in look what happened nothing</p>
<p>nothing&rsquo;s changed nothing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>changed in fact more people are in afghanistan</p>
<p>more people than ever</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna fix shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not our</p>
<p>fault we don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>okay don&rsquo;t blow us up</p>
<p>cause we don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;re just as much of a</p>
<p>victim of this</p>
<p>crazy fucking machine as everybody else</p>
<p>we human beings you and i we are</p>
<p>look we are the people that they</p>
<p>would be attacking this</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re us we&rsquo;re a part of this</p>
<p>whole crazy</p>
<p>group and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it gets</p>
<p>ridiculous because</p>
<p>whatever you say</p>
<p>about the united</p>
<p>states doing fucked up</p>
<p>things over the</p>
<p>world it&rsquo;s not us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not us</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re not with this</p>
<p>group we&rsquo;re just born here okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem though is like</p>
<p>that yeah you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t what i&rsquo;m saying is like</p>
<p>the average person is not really</p>
<p>going to be able to fix this by voting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>well no it&rsquo;s not by voting i mean it requires like</p>
<p>hardcore activism like what assange</p>
<p>is doing like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only way to fix it people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna fix this by</p>
<p>i mean right before we rushed into iraq and</p>
<p>started attacking them in</p>
<p>the illegal war that happened</p>
<p>remember that</p>
<p>hundreds thousands of people</p>
<p>that were protesting i went to one of the protest man</p>
<p>people swarming through the streets</p>
<p>nobody wanted that to happen</p>
<p>and it happened</p>
<p>so that what that says is okay well that</p>
<p>style of protest</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>the voting style of protest</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>obama just voted to</p>
<p>extend the republican um</p>
<p>the bush era</p>
<p>tax cuts that he was railing</p>
<p>against so so</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t matter that he said he was</p>
<p>gonna stop those because he just kept them</p>
<p>going so voting</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>protesting doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>what does seem to work is one</p>
<p>pale little albino</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t like wearing condoms</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pouring</p>
<p>the truth about</p>
<p>the way our government actually works out into the</p>
<p>world that worked and look what happens</p>
<p>the way you know what you&rsquo;re doing is working</p>
<p>is because you&rsquo;re either a</p>
<p>in jail and you&rsquo;re not getting out or b</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re clutching your</p>
<p>chest realizing you just got assassinated</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you knew you were on the right track</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it any other</p>
<p>stuff as they call it slack division</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;m quite guilty of</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not doing the right thing</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re getting waterboarded</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re getting waterboarded you probably</p>
<p>stumbled onto something until then</p>
<p>oh oh forget it</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s brilliant</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>waterboard you probably stumble out of something</p>
<p>yeah yeah but meanwhile i gotta tell you</p>
<p>sitting up in first class ain&rsquo;t so bad</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to get a cup of coffee and watch me</p>

<p>and you go in there into the fucking palace they</p>
<p>built him deep into the mountain</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s it yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s yeah he&rsquo;s like getting personal performances</p>
<p>from stevie wonder yeah and he&rsquo;s got a lake</p>
<p>above his house</p>
<p>with a glass bottom that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where he gets his light from</p>
<p>comes through the</p>
<p>water and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>lights up the way it&rsquo;s a fucking palace</p>
<p>and then just</p>
<p>shipping in afghani</p>
<p>chicks just left and</p>
<p>right and left and</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>probably no afghani boys</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a crazy orgy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just littered with like the dead bodies of</p>
<p>oh you got ice cream</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>thank you what you say</p>
<p>the coffee she</p>
<p>whispered that the coffee is being brewed</p>
<p>she just brought some ice</p>
<p>cream by as well oh haagen</p>
<p>dazs little</p>
<p>small haagen dazs</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on that shit son that does</p>
<p>sound really flavor</p>
<p>would you go for</p>
<p>cause i think i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go for whatever they give me</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ll take i i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i it&rsquo;s hard to not cry</p>
<p>every time she asks for something i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>i feel like a kid who&rsquo;s been like molested</p>
<p>by a foster parent that loves you</p>
<p>business class</p>
<p>i mean coach</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting molested back there you&rsquo;ve got like</p>
<p>your legs are getting</p>
<p>crushed into</p>
<p>your body and if god forbid you have a middle seat</p>
<p>you walk out with scoliosis for the rest of your life</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to see</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s horrible back there</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna we should</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>this is great though</p>
<p>anyway back to this wikileaks dude</p>
<p>i think it takes a certain type of hubris</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the average person is not</p>
<p>going to do this</p>
<p>they probably</p>
<p>never thought someone</p>
<p>would be so bold as to do something that</p>
<p>would most surely get them</p>
<p>arrested and they</p>
<p>gonna be very little public outcry</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s gonna get locked up for a long ass time</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s gonna be a</p>
<p>bunch of reasons why they&rsquo;re locking him up and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna rot him out they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna rot him out and sell somewhere</p>
<p>illegal access to sensitive data top secret</p>
<p>information they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>yeah espionage espionage</p>
<p>well is it espionage when you&rsquo;re not a us</p>
<p>citizen what is it</p>
<p>well no he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>apparently it isn&rsquo;t like there&rsquo;s all these basic</p>
<p>laws that govern</p>
<p>these things and</p>
<p>and if it was espionage and if it what</p>
<p>truly was espionage you</p>
<p>for certain the united</p>
<p>states this next day it came out</p>
<p>would be like we&rsquo;re arresting him</p>
<p>right but the united states now i was like</p>
<p>probably an entire warehouse full of lawyers</p>
<p>looking through</p>
<p>every line of</p>
<p>law desperately trying to cobble together a reason</p>
<p>they can legally</p>
<p>bring him back into the empire</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>dangerous because all the information is out now and</p>
<p>so much has been</p>
<p>learned about the way</p>
<p>the government interacts with</p>
<p>other governments about</p>
<p>how they feel about</p>
<p>other countries</p>
<p>about all this</p>
<p>secret information that they have access to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of shit that got out man</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t close that up you know</p>
<p>and also that</p>
<p>little thorn in the lion&rsquo;s paw is that insurance policy</p>
<p>you know you know</p>
<p>that is that is drawing some beads of</p>
<p>sweat from the heads of many reptilians</p>
<p>right now like</p>
<p>what could it be</p>
<p>you think he&rsquo;s telling them you</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s told them yet what it is</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>given him a hint or two</p>
<p>weird code words</p>
<p>green dragon</p>
<p>can they kill him at this point</p>
<p>after all this can they kill him</p>
<p>well i think</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why that&rsquo;s to me the thing</p>
<p>about if you did turn himself into me it&rsquo;s like man</p>
<p>well you better not be</p>
<p>drinking the water</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if you really trust</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just giving you like</p>
<p>whatever the normal</p>
<p>salami sandwiches</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re giving prisoners and they&rsquo;re not giving you</p>
<p>a patty of spam</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s composed of nano bots designed to swim into the</p>
<p>score of your</p>
<p>brain and explode in five years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you think and the guy&rsquo;s got a little</p>
<p>a little like widget on his computer</p>
<p>clock till junior</p>
<p>down down still a scientist head explodes in the cia</p>
<p>knows exactly</p>
<p>clocks on everyone&rsquo;s computer and he they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>gonna be there when it happens</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna invite him somewhere</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be like he won the lottery or something or</p>
<p>stand there</p>
<p>trying to collect</p>
<p>big fucking stupid</p>
<p>smile on his face</p>
<p>and that his</p>
<p>head will explode it&rsquo;ll be when he wins the nobel</p>
<p>prize and it&rsquo;ll happen on the fourth of july</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll happen oh look at this she&rsquo;s coming by with this</p>
<p>oh my goodness</p>
<p>i wish we could keep this podcast</p>
<p>going but she&rsquo;s coming by with ice cream</p>
<p>and cookies</p>
<p>yeah yeah ice</p>
<p>cream and cookies yeah</p>
<p>whoops thank you</p>
<p>oh my goodness</p>
<p>and with that</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the end of part two</p>
<p>these are short podcasts</p>
<p>if you if you only commute to work and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>twenty minutes</p>
<p>is a perfect podcast for you</p>
