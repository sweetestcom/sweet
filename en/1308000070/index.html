    <p>So live from an undisclosed location with the sultry filter on</p>
<p>Very sultry filter on</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Having a great hair day. Yeah, that is a good hair day for you. Great hair day my pal and</p>
<p>Your favorite CEO and Twitter, mr. Elon Musk. How you doing, pal?</p>
<p>Brain man David</p>
<p>Appreciate you coming to the event and are coming zooming in. Yeah, what&rsquo;s new in your world?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see, um, I guess right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of debating the number of bots on Twitter</p>
<p>Bra on Twitter</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;d like to what what&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m being told is that the there&rsquo;s just no way to know the number of bots</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like as unknowable as the human soul, basically</p>
<p>Witchcraft and alchemy is needed to determine these</p>
<p>Said like why don&rsquo;t try calling people, but I haven&rsquo;t got a response, you know, like if you try calling people or something, you know</p>
<p>like maybe</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know but I think like that would be one of the things to do to say like</p>
<p>Have you tried calling them as opposed to trying to read the tea leaves here that&rsquo;s like impossible, you know</p>
<p>Obviously you can have an account that looks exactly like a human account or is being operated where one person is operating a thousand accounts</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>But that person can only buy one toaster. They&rsquo;re gonna buy a thousand toasters</p>
<p>So you care about like number of unique real people that are on the system?</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely fundamental and anyone who uses Twitter is well aware that</p>
<p>The the comment the comment threads are are full of spam spam and and</p>
<p>just a lot of you know, fake accounts, so</p>
<p>it seems</p>
<p>Beyond beyond reasonable for Twitter to claim that the number of</p>
<p>Essentially the number of real said another way the number of real unique humans</p>
<p>That you see making comments on a daily basis on Twitter is above 95%</p>
<p>That is what they&rsquo;re claiming. Does anyone have that experience?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bridge I&rsquo;d like to sell you, you know</p>
<p>You can buy the Brooklyn Bridge</p>
<p>Um, what do you think it is what yeah, what&rsquo;s it what&rsquo;s the I mean and it&rsquo;s not 5% What is it?</p>
<p>Um, I think it&rsquo;s a number that is probably at least four or five times that number, but I&rsquo;d say it at</p>
<p>if you did sort of the</p>
<p>The lowest estimate would be probably 20%</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>And this and this is a bunch of</p>
<p>Quite smart outside firms have done analysis of Twitter and</p>
<p>Looked at the the sort of daily daily users and their conclusion is also about is about 20% but that&rsquo;s a lower bound</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an upper bound</p>
<p>if you look at say</p>
<p>the most liked tweets on Twitter</p>
<p>So I I have the honor of</p>
<p>having the most liked tweet of any living human</p>
<p>This is</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for liking my tweet</p>
<p>Including you both with some of the bots out there</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>That tweet is less than 5 million likes</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like four point seven or something like that and hit that that was the where I tweeted about</p>
<p>That next time buying coca-cola to put the cocaine back in</p>
<p>Definitely there&rsquo;s clearly something that the public really wants and</p>
<p>You know coca-cola corporation should really think about going back to their roots</p>
<p>Coca-cola, I mean this this I guess is the reason why our grandparents could sort of walk 20 miles in the snow</p>
<p>They had coca-cola with cocaine this is real reason</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s literally the most popular tweet</p>
<p>of any of any living human and</p>
<p>But Twitter says that the daily money the sort of monetizable daily active users is 217 million</p>
<p>So why would it be that the most popular tweet ever basically is?</p>
<p>Only you know two two and a half percent</p>
<p>This this seems a very very low number</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>And the most popular tweets generally are clustered around that sort of four million</p>
<p>Like level so it&rsquo;s a sort of like basically two percent or less or less than two percent of the</p>
<p>Daily active users and and technically monetizable daily active users is how it proportions</p>
<p>Well actually, you know if you think about it Elon</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a corollary on youtube</p>
<p>What do what&rsquo;s the total user base of youtube and what have the most popular videos gotten there?</p>
<p>Yes, and I think there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a correlation between what&rsquo;s the total user base of youtube and what&rsquo;s the total user base of twitter</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the total user base of youtube and what&rsquo;s the total user base of twitter</p>
<p>What do what&rsquo;s the total user base of youtube and what have the most popular videos gotten there</p>
<p>Yes, and I think there&rsquo;s a billion or two</p>
<p>Maybe a billion people using youtube and those the most popular videos have tens of billions of views. Yes</p>
<p>That might be instructive</p>
<p>Exactly that ratio makes a lot more sense. Um, so</p>
<p>Something doesn&rsquo;t add up here</p>
<p>um, and and my concern is is not that is it like, you know,</p>
<p>Is it five or or seven or eight percent, but is it?</p>
<p>Potentially eighty percent or ninety percent bots</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, is it I mean, I certainly know there&rsquo;s some real people on twitter, but uh, but what&rsquo;s if it?</p>
<p>Is it an order of magnitude?</p>
<p>Is it is it fifty percent instead of five and that&rsquo;s obviously an incredibly material number</p>
<p>especially since twitter</p>
<p>Uh relies primarily on brand advertising as opposed to specific</p>
<p>Click through advertising where you make a purchase if you if you make a purchase</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter that much but for brand advertising, which is really just awareness advertising</p>
<p>It matters if real humans are seeing that or not</p>
<p>yeah, and and so</p>
<p>I guess stepping back for a second people are curious why you want to buy twitter. Why is this so important to you?</p>
<p>And then I guess what are the chances you think the deal gets done at this point so a two-parter</p>
<p>Why is it so important to you, I mean some of this i&rsquo;ve articulated before but I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a need for a a</p>
<p>Public town square digital town square that uh where people can debate, uh issues of all kinds. Um,</p>
<p>including the most substantive issues, um, and in order for</p>
<p>The uh for that to be the case you have to have something that is as broadly inclusive as possible</p>
<p>That has as much of the the people on the platform as possible</p>
<p>uh where it&rsquo;s uh, it feels uh,</p>
<p>Balanced from a political standpoint. Uh, it&rsquo;s not biased one way or the other</p>
<p>and where</p>
<p>The system is transparent</p>
<p>This is why I think it&rsquo;s important to put the algorithm on on github and actually</p>
<p>Allow the public to see it and critique it and improve it</p>
<p>Um, and if there are any manual changes, uh sort of shadow banning as it&rsquo;s called, uh, or</p>
<p>Increasing or decreasing the prominence of a tweet</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s done manually that that should be noted. Uh, so, you know what has happened and it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just where it is right now. We don&rsquo;t know what the heck is going on</p>
<p>Why is one tweet doing well? Why is another tweet not is it is the algorithm that someone manually to intervene?</p>
<p>Uh, why are some accounts banned?</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>with no recourse apparently</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and um, you know, the the reality is uh, that that twitter at this point, you know has</p>
<p>Uh a very far-left bias. Um, and I I would classify myself as as a moderate and you know</p>
<p>Neither republican nor nor democrat. Um, and in fact, uh, I have voted voted overwhelmingly for democrats</p>
<p>Historically overwhelmingly like i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>I might never have voted for republican just to be clear. Right? Um now now this election I will</p>
<p>David you okay?</p>
<p>Keep going, he&rsquo;s fine. He&rsquo;s fine. We&rsquo;re gonna resuscitate him. We&rsquo;re gonna resuscitate david sacks. I mean</p>
<p>Let me ask you a personal point i&rsquo;m trying to make is that this is not some sort of attempt to uh,</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not some right-wing takeover. Um as as say people on the left may fear</p>
<p>but rather a moderate wing takeover, um and an attempt to uh, ensure that that people of of all, uh,</p>
<p>You know political</p>
<p>Beliefs feel welcome on on a digital town square that and they can express</p>
<p>Their their beliefs without fear of being banned or shadow banned. Um,</p>
<p>and and and that we we obviously need to get rid of the bots, uh, and and scams and trolls and people that are operating</p>
<p>uh, huge bot armies and attempt to uh,</p>
<p>Unduly influence the the public opinion. So this is what I think it&rsquo;s very important that we have that like the</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>some of the smartest people in history have</p>
<p>Thought about it and said like free speech is important for a for a healthy democracy. It is important and free speech only matters</p>
<p>Like</p>
<p>Like say when does free speech matter most it&rsquo;s when someone when it&rsquo;s someone you don&rsquo;t like saying something you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s when it actually matters. Um, so</p>
<p>um, you know</p>
<p>Obviously and and and it&rsquo;s pretty annoying when someone you don&rsquo;t like says something you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s bad, but it&rsquo;s actually a good sign of</p>
<p>That that you have free speech</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>So, um, I mean I get trashed by the media all the time. It&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>I do do it twice as much. I couldn&rsquo;t care less</p>
<p>Um, but it&rsquo;s indicative of the fact that even though um, you know, I have like a lot of resources</p>
<p>I do not actually have the ability to stop the media from trashing me and that&rsquo;s actually a good thing</p>
<p>Yeah, I I have to ask. Um with regard to this current administration</p>
<p>I know how hard you work, uh on the car company</p>
<p>And then biden, you know</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a lifelong democrat. You&rsquo;ve donated to obama and to everybody probably never voted republican</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Yet and the same is true for joe rogan. Joe rogan is, you know, a bernie sanders supporter</p>
<p>And that the democratic party has been openly hostile to joe rogan and biden</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t even say the word tesla or invite you to the white house when they do an evie summit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious just on a very personal basis. What does it feel like to have that experience where the party you supported?</p>
<p>Is it won&rsquo;t even say the name of your company or invite you there? They should be celebrating the work you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>yeah, I mean it definitely feels like this is not right like this is</p>
<p>the the issue here is that there&rsquo;s just an</p>
<p>This the democrat party is overly overly controlled by the unions and by the</p>
<p>trial lawyers, particularly the class action, uh lawyers</p>
<p>And generally if you if you&rsquo;ll see something that doesn&rsquo;t that is not in the interest of the of the people</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>On the on the democrat side it&rsquo;s going to come because of the unions, uh, which is just another form of monopoly and the uh,</p>
<p>the trial lawyers, uh</p>
<p>That that&rsquo;s where actions will be happening from the democrat side</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not in the interest of the people and then um to be fair on the republican side</p>
<p>Uh, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s if you say like where is something like not not ideal happening. It&rsquo;s because of corporate evil. Um, and</p>
<p>religious zealotry</p>
<p>Um, but that&rsquo;s generally where the bad things will be coming from on the republican side. Um,</p>
<p>that are not representative of the people so</p>
<p>Um in in the case of biden, he is simply too too much</p>
<p>Uh captured by the unions, um, which was not the case with obama</p>
<p>Um, so in the case of obama, you could have you know, he was sort of quite reasonable</p>
<p>um, and I think he took more of a view of that, you know, obviously you take the</p>
<p>Concerns of the unions into account, but uh, there are bigger issues at stake and and unfortunately biden does not do that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have a i have a tesla question. I read today. It&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>There was a bloomberg article that said the following so the setup is this</p>
<p>It said since you went public tesla&rsquo;s up twenty two thousand percent</p>
<p>uh, eleven quarters of profit sequential profitability, so hitting on all cylinders, but the</p>
<p>public analysts</p>
<p>Absolutely, that&rsquo;s a car joke. That&rsquo;s a combustion</p>
<p>Stepping on the gas pedal firing</p>
<p>But analysts, uh when they put out their projections</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of the most enormous bans for any company in america the the price targets for tesla despite all of this success</p>
<p>Some have it at 200 some have it at 1600. It&rsquo;s all over the place you tweeted</p>
<p>Uh a couple months ago tesla&rsquo;s not a company. It&rsquo;s like six companies inside of a company like you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe more can you just explain to people</p>
<p>All these companies inside this super company just so folks have a sense of what had to be done to get here</p>
<p>Okay, I mean this this question requires thought and i&rsquo;ll probably be leaving out uh quite a few things</p>
<p>But if you look at say what what does a typical?</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>car company do</p>
<p>uh, what what they do is they they um</p>
<p>They they assemble vehicles</p>
<p>Um, and they send them to dealers and they manage the supply chain</p>
<p>Uh, the the they might make the engine, uh, typically we&rsquo;ll make the engine but most of the parts are made by suppliers</p>
<p>Um, and a lot of the actual technology development is done by suppliers and most most of this vehicle software is done by suppliers</p>
<p>So the actual amount of uh real work done by car companies that what you think of sort of like a gm or ford is</p>
<p>Not actually that much</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And but like so they don&rsquo;t do they don&rsquo;t do uh sales. They don&rsquo;t do service. Um,</p>
<p>They uh, so in the case of tesla, for example, we we do we we do our own sales and service</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have dealerships, um</p>
<p>then uh</p>
<p>Tesla also has by far the biggest network of superchargers sort of the electric equivalent of gas stations</p>
<p>So we built an entire global supercharger network, which is still the most advanced and by far the best</p>
<p>way to charge your car when traveling long distance or if you live in a city, um, and uh,</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t have the ability to charge your car. There&rsquo;s a street parking or an apartment</p>
<p>So the whole supercharger network we developed the supercharger network</p>
<p>We deployed it. I think we have</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know 15 000 superchargers globally. Um</p>
<p>You can travel anywhere in america right now with uh,</p>
<p>the tesla supercharger network</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>then, uh in terms of vertical integration, uh, we</p>
<p>uh, we make the the battery pack, uh, the the power electronics the drive unit, um,</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>We actually make we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re more integrated in in the parts. We actually make so much of the car, uh internally</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re vertically integrated, um, not necessarily because we just we think that there&rsquo;s some religious reason to be vertically integrated, but because</p>
<p>The pace at which we needed to move was just much faster than the supply chain could move and to the degree that you</p>
<p>Inherit the legacy supply chain you inherit the legacy constraints including their speed, uh cost and uh and technology</p>
<p>And then tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company</p>
<p>So the software that runs in tesla operates the car operates the screen</p>
<p>Uh does the charging?</p>
<p>All of that stuff is developed by tesla</p>
<p>and um, so we have sort of a car a tesla os in the car when you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been gone for a long time and then very importantly, uh,</p>
<p>tesla has built a</p>
<p>an</p>
<p>An autopilot ai team from scratch. Uh, that is the best real world ai team on earth</p>
<p>Um, and if anyone else has got a better one, i&rsquo;d like to see it demonstrated in a car</p>
<p>um the</p>
<p>the full self-driving beta at this point, uh,</p>
<p>can</p>
<p>Very often take you with zero interventions across the bay area from san jose to marin</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Through complex traffic. It&rsquo;s really quite sophisticated</p>
<p>Um and invite anyone to to join the beta or look at the videos of those who are in the beta</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got like a hundred thousand people in the beta</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not tiny and we&rsquo;ll be expanding that to I don&rsquo;t probably a million people or a million</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know on that order by the end of the year. So</p>
<p>um, it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>You had this slide</p>
<p>We also we also built a chip team too because there wasn&rsquo;t it wasn&rsquo;t hardware that we could run the friggin</p>
<p>uh ai on</p>
<p>Uh, we couldn&rsquo;t just fill the trunk with a whole bunch of gpus. Um, and and</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>Like they would have taken a trunk full of gpus</p>
<p>That would have been very expensive and take massive amount of power and cooling</p>
<p>Uh, just to be able to do what the tesla designed, uh, full self-driving computer can do</p>
<p>So and we started a chip team from scratch designed it</p>
<p>It was the best in the world and still is the best in the world several years later. Um,</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re also then developed we&rsquo;re designing a dojo, uh supercomputer to be able to process the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>all the video that&rsquo;s coming in from billions of miles of data because</p>
<p>Just sort of like the way that that it&rsquo;s pretty cool to compete with google because they have so much data</p>
<p>And they have all the people doing searches all the time and humanity is training it</p>
<p>But the same is true of tesla. You really need billions of miles ultimately tens of billions of miles of training data combined with</p>
<p>Sort of a vast training computer and then uh optimize</p>
<p>uh inference hardware in the car</p>
<p>Um and state-of-the-art ai and training and specialized software across the board to be able to achieve a full self-driving solution</p>
<p>I uh, I just thought</p>
<p>That when when he opened tesla gigafactory remember this six or seven years ago</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell the audience&rsquo;s story quickly ilan. He puts a slide up there and he says guys. We&rsquo;re not actually building</p>
<p>A factory we&rsquo;re building a machine that makes machines and he puts the layout of the factory and it looks like a chip</p>
<p>And it was basically like how you would actually lay out a microchip if you were or you know</p>
<p>You were like a layout engineer. It was the craziest thing i&rsquo;d ever seen</p>
<p>I was like that was when I first got it</p>
<p>Yeah, you know you walk on 10 and you see what&rsquo;s happening and you have an insurance company now</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing insurance for tesla owners and an uber competitor, right and eventually a robo taxi uber competitor. All right, babe</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean insurance is not quite significant now. Are you okay? I&rsquo;m, okay. Okay</p>
<p>This the the car insurance thing is a bigger deal that may seem a lot of people are paying. Um,</p>
<p>You know 30 40 percent as much as their lease payment for the car in in car insurance</p>
<p>um, so the car insurance industry is incredibly inefficient because they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>first of all, you got like so many, um sort of middle entities you&rsquo;ve got you&rsquo;ve got from an insurance agent all the way to</p>
<p>The final sort of reinsurer there&rsquo;s like a half dozen companies each taking a cut. Um, and then uh the</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very statistical so that there&rsquo;s um, even if you&rsquo;re a very good driver like you could be like, you know</p>
<p>20 years old and a great driver, but they</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all statistical so you can&rsquo;t get you either can&rsquo;t get insurance or it&rsquo;s extremely expensive. Um,</p>
<p>So but tesla allows for real-time insurance based on how you actually drive the car</p>
<p>Um, you can actually if you drive the car</p>
<p>in a safer way you actually</p>
<p>Have lower insurance. So ours is is insurance is based on how you actually drive not how</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>historically people that you know</p>
<p>Fit your whatever demographic have drive. It&rsquo;s and then you can close the loop around your uh,</p>
<p>insurance rate by simply driving better and looking at your score</p>
<p>And and and lowering your assurance in real time and people do it actually promotes safer driving</p>
<p>I actually have had this experience because</p>
<p>In my household two people drive my car and one of them has a 93 score and the other one</p>
<p>Does not they have like a 60 score?</p>
<p>And um, you may have met this other person, but uh, i&rsquo;ve been trying to work with her on the aggressive turns and stops</p>
<p>in advance</p>
<p>of our insurance bill, uh</p>
<p>Which we&rsquo;re hoping will go down at some point</p>
<p>Um, you didn&rsquo;t oh the one question are</p>
<p>Is this twitter deal going to get closed you think what are the chances here?</p>
<p>Well, I mean it really depends on on a lot of factors here</p>
<p>um, i&rsquo;m still waiting for uh, some sort of</p>
<p>Logical explanation for the number of sort of fake or spam accounts on twitter</p>
<p>And twitter is refusing to tell us. Uh, so</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>This just seems like a strange thing. Um</p>
<p>Wait, sorry is are they refusing to tell you or you don&rsquo;t think they really know? I mean</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good chance. They may just have no idea</p>
<p>They claim that they do know</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>And they claim that they&rsquo;ve got this complex methodology</p>
<p>Uh that only they can understand</p>
<p>But the guy who landed two rockets</p>
<p>This cauldron and then you throw them</p>
<p>Cogsworth</p>
<p>And then suddenly it comes to you in a dream, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But there should be some uh</p>
<p>You know objective way to set the uh thing because this is a this is a material public state threshold issue. Yeah</p>
<p>It you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a you know, it&rsquo;s a material adverse. Uh,</p>
<p>misstatement, uh, you know if if they in fact, uh have been</p>
<p>Um vociferously claiming less than five percent</p>
<p>Of fake or spam accounts, but in fact it is four or five times that number or perhaps ten times that number</p>
<p>This is a big deal. Um, it&rsquo;s not this it seemed like if you said, okay</p>
<p>um, i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>I agree to buy your house. You say the house has less than five percent termites</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s an acceptable number. But if it turns out it is 90 termites, that&rsquo;s uh,</p>
<p>Not okay, you know, it&rsquo;s not the same house. Um</p>
<p>This house is made mostly of termite</p>
<p>Leave it literally your house will disappear because it&rsquo;s mostly made in two months</p>
<p>um, so</p>
<p>You know that that would obviously just not be appropriate</p>
<p>So in in making the twitter offer I was obviously reliant upon the the truth and accuracy of their public filings</p>
<p>if those those filings are not accurate, it&rsquo;s simply</p>
<p>Not that that&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not you you can&rsquo;t pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed</p>
<p>And you know they say elon life&rsquo;s a negotiation so at a different price it might be a totally viable deal, correct</p>
<p>I mean that</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not out of the question. Um</p>
<p>But I really would you know, this is you know, the more the more questions I ask the more I the more my concerns</p>
<p>uh grow, um, so</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>You know at the end of the day</p>
<p>Acquiring it has to be fixable</p>
<p>um and and fixable that we are with</p>
<p>With reasonable time frame and without revenues collapsing along the way and all that sort of stuff. Um,</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>You know, I I really need to see</p>
<p>how</p>
<p>These things are being calculated and and it can&rsquo;t be some deep mystery that is like more complex than the human soul or something like</p>
<p>That um, it&rsquo;s got to be you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s I think we can apply the scientific method to this and try to figure out what&rsquo;s really going on</p>
<p>And um, you know twitter&rsquo;s revenue is is is primarily dependent</p>
<p>I think 70 or some that order on brand advertising as opposed to specific purchase advertising</p>
<p>This is a big deal because brand advertising is not there&rsquo;s not a there&rsquo;s not a purchase that results from that</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically, you know, how much mind share or like basically if you&rsquo;re a big company</p>
<p>How often do they hear your name?</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s as opposed to something that where you can directly measure the outcome</p>
<p>um, so that that means that they&rsquo;re somewhat going on faith, um,</p>
<p>And if that faith is undermined or reduced because of the reality of the situation coming to the fore</p>
<p>then the</p>
<p>tesla&rsquo;s revenue or twitter</p>
<p>The twitter&rsquo;s revenue</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Will be uh significantly impaired and that&rsquo;s a major problem</p>
<p>Elon did you have a chance to ask these questions during your negotiation?</p>
<p>Uh</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>Like I said, I was reliant upon their public filings</p>
<p>so to the degree that their public and this is normal for a public company if you</p>
<p>You know if if you make a formal filing, um</p>
<p>That that that is what investors are relying upon or relying on whether they are making an acquisition offer or simply buying some shares</p>
<p>So this this this the accuracy of these filings is important whether you&rsquo;re buying one share or the whole company</p>
<p>um, and so if these filings are inaccurate or if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Sort of potentially blatant. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>Deal, you know, I do have a sense of why this has been such a persistent problem for twitter</p>
<p>Do they not have the technical capabilities to solve the the bot problem?</p>
<p>Or is it more of like just uh, they&rsquo;ve underprioritized the issue or been unwilling to because potentially their implications for</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>revenue</p>
<p>I I I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s sort of speculative at this point. So the you know, the the uh,</p>
<p>The worst interpretation would be that they don&rsquo;t want to look too closely at the thing because they might not like the answer</p>
<p>That would be the worst interpretation. Um, but the bet i&rsquo;m not sure what the best interpretation is, but the least bad interpretation would be</p>
<p>Maybe they thought it was this way</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re the way they were doing it was wrong and they didn&rsquo;t realize they were mistaken and simply weren&rsquo;t paying enough attention</p>
<p>Um, it does seem as though it should be a lot easier to get rid of the bots and and spam and trolls</p>
<p>Then uh, like this is not some we&rsquo;re not trying to split the atom here, you know</p>
<p>Uh, we&rsquo;re not trying to get to the moon. Okay, we&rsquo;re just trying to</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Limit the amount of obviously scammy accounts</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>bitcoin giveaway, um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>probably it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a spammer, you know, like</p>
<p>it does</p>
<p>Maybe you know, wait, you&rsquo;re not giving away a hundred bitcoins. I just sent you ten</p>
<p>If if you send me two bitcoin i&rsquo;ll send you one back, all right, that&rsquo;s my what if I send you 20</p>
<p>Actually, um, I thought one of the interesting things that came up in your product roadmap</p>
<p>Or I guess this was released and people covered it was the um</p>
<p>possibility of twitter becoming kind of a super app with</p>
<p>Payments included, um, maybe perhaps even doge or something</p>
<p>This seems to me, uh based on your work with with david at paypal like a pretty brilliant idea</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the vision there in terms of if you were able to buy it, you know, perhaps at the right price</p>
<p>Um, what would it look like if you know, I could add jason to add elon musk, you know</p>
<p>10 bucks or something if you know, we were splitting a check or something</p>
<p>sure, well</p>
<p>For those that have used wechat. I think that&rsquo;s wechat&rsquo;s actually a good model</p>
<p>Um, if you&rsquo;re in china, it&rsquo;s basically you kind of live on wechat. It does everything</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like twitter plus paypal plus a whole bunch of other things and or roll into one with actually a great interface</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really an excellent app</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have anything like that. Um outside of china. So</p>
<p>Uh, I think it&rsquo;s such a such an app. Um would be really, uh useful. Um, and</p>
<p>it just like the utility of it, uh of of sort of a</p>
<p>a spam free thing where you could you can make comments you can post videos you can</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s important for content creators to have a revenue share</p>
<p>Um now now this this does not need to be done on twitter. It could be done from something that&rsquo;s created from scratch</p>
<p>So it could be something new</p>
<p>um, so really but I think this thing needs to exist whether it is</p>
<p>converting twitter to</p>
<p>be the sort of like</p>
<p>Kind of all-encompassing app that that like I said everything from digital town square where important ideas are debated</p>
<p>Uh, you know maximally trusted and inclusive</p>
<p>And at a point where you sort of have a high trust situation then then payments, uh, whether it&rsquo;s crypto or fiat</p>
<p>Uh can make a lot of sense</p>
<p>Just we just want something that&rsquo;s incredibly useful and that people love using</p>
<p>um, so</p>
<p>That that but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s either convert twitter to that or start something new. Those are the two</p>
<p>But it does need to happen somehow</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting you bring that up because the price of twitter</p>
<p>Um is pretty high and you&rsquo;ve built a couple of companies and some engineers like to come work for you</p>
<p>Um, and you&rsquo;ve now gone through the intellectual exercise of studying all this</p>
<p>Um, if you&rsquo;re looking at the two choices now fixing twitter given all these problems and maybe just starting your own version</p>
<p>Which one are you leaning towards because it I have watched you build a couple of companies and the products have turned out pretty good</p>
<p>so is it easier for someone like you to just start from scratch, I mean</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s certainly the</p>
<p>My my default inclination is to start things from scratch</p>
<p>Uh, I mean, i&rsquo;m not really I don&rsquo;t buy things like there&rsquo;s still this sort of you know, uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Yeah, like like spacex was started from scratch</p>
<p>You know in the case of tesla, uh, you know</p>
<p>It was like five people</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still this guy mart eberhard</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the worst guy i&rsquo;ve ever worked with who tries to claim like sole credit essentially for?</p>
<p>Creating tesla and if he&rsquo;s so damn great, why don&rsquo;t you just go, you know create another car company when he was fired?</p>
<p>um, but anyway</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a pretty good story. I mean, yeah</p>
<p>I remember because he&rsquo;s a sad I mean no, but I remember having this conversation with you</p>
<p>We were having a conversation about the roadster. I think I can tell this story</p>
<p>I said, how&rsquo;s it going pal? And you said well, I got one problem</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>It turns out the roadster parts and putting it together cost a hundred ninety thousand</p>
<p>Yeah, and I said I gave you 150 for number 16</p>
<p>So if you make 2000 of these you&rsquo;re going to lose 80 million dollars and you were like, yeah or double that</p>
<p>I mean they basically</p>
<p>The parts of the car cost more than they were selling it for when you were starting to get involved. That&rsquo;s it was this</p>
<p>No, I got involved well before that before that. Yes</p>
<p>When twitter when tesla was was nothing but a piece of paper. Let me be crystal clear crystal fucking clear</p>
<p>Uh, no, they didn&rsquo;t bring me in</p>
<p>Either</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>I I was gonna start I was gonna start an ev company with jv struggle</p>
<p>And uh based on the the ac propulsion t0</p>
<p>And when I when I asked ac propulsion if it was okay to do that</p>
<p>Uh, they said well, there&rsquo;s also some others who want to create an ev company, but have not created one yet</p>
<p>Yes, would you like to join forces with them? And I said, okay. Well, we&rsquo;ll do that</p>
<p>That was a huge mistake jv and I should have just started the car company ourselves instead</p>
<p>Uh, we uh teamed up with uh, evahod topping and right</p>
<p>um big mistake, uh, the the the actual moral error here was me trying to have my cake and eat it too, which is like</p>
<p>I just want to work on the technology and the product</p>
<p>and have someone else be the ceo and and and sort of run the business operations because I just like working on technology and</p>
<p>product and design and um</p>
<p>And and also I was like doing spacex, uh, you know at the time in our orchestra blowing up so it seemed like uh,</p>
<p>Okay, this is like I always wanted to an electric car company. This is how I can have my cake and eat it, too</p>
<p>Uh, that was a huge mistake and fundamentally a moral error. Um,</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>so so uh</p>
<p>In the end I had to friggin be ceo and I didn&rsquo;t want to be basically. Um,</p>
<p>uh, so but it&rsquo;s either that or the company&rsquo;s gonna die so, uh, so we started with really just nothing and uh,</p>
<p>The uh, you know the the t0 prototype from ac propulsion not not it. That&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the precursor to tesla. Um,</p>
<p>One half second clear once again, uh when uh, we created tesla</p>
<p>When I when I joined there were no employees. There was no intellectual property. There was no prototype. There was no nothing. Yeah</p>
<p>crystal fucking clear</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>It almost bankrupted you I mean you yes that sent you to the cliff</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>I mean, yes, we&rsquo;re on the ragged edge of bankruptcy so many times it was ridiculous. Um,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um, I want 2008 was one of the worst years where basically the</p>
<p>you know, gm and ford just a gm gm and</p>
<p>Ford almost went bankrupt</p>
<p>And um, you know trying to raise money for a startup electric car company in 2008 while gm was going bankrupt was uh,</p>
<p>Difficult to say the least. Um</p>
<p>You know people were angry that I even asked them, uh for money</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like fuck you and hang up</p>
<p>So the only way that that that tesla actually made it through 2008 was uh a subset of the existing investors</p>
<p>um, which includes like people like antonio gracias and uh, you know, um, steve jovenson and</p>
<p>And a few other key people our aaron price. Uh,</p>
<p>Who who I&rsquo;ve hold a debtor gratitude to the state?</p>
<p>Um, and and I I put in all the money I had left and they said</p>
<p>Everything literally everything. Um, uh, I didn&rsquo;t even have a house. Uh, so</p>
<p>Uh, this is my ex-wife at the house</p>
<p>So I was like staying actually in jeff skull&rsquo;s bedroom a spare bedroom</p>
<p>Um and and but there was the the uh</p>
<p>The subset of the besters would say okay</p>
<p>If I put in they&rsquo;re putting as much as I put in so I put in everything. Um, and and then we closed that round 6 p.m</p>
<p>uh christmas eve 2008</p>
<p>It was last hour of the last day that was possible because after that people were like I break it for the holidays</p>
<p>And we would have bounced payroll two days after christmas</p>
<p>it was uh</p>
<p>Pretty that&rsquo;s doorstep. I mean it was an incredible moment in time and people also forget at the time</p>
<p>that the first two rockets spacex sent up, uh didn&rsquo;t exactly make it to orbit like</p>
<p>The first three and</p>
<p>I remember having dinner with you at that time and I asked you. Hey, how&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>I heard your gawker says you got four weeks of payroll left and you said that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>And I said thank god and you said we have two</p>
<p>And I said</p>
<p>I said no, I mean</p>
<p>Both spacex and tesla in 2008 if we&rsquo;d simply paid our suppliers on time, we would have gone bankrupt immediately</p>
<p>Tell us tell us actually, uh</p>
<p>It was it was a pretty crazy moment because I also remember asking you at we were having dinner at boa and I said</p>
<p>Well, certainly there&rsquo;s got to be some good news</p>
<p>And you took out your blackberry to date the conversation. I don&rsquo;t remember it. Oh, yeah</p>
<p>And you said don&rsquo;t tell anybody jake how I said no problem and you showed me the clay version of the model s</p>
<p>Yeah, the most beautiful car i&rsquo;d ever seen and I said</p>
<p>Oh my god, it&rsquo;s stunning. Um, how much is it going to cost?</p>
<p>He said I think I can make it for 50 000. I remember it was yesterday</p>
<p>I said if you make that car for 50 000, you&rsquo;ll change the fucking world and you did it</p>
<p>And it was a little more than 50 000, but uh, yeah</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Has your</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask about spaces. Okay. Well, that&rsquo;s what space but I want to ask one more personal question has life gotten</p>
<p>Easier for you as these companies have hit scale or has the complexity</p>
<p>Made life even more challenging because those early days it was just fighting to survive</p>
<p>Nobody knew who you were you were anonymous</p>
<p>And it was really just about the work and now</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it you&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s most famous guy</p>
<p>Um, and everybody&rsquo;s watching everything you do, but these companies are also very big</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s life like for you today? Are you enjoying what you&rsquo;re doing every day?</p>
<p>Um, well, I mean it&rsquo;s somewhat of a roller coaster, um, so there are like good days and bad days, um,</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s there are also crisis issues</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and you know, like sort of, you know, knock on wood like we&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Facing, you know death in the face like like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s definitely like quite stressful when like, you know</p>
<p>Death is like trying to eat your face off and like the foam is like, you know, just kidding</p>
<p>And like yeah</p>
<p>Right there, you know</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty stressful in that situation</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so like right, you know, both spacex and tesla have um,</p>
<p>You know significant cash reserves so like</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not we&rsquo;re staring death in the face. We can sort of see it over in the horizon</p>
<p>you know, so I don&rsquo;t want to get complacent or entitled because um, but but if it&rsquo;s not like just sort of</p>
<p>Foaming at the mouth and gnashing trying to eat your face off on a daily basis</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s certainly we&rsquo;ve moved on from that point. Um, and hopefully never never return. Um,</p>
<p>but but there are a lot of issues that need to be it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>Like the if you&rsquo;re a ceo of a company the chore level is high and if you don&rsquo;t do your chores</p>
<p>Then the company goes to hell and I hate doing chores frankly. So, uh, who do who does? Uh,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the real</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of sort of uh, you know personnel issues and legal issues and and and things that I I</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find enjoyable to work on but if I don&rsquo;t work on them the company suffers so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like</p>
<p>Just the sheer volume of work is insane. That&rsquo;s the uh,</p>
<p>And then and then you know go do something go add to it with you know, twitter or something like that</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean honestly my extra processor</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean</p>
<p>I I have a habit of biting off more than I can chew and then just sitting there with like chipmunk cheeks</p>
<p>Tell us uh, you know, tell us a little bit about where we are at spacex like how</p>
<p>You fund the ability to go to mars, but then also commercially still build</p>
<p>A conventional space business domestically. I think this russia thing was probably really good for spacex</p>
<p>If you want to just tell us a little bit about that</p>
<p>Sure, um, well the the</p>
<p>I mean the goal of spacex is to develop the technology that enables life to become multi-planetary. Um, and</p>
<p>you know and make humanity a space-faring civilization, which I think is</p>
<p>very exciting</p>
<p>Inspiring thing and it&rsquo;s like some one of those things where you can that I think</p>
<p>Just makes kids like be excited about the future</p>
<p>And and we need things that are inspiring and exciting and make the future seem like it&rsquo;s going to be better than the past</p>
<p>Life can&rsquo;t just be about solving one miserable problem after another</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got to be like like what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s inspiring and exciting and I think that a future where we are space-faring civilization</p>
<p>is is one that we can all get excited about um,</p>
<p>And and we can go out there and find out what what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s out there in the universe</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the meaning of life and you know, where are the aliens and hopefully they&rsquo;re friendly and that kind of thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so, uh</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting I do get asked about the aliens question a lot and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not seen any evidence of aliens. Um, and i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll be the first to you know</p>
<p>Tweet about it or whatever if I found if I see something, I mean you&rsquo;ll tell us if you find them</p>
<p>I will tell you I I will definitely tell you if there&rsquo;s aliens. Um,</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>You know, uh, I think it&rsquo;d be quite helpful for you know</p>
<p>Like like if we found aliens</p>
<p>Like probably spacex would get a ton more revenue because people like oh man aliens</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to upgrade our space technology pronto was what if you&rsquo;re unfriendly, you know?</p>
<p>um, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know, uh</p>
<p>Is the idea that you build, um,</p>
<p>basically the ability to do</p>
<p>orbital</p>
<p>Cargo take all those profits</p>
<p>Launch starlink take all those profits and move it all into building something that can get to mars. Is that the kind of rough?</p>
<p>plan</p>
<p>Pretty much. It&rsquo;s if it was like a three step three slide powerpoint it would be</p>
<p>pretty much as you described which is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Develop rockets that are that are capable of taking satellites to orbit and crew to the space station</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>You know basically servicing government commercial space launch needs. Um, and then uh,</p>
<p>Build a global communication system in space</p>
<p>Uh that obviously it does a lot of good for earth by providing internet connectivity internet connectivity to the least served</p>
<p>Because a satellite system is really great for remote locations</p>
<p>And you know countryside or or remote islands or or places where someone&rsquo;s trying to cut off their internet</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>As a prelude to a war we take them</p>
<p>System like in star wars. Yeah. Yeah, so it&rsquo;s like, you know, so it can be pretty pretty helpful</p>
<p>Like I think like a starlink basically I think is a a sort of forceful grid in its own, right?</p>
<p>um by providing uh</p>
<p>Connectivity to the the least served where they&rsquo;ve got either no connection or a very expensive or poor connection. Uh, you know, um</p>
<p>The like we&rsquo;re like we&rsquo;re connecting a lot of schools remote schools in brazil right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually gonna be gonna be headed there, uh to sort of kick things off</p>
<p>Um, but they&rsquo;ve got a lot of schools that have no connectivity at all and in a modern age</p>
<p>Uh, how do you learn with no connectivity? I mean you get I guess old textbooks and stuff, but it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>um, you&rsquo;re at a huge disadvantage if you um have no digital connectivity, um,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just a lot of good that starlink can do</p>
<p>In it just by by itself</p>
<p>but but then the the revenue generated from starlink is what can enable the uh conclusion of a permanently</p>
<p>Uh crude base on the moon, which would be the next, you know</p>
<p>Next step from apollo which is like let&rsquo;s just not go there for a few hours and and then head back</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a permanently occupied like science station</p>
<p>on the moon</p>
<p>Um, and we could also build um some pretty epic, uh telescopes, uh on the moon</p>
<p>Uh that uh would enable us to learn more about the nature of the universe and and figure out what&rsquo;s going on and maybe detect</p>
<p>those aliens</p>
<p>um, do you</p>
<p>Do you um, do you think that there&rsquo;s enough profit in those businesses to fund all this or do you need?</p>
<p>Wall street and other investors to come share the load with you</p>
<p>Is going to mars a partnership with the government? Does it need to partner with governments to get there?</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Well, I think technically it does not need to partner with governments. Um, but of course, uh government support would be helpful. Um,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s going to be very expensive to</p>
<p>Build a self-sustaining city on mars like in order for us to become multi-planetary in a way that&rsquo;s meaningful. Um, the the key threshold is</p>
<p>At which point does the city become?</p>
<p>Self-sustaining such that if the ships from earth stopped coming for any reason</p>
<p>And it could be any reason could be world war three or it could be just, you know, civilization subsided</p>
<p>And um, and and just gradually got decrepit or something</p>
<p>But but if the ships stop coming if the resupply ships from earth stop coming to mars for any reason</p>
<p>Does the city still survive?</p>
<p>And and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s like really a large base of resources that are that that are needed</p>
<p>Uh on mars you can&rsquo;t be missing any one critical ingredient</p>
<p>Uh, so and and you think of this like there are these various great filters</p>
<p>Um, you know that that perhaps stop civilizations</p>
<p>Um, and one of the great filters is will we become a multi-planet species or not? Will humanity be one of those?</p>
<p>Species that passes the great filter of going beyond one planet and being a multi-planet species</p>
<p>And this is certainly something we will have to do at some point because this the sun is expanding and will eventually boil the oceans</p>
<p>And destroy all life on earth</p>
<p>So if you care about life on earth, you should really care about life becoming multi-planetary and ultimately multi-stellar because otherwise</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically saying you&rsquo;re signing the the sort of death warrant for all life as we know it. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s inevitable</p>
<p>um, and then there&rsquo;s also the the various things that kill off the you know, the dinosaurs and and</p>
<p>I mean if you look at the fossil record, there have been five major extinctions</p>
<p>Uh that are sort of on the order of 89 80 to 90 percent of all creatures on earth dying</p>
<p>um for for a wide range of reasons, um</p>
<p>but uh, and then humans can also you know with us the world war three danger, um that</p>
<p>That that other creatures didn&rsquo;t have where we could do ourselves in</p>
<p>um by sort of misusing advanced technology and and sort of just you know, having some</p>
<p>Radioactive hellhole, that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left after world war three. So</p>
<p>um, you know, it won&rsquo;t you could even characterize it potentially as which will come first world war three or</p>
<p>life becoming multi-planetary on mars</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry, I was gonna shift but um, you know when you think about the importance of going to mars versus</p>
<p>solving critical energy and climate change problems here on earth, obviously the effort with tesla is related to</p>
<p>sustainable energy</p>
<p>And I think going back to like probably the 1950s there were engineering designs around plasma fusion or fusion based systems that have evolved</p>
<p>To these plasma systems to these tokamak systems</p>
<p>And every year every decade it&rsquo;s like hey next decade. We&rsquo;re going to have it</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your point of view?</p>
<p>On where plasma fusion systems are are we going to have fusion energy?</p>
<p>This century this decade and does it create limitless energy where the electricity production goes up by ten thousand fold?</p>
<p>And the price of electricity drops by ten thousand fold</p>
<p>And then what does that world on earth look like if that happens?</p>
<p>So I guess question is like is that technology real?</p>
<p>When does it happen and what happens to the world here when and if that happens?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer that question, but then i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>Let me sort of point out what the what the actual issue is. Uh,</p>
<p>If the question is like, uh, is it possible to solve a fusion energy? Uh,</p>
<p>100 yes, definitely definitely definitely definitely is for sure</p>
<p>um, so the the and and really just using a tokamak style, which is like a basically a donut ring with uh,</p>
<p>with electromagnets that control the the plasma</p>
<p>Uh, the the way to solve that is simply scale up the tokamak</p>
<p>Fusion is uh, very much a scale</p>
<p>Base thing you want to minimize your surface volume ratio. So as you scale up a tokamak you reduce your surface volume ratio</p>
<p>Which means like the the the volume you have relative to the the surface, uh, you you now have much more</p>
<p>Uh, like you you can basically have a hot zone in the center. That&rsquo;s relatively far away from the walls</p>
<p>and more of a hot zone, um, so the the</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not in my mind a question as to whether fusion can work</p>
<p>But there is a question as to whether it is economically viable</p>
<p>um, and and whether it is competitive with</p>
<p>Uh with with alternatives, I think the economic viability of fusion is a much bigger question</p>
<p>And I I think the answer probably is that a fusion</p>
<p>Fusion is not competitive economically. I think that is that is uh,</p>
<p>I I would say it&rsquo;s probably not competitive economically by an order of magnitude</p>
<p>Where does it break? Is it a materials breakdown or where does it break down?</p>
<p>economically well</p>
<p>so so you can&rsquo;t just um</p>
<p>Use uh</p>
<p>Normal hydrogen, you know, you you need to use like deuterium and tritium like unusual forms of hydrogen</p>
<p>helium three</p>
<p>uh, uh, you know that there are um, there are some</p>
<p>some other types of fusion that could be used, uh, but</p>
<p>Um, these are just not they&rsquo;re not like there&rsquo;s not a lot of this raw material</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite difficult to get the raw material. So first you have to get the raw material</p>
<p>Uh, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s expensive raw material</p>
<p>um, and then um, it&rsquo;s not just about generating the the energy you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve got to um,</p>
<p>Turn that energy into usable electricity</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just have a hot thing. Okay, so the hot thing has to translate to usable electricity</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;ve got you&rsquo;ve got a cost of fuel issue, which is very significant</p>
<p>uh, you&rsquo;ve got you got a whole bunch of knockdowns from uh, when you generate the heat to</p>
<p>When you actually convert that into electricity</p>
<p>um, you&rsquo;ve got some very difficult maintenance issues with with a</p>
<p>fusion reactor</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>And that should be then compared to alternatives. Uh, the the sustainable energy alternatives that I think are overwhelmingly more competitive are</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>solar energy wind, uh geothermal</p>
<p>hydro</p>
<p>Some tidal and energy but it&rsquo;s really primarily uh solar</p>
<p>and and wind</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>and you can really say like</p>
<p>Why bother creating a fusion on earth when we have a gigantic fusion reactor in the sky that just works with zero maintenance?</p>
<p>And it shows up every day</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty consistent. Yeah, but can we scale to a thousand x or a hundred x our electricity production here using solar?</p>
<p>And other renewable sources</p>
<p>yes, so</p>
<p>the amount of uh surface area you need to</p>
<p>Power the united states is remarkably tiny. Um, so you need like basically</p>
<p>Roughly a hundred miles by a hundred miles of territory and it obviously doesn&rsquo;t need to be in one place</p>
<p>Uh in the united states to power the united states. It&rsquo;s like a little corner of texas or utah the entire country</p>
<p>um, and and then if you if you</p>
<p>You could you could basically power, uh, you probably 10x the the just with solar alone</p>
<p>um without displacing, uh anyone&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>Uh power and economy 10 times the size of the united states in the united states</p>
<p>on land</p>
<p>When energy prices if you extend that to water</p>
<p>Because earth is 70 percent water. Yeah, I mean you could you could say okay now we could probably have</p>
<p>A civilization that is a hundred times as energy intensive as we currently have it</p>
<p>And so what does that look like with the last part of my question?</p>
<p>Which is a world where energy costs are say let&rsquo;s a hundred times cheaper than they are today</p>
<p>And we have a hundred times more energy production capacity</p>
<p>What what changes about civilization? What do we do differently? And what do we see?</p>
<p>change most kind of</p>
<p>Dramatically. Well currently we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>Because of of just generally, uh low growth rates almost worldwide</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Civilization is not headed to</p>
<p>Have a population</p>
<p>That is an order of magnitude greater than where we&rsquo;re currently. We&rsquo;re currently headed towards a population decline</p>
<p>Uh, and this is almost everywhere in well in the world</p>
<p>um, so</p>
<p>You know, it basically seems as as though as soon as you have like urbanization</p>
<p>Um and and and education beyond a certain level and income beyond a certain level birth rates plummet</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And so as countries get get wealthier their birth rates plummet</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s somewhat counterintuitive because people will say like well, it&rsquo;s too expensive to have a baby</p>
<p>Nope, the the wealthier you are the fewer kids you have</p>
<p>um, the more educated you are the fewer kids you have so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the inverse</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>So so i&rsquo;m not sure who to use all that energy. Um, unless there&rsquo;s a significant change in the birth rate</p>
<p>Um, or we have a very robot oriented economy, so that&rsquo;s also possible. So if we&rsquo;ve got a lot of um,</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>four-wheeled robots in form of cars and</p>
<p>androids</p>
<p>Humanoid robots, then you can certainly see that there&rsquo;d be perhaps a need for an order of magnitude more energy</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not coming from the humans unless something</p>
<p>Major changes on the on the human, uh birth rate, uh level</p>
<p>This by the way is I think the biggest single threat to civilization. Uh right now is the why why do you think?</p>
<p>Societally people just make those decisions when they become more affluent</p>
<p>Is it that they just become more selfish or there&rsquo;s more things for them to do and they have more money to spend on themselves?</p>
<p>And they say you know what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have</p>
<p>A large family. I want to</p>
<p>You know go to Coachella</p>
<p>Yeah, well</p>
<p>there is this like weird like mind virusy thing where some people are</p>
<p>Think like having fewer kids is is like better for the environment. Yeah, that&rsquo;s crazy total nonsense</p>
<p>The environment is going to be fine. They&rsquo;re going to be fine. Even if we if we doubled the size of the humans</p>
<p>um, this is and I know a lot about environmental stuff, so</p>
<p>um, you know, uh</p>
<p>You we can&rsquo;t have civilization just dwindle into nothing. Um</p>
<p>And you know japan&rsquo;s leading indicator here like the</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s population declined by 600 000 people last year that lowest birth rate in history</p>
<p>Uh, it&rsquo;s you know, it&rsquo;s pretty bad. Um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>So so this one element of is is</p>
<p>A lot of people just think that having kids is somehow bad for the environment. I want to be clear</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s essential for maintain for maintaining civilization that we at least maintain our numbers. We don&rsquo;t necessarily need to grow</p>
<p>Dramatically, but at least let&rsquo;s not, uh, you know gradually dwindle away and until uh</p>
<p>civilization ends with us all in adult diapers and</p>
<p>In a whimper like we don&rsquo;t want civilization to end in adult diapers with a whimper that would suck</p>
<p>kind of suck</p>
<p>bleak</p>
<p>Bleak and sad. Well, I mean and you and I have had this conversation</p>
<p>I mean in japan, I had two people tell me when I was there</p>
<p>Like I think it&rsquo;s immoral to bring humans into the world. I mean people have gotten very</p>
<p>Sad about the future. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy. It&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s literally i&rsquo;ve heard many times how like how can I bring a child into this terrible world?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, like have you read history because let me tell you it was way worse back then</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a good time</p>
<p>Hey, you know, listen, I I know you&rsquo;re super busy, but I want to ask you about the move to texas because i&rsquo;ve been thinking about</p>
<p>it, uh austin california</p>
<p>Uh, I I don&rsquo;t know some senator told you to go. Fuck yourself and like</p>
<p>You know, like we don&rsquo;t need a couple senators with that actually</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems to be turning into a bit of a trend. Um, but how has</p>
<p>building the tesla, um</p>
<p>Gigafactory which I got to see in austin a couple weeks ago, and it was</p>
<p>one of the most inspiring things i&rsquo;ve ever seen I mean</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many months it took to build there, but</p>
<p>how long did it take to build that dreadnought and then</p>
<p>What would have taken to build that in california california under gavin newsom?</p>
<p>so we built the</p>
<p>The giga texas which is the biggest factory in north america. I think possibly the biggest factory in the world</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s three times the size of the pentagon to give you a sense of scale</p>
<p>Okay, this is friggin big. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s weird. It&rsquo;s like so big. It&rsquo;s weird like you</p>
<p>I was trying to find you in it and I was trying to drive around and it took me about 45 minutes to find you</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Like no, you have to like call so you can&rsquo;t like find someone in the building</p>
<p>You have to call them on their cell phone and say where are you? You know?</p>
<p>um, so, uh, I mean the building is like, uh,</p>
<p>Just under a mile long and we&rsquo;re actually going to extend it. It will be like literally a mile long</p>
<p>And about a quarter mile wide</p>
<p>Uh, and it&rsquo;s uh, 80 feet tall</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just uh ridiculously big</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and when you think about it like for manufacturing situation, like what what</p>
<p>What are the two the two things that really define manufacturing competitiveness are economies of scale and technology</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;ve got an ace on economy</p>
<p>Like if you sort of maximize your ace level on technology and you maximize your ace level on scale</p>
<p>This is obviously going to be the most competitive situation and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so friggin giant</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and the the</p>
<p>giga, texas will go all the way from um</p>
<p>Cell raw materials like like like basically rail cars of cell raw materials coming in and then forming the the battery cell</p>
<p>Then the battery pack, uh building the the motor</p>
<p>Uh casting we&rsquo;re also</p>
<p>Have introduced a major innovation which is to cast the entire</p>
<p>Uh front third and rear third of the car and as a single piece</p>
<p>Um, I got this idea from toys actually because I was like, how do they make toys? Those are cheap</p>
<p>They just cast them and I was like, well, can you pull the casting machine?</p>
<p>That big and they&rsquo;re like well, no one ever has i&rsquo;m like is are we breaking physics like no</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s just ask them and there were six major casting machine suppliers in the world and five of them said no</p>
<p>And the six said maybe i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;ll take that as a yes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Well, I mean this you wanted to do this for the model three, but it was just too soon, huh?</p>
<p>And and now it&rsquo;s almost there</p>
<p>Actually, this this partly comes from the model three, which is actually a fantastic car in many ways</p>
<p>um, but we were rightly criticized for an inefficient design, uh with</p>
<p>for the front and rear body, um</p>
<p>Like sandy monroe who I think is really</p>
<p>Has excellent from an engineering standpoint and and really a very fair critic</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>He pistol whupped us for um, the design of the battery</p>
<p>And piece by piece told you why you suck and then he did the why and told you why you&rsquo;re awesome</p>
<p>He took it apart and told us exactly why he&rsquo;s why we sucked and he was correct. Um, and then</p>
<p>And I was like, well, that&rsquo;s pretty embarrassing. So</p>
<p>uh, no, he was complimentary of other parts of the car but not the body design and</p>
<p>Uh, and so it&rsquo;s like okay, we&rsquo;re gonna go from like, you know</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>The the it&rsquo;s just incredibly difficult body to make it&rsquo;s made out of like 120 different pieces with dissimilar metals that are joined</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got galvanic corrosion challenges. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very difficult to make</p>
<p>Um to a single piece casting that&rsquo;s one piece. So like 120 pieces went down to like one so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a huge and</p>
<p>And the the like the model wide body shop, especially the new one where we cast both the front and rear</p>
<p>Is 60 percent smaller than the model three body shop</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>Gigantic, uh, it&rsquo;s quite there&rsquo;s a lot of innovations of tesla besides the stuff that is is obvious. Um,</p>
<p>so anyway, so yeah the the</p>
<p>And and really, you know to to refer to to gavin newsom like, uh,</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>if you</p>
<p>If you had a gun to gavin&rsquo;s head, okay</p>
<p>Um and said we need to build start building this factory in california right now</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t do it because there are so many. Uh,</p>
<p>regulatory agencies, um and so many</p>
<p>Litigators in california that want to stop you from doing anything that even if you&rsquo;re the governor of the state you cannot get it done</p>
<p>um, so</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s got to be done to to to you know, because california used to be the land of opportunity</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful state and I love I loved living there</p>
<p>I still spend a lot of time in california, even though every time I go there I get</p>
<p>Every literally every day I go there. I get the bejesus tax tax big tax bill by day</p>
<p>Like the sheer cost per day of me going and working in california today is boggles the mind and I still do it</p>
<p>You know, um, but but the california&rsquo;s gone from the land of opportunity to to the land of of of</p>
<p>sort of taxes</p>
<p>uh over regulation and litigation</p>
<p>And this is not a good situation and really there&rsquo;s got to be like</p>
<p>A serious cleaning out of the pipes in california. How many months was it to get?</p>
<p>The giga austin done</p>
<p>Took a year and a half two years. Yeah, 18 18 months to build something three times the size of the pentagon</p>
<p>And you just basically the answer to how many months it would take in california&rsquo;s infinity. We would still be working on the permits</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>This this begs a good question, which is</p>
<p>But we have one more form for you, what&rsquo;s a better model?</p>
<p>Yes, what&rsquo;s a better model for government? So, you know, like all governments tend to increase in complexity</p>
<p>dictatorship capacity</p>
<p>Is the dictatorship the right model?</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>You know, like like how do we solve this? Let&rsquo;s say you go to mars or let&rsquo;s say you have to fix california</p>
<p>Is california permanently broken?</p>
<p>Is there a way to fix it or like how do you set up a better model?</p>
<p>So that you don&rsquo;t end up having this this kind of special interest complexity</p>
<p>situation that eventually kills the uh</p>
<p>population</p>
<p>I mean, I think ultimately with california the people of california just have to get fed up and and demand change</p>
<p>Um, that&rsquo;s the thing that really has to happen. Um,</p>
<p>And and and there&rsquo;s got there&rsquo;s got to be an above zero percent chance of the of the republicans winning in california</p>
<p>If if if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s just the democrats every time</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be</p>
<p>Yeah, and this is this is like occasionally. It&rsquo;s the thing is that right right now, uh, you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>plus the level of</p>
<p>level of gerrymandering, uh, which is basically just treating the people like sheep, uh, and and uh, it&rsquo;s terrible. Um,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gone on in california is outrageous. So california, uh, the dems have a super majority</p>
<p>In um the house and senate in california and the governor and everything</p>
<p>And so how responsive is any political party going to be to the people if they are guaranteed to win?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s a one-party state</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not saying that you know go</p>
<p>Sort of elect the republicans every time but if it&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re just making california a one-party state</p>
<p>They will no longer be responsive responsive to the people and will only be responsive to those that funded their political campaigns</p>
<p>Clip elon saying that 30 seconds on tv over and over go ahead sex. Yeah, so elon shifting gears to the economy</p>
<p>Um, you know, we saw this uh surprise report of negative 1.4 percent gdp growth in q1</p>
<p>Uh interest rates been rising that increased the cost to the consumer of getting loans things like that</p>
<p>Uh, we&rsquo;ve had a stock market correction really a crash in a lot of growth stocks software stocks</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>From where you said and the data that you see</p>
<p>Uh, where do you think the economy is is headed right now?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re in a recession or is it just a risk? How do you how do you assess our current economic situation?</p>
<p>Well predicting economic macroeconomics is always difficult. Um, and and one should assign probabilities to these things</p>
<p>Um, but ironically I did last year people asked me what I think about the economy</p>
<p>I said, well, I think we might enter a recession in approximately. Uh,</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>spring of</p>
<p>2020 of 2022</p>
<p>Called it</p>
<p>Um, yeah, um, so</p>
<p>Uh, you know now the thing is that</p>
<p>Recessions are not necessarily a bad thing. Uh, they they you know, um,</p>
<p>what what I&rsquo;ve now been through a few of them and what tends to happen is if you have um,</p>
<p>A boom that goes on for too long you get misallocation of capital. Uh, it starts raining money on fools</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s like any any dumb thing gets money and i&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen a few of those</p>
<p>um, so</p>
<p>At some point it gets just out of control and you just have a misallocation of human capital</p>
<p>Where people are doing things that are silly and not useful to their fellow human beings</p>
<p>Um, and and then those companies there needs to be sort of an economic enema if you will, um,</p>
<p>Have everyone sort of shift uncomfortably in their seats. Um, so</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, sorry, it&rsquo;s just i&rsquo;m visualizing it</p>
<p>The economic enema, I mean listen, it&rsquo;s got alliteration</p>
<p>So, uh</p>
<p>This too shall pass</p>
<p>Eventually the economic enema does its job it clears out the pipes if you will. Yes</p>
<p>And um and and sort of the the bullshit companies, um,</p>
<p>Uh go bankrupt and the ones that are doing useful products, uh are prosperous. Um,</p>
<p>And um, but there&rsquo;s certainly a lesson here that if one is making useful part and and and do it</p>
<p>Has a company that makes sense, uh, make sure you&rsquo;re not running things too close to the edge from a capital standpoint</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got some capital reserves to uh last through</p>
<p>Uh irrational times because in the in the past when there&rsquo;s been a recession</p>
<p>Um, it has gone. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s flipped like a light switch</p>
<p>I mean david do remember this when from the from the paypal, you know x paypal days when when we</p>
<p>Uh raised 100 million dollars in march of 2000</p>
<p>Uh, and we literally we had</p>
<p>The demand was so high we had uh people like</p>
<p>Vcs, like just literally without even a term sheet wiring money into our account</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll send the term sheet later</p>
<p>They literally were like we like sleuth out our our bank account number and wire money in and we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d this come from? And it&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>So it was like there was literally fire hosing money in march of 2000</p>
<p>And and then in april 2000 the market went into freefall and it went from money raising money was trivial to even good companies</p>
<p>Could not raise money</p>
<p>uh in a month</p>
<p>Um, so it&rsquo;s just important to bear in mind like that, you know paypal almost went bankrupt in in 2000. Uh, we came close</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But but thankfully we&rsquo;d raise that that hundred million dollars in in march 2000, uh without which we would be</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in game over basically, um</p>
<p>Uh, and we kind of saw it coming</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like we we got that the the the x confinity merger done in like three weeks and raised 100 million dollars</p>
<p>because we were all like oh</p>
<p>We see this coming to an end pretty soon. And then a month later it was like</p>
<p>You know a nightmare basically. Um</p>
<p>And and uh, anyway, so it&rsquo;s just important to make sure if you&rsquo;re a healthy company, you got some capital to get through things</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and and then what what&rsquo;s your costs and uh, if you if if it is a recession, which</p>
<p>More likely than not. It is a recession not saying it is but it probably is</p>
<p>um, then just uh</p>
<p>Make what&rsquo;s your cash flow and get positive cash flow as soon as you can. Um, so, um,</p>
<p>yeah, uh</p>
<p>But I think we probably are</p>
<p>Are in a recession and that that recession will get get worse</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But you know these things pass and then there will be boom times again</p>
<p>Um, so it&rsquo;ll probably be some some tough going for I don&rsquo;t know a year. Uh, maybe maybe</p>
<p>you know 12 to 18 months is usually um,</p>
<p>The amount of time that takes for for the a correction to to happen. Um,</p>
<p>I mean, what do you guys think? Yeah, I</p>
<p>David, uh, how do you feel about it? Yeah, I mean it feels like it started. Um</p>
<p>You know what started as a slowdown earlier this year?</p>
<p>Um now seems like I mean technically I guess we need two quarters of negative growth to be in a recession</p>
<p>But it feels like we&rsquo;re in one feels like it started</p>
<p>um, you know the growth stock the software businesses that we invest in are sort of the canaries in the coal mine and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of a lot of dead canaries</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re having a hard time breathing</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dead it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just napping it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Napping wake up little birdie</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just stunned it&rsquo;s got it got stunned for a brief moment and and and it just it&rsquo;ll be fine. Um</p>
<p>It sort of reminds me of the parrot that you know, the pet shop sketch with the parrot with monty</p>
<p>Pining this parrot is pining for the fjords</p>
<p>Hey, um</p>
<p>Elon a lot has been talked about as we wrap here and you&rsquo;ve been incredibly gracious giving us so much time</p>
<p>Thank you for that. Um</p>
<p>a lot of talk about american exceptionalism over the last couple years, um waning</p>
<p>and maybe this country had seen its best days and</p>
<p>We see the work you&rsquo;re doing and other people in this great country are doing and the debates we&rsquo;re having about the future</p>
<p>And yeah, china&rsquo;s doing pretty fantastic rushes on the ropes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But it does seem like uh, america is still producing</p>
<p>Some of the greatest companies, uh, the world has ever seen some of the greatest innovations</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on america and our future and what we need to keep this country and and this beacon of hope that?</p>
<p>You know four of the five of us were not born here</p>
<p>You know two of you came from south africa and no three of you three of you came from south africa</p>
<p>One of you from can I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re putting from sri</p>
<p>Lanka and from sri lanka through canada via canada</p>
<p>He came through canada, too. Yeah, I know</p>
<p>It seems like that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the way canada is a gateway. It is a gateway</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>How do we?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well i&rsquo;m hinting at the answer here, but you know, it does seem like our immigration policy is absolutely insane</p>
<p>And uh, maybe we need to keep collecting some of the great individuals that I get to share the stage with here and yourself</p>
<p>We need to keep bringing great people to this country</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we get that in our heads that?</p>
<p>Yeah, not immigration. It&rsquo;s talent recruitment. No, absolutely. I think uh, it&rsquo;s incredibly important that the united states be</p>
<p>Like the destination for the world&rsquo;s best talent</p>
<p>I mean you can think of this like like like a pro sports team if you want to win the league</p>
<p>um, and and uh, you know, you want the best players on your team, um, now there are obviously a lot of</p>
<p>Very talented people born in the united states</p>
<p>um, but if you can add a few aces from uh from uh,</p>
<p>Outside the country to the team you&rsquo;re going to win the league</p>
<p>Um, and and and and here&rsquo;s the thing those aces actually want to work for your team</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to compete against you. They want to they want to be on team america</p>
<p>And and so it&rsquo;s like we have to like fight them off to not be on team america. That&rsquo;s the crazy thing</p>
<p>Um, and so it&rsquo;s like if you have some aces that are the difference between winning and losing</p>
<p>we should be like</p>
<p>Really recruiting them like you&rsquo;d recruit like a star</p>
<p>Basketball player or football player. That&rsquo;s what we should be doing. Um</p>
<p>active recruiting</p>
<p>Um, just like if you&rsquo;re a company that wants to succeed you actively recruit the best talent</p>
<p>And then and and that&rsquo;s the way to win and and if if that stops happening america will stop winning</p>
<p>And we have two administrations in a row</p>
<p>biden and trump who don&rsquo;t want to let</p>
<p>The greatest minds the most talented people into this country is absolutely insane</p>
<p>I mean, I think deal with this every day</p>
<p>Reality is like actually anyone who who&rsquo;s gonna who wants to to to work hard and be and do useful things</p>
<p>um, and and this you know, uh, we we want in the united states, um,</p>
<p>And and it&rsquo;s not just people who are sort of intellectually strong, but it&rsquo;s just anyone with a strong work ethic</p>
<p>You know if if they&rsquo;re coming from mexico or if they&rsquo;re coming from you know, europe or china wherever it&rsquo;s just if they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>Going to come here and crank hard and and and contribute more than they take</p>
<p>Hell, yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a no-brainer</p>
<p>we have you been have you been disappointed in the</p>
<p>Similarities between biden and trump on this like maybe you could have expected it from trump because that was a rhetoric</p>
<p>He needed to use to get elected, but it&rsquo;s not as if biden has flipped the script and said, okay</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go 180 degrees in the other direction. He&rsquo;s kind of kept it the same</p>
<p>Which has been really surprising actually, man. It&rsquo;s hard to tell what biden is doing if you&rsquo;re totally frank, um, you know</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s weekend at bernie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>The the real president is whoever controls the teleprompter, you know, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>The path to power is the path to the teleprompter, you know, like what because that then he just reads the teleprompter</p>
<p>So, you know, I do feel like like if somebody would accidentally lead on the lean on the teleprompter</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be like anchorman. It&rsquo;s going to be like qqq asdf-123, you know type of thing</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>in fairness to biden, he he hasn&rsquo;t been napping as much as he needs to but</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s hard to see</p>
<p>Are getting done, you know</p>
<p>I mean, this administration just it doesn&rsquo;t seem to get a lot done like and you know</p>
<p>Whatever like the trump administration</p>
<p>Leaving trump aside. I there were a lot of people in the administration who were effective at getting things done. So, uh,</p>
<p>but this</p>
<p>this administration seems just just to not have like the drive to just</p>
<p>Get shit done. Uh that that um</p>
<p>That that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s my impression. Um, so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>You know, we definitely need to fix immigration policy like we had covid which was an issue and and and so that was like</p>
<p>One reason to like not, you know, I guess clamp down on but now now we&rsquo;ve moved on and so</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s just make sure we&rsquo;re getting top talent</p>
<p>in the united states</p>
<p>Um, and and really i&rsquo;d say broadly it&rsquo;s anyone who who wants to work their ass off</p>
<p>um and and uh</p>
<p>And contribute more than they take to the economy like that&rsquo;s just necessarily going to make for a stronger better society in america</p>
<p>Elon, did you see uh, jeff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Uh bezos&rsquo;s tweet back and forth with biden. Um where biden I think was talking about inflation inflation</p>
<p>But then he correlated that to taxing corporations and bezo said this is misinformation and disinformation, etc, etc</p>
<p>What do you what do you think about that whole exchange then back and forth?</p>
<p>I mean the obvious reason for inflation is that the government printed a zillion amount of more money than it had</p>
<p>obviously, um</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like the government can&rsquo;t just uh</p>
<p>You know have</p>
<p>Issue checks far in excess of revenue without there being inflation, um, you know velocity money held constant</p>
<p>so unless there&rsquo;s something would change with velocity money, but</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just look the the federal government writes checks. They don&rsquo;t they never bounce</p>
<p>So that is effectively creation of more of more dollars</p>
<p>And if if there are more dollars created then the increase in the goods and services output of the economy</p>
<p>Then you have inflation again velocity money held constant</p>
<p>but so, uh</p>
<p>This is just this is very basic. This is not like, uh, you know, uh super complicated. Um,</p>
<p>And and if if the government could just issue, uh</p>
<p>Massive amounts of money and have a and deficits didn&rsquo;t matter then. Well, why don&rsquo;t we just make the deficit a hundred times bigger?</p>
<p>Okay, the answer is you can&rsquo;t because it will basically turn the dollar into something that is worthless. So</p>
<p>Um</p>
<p>And and various countries have have tried this experiment multiple times. It&rsquo;s not like oh, I wonder what happens if this if this is done</p>
<p>Have you seen venezuela like the the poor people of venezuela are you know have been?</p>
<p>Just run roughshod by their government. Um, and</p>
<p>so obviously you can&rsquo;t simply</p>
<p>Create money the the true economy is very important. Like the true economy is the output of goods and services. It&rsquo;s not money</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s literally what is the output of goods and services money is simply a way to</p>
<p>To for us to or anything that you call money</p>
<p>Is is a way for us to conveniently exchange goods and services without having to engage in barter</p>
<p>And also to shift obligations in time that those are the two reasons that you have money this thing called money</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really a it&rsquo;s a database money is an information system</p>
<p>For uh for labor allocation and for exchange of goods and services and for translating in time</p>
<p>and the quality of that information is a function of it&rsquo;s like you basically you can apply information theory to money and</p>
<p>I think it it</p>
<p>Helps explain</p>
<p>Why one money system is or why why one action is better than another and so</p>
<p>if like the the money you you just just like a</p>
<p>An internet connection you&rsquo;d want something that&rsquo;s high bandwidth</p>
<p>Uh low latency and jitter and uh, it&rsquo;s not dropping packets. It&rsquo;s not having a lot of errors in the system</p>
<p>And the same is true true of money. Um</p>
<p>You want then and really like you said, what did paypal really really do that helped improve?</p>
<p>The the the bandwidth the speed at which money could move</p>
<p>Um instead of of mailing checks back and forth, which amazingly that was what people did</p>
<p>in 2000</p>
<p>Uh, you you could now do real-time exchange of of money. Um,</p>
<p>And and now you could ship your goods immediately instead of mailing a check and waiting for the bank to clear the check</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>uh, like</p>
<p>And and the the ultimate thing that with paypal or if it sort of was in the x.com</p>
<p>Sort of went more less sort of niche payments more sort of broad financial would be to simply does that</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t to mediate all the heterogeneous, uh cobalt databases out there running on mainframes doing batch processing and have a single real-time system</p>
<p>that uh</p>
<p>that was secure, um and not batch processing, um, and so</p>
<p>It would just be from an information standpoint more efficient and and eventually it would all the the</p>
<p>Batch processing cobalt mainframes operated by the banks would cease to exist</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve um spent more time, uh</p>
<p>and uh built more in china than</p>
<p>Almost anybody. I mean apple would be the only company I could think of that&rsquo;s probably got a bigger footprint, but i&rsquo;m not certain of that</p>
<p>Um, what have you learned about china?</p>
<p>Uh that you didn&rsquo;t know before you opened the factories there and started delivering cars there</p>
<p>And what should we know about china, you know as americans?</p>
<p>How should we think about china and our relationship with it because we haven&rsquo;t spent time there</p>
<p>Sure, well I&rsquo;d say like china first of all, it&rsquo;s not monolithic. It&rsquo;s not like, uh, everything everything is not some plot by the chinese government</p>
<p>um the uh, the the there are many uh factions within china that compete, uh vigorously within china, um,</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and and</p>
<p>perhaps most important is that there&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>A just a tremendous number of hard-working smart people in china who want to get ahead and get things done</p>
<p>Um, and they&rsquo;re not complacent. They&rsquo;re not entitled</p>
<p>um, and they&rsquo;re gonna they&rsquo;re they want to get things done and they they want to make a better life for themselves, um, and</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re going to see, uh with china for the first time that anyone can remember who is alive is an economy</p>
<p>That is twice the size of the u.s</p>
<p>Possibly three times the size of the u.s is going to be very weird living in that world</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>uh, we we better</p>
<p>Stop the infighting in the u.s and stop punching ourselves in the face because like there&rsquo;s a whole there&rsquo;s way too much</p>
<p>Uh, you know of america punching itself in the damn face. It&rsquo;s just just dumb. Um, and and think about like</p>
<p>Hey, we got to be competitive here</p>
<p>And and uh, there&rsquo;s a new kid on the block that&rsquo;s going to be two to three times our size</p>
<p>We we better step up our game</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>And uh, you know and stop infighting. Um</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s easier to stop infighting once we&rsquo;re beaten or do you think that there&rsquo;s a way?</p>
<p>folks here can actually just you know, get their political and</p>
<p>Commercial act together, but or does it not happen until we&rsquo;ve realized we&rsquo;ve lost or do we need a war?</p>
<p>I mean, I we I sure hope we don&rsquo;t even need a war. Um,</p>
<p>uh, but there will be certainly um</p>
<p>You know an economic competition that I think will will blow people away. Um,</p>
<p>And when they realize just how competitive they have to be to be competitive with companies in china, it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>Um, you know tesla is competitive but tesla is competitive because we have an awesome team in china that uh, you know</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um, like do your tesla china employees work some meaningful percentage more or harder than your tesla non-china employees</p>
<p>Do you find like it&rsquo;s two different companies basically?</p>
<p>Well, I mean I I think tesla is somewhat it tesla is sort of pretty far out there in terms of work ethic</p>
<p>uh anywhere in the world, so I</p>
<p>the tesla work ethic in the u.s. I think is substantially greater than</p>
<p>Any other car company or or any large manufacturing company that i&rsquo;m aware of? Um, so, you know tesla</p>
<p>Tesla does have a a strong worth work ethic in in the u.s</p>
<p>but but</p>
<p>To be totally frank it it the work that work ethic is exceeded. Um, uh on balance by uh,</p>
<p>The tesla china team that that is I think objectively true</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not say there aren&rsquo;t lots of hard-working people at tesla u.s</p>
<p>There certainly are um, but if you say on average the the the work ethic in china is higher. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>Tell us tell us like it is, you know, so what about if you&rsquo;re an american ceo?</p>
<p>How do you deal with you think?</p>
<p>just the</p>
<p>Need for managing all these political factions inside of a company you probably saw</p>
<p>You know all the sturm und drang related to disney and what happened to them and what&rsquo;s continuing to happen to them on both sides</p>
<p>Between their employees as well as the governments, etc</p>
<p>Um, do you have any advice or what do you tell like young ceos that you hang out with?</p>
<p>About how to deal with that how to make those decisions where you land</p>
<p>In the spectrum of dealing with all of this stuff</p>
<p>The non-work issues that are related to now, you know going to work every day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not sure. I entirely understand what you mean like, uh</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the the need for political correctness or the need for having</p>
<p>Political points of view and having to bring that and balance that in the workplace. How do you deal with that?</p>
<p>How do you give advice to other folks about having to deal with it?</p>
<p>Look, I think it you know, the the point of a company is to produce useful products and services</p>
<p>For your fellow human beings. It is not, uh, you know, some political gathering place or</p>
<p>A thing where it that&rsquo;s the point of a company like it&rsquo;s i&rsquo;d say like it&rsquo;s you know politics and other stuff should</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not lose sight of why companies should exist</p>
<p>So I I I gotta I gotta</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually late for yeah</p>
<p>I gotta work on the rocket guys. Uh, yeah</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go ahead and let you uh get to mars and uh, i&rsquo;ll see you soon</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like sexual tension, but they just need to release somehow</p>
<p>What we need to get</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going</p>
