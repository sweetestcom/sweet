create a important video on the seven surprising things that can kick you out of ketosis now you may know the typical things like sugar you know and refined carbohydrates but these are things that you may not know that are important number one stress can kick you out of ketosis because stress activates a hormone called cortisol cortisol is the main adrenal hormone that adapts the body to stress so any type of stress shock to the system even a surgery trauma allergies even the loss of a loved one can activate stress stress on your job relationship stress boom that can actually knock you out of ketosis I bet you didn&amp;rsquo;t know that one next next one is excessive caffeine now one cup of coffee is not going to do anything but if you&amp;rsquo;re doing coffee all day long or tea all day long with caffeine too much of that connective eight adrenaline which can then activate insulin alright bone broth in large quantities now a little bit of bone broth is not going to be an issue but we&amp;rsquo;re talking to protein protein will activate it it can bump you out I&amp;rsquo;m not too concerned about bone broth even when you&amp;rsquo;re fasting it may knock you out a little bit but it&amp;rsquo;s a very very small amount so I&amp;rsquo;m not too concerned about that whey protein is one of the top proteins because it&amp;rsquo;s low fat and high protein that will stimulate insulin and knock you out of ketosis and then we have l-glutamine now that people take that for your digestive system leaky gut irritable bowel syndrome it&amp;rsquo;s a it&amp;rsquo;s a protein and it can knock you out of ketosis now I&amp;rsquo;m not concerned about you taking that because it really helps you in certain ways it&amp;rsquo;s not going to put weight on but the only reason I bring it up is because as you tense yourself and all of a sudden you get knocks you out don&amp;rsquo;t be concerned that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s doing it it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a temporary thing but it will knock you out okay and then we have MSG monosodium glutamate another name for that is modified food starch it&amp;rsquo;s in so many foods and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to avoid if you&amp;rsquo;re shopping but it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to avoid if you&amp;rsquo;re going out to restaurants because they have it in the sauces they have it in the dressings they have it in the in some of the flavor enhancers on Peruvian chicken loaded with MSG so they&amp;rsquo;ve any food that just tastes too good typically has msg on it especially if it&amp;rsquo;s the fast-food restaurant next one artificial sweeteners aspartame Splenda that has actual dextran and it also has maltodextran that will not give out and saccharine these are artificial sweeteners that can raise insulin so another interesting hidden thing and then excess that protein will do it to let&amp;rsquo;s say you have this big steak and that&amp;rsquo;s why the Atkins diet which is high in protein they&amp;rsquo;re allowing too much protein that can spike insulin and knock you out of ketosis so ideal sweet spot for most people between three to six ounces per meal all right now if you&amp;rsquo;re actually doing two meals a day or one meal a day and you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do them at fasting where you&amp;rsquo;re just condensing that to from three to two to one and you keeping your calories higher maybe you can get a get away with like eight ounces of protein you know but typically it&amp;rsquo;s three to six now if you just as a side note if you combine sugar with protein you will majorly spike influence so that&amp;rsquo;s even worse than excessive protein next one is to mini keto desserts now let me just explain this I always recommend taking like one maybe two but not a whole bunch so if you cannot just have one then don&amp;rsquo;t make them because you&amp;rsquo;re in the keto desserts you&amp;rsquo;re going to add mannitol or maltitol or xylitol or erythritol some of these sugar alcohols now erythritol has a glycemic index of zero stevia has a glycemic index of zero xylitoll has a little higher glycemic index mannitol and multiple has even higher glycemic index now it&amp;rsquo;s a lot less than sugar but it still can affect insulin a little bit I personally consume xylitol in very small amounts but if I put it in the keto desert I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do massive quantities of these keto bombs which are little cookies that can really knock you out of ketosis so again just because it says it&amp;rsquo;s keto friendly doesn&amp;rsquo;t always mean it&amp;rsquo;s keto friendly in large quantities okay cough syrup has hidden sugar as well alcohol beer juice those are all the kind of the known things that these are the things that you may not be aware of so if you can think of anything else that could knock you out put it down below I want to I want to know what you think thanks for watching hey guys I have a quick survey question what is your biggest health challenge right now something that is just bugging you or stopping you from achieving your goal just click the link below let me know because I want

the seven surprising things that can kick you out  </p><p>of ketosis now you may know the typical things 
like sugar you know and refined carbohydrates  </p><p>but these are things that you may not know 
that are important number one stress can kick  </p><p>you out of ketosis because stress activates a 
hormone called cortisol cortisol is the main  </p><p>adrenal hormone that adapts the body to stress 
so any type of stress shock to the system even  </p><p>a surgery trauma allergies even the loss of a 
loved one can activate stress stress on your  </p><p>job relationship stress boom that can actually 
knock you out of ketosis I bet you didn&rsquo;t know  </p><p>that one next next one is excessive caffeine now 
one cup of coffee is not going to do anything but  </p><p>if you&rsquo;re doing coffee all day long or tea 
all day long with caffeine too much of that  </p><p>connective eight adrenaline which can then 
activate insulin alright bone broth in large  </p><p>quantities now a little bit of bone broth is 
not going to be an issue but we&rsquo;re talking to  </p><p>protein protein will activate it it can bump you 
out I&rsquo;m not too concerned about bone broth even  </p><p>when you&rsquo;re fasting it may knock you out a little 
bit but it&rsquo;s a very very small amount so I&rsquo;m not  </p><p>too concerned about that whey protein is one of 
the top proteins because it&rsquo;s low fat and high  </p><p>protein that will stimulate insulin and knock you 
out of ketosis and then we have l-glutamine now  </p><p>that people take that for your digestive system 
leaky gut irritable bowel syndrome it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s  </p><p>a protein and it can knock you out of ketosis now 
I&rsquo;m not concerned about you taking that because it  </p><p>really helps you in certain ways it&rsquo;s not going to 
put weight on but the only reason I bring it up is  </p><p>because as you tense yourself and all of a sudden 
you get knocks you out don&rsquo;t be concerned that&rsquo;s  </p><p>what&rsquo;s doing it it&rsquo;s going to be a temporary 
thing but it will knock you out okay and then  </p><p>we have MSG monosodium glutamate another name 
for that is modified food starch it&rsquo;s in so many  </p><p>foods and it&rsquo;s easy to avoid if you&rsquo;re shopping 
but it&rsquo;s very hard to avoid if you&rsquo;re going out  </p><p>to restaurants because they have it in the sauces 
they have it in the dressings they have it in the  </p><p>in some of the flavor enhancers on Peruvian 
chicken loaded with MSG so they&rsquo;ve any food  </p><p>that just tastes too good typically has msg on it 
especially if it&rsquo;s the fast-food restaurant next  </p><p>one artificial sweeteners aspartame Splenda that 
has actual dextran and it also has maltodextran  </p><p>that will not give out and saccharine these are 
artificial sweeteners that can raise insulin so  </p><p>another interesting hidden thing and then excess 
that protein will do it to let&rsquo;s say you have this  </p><p>big steak and that&rsquo;s why the Atkins diet which is 
high in protein they&rsquo;re allowing too much protein  </p><p>that can spike insulin and knock you out of 
ketosis so ideal sweet spot for most people  </p><p>between three to six ounces per meal all right now 
if you&rsquo;re actually doing two meals a day or one  </p><p>meal a day and you&rsquo;re trying to do them at fasting 
where you&rsquo;re just condensing that to from three to  </p><p>two to one and you keeping your calories higher 
maybe you can get a get away with like eight  </p><p>ounces of protein you know but typically it&rsquo;s 
three to six now if you just as a side note if you  </p><p>combine sugar with protein you will majorly spike 
influence so that&rsquo;s even worse than excessive  </p><p>protein next one is to mini keto desserts now let 
me just explain this I always recommend taking  </p><p>like one maybe two but not a whole bunch so if you 
cannot just have one then don&rsquo;t make them because  </p><p>you&rsquo;re in the keto desserts you&rsquo;re going to add 
mannitol or maltitol or xylitol or erythritol  </p><p>some of these sugar alcohols now erythritol has 
a glycemic index of zero stevia has a glycemic  </p><p>index of zero xylitoll has a little higher 
glycemic index mannitol and multiple has even  </p><p>higher glycemic index now it&rsquo;s a lot less than 
sugar but it still can affect insulin a little  </p><p>bit I personally consume xylitol in very small 
amounts but if I put it in the keto desert I&rsquo;m  </p><p>not going to do massive quantities of these keto 
bombs which are little cookies that can really  </p><p>knock you out of ketosis so again just because 
it says it&rsquo;s keto friendly doesn&rsquo;t always mean  </p><p>it&rsquo;s keto friendly in large quantities okay cough 
syrup has hidden sugar as well alcohol beer juice  </p><p>those are all the kind of the known things that 
these are the things that you may not be aware  </p><p>of so if you can think of anything else that could 
knock you out put it down below I want to I want  </p><p>to know what you think thanks for watching hey 
guys I have a quick survey question what is your  </p><p>biggest health challenge right now something that 
is just bugging you or stopping you from achieving  </p><p>your goal just click the link below let me know 
because I want to create a video on that topic</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
