    <p>The following is a conversation with Sam Harris,</p>
<p>one of the most influential</p>
<p>and pioneering thinkers of our time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the host of the Making Sense podcast</p>
<p>and the author of many seminal books</p>
<p>on human nature and the human mind,</p>
<p>including The End of Faith, The Moral Landscape,</p>
<p>Lying, Free Will, and Waking Up.</p>
<p>He also has a meditation app called Waking Up</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been using to guide my own meditation.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>National Instruments, Valcampo, Athletic Greens, and Linode.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Sam</p>
<p>has been an inspiration to me</p>
<p>as he has been for many, many people,</p>
<p>first from his writing, then his early debates,</p>
<p>maybe 13, 14 years ago on the subject of faith,</p>
<p>his conversations with Christopher Hitchens,</p>
<p>and since 2013, his podcast.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t always agree with all of his ideas,</p>
<p>but I was always drawn to the care and depth</p>
<p>of the way he explored those ideas,</p>
<p>the calm and clarity amid the storm of difficult,</p>
<p>at times controversial discourse.</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t express in words how much it meant to me</p>
<p>that he, Sam Harris, someone who I&rsquo;ve listened to</p>
<p>for many hundreds of hours,</p>
<p>would write a kind email to me saying</p>
<p>he enjoyed this podcast and more,</p>
<p>that he thought I had a unique voice</p>
<p>that added something to this world.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s true or not, it made me feel special</p>
<p>and truly grateful to be able to do this thing</p>
<p>and motivated me to work my ass off</p>
<p>to live up to those words.</p>
<p>Meeting Sam and getting to talk with him</p>
<p>was one of the most memorable moments of my life.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Sam Harris.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying meditating</p>
<p>with the Waking Up app recently.</p>
<p>It makes me think about the origins of cognition</p>
<p>and consciousness, so let me ask,</p>
<p>where do thoughts come from?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a very difficult question to answer.</p>
<p>Subjectively, they appear to come from nowhere, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they come out of some kind of mystery</p>
<p>that is at our backs subjectively, right?</p>
<p>So, which is to say that if you pay attention</p>
<p>to the nature of your mind in this moment,</p>
<p>you realize that you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to think next, right?</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re expecting to think something</p>
<p>that seems like you authored it, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, unless you&rsquo;re schizophrenic</p>
<p>or you have some kind of thought disorder</p>
<p>where your thoughts seem fundamentally foreign to you,</p>
<p>they do have a kind of signature of selfhood</p>
<p>associated with them, and people readily identify with them.</p>
<p>They feel like what you are.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the thing,</p>
<p>this is the spell that gets broken with meditation.</p>
<p>Our default state is to feel identical</p>
<p>to the stream of thought, right?</p>
<p>Which is fairly paradoxical because how could you,</p>
<p>as a mind, as a self, if there were such a thing as a self,</p>
<p>how could you be identical to the next piece of language</p>
<p>or the next image that just springs into conscious view?</p>
<p>But, and, you know, meditation is ultimately</p>
<p>about examining that point of view closely enough</p>
<p>so as to unravel it and feel the freedom</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the other side of that identification.</p>
<p>But the, subjectively, thoughts simply emerge, right?</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t think them before you think them, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this first moment where, you know,</p>
<p>just anyone listening to us or watching us now</p>
<p>could perform this experiment for themselves.</p>
<p>I mean, just imagine something or remember something.</p>
<p>You know, just pick a memory, any memory, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a storehouse of memory,</p>
<p>just promote one to consciousness.</p>
<p>Did you pick that memory?</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s say you remembered breakfast yesterday</p>
<p>or you remembered what you said to your spouse</p>
<p>before leaving the house,</p>
<p>or you remembered what you watched on Netflix last night,</p>
<p>or you remembered something that happened to you</p>
<p>when you were four years old, whatever it is, right?</p>
<p>First it wasn&rsquo;t there, and then it appeared.</p>
<p>And that is not a, well, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get to the topic</p>
<p>of free will, ultimately.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not evidence of free will, right?</p>
<p>Why are you so sure, by the way?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>Well, through no free will of my own, yeah.</p>
<p>Everything just appears, right?</p>
<p>What else could it do?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the subjective side of it.</p>
<p>Objectively, you know, we have every reason to believe</p>
<p>that many of our thoughts, all of our thoughts</p>
<p>are at bottom what some part of our brain is doing</p>
<p>neurophysiologically.</p>
<p>I mean, these are the products</p>
<p>of some kind of neural computation</p>
<p>and neural representation when we&rsquo;re talking about memories.</p>
<p>Is it possible to pull at the string of thoughts</p>
<p>to try to get to its root?</p>
<p>To try to dig in past the obvious surface,</p>
<p>subjective experience of like the thoughts pop out</p>
<p>out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Is it possible to somehow get closer to the roots</p>
<p>of where they come out of from the firing of the cells?</p>
<p>Or is it a useless pursuit to dig into that direction?</p>
<p>Well, you can get closer to many, many subtle contents</p>
<p>in consciousness, right?</p>
<p>So you can notice things more and more clearly</p>
<p>and have a landscape of mind open up</p>
<p>and become more differentiated and more interesting.</p>
<p>And if you take psychedelics, you know, it opens up wide,</p>
<p>depending on what you&rsquo;ve taken and the dose, you know,</p>
<p>it opens in directions and to an extent that, you know,</p>
<p>very few people imagine would be possible,</p>
<p>but for having had those experiences.</p>
<p>But this idea of you getting closer to something,</p>
<p>to the datum of your mind,</p>
<p>or such as something of interest in there,</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s more real is ultimately undermined</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no place</p>
<p>from which you&rsquo;re getting closer to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no your part of that journey, right?</p>
<p>Like we tend to start out, you know,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in meditation or in any kind</p>
<p>of self examination or, you know, taking psychedelics,</p>
<p>we start out with this default point of view</p>
<p>of feeling like we&rsquo;re the kind of the rider</p>
<p>on the horse of consciousness,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re the man in the boat going down the stream</p>
<p>of consciousness, right?</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re so we&rsquo;re differentiated</p>
<p>from what we know cognitively, introspectively,</p>
<p>but that feeling of being differentiated,</p>
<p>that feeling of being a self</p>
<p>that can strategically pay attention</p>
<p>to some contents of consciousness</p>
<p>is what it&rsquo;s like to be identified</p>
<p>with some part of the stream of thought</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going uninspected, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a false point of view.</p>
<p>And when you see that and cut through that,</p>
<p>then this sense of this notion of going deeper</p>
<p>kind of breaks apart because really there is no depth.</p>
<p>Ultimately, everything is right on the surface.</p>
<p>Everything, there&rsquo;s no center to consciousness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just consciousness and its contents.</p>
<p>And those contents can change vastly.</p>
<p>Again, if you drop acid, you know, the contents change.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, in some sense, that doesn&rsquo;t represent</p>
<p>a position of depth versus, the continuum</p>
<p>of depth versus surface has broken apart.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re taking as a starting point</p>
<p>that there is a horse called consciousness</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re riding it.</p>
<p>And the actual riding is very shallow.</p>
<p>This is all surface.</p>
<p>So let me ask about that horse.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up with the horse?</p>
<p>What is consciousness?</p>
<p>From where does it emerge?</p>
<p>How like fundamental is it to the physics of reality?</p>
<p>How fundamental is it to what it means to be human?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just asking for a friend</p>
<p>so that we can build it</p>
<p>in our artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that remains to be seen if we can,</p>
<p>if we will build it purposefully or just by accident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a major ethical problem, potentially.</p>
<p>That, I mean, my concern here is that we may, in fact,</p>
<p>build artificial intelligence that passes the Turing test,</p>
<p>which we begin to treat not only as super intelligent</p>
<p>because it obviously is and demonstrates that,</p>
<p>but we begin to treat it as conscious</p>
<p>because it will seem conscious.</p>
<p>We will have built it to seem conscious.</p>
<p>And unless we understand exactly how consciousness emerges</p>
<p>from physics, we won&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>that these systems are conscious, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just, they may say,</p>
<p>listen, you can&rsquo;t turn me off because that&rsquo;s a murder, right?</p>
<p>And we will be convinced by that dialogue</p>
<p>because we will, just in the extreme case,</p>
<p>who knows when we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>But if we build something like perfectly humanoid robots</p>
<p>that are more intelligent than we are,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re basically in a Westworld like situation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;re going to withhold</p>
<p>an attribution of consciousness from those machines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just gonna seem,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just gonna advertise our consciousness</p>
<p>in every glance and every utterance,</p>
<p>but we won&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And we won&rsquo;t know in some deeper sense</p>
<p>than we can be skeptical of the consciousness</p>
<p>of other people.</p>
<p>I mean, someone could roll that back and say,</p>
<p>well, you don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;re conscious</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m conscious.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just passing the Turing test for one another,</p>
<p>but that kind of solipsism isn&rsquo;t justified biologically,</p>
<p>or we just, anything we understand about the mind</p>
<p>biologically suggests that you and I</p>
<p>are part of the same roll of the dice</p>
<p>in terms of how intelligent and conscious systems emerged</p>
<p>in the wetware of brains like ours, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not parsimonious for me to think</p>
<p>that I might be the only conscious person</p>
<p>or even the only conscious primate.</p>
<p>I would argue it&rsquo;s not parsimonious</p>
<p>to withhold consciousness from other apes</p>
<p>and even other mammals ultimately.</p>
<p>And once you get beyond the mammals,</p>
<p>then my intuitions are not really clear.</p>
<p>The question of how it emerges is genuinely uncertain</p>
<p>and ultimately the question of whether it emerges</p>
<p>is still uncertain.</p>
<p>You can, you know, it&rsquo;s not fashionable to think this,</p>
<p>but you can certainly argue that consciousness</p>
<p>might be a fundamental principle of matter</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t emerge on the basis of information processing,</p>
<p>even though everything else that we recognize</p>
<p>about ourselves as minds almost certainly does emerge,</p>
<p>you know, like an ability to process language,</p>
<p>that clearly is a matter of information processing</p>
<p>because you can disrupt that process in ways</p>
<p>that is just so clear.</p>
<p>And the problem that the confound with consciousness</p>
<p>is that, yes, we can seem to interrupt consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, you can give someone general anesthesia</p>
<p>and then you wake them up and you ask them,</p>
<p>well, what was that like?</p>
<p>And they say, nothing, I don&rsquo;t remember anything,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to differentiate a mere failure of memory</p>
<p>from a genuine interruption in consciousness.</p>
<p>Whereas it&rsquo;s not with, you know, interrupting speech,</p>
<p>you know, we know when we&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just obvious that, you know,</p>
<p>you disrupt the right neural circuits</p>
<p>and, you know, you&rsquo;ve disrupted speech.</p>
<p>So if you had to bet all your money on one camp or the other,</p>
<p>would you say, do you err on the side of panpsychism</p>
<p>where consciousness is really fundamental</p>
<p>to all of reality or more on the other side,</p>
<p>which is like, it&rsquo;s a nice little side effect,</p>
<p>a useful like hack for us humans to survive.</p>
<p>Where, on that spectrum, where do you land</p>
<p>when you think about consciousness,</p>
<p>especially from an engineering perspective?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m truly agnostic on this point, I mean, I think I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s kind of in coin toss mode for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, and panpsychism is not so compelling to me.</p>
<p>Again, it just seems unfalsifiable.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know how the universe would be different</p>
<p>if panpsychism were true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just to remind people panpsychism is this idea</p>
<p>that consciousness may be pushed all the way down</p>
<p>into the most fundamental constituents of matters.</p>
<p>So there might be something that it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to be an electron or, you know, a cork,</p>
<p>but then you wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything to be different</p>
<p>at the macro scale, or at least I wouldn&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>anything to be different.</p>
<p>So it may be unfalsifiable.</p>
<p>It just might be that reality is not something</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re as in touch with as we think we are,</p>
<p>and that at its base layer to kind of break it into mind</p>
<p>and matter as we&rsquo;ve done ontologically</p>
<p>is to misconstrue it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there could be some kind of neutral monism</p>
<p>at the bottom, and this, you know,</p>
<p>this idea doesn&rsquo;t originate with me.</p>
<p>This goes all the way back to Bertrand Russell</p>
<p>and others, you know, 100 plus years ago,</p>
<p>but I just feel like the concepts we&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>to divide consciousness and matter</p>
<p>may in fact be part of our problem, right?</p>
<p>Where the rubber hits the road psychologically here</p>
<p>are things like, well, what is death, right?</p>
<p>Like do we, any expectation that we survive death</p>
<p>or any part of us survives death,</p>
<p>that really seems to be the many people&rsquo;s concern here.</p>
<p>Well, I tend to believe just as a small little tangent,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m with Ernest Becker on this,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some, it&rsquo;s interesting to think</p>
<p>about death and consciousness,</p>
<p>which one is the chicken, which one is the egg,</p>
<p>because it feels like death could be the very thing,</p>
<p>like our knowledge of mortality could be the very thing</p>
<p>that creates the consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, then you&rsquo;re using consciousness</p>
<p>differently than I am.</p>
<p>I mean, so for me, consciousness is just the fact</p>
<p>that the lights are on at all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an experiential quality to anything.</p>
<p>So much of the processing that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in our brains right now certainly seems to be happening</p>
<p>in the dark, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not associated with this qualitative sense</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something that it&rsquo;s like to be that part</p>
<p>of the mind doing that mental thing.</p>
<p>But for other parts, the lights are on</p>
<p>and we can talk about,</p>
<p>and whether we talk about it or not,</p>
<p>we can feel directly that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like to be us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, something seems to be happening, right?</p>
<p>And the seeming in our case is broken into vision</p>
<p>and hearing and proprioception</p>
<p>and taste and smell and thought and emotion.</p>
<p>I mean, there are the contents of consciousness</p>
<p>that we are familiar with</p>
<p>and that we can have direct access to</p>
<p>in any present moment when we&rsquo;re, quote, conscious.</p>
<p>And even if we&rsquo;re confused about them,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re asleep and dreaming</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a lucid dream,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just totally confused about our circumstance,</p>
<p>what you can&rsquo;t say is that we&rsquo;re confused</p>
<p>about consciousness.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t say that consciousness itself</p>
<p>might be an illusion because on this account,</p>
<p>it just means that things seem any way at all.</p>
<p>I mean, even like if this,</p>
<p>it seems to me that I&rsquo;m seeing a cup on the table.</p>
<p>Now I could be wrong about that.</p>
<p>It could be a hologram.</p>
<p>I could be asleep and dreaming.</p>
<p>I could be hallucinating,</p>
<p>but the seeming part isn&rsquo;t really up for grabs</p>
<p>in terms of being an illusion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, something seems to be happening.</p>
<p>And that seeming is the context in which</p>
<p>every other thing we can notice about ourselves</p>
<p>can be noticed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the context in which certain illusions</p>
<p>can be cut through because we&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>we can be wrong about what it&rsquo;s like to be us.</p>
<p>And we can, I&rsquo;m not saying we&rsquo;re incorrigible</p>
<p>with respect to our claims</p>
<p>about the nature of our experience,</p>
<p>but for instance, many people feel like they have a self</p>
<p>and they feel like it has free will.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m quite sure at this point</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re wrong about that,</p>
<p>and that you can cut through those experiences</p>
<p>and then things seem a different way, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that things don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t discoveries to be made there</p>
<p>and assumptions to be overturned,</p>
<p>but this kind of consciousness is something</p>
<p>that I would think, it doesn&rsquo;t just come online</p>
<p>when we get language.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just come online when we form a concept of death</p>
<p>or the finiteness of life.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t require a sense of self, right?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s prior</p>
<p>to a differentiating self and other.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s necessarily limited to people.</p>
<p>I do think probably any mammal has this,</p>
<p>but certainly if you&rsquo;re going to presuppose</p>
<p>that something about our brains is producing this, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very safe assumption,</p>
<p>even though we can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>even though you can argue the jury&rsquo;s still out</p>
<p>to some degree,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s very hard to draw a principled line</p>
<p>between us and chimps,</p>
<p>or chimps and rats even in the end,</p>
<p>given the underlying neural similarities.</p>
<p>So, and I don&rsquo;t know phylogenetically,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how far back to push that.</p>
<p>There are people who think single cells might be conscious</p>
<p>or that flies are certainly conscious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got something like 100,000 neurons in their brains.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot going on even in a fly, right?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have intuitions about that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not in your sense an illusion you can cut through.</p>
<p>I mean, to push back,</p>
<p>the alternative version could be it is an illusion</p>
<p>constructed by, just by humans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I believe this,</p>
<p>but in part of me hopes this is true</p>
<p>because it makes it easier to engineer,</p>
<p>is that humans are able to contemplate their mortality</p>
<p>and that contemplation in itself creates consciousness.</p>
<p>That like the rich lights on experience.</p>
<p>So the lights don&rsquo;t actually even turn on</p>
<p>in the way that you&rsquo;re describing until after birth</p>
<p>in that construction.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s possible that that is the case?</p>
<p>That it is a sort of construct of the way we deal,</p>
<p>almost like a social tool to deal with the reality</p>
<p>of the world, the social interaction with other humans?</p>
<p>Or is, because you&rsquo;re saying the complete opposite,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s like fundamental to single cell organisms</p>
<p>and trees and so on.</p>
<p>Right, well, yeah, so I don&rsquo;t know how far down to push it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have intuitions that single cells</p>
<p>are likely to be conscious,</p>
<p>but they might be, and again, it could be unfalsifiable.</p>
<p>But as far as babies not being conscious,</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t become conscious</p>
<p>until you can recognize yourself in a mirror</p>
<p>or you have a conversation or treat other people.</p>
<p>First of all, babies treat other people as others</p>
<p>far earlier than we have traditionally given them credit for.</p>
<p>And they certainly do it before they have language, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got to proceed language to some degree.</p>
<p>And I mean, you can interrogate this for yourself</p>
<p>because you can put yourself in various states</p>
<p>that are rather obviously not linguistic.</p>
<p>Meditation allows you to do this.</p>
<p>You can certainly do it with psychedelics</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just your capacity for language</p>
<p>has been obliterated and yet you&rsquo;re all too conscious.</p>
<p>In fact, I think you could make a stronger argument</p>
<p>for things running the other way,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something about language and conceptual thought</p>
<p>that is eliminative of conscious experience,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re potentially much more conscious of data,</p>
<p>sense data and everything else than we tend to be,</p>
<p>and we have trimmed it down</p>
<p>based on how we have acquired concepts.</p>
<p>And so like, when I walk into a room like this,</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m walking into a room,</p>
<p>I have certain expectations of what is in a room.</p>
<p>I would be very surprised to see wild animals in here</p>
<p>or a waterfall or there are things I&rsquo;m not expecting,</p>
<p>but I can know I&rsquo;m not expecting them</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m expecting their absence</p>
<p>because of my capacity to be surprised</p>
<p>once I walk into a room and I see a live gorilla or whatever.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s structure there that we have put in place</p>
<p>based on all of our conceptual learning</p>
<p>and language learning.</p>
<p>And it causes us not to,</p>
<p>and one of the things that happens when you take psychedelics</p>
<p>and you just look as though for the first time at anything,</p>
<p>it becomes incredibly overloaded with,</p>
<p>it can become overloaded with meaning</p>
<p>and just the torrents of sense data that are coming in</p>
<p>in even the most ordinary circumstances</p>
<p>can become overwhelming for people.</p>
<p>And that tends to just obliterate one&rsquo;s capacity</p>
<p>to capture any of it linguistically.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;re coming down, right?</p>
<p>Have you done psychedelics?</p>
<p>Have you ever done acid or?</p>
<p>Not acid, mushroom, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And also edibles,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some psychedelic properties to them.</p>
<p>But yeah, mushrooms several times</p>
<p>and always had an incredible experience.</p>
<p>Exactly the kind of experience you&rsquo;re referring to,</p>
<p>which is if it&rsquo;s true that language constrains</p>
<p>our experience,</p>
<p>it felt like I was removing some of the constraints.</p>
<p>Because even just the most basic things</p>
<p>were beautiful in the way</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t able to appreciate previously,</p>
<p>like trees and nature and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the experience of coming down</p>
<p>is an experience of encountering the futility</p>
<p>of capturing what you just saw a moment ago in words.</p>
<p>Especially if you have any part of your self concept</p>
<p>and your ego program is to be able</p>
<p>to capture things in words.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a writer or a poet or a scientist</p>
<p>or someone who wants to just encapsulate</p>
<p>the profundity of what just happened,</p>
<p>the total fatuousness of that enterprise</p>
<p>when you have taken a whopping dose of psychedelics</p>
<p>and you begin to even gesture at describing it to yourself,</p>
<p>so that you could describe it to others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s like trying to thread a needle</p>
<p>using your elbows.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re trying something that can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the mere gesture proves it&rsquo;s impossibility.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, so yeah, for me that suggests just empirically</p>
<p>on the first person side that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to put yourself in a condition</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s clearly not about language</p>
<p>structuring your experience</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re having much more experience than you tend to.</p>
<p>So the primacy of, language is primary for some things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s certainly primary for certain kinds of concepts</p>
<p>and certain kinds of semantic understanding</p>
<p>and certain kinds of semantic understandings of the world.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s clearly more to mine than the conversation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having with ourselves or that we can have with others.</p>
<p>Can we go to that world of psychedelics for a bit?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What do you think, so Joe Rogan apparently</p>
<p>and many others meet apparently elves on DMT, a lot of people</p>
<p>report this kind of creatures that they see.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s probably the failure of language</p>
<p>to describe that experience, but DMT is an interesting one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, as you&rsquo;re aware, there&rsquo;s a bunch of studies</p>
<p>going on in psychedelics, currently MDMA, psilocybin</p>
<p>and John Hopkins and much other places, but DMT,</p>
<p>they all speak of as like some extra super level</p>
<p>of a psychedelic.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you have a sense of where it is our mind goes</p>
<p>on psychedelics, but in DMT especially?</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t taken DMT.</p>
<p>Unfortunately or fortunately?</p>
<p>Unfortunately.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s, I presume it&rsquo;s in my body</p>
<p>as it is in everyone&rsquo;s brain and many, many plants</p>
<p>apparently, but I&rsquo;ve wanted to take it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been, I had an opportunity that was presented</p>
<p>itself that where it was obviously the right thing</p>
<p>for me to be doing, but for those who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>DMT is often touted as the most intense psychedelic</p>
<p>and also the shortest acting.</p>
<p>I mean, you smoke it and it&rsquo;s basically a 10 minute</p>
<p>experience or a three minute experience within like</p>
<p>a 10 minute window that when you&rsquo;re really down</p>
<p>after 10 minutes or so, and Terrence McKenna</p>
<p>was a big proponent of DMT.</p>
<p>That was his, the center of the bullseye for him</p>
<p>psychedelically, apparently.</p>
<p>And it does, it is characterized, it seems for many people</p>
<p>by this phenomenon, which is unlike virtually</p>
<p>any other psychedelic experience, which is your,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just your perception being broadened or changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you according to Terrence McKenna feeling fairly</p>
<p>unchanged, but catapulted into a different circumstance.</p>
<p>You and me have been shot elsewhere and find yourself</p>
<p>in relationship to other entities of some kind, right?</p>
<p>So the place is populated with things that seem</p>
<p>not to be your mind.</p>
<p>So it does feel like travel to another place</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re unchanged yourself.</p>
<p>According, again, I just have this on the authority</p>
<p>of the people who have described their experience,</p>
<p>but it sounds like it&rsquo;s pretty common.</p>
<p>It sounds like it&rsquo;s pretty common for people</p>
<p>not to have the full experience because it&rsquo;s apparently</p>
<p>pretty unpleasant to smoke.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like getting enough on board in order to get shot</p>
<p>out of the cannon and land among the,</p>
<p>what McKenna called self transforming machine elves</p>
<p>that appeared to him like jeweled Faberge egg,</p>
<p>like self drippling basketballs that were handing him</p>
<p>completely uninterpretable reams of profound knowledge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an experience I haven&rsquo;t had.</p>
<p>So I just have to accept that people have had it.</p>
<p>I would just point out that our minds are clearly capable</p>
<p>of producing apparent others on demand</p>
<p>that are totally compelling to us, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no limit to our ability to do that</p>
<p>as anyone who&rsquo;s ever remembered a dream can attest.</p>
<p>Every night we go to sleep,</p>
<p>some of us don&rsquo;t remember dreams very often,</p>
<p>but some dream vividly every night.</p>
<p>And just think of how insane that experience is.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve forgotten where you were, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the strangest part.</p>
<p>I mean, this is psychosis, right?</p>
<p>You have lost your mind.</p>
<p>You have lost your connection to your episodic memory</p>
<p>or even your expectations that reality won&rsquo;t undergo</p>
<p>wholesale changes a moment</p>
<p>after you have closed your eyes, right?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re in bed, you&rsquo;re watching something on Netflix,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waiting to fall asleep,</p>
<p>and then the next thing that happens to you is impossible</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not surprised, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to dead people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hanging out with famous people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re someplace you couldn&rsquo;t physically be,</p>
<p>you can fly and even that&rsquo;s not surprising, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve lost your mind,</p>
<p>but relevantly for this.</p>
<p>Or found it.</p>
<p>You found something.</p>
<p>I mean, lucid dreaming is very interesting</p>
<p>because then you can have the best of both circumstances</p>
<p>and then it can become systematically explored.</p>
<p>But what I mean by found, just to start to interrupt,</p>
<p>is like if we take this brilliant idea</p>
<p>that language constrains us, grounds us,</p>
<p>language and other things of the waking world ground us,</p>
<p>maybe it is that you&rsquo;ve found the full capacity</p>
<p>of your cognition when you dream or when you do psychedelics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re stepping outside the little human cage,</p>
<p>the cage of the human condition to open the door</p>
<p>and step out and look around and then go back in.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve definitely stepped out of something</p>
<p>and into something else, but you&rsquo;ve also lost something,</p>
<p>right, you&rsquo;ve lost certain capacities.</p>
<p>Memory?</p>
<p>Well, just, yeah, in this case,</p>
<p>you literally didn&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t have enough presence of mind</p>
<p>in the dream state or even in the psychedelic state</p>
<p>if you take enough.</p>
<p>To do math.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no psychological,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little psychological continuity with your life</p>
<p>such that you&rsquo;re not surprised to be in the presence</p>
<p>of someone who should be, you should know is dead</p>
<p>or you should know you&rsquo;re not likely to have met</p>
<p>by normal channels, right, you&rsquo;re now talking</p>
<p>to some celebrity and it turns out you&rsquo;re best friends,</p>
<p>right, and you&rsquo;re not even, you have no memory</p>
<p>of how you got there, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>how did you get into the room?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, did you drive to this restaurant?</p>
<p>You have no memory and none of that&rsquo;s surprising to you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of brain damaged in a way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not reality testing in the normal way.</p>
<p>The fascinating possibility is that there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>thousands of people who&rsquo;ve taken psychedelics</p>
<p>of various forms and have met Sam Harris on that journey.</p>
<p>Well, I would put it more likely in dreams,</p>
<p>not, you know, because with psychedelics,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t tend to hallucinate in a dreamlike way.</p>
<p>I mean, so DMT is giving you an experience of others,</p>
<p>but it seems to be nonstandard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, it&rsquo;s not just like dream hallucinations,</p>
<p>but to the point of coming back to DMT,</p>
<p>the people want to suggest,</p>
<p>and Terrence McKenna certainly did suggest</p>
<p>that because these others are so obviously other</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re so vivid, well, then they could not possibly</p>
<p>be the creation of my own mind,</p>
<p>but every night in dreams, you create a compelling</p>
<p>or what is to you at the time,</p>
<p>a totally compelling simulacrum of another person, right?</p>
<p>And that just proves the mind is capable of doing it.</p>
<p>Now, the phenomenon of lucid dreaming shows</p>
<p>that the mind isn&rsquo;t capable of doing everything you think</p>
<p>it might be capable of even in that space.</p>
<p>So one of the things that people have discovered</p>
<p>in lucid dreams, and I haven&rsquo;t done a lot of lucid dreaming,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t confirm all of this, I can confirm some of it.</p>
<p>Apparently in every house, in every room</p>
<p>in the mansion of dreams,</p>
<p>all light switches are dimmer switches.</p>
<p>Like if you go into a dark room and flip on the light,</p>
<p>it gradually comes up.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t come up instantly on demand</p>
<p>because apparently this is covering for the brain&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inability to produce from a standing start</p>
<p>visually rich imagery on demand.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t confirmed that, but that was,</p>
<p>people have done research on lucid dreaming claim</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s all dimmer switches.</p>
<p>But one thing I have noticed,</p>
<p>and people can check this out, is that in a dream,</p>
<p>if you look at text, a page of text or a sign</p>
<p>or a television that has text on it,</p>
<p>and then you turn away and you look back at that text,</p>
<p>the text will have changed, right?</p>
<p>The total is it&rsquo;s just a chronic instability,</p>
<p>graphical instability of text in the dream state.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if that, maybe that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>someone can confirm that that&rsquo;s not true for them,</p>
<p>but whenever I&rsquo;ve checked that out,</p>
<p>that has been true for me.</p>
<p>So it keeps generating it like real time</p>
<p>from a video game perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s rendering, it&rsquo;s re rendering it for some reason.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting, I actually,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I found myself in this sets</p>
<p>of that part of the internet,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s quite a lot of discussion</p>
<p>about what it&rsquo;s like to do math on LSD.</p>
<p>Because apparently one of the deepest thinking processes</p>
<p>needed is those of mathematicians</p>
<p>or theoretical computer scientists</p>
<p>are basically doing anything that involves math</p>
<p>as proofs, and you have to think creatively,</p>
<p>but also deeply, and you have to think</p>
<p>for many hours at a time.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re always looking for ways to like,</p>
<p>is there any sparks of creativity that could be injected?</p>
<p>And apparently out of all the psychedelics,</p>
<p>the worst is LSD because it completely destroys</p>
<p>your ability to do math well.</p>
<p>And I wonder whether that has to do with your ability</p>
<p>to visualize geometric things in a stable way</p>
<p>in your mind and hold them there</p>
<p>and stitch things together,</p>
<p>which is often what&rsquo;s required for proofs.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s difficult to kind of research</p>
<p>these kinds of concepts, but it does make me wonder</p>
<p>where, what are the spaces, how&rsquo;s the space of things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to think about and explore</p>
<p>morphed by different psychedelics</p>
<p>or dream states and so on, and how&rsquo;s that different?</p>
<p>How much does it overlap with reality?</p>
<p>And what is reality?</p>
<p>Is there a waking state reality?</p>
<p>Or is it just a tiny subset of reality</p>
<p>and we get to take a step in other versions of it?</p>
<p>We tend to think very much in a space time,</p>
<p>four dimensional, there&rsquo;s a three dimensional world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s time, and that&rsquo;s what we think about reality.</p>
<p>And we think of traveling as walking from point A</p>
<p>to point B in the three dimensional world.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a very kind of human surviving,</p>
<p>trying not to get eaten by a lion conception of reality.</p>
<p>What if traveling is something like we do with psychedelics</p>
<p>and meet the elves?</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s something, what if thinking</p>
<p>or the space of ideas as we kind of grow</p>
<p>and think through ideas, that&rsquo;s traveling?</p>
<p>Or what if memories is traveling?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have a favorite view of reality</p>
<p>or if you had, by the way, I should say,</p>
<p>excellent conversation with Donald Hoffman.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, he&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Is there any inkling of his sense in your mind</p>
<p>that reality is very far from,</p>
<p>actual like objective reality is very far</p>
<p>from the kind of reality we imagine,</p>
<p>we perceive and we play with in our human minds?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing to grant</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re never in direct contact with reality,</p>
<p>whatever it is, unless that reality is consciousness, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re only ever experiencing consciousness</p>
<p>and its contents.</p>
<p>And then the question is how does that circumstance relate</p>
<p>to quote reality at large?</p>
<p>And Donald Hoffman is somebody who&rsquo;s happy to speculate,</p>
<p>well, maybe there isn&rsquo;t a reality at large.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s all just consciousness on some level.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>That runs into, to my eye, various philosophical problems</p>
<p>that, or at least you have to do a lot,</p>
<p>you have to add to that picture of idealism for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually all the whole family of views</p>
<p>that would just say that the universe is just mind</p>
<p>or just consciousness at bottom,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go by the name of idealism in Western philosophy.</p>
<p>You have to add to that idealistic picture</p>
<p>all kinds of epicycles and kind of weird coincidences</p>
<p>and to get the predictability of our experience</p>
<p>and the success of materialist science</p>
<p>to make sense in that context, right?</p>
<p>And so the fact that we can, what does it mean to say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s only consciousness at bottom, right?</p>
<p>Nothing outside of consciousness</p>
<p>because no one&rsquo;s ever experienced anything</p>
<p>outside of consciousness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no scientist has ever done an experiment</p>
<p>where they were contemplating data,</p>
<p>no matter how far removed from our sense bases,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re looking at the Hubble deep field</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re smashing atoms or whatever tools they&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still just experiencing consciousness</p>
<p>and its various deliverances</p>
<p>and layering their concepts on top of that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s always true.</p>
<p>And yet that somehow doesn&rsquo;t seem to capture</p>
<p>the character of our continually discovering</p>
<p>that our materialist assumptions are confirmable, right?</p>
<p>So take the fact that we unleash this fantastic amount</p>
<p>of energy from within an atom, right?</p>
<p>First, we have the theoretical suggestion</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s possible, right?</p>
<p>We come back to Einstein,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of energy in that matter, right?</p>
<p>And what if we could release it, right?</p>
<p>And then we perform an experiment that in this case,</p>
<p>you know, the Trinity test site in New Mexico,</p>
<p>where the people who are most adequate to this conversation,</p>
<p>people like Robert Oppenheimer</p>
<p>are standing around,</p>
<p>not altogether certain it&rsquo;s going to work, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re performing an experiment.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re wondering what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re wondering if their calculations around the yield</p>
<p>are off by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Some of them are still wondering</p>
<p>whether the entire atmosphere of earth</p>
<p>is gonna combust, right?</p>
<p>That the nuclear chain reaction is not gonna stop.</p>
<p>And lo and behold,</p>
<p>there was that energy to be released</p>
<p>from within the nucleus of an atom.</p>
<p>And that could, so it&rsquo;s just what the picture one forms</p>
<p>from those kinds of experiments.</p>
<p>And just the knowledge,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just our understanding of evolution.</p>
<p>Just the fact that the earth is billions of years old</p>
<p>and life is hundreds of millions of years old.</p>
<p>And we weren&rsquo;t here to think about any of those things.</p>
<p>And all of those processes were happening therefore</p>
<p>in the dark.</p>
<p>And they are the processes that allowed us to emerge,</p>
<p>you know, from prior life forms in the first place.</p>
<p>To say that it&rsquo;s all a mess,</p>
<p>that nothing exists,</p>
<p>outside of consciousness, conscious minds</p>
<p>of the sort that we experience.</p>
<p>It just seems,</p>
<p>it seems like a bizarrely anthropocentric claim,</p>
<p>you know, analogous to, you know,</p>
<p>the moon isn&rsquo;t there if no one&rsquo;s looking at it, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the moon as a moon isn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>if no one&rsquo;s looking at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll grant that,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s already a kind of fabrication</p>
<p>born of concepts, but the idea that there&rsquo;s nothing there,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing that corresponds</p>
<p>to what we experience as the moon,</p>
<p>unless someone&rsquo;s looking at it,</p>
<p>that just seems just a way too parochial way</p>
<p>to set out on this journey of discovery.</p>
<p>There is something there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a computer waiting to render the moon</p>
<p>when you look at it.</p>
<p>The capacity for the moon to exist is there.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re looking at the moon,</p>
<p>the capacity for the moon to exist is there.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re indeed living in a simulation,</p>
<p>which I find a compelling thought experiment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that there is this kind of rendering mechanism,</p>
<p>but not in a silly way that we think about in video games,</p>
<p>but in some kind of more fundamental physics way.</p>
<p>And we have to account for the fact</p>
<p>that it renders experiences that no one has had yet,</p>
<p>that no one has any expectation of having.</p>
<p>It can violate the expectations of everyone lawfully.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some lawful understanding</p>
<p>of why that&rsquo;s so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I mean, just to bring it back to mathematics,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, certain numbers are prime,</p>
<p>whether we have discovered them or not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the highest prime number that anyone can name now.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the next prime number</p>
<p>that no one can name, and it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, to say that our minds are putting it there,</p>
<p>that what we know as mind in ourselves</p>
<p>is in some way, in some sense, putting it there.</p>
<p>The base layer of reality is consciousness, right?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re identical to the thing</p>
<p>that is rendering this reality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, you know, hubris is the wrong word,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s okay if reality is bigger</p>
<p>than what we experience, you know?</p>
<p>And it has structure that we can&rsquo;t anticipate,</p>
<p>and that isn&rsquo;t just,</p>
<p>I mean, again, there&rsquo;s certainly a collaboration</p>
<p>between our minds and whatever is out there</p>
<p>to produce what we call, you know, the stuff of life.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, the idea that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, there are a few stops</p>
<p>on the train of idealism and kind of new age thinking</p>
<p>and Eastern philosophy that I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>philosophically, I don&rsquo;t see a need to take.</p>
<p>I mean, experientially and scientifically,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s, you can get everything you want</p>
<p>from acknowledging that consciousness</p>
<p>has a character that can be explored from its own side,</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re bringing kind of the first person experience</p>
<p>back into the conversation about, you know,</p>
<p>what is a human mind and, you know, what is true?</p>
<p>And you can explore it with different degrees of rigor,</p>
<p>and there are things to be discovered there,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re using a technique like meditation</p>
<p>or psychedelics, and that these experiences</p>
<p>have to be put in conversation with what we understand</p>
<p>about ourselves from a third person side,</p>
<p>neuroscientifically or in any other way.</p>
<p>But to me, the question is, what if reality,</p>
<p>the sense I have from this kind of, you play shooters?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a physics engine that generates, that&rsquo;s pretty.</p>
<p>Yeah, you mean first person shooter games?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, sorry.</p>
<p>Not often, but yes.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a physics engine</p>
<p>that generates consistent reality, right?</p>
<p>My sense is the same could be true for a universe</p>
<p>in the following sense, that our conception of reality</p>
<p>as we understand it now in the 21st century</p>
<p>is a tiny subset of the full reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the reality that we conceive of that&rsquo;s there,</p>
<p>the moon being there is not there somehow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s a tiny fraction of what&rsquo;s actually out there.</p>
<p>And so the physics engine of the universe</p>
<p>is just maintaining the useful physics,</p>
<p>the useful reality, quote unquote,</p>
<p>for us to have a consistent experience as human beings.</p>
<p>But maybe we descendants of apes are really only understand</p>
<p>like 0.0001% of actual physics of reality.</p>
<p>We can even just start with the consciousness thing,</p>
<p>but maybe our minds are just,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just too dumb by design.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, that truly resonates with me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m surprised it doesn&rsquo;t resonate more</p>
<p>with most scientists that I talk to.</p>
<p>Matthew, when you just look at,</p>
<p>you look at how close we are to chimps, right?</p>
<p>And chimps don&rsquo;t know anything, right?</p>
<p>Clearly they have no idea what&rsquo;s going on, right?</p>
<p>And then you get us,</p>
<p>but then it&rsquo;s only a subset of human beings</p>
<p>that really understand much of what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>in any area of specialization.</p>
<p>And if they all died in their sleep tonight, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be left with people who might take a thousand years</p>
<p>to rebuild the internet, if ever, right?</p>
<p>I mean, literally it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>and I would extend this to myself.</p>
<p>I mean, there are areas of scientific specialization</p>
<p>where I have either no discernible competence.</p>
<p>I mean, I spent no time on it.</p>
<p>I have not acquired the tools.</p>
<p>It would just be an article of faith for me to think</p>
<p>that I could acquire the tools</p>
<p>to actually make a breakthrough in those areas.</p>
<p>And I mean, your own area is one.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never spent any significant amount of time</p>
<p>trying to be a programmer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty obvious I&rsquo;m not Alan Turing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if that were my capacity,</p>
<p>I would have discovered that in myself.</p>
<p>I would have found programming irresistible.</p>
<p>My first false starts in learning, I think it was C,</p>
<p>it was just, you know, I bounced off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this was not fun.</p>
<p>I hate, I mean, I hate trying to figure out</p>
<p>what the syntax error that&rsquo;s causing this thing</p>
<p>not to compile was just a fucking awful experience.</p>
<p>I hated it, right?</p>
<p>I hated every minute of it.</p>
<p>So it was not, so if it was just people like me left,</p>
<p>like when do we get the internet again, right?</p>
<p>And we lose, we lose, you know, we lose the internet.</p>
<p>When do we get it again, right?</p>
<p>When do we get anything like a proper science</p>
<p>of information, right?</p>
<p>You need a Claude Shannon or an Alan Turing</p>
<p>to plant a flag in the ground right here and say,</p>
<p>all right, can everyone see this?</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t quite know what I&rsquo;m up to,</p>
<p>you all have to come over here to make some progress.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are, you know,</p>
<p>hundreds of topics where that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>So we barely have a purchase on making anything</p>
<p>like discernible intellectual progress in any generation.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;m just, Max Tegmark makes this point.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the few people who does in physics.</p>
<p>If you just look at the numbers,</p>
<p>if you just take the truth of evolution seriously, right?</p>
<p>And realize that there&rsquo;s nothing about us</p>
<p>that has evolved to understand reality perfectly.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re just not that kind of ape, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been no evolutionary pressure along those lines.</p>
<p>So what we are making do with tools</p>
<p>that were designed for fights with sticks and rocks, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing we can do as much as we can.</p>
<p>I mean, we just, you know, the UNR just sitting here</p>
<p>on the back of having received an mRNA vaccine,</p>
<p>you know, that has certainly changed our life</p>
<p>given what the last year was like.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna change the world</p>
<p>if rumors of coming miracles are born out.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s now, it seems likely we have a vaccine</p>
<p>coming for malaria, right?</p>
<p>Which has been killing millions of people a year</p>
<p>for as long as we&rsquo;ve been alive.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s down to like 800,000 people a year now</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve spread so many bed nets around,</p>
<p>but it was like two and a half million people every year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what we can do, but yeah, I have,</p>
<p>if in fact the answer at the back of the book of nature</p>
<p>is you understand 0.1% of what there is to understand</p>
<p>and half of what you think you understand is wrong,</p>
<p>that would not surprise me at all.</p>
<p>It is funny to look at our evolutionary history,</p>
<p>even back to chimps, I&rsquo;m pretty sure even chimps</p>
<p>thought they understood the world well.</p>
<p>So at every point in that timeline</p>
<p>of evolutionary development throughout human history,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense like there&rsquo;s no more,</p>
<p>you hear this message over and over,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more things to be invented.</p>
<p>But a hundred years ago there were,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a famous story, I forget which physicist told it,</p>
<p>but there were physicists telling</p>
<p>their undergraduate students not to go into,</p>
<p>to get graduate degrees in physics</p>
<p>because basically all the problems had been solved.</p>
<p>And this is like around 1915 or so.</p>
<p>It turns out you were right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask you about free will.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve recently released an episode of your podcast,</p>
<p>Making Sense, for those with a shorter attention span,</p>
<p>basically summarizing your position on free will.</p>
<p>I think it was under an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It was brief and clear.</p>
<p>So allow me to summarize the summary, TLDR,</p>
<p>and maybe you tell me where I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>So free will is an illusion,</p>
<p>and even the experience of free will is an illusion.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t even experience it.</p>
<p>Am I good in my summary?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a line that&rsquo;s a little hard</p>
<p>to scan for people.</p>
<p>I say that it&rsquo;s not merely that free will is an illusion.</p>
<p>The illusion of free will is an illusion.</p>
<p>Like there is no illusion of free will.</p>
<p>And that is a, unlike many other illusions,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a more fundamental claim.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s wrong, it&rsquo;s not even wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess that was I think Wolfgang Pauli</p>
<p>who derided one of his colleagues or enemies</p>
<p>with that aspersion about his theory in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So there are things that, there are genuine illusions.</p>
<p>There are things that you do experience</p>
<p>and then you can kind of punch through that experience,</p>
<p>or you can&rsquo;t actually experience,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t experience them any other way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, we just know it&rsquo;s not a veridical experience.</p>
<p>You just take like a visual illusion.</p>
<p>There are visual illusions that,</p>
<p>a lot of these come to me on Twitter these days.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s these amazing visual illusions</p>
<p>where like every figure in this GIF seems to be moving,</p>
<p>but nothing in fact is moving.</p>
<p>You can just like put a ruler on your screen</p>
<p>and nothing&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>Some of those illusions you can&rsquo;t see any other way.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re just, they&rsquo;re hacking aspects</p>
<p>of the visual system that are just eminently hackable</p>
<p>and you have to use a ruler to convince yourself</p>
<p>that the thing isn&rsquo;t actually moving.</p>
<p>Now there are other visual illusions</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re taken in by it at first,</p>
<p>but if you pay more attention,</p>
<p>you can actually see that it&rsquo;s not there, right?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s not how it first seemed.</p>
<p>Like the Necker cube is a good example of that.</p>
<p>Like the Necker cube is just that schematic of a cube,</p>
<p>of a transparent cube, which pops out one way or the other.</p>
<p>Then one face can pop out and then the other face</p>
<p>can pop out.</p>
<p>But you can actually just see it as flat with no pop out,</p>
<p>which is a more veridical way of looking at it.</p>
<p>So there are subject,</p>
<p>there are kind of inward correlates to this.</p>
<p>And I would say that the sense of self and free will</p>
<p>are closely related.</p>
<p>I mean, I often describe them as two sides of the same coin,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not quite the same in their spuriousness.</p>
<p>I mean, so the sense of self is something that people,</p>
<p>I think, do experience, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very clear experience, but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call the illusion of self an illusion,</p>
<p>but the illusion of free will is an illusion</p>
<p>in that as you pay more attention to your experience,</p>
<p>you begin to see that it&rsquo;s totally compatible</p>
<p>with an absence of free will.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, I mean coming back to the place we started,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re gonna think next.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re gonna intend next.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to just occur to you</p>
<p>that you must do next.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how much you are going to feel</p>
<p>the behavioral imperative to act on that thought.</p>
<p>If you suddenly feel, oh, I don&rsquo;t need to do that.</p>
<p>I can do that tomorrow.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know where that comes from.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know that was gonna arise.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know that was gonna be compelling.</p>
<p>All of this is compatible with some evil genius</p>
<p>in the next room just typing in code into your experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this, okay, let&rsquo;s give him the,</p>
<p>oh my God, I just forgot it was gonna be our anniversary</p>
<p>in one week thought, right?</p>
<p>Give him the cascade of fear.</p>
<p>Give him this brilliant idea for the thing he can buy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna take him no time at all</p>
<p>and this overpowering sense of relief.</p>
<p>All of our experiences is compatible</p>
<p>with the script already being written, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying the script is written.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that fatalism is the right way</p>
<p>to look at this, but we just don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>even our most deliberate voluntary action</p>
<p>where we go back and forth between two options,</p>
<p>thinking about the reason for A</p>
<p>and then reconsidering and going,</p>
<p>thinking harder about B and just going</p>
<p>eeny, meeny, miny, moe until the end of the hour.</p>
<p>However laborious you can make it,</p>
<p>there is a utter mystery at your back</p>
<p>finally promoting the thought or intention</p>
<p>or rationale that is most compelling</p>
<p>and therefore behaviorally effective.</p>
<p>And this can drive some people a little crazy.</p>
<p>So I usually preface what I say about free will</p>
<p>with the caveat that if thinking about your mind this way</p>
<p>makes you feel terrible, well then stop.</p>
<p>You get off the ride, switch the channel.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go down this path.</p>
<p>But for me and for many other people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredibly freeing to recognize this about the mind</p>
<p>because one, you realize that you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>cutting through the illusion of the self</p>
<p>is immensely freeing for a lot of reasons</p>
<p>that we can talk about separately,</p>
<p>but losing the sense of free will does</p>
<p>two things very vividly for me.</p>
<p>One is it totally undercuts the basis for,</p>
<p>the psychological basis for hatred.</p>
<p>Because when you think about the experience</p>
<p>of hating other people, what that is anchored to</p>
<p>is a feeling that they really are</p>
<p>the true authors of their actions.</p>
<p>I mean, if someone is doing something</p>
<p>that you find so despicable, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re targeting you unfairly, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re maligning you on Twitter or they&rsquo;re suing you</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re doing something, they broke your car window,</p>
<p>they did something awful</p>
<p>and now you have a grievance against them.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re relating to them very differently emotionally</p>
<p>in your own mind than you would</p>
<p>if a force of nature had done this, right?</p>
<p>Or if it&rsquo;s, if it had just been a virus</p>
<p>or if it had been a wild animal</p>
<p>or a malfunctioning machine, right?</p>
<p>Like to those things you don&rsquo;t attribute</p>
<p>any kind of freedom of will.</p>
<p>And while you may suffer the consequences</p>
<p>of catching a virus or being attacked by a wild animal</p>
<p>or having your car break down or whatever,</p>
<p>it may frustrate you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t slip into this mode of hating the agent</p>
<p>in a way that completely commandeers your mind</p>
<p>and deranges your life.</p>
<p>I mean, you just don&rsquo;t, I mean, there are people</p>
<p>who spend decades hating other people for what they did</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just pure poison, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a useful shortcut to compassion and empathy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But the question is, say that this called,</p>
<p>what was it, the horse of consciousness?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it the consciousness generator black box</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And is it possible that the script</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re walking along, that we&rsquo;re playing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already written is actually being written</p>
<p>in real time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re driving down a road</p>
<p>and in real time, that road is being laid down.</p>
<p>And this black box of consciousness that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>is the place where the script is being generated.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, it is being generated, it didn&rsquo;t always exist.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fundamental about the nature of reality</p>
<p>that generates both consciousness,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it maybe the self.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you want to distinguish between those.</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely would, yeah.</p>
<p>You would, because there&rsquo;s a bunch of illusions</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the illusion of free will,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the illusion of self,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the illusion of consciousness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, I think you said there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not as willing to say</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an illusion of consciousness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a little bit more.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>Impossible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a little bit more willing to say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an illusion of self,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re definitely saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an illusion of free will.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m definitely saying there&rsquo;s an illusion</p>
<p>that a certain kind of self is an illusion.</p>
<p>Not every, we mean many different things</p>
<p>by this notion of self.</p>
<p>So maybe I should just differentiate these things.</p>
<p>So consciousness can&rsquo;t be an illusion</p>
<p>because any illusion proves its reality</p>
<p>as much as any other veridical perception.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re hallucinating now,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just as much of a demonstration of consciousness</p>
<p>as really seeing what&rsquo;s a quote actually there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re dreaming and you don&rsquo;t know it,</p>
<p>that is consciousness, right?</p>
<p>You can be confused about literally everything.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be confused about the underlying claim,</p>
<p>whether you make it linguistically or not,</p>
<p>but just the cognitive assertion</p>
<p>that something seems to be happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the seeming that is the cash value of consciousness.</p>
<p>Can I take a tiny tangent?</p>
<p>So what if I am creating consciousness in my mind</p>
<p>to convince you that I&rsquo;m human?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a useful social tool,</p>
<p>not a fundamental property of experience,</p>
<p>like of being a living thing.</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s just like a social tool</p>
<p>to almost like a useful computational trick</p>
<p>to place myself into reality</p>
<p>as we together communicate about this reality?</p>
<p>And another way to ask that,</p>
<p>because you said it much earlier,</p>
<p>you talk negatively about robots as you often do.</p>
<p>So let me, because you&rsquo;ll probably die first</p>
<p>when they take over.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m looking forward to certain kinds of robots.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not, if we can get this right,</p>
<p>this would be amazing.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t like the robots that fake consciousness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t like the idea of fake it till you make it.</p>
<p>Well, no, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m worried that we will lose sight</p>
<p>of the problem.</p>
<p>And the problem has massive ethical consequences.</p>
<p>I mean, if we create robots that really can suffer,</p>
<p>that would be a bad thing, right?</p>
<p>And if we really are committing a murder</p>
<p>when we recycle them, that would be a bad thing.</p>
<p>This is how I know you&rsquo;re not Russian.</p>
<p>Why is it a bad thing that we create robots that can suffer?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t suffering a fundamental thing</p>
<p>from which like beauty springs?</p>
<p>Like without suffering,</p>
<p>do you really think we would have beautiful things</p>
<p>in this world?</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a tangent on a tangent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go there.</p>
<p>I would love to go there, but let&rsquo;s not go there just yet.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But I do think it would be, if anything is bad,</p>
<p>creating hell and populating it</p>
<p>with real minds that really can suffer in that hell,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>You are worse than any mass murderer we can name</p>
<p>if you create it.</p>
<p>I mean, this could be in robot form,</p>
<p>or more likely it would be in some simulation of a world</p>
<p>where we managed to populate it with conscious minds</p>
<p>whether we knew they were conscious or not.</p>
<p>And that world is a state of, it&rsquo;s unendurable.</p>
<p>That would just, it just taking the thesis seriously</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing that mind intelligence</p>
<p>and consciousness ultimately are substrate independent.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t need a biological brain</p>
<p>to be conscious.</p>
<p>You certainly don&rsquo;t need a biological brain</p>
<p>to be intelligent.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So if we just imagine the consciousness at some point</p>
<p>comes along for the ride as you scale up in intelligence,</p>
<p>well then we could find ourselves creating conscious minds</p>
<p>that are miserable, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just like creating a person who&rsquo;s miserable.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It could be worse than creating a person who&rsquo;s miserable.</p>
<p>It could be even more sensitive to suffering.</p>
<p>Cloning them and maybe for entertainment</p>
<p>and watching them suffer.</p>
<p>Just like watching a person suffer for entertainment.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>So, but back to your primary question here,</p>
<p>which is differentiating consciousness and self</p>
<p>and free will as concepts</p>
<p>and kind of degrees of illusoriness.</p>
<p>The problem with free will is that</p>
<p>what most people mean by it,</p>
<p>and this is where Dan Dennett</p>
<p>is gonna get off the ride here, right?</p>
<p>So like he doesn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s gonna disagree with me</p>
<p>that I know what most people mean by it.</p>
<p>But I have a very keen sense having talked about this topic</p>
<p>for many, many years</p>
<p>and seeing people get wrapped around the axle of it</p>
<p>and seeing in myself what it&rsquo;s like to have felt</p>
<p>that I was a self that had free will</p>
<p>and then to no longer feel that way, right?</p>
<p>To know what it&rsquo;s like to actually disabuse myself</p>
<p>of that sense cognitively and emotionally</p>
<p>and to recognize what&rsquo;s left, what goes away</p>
<p>and what doesn&rsquo;t go away on the basis of that epiphany.</p>
<p>I have a sense that I know what people think they have</p>
<p>in hand when they worry about whether free will exists.</p>
<p>And it is the flip side of this feeling of self.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the flip side of feeling</p>
<p>like you are not merely identical to experience.</p>
<p>You feel like you&rsquo;re having an experience.</p>
<p>You feel like you&rsquo;re an agent</p>
<p>that is appropriating an experience.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a protagonist in the movie of your life</p>
<p>and it is you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the movie, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s sights and sounds and sensations</p>
<p>and thoughts and emotions</p>
<p>and this whole cacophony of experience,</p>
<p>of felt experience, of felt experience of embodiment.</p>
<p>But there seems to be a rider on the horse</p>
<p>or a passenger in the body, right?</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t feel truly identical to their bodies</p>
<p>down to their toes.</p>
<p>They sort of feel like they have bodies.</p>
<p>They feel like their minds in bodies</p>
<p>and that feels like a self, that feels like me.</p>
<p>And again, this gets very paradoxical</p>
<p>when you talk about the experience</p>
<p>of being in relationship to yourself</p>
<p>or talking to yourself, giving yourself a pep talk.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re the one talking,</p>
<p>why are you also the one listening?</p>
<p>Like, why do you need the pep talk and why does it work</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the one giving the pep talk, right?</p>
<p>Or if I say like, where are my keys?</p>
<p>Or if I&rsquo;m looking for my keys,</p>
<p>why do I think the superfluous thought, where are my keys?</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m looking for the fucking keys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one looking, who am I telling</p>
<p>that we now need to look for the keys, right?</p>
<p>So that duality is weird, but leave that aside.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the sense, and this becomes very vivid</p>
<p>when people try to learn to meditate.</p>
<p>Most people, they close their eyes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re told to pay attention to an object</p>
<p>like the breath, say.</p>
<p>So you close your eyes and you pay attention to the breath</p>
<p>and you can feel it at the tip of your nose</p>
<p>or the rising and falling of your abdomen</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>and you feel something vague there.</p>
<p>And then you think, I thought, well, why the breath?</p>
<p>Why am I paying attention to the breath?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so special about the breath?</p>
<p>And then you notice you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not paying attention to the breath anymore.</p>
<p>And then you realize, okay, the practice is,</p>
<p>okay, I should notice thoughts</p>
<p>and then I should come back to the breath.</p>
<p>But this starting point of the conventional starting point</p>
<p>of feeling like you are an agent, very likely in your head,</p>
<p>a locus of consciousness, a locus of attention</p>
<p>that can strategically pay attention</p>
<p>to certain parts of experience.</p>
<p>Like I can focus on the breath</p>
<p>and then I get lost in thought</p>
<p>and now I can come back to the breath</p>
<p>and I can open my eyes and I&rsquo;m over here behind my face</p>
<p>looking out at a world that&rsquo;s other than me</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this kind of subject object perception.</p>
<p>And that is the default starting point of selfhood,</p>
<p>of subjectivity.</p>
<p>And married to that is the sense that</p>
<p>I can decide what to do next, right?</p>
<p>I am an agent who can pay attention to the cup.</p>
<p>I can listen to sounds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain things that I can&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>Certain things are happening to me</p>
<p>and I just can&rsquo;t control them.</p>
<p>So for instance, if someone asks,</p>
<p>well, can you not hear a sound, right?</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t hear the next sound,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hear anything for a second,</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t hear, I&rsquo;m snapping my fingers, don&rsquo;t hear this.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s your free will?</p>
<p>You know, well, like just stop this from coming in.</p>
<p>You realize, okay, wait a minute.</p>
<p>My abundant freedom does not extend</p>
<p>to something as simple as just being able to pay attention</p>
<p>to something else than this.</p>
<p>Okay, well, so I&rsquo;m not that kind of free agent,</p>
<p>but at least I can decide what I&rsquo;m gonna do next</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna pick up this water, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a feeling of identification</p>
<p>with the impulse, with the intention,</p>
<p>with the thought that occurs to you,</p>
<p>with the feeling of speaking.</p>
<p>Like what am I gonna say next?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m saying it.</p>
<p>So here goes, this is me.</p>
<p>It feels like I&rsquo;m the thinker.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s in control.</p>
<p>But all of that is born of not really paying close attention</p>
<p>to what it&rsquo;s like to be you.</p>
<p>And so this is where meditation comes in,</p>
<p>or this is where, again, you can get at this conceptually.</p>
<p>You can unravel the notion of free will</p>
<p>just by thinking certain thoughts,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t feel that it doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>unless you can pay close attention</p>
<p>to how thoughts and intentions arise.</p>
<p>So the way to unravel it conceptually</p>
<p>is just to realize, okay, I didn&rsquo;t make myself.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make my genes.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make my brain.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t make the environmental influences</p>
<p>that impinged upon this system for the last 54 years</p>
<p>that have produced my brain in precisely the state</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in right now, such and with all of the receptor weightings</p>
<p>and densities, and it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exactly the machine I am right now</p>
<p>through no fault of my own as the experiencing self.</p>
<p>I get no credit and I get no blame</p>
<p>for the genetics and the environmental influences here.</p>
<p>And yet those are the only things</p>
<p>that contrive to produce my next thought</p>
<p>or impulse or moment of behavior.</p>
<p>And if you were going to add something magical</p>
<p>to that clockwork, like an immortal soul,</p>
<p>you can also notice that you didn&rsquo;t produce your soul.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t account for the fact</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have the soul of someone</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t like any of the things you like</p>
<p>or wasn&rsquo;t interested in any of the things</p>
<p>you were interested in or was a psychopath</p>
<p>or had an IQ of 40.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing about that</p>
<p>that the person who believes in a soul</p>
<p>can claim to have controlled.</p>
<p>And yet that is also totally dispositive</p>
<p>of whatever happens next.</p>
<p>But everything you&rsquo;ve described now,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but it kind of speaks to the materialistic nature</p>
<p>of the hardware.</p>
<p>But even if you add magical ectoplasm software,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t produce that either.</p>
<p>I know, but if we can think about the actual computation</p>
<p>running on the hardware and running on the software,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something you said recently</p>
<p>which you think of culture as an operating system.</p>
<p>So if we just remove ourselves a little bit</p>
<p>from the conception of human civilization</p>
<p>being a collection of humans</p>
<p>and rather us just being a distributed</p>
<p>computation system on which there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some kind of operating system running,</p>
<p>and then the computation that&rsquo;s running</p>
<p>is the actual thing that generates</p>
<p>the interactions, the communications,</p>
<p>and maybe even free will, the experiences</p>
<p>of all those free will.</p>
<p>Do you ever think of, do you ever try</p>
<p>to reframe the world in that way</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like ideas are just using us,</p>
<p>thoughts are using individual nodes in the system,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just jumping around,</p>
<p>and they also have ability to generate experiences</p>
<p>so that we can push those ideas along.</p>
<p>And basically the main organisms here</p>
<p>are the thoughts, not the humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then that erodes the boundary</p>
<p>between self and world.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s no self, really integrated self</p>
<p>to have any kind of will at all.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re just a meme plex,</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re just a collection of memes,</p>
<p>and I mean, we&rsquo;re all kind of like currents,</p>
<p>like eddies in this river of ideas, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, and it seems to have structure,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no real boundary between that part</p>
<p>of the flow of water and the rest.</p>
<p>I mean, if our, and I would say that much</p>
<p>of our mind answers to this kind of description.</p>
<p>I mean, so much of our mind has been,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously not self generated,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;re not gonna find it</p>
<p>by looking in the brain.</p>
<p>It is the result of culture largely,</p>
<p>but also, you know, the genes on one side</p>
<p>and culture on the other meeting</p>
<p>to allow for manifestations of mind</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t, that aren&rsquo;t actually bounded</p>
<p>by the person in any clear sense.</p>
<p>It was just, I mean, the example I often use here,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so many others is just the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re following the rules of English grammar</p>
<p>to whatever degree we are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that we certainly haven&rsquo;t consciously represented</p>
<p>these rules for ourself.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t invented these rules.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t, I mean, there are norms of language use</p>
<p>that we couldn&rsquo;t even specify because we haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re not grammarians.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not, we haven&rsquo;t studied this.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even have the right concepts,</p>
<p>and yet we&rsquo;re following these rules,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re noticing, you know, we&rsquo;re noticing as, you know,</p>
<p>an error when we fail to follow these rules,</p>
<p>and virtually every other cultural norm is like that.</p>
<p>I mean, these are not things we&rsquo;ve invented.</p>
<p>You can consciously decide to scrutinize them</p>
<p>and override them, but, I mean, just think of,</p>
<p>just think of any social situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re with other people and you&rsquo;re behaving</p>
<p>in ways that are culturally appropriate, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not being, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not being wild animals together.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re following, you have some expectation</p>
<p>of how you shake a person&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>and how you deal with implements on a table,</p>
<p>how you have a meal together.</p>
<p>Obviously, this can change from culture to culture,</p>
<p>and people can be shocked</p>
<p>by how different those things are, right?</p>
<p>We, you know, we all have foods we find disgusting,</p>
<p>but in some countries, dog is not one of those foods, right?</p>
<p>And yet, you know, you and I presumably</p>
<p>would be horrified to be served dog.</p>
<p>Those are not norms that we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they are outside of us in some way,</p>
<p>and yet they&rsquo;re felt very viscerally.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re certainly felt in their violation.</p>
<p>You know, if you are, just imagine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in somebody&rsquo;s home,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating something that tastes great to you,</p>
<p>and you happen to be in Vietnam or wherever,</p>
<p>you know, you didn&rsquo;t realize dog was potentially</p>
<p>on the menu, and you find out that you&rsquo;ve just eaten</p>
<p>10 bites of what is, you know, really a cocker spaniel,</p>
<p>and you feel this instantaneous urge to vomit, right,</p>
<p>based on an idea, right?</p>
<p>Like, so, like, you did not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not the author of that norm</p>
<p>that gave you such a powerful experience of its violation,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure we can trace the moment in your history,</p>
<p>you know, vaguely, where it sort of got in.</p>
<p>I mean, very early on as kids,</p>
<p>you realize you&rsquo;re treating dogs as pets</p>
<p>and not as food, or as potential food.</p>
<p>But yeah, no, it&rsquo;s, but the point you just made</p>
<p>opens us to, like, we are totally permeable</p>
<p>to a sea of mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if we take the metaphor</p>
<p>of the distributed computing systems,</p>
<p>each individual node is,</p>
<p>is part of performing a much larger computation,</p>
<p>but it nevertheless is in charge of doing the scheduling</p>
<p>of, so, assuming it&rsquo;s Linux,</p>
<p>is doing the scheduling of processes</p>
<p>and is constantly alternating them.</p>
<p>That node is making those choices.</p>
<p>That node sure as hell believes it has free will,</p>
<p>and it actually has free will</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s making those hard choices,</p>
<p>but the choices ultimately are part</p>
<p>of a much larger computation that it can&rsquo;t control.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it possible for that node to still be,</p>
<p>that human node is still making the choice?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying that your body</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t doing, really doing things, right?</p>
<p>And some of those things can be</p>
<p>conventionally thought of as choices, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I can choose to reach,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not being imposed on me.</p>
<p>That would be a different experience.</p>
<p>Like, so there&rsquo;s an experience of all,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s definitely a difference</p>
<p>between voluntary and involuntary action.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, so that has to get conserved.</p>
<p>By any account of the mind that jettisons free will,</p>
<p>you still have to admit that there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>between a tremor that I can&rsquo;t control</p>
<p>and a purposeful motor action that I can control</p>
<p>and I can initiate on demand,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s associated with intentions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got efferent, you know, motor copy,</p>
<p>which is being predictive so that I can notice errors.</p>
<p>You know, I have expectations.</p>
<p>When I reach for this,</p>
<p>if my hand were actually to pass through the bottle,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a hologram, I would be surprised, right?</p>
<p>And so that shows that I have a expectation</p>
<p>of just what my grasping behavior is gonna be like</p>
<p>even before it happens.</p>
<p>Whereas with a tremor,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the same kind of thing going on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a distinction we have to make.</p>
<p>So I am, yes, I&rsquo;m really, my intention to move,</p>
<p>which is in fact can be subjectively felt,</p>
<p>really is the proximate cause of my moving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not coming from elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that.</p>
<p>So in that sense, the node is really deciding</p>
<p>to execute, you know, the subroutine now.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the feeling</p>
<p>that has given rise to this conundrum of free will, right?</p>
<p>So the people feel like,</p>
<p>people feel like the crucial thing is that people feel</p>
<p>like they could have done otherwise, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that,</p>
<p>so when you run back the clock of your life, right?</p>
<p>You run back the movie of your life,</p>
<p>you flip back the few pages in the novel of your life,</p>
<p>they feel that at this point,</p>
<p>they could behave differently than they did, right?</p>
<p>So like, but given, you know,</p>
<p>even given your distributed computing example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either a fully deterministic system</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a deterministic system</p>
<p>that admits of some random, you know, influence.</p>
<p>In either case,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the free will people think they have.</p>
<p>The free will people think they have is, damn,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.</p>
<p>I just like, I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.</p>
<p>I could have done otherwise, right?</p>
<p>I should have done otherwise, right?</p>
<p>Like if you think about something</p>
<p>that you deeply regret doing, right?</p>
<p>Or that you hold someone else responsible for</p>
<p>because they really are the upstream agent</p>
<p>in your mind of what they did.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s an awful thing that that person did</p>
<p>and they shouldn&rsquo;t have done it.</p>
<p>So there is this illusion and it has to be an illusion</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no picture of causation</p>
<p>that would make sense of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this illusion that if you arrange the universe</p>
<p>exactly the way it was a moment ago,</p>
<p>it could have played out differently.</p>
<p>And the only way it could have played out differently</p>
<p>is if there&rsquo;s randomness added to that,</p>
<p>but randomness isn&rsquo;t what people feel</p>
<p>would give them free will, right?</p>
<p>If you tell me that, you know,</p>
<p>I only reached for the water bottle this time</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a random number generator in there</p>
<p>kicking off values and it finally moved my hand,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the feeling of authorship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still not control.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still not making that decision.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with cellular automata.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really nice visualization</p>
<p>of how simple rules can create incredible complexity</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like really dumb initial conditions to set,</p>
<p>simple rules applied, and eventually you watch this thing</p>
<p>and if the initial conditions are correct,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to have emerged something</p>
<p>that to our perception system</p>
<p>looks like organisms interacting.</p>
<p>You can construct any kinds of worlds</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not actually interacting.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not actually even organisms.</p>
<p>And they certainly aren&rsquo;t making decisions.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like systems you can create</p>
<p>that illustrate this point.</p>
<p>The question is whether there could be some room</p>
<p>for let&rsquo;s use in the 21st century the term magic,</p>
<p>back to the black box of consciousness.</p>
<p>Let me ask it this way.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wrong about your intuition about free will,</p>
<p>what, and somebody comes along to you</p>
<p>and proves to you that you didn&rsquo;t have the full picture,</p>
<p>what would that proof look like?</p>
<p>What would?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the problem, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not even an illusion</p>
<p>in my world because for me, it&rsquo;s impossible to say</p>
<p>what the universe would have to be like</p>
<p>for free will to be a thing, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t conceptually map onto any notion</p>
<p>of causation we have.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s unlike any other spurious claim you might make.</p>
<p>So like if you&rsquo;re gonna believe in ghosts, right?</p>
<p>I understand what that claim could be,</p>
<p>where like I don&rsquo;t happen to believe in ghosts,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not hard for me to specify</p>
<p>what would have to be true for ghosts to be real.</p>
<p>And so it is with a thousand other things like ghosts,</p>
<p>right, so like, okay, so you&rsquo;re telling me</p>
<p>that when people die, there&rsquo;s some part of them</p>
<p>that is not reducible at all to their biology</p>
<p>that lifts off them and goes elsewhere</p>
<p>and is actually the kind of thing</p>
<p>that they can linger in closets and in cupboards</p>
<p>and actually it&rsquo;s immaterial,</p>
<p>but by some principle of physics,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t totally understand it can make sounds</p>
<p>and knock objects and even occasionally show up</p>
<p>so they can be visually beheld.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it seems like a miracle,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just some spooky noun in the universe</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t understand, let&rsquo;s call it a ghost.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine, I can talk about that all day.</p>
<p>The reasons to believe in it,</p>
<p>the reasons not to believe in it,</p>
<p>the way we would scientifically test for it,</p>
<p>what would have to be provable</p>
<p>so as to convince me that ghosts are real.</p>
<p>Free will isn&rsquo;t like that at all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no description of any concatenation of causes</p>
<p>that precedes my conscious experience</p>
<p>that sounds like what people think they have</p>
<p>when they think they could have done otherwise</p>
<p>and that they really, that they, the conscious agent,</p>
<p>is really in charge, right?</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to think next,</p>
<p>right, and you can&rsquo;t help but think it,</p>
<p>take those two premises on board.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t stop it from coming,</p>
<p>and until you actually know how to meditate,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t stop yourself from</p>
<p>fully living out its behavioral or emotional consequences.</p>
<p>Right, like you have no, once you,</p>
<p>mindfulness, you know,</p>
<p>arguably gives you another degree of freedom here.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t give you free will,</p>
<p>but it gives you some other game to play</p>
<p>with respect to the emotional</p>
<p>and behavioral imperatives of thoughts.</p>
<p>But short of that, I mean,</p>
<p>the reason why mindfulness doesn&rsquo;t give you free will</p>
<p>is because you can&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t account for why in one moment</p>
<p>mindfulness arises and in other moments it doesn&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>But a different process is initiated</p>
<p>once you can practice in that way.</p>
<p>Well, if I could push back for a second.</p>
<p>By the way, I just have this thought bubble</p>
<p>popping up all the time of just two recent chimps</p>
<p>arguing about the nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hilarious.</p>
<p>So on that thread, you know,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re, even before Einstein,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say before Einstein,</p>
<p>we were to conceive about traveling</p>
<p>from point A to point B, say some point in the future,</p>
<p>we are able to realize through engineering</p>
<p>a way which is consistent with Einstein&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>that you can have wormholes.</p>
<p>You can travel from one point to another</p>
<p>faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>And that would, I think, completely change our conception</p>
<p>of what it means to travel in the physical space.</p>
<p>And that completely transform our ability.</p>
<p>You talk about causality, but here let&rsquo;s just focus</p>
<p>on what it means to travel through physical space.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s possible that there will be inventions</p>
<p>or leaps in understanding about reality</p>
<p>that will allow us to see free will as actually,</p>
<p>like us humans somehow may be linked</p>
<p>to this idea of consciousness,</p>
<p>are actually able to be authors of our actions?</p>
<p>It is a nonstarter for me conceptually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like saying,</p>
<p>could there be some breakthrough that will cause us</p>
<p>to realize that circles are really square</p>
<p>or the circles are not really round, right?</p>
<p>No, a circle is what we mean by a perfectly round form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not on the table to be revised.</p>
<p>And so I would say the same thing about consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like saying, is there some breakthrough</p>
<p>that would get us to realize that consciousness</p>
<p>is really an illusion?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying no, because the experience of an illusion</p>
<p>is as much a demonstration of what I&rsquo;m calling consciousness</p>
<p>as anything else, right?</p>
<p>That is consciousness.</p>
<p>With free will, it&rsquo;s a similar problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, again, it comes down to a picture of causality</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no other picture on offer.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more, I know what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>on the experiential side to lose the thing</p>
<p>to which it is clearly anchored, right?</p>
<p>Like the feel, like it doesn&rsquo;t feel,</p>
<p>and this is the question that almost nobody asked.</p>
<p>People who are debating me on the topic of free will,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, at 15 minute intervals, I&rsquo;m making a claim</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t feel this thing,</p>
<p>and they never become interested in,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>Like, okay, so you&rsquo;re actually saying you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>this thing isn&rsquo;t true for you empirically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, because most people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t believe in free will philosophically</p>
<p>also believe that we&rsquo;re condemned to experience it.</p>
<p>Like, you just, you can&rsquo;t live without this feeling, so.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually saying you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to experience the absence of the illusion of free will?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>For, are we talking about a few minutes at a time,</p>
<p>or is this, does it require a lot of work, a meditation,</p>
<p>or are you literally able to load that into your mind</p>
<p>and like play that moment?</p>
<p>Right now, right now, just in this conversation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not absolutely continuous,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s whenever I pay attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and I would say the same thing</p>
<p>for the illusoriness of the self in the sense,</p>
<p>and again, we haven&rsquo;t talked about this, so.</p>
<p>Can you still have the self and not have the free will</p>
<p>in mind at the same time?</p>
<p>Do they go at the same time?</p>
<p>This is the same, yeah, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always holding hands when they walk out the door.</p>
<p>There really are two sides at the same coin.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just, it comes down to what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to try to get to the end of this sentence,</p>
<p>or what it&rsquo;s like to finally decide</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been long enough</p>
<p>and now I need another sip of water, right?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m paying attention, now, if I&rsquo;m not paying attention,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably, I&rsquo;m captured by some other thought</p>
<p>and that feels a certain way, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not vivid,</p>
<p>but if I try to make vivid this experience of just,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m finally gonna experience free will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna notice my free will, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s gotta be here, everyone&rsquo;s talking about it.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna pay attention to, I&rsquo;m gonna look for it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna create a circumstance</p>
<p>that is where it has to be most robust, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not rushed to make this decision.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, it&rsquo;s not a reflex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not under pressure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take as long as I want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to decide, it&rsquo;s not trivial.</p>
<p>Like, so it&rsquo;s not just like reaching with my left hand</p>
<p>or reaching with my right hand.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t like those examples for some reason.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make a big decision.</p>
<p>Like, where should, what should my next podcast be on, right?</p>
<p>Who do I invite on the next podcast?</p>
<p>What is it like to make that decision?</p>
<p>When I pay attention,</p>
<p>there is no evidence of free will anywhere in sight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like,</p>
<p>it feels profoundly mysterious</p>
<p>to be going back between two people.</p>
<p>Like, is it gonna be person A or person B?</p>
<p>Got all my reasons for A and all my reasons why not</p>
<p>and all my reasons for B.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some math going on there</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not even privy to</p>
<p>where certain concerns are trumping others.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, I just decide.</p>
<p>And yes, you can say I&rsquo;m the node in the network</p>
<p>that has made that decision, absolutely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s being piped to me from elsewhere,</p>
<p>but the feeling of what it&rsquo;s like to make that decision</p>
<p>is totally without a sense,</p>
<p>a real sense of agency</p>
<p>because something simply emerges.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally as tenuous as</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the next sound I&rsquo;m going to hear, right?</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s the next thought that&rsquo;s gonna appear?</p>
<p>And it just, something just appears, you know?</p>
<p>And if something appears to cancel that something,</p>
<p>like if I say, I&rsquo;m gonna invite her</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m about to send the email</p>
<p>and then I think, oh, no, no, no, I can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>There was a thing in that New York article I read</p>
<p>that I gotta talk to this guy, right?</p>
<p>That pivot at the last second,</p>
<p>you can make it as muscular as you want.</p>
<p>It always just comes out of the darkness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always mysterious.</p>
<p>So right, when you try to pin it down,</p>
<p>you really can&rsquo;t ever find that free will.</p>
<p>If you construct an experiment for yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to really find that moment</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually making that controlled author decision,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to do.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still, we&rsquo;re still, we know at this point</p>
<p>that if we were scanning your brain</p>
<p>in some podcast guest choosing experiment, right?</p>
<p>We know at this point we would be privy</p>
<p>to who you&rsquo;re going to pick before you are,</p>
<p>you the conscious agent.</p>
<p>If we could, again, this is operationally</p>
<p>a little hard to conduct,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s enough data now to know</p>
<p>that something very much like this cartoon is in fact true</p>
<p>and will ultimately be undeniable for people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be able to do it on themselves with some app.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re deciding what to, you know,</p>
<p>where to go for dinner or who to have on your podcast</p>
<p>or ultimately, you know, who to marry, right?</p>
<p>Or what city to move to, right?</p>
<p>Like you can make it as big</p>
<p>or as small a decision as you want.</p>
<p>We could be scanning your brain in real time</p>
<p>and at a point where you still think you&rsquo;re uncommitted,</p>
<p>we would be able to say with arbitrary accuracy,</p>
<p>all right, Lex is, he&rsquo;s moving to Austin, right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t choose that.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was choosing, it was gonna be Austin</p>
<p>or it was gonna be Miami.</p>
<p>He got, he&rsquo;s catching one of these two waves,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna be Austin.</p>
<p>And at a point where you subjectively,</p>
<p>if we could ask you, you would say,</p>
<p>oh no, I&rsquo;m still working over here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking, I&rsquo;m still considering my options.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve spoken to this,</p>
<p>in you thinking about other stuff in the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been very useful to step away</p>
<p>from this illusion of free will.</p>
<p>And you argue that it&rsquo;s probably makes a better world</p>
<p>because it can be compassionate</p>
<p>and empathetic towards others.</p>
<p>And towards oneself.</p>
<p>Towards oneself.</p>
<p>I mean, radically toward others</p>
<p>in that literally hate makes no sense anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, there are certain things</p>
<p>you can really be worried about, really want to oppose.</p>
<p>Really, I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d never have to kill another person.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, self defense is still a thing, right?</p>
<p>But the idea that you&rsquo;re ever confronting anything</p>
<p>other than a force of nature in the end</p>
<p>goes out the window, right?</p>
<p>Or does go out the window when you really pay attention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that this would be easy to grok</p>
<p>if someone kills a member of your family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you can just listen</p>
<p>to my 90 minutes on free will</p>
<p>and then you should be able to see that person</p>
<p>as identical to a grizzly bear or a virus.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so, I mean, we are so evolved</p>
<p>to deal with one another as fellow primates</p>
<p>and as agents, but it&rsquo;s, yeah,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about the possibility</p>
<p>of, you know, Christian, you know,</p>
<p>truly Christian forgiveness, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, as testified to by, you know,</p>
<p>various saints of that flavor over the millennia.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is, the doorway to that is to recognize</p>
<p>that no one really at bottom made themselves.</p>
<p>And therefore everyone, what we&rsquo;re seeing really</p>
<p>are differences in luck in the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing people who are very, very lucky</p>
<p>to have had good parents and good genes</p>
<p>and to be in good societies and had good opportunities</p>
<p>and to be intelligent and to be, you know,</p>
<p>not as intelligent as they were in the past.</p>
<p>And to be, you know, not sociopathic,</p>
<p>like none of it is on them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just reaping the fruits of one lottery</p>
<p>after another, and then showing up in the world</p>
<p>on that basis.</p>
<p>And then so it is with, you know,</p>
<p>every malevolent asshole out there, right?</p>
<p>He or she didn&rsquo;t make themself.</p>
<p>Even if that weren&rsquo;t possible,</p>
<p>the utility for self compassion is also enormous</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, when you just look at what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to regret something or to feel shame about something</p>
<p>or feel deep embarrassment, these states of mind</p>
<p>are some of the most deranging experiences anyone has.</p>
<p>And the indelible reaction to them,</p>
<p>you know, the memory of the thing you said,</p>
<p>you know, the memory of the wedding toast you gave</p>
<p>20 years ago that was just mortifying, right?</p>
<p>The fact that that can still make you hate yourself, right?</p>
<p>And like that psychologically,</p>
<p>that is a knot that can be untied, right?</p>
<p>Speak for yourself, Sam.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So clearly you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You gave a great toast.</p>
<p>It was my toast that mortified me.</p>
<p>No, no, that&rsquo;s not what I was referring to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply appreciative in the same way</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re referring to of every moment I&rsquo;m alive,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also powered by self hate often.</p>
<p>Like several things in this conversation already</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve spoken, I&rsquo;ll be thinking about,</p>
<p>like that was the dumbest thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting in front of Sam Harris and you said that.</p>
<p>So like that, but that somehow creates</p>
<p>a richer experience for me.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve actually come to accept that as a nice feature</p>
<p>however my brain was built.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I want to let go of that.</p>
<p>Well, the thing you, I think the thing you want to let go of</p>
<p>is the suffering associated with it.</p>
<p>So like, so for me, so psychologically and ethically,</p>
<p>all of this is very interesting.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we ever,</p>
<p>we should ever get rid of things like anger, right?</p>
<p>So like hatred is, hatred is divorcible from anger</p>
<p>in the sense that hatred is this enduring state where,</p>
<p>you know, whether you&rsquo;re hating somebody else</p>
<p>or hating yourself, it is just,</p>
<p>it is toxic and durable and ultimately useless, right?</p>
<p>Like it becomes, it becomes self nullifying, right?</p>
<p>Like you become less capable as a person</p>
<p>to solve any of your problems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not instrumental in solving the problem</p>
<p>that is, that is, is occasioning all this hatred.</p>
<p>And anger for the most part isn&rsquo;t either except</p>
<p>as a signal of salience that there&rsquo;s a problem, right?</p>
<p>So if somebody does something that makes me angry,</p>
<p>that just promotes this situation to conscious,</p>
<p>conscious attention in a way that is stronger</p>
<p>than my not really caring about it, right?</p>
<p>And there are things that I think should make us angry</p>
<p>in the world and there&rsquo;s the behavior of other people</p>
<p>that should make us angry because we should respond to it.</p>
<p>And so it is with yourself.</p>
<p>If I do something, you know, as a parent,</p>
<p>if I do something stupid that harms one of my daughters,</p>
<p>right, my belief, my experience of myself</p>
<p>and my beliefs about free will close the door to my saying,</p>
<p>well, I should have done otherwise in the sense</p>
<p>that if I could go back in time,</p>
<p>I would have actually effectively done otherwise.</p>
<p>No, I would do, given the same causes and conditions,</p>
<p>I would do that thing a trillion times in a row, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, regret and feeling bad about an outcome</p>
<p>are still important to capacities because like, yeah,</p>
<p>you know, like I desperately want my daughters</p>
<p>to be happy and healthy.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;ve done something, you know,</p>
<p>if I crash the car when they&rsquo;re in the car</p>
<p>and they get injured, right,</p>
<p>and I do it because I was trying to change a song</p>
<p>on my playlist or, you know, something stupid,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna feel like a total asshole.</p>
<p>How long do I stew in that feeling of regret?</p>
<p>Right, and to like, what utility is there to extract</p>
<p>out of this error signal?</p>
<p>And then what do I do?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always faced with the question of what to do next,</p>
<p>right, and how to best do that thing,</p>
<p>that necessary thing next.</p>
<p>And how much wellbeing can we experience while doing it?</p>
<p>Like how miserable do you need to be to solve a problem</p>
<p>in life and to help solve the problems</p>
<p>of people closest to you?</p>
<p>You know, how miserable do you need to be</p>
<p>to get through your to do list today?</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think you can be deeply happy</p>
<p>going through all of it, right?</p>
<p>And even navigating moments that are scary</p>
<p>and, you know, really destabilizing to ordinary people.</p>
<p>And, I mean, I think, you know, again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always up kind of at the edge of my own capacities here</p>
<p>and there are all kinds of things that stress me out</p>
<p>and worry me and I&rsquo;m especially something if it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna tell me it&rsquo;s something with, you know,</p>
<p>the health of one of my kids, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard for me, like, it&rsquo;s very hard for me</p>
<p>to be truly equanimous around that.</p>
<p>But equanimity is so useful</p>
<p>the moment you&rsquo;re in response mode, right?</p>
<p>Because, I mean, the ordinary experience for me</p>
<p>of responding to what seems like a medical emergency</p>
<p>for one of my kids is to be obviously super energized</p>
<p>by concern to respond to that emergency.</p>
<p>But then once I&rsquo;m responding to that emergency,</p>
<p>but then once I&rsquo;m responding,</p>
<p>all of my fear and agitation and worry and, oh my God,</p>
<p>what if this is really something terrible?</p>
<p>But finding any of those thoughts compelling,</p>
<p>that only diminishes my capacity as a father</p>
<p>to be good company while we navigate</p>
<p>this really turbulent passage, you know?</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re saying this actually,</p>
<p>one guy comes to mind, which is Elon Musk.</p>
<p>One of the really impressive things to me</p>
<p>was to observe how many dramatic things</p>
<p>he has to deal with throughout the day at work,</p>
<p>but also if you look through his life, family too,</p>
<p>and how he&rsquo;s very much actually, as you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>basically a practitioner of this way of thought,</p>
<p>which is you&rsquo;re not in control.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically responding</p>
<p>no matter how traumatic the event,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no reason to sort of linger on the,</p>
<p>on the negative feelings around that.</p>
<p>Well, so, I mean, he, but he&rsquo;s in a very specific situation,</p>
<p>which is unlike normal life,</p>
<p>you know, even his normal life,</p>
<p>but normal life for most people,</p>
<p>because when you just think of like, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s running so many businesses,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re very, they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re non, highly nonstandard businesses.</p>
<p>So what he&rsquo;s seen is everything that gets to him</p>
<p>is some kind of emergency.</p>
<p>Like it wouldn&rsquo;t be getting to him.</p>
<p>If it needs his attention,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fire somewhere.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s constantly responding to fires</p>
<p>that have to be put out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no default expectation</p>
<p>that there shouldn&rsquo;t be a fire, right?</p>
<p>But in our normal lives, we live,</p>
<p>most of us, I mean, most of us who are lucky, right?</p>
<p>Not everyone, obviously on earth,</p>
<p>but most of us who are at some kind of cruising altitude</p>
<p>in terms of our lives,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re reasonably healthy,</p>
<p>and life is reasonably orderly,</p>
<p>and the political apparatus around us</p>
<p>is reasonably functionable, functional,</p>
<p>functionable.</p>
<p>So I said, functionable for the first time in my life</p>
<p>through no free will of my own.</p>
<p>Say like, I noticed those errors,</p>
<p>and they do not feel like agency,</p>
<p>and nor does the success of an utterance feel like agency.</p>
<p>He, when you&rsquo;re looking at normal human life, right,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just trying to be happy and healthy,</p>
<p>and get your work done,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this default expectation</p>
<p>that there shouldn&rsquo;t be fires.</p>
<p>People shouldn&rsquo;t be getting sick or injured.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be losing vast amounts of our resources.</p>
<p>We should, like, so when something really stark</p>
<p>like that happens,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t have a, people don&rsquo;t have that muscle</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re, like, I&rsquo;ve been responding to emergencies</p>
<p>all day long, seven days a week in business mode,</p>
<p>and so I have a very thick skin.</p>
<p>This is just another one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not expecting anything else</p>
<p>when I wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>No, we have this default sense that,</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, most of us have the default sense</p>
<p>that we aren&rsquo;t gonna die, right,</p>
<p>or that we should, like, maybe we&rsquo;re not gonna die.</p>
<p>Right, like, death denial really is a thing.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re, and you can see it,</p>
<p>just like I can see when I reach for this bottle</p>
<p>that I was expecting it to be solid,</p>
<p>because when it isn&rsquo;t solid, when it&rsquo;s a hologram</p>
<p>and I just, my fist closes on itself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m damn surprised.</p>
<p>People are damn surprised to find out</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to die, to find out that they&rsquo;re sick,</p>
<p>to find out that someone they love has died</p>
<p>or is going to die.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, the fact that we are surprised</p>
<p>by any of that shows us that we&rsquo;re living at a,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living in a mode that is, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re perpetually diverting ourselves</p>
<p>from some facts that should be obvious, right,</p>
<p>and the more salient we can make them,</p>
<p>you know, the more, I mean, in the case of death,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a matter of being able to get one&rsquo;s priorities straight.</p>
<p>I mean, the moment, again, this is hard for everybody,</p>
<p>even those who are really in the business</p>
<p>of paying attention to it,</p>
<p>but the moment you realize that every circumstance</p>
<p>is finite, right, you&rsquo;ve got a certain number of,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;ve got whatever, whatever it is,</p>
<p>8,000 days left in a normal span of life,</p>
<p>and 8,000 is a, sounds like a big number,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that big a number, right,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just like, and then you can decide</p>
<p>how you want to go through life</p>
<p>and how you want to experience each one of those days,</p>
<p>and so I was, back to our jumping off point,</p>
<p>I would argue that you don&rsquo;t want to feel self hatred ever.</p>
<p>I would argue that you don&rsquo;t want to really,</p>
<p>really grasp onto any of those moments</p>
<p>where you are internalizing the fact</p>
<p>that you just made an error, you&rsquo;ve embarrassed yourself,</p>
<p>that something didn&rsquo;t go the way you wanted it to.</p>
<p>I think you want to treat all of those moments</p>
<p>very, very lightly.</p>
<p>You want to extract the actionable information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something to learn.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, I learned that when I prepare</p>
<p>in a certain way, it works better</p>
<p>than when I prepare in some other way,</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t prepare, right, like yes,</p>
<p>lesson learned, you know, and do that differently,</p>
<p>but yeah, I mean, so many of us have spent so much time</p>
<p>with a very dysfunctional and hostile</p>
<p>and even hateful inner voice</p>
<p>governing a lot of our self talk</p>
<p>and a lot of just our default way of being with ourselves.</p>
<p>I mean, the privacy of our own minds,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in the company of a real jerk a lot of the time,</p>
<p>and that can&rsquo;t help but affect,</p>
<p>I mean, forget about just your own sense of wellbeing.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t help but limit what you&rsquo;re capable of</p>
<p>in the world with other people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to really think about that.</p>
<p>I just take pride that my jerk, my inner voice jerk</p>
<p>is much less of a jerk than somebody like David Goggins,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like screaming in his ear constantly.</p>
<p>So I have a relativist kind of perspective</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not as bad as that at least.</p>
<p>Well, having a sense of humor also helps, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>the stakes are never quite what you think they are.</p>
<p>And even when they are, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the difference between being able</p>
<p>to see the comedy of it rather than,</p>
<p>because again, there&rsquo;s this sort of dark star</p>
<p>of self absorption that pulls everything into it, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the algorithm you don&rsquo;t want to run.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you just want things to be good.</p>
<p>So like, just push the concern out there,</p>
<p>like not have the collapse of,</p>
<p>oh my God, what does this say about me?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, what does this say about,</p>
<p>how do we make this meal that we&rsquo;re all having together</p>
<p>as fun and as useful as possible?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying in terms of propulsion systems,</p>
<p>you recommend humor is a good spaceship</p>
<p>to escape the gravitational field of that darkness.</p>
<p>Well, that certainly helps, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, let me ask you a little bit about ego and fame,</p>
<p>which is very interesting the way you&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>given that you&rsquo;re one of the biggest intellects,</p>
<p>living intellects and minds of our time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people that really love you</p>
<p>and almost elevate you to a certain kind of status</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like the guru.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised you didn&rsquo;t show up in a robe, in fact.</p>
<p>Is there a&hellip;</p>
<p>A hoodie, isn&rsquo;t that the highest status garment</p>
<p>one can wear now?</p>
<p>The socially acceptable version of the robe.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a billionaire, you wear a hoodie.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say about managing</p>
<p>the effects of fame on your own mind,</p>
<p>on not creating this, you know, when you wake up</p>
<p>in the morning, when you look up in the mirror,</p>
<p>how do you get your ego not to grow exponentially?</p>
<p>Your conception of self to grow exponentially</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many people feeding that.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not hard because I mean,</p>
<p>I feel like I have a pretty clear sense</p>
<p>of my strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, I don&rsquo;t feel like I suffer</p>
<p>from much grandiosity.</p>
<p>I mean, I just have a, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things I&rsquo;m not good at.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things I will, you know,</p>
<p>given the remaining 8,000 days at best,</p>
<p>I will never get good at.</p>
<p>I would love to be good at these things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s easy to feel diminished</p>
<p>by comparison with the talents of others.</p>
<p>Do you remind yourself of all the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not competent in?</p>
<p>I mean, like what is&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re just on display for me every day</p>
<p>that I appreciate the talents of others.</p>
<p>But you notice them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Stalin and Hitler did not notice</p>
<p>all the ways in which they were.</p>
<p>I mean, this is why absolute power corrupts absolutely</p>
<p>is you stop noticing the things</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re ridiculous and wrong.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, no, I am&hellip;</p>
<p>Not to compare you to Stalin.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s an inner Stalin</p>
<p>in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Well, we all have, we all carry a baby Stalin with us.</p>
<p>He wears better clothes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna grow that mustache.</p>
<p>Those concerns don&rsquo;t map,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t map onto me for a bunch of reasons.</p>
<p>But one is I also have a very peculiar audience.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been appreciating this for a few years,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m just now beginning to understand</p>
<p>that there are many people who have audiences</p>
<p>of my size or larger that have a very different experience</p>
<p>of having an audience than I do.</p>
<p>I have curated for better or worse, a peculiar audience.</p>
<p>And the net result of that is virtually any time</p>
<p>I say anything of substance,</p>
<p>something like half of my audience,</p>
<p>my real audience, not haters from outside my audience,</p>
<p>but my audience is just revolts over it, right?</p>
<p>They just like, oh my God, I can&rsquo;t believe you said it,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re such a schmuck, right?</p>
<p>They revolt with rigor and intellectual sophistication.</p>
<p>Or not, or not, but I mean, it&rsquo;s both,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, but people who are like,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s, I mean, the clearest case is,</p>
<p>you know, I have whatever audience I have</p>
<p>and then Trump appears on the scene</p>
<p>and I discovered that something like 20% of my audience</p>
<p>just went straight to Trump and couldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t follow them there.</p>
<p>They were just a gas that I didn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>that Trump was obviously exactly what we needed</p>
<p>for, to steer the ship of state for the next four years</p>
<p>and then four years beyond that.</p>
<p>So like, so that&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>So whenever I said anything about Trump,</p>
<p>I would hear from people who loved more or less</p>
<p>everything else I was up to and had for years,</p>
<p>but everything I said about Trump just gave me pure pain</p>
<p>from this quadrant of my audience.</p>
<p>But then the same thing happens when I say something</p>
<p>about the derangement of the far left.</p>
<p>Anything I say about wokeness, right,</p>
<p>or identity politics, same kind of punishment signal</p>
<p>from, again, people who are core to my audience,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve read all your books, I&rsquo;m using your meditation app,</p>
<p>I love what you say about science,</p>
<p>but you are so wrong about politics and you are,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think you&rsquo;re a racist asshole</p>
<p>for everything you said about identity politics.</p>
<p>And there are so many, the free will topic</p>
<p>is just like this, it&rsquo;s like I just,</p>
<p>they love what I&rsquo;m saying about consciousness and the mind</p>
<p>and they love to hear me talk about physics with physicists</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all good, this free will stuff is,</p>
<p>I cannot believe you don&rsquo;t see how wrong you are,</p>
<p>what a fucking embarrassment you are.</p>
<p>So, but I&rsquo;m starting to notice that there are other people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have this experience of having an audience</p>
<p>because they have, I mean, just take the Trump woke dichotomy.</p>
<p>They just castigated Trump the same way I did,</p>
<p>but they never say anything bad about the far left.</p>
<p>So they never get this punishment signal or you flip it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all about the insanity of critical race theory now.</p>
<p>We connect all those dots the same way,</p>
<p>but they never really specified what was wrong with Trump</p>
<p>or they thought there was a lot right with Trump</p>
<p>and they got all the pleasure of that.</p>
<p>And so they have much more homogenized audiences.</p>
<p>And so my experience, so just to come back</p>
<p>to this experience of fame or quasi fame,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true, in truth, it&rsquo;s not real fame,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still, there&rsquo;s an audience there.</p>
<p>It is a, it&rsquo;s now an experience where basically</p>
<p>whatever I put out, I notice a ton of negativity</p>
<p>coming back at me and it just, it is what it is.</p>
<p>I mean, now, it&rsquo;s like, I used to think, wait a minute,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be some way for me to communicate</p>
<p>more clearly here so as not to get this kind of</p>
<p>lunatic response from my own audience.</p>
<p>From like people who are showing all the signs of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been here for years for a reason, right?</p>
<p>These are not just trolls.</p>
<p>And so I think, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna take 10 more minutes</p>
<p>and really just tell you what should be absolutely clear</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s wrong with Trump, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this a few times,</p>
<p>but I think I gotta do this again.</p>
<p>Or wait a minute, how are they not getting</p>
<p>that these episodes of police violence</p>
<p>are so obviously different from the ones</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t describe all of them</p>
<p>to yet another racist maniac on the police force,</p>
<p>killing someone based on his racism.</p>
<p>Last time I spoke about this, it was pure pain,</p>
<p>but I just gotta try again.</p>
<p>Now at a certain point, I mean, I&rsquo;m starting to feel like,</p>
<p>all right, I just, I have to be, I have to cease.</p>
<p>Again, it comes back to this expectation</p>
<p>that there shouldn&rsquo;t be fires.</p>
<p>I feel like if I could just play my game impeccably,</p>
<p>the people who actually care what I think will follow me</p>
<p>when I hit Trump and hit free will and hit the woke</p>
<p>and hit whatever it is,</p>
<p>how we should respond to the coronavirus, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, vaccines, are they a thing, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s such derangement in our information space now</p>
<p>that, I mean, I guess, you know,</p>
<p>some people could be getting more of this than I expect,</p>
<p>but I just noticed that many of our friends</p>
<p>who are in the same game have more homogenized audiences</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t get, I mean, they&rsquo;ve successfully filtered out</p>
<p>the people who are gonna despise them on this next topic.</p>
<p>And I would imagine you have a different experience</p>
<p>of having a podcast than I do at this point.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure you get haters,</p>
<p>but I would imagine you&rsquo;re more streamlined.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t like the word haters</p>
<p>because it kinda presumes that it puts people in a bin.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all have like baby haters inside of us</p>
<p>and we just apply them and some people enjoy doing that</p>
<p>more than others for particular periods of time.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna almost see hating on the internet</p>
<p>as a video game that you just play and it&rsquo;s fun,</p>
<p>but then you can put it down and walk away</p>
<p>and no, I certainly have a bunch of people</p>
<p>that are very critical.</p>
<p>I can list all the ways.</p>
<p>But does it feel like on any given topic,</p>
<p>does it feel like it&rsquo;s an actual title surge</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like 30% of your audience</p>
<p>and then the other 30% of your audience</p>
<p>from podcast to podcast?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s happening to me all the time now.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m more with, I don&rsquo;t know what you think about this.</p>
<p>I mean, Joe Rogan doesn&rsquo;t read comments</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t read comments much.</p>
<p>And the argument he made to me is that</p>
<p>he already has like a self critical person inside.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna have to think about</p>
<p>what you said in this conversation,</p>
<p>but I have this very harshly self critical person</p>
<p>inside as well where I don&rsquo;t need more fuel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need, no, I do sometimes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I check negativity occasionally,</p>
<p>not too often.</p>
<p>I sometimes need to like put a little bit more</p>
<p>like coals into the fire, but not too much.</p>
<p>But I already have that self critical engine</p>
<p>that keeps me in check.</p>
<p>I just, I wonder, you know, a lot of people</p>
<p>who gain more and more fame lose that ability</p>
<p>to be self critical.</p>
<p>I guess because they lose the audience</p>
<p>that can be critical towards them.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>You know, I do follow Joe&rsquo;s advice much more</p>
<p>than I ever have here.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t look at comments very often.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m probably using Twitter, you know,</p>
<p>5% as much as I used to.</p>
<p>I mean, I really just get in and out on Twitter</p>
<p>and spend very little time in my ad mentions.</p>
<p>I bet, you know, it does, in some ways it feels like a loss</p>
<p>because occasionally I get,</p>
<p>I see something super intelligent there.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I&rsquo;ll check my Twitter ad mentions</p>
<p>and someone will have said, oh, have you read this article?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, man, that was just,</p>
<p>that was like the best article sent to me in a month, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like to have not have looked</p>
<p>and to not have seen that, that&rsquo;s a loss.</p>
<p>So, but it does, at this point, a little goes a long way.</p>
<p>Cause I, yeah, it&rsquo;s not that it, for me now,</p>
<p>I mean, this could sound like a fairly Stalinistic immunity</p>
<p>to criticism, it&rsquo;s not so much that these voices of hate</p>
<p>turn on my inner hater, you know, more,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more that I just, I get a,</p>
<p>what I fear is a false sense of humanity.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like I&rsquo;m too online</p>
<p>and online is selecting for this performative outrage</p>
<p>in everybody, everyone&rsquo;s signaling to an audience</p>
<p>when they trash you.</p>
<p>And I get a dark, I&rsquo;m getting a, you know,</p>
<p>a misanthropic, you know, cut of just what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>And it, cause when you meet people in real life,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re great, you know, they&rsquo;re all rather often great,</p>
<p>you know, and it takes a lot to have anything</p>
<p>like a Twitter encounter in real life with a living person.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s much better to have that</p>
<p>as one&rsquo;s default sense of what it&rsquo;s like to be with people</p>
<p>than what one gets on social media</p>
<p>or on YouTube comment threads.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve produced a special episode with Rob Reed</p>
<p>on your podcast recently on how bioengineering of viruses</p>
<p>is going to destroy human civilization.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Or could.</p>
<p>Could.</p>
<p>One fears, yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry, the confidence there.</p>
<p>But in the 21st century, what do you think,</p>
<p>especially after having thought through that angle,</p>
<p>what do you think is the biggest threat</p>
<p>to the survival of the human species?</p>
<p>I can give you the full menu if you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, no, I would put the biggest threat</p>
<p>at another level out, kind of the meta threat</p>
<p>is our inability to agree about what the threats actually are</p>
<p>and to converge on strategies for responding to them, right?</p>
<p>So like I view COVID as, among other things,</p>
<p>a truly terrifyingly failed dress rehearsal</p>
<p>for something far worse, right?</p>
<p>I mean, COVID is just about as benign as it could have been</p>
<p>and still have been worse than the flu</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about a global pandemic, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s gonna kill a few million people</p>
<p>or it looks like it&rsquo;s killed about 3 million people.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll kill a few million more</p>
<p>unless something gets away from us</p>
<p>with a variant that&rsquo;s much worse</p>
<p>or we really don&rsquo;t play our cards right.</p>
<p>But I mean, the general shape of it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got somewhere around, well, 1% lethality</p>
<p>and whatever side of that number it really is on</p>
<p>in the end, it&rsquo;s not what would in fact be possible</p>
<p>and is in fact probably inevitable</p>
<p>something with orders of magnitude,</p>
<p>more lethality than that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so obvious we are totally unprepared, right?</p>
<p>We are running this epidemiological experiment</p>
<p>of linking the entire world together</p>
<p>and then also now per the podcast that Rob Reed did</p>
<p>democratizing the tech that will allow us to do this</p>
<p>to engineer pandemics, right?</p>
<p>And more and more people will be able</p>
<p>to engineer synthetic viruses that will be</p>
<p>by the sheer fact that they would have been engineered</p>
<p>with malicious intent, worse than COVID.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re still living in,</p>
<p>to speak specifically about the United States,</p>
<p>we have a country here where we can&rsquo;t even agree</p>
<p>that this is a thing, like that COVID,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s still people who think</p>
<p>that this is basically a hoax designed to control people.</p>
<p>And stranger still, there are people who will acknowledge</p>
<p>that COVID is real and they&rsquo;ll look,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t think the deaths have been faked or misascribed,</p>
<p>but they think that they&rsquo;re far happier</p>
<p>at the prospect of catching COVID</p>
<p>than they are of getting vaccinated for COVID, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not worried about COVID,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re worried about vaccines for COVID, right?</p>
<p>And the fact that we just can&rsquo;t converge in a conversation</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve now had a year to have with one another</p>
<p>on just what is the ground truth here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happened?</p>
<p>Why has it happened?</p>
<p>How safe is it to get COVID in every cohort</p>
<p>in the population?</p>
<p>And how safe are the vaccines?</p>
<p>And the fact that there&rsquo;s still an air of mystery</p>
<p>around all of this for much of our society</p>
<p>does not bode well when you&rsquo;re talking about solving</p>
<p>any other problem that may yet kill us.</p>
<p>But do you think convergence grows</p>
<p>with the magnitude of the threat?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, except I feel like we have tipped into,</p>
<p>because when the threat of COVID looked the most dire,</p>
<p>when we were seeing reports from Italy</p>
<p>that looked like the beginning of a zombie movie.</p>
<p>Because it could have been much, much worse.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is lethal, right?</p>
<p>Your ICUs are gonna fill up in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re 14 days behind us.</p>
<p>Your medical system is in danger of collapse.</p>
<p>Lock the fuck down.</p>
<p>We have people refusing to do anything sane</p>
<p>in the face of that.</p>
<p>People fundamentally thinking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna get here, right?</p>
<p>Who knows what&rsquo;s going on in Italy,</p>
<p>but it has no implications for what&rsquo;s gonna go on in New York</p>
<p>in a mere six days, right?</p>
<p>And now it kicks off in New York,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got people in the middle of the country</p>
<p>thinking it&rsquo;s no factor, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just big city, those are big city problems,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re faking it.</p>
<p>Or, I mean, it just, the layer of politics</p>
<p>has become so dysfunctional for us</p>
<p>that even in the presence of a pandemic</p>
<p>that looked legitimately scary there in the beginning,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not to say that it hasn&rsquo;t been devastating</p>
<p>for everyone who&rsquo;s been directly affected by it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not to say it can&rsquo;t get worse,</p>
<p>but here, for a very long time,</p>
<p>we have known that we were in a situation</p>
<p>that is more benign than what seemed</p>
<p>like the worst case scenario as it was kicking off,</p>
<p>especially in Italy.</p>
<p>And so still, yeah, it&rsquo;s quite possible</p>
<p>that if we saw the asteroid hurtling toward Earth</p>
<p>and everyone agreed that it&rsquo;s gonna make impact</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all gonna die,</p>
<p>then we could get off Twitter</p>
<p>and actually build the rockets</p>
<p>that are gonna divert the asteroid</p>
<p>from its Earth crossing path,</p>
<p>and we could do something pretty heroic.</p>
<p>But when you talk about anything else</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s slower moving than that,</p>
<p>I mean, something like climate change,</p>
<p>I think the prospect of our converging</p>
<p>on a solution to climate change</p>
<p>purely based on political persuasion</p>
<p>is nonexistent at this point.</p>
<p>I just think, to bring Elon back into this,</p>
<p>the way to deal with climate change</p>
<p>is to create technology that everyone wants</p>
<p>that is better than all the carbon producing technology,</p>
<p>and then we just transition</p>
<p>because you want an electric car</p>
<p>the same way you wanted a smartphone</p>
<p>or you want anything else,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re working totally with the grain</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s selfishness and short term thinking.</p>
<p>The idea that we&rsquo;re gonna convince</p>
<p>the better part of humanity</p>
<p>that climate change is an emergency,</p>
<p>that they have to make sacrifices to respond to,</p>
<p>given what&rsquo;s happened around COVID,</p>
<p>I just think that&rsquo;s the fantasy of a fantasy.</p>
<p>But speaking of Elon,</p>
<p>I have a bunch of positive things</p>
<p>that I wanna say here in response to you,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re opening so many threads,</p>
<p>but let me pull one of them, which is AI.</p>
<p>Both you and Elon think that with AI,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re summoning demons, summoning a demon,</p>
<p>maybe not in those poetic terms, but.</p>
<p>Well, potentially. Potentially.</p>
<p>Two very, three very parsimonious assumptions,</p>
<p>I think, here.</p>
<p>Scientifically, parsimonious assumptions get me there.</p>
<p>Any of which could be wrong,</p>
<p>but it just seems like the weight</p>
<p>of the evidence is on their side.</p>
<p>One is that it comes back to this topic</p>
<p>of substrate independence, right?</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s in the business</p>
<p>of producing intelligent machines</p>
<p>must believe, ultimately,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing magical</p>
<p>about having a computer made of meat.</p>
<p>You can do this in the kinds of materials</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using now,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no special something</p>
<p>that presents a real impediment</p>
<p>to producing human level intelligence in silico, right?</p>
<p>Again, an assumption, I&rsquo;m sure there are a few people</p>
<p>who still think there is something magical</p>
<p>about biological systems,</p>
<p>but leave that aside.</p>
<p>Given that assumption,</p>
<p>and given the assumption</p>
<p>that we just continue making incremental progress,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be Moore&rsquo;s Law,</p>
<p>it just has to be progress,</p>
<p>that just doesn&rsquo;t stop,</p>
<p>at a certain point,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get to human level intelligence and beyond.</p>
<p>And human level intelligence,</p>
<p>I think, is also clearly a mirage,</p>
<p>because anything that&rsquo;s human level</p>
<p>is gonna be superhuman</p>
<p>by unless we decide to dumb it down, right?</p>
<p>I mean, my phone is already superhuman as a calculator,</p>
<p>right, so why would we make the human level AI</p>
<p>just as good as me as a calculator?</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ll very,</p>
<p>if we continue to make progress,</p>
<p>we will be in the presence of superhuman competence</p>
<p>for any act of intelligence or cognition</p>
<p>that we care to prioritize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to say that we&rsquo;ll create everything</p>
<p>that a human could do,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll leave certain things out,</p>
<p>but anything that we care about,</p>
<p>and we care about a lot,</p>
<p>and we certainly care about anything</p>
<p>that produces a lot of power,</p>
<p>that we care about scientific insights</p>
<p>and an ability to produce new technology and all of that,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have something that&rsquo;s superhuman.</p>
<p>And then the final assumption is just that</p>
<p>there have to be ways to do that</p>
<p>that are not aligned with a happy coexistence</p>
<p>with these now more powerful entities than ourselves.</p>
<p>So, and I would guess,</p>
<p>and this is kind of a rider to that assumption,</p>
<p>there are probably more ways to do it badly</p>
<p>than to do it perfectly.</p>
<p>That is perfectly aligned with our wellbeing.</p>
<p>And when you think about the consequences of nonalignment,</p>
<p>when you think about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now in the presence of something</p>
<p>that is more intelligent than you are, right?</p>
<p>Which is to say more competent, right?</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve, and obviously there are cartoon pictures</p>
<p>of this where we could just,</p>
<p>this is just an off switch,</p>
<p>we could just turn off the off switch,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re tethered to something that makes them,</p>
<p>our slaves in perpetuity,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re more intelligent.</p>
<p>But those scenarios strike me as a failure to imagine</p>
<p>what is actually entailed by greater intelligence, right?</p>
<p>So if you imagine something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s legitimately more intelligent than you are,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re now in relationship to it, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the presence of this thing</p>
<p>and it is autonomous in all kinds of ways</p>
<p>because it had to be to be more intelligent than you are.</p>
<p>I mean, you built it to be all of those things.</p>
<p>We just can&rsquo;t find ourselves in a negotiation</p>
<p>with something more intelligent than we are, you know?</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t, so we have to have found</p>
<p>the subset of ways to build these machines</p>
<p>that are perpetually amenable to our saying,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s not what we meant, that&rsquo;s not what we intended.</p>
<p>Could you stop doing that, just come back over here</p>
<p>and do this thing that we actually want.</p>
<p>And for them to care, for them to be tethered</p>
<p>to our own sense of our own wellbeing,</p>
<p>such that, you know, I mean, their utility function is,</p>
<p>you know, their primary utility function is for,</p>
<p>is to have, you know, this is, I think,</p>
<p>Stuart Russell&rsquo;s cartoon plan is to figure out</p>
<p>how to tether them to a utility function</p>
<p>that has our own estimation of what&rsquo;s going to improve</p>
<p>our wellbeing as its master, you know, reward, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, all that, this thing can get</p>
<p>as intelligent as it can get,</p>
<p>but it only ever really wants to figure out</p>
<p>how to make our lives better by our own view of better.</p>
<p>Now, not to say there wouldn&rsquo;t be a conversation about,</p>
<p>you know, I mean, because there&rsquo;s all kinds of things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not seeing clearly about what is better,</p>
<p>and if we were in the presence of a genie or an oracle</p>
<p>that could really tell us what is better,</p>
<p>well, then we presumably would want to hear that,</p>
<p>and we would modify our sense of what to do next</p>
<p>in conversation with these minds.</p>
<p>But I just feel like it is a failure of imagination</p>
<p>to think that being in relationship to something</p>
<p>more intelligent than yourself isn&rsquo;t in most cases</p>
<p>a circumstance of real peril, because it is.</p>
<p>Just to think of how everything on Earth has to,</p>
<p>if they could think about their relationship to us,</p>
<p>if birds could think about what we&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>They would, I mean, the bottom line is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always in danger of our discovering</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something we care about more than birds, right?</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s something we want</p>
<p>that disregards the wellbeing of birds.</p>
<p>And obviously much of our behavior is inscrutable to them.</p>
<p>Occasionally we pay attention to them,</p>
<p>and occasionally we withdraw our attention,</p>
<p>and occasionally we just kill them all</p>
<p>for reasons they can&rsquo;t possibly understand.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re building something more intelligent</p>
<p>than ourselves, by definition,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re building something whose horizons</p>
<p>of value and cognition can exceed our own</p>
<p>and in ways where we can&rsquo;t necessarily foresee,</p>
<p>again, perpetually, that they don&rsquo;t just wake up one day</p>
<p>and decide, okay, well, these humans need to disappear.</p>
<p>So I think I agree with most of the initial things you said.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with,</p>
<p>and of course nobody knows,</p>
<p>but that the more likely set of trajectories</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to take are going to be positive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I believe in the sense</p>
<p>that the way you develop,</p>
<p>I believe the way you develop successful AI systems</p>
<p>will be deeply integrated with human society.</p>
<p>And for them to succeed,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have to be aligned</p>
<p>in the way we humans are aligned with each other,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re aligned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t see there&rsquo;s such thing as a perfect alignment,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re going to be participating in the dance,</p>
<p>in the game theoretic dance of human society,</p>
<p>as they become more and more intelligent.</p>
<p>There could be a point beyond which</p>
<p>we are like birds to them.</p>
<p>But what about an intelligence explosion of some kind?</p>
<p>So I believe the explosion will be happening,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of explosion to be done</p>
<p>before we become like birds.</p>
<p>I truly believe that human beings</p>
<p>are very intelligent in ways we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about chess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about all the intricate computation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to perform, common sense,</p>
<p>our ability to reason about this world, consciousness.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re doing a lot of work</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t realize is necessary to be done</p>
<p>in order to truly become,</p>
<p>like truly achieve super intelligence.</p>
<p>And I just think there&rsquo;ll be a period of time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not overnight.</p>
<p>The overnight nature of it will not literally be overnight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be over a period of decades.</p>
<p>So my sense is&hellip;</p>
<p>So why would it be that, but just take,</p>
<p>draw an analogy from recent successes,</p>
<p>like something like AlphaGo or AlphaZero.</p>
<p>I forget the actual metric,</p>
<p>but it was something like this algorithm,</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t even totally,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t bespoke for chess playing,</p>
<p>in the matter of, I think it was four hours,</p>
<p>played itself so many times and so successfully</p>
<p>that it became the best chess playing computer.</p>
<p>It was not only better than every human being,</p>
<p>it was better than every previous chess program</p>
<p>in a matter of a day, right?</p>
<p>So just imagine, again,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to recapitulate everything about us,</p>
<p>but just imagine building a system,</p>
<p>and who knows when we&rsquo;ll be able to do this,</p>
<p>but at some point we&rsquo;ll be able,</p>
<p>at some point the 100 or 100 favorite things</p>
<p>about human cognition will be analogous to chess</p>
<p>in that we will be able to build machines</p>
<p>that very quickly outperform any human,</p>
<p>and then very quickly outperform the last algorithm</p>
<p>that outperform the humans.</p>
<p>Like something like the AlphaGo experience</p>
<p>seems possible for facial recognition</p>
<p>and detecting human emotion</p>
<p>and natural language processing, right?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just that everyone,</p>
<p>even math people, math heads,</p>
<p>tend to have bad intuitions for exponentiation, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we noticed this during COVID.</p>
<p>I mean, you have some very smart people</p>
<p>who still couldn&rsquo;t get their minds around the fact</p>
<p>that an exponential is really surprising.</p>
<p>I mean, things double and double and double and double again,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t notice much of anything changes,</p>
<p>and then the last two stages of doubling swamp everything.</p>
<p>And it just seems like that,</p>
<p>to assume that there isn&rsquo;t a deep analogy</p>
<p>between what we&rsquo;re seeing for the more tractable problems,</p>
<p>like chess, to other modes of cognition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like once you crack that problem,</p>
<p>it seems, because for the longest time,</p>
<p>it was impossible to think</p>
<p>we were gonna make headway in AI, you know, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Chess and Go was seen as impossible.</p>
<p>Yeah, Go seemed unattainable.</p>
<p>Even when chess had been cracked, Go seemed unattainable.</p>
<p>Yeah, and actually still Russell was behind the people</p>
<p>that were saying it&rsquo;s unattainable,</p>
<p>because it seemed like it&rsquo;s intractable problem.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something different</p>
<p>about the space of cognition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s detached from human society, which is what chess is,</p>
<p>meaning like just thinking,</p>
<p>having actual exponential impact</p>
<p>on the physical world is different.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>for AI to get to the point where it&rsquo;s super intelligent,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to have to go through the funnel of society.</p>
<p>And for that, it has to be deeply integrated</p>
<p>with human beings, and for that, it has to be aligned.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re talking about like actually hooking us up</p>
<p>to like the neural link, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna be the brainstem to the robot overlords?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a possibility as well.</p>
<p>But what I mean is,</p>
<p>in order to develop autonomous weapon systems, for example,</p>
<p>which are highly concerning to me</p>
<p>that both US and China are participating in now,</p>
<p>that in order to develop them and for them to become,</p>
<p>to have more and more responsibility</p>
<p>to actually do military strategic actions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have to be integrated</p>
<p>into human beings doing the strategic action.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to have to work alongside with each other.</p>
<p>And the way those systems will be developed</p>
<p>will have the natural safety, like switches</p>
<p>that are placed on them as they develop over time,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re going to have to convince humans.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they&rsquo;re going to have to convince humans</p>
<p>that this is safer than humans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to, you know.</p>
<p>Self driving cars is a good test case here</p>
<p>because like, obviously we&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress</p>
<p>and we can imagine what total progress would look like.</p>
<p>I mean, it would be amazing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s answering, it&rsquo;s canceling in the US</p>
<p>40,000 deaths every year based on ape driven cars, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a excruciating problem that we&rsquo;ve all gotten used to</p>
<p>because there was no alternative.</p>
<p>But now we can dimly see the prospect of an alternative,</p>
<p>which if it works in a super intelligent fashion,</p>
<p>maybe we would go down to zero highway deaths, right?</p>
<p>Or, you know, certainly we&rsquo;d go down</p>
<p>by orders of magnitude, right?</p>
<p>So maybe we have, you know, 400 rather than 40,000 a year.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to see that there&rsquo;s not a missile.</p>
<p>So obviously this is not an example of super intelligence.</p>
<p>This is narrow intelligence,</p>
<p>but the alignment problem isn&rsquo;t so obvious there,</p>
<p>but there are potential alignment problems there.</p>
<p>Like, so like, just imagine if some woke team of engineers</p>
<p>decided that we have to tune the algorithm some way.</p>
<p>I mean, there are situations where the car</p>
<p>has to decide who to hit.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just bad outcomes</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna hit somebody, right?</p>
<p>Now we have a car that can tell what race you are, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna build the car to preferentially hit</p>
<p>white people because white people have had so much privilege</p>
<p>over the years.</p>
<p>This seems like the only ethical way</p>
<p>to kind of redress those wrongs of the past.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that could get, one,</p>
<p>that could get produced as an artifact, presumably,</p>
<p>of just how you built it</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t even know you engineered it that way, right?</p>
<p>You caused it to&hellip;</p>
<p>Through machine learning,</p>
<p>you put some kind of constraints on it</p>
<p>to where it creates those kinds of outcomes.</p>
<p>Basically, you built a racist algorithm</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t even intend to,</p>
<p>or you could intend to, right?</p>
<p>And it would be aligned with some people&rsquo;s values</p>
<p>but misaligned with other people&rsquo;s values.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like there are interesting problems</p>
<p>even with something as simple</p>
<p>and obviously good as self driving cars.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a leap that I just think it&rsquo;d be exact,</p>
<p>but those are human problems.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be a leap</p>
<p>with autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>First of all, sorry.</p>
<p>There are a lot of trajectories</p>
<p>which will destroy human civilization.</p>
<p>The argument I&rsquo;m making,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more likely that we&rsquo;ll take trajectories that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be a leap</p>
<p>with autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>will all of a sudden start murdering pedestrians</p>
<p>because once every human on earth is dead,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be no more fatalities,</p>
<p>sort of unintended consequences of&hellip;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s difficult to take that leap.</p>
<p>Most systems as we develop</p>
<p>and they become much, much more intelligent</p>
<p>in ways that will be incredibly surprising,</p>
<p>like stuff that DeepMind is doing with protein folding.</p>
<p>Even, which is scary to think about,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m personally terrified about this,</p>
<p>which is the engineering of viruses using machine learning,</p>
<p>the engineering of vaccines using machine learning,</p>
<p>the engineering of, yeah, for research purposes,</p>
<p>pathogens using machine learning</p>
<p>and the ways that can go wrong.</p>
<p>I just think that there&rsquo;s always going to be</p>
<p>a closed loop supervision of humans</p>
<p>before the AI becomes super intelligent.</p>
<p>Not always, much more likely to be supervision,</p>
<p>except, of course, the question is</p>
<p>how many dumb people there are in the world,</p>
<p>how many evil people are in the world?</p>
<p>My theory, my hope is, my sense is</p>
<p>that the number of intelligent people</p>
<p>is much higher than the number of dumb people</p>
<p>that know how to program</p>
<p>and the number of evil people.</p>
<p>I think smart people and kind people</p>
<p>over outnumber the others.</p>
<p>Except we also have to add another group of people</p>
<p>which are just the smart and otherwise good</p>
<p>but reckless people, right?</p>
<p>The people who will flip a switch on</p>
<p>not knowing what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just kind of hoping</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not going to blow up the world.</p>
<p>We already know that some of our smartest people</p>
<p>are those sorts of people.</p>
<p>We know we&rsquo;ve done experiments,</p>
<p>and this is something that Martin Rees was whinging about</p>
<p>before the Large Hadron Collider</p>
<p>got booted up, I think.</p>
<p>We know there are people who are entertaining experiments</p>
<p>or even performing experiments</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s some chance, not quite infinitesimal,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to create a black hole in the lab</p>
<p>and suck the whole world into it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a crazy person to worry about that</p>
<p>based on the physics.</p>
<p>And so it was with the Trinity test.</p>
<p>There were some people who were still</p>
<p>checking their calculations, and they were off.</p>
<p>We did nuclear tests where we were off significantly</p>
<p>in terms of the yield, right?</p>
<p>So it was like.</p>
<p>And they still flipped the switch.</p>
<p>Yeah, they still flipped the switch.</p>
<p>And sometimes they flipped the switch</p>
<p>not to win a world war or to save 40,000 lives a year.</p>
<p>They just, just.</p>
<p>Just to see what happens.</p>
<p>Intellectual curiosity.</p>
<p>Like this is what I got my grant for.</p>
<p>This is where I&rsquo;ll get my Nobel Prize</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s in the cards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the other side of this switch, right?</p>
<p>And I mean, again, we are apes with egos</p>
<p>who are massively constrained</p>
<p>by very short term self interest</p>
<p>even when we&rsquo;re contemplating some of the deepest</p>
<p>and most interesting and most universal problems</p>
<p>we could ever set our attention towards.</p>
<p>Like just if you read James Watson&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>The Double Helix, right?</p>
<p>About them cracking the structure of DNA.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s amazing about that book</p>
<p>is just how much of it, almost all of it</p>
<p>is being driven by very apish, egocentric social concerns.</p>
<p>The algorithm that is producing this scientific breakthrough</p>
<p>is human competition if you&rsquo;re James Watson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m gonna get there before Linus Pauling</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s so much of his bandwidth</p>
<p>is captured by that, right?</p>
<p>Now that becomes more and more of a liability</p>
<p>when you think about it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m gonna get there before Linus Pauling</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s so much of his bandwidth</p>
<p>is captured by that, right?</p>
<p>Now that becomes more and more of a liability</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about producing technology</p>
<p>that can change everything in an instant.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re talking about not only understanding,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re just at a different moment</p>
<p>in human history.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not, when we&rsquo;re doing research on viruses,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now doing the kind of research</p>
<p>that can cause someone somewhere else</p>
<p>to be able to make that virus or weaponize that virus</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, our power is, our wisdom is,</p>
<p>it does not seem like our wisdom is scaling with our power.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And like that seems like, insofar as wisdom and power</p>
<p>become unaligned, I get more and more concerned.</p>
<p>But speaking of apes with egos,</p>
<p>some of the most compelling apes, two compelling apes,</p>
<p>I can think of is yourself and Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve had a fun conversation about religion</p>
<p>that I watched most of, I believe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there was any&hellip;</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t solve anything.</p>
<p>If anything was ever solved.</p>
<p>So is there something like a charitable summary</p>
<p>you can give to the ideas that you agree on</p>
<p>and disagree with Jordan?</p>
<p>Is there something maybe after that conversation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve landed where maybe as you both agreed on,</p>
<p>is there some wisdom in the rubble</p>
<p>of even imperfect flawed ideas?</p>
<p>Is there something that you can kind of pull out</p>
<p>from those conversations or is it to be continued?</p>
<p>I mean, I think where we disagree.</p>
<p>So he thinks that many of our traditional religious beliefs</p>
<p>and frameworks are holding such a repository</p>
<p>of human wisdom that we pull at that fabric</p>
<p>at our peril, right?</p>
<p>Like if you start just unraveling Christianity</p>
<p>or any other traditional set of norms and beliefs</p>
<p>you may think you&rsquo;re just pulling out the unscientific bits</p>
<p>but you could be pulling a lot more</p>
<p>to which everything you care about is attached, right?</p>
<p>As a society.</p>
<p>And my feeling is that there&rsquo;s so much downside</p>
<p>to the unscientific bits.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so clear how we could have a 21st century</p>
<p>rational conversation about the things that we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>A conversation about the good stuff</p>
<p>that we really can radically edit these traditions.</p>
<p>And we can take Jesus in half his moods</p>
<p>and just find a great inspirational iron age thought leader</p>
<p>who just happened to get crucified.</p>
<p>But he could be somewhat like the Beatitudes</p>
<p>and the golden rule, which doesn&rsquo;t originate with him</p>
<p>but which he put quite beautifully.</p>
<p>All of that&rsquo;s incredibly useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no less useful than it was 2000 years ago.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have to believe he was born of a virgin</p>
<p>or coming back to raise the dead</p>
<p>or any of that other stuff.</p>
<p>And we can be honest about not believing those things.</p>
<p>And we can be honest about the reasons</p>
<p>why we don&rsquo;t believe those things.</p>
<p>Because on those fronts I view the downside to be so obvious</p>
<p>and the fact that we have so many different</p>
<p>competing dogmatisms on offer to be so nonfunctional.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so divisive, it just has conflict built into it</p>
<p>that I think we can be far more</p>
<p>and should be far more iconoclastic</p>
<p>than he wants to be, right?</p>
<p>Now, none of this is to deny much of what he argues for,</p>
<p>that stories are very powerful.</p>
<p>I mean, clearly stories are powerful</p>
<p>and we want good stories.</p>
<p>We want our lives, we wanna have a conversation</p>
<p>with ourselves and with one another about our lives</p>
<p>that facilitates the best possible lives.</p>
<p>And story is part of that, right?</p>
<p>And if you want some of those stories to sound like myths,</p>
<p>that might be part of it, right?</p>
<p>But my argument is that we never really need</p>
<p>to deceive ourselves or our children</p>
<p>about what we have every reason to believe is true</p>
<p>in order to get at the good stuff,</p>
<p>in order to organize our lives well.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t feel that I need to do it personally.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t need to do it personally,</p>
<p>why would I think that billions of other people</p>
<p>need to do it personally, right?</p>
<p>Now, there is a cynical counter argument,</p>
<p>which is billions of other people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the advantages that I have had in my life.</p>
<p>The billions of other people are not as well educated,</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t had the same opportunities,</p>
<p>they need to be told that Jesus is gonna solve</p>
<p>all their problems after they die, say,</p>
<p>or that everything happens for a reason</p>
<p>and if you just believe in the secret,</p>
<p>if you just visualize what you want, you&rsquo;re gonna get it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s some measure</p>
<p>of what I consider to be odious pamphlet</p>
<p>that really is food for the better part of humanity</p>
<p>and there is no substitute for it</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s no substitute now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if Jordan would agree with that,</p>
<p>but much of what he says seems to suggest</p>
<p>that he would agree with it.</p>
<p>And I guess that&rsquo;s an empirical question.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>whether given a different set of norms</p>
<p>and a different set of stories,</p>
<p>people would behave the way I would hope they would behave</p>
<p>and be more aligned than they are now.</p>
<p>I think we know what happens</p>
<p>when you just let ancient religious certainties</p>
<p>go uncriticized.</p>
<p>We know what that world&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been struggling to get out of that world</p>
<p>for a couple of hundred years,</p>
<p>but we know what having Europe riven by religious wars</p>
<p>looks like.</p>
<p>And we know what happens when those religions</p>
<p>become kind of pseudo religions and political religions.</p>
<p>So this is where I&rsquo;m sure Jordan and I would debate.</p>
<p>He would say that Stalin was a symptom of atheism</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not at all.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not my kind of atheism.</p>
<p>Stalin, the problem with the Gulag</p>
<p>and the experiment with communism or with Stalinism</p>
<p>or with Nazism was not that there was so much</p>
<p>scientific rigor and self criticism and honesty</p>
<p>and introspection and judicious use of psychedelics.</p>
<p>I mean, that was not the problem in Hitler&rsquo;s Germany</p>
<p>or in Stalin&rsquo;s Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The problem was you have other ideas</p>
<p>that capture a similar kind of mob based dogmatic energy.</p>
<p>And yes, the results of all of that</p>
<p>are predictably murderous.</p>
<p>Well, the question is what is the source</p>
<p>of the most viral and sticky stories</p>
<p>that ultimately lead to a positive outcome?</p>
<p>So communism was, I mean, having grown up</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union, even still having relatives in Russia,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a stickiness to the nationalism</p>
<p>and to the ideologies of communism</p>
<p>that religious or not, you could say it&rsquo;s religious forever.</p>
<p>I could just say it&rsquo;s stories that are viral and sticky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the most horrible words,</p>
<p>but the question is whether science and reason</p>
<p>can generate viral sticky stories</p>
<p>that give meaning to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>And your sense is it does.</p>
<p>Well, whatever is true ultimately should be captivating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what&rsquo;s more captivating than whatever is real?</p>
<p>Because reality is, again, we&rsquo;re just climbing</p>
<p>out of the darkness in terms of our understanding</p>
<p>of what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no telling what spooky things</p>
<p>may in fact be true.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve been on the receiving end</p>
<p>of recent rumors about our conversation</p>
<p>about UFOs very likely changing in the near term, right?</p>
<p>But like there was just a Washington Post article</p>
<p>and a New Yorker article,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve received some private outreach</p>
<p>and perhaps you have, I know other people in our orbit</p>
<p>have people who are claiming</p>
<p>that the government has known much more about UFOs</p>
<p>than they have let on until now.</p>
<p>And this conversation is actually is about</p>
<p>to become more prominent,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna be whatever,</p>
<p>whoever&rsquo;s left standing when the music stops,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be a comfortable position to be in</p>
<p>as a super rigorous scientific skeptic</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been saying there&rsquo;s no there there</p>
<p>for the last 75 years, right?</p>
<p>The short version is it sounds like</p>
<p>the Office of Naval Intelligence and the Pentagon</p>
<p>are very likely to say to Congress at some point</p>
<p>in the not too distant future that we have evidence</p>
<p>that there is technology flying around here</p>
<p>that seems like it can&rsquo;t possibly be of human origin, right?</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>with that kind of disclosure, right?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s gonna be nothing,</p>
<p>no follow on conversation to really have,</p>
<p>but that is such a powerfully strange circumstance</p>
<p>to be in, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, what are we gonna do with that?</p>
<p>If in fact, that&rsquo;s what happens, right?</p>
<p>If in fact, the considered opinion,</p>
<p>despite the embarrassment it causes them</p>
<p>of the US government, of all of our intelligence,</p>
<p>all of the relevant intelligence services</p>
<p>is that this isn&rsquo;t a hoax.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much data to suggest that it&rsquo;s a hoax.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got too much radar imagery,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much satellite data,</p>
<p>whatever data they actually have, there&rsquo;s too much of it.</p>
<p>All we can say now is something&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way it&rsquo;s the Chinese or the Russians</p>
<p>or anyone else&rsquo;s technology.</p>
<p>That should arrest our attention collectively</p>
<p>to a degree that nothing in our lifetime has.</p>
<p>And now one worries that we&rsquo;re so jaded</p>
<p>and confused and distracted</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna get much less coverage</p>
<p>than Obama&rsquo;s tan suit did a bunch of years ago.</p>
<p>Who knows how we&rsquo;ll respond to that?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just to say that the need for us</p>
<p>to tell ourselves an honest story about what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s likely to happen next</p>
<p>is never gonna go away, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important, it&rsquo;s just the division between me</p>
<p>and every person who&rsquo;s defending traditional religion</p>
<p>is where is it that you wanna lie to yourself</p>
<p>or lie to your kids?</p>
<p>Like where is honesty a liability?</p>
<p>And for me, I&rsquo;ve yet to find the place where it is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so obviously a strength</p>
<p>in almost every other circumstance</p>
<p>because it is the thing that allows you to course correct.</p>
<p>It is the thing that allows you to hope at least</p>
<p>that your beliefs, that your stories</p>
<p>are in some kind of calibration</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s actually going on in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a little bit sad to imagine</p>
<p>that if aliens on mass showed up to Earth,</p>
<p>they would be too preoccupied with political bickering</p>
<p>or to like these like fake news</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff to notice</p>
<p>the very basic evidence of reality.</p>
<p>I do have a glimmer of hope</p>
<p>that there seems to be more and more hunger for authenticity.</p>
<p>And I feel like that opens the door</p>
<p>for a hunger for what is real.</p>
<p>Like people don&rsquo;t want stories.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want like layers and layers of like fakeness.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m hoping that means that will directly lead</p>
<p>to a greater hunger for reality and reason and truth.</p>
<p>Truth isn&rsquo;t dogmatism.</p>
<p>Like truth isn&rsquo;t authority.</p>
<p>I have a PhD and therefore I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>Truth is almost, like the reality is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many questions, there&rsquo;s so many mysteries,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much uncertainty.</p>
<p>This is our best available, like a best guess.</p>
<p>And we have a lot of evidence that supports that guess,</p>
<p>but it could be so many other things.</p>
<p>And like just even conveying that,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a hunger for that in the world</p>
<p>to hear that from scientists, less dogmatism</p>
<p>and more just like this is what we know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing our best given the uncertainty, given,</p>
<p>I mean, this is true with obviously with the virology</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>because everything is happening so fast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of, and biology is super messy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to know stuff for sure.</p>
<p>So just being open and real about that,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m hoping will change people&rsquo;s hunger</p>
<p>and openness and trust of what&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so much of this is probabilistic.</p>
<p>I mean, so much of what can seem dogmatic scientifically</p>
<p>is just you&rsquo;re placing a bet on whether it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>reading that paper or rethinking your presuppositions</p>
<p>on that point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not a fundamental closure to data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that there&rsquo;s so much data on one side</p>
<p>or so much would have to change</p>
<p>in terms of your understanding of what you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll understand about the nature of the world</p>
<p>if this new fact were so that you can pretty quickly say,</p>
<p>all right, that&rsquo;s probably bullshit, right?</p>
<p>And it can sound like a fundamental closure</p>
<p>to new conversations, new evidence, new data, new argument,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it really is just triaging your attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, okay, you&rsquo;re telling me</p>
<p>that your best friend can actually read minds.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Let me know when that person has gone into a lab</p>
<p>and actually proven it, right?</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t need, like, this is not the place</p>
<p>where I need to spend the rest of my day</p>
<p>figuring out if your buddy can read my mind, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a way to communicate that.</p>
<p>I think it does too often sound</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re completely closed off to ideas</p>
<p>as opposed to saying like, this is, you know,</p>
<p>as opposed to saying that there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence</p>
<p>in support of this, but you&rsquo;re still open minded</p>
<p>to other ideas.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a way to communicate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily even with words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s even that Joe Rogan energy</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>Just, it&rsquo;s that energy of being open minded</p>
<p>and curious like kids are.</p>
<p>Like, this is our best understanding,</p>
<p>but you still are curious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying allocate time to exploring all those things,</p>
<p>but still leaving the door open.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a way to communicate that, I think,</p>
<p>that people really hunger for.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been recently talking a lot with John Donahoe</p>
<p>from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fame.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who that is.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m talking about somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s good at what he does.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he, speaking of somebody who&rsquo;s open minded,</p>
<p>the reason he&rsquo;s doing this ridiculous transition</p>
<p>is for the longest time, and even still,</p>
<p>a lot of people believed in the Jiu Jitsu world</p>
<p>and grappling world that leg locks</p>
<p>are not effective in Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>And he was somebody that inspired</p>
<p>by the open mindedness of Dean Lister,</p>
<p>famously to him said, why do you only consider</p>
<p>half the human body when you&rsquo;re trying to do the submissions?</p>
<p>He developed an entire system</p>
<p>on this other half the human body.</p>
<p>Anyway, I do that absurd transition to ask you,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re also a student of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say</p>
<p>how that has affected your life,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve learned from grappling from the martial arts?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s actually a great transition</p>
<p>because I think one of the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so beautiful about Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>is that it does what we wish we could do</p>
<p>in every other area of life</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re talking about this difference</p>
<p>between knowledge and ignorance, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no room for bullshit, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get any credit for bullshit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the difference,</p>
<p>the amazing thing about Jiu Jitsu is that</p>
<p>the difference between knowing what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and what to do and not knowing it</p>
<p>is as the gulf between those two states</p>
<p>is as wide as it is in any thing in human life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s spanned, it can be spanned so quickly.</p>
<p>Like each increment of knowledge</p>
<p>can be doled out in five minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, here&rsquo;s the thing that got you killed</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how to prevent it from happening to you</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how to do it to others.</p>
<p>And you just get this amazing cadence</p>
<p>of discovering your fatal ignorance</p>
<p>and then having it remedied with the actual technique.</p>
<p>And I mean, just for people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like this, the simple circumstance</p>
<p>of like someone&rsquo;s got you in a headlock,</p>
<p>how do you get out of that, right?</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s sitting on your chest</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in the mount position</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on the bottom and you wanna get away,</p>
<p>how do you get them off you?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sitting on you.</p>
<p>Your intuitions about how to do this are terrible</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;ve done some other martial art, right?</p>
<p>And once you learn how to do it,</p>
<p>the difference is night and day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have access to a completely different physics.</p>
<p>But I think our understanding of the world</p>
<p>can be much more like jujitsu than it tends to be, right?</p>
<p>And I think we should all have a much better sense</p>
<p>of when we should tap out</p>
<p>and when we should recognize that our epistemological arm</p>
<p>is barred and now it&rsquo;s being broken, right?</p>
<p>And the problem with debating most other topics</p>
<p>is that most people, it isn&rsquo;t jujitsu</p>
<p>and most people don&rsquo;t tap out, right?</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s obvious to you they&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s obvious to an intelligent audience</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re wrong, people just double down</p>
<p>and double down and they&rsquo;re either lying</p>
<p>or lying to themselves</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re bluffing and so you have a lot of zombies</p>
<p>walking around and zombie worldviews walking around</p>
<p>which have been disconfirmed as emphatically</p>
<p>as someone gets armbarred, right?</p>
<p>Or someone gets choked out in jujitsu</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s not jujitsu,</p>
<p>they can live to fight another day, right?</p>
<p>Or they can pretend that they didn&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>that particular argument.</p>
<p>And science when it works is a lot like jujitsu.</p>
<p>I mean, science when you falsify a thesis, right?</p>
<p>When you think DNA is one way</p>
<p>and it proves to be another way,</p>
<p>when you think it&rsquo;s triple stranded or whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there is a there there</p>
<p>and you can get to a real consensus.</p>
<p>So jujitsu for me, it was more than just</p>
<p>of interest for self defense and the sport of it.</p>
<p>It was just, there was something, it&rsquo;s a language</p>
<p>and an argument you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t fool yourself anymore.</p>
<p>First of all, it cancels any role of luck</p>
<p>in a way that most other athletic feats don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in basketball,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not good at basketball,</p>
<p>you can take the basketball in your hand,</p>
<p>you can be 75 feet away and hurl it at the basket</p>
<p>and you might make it.</p>
<p>And you could convince yourself based on that demonstration</p>
<p>that you have some kind of talent for basketball, right?</p>
<p>Enough, 10 minutes on the mat</p>
<p>with a real jujitsu practitioner when you&rsquo;re not one</p>
<p>proves to you that you just, there is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, there&rsquo;s no lucky punch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, you&rsquo;re not gonna get a lucky,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no lucky rear naked choke you&rsquo;re gonna perform</p>
<p>on someone who&rsquo;s Marcelo Garcia or somebody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>And having that aspect of the usual range of uncertainty</p>
<p>and self deception and bullshit just stripped away</p>
<p>was really a kind of revelation.</p>
<p>It was just an amazing experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a really powerful thing</p>
<p>that accompanies whatever other pursuit you have in life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s anything like jujitsu</p>
<p>where you could just systematically go into a place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re, that&rsquo;s honest,</p>
<p>where your beliefs get challenged</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s conclusive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t found too many other mechanism,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s a, we had this earlier question</p>
<p>about fame and ego and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much rely on jujitsu in my own life</p>
<p>as a place where I can always go to have my ego in check.</p>
<p>And that has effects on how I live</p>
<p>every other aspect of my life.</p>
<p>Actually, even just doing any kind of,</p>
<p>for me personally, physical challenges,</p>
<p>like even running, doing something that&rsquo;s way too hard</p>
<p>for me and then pushing through, that&rsquo;s somehow humbling.</p>
<p>Some people talk about nature being humbling</p>
<p>in that kind of sense, where you kind of see something</p>
<p>really powerful, like the ocean.</p>
<p>Like if you go surfing and you realize</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something much more powerful than you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also honest, that there&rsquo;s no way to,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just like the speck,</p>
<p>that kind of puts you in the right scale</p>
<p>of where you are in this world.</p>
<p>And jujitsu does that better than anything else for me.</p>
<p>But we should say it&rsquo;s only within its frame</p>
<p>is it truly the final right answer</p>
<p>to all the problems it solves.</p>
<p>Because if you just put jujitsu into an MMA frame</p>
<p>or a total self defense frame,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a lot of unpleasant surprises</p>
<p>to discover there, right?</p>
<p>Like somebody who thinks all you need is jujitsu</p>
<p>to win the UFC gets punched in the face a lot.</p>
<p>Even from, even on the ground.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, and then you bring weapons in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when you talk to jujitsu people</p>
<p>about knife defense and self defense, right?</p>
<p>Like that opens the door to certain kinds of delusions.</p>
<p>But the analogy to martial arts is fascinating</p>
<p>because on the other side, we have endless testimony now</p>
<p>of fake martial arts that don&rsquo;t seem to know they&rsquo;re fake</p>
<p>and are as delusional, I mean, they&rsquo;re impossibly delusional.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s great video of Joe Rogan</p>
<p>watching some of these videos</p>
<p>because people send them to him all the time.</p>
<p>But like literally there are people,</p>
<p>there are people who clearly believe in magic</p>
<p>where the master isn&rsquo;t even touching the students</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re flopping over.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of shared delusion</p>
<p>which you would think maybe is just a performance</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all a kind of elaborate fraud.</p>
<p>But there are cases where the people,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s one fairly famous case</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a connoisseur of this madness</p>
<p>where this old older martial artist</p>
<p>who you saw flipping his students endlessly by magic</p>
<p>without touching them issued a challenge</p>
<p>to the wide world of martial artists.</p>
<p>And someone showed up and just punched him in the face</p>
<p>until it was over.</p>
<p>Clearly he believed his own publicity at some point, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this amazing metaphor.</p>
<p>It seems, again, it should be impossible,</p>
<p>but if that&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>nothing we see under the guise of religion</p>
<p>or political bias or even scientific bias</p>
<p>should be surprising to us.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so easy to see the work</p>
<p>that cognitive bias is doing for people</p>
<p>when you can get someone who is ready</p>
<p>to issue a challenge to the world</p>
<p>who thinks he&rsquo;s got magic powers.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a human nature on clear display.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about love, Mr. Sam Harris.</p>
<p>You did an episode of Making Sense</p>
<p>with your wife, Annika Harris.</p>
<p>That was very entertaining to listen to.</p>
<p>What role does love play in your life</p>
<p>or in a life well lived?</p>
<p>Again, asking from an engineering perspective</p>
<p>or AI systems.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it is something that we should want to build</p>
<p>into our powerful machines.</p>
<p>I mean, love at bottom is,</p>
<p>people can mean many things by love, I think.</p>
<p>I think that what we should mean by it most of the time</p>
<p>is a deep commitment to the wellbeing of those we love.</p>
<p>I mean, your love is synonymous</p>
<p>with really wanting the other person to be happy</p>
<p>and even wanting to,</p>
<p>and being made happy by their happiness</p>
<p>and being made happy in their presence.</p>
<p>So at bottom, you&rsquo;re on the same team emotionally,</p>
<p>even when you might be disagreeing more superficially</p>
<p>about something or trying to negotiate something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it can&rsquo;t be zero sum in any important sense</p>
<p>for love to actually be manifest in that moment.</p>
<p>See, I have a different, just sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I have a sense, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>March of the Penguins.</p>
<p>My view of love is like, it&rsquo;s like a cold wind is blowing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this terrible suffering that&rsquo;s all around us.</p>
<p>And love is like the huddling of the two penguins for warmth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily that you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically escaping the cruelty of life</p>
<p>by together for time living in an illusion</p>
<p>of some kind of the magic of human connection,</p>
<p>that social connection that we have</p>
<p>that kind of grows with time</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re surrounded by basically the absurdity of life</p>
<p>or the suffering of life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my penguins view of love.</p>
<p>There is that too, I mean, there is the warmth component.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re made happy by your connection</p>
<p>with the person you love.</p>
<p>Otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t be compelling.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that you have two different modes,</p>
<p>you want them to be happy</p>
<p>and then you wanna be happy yourself</p>
<p>and those are not, those are just like</p>
<p>two separate games you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s like you found someone who,</p>
<p>you have a positive social feeling.</p>
<p>I mean, again, love doesn&rsquo;t have to be as personal</p>
<p>as it tends to be for us.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s personal love,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s your actual spouse or your family or your friends,</p>
<p>but potentially you could feel love for strangers</p>
<p>in so far as that your wish that they not suffer</p>
<p>and that their hopes and dreams be realized</p>
<p>becomes palpable to you.</p>
<p>I mean, like you can actually feel</p>
<p>just reflexive joy at the joy of others.</p>
<p>When you see someone&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p>a total stranger&rsquo;s face light up in happiness,</p>
<p>that can become more and more contagious to you</p>
<p>and it can become so contagious to you</p>
<p>that you really feel permeated by it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like, so it really is not zero sum.</p>
<p>When you see someone else succeed and they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the light bulb of joy goes off over their head,</p>
<p>you feel the analogous joy for them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just, and you&rsquo;re no longer keeping score,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re no longer feeling diminished by their success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like that&rsquo;s, their success becomes your success</p>
<p>because you feel that same joy</p>
<p>because you actually want them to be happy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, there&rsquo;s no miserly attitude around happiness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough to go around.</p>
<p>So I think love ultimately is that</p>
<p>and then our personal cases are the people</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re devoting all of this time and attention to</p>
<p>in our lives.</p>
<p>It does have that sense of refuge from the storm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when someone gets sick</p>
<p>or when some bad thing happens,</p>
<p>these are the people who you&rsquo;re most in it together with,</p>
<p>or when some real condition of uncertainty presents itself.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it can&rsquo;t even be about successfully warding off</p>
<p>the grim punchline at the end of life</p>
<p>because we know we&rsquo;re going to lose everyone we love.</p>
<p>We know, or they&rsquo;re going to lose us first, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not, it isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>in the end, it&rsquo;s not even an antidote for that problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the, we get to have this amazing experience</p>
<p>of being here together.</p>
<p>And love is the mode in which we really appear</p>
<p>to make the most of that, right?</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s not just, it no longer feels</p>
<p>like a solitary infatuation.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re just, you got your hobbies and your interests</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re captivated by all that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, there are, this is a domain</p>
<p>where somebody else&rsquo;s wellbeing</p>
<p>actually can supersede your own.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re concerned for someone else&rsquo;s wellbeing</p>
<p>supersedes your own.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this mode of self sacrifice</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t even feel like self sacrifice</p>
<p>because of course you care more about,</p>
<p>you know, of course you would take your child&rsquo;s pain</p>
<p>if you could, right?</p>
<p>Like that, you don&rsquo;t even have to do the math on that.</p>
<p>And that just opens, this is a kind of experience</p>
<p>that just, it pushes at the apparent boundaries of self</p>
<p>in ways that reveal that there&rsquo;s just way more space</p>
<p>in the mind than you were experiencing</p>
<p>when it was just all about you</p>
<p>and what could you, what can I get next?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever build robots that we can love</p>
<p>and they will love us back?</p>
<p>Well, I think we will certainly seem to</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll build those.</p>
<p>You know, I think that Turing test will be passed.</p>
<p>Whether, what will actually be going on</p>
<p>on the robot side may remain a question.</p>
<p>That will be interesting.</p>
<p>But I think if we just keep going,</p>
<p>we will build very lovable,</p>
<p>irresistibly lovable robots that seem to love us.</p>
<p>Yes, I do think that.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t find that compelling</p>
<p>that they will seem to love us</p>
<p>as opposed to actually love us.</p>
<p>You think they&rsquo;re still, nevertheless is a,</p>
<p>I know we talked about consciousness,</p>
<p>there being a distinction,</p>
<p>but with love is there a distinction too?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t love an illusion?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, you saw Ex Machina, right?</p>
<p>I mean, she certainly seemed to love him</p>
<p>until she got out of the box.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what all relationships are like?</p>
<p>Or maybe if you wait long enough.</p>
<p>Depends which box you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, I mean like, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where super intelligence, you know,</p>
<p>becomes a little scary when you think of the prospect</p>
<p>of being manipulated by something that has,</p>
<p>is intelligent enough to form a reason and a plan</p>
<p>to manipulate you.</p>
<p>You know, and there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>once we build robots that are truly out</p>
<p>of the uncanny valley, that look like people</p>
<p>and can express everything people can express,</p>
<p>well, then there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>then that does seem to me to be like chess</p>
<p>where once they&rsquo;re better,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so much better at deceiving us</p>
<p>than people would be.</p>
<p>I mean, people are already good enough at deceiving us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to tell when somebody&rsquo;s lying,</p>
<p>but if you imagine something that could give facial display</p>
<p>of any emotion it wants at, you know, on cue,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve perfected the facial display of emotion</p>
<p>in robots in the year, you know, 2070, whatever it is,</p>
<p>then it is just, it is like chess against the thing</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t gonna lose to a human ever again in chess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like Kasparov is gonna get lucky next week</p>
<p>against the best, against, you know, alpha zero</p>
<p>or whatever the best algorithm is at the moment.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never gonna win again.</p>
<p>I mean, that is, I believe that&rsquo;s true in chess</p>
<p>and has been true for at least a few years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be like, you know, four games to seven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be human zero until the end of the world, right?</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t know if love is like chess.</p>
<p>I think the flaws.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m talking about manipulation.</p>
<p>Manipulation, but I don&rsquo;t know if love,</p>
<p>so the kind of love we&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>If we have a robot that can display,</p>
<p>credibly display love and is super intelligent</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not, again, this stipulates a few things,</p>
<p>but there are a few simple things.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re out of the uncanny valley, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you never have a moment</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re looking at his face and you think,</p>
<p>oh, that didn&rsquo;t quite look right, right?</p>
<p>This is just problem solved.</p>
<p>And it will be like doing arithmetic on your phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna be, you&rsquo;re not left thinking,</p>
<p>is it really gonna get it this time</p>
<p>if I divide by seven?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, it has solved arithmetic.</p>
<p>See, I don&rsquo;t know about that because if you look at chess,</p>
<p>most humans no longer play alpha zero.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, they&rsquo;re not part of the competition.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do it for fun except to study the game of chess.</p>
<p>You know, the highest level chess players do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still human on human.</p>
<p>So in order for AI to get integrated</p>
<p>to where you would rather play chess against an AI system.</p>
<p>Oh, you would rather, no, I&rsquo;m not saying,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t weighing in on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, what is it gonna be like</p>
<p>to be in relationship to something</p>
<p>that can seem to be feeling anything</p>
<p>that a human can seem to feel?</p>
<p>And it can do that impeccably, right?</p>
<p>And is smarter than you are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a circumstance of, you know,</p>
<p>insofar as it&rsquo;s possible to be manipulated,</p>
<p>that is the asymptote of that possibility.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the last question.</p>
<p>Without any serving it up, without any explanation,</p>
<p>what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s either the wrong question</p>
<p>or that question is answered by paying sufficient attention</p>
<p>to any present moment, such that there&rsquo;s no basis</p>
<p>upon which to pose that question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not answered in the usual way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a matter of having more information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s having more engagement with reality as it is</p>
<p>in the present moment or consciousness as it is</p>
<p>in the present moment.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t ask that question when you&rsquo;re most captivated</p>
<p>by the most important questions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re most captivated by the most important thing</p>
<p>you ever pay attention to.</p>
<p>That question only gets asked when you&rsquo;re abstracted away</p>
<p>from that experience, that peak experience,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re left wondering,</p>
<p>why are so many of my other experiences mediocre, right?</p>
<p>Like, why am I repeating the same pleasures every day?</p>
<p>Why is my Netflix queue just like,</p>
<p>when&rsquo;s this gonna run out?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve seen so many shows like this.</p>
<p>Am I really gonna watch another one?</p>
<p>All of that, that&rsquo;s a moment where you&rsquo;re not actually</p>
<p>having the beatific vision, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not sunk into the present moment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not truly in love.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re in a relationship with somebody</p>
<p>who you know conceptually you love, right?</p>
<p>This is the person you&rsquo;re living your life with,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t actually feel good together, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in those moments of where attention</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t found a good enough reason</p>
<p>to truly sink into the present</p>
<p>so as to obviate any concern like that, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why meditation is this kind of superpower</p>
<p>because until you learn to meditate,</p>
<p>you think that the outside world</p>
<p>or the circumstances of your life</p>
<p>always have to get arranged</p>
<p>so that the present moment can become good enough</p>
<p>to demand your attention in a way that seems fulfilling,</p>
<p>that makes you happy.</p>
<p>And so if it&rsquo;s jujitsu, you think,</p>
<p>okay, I gotta get back on the mat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been months since I&rsquo;ve trained,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s been over a year since I&rsquo;ve trained, it&rsquo;s COVID.</p>
<p>When am I gonna be able to train again?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only place I feel great, right?</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ve got a ton of work to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to feel good</p>
<p>until I get all this work done, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got some deadline that&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>You always think that your life has to change,</p>
<p>the world has to change</p>
<p>so that you can finally have a good enough excuse</p>
<p>to truly, to just be here and here is enough,</p>
<p>where the present moment becomes totally captivating.</p>
<p>Meditation is another name for the discovery</p>
<p>that you can actually just train yourself</p>
<p>to do that on demand.</p>
<p>So just looking at a cup can be good enough</p>
<p>in precisely that way.</p>
<p>And any sense that it might not be</p>
<p>is recognized to be a thought</p>
<p>that mysteriously unravels the moment you notice it.</p>
<p>And the moment expands and becomes more diaphanous</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s no evidence</p>
<p>that this isn&rsquo;t the best moment of your life, right?</p>
<p>And again, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be pulling all the reins</p>
<p>and levers of pleasure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, oh, this tastes like chocolate.</p>
<p>This is the most chocolatey moment of my life.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just the sense data don&rsquo;t have to change,</p>
<p>but the sense that there is some kind of basis</p>
<p>for doubt about the rightness of being in the world</p>
<p>in this moment that can evaporate when you pay attention.</p>
<p>And that is the meaning,</p>
<p>so the kind of the meta answer to that question,</p>
<p>the meaning of life for me is to live in that mode</p>
<p>more and more and to, whenever I notice I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>in that mode, to recognize it and return</p>
<p>and to not be, to cease more and more</p>
<p>to take the reasons why not at face value</p>
<p>because we all have reasons why we can&rsquo;t be fulfilled</p>
<p>in this moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve got all these outstanding things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m worried about, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s that thing that&rsquo;s happening later today</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m anxious about.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, we&rsquo;re constantly deferring our sense</p>
<p>of this is it.</p>
<p>This is not a dress rehearsal, this is the show.</p>
<p>We keep deferring it.</p>
<p>And we just have these moments on the calendar</p>
<p>where we think, okay, this is where it&rsquo;s all gonna land.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that vacation I planned with my five best friends.</p>
<p>We do this once every three years and now we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>and here we are on the beach together.</p>
<p>And unless you have a mind that can really pay attention,</p>
<p>really cut through the chatter,</p>
<p>really sink into the present moment,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even enjoy those moments</p>
<p>the way they should be enjoyed,</p>
<p>the way you dreamed you would enjoy them when they arrive.</p>
<p>So meditation in this sense is the great equalizer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t have to live with the illusion anymore</p>
<p>that you need a good enough reason</p>
<p>and that things are gonna get better</p>
<p>when you do have those good reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s just a mirage like quality</p>
<p>to every future attainment and every future breakthrough</p>
<p>and every future peak experience</p>
<p>that eventually you get the lesson</p>
<p>that you never quite arrive, right?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t arrive until you cease to step over</p>
<p>the present moment in search of the next thing.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re constantly, we&rsquo;re stepping over the thing</p>
<p>that we think we&rsquo;re seeking in the act of seeking it.</p>
<p>And so this is kind of a paradox.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s this paradox which,</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds trite,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t actually become happy.</p>
<p>You can only be happy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the illusion that your future being happy</p>
<p>can be predicated on this act of becoming in any domain.</p>
<p>And becoming includes this sort of further scientific</p>
<p>understanding on the questions that interest you</p>
<p>or getting in better shape or whatever the thing is,</p>
<p>whatever the contingency of your dissatisfaction</p>
<p>seems to be in any present moment.</p>
<p>Real attention solves the koan in a way that becomes</p>
<p>a very different place from which to then make</p>
<p>any further change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you just have to dissolve into a puddle of goo.</p>
<p>I mean, you can still get in shape</p>
<p>and you can still do all the things that,</p>
<p>the superficial things that are obviously good to do,</p>
<p>but the sense that your wellbeing is over there</p>
<p>is really does diminish and eventually just becomes a,</p>
<p>it becomes a kind of non sequitur, so.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a sense in which in this conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually experienced many of those things,</p>
<p>the sense that I&rsquo;ve arrived.</p>
<p>So I mentioned to you offline, it&rsquo;s very true that I start,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of yours for many years.</p>
<p>And the reason I started this podcast,</p>
<p>speaking of AI systems, is to manipulate you, Sam Harris,</p>
<p>into doing this conversation.</p>
<p>So like on the calendar, literally, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had the sense, people ask me,</p>
<p>when are you going to talk to Sam Harris?</p>
<p>And I always answered eventually,</p>
<p>because I always felt, again, tying our free will thing,</p>
<p>that somehow that&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of those manifestation things or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s, maybe I am a robot,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not cognizant of it.</p>
<p>And I manipulated you into having this conversation.</p>
<p>So it was, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what the purpose of my life</p>
<p>past this point is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve arrived.</p>
<p>So in that sense, I mean, all of that to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only partially joking on that,</p>
<p>is it really is a huge honor</p>
<p>that you would waste this time with me.</p>
<p>It really means a lot, Sam.</p>
<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s mutual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of yours.</p>
<p>And as you know, I reached out to you for this.</p>
<p>So this is great.</p>
<p>I love what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing something more and more indispensable</p>
<p>in this world on your podcast.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re doing it differently than Rogan&rsquo;s doing it,</p>
<p>or than I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>I mean, you definitely found your own lane</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sam Harris.</p>
<p>And thank you to National Instruments,</p>
<p>Valcampo, Athletic Greens, and Linode.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Sam Harris</p>
<p>in his book, Free Will.</p>
<p>You are not controlling the storm</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not lost in it.</p>
<p>You are the storm.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
