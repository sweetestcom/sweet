<p>sarian and today is</p>

<p>you guessed it it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup monday</p>
<p>if you are new here hi how are you</p>

<p>crime story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>knock in and i do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true crime</p>
<p>and you like makeup</p>
<p>i highly suggest you subscribe and i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>excited to be here because i am</p>
<p>going to talk about a cult woo</p>
<p>i love cults</p>
<p>i just am fascinated</p>
<p>by them i&rsquo;m very interested in them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fascinating i mean</p>
<p>wow cults wow i tried my best to</p>
<p>simplify it as much as i could because jim</p>
<p>jones had the most random ass life he was everywhere</p>
<p>especially his childhood was just like</p>
<p>wow what the fuck&rsquo;s going on it was so random</p>
<p>and then later down the road there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more people involved with what goes on</p>
<p>and i left them out because</p>
<p>honestly it will get really confusing so i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>focusing on jim jones and his</p>
<p>story i will stop rambling</p>
<p>i missed you guys i&rsquo;m happy to be here</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s get</p>
<p>right into it i was reading a biography</p>
<p>about jim jones</p>
<p>and his upbringing</p>
<p>stuff and like</p>
<p>so random this guy was so wow wow</p>
<p>random he at one</p>
<p>point like he stayed or</p>
<p>lived with like a kennedy</p>
<p>during the summer</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how and there wasn&rsquo;t much information</p>
<p>about anyways okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>ahead of myself i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>excited okay so let&rsquo;s just get right into it</p>
<p>jim his parents were</p>
<p>laneta jones and james jones</p>
<p>james was a veteran of</p>
<p>world war one</p>
<p>and was living on disability</p>
<p>payments from being a</p>
<p>victim of a gas attack in the war</p>
<p>it was said that he was emotionally absent</p>
<p>and rarely showed any affection</p>
<p>towards his</p>
<p>jim&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>her name was laneta</p>
<p>she was more of a free</p>
<p>spirit she didn&rsquo;t care for religion</p>
<p>or any sky god</p>
<p>she called any god sky god</p>
<p>you get it anyway</p>
<p>so she didn&rsquo;t care for religion at all</p>
<p>and she just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t believe in anything</p>
<p>which was not a</p>
<p>thing for women to be free</p>
<p>thinkers or to be</p>
<p>thinking like this at the time so it was like</p>
<p>she was the</p>
<p>weird one on the</p>
<p>block you know like oh don&rsquo;t go to her</p>
<p>house because</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t believe in anything you know she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she has an opinion</p>
<p>stay clear so she also liked to keep to herself</p>
<p>she kept herself busy</p>
<p>and was constantly working it was</p>
<p>said that she had no maternal instincts and that she</p>
<p>honestly had no desire to even have children</p>
<p>and loneta then became pregnant</p>
<p>and gave birth to</p>
<p>james aka jim</p>
<p>warren jones</p>
<p>and he was born on may 13th 1931</p>
<p>so the family</p>
<p>ended up moving to</p>
<p>lynn indiana</p>
<p>and jim would describe his</p>
<p>childhood as loveless that his parents were</p>
<p>never around</p>
<p>he was always home</p>
<p>alone and his parents just</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t care about him</p>
<p>his mom didn&rsquo;t want to be a mom</p>
<p>she would keep herself busy</p>
<p>by working all of the time his father was just</p>
<p>he was sick</p>
<p>it was said that he was an alcoholic but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite get clarification on that one in high</p>
<p>school jim was</p>
<p>known to wear his</p>
<p>sunday clothes almost</p>
<p>every day he</p>
<p>would wear a</p>
<p>white pressed</p>
<p>shirt and nice</p>
<p>slacks that most people</p>
<p>would save for</p>
<p>going to church you know</p>
<p>church slacks</p>
<p>so he was wearing this</p>
<p>every day to</p>
<p>school jim said that he participated in some sports</p>
<p>and he even formed his own baseball team</p>
<p>with the kids on his block</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t really good</p>
<p>at any of the</p>
<p>sports but he</p>
<p>was really good at forming teams and being</p>
<p>the leader mm hmm</p>
<p>which honestly though i mean that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>whoa not in this case</p>
<p>now as a teenager jim said that he explored</p>
<p>the different churches in town</p>
<p>he went to as many churches as he</p>
<p>could and he</p>
<p>would just go</p>
<p>sit in and see</p>
<p>what they were preaching what they were</p>
<p>saying and he just wanted to know as much as he could</p>
<p>about the different options and</p>
<p>different religions out there because there were a lot</p>
<p>so jim would just hop around and he would</p>
<p>he was just trying to find the right fit</p>
<p>the religion</p>
<p>or the church</p>
<p>where he felt like he belonged something that he could</p>
<p>stand by jim</p>
<p>would carry a</p>
<p>bible with him</p>
<p>everywhere he went</p>
<p>and also as a</p>
<p>teenager he</p>
<p>would go out</p>
<p>in the street like the main center</p>
<p>where a lot of people</p>
<p>shopping and</p>
<p>stuff and he</p>
<p>would be preaching</p>
<p>preaching the</p>
<p>bible he was very passionate</p>
<p>about it at the</p>
<p>age of 17 jim he got a job at a hospital</p>
<p>and he was working as</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know the actual</p>
<p>like job position but you know he was like a helper he</p>
<p>would often</p>
<p>clean up vomit</p>
<p>he would help with moving newly deceased</p>
<p>or handling</p>
<p>disposal of amputated limbs</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know how i went from</p>
<p>throw up to</p>
<p>amputated limbs but that&rsquo;s kind of what he did</p>
<p>at 17 which is like it was</p>
<p>whatever okay but jim said this is like</p>
<p>where he just thrived</p>
<p>and he was now considering getting into</p>
<p>medicine because he just</p>
<p>loved it so in 1948</p>
<p>while working at the hospital that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where jim met</p>
<p>a nursing student who was also working there</p>
<p>her name was</p>
<p>marceline they got</p>
<p>along really well and</p>
<p>ended up dating</p>
<p>and marceline said that she was attracted</p>
<p>to him because he was just such a caring caring</p>
<p>individual he just loved</p>
<p>everybody and he</p>
<p>truly believed that everybody was equal</p>
<p>and it was his</p>
<p>responsibility</p>
<p>to devote his life to helping</p>
<p>others like that&rsquo;s what he was</p>
<p>telling her you know and she just fell in love with him</p>
<p>so after dating for</p>
<p>quite some time they</p>
<p>ended up getting</p>
<p>married in june of 1949</p>
<p>and marceline was under the</p>
<p>impression that</p>
<p>was christian</p>
<p>a christian man and believed in god but</p>
<p>after they had gotten</p>
<p>married she noticed</p>
<p>you know things had</p>
<p>changed or maybe</p>
<p>like she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite fully</p>
<p>understand what jim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>religion or beliefs were jim</p>
<p>would tell her that he didn&rsquo;t believe in her god and</p>
<p>they would get into like really heated arguments</p>
<p>over it just over</p>
<p>their beliefs and</p>
<p>and because divorce was heavily frowned upon</p>
<p>marceline knew that</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t even an</p>
<p>option really okay if you got a divorce it was like ooh</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with her</p>
<p>marceline just decided</p>
<p>that she was gonna</p>
<p>stick it out</p>
<p>or at least try to</p>
<p>understand exactly what jim</p>
<p>did believe in</p>
<p>or maybe she</p>
<p>could like convert him you know</p>
<p>often jim would take marceline</p>
<p>to the local</p>
<p>black and african american churches that were in</p>
<p>their city jim said that he was like really</p>
<p>drawn to them because</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t so</p>
<p>stiff the white churches he had been to</p>
<p>they were just so</p>
<p>boring and people just seemed like they had to be there</p>
<p>versus wanting to be there but at the</p>
<p>black and african</p>
<p>american churches people there were jumping singing</p>
<p>dancing during worship</p>
<p>and just seemed to be having a really fun</p>
<p>time and not acting like they had to be there</p>
<p>so when jim found</p>
<p>these churches</p>
<p>he just fell in</p>
<p>love love and he knew that</p>
<p>this is where</p>
<p>he had to be</p>
<p>the one church that he</p>
<p>ended up like</p>
<p>becoming a member of they welcomed him and</p>
<p>his wife with open arms</p>
<p>and in 1952</p>
<p>jim was 21 years old at that time</p>
<p>he was actually</p>
<p>hired as a student pastor for the church kim just</p>
<p>found like this new calling remember he was like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be a nurse or something well now he was like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna be a pastor</p>
<p>yeah so this was his new calling he was</p>
<p>gonna be a pastor</p>

<p>so jim was a student pastor for</p>
<p>about a year</p>
<p>he would just kind of grow</p>
<p>frustrated because he wanted to do his own thing</p>
<p>versus being told what to do so he was like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna open up my own church</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m gonna open it up in indianapolis</p>
<p>so he did just that and</p>
<p>he liked the freedom of it because</p>
<p>preach what he wanted</p>
<p>to preach and not be told what he had to do he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna be told what to do</p>
<p>at jim&rsquo;s church he</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>blended christianity with a new</p>
<p>age spirituality</p>
<p>and radical</p>
<p>social justice</p>
<p>which attracted a very</p>
<p>loyal following</p>
<p>now jim&rsquo;s congregation was</p>
<p>known for being racially</p>
<p>integrated which was not a</p>
<p>thing yet at this time there were</p>
<p>white churches</p>
<p>and then there were the</p>
<p>black churches</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t such thing as</p>
<p>mixing going on</p>
<p>but jim didn&rsquo;t like that and he</p>
<p>truly believed that everybody was</p>
<p>equal and he wanted everybody welcome</p>
<p>in his church</p>
<p>his wife marceline also worked</p>
<p>alongside with</p>
<p>him and she was the one who was on top of</p>
<p>all the paperwork and keeping</p>
<p>things organized</p>
<p>schedule this</p>
<p>sunday we&rsquo;re gonna talk</p>
<p>about this that</p>
<p>sunday we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna talk about</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>jesus doing</p>
<p>stuff the next</p>
<p>sunday we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna talk about</p>
<p>jesus doing more</p>
<p>stuff so she</p>
<p>was in charge of that the church itself was very</p>
<p>successful and the location</p>
<p>that they were staying at</p>
<p>it was becoming way too</p>
<p>small for all of</p>
<p>their new members</p>
<p>so they were looking into expanding</p>
<p>into a much larger area</p>
<p>so the current</p>
<p>area that jim&rsquo;s church was in</p>
<p>it was a low income community</p>
<p>and he knew</p>
<p>like he couldn&rsquo;t ask the community or the members for</p>
<p>money or donations</p>
<p>to get a bigger place</p>
<p>because he knew like a lot of them were struggling</p>
<p>instead he needed a better plan</p>
<p>a better plan he needed a better plan and his plan</p>
<p>was to up his performance</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good plan</p>
<p>right jim needed to wow</p>
<p>the crowds and he</p>
<p>could do this by performing miracles</p>
<p>right i mean that&rsquo;s how you wow a</p>
<p>crowd miracles</p>
<p>you got miracles at your church wow</p>
<p>mirror so jim</p>
<p>would command</p>
<p>people in the</p>
<p>crowd you know he&rsquo;d call</p>
<p>random people</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d be like i command your headache to vanish</p>
<p>and it would</p>
<p>or he would command</p>
<p>coughs to stop</p>
<p>he knew that people</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>his miracles</p>
<p>right off the bat</p>
<p>until he had gained</p>
<p>their trust</p>
<p>so he started</p>
<p>with coughs and headaches</p>
<p>right he started</p>
<p>small but jim</p>
<p>would declare that</p>
<p>these people were healed</p>
<p>he would be yelling</p>
<p>healed by the</p>
<p>power of god has</p>
<p>granted through him</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really like amping everybody up like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>concert he&rsquo;s like yeah healed</p>
<p>word got out i mean people were talking</p>
<p>hey this guy over here he&rsquo;s healing headaches</p>
<p>you gotta go see him it&rsquo;s wild</p>
<p>and people were coming in and jim</p>
<p>would then this is how</p>
<p>where the money comes in</p>
<p>he was passing around the</p>
<p>collection plates</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how he would</p>
<p>start making</p>
<p>more and more and more</p>
<p>money and he</p>
<p>was like oh shit i&rsquo;m onto something here you guys</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s said that like jim didn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>fully guilty</p>
<p>i guess because like he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything</p>
<p>bad was he yeah</p>
<p>so he was making a lot of</p>
<p>money all of a sudden</p>
<p>jim would occasionally go to different</p>
<p>local churches</p>
<p>and do little</p>
<p>guest spots</p>
<p>going around to</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>churches and whatnot it was also introducing jim to</p>
<p>a bigger crowd</p>
<p>jim knew that</p>
<p>going to these new churches</p>
<p>and people didn&rsquo;t know who he was that they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to believe his healings</p>
<p>right out the gate</p>
<p>so he instead let a few</p>
<p>close people in on</p>
<p>what was really going down</p>
<p>his healing powers oh yeah</p>
<p>so jim would</p>
<p>bring in friends</p>
<p>people who attended his own church</p>
<p>and used them as</p>
<p>audience plants who</p>
<p>would pretend</p>
<p>to be suffering from something and then be healed</p>
<p>for example one couple from the audience</p>
<p>stood up and</p>
<p>talked to the rest of the church</p>
<p>and said oh we used to have a serious</p>
<p>heart defect</p>
<p>and because of jim</p>
<p>we are all better cured wow</p>
<p>and it was just to</p>
<p>prove to the</p>
<p>other audience members that</p>
<p>again he could heal</p>
<p>i mean it worked people were like what his feelings</p>
<p>evolved over time from</p>
<p>small things like</p>
<p>again the headaches</p>
<p>and whatnot</p>
<p>to now curing cancer</p>
<p>mm hmm at one church he brought in</p>
<p>an audience</p>
<p>plant and the person who was cured</p>
<p>would jump up and down and they</p>
<p>would be celebrating that they were cured even</p>
<p>though they</p>
<p>never had cancer in the</p>
<p>first place the whole</p>
<p>thing is fucked up</p>
<p>but because of his new fame he was</p>
<p>bringing in more</p>
<p>money a lot of</p>
<p>money and now he</p>
<p>could upgrade to a bigger</p>
<p>building so jim purchased a larger</p>
<p>building that</p>
<p>could hold up to</p>
<p>700 people and this was in</p>
<p>indianapolis</p>
<p>this time his church was called community</p>
<p>unity but this new</p>
<p>community unity</p>
<p>i like that</p>
<p>actually why did he change it oh i know i know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>about to tell you because the new</p>
<p>building that he moved into</p>
<p>already had the word of</p>
<p>temple carved into</p>
<p>stone on the outside of the</p>
<p>building it was a jewish</p>
<p>congregation before that but that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>jim just decided to name it the people&rsquo;s temple</p>
<p>so during this time economic</p>
<p>segregation was deep seated in indianapolis and</p>
<p>and jim made it</p>
<p>his goal to integrate african americans</p>
<p>and the black community into</p>
<p>every aspect of indianapolis</p>
<p>jim was passionate</p>
<p>about equality</p>
<p>and he would go with some of his church members</p>
<p>kind of like a mixture of people</p>
<p>and they would go to local</p>
<p>white owned restaurants and shops</p>
<p>and fight for</p>
<p>their equality</p>
<p>so a lot of shop owners</p>
<p>would tell jim</p>
<p>no we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>black people here</p>
<p>jim decided to use the church</p>
<p>members and himself not even use i mean they wanted to</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>would have peaceful protests in</p>
<p>front of the restaurants</p>
<p>until eventually</p>
<p>the shop owners or the restaurant</p>
<p>owners gave in</p>
<p>and served all races</p>
<p>now here was</p>
<p>the interesting part that i didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>about and i thought was</p>
<p>very interesting when businesses actually agreed to</p>
<p>allow everybody into the restaurants or business jim</p>
<p>said that he</p>
<p>would give them hundreds of customers and he</p>
<p>would make sure that they made tons of money</p>
<p>because they allowed this to happen</p>
<p>you know so jim</p>
<p>would hand out flyers</p>
<p>to his church members</p>
<p>with the list</p>
<p>it had a list of restaurants who supported them</p>
<p>and would accept african americans or the</p>
<p>black community</p>
<p>equally into</p>
<p>their business</p>
<p>so they had this</p>
<p>good list going</p>
<p>and also all of the members went there</p>
<p>these businesses</p>
<p>benefited from this advertising</p>
<p>and words spread that</p>
<p>hey if you cooperate</p>
<p>with jim jones over here</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll make mad</p>
<p>money so just let the people in</p>
<p>and his church people became some of the best friends a</p>
<p>small businessman</p>
<p>could have because</p>
<p>they were making</p>
<p>money the whole</p>
<p>story i mean i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>obviously giving you just like a little</p>
<p>breakdown this is a side note</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m giving you it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>vague you know but oh he really like went out there and</p>
<p>they would have their</p>
<p>um where&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>brain what is this</p>
<p>am i churning butter</p>
<p>what is this the sign</p>
<p>peaceful protests and just</p>
<p>standing with the sign</p>
<p>outside of these businesses and</p>
<p>fighting for equality</p>
<p>and jim was really passionate</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>he went to many restaurants and businesses and he was</p>
<p>dedicated to this</p>
<p>so jim presented himself as the</p>
<p>voice of reason and went</p>
<p>after more businesses to change</p>
<p>their policies pretty much to keep the community</p>
<p>segregated remember how</p>
<p>earlier in the</p>
<p>story i said he</p>
<p>would go out and preach on the streets</p>
<p>he was preaching</p>
<p>about equality for all because</p>
<p>the community of the city was</p>
<p>still very segregated and as a</p>
<p>teenager i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like wow</p>
<p>so in 1965 jim his wife</p>
<p>i think they had kids by this time</p>
<p>oh my gosh wow bailey</p>
<p>anywho but they</p>
<p>moved to eukaya</p>
<p>california and they put</p>
<p>money towards a new</p>
<p>place to hold the people&rsquo;s temple</p>
<p>about 50 to 60 church members</p>
<p>did follow the church out to california</p>
<p>which is what they were hoping for</p>
<p>in the year 1969</p>
<p>jim&rsquo;s church</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t as popular</p>
<p>as he was hoping it</p>
<p>would be by then</p>
<p>so jim was really feeling down and sad because</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t poppin</p>
<p>like he thought</p>
<p>and also on top of that</p>
<p>the marriage between his wife</p>
<p>of 20 years marceline</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t gone well it was crafting</p>
<p>the couple at this</p>
<p>point they had four children</p>
<p>one of them was</p>
<p>their biological child and</p>
<p>three were adopted</p>
<p>jim was just</p>
<p>fully focused on his church you know</p>
<p>and obviously marceline</p>
<p>put her focus</p>
<p>on her children</p>
<p>jim ended up having an affair</p>
<p>with one of his much younger church</p>
<p>member fangirl</p>
<p>and this was</p>
<p>going against</p>
<p>everything that he was preaching he</p>
<p>would be telling the audience members</p>
<p>like you know don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cheat on your wife or husband</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wrong it&rsquo;s a sin blah blah blah so</p>
<p>of course jim is doing this himself and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>thinking like shit</p>
<p>if the church members</p>
<p>find out that i&rsquo;m having an affair</p>
<p>there it would be game over</p>
<p>so instead he went to his wife</p>
<p>marceline and told her the truth</p>
<p>marceline had some</p>
<p>issues with her back</p>
<p>which had left her bedridden</p>
<p>most of the days and because of this she wasn&rsquo;t able</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t able to sexually satisfy him</p>
<p>because her back hurt</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just like</p>
<p>her back hurt she was bedridden</p>
<p>and like yeah</p>
<p>so she wasn&rsquo;t able to sexually satisfied him</p>
<p>so jim told marceline</p>
<p>i love you i</p>
<p>still want to be</p>
<p>married to you it&rsquo;s just you</p>
<p>know look i have this girl on the side who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to give me the</p>
<p>sexual part</p>
<p>of the relationship that you can&rsquo;t provide for me</p>
<p>jim was able to set it up in a way that made marceline</p>
<p>understand and just accept it</p>
<p>it was just sex</p>
<p>and not an emotional relationship so</p>
<p>marceline&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>okay i guess</p>
<p>she i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think she really even had any option to be honest</p>
<p>or she gonna say no and then what</p>
<p>leave him where she</p>
<p>gonna go i mean her</p>
<p>whole life revolved around the church and gym</p>
<p>she honestly</p>
<p>from what i</p>
<p>read it seemed like she didn&rsquo;t have anything set</p>
<p>up for herself so it&rsquo;s like she even if she wanted to</p>
<p>leave it even if she did</p>
<p>leave it was like</p>
<p>what was she gonna do</p>
<p>but then get this get</p>
<p>this jim then went to his church</p>
<p>and he told the members</p>
<p>what was going on</p>
<p>and he just kept it honest</p>
<p>got up there and said hey everybody</p>
<p>god is good</p>
<p>and so are 19 year olds hey up top</p>
<p>so jim went to his church and just told him what was</p>
<p>going on i&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sleeping with this</p>
<p>chick over there she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right there everybody i&rsquo;m having an affair</p>
<p>and he was just really honest but</p>
<p>jim&rsquo;s followers the church members they actually really</p>
<p>understood and they supported the decision</p>
<p>the church had a lot</p>
<p>of ups and downs throughout the years but jim just kept</p>
<p>going in march of 1970</p>
<p>he had a pretty good size following and was</p>
<p>bring in some good money</p>
<p>again jim would</p>
<p>travel with some members</p>
<p>to los angeles</p>
<p>and seattle</p>
<p>where he drew</p>
<p>crowds and hopes to</p>
<p>bring more people and attention to the people&rsquo;s temple</p>
<p>so he was traveling a little bit further to perform</p>
<p>these miracles that he was doing</p>
<p>he would set up temporary</p>
<p>booths outside</p>
<p>venues where he would give</p>
<p>sermons and sell</p>
<p>photos of himself for 5</p>
<p>and he was also healing people at these</p>
<p>sermons so people were just like wow</p>
<p>have you seen this jim jones guy</p>
<p>i was trying to get some</p>
<p>bread at the</p>
<p>store stopped and saw him do this like</p>
<p>thing bought a five dollar</p>
<p>picture of him</p>
<p>yeah know and like people were just talking i mean</p>
<p>he was getting a lot of hype</p>
<p>during this time jim</p>
<p>would have the people who are</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>sermon fill out</p>
<p>paperwork with like</p>
<p>their name and mailing address on it which they</p>
<p>would turn into him</p>
<p>when they were done filling it out</p>
<p>he ended up</p>
<p>using that as</p>
<p>marketing material</p>
<p>he wouldn&rsquo;t mail people pamphlets</p>
<p>about what was</p>
<p>going on in the church</p>
<p>all the healings that they had accomplished</p>
<p>and also received donations through the mail</p>
<p>because he was doing such big</p>
<p>great things</p>
<p>at his church they</p>
<p>never actually like</p>
<p>asked for money</p>
<p>they never asked for a donation well</p>
<p>they kind of did they like</p>
<p>if you wanna if you</p>
<p>wanna donate you can</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to people are</p>
<p>still donating</p>
<p>money constantly</p>
<p>and because</p>
<p>of the influx of</p>
<p>money that they were getting</p>
<p>the people&rsquo;s temple decided to open up</p>
<p>stores yes stores</p>
<p>where people or members</p>
<p>could donate items they no longer</p>
<p>wanted so essentially like a salvation</p>
<p>army or goodwill</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>sell secondhand</p>
<p>clothing there and a lot of the church members</p>
<p>would work there as well</p>
<p>work at the</p>
<p>store also they</p>
<p>would serve</p>
<p>free meals in low</p>
<p>income areas and one of the most</p>
<p>impressive programs was one that</p>
<p>sent teens to college who couldn&rsquo;t afford it</p>
<p>so the people&rsquo;s temple</p>
<p>they would use</p>
<p>their donation</p>
<p>money again</p>
<p>to pay for college</p>
<p>for people who couldn&rsquo;t afford it</p>
<p>but it covered</p>
<p>books tuition</p>
<p>and they also purchased</p>
<p>houses which they</p>
<p>ended up remodeling</p>
<p>into dormitories</p>
<p>so the students had free housing and meals</p>
<p>like it seemed</p>
<p>i mean what i was reading i was like wow good for you</p>
<p>so they had some very</p>
<p>impressive programs</p>
<p>now eventually</p>
<p>the people&rsquo;s temple</p>
<p>would establish permanent</p>
<p>churches in san francisco</p>
<p>and los angeles</p>
<p>many of the people who worked at the churches</p>
<p>were members</p>
<p>who then stepped up</p>
<p>and felt the calling to be a part of what jim was doing</p>
<p>jim would put fear</p>
<p>into his followers telling them that</p>
<p>racists were trying to shut them down</p>
<p>and were threatening</p>
<p>to harm them</p>
<p>so the mentality</p>
<p>among the followers was</p>
<p>said to be quote</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with us</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to convince you</p>
<p>if we can&rsquo;t convince you you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>enemy end quote</p>
<p>which a lot of people have this</p>
<p>mentality now am i</p>
<p>right can i get name in</p>
<p>god is good</p>
<p>god is good okay</p>
<p>so over time</p>
<p>jim became more</p>
<p>and more controlling</p>
<p>or judgmental</p>
<p>towards followers</p>
<p>who did not</p>
<p>spend all of their time</p>
<p>dedicated towards the temple</p>
<p>so going out to a movie</p>
<p>was prohibited</p>
<p>and it was better</p>
<p>to give that</p>
<p>money directly to the church like why are you</p>
<p>going to see that</p>
<p>movie you should be donating</p>
<p>that to the church you know like just making them feel</p>
<p>so jim also</p>
<p>discouraged</p>
<p>romantic relationships</p>
<p>because it was distracting</p>
<p>they should be at the church</p>
<p>he also told them that they shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>drinking or doing drugs because</p>
<p>it weakened</p>
<p>the will as well as the body</p>
<p>couples who joined the church were allowed to remain</p>
<p>that way but time together was</p>
<p>limited by temple chores and duties</p>
<p>it kind of duties</p>
<p>duty it kind of</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>scientology</p>
<p>he would keep them busy around the church making them</p>
<p>clean making them just do shit</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>do it and his followers did pretty much whatever he</p>
<p>asked of them</p>
<p>part of the</p>
<p>reason was belief in the temple and its purposes</p>
<p>so then the people&rsquo;s temple</p>
<p>ended up buying a</p>
<p>bunch of buses it was like</p>
<p>about a dozen buses and they</p>
<p>would make trips from san francisco to los angeles</p>
<p>then seattle</p>
<p>and while on the road jim</p>
<p>would make appearances</p>
<p>at different churches</p>
<p>allowing them with you know his healing powers</p>
<p>and he was also preaching and</p>
<p>fighting for equality</p>
<p>the healings were always a high point and</p>
<p>still he was</p>
<p>using insiders to be healed</p>
<p>from the audience</p>
<p>jim would also sometimes call out names from an</p>
<p>index card announcing that this person was unaware</p>
<p>of a cancer that was in</p>
<p>their system</p>
<p>and then a temple nurse</p>
<p>would be dispatched into the</p>
<p>crowd to swab</p>
<p>out the person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>throat in preparation for jim&rsquo;s healing so they</p>
<p>would like open up</p>
<p>their mouth you know</p>
<p>and like swab it try and</p>
<p>clean it but in this process the</p>
<p>nurse she had a little bit</p>
<p>he or she had a little bit of chicken</p>
<p>liver like in</p>
<p>their hand and they</p>
<p>would drop it</p>
<p>into the person&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mouth when they were swapping</p>
<p>naturally the person</p>
<p>would gag and</p>
<p>cough it back up like</p>
<p>and the nurse</p>
<p>would then be like oh my god spit it out</p>
<p>spit it out into my hand and then they</p>
<p>would spit it out into</p>
<p>their hand the</p>
<p>nurse would</p>
<p>call it the cancer</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d be like look everybody the cancer</p>
<p>and she would be</p>
<p>he or she i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry cause sometimes it was a guy too they</p>
<p>would be showing</p>
<p>cancer off to the audience</p>
<p>aka the chicken</p>
<p>liver like oh my god you guys look</p>
<p>this just came out of him</p>
<p>and then jim</p>
<p>would start yelling to spit</p>
<p>spit it out and that</p>
<p>their life has been</p>
<p>saved i mean he had his</p>
<p>tricks it worked it worked</p>
<p>so around 1971</p>
<p>this is when jim began</p>
<p>abusing drugs on a regular basis</p>
<p>he would use</p>
<p>pills and liquids to provide</p>
<p>boosts of energy</p>
<p>during the day or in the morning</p>
<p>and then at</p>
<p>night time he</p>
<p>would take something to help him sleep</p>
<p>getting drugs was actually very easy</p>
<p>for him because some of his followers</p>
<p>could provide prescriptions to jim no problem</p>
<p>jim said that it was</p>
<p>pretty easy to hide</p>
<p>the fact that he was doing drugs in the</p>
<p>first place from his followers</p>
<p>but soon jim</p>
<p>would become very</p>
<p>short tempered</p>
<p>and his eyes were constantly</p>
<p>red and watery</p>
<p>which is what led him to wearing the infamous</p>
<p>dark sunglasses</p>
<p>24 7 he was wearing them all the</p>
<p>time now jim at first</p>
<p>to members he was very kind</p>
<p>caring genuine</p>
<p>wanted to help people</p>
<p>seemed like a good person</p>
<p>once he started doing drugs that&rsquo;s when he was</p>
<p>becoming just very mean</p>
<p>possessive controlling psycho just paranoid everything</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>there were members out there who probably put the</p>
<p>pieces together</p>
<p>but for the most part most members didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>question it i guess</p>
<p>so jim&rsquo;s wearing his dark sunglasses 24</p>
<p>7 and jim told</p>
<p>his followers</p>
<p>that he was wearing the sunglasses because his</p>
<p>inner powers</p>
<p>were so great that</p>
<p>the holy energy often</p>
<p>glowed from his eyes</p>
<p>and his followers</p>
<p>if they looked at him directly</p>
<p>the holy glow</p>
<p>would burn them and they could die</p>
<p>and they believed it</p>
<p>so they were like okay</p>
<p>also a side</p>
<p>effect from his drug</p>
<p>abuse was jim&rsquo;s heightened</p>
<p>sense of paranoia jim</p>
<p>would preach to</p>
<p>his followers that the government was a danger to them</p>
<p>and that the fbi</p>
<p>and cia were tapping the temple&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phone line jim</p>
<p>would tell his</p>
<p>followers that they all needed to be on constant</p>
<p>alert which</p>
<p>caused fear</p>
<p>and the followers felt just like really nervous</p>
<p>scared they thought that they were</p>
<p>going to be a</p>
<p>target of some kind of attack</p>
<p>the holy spirit</p>
<p>in my eyes will burn them and we will be protected</p>
<p>the church members</p>
<p>would call jim and his wife</p>
<p>marceline mom and dad</p>
<p>and their relationship was very</p>
<p>close with the church</p>
<p>jim and marceline</p>
<p>they were very frugal</p>
<p>and they never</p>
<p>drove like a new car</p>
<p>they drove like an old speed up</p>
<p>wagon i believe but</p>
<p>they never got new</p>
<p>clothes they only</p>
<p>shopped from the secondhand</p>
<p>store that they were running jim</p>
<p>would say that he</p>
<p>never wanted to give the</p>
<p>impression to his church that he was better than them</p>
<p>and that he</p>
<p>he was one of them</p>
<p>see i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>spending any</p>
<p>money i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>spending any church</p>
<p>money on myself or for things</p>
<p>it all went back to the church</p>
<p>over time jim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drug problem increased and he</p>
<p>would go on</p>
<p>to have numerous affairs</p>
<p>with other members</p>
<p>and believed</p>
<p>that he needed more sex</p>
<p>with a variety</p>
<p>of partners</p>
<p>and his ego was just increasing he believed all</p>
<p>women regardless of their</p>
<p>age and whether they</p>
<p>would admit it or not</p>
<p>but he believed that all</p>
<p>women were attracted</p>
<p>to him he was like they all want me</p>
<p>eventually almost all of the</p>
<p>women and jim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inner circle</p>
<p>would become his</p>
<p>sexual partner</p>
<p>they even considered it part of</p>
<p>their duties</p>
<p>to have sex with him</p>
<p>why do they do this</p>
<p>why do cult members</p>
<p>always have</p>
<p>to have sex with everybody all the girl like why</p>
<p>why do you have to do this</p>
<p>is that why people</p>
<p>start cults</p>
<p>so they could just</p>
<p>literally have sex with</p>
<p>tons of people</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>like how it seems</p>
<p>so time goes on</p>
<p>and jim knew that he needed to do bigger and better</p>
<p>things for his followers</p>
<p>and he was also now looking for somewhere</p>
<p>that he could call the promised land</p>
<p>where him and his followers could live</p>
<p>safely and freely</p>
<p>without the</p>
<p>worry of attack</p>
<p>from the fbi or the cia</p>
<p>few members went out looking for a permanent</p>
<p>missionary location</p>
<p>and in october of 1973</p>
<p>they determined that guyana</p>
<p>south america</p>
<p>would be the most</p>
<p>suitable place</p>
<p>its location was convenient</p>
<p>boats could make</p>
<p>an easy trip from miami</p>
<p>to guyana&rsquo;s capital of georgetown</p>
<p>which was a port</p>
<p>and jim wanted complete isolation for his new mission</p>
<p>and guyana was</p>
<p>perfect for that i mean they had a</p>
<p>population around 850 000</p>
<p>but most of them</p>
<p>lived along the</p>
<p>atlantic coast</p>
<p>and the majority</p>
<p>of guyana was</p>
<p>covered with</p>
<p>dense jungle</p>
<p>there were no connecting roads to the area</p>
<p>where the people&rsquo;s temple</p>
<p>would be built</p>
<p>jim told his followers that</p>
<p>the promised land</p>
<p>mission site was a place</p>
<p>where everyone</p>
<p>in the temple</p>
<p>would go to</p>
<p>avoid american</p>
<p>martial law</p>
<p>and concentration camps</p>
<p>that would be soon taking over</p>
<p>he was preaching this to his</p>
<p>church members</p>
<p>telling them that this was</p>
<p>going to happen</p>
<p>that the cia</p>
<p>and the fbi were onto them that they were</p>
<p>gonna come in with a</p>
<p>bunch of guns and kill them all like he was putting</p>
<p>fear into his followers</p>
<p>every like meeting</p>
<p>just saying something you know and</p>
<p>people were getting just</p>
<p>paranoid with him</p>
<p>finally in may of 1977</p>
<p>jonestown was open</p>
<p>and ready for the members</p>
<p>people slowly</p>
<p>started making</p>
<p>their way out there</p>
<p>they had cottages</p>
<p>set up for people to live in but</p>
<p>unfortunately there</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>for the hundreds of people that showed up</p>
<p>most of the followers all chipped in and helped</p>
<p>build more cottages the goal was to create a</p>
<p>self sustaining</p>
<p>utopia jim was in complete control over</p>
<p>everything there was no crop</p>
<p>planted no tools purchased without</p>
<p>his approval</p>
<p>if any of the followers wanted to be wrote</p>
<p>in like in a romantic relationship and be like</p>
<p>they needed to apply</p>
<p>for permission</p>
<p>first if any of the couples want to</p>
<p>break up or end</p>
<p>their relationship</p>
<p>it also had to be approved through jim as well</p>
<p>any incoming mail</p>
<p>was opened and read before</p>
<p>being passed on to the person it was addressed to</p>
<p>outgoing mail was also censored if</p>
<p>there were letters that said anything bad</p>
<p>about jonestown</p>
<p>or even just kind of</p>
<p>slightly like hey there aren&rsquo;t enough cottages</p>
<p>the letter wouldn&rsquo;t be sent</p>
<p>out and the follower whoever</p>
<p>wrote the letter</p>
<p>saying something bad</p>
<p>would be forced to rewrite</p>
<p>their letter</p>
<p>only giving glowing reviews of</p>
<p>their stay in jonestown</p>
<p>i kind of forgot to mention</p>
<p>so when jonestown</p>
<p>was first being</p>
<p>built and whatnot there were</p>
<p>church members who went out there and</p>
<p>built it it took a long time but during that time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when jim was kind of preaching</p>
<p>to his members like hey we&rsquo;re having this being built</p>
<p>start saving your</p>
<p>money we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going out there the people who wanted to go went</p>
<p>there were also a lot of members who didn&rsquo;t go they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t forced to</p>
<p>to go at all</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not trying to come off as me like</p>
<p>victim blaming at all you know like oh they went on</p>
<p>their own free will</p>
<p>no i mean they</p>
<p>heavily believed in what jim was preaching</p>
<p>but there were a lot of members who decide like i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna go but jim was like teasing it for</p>
<p>a long time</p>
<p>in the church</p>
<p>about what was</p>
<p>going on and how it was beginning</p>
<p>built and whatnot</p>
<p>so people were just getting really hyped</p>
<p>about it because they made it</p>
<p>sound like it was</p>
<p>gonna be this in amazing</p>
<p>place privacy at</p>
<p>jonestown was non existent</p>
<p>there was no privacy many of the cottages were</p>
<p>overcrowded</p>
<p>people on top of that just like kept</p>
<p>showing up to jonestown</p>
<p>but there was nowhere for them to stay</p>
<p>there was limited</p>
<p>water available</p>
<p>for showers and people were told to keep</p>
<p>their mouths closed</p>
<p>while showering because the</p>
<p>water was polluted</p>
<p>meanwhile jim over here</p>
<p>jim he had a much nicer</p>
<p>cabin you know and</p>
<p>he lived in his</p>
<p>cabin with his wife and a couple mistresses</p>
<p>they had a generator</p>
<p>for starters that</p>
<p>powered a refrigerator and some fans in his bedroom</p>
<p>and then he had some like soft</p>
<p>beds meanwhile everyone else</p>
<p>is just miserable because they don&rsquo;t have any of that</p>
<p>he also had a camp</p>
<p>radio that was set up in his room</p>
<p>it was more of like an intercom</p>
<p>system because he</p>
<p>would make like announcements</p>
<p>to the people</p>
<p>outside in the community so he didn&rsquo;t even have to</p>
<p>leave his room he</p>
<p>could talk to them</p>
<p>directly through there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably why he got fat</p>
<p>so jonestown was</p>
<p>actually being funded by his followers social security</p>
<p>checks that were coming in through the mail</p>
<p>but overall</p>
<p>money was tight</p>
<p>and the social security checks</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t enough so many of the followers</p>
<p>began manufacturing toys</p>
<p>which were cars and</p>
<p>trains but they were carved from wood</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would be sent out to georgetown</p>
<p>and sold there</p>
<p>which actually brought in some money</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to like what they needed it for</p>
<p>like more cottages</p>
<p>and proper food</p>
<p>because food was running out and peanut butter and</p>
<p>jelly sandwiches were</p>
<p>what the people were living off of</p>
<p>also beverages were</p>
<p>limited they</p>
<p>would usually drink</p>
<p>water or kool aid because it was inexpensive</p>
<p>and could easily be</p>
<p>mixed in with water</p>
<p>jim would reward his followers with a single cookie</p>
<p>on sundays i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry but like</p>
<p>thanks for the cookie</p>
<p>anyone who was a rule</p>
<p>breaker would be forced to</p>
<p>sleep and eat</p>
<p>separately from the rest of the followers</p>
<p>they were also</p>
<p>required to run</p>
<p>everywhere the people who</p>
<p>the rule breakers</p>
<p>they were required to run</p>
<p>everywhere and no one was allowed to</p>
<p>speak or even look at them</p>
<p>the jonestown</p>
<p>population grew to over 900 people</p>
<p>which is a great amount that&rsquo;s a lot of people you know</p>
<p>and all were</p>
<p>required to attend</p>
<p>nightly meetings</p>
<p>at these meetings he</p>
<p>would sometimes preach</p>
<p>but more often</p>
<p>he gave his</p>
<p>personalized accounts of recent us and</p>
<p>world news most of</p>
<p>which was made up with his imagination</p>
<p>which would</p>
<p>carry on until two or</p>
<p>three in the morning</p>
<p>his imagination</p>
<p>was keeping everyone</p>
<p>up it was drugs it was probably the drugs the people of</p>
<p>jonestown worked</p>
<p>every day until 6 pm</p>
<p>while music</p>
<p>would be playing over the loudspeakers</p>
<p>system but over time</p>
<p>jim was growing more</p>
<p>and more frustrated that</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t much progress being made within jonestown</p>
<p>and the followers were</p>
<p>becoming more unhappy with</p>
<p>their new lives because there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it was too crowded</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t enough food they were getting</p>
<p>a single cookie they were eating peanut butter and</p>
<p>obviously they&rsquo;re not happy</p>
<p>sadly though it was not easy</p>
<p>for them to leave</p>
<p>their passports were locked up</p>
<p>and if you wanted to</p>
<p>leave you had to pay pay</p>
<p>for it yourself nobody was making their own</p>
<p>money and any</p>
<p>money that was coming in was being</p>
<p>taken away by jim to fund</p>
<p>jonestown so they just felt or they</p>
<p>essentially were trapped</p>
<p>some of the followers</p>
<p>were able to</p>
<p>sneak away and escape</p>
<p>and a few others</p>
<p>could afford to</p>
<p>leave but were made to sign</p>
<p>a contract stating that they would</p>
<p>never speak</p>
<p>against the church</p>
<p>some members who were able to escape</p>
<p>did speak up</p>
<p>some spoke to the</p>
<p>media about</p>
<p>their experience and what they thought of the church</p>
<p>this would lead to more newspapers</p>
<p>covering the</p>
<p>story and speaking out</p>
<p>against the practices of jim</p>
<p>jones of course</p>
<p>jim told his followers back at</p>
<p>jonestown that</p>
<p>troops were coming</p>
<p>to take away the children and that everyone had to</p>
<p>fight because</p>
<p>an attack was coming he had gotten word that the us was</p>
<p>was looking into him</p>
<p>because people were</p>
<p>speaking up and saying like people are</p>
<p>trapped out there so yeah they</p>
<p>essentially were coming but jim</p>
<p>twisted it and</p>
<p>said that they were coming to kill them and</p>
<p>stuff his followers</p>
<p>only got news</p>
<p>from jim himself so they really had no idea what was</p>
<p>going on in the</p>
<p>media or that people were</p>
<p>speaking out</p>
<p>about jonestown</p>
<p>tons of guns were</p>
<p>then being smuggled into</p>
<p>jonestown over time</p>
<p>jim had put together a security team</p>
<p>who set up around</p>
<p>the town they were set up to protect from attacks</p>
<p>but low key</p>
<p>they were there to keep everybody in</p>
<p>the followers were</p>
<p>becoming scared</p>
<p>because the security was now threatening to hurt them</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>follow any of the rules instead of protecting</p>
<p>jonestown from the outsiders</p>
<p>they were attacking</p>
<p>their own people</p>
<p>if people try to get out of</p>
<p>jonestown this security</p>
<p>would shoot them</p>
<p>in february</p>
<p>of 1978 jim called all the people in to gather for</p>
<p>an emergency meeting</p>
<p>where he told the people that</p>
<p>soldiers were coming to attack</p>
<p>jonestown that the cia was on to them</p>
<p>and that they</p>
<p>would attack in a matter of hours</p>
<p>their intention was</p>
<p>to kill all of the followers</p>
<p>living in jonestown including the children</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you get them</p>
<p>the children know</p>
<p>jim told them</p>
<p>rather than they be killed at the hands of</p>
<p>these monsters</p>
<p>that they must take</p>
<p>their own lives instead</p>
<p>that by doing this</p>
<p>it would rob</p>
<p>their enemies of any triumph</p>
<p>some of the</p>
<p>followers agreed that this was the best idea</p>
<p>but others who were just worn out with all the bs</p>
<p>just wanted to leave</p>
<p>large containers were brought</p>
<p>out and they were filled with like this</p>
<p>weird dark liquid</p>
<p>everyone was told to line up fill a cup</p>
<p>and drink this</p>
<p>drink mixture</p>
<p>would kill them in</p>
<p>about 40 minutes</p>
<p>jim was preaching</p>
<p>while the followers were forced to</p>
<p>drink the poison</p>
<p>and told them</p>
<p>their deaths</p>
<p>would be peaceful</p>
<p>whenever one had swallowed</p>
<p>swallowed their drinks</p>
<p>jim told them</p>
<p>quote you didn&rsquo;t take anything end</p>
<p>quote and that it was all a test to see if they were</p>
<p>truly willing to die for the cause</p>
<p>as a reward the</p>
<p>loyal followers</p>
<p>were off for the rest of the day</p>
<p>it was said that nobody</p>
<p>stood up or got</p>
<p>upset with jim for this and that</p>
<p>the true believers</p>
<p>accepted what jim had done so it was just a test</p>
<p>lol this was the moment</p>
<p>jim knew he had complete control over his people</p>
<p>he really wanted to test them and</p>
<p>he did it the fact that</p>
<p>they were willing to die just because he told them to</p>
<p>he was like fuck</p>
<p>yeah so i&rsquo;m sure i don&rsquo;t know because</p>
<p>again i wasn&rsquo;t there but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure that really just</p>
<p>boosted his ego</p>
<p>to say the least</p>
<p>during all of this jim was</p>
<p>still doing drugs</p>
<p>and was becoming more</p>
<p>and more paranoid</p>
<p>because back in the us parents of people living in</p>
<p>jonestown were concerned by strange</p>
<p>letters they were receiving</p>
<p>or the fact that they had received no letters at all</p>
<p>many people went to authorities</p>
<p>and pressed them</p>
<p>to investigate</p>
<p>jonestown please get my sons there my</p>
<p>daughters are</p>
<p>like please look into this in november of 1978 us</p>
<p>congressman leo ryan</p>
<p>he traveled</p>
<p>to guyana to inspect the people&rsquo;s temples</p>
<p>activities and</p>
<p>the jonestown</p>
<p>compound itself he was investigating</p>
<p>rumors that some members of the cult were being held</p>
<p>against their will</p>
<p>and were being subjected</p>
<p>to physical and</p>
<p>psychological abuse</p>
<p>leo arrived</p>
<p>to jonestown on november 17th</p>
<p>and planned to return home that following day</p>
<p>when he went into</p>
<p>jonestown they</p>
<p>all were on</p>
<p>their best behavior</p>
<p>a mirror to try and impress him make sure</p>
<p>this congressman had nothing but good</p>
<p>things to say</p>
<p>about jonestown</p>
<p>and at the end of the day leo</p>
<p>was done and was</p>
<p>going to hop in his truck</p>
<p>drive out to a</p>
<p>small plane nearby</p>
<p>and then head back to the us</p>
<p>while he was leaving walking</p>
<p>to his car there were several temple members who</p>
<p>asked if they</p>
<p>could get a ride</p>
<p>with him because they wanted to</p>
<p>leave and he agreed</p>
<p>so they jumped into his car</p>
<p>and headed back to</p>
<p>where the airplane was so they</p>
<p>could go back to the us now</p>
<p>the security</p>
<p>who was there protecting jonestown</p>
<p>saw that this was happening</p>
<p>and because they were</p>
<p>trained or brainwashed</p>
<p>or just bad people</p>
<p>they believed that</p>
<p>these members were being taken</p>
<p>you know that jim was</p>
<p>right like oh my god the cia</p>
<p>guy did come and like take</p>
<p>these people or whatever and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be murdered</p>
<p>so instead the security</p>
<p>ended up shooting at the</p>
<p>truck to try and prevent them from taking</p>
<p>taking the followers</p>
<p>and just trying</p>
<p>to get them to stop luckily the people in the</p>
<p>truck were able to</p>
<p>drive off unhurt but now there was like this</p>
<p>sense of urgency to get the fuck out of there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re shooting at us we</p>
<p>gotta go like</p>
<p>we gotta go</p>
<p>so they get to the air strip</p>
<p>about to hop on to this</p>
<p>small plane but sadly</p>
<p>some of the followers</p>
<p>security showed up</p>
<p>at the air strip with</p>
<p>their weapons tons of guns</p>
<p>they shot and attacked the</p>
<p>the people who were trying to</p>
<p>leave and they</p>
<p>ended up killing five people</p>
<p>including the congressman and</p>
<p>three other members</p>
<p>of the press who were with him</p>
<p>and 11 people were wounded</p>
<p>at around 4 pm jim</p>
<p>spoke over the</p>
<p>camp loudspeaker to his followers announcing</p>
<p>a meeting in the pavilion</p>
<p>inside the people&rsquo;s temple they</p>
<p>recorded almost</p>
<p>of jim&rsquo;s sermons</p>
<p>and any meetings they had which</p>
<p>they had hundreds of thousands of tapes oh my gosh but</p>
<p>sadly that means that they taped</p>
<p>their last and</p>
<p>final meeting</p>
<p>jim told the people that</p>
<p>he tried to give them the best life and that</p>
<p>one of the people on the</p>
<p>plane was going to</p>
<p>shoot the plane</p>
<p>pilot and it</p>
<p>would be blamed on the people of</p>
<p>jonestown and it</p>
<p>would soon bring</p>
<p>their enemies into town</p>
<p>the people had no idea</p>
<p>about what happened at the airstrip jim knew</p>
<p>because the security team came back and told him</p>
<p>but he spinned it and made it</p>
<p>sound you know</p>
<p>one person was hurt</p>
<p>one jim told the people that he had a solution</p>
<p>that he would</p>
<p>spare the children</p>
<p>from enslavement and the</p>
<p>seniors from</p>
<p>slaughter jim said that it was time for them to</p>
<p>drink the potion</p>
<p>that they were not committing suicide</p>
<p>but that it was a revolutionary act</p>
<p>many of the members refused</p>
<p>to move or beg to be let go they didn&rsquo;t want to like</p>
<p>drink this poison</p>
<p>a few people in the poison line</p>
<p>thanked jim</p>
<p>for all that he&rsquo;d done for them all of the followers</p>
<p>drink the poisoned</p>
<p>flavor aid mix</p>
<p>all of this was captured on the tape recording as well</p>
<p>you can listen</p>
<p>to it but i&rsquo;m just giving you a little disclaimer it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna ruin your day it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna ruin your week it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna ruin your month it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>horrifying it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awful and i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recommend it but i know there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>about curious cats out there</p>
<p>who are but just know</p>
<p>just know it&rsquo;s horrible it&rsquo;s just oh</p>
<p>so the next day the guyana defense</p>
<p>force troops went into</p>
<p>jonestown and</p>
<p>found a horrific</p>
<p>scene there were</p>
<p>bodies everywhere</p>
<p>some of them had markings</p>
<p>where the poison was injected</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed that</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>who had these injection</p>
<p>marks refused</p>
<p>to drink the poison</p>
<p>and were held down</p>
<p>and instead it was injected into</p>
<p>their bodies</p>
<p>oh my gosh they</p>
<p>found jim&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>sprawled out on</p>
<p>stage in the pavilion</p>
<p>jim and one of his mistresses</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the only ones who died from a gunshot</p>
<p>wound to the head</p>
<p>rather than the poison</p>
<p>i guess jim just wanted to get it over with</p>
<p>dick originally the</p>
<p>local guyanese</p>
<p>government had reported</p>
<p>about 383 deaths</p>
<p>and word had got back to the us</p>
<p>where the media was</p>
<p>covering the</p>
<p>story so soon</p>
<p>after that american</p>
<p>troops went out to</p>
<p>jonestown to investigate</p>
<p>soon more and more</p>
<p>bodies were</p>
<p>found and away</p>
<p>week after the</p>
<p>tragic event the death</p>
<p>total came to</p>
<p>nine hundred</p>
<p>and nine deaths nine</p>
<p>hundred nine nine</p>
<p>hundred nine that&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>this is a side note</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>heard about</p>
<p>jonestown i mean i don&rsquo;t know how old i was or</p>
<p>whatever but</p>
<p>in my mind when i</p>
<p>think of a cult i</p>
<p>think like mmm</p>
<p>five to 10 people you know like</p>
<p>which is still sad it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still awful</p>
<p>but 909 people that&rsquo;s a fucking lot he</p>
<p>wow wow you know like that&rsquo;s insane i just i</p>
<p>still can&rsquo;t wrap my head around it it&rsquo;s just in</p>
<p>same investigators ended up</p>
<p>searching the compound and over 60 000</p>
<p>printed pages plus several</p>
<p>hundred tape recordings were</p>
<p>taken and the fbi</p>
<p>spent hours</p>
<p>about hours</p>
<p>going through it all</p>
<p>also in jim&rsquo;s cottage they</p>
<p>found around 700 000</p>
<p>in suitcases</p>
<p>what were you doing with it</p>
<p>also he had a</p>
<p>bunch of different bank accounts which had</p>
<p>money in it like this guy had millions of dollars</p>
<p>no idea what his plan was</p>
<p>obviously he wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>spending it on</p>
<p>jonestown months</p>
<p>were spent trying to</p>
<p>identify the</p>
<p>victims some</p>
<p>were identified through</p>
<p>fingerprints</p>
<p>and if they got lucky</p>
<p>dental records</p>
<p>but most of the</p>
<p>victims hadn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>to a dentist in years</p>
<p>many of them were too badly decomposed to identify</p>
<p>even though it had only been</p>
<p>about a week</p>
<p>but the heat and</p>
<p>humidity had decomposed the</p>
<p>bodies at a</p>
<p>rapid rate sadly</p>
<p>409 bodies were</p>
<p>never identified</p>
<p>the evergreen cemetery</p>
<p>in oakland california</p>
<p>offered ground for a mass</p>
<p>grave where</p>
<p>the 409 people were laid to rest</p>
<p>on may 11 1979 all of jim</p>
<p>jones churches were seized</p>
<p>and closed down</p>
<p>as well as the many</p>
<p>many bank accounts he had hiding over</p>
<p>seven million dollars</p>
<p>all the money was seized</p>
<p>by the government</p>
<p>and was used to repay</p>
<p>the victims families</p>
<p>the events at</p>
<p>jonestown constituted the</p>
<p>greatest single loss of american</p>
<p>civilian life in a deliberate act</p>
<p>until the tragic</p>
<p>incidents of 9 11</p>
<p>many of the family members</p>
<p>of the victims</p>
<p>tried to sue and</p>
<p>tried to get</p>
<p>money from jonestown</p>
<p>estate and whatnot</p>
<p>and also they were trying to sue</p>
<p>because they were trying to get help</p>
<p>from the government</p>
<p>to search his</p>
<p>place in the</p>
<p>first place and nobody did so</p>
<p>there were a lot of lawsuits to follow</p>
<p>and also there</p>
<p>were a lot of different members of the church</p>
<p>who were being sued there&rsquo;s a lot more</p>
<p>to it as well than just this but for the most part</p>
<p>that is awful horrifying</p>
<p>tragic story</p>
<p>about jonestown</p>
<p>jim jones i don&rsquo;t know what the</p>
<p>fuck happened to him because he</p>
<p>started off so good i don&rsquo;t know what i think it</p>
<p>i think it was the drugs i</p>
<p>think money</p>
<p>and drugs just completely</p>
<p>derailed him</p>
<p>money and drugs tend to do this to a lot of people</p>
<p>money for sure does this to people</p>
<p>i was reading a biography</p>
<p>about jim jones</p>
<p>and truly it</p>
<p>sounded like he</p>
<p>started off as an amazing</p>
<p>person with a</p>
<p>great goal in life to really help and</p>
<p>serve people</p>
<p>and then it seems</p>
<p>maybe when when</p>
<p>the drugs drugs</p>
<p>the drugs and the money is</p>
<p>where he went off</p>
<p>track but it&rsquo;s just like i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>what happened greed</p>
<p>money and drugs i</p>
<p>guess i guess that&rsquo;s the answer</p>
<p>i just can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>those things can</p>
<p>truly make somebody do this</p>
<p>i appreciate you guys so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today i hope you have a</p>
<p>wonderful rest of your day you make good choices please</p>
<p>make good choices i&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
