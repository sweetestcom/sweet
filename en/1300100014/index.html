    <p>morning start the broadcast</p>
<p>shazam you gotten really good at this job</p>
<p>fucking on my goddamn wizard this shit now son</p>
<p>i know exactly</p>
<p>how to do it i get that shit up and running</p>
<p>very great ladies and gentlemen welcome to</p>
<p>this has got to be like our 12th real podcast</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>like that i can&rsquo;t believe i&rsquo;ve kept it up this long</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all because you fuckers</p>
<p>cause it was</p>
<p>and you haha</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome here we go</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all because you people</p>
<p>positive energy</p>
<p>that i get from you guys and all the</p>
<p>all the people that i run into on the road</p>
<p>that say they love the podcast</p>
<p>keeps you doing it so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna keep doing it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fun as fuck</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on itunes now you can get it on itunes i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just joe</p>
<p>roman podcast that what it is yeah</p>
<p>yeah the one that has the most ones</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>other ones that</p>
<p>other people have created</p>
<p>but this is the real</p>
<p>one there&rsquo;s also people that have noticed that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken straight up bits and put it</p>
<p>on itunes and put</p>
<p>underneath the podcast name</p>
<p>you might want to get on</p>
<p>you know my attitude</p>
<p>about the internet is always that the internet</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t put any energy into trying to take your shit down</p>
<p>because especially as a comedian</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inconvenient sometimes like i go</p>
<p>places and people</p>
<p>have already seen bits that aren&rsquo;t out on anything yet</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve seen it because somebody youtube did</p>
<p>and then you know stanhope has a</p>
<p>whole bit about</p>
<p>you know how</p>
<p>people will put your shit on youtube when it&rsquo;s not done</p>
<p>and the way stanhope works</p>
<p>and the way i work we both work real similar in that</p>
<p>we have an idea and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never like totally done you keep adding to it and</p>
<p>tweaking it</p>
<p>and then when you put it on a recording at</p>
<p>least there it&rsquo;s kinda done</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>often times like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll put something on a recording and then like a week</p>
<p>afterwards or two weeks or even a</p>
<p>month later</p>
<p>i have a better tagline so before the</p>
<p>before the things even on</p>
<p>television i have like a new better way to do it</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>somebody once said to me that you got to look at</p>
<p>stand up comedy as like</p>
<p>every performance is just</p>
<p>they they&rsquo;re just capturing a moment in time</p>
<p>which is true</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve got some good</p>
<p>stuff out there but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not true if you don&rsquo;t have anything good out there</p>
<p>so if you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>until like shiny</p>
<p>happy jihad i was not</p>
<p>happy with any of my stuff</p>
<p>i would do it and i was like oh so</p>
<p>like when i did that 2005</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s just called joe rogan live</p>
<p>the one is out of print</p>
<p>we know the one that was from netflix</p>
<p>the one that was from netflix</p>
<p>that we did in phoenix</p>
<p>when i was doing that i was doing the man show ufc</p>
<p>comedy and fear</p>
<p>factor at the same time i was doing all of them at once</p>
<p>and i was frazzled</p>
<p>and it was just like</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t my best performance</p>
<p>like i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like when i when i look at it i say i</p>
<p>think that i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>tense i&rsquo;m not like</p>
<p>enjoying myself</p>
<p>so i think you know</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s that one</p>
<p>i consider like that&rsquo;s a moment of time like that at</p>
<p>least it was better than the</p>
<p>stuff that i had before</p>
<p>you know my</p>
<p>first cd i liked some of the bits but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like my delivery was kind of fucked up back then</p>
<p>but now i looked at it</p>
<p>you know i look at the</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s out now it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>every now and then someone can like</p>
<p>videotape something like before</p>
<p>wait before it becomes anything</p>
<p>you know like you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>videotape me just talking shit on stage</p>
<p>and then you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll become</p>
<p>a bit somewhere down the line but</p>
<p>you know by</p>
<p>the time someone if i go to a show somewhere</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re a fan they download my shit they</p>
<p>might have already seen the premise</p>
<p>you know i mean it</p>
<p>might like not be as fun for them you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you could look at it</p>
<p>that it hurts you but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it does i</p>
<p>think having</p>
<p>stuff out on the internet that people</p>
<p>enjoy is always good</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the big problem though</p>
<p>with everything like now like tv shows though</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like hulu and</p>
<p>stuff like that but you have to find out how to</p>
<p>they want to</p>
<p>share it they want to do that</p>
<p>concept but they also need to make a profit from it</p>
<p>which is kind of interesting how they have to go</p>
<p>about doing it</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re experiencing a whole new</p>
<p>model and i think</p>
<p>your attitude</p>
<p>about how your fans</p>
<p>get your stuff is very important</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>because it represents how you feel like as a performer</p>
<p>and like what you</p>
<p>feel the relationship that you have with the audiences</p>
<p>you know and if i was like this</p>
<p>greedy dude that was like you know fuck them they</p>
<p>gotta fucking pay i want my fucking money</p>
<p>like if you really if you really</p>
<p>think like that like</p>
<p>these people are just like you and</p>
<p>be fucking honest man if you were eighteen years old</p>
<p>and you were</p>
<p>broke you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking download shit you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna do it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re not a fan</p>
<p>i mean sometimes you</p>
<p>broke you know</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>is if you have</p>
<p>people you know i</p>
<p>think if you have a certain attitude</p>
<p>about like what you do</p>
<p>and that attitude is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just trying to create things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to make</p>
<p>money off of it</p>
<p>but really trying to create</p>
<p>things that people are gonna</p>
<p>enjoy like that&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s not the making</p>
<p>money thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the money will come if you work and if people</p>
<p>enjoy your work</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna support you</p>
<p>people are gonna come to see your shows</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna buy dvds if they have the</p>
<p>money they have the</p>
<p>money like if i like there&rsquo;s a band that i really like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll download</p>
<p>their shit online like on itunes</p>
<p>then i&rsquo;ll buy a cd two to play in my car</p>
<p>just cause i</p>
<p>wanna support them just</p>
<p>gotta really enjoy them</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t need i</p>
<p>could hook my ipod up to my car but</p>
<p>i will i will</p>
<p>pen spend that</p>
<p>money because i</p>
<p>wanna support them i wanna</p>
<p>any movie that&rsquo;s good even if i&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>watch the dvd i buy it</p>
<p>i always buy it if i</p>
<p>enjoy it in the</p>
<p>movie theater i buy it</p>
<p>and i feel like i&rsquo;m supporting artists when i do that</p>
<p>and i feel like that&rsquo;s what people are</p>
<p>gonna do too</p>
<p>that the internet is a</p>
<p>crazy new thing man</p>
<p>you know and i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get to this weird</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>see right now it&rsquo;s just information</p>
<p>you know right now the ability</p>
<p>to send information is pretty</p>
<p>profound and like how our</p>
<p>world has changed</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s only information</p>
<p>right now eventually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be more than information</p>
<p>when they come up with</p>
<p>i was talking to cliffy b</p>
<p>my friend cliffy</p>
<p>b from epic games he&rsquo;s the coolest yeah</p>
<p>cliffy b is the dude</p>
<p>who he&rsquo;s like the main man behind gears of war</p>
<p>the whole series them the unreal games</p>
<p>super super cool dude</p>
<p>like a really fun guy and he came to my comedy show</p>
<p>and then he came to the ufc</p>
<p>afterwards and then we even hung out he came to the</p>
<p>after party</p>
<p>and we were talking he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>super cool guy</p>
<p>and we were talking about</p>
<p>the ability eventually of making</p>
<p>printers that can</p>
<p>print up things</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s like really what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen eventually that&rsquo;s already kind of real</p>
<p>yeah have printers that can</p>
<p>make 3d 3d yeah</p>
<p>they can make some he was talking about 3d</p>
<p>models that they can make with these</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get to a</p>
<p>point and it&rsquo;s not that far off</p>
<p>where you like say if your</p>
<p>mouse breaks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to go to this</p>
<p>computer printer</p>
<p>thing and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to</p>
<p>put in the combinations</p>
<p>or whatever the fuck you have to say</p>
<p>to get a mouse or download a</p>
<p>mouse program</p>
<p>and a mouse is</p>
<p>gonna fucking appear</p>
<p>i mean you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>gonna be able to make</p>
<p>things with a printer</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>remember the</p>
<p>first printers</p>
<p>that were old and clumsy and fucked up and slow</p>
<p>you know and the</p>
<p>ink wasn&rsquo;t good</p>
<p>i have this new epson</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like 100</p>
<p>bucks or something</p>
<p>maybe 150 bucks</p>
<p>the fucking</p>
<p>thing is like lightning</p>
<p>pages just fly on wi</p>
<p>fi you can print oh</p>
<p>yeah you can</p>
<p>print it from the road</p>
<p>call it up i mean it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s programs</p>
<p>that you can you can get on your goddamn iphone</p>
<p>where you could</p>
<p>print shit up from your computer</p>
<p>at old apartment shows somebody had a wireless printer</p>
<p>and they just had it open</p>
<p>so i would sit there and find the biggest goatsy</p>
<p>photo or dick with herpes</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll throw it and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>print it on the printer</p>
<p>non stop sometimes</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be like 50 pages</p>
<p>and it never went</p>
<p>away and it was like</p>
<p>printing successful</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s awesome and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny how much</p>
<p>that happens you</p>
<p>could pretty much go through any</p>
<p>neighborhood and get on somebody&rsquo;s printer and do that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fun just take</p>
<p>your laptop</p>
<p>get your palm</p>
<p>3 plus hot spot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hilarious you</p>
<p>could wreck some</p>
<p>marriages like that</p>
<p>if you knew a dude who had a printer</p>
<p>like that you</p>
<p>could send him</p>
<p>doctored up</p>
<p>photoshop pictures of him blowing dudes or yeah</p>
<p>yeah you could you could start</p>
<p>photoshop him to</p>
<p>gain position and make</p>
<p>like marriages</p>
<p>yeah man you know that&rsquo;s the golden rule that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other golden rule</p>
<p>about the internet</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>picture of you on the internet someone someone</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re photoshopped a dick in your mouth</p>
<p>for sure not a dick many dicks many dicks</p>
<p>broken for sure if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>photo of you there&rsquo;s a dick in your</p>
<p>mouth it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>on your butt there&rsquo;s dicks all around you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many dicks of me</p>
<p>pictures with dicks online</p>
<p>just this one guy flappo</p>
<p>has done like a thousand of them</p>
<p>right you know it&rsquo;s always me and just dicks</p>
<p>everywhere just</p>
<p>all over the place</p>
<p>oh have you ever seen how dildos are made and like</p>
<p>assholes you know we</p>
<p>could buy like a girl&rsquo;s ass yeah</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t seen how they&rsquo;re made but i&rsquo;ve seen them</p>
<p>you fucking</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s supposed to be a girl&rsquo;s butt dude</p>
<p>they have people that sit there</p>
<p>and paint veins</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just veins like</p>
<p>these mexican ladies</p>
<p>and they first they</p>
<p>wipe this coat and they sit there and they have to</p>
<p>stroke it for like</p>
<p>an hour and that does</p>
<p>under veins so it looks like the skin</p>
<p>underneath the veins</p>
<p>underneath the skin</p>
<p>then they have a</p>
<p>second they let that dry</p>
<p>then they have this person that just the purple ones</p>
<p>the significant</p>
<p>veins like the ones that have the main</p>
<p>blood flow to</p>
<p>the tip of the dick kind of veins oh my god and</p>
<p>it is the most</p>
<p>creepiest thing if you look there and you feel like</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s getting murdered and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching it but it&rsquo;s just people making dildos</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s and then</p>
<p>when they caster it&rsquo;s so true though it is like</p>
<p>what is it why does it</p>
<p>creep us out so much to see like</p>
<p>bodies like the idea of body i don&rsquo;t know because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible it&rsquo;s like body parts and stuff yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrifying to people</p>
<p>and then when</p>
<p>they make a cast like if they have fucking</p>
<p>ron jeremy come in there and they&rsquo;re like all</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do a chubby dildo this week</p>
<p>they had to put</p>
<p>his dick in like this tube</p>
<p>almost like when you ever see a</p>
<p>horse they&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>sperm from a</p>
<p>horse to make</p>
<p>babies or something like that</p>
<p>they have to like jack it off into this tube</p>
<p>and they had the same thing with</p>
<p>how they have to sit there with this plaster</p>
<p>and he can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>touch it and</p>
<p>he has to stay hard for five minutes he can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t stay hard</p>
<p>he has to have his girl</p>
<p>or another like a porn star girl</p>
<p>just sit there and</p>
<p>whisper like i want your butthole</p>
<p>oh your balls your balls</p>
<p>and do it for five minutes you are the</p>
<p>least sexy chick ever</p>
<p>what you just did</p>
<p>right there and i did</p>
<p>the least sexy</p>
<p>imitation of a</p>
<p>chick in history</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t care if i was in jail for a year i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t fuck you it was</p>
<p>like a bruno point</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy and then with the cast</p>
<p>they just have to like put plaster</p>
<p>in your fucking vagina</p>
<p>and just fucking</p>
<p>sit there for five minutes and they pull out this</p>
<p>thing and and then they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t just play</p>
<p>paste hair on it</p>
<p>they actually have to sew with a thread and needle</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>hair on the</p>
<p>pussy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous yes go to a dildo factory i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s one in</p>
<p>studio city</p>
<p>you got to take a trip there with a camera or something</p>
<p>yeah you think they</p>
<p>would let you</p>
<p>they did it for hbo</p>
<p>six years ago yeah but it&rsquo;s hbo</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just a comedian</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if they</p>
<p>would do it just for a regular dude</p>
<p>unless they were like</p>
<p>ufc fans dude</p>
<p>ufc but they do you</p>
<p>think they would want to like show people if you let</p>
<p>them i mean if</p>
<p>would you let</p>
<p>the basic no you</p>
<p>would never do that paid</p>
<p>you a hundred thousand</p>
<p>dollars i&rsquo;m not getting a boner in</p>
<p>front of any dude no no no</p>
<p>all the scientists are the shut the fuck up</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>weird though because that&rsquo;s what was</p>
<p>after in this</p>
<p>video i saw</p>
<p>that the porn star that did it</p>
<p>that just there was a box of his dicks and</p>
<p>he comes up and that&rsquo;s hilarious that&rsquo;s my dick times</p>
<p>500 that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>crazy what a</p>
<p>great idea though</p>
<p>yeah you know because people are such</p>
<p>freaks they</p>
<p>watch someone fuck in a</p>
<p>video and they want to be like that person yeah</p>
<p>yeah so weird</p>
<p>i want to get one just to see what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah they have ones now oh i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>crazy huh yeah</p>
<p>what kind of a human being</p>
<p>thought that up the first guy a really</p>
<p>horny priest</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just get someone</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>an exact mold of their body so we can fuck it yeah</p>
<p>how crazy is it this this new thing</p>
<p>about the the priests you know what&rsquo;s happening yeah</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>equating there them being persecuted for kid fucking</p>
<p>yeah to the the holocaust and and the pope</p>
<p>say gonna save them all</p>
<p>this what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>the south park was talking about that what is going on</p>
<p>like how crazy is the the catholic religion the fact</p>
<p>the fact that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still around is mind boggling</p>
<p>but the fact that anybody takes them seriously</p>
<p>these are all these fucking kids getting molested like</p>
<p>how many kids</p>
<p>have to get molested before someone steps in and goes</p>
<p>oh maybe these guys aren&rsquo;t directly tied to god like</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ve been fooled right</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just amazing that a cult</p>
<p>can have so much</p>
<p>power in 2010</p>
<p>and that nobody wants to call it a cult and everybody</p>
<p>wants to pretend that there&rsquo;s something sacred</p>
<p>about it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been around forever</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s the craziest</p>
<p>most fucked up idea ever</p>
<p>there was a big discussion</p>
<p>about it on our message</p>
<p>board and one of the most interesting</p>
<p>arguments was</p>
<p>so people were saying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re discounting</p>
<p>all the positive work that the catholic church does</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>anything positive they do will they do charities or</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s them doing</p>
<p>things outside of religion that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the fucking religion</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s just people doing charitable things</p>
<p>that does not make up for kid fucking</p>
<p>that does not make up for</p>
<p>living a life filled with</p>
<p>guilt so that they can control you</p>
<p>and keeping you down like a little</p>
<p>bitch terrified</p>
<p>about every fucking</p>
<p>thing you do</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna burn in hell</p>
<p>and anybody who&rsquo;s ever been to catholic</p>
<p>school knows that</p>
<p>yeah i did a year in catholic school man</p>
<p>and it was like i did a year in jail</p>
<p>my first grade</p>
<p>first grade i went to catholic school</p>
<p>our lady of</p>
<p>chester hova</p>
<p>in in new jersey</p>
<p>and this fucking</p>
<p>cunt none sister</p>
<p>married josephine i was</p>
<p>like a pretty</p>
<p>happy kid before this happened</p>
<p>you know my parents had</p>
<p>just broken up and the impact of it hadn&rsquo;t hit me yet</p>
<p>you know but i was i was</p>
<p>still in denial</p>
<p>you know but i</p>
<p>would see my dad</p>
<p>still because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still in new jersey</p>
<p>and then while this was</p>
<p>going on i went to catholic</p>
<p>school for a year and it was</p>
<p>horrifying it was brutal dude this nun</p>
<p>was such a fucking cunt</p>
<p>everything everything you did</p>
<p>she would just be on you</p>
<p>she would tell you she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make you sit on a nail in the</p>
<p>closet you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to stay overnight</p>
<p>and she was just this haggard old</p>
<p>bitch that nobody loved</p>
<p>nobody had fun with her</p>
<p>nobody told jokes to her</p>
<p>she never danced she</p>
<p>never supposedly</p>
<p>never fucked</p>
<p>you know she wasn&rsquo;t allowed to do shit</p>
<p>she was just the worst</p>
<p>representation of an elderly</p>
<p>woman possible</p>
<p>the best would be a</p>
<p>woman who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lived a life of joy</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>super friendly to everybody because she feels so</p>
<p>blessed that she made it through this</p>
<p>greater wise</p>
<p>and very wise yeah</p>
<p>this mean fucking cunt</p>
<p>she used to hit us she really used to hit us like</p>
<p>people think like catholic</p>
<p>school teachers don&rsquo;t hit you with</p>
<p>rulers no they fucking hit you with rulers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real shit they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>smack you in the head</p>
<p>it was brutal i was</p>
<p>every day was terrifying</p>
<p>but i got awesome</p>
<p>grades isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>crazy like right</p>
<p>after that i fell off</p>
<p>school hardcore after that</p>
<p>i was in like gifted</p>
<p>classes and</p>
<p>everything the next year</p>
<p>after that catholic</p>
<p>school and then i totally stopped trying damn i was</p>
<p>sleeping i just</p>
<p>i stayed up all</p>
<p>night and just</p>
<p>slept when you&rsquo;re in a catholic</p>
<p>school you&rsquo;re so terrified you will push</p>
<p>everything you do you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna have a fucking</p>
<p>see you don&rsquo;t have a beat they will yell at you</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>monsters man</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that</p>
<p>whole idea as a</p>
<p>philosophy is the</p>
<p>worst idea possible</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>the control of your consciousness</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting your</p>
<p>trust in the wisdom</p>
<p>of someone who lives in a cult</p>
<p>of kid fuckers</p>
<p>really i mean look at that so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on a bunch of guys</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t allowed to fuck women</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s real natural</p>
<p>what what you&rsquo;re not allowed to have sex</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even get a better</p>
<p>place in heaven</p>
<p>when they go to heaven they just</p>
<p>get regular heaven just like you if you listen to them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ridiculous it&rsquo;s the dumbest fucking idea ever</p>
<p>the dumbest fucking idea ever</p>
<p>and we have to pretend</p>
<p>unlike cnn and shit</p>
<p>that this is like a real</p>
<p>issue of debate</p>
<p>you know and though there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>abuse in the catholic church but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never like why the fuck do we</p>
<p>still have the catholic church</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s never nobody ever steps in and goes really</p>
<p>really all this</p>
<p>these fucking guys in</p>
<p>their robes</p>
<p>and they fuck kids</p>
<p>and they live in</p>
<p>these crazy</p>
<p>places together all men</p>
<p>really and the nuns are all evil</p>
<p>and they all look haggard</p>
<p>and beaten down</p>
<p>oh a few of them do some charity work</p>
<p>they do some good things too</p>
<p>they donate some of the millions of dollars that</p>
<p>trick people into giving them</p>
<p>they donate some of that and they do some good things</p>
<p>but yet you</p>
<p>never really hear</p>
<p>about this shit like the amish religion</p>
<p>by the way that</p>
<p>catholicism is one of the</p>
<p>worst ever it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>catholics were controlling the</p>
<p>world we&rsquo;d be fucked you mean everybody wants to</p>
<p>fight off the</p>
<p>muslims at least the</p>
<p>muslims like the</p>
<p>other muslims</p>
<p>muslims like each</p>
<p>other catholics don&rsquo;t even like each other</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking controlling you with death</p>
<p>you know dude that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy religion</p>
<p>i guess muslims look</p>
<p>if you believe in like you know the hardcore</p>
<p>jihadists i</p>
<p>guess they do too</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s pretty similar</p>
<p>you know cat</p>
<p>catholics is the only</p>
<p>thing that has over</p>
<p>over the the</p>
<p>muslims as you don&rsquo;t hear about</p>
<p>catholic suicide</p>
<p>bombers as much</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more rare</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened though</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s been catholic suicide bombers</p>
<p>right totally but</p>
<p>you never see a buddhist cocksucker</p>
<p>you know you never</p>
<p>like buddhist</p>

<p>never gonna be scared to be in like a tent</p>
<p>in the middle of a woods with a buddhist guy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s gonna fucking rape you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna think yeah</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s gonna protect me from a real</p>
<p>but a real buddhist</p>
<p>that people will</p>
<p>argue that a real catholic</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t fuck kids too</p>
<p>you know and which is</p>
<p>about that i think</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s just a former</p>
<p>retards that like to be around each</p>
<p>other and fucking i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what you know and people say hey you guys talk</p>
<p>about the subject of religion</p>
<p>a lot like it comes up a lot</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>yeah what&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>wars about what the fuck</p>
<p>look it&rsquo;s programming</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s really all it is</p>
<p>no one knows any more</p>
<p>about what life is all</p>
<p>about than you do</p>
<p>i mean we have wisdom</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve learned things</p>
<p>all of us have had different life</p>
<p>experiences that we&rsquo;ve benefited from we try to express</p>
<p>these to each other and</p>
<p>we can all get a little</p>
<p>smarter in the process</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>the reality is nobody really knows what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on nobody knows</p>
<p>where this is</p>
<p>going nobody has any idea what this is</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>itself if this if we didn&rsquo;t live this life</p>
<p>this life would be</p>
<p>the craziest drug trip ever</p>
<p>okay if you had some sort of a logical two</p>
<p>dimensional life like a binary life like something you</p>
<p>could read out on a piece of</p>
<p>paper if that was life</p>
<p>and that life was</p>
<p>introduced to this life</p>
<p>right here you</p>
<p>would go this life is</p>
<p>psychedelic this is insanity</p>
<p>though everything is insane</p>
<p>and it gets more</p>
<p>ridiculous by the minute</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be fucking cnn headline news and they&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>you know an episode on is kim</p>
<p>kardashian&rsquo;s ass too fat</p>
<p>i mean they</p>
<p>literally will do that i mean you know this is</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re at this</p>
<p>tiger wood shit and this jesse</p>
<p>james shit and</p>
<p>all this crazy</p>
<p>stuff where we&rsquo;re concentrating on</p>
<p>on nonsense</p>
<p>you know i mean we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so much more concerned with dancing with the stars</p>
<p>than we are with the</p>
<p>fact that we&rsquo;re in the middle of two fucking wars it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy we have too much info</p>
<p>about demi moore</p>
<p>we have too much info</p>
<p>about these</p>
<p>kardashian people that</p>
<p>would normally not know</p>
<p>about unless we rode a</p>
<p>horse in the town and somebody told us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fascinating man it&rsquo;s so fascinating</p>
<p>you know isn&rsquo;t it i mean we are the</p>
<p>weirdest animal ever</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t if people didn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>and you made them up</p>
<p>it would be too much</p>
<p>it would be</p>
<p>this is ridiculous they can&rsquo;t be that fucked up like</p>
<p>that fucked up and they figured out nuclear weapons</p>
<p>that fucked up and they can fly through the air to</p>
<p>all parts of the planet there that fucked up god damn</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really having a conversation with the pope</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s a fucking cult leader like</p>
<p>why are you sitting down with that this is ridiculous</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like yeah well you have to play</p>
<p>along with them no you don&rsquo;t have to play</p>
<p>along with them because playing</p>
<p>along with them</p>
<p>is a concession</p>
<p>that what they&rsquo;re saying is</p>
<p>legitimate like that</p>
<p>they really represent</p>
<p>something meaningful it&rsquo;s nonsense the</p>
<p>individuals inside that organization</p>
<p>they represent something meaningful they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>individuals they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>trapped in this web</p>
<p>of ideology they&rsquo;re trapped</p>
<p>in this thing</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m a catholic i was born catholic</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a di catholic like what the you&rsquo;re a fucking human</p>
<p>why are you lumping yourself in voluntarily</p>
<p>with this gigantic</p>
<p>group of people who believe nonsense</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saying that anybody else has the answers like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>right and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wrong or i have</p>
<p>some information you don&rsquo;t have i don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>you know i have</p>
<p>my own life that i can tell you honestly</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;ve learned from my</p>
<p>experiences and</p>
<p>things that i&rsquo;ve read that</p>
<p>other people have researched but</p>
<p>what do i really know</p>
<p>about what the fuck this is and what&rsquo;s next nothing</p>
<p>and i know as much as anybody</p>
<p>and you know as much as anybody</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a single person who has more of an</p>
<p>more of a realistic view</p>
<p>of the next</p>
<p>phase of existence</p>
<p>whether it exists at all</p>
<p>no one knows</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t help</p>
<p>pretending you do know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what fucks everybody up</p>
<p>what fucks everybody</p>
<p>up is someone that pretends they do know</p>
<p>because then</p>
<p>we with our fucking</p>
<p>monkey instincts just follow that guy</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like well he knows he knows he&rsquo;s so confident</p>
<p>and this guy</p>
<p>of course he&rsquo;s confident all</p>
<p>these people are listening to him</p>
<p>first of all he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy and then all</p>
<p>these people are listening to him</p>
<p>and so the more people</p>
<p>listen to him the more he believes his own bullshit</p>
<p>and the more he really</p>
<p>thinks he is special</p>
<p>and ordained and there to give the word of the lord</p>
<p>and the more but delusional they become i mean it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>classic jim</p>
<p>jones pattern</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the idea is</p>
<p>completely ridiculous</p>
<p>that some guys</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t get pussy</p>
<p>have the answers</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s got the fucking answers</p>
<p>and there should be no</p>
<p>ideologies like this there</p>
<p>should be no</p>
<p>predetermined patterns of behavior</p>
<p>that are attractive to follow</p>
<p>because anything</p>
<p>predetermined like that is</p>
<p>gonna fuck you up</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna give you a realistic map of the world</p>
<p>you live in your map of the</p>
<p>world back when people had very little information</p>
<p>when catholicism was created the map of the</p>
<p>world was there was no internet</p>
<p>there is no</p>
<p>exchange of ideas</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no pornography available on your fucking iphone</p>
<p>anywhere you look</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things that are different</p>
<p>about that world than</p>
<p>about this world</p>
<p>and so all their</p>
<p>crazy nonsense</p>
<p>you know could be easily disproved if somebody</p>
<p>tried to start up that religion today</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s been there forever so people just fucking</p>
<p>stick with it it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>weirdest thing ever</p>
<p>like logically</p>
<p>religion is one of the weirdest</p>
<p>things ever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so hard to believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still around</p>
<p>you really got stopped</p>
<p>watching lost at the wrong time</p>
<p>fuck it&rsquo;s getting religious</p>
<p>religious yeah</p>
<p>well maybe i&rsquo;ll tune in</p>
<p>i still got him getting</p>
<p>kind of like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>confused now</p>
<p>and since you probably know religion a lot more than</p>
<p>me i really like i do and i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t i know i know</p>
<p>sir enough to get</p>
<p>annoyed and then when i</p>
<p>start researching it more it becomes</p>
<p>more and more cookie and then i can&rsquo;t take it anymore</p>
<p>so i only know surface details of like all religions</p>
<p>but all i know</p>
<p>about all of them is they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>ideologies you know</p>
<p>any anything like that is dangerous anything</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>older people when you grow up with these</p>
<p>older people that are telling you what what what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what you should and shouldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you know at best</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>exist really well in</p>
<p>small tribes</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>when people are in</p>
<p>small tribes</p>
<p>those small</p>
<p>tribes are so important to stay</p>
<p>alive these people have this intense bond of family</p>
<p>and i think what happened with</p>
<p>human beings is we went from</p>
<p>small tribes</p>
<p>to gigantic</p>
<p>countries so fast</p>
<p>you know over</p>
<p>the course of just a few thousand years and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think our body</p>
<p>caught up with that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think our body has separated itself from the fact that</p>
<p>you know we really are all connected</p>
<p>i think in the</p>
<p>small tribes</p>
<p>when they were looking out for each</p>
<p>other all the time it was really like having a</p>
<p>giant family</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t feel connected as a country</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel connected with all the americans you know</p>
<p>that seems ridiculous</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s three hundred million</p>
<p>of us so like how how can anybody connect to everybody</p>
<p>back then they could</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wired we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wired for that kind of life i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s why so many people are depressed</p>
<p>i think people are depressed</p>
<p>because the energy in</p>
<p>their life is</p>
<p>imbalanced because they don&rsquo;t have enough love</p>
<p>and companionship it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about their life</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about you need to just</p>
<p>feel love you don&rsquo;t need negative things</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you were</p>
<p>on a plane and you hear</p>
<p>like a screaming kid</p>
<p>right next to you and you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>sleep now it</p>
<p>might be different</p>
<p>from you because you know you have kids now but</p>
<p>in the old days that used to just</p>
<p>drive you want to just fucking</p>
<p>knock the kid out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t draw me it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all anymore</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it was like comforting yeah i like it i like kids</p>
<p>what if i started</p>
<p>crying what</p>
<p>would happen</p>
<p>slap you in the mouth</p>
<p>like the waterfalls on your ass</p>
<p>i went waterfalls on you the other day let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bring this bottle up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny i do i explode once a year no i can get</p>
<p>i can cry in</p>
<p>movies and shit man i cried and that jeff bridges movie</p>
<p>crazy heart oh really oh i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna see that then i don&rsquo;t wanna see that</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>they got me a couple times they got me a couple times</p>
<p>wow there was</p>
<p>one especially</p>
<p>cause it was about a little kid</p>
<p>oh really little kid getting lost</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna tell you anymore</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i won&rsquo;t say anything if</p>
<p>anybody i don&rsquo;t wanna give away anything about the</p>
<p>movie but if you haven&rsquo;t seen it so badass movie</p>

<p>tomorrow oh shit</p>
<p>man when i bet on me</p>
<p>did i use it no one is more of a</p>
<p>technology junkie than this motherfucker and</p>
<p>if you have ever seen his youtube page</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s find jesus right</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s yeah youtube backslash</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s find jesus please go to redband com</p>
<p>yeah go to redband com</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all up there again</p>
<p>he if you ever think</p>
<p>about getting any kind of a camera or anything</p>
<p>check out his</p>
<p>reviews because he&rsquo;s like the most thorough</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the biggest</p>
<p>tech head i know and</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know anybody who is more of a junkie of</p>
<p>technology than him and more</p>
<p>also more knowledgeable</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re always on the ball</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s so many people giving a shit on this ipad</p>
<p>well you are a little bit of an</p>
<p>apple fan i am an</p>
<p>apple fan boy</p>
<p>you know why that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re giving you shit it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>excited they&rsquo;re really hating</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>excited you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when you see</p>
<p>what gets tricky</p>
<p>not when you praise an</p>
<p>object but when you</p>
<p>start shitting on like the kindle</p>
<p>no fuck the kiddos dead</p>
<p>fucking kid</p>
<p>and then people</p>
<p>defend their kindle</p>
<p>and they get</p>
<p>crazy you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not an apple family</p>
<p>so many cameras i love</p>
<p>so many cameras i like the company i like to support</p>
<p>support something that i believe</p>
<p>in i think they&rsquo;re the best</p>
<p>i love their little portable cameras with the ipad</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s crazy is before i was kind of like</p>
<p>tricking myself like yeah i just</p>
<p>want to get a netbook this is better than a netbook</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna support this thing</p>
<p>but then lately</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been showing all</p>
<p>these applications and i&rsquo;m like they have netflix now</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m gonna tether</p>
<p>internet from my cell phone</p>
<p>and be able to</p>
<p>watch netflix</p>
<p>anywhere i want to</p>
<p>throughout the united</p>
<p>states look at em</p>
<p>hey he&rsquo;s losing his goddamn marbles i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m tired of people i&rsquo;m just gonna live</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m living in my fucking</p>
<p>technology world it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>great it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny because if you were forced to live your life</p>
<p>in front of a computer</p>
<p>and then someone allowed you to go outside you&rsquo;d be so</p>
<p>happy to go outside right</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s because we were forced to live in reality</p>
<p>that the computer life seems so much more interesting</p>
<p>it seems more like</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m supposed to i&rsquo;m looking for something yeah</p>
<p>we always talk that like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why google is one of my favorite websites is i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>searching for</p>
<p>something always i&rsquo;m searching for something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best thing</p>
<p>about my message board when i go to that message board</p>
<p>every day i&rsquo;m looking what do you got</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>what am i looking for i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i will click links</p>
<p>until literally</p>
<p>sometimes i&rsquo;m nodding out at the fucking keyboard</p>
<p>you ever do that yeah i&rsquo;m like nodding out the keyboard</p>
<p>you sitting there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m supposed to be writing</p>
<p>and i just start surfing the internet</p>
<p>and then next</p>
<p>thing you know i&rsquo;m not now</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like what am i doing what kind of retard am i</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know what i&rsquo;m looking for</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s never been</p>
<p>a better time to be able to promote your gigs oh yeah</p>
<p>so much better</p>
<p>than it&rsquo;s ever been before because</p>
<p>you know you can you can</p>
<p>get information out there and you know you can</p>
<p>you develop like a</p>
<p>whole network of your fans you know</p>
<p>and on your twitter page and your message board and</p>
<p>and people get to know you like the real you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>the old days you</p>
<p>would do like</p>
<p>an interview you know like somebody like dean martin or</p>
<p>something like that you know there&rsquo;s a kid with a bell</p>
<p>going eggs to</p>
<p>eggs to jewelry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a funny farm</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>how do you get someone to shows and</p>
<p>what they know</p>
<p>about you is like you</p>
<p>would do like the ed</p>
<p>sullivan show</p>
<p>you know you go on</p>
<p>stage and do like</p>
<p>seven minutes like that&rsquo;s all you got</p>
<p>right now you could</p>
<p>you know i was telling ari like</p>
<p>we were ari who&rsquo;s a very funny guy</p>
<p>sometimes has a hard time getting gigs on the road</p>
<p>and i was saying</p>
<p>you should put together something you know</p>
<p>where you do your best bits that you&rsquo;ve ever done and</p>
<p>throw them up</p>
<p>on youtube because he has a lot of bits he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even do anymore because he&rsquo;s got new bits</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like but you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>those old bits like in a video</p>
<p>you should make a</p>
<p>video of your shit man you know</p>
<p>and put that on youtube i go you got really good bits</p>
<p>you know like the gay bar bed and like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of bits of the hands that are really</p>
<p>classic bits that he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do anymore</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like take</p>
<p>those could just</p>
<p>throw them up on youtube man</p>
<p>and then people</p>
<p>will see it when it comes to you it shows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really the best method it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know the old method of like</p>
<p>do you do like a comedy</p>

<p>cut a wrinkle and it&rsquo;ll take make your skin grow</p>
<p>back like you&rsquo;ll find out what your skin texture is</p>
<p>you just see the</p>
<p>video demo it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sweet so crazy so yeah for us</p>
<p>completely gone nap we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to the moon 10 times next year</p>
<p>it really is getting very strange</p>
<p>technology is getting very strange</p>
<p>it really is getting to this weird</p>
<p>point and we&rsquo;ve talked about this before</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about on stage lately that it used to be that people</p>
<p>and i wrote about this in my blog</p>
<p>that when they invented something it was to make</p>
<p>their life better</p>
<p>the first caveman</p>
<p>invented putting a sharp</p>
<p>stick you know</p>
<p>you know appointed rock at the end of a</p>
<p>stick so they could</p>
<p>kill something</p>
<p>right and then they invented a pot so they</p>
<p>could take the meat and put it in something</p>
<p>carried easier and then they invented</p>
<p>all these i mean it made their life easier</p>
<p>what the fuck does the</p>
<p>large hadron collider do</p>
<p>to make your life easier</p>
<p>it looks awesome</p>
<p>it looks insane it looks like the biggest</p>
<p>robot roller coaster ever</p>
<p>they need to make a</p>
<p>movie in there</p>
<p>dude it looks so</p>
<p>crazy copper orange</p>
<p>2 in there can you imagine that just</p>
<p>think of the idea behind it</p>
<p>we are going to</p>
<p>send atoms around a</p>
<p>twenty seven kilometer circle</p>
<p>a giant machine</p>
<p>to build up</p>
<p>speed did they get to like</p>
<p>just below the</p>
<p>speed of light they slam into each other</p>
<p>yeah what the fuck</p>
<p>how is that</p>
<p>trickling down to anybody</p>
<p>i mean is there anything out of particle physics that</p>
<p>trickles down to make life more convenient for people</p>
<p>anything i mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>the biggest</p>
<p>scientific project in history</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 10 000 different scientists from 100 countries</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s cost billions and billions of dollars</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not criticizing</p>
<p>right and don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong because</p>
<p>somebody said something</p>
<p>about this like how</p>
<p>could you attack science</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re trying they&rsquo;re doing what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying i&rsquo;m so not criticizing</p>
<p>i am oh i am not i am not on one side of the other</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s anything</p>
<p>wrong with them doing this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just completely fascinated by it</p>
<p>i am so fascinated by the idea</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to recreate the</p>
<p>conditions right</p>
<p>after the big bang</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re doing this and</p>
<p>probably something</p>
<p>weird that it</p>
<p>would trickle down to like storage of</p>
<p>power like battery life and</p>
<p>stuff you know</p>
<p>what i mean or</p>
<p>something ridiculous like that</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>figuring out how to save</p>
<p>power or energy i mean</p>
<p>maybe because</p>
<p>they are making a collision yeah</p>
<p>there might be something</p>
<p>weird like that or it</p>
<p>could be something gay</p>
<p>it could trickle down i</p>
<p>guess i mean</p>
<p>who the fuck</p>
<p>is to say they&rsquo;re not that smart yeah</p>
<p>i mean when</p>
<p>things get really wonky is</p>
<p>when they really figure out how to crack time</p>
<p>when they figure out how to</p>
<p>travel through time</p>
<p>you know and there&rsquo;s been like there&rsquo;s a model</p>
<p>that this this fucking</p>
<p>this scientist i</p>
<p>think his name was</p>
<p>kirk gordel</p>
<p>it was like when i was o&rsquo;s with the double</p>
<p>o what is that called um</p>
<p>lot anyway he</p>
<p>was this guy who figured out that if you</p>
<p>could you have to take a cylinder</p>
<p>half the size of the</p>
<p>solar system</p>
<p>and spinning it at the</p>
<p>speed of light you have to</p>
<p>cross its i don&rsquo;t remember exactly what the fuck</p>
<p>you know the formula was for it</p>
<p>but if you did that if you you actually created this</p>
<p>thing that was</p>
<p>half the size of the solar system</p>
<p>moving at a</p>
<p>speed of light somehow i know you actually</p>
<p>could go back in time like it is possible</p>
<p>like what the fuck</p>
<p>what if what if they figure out something</p>
<p>along those lines because</p>
<p>the thing about people is we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be satisfied with just a large hadron collider</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re gonna figure this out they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna create the higgs boston particle and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go well here we</p>
<p>got it you know we did create the god particle and we</p>
<p>we know that it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>no they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>come there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be another</p>
<p>thing there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try to get crazier</p>
<p>we think we can make a black hole</p>
<p>well if you</p>
<p>think you can make a</p>
<p>black hole let&rsquo;s not do it</p>
<p>right well we don&rsquo;t know if we can make a</p>
<p>black hole but we</p>
<p>think we can make</p>
<p>and we think it&rsquo;ll go away really</p>
<p>quickly like what</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s next</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucking with everything</p>
<p>you know a thought i like a lot that we talked</p>
<p>about recently i always keep on</p>
<p>going back to</p>
<p>thinking is like</p>
<p>how what if all this create</p>
<p>because lately i have had a lot of</p>
<p>crazy stuff</p>
<p>going on in my life</p>
<p>and i was like what if</p>
<p>me and you in the future like iphone 50</p>
<p>are changing the past</p>
<p>hey what do you want this month</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re creating our own past</p>
<p>using technology</p>
<p>changing time</p>
<p>remember when we were talking</p>
<p>about that yeah like how</p>
<p>weird would that be like if we</p>
<p>could sit there now</p>
<p>and go okay we can go back to 1989</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>pizza here do you want something</p>
<p>crazy to happen</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>pizza here yeah let&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>throw in this</p>
<p>crazy you know right</p>
<p>cause like lately</p>
<p>it just seems like alright this is like</p>
<p>a lot of the</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s happened to me it seems like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so insane that it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem real</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m waiting for reality show cameras to come out</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know man you know i have</p>
<p>often thought that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a path</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re supposed to live in life and that path</p>
<p>will sort of</p>
<p>illuminate itself to you as you go</p>
<p>along the way</p>
<p>as long as you pay attention to your instincts</p>
<p>right you know and i think</p>
<p>a big part of that path is like your attitude in life</p>
<p>and how you view</p>
<p>things and how</p>
<p>you feel about yourself and how you feel</p>
<p>about life and i</p>
<p>think in as much as you can</p>
<p>kind of dictate a lot of that you can kind of</p>
<p>decide how you view the</p>
<p>world you can kind of decide your approach to things</p>
<p>and you can decide it</p>
<p>based on your instincts and i</p>
<p>think if you do that</p>
<p>then everything kind of just works out in a</p>
<p>great way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird you know as long as you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>right things it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you have to really be a positive person you have</p>
<p>to really be disciplined so you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>slacking off on all the</p>
<p>things that you</p>
<p>should be working on and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain balance</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>guiltiness that you feel when you don&rsquo;t work hard</p>
<p>enough at something and that&rsquo;s there for a reason right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessary</p>
<p>you can get that out of your life</p>
<p>just by doing what you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>do and it feels better and you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>self defeating in the process</p>
<p>right you know i</p>
<p>think i think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a path to life dude</p>
<p>and i think you might</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s very being controlled by us in the future</p>
<p>using technology</p>
<p>well that was our theory</p>
<p>right right i</p>
<p>think maybe that</p>
<p>is a possibility i mean</p>
<p>who the fuck knows</p>
<p>but i think what&rsquo;s more likely is that</p>
<p>every person sort of as</p>
<p>ridiculous as it</p>
<p>sounds that</p>
<p>every person sort of fits into</p>
<p>a piece in this world</p>
<p>and that this</p>
<p>world everything</p>
<p>about it from bottled</p>
<p>water to fucking</p>
<p>space shuttles</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s all connected</p>
<p>and then it really is</p>
<p>even though it seems like life like we</p>
<p>think of it as just life that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>labeled it well here&rsquo;s life on the</p>
<p>world here&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>going about</p>
<p>their day here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know a boat on the</p>
<p>water we think</p>
<p>about it like that</p>
<p>but really all</p>
<p>these things in this life</p>
<p>everything they all have a</p>
<p>value they all have a position</p>
<p>they all have a purpose</p>
<p>and it really is like what we&rsquo;re living in</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re living in a gigantic mathematical equation</p>
<p>and i think that that&rsquo;s what all</p>
<p>human life animal life</p>
<p>wind and fucking</p>
<p>earthquakes and</p>
<p>everything i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s all a part of</p>
<p>this insane mathematical</p>
<p>equation and that</p>
<p>chaos in life and</p>
<p>you know earthquakes and meteor impacts</p>
<p>these are all</p>
<p>built into this equation</p>
<p>this is how the</p>
<p>system works</p>
<p>this is how the</p>
<p>system works it seems like this</p>
<p>crazy randomness this fury of nature and you know and</p>
<p>birth and death and</p>
<p>you know and sexuality and creativity</p>
<p>and you know why was my</p>
<p>childhood so bad and you know why</p>
<p>was i raised you know in a wealthy family now i&rsquo;m lazy</p>
<p>you know all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things they all play like a little park and this</p>
<p>giant fucking equation it&rsquo;s just so big we can&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>and so crazy and</p>
<p>alien because it is us</p>
<p>because it is the</p>
<p>world we live in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible for us to really see the big</p>
<p>picture you know i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>very possibly what we&rsquo;re doing in this world</p>
<p>i think all of us are living</p>
<p>a giant mathematical equation and i</p>
<p>think it probably has something to do with technology</p>
<p>mean no one</p>
<p>you know treats that like</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a serious</p>
<p>possibility because it&rsquo;s a subject of terminator movies</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>if you looked at what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on you</p>
<p>would see that</p>
<p>technology is</p>
<p>increasing at a much</p>
<p>faster rate of</p>
<p>evolution than</p>
<p>human beings</p>
<p>and if essentially what we&rsquo;re capable of doing as a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>is make calculations and move and make decisions and</p>
<p>you know and have</p>
<p>moral code and a judgment in your mind i mean</p>
<p>you could fucking program a religion</p>
<p>into a computer and it</p>
<p>would actually follow it</p>
<p>you could give a computer a personality</p>
<p>you could force a computer to</p>
<p>react a certain way to different things</p>
<p>then you figure out a way to put a computer so small</p>
<p>that you put it in an artificial</p>
<p>body that you&rsquo;ve created with your fucking computer</p>
<p>and the next</p>
<p>thing you know you have computers making</p>
<p>life and that life is a computer and that computer is</p>
<p>living you know its own version</p>
<p>of this mathematical program yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just as possible</p>
<p>as us being a part of a mathematical program right</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s all very possible</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>we are here to create</p>
<p>technology and then our</p>
<p>whole society is geared towards creating technology</p>
<p>the fact that like in china</p>
<p>do you know how fucked up the the</p>
<p>pollution is in china</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>they had this one city i forget what it is i</p>
<p>think vbs tv did</p>
<p>a documentary on it</p>
<p>this one city where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so bad there that just breathing the air is like</p>
<p>smoking three packs of</p>
<p>cigarettes a day</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty bad here too joe</p>
<p>the other day i was coming</p>
<p>or drive into my</p>
<p>house and you couldn&rsquo;t even see burbank because</p>
<p>of the smog</p>
<p>yeah that is bad</p>
<p>and we just breathe it in</p>
<p>every day it&rsquo;s not bad</p>
<p>where you live but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like yeah it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be as good for you as clean air</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why i wanted to move to</p>
<p>colorado you know</p>
<p>i wanted to get away from this overpopulation austin</p>
<p>texas i tell you</p>
<p>well everybody says that though</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why everybody&rsquo;s moving to austin you know</p>
<p>i certainly</p>
<p>think the places that</p>
<p>have less people are nicer</p>
<p>we were in charlotte</p>
<p>north carolina this week for the ufc</p>
<p>and people and charlotte are so fucking nice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my second</p>
<p>place i would move any</p>
<p>south carolina or</p>
<p>north carolina</p>
<p>dude charlotte</p>
<p>north carolina the people were so fucking cool</p>
<p>everybody was friendly</p>
<p>everybody was normal</p>
<p>you know it was like it was a really nice</p>
<p>place people were really nice</p>
<p>everybody in restaurants and bars</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s less people people</p>
<p>are more down home they&rsquo;re more friendly you know</p>
<p>it was a good time</p>
<p>yeah yeah this ain&rsquo;t the best way to live</p>
<p>new york is</p>
<p>where we were just at</p>
<p>and those those are</p>
<p>more interesting</p>
<p>thing is we went from new york</p>
<p>to charlotte</p>
<p>north carolina</p>
<p>and charlotte</p>
<p>north carolina is way better</p>
<p>i mean new york</p>
<p>yeah has more restaurants yeah yeah yeah there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>stuff to do</p>
<p>definitely but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also more tension</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>dealing with the overpopulation dealing with traffic</p>
<p>just like everybody&rsquo;s on edge</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to live somewhere</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s on edge</p>
<p>yeah it makes people</p>
<p>a little bit some people more creative it makes i</p>
<p>think it makes for more interesting people</p>
<p>you know people on the east</p>
<p>coast are way more interesting to me</p>
<p>than people on the west</p>
<p>coast they&rsquo;re way funnier to me too isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>weird that the left sides</p>
<p>of the united</p>
<p>states is more dangerous than the right side</p>
<p>but yet the</p>
<p>right side has the</p>
<p>angrier people</p>
<p>than the left side when it comes to like the east</p>
<p>coast versus west most of east</p>
<p>coast the left</p>
<p>coast is more dangerous</p>
<p>like angry people you know</p>
<p>like the new york</p>
<p>attitudes that boston attitudes the</p>
<p>florida gangster</p>
<p>the east coast is more</p>
<p>aggressive yeah</p>
<p>aggressive but yet that&rsquo;s the safer</p>
<p>place to live</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d think it&rsquo;d be nice to people</p>
<p>north carolina why is it a safer</p>
<p>place because</p>
<p>the whole side we live on you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>into the world shit like the</p>
<p>earthquakes and the volcanoes and the fucking</p>
<p>sort of but you know what they have to deal with snow</p>
<p>okay snow&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>motherfucker the</p>
<p>secrets of snow too</p>
<p>snow makes people a little more</p>
<p>a little more hostile in america at least</p>
<p>i tried to explain</p>
<p>awake that that</p>
<p>that like why people are so</p>
<p>aggressive in boston and new york</p>
<p>i always said was they got to</p>
<p>deal with that cold weather it gets you a little more</p>
<p>tense but i</p>
<p>think this is</p>
<p>more to it than that it&rsquo;s cold weather and</p>
<p>overpopulation</p>
<p>together that&rsquo;s what makes douchey people</p>
<p>because in canada</p>
<p>people are so fucking nice man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so well you know what that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense either</p>
<p>because even in toronto toronto is a big ass city</p>
<p>and people are nice as fuck there too</p>
<p>canada&rsquo;s just make it</p>
<p>get much nicer</p>
<p>up there maybe</p>
<p>when your body has too much hydration you get angry</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what it is man</p>
<p>because canada</p>
<p>is not a country that&rsquo;s living</p>
<p>under the shadow of this government</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s out there trying to take over the world</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s part of it too</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make you up for america in the 50s though</p>
<p>or you know in the 30s or the 40s</p>
<p>they were pretty</p>
<p>aggressive back then too</p>
<p>and even in the 1800s</p>
<p>you ever see gangs in new york</p>
<p>what it used to be like</p>
<p>no dude gangs in new york is an awesome</p>
<p>movie you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never seen that no</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>to daniel day</p>
<p>lewis is one of</p>
<p>those dudes that like becomes</p>
<p>whoever the fuck is</p>
<p>in that movie he&rsquo;s like a different dude</p>
<p>when he does</p>
<p>these movies you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those few guys</p>
<p>that really</p>
<p>russell crowe can do that</p>
<p>gary oldman can do the shit out of that</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those dudes</p>
<p>that just becomes a different dude when he&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>those movies man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that new leonardo</p>
<p>movie do you ever see it</p>
<p>the shut stutter</p>
<p>island or yeah i didn&rsquo;t like that one you didn&rsquo;t no</p>
<p>now i talked</p>
<p>about it it was really good for like the</p>
<p>first hour or so</p>
<p>and then i don&rsquo;t want to give away any</p>
<p>spoilers because some people</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t seen it either</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t wanna say it you ever see the</p>
<p>beach with him in it or the island or</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s like the cheesiest</p>
<p>movie ever but i like a good fucking actor though yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s another one he he gets into</p>
<p>things like he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s good you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>by the way oh yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a craft you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s some cheese heads out there there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing anything special but there&rsquo;s a few like like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing that that</p>
<p>movie that i said</p>
<p>crazy heart what you guys</p>
<p>named jeff bridges</p>
<p>jeff bridges</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s another guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the big lebowski i mean he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an amazing actor he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those dudes</p>
<p>you just he gets into that fucking role man he does it</p>
<p>so so we should answer some questions or something</p>
<p>yeah everybody</p>
<p>you see the movie</p>
<p>dream with the fishes</p>
<p>dream with the fishes you know as</p>
<p>david arquette in it</p>
<p>really small</p>
<p>budget low budget</p>
<p>movie but one of the</p>
<p>things is is like</p>
<p>they this guy was</p>
<p>dying and said</p>
<p>they he wanted to do like what his last list of</p>
<p>things and one</p>
<p>thing he did is he went</p>
<p>naked bowling he went in this bowling</p>
<p>alley in the middle</p>
<p>night on lsd</p>
<p>and went bowling</p>
<p>naked with strippers</p>

<p>right there to me is just</p>
<p>is there any</p>
<p>three things that you</p>
<p>would say if you knew you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to die that you would</p>

<p>but you know what</p>
<p>i could be okay without seeing</p>
<p>them i think</p>
<p>being i mean i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve seen so much of it on dvd</p>
<p>i mean i think yeah it</p>
<p>would be really</p>
<p>nice to go over there and see it live for sure</p>
<p>definitely like it</p>
<p>would be spiritual</p>
<p>like not feel like a different vibe in the air</p>
<p>yeah you know i know what you mean yeah but i</p>
<p>could be okay without saying that i mean</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s real i</p>
<p>would love to see</p>
<p>a lot of things i</p>
<p>would love to</p>
<p>see the congo but i don&rsquo;t want to go in there</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>scary but if you get</p>
<p>when force fields come out</p>
<p>would you go in</p>
<p>what if you fucking force</p>
<p>your runs out of battery</p>
<p>yeah person</p>
<p>right when a</p>
<p>gorillas make it a fucking charge at you</p>
<p>what is no not now you fuck what if personal</p>
<p>force fields were like oh you got at t personal</p>

<p>crazy you&rsquo;re gonna go in the congo with at t personal</p>
<p>right yeah you don&rsquo;t have verizon do not go overseas</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s no no shit right it&rsquo;s gonna be like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be tied to at t one did you like dr manhattan</p>
<p>what dr manhattan</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that from the fucking oh what is it</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that movie</p>
<p>watchman yes the watchman</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>so you know i was not familiar with that comic book</p>
<p>before that movie</p>
<p>either was i</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good though did</p>
<p>you know it was on ellen is dr manhattan</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i ever talked about this</p>
<p>when twitter</p>
<p>first came out ellen</p>
<p>tweeted like</p>
<p>hey go to this bus stop if you want to be on the show</p>
<p>but you have to</p>
<p>dress up as a superhero hurry</p>
<p>and i was at the stoplight</p>
<p>right next to that bus stop</p>
<p>so i pull over</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m fucking looking through my car</p>
<p>trying to find i had some laundry in there i had some</p>
<p>clothes and</p>
<p>a back pillow and</p>
<p>i found all these blue</p>
<p>things and i</p>
<p>dressed up all in blue</p>
<p>and i put this neck pillow on my head and</p>
<p>i got in the bus stop</p>
<p>and i was on the</p>
<p>ellen show as dr manhattan</p>
<p>and one of the funniest</p>
<p>things though was i took a</p>
<p>sleeve of a blue coat and i put it through my zipper</p>
<p>and i tied it at the end and put some</p>
<p>socks in it and</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>so it looked like i had this big wavy dick</p>
<p>and nobody even</p>
<p>solid like they didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>understand that that&rsquo;s what it was</p>
<p>but if you watch it knowing that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m coming out on</p>
<p>ellen they&rsquo;re like let&rsquo;s introduce dr wat mr manhattan</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m coming out with a</p>
<p>swingy thing is there a</p>
<p>video of this online</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t but i will put a video</p>
<p>up how do you not have that online</p>
<p>i think i do but it&rsquo;s on my facebook</p>
<p>and god how dare you i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>put it on the masses you fucked up you</p>
<p>should have it right now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll put it</p>
<p>redband com or twitter back</p>
<p>right now redband com</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get joe&rsquo;s philosophy of</p>
<p>thinking that scene</p>
<p>that scene the pyramids on tv is the same as real life</p>
<p>oh man i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the same as real life i&rsquo;m just saying if i</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s only a few</p>
<p>things i could do before i died that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be my choice i&rsquo;d be okay without seeing it i</p>
<p>would like to see it</p>
<p>one of the reasons why i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t done it is because</p>
<p>first of all i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have much time i travel so much for work</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really have that much time to travel</p>
<p>outside of work it&rsquo;s not fun for me it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>traveling all the time so like an extra trip to egypt</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>exciting to me</p>
<p>and then the other part</p>
<p>about it is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that safe over there you know you got to be</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s tricky i don&rsquo;t want to have to</p>
<p>sweat shit you know i saw</p>
<p>the only ruins i&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in mexico i saw the mayan</p>
<p>ruins at chichen itza which</p>
<p>is pretty humbling man</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really fascinating just</p>
<p>stand there</p>
<p>and i do agree that there&rsquo;s a big difference between</p>
<p>standing there in person</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>checking these things out</p>
<p>then watching a</p>
<p>video or seeing it in pictures</p>
<p>standing there in person was</p>
<p>pretty flabbergasting</p>
<p>but all i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>go to egypt i</p>
<p>would like to yes but i don&rsquo;t need to i</p>
<p>could be okay without doing it</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m not saying that it&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly not</p>
<p>you know but you can</p>
<p>learn a lot of</p>
<p>things about</p>
<p>certain places and really</p>
<p>experience like how amazing and beautiful they are</p>
<p>just from dvds</p>
<p>like you really don&rsquo;t have to fucking</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to go to the congo the congo so fucking dangerous</p>
<p>everything there is trying to kill you</p>
<p>everything there</p>
<p>they got ants there that kill elephants</p>
<p>what did you hear me son</p>
<p>they got ants that kill elephants they</p>
<p>climb up the fucking elephant</p>
<p>go into his ear and</p>
<p>start eating his</p>
<p>brain while he&rsquo;s alive</p>
<p>and they do that in</p>
<p>surges they have</p>
<p>these little</p>
<p>monster ants that</p>
<p>climb inside and eat</p>
<p>their fucking</p>
<p>brain and they&rsquo;re responsible for way more</p>
<p>deaths in africa than any of the</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>ants kill everything man</p>
<p>they kill everything</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>monster crazy</p>
<p>scary ants in in africa</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>fuck all that what</p>
<p>about the spiders</p>
<p>that act as a team</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no spiders anywhere in the</p>
<p>world that act in packs</p>
<p>except the congo</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even know why</p>
<p>but fucking</p>
<p>deers get trapped</p>
<p>and these little tiny</p>
<p>spider webs deers get trapped</p>
<p>these tiny spiders</p>
<p>swarm on it like a hundred once and fuck them up</p>
<p>they make these</p>
<p>giant ass fucking webs</p>
<p>they realize that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>small and in</p>
<p>order to survive and stay</p>
<p>alive they have to jack bigger shit</p>
<p>so they they fucking</p>
<p>teamed up they get birds they get all kinds of shit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fucking nuts man it is nuts</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just spiders</p>
<p>what about the fucking</p>
<p>snakes there&rsquo;s all kinds of fucking</p>
<p>snakes in the congo there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a chimpanzee in the congo that&rsquo;s six feet tall</p>
<p>and they walk upright sometimes</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called bondo apes it</p>
<p>sounds retarded it</p>
<p>sounds totally ridiculous</p>
<p>because nobody ever tells you about it</p>
<p>but they have</p>
<p>photographs of</p>
<p>these things they got</p>
<p>pictures of a dead one</p>
<p>they have different</p>
<p>bone samples</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ve confirmed this is an actual real animal</p>
<p>it has a crest on his head like a gorilla does</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a different animal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different species of chimpanzee</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much larger</p>
<p>and they call them lion killers that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>locals call them</p>
<p>and they have fucking observed</p>
<p>scientists observe and</p>
<p>photograph them eating a dead jaguar</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know if they killed the jaguar</p>
<p>but what the fuck</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating a goddamn</p>
<p>jaguar that&rsquo;s why verizon personal</p>
<p>force field is important very important</p>
<p>but i would love</p>
<p>to see all that you know but i don&rsquo;t want to go there</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>you go to the congo</p>
<p>just a mosquito will fuck the rest of your life up</p>
<p>you ever watch that show</p>
<p>or the enemies inside us</p>
<p>where people like they always go</p>
<p>swimming in africa and like fucking geniuses</p>
<p>and shit gets in</p>
<p>their ear and</p>
<p>starts rotten away</p>
<p>their brain</p>
<p>you know like big giant</p>
<p>tumors you growing in</p>
<p>their head and turns to be a massive worms</p>
<p>that they picked up in africa</p>
<p>seven years ago</p>
<p>get the fuck out of africa are you crazy</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s trying to kill you there everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s scary man</p>
<p>sounds like a good porno to</p>
<p>enemy inside you yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>things that porns do</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really good at that yeah they&rsquo;re really good at</p>
<p>coming up with</p>
<p>jersey or names yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty</p>
<p>pretty creative when it comes to that yeah</p>

<p>weren&rsquo;t high</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been not smoking weed i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke weed for almost a week</p>
<p>until recently</p>
<p>his guy says are you</p>
<p>aware the internet</p>
<p>came out of cern no i didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>those are the people that are working on the</p>
<p>large hadron collider</p>
<p>wow i thought the internet came out</p>
<p>al gore&rsquo;s butthole</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t it no</p>
<p>how did that even</p>
<p>he never really said steve</p>
<p>was in the act</p>
<p>started that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that be hilarious</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna start this</p>
<p>thing about al</p>
<p>gore but he</p>
<p>never really said that he invented the internet right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all no</p>
<p>he helped work on what</p>
<p>came the internet but it was more like funding right</p>
<p>i help like</p>
<p>push a bill</p>
<p>through or some nonsense</p>
<p>like in the</p>
<p>guy pushing for right he</p>
<p>might have said that he was one of the people that</p>
<p>helped but did he ever say does anybody know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even want to look that up you know why fuck out or</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t give a shit</p>
<p>about out core</p>
<p>when i heard how much money out</p>
<p>goes made from climate research</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;m like what al gore has made an assload of money</p>
<p>based on the idea that we are</p>
<p>you know warming the earth</p>
<p>with our bullshit</p>
<p>and we may very well be</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know man but i do know that people get nutty</p>
<p>about that issue and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a one of</p>
<p>those weird issues</p>
<p>these those</p>
<p>right left issues are so strange</p>
<p>where people just</p>
<p>start spouting out shit</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really done the research yet</p>
<p>you know like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>video the same guy that did this video</p>
<p>with sarah palin</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember the dude&rsquo;s name i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna find out though</p>
<p>but he did a video</p>
<p>where he went to a</p>
<p>sarah palin</p>
<p>book signing and then</p>
<p>asked these people like you know what do you feel</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>sarah palin what really gets you</p>
<p>excited about you know about her</p>
<p>stance and the issues and no one knew a fucking</p>
<p>thing like not</p>
<p>no one had any idea what</p>
<p>you know they were just like she&rsquo;s just like those</p>
<p>she stands for</p>
<p>you know down home</p>
<p>values and i</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>thing going</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>back to real people like they&rsquo;re just saying nonsense</p>
<p>and you realize that people don&rsquo;t have to fucking</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to you know make</p>
<p>sense they just have to have a</p>
<p>bunch of people</p>
<p>thinking they make sense</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you really need to have</p>
<p>but this guy he did it with the tea</p>
<p>party people too</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like i don&rsquo;t know fucking dudes name</p>
<p>but he made this</p>
<p>video and it was just</p>
<p>genius shit man</p>
<p>you know people just</p>
<p>they everybody</p>
<p>just they just take a side that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their team takes</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like this us</p>
<p>versus them nonsense</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>crazy when it comes to global warming</p>
<p>when it comes to health care</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>everyone has a very</p>
<p>typical and predictable</p>
<p>what are you doing just come back</p>
<p>now typical</p>
<p>and predictable</p>
<p>you know stance on</p>
<p>things and very rarely to people stray</p>
<p>outside you know</p>
<p>either or ideologies left or</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>i hate when people ask me</p>
<p>a democrat or republican like what are you talking</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s a nonsense game</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all nonsense</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no fucking democrats and there&rsquo;s no republicans</p>
<p>just stop it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all nonsense it&rsquo;s been nonsense</p>
<p>since the beginning</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of fucking</p>
<p>red tape and and and and fucking</p>
<p>just complications</p>
<p>a bunch of shit</p>
<p>piled up together</p>
<p>to to control either or</p>
<p>you know the idea that there really</p>
<p>are democrats and there really i mean look at what</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s doing he&rsquo;s doing the</p>
<p>exact same shit bush did</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing a little a few</p>
<p>things different socially</p>
<p>you know the don&rsquo;t ask don&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>but when you win the nobel</p>
<p>peace prize you</p>
<p>still send 30</p>
<p>000 more people to a war that nobody wants</p>
<p>i mean do they</p>
<p>really know more than everybody else they</p>
<p>talk politics on me man</p>
<p>dude it&rsquo;s like talking</p>
<p>sports and to me don&rsquo;t you think that</p>
<p>if you just it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t to me well</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you should</p>
<p>spend that much time who cares what the</p>
<p>government is fuck that guy fuck it all it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>stupid just negative</p>
<p>if you really</p>
<p>think about how fucked up this</p>
<p>whole united</p>
<p>states government it is but i mean you</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s is it possible to do anything</p>
<p>about it i think if it is what the ways you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do something</p>
<p>about it is not necessarily</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s influencing people with thought</p>
<p>and changing</p>
<p>these people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>opinions before they get into this terrible situation</p>
<p>of doing fuck up things</p>
<p>that are not benefiting the people i</p>
<p>think you have to</p>
<p>affect them you have to let them know that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna live forever</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s people way</p>
<p>better than that than me</p>
<p>so instead of</p>
<p>worrying and</p>
<p>spending my stress on it adam</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a comic though man</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s just like another</p>
<p>crazy reality show that i have to watch yeah</p>
<p>you know yeah i just</p>
<p>fucking like it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they attack each other</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so ridiculous</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t believe</p>

<p>everyone&rsquo;s fucking fake it&rsquo;s all bullshit</p>
<p>crazy is that fox news</p>
<p>is real that that&rsquo;s a real i mean that is like some</p>
<p>power to that fox news is a real show</p>
<p>fox news is like if there was like a tv a</p>
<p>movie from the 80s</p>
<p>would like bill</p>
<p>murray in it some sort of a parody</p>
<p>that would be like the</p>
<p>right wing you know</p>
<p>raw raw fucking</p>
<p>truth organization that would be</p>
<p>the network that they</p>
<p>would make fun of</p>
<p>in a parody</p>
<p>movie and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>going on man</p>
<p>in a parody</p>
<p>movie there</p>
<p>would be like some really hot blonde chick</p>
<p>who was mean as fuck</p>
<p>you know like all</p>
<p>those hot blonde chicks on</p>
<p>on fox news that all look like they have this mean face</p>

<p>these stern</p>
<p>right wing like aryan</p>
<p>blue eyed hot bitches</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s perfect for like a bill</p>
<p>murray movie</p>
<p>and those chicks</p>
<p>would be real</p>
<p>horny and somebody be fucking i</p>
<p>would they be</p>
<p>screaming out nazi shit or something</p>
<p>you know i mean that that</p>
<p>would be in the</p>
<p>movie i mean</p>
<p>they really are it is really is life is like a</p>
<p>movie life is like as</p>
<p>ridiculous as a movie</p>
<p>more almost</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>when you think</p>
<p>about like a plot in a</p>
<p>movie that you know is predictable and annoys you</p>
<p>you know life is way more</p>
<p>way more wacky than that</p>
<p>you know what look i mean like</p>
<p>the ted hagrid</p>
<p>thing with that guys that you know the the religious</p>
<p>guy gets caught doing gay sex and crystal math</p>
<p>you know the fucking john</p>
<p>edwards thing</p>
<p>where he gets busted</p>
<p>and his wife is</p>
<p>dying and he&rsquo;s not having this baby with this</p>
<p>other woman and all this</p>
<p>this craziness that goes on with people</p>
<p>all of it all together it&rsquo;s like we are the nuttiest</p>
<p>movie of all time</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the craziest movie ever</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think yeah</p>
<p>and what the fuck is this folks</p>
<p>where is this going</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re all just living and</p>
<p>until our body shut off and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even address it</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even stop and really</p>
<p>think about it i mean you know on oprah</p>
<p>you know everybody wants to tell you how you can</p>
<p>better decorate your living room with fucking feng shui</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>the the the</p>
<p>the current</p>
<p>consciousness of our culture</p>
<p>you know is not at all</p>
<p>focused on the the really big questions like the really</p>
<p>freaky fucking questions</p>
<p>like the fact that</p>
<p>how little we</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>space you know</p>
<p>the little we</p>
<p>think about the fact that</p>
<p>and anytime</p>
<p>some crazy shit can happen there</p>
<p>could be a hypernova</p>
<p>in the next galaxy and we&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>wiped out instantly</p>

<p>random and easily can happen</p>

<p>be a bunch of</p>
<p>dudes who would want to take</p>
<p>pictures with me with</p>
<p>their fists up</p>

<p>civilizations bro i&rsquo;ll fuck those ancient faggots</p>
<p>you want a beer a</p>
<p>boy was it worms to shot girl worms</p>
<p>but anyways that&rsquo;s what would happen</p>
<p>you should have campfires what am i doing</p>
<p>instead of comedy nights you have campfire</p>
<p>night where you&rsquo;re in the middle of a campfire you all</p>
<p>bring your tents and you all hang out and smoke weed</p>
<p>and do mushrooms and you&rsquo;re in the middle</p>
<p>just like doing what you&rsquo;re doing now or stand up kind</p>
<p>of in like a</p>
<p>metal talking campfire guy that sounds like a</p>
<p>great way to get annoyed by hippies</p>
<p>true you gonna deal with a lot of</p>
<p>stinky somebody starts bringing harmonica</p>
<p>no harmonica&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a bunch of stinky dudes that need favors</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be annoying</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be annoying</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the number one problem with marijuana&rsquo;s hippies</p>
<p>god damn some of them are annoying</p>
<p>can you imagine the smell of a hacky sack convention</p>
<p>yeah i could i could</p>
<p>the truly and happy sex sweats yeah hippies you know</p>
<p>the the idea behind it is great</p>
<p>the problem is a lot of the people that fall into that</p>
<p>that mode of thinking they&rsquo;re all fucked up</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re lazy too that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>problem with hippies a lot of them are fucking lazy</p>
<p>you know a lot of them are always</p>
<p>broke and always like want</p>
<p>you to help them out and there&rsquo;s oh it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>drain like if you have hippies for friends it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>some of them are just constantly asking for</p>
<p>favors and it gets so annoying</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like you have to cut them off as friends</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just always needy</p>
<p>you fuck like get your goddamn shit together you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>how many dudes do</p>
<p>you know that are like that that are like always broke</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like come on man</p>
<p>oh so you gotta get your shit together you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s a lot better out here though back in ohio is</p>
<p>completely different you know</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s way more brokesters in ohio</p>
<p>you know at</p>
<p>least out here most people and i know are</p>
<p>you know kind of like</p>
<p>have jobs like us</p>
<p>where you know</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>comics and people that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the people in your circle yeah</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>well you know what man</p>
<p>living a regular life you know regular jobs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard for people to do</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>because you know we&rsquo;re sold</p>
<p>this bill of goods that all you need to be happy is</p>
<p>you know find something that&rsquo;s pays well and that</p>
<p>you know steady work</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t love it you</p>
<p>still have your free time</p>
<p>you know you go through it and</p>
<p>you know you move up the ladder and you make more</p>
<p>money and you buy a bigger house</p>
<p>and then you fucking die</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>end to that you know and</p>
<p>for some idea</p>
<p>for some reason we&rsquo;re sold that there is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sold that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing something we&rsquo;re working hard</p>
<p>and eventually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna pay off</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t pay off</p>
<p>you just die</p>
<p>you know everybody just dies</p>
<p>so you have to</p>
<p>enjoy this this is what you have</p>
<p>enjoyed right now</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not possible for everybody</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of times in your life and in my life</p>
<p>that we weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enjoying things you know</p>
<p>you know i wasn&rsquo;t i wasn&rsquo;t</p>

<p>right when the blair</p>
<p>witch project came out</p>

<p>we all went out and we watched</p>
<p>blair witch</p>
<p>at the theater</p>

<p>2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning by the time we get out and</p>
<p>these kids opened up the</p>
<p>theater and turned it on did</p>
<p>everything just for us</p>
<p>so it was like me and them</p>
<p>and you know my friend chris mcguire and</p>
<p>like one of the guy from the comedy club</p>
<p>and we all watched blair</p>
<p>witch and his</p>

<p>imagine that quake</p>
<p>fucking head</p>
<p>might explode</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do it i&rsquo;m scared of</p>
<p>quake dude to this day i thought</p>
<p>about playing it the other day</p>
<p>i got scared by the way dude your dvd&rsquo;s out too you</p>
<p>should plug that</p>
<p>and my short</p>
<p>movies on there</p>
<p>talking monkeys in columbus yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s pretty cool watch it</p>
<p>yeah the dvds out so if you saw the special</p>
<p>on tv it&rsquo;s that and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uncensored</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of q amp a footage is like</p>
<p>45 minutes or something yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember how many minutes it is but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of q amp a</p>
<p>and i do that at most of the shows i just</p>
<p>i always feel like</p>
<p>it makes it more fun you know like it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing to have like a normal comedy show</p>
<p>and i know you want that too</p>
<p>but i think it&rsquo;s also fun to just</p>
<p>shoot the shit together you know and me make fun of</p>
<p>things you know with a microphone</p>
<p>and so at the end of the show</p>
<p>i always have that kind of q amp a type thing</p>
<p>except it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>becoming bits because everyone</p>
<p>asked the same questions and that kind of</p>
<p>sex is if you see you</p>
<p>twice then you&rsquo;re getting the same questions</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what is the same question i know and i try to some</p>
<p>things have to be answered the</p>
<p>same way like the dmt</p>
<p>thing there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>other way to answer it</p>
<p>you know when i try to explain that there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>other way to explain</p>
<p>it i have to explain it the best way i can explain it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna sound the same way</p>
<p>every time the only way it&rsquo;s funny is</p>
<p>if i do it like that anyway</p>
<p>right it is a bit so but</p>
<p>you know what i&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>about that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna put that on my next</p>
<p>comedy special</p>
<p>that description of it so that way</p>
<p>nobody ever</p>
<p>asked me again</p>
<p>cause they know what it is</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna yell out dmt</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;ll just say go to itunes bitch</p>
<p>you know at a certain</p>
<p>point in time it&rsquo;s like i can&rsquo;t keep talking</p>
<p>about the same things over and over</p>
<p>again and that&rsquo;s one of them that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>ever since i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>did conversations</p>
<p>about it on jim brewer&rsquo;s show</p>
<p>i hate that fight</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna win versus who like people don&rsquo;t get that</p>
<p>you said that a million times</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ask what do you think</p>
<p>about this fight and this fight who&rsquo;s gonna win</p>
<p>well i know i know people like to talk</p>
<p>about fights they just like to talk</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s like baseball to me yeah baseball</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a certain amount</p>
<p>of people that just like that they just like to talk</p>
<p>about it and you know i</p>
<p>appreciate the fact that</p>
<p>you know they like</p>
<p>me as a commentator and they want to know my take on</p>
<p>things you know and i</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>but you know i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>first of all i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t give a prediction</p>
<p>the only time i</p>
<p>would ever give a</p>
<p>prediction is something&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>you know like you know</p>
<p>fade or is gonna</p>
<p>fight my mom</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna say oh my mom&rsquo;s fucked</p>
<p>you know right</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>right you know i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>but unless it&rsquo;s like that i don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>predictions and</p>
<p>those fights don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>occur in the</p>
<p>ufc the ufc fights 99</p>
<p>of them like</p>
<p>hmm so i&rsquo;m like what the fuck is</p>
<p>gonna happen here with this</p>
<p>i can see a lot of scenarios taking place</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>neither one of them is</p>
<p>definite for sure</p>
<p>so i would never say</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s gonna do this and that when</p>
<p>i hear guys</p>
<p>especially guys that have</p>
<p>never fought</p>
<p>in anything before</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>sports broadcaster type dudes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking shit</p>
<p>about fighters and like this guy</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t belong in there with him and it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>easy work for that guy and</p>
<p>i look for him to</p>
<p>knock him out in the</p>
<p>first round</p>
<p>what are you talking</p>
<p>about you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>making some</p>
<p>crazy prediction</p>
<p>about what the fuck is</p>
<p>gonna happen in a</p>
<p>fight between two</p>
<p>skilled men</p>
<p>that are more than capable of</p>
<p>smashing each</p>
<p>other you zig</p>
<p>when you should have zag</p>
<p>bam somebody cracks one</p>
<p>the knees give out</p>
<p>and you got a</p>
<p>flashlight on your face when you</p>
<p>wake up that shit is normal that&rsquo;s par for the course</p>
<p>that happens all the time</p>
<p>you know i mean people who</p>
<p>never thought they were</p>
<p>gonna get knocked out get</p>
<p>knocked out it happens all the time</p>
<p>people get submitted when they were winning easily</p>
<p>you know guys who like</p>
<p>guys who no one ever thought</p>
<p>would get submitted</p>
<p>that dude in the wec recently got so many</p>
<p>karen karen darabedian</p>
<p>i think his name is</p>
<p>badass fucking</p>
<p>grappler and he fucked up he left an arm in there this</p>
<p>dude took his arm block</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t predict</p>

<p>was it off on or was it uh</p>
<p>i tweeted that</p>
<p>ariani plugged</p>
<p>their vibrator in backstage and</p>

<p>you see the</p>
<p>power adapter of it but she</p>
<p>tweeted then that</p>
<p>it was actually my butt plug my vibrating butt plug</p>
<p>so i thought your</p>
<p>ship was solar</p>
<p>powered she made me feel really bad about that</p>
<p>but yeah it was</p>
<p>right before roy nelson fought stefan struve</p>
<p>right before they went to fight</p>
<p>the power went out that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never happened before it was totally affordable</p>

<p>chef from south park</p>
<p>you guys see this what i see</p>
<p>south park dudes</p>
<p>about made up of marijuana</p>
<p>i know man i have to see so many of them i have a</p>
<p>bunch of them</p>
<p>saved up on the dvr</p>
<p>south park is the best ever no no show has been</p>
<p>consistently</p>
<p>funny for this long</p>
<p>you know south park that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest show in the history of the world</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the meanest</p>
<p>when they go</p>
<p>after somebody</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the funniest</p>
<p>that the most fucked up there&rsquo;s no show that&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>close to his fucked up</p>
<p>that show that they did were</p>
<p>paris hilton had the whore off with the gay dude</p>
<p>and he stuff</p>
<p>paris hilton up his ass like oh my god</p>
<p>jesus christ that was good yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just so funny</p>
<p>they take your</p>
<p>place you like there&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go yeah</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t fucking believe you did that you know</p>
<p>they just do it consistently over and over and over</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>the number one show for me like</p>
<p>guaranteed i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna love it yeah</p>
<p>i want to hang with</p>
<p>trey parker so bad</p>
<p>maybe he will try to fuck you or something no no</p>
<p>man i think</p>
<p>i think he&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>one of the funniest guys ever as far as like creativity</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think any anybody has ever</p>
<p>put out as much</p>
<p>stuff as prolific as he is</p>
<p>no one has ever put out as much</p>
<p>funny stuff as that guy and the other guy too</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i mean</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s writing it you&rsquo;ve seen cannibal that</p>
<p>who writes it</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s writing</p>
<p>trades he writes</p>
<p>everything what he</p>
<p>writes everything</p>
<p>i think he just helps once in a</p>
<p>while but it&rsquo;s mostly sure yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want because we don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>give him credit no no</p>
<p>no from what i</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>trey just locks himself</p>
<p>in his office and just mad writer and he&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>changing stuff and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no show that&rsquo;s been like that</p>
<p>i mean think</p>
<p>about what they&rsquo;re doing they have</p>
<p>these little</p>
<p>corny looking animated dudes that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really really really crude</p>
<p>the images are so crude</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really easy to do</p>
<p>you know as far as like that kind of stuff is</p>
<p>and then they consistently</p>
<p>go after more shit and trevor</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>i was gonna answer something real quick</p>
<p>trevor they don&rsquo;t have a team of writers</p>
<p>sorry this guy says they have a team around</p>
<p>but he knows</p>
<p>the people that worked there yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s actually been there before</p>
<p>i think they had a team of writers at one</p>
<p>point for like</p>
<p>a season or something or help</p>
<p>writer help but</p>
<p>from my understanding now it&rsquo;s really just trey</p>
<p>yeah everybody says this week&rsquo;s episode groovy girly</p>
<p>everybody says that it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest episode ever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>ridiculous there&rsquo;s one part about it</p>
<p>so good man they&rsquo;re so good it&rsquo;s humbling</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s humbling how much that guy&rsquo;s put out you know you</p>
<p>think about the</p>
<p>stuff that you&rsquo;ve done like how</p>
<p>productive you&rsquo;ve been over your life</p>
<p>and you see what that guy&rsquo;s done like</p>
<p>jesus christ i just wish that team america too</p>
<p>would happen</p>
<p>cause that was that was so</p>
<p>i know it was the hardest</p>
<p>movie ever for everybody</p>
<p>damn that was</p>
<p>a good one of my i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s top five</p>
<p>maybe maybe the</p>
<p>first one the</p>
<p>there was no no</p>
<p>movie ever the</p>
<p>first time i saw it made me</p>
<p>laugh that hard no</p>
<p>movie yeah no</p>
<p>movie even came close yeah</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>second time it wasn&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>funny to me</p>
<p>but the third time</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>third time was just as good as the</p>
<p>second yeah i just saw the other</p>
<p>day and it was</p>
<p>maybe funnier</p>
<p>than the first time i saw it i forgot how</p>
<p>funny it was</p>
<p>maybe i saw too</p>
<p>close to each</p>
<p>other a lot of it was</p>
<p>shocking yeah it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>more at twice</p>
<p>you know we saw more at once and then</p>
<p>again five years</p>
<p>later i tried</p>
<p>to do that i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enjoy it i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enjoy it the</p>
<p>second time but i</p>
<p>loved it so much the first time</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>things that you can&rsquo;t see twice</p>
<p>but certain</p>
<p>things you can see over and over and over</p>
<p>again you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny comedy is a very</p>
<p>funny thing like that you know</p>
<p>like why is like really bad stuff</p>
<p>like roadhouse</p>
<p>or like show girls or something like that like</p>
<p>the more you see it the funnier it is</p>
<p>you know you can see it like a</p>
<p>bunch of times and it gets funnier</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>start knowing the</p>
<p>script of it and you</p>
<p>wanna act it out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some movies that are so ridiculous</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going oh this one right here howard the duck this</p>
<p>is oh ducky</p>
<p>that movie what is it called the room</p>
<p>adventures in babysitting nobody</p>
<p>this this was recommended to me i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve talked about this</p>
<p>if you want a bad</p>
<p>movie go get this the room it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>genius we don&rsquo;t watch it by yourself it&rsquo;s not as fun</p>
<p>but if you watch it with some friends that are funny</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a genius</p>
<p>geniusly bad movie</p>
<p>apparently they have screenings</p>
<p>in hollywood</p>
<p>and they play that movie and people get there and they</p>
<p>quote the words</p>
<p>because everyone</p>
<p>knows the words and it&rsquo;s like a sort of rockyara</p>
<p>picture thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that bad hmm</p>
<p>you wanna borrow it</p>
<p>yeah well i</p>
<p>could just make a cup i mean what the can i</p>
<p>just look at it on my computer real</p>
<p>quick that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>illegal let me just look at it on my computer real</p>
<p>quick alrighty</p>
<p>i just want to observe</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not even do this online</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>people to get the</p>
<p>wrong impression here</p>
<p>everyone likes fight club</p>
<p>you know what man i&rsquo;ll tell you what i didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>fight club i liked it i liked it for a</p>
<p>while and then when i</p>
<p>found out that</p>
<p>the two dudes were actually one dude</p>
<p>i was like what fuck you</p>
<p>man i didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>it anymore so i liked it up</p>
<p>until the end that</p>
<p>movie rules dude</p>
<p>that movie i didn&rsquo;t like it after i</p>
<p>found out that there were supposed to be two dudes</p>
<p>inside cause he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>punching himself in the face and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like what</p>
<p>yes that was</p>
<p>way more believable the problem is you&rsquo;re seeing a</p>
<p>bunch of shit</p>
<p>in this movie that didn&rsquo;t really happen but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>style of it the visuals but it&rsquo;s a she&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the airplane</p>
<p>in a plane it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>shitty plot</p>
<p>the ending to me is like yeah that sucks</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not what i wanted to be</p>
<p>but everything else</p>
<p>along the way was so amazing that you can&rsquo;t see it</p>
<p>required a suspension</p>
<p>of disbelief that i wasn&rsquo;t willing to give it</p>
<p>when all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re telling me that</p>
<p>everything i saw</p>
<p>was just his imagination</p>
<p>so this entire</p>
<p>movie what was real out of this fucking</p>
<p>movie cause in the</p>
<p>movie i saw</p>
<p>there was two different people</p>
<p>and if one part of it was</p>
<p>absolutely a figment of his imagination</p>
<p>what the fuck what</p>
<p>about the rest of it</p>
<p>how do i know what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching anymore now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching nonsense</p>
<p>now you have this shitty plot device</p>
<p>where you can say oh</p>
<p>it was just a</p>
<p>dream oh he&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>crazy this is what&rsquo;s really happening</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hitting himself</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like what</p>
<p>so what has really happened this guy&rsquo;s just been</p>
<p>sitting around hitting himself there&rsquo;s been no real</p>
<p>fighting i think</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really going on i</p>
<p>think he just don&rsquo;t like seeing brad pitt get hurt dude</p>
<p>is a part of me you know like part of me</p>
<p>leave me alone</p>
<p>leave me alone</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>funny part about that</p>
<p>movie you know</p>
<p>that everybody&rsquo;s like liking</p>
<p>enjoying getting the fuck beat out of them</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy i love</p>
<p>it i would hope that that&rsquo;s not the case</p>
<p>in real life i hope there&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally real</p>
<p>fight clubs like that like</p>
<p>those old videos we used to see</p>
<p>about the fights in the yards the</p>

<p>great guy and we all love him very much and</p>
<p>really cool much</p>
<p>love to his wife</p>
<p>yeah much much love he was a really fun guy</p>
<p>he was a dude that was on my message</p>
<p>board from the beginning really</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t remember when he was</p>
<p>never there i mean i don&rsquo;t remember a time</p>
<p>there was one time where he</p>
<p>he took off for a while</p>
<p>yeah and i called him at home i got his</p>
<p>information from somebody i called him at home and i</p>

<p>according to his wife he had always wanted to be a</p>
<p>stand up comedian and that&rsquo;s</p>

<p>you know like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a good example of that</p>
<p>i consider you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>stand up comedy a few times</p>
<p>but i consider</p>
<p>you like an internet comedian because you make</p>
<p>these little</p>
<p>videos that are</p>
<p>funny and you put them up on the internet</p>
<p>well the problem is it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you spend so much time at five</p>
<p>hours you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>spending a ton of hours</p>
<p>just so you can get</p>
<p>three to five minutes in</p>
<p>front of eight people</p>
<p>i could spend the same amount of time</p>
<p>make a video</p>
<p>that thousands will see</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like why</p>
<p>would i want to do it on</p>
<p>stage when i</p>
<p>could do the same</p>
<p>thing on the internet and get</p>
<p>50 million times more people seeing it</p>
<p>right and then eventually</p>
<p>like i said with the ari</p>
<p>thing if you get enough people to see your show on</p>
<p>the internet you can develop like an in the community</p>
<p>and then you can go do a show show</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>kind of show that ari really needs to take advantage of</p>
<p>because ari has</p>
<p>a name i mean he&rsquo;s been opening up for me for years</p>
<p>right thousands of people have seen him because of that</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s been on the jim norton show</p>
<p>down and dirty with jim norton</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a lot of clips on the</p>
<p>internet and he&rsquo;s been on opie and anthony with me a</p>
<p>bunch of times he was on the last time when i was there</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s got enough</p>
<p>stuff happening that he</p>
<p>should have like a community</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just a matter of like</p>
<p>putting it together that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s so much better now that it&rsquo;s ever been before</p>
<p>you know for comedians</p>
<p>and my message</p>
<p>board is one of the best parts</p>
<p>about it and this dude outlaw</p>
<p>was one of the best parts</p>
<p>about my message</p>
<p>board he was a</p>
<p>great guy he was really funny</p>
<p>and he was just</p>
<p>we got a chance</p>
<p>to hang out with them in real life a few times</p>
<p>once way back in houston way way back in the day</p>
<p>that was how many years ago was that</p>
<p>seven seven years ago</p>
<p>and then again recently last year he came</p>
<p>to dallas and</p>
<p>one or two other times</p>
<p>other than that too</p>
<p>at least one but i can remember one of the saddest</p>
<p>things for me is</p>
<p>going to his facebook pages and his photos</p>
<p>i forgot for christmas last year i think</p>
<p>for christmas i sent him a</p>
<p>photo of me shaving my</p>
<p>chest going ooh</p>
<p>not really shaving my</p>
<p>chest but like a</p>
<p>photo of me</p>
<p>and just as a joke</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>our relationship all work</p>
<p>is on the internet</p>
<p>photoshops back and forth</p>
<p>silly photos and stuff</p>
<p>and so like then i went to his facebook and he has</p>
<p>that on his facebook page and i&rsquo;m like oh that fucking</p>
<p>photo i forgot</p>
<p>about that yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the cool things</p>
<p>about the message</p>
<p>board is like you know we have like</p>
<p>these online friends</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>really are online friends some of them you never meet</p>
<p>some of them they just</p>
<p>exist online and as long as your personality is cool</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re friendly and you&rsquo;re funny</p>
<p>you know you eventually get into the</p>
<p>whole mix there</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s encouraged</p>
<p>funniness and</p>
<p>and personality</p>
<p>and and openness and</p>
<p>the the idea you know that</p>
<p>you know you don&rsquo;t have to fucking get in</p>
<p>fights with everybody talk to online and that if you</p>
<p>do say something to somebody it better be</p>
<p>funny you know you</p>
<p>gonna be a douche</p>
<p>about something</p>
<p>should be really funny</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nice to have something like that and</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>to get a chance to meet cool people that i probably</p>
<p>would never meet in real life like you</p>
<p>or like outlaw you know or like you know</p>
<p>tony z or you know i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people man there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>met online bad</p>
<p>bobby you know</p>
<p>those really cool guys that i look forward to see</p>
<p>when i when i&rsquo;m in town and i see him it&rsquo;s fun to hang</p>
<p>with johnny rotten and</p>
<p>jen yeah jane flower and her husband</p>
<p>henry you know</p>
<p>i mean so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of people that we met that are really cool</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nice thing</p>
<p>to have cultivated you know and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just happy</p>
<p>that we got a chance to hang out with this guy and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m happy that</p>
<p>we were in his life</p>
<p>and that he took pleasure</p>
<p>in hanging out on my message</p>
<p>board and one of the best artists</p>
<p>one of the best artists i know too</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t making millions from his art</p>
<p>yeah he was a really creative guy just you know</p>
<p>first of all he was in oklahoma and he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel like he had a lot of opportunities around him</p>
<p>you know all the time he just didn&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>that many things were</p>
<p>available to him</p>
<p>but he was a</p>
<p>great guy man</p>
<p>sucks really does suck</p>
<p>yeah and he was fairly</p>
<p>young right</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s 30 my age 35</p>

<p>tastes good</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>tastes good to eat fucking cheeseburgers with shit</p>
<p>sauce and we always give ari a hard time</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s dude did you see the</p>

<p>he was in new york</p>
<p>going up a lot in new york yeah yeah</p>
<p>new york&rsquo;s pretty cool but</p>
<p>never to live</p>
<p>there i was</p>
<p>thinking about living there i was thinking</p>
<p>about making a move that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy people</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;d be good for him you know</p>
<p>maybe to do something totally different mix it up</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crazy that i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never experienced in my life</p>
<p>i get to be in a head</p>
<p>different head</p>
<p>space i used to like it i like it when</p>
<p>i go back there a little bit but</p>
<p>part of it is just i know people there</p>
<p>and i like it for a quick jolt</p>
<p>get in there and get out of there</p>
<p>i love going on opi and anthony i love meeting my old</p>
<p>pool playing</p>
<p>friends i&rsquo;d be an alcoholic immediately living here</p>
<p>it seems like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the only thing to do and plus</p>
<p>when we came</p>
<p>about off the</p>
<p>plane in california</p>
<p>after there</p>
<p>just seeing nature seeing</p>
<p>grassy fields and</p>
<p>trees i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>oh my god i didn&rsquo;t see any of that when i was in new</p>
<p>york well this is the perfect time to be driving around</p>
<p>california it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beautiful yeah</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s green</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if it sounds gay</p>
<p>but when i&rsquo;m getting the mail and it</p>
<p>smells like roses you&rsquo;re just like wow</p>
<p>this is so much better than shit</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s something to be said</p>
<p>definitely for that and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely something</p>
<p>to be said that it&rsquo;s not natural to live</p>
<p>stack 70 people on</p>
<p>top of each other</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve done like those</p>
<p>population density studies with rats</p>
<p>and they found that if they</p>
<p>have a certain amount of rats in a box everyone&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>but the more</p>
<p>rats you add to the box the more fucked up behavior</p>
<p>starts manifesting</p>
<p>itself it starts up</p>
<p>a lot of them become</p>
<p>neurotic they start like</p>
<p>tweaking and</p>
<p>some of them</p>
<p>like become nutty and they sit by themselves and</p>
<p>shake right like</p>
<p>they develop all this nutty</p>
<p>sensory overload</p>
<p>shit because there&rsquo;s too many rats that</p>
<p>start attacking each</p>
<p>other and getting violent</p>
<p>it gets bad</p>
<p>man and that&rsquo;s what happens with fucking people</p>
<p>when i was in</p>
<p>north carolina last week man ooh</p>
<p>a couple days ago i</p>
<p>love north carolina</p>
<p>you could smell it man it was nice</p>
<p>everybody was cool</p>
<p>spread out too</p>
<p>yeah you go to restaurants</p>
<p>how you doing how you doing can we help y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>would you like something to drink</p>
<p>like everyone&rsquo;s like kind</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s move there and hang out with</p>
<p>cliffy b no</p>

<p>that&rsquo;s a good club easily</p>

<p>would suck is it hurricanes</p>
<p>oh fuck and</p>
<p>that sucks hard dude yeah one of the waitresses</p>
<p>at the place we</p>
<p>ate this cool barbecue place</p>
<p>and the waitress</p>
<p>said to us that</p>
<p>a hurricane came and</p>
<p>picked up her neighbor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and dropped it in a pond</p>
<p>with them in it</p>
<p>they were in</p>
<p>their fucking</p>
<p>house it picked is</p>
<p>not a mobile</p>
<p>house a house</p>
<p>picked their</p>
<p>house up and fucking flew it like</p>
<p>30 yards down</p>
<p>the road into a pond you know i totally forgot</p>
<p>about storms</p>
<p>i just hate being around tornadoes and storms</p>
<p>fucking weather living in ohio</p>
<p>has raped me of</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m scared of fucking</p>
<p>lightning now because i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just been through so much fucking crap you know what</p>
<p>the move is i</p>
<p>think the move is a</p>
<p>smaller town in</p>
<p>california i</p>
<p>think san diego or</p>
<p>santa barbara</p>
<p>san diego is not bad but san</p>
<p>diego is so close to</p>
<p>santa barbara</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a bad one</p>
<p>santa barbara is a good call</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good call because it&rsquo;s still like</p>
<p>they have good restaurants</p>
<p>great zoo university up</p>
<p>there so yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a university</p>
<p>up there so that people could that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good jail i love that jail it&rsquo;s awesome look how</p>
<p>clean right</p>
<p>the there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>university up there a couple i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s more than one</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>yeah and then there&rsquo;s wine</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>jiu jitsu up there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no comedy</p>
<p>club up there but you can do so make your own yeah</p>
<p>fucking campfire joe</p>
<p>campfire this</p>
<p>point i&rsquo;m really seriously thinking</p>
<p>about getting some a regular gig somewhere</p>
<p>just have a campfire</p>
<p>a campfire in a winery</p>
<p>tickets are</p>
<p>twenty five dollars</p>
<p>you are just you know</p>
<p>doing a gig like in</p>
<p>vegas like every week</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>time she could do it</p>
<p>every week because new people come in every week</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s always people coming in but yeah</p>
<p>vegas is just so bad for you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so bad for you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not good to stay there</p>
<p>vegas is like it&rsquo;s like smoking cigarettes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you can get away with it for a long time</p>
<p>but eventually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get you</p>
<p>you know or you</p>
<p>could not do it and</p>
<p>then you get hit by a bus tomorrow and you&rsquo;re like i</p>
<p>should have done it</p>
<p>oh i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;d ever say i</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>moved to vegas</p>
<p>but i think</p>
<p>doing a gig in</p>
<p>vegas even if i did it i</p>
<p>still wouldn&rsquo;t live there</p>
<p>right i would fly in and you know do it on the weekends</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do like one of those five</p>
<p>night a week gigs</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do five</p>
<p>nights a week i&rsquo;ll lose my marbles for sure</p>
<p>right you know five</p>
<p>nights a week</p>
<p>dude i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna be funny</p>
<p>you know comedy</p>
<p>a lot of it is</p>
<p>based on enthusiasm</p>
<p>and i think if i did every</p>
<p>night i had to do five</p>
<p>nights a week</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i</p>
<p>would be as enthusiastic</p>
<p>i like little days off sometimes and a weekend off here</p>
<p>and it gets the</p>
<p>juices all fired up and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best way to try to create new material too you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>create new material if you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>doing long headline sets all the time i</p>
<p>think the better way to do it is to just</p>
<p>really sit down try to</p>
<p>break out some</p>
<p>new ideas then just go up and try them on</p>
<p>their own you know</p>
<p>and so i used to introduce them to bits but sometimes</p>
<p>you know introduce</p>
<p>them like in the middle of bits and i</p>
<p>still do that sometimes but i think</p>
<p>maybe the best way to do it is just go on stage like</p>
<p>some crappy open mic night</p>
<p>or something like that you know</p>
<p>you gotta make sure there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>i was i think i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do that at the improv</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>the ideas a new shit show</p>
<p>do a show real</p>
<p>cheap so that the club gets something like five</p>
<p>bucks or something like that and then</p>
<p>just work on all new material</p>
<p>you know not even have an opening act nothing</p>
<p>you know just me go up</p>
<p>enough like an hour and a half or something like that</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking about doing that i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that might be</p>
<p>a good move i want to try all sorts of different</p>
<p>stuff to come up with new material you know</p>
<p>i mean you can only</p>
<p>get an isolation</p>
<p>tank so many</p>
<p>times you only look online so many times i want to</p>
<p>canoe i miss</p>
<p>canoeing like</p>
<p>crazy you ever get really</p>
<p>stone and go canoeing</p>
<p>no it is the best man</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just going</p>
<p>through nature in this in this boat</p>
<p>and once in a</p>
<p>while gets crazy</p>
<p>right oh we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna die no then you&rsquo;re back to peace</p>
<p>it is so fun i&rsquo;m not into</p>
<p>like putting myself into that oh my god you&rsquo;re almost</p>
<p>gonna die no no</p>
<p>no but canoeing is like</p>
<p>i mean it just gets a little</p>
<p>rapidy like you&rsquo;re like this</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>real fools and</p>
<p>stuff people died</p>

<p>and her head somehow another got wedged</p>
<p>between two rocks and she got</p>

<p>canoe tip over</p>
<p>you just don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>this you don&rsquo;t like the hickey water</p>
<p>no you know another</p>
<p>thing it would</p>
<p>freak me out is that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>that vbs tv show</p>
<p>about the arctic</p>
<p>remember there was that one dude</p>
<p>i think his name is hindmo</p>
<p>and he lives</p>
<p>in alaska and</p>
<p>northeast alaska</p>
<p>their daughter</p>
<p>fell off the boat when</p>
<p>she was two</p>
<p>years old they were living up there in the fucking</p>
<p>the yukon whatever</p>
<p>the hell it is up there what is it called up there</p>
<p>north and arctic whatever the fuck it is i mean</p>
<p>these weight in the arctic circle whatever</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s way the fuck up there deep deep deep into alaska</p>
<p>and his they were on a</p>
<p>river with a</p>
<p>canoe and the fucking</p>
<p>canoe tipped over and their</p>
<p>daughter was two years old and she drowned</p>
<p>and all they ever</p>
<p>found was her little boot</p>
<p>and that killed me that</p>
<p>story killed me</p>
<p>and every year they go to this site</p>
<p>like near where it happened and they</p>
<p>plant flowers</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t flowers they had</p>
<p>like ribbons</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no flowers up there</p>
<p>and it was sad as fuck man</p>
<p>watching them cry</p>
<p>and they had two</p>
<p>grown daughters like they</p>
<p>added to two</p>
<p>daughters afterwards</p>
<p>but it still</p>
<p>crushed them</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>their two year old that</p>
<p>drowned in their canoe</p>
<p>fuck a canoe</p>
<p>no no no no</p>
<p>no not interested</p>
<p>not interested in putting my life at risk</p>
<p>for some fucking natural</p>
<p>river ride thrill</p>
<p>not interesting no</p>
<p>mean i understand that this</p>
<p>might be a thrill</p>
<p>but my my logic</p>
<p>will not let me get past the</p>
<p>risk to benefit</p>
<p>ratio i look at it and i get</p>
<p>angry at myself even thinking</p>
<p>about trying it</p>
<p>just seems like it&rsquo;s dumb</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>so good luck on your boat faggot</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>2012 tour with stanhope is</p>
<p>last time stanhope and i talked</p>

<p>world would be that the world wouldn&rsquo;t end</p>

<p>i i thought it was a bad book i thought that guy</p>
<p>sounds like he&rsquo;s a nut</p>
<p>sounds like either he&rsquo;s crazy or</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a disinformation guy and</p>
<p>there are people without a</p>
<p>doubt who are paid</p>
<p>to say things that seem like nonsense</p>
<p>and say those nonsense things</p>
<p>along with things that do make</p>
<p>sense and are true and real and</p>
<p>thereby the</p>
<p>nonsense discredits the real information so you know</p>
<p>if someone says like did you know that you know</p>
<p>the government did this in 1970</p>
<p>and then you can go oh really</p>
<p>where&rsquo;d you read that</p>
<p>well i read it from william cooper&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>is that the guy that believes there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>alien bases on the moon that are</p>
<p>watching us and that there&rsquo;s information that they have</p>
<p>given us to</p>
<p>come on man</p>
<p>that guy sounds like a loon</p>
<p>he sounds fucking</p>
<p>crazy he&rsquo;s a guy that</p>
<p>also said that the driver is the one who killed kennedy</p>
<p>he believes that the driver</p>
<p>the driver turn around shot kennedy</p>
<p>and he could</p>
<p>clearly see it as a pruder film</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s nuts</p>
<p>he says shit that&rsquo;s so nutty</p>
<p>i have to believe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one or two options either he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely out</p>
<p>of his fucking mind and people just believed him</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s a plant</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a guy that</p>
<p>they hired to distribute disinformation to make</p>
<p>things and theories appear</p>
<p>ridiculous it&rsquo;s very possible that he&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely people that do that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people that have</p>
<p>admitted that the government hires people to blog</p>
<p>hires people to</p>
<p>go online and post on message</p>
<p>boards and debate issues</p>
<p>you know anytime anything specific</p>
<p>comes up you know they have guys that they&rsquo;ll send</p>
<p>on that issue if they believe that this is</p>
<p>you know causing dissent and some sort of a</p>
<p>you know meme of consciousness that they can avoid</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;ll attack it they&rsquo;ll try to discredit</p>
<p>things you know this is</p>
<p>means pretty</p>
<p>standard i mean they</p>
<p>would have to do that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got to realize how big the internet is</p>
<p>you have that fucking hard drive</p>
<p>noise my computers</p>
<p>yeah flash players of</p>
<p>power yeah safari</p>
<p>fuck you they want me to</p>

<p>quake 2 in your browser</p>
<p>60 frames per</p>
<p>second just</p>
<p>going to a website</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>the government is i wonder if you&rsquo;re telling the</p>
<p>truth let me</p>
<p>start shaking my keys</p>
<p>every time i talk to you</p>
<p>shaking your keys</p>
<p>why does that help yeah</p>
<p>my friend i have to do that</p>
<p>cause like they</p>
<p>their mind wander so</p>
<p>shake my keys</p>
<p>i was just listening to this guys bro the government</p>
<p>is only out to protect itself from the rest of us</p>
<p>i wonder if he&rsquo;s being serious</p>
<p>some people really</p>
<p>think like that</p>
<p>the government</p>
<p>has to do that</p>
<p>otherwise people overthrow the government</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>whole idea is you&rsquo;re not supposed to say this but the</p>
<p>whole idea that everybody</p>
<p>should have a say</p>
<p>and how the</p>
<p>world works is ridiculous</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just too many</p>
<p>dummies out there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way to stop that</p>
<p>you know we have kind of bypassed nature</p>
<p>and the strong</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not only</p>
<p>strong survive anymore it&rsquo;s everybody survives</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like no matter what we try to keep you</p>
<p>going you know you</p>
<p>could be the dumbest</p>
<p>motherfucker ever and we try to keep you going</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t always used to be the case and i</p>
<p>think because it is the case you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just way too many dummies</p>
<p>a regular democracy just isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to work</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why the government is</p>
<p>completely full of</p>
<p>shit and why there&rsquo;s just such a cash grab at the top</p>
<p>and why you know why they</p>
<p>still push war and why they</p>
<p>still because they know</p>
<p>they know that there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way this fucking</p>
<p>system is supposed to be working</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t have a regular real democracy</p>
<p>people are too dumb</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>sarah palin</p>
<p>thing proves all that</p>
<p>you know look how many people are into that</p>
<p>check that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing you</p>
<p>would think that in</p>
<p>a society in 2010</p>
<p>that someone who</p>
<p>literally doesn&rsquo;t read at all like you</p>
<p>would find out</p>
<p>about that you&rsquo;d be like get that</p>
<p>crazy bitch out of here</p>
<p>she can&rsquo;t be president</p>
<p>but no people love it they love her more than ever</p>
<p>what i agree</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve hit the wall with like</p>
<p>starting to go cross eyed dude</p>
<p>so weak you need to take vitamins man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot a lot of time no but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just say that we&rsquo;re not even hit the two hour mark</p>
<p>these people are listening to us and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bored now huh</p>
<p>you should be over</p>
<p>listening people download this shit on ipod</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m tired talking</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m tired it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that big</p>
<p>idea why you to make it we</p>
<p>have the longest podcast in the history of the internet</p>
<p>no you know that that&rsquo;s not just true</p>
<p>no yes go like somebody must have had a longer</p>
<p>woman never</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>never okay you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>silly just kidding</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some guy talking about 9 11 its podcast</p>
<p>is nine hours long</p>
<p>does it every day</p>
<p>yeah we will not be suppressed</p>
<p>do you see that interview with alex jones</p>
<p>on something the other cnn yeah yeah what was it like</p>
<p>somebody said it right</p>
<p>that 98 of time he&rsquo;s 99 right right you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>might have paraphrased and made it much better</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna use that now that but that&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s really what it is a certain</p>
<p>point in time</p>
<p>you know you got</p>
<p>to listen to some of the shit that he says he&rsquo;s writing</p>
<p>about a lot of shit</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>crazy it&rsquo;s hard to take him seriously</p>
<p>you know everybody&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s alex</p>
<p>jones up this information agent</p>
<p>i hope not cause i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s my friend</p>
<p>if it turns out he&rsquo;s just a different information</p>
<p>agent he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>fucking with me the</p>
<p>whole time that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous you</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>definitely been</p>
<p>friends with me instead of the government you dummy</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m way more fun to hang out with in the government</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make money off the government he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>entertaining orator</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>entertaining</p>
<p>speaker i enjoy listening to him talk</p>
<p>he gets fucking</p>
<p>crazy about shit</p>
<p>and some of his</p>
<p>videos are pretty goddamn jam up</p>
<p>some of his</p>
<p>videos are pretty goddamn good</p>
<p>have you ever</p>
<p>watched nine one one the road to conspiracy or</p>
<p>the road to</p>
<p>what was it called i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched them but roading conspiracy</p>
<p>is what it should be called</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve watched it to me but you know there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>point there comes to a</p>
<p>point you can&rsquo;t believe anybody</p>
<p>cause you weren&rsquo;t there and you</p>
<p>could believe this side or that</p>
<p>so to me i just become you know what</p>
<p>avoids each</p>
<p>other i don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>well my concern</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t even the 911</p>
<p>stuff it was the</p>
<p>stuff on the</p>
<p>world trade organization</p>
<p>it was the stuff on</p>
<p>these people that were paid to</p>
<p>disrupt peaceful protests</p>
<p>they would hire cops to go in and</p>
<p>dress up as</p>
<p>people with ski masks on</p>
<p>start smashing cars and shit</p>
<p>and he documents it all and really</p>
<p>fucking exposes the shit out of it</p>
<p>and apparently it&rsquo;s a common tactic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>know whenever there&rsquo;s a demonstration anywhere</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ever anything important ever with involving</p>
<p>world leaders</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there always a violence in</p>
<p>these demonstrations</p>
<p>even if the people that are into this idea are</p>
<p>completely non violent</p>
<p>you know even if it&rsquo;s buddhists</p>
<p>you know against you know</p>
<p>fucking something that you know that&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>china and they</p>
<p>all only buddhists show up and protest real buddhists</p>
<p>still someone will be</p>
<p>smashing windows</p>
<p>and some shit will happen will they have to</p>
<p>bring in cops</p>
<p>and the reason why is</p>
<p>cause they do that they do that</p>
<p>to make a non violent</p>
<p>protest a violent one</p>
<p>so they can</p>
<p>break it up</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s real shit</p>
<p>the government&rsquo;s been doing that forever that is</p>
<p>so fucking corrupt</p>
<p>so wrong on so many levels</p>
<p>and yet you</p>
<p>never even hear</p>
<p>about it they</p>
<p>throw people in jail left and</p>
<p>right for not paying</p>
<p>their taxes</p>
<p>when was the last time anybody got thrown in jail</p>
<p>for being a provocateur</p>
<p>you know what was the last time that you got thrown</p>
<p>in jail for being you know a professional anarchist</p>
<p>you know for being someone who gets hired to go up and</p>
<p>cause chaos and</p>
<p>create drama so they can have an excuse</p>
<p>that shit should be</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like fucking treason</p>
<p>that really is that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like slavery</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you are faking shit and fucking shit up and people are</p>
<p>gonna get locked in a cage because of you</p>
<p>because of what you did you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken away their freedom</p>
<p>even temporarily some of them are actually</p>
<p>gonna go to jail for long periods of time</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna create</p>
<p>trumped up charges of violence on them</p>
<p>because of some shit that you guys caused</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tyranny that&rsquo;s that really is treason</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a person who</p>
<p>should not be allowed to be an american</p>
<p>you know you are you are corrupting</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great about</p>
<p>what america&rsquo;s supposed to</p>
<p>stand for you fucking cunt</p>
<p>right meow he&rsquo;s done</p>

<p>we need to get you some supplements</p>
<p>i know dude</p>
<p>what i have nothing anymore you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even have pots</p>
<p>and pans anymore i recently had a roommate move out</p>
<p>and your roommate took</p>
<p>everything everything</p>
<p>was it all your</p>
<p>stuff well like</p>
<p>most of the big</p>
<p>stuff is mine but when you realize oh</p>
<p>no pots and pans oh no dish soap</p>
<p>oh no toilet</p>
<p>paper oh no oh it&rsquo;s gotta</p>
<p>start from scratch</p>
<p>yeah and you don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re missing though</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>wow very crazy</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>weird thing man when you live with somebody</p>
<p>for three years</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>break up and</p>
<p>then they move out and you&rsquo;re like wow now what yeah</p>
<p>fucking now what</p>
<p>yeah gets strange you know it gets really</p>
<p>weird how you become so comfortable with</p>
<p>living with somebody you</p>
<p>well not only that you</p>
<p>get so accustomed to having that person in your life</p>
<p>we addict to each</p>
<p>other you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people get so terrified when people want to</p>
<p>break up right you</p>
<p>know people get terrified they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m addicted to you and my life will be hell</p>
<p>if you leave</p>
<p>you know and that&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sometimes you know sometimes people</p>
<p>obsess on relationships for long periods of time but</p>
<p>god so so much more often</p>
<p>when the relationship is over you feel so much better</p>
<p>once it levels out dude</p>
<p>like what the hell is</p>
<p>going on i want to fucking go</p>
<p>canoeing and then</p>
<p>maybe roller skating</p>
<p>or something well you were involved in a situation</p>
<p>where i mean i don&rsquo;t know how much you want to talk</p>
<p>about it but you were involved in a situation</p>
<p>where you felt like</p>
<p>the person he</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t very happy</p>
<p>oh yeah totally</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a pretty easygoing</p>
<p>kind of silly guy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>too in having</p>
<p>a relationship</p>
<p>with someone sometimes who&rsquo;s really struggling</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t have to get up at a specific time</p>
<p>every day well</p>
<p>that seems like that&rsquo;s the problem with</p>
<p>my whole life now because now</p>
<p>most people have nine to five jobs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>think that like</p>
<p>oh this person didn&rsquo;t well a nine to five that you</p>
<p>enjoy is not that bad you know</p>
<p>those people are usually</p>
<p>fairly fun right you know or at</p>
<p>least fairly</p>
<p>happy but a nine to five that you hate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>sauce man that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>sauce to solve</p>
<p>it gets to a</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>too much of a percentage of your day is</p>
<p>pushed into the negative zone</p>
<p>and you start</p>
<p>dragging that negativity it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not like you just shut it off at the end of the day</p>
<p>and all of a</p>
<p>sudden be super positive</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re kind of beaten down by a boring ass day</p>
<p>and at the end</p>
<p>of the week you get this paycheck and it&rsquo;s like 300</p>
<p>you like what yeah 300</p>
<p>and they take the</p>
<p>taxes out and that&rsquo;s what you got left yeah</p>
<p>you gave us your</p>
<p>whole week and we give you 300</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like it you know and you&rsquo;re uncomfortable physically</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many issues that people have to go through</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fucking hard man</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>other solution</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>this everyone</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really figure it out</p>
<p>and find some job that they</p>
<p>truly love there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>people that are in jobs that they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>because if they&rsquo;re not there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i mean we need to keep this fucking society rolling</p>
<p>and you know and there&rsquo;s a lot of shit that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do there&rsquo;s a lot of shit that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna do it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna have to get done if we</p>
<p>wanna have a society like this</p>
<p>unless we develop</p>
<p>robots i mean is that the future where</p>
<p>robots do all the jobs that suck</p>
<p>and then the only people that are left are what</p>
<p>the creators the people that create things</p>
<p>what the fuck becomes of it</p>
<p>craftsmen artist creatives doctors</p>
<p>engineers scientists</p>
<p>people that create new computers and fix the</p>
<p>stuff that we have</p>
<p>technicians</p>
<p>and then what else</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t need burger king workers anymore</p>
<p>you know i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get to a</p>
<p>point but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the case</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need anybody to do anything that sucks</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the deal with the longest census</p>
<p>survey that they&rsquo;re making you</p>
<p>fill out like they make you fill it out yeah it says</p>
<p>it says it&rsquo;s the law</p>
<p>yeah is there is it like not doing your</p>
<p>taxes kind of law or i don&rsquo;t know man</p>
<p>until they can</p>
<p>count mexicans they</p>
<p>could suck my dick</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know how many people are here you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna tell me that through your little pieces of</p>
<p>paper you got it all figured out that&rsquo;s nonsense</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many mexicans here that have</p>
<p>snuck across the border</p>
<p>and until you can</p>
<p>count them why</p>
<p>are we playing games why are we pretending</p>
<p>that you know so i can wipe my ass with the census</p>
<p>shit i just</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s silly</p>

<p>to figure out when&rsquo;s the best time for me to do it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be like one day a week for six weeks i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do it it&rsquo;ll be on</p>
<p>probably on raw dog</p>
<p>and if it goes well</p>
<p>and if they like it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll consider doing it every week</p>
<p>and keep doing that</p>
<p>i just want to do more shit like this my only</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;m gonna say to them is i</p>
<p>just want to be able to put it out as a podcast as well</p>
<p>and if that&rsquo;s possible then i&rsquo;ll do it yeah</p>
<p>very good money yeah and well</p>
<p>this is a real podcast to me people i get all these</p>
<p>emails from people sell me they listen on the subway</p>
<p>and that they you know they listen</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>yeah if you&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>this is from a webcam show this is just the wall</p>
<p>audio this is</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve done no engineering</p>
<p>but you know what</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s important i</p>
<p>think what&rsquo;s important is</p>
<p>the things i like most when</p>
<p>i listen to like opie and anthony or bubba the love</p>
<p>sponge or anything like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when they&rsquo;re in the middle of a conversation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an interesting conversation and i enjoy</p>
<p>the point of views and</p>
<p>the arguments and the disagreements and you know the</p>
<p>revelations that</p>
<p>these guys have</p>
<p>i like shows like that that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>wanna hear i don&rsquo;t really care if it&rsquo;s produced well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all nonsense to me i just</p>
<p>wanna i just</p>
<p>wanna listen to people be honest</p>
<p>and i wanna see if i</p>
<p>think the way they</p>
<p>think or if i can</p>
<p>learn something from the way they think</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna try to do that so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do that</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m right</p>
<p>about to do a deal to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not been totally</p>
<p>finalized but almost real close</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>write a book so i&rsquo;m in the middle doing that too i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get that shit</p>
<p>cranking i&rsquo;ve been writing for a</p>
<p>while but now it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the deals like actually</p>
<p>finalized and i have it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taken a forum so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be difficult and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna try to</p>
<p>update my website with more like little quick</p>
<p>videos and shit</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll be harder to just keep writing</p>
<p>things over and over and over again</p>
<p>so the next show i&rsquo;ve got is this weekend i&rsquo;m doing the</p>
<p>kevin beans</p>
<p>kevin and beans</p>
<p>april foolishness at the universal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like universal amphitheater or some shit like</p>
<p>that so what it is</p>
<p>did it last year was awesome</p>
<p>those guys are</p>
<p>great they&rsquo;re awesome</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>funny comics on but</p>
<p>i believe the shit sold out son</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m headlining it so</p>
<p>which is always interesting</p>
<p>people get tired</p>
<p>and also there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>topics are to get</p>
<p>covered off to</p>
<p>bring up price</p>
