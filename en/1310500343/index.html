    <p>The following is a conversation with Bjorn Lomborg</p>
<p>and Andrew Refkin on the topic of climate change.</p>
<p>It is framed as a debate,</p>
<p>but with the goal of having a nuanced conversation</p>
<p>talking with each other, not at each other.</p>
<p>I hope to continue having debates like these,</p>
<p>including on controversial topics.</p>
<p>I believe in the power of conversation</p>
<p>to bring people together,</p>
<p>not to convince one side or the other,</p>
<p>but to enlighten both with the insights</p>
<p>and wisdom that each hold.</p>
<p>Bjorn Lomborg is the president</p>
<p>of Copenhagen Consensus Think Tank</p>
<p>and author of False Alarm, Cool It,</p>
<p>and Skeptical Environmentalist.</p>
<p>Please check out his work at lomborg.com</p>
<p>that includes his books, articles, and other writing.</p>
<p>Andrew Refkin is one of the most respected journalists</p>
<p>in the world on the topic of climate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been writing about global environmental change</p>
<p>and risk for more than 30 years,</p>
<p>20 of it at the New York Times.</p>
<p>Please check out his work in the Linktree</p>
<p>that includes his books, articles, and other writing.</p>
<p>And now a quick few second mention of his sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got Asleep for NAPS, Linode for Linux,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for biological data,</p>
<p>and Onnit for supplements.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I hate those.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them, please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This episode is sponsored by</p>
<p>an old and favorite sponsor of mine</p>
<p>that brings so much joy to my heart to eight sleep,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s new Pod3 mattress.</p>
<p>They recently launched this new generation of mattress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a source of so much pleasure for me.</p>
<p>I know it because when it&rsquo;s gone, I miss it.</p>
<p>I remember how much joy it brings to my world,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s through a short power nap</p>
<p>or a great night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Warm blanket, cold bed surface</p>
<p>with the rain gently falling outside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll even sometimes drink a coffee right before,</p>
<p>and I pass out for 20 minutes,</p>
<p>and I wake up a new human being.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that works.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if everyone enjoys naps as much as I do,</p>
<p>but they work for me,</p>
<p>and sometimes it can make the difference</p>
<p>between a mind that is cynical</p>
<p>and is really struggling with life and the world</p>
<p>to a mind that is open to the possibilities</p>
<p>and the beauty of the world.</p>
<p>I do that on an eight sleep bed.</p>

<p>This episode is also brought to you by Linode,</p>
<p>Linux virtual machines.</p>
<p>Why is it that my heart fills with joy</p>
<p>anytime I think about Linux</p>
<p>and the great provider of cloud Linux systems,</p>
<p>that is Linode, if you need to do any kind of compute.</p>
<p>Just the interface is super easy to use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super reliable, easy to monitor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tech support, of course,</p>
<p>and that tech support is not just every once in a while,</p>
<p>or whenever they feel like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always 24-7, 365, real human beings, just incredible.</p>
<p>Everything is clear, everything is easy to use.</p>
<p>The world runs on Linux.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just a bunch of human biological systems</p>
<p>having fun with our little pursuits</p>
<p>and daily habits and rituals and so on,</p>
<p>but all of that, just like fish swim in water,</p>
<p>humans in this modern 21st century technological age</p>
<p>are swimming in compute.</p>
<p>That makes almost no sense, but in a way it does,</p>

<p>that paints a beautiful painting that previews the future,</p>
<p>because in the future, my friends,</p>
<p>all the recommendations, all the wisdom,</p>
<p>the advice, the mentorship you will need</p>
<p>about the future trajectory of your life,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s lifestyle, health, diet, medical, all of it,</p>
<p>I think all of that will come from your body,</p>
<p>and InsideTracker collects data from your body</p>
<p>through blood tests.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting blood data, DNA data, fitness tracker data,</p>
<p>all of that to make recommendations.</p>
<p>This is what the future will be like.</p>
<p>Obviously, it has to be done in a way</p>
<p>that preserves the privacy and respects</p>
<p>your ownership of the data,</p>
<p>but outside of that, once that is done,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a must, once that is done,</p>
<p>then the recommendations through machine learning</p>
<p>based on this data will be so, so much better</p>
<p>than the 20th century way of doing science,</p>
<p>which is based on population data versus you,</p>
<p>the beautiful, unique flower of an individual that is you.</p>

<p>a nutrition, supplement, and fitness company.</p>
<p>I first heard of Onnit from Mr. Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of incredible to know that I&rsquo;m now doing</p>
<p>an ad read for Onnit on this very podcast.</p>
<p>I take AlphaBrain every once in a while</p>
<p>when I need a super boost for my mind,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a long session.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing more and more and more programming lately,</p>
<p>and when there&rsquo;s a long session</p>
<p>of a difficult programming task,</p>
<p>or also sometimes really having to think during debugging.</p>
<p>So those can be really exhausting.</p>
<p>So sometimes I&rsquo;ll take an AlphaBrain</p>
<p>to help me through that process.</p>
<p>It is what it is, my friends.</p>
<p>Those sessions can be super exhausting,</p>
<p>but super gratifying, so.</p>
<p>In general, I don&rsquo;t take AlphaBrain every day.</p>
<p>Coffee in the morning, and just focus and focus and focus.</p>
<p>I try to rely on the power of my mind,</p>
<p>but sometimes it&rsquo;s definitely a big help.</p>
<p>I enjoy it.</p>
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s a nootropic that helps support memory,</p>
<p>mental speed, and focus.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Bjorn Lomberg</p>
<p>and Andrew Rufkin.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a spectrum of belief on the topic of climate change,</p>
<p>and the landscape of that spectrum</p>
<p>has probably changed over several decades.</p>
<p>On one extreme, there&rsquo;s a belief</p>
<p>that climate change is a hoax.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not human-caused.</p>
<p>To pile on top of that, there&rsquo;s a belief</p>
<p>that institutions, scientific, political, the media,</p>
<p>are corrupt and are kind of constructing this fabrication.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one extreme.</p>
<p>And then the other extreme,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a level of alarmism</p>
<p>about the catastrophic impacts of climate change</p>
<p>that lead to the extinction of human civilization.</p>
<p>So not just economic costs, hardship, suffering,</p>
<p>but literally the destruction of the human species</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s the spectrum.</p>
<p>And I would love to find the center.</p>
<p>And my sense is,</p>
<p>and the reason I wanted to talk to the two of you,</p>
<p>aside from the humility with which you approach this topic,</p>
<p>is I feel like you&rsquo;re close to the center</p>
<p>and are on different sides of that center,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s possible to define the center.</p>
<p>I feel like there is a political center</p>
<p>for center-left and center-right.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s very difficult to define,</p>
<p>but can you help me define what the extremes are again,</p>
<p>as they have changed over the years, what they are today,</p>
<p>and where&rsquo;s the center?</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Well, in a way, on this issue,</p>
<p>I think there is no center, except in this,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re looking on social media</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re looking on TV,</p>
<p>there are people who are trying to fabricate the idea</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a single question.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the first mistake.</p>
<p>We are developing a new relationship with the climate system</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re rethinking our energy systems.</p>
<p>And those are very disconnected in so many ways</p>
<p>that connect around climate change.</p>
<p>But the first way to me to overcome this idea</p>
<p>of there is this polarized universe around this issue</p>
<p>is to step back and say, well, what is this actually?</p>
<p>And when you do, you realize</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of an uncomfortable collision</p>
<p>between old energy norms and a growing awareness</p>
<p>of how the planet works,</p>
<p>that if you keep adding gases that are invisible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the bubbles in beer.</p>
<p>If you keep adding that to the atmosphere,</p>
<p>because it accumulates, that will change everything,</p>
<p>is changing everything for thousands of years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already happening.</p>
<p>What do you mean by bubbles in beer?</p>
<p>CO2, carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>Why beer?</p>
<p>Well, because I like beer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also in Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>We were talking about Cola before.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s innocuous.</p>
<p>We grew up with this idea is CO2,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re trapped in a room suffocating,</p>
<p>is an innocuous gas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s plant food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beer bubbles.</p>
<p>And the idea we can swiftly transition to a world</p>
<p>where that gas is a pollutant, regulated,</p>
<p>tamped down from the top is fantastical.</p>
<p>Having looked at this for 35 years,</p>
<p>I brought along one of my tokens.</p>
<p>This is my 1988 cover story on global warming.</p>
<p>The greenhouse effect, this cover, 1988.</p>
<p>Jim Hansen, the famous American climate scientist,</p>
<p>really, he stimulated this article</p>
<p>by doing this dramatic testimony</p>
<p>in a Senate committee that summer,</p>
<p>in May, actually, spring, late spring.</p>
<p>It was a hot day, and it got headlines,</p>
<p>and this was the result.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>Look what we were selling on the back cover.</p>
<p>What you see is when you get tobacco?</p>
<p>Cigarettes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tobacco, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Looking back at my own career on the climate question,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer a belief fight over</p>
<p>is global warming real or not?</p>
<p>You say, well, what kind of energy future do you want?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very different question than stop global warming.</p>
<p>And when you look at climate, actually,</p>
<p>I had this learning journey on my reporting</p>
<p>where I started out with this</p>
<p>as the definition of the problem.</p>
<p>You know, the 70s and 80s,</p>
<p>pollution was changing things that were making things bad.</p>
<p>So really focusing in on the greenhouse effect</p>
<p>and the pollution.</p>
<p>But what I missed, the big thing that I missed</p>
<p>of the first 15 years of my reporting,</p>
<p>from 1988 through about 2007,</p>
<p>when I was, that period I was at the New York Times</p>
<p>in the middle there,</p>
<p>was that we&rsquo;re building vulnerability</p>
<p>to climate hazards at the same time.</p>
<p>So climate is changing, but we&rsquo;re changing, too.</p>
<p>Where we are here in Austin, Texas is a great example.</p>
<p>Flash Flood Alley, named in the 1920s, west of here.</p>
<p>Everyone forgot about flash floods.</p>
<p>Built these huge developments, you know,</p>
<p>along these river basins.</p>
<p>Then one side starts saying global warming, global warming.</p>
<p>And the other side is not recognizing</p>
<p>that we built willfully, greedily,</p>
<p>vulnerability in places of utter hazard.</p>
<p>Same things played out in Pakistan</p>
<p>and in Fort Myers, Florida.</p>
<p>And you start to understand</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re creating a landscape of risk</p>
<p>as climate is changing.</p>
<p>Then it feels, oh my God, that&rsquo;s more complex, right?</p>
<p>But it also gives you more action points.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, well, we know how to design better.</p>
<p>We know that today&rsquo;s coasts won&rsquo;t be tomorrow&rsquo;s coasts.</p>
<p>Work with that.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s chart an energy future at the same time.</p>
<p>So the story became so different.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t become like, you know,</p>
<p>a story you could package into a magazine article or the like</p>
<p>and it just led me to a whole different way</p>
<p>of even my journalism changed over time.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t fight the belief disbelief fight anymore.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually kind of a waste.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way to start the discussion</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t about, to me, going forward from where we&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t about tipping that balance</p>
<p>back toward the center so much as finding opportunities</p>
<p>to just do something about this stuff.</p>
<p>What do you think, Bjorn?</p>
<p>Do you agree that it&rsquo;s multiple questions in one big question?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to define the center?</p>
<p>Where is the center?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s wonderful to hear Andy</p>
<p>sort of unconstruct the whole conversation</p>
<p>and say we should be worried about different things.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s exactly,</p>
<p>or we should be worried about things in a different way</p>
<p>that makes it much more useful.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s exactly the right way to think about it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and that was also</p>
<p>where you kind of ended,</p>
<p>we are stuck in a place where this very much</p>
<p>is the conversation right now.</p>
<p>And so I think in one sense,</p>
<p>certainly the people who used to say,</p>
<p>oh, this is not happening,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very, very small and diminishing crowd</p>
<p>and certainly not right.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I think to an increasing extent</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve gotten into a world where a lot of people</p>
<p>really think this is the end of times.</p>
<p>So the OECD did a new survey of all OECD countries</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s shocking.</p>
<p>So it shows that 60% of all people in the OECD,</p>
<p>so the rich world, believes that global warming</p>
<p>will likely or very likely lead to the extinction</p>
<p>of mankind.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s scary in a very, very clear way</p>
<p>because look, if this really is true,</p>
<p>if global warming is this meteor hurtling towards earth</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna be destroyed in 12 years</p>
<p>or whatever the number is today,</p>
<p>then clearly we should care about nothing else.</p>
<p>We should just be focusing on making sure</p>
<p>that that asteroid gets,</p>
<p>we should send up Bruce Willis and get this done with.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the way it is.</p>
<p>This is not actually what the UN climate panel tells us</p>
<p>or anything else.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s not so much about arcing against the people</p>
<p>who are saying it&rsquo;s a hoax.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really where I am.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s where Andy</p>
<p>or really where the conversation is.</p>
<p>But it is a question of sort of pulling people back</p>
<p>from this end of the world conversation</p>
<p>because it really skews our way</p>
<p>that we think about problems.</p>
<p>Also, if you really think this is the end of time</p>
<p>and you only have 12 years,</p>
<p>nothing that can only work in 13 years can be considered.</p>
<p>And the reality of most of what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>in climate and certainly our vulnerability,</p>
<p>certainly our energy system</p>
<p>is gonna be half to a full century.</p>
<p>And so when you talk to people and say,</p>
<p>well, but we&rsquo;re gonna, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really gonna go a lot more renewable</p>
<p>in the next half century.</p>
<p>They look at you and like,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what 38 years too late.</p>
<p>And I get that.</p>
<p>But so I think in your question,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m trying to do,</p>
<p>and I would imagine that&rsquo;s true for you as well,</p>
<p>is to try to pull people away from this precipice</p>
<p>and this end of the world and then open it up.</p>
<p>And I think Andy did that really well by saying,</p>
<p>look, there are so many different sub conversations</p>
<p>and we need to have all of them</p>
<p>and we need to be respectful of,</p>
<p>some of these are right</p>
<p>in the sort of standard media kind of way,</p>
<p>but some of them are very, very wrong.</p>
<p>And it actually means that we end up doing much less good,</p>
<p>both on climate,</p>
<p>but also on all the other problems the world faces.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and it just empowers people too.</p>
<p>Those who believe this then just sit back,</p>
<p>even in Adam McKay&rsquo;s movie, the Don&rsquo;t Look Up movie,</p>
<p>there was that sort of nihilist crowd</p>
<p>for those who&rsquo;ve seen it,</p>
<p>who just say, fuck this.</p>
<p>And a lot of people have that,</p>
<p>when something&rsquo;s too big,</p>
<p>and it just paralyzes you,</p>
<p>as opposed to giving you these action points.</p>
<p>And the other thing is,</p>
<p>I hate it when economists are right about stuff like this.</p>
<p>I&hellip;</p>
<p>I&hellip;</p>
<p>I&hellip;</p>
<p>I&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, there are these phrases,</p>
<p>like I never knew the words path dependency</p>
<p>until probably 10 years ago in my reporting.</p>
<p>And it basically says you&rsquo;re in a system,</p>
<p>the things around you,</p>
<p>how we pass laws,</p>
<p>the brokenness of the Senate.</p>
<p>Those are&hellip;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a climate crisis in America,</p>
<p>we have a decision crisis,</p>
<p>as it comes to how the government works or doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But those big features of our landscape are&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s path dependency.</p>
<p>When you screw in a light bulb,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s an LED light bulb,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going into a 113, 120 year old fixture,</p>
<p>and actually that fixture is almost designed,</p>
<p>if you look at 19th century gas fixtures,</p>
<p>they had this screw in thing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re on these long path dependencies</p>
<p>when it comes to energy and stuff like that,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t just magically transition a car fleet.</p>
<p>A car built today will last 40 years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll end up in Mexico,</p>
<p>sold as a used car, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so there is no quick fix,</p>
<p>even if we&rsquo;re true that things are coming to an end</p>
<p>in 13 years or 12 years or eight years.</p>
<p>So most people don&rsquo;t believe that climate change is a hoax,</p>
<p>so they believe that there is an increase,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a global warming of a few degrees</p>
<p>in the next century,</p>
<p>and then maybe debate about</p>
<p>what the number of the degrees is.</p>
<p>And do most people believe that it&rsquo;s human caused</p>
<p>at this time in this history of discussion of climate change?</p>
<p>So is that the center still?</p>
<p>Is there still debate on this?</p>
<p>Yale University, the climate communication group there</p>
<p>for like 13 years has done this Six Americas study</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ve charted pretty carefully</p>
<p>in ways that I really find useful,</p>
<p>what people believe.</p>
<p>And we could talk about the word belief</p>
<p>in the context of science too.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve identified kind of six kinds of us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s from dismissive to alarmed</p>
<p>and with lots of bubbles in between.</p>
<p>I think some of those bubbles in between</p>
<p>are mostly disengaged people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t really deal with the issue.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve shown a drift for sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more majority now at the alarmed</p>
<p>or engaged bubbles than the dismissive bubble.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a durable, like with vaccination</p>
<p>and lots of other issues,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a durable never anything belief group.</p>
<p>But on the reality that humans are contributing</p>
<p>to climate change, most Americans when you ask them,</p>
<p>and it also depends on how you write your survey.</p>
<p>Think there&rsquo;s a component.</p>
<p>And this is also true globally.</p>
<p>I mean, when you ask around, I mean,</p>
<p>and this is, if you hear this story</p>
<p>from the media of 20 years,</p>
<p>of course that&rsquo;s what you will believe.</p>
<p>And it also happens to be true.</p>
<p>That is what the science, I think,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s perhaps worth saying,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a little depressing that you always have to say,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s worth saying</p>
<p>that I think we both really do accept</p>
<p>the climate panel science.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s absolutely global warming.</p>
<p>It is an issue, and it&rsquo;s probably just worthwhile</p>
<p>to get it out of the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an issue, and it&rsquo;s caused by humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s caused by humans, yeah.</p>
<p>But vulnerability, the losses that are driven</p>
<p>by climate-related events still predominantly</p>
<p>are caused by humans, but on the ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where we build stuff, where we settle.</p>
<p>Pakistan, in 1960, I just looked these data up,</p>
<p>there were 40 million people in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Today there are 225 million,</p>
<p>and a big chunk of them are still rural.</p>
<p>They live in the floodplain of the amazing Indus River,</p>
<p>which comes down from the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Extraordinary 5,000-year history of agriculture there.</p>
<p>But when you put 200 million people in harm&rsquo;s way,</p>
<p>and this doesn&rsquo;t say anything about the bigger questions</p>
<p>about, oh, shame on Pakistan for having more people.</p>
<p>It just says the reality is the losses that we see</p>
<p>in the news are, and the science finds this,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s a new weather attribution group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s WXRISK on Twitter.</p>
<p>This does pretty good work on how much of what just happened</p>
<p>was some tweak in the storm from global warming,</p>
<p>from CO2 changing weather.</p>
<p>But, and the media glommed onto that,</p>
<p>as I did in the 80s, 90s, 2000s.</p>
<p>But the reports also have a section on, by the way,</p>
<p>the vulnerability that was built in this region</p>
<p>was a big driver of loss.</p>
<p>So discriminating between loss,</p>
<p>change in what&rsquo;s happening on the ground,</p>
<p>and change in the climate system,</p>
<p>is never solely about CO2.</p>
<p>In fact, Lorenz Bauer, B-O-U-W-E-R,</p>
<p>I first wrote on his work in 2010 in the New York Times.</p>
<p>And basically, in 2010, there was no sign in the data</p>
<p>of climate change driving disasters.</p>
<p>Climate change is up here, disasters are on the ground.</p>
<p>They depend on how many people are in the way,</p>
<p>how much stuff you built in the way.</p>
<p>And so far, we&rsquo;ve done so much of that so fast</p>
<p>in the 20th century, particularly,</p>
<p>that it completely dominates, it makes it hard,</p>
<p>impossible to discriminate how much of that disaster</p>
<p>was from the change in weather from global warming.</p>
<p>So a function of greenhouse gases</p>
<p>to human suffering is unclear.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very much in our control, theoretically.</p>
<p>I mean, the point, I think, is exactly right,</p>
<p>that if you look at the Hurricane Ian</p>
<p>that went through Florida, you have a situation</p>
<p>where Florida went from, what, 600,000 houses</p>
<p>in 1940 to 17 million houses.</p>
<p>Sorry, 10 million houses, so 17 times more</p>
<p>over, what, a period of 80 years?</p>
<p>Of course you&rsquo;re gonna have, what?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have lots more damage.</p>
<p>And many of these houses now have been built</p>
<p>on places where you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be building.</p>
<p>And so I think a lot of scientists are very focused</p>
<p>on saying, can we measure whether global warming</p>
<p>had an impact, which is an interesting science question.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very implausible that eventually</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t be able to say it has an impact.</p>
<p>But the real question, it seems to me,</p>
<p>is if we actually wanna make sure that people</p>
<p>are less harmed in the future, what are the levers</p>
<p>that we can control?</p>
<p>And it turns out that the CO2 lever,</p>
<p>doing something about climate, is an incredibly</p>
<p>difficult and slightly inefficient way</p>
<p>of trying to help these people in the future.</p>
<p>Whereas, of course, zoning, making sure</p>
<p>that you have better housing rules,</p>
<p>what is it, regulations, that you maybe don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have people building in the flash flood,</p>
<p>what was it called?</p>
<p>Flash flood alley.</p>
<p>Flash flood alley.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just simple stuff.</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;re so focused on this one issue,</p>
<p>we sort of, it almost feels sacrilegious</p>
<p>to talk about these other things that are much more</p>
<p>in our power and that we can do something</p>
<p>about much quicker and that would help a lot more people.</p>
<p>So I think this is gonna be a large part</p>
<p>of the whole conversation.</p>
<p>Yes, climate is a problem, but it&rsquo;s not the only problem.</p>
<p>And there are many other things where we can actually</p>
<p>have a much, much bigger impact at much lower cost.</p>
<p>Maybe we should also remember those.</p>
<p>Can you still man the case of Greta,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a representative of alarmism,</p>
<p>that we need that kind of level of alarmism</p>
<p>for people to pay attention and to think</p>
<p>about climate change?</p>
<p>So you said the singular view is not the correct way</p>
<p>to look at climate change, just the emissions.</p>
<p>But for us to have a discussion,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t there be somebody who&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>raising the concern?</p>
<p>Can you still man the case for alarmism, essentially?</p>
<p>Or is there a better term than alarmism?</p>
<p>Communication of like, holy shit,</p>
<p>we should be thinking about this.</p>
<p>So I think, I totally understand why Greta Thunberg</p>
<p>is doing what she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>I have great respect for her because I look at a lot</p>
<p>of kids growing up and they&rsquo;re basically being told,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna reach adulthood, or at least not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get very far into adulthood.</p>
<p>And that, of course, this is the meteor hurtling</p>
<p>towards Earth, and then this is the only thing</p>
<p>we should be focusing on.</p>
<p>I understand why she&rsquo;s making that argument.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s incorrect,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get around to talking about that.</p>
<p>And one of the things is, of course,</p>
<p>that her whole generation, I can understand</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re saying, if we&rsquo;re gonna be dead in 12 years,</p>
<p>why would I wanna study?</p>
<p>Why would I really care about anything?</p>
<p>So I totally want to sort of pull Greta and many others</p>
<p>out of this end of the world fear,</p>
<p>but I totally get why she&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s done a service in the sense</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s gotten more people to talk about climate,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s good, because we need to have this discussion.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s unfortunate, and this is just what happens</p>
<p>in almost all policy discussions, that they end up being</p>
<p>sort of discussions from the extreme groups,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just more fun on media</p>
<p>to have sort of the total deniers</p>
<p>and the people who say, we&rsquo;re gonna die tomorrow,</p>
<p>and it sort of becomes that discussion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more sort of a mud-wrestling fight.</p>
<p>So would you think the mud-wrestling fight is not useful</p>
<p>or is useful for communication,</p>
<p>for effective science communication,</p>
<p>on one of the platforms that you&rsquo;re a fan of,</p>
<p>which is Twitter?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wrote a piece recently in my Sustain What column</p>
<p>saying, if you go on there for the entertainment value</p>
<p>of seeing those knocked-down fights,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s useful, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>The thing I found Twitter invaluable for,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the workouts you do, or, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how do I put this tool to use today,</p>
<p>thinking about energy action in poor communities?</p>
<p>How do I put this tool today, learning about</p>
<p>what really happened with Ian the Hurricane,</p>
<p>who was most at risk?</p>
<p>And how would you build forward better?</p>
<p>I hate build back.</p>
<p>Or you can go there and just watch it</p>
<p>as an entertainment value.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna get the world anywhere.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think entertainment,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call it entertainment,</p>
<p>but giving voice to the extremes</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a productive way forward.</p>
<p>It seems to, you know, to push back against</p>
<p>the main narrative, it seems to work pretty well</p>
<p>in the American system.</p>
<p>We think politics is totally broken,</p>
<p>but maybe that works, that oscillation back and forth.</p>
<p>You need a Greta, and you need somebody</p>
<p>that pushes back against a Greta to get everybody&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>just to get everybody&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>The fun of battle over time creates progress.</p>
<p>Well, and this gets to the, you know,</p>
<p>people who focus on communication science,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a scientist, I write about this stuff.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna try to prod someone</p>
<p>with a warning, like, this is three years apart.</p>
<p>Nuclear winter.</p>
<p>Nuclear winter, we&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>Global warming, well, yeah, we&rsquo;ll talk about it.</p>
<p>But look at that, you know, this is three years apart</p>
<p>in the covers of a magazine.</p>
<p>And, but then you have to say to what end</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not directing people to a basket of things to do.</p>
<p>And if you want political change,</p>
<p>then it would be to, you know, support a politician.</p>
<p>If you want energy access,</p>
<p>it would be to look at this $370 billion</p>
<p>the American government just put into play on climate</p>
<p>and say, well, how can my community benefit from that?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been told over and over again</p>
<p>by people in government, Jigar Shah,</p>
<p>who heads this giant loan program, the energy department.</p>
<p>He says, what I need now is like 19,500 people</p>
<p>who are worried about climate change.</p>
<p>Maybe because Greta got them worried.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing you could do.</p>
<p>You can connect your local government right now</p>
<p>with these multimillion dollar loans</p>
<p>so you can have electric buses instead of diesel buses.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an action pathway.</p>
<p>So without, so, you know,</p>
<p>alarm for the sake of getting attention or clicks</p>
<p>to me is not any more valuable than watching an action movie.</p>
<p>And again, I think also it very easily ends up</p>
<p>sort of skewing our conversation</p>
<p>about what are the actual solutions, you know,</p>
<p>because yes, it&rsquo;s great to get rid of the diesel bus,</p>
<p>but probably not for the reason people think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because diesel buses are really polluting</p>
<p>in the air pollution sense.</p>
<p>And that is why you should get rid of them.</p>
<p>And again, if you really wanted to help people,</p>
<p>for instance, with hurricanes,</p>
<p>you should have better rules and zoning in Florida,</p>
<p>which is a very different outcome.</p>
<p>So the mud wrestling fight also gets our attention</p>
<p>diverted towards solutions that seem easy, fun, you know,</p>
<p>sort of the electric car is a great example of this.</p>
<p>The electric car has somehow become almost the sign</p>
<p>that I care and I&rsquo;m really gonna do something about climate.</p>
<p>Of course, electric cars are great</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re probably part of the solution</p>
<p>and they will actually cut carbon emissions somewhat,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re an incredibly ineffective way</p>
<p>of cutting carbon emissions right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fairly expensive.</p>
<p>You have to subsidize them a lot</p>
<p>and they still emit quite a bit of CO2,</p>
<p>both because the batteries get produced</p>
<p>and because they usually run off of power</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>Strong words from your in-law.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go electric car.</p>
<p>So educate us on the pros and cons of electric cars</p>
<p>in this complex picture of climate change.</p>
<p>What do you think of the efforts of Tesla and Elon Musk</p>
<p>on pushing forward the electric car revolution?</p>
<p>So look, electric cars are great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t own a car, but you know, I&rsquo;ve been driving-</p>
<p>There you go, socially signaling.</p>
<p>Yeah, but yeah, I&rsquo;ve-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in Texas, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Well, I flew in here, so it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m in any way</p>
<p>a virtuous guy on that path.</p>
<p>But yeah, look, they&rsquo;re great cars</p>
<p>and eventually electric cars will take over</p>
<p>a significant part of our driving</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s good because they&rsquo;re more effective.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably also gonna be cheaper.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of good opportunities with them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve become reified</p>
<p>as this thing that you do to fix climate.</p>
<p>And right now they&rsquo;re not really all that great for climate.</p>
<p>You need a lot of extra material into the batteries,</p>
<p>which is very polluting and it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>it emits a lot of CO2.</p>
<p>A lot of electric cars are bought as second cars in the US.</p>
<p>So we used to think that they were driven</p>
<p>almost as much as a regular car.</p>
<p>It turns out that they&rsquo;re more likely driven</p>
<p>less than half as much as regular cars.</p>
<p>So, 89% of all Americans who have an electric car</p>
<p>also have a real car that they use for the long trips</p>
<p>and then they use the electric car for short trips.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, 89%.</p>
<p>89, yeah.</p>
<p>So the point here is that it&rsquo;s one of these things</p>
<p>that become more sort of a virtue signaling thing.</p>
<p>And again, look, once electric cars</p>
<p>are sufficiently cheap that people will want to buy them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And they will do some good for the environment.</p>
<p>But in reality, what we should be focusing on</p>
<p>is instead of getting people electric cars</p>
<p>in rich countries, where because we&rsquo;re subsidizing</p>
<p>typically in many countries,</p>
<p>you actually get a sort of sliding scale.</p>
<p>You get more subsidy, the more expensive it is.</p>
<p>We sort of subsidize this to very rich people</p>
<p>to buy very large Teslas to drive around in.</p>
<p>Whereas what we should be focusing on</p>
<p>is perhaps getting electric motorcycles</p>
<p>in third world developing cities,</p>
<p>where they would do a lot more good.</p>
<p>They can actually go as far as you need.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no worry about running out of them.</p>
<p>And they would obviously, they&rsquo;re much, much more polluting</p>
<p>just air pollution wise, and they&rsquo;re much cheaper</p>
<p>and they use very little battery.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about getting our senses right.</p>
<p>But the electric car is not a conversation about,</p>
<p>is it technically a really good</p>
<p>or is it a somewhat good insight?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, it&rsquo;s a virtual signal.</p>
<p>So just, I work with economists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually not an economist,</p>
<p>but I like to say I claim I kind of am.</p>
<p>But the fundamental point is we would say,</p>
<p>well, how much does it cost to cut a ton of CO2?</p>
<p>And the answer is for most electric cars,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re paying in the order of 1000, 2000,</p>
<p>Norway, they pay up to what, $5,000 or thereabouts,</p>
<p>huge amount for one ton of CO2.</p>
<p>You can right now cut a ton of CO2 for about,</p>
<p>what is it, $14 on the Reggie or something?</p>
<p>Yeah, you can do this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a regional greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>So you can basically cut it really, really cheaply.</p>
<p>Why would we not want to cut dozens and dozens</p>
<p>of tons of CO2 for the same price</p>
<p>instead of just cutting one ton?</p>
<p>And the simple answer is we only do that</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re so focused on electric cars.</p>
<p>If I may interrupt, typically European come here in Texas,</p>
<p>tell me I can&rsquo;t have my Ford F-150, but I&rsquo;ll-</p>
<p>Oh, now you can have your F-150 Lightning.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;m just joking, yes.</p>
<p>But what do you think about electric cars,</p>
<p>if you could just link on that moment</p>
<p>and this particular element of helping reduce emissions?</p>
<p>Well, you talked about the middle in the beginning,</p>
<p>and I loved moving to the hybrid.</p>
<p>The Prius was fantastic.</p>
<p>It did everything our other sedan did,</p>
<p>but it was 60 miles per gallon performance,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have range anxiety</p>
<p>because it has a regular engine too.</p>
<p>We still have a Prius.</p>
<p>We also inherited my dad,</p>
<p>dear dad&rsquo;s year 2000 Toyota Sienna,</p>
<p>which is an old 100,000 mile minivan,</p>
<p>and we use it all the time to do the stuff</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do in the Prius.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Taking stuff to the dump.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean in terms of the size of the vehicle?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, size and just convenience factor</p>
<p>for a bigger vehicle.</p>
<p>I would love a fully electrified transportation world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of exciting.</p>
<p>I think what Elon did with Tesla,</p>
<p>I remember way, way back in the day</p>
<p>when the first models were coming out.</p>
<p>There were very slick Ferrari-style cars,</p>
<p>and I thought, this is cool,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a history of privileged markets</p>
<p>testing new technologies, and I&rsquo;m all for that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s done a huge service,</p>
<p>prodding so much more R&amp;D,</p>
<p>and once GM and Ford started to realize,</p>
<p>oh my God, this is a real phenomenon,</p>
<p>getting them in the game.</p>
<p>There was that documentary who killed the electric car,</p>
<p>which seemed to imply that there were fights</p>
<p>to keep this tamp down,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fundamentally cleaner, fundamentally better</p>
<p>but then you have to manage these bigger questions.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re gonna do a build-out here,</p>
<p>how do you make it fair?</p>
<p>As you were saying, who actually uses transit cars?</p>
<p>And Jagir Shah, that guy at the energy department</p>
<p>I mentioned who has all this money to give out,</p>
<p>he wants to give loans to,</p>
<p>if you had an Uber fleet, those Uber drivers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones who need electric cars as his work,</p>
<p>and there was a recent story, and Grist also,</p>
<p>said that most of the sales of Teslas</p>
<p>are at the high end of the market,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re $60,000, $80,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>Like the Hummer, the electric Hummer,</p>
<p>there was a data point on that, astonishing data point,</p>
<p>the battery in that Hummer weighs more than,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to look it up, it weighs more than a car.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it might have been a Prius.</p>
<p>And think of the material costs there,</p>
<p>think of where that battery, the cobalt</p>
<p>and the lithium, where does this stuff come from?</p>
<p>To build this stuff out, I&rsquo;m all for it,</p>
<p>but we have to be honest and clear about,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a new resource rush, like the oil rush</p>
<p>back in the early 20th century,</p>
<p>and those impacts have to be figured out too.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re all big Hummers, for rich people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many contrary arguments to that,</p>
<p>that I think we have to figure out a way,</p>
<p>we, I don&rsquo;t like the word we, I use it too much,</p>
<p>we all do, but.</p>
<p>We all do.</p>
<p>We usually refer, when you say we, we humans.</p>
<p>We society, we the government, yeah.</p>
<p>There has to be some thought and attention put</p>
<p>to where you put these incentives,</p>
<p>so that you get the best use of this technology</p>
<p>for the carbon benefit,</p>
<p>for the conventional sooty pollution benefit,</p>
<p>for the transportation benefit.</p>
<p>Can I step back and ask a sort of big question,</p>
<p>we mentioned economics, journalism,</p>
<p>how does an economist and a climate scientist</p>
<p>and a journalist that writes about climate</p>
<p>see the world differently?</p>
<p>What are the strengths and potential blind spots</p>
<p>of each discipline?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just sort of,</p>
<p>just so people may be aware,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll be able to fall into the economics camp</p>
<p>a bit, there&rsquo;s climate scientists,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s climate scientists adjacent people,</p>
<p>like who hang, some of my best friends are climate scientists</p>
<p>which is, I think, where you fall in,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a journalist, you&rsquo;ve been writing it,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not completely in the trenches of doing the work.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just stepping into the trenches</p>
<p>every once in a while.</p>
<p>So can you speak to that, maybe Bjorn,</p>
<p>like what does the world look like to an economist?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to empathize with these beings that-</p>
<p>That unfortunately has fallen</p>
<p>into the disreputable economics, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think the main point</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been trying for a long time,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s also a little bit</p>
<p>what Andy has been talking about,</p>
<p>for a very long time, the whole conversation was about</p>
<p>what does the science tell us?</p>
<p>Is global warming real?</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s much more, what can we actually do?</p>
<p>What are the policies that we can take</p>
<p>and how effective are they gonna be?</p>
<p>So the conversation we just had about electric cars</p>
<p>is a good example of how an economist think about,</p>
<p>look, this is not a question</p>
<p>about whether you feel morally virtuous</p>
<p>or whether you can sort of display</p>
<p>how much you care about the environment.</p>
<p>This is about how much you actually ended up</p>
<p>affecting the world.</p>
<p>And the honest answer is that electric cars right now</p>
<p>in the next decade or so will have a fairly small impact,</p>
<p>and unfortunately right now at a very high cost</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re basically subsidizing these things</p>
<p>at five or $10,000 around the world per car.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just not, it&rsquo;s not really sustainable,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s certainly not a very great way</p>
<p>to cut carbon emissions.</p>
<p>So I would be the kind of guy,</p>
<p>and economists would be the types of people who would say,</p>
<p>is there a smarter way where you, for less money,</p>
<p>can, for instance, cut more CO2?</p>
<p>And the obvious answer is yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve seen, for instance, with fracking.</p>
<p>The fact that the US went from a lot of coal</p>
<p>to a lot of gas because gas became incredibly cheap,</p>
<p>because gas emits about half as much as coal does</p>
<p>when you use it for power,</p>
<p>that basically cut more carbon emissions</p>
<p>than pretty much any other single thing.</p>
<p>And we should get the rest of the world, in some sense,</p>
<p>to frack because it&rsquo;s really cheap.</p>
<p>There are some problems, and absolutely,</p>
<p>we can also have that conversation.</p>
<p>No technology is problem-free,</p>
<p>but fundamentally it&rsquo;s an incredibly cheap way</p>
<p>to get people to cut a lot of CO2.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the final solution</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s still a fossil fuel,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a much better fossil fuel, if you will,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s much more realistic to do that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one part of the thing.</p>
<p>The other one is when we talked about, for instance,</p>
<p>how do we help people in Florida who gets hit by a hurricane</p>
<p>or how do we help people that get damaged in flash floods,</p>
<p>the people who are in heat waves,</p>
<p>and the simple answer is there&rsquo;s a lot of very, very cheap</p>
<p>and effective things that we could do first.</p>
<p>So most climate people will tend to sort of say,</p>
<p>we gotta get rid of all carbon emissions,</p>
<p>we gotta change the engine that sort of powers the world</p>
<p>and has powered us for the last 200 years,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all good and well,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really, really hard to do,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably not gonna do very much.</p>
<p>And even if you succeed it, it would only help</p>
<p>future victims of future Hurricane Ians in Florida</p>
<p>a tiny, tiny bit at best.</p>
<p>So instead, let&rsquo;s try to focus on not getting people</p>
<p>to build right on the waterfront</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re incredibly vulnerable</p>
<p>and where you&rsquo;re very likely to get hit,</p>
<p>where we subsidize people with federal insurance again,</p>
<p>which is just actually losing money.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re much more about saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a science question,</p>
<p>I just take the science for granted.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a problem with climate change,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much more about saying,</p>
<p>how can we make smart decisions?</p>
<p>Can I ask you about blind spots?</p>
<p>When you reduce stuff to numbers, the costs and benefits,</p>
<p>is there stuff you might miss</p>
<p>that are important to the flourishing of the human species?</p>
<p>So everyone will have to say,</p>
<p>of course there must be blind spots.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know what they are.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure Andy would probably be better</p>
<p>at telling me what they are.</p>
<p>So we try to incorporate all of it,</p>
<p>but obviously we&rsquo;re not successful.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t incorporate everything,</p>
<p>for instance, in a cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>But the point is, in some way,</p>
<p>I would worry a lot about this</p>
<p>if we were sort of close to perfection, human race,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing almost everything right,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not quite right,</p>
<p>then we need to get the last digits right.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s much more that,</p>
<p>and the point that I tried to make before,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all focused on going to an electric car</p>
<p>or something else rather than fracking.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all focused on cutting carbon emissions</p>
<p>instead of reducing vulnerability.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re simply getting orders of magnitude wrong.</p>
<p>And while I&rsquo;m sure I have blind spots,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re probably not big enough</p>
<p>to overturn that point.</p>
<p>Andy, why is Bjorn and economists</p>
<p>are all wrong about everything?</p>
<p>Well, the models, we could spend a whole day on models.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re economic models.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this thing called optimization models.</p>
<p>There were two big ones used to assess the US plan,</p>
<p>this new big IRA inflation reduction package.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a starting point for understanding what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>But as this gets to the journalism part or the public part,</p>
<p>you have to look at the caveats.</p>
<p>You have to look at what model,</p>
<p>economists expressly exclude things that are not modelable.</p>
<p>And if you look in the fine print on the repeat project,</p>
<p>the Princeton version of the assessment</p>
<p>of the recent giant legislation,</p>
<p>the fine print is the front page,</p>
<p>for me, as a deep diving journalist,</p>
<p>because it says we didn&rsquo;t include any sources of friction,</p>
<p>meaning resistance to putting new transmission lines</p>
<p>through your community,</p>
<p>or people who don&rsquo;t want mining in America</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve exported all of our mining.</p>
<p>We mine our cobalt in Congo,</p>
<p>and trying to get a new mine in Nevada</p>
<p>was a fraught fight that took more than 10 years for lithium.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re excluding those elements from your model,</p>
<p>which on the surface makes this $370 billion package</p>
<p>have an emissions reduction trajectory</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really pretty good,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not saying in your first line,</p>
<p>by the way, these are the things we&rsquo;re not considering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the job of a journalist.</p>
<p>You could probably summarize all of human history</p>
<p>with that one word, friction.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, well, inertia,</p>
<p>friction implies there&rsquo;s a force</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already being resisted,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also inertia, which is a huge part of our,</p>
<p>we have a status quo bias.</p>
<p>The scientists that I,</p>
<p>in grappling with the climate problem,</p>
<p>as a journalist, I paid too much attention</p>
<p>to climate scientists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why all of my articles focused on climate change,</p>
<p>and it was 2006.</p>
<p>I remember now pretty clearly,</p>
<p>I was asked by the Weekend Review section</p>
<p>of the New York Times to write a sort of a weekend</p>
<p>thumb sucker, we call them, on.</p>
<p>Thumb sucker?</p>
<p>You know, you sit and suck your thumb</p>
<p>and think about something.</p>
<p>Why is everybody so pissed off about climate change?</p>
<p>It was after Al Gore&rsquo;s movie,</p>
<p>the Al Gore movie came out, Inconvenient Truth,</p>
<p>Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>It was big.</p>
<p>Senator Inhofe in the Senate from Oklahoma</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t yet throwing snowballs, but it was close to that,</p>
<p>and so I looked into what was going on.</p>
<p>Why is this so heated?</p>
<p>In 2006, the story&rsquo;s called Yelling Fire on a Hot Planet,</p>
<p>and that was the first time,</p>
<p>this is after 18 years of writing about global warming,</p>
<p>that was the first time I interviewed a social scientist,</p>
<p>not a climate scientist.</p>
<p>Her name was Helen Ingram.</p>
<p>She was at UC Irvine, and she laid out for me</p>
<p>the factors that determine why people vote</p>
<p>or what they vote for, what they think about politically,</p>
<p>and they were the antithesis of the climate problem.</p>
<p>She used the words, she said people go into the voting booth</p>
<p>thinking about things that are soon, salient, and certain,</p>
<p>and climate change is complex, you know,</p>
<p>has long timescales, and that really jogged me,</p>
<p>and then I, between 2006, 2010,</p>
<p>I started interviewing other social scientists,</p>
<p>this was by far the scariest science of all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the climate in our heads, or inconvenient minds,</p>
<p>and in how that translates into political norms and stuff</p>
<p>really became the monster, not the climate system.</p>
<p>Is there social dynamics to the scientists themselves?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve gotten to witness</p>
<p>a kind of flocking behavior with scientists,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s almost like a flock of birds.</p>
<p>Within the flock, there&rsquo;s a lot of disagreement,</p>
<p>and fun debates, and everybody trying</p>
<p>to prove each other wrong, but they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>kind of headed in the same direction,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to be the bird</p>
<p>that kind of leaves that flock.</p>
<p>So like, there&rsquo;s an idea that science is a mechanism</p>
<p>will get us towards the truth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll definitely get us somewhere,</p>
<p>but it could be not the truth in the short term.</p>
<p>In the long term, a bigger flock will come along,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll get us to the truth,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a sense that, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a mechanism within science</p>
<p>to snap out of it if you&rsquo;re down the wrong track.</p>
<p>Usually you get it right, but sometimes you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s very costly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many factors that line up</p>
<p>to perpetuate that flocking behavior.</p>
<p>One is media attention comes in.</p>
<p>The other is funding comes in.</p>
<p>National Science Foundation or whatever,</p>
<p>European foundations pour a huge amount of money</p>
<p>into things related to climate.</p>
<p>And so, and then your narrative in your head</p>
<p>is shaped by that aspect of the climate problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the spotlight.</p>
<p>I started using this hashtag a few years back,</p>
<p>narrative capture, like be wary of narrative capture,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re on a train and everyone&rsquo;s getting on the train.</p>
<p>And this is in the media too, not just science.</p>
<p>And it becomes self-sustaining</p>
<p>and contrary indications are ignored or downplayed.</p>
<p>No one does replication science</p>
<p>because your career doesn&rsquo;t advance</p>
<p>through replicating someone else&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>So those contrary indications are not necessarily</p>
<p>really dug in on.</p>
<p>And this is way beyond climate.</p>
<p>This is many fields.</p>
<p>As you said, you might&rsquo;ve seen this in AI.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really hard to find.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another form of path dependency,</p>
<p>the term I used before.</p>
<p>But breaking narrative capture to me,</p>
<p>for me, has come mostly from stepping back</p>
<p>and reminding myself of the basic principles of journalism.</p>
<p>Journalism&rsquo;s basic principles are useful for anybody.</p>
<p>Confronting a big, enormous, dynamic, complex thing</p>
<p>is who, what, where, when, why.</p>
<p>Just be really rigorous about not assuming,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a fire in Boulder County</p>
<p>or a flood in Fort Myers, that climate,</p>
<p>which is in your head,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re part of the climate team</p>
<p>at the New York Times or whatever,</p>
<p>is the foreground part of this problem.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the psychological challenge of that</p>
<p>if you incorporate the fact that</p>
<p>if you try to step back and have nuance,</p>
<p>you might get attacked by the others in the flock?</p>
<p>Oh, I was.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve certainly been to.</p>
<p>Both of you get attacked continuously from different sides.</p>
<p>So let me just ask about that.</p>
<p>How does that feel?</p>
<p>And how do you continue thinking clearly</p>
<p>and continuously try to have humility and step back</p>
<p>and not get defensive in that as a communicator?</p>
<p>I mean, there are other things</p>
<p>happening at the same time, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now 35 years into,</p>
<p>almost 40 years into my journalism career.</p>
<p>So I have some independence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m free from the obligations of,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t really need my next paycheck.</p>
<p>I live in Maine now in a house I love.</p>
<p>I own it outright.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great privilege and honor,</p>
<p>and as a result of a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m freer to think freely.</p>
<p>And I know my colleagues in newsrooms,</p>
<p>when I was at the New York Times,</p>
<p>in the newsroom, you become captive to a narrative,</p>
<p>just as you do out in the world.</p>
<p>The New York Times had a narrative about Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Drove us into that war.</p>
<p>The Times sucked right into that and helped perpetuate it.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re in a bit of a narrative, we, the media,</p>
<p>my friends at the Times and others are on a train ride</p>
<p>on climate change, depicting it in a certain way.</p>
<p>That really, I saw problems with how they handled</p>
<p>the Joe Manchin issue in America,</p>
<p>the West Virginia Senator.</p>
<p>They really kind of piled on</p>
<p>and zoomed in on his investments,</p>
<p>which is really important to do,</p>
<p>but they never pulled back and said,</p>
<p>by the way, he&rsquo;s a rare species.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Democrat in West Virginia,</p>
<p>and which is a seat that would be</p>
<p>otherwise occupied by a Republican.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be no talk of a climate deal or any of that stuff</p>
<p>without him.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re starting to kind of frame a story</p>
<p>in a certain way, you carry it along.</p>
<p>And as you said, sometimes it breaks and a new norm arrives,</p>
<p>but the climate train is still kind of rushing forward</p>
<p>and missing the opportunity to cut it into its pieces</p>
<p>and say, well, what&rsquo;s really wrong with Florida?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s for me, when you ask about how I handle</p>
<p>the slings and arrows and stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s partially because I&rsquo;m past worrying about it too much.</p>
<p>I mean, it was pretty intense.</p>
<p>2009, Rush Limbaugh suggested I kill myself</p>
<p>on his radio show.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really great time.</p>
<p>What was that about?</p>
<p>I had, actually, this was a meeting in Washington in 2009</p>
<p>on population at the Wilson Center.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t be there, so actually this is pre-COVID,</p>
<p>but I was zooming in or something, like Skyping in,</p>
<p>and I was talking about, in a playful way,</p>
<p>I said, well, if you really wanna worry about carbon,</p>
<p>this was during the debate over a carbon tax model</p>
<p>for a bill in America, we should probably have</p>
<p>a carbon tax for kids because a bigger family in America</p>
<p>is a big source of more emissions.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a playful thought bubble.</p>
<p>Some right-wing blogger blogged about it.</p>
<p>It got into Rush&rsquo;s pile of things to talk about.</p>
<p>And the clip is really fun.</p>
<p>Oh, so meaning, so if humans are bad for the environment,</p>
<p>I can imagine Rush, that&rsquo;s how you know you&rsquo;ve made it.</p>
<p>He said, Mr. Revkin of the New York,</p>
<p>Andrew Revkin of the New York Times,</p>
<p>if you really think that people are the worst thing</p>
<p>that ever happened to this planet,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just kill yourself</p>
<p>and save the planet by dying?</p>
<p>So that was tough for you.</p>
<p>It was tough for my family.</p>
<p>It did generate some interesting calls</p>
<p>and stuff in my voicemail.</p>
<p>But on the left, I was also undercut.</p>
<p>Roger Pilkey Jr., a prominent researcher</p>
<p>of climate risk and climate policy, UC Boulder,</p>
<p>was actively, his career track was derailed purposefully</p>
<p>by people who just thought his message was too off the path.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve been dealing with this for a very long time.</p>
<p>What do you?</p>
<p>So I just want to get back to, so the science,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the science get it so much wrong</p>
<p>as it just becomes accepted to make certain assumptions.</p>
<p>As you just said, we assume no friction.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a way that you kind of model the world</p>
<p>that ends up being also a convenient message in many ways.</p>
<p>And I think the main convenient message in climate,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not surprising if you think about it,</p>
<p>the main convenient message is that the best way</p>
<p>to do something about all the things that we call climate</p>
<p>is to cut CO2.</p>
<p>And that turns out to only sometimes be true</p>
<p>and with a lot of caveats.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s sort of the message.</p>
<p>And it takes a long time.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s really, really difficult to do</p>
<p>in any meaningful sort of timeframe.</p>
<p>And if you challenge that, yes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re outside the flock and you get attacked.</p>
<p>So somebody told me once, I think it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>They say at the Harvard Law School,</p>
<p>if you have a good case, pound the case.</p>
<p>If you have a bad case, pound the table.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve always felt that when people go after me,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of pounding the table.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally screaming, I don&rsquo;t have a good case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really annoyed with what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And so to me, that actually means it&rsquo;s much more important</p>
<p>to make this argument.</p>
<p>Sure, I mean, I would love everyone just saying,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s a really good point, I&rsquo;m gonna use that.</p>
<p>But yeah, we&rsquo;re stuck in a situation,</p>
<p>certainly in a conversation where a lot of people</p>
<p>have invested a lot of time and energy</p>
<p>on saying we should cut carbon emissions.</p>
<p>This is the way to help humankind.</p>
<p>And just be clear,</p>
<p>I think we should cut carbon emissions as well,</p>
<p>but we should also just be realistic</p>
<p>about what we can achieve with that</p>
<p>and what are all the other things that we could also do.</p>
<p>And it turns out that a lot of these other things</p>
<p>are much cheaper, much more effective,</p>
<p>will help much more, much quicker.</p>
<p>And so getting that point out</p>
<p>is just incredibly important for us to get it right.</p>
<p>So in some sense, to make sure</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t do another Iraq</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t do another, lots of stupid decisions.</p>
<p>I mean, this is one of the things mankind is very good at.</p>
<p>And I guess I see my role,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s probably also how you see yourself</p>
<p>is trying to get everyone to do it slightly less wrong.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about a deep psychological effect for you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a drug of martyrdom.</p>
<p>So whenever you stand against the flock,</p>
<p>you wrote a couple of really good books on the topic.</p>
<p>The most recent, False Alarm.</p>
<p>I stand as the holder of truth</p>
<p>that everybody who is alarmist is wrong.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s just simple, calm way</p>
<p>to express the facts of the matter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very compelling to a very large number of people.</p>
<p>They want to make a martyr out of you.</p>
<p>Is that, are you worried about your own mind</p>
<p>being corrupted by that,</p>
<p>by enjoying standing against the crowd?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little,</p>
<p>I guess I can see what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>sort of in a literary way or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, something poetic here.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s very little comfort</p>
<p>or sort of usefulness in annoying a lot of people.</p>
<p>Whenever I go to a party, for instance,</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s a good chance</p>
<p>people are gonna be annoyed with me.</p>
<p>And I would love that not to be the case.</p>
<p>But what I try to do is,</p>
<p>so I try to be very polite</p>
<p>and sort of not push people&rsquo;s buttons</p>
<p>unless they sort of actively say,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying all kind of stupid stuff on the climate.</p>
<p>And then try to engage with them and say,</p>
<p>well, what is it you&rsquo;re thinking about?</p>
<p>And hopefully, during that party</p>
<p>and then it ends up being a really bad party for me.</p>
<p>But anyway, so I&rsquo;ll end up possibly convincing one person</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not totally stupid,</p>
<p>but no, I&rsquo;m not playing the martyr</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not enjoying that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, the martyr complex</p>
<p>is all around the climate question.</p>
<p>Michael Mann, at the far end of the spectrum of activism</p>
<p>from where Bjorn is, was a climate scientist,</p>
<p>is a climate scientist who was actively attacked</p>
<p>by Inhofe and West Virginia politicians</p>
<p>and really abused in many ways.</p>
<p>He had come up with a very prominent model</p>
<p>of looking at long-term records of climate change</p>
<p>and got this hockey stick for temperature.</p>
<p>And he definitely sits there</p>
<p>in a certain kind of spotlight because of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not unique at any particular vantage point</p>
<p>in the spectrum of sort of prominent people on the debate.</p>
<p>Andrew, you co-wrote the book,</p>
<p>The Human Planet, Earth at the Dawn of the Anthropocene,</p>
<p>which is the new age when humans</p>
<p>are actually having impact on the environment.</p>
<p>Let me ask the question of,</p>
<p>what do you find most beautiful and fascinating</p>
<p>about our planet Earth?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be cheap to say everything,</p>
<p>but just walking here this morning</p>
<p>under the bridge over the Colorado River,</p>
<p>seeing the birds, knowing there&rsquo;s bat colonies,</p>
<p>massive bat colonies around here</p>
<p>that I got to visit a few years ago.</p>
<p>I experienced one of those bat explosions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mind-blowing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really lucky as a journalist</p>
<p>to have gone to the North Pole,</p>
<p>the camp on the sea ice, with Russian help.</p>
<p>This is a camp that was set up for tourists</p>
<p>coming from Europe every year.</p>
<p>There were scientists on the sea ice</p>
<p>floating on the 14,000-foot-deep Arctic Ocean,</p>
<p>and I was with them for several days.</p>
<p>I wrote a book about that, too, along with my reporting.</p>
<p>Been in the depths of the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>When I was very young, I was a crew on a sailboat</p>
<p>that sailed 2 3rds of the way around the world.</p>
<p>I was halfway across the Indian Ocean,</p>
<p>again, in 14,000-foot-deep water.</p>
<p>We were just, there was no wind,</p>
<p>and we were, this was way before I was a journalist,</p>
<p>at 22, 23 years old, and we went swimming,</p>
<p>and swimming in 14,000-foot-deep water,</p>
<p>500 miles from land, the Western Indian Ocean,</p>
<p>halfway between Somalia and the Maldives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like so mind-boggling, chillingly fantastical thing</p>
<p>with a mask on, looking at your shadow</p>
<p>going to the vanishing point below you,</p>
<p>looking over at the boat, which is a 60-foot boat,</p>
<p>but it just looks like a toy, and then getting back on</p>
<p>and being beholden to the elements,</p>
<p>the sailboat heading toward Djibouti.</p>
<p>The immensity and the power of the elements.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, and then the human qualities are unbelievable.</p>
<p>The Anthropocene, I played a bit of a role as a journalist</p>
<p>in waking people up to the idea that this era</p>
<p>called the Holocene, the last 11,000 years,</p>
<p>since the last Ice Age, had ended.</p>
<p>I wrote my 1992 book on global warming,</p>
<p>thinking about all that we&rsquo;re just talking about,</p>
<p>thinking about the wonders of the planet,</p>
<p>thinking about the impact of humans so far</p>
<p>in our explosive growth in the 20th century.</p>
<p>I wrote that perhaps earth scientists of the future</p>
<p>will name this post-Holocene era</p>
<p>for its formative element for us,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re kind of in charge in certain ways,</p>
<p>which is hubristic at the same time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the variability of the climate system</p>
<p>is still profound with or without global warming.</p>
<p>So this immense, powerful, beautiful organism that is earth,</p>
<p>all the different sub-organisms that are on it,</p>
<p>do you see humans as a kind of parasite on this earth?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Or do you see it as something that helps the flourishing</p>
<p>of the entire organism?</p>
<p>That can.</p>
<p>Can.</p>
<p>Intelligence.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t yet?</p>
<p>I mean, aren&rsquo;t we on the ability</p>
<p>of the collective intelligence of the human species</p>
<p>to develop all these kinds of technologies,</p>
<p>and to be able to have Twitter to introspect onto itself?</p>
<p>Oh, I think we&rsquo;re doing a, it&rsquo;s always been.</p>
<p>In a way, we are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s catch-up, we&rsquo;re always in catch-up mode.</p>
<p>I was at the Vatican for a big meeting in 2014</p>
<p>on Sustainable Humanity, Sustainable Nature,</p>
<p>Our Responsibility.</p>
<p>And it was a week of presentations by Martin Rees,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s this famed British scientist, physicist who.</p>
<p>Been on his podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, great.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s fixated on existential risk, right?</p>
<p>Yes, he is.</p>
<p>So it was a week of this stuff.</p>
<p>And the meeting was kicked off by,</p>
<p>I wrote about it, Cardinal Maradiaga,</p>
<p>who is, I think, from El Salvador.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the Pope&rsquo;s kind of posse.</p>
<p>He gave one of the initial speeches.</p>
<p>And he said, nowadays, mankind looks like a technical giant</p>
<p>and an ethical child.</p>
<p>Meaning our technological wizardry is unbelievable,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s way out in front of our ability to step back</p>
<p>and kind of consider in the full dimensions we need to,</p>
<p>is it helping everybody?</p>
<p>Is it, what are the consequences of CRISPR?</p>
<p>You know, genetics technology?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no single answer to that.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m in the African Union,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just using this as an example.</p>
<p>CRISPR has emerged so fast.</p>
<p>It can do so much by changing the nature of nature.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll, in a kind of a programming way,</p>
<p>building genes, not just transferring them</p>
<p>from one organism to another.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only just begun to taste the fruits of that,</p>
<p>literally.</p>
<p>And it can wipe out a mosquito species.</p>
<p>We know how to do that now.</p>
<p>You can like literally take out the dengue-causing mosquito.</p>
<p>The scientists have done the work.</p>
<p>And you think, okay, cool.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s this big fight over whether that should happen.</p>
<p>African Union, and I&rsquo;m with their view,</p>
<p>says, hey, if we can take out a mosquito species</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing horrific, chronic loss through dengue,</p>
<p>which I had once in Indonesia, it&rsquo;s not fun,</p>
<p>and we should do it, you know?</p>
<p>And Europe-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the other side of the argument?</p>
<p>The European Union, they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>using their capital P precautionary principle,</p>
<p>says, no, we can&rsquo;t meddle with nature.</p>
<p>And this is just like we were talking with climate.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s the real-time question</p>
<p>and the long-term question.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the people who are just facing the need</p>
<p>to get through the day and be healthy and survive</p>
<p>and have enough food,</p>
<p>which is not integrated sufficiently at all</p>
<p>into the climate, stop climate change debate.</p>
<p>And those who like are trying to cut CO2,</p>
<p>which will have a benefit, you know, in the future</p>
<p>by limiting the fat tail outcomes of this journey we&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>So when I think about the Anthropocene,</p>
<p>I think about this planet.</p>
<p>I love that we&rsquo;re here right now.</p>
<p>I love that our species has these capacities.</p>
<p>I would love for there to be a little bit more reflection</p>
<p>in where things come from and where they might go.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a student, a kid, what&rsquo;s your role?</p>
<p>The wonderful thing about the complexity of it</p>
<p>is everyone can play a role.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an artist or a designer or an architect</p>
<p>or an economist or a podcaster,</p>
<p>whatever you do, just tweak a little bit</p>
<p>toward examining these questions,</p>
<p>stepping back from the simplistic label-throwing</p>
<p>toward what actually is the problem in front of me,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in Pakistan or in Boston or wherever,</p>
<p>you know, Florida.</p>
<p>You know, what do you find beautiful</p>
<p>about this collective intelligence machine we have?</p>
<p>From an economics perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating that we&rsquo;re able to,</p>
<p>there is a machine to it that we&rsquo;ve built up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to represent interests and desires</p>
<p>and value and hopes and dreams in sort of monetary ways</p>
<p>that we can trade with each other,</p>
<p>we can make agreements with each other,</p>
<p>we can represent our goals and build companies</p>
<p>that actually help and so on.</p>
<p>Do you just step back every once in a while</p>
<p>and marvel at the fact that a few billion of us</p>
<p>are able to somehow not create complete chaos</p>
<p>and actually collaborate</p>
<p>and have collaborative disagreements</p>
<p>that ultimately or so far have led to progress?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think fundamentally the point,</p>
<p>apart from the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>we should just be joyful of the fact that humans live here,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredibly important to remember</p>
<p>how much progress we&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>You know, most people just don&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>to think about those stats.</p>
<p>You know, I get that in the normal bustle of day,</p>
<p>but just, you know, in 1900,</p>
<p>the average person on the planet lived to be 32 years.</p>
<p>32 years, that was our average life expectancy.</p>
<p>Today it&rsquo;s about 74.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve literally got two lifetimes on this planet,</p>
<p>each one of us.</p>
<p>And, you know, every year you live in the rich world,</p>
<p>you get to live three months longer</p>
<p>and the poor world is about four months longer</p>
<p>because of medical advances,</p>
<p>because we get better at dealing both with cancer</p>
<p>and especially right now with heart disease.</p>
<p>These are amazing achievements.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s a very, very small part of it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re much better fed, we&rsquo;re much better educated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone from a world where virtually everyone</p>
<p>or, you know, 90% were illiterate</p>
<p>to a world where more than 90% illiterate.</p>
<p>This is an astounding opportunity.</p>
<p>And 200 years ago, 95%, 94% of the world</p>
<p>were extremely poor, that is less than a dollar a day.</p>
<p>Today, for the first time in 2015, it was down below 10%.</p>
<p>So, and again, these are kind of boring statistics,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also astounding testaments</p>
<p>of how well humanity has done.</p>
<p>So just on the point of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve kind of just been focused</p>
<p>on making our own world better.</p>
<p>And in many ways, you know,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve hunted a lot of big animals either to extinction</p>
<p>or down to much, much smaller populations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much smaller populations of fish in the ocean.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>that sort of bear the brunt of our success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because we&rsquo;re evil in that sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just because we didn&rsquo;t care all that much about them.</p>
<p>I think it is important as one funnel of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna make a big deal out of it,</p>
<p>but the fact that we&rsquo;re putting out more CO2</p>
<p>in the atmosphere, because CO2 is,</p>
<p>as you also mentioned before, it&rsquo;s actually plant food.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a greenhouse grower,</p>
<p>you know if you put in CO2 in your greenhouse,</p>
<p>you actually get bigger and plumper tomatoes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s essentially what we&rsquo;re doing in the world.</p>
<p>This has overall bad consequences</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why we should be doing something about it.</p>
<p>But one of the good side effects is actually</p>
<p>that the world is getting greener.</p>
<p>So we get much more green stuff.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know, and this is where I sort of show</p>
<p>my economist roots, because if you just measure</p>
<p>all living stuff in tons, so in weight,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually more living stuff</p>
<p>than there were a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Because elephants and all these other big fish and stuff</p>
<p>are actually really, really small fraction of the world.</p>
<p>So the fact that we have, yes,</p>
<p>so we have an enormous amount of life stuff,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t even measure it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly just wood and green stuff</p>
<p>that has dramatically increased in the world.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re still not there from what it was in 1500.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve still cut down the world a lot,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re actually making a much greener world.</p>
<p>Again, not because we really cared or thought about it,</p>
<p>but just sort of a side effect of what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I think the crucial bit to remember is when you&rsquo;re poor</p>
<p>and you worry about what&rsquo;s gonna happen the next day,</p>
<p>this is just not your main issue.</p>
<p>Am I killing too many large animals in the world?</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re rich and you can actually sit in a podcast</p>
<p>in a convenient place in Austin,</p>
<p>you can also start thinking about this.</p>
<p>So one of the crucial bits, I think,</p>
<p>if we want to get the rest of the world to care</p>
<p>about the environment, care about climate,</p>
<p>care about all these other issues,</p>
<p>we really need to get them out of poverty first.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a simple point that we often forget.</p>
<p>And get them connected to all these gifts.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I have these memories of,</p>
<p>well, I was reporting on the next big earthquake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna devastate Istanbul in 2009.</p>
<p>I was in a slum, immigrant, poor neighborhood,</p>
<p>and walking around with an engineer,</p>
<p>pointing out to the buildings that were gonna fall down.</p>
<p>This is all known.</p>
<p>There was an earthquake in 1999, and the next one&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>One of my advantages in covering climate</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ve covered other kinds of disasters, too.</p>
<p>So it keeps my context, you know,</p>
<p>me in touch with other things we can do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m walking around and interviewing everybody.</p>
<p>I went to this school that&rsquo;s being retrofit.</p>
<p>They actually were getting ahead of it there.</p>
<p>The World Bank provided some funding</p>
<p>to put in iron bars in the brick building.</p>
<p>And I met these kids.</p>
<p>And they came, when you&rsquo;re a journalist</p>
<p>with a camera and stuff and a pad,</p>
<p>you get swarmed by kids, mostly in developing countries.</p>
<p>And so these kids are running up to me.</p>
<p>And they weren&rsquo;t going like, are you American?</p>
<p>Or just, they were saying, Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook.</p>
<p>And I went, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And they led me to their little town,</p>
<p>a little community center that had a bank</p>
<p>of eight or 10 pretty flimsy computers.</p>
<p>And they were all there playing a farm,</p>
<p>it was a game that was hot at that time on Facebook.</p>
<p>Farm.</p>
<p>Farmville?</p>
<p>Farmville, yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, my son back in the Hudson Valley,</p>
<p>I remember him playing it.</p>
<p>And I thought, wow, that is so frickin&rsquo; cool</p>
<p>that these kids, and actually I became Facebook friends</p>
<p>with a couple of them afterwards.</p>
<p>We traded our, and I thought back to my youth</p>
<p>when we had pen pals.</p>
<p>I would write a letter to a kid in West Cameroon</p>
<p>and he would write back.</p>
<p>It took weeks and it was a crinkly letter</p>
<p>and I never met him.</p>
<p>And now you can kind of connect with people.</p>
<p>And that all, through my blogging,</p>
<p>at the New York Times I was doing my regular reporting</p>
<p>but I still launched a blog in 2007 called Dot Earth,</p>
<p>which was all about where you were just describing,</p>
<p>the newest sphere, the connected world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a term from these two earliest,</p>
<p>a Russian guy, an early Vernadsky</p>
<p>and a French theologian and scientist,</p>
<p>which is so interesting, Teilhard de Chardin.</p>
<p>They had this idea in the early 20th century</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re creating a planet of the mind,</p>
<p>that human intelligence can foster a better Earth.</p>
<p>And I just became smitten with that,</p>
<p>especially meeting kids in Istanbul, slums,</p>
<p>who were on Facebook, looking for connectedness.</p>
<p>What can you do with these tools?</p>
<p>Which is what drives me with my work now.</p>
<p>But then there are these counter-currents</p>
<p>that if the connectedness can cut back,</p>
<p>it allowed Al-Qaeda to recruit,</p>
<p>use decapitation videos to recruit distributed,</p>
<p>disaffected young people into extremism.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of, these systems are not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like every other tool, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just for good or ill.</p>
<p>And the efficiency thing, the economics of the world,</p>
<p>which I also wrote about a little bit,</p>
<p>late 20th century, it was so cool</p>
<p>that everything became so efficient,</p>
<p>that our supply chains are just-in-time manufacturing,</p>
<p>getting the stuff from where the sources</p>
<p>of the material are to the car factory</p>
<p>and to get the car to the floor</p>
<p>just in time for someone to buy it.</p>
<p>And everyone got totally sucked in by that, including me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great, super efficient, cheaper.</p>
<p>And then COVID hit,</p>
<p>and the whole supply chain concept crumbled.</p>
<p>And one of the big lessons there, hopefully,</p>
<p>and this is relevant to sustainability generally,</p>
<p>is efficiency matters, but resilience matters too.</p>
<p>And resilience is inefficient.</p>
<p>You need redundancy or a variety of options, right?</p>
<p>Which is not what corporate companies think about,</p>
<p>which is not what, if you&rsquo;re only focused</p>
<p>on a bottom line, short-term timeline,</p>
<p>those disruptions are not what you&rsquo;re thinking about.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still thinking about,</p>
<p>can we get that widget here just in time</p>
<p>for this thing to happen?</p>
<p>And then on we go.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of, I love the noosphere,</p>
<p>this noosphere idea, the connectedness is fantastic.</p>
<p>Oh, another thing, like in the early 90s,</p>
<p>when I wrote my first book on global warming,</p>
<p>it was for an exhibition at the Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>The Environmental Defense Fund was involved.</p>
<p>They were like a partner,</p>
<p>one of these longstanding environmental groups.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very old-fashioned.</p>
<p>It was mostly lawyers, really,</p>
<p>just using the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act</p>
<p>to litigate against pollution.</p>
<p>And now, EDF is vastly bigger,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually, this coming year,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re launching a satellite.</p>
<p>An environmental group is launching methane sat,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s providing a view, an independent view</p>
<p>of where there&rsquo;s this gas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing, natural gas is basically methane.</p>
<p>So if you have a leak, whether it&rsquo;s in Siberia</p>
<p>or in Oklahoma, you can cross-reference,</p>
<p>you can ground, you can identify the hotspot,</p>
<p>you can know where the problem is to fix in so many ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just one example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, if someone had told me in 1993</p>
<p>that EDF was gonna launch a methane satellite,</p>
<p>I would have laughed out loud.</p>
<p>So technology plays a huge role</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s kind of employed with the bigger vision,</p>
<p>and leadership.</p>
<p>So Bjorn, you wrote, one of the books you wrote,</p>
<p>the most recent one, called False Alarm,</p>
<p>How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions,</p>
<p>Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet.</p>
<p>Good title, by the way, very intense,</p>
<p>makes me wanna read it.</p>
<p>What is likely the worst effect of climate change?</p>
<p>First, let me just, my editor actually hated the subtitle</p>
<p>because it gives away the whole book, basically.</p>
<p>It tells you what the book tries to make.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly what it should be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about getting this conversation out</p>
<p>in the public sphere.</p>
<p>So the worst thing that climate change can do</p>
<p>is like the worst thing that anything can do</p>
<p>is that it wipes out everything and we all die.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like, if you&rsquo;re just looking</p>
<p>for worst case outcomes,</p>
<p>anything can get to the worst case outcome.</p>
<p>Imagine if we, what&rsquo;s the worst thing</p>
<p>that could happen from HIV?</p>
<p>It breaks down one or more African states</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t fix it, and then you get</p>
<p>sort of biological warfare and terrorism,</p>
<p>throw that in the mix, and then you get someone</p>
<p>who makes a virus and kills the whole world.</p>
<p>You can make worst case scenarios for everything.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s just call it, I get the point.</p>
<p>Sorry for the interruption.</p>
<p>And I appreciate worst case analysis</p>
<p>because I am fundamentally a computer scientist,</p>
<p>and that was the thing that defined the discipline</p>
<p>of to measure the quality of the algorithm,</p>
<p>you measure what is its worst case performance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big O notation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you discuss algorithms.</p>
<p>What is the worst possible thing</p>
<p>in terms of performance this thing can do?</p>
<p>But for climate change, let&rsquo;s even go crazy.</p>
<p>What is exactly the worst case scenario for climate change?</p>
<p>Because I have to be honest and say,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really paid deep attention.</p>
<p>I just have a lot of colleagues</p>
<p>who think about climate and so on,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a kind of, in the alarmism,</p>
<p>there was a sense, well, this is a very serious problem.</p>
<p>And then the sentence would never finish.</p>
<p>What exactly is the problem?</p>
<p>Well, the extinction of the human species, okay.</p>
<p>With a virus, I understand how that could possibly happen.</p>
<p>What is the mechanism by which the human species</p>
<p>becomes extinct because of climate change?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I would want to be able to argue that</p>
<p>because it really requires you to have</p>
<p>sort of very, very extreme parameter choices</p>
<p>all down the line.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s this kind of idea</p>
<p>that we hit some of these unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>So for instance, the Western Arctic ice sheet</p>
<p>melts really, really quickly.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like that can happen really, really quickly,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just say that this could happen</p>
<p>within 100 years or something.</p>
<p>So we basically get what, seven meters,</p>
<p>what is that, 20 feet of sea level rise.</p>
<p>That will be a real challenge</p>
<p>to a lot of places around the world.</p>
<p>This would have significant costs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely, and there&rsquo;s actually been a study</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tried to estimate, could we deal with that?</p>
<p>And the short answer is yes, if you&rsquo;re fairly well off.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Holland, you can definitely deal with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also likely that most developing countries</p>
<p>are gonna be much closer to Holland</p>
<p>towards the end of the century</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll be much richer.</p>
<p>So they can probably handle it,</p>
<p>but it will be a real challenge.</p>
<p>May I ask a dumb question?</p>
<p>What happens when the sea level rises exactly?</p>
<p>What is the painful aspect of that?</p>
<p>It is that all of your current infrastructure</p>
<p>in a lot of coastal cities around the world</p>
<p>that are literally built on, Jakarta is a good example,</p>
<p>that are literally built on the just inches</p>
<p>above the sea level.</p>
<p>If you then get a sea level rise,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll rise, say, what would, 20 feet?</p>
<p>That would be like a third or a fourth</p>
<p>of a foot every year kind of thing.</p>
<p>I see no evidence that that&rsquo;s even.</p>
<p>But hold on a second.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about evidence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about worst case analysis and algorithm.</p>
<p>And so basically you would see your infrastructure,</p>
<p>all your stuff, very quickly being very, very challenged.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d basically have to put up huge sea walls</p>
<p>or migrate out of that area.</p>
<p>Very quickly.</p>
<p>Well, very quickly as in 50 years or something.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So like, is that, as a human species,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not able to respond to that kind of threat?</p>
<p>Of course we are.</p>
<p>And look, again, the point here is,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a lot of other arguments.</p>
<p>And I should just put the disclaimer,</p>
<p>this is not what I think is correct,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re asking me what&rsquo;s the worst case outcome</p>
<p>that you have.</p>
<p>So most of global warming is really about</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re used to one way of doing things.</p>
<p>So, you know, we live in Jakarta</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s right next to the sea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re used to the sea being at this level.</p>
<p>We grow our crops because we&rsquo;re used to,</p>
<p>you know, you grow corn here, you grow wheat here</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re used to that&rsquo;s where the precipitation</p>
<p>and the temperature is the right for this kind of crop.</p>
<p>If this changes, and this is the same thing</p>
<p>with houses, if it gets colder, if it gets warmer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s suddenly uncomfortable</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve built your house wrong.</p>
<p>So our infrastructure will be wrong if the world changes,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what climate change does.</p>
<p>At a large scale.</p>
<p>Yes, and so this is a problem in most of these sentences,</p>
<p>but if you then sort of take it to the extreme</p>
<p>and say, well, imagine that you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>a huge sea level rise, imagine that you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>a very different sort of precipitation,</p>
<p>for instance, the, what is it?</p>
<p>The rain season, monsoon in the Indian subcontinent</p>
<p>changes dramatically.</p>
<p>That could affect a lot of agriculture</p>
<p>and make it really hard to imagine</p>
<p>that you could feed India well.</p>
<p>There are these kinds of things where you can imagine</p>
<p>and then that this would be very difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>And then if you add all of it up,</p>
<p>you could possibly get sort of a system collapse</p>
<p>because, you know, you just have too many problems.</p>
<p>Is it possible to model those kinds of things?</p>
<p>What I understand is the sea level rise itself</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the destructive thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that it creates migration patterns</p>
<p>and human tension, battle over resources,</p>
<p>and so you start to get these human things,</p>
<p>human conflict, so the big negative impact</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be necessarily from the fact</p>
<p>that you have to move your house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that once you move your house,</p>
<p>that means something else down the line.</p>
<p>And this is secondary, tertiary effects</p>
<p>that can have potentially to wars, military conflict,</p>
<p>can have destabilized entire economies,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff because of the migration pattern.</p>
<p>Is it possible to model those kinds of things?</p>
<p>So there are people who looked at this</p>
<p>and surprisingly, again, you know,</p>
<p>most people will move within their country</p>
<p>for a lot of different reasons,</p>
<p>but you know, mainly language and political structure.</p>
<p>You have your money, you have your relationships there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re gonna see these big moves,</p>
<p>you know, from the Southern Mexico</p>
<p>and Central America up to the US</p>
<p>or from Africa up to the EU.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not predominantly because of climate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of welfare opportunity.</p>
<p>You can make your life much, much better.</p>
<p>You can become much more productive</p>
<p>if you move into a richer country.</p>
<p>So yes, there are these issues.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re asking me for sort of</p>
<p>what is it that could really sort of break down the world?</p>
<p>I think the fundamental point is to recognize</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not like we haven&rsquo;t dealt</p>
<p>with huge challenges in the past</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve dealt with them really well.</p>
<p>So just one fun thing,</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to just look that up on Wikipedia,</p>
<p>the rising of Chicago.</p>
<p>So in the 1850s,</p>
<p>Chicago was a terribly dirty place</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t have good sewers.</p>
<p>And so they decided,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t really make up our mind,</p>
<p>they decided to raise Chicago one to two feet.</p>
<p>And so they simply took one block at a time.</p>
<p>They put like 50,000 jacks underneath a building</p>
<p>and they would just raise the building</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;d go on to the next building.</p>
<p>They raised all of Chicago one to two feet.</p>
<p>This is, you know, almost 200 years ago.</p>
<p>Of course, we will be able to deal with these things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;ll be fun or that it&rsquo;ll be cheap.</p>
<p>Of course, we would rather not have to deal with this.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re a very inventive species.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very unlikely that we&rsquo;ll not be able to-</p>
<p>What about COVID pandemic just said, hold my beer.</p>
<p>The response of human civilization to the COVID pandemic</p>
<p>seems to have not, they didn&rsquo;t find the car jacks.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Seems to have not been as effective</p>
<p>as I would have hoped for as a human</p>
<p>that believes in the basic competence of leadership</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It seems that given the COVID pandemic,</p>
<p>luckily did not turn out to be a pandemic</p>
<p>that would eradicate most of the human species,</p>
<p>which is something you always have to consider</p>
<p>and worry about, that I would have hoped</p>
<p>we would have less economic impact</p>
<p>and we would respond more effectively</p>
<p>and in terms of policy, in terms of socially,</p>
<p>medically, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So if the COVID pandemic brought the world to its knees,</p>
<p>then what does a sea level rise?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a different kind of thing</p>
<p>that happened in the COVID.</p>
<p>So politicians, a lot of politicians,</p>
<p>I think made certainly suboptimal decisions.</p>
<p>But I also find the fact that we actually managed</p>
<p>to get a vaccine in a year.</p>
<p>We should not be sort of unaware of the fact that,</p>
<p>yes, we did a lot of stupid stuff</p>
<p>and a lot of people were really, really annoyed,</p>
<p>but fundamentally, we fixed this.</p>
<p>We could have done it better and prettier.</p>
<p>I mean, I rode through the COVID pandemic</p>
<p>in Southern Sweden.</p>
<p>So, and yes, we can have that whole conversation.</p>
<p>It was certainly much easier to live there</p>
<p>than many other places.</p>
<p>But the fundamental point was, we actually fixed it.</p>
<p>So yes, we&rsquo;ll do, and we&rsquo;ll do that with climate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make a lot of bad decisions</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll waste a lot of money</p>
<p>like we do with all other problems.</p>
<p>But are we gonna fix this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you add on to that uncomfortable discussion</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s the worst thing that could possibly happen?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about the sea level rise component.</p>
<p>Certainly not nearly as much as the heat</p>
<p>and disruption of agriculture patterns and water supplies.</p>
<p>And a lot of it relates to, again,</p>
<p>path dependency and history.</p>
<p>Farmers are the heroes of humanity all through history</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re incredibly adaptable</p>
<p>if you give them access to resources.</p>
<p>In some cases, it&rsquo;s just crop insurance,</p>
<p>which is really basically still impossible</p>
<p>to get in big chunks of Africa</p>
<p>to get you through those hard spots.</p>
<p>But the heat issue is the one that&rsquo;s most,</p>
<p>the most basic element related to global warming</p>
<p>from CO2 buildup is hotter heat waves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still some lack of evidence</p>
<p>of the intensification,</p>
<p>but the duration and that&rsquo;s what really matters for heat</p>
<p>is how many days seems to be</p>
<p>very powerfully linked to global warming.</p>
<p>And so how many people die as a result of that is important.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about, maybe you can also educate me,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the average projection for the next 100 years</p>
<p>of the temperature rise?</p>
<p>Is it two degrees Celsius?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, although this gets us into the modeling realm.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re assuming, you have to assume</p>
<p>different emissions possibilities.</p>
<p>You have to assume we still don&rsquo;t know the basic physics,</p>
<p>like how many clouds form in a warming climate</p>
<p>and how that relates to limiting warming.</p>
<p>There are aspects of the fundamental warming question</p>
<p>that are still deeply uncertain.</p>
<p>But the debate is like two, three, or four Celsius.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in that range.</p>
<p>But the thing is, all of those are bad for,</p>
<p>this is an educational question.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like that much from a weather perspective</p>
<p>if you just turn up the AC and so on</p>
<p>in your own personal home.</p>
<p>But it is, from a global perspective,</p>
<p>a huge impact on agriculture.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and getting back to sea level and glaciers,</p>
<p>the melting point of ice is a number.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if you pass that number, things start to change.</p>
<p>What became known about Antarctica and Greenland more</p>
<p>is that its ocean temperature,</p>
<p>the seawater in and around and under these ice sheets,</p>
<p>because it kind of gets under parts of Antarctica,</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s driving the dynamics</p>
<p>that could lead to more abrupt change</p>
<p>more than air temperature.</p>
<p>Glaciers, these big ice sheets live or die</p>
<p>based on how much snow falls</p>
<p>and how much ice leaves every year.</p>
<p>And I was up on the Greenland ice sheet in 2004</p>
<p>and written about it forever since then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same amount of water that&rsquo;s in the Gulf of Mexico</p>
<p>as if God or some great force came down</p>
<p>and flash flows the Gulf of Mexico</p>
<p>and plunked it up on land, that&rsquo;s the ice sheet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 23 feet of sea level rise.</p>
<p>But you were not gonna melt it all.</p>
<p>And the pace at which that erosion begins</p>
<p>and becomes sort of a runaway train</p>
<p>is still not well understood.</p>
<p>That change from like a manageable level of sea level rise</p>
<p>from these ice sheets to something</p>
<p>that becomes truly unstoppable</p>
<p>or that has these discontinuities</p>
<p>where you get a lot more all of a sudden,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t, to me, it&rsquo;s in the realm of</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ve taken to calling known unknowables.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t count on another IPCC report,</p>
<p>magically including science,</p>
<p>that says, aha, now we know it&rsquo;s gonna be five feet by 2100.</p>
<p>Because learning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of negative learning in science.</p>
<p>This may be true in your body of science too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Jeremy Bassis, B-A-S-S-I-S,</p>
<p>who wrote a paper about the idea</p>
<p>that you could get this sudden cliff breakdown</p>
<p>of these ice shelves around Antarctica</p>
<p>leading to rapid sea level rise.</p>
<p>He did more modeling in physics</p>
<p>and it turns out that you end up with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a much more progressive and self-limiting phenomenon.</p>
<p>But those papers don&rsquo;t get any attention in the media</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not scary.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not scary and they&rsquo;re sort of after the fact.</p>
<p>Just this past year,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been this cycle around collapse,</p>
<p>the word collapse, and Antarctic ice.</p>
<p>It started actually several years ago</p>
<p>with the idea that the West Antarctic ice sheet</p>
<p>is particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>And some paper, everyone, the science community,</p>
<p>like the birds, we were talking about flux to it</p>
<p>and some high profile papers are written.</p>
<p>And then a deeper inquiry reveals,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s more complicated than that.</p>
<p>And we, the journalists, the media,</p>
<p>pundits don&rsquo;t pay attention to that stuff.</p>
<p>And actually,</p>
<p>which is why I started to develop kind of a dictionary.</p>
<p>I call it watch words, like words to,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re out there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re just a public,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a person and you wanna know what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>You hear these words like collapse in the context of ice.</p>
<p>What do you do with that?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve created conversations around these words.</p>
<p>Geologists and ice scientists use the word collapse.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about a centuries long process.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not talking about the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>And scientists would do well to be more careful</p>
<p>with words like that.</p>
<p>Unless your focus is what we were saying earlier,</p>
<p>your idea that alarming people will spur them to act,</p>
<p>then you use that word carelessly.</p>
<p>Can I just follow up on the other point that you said,</p>
<p>you know, two, three, four degrees,</p>
<p>you know, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like much.</p>
<p>I can just crank up the air conditioning.</p>
<p>I think that sort of touches</p>
<p>on a really, really important point</p>
<p>that for most rich people,</p>
<p>much of climate change</p>
<p>is not really gonna be all that impactful.</p>
<p>It still will have an impact,</p>
<p>but fundamentally, if you&rsquo;re well off,</p>
<p>you can mitigate a lot of these impacts.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a young scientist at Carnegie Mellon,</p>
<p>Destiny Nock.</p>
<p>She just was the lead author on a study</p>
<p>what poor and prosperous households do in a heat wave</p>
<p>when they have access to air conditioning.</p>
<p>In a poor household, you wait,</p>
<p>they found through science,</p>
<p>they delay turning on the air conditioner</p>
<p>four to seven degrees more of heating</p>
<p>before they start to use the air conditioner.</p>
<p>And that can create adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>If you have an asthmatic in the house, an old person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re endangering their lives.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a little, tiny, microscopic,</p>
<p>fractal example of this powerful, real phenomenon</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a divide in vulnerability,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just based on where you live.</p>
<p>This is families in like Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re not talking about, you know, Botswana.</p>
<p>And so that divide in capacity</p>
<p>to deal with environmental stress</p>
<p>is something you can really work on.</p>
<p>And it gets hidden in all this talk of climate crisis.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the important parts is both to say,</p>
<p>look, if 7 billion people, sorry, 8 billion people</p>
<p>will now have all experienced this,</p>
<p>even though for each one of them, it&rsquo;s manageable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still a big problem because it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>8 billion people living through this.</p>
<p>And the second-</p>
<p>And how&rsquo;s the air conditioning 8 billion people?</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s the point of getting to realize</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, very much about how do you help the world&rsquo;s poor?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very much about making it more affordable,</p>
<p>basically getting them out of poverty.</p>
<p>And remember, getting out of poverty doesn&rsquo;t just mean</p>
<p>that they can now afford to air condition themselves,</p>
<p>but they get better education,</p>
<p>they get better opportunities,</p>
<p>they get better lives in so many other ways.</p>
<p>And then at the end of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about making sure</p>
<p>that we focus on this one problem,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s recognizing that these families</p>
<p>and have lots of different issues that they would like us</p>
<p>to focus on climate and heat waves just being one of them.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s sort of taking progressive steps back</p>
<p>and realizing, all right, okay, this is a problem,</p>
<p>not the end of the world.</p>
<p>And one tiny little last example,</p>
<p>you mentioned Jakarta at the beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really valuable to look around the world</p>
<p>at places that are sort of leading indicator places,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s sea level rise or heat.</p>
<p>And you could do that.</p>
<p>Jakarta is sinking like a foot a year,</p>
<p>literally a foot a year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some insane number,</p>
<p>from withdrawing groundwater,</p>
<p>from a gas withdrawal from, it&rsquo;s a delta,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s sediment, it&rsquo;s built on sediment.</p>
<p>I wrote a piece ages ago,</p>
<p>the New York Times is calling it Delta Blues,</p>
<p>you know, all the musicians.</p>
<p>And in Jakarta, so what are they doing?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re moving, they&rsquo;re moving the capital to another area.</p>
<p>And so that says to me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of plasticity too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a city that&rsquo;s going through this,</p>
<p>that rate of sea level,</p>
<p>of their relationship with the sea level through sinking</p>
<p>is way faster than what&rsquo;s happening with global warming.</p>
<p>So look there, look to those kinds of places</p>
<p>and you can start to build.</p>
<p>Tokyo had the same thing in the 1930s.</p>
<p>They were also withdrawing lots of water way too fast.</p>
<p>And so, you know, one of the obvious things is</p>
<p>maybe you should just stop withdrawing water so fast.</p>
<p>And again, we seem to almost be intent on finding</p>
<p>the most politically correct way to fix a problem</p>
<p>or, you know, the thing that sort of gets the most clicks</p>
<p>instead of the thing that actually works the best.</p>
<p>So a lot of these things are really, you know,</p>
<p>not rocket science solutions.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Let me add one more on top of the pile</p>
<p>of the worst case analysis.</p>
<p>So what people talk about,</p>
<p>which is hurricanes and earthquakes,</p>
<p>is there a connection that&rsquo;s well understood</p>
<p>between climate change and the increased frequency</p>
<p>and intensity of hurricanes and earthquakes?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dug in on both a lot.</p>
<p>The earthquake connection to climate change</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about compared to just the earthquake risk</p>
<p>that we live with in many parts of the world already.</p>
<p>The Himalayas, even with that earthquake in 2015</p>
<p>in Kathmandu, that whole range is overdue</p>
<p>for major earthquakes.</p>
<p>And what has happened in the last 50 years</p>
<p>since they last had big earthquakes, huge development,</p>
<p>big cities, a lot of informal construction,</p>
<p>like the stuff I wrote about in Istanbul,</p>
<p>where the family builds another layer and another,</p>
<p>they put a floor on every time someone gets married</p>
<p>and has kids, you put another floor in the house.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>what was the term, this Turkish engineer,</p>
<p>rubble in waiting.</p>
<p>Rubble in waiting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rubble in waiting.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re looking at it, you know, I&rsquo;m videotaping it</p>
<p>and there are people playing there.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t worry about the earthquake connection</p>
<p>to climate change.</p>
<p>The hurricanes I&rsquo;ve written about for decades.</p>
<p>And the most illuminating body of science</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve dug in on, literally, related to hurricanes</p>
<p>is this field that&rsquo;s emerged.</p>
<p>It gets a tiny bit of money compared to climate modeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called paleotempestology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like paleontology, you know.</p>
<p>They look for evidence of past hurricanes</p>
<p>along coasts that we care about.</p>
<p>And they dig down into the lagoons behind,</p>
<p>like the barrier beaches along Florida</p>
<p>or the Carolinas or in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>And what you have is a history book of past hurricanes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud,</p>
<p>you know, accumulating over centuries.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a layer of sand and seashells.</p>
<p>And what that indicates is that there was a great storm</p>
<p>that came across the beach,</p>
<p>pushed a lot of sediment into the mud.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud, mud.</p>
<p>And when you look at that work,</p>
<p>I first wrote about this in 2001 in the Times,</p>
<p>a long story.</p>
<p>And then I kept track of these intrepid scientists</p>
<p>putting these core tubes down.</p>
<p>It shows you that we&rsquo;re in a landscape</p>
<p>where big, bad hurricanes are not, they&rsquo;re the norm.</p>
<p>But something that&rsquo;s rare and big</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s extreme.</p>
<p>When you think about the word extreme, right,</p>
<p>it means it&rsquo;s at the end of the spectrum of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re rare.</p>
<p>Rare in human timescales.</p>
<p>Hurricane Michael, four years ago, devastated.</p>
<p>Category five came ashore in the panhandle of Florida,</p>
<p>leveled that much photographed town, Mexico Beach.</p>
<p>And people were, actually,</p>
<p>the Tallahassee National Weather Service</p>
<p>said unprecedented hurricane.</p>
<p>The damage was unprecedented</p>
<p>because there hadn&rsquo;t been a community there before.</p>
<p>But the hurricane was not unprecedented at all.</p>
<p>If you look at the history,</p>
<p>and this is published research,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that no one bothers to,</p>
<p>we have this blind spot for the longer timescale</p>
<p>you need to examine if you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about big, bad things that are rare.</p>
<p>And hurricanes are still rare.</p>
<p>I was recently covering Fort Myers, the awful devastation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a young climate scientist</p>
<p>at Florida Gulf Coast University, Joe Muller,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s done that paleotempestology work there,</p>
<p>right in Fort Myers.</p>
<p>She lives there, and she was away in London</p>
<p>at a meeting of reinsurance companies</p>
<p>that reinsure all the world&rsquo;s big, bad risks</p>
<p>when this was happening.</p>
<p>But she has done the work that shows,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a thousand-year record of past hurricanes,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s super sobering</p>
<p>when you consider how fast people have moved into Florida</p>
<p>and built vulnerably in an area</p>
<p>that hurricanes will hammer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the fundamental dynamics</p>
<p>of the Gulf of Mexico,</p>
<p>and these storms come off of Africa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place where they will come.</p>
<p>Now, the question of global warming impact is subtle.</p>
<p>There are aspects of hurricanes that haven&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s aspects like rainfall</p>
<p>that seem pretty powerfully linked to global warming.</p>
<p>A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture,</p>
<p>so when you have a big disturbance</p>
<p>like the heat engine of a hurricane comes through it,</p>
<p>you get more rain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s rapid intensification.</p>
<p>You know how quickly these storms jump</p>
<p>from category one to five or four before they hit</p>
<p>is a new area of science.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s still early days in knowing,</p>
<p>because no one was looking for that.</p>
<p>There were no data back 300 years ago</p>
<p>when these big, bad previous hurricanes came</p>
<p>to know whether they were rapidly intensified or not.</p>
<p>So as a journalist, I try to keep track</p>
<p>of what we don&rsquo;t know, not to be too constrained,</p>
<p>and think about new science as being robust</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s considering and actually actively stating</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s going on with earlier hurricanes.</p>
<p>And all of that is swamped ultimately, literally,</p>
<p>by the vulnerability, building vulnerability in these areas.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a marginal change in a storm</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve quadrupled or sextupled how much stuff</p>
<p>and how many people are in the way,</p>
<p>and if some of those people are poor and vulnerable</p>
<p>or elderly and can&rsquo;t swim,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re creating a landscape of destruction.</p>
<p>So a lot of the human suffering that has to do with storms</p>
<p>is about where and how you build</p>
<p>versus the frequency and the intensity of storms.</p>
<p>Still, you didn&rsquo;t quite answer the question.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m having a beer with people at a bar</p>
<p>and they say, hey, why are you having a beer?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all going to die because of climate change,</p>
<p>usually what they bring up,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just trying to add some levity here.</p>
<p>No, this is good.</p>
<p>Usually what they bring up is the hurricanes</p>
<p>and the most recent hurricane,</p>
<p>saying they&rsquo;re getting crazy, hurricanes all the time,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting more intense, more frequent, and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s incredible science going on</p>
<p>trying to look at this.</p>
<p>Is there evidence, and is it possible to have evidence</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a connection between</p>
<p>what we can call global warming</p>
<p>and the increased frequency and intensity of storms?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, no, thank you.</p>
<p>Well, you added intensity.</p>
<p>Let me just get into this a tiny bit more.</p>
<p>I mean, hurricanes,</p>
<p>I grew up with them in Rhode Island in my youth,</p>
<p>and there was a very active period of hurricanes</p>
<p>in New England in the 50s and 60s, 70s,</p>
<p>and then in the North Atlantic generally</p>
<p>was very, very active in the 50s when I was a kid,</p>
<p>and the dynamics of them forming off of Africa</p>
<p>and coming here, circling up the coast</p>
<p>was just prime time.</p>
<p>Then there was like what Kerry Emanuel,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the most experienced hurricane climate scientist</p>
<p>around at MIT, he&rsquo;s in this story,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in my 1988 article.</p>
<p>He and colleagues have found, and others,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s what they call a hurricane drought</p>
<p>from like the 70s through about 1994 in the Atlantic,</p>
<p>specifically the Atlantic Basin,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been a lot of questions about that.</p>
<p>People thought it was ocean circulation,</p>
<p>something about the currents.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s these multi-decadal variabilities</p>
<p>in the oceans, right?</p>
<p>And then now it looks robustly,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t find a climate scientist who disagrees</p>
<p>that the thing that caused the drought</p>
<p>was pollution, smog,</p>
<p>and significantly in Europe.</p>
<p>And you say, well, how does smog in Europe</p>
<p>relate to hurricanes crossing the Atlantic</p>
<p>and getting to the United States?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of the smog was changing</p>
<p>the behavior of the Sahara Desert,</p>
<p>which is just south of Europe.</p>
<p>And the Sahara Desert kills hurricanes.</p>
<p>Sand and dust coming off the Sahara,</p>
<p>you can see this every year.</p>
<p>When that&rsquo;s active, it stifles these big storms.</p>
<p>At the point, right in their nursery,</p>
<p>they all form, there&rsquo;s this area for hurricanes</p>
<p>off of West Africa, that&rsquo;s like the nursery zone.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re stifling those hurricanes</p>
<p>because of pollution in Europe</p>
<p>before the Clean Air Act&rsquo;s cleanups,</p>
<p>and then that goes away,</p>
<p>none of that has anything to do with global warming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another kind of forcing in the climate system,</p>
<p>a local one that created a regional dynamic</p>
<p>that created a quiet period</p>
<p>when all these friends in the bar,</p>
<p>maybe they were born in the 90s or whatever,</p>
<p>they grew up in an area of like,</p>
<p>you know, hurricanes weren&rsquo;t a big deal.</p>
<p>And now we have an end to that drought</p>
<p>because we cleaned up the air pollution,</p>
<p>the sooty kind of air pollution, sulfur-y.</p>
<p>And anyone who says global warming, global warming,</p>
<p>without saying, well, that&rsquo;s in there too,</p>
<p>is kind of missing that.</p>
<p>And when you look globally,</p>
<p>still, I think, what is it, 90 or so hurricanes a year,</p>
<p>cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons globally.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>The number of these tropical storms</p>
<p>that reach that ferocity has not changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a fundamental dynamic of,</p>
<p>and by the way, on the long-time scale,</p>
<p>the models still indicate as you warm the planet,</p>
<p>and remember, the Arctic warms quicker.</p>
<p>This is something people probably understand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually evening out the imbalance</p>
<p>between the heat at the equator</p>
<p>and the cold in the northern part of the hemisphere,</p>
<p>and that calms the whole system down.</p>
<p>So there could be fewer hurricanes later in the century</p>
<p>because of global warming.</p>
<p>And for me, that&rsquo;s a lot of information,</p>
<p>but if I&rsquo;m in a bar, I start with, what do you care about?</p>
<p>You care about safety, you care about security,</p>
<p>you care about having everybody safe, not just you.</p>
<p>You get in your car and you can evacuate.</p>
<p>What about the old person or the poor family</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t do that, they&rsquo;re not gonna leave their house?</p>
<p>What are we doing to limit vulnerability now?</p>
<p>I circle back to that over and over again.</p>
<p>I have a pocket card,</p>
<p>I have this graphic card I created about risk,</p>
<p>and what we really care about is climate risk.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s at risk?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s driving the risk?</p>
<p>How do you reduce that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a card, you can almost pull it out in a bar.</p>
<p>I should print them.</p>
<p>You should do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, risk is the hazard.</p>
<p>Climate bar, Pat.</p>
<p>Risk is the hazard, the hazard is a storm.</p>
<p>Times exposure, how many people, how much stuff,</p>
<p>factoring in vulnerability or resilience.</p>
<p>And climate change is changing the hazard for some things,</p>
<p>not for tornadoes, not for everything.</p>
<p>Exposure is this expanding bullseye.</p>
<p>This is another hashtag, expanding bullseye.</p>
<p>Get out there and look for that,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m pushing these two geographers</p>
<p>to do this for every hazard.</p>
<p>Wildfire, earthquake, flood, coastal storm,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re building an expanding bullseye in an area,</p>
<p>and nature&rsquo;s throwing darts.</p>
<p>Some of the darts are getting bigger</p>
<p>because of global warming, some of the darts we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>Well, you get out of the way.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna be on the dartboard.</p>
<p>And it just simplifies the whole formula.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s kind of a transformational potential</p>
<p>to go into a bar.</p>
<p>Maybe I should print these things.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>And I should go drink it with you more often.</p>
<p>There should be coasters in bars.</p>
<p>Because that was fascinating about smog.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s nice to be reminded</p>
<p>about how complicated and fascinating the weather system is.</p>
<p>Let me try to answer the questions slightly quicker</p>
<p>before your friends have drunk too much.</p>
<p>Never enough.</p>
<p>Or not enough.</p>
<p>So if you look at the amount of the number of hurricanes,</p>
<p>as Andy rightly pointed out,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s changing.</p>
<p>So we see more because we have now much better</p>
<p>detection systems with satellites.</p>
<p>But if you look since 1980,</p>
<p>when we have good satellite coverage,</p>
<p>for instance, last year was the year</p>
<p>that had the lowest number of hurricanes in the world.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re sort of like, that&rsquo;s odd</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s probably the year</p>
<p>where I heard the most about hurricanes.</p>
<p>And what that tells you is that</p>
<p>just because you hear a lot about hurricanes</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t actually mean that there is a lot of hurricanes.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just go that way.</p>
<p>If you remember in the 1990s and 2000s,</p>
<p>there was an enormous amount of talk about how violence,</p>
<p>how crime was getting worse in the US,</p>
<p>while all the objective indicators</p>
<p>showed that it was going down.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s sufficient amount of violence</p>
<p>that you can fill every radio and TV show with a new crime.</p>
<p>And so if you get more and more TV shows</p>
<p>that talk about crime,</p>
<p>actually most people end up thinking that there&rsquo;s more crime</p>
<p>while the real number is going down.</p>
<p>So the reality here is yes,</p>
<p>climate change will probably affect hurricanes</p>
<p>in the sense that they&rsquo;ll be the same number</p>
<p>or slightly fewer as Andy was mentioning,</p>
<p>but they will likely be somewhat stronger.</p>
<p>This seems to be the best outcome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sure, but this seems to be the outcome.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important to remember,</p>
<p>stronger is worse than fewer is better.</p>
<p>So overall, climate will make the world a little bit worse.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the sort of bottom line,</p>
<p>but, and that&rsquo;s the real issue here,</p>
<p>all the other things,</p>
<p>the fact that people are much more vulnerable</p>
<p>is just vastly outweigh this.</p>
<p>Which is why, if you look at the impact of hurricanes</p>
<p>and impact of pretty much everything,</p>
<p>it is typically going down.</p>
<p>If you look, for instance, in percent of GDP,</p>
<p>you have to look at percent of GDP</p>
<p>because if you have twice as many houses,</p>
<p>obviously the same kind of impact will have twice the impact</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re worth twice as much.</p>
<p>If you do that in percent of GDP,</p>
<p>and even the UN says that&rsquo;s how you should measure it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going down.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re becoming more resilient.</p>
<p>Just simply, if you look at what happens</p>
<p>when hurricanes come in,</p>
<p>we have much better prediction in the long run.</p>
<p>That means you now know two or three days out</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a big hurricane that&rsquo;s likely to come here.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>All the things that can be moved.</p>
<p>So typically all buses, all trucks,</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s not bolted down will leave this area.</p>
<p>And so you will get less damage from that.</p>
<p>You will have more people knowing,</p>
<p>oh, this is gonna be a big one.</p>
<p>They move to their relative somewhere else.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll have fewer people being vulnerable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot-</p>
<p>If people are responsive and aware.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of way you can do this.</p>
<p>So the outcome,</p>
<p>and this is important for the whole conversation,</p>
<p>the outcome is that we&rsquo;re actually becoming less vulnerable</p>
<p>and that damages are becoming smaller, not bigger.</p>
<p>But had there not been global warming,</p>
<p>it would probably have gone down even faster.</p>
<p>So we would have become even better off quicker</p>
<p>had there been no global warming.</p>
<p>But this is a crucial difference.</p>
<p>And this is what I find really hard to communicate.</p>
<p>Climate change is not this,</p>
<p>oh my God, everything is going off the charts</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all gonna be doomed kind of thing.</p>
<p>Climate change is a thing that means</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get better slightly slower.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very, very different kind of attitude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the many problems</p>
<p>rather than this is the end of all of us.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>if you look at what&rsquo;s happening in the world,</p>
<p>the data also show that in rich places and poor places,</p>
<p>we still are moving into zones of hazard</p>
<p>faster than climate is changing.</p>
<p>Beth Tellman was at Columbia and she moved to Arizona.</p>
<p>She and colleagues at this outfit called Cloud to Street</p>
<p>did an amazing study showing,</p>
<p>this is a year or so ago I wrote about,</p>
<p>showing, again, we&rsquo;re moving into zones of hazard,</p>
<p>which it applies to me,</p>
<p>just what Bjorn was saying,</p>
<p>that people wouldn&rsquo;t be doing that</p>
<p>if they thought that was gonna lead to devastation.</p>
<p>And this is today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing this now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s flood zones, wildfire zones.</p>
<p>So that means there&rsquo;s these things to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much plasticity in human behavior</p>
<p>and how we build and where we build.</p>
<p>You can make a big, big change in the outcomes.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things to remember is</p>
<p>people move to where hurricanes hit</p>
<p>because when they&rsquo;re not there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really beautiful place to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>In many ways, we make the trade-offs and say,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m happy to have an ocean view</p>
<p>and then maybe a hurricane&rsquo;s gonna hit.</p>
<p>And of course, it becomes a lot easier</p>
<p>than when the federal government</p>
<p>is actually subsidizing your risk</p>
<p>by saying we&rsquo;ll insure you really cheaply.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things that we should stop doing.</p>
<p>We should actually tell people,</p>
<p>look, if you wanna live where hurricanes hit,</p>
<p>maybe you should be more careful.</p>
<p>And by the way, what I was saying about past storms,</p>
<p>the paleotempestology, past fires, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve suppressed fire in the United States for 100 years</p>
<p>through much of the West,</p>
<p>through wanting to save the forests,</p>
<p>the whole Smokey the Bear thing, don&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>When these are landscapes that evolved to burn</p>
<p>and what happened in the last 100 years,</p>
<p>a lot of people love the West.</p>
<p>We love these environments.</p>
<p>We love to live with the trees.</p>
<p>The Boulder County area, the explosive development</p>
<p>in zones of implicit hazard leads to big bad outcomes</p>
<p>when conditions align</p>
<p>and climate change is worsening some of those conditions.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s really counterintuitive.</p>
<p>A wet season builds more grass.</p>
<p>A dry season comes along, parches the grass.</p>
<p>Then comes a human ignition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost always human ignitions.</p>
<p>And then you have this disaster</p>
<p>where a thousand homes burn in Boulder County.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s so many elements there</p>
<p>that can be worked on that give me confidence</p>
<p>that we can change these outcomes.</p>
<p>Natural disasters are not natural.</p>
<p>Disasters are designed, really, as some people say.</p>
<p>Can I take a quick aside and ask about terminology</p>
<p>of climate change and global warming?</p>
<p>Because we use it interchangeably.</p>
<p>It is an aside, but it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s worthy of taking.</p>
<p>Do those carry different meanings?</p>
<p>And has that meaning changed over the years?</p>
<p>Between those two terms, are they really equivalent?</p>
<p>Well, some people say there was this industry</p>
<p>or propagandistic shift from,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see, what was it, which came first?</p>
<p>Oh, no, they&rsquo;re going to climate change now.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s a new thing, which is, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the Intergovernmental Panel on Global Warming.</p>
<p>It was on climate change.</p>
<p>So these terms have been there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been sort of evolving.</p>
<p>When I wrote this cover story, it was the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fallen out of favor.</p>
<p>Greenhouse effect is not often talked about.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s really, that&rsquo;s the physical effect</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s holding in the heat.</p>
<p>But see, there&rsquo;s terms that mean stuff,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s terms that are actually used in public discourse</p>
<p>to designate a whole umbrella of opinions you have.</p>
<p>And I guess as somebody, me,</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to this carefully,</p>
<p>you have to use terms carefully.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Because people will, you know,</p>
<p>a noob that rolls into the topic will often use terms</p>
<p>to mean exactly what they mean, like literally.</p>
<p>But they actually have political implications,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So I guess I&rsquo;m asking, is there like,</p>
<p>are you signaling something by using global warming</p>
<p>versus climate change?</p>
<p>Or people have calmed down in terms of the use of these?</p>
<p>No, no, well, the Guardian newspapers made it worse.</p>
<p>Now they have their style book.</p>
<p>You know, every newspaper has a,</p>
<p>they prescribe, they don&rsquo;t want their reporters</p>
<p>to use any of those terms anymore.</p>
<p>They call it climate crisis, climate emergency.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Global heating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally in their rule book.</p>
<p>Global heating, that sounds more intense.</p>
<p>Global heating.</p>
<p>And that was the point.</p>
<p>Well, I wrote about the global heating thing</p>
<p>more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been around.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re doing the, what was the movie where the,</p>
<p>the comedy, the rock and roll comedy where he sets his,</p>
<p>To 11, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>His amplifier goes to 11.</p>
<p>You know, the idea that you turn up the rhetorical volume</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna change people is ridiculous.</p>
<p>So for me, I mean, I use global warming</p>
<p>and climate change interchangeably.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some technical ways that you can differentiate them.</p>
<p>But the reality is that global warming</p>
<p>is probably a better way to describe a lot of it</p>
<p>because this is really what is the main driver</p>
<p>of what we worry about.</p>
<p>Climate change seems a little diffuse,</p>
<p>but you know, it&rsquo;s convenient to,</p>
<p>when you talk about climate all the time,</p>
<p>that you can call both of them.</p>
<p>But I think the climate crisis and the climate catastrophe</p>
<p>is really sort of, this is the amping up of a catastrophe.</p>
<p>And again, as we&rsquo;ve talked about before,</p>
<p>if it really were true, we should tell people.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s not true, and I think there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons</p>
<p>why this is not a climate catastrophe, this is a problem,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually doing everyone a disservice</p>
<p>because we end up making people so worried</p>
<p>that they say, we got to fix this in 12 years</p>
<p>or whatever the number is.</p>
<p>And also that it makes it almost impossible</p>
<p>to have a conversation of, you know,</p>
<p>well, maybe we should be focusing on vulnerability first.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, and I think a lot of well-meaning</p>
<p>and well-intentioned people feel that it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>sacrilegious to do, you know,</p>
<p>to say it&rsquo;s about vulnerability</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re taking away the guilt of climate change.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking away our focus on dealing with climate change,</p>
<p>whereas I think we would say,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s about stuff that actually works</p>
<p>and, you know, doing that first.</p>
<p>Well, and by making it about carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re implicitly making it about fossil fuels,</p>
<p>which implicitly gives you another great narrative,</p>
<p>good guy, bad guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these big companies.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the source of alarmism?</p>
<p>So is it the IPCC,</p>
<p>the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a chain here.</p>
<p>Is there somebody to blame along the chain</p>
<p>or is this some kind of weird complex system</p>
<p>where everybody encourages each other?</p>
<p>Can you point to one place?</p>
<p>Is it the media?</p>
<p>Is it the scientists?</p>
<p>I think the UN Climate Panel</p>
<p>is fundamentally a really good climate research group.</p>
<p>You can have some quibbles with the way</p>
<p>that they sort of summarize it</p>
<p>in politically coordinated documents and stuff.</p>
<p>But, you know, fundamentally,</p>
<p>I think they do a good job</p>
<p>of putting together all the research.</p>
<p>This also means it&rsquo;s incredibly boring to read,</p>
<p>which is why virtually nobody does it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you have,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure a lot of climate journalists</p>
<p>have never sort of looked past</p>
<p>at least the summary for policymakers.</p>
<p>So the UN Climate Panel, they do predictions as well?</p>
<p>Well, they pull together all the stuff</p>
<p>that people have published in the period literature</p>
<p>and then try to summarize it and basically tell you,</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s up and down with climate change.</p>
<p>They do that in four large volumes</p>
<p>every four to five to six, seven years or something.</p>
<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the gold-plated version of what we know.</p>
<p>There tends to be a lot of,</p>
<p>well, this is what they say.</p>
<p>Actually, they say so many different places</p>
<p>with so many different people</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not quite clear exactly what they&rsquo;re saying often.</p>
<p>You know, you can sort of find contradictions</p>
<p>between one volume with one set of authors and another.</p>
<p>But yeah, look, I think this is fundamentally</p>
<p>the right way that we know about climate,</p>
<p>but then it gets translated into,</p>
<p>how do you know about this?</p>
<p>When most people don&rsquo;t read these 4,000 pages,</p>
<p>you read a news story in a newspaper</p>
<p>and that news story will be very heavily slanted towards,</p>
<p>you know, if you say,</p>
<p>so sea levels could rise somewhere</p>
<p>between one and three foot, what do you hear?</p>
<p>Yeah, you obviously hear the three foot.</p>
<p>Three foot is just, you know, more fun, more scary,</p>
<p>more interesting than one foot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that way with all of these, you know,</p>
<p>so what&rsquo;s the prediction for temperature rises?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhere from not very scary to pretty damn scary.</p>
<p>And again, you hear the pretty damn scary all the time.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s obviously always researchers</p>
<p>who are saying, well,</p>
<p>but actually it could be a little more scary than that.</p>
<p>And then there are likewise researchers who say,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s probably not gonna be as scary as that.</p>
<p>And most of the journalists will, you know, interview-</p>
<p>Do you really put the blame fundamentally on the journalist?</p>
<p>I put it on the media setup.</p>
<p>Look, media is simply trying to get clicks</p>
<p>or sell newspapers.</p>
<p>And if you were just gonna say, this is not a big issue,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t sell anything.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;re probably much better able to address this.</p>
<p>Well, no, folks can Google for my name, Revkin,</p>
<p>and the words front page thought</p>
<p>in the newsroom every afternoon.</p>
<p>Now we have a 24-7 news cycle, so it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>But back in the day, the New York Times,</p>
<p>when it was a flourishing print institution,</p>
<p>every afternoon there was a front page meeting</p>
<p>and the big poobah editors would go in there</p>
<p>and the desk editors come in with their pitches for the day.</p>
<p>And my friend, Corey Dean,</p>
<p>who was the science editor for a chunk of my time,</p>
<p>you know, I remember having a conversation with her</p>
<p>about some new study of, I think it was Greenland,</p>
<p>the ice sheet, and I laid it out for her.</p>
<p>And she said, where&rsquo;s the front page thought in that?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all set up to look for the, that.</p>
<p>Scary bit.</p>
<p>And the news environment has gotten so much worse</p>
<p>than 10 or 20 years ago.</p>
<p>At least you had filters and limited number of outlets</p>
<p>and there was some sense you could track what&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of problems with that system too.</p>
<p>But now you have an information buffet.</p>
<p>So if you wanna be alarmed</p>
<p>or you wanna be, stay in the tribe</p>
<p>of those who think this is utter bull,</p>
<p>you can find your flow.</p>
<p>And that has led,</p>
<p>but getting back to this specific question,</p>
<p>the 2018 IPCC report, which was a special report</p>
<p>commissioned to learn about the difference</p>
<p>between 1.5 degrees of warming and two,</p>
<p>which sounds so weird and technocratic and complicated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one that generated the whole meme</p>
<p>about eight years left.</p>
<p>12 years.</p>
<p>Till doomsday.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the one.</p>
<p>This was the idea that there&rsquo;s a point we&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t cut emissions in half by whatever it was,</p>
<p>2050, we&rsquo;re doomed.</p>
<p>That emerged from that specific report.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t something that was in the report.</p>
<p>It was in the spin around the report.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what captivated Greta appropriately</p>
<p>as a young person going,</p>
<p>and with her unique vantage point and stuff.</p>
<p>And that report, I still need to dig in</p>
<p>and write something deeper about</p>
<p>what happened with that particular dynamics,</p>
<p>created this recent burst of we&rsquo;re doomed rhetoric</p>
<p>that I think you&rsquo;re focusing on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all in the external interpretations,</p>
<p>which journalism laps up</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re looking for the front page thought.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just the journalists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the whole system, NGOs, environmental groups.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, in developing country,</p>
<p>well-meaning leaders in developing countries,</p>
<p>because of the structure of this treaty</p>
<p>that goes back to 1992,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the Paris Agreement is part of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re now really looking for a way</p>
<p>to portray this as a CO2 problem, not a vulnerability.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a vulnerability aspect,</p>
<p>but like in Pakistan, their climate minister,</p>
<p>which they didn&rsquo;t even have a climate minister</p>
<p>five years ago,</p>
<p>is blaming everything that happened in Pakistan</p>
<p>on carbon dioxide, warming the climate,</p>
<p>creating this, when a lot of what was going on</p>
<p>was also on the ground.</p>
<p>And you can blame colonialism, Pakistan&rsquo;s history,</p>
<p>all kinds of things.</p>
<p>But under the treaty, you want it to be about CO2</p>
<p>because that puts the onus on rich countries.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not paying us.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s our money?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>In the context of what everyone agreed to,</p>
<p>there was supposed to be $100 billion a year</p>
<p>from rich countries to poor countries.</p>
<p>Starting in 2020, it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, basically, some money is flowing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really people.</p>
<p>Made up money.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so that whole dynamic,</p>
<p>they latch onto the climate science and they,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re there, and they&rsquo;re very handy, quotable people.</p>
<p>And you have a justice angle.</p>
<p>You have bad guys and good guys,</p>
<p>which fits all of these narrative threads</p>
<p>that come together into this information storm</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still living with.</p>
<p>And then, of course, it&rsquo;s not Pakistan&rsquo;s fault either.</p>
<p>I mean, it also actually, almost all leaders now</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s because of climate, because then it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.</p>
<p>In Germany, for instance, when we had that flood last year,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not impossible that climate had a part in that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very, very clear that the main reason</p>
<p>why so many people died in Germany and Belgium</p>
<p>was because the alarm systems didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And this was plainly the local leaders in Germany.</p>
<p>Now, if I&rsquo;m stuck here and basically have caused</p>
<p>the death of 200 people, would I rather say,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s on me, or would I say climate?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just such an easy scapegoat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to place it all on the journalists, I think,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of, if I were to think about,</p>
<p>what did you call it, front-page thought,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of really narratives</p>
<p>that result in destruction of the human species,</p>
<p>a nuclear war, pandemics, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It seems like climate is a sticky one.</p>
<p>So the fact that it&rsquo;s sticky means</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other interests at play,</p>
<p>like you guys are talking about,</p>
<p>in terms of politics, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the journalists.</p>
<p>I feel like journalists will try anything</p>
<p>for the front page, but it won&rsquo;t stick</p>
<p>unless there is bigger interests at play</p>
<p>for which these narratives are useful.</p>
<p>So journalists will just throw stuff out there</p>
<p>and see if it gets clicks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a first spark, maybe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe a tiny catalyst of the initial steps,</p>
<p>but it has to be picked up by the politicians,</p>
<p>by interest groups, and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, Bjorn, about the first part of the subtitle.</p>
<p>How climate change panic costs us trillions.</p>
<p>How does climate change panic cost us trillions?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re basically deciding to make policies</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll have fairly little impact,</p>
<p>even in 50 or 100 years,</p>
<p>that literally cost trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you two examples.</p>
<p>So the European Union is trying to go to net zero.</p>
<p>So our attempt to go halfway there by 2030</p>
<p>will cost about a trillion dollars a year.</p>
<p>And yet the net impact will be almost unmeasurable</p>
<p>by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the EU and the rich countries</p>
<p>is a fairly small part of the emissions</p>
<p>that are gonna come out in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Now, we used to be a big part of it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mainly because nobody else,</p>
<p>it was just the US and Europe and a few others</p>
<p>that put out CO2 in the 20th century.</p>
<p>So we used to be big, but in the 21st century,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be a small bit player.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re basically spending a lot of money,</p>
<p>and remember, a trillion dollars is a lot of money</p>
<p>that could have been spent on a lot of things</p>
<p>that could have made humanity better,</p>
<p>on something that will only make us tiny bit better.</p>
<p>Now, it will do some good,</p>
<p>but the reasonable estimates is</p>
<p>if you do a cost benefit analysis,</p>
<p>and again, technically it&rsquo;s really, really complicated,</p>
<p>but the basic idea is very, very simple.</p>
<p>You just simply say, what are all the costs on one side</p>
<p>and what are all the benefits?</p>
<p>So the costs are mainly that we have to live</p>
<p>with more expensive energy,</p>
<p>you have to forego some opportunities,</p>
<p>you have to have more complicated services,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>The benefit is that you cut carbon emissions</p>
<p>and that eventually means that you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>less climate damage,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have lower temperature rises and so on.</p>
<p>If you try to weigh up all of those,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that the EU policies</p>
<p>will deliver for every dollar you spend,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll deliver less than a dollar,</p>
<p>probably about 30 cents back on the dollar,</p>
<p>which is a really bad way to spend dollars</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s lots of other things out in the world</p>
<p>where you could do multiple.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you think about tuberculosis</p>
<p>or education of small kids or nutrition for small kids</p>
<p>and those kinds of things,</p>
<p>every dollar you spend will do like 30 to $100 worth of good.</p>
<p>So there are much, much better places</p>
<p>where you could spend this money.</p>
<p>Likewise, the US is thinking of going net zero by 2050.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually gonna happen,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of a thing that everybody talks about,</p>
<p>Biden is talking a lot about it.</p>
<p>If you look at the models that indicate</p>
<p>how much will that cost,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not implausible that this will cost</p>
<p>somewhere between two and $4 trillion per year</p>
<p>by mid century.</p>
<p>And remember, if the US went carbon neutral today,</p>
<p>by the end of the century,</p>
<p>that would reduce temperatures</p>
<p>by about 0.3 degree Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>So you would just be able to measure it.</p>
<p>It probably wouldn&rsquo;t in real life,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d just be able to measure it.</p>
<p>Again, this is not saying</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not some good coming out of it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re basically spending an enormous amount of money</p>
<p>on fairly small benefits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my main point.</p>
<p>Yeah, this reminds me of what we were saying earlier</p>
<p>about the things that models don&rsquo;t integrate</p>
<p>and the things that cost benefit leave out</p>
<p>because you really can&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>One of the issues facing the world right now</p>
<p>is the reality that we&rsquo;re reminded of</p>
<p>that energy availability is a geopolitical destabilizer.</p>
<p>If you have uneven access to energy</p>
<p>and you have Vladimir Putin coming into office</p>
<p>or something else happening that disrupts that system,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re vastly increasing poverty.</p>
<p>This is playing out across the world.</p>
<p>Fertilizer prices, fertilizer comes from gas, natural gas.</p>
<p>If you can envision a world later in the century</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re no longer beholden on this material</p>
<p>in the ground, at least fossil fuels,</p>
<p>cobalt and lithium for batteries, that&rsquo;s pretty cool</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re taking away geopolitical instability.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s not factored in, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like way outside of what you&rsquo;d factor in.</p>
<p>But it does feel like to me,</p>
<p>if I was gonna make the case for,</p>
<p>you can choose your trillions,</p>
<p>whatever that investing big isn&rsquo;t for these marginal things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for looking at the big picture,</p>
<p>a world of abundant energy that doesn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>from a black rock or a gooey liquid</p>
<p>that when you burn it creates.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that what the proposals are?</p>
<p>Is investing in different kinds of energy,</p>
<p>renewable energy.</p>
<p>So what is-</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think most people are making that case.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in the trillion in the T costs?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s incorporated?</p>
<p>What are the big costs there?</p>
<p>So the big cost is that you have</p>
<p>slightly lower productivity gains.</p>
<p>So basically again, and this is sort of the opposite</p>
<p>of what we just talked about by climate change.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get richer and richer in the world.</p>
<p>This is all models, also the UN.</p>
<p>This is really the only way that you can get</p>
<p>big climate changes because everybody gets a lot richer.</p>
<p>So also the developing world gets a lot richer.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re likely to get richer.</p>
<p>But one of the things that drive wealth production</p>
<p>is the fact that we have ample</p>
<p>and cheap and available energy.</p>
<p>If you make that slightly harder,</p>
<p>which is what you do with climate legislation</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically telling people</p>
<p>you have to use a source of energy</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d rather not have used.</p>
<p>Because if people wanted to do it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d already have solved the problem.</p>
<p>So you basically tell them you gotta use this wind turbine</p>
<p>instead of this natural gas plant or that kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you suddenly become poor or anything.</p>
<p>It simply makes production slightly harder.</p>
<p>What do you do when the wind is not blowing kind of thing?</p>
<p>And of course we have lots of ways</p>
<p>to somewhat mitigate that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a little more costly, a little more complicated,</p>
<p>a little less convenient.</p>
<p>And that means you grow a little less.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main problem with these policies</p>
<p>that it simply makes you somewhat less well-off.</p>
<p>So energy becomes more inefficient.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So let me challenge you here.</p>
<p>Try to steel man some critics.</p>
<p>So you have critics.</p>
<p>I would love you to take it seriously</p>
<p>and sort of consider this criticism</p>
<p>and try to steel man their case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch.</p>
<p>I could mention this list of criticisms</p>
<p>from Bob Ward in London School of Economics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar with him.</p>
<p>But just on this point,</p>
<p>in terms of one of the big costs being an energy,</p>
<p>he criticizes your recent book in saying,</p>
<p>you consider the 143 billion in annual support</p>
<p>for renewable energy,</p>
<p>but ignore the 300 billion in fossil fuel subsidies.</p>
<p>So a lot of the criticism has to do with,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re cherry-picking the models,</p>
<p>which the models are always cherry-picking anyway.</p>
<p>But you wanna take those seriously.</p>
<p>So he claims that you ignore,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not fully modeling the costs,</p>
<p>the trade-off here,</p>
<p>how expensive is the renewable energy</p>
<p>and how expensive is the fossil fuel.</p>
<p>Can you steel man his case?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So two things.</p>
<p>The first, the quote,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely true that the world spends</p>
<p>a large chunk of money on fossil fuels,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just stupid,</p>
<p>and we should stop doing it.</p>
<p>We should also recognize that this is not rich countries.</p>
<p>This is not the countries</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re talking about climate change.</p>
<p>This is poor countries.</p>
<p>This is Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s actually not a terribly poor country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s China, it&rsquo;s Indonesia, it&rsquo;s Russia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s places where you&rsquo;re basically paying off</p>
<p>your population, just like that you subsidize bread,</p>
<p>you make sure that they don&rsquo;t rebel</p>
<p>by making cheap fuels available.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dumb, but it&rsquo;s not like they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mostly doing this for things</p>
<p>that have nothing to do with climate.</p>
<p>So I totally agree we should get rid of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s actually somewhat managed to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Because remember,</p>
<p>if you spend a lot of money on fossil fuel subsidies,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically subsidizing the rich</p>
<p>because poor people don&rsquo;t have a car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the rich people who can now buy very cheap gasoline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unjust as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s dumb in so many different ways.</p>
<p>I would never argue that you shouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve plenty of times said we should stop that.</p>
<p>But we should also recognize these are mostly regimes</p>
<p>that are not going to be taken over</p>
<p>either by my argument or Bob Ward&rsquo;s or anyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing this for totally different reasons.</p>
<p>Now, on the model side,</p>
<p>there is virtually no model that don&rsquo;t show,</p>
<p>economic model that don&rsquo;t show this has a cost.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the fundamental point is that the,</p>
<p>this is sort of a basic point from economics.</p>
<p>The system is already working most effectively</p>
<p>because if it wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you could actually make money changing over.</p>
<p>So if you want to have a change</p>
<p>outside of what the system is already doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re saying you have to do something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d rather not want to do,</p>
<p>namely use an energy source that is less convenient</p>
<p>or less cost effective and so on.</p>
<p>And that will incur a cost.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s huge discussion about just exactly</p>
<p>how much cost is that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely a cost.</p>
<p>Is the cost going to be one or 5 trillion?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely a discussion about</p>
<p>where do you take your models from?</p>
<p>I try to do, and again, this is not possible everywhere.</p>
<p>I try to actually take the average</p>
<p>of all of the economic models.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a group called</p>
<p>the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum,</p>
<p>which tries to pull together all these different groups</p>
<p>that do the modeling.</p>
<p>So some models, a lot of this cost actually comes down to</p>
<p>the fact that we don&rsquo;t quite know</p>
<p>how much more fossil fuels you&rsquo;re going to need</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>And so if your projections are</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to use that much,</p>
<p>the cost of reducing it is going to be very small.</p>
<p>If you think you&rsquo;re going to use a ton of extra fossil fuels</p>
<p>and you have to reduce that,</p>
<p>the cost is going to be bigger.</p>
<p>So I think-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one of the variables.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many, many, many more.</p>
<p>I think the point here is to say</p>
<p>that if you take the average of all the best models</p>
<p>sort of aggregated, for instance,</p>
<p>at the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pretty secure ground.</p>
<p>And so again, I would argue that Bob Ward,</p>
<p>yes, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of run-ins with Bob Ward</p>
<p>and he has a very different set of views on things,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>in saying that I&rsquo;m cherry picking.</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>And I mean, he also has similar criticism</p>
<p>about the estimate of the EU cost of climate action</p>
<p>based on the NOP 2013 model.</p>
<p>But ultimately these criticisms have to do is like,</p>
<p>what are the sources for the different models?</p>
<p>And just very briefly,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m laying it out very transparently</p>
<p>where I get these estimates from in the book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really tried to document this.</p>
<p>And yes, I mean, look,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nobody who sort of has all the information</p>
<p>and gets everything right in all of these areas.</p>
<p>I think most of Bob Ward&rsquo;s argument</p>
<p>is not a good faith effort</p>
<p>to sort of improve on these estimates.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right in saying some of these estimates,</p>
<p>we only have a few estimates.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;d like to have more of them.</p>
<p>One thing I should mention</p>
<p>is that there is very little interest in general</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s very little funding</p>
<p>in finding out how much do our climate policies cost?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s just inconvenient to everyone</p>
<p>in the whole game.</p>
<p>Who wants to know that, for instance,</p>
<p>would you want to fund something that says</p>
<p>that the Inflation Reduction Act</p>
<p>is not gonna be very effective?</p>
<p>Of course you don&rsquo;t want to do that, right?</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s a little bit the flock of birds</p>
<p>will look at something else.</p>
<p>And what I think is that given that we&rsquo;re paying for it,</p>
<p>and this is public money,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re deciding we&rsquo;re gonna spend money here</p>
<p>rather than there,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s at least look at what are the best estimates out there.</p>
<p>I would love to have more estimates.</p>
<p>More estimates is always better.</p>
<p>And just a quick comment on the good faith part.</p>
<p>Me as a consumer looking for truth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to find who&rsquo;s good faith and not.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not only are you looking</p>
<p>for sort of accurate information,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also trying to infer</p>
<p>about the communicator of that information.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>You put me on the podcast,</p>
<p>of course I&rsquo;m gonna say I&rsquo;m a trustworthy guy.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, and we believe we&rsquo;re trustworthy too,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been reading for various reasons,</p>
<p>but mostly because I&rsquo;ve been traveling to Ukraine</p>
<p>and thinking just about the people suffering through war.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about World War II</p>
<p>and Stalin and Hitler.</p>
<p>And from the perspective of Hitler,</p>
<p>he really believed he&rsquo;s doing good for the world.</p>
<p>And he was communicating from his perspective in good faith.</p>
<p>He started to believe, I think early on,</p>
<p>his own propaganda.</p>
<p>So even your understanding and perception</p>
<p>of the world completely shifted.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, very, very difficult</p>
<p>to understand who to trust.</p>
<p>And just because it&rsquo;s a consensus in a particular community</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it&rsquo;s a source of trust.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, I mean, basically,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to operate in this world,</p>
<p>except to have a humility</p>
<p>and constantly questioning your assumptions.</p>
<p>But not so much that you&rsquo;re completely out in the ocean,</p>
<p>not knowing what is true and not.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this weird, weird world,</p>
<p>because I ultimately, bigger than climate,</p>
<p>my hope is to have institutions that can be trusted.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been very much under attack</p>
<p>as part of the climate debate,</p>
<p>as part of the COVID debate,</p>
<p>as part of all of these discussions.</p>
<p>And science, to me, is one of the sources of truth.</p>
<p>And the fact that that&rsquo;s under question now</p>
<p>is something that hurts me on many levels, deeply.</p>
<p>You said something earlier,</p>
<p>I took a note down here,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t find it, about cooperation.</p>
<p>It was like collaborative cooperation</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>To me, there was a point, like in 2013,</p>
<p>after just dealing with all,</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve been grappling with,</p>
<p>what, if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you know you don&rsquo;t know how this is gonna work out,</p>
<p>what do you work on?</p>
<p>And one morning, I made a list of words</p>
<p>that kind of summarized, basically, system properties</p>
<p>that give you confidence in a system, trust or,</p>
<p>and there, transparency is one,</p>
<p>just as you were saying earlier.</p>
<p>Connectivity is another, so that everyone&rsquo;s connected.</p>
<p>So, on the subsidy issue, for example,</p>
<p>there are young entrepreneurs in Nairobi</p>
<p>who are selling, ingeniously,</p>
<p>using Nairobi&rsquo;s digital currency, propane,</p>
<p>the fuel that&rsquo;s in our backyard barbecue grills,</p>
<p>which comes out of gas wells, but it&rsquo;s a separate fuel,</p>
<p>in little increments that poor people</p>
<p>can use instead of charcoal.</p>
<p>And LPG subsidies are helping them</p>
<p>get people off of charcoal,</p>
<p>which is a horrific trade from the source</p>
<p>through the warlords in Somalia and elsewhere</p>
<p>who are getting the money to the pollution in houses.</p>
<p>So, having, being sure when we&rsquo;re having these big debates</p>
<p>about who the World Bank is gonna give loans to,</p>
<p>and drawing a simple line, no more fossil fuel subsidies,</p>
<p>hurts a really good, valuable,</p>
<p>small-scale, but scalable way to have people</p>
<p>not die from cooking smoke in their houses</p>
<p>and take down forests.</p>
<p>But that only is considered if they&rsquo;re in the conversation.</p>
<p>So, connectivity, full connectivity, digital access.</p>
<p>So, those entrepreneurs are in the mix of people.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re thinking about subsidies,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just thinking about Big Bad Exxon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about this little company in Nairobi,</p>
<p>Pago LPG, I think is the name, in India, the same thing.</p>
<p>So, you can list those properties of systems.</p>
<p>And the IPCC wasn&rsquo;t originally transparent</p>
<p>when I started writing about it in 1988 and 1990.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s way more transparent.</p>
<p>They have more public review.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s even better than it was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a really good example of a science process</p>
<p>of assessing the science,</p>
<p>providing periodic output to the world,</p>
<p>and iteratively improving the model going forward</p>
<p>because of critique, because of scrutiny,</p>
<p>and finding better ways for that to interface with people</p>
<p>so they have information they can use from that big thing.</p>
<p>And the media are not doing a good job</p>
<p>because of this front-page thotism.</p>
<p>But we can all, I work partially in academia, Columbia,</p>
<p>on an initiative partially in communication innovation.</p>
<p>Like, how can we have an open landscape</p>
<p>of access to information that matters?</p>
<p>What can you do to foster better conversations</p>
<p>so that words like collapse</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t just thrown around like emblems?</p>
<p>And so, system properties give you confidence, I think.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t have to be flailing around</p>
<p>for Bjorn or Tom Friedman or Catherine Hayhoe.</p>
<p>You can always, right now, find your character to follow.</p>
<p>But I think what would be better</p>
<p>is if you actually develop some skills</p>
<p>to just have a basic ability</p>
<p>to know how to cut to the chase.</p>
<p>Can I just follow up on that?</p>
<p>Because one of the things that I try to do,</p>
<p>and so my day job is actually something else I work with,</p>
<p>I think called the Copenhagen Consensus,</p>
<p>where we work with more than 300 of the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>top economists, and we work with</p>
<p>seven Nobel laureates in economics.</p>
<p>And the point there is really to talk about</p>
<p>where can you spend a dollar</p>
<p>and do the most good for the world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically the thing that we try to do.</p>
<p>And as you rightly point out,</p>
<p>look, there are lots of different estimates</p>
<p>of what can you do, for instance, on climate?</p>
<p>What can you do on tuberculosis?</p>
<p>What can you do for vulnerability</p>
<p>in all kinds of different ways?</p>
<p>And if these were all sort of,</p>
<p>well, you can spend a dollar here and do 2.36,</p>
<p>but you can spend a dollar here and do 2.34 over here,</p>
<p>I would worry a lot.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not how the world works,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re terribly inefficient.</p>
<p>So there are literally lots and lots</p>
<p>of amazing things you can do out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of not terribly great things</p>
<p>that you can do.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, one of the things</p>
<p>I try to sort of battle is that,</p>
<p>we get a lot of things right,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the world is a lot better</p>
<p>than what it used to be.</p>
<p>But the things that are sort of left over</p>
<p>are often the boring things</p>
<p>that happen to be incredibly effective</p>
<p>and the exciting things</p>
<p>that are often not that terribly effective.</p>
<p>And so I think one way to look at this</p>
<p>is basically to have people do cost-benefit</p>
<p>across a wide range of areas.</p>
<p>And we try to get a lot of different economists</p>
<p>to do this, and they come up with different numbers</p>
<p>and different models and different results.</p>
<p>But if you sort of consistently get</p>
<p>that some things give you in tens</p>
<p>or maybe even hundreds of dollars back per dollar,</p>
<p>remember, this is not actually you getting rich,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the world getting rich,</p>
<p>that the world gets better worth $100</p>
<p>for every dollar you spend.</p>
<p>And over here, you can spend a dollar</p>
<p>and do somewhere between 30 cents</p>
<p>and maybe a couple of dollars.</p>
<p>You should probably be focused</p>
<p>on the other opportunity first.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the point</p>
<p>that I try to make with climate.</p>
<p>There are some smart things we can do</p>
<p>and I hope we get to talk about them in climate.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a lot of sort of the standard approaches</p>
<p>to fixing climate,</p>
<p>turns out to be very likely below $1 back in dollar</p>
<p>and certainly not terribly high.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re very optimistic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be like two or three,</p>
<p>whereas many other things</p>
<p>are just fantastically better investment.</p>
<p>Like the thing I&rsquo;ve been advocating,</p>
<p>a modest proposal to eat the children</p>
<p>of the poor in England.</p>
<p>Was that in Jonathan Swift&rsquo;s modest proposal</p>
<p>from a few centuries ago?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just cost benefit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also in the context of what is moral</p>
<p>and all that, the full complexity of it.</p>
<p>You just hit on something really important.</p>
<p>Having been on this beat for so long,</p>
<p>and again, on the disaster beat as well, earthquakes.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many disaster science experts</p>
<p>keep telling me, like everyone says preparedness,</p>
<p>invest for preparedness.</p>
<p>A strict cost benefit analysis</p>
<p>will always tell you a dollar invested in resilience</p>
<p>before community gets hit by whatever is worth 10,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll always have to spend 10 after.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s fine to do the cost benefit stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the baseline.</p>
<p>Then you have to look at the social science,</p>
<p>which shows, or history,</p>
<p>which shows you how few times we do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we just don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Therefore, you can bang that drum.</p>
<p>Your work is valuable, but it&rsquo;s really constrained.</p>
<p>Because show me in the world where that does happen,</p>
<p>and then how you turn that success,</p>
<p>which is basically something not happening,</p>
<p>into the story.</p>
<p>Just very briefly, we try to,</p>
<p>so we do this for a lot of countries.</p>
<p>So we did it for Haiti, for instance,</p>
<p>funded by the Canadian Development Ministry,</p>
<p>because they were basically saying,</p>
<p>we spent a billion dollars in Haiti since the earthquake,</p>
<p>and we really can&rsquo;t tell the difference.</p>
<p>So they wanted to find,</p>
<p>I mean, they actually say that, right?</p>
<p>And so they said, we wanna find out</p>
<p>what are the really smart things you can do in Haiti.</p>
<p>And so we, together with lots of people in Haiti,</p>
<p>and all the business community,</p>
<p>and the political community, and the religious community,</p>
<p>and labor community, and everybody else,</p>
<p>what are the smart things to do?</p>
<p>And then we had economists evaluate it.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of these things that everybody wanted</p>
<p>that were not all that smart.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a lot of smart things.</p>
<p>And yes, the politicians didn&rsquo;t pick most of them.</p>
<p>So our sense is, we try to give people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about these 70 things,</p>
<p>you should actually just think about these 20 things.</p>
<p>And then we consider ourselves incredibly lucky</p>
<p>if they actually do one of them.</p>
<p>So you wrote the book,</p>
<p>How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.</p>
<p>So can we just list some of the things?</p>
<p>If you got $75 billion, how do you spend them?</p>
<p>All right, so there&rsquo;s some incredibly good</p>
<p>and very, very well-documented things</p>
<p>that you could spend money on.</p>
<p>So we have two big infectious diseases</p>
<p>that almost nobody think about,</p>
<p>because we only think about COVID.</p>
<p>But tuberculosis used to be</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s biggest infectious disease killer.</p>
<p>It still kills about 1.5 million people every year.</p>
<p>The reason why we don&rsquo;t really worry about it</p>
<p>is because we fixed it 100 years ago.</p>
<p>We know how to fix it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just basically getting medication to people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about getting them to take it</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re sort of been cured,</p>
<p>because you need to take it for four to six months,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually hard to do.</p>
<p>So you also need to incentivize that in some kind of way.</p>
<p>It turns out it&rsquo;s incredibly cheap</p>
<p>to basically save almost all of the 1.5 million people.</p>
<p>These are people that die in the prime of their lives.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re typically parents,</p>
<p>so it would also have a lot of knock-on effects.</p>
<p>And basically, we find for a couple billion dollars,</p>
<p>you could save the vast number of these.</p>
<p>Not all of them, but you could save the vast number of them.</p>
<p>It would also improve outcomes in all kinds of other ways.</p>
<p>Likewise with malaria.</p>
<p>It has somewhat better PR.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to think of malaria as PR and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>They need to improve their PR department.</p>
<p>Well, but yeah.</p>
<p>Those mosquitoes are the good PR.</p>
<p>By far the biggest infectious disease</p>
<p>that got good PR, if you will, was HIV, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not trying to compare it and say,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s worse or better to have HIV</p>
<p>than tuberculosis or anything,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m simply saying we are underfunding</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t really get the public attention.</p>
<p>We just, yeah, we don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>But spending money on that has,</p>
<p>in terms of benefit, a much bigger impact.</p>
<p>So every dollar you spend on TB</p>
<p>will probably do about $43 worth of good.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll do an amazing amount of good,</p>
<p>basically because it&rsquo;ll save lives,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll make sure parents stay with their kids</p>
<p>and be more productive in their communities,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll have a lot of knock-on effects.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s incredibly cheap to do.</p>
<p>Same thing with malaria.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly mosquito nets that we need to get out.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying, just to contrast with climate change,</p>
<p>the dollar you spend on, no, not climate change,</p>
<p>but decreasing emissions does not have,</p>
<p>does not come close to the $43 benefit?</p>
<p>No, nobody would ever argue that.</p>
<p>So very, very enthusiastic climate advocates</p>
<p>would probably say it&rsquo;ll do $2 or $3 worth of good</p>
<p>for every dollar.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s still worthwhile to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they would say.</p>
<p>I would argue, and I think a lot of the evidence</p>
<p>seems to side that way,</p>
<p>that a lot of the things that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>deliver actually less than a dollar back.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s certainly not nearly the same kind of place.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s many, many other things.</p>
<p>And, you know, just, if you&rsquo;ll allow me.</p>
<p>Yes, please, I love this.</p>
<p>But yeah, there are lots of other things,</p>
<p>for instance, e-procurement.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s incredibly boring.</p>
<p>So most developing countries,</p>
<p>well, actually most governments,</p>
<p>spend most of their money on procurement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s typically incredibly corrupt.</p>
<p>So we did this project for Bangladesh, where-</p>
<p>Can you explain procurement?</p>
<p>Yes, so that&rsquo;s governments buying stuff.</p>
<p>So a large part of the government revenue</p>
<p>is spent on buying anything from, you know,</p>
<p>post-it notes to roads.</p>
<p>And obviously, you know, roads are much,</p>
<p>much more expensive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly infrastructure stuff.</p>
<p>Hugely corrupt.</p>
<p>For instance, in Bangladesh,</p>
<p>it would already have been decided</p>
<p>among the ruling elite in that local area,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to get this.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll have this bidding competition</p>
<p>where you have to hand in an envelope,</p>
<p>a sealed envelope with your bid on it.</p>
<p>But you put a goon outside the office.</p>
<p>So you literally physically can&rsquo;t get in</p>
<p>with your bid.</p>
<p>Now, what we found, and this is, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not claiming any sort of ownership to this.</p>
<p>A lot of smart people have done this way before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just simply proving that it&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you put this on eBay, essentially,</p>
<p>so if you do an e-procurement system</p>
<p>where bidders can come in,</p>
<p>suddenly it becomes harder to put up the goon.</p>
<p>You can still do it, but it&rsquo;s harder to do it.</p>
<p>It also means you get bids from all over Bangladesh.</p>
<p>And in general, you&rsquo;ll get bids from all over.</p>
<p>Actually, it turns out you get better quality.</p>
<p>But most important is you get it much cheaper.</p>
<p>So basically you can simply save money.</p>
<p>So we did a scaled experiment in Bangladesh</p>
<p>where we had about 4% go to be e-procurement</p>
<p>and you could compare what it would have cost</p>
<p>and then what it did cost.</p>
<p>And the average reduction was, as I remember, it&rsquo;s 7%.</p>
<p>And the finance minister loved it, you know,</p>
<p>because that basically gives him a lot more money</p>
<p>or, you know, you can buy more stuff at the same cost.</p>
<p>No, it is corruption.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically you get rid of some corruption.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll still be corruption, but less corruption.</p>
<p>Ukraine has actually been big on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve talked to them.</p>
<p>I talked to the digital transformation minister.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, this is before the war, but still working.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the entirety of the government is in an app.</p>
<p>And that one of the big effects</p>
<p>is the reduction of corruption.</p>
<p>And not like from a, as politicians say,</p>
<p>to say we&rsquo;ve reduced,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve taken these actions through this.</p>
<p>No, literally it&rsquo;s just much more difficult to be corrupt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The incentives aren&rsquo;t quite there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s friction for corruption.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So basically you can spend a little bit of money</p>
<p>and you can make a huge benefit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still about 70 countries</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t gone e-procurement.</p>
<p>So obviously they should do that.</p>
<p>Food for small kids, another thing.</p>
<p>So, you know, basically, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s morally wrong that people are starving,</p>
<p>but it also turns out</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a really, really dumb thing</p>
<p>not to get kids good food.</p>
<p>Because if you get them good food,</p>
<p>their brains develop more</p>
<p>so that when they get into school, they learn more.</p>
<p>And so when they come out in adult lives,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re much more productive.</p>
<p>So we can actually make every kid in,</p>
<p>especially in developing countries,</p>
<p>much more productive by making sure they get good food.</p>
<p>So getting good food is not cost-free.</p>
<p>So it probably costs about $100,</p>
<p>both in, you need some directed advertisement,</p>
<p>you need to make sure</p>
<p>that you actually get some of the food out there,</p>
<p>that you help the families,</p>
<p>and you also make sure you don&rsquo;t just give it to everyone</p>
<p>because then it becomes a lot more expensive.</p>
<p>If you do that right, it costs about $100 per kid, but.</p>
<p>Per kid, or what do you do?</p>
<p>For two years, so it&rsquo;s for their first two years of life.</p>
<p>And if you do that, you then get a benefit</p>
<p>in that they become smarter and go longer to school</p>
<p>and they actually learn more</p>
<p>and become more productive of $4,500.</p>
<p>Remember, this is far out into the future.</p>
<p>So this is discounted, the benefit is actually much higher.</p>
<p>And this is one of the things</p>
<p>that we also have a conversation about in climate change</p>
<p>because all, and when you talk about climate change,</p>
<p>cost and benefits, all the costs are now</p>
<p>and all the benefits are in the future,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like that in education.</p>
<p>You know, all the costs are now,</p>
<p>all the benefits are far out into the future.</p>
<p>And if you try to do that right,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a whole other conversation we could have,</p>
<p>then it turns out that for every dollar spent,</p>
<p>you do $45 worth of good.</p>
<p>Again, remember about a third of all kids</p>
<p>that go to school right now</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t learn pretty much anything.</p>
<p>And if we could make them more productive</p>
<p>in the school system, we have another proposal</p>
<p>on how to do that in the school system.</p>
<p>But you know, by just simply making sure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re smarter when they get into school.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been focusing so much</p>
<p>on making the education system better,</p>
<p>which is really hard,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually really easy to make the kids smarter.</p>
<p>Then when you say the education system is not working well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re talking about not the American education</p>
<p>system, we&rsquo;re talking about globally.</p>
<p>Yes, we&rsquo;re talking about globally.</p>
<p>You know, so about a third of the teachers</p>
<p>in developing countries have a hard time passing the tests</p>
<p>of the things they have to teach their students, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, all these students have lots of other issues.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s, they need to do farm work.</p>
<p>They need, yeah, they&rsquo;re constantly considering,</p>
<p>should I just go out and start working instead?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s constant disruption.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of teachers that don&rsquo;t show up in India.</p>
<p>You know, you have this absurd situation</p>
<p>where all the teachers are basically paid</p>
<p>and hired for eternity for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>And so not surprisingly, a lot of them decide not to show up.</p>
<p>So now they&rsquo;ve hired assistant teachers</p>
<p>that basically have taken over.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re paying for, I think it&rsquo;s 7 million teachers</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re all not working,</p>
<p>but a lot of them are not working as much as they should.</p>
<p>And we now hired another 7 million teachers</p>
<p>that will eventually stop working as well.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working much better right now</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not on permanent contracts,</p>
<p>but eventually they&rsquo;ll get on permanent contracts</p>
<p>and then you have the same problem again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of these issues.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s just simply about saying</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t fix all problems,</p>
<p>but there are some problems</p>
<p>that are incredibly easy to solve.</p>
<p>And there are some that are incredibly hard to solve.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we start with solving the easy and effective ones?</p>
<p>And this of course bears on that whole conversation</p>
<p>on climate change, because in some ways,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s also Andy&rsquo;s point of saying,</p>
<p>look, if you want to save people</p>
<p>from the impacts of hurricanes,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s fix this simple, easy things</p>
<p>about vulnerability first.</p>
<p>Whereas we have somehow latched onto this,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s fix the hardest thing to do,</p>
<p>which is to get everyone to stop using fossil fuels,</p>
<p>which is basically what&rsquo;s driven</p>
<p>the last 200 years of development.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be, that&rsquo;s a tall order,</p>
<p>no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some really cool elements</p>
<p>that you guys just brought up.</p>
<p>When you mentioned that word moral before,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t, I latched onto it because it relates</p>
<p>to these timescales that really are immeasurable.</p>
<p>If you know it&rsquo;s going to take decades</p>
<p>to confirm the benefit of some investment now,</p>
<p>that implies you&rsquo;re doing the investment</p>
<p>with some moral imperative,</p>
<p>not because you can do a spreadsheet</p>
<p>and come up with a number.</p>
<p>And that process, letting go of the need</p>
<p>for kind of a mechanistic cost-benefit approach,</p>
<p>thinking about kids&rsquo; education in poor countries,</p>
<p>or several things we talked about,</p>
<p>seems to be really important,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very hard for all of us to do.</p>
<p>Philanthropists suck at it.</p>
<p>I worked at National Geographic Society for a year</p>
<p>building some new programs</p>
<p>when they got a big infusion of money.</p>
<p>They have a whole department that&rsquo;s called M&amp;E.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s measurement and evaluation,</p>
<p>which is if you don&rsquo;t prove it, it goes away.</p>
<p>I mentioned Spotify earlier,</p>
<p>Spotify killing a climate podcast</p>
<p>because that podcast didn&rsquo;t measure out</p>
<p>for their impact, you know, what they want to do.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re always making the judgments</p>
<p>based on strict cost-benefit,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna miss larger realities.</p>
<p>Another thing is, a really exciting example</p>
<p>of what you were talking about</p>
<p>in terms of in Ukraine with the trust</p>
<p>and less corruption and stuff was in India.</p>
<p>For all of his issues, Modi recognized</p>
<p>that middle-class people in India cook on LPG, propane,</p>
<p>or on piped gas, natural gas if they&rsquo;re in cities.</p>
<p>Much cleaner, much healthier in so many ways.</p>
<p>And actually, compared to chopping down trees</p>
<p>and cooking on wood, it&rsquo;s actually better for the climate</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s a fossil fuel.</p>
<p>So he and others, there was an American scientist,</p>
<p>Kirk Smith, who worked this all out.</p>
<p>If you find a way, they were getting a subsidy.</p>
<p>They had that energy subsidy.</p>
<p>You were talking about many poor countries</p>
<p>subsidize energy just to stay in office, you know,</p>
<p>to make something cheap that everyone wants.</p>
<p>But they wanted to shift the subsidy</p>
<p>away from the middle class to the poor people</p>
<p>who are cooking on firewood and dying young from pneumonia.</p>
<p>And the critical factor was India&rsquo;s digital currency.</p>
<p>India went to a digital economy.</p>
<p>Very poor families there now, if you have a phone,</p>
<p>you basically, that&rsquo;s your bank.</p>
<p>And you could make the case to the public</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna be starting to shift your LPG,</p>
<p>your propane subsidy to poor people.</p>
<p>But we know they&rsquo;re poor.</p>
<p>We know they&rsquo;re not just gonna be using it</p>
<p>behind their restaurant, which was, you know,</p>
<p>when it was a general subsidy, people were hoarding the LPG.</p>
<p>And the system has worked.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve shifted a lot of capacity to cook</p>
<p>on a clean blue flame that turns off and on</p>
<p>in homes that previously, where the woman</p>
<p>would spend hours collecting firewood,</p>
<p>smoky fire, cooking, clean the pots,</p>
<p>and start all over again.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all built on trust, built on the digital economy,</p>
<p>and the same thing in Nairobi.</p>
<p>So that excites me every day, you know,</p>
<p>with all the doomism.</p>
<p>I just hope people can literally take a breath,</p>
<p>look for these examples that show the potential</p>
<p>when you have a trustworthy system,</p>
<p>when you have a clear path to making lives better,</p>
<p>and then knowing, you know, that kid having electric light</p>
<p>as opposed to a kerosene lamp.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how much that&rsquo;s gonna improve his homework</p>
<p>and lead to a better outcome.</p>
<p>But we know from history that sometimes it does.</p>
<p>Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary General.</p>
<p>So the most powerful story I ever heard</p>
<p>from a UN Secretary General was like 2012</p>
<p>when they were rolling out this Sustainable Energy</p>
<p>for All initiative, which is not just climate.</p>
<p>It was just like getting people energy</p>
<p>they need to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>He was growing up in post-war Korea.</p>
<p>Everyone was poor.</p>
<p>Everything was broken, destroyed.</p>
<p>Sadly, like so much of many parts of Ukraine.</p>
<p>And he would do his homework by kerosene lamp.</p>
<p>He said when he was studying for his finals,</p>
<p>his mom would give him a candle.</p>
<p>This was a brighter flame, you know, better grades maybe.</p>
<p>And he became Secretary General.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hell of a story.</p>
<p>So which, for climate change,</p>
<p>which policies work, which don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Which are, when we look at this formula of $1 in, $45 out,</p>
<p>for climate change, what dollar in,</p>
<p>what policies for dollar in and dollar out are good</p>
<p>and which are not?</p>
<p>So we actually did a whole project back in 2009</p>
<p>when the whole world circus was coming to Copenhagen</p>
<p>and we were gonna save the world there.</p>
<p>We brought together about 50 climate economists</p>
<p>and three Nobel laureates to look at</p>
<p>where can you spend a dollar</p>
<p>and do the most good for climate?</p>
<p>And what they found was a lot of these things</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve been talking about before,</p>
<p>that basically investing in the current sort of technology</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying very hard</p>
<p>is at best a pretty dicey outcome.</p>
<p>Much of it&rsquo;s probably less than a dollar back in the dollar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some investments on adaptation, for instance,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty good,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you know, sort of two, $3 back in the dollar.</p>
<p>Oh, what is adaptation?</p>
<p>The obvious thing is that you build a dike</p>
<p>for a sea level rise or that you make people,</p>
<p>you get some apps that people know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a hurricane coming or that, you know,</p>
<p>so you can adapt to-</p>
<p>Adapting infrastructure, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The physical and the digital infrastructure.</p>
<p>The point is that people are really good</p>
<p>at doing this already</p>
<p>because they have a strong incentive to do it.</p>
<p>So the extra thing that governments can do outside</p>
<p>is somewhat good, but it&rsquo;s not amazing or anything.</p>
<p>What we found by far the best investment in the long run</p>
<p>was on investment in energy innovation.</p>
<p>So, and I think this also sort of corresponds</p>
<p>with what we would think in general.</p>
<p>If we could innovate, so, you know, for instance,</p>
<p>Bill Gates is arguing</p>
<p>we should have fourth generation nuclear.</p>
<p>So the next, more advanced than what we currently have</p>
<p>in third generation nuclear,</p>
<p>which would be a industrial scale process.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d just be building these, you know,</p>
<p>modular nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>They would be, instead of being these artwork</p>
<p>that we design once for every different plant,</p>
<p>which is one of the reasons why they&rsquo;re so expensive,</p>
<p>they would just be mass produced and you&rsquo;d have one,</p>
<p>you know, they all be recognized in one go.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be much cheaper.</p>
<p>They would also be passively safe.</p>
<p>So if all the power goes,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll shut down rather than go boom.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another very good thing.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll also be very hard to transform</p>
<p>into nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>So you can actually imagine them being out</p>
<p>in a lot of different places</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;d perhaps be a little worried</p>
<p>about having, you know, plutonium lying around.</p>
<p>Now, this is all still being worked out,</p>
<p>but imagine if that actually comes out.</p>
<p>And again, remember the other three generations,</p>
<p>we were also told that it&rsquo;ll be incredibly safe</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be incredibly cheap.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t turn out that way.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s wait, but it could be.</p>
<p>And so the argument is invest in these ideas,</p>
<p>for instance, fourth generation nuclear.</p>
<p>And if fourth generation nuclear becomes cheaper</p>
<p>than fossil fuels, we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Everyone will just switch,</p>
<p>not just rich, well-meaning Americans or Europeans,</p>
<p>but also the Chinese, the Indians, everybody in Africa,</p>
<p>the rest is Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you fix these issues, right?</p>
<p>So the idea here is to say,</p>
<p>instead of thinking that we can sort of push people</p>
<p>to do stuff they really don&rsquo;t want to do,</p>
<p>which is basically saying, let&rsquo;s use more</p>
<p>of the, you know, the solar and wind</p>
<p>that you would otherwise have invested in,</p>
<p>force people to buy an electric car</p>
<p>by giving huge subsidies,</p>
<p>because otherwise they&rsquo;re clearly not all that interested</p>
<p>in buying it and so on,</p>
<p>then get the innovation such that they become cheaper</p>
<p>than fossil fuels and everyone will switch.</p>
<p>This is how we&rsquo;ve solved problems in the past,</p>
<p>if you think, in Los Angeles in the 1950s</p>
<p>was hugely polluted place, mostly because of cars.</p>
<p>The sort of standard climate approach today</p>
<p>would be to tell everyone in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, could you just walk instead?</p>
<p>And of course that just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t pay off.</p>
<p>You never get, you know, politician voted in office</p>
<p>or at least staying in office</p>
<p>if you make that kind of policy.</p>
<p>What did solve the problem was the innovation</p>
<p>of the catalytic converter.</p>
<p>You basically get those little gizmo</p>
<p>and it cost a couple of hundred dollars</p>
<p>and you put it on your tailpipe</p>
<p>and then you can drive around basically almost not pollute.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you fix the air pollution in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Basically, we&rsquo;ve solved all problems in humanity,</p>
<p>all big, difficult problems with innovation.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t solved it by telling everyone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, could you be a little less comfortable</p>
<p>and a little more cold and a little poor</p>
<p>and believing that that can go on for decades.</p>
<p>And while it possibly works in some pockets of the US</p>
<p>and I think actually in large parts of Europe,</p>
<p>at least it used to, the war in Ukraine</p>
<p>is definitely sort of changing that whole perspective.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s a willingness to say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna, you know, suffer a little</p>
<p>but then we&rsquo;ll fix this problem.</p>
<p>But the point is we&rsquo;re gonna be willing to suffer a little</p>
<p>and so fix a tiny bit of the climate problem</p>
<p>instead of actually focusing on innovation.</p>
<p>So what we found was if you spend a dollar on innovation,</p>
<p>you will probably avoid about $11 of climate damage</p>
<p>in the long run, which is a great investment.</p>
<p>And the terrible thing is we have not been doing this.</p>
<p>So because everybody&rsquo;s focused on saying,</p>
<p>we need the solution within the next 12 years,</p>
<p>it means you&rsquo;re not thinking about the innovation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re actually spending less money,</p>
<p>not more money on innovation globally.</p>
<p>So everyone&rsquo;s focusing on reducing carbon emission</p>
<p>versus innovating on alternate energy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically focusing on putting</p>
<p>the existing solar panels or wind turbines,</p>
<p>which are either just about inefficient or inefficient,</p>
<p>instead of making the next generation</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s more likely the 10th generation after that,</p>
<p>that comes with lots of battery backup power</p>
<p>or fourth generation nuclear,</p>
<p>or Craig Venter has this great idea.</p>
<p>Craig Venter, the guy who cracked</p>
<p>the human genome back in 2000,</p>
<p>he has this idea of growing algae out on the ocean surface.</p>
<p>These algae, they&rsquo;d be genetically modified</p>
<p>and they would basically soak up sunlight</p>
<p>and CO2 and produce oil.</p>
<p>Then we could basically just grow our own Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>out on the ocean surface and we&rsquo;d harvest it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d keep our entire fossil fuel economy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;d not be net zero</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;d just soaked up the CO2 out there.</p>
<p>One dollar invested in the portfolio of different ideas.</p>
<p>Gives $11 back.</p>
<p>I first wrote about that in the New York Times.</p>
<p>It was one of my actual page one stories.</p>
<p>In 2006, it was declining R&amp;D in energy</p>
<p>at a time of global warming.</p>
<p>The baseline is so low for this that it&rsquo;s a super bargain.</p>
<p>There was, during the energy crisis,</p>
<p>the first energy crisis in the 70s before the current one,</p>
<p>our annual spending in the United States</p>
<p>and constant dollars on R&amp;D,</p>
<p>research and development for energy,</p>
<p>was about $5 billion.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s just dribbled away since then.</p>
<p>Recently now, there&rsquo;s a big burst of new money</p>
<p>coming through these new bills that got passed.</p>
<p>But what I was told over and over again</p>
<p>by people in that arena</p>
<p>is you can&rsquo;t just have these little bubbles of investment.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get young people</p>
<p>away from thinking about Wall Street for jobs</p>
<p>towards thinking about energy innovation</p>
<p>if there isn&rsquo;t a future there.</p>
<p>In the United States and Europe,</p>
<p>the presumption was the way to that future</p>
<p>was taxing carbon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d make that so punitive</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re basically evening the landscape</p>
<p>for cleaner stuff that&rsquo;s more expensive.</p>
<p>That has failed completely.</p>
<p>There are little examples in Europe where it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s happened now is,</p>
<p>well, the United States, this big chunk of money,</p>
<p>is designed to take us over a finish line</p>
<p>that was started with not just innovation,</p>
<p>but with the production efficiency too.</p>
<p>This is one thing I got wrong, I think,</p>
<p>a little bit in my reporting.</p>
<p>I was so fixated on the innovation part,</p>
<p>just because I love science too.</p>
<p>I saw this untapped possibility</p>
<p>that others were saying, no, no, production efficiency,</p>
<p>the more people are producing batteries,</p>
<p>the cheaper they&rsquo;ll get.</p>
<p>This is Elon Musk&rsquo;s path and many others.</p>
<p>And it really is both.</p>
<p>So when you were talking about purchasing power</p>
<p>for governments, for example,</p>
<p>that can stimulate production capacity for batteries</p>
<p>or whatever the good thing is and take you down faster.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all about getting that margin</p>
<p>of the new thing out competing the old.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just innovation.</p>
<p>It has so many parts of the pipeline</p>
<p>that need to be nurtured.</p>
<p>So, and the other thing is relative cost.</p>
<p>The United States, when I was writing about this in 2006,</p>
<p>our budget for DARPA,</p>
<p>the Advanced Research Project Agency</p>
<p>for the Defense Department,</p>
<p>just for science, was 80 billion a year,</p>
<p>for health, for medical frontier research</p>
<p>on cancer and stuff, 40 billion.</p>
<p>Energy was two or three.</p>
<p>So we weren&rsquo;t taking this remotely seriously.</p>
<p>So now if we get that up,</p>
<p>to me there&rsquo;s like this level,</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re taking something seriously</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s like in the tens of billions for R&amp;D.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that R&amp;D will solve the problem,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a proxy for what we really care about.</p>
<p>We care a shitload about defense.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the defense budget in the United States now?</p>
<p>Like 800 billion?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some insane number.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s counting when you&rsquo;re having fun?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so innovation is not just like for the better,</p>
<p>you know, camera, the better solar panel,</p>
<p>the better battery.</p>
<p>Social innovation actually matters hugely.</p>
<p>Like the guy in Nairobi I mentioned</p>
<p>with a company doing micropayment gas</p>
<p>to get people off charcoal.</p>
<p>We need that as much as this.</p>
<p>And I actually, I interviewed Bill Gates.</p>
<p>We had to spend an hour with him in Seattle in 2016</p>
<p>when he was rolling out his breakthrough energy thing.</p>
<p>I got to spend, it was 45 minutes,</p>
<p>me and Bill Gates, which was pretty fun.</p>
<p>But I brought this up.</p>
<p>I said, you know, because he&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>the new nuclear thing that will solve the world&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>And I, yes, yes, yes, but we also.</p>
<p>Oh, he brought up nuclear?</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Oh, he did, oh sure, yeah.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s interested in one of the.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s investing heavily in nuclear,</p>
<p>but he invests in everything.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s got a big portfolio.</p>
<p>But I brought up a guy I met in India</p>
<p>who runs a little outfit called Selco</p>
<p>that they do really interesting, cool village to village.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like an energy analyst</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ll come to your house here in the States</p>
<p>and tell you how to weatherize your house,</p>
<p>but they do it at the village scale.</p>
<p>And in a village that has, where they&rsquo;re milling wheat,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll put in a solar-powered wheat mill.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s not gonna solve the world&rsquo;s problems,</p>
<p>but it gives them a way to control their energy.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to buy something to grind their wheat.</p>
<p>And that needs just as much attention</p>
<p>as the things I really like too, the cool technologies.</p>
<p>And I thought I cornered Bill Gates.</p>
<p>I was like,</p>
<p>because he really does focus on these big wins,</p>
<p>the big, you know, like nuclear,</p>
<p>that will make net zero completely doable.</p>
<p>And I said, well, you know, what about nuclear?</p>
<p>Like New York City, where I was still living at the time,</p>
<p>and I said, it&rsquo;s got a million buildings.</p>
<p>New York City has one million buildings.</p>
<p>And in 2013, the Bloomberg government analyzed,</p>
<p>they said, looking ahead to 2050,</p>
<p>75% of the buildings in New York City</p>
<p>that will exist in 2050 already exist.</p>
<p>Think about these brave new futures, right?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re just gonna like come in,</p>
<p>have these shiny, cool passive house cities.</p>
<p>And so I put this to Bill and I said,</p>
<p>so how do you do that?</p>
<p>How do you retrofit all those boilers,</p>
<p>many of which were coal-fired like 20 years ago,</p>
<p>to get a zero energy New York City?</p>
<p>And I kind of thought I had him.</p>
<p>And then he immediately, he kind of sat back and went,</p>
<p>well, but if you have unlimited clean power</p>
<p>coming into that city, that doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good Bill Gates impression.</p>
<p>It was a good answer.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a good answer.</p>
<p>He said, oh yeah, it&rsquo;s a leaky bucket,</p>
<p>but you know, pour in zero carbon energy,</p>
<p>then it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But I still think we have to figure out</p>
<p>the other part too, that end,</p>
<p>how do you innovate at the household level,</p>
<p>at the village level?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more of a distributed problem, we used to think.</p>
<p>The one big change I&rsquo;ve had in my own thinking too</p>
<p>is from top down to distributed.</p>
<p>Everything about the climate problem</p>
<p>through the first three decades of my reporting</p>
<p>was that the IPCC will come out a new report,</p>
<p>the framework convention, the treaty will get us on board,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll all behave better.</p>
<p>It has this like top down, you know,</p>
<p>parent to child architecture.</p>
<p>And everything I&rsquo;ve learned has gone the other way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s distributed capacity for improved lives.</p>
<p>You know, kids getting through school,</p>
<p>women not having to spend three hours collecting firewood.</p>
<p>And if it means propane for that household</p>
<p>in that context, that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>So stop with all your yammering</p>
<p>about ending all fossil fuel subsidies.</p>
<p>And you know, what&rsquo;s an America look like</p>
<p>that has some climate safe energy future?</p>
<p>Find your part in that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get disempowered by the scale of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a thousand things to do</p>
<p>when you start to cut it into pieces.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very different, it&rsquo;s not a top down thing.</p>
<p>You know, no one&rsquo;s gonna magically come in and.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I think,</p>
<p>so I agree that everyone should try to play their part</p>
<p>and do, you know, whatever they can.</p>
<p>But I also think, you know, just the sheer incentives,</p>
<p>you know, what we saw happening with shale gas</p>
<p>is a great example.</p>
<p>When shale gas becomes so cheap</p>
<p>that you just stop using coal,</p>
<p>that then you don&rsquo;t really have to convince,</p>
<p>you know, lots and lots of people,</p>
<p>you know, coal is really bad.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t label a climate.</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t a climate thing, it was an energy thing.</p>
<p>It was totally, and the point is just, you know,</p>
<p>the power of an innovation</p>
<p>is that you almost don&rsquo;t see it anymore.</p>
<p>It just happens.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really the only way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna fix, you know, these big problems.</p>
<p>If you think about, you know,</p>
<p>the nutrition problem back in the 60s, 70s,</p>
<p>you know, we worried a lot about India and other places.</p>
<p>A solution is not worrying,</p>
<p>or the solution was not, you know,</p>
<p>us eating a little bit less</p>
<p>and sending it down to India or wherever.</p>
<p>The solution was the green revolution, right?</p>
<p>It was the fact that some scientists made</p>
<p>ways to make every seed produce three times as much.</p>
<p>So you could grow three times as much food on an acre.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s what basically made it possible</p>
<p>for India to go from a basket case</p>
<p>to the world&rsquo;s leading rice exporter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you do these things.</p>
<p>You know, you solve these big problems through innovation.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not saying that, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually arguing our carbon tax</p>
<p>is a smart thing to do.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s what any economist would tell you to do.</p>
<p>But it also turns out that it&rsquo;s partly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna solve most of the problem,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s incredibly politically hard to do.</p>
<p>So it may also just be the wrong sort of tree to bark up.</p>
<p>Again, if you can do it, please do.</p>
<p>But this is not the main thing that&rsquo;s gonna solve climate.</p>
<p>The main thing is that we get these innovations</p>
<p>that basically make green energy so cheap</p>
<p>everyone will just want.</p>
<p>We mentioned nuclear quite a few times.</p>
<p>You know, there was a, for a long time,</p>
<p>it seems to have shifted recently.</p>
<p>Maybe you can clarify and educate me on this.</p>
<p>But for the longest time, people thought that nuclear</p>
<p>is almost unclean energy, or dangerous energy,</p>
<p>or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>When did that shift?</p>
<p>What was the source of that alarmism?</p>
<p>And maybe is that a case study of how alarmism</p>
<p>can turn into a productive, constructive policy?</p>
<p>Oh, productive from whose standpoint?</p>
<p>I live-</p>
<p>Is it not, is it not?</p>
<p>Like nuclear-</p>
<p>Well, no, I was trying to,</p>
<p>do you mean productive in terms of yay, we banned it,</p>
<p>or productive for those who want-</p>
<p>Oh, I see, I see what you mean, yes.</p>
<p>I meant productive for human civilization.</p>
<p>No, the alarmism over nuclear power</p>
<p>dominated any alarmism over global warming.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>This in the United States, Three Mile Island,</p>
<p>then you had Chernobyl there.</p>
<p>And the traditional environmental movement</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t, still won&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>They still, the big groups, NRDC, EDF,</p>
<p>that whole alphabet soup of the big greens,</p>
<p>are reluctant to put forward the nuclear option</p>
<p>because they know a lot of their aging donors</p>
<p>basically grew up in the thinking about nuclear</p>
<p>as the problem, not the solution.</p>
<p>I lived for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>I moved to Maine recently,</p>
<p>but I lived in the Hudson Valley,</p>
<p>10 miles from the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant,</p>
<p>which was built in the 60s, 70s, and had some problems.</p>
<p>None of them were to the point of a meltdown</p>
<p>or the threat of it,</p>
<p>even the theoretical possibility of one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in, I was in it twice as a reporter,</p>
<p>looking down in the cooling pool.</p>
<p>I can send you a fun video of bubbles</p>
<p>in the cooling pool with the rods.</p>
<p>And progressively they demonstrated</p>
<p>how to handle waste in the United States.</p>
<p>Now the waste is, because we haven&rsquo;t figured out</p>
<p>how to move it across state lines,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s glassified, it&rsquo;s put into kind of containers</p>
<p>that sit there at the plant.</p>
<p>We just simply don&rsquo;t have a long-term solution.</p>
<p>The Nevada politicians were successful</p>
<p>in saying, not here, not Yucca Mountain.</p>
<p>But my wife, who I&rsquo;ve been married to,</p>
<p>well, I met 30 years ago, and she lives with me.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an environmental educator.</p>
<p>She was very happy when Cuomo shut it down,</p>
<p>said we&rsquo;re gonna shut it down three or four years ago,</p>
<p>which just happened a year, it actually is shut down now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being mothballed.</p>
<p>And I was like, that sucks.</p>
<p>We need-</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we still love each other.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s an environmentalist,</p>
<p>so that just speaks to a lot of environmentalists</p>
<p>who still see nuclear as bad.</p>
<p>Oh, totally, oh yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and you bring in the weapons proliferation issues.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a safety thing, it&rsquo;s a generational thing.</p>
<p>I think young people are different, I hope.</p>
<p>These small modular reactor designs,</p>
<p>several of which, there&rsquo;s a couple of PhDs from MIT</p>
<p>who did transatomic power.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both in their early 30s.</p>
<p>We need so much more of them.</p>
<p>And just briefly, the one thing I say about nuclear</p>
<p>is like with so many of these things, like subsidies,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk to me about yes, no nuclear.</p>
<p>Talk to me about what do you want to do</p>
<p>with existing nuclear power plants?</p>
<p>And what do you want to do</p>
<p>about the possibility of new ones?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s parse this out in chunks</p>
<p>that we can have constructive conversations about.</p>
<p>The idea of no nuclear drives me crazy,</p>
<p>just like no fossil fuel subsidies is silly</p>
<p>in the world we inhabit</p>
<p>that has these pockets of no energy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just my sustain what mantras.</p>
<p>Start with some, divide and conquer.</p>
<p>To conquer the dispute over by saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s at least get real.</p>
<p>This power plant has been in the Hudson Valley for 30 years.</p>
<p>It was the baseload, it was baseload.</p>
<p>Baseload is a real thing.</p>
<p>And guess what has filled the gap</p>
<p>since that power plant has turned off?</p>
<p>Natural gas, natural gas.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t hear that from the environmental community</p>
<p>that was so eager to turn off the Indian Point.</p>
<p>I think both the point of saying,</p>
<p>the people are saying it&rsquo;s the end of the world,</p>
<p>but no, I don&rsquo;t want a nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>And Andy&rsquo;s absolutely right to talk about,</p>
<p>so existing nuclear power plants,</p>
<p>we already paid for them.</p>
<p>We already have them.</p>
<p>We already committed to decommissioning them eventually.</p>
<p>While they&rsquo;re running,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty much the cheapest power</p>
<p>you can possibly have on the planet</p>
<p>because it costs almost nothing to run them day to day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically cheap or almost free CO2 baseload power.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just nothing there that you should embrace.</p>
<p>Now, new nuclear power plants</p>
<p>turn out to be very expensive currently.</p>
<p>So the one they built in Finland,</p>
<p>some in the UK and France and several other places</p>
<p>turn out to be incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re much more expensive</p>
<p>than the costliest renewables you can imagine.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re actually not a solution right now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we need the innovation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we need the potentially</p>
<p>fourth generation nuclear power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just simply, it&rsquo;s a bad deal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why nuclear is never gonna win</p>
<p>on its third generation.</p>
<p>Now it may never get there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s certainly a possibility</p>
<p>and we should be looking into it.</p>
<p>And there are wonky realities that need to be dealt with.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States,</p>
<p>their approval process is still locked and designed</p>
<p>on this 50 year old model of big giant power plants.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intense discussion right now</p>
<p>about evolving a new regulatory scheme</p>
<p>for small modular ones</p>
<p>because of all these implicit advantages they offer.</p>
<p>And that, so it, along with the innovation,</p>
<p>you need to have this get out of the way</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re never gonna have the investment.</p>
<p>So it really is an all of the above thing.</p>
<p>Looking at these as systems problems,</p>
<p>systems solutions is really important.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about Alex Epstein.</p>
<p>So he wrote, I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar who he is,</p>
<p>but he wrote a couple of books.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting to ask a question about fossil fuels</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about reality.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s somebody that doesn&rsquo;t just talk</p>
<p>about the reality of fossil fuels,</p>
<p>but he wrote a book,</p>
<p>A Moral Case for Fossil Fuels and Fossil Future,</p>
<p>where he makes the case that, as his subtitle says,</p>
<p>global human flourishing requires oil, coal, and natural gas</p>
<p>or more oil, coal, and natural gas, not less.</p>
<p>What do you think about the argument he makes?</p>
<p>So he pushes, we&rsquo;ve had this kind of,</p>
<p>speaking of the center of this balanced discussion</p>
<p>of the reality of fossil fuels,</p>
<p>but also investing a lot into renewable energy</p>
<p>and then having the $1 to $11 return.</p>
<p>He says, I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how to frame it,</p>
<p>but investing and maintaining investment of fossil fuels</p>
<p>also has a positive return</p>
<p>because of how efficient the energy is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read the first book.</p>
<p>Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t read, I&rsquo;ve got his second one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been planning to have him on my webcast,</p>
<p>my tiny webcast.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name of the webcast?</p>
<p>Sustain what?</p>
<p>Everything I do is sustain what?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, don&rsquo;t talk to me about sustainability.</p>
<p>Sustain what?</p>
<p>For whom?</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re talking, you know?</p>
<p>Interrogatory approach to things.</p>
<p>So I think the valuable part of what he has done</p>
<p>is to remind people, particularly in the West or North</p>
<p>or whatever, the developed world,</p>
<p>that everything we take for granted,</p>
<p>low fertilizer, from low fertilizer prices</p>
<p>to air conditioning to everything else</p>
<p>exists because we had this bounty</p>
<p>that we dug out of the ground or pumped out of the ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a boon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an amazing boon to society, period.</p>
<p>So start there, which means going forward,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re talking about is a substitution</p>
<p>or having your fossil fuels and eating it too,</p>
<p>meaning getting rid of the carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>If you focus on the carbon dioxide,</p>
<p>which is the thing warming the planet,</p>
<p>not the burning of the fuels,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s another way forward</p>
<p>that could sustain fossil fuels.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from at least the first book,</p>
<p>he makes the moral case that fossil fuels</p>
<p>are essentially a good overall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he adequately accounts for the need</p>
<p>to stop global warming.</p>
<p>I think that we have to slow.</p>
<p>Slowing global warming is a fundamental need</p>
<p>in this century we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just not factored into his math.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s where,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few sort of offline conversation with him.</p>
<p>I think he said, because I mentioned</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to the two of you,</p>
<p>he said that that&rsquo;s probably where he disagrees</p>
<p>about sort of the level of threat</p>
<p>that global warming causes.</p>
<p>Well, Steve Koonin is another one.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brilliant guy.</p>
<p>He lived right close to me in the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>He was in the Obama administration energy department.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s K-O-O-N-I-N.</p>
<p>He wrote a bestseller that came out recently</p>
<p>on skepticism about climate.</p>
<p>And there are other smart people who somehow feel</p>
<p>we can literally adapt our way forward</p>
<p>without any constraint on the gases changing the climate.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve spent enough time on this.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m a pretty level-headed reporter</p>
<p>when it comes to this issue.</p>
<p>And I think having some sense that we can adapt our way</p>
<p>into the world we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>through relentless climate change with no new normal,</p>
<p>remember, more gas accumulating in the air every year.</p>
<p>These are not static moments.</p>
<p>That that&rsquo;s a good thing to do doesn&rsquo;t strike me as smart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably say that I think it&rsquo;s more sort of a,</p>
<p>at least the thing that I take away from Alex</p>
<p>is the fact, as you point out,</p>
<p>that we need to recognize that fossil fuels</p>
<p>is basically the backbone of our society today.</p>
<p>We get 80% of our energy from fossil fuels today.</p>
<p>Still, as we did 50 years ago, 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, and people have no sense of this, right?</p>
<p>So they have the idea,</p>
<p>because you see so many wind turbines and solar panels</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s talking about it,</p>
<p>that this is huge, big things.</p>
<p>But the reality is, remember,</p>
<p>only about a fifth of all energy use is electricity.</p>
<p>The rest is in processes and heating,</p>
<p>industrial processes, and so on.</p>
<p>So actually, solar and wind right now</p>
<p>produces 1% of energy from wind and 0.8% from solar.</p>
<p>This is not a huge thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fairly tiny bit.</p>
<p>And growing explosively, but from this-</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s absolutely growing.</p>
<p>But actually, it&rsquo;s growing slower</p>
<p>than what nuclear was growing in the 70s and 80s,</p>
<p>which I thought was a fun point,</p>
<p>not by a little amount, by like two or three times.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re still talking about something</p>
<p>which is somewhat boutique, at least.</p>
<p>And when you then look out into the future,</p>
<p>and I think this is the interesting part of it,</p>
<p>when you look out into the future,</p>
<p>if you look at the Biden administration&rsquo;s own estimate</p>
<p>of what will happen by 2050,</p>
<p>we will be at, if all countries do all the stuff</p>
<p>that they promised and everything,</p>
<p>we will be at 70% fossil fuels by 2050, globally.</p>
<p>This is just, yes, it&rsquo;s a better world.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good that we&rsquo;re now down to 70</p>
<p>instead of 80, but it is still a world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fundamentally dependent on fossil fuels</p>
<p>for almost everything that we really like about the world.</p>
<p>And forgetting that, and I think we are doing that</p>
<p>in the sense, as you also mentioned,</p>
<p>that people say, no fossil fuels.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re, in all development organizations,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now telling the poor countries,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get any funding for anything</p>
<p>that has to do with fossil fuels.</p>
<p>We have literally reduced our investment</p>
<p>in oil and gas by more than half since 2014.</p>
<p>And much of this is because of climate concerns.</p>
<p>This has real world consequences.</p>
<p>This is why energy prices have gone up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the only reason, COVID also,</p>
<p>certainly the war in Ukraine,</p>
<p>but this is an underlying systemic reason</p>
<p>why fossil fuel costs will go up dramatically.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of greens will sort of tend to say,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s great because we want fossil fuels</p>
<p>to be expensive.</p>
<p>We want people to be forced over to renewables,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s very easy to say if you&rsquo;re rich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the kind of thing that New Yorkers will say</p>
<p>when you go to rich, well-meaning, green New Yorkers</p>
<p>and say, yes, gasoline should cost $20 a gallon.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t have a car, you just ride the Metro.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy for you to say that,</p>
<p>but lots of people, both in the rich world,</p>
<p>but in poor parts of the US, but all around the world,</p>
<p>their lives are basically dependent on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>And so the idea that we&rsquo;re gonna get people off</p>
<p>by making it so expensive</p>
<p>that it becomes impossible for them to live good lives</p>
<p>is almost morally reprehensible.</p>
<p>And I think Alex has the right point there.</p>
<p>We need to get people to realize</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna get off fossil fuels anytime soon.</p>
<p>So we need reasonably affordable fossil fuels</p>
<p>for most of the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, of course, why we need to focus so much more</p>
<p>on the innovation so that we can get to the point</p>
<p>where we no longer need fossil fuels as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But to say to everyone,</p>
<p>look, we&rsquo;re gonna make fossil fuels expensive</p>
<p>way before we have the solution is just terrible.</p>
<p>And so much is on the rich countries of the world.</p>
<p>I did a conversation recently with Johan Rockstr√∂m,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a famed sustainability scientist in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Actually, Potsdam now.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s come up with the idea of planetary boundaries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of things he has said that I,</p>
<p>as a journalist, I&rsquo;m still looking into about that.</p>
<p>Planetary boundaries?</p>
<p>Yeah, that there are limits to what Earth can absorb</p>
<p>in human, our use of water, phosphorus,</p>
<p>or carbon dioxide loading in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>There are these tipping, there are these boundaries.</p>
<p>If we cross them, we&rsquo;re in a hot zone, a danger zone.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an interesting thinker.</p>
<p>But on this point, last year at the Glasgow Climate Talks,</p>
<p>he gave a very important talk about the equity thing here,</p>
<p>that you, he basically laid out a landscape</p>
<p>saying the rich nations of the world</p>
<p>need to greatly ramp up their reduction of emissions</p>
<p>or what they&rsquo;re gonna pay poor countries to do</p>
<p>to allow poor countries,</p>
<p>some of which have fossil resources, like in Africa,</p>
<p>to have the carbon space,</p>
<p>to own whatever space or time is left</p>
<p>to be able to develop their fossil fuels</p>
<p>as a fundamental right.</p>
<p>Because also, they&rsquo;re starting from this little baseline.</p>
<p>Ghana hasn&rsquo;t contributed squat</p>
<p>to the global warming problem in terms of emissions.</p>
<p>Ghana has natural gas.</p>
<p>And right now, this month,</p>
<p>environmental groups are outside the World Bank today,</p>
<p>actually tonight, saying this was on their list</p>
<p>of dirty projects.</p>
<p>World Bank should stop financing Ghana&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>to get gas out of the ground,</p>
<p>to develop its economy, get its people less poor,</p>
<p>make them more productive, innovative parts of humanity.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s really reprehensible.</p>
<p>One of the other projects on their list</p>
<p>as a World Bank kind of gotcha,</p>
<p>like how dare they give money,</p>
<p>was for a fertilizer factory in Bangladesh</p>
<p>that is designed to get three times as much fertilizer</p>
<p>from the same amount of natural gas</p>
<p>as the old plants that are now dormant.</p>
<p>This is in a time when we&rsquo;re facing high energy prices,</p>
<p>high gas prices, high food prices,</p>
<p>when food insecurity is spreading rapidly,</p>
<p>when a country like Bangladesh has millions of rice farmers</p>
<p>who need urea tablets to put in their rice fields.</p>
<p>And to say how dare they finance that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a fossil fuel involved is immoral.</p>
<p>So yes, on that point from Alex.</p>
<p>So this is 2022 poll, polls.</p>
<p>Just this is a bunch of different ways</p>
<p>to look at the same basic effect.</p>
<p>In the United States, Democrats, younger Americans</p>
<p>identify dealing with climate change as a top priority.</p>
<p>US adults, 42% say that dealing with climate change</p>
<p>should be a top priority.</p>
<p>11% of Republicans, 65% of Democrats.</p>
<p>And we could see this effect throughout.</p>
<p>46% of Americans say human activity</p>
<p>contributes a great deal to climate change.</p>
<p>By the way, this is a little bit different</p>
<p>than what we were discussing.</p>
<p>I was just looking through different polls.</p>
<p>In the public, there seems to still be uncertainty</p>
<p>about how much humans contribute to climate change</p>
<p>more than the scientific assessment.</p>
<p>It would only be 24% that disagree</p>
<p>with the UN Climate Panel, right?</p>
<p>Three quarters would agree.</p>
<p>Are you uncomfortable about the 29?</p>
<p>No, 29 is actually, it&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I mean, the UN doesn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>Well, they say that could be the border case.</p>
<p>But anyway, this is interesting.</p>
<p>But to me, across all these polls,</p>
<p>if you look Republican versus Democrat,</p>
<p>Republican, say that 17% say it&rsquo;s a great deal.</p>
<p>Democrats say 71% say it&rsquo;s a great deal.</p>
<p>And you just see this complete division.</p>
<p>I think you probably, with the COVID pandemic,</p>
<p>you can ask a lot of questions like this.</p>
<p>Do masks work?</p>
<p>Are they an effective method</p>
<p>to slow transmission of a pandemic?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably have the same kind of polls</p>
<p>about Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>And while the effectiveness of masks,</p>
<p>to me, is a scientific question.</p>
<p>But, so there&rsquo;s different truths here, apparently.</p>
<p>One is a scientific truth.</p>
<p>One is a truth held by the scientific community,</p>
<p>which seems to be also different</p>
<p>than the scientific truth sometimes.</p>
<p>And the other is the public perception</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s polluted or affected by political affiliation.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s whatever is the narrative</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s communicated by the media.</p>
<p>They will also have a question,</p>
<p>answer to the question of whether masks work or not.</p>
<p>And they will also have an answer</p>
<p>to the question about all these climate-related things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a long way of asking the question</p>
<p>of how is politics mixed into all of this?</p>
<p>On the communication front,</p>
<p>on the figuring out what the right policy is front,</p>
<p>on the friction of humanity</p>
<p>in the face of the right policies.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve written a ton on this.</p>
<p>After I had that conversion about the social science,</p>
<p>when 2006, I began digging in a lot more</p>
<p>on how people hold beliefs and what they do</p>
<p>as opposed to what they think,</p>
<p>and questions about polling.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two things that come to me</p>
<p>that make me not worry about the basic literacy,</p>
<p>like is climate change X percent of whatever?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain why.</p>
<p>For one thing, more science literacy,</p>
<p>more basic literacy, like what is a greenhouse gas,</p>
<p>all that stuff.</p>
<p>Dan Kahane, K-A-H-A-N, at Yale.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually at Yale Law School.</p>
<p>The last decade, he did all this work</p>
<p>on what he calls cultural cognition,</p>
<p>which is, and he did studies that showed</p>
<p>how what you believe emerges based on culture,</p>
<p>based on your background, your red, blue,</p>
<p>or where you are in the country.</p>
<p>And one of the really disturbing findings</p>
<p>was that the people who have the most basic science literacy</p>
<p>like who know the most about greenhouse effect or whatever,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at both ends of the spectrum of views on climate,</p>
<p>dismissives and alarmed.</p>
<p>Steve Koonin, as I mentioned, is a good example.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brilliant physicist, and he knows all the science,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s completely at the end of skepticism.</p>
<p>Will Happer, who was close to being Trump&rsquo;s science advisor,</p>
<p>was even more out there, and he&rsquo;s on,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re both on the Jason Committee</p>
<p>that advises the government on big strategic things.</p>
<p>And people who are really alarmed about it</p>
<p>also have the same belief.</p>
<p>So as a journalist, I was thinking,</p>
<p>do I just spend my time writing more explanatory stories</p>
<p>that explain the science better?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do I dig in on this work to understand</p>
<p>what brings people together?</p>
<p>And then these same surveys, the same science shows you,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t make it about climate, among other things,</p>
<p>this becomes, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about this anymore.</p>
<p>If you Google for no red-blue divide climate, Revkin,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find a piece I did with some really good graphs.</p>
<p>Essentially, it shows that in America,</p>
<p>this is the Yale group again,</p>
<p>their climate communication group.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no red-blue divide on energy innovation, none.</p>
<p>We need more climate energy, clean energy innovation.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t even a divide, country by, state by state,</p>
<p>on whether CO2 should be regulated as a pollutant.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all like, what are the questions you ask?</p>
<p>If you ask about innovation,</p>
<p>if you ask about more incentives for renewable power.</p>
<p>Oklahoma, Iowa, you know,</p>
<p>I did a piece when I was at ProPublica</p>
<p>showing that the 17 states that were fighting Obama</p>
<p>in court over his clean power plan,</p>
<p>were actually, the majority of them</p>
<p>were actually meeting the targets</p>
<p>that the clean power plan had</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re expanding wind power already.</p>
<p>Not because of the climate,</p>
<p>because it makes money sense and energy sense.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a political divide in this?</p>
<p>There is on climate, if you call it climate.</p>
<p>If you say it&rsquo;s a climate,</p>
<p>do you believe in the climate crisis?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not asking,</p>
<p>what kind of energy future do you want in your town?</p>
<p>And so if you ask that question,</p>
<p>the polarization goes away.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m asking, is there polarization on policy?</p>
<p>No, well there, again,</p>
<p>the bipartisan infrastructure law</p>
<p>that was passed last November, that was bipartisan.</p>
<p>All of Congress said yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a trillion dollars,</p>
<p>several hundred billion of which</p>
<p>are for cleaner energy and resilience.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And that, but it&rsquo;s not a climate bill.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t a tax.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incentives.</p>
<p>So the word climate and similar words</p>
<p>are just used as part of the signaling, like masks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>As Dan Kahan&rsquo;s work, the guy at Yale,</p>
<p>he really demonstrated powerfully</p>
<p>abortion, gun rights, climate.</p>
<p>And a more parsed level of nuclear power</p>
<p>has enduring camps that for and against.</p>
<p>Why do the camps form?</p>
<p>Some of it&rsquo;s cultural cognition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how you grew up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what you fear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no common human frame for.</p>
<p>Is it because of like folks,</p>
<p>like certain individuals like Al Gore?</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Like he would make a film.</p>
<p>He cares about this thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Democrat.</p>
<p>Therefore I hate this thing.</p>
<p>Therefore I don&rsquo;t like this thing, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh sure, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, when people get attached to an issue,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what pops into your head,</p>
<p>when you hear climate, then.</p>
<p>And it got politicized.</p>
<p>It became emblematic.</p>
<p>And the whole vaccine thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not American,</p>
<p>so I should stay a little bit out of this,</p>
<p>but I think it seems to me that a lot of the thing</p>
<p>that people believe and talk about</p>
<p>is really about what they worry that that will lead to</p>
<p>in terms of policy down the line.</p>
<p>So a little bit like, do masks work?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of imagining, I don&rsquo;t know whether this is true,</p>
<p>but I think part of it is if I say masks work,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna force me to wear it for the next year.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t work because then I don&rsquo;t have to wear it</p>
<p>kind of thing.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s really, you&rsquo;re looking much further down the line.</p>
<p>And certainly on climate, it seems to me</p>
<p>that a lot of the people who say it&rsquo;s not real,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not because they don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s real,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t want you to then come</p>
<p>and regulate it really heavily.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t like top-down government.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also because they don&rsquo;t want another tax.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s not a science,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a straight science question.</p>
<p>It really is a question of what do you want to do?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I think, Andy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re much, much more right in saying</p>
<p>we should have that discussion.</p>
<p>So what do you wanna do?</p>
<p>Because that will be a much easier conversation to say,</p>
<p>do you wanna do really smart, cheap stuff?</p>
<p>Or do you wanna do pretty dumb, expensive stuff?</p>
<p>When you put it that way, you can get most people on board.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not as simple as that, I know.</p>
<p>And it gets back to what you said earlier,</p>
<p>that again, you talked about collaborative cooperation</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy at Columbia, Peter Coleman,</p>
<p>who runs this thing called</p>
<p>the Difficult Conversations Laboratory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And when I first heard about it, I was like,</p>
<p>oh man, we need that, you know?</p>
<p>His background&rsquo;s in psychology and conflict resolution,</p>
<p>mostly at the global scale related to atrocities</p>
<p>that countries are trying to get over.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a science to how to hold a better conversation,</p>
<p>as you, either through experience or whatever, know.</p>
<p>If you hold a debate,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna be in a debate with Bjorn.</p>
<p>We could find lots of things we disagree on.</p>
<p>But that takes it back to the win-lose model, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how you make progress.</p>
<p>And what Peter, what I learned, absorbed from him,</p>
<p>Peter Coleman, because I was thinking like,</p>
<p>we need room for agreement.</p>
<p>I need to build a room for agreement.</p>
<p>My blog and at the Times and then the stuff I do now,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like, how can we talk and come to agreement?</p>
<p>He says, no, no, you don&rsquo;t want agreement.</p>
<p>You want cooperation.</p>
<p>That allows you to hold onto your beliefs.</p>
<p>But to, you know, we can disbelieve it.</p>
<p>We can disagree on all these things,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s cooperate on that one thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really valuable distinction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s needed so much in this arena,</p>
<p>because as I said earlier,</p>
<p>you can parse it right down to the whole menu</p>
<p>of things Joe Manchin wanted, you know,</p>
<p>transmission lines.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna have big fights over transmission lines.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got billions of dollars to spend</p>
<p>expanding America&rsquo;s grid.</p>
<p>And every community in America is gonna say, not here.</p>
<p>So how do you foster a federal local dialogue</p>
<p>that allows that to happen</p>
<p>if you want to have any hope of a better grid?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like, those insights come from behavioral sciences</p>
<p>that I think are completely undervalued in this area.</p>
<p>Pilka loves to quote, I can&rsquo;t, I think it&rsquo;s Lippert.</p>
<p>Oh, Walter Lippman.</p>
<p>Lippman, yes, that democracy is not about,</p>
<p>you know, everybody agreeing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about different people disagreeing,</p>
<p>but doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Doing one thing together.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, agreeing that we&rsquo;re gonna do this thing.</p>
<p>So you can disagree, but still do a thing,</p>
<p>you know, possibly for very different reasons.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s an amazing video clip</p>
<p>that shows this so powerfully.</p>
<p>2015 was the buildup to the Paris talks</p>
<p>that led to the Paris agreement, you know, this.</p>
<p>And a really talented journalist at CNN at the time,</p>
<p>Don Sutter, who&rsquo;s from Oklahoma originally,</p>
<p>he saw another Yale study that was a county-by-county study</p>
<p>of American attitudes on global warming,</p>
<p>like right down to the county level.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this little glowing data point</p>
<p>in Woodward County, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Woodward County, Oklahoma was ground zero</p>
<p>for climate skepticism, climate denial,</p>
<p>whatever you wanna call it.</p>
<p>And he thought, oh, I&rsquo;m gonna go there.</p>
<p>And he went there just to meet people on the street,</p>
<p>talk to them about energy and weather.</p>
<p>And he did these little interviews.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this one with this guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like a middle-aged oil company employee,</p>
<p>like a business, like an administrator,</p>
<p>Thai kind of guy.</p>
<p>And he starts out the interview,</p>
<p>and the guy is saying like,</p>
<p>you know, well, you know, God controls the environment.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re watching this, you&rsquo;re just going,</p>
<p>okay, this is gonna be interesting.</p>
<p>And the backstory, by the way,</p>
<p>is the guy, he paid for the local playground</p>
<p>to have dinosaurs and people,</p>
<p>like toy dinosaurs and people on the playground,</p>
<p>because he believes in creation,</p>
<p>you know, 6,000-year creation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the guy, right?</p>
<p>And then he gets to energy, and the guy says,</p>
<p>you know, the same guy who believes</p>
<p>God controls the environment says,</p>
<p>you know, we have half of our roof covered</p>
<p>with solar panels, and we wanna get off the grid entirely.</p>
<p>And when I show this to audiences, I say,</p>
<p>just pause and think about that for a second.</p>
<p>If you went, why do you think that&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s independent.</p>
<p>He wants to have his own source of power.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s libertarian.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want the government telling him what to do.</p>
<p>He would never vote for Hillary, I guarantee you.</p>
<p>This is 2015.</p>
<p>But he wanted to get off the grid entirely</p>
<p>to be his own, to be himself.</p>
<p>And so then I say, okay, so if you were going</p>
<p>around the country with your climate crisis placard,</p>
<p>and you go to Woodward County,</p>
<p>do you think that would be a productive way</p>
<p>to go to that place and make your case?</p>
<p>And the answer is pretty obvious, no.</p>
<p>If you go in there and you listen,</p>
<p>like listening is such an important property</p>
<p>that we all forget, including journalists,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re much more apt to find a path to cooperation.</p>
<p>You could talk to him about, I guarantee,</p>
<p>if I went there today, maybe I should go</p>
<p>to talk about this new bill, $370 billion.</p>
<p>How do we make that work, you know, at the local level?</p>
<p>How do we answer that guy at the energy department,</p>
<p>Jigar Shah, so how do we put this to work</p>
<p>to get our buses off, to get electrified</p>
<p>or transition our street lamps and stuff?</p>
<p>You could have a good chat with him.</p>
<p>If you go in there and say, I&rsquo;m here to debate you</p>
<p>to death on global warming, forget about it.</p>
<p>Actually, let me ask you a question,</p>
<p>given your roots as a journalist.</p>
<p>So yeah, talking to a guy you disagree with,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>What about talking to people that might be,</p>
<p>society might consider bad, unethical, even evil?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of a journalist in that context?</p>
<p>So climate change is a large number of people</p>
<p>that believe one thing, a large number of people</p>
<p>that believe another thing.</p>
<p>It turns out, even with people that society deems as evil,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a large number of people that support them.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your role as a journalist to talk to them?</p>
<p>Well, I have talked to really bad people.</p>
<p>When I wrote about the murder of Chico Mendes,</p>
<p>a Brazilian Amazon rainforest activist in 1989,</p>
<p>I interviewed the killers.</p>
<p>One was in jail, several of them were just ranchers</p>
<p>who, they had their point of view.</p>
<p>They were there in the Amazon rainforest to,</p>
<p>the word in Brazil and Portuguese is limpar,</p>
<p>to clean the land.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the bandarantes, the pioneers of Brazil.</p>
<p>They go into these frontiers and tame them</p>
<p>like we had in our West.</p>
<p>And they would bring that up too.</p>
<p>They would say to me, well, you did this.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t say you murdered your Native Americans</p>
<p>and stuff, but they could easily have said that too,</p>
<p>and you deforested all your landscapes.</p>
<p>So who are you to come down here to?</p>
<p>But if I didn&rsquo;t talk to them,</p>
<p>that would be not a way to do journalism.</p>
<p>But when you talk to them, did you empathize with them</p>
<p>or did you push back?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ultimate question.</p>
<p>Like if you want to understand,</p>
<p>like if you talk to Hitler in 1941,</p>
<p>you empathize with him or do you push back?</p>
<p>Because most journalists would push</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to signal to fellow journalists</p>
<p>and to people back home that this,</p>
<p>me, the journalist is on the right side.</p>
<p>But if you actually want to understand the person,</p>
<p>you should empathize.</p>
<p>If you want to be the kind of person</p>
<p>that actually understands in the full arc of history,</p>
<p>you need to empathize.</p>
<p>I find that journalists, a lot of times,</p>
<p>perhaps they&rsquo;re protecting their job,</p>
<p>their reputation, their sanity,</p>
<p>are not willing to empathize.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think this happened with Joe Manchin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing any kind of equation here</p>
<p>related to Hitler and Joe Manchin or Trump.</p>
<p>I mean, Trump, I interviewed the guy, Will Hepper,</p>
<p>I mentioned, who was a physicist at Princeton</p>
<p>who thinks carbon dioxide is the greatest thing in the world</p>
<p>and we should have more of it in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I profoundly disagree on that point.</p>
<p>But I interviewed him for an hour</p>
<p>and it was so interesting</p>
<p>because he was trying to kind of rope-a-dope me</p>
<p>into making it about CO2 and climate</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a super smart physicist.</p>
<p>And I kind of said, let&rsquo;s talk about some other things.</p>
<p>And we started talking about education</p>
<p>and science education.</p>
<p>He went on for like 20 minutes</p>
<p>about the vital importance of better science education</p>
<p>for Americans.</p>
<p>He drew on people he knew from Europe, Hungary,</p>
<p>a bunch of Nobel Prize winners</p>
<p>came from some town in Hungary, at least a couple.</p>
<p>And he said that he learned their teachers.</p>
<p>At any rate, he went at a long exposition on that.</p>
<p>He then defended climate science.</p>
<p>He said, we need more climate science.</p>
<p>He says, I love this stuff.</p>
<p>I love the ocean buoys.</p>
<p>There are now thousands of them in the oceans</p>
<p>charting clear pictures of ocean circulation and satellites.</p>
<p>And he said something really important</p>
<p>that many people discount,</p>
<p>which is we need sustained investment</p>
<p>in monitoring this planet.</p>
<p>We neglect our systems</p>
<p>that just tell us what&rsquo;s happening in the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s happened over and over again.</p>
<p>So if I had left it,</p>
<p>if I had gone into the terrain of the fight over CO2,</p>
<p>some journalist friends might say,</p>
<p>oh, that was a good mashup, you know, matchup.</p>
<p>But I found these really profound and important things</p>
<p>that I wanted the world to know about</p>
<p>in the context of whether Trump</p>
<p>was gonna have him as a science advisor.</p>
<p>And so if I hadn&rsquo;t gone there,</p>
<p>and a lot of people, if you look back,</p>
<p>I got hammered for doing that, even from friends.</p>
<p>And then later, John Holdren,</p>
<p>who had been Obama&rsquo;s science advisor for eight years,</p>
<p>he said, I would rather have Will Happer</p>
<p>as Trump&rsquo;s science advisor than no science advisor.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s a landscape</p>
<p>of things that are important.</p>
<p>He recognized that Happer&rsquo;s really smart about defense</p>
<p>and all kinds of things, too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you do have to sort of screw up your,</p>
<p>ideally, screw up your courage,</p>
<p>but then not necessarily get into the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like with the guy in Oklahoma, you know.</p>
<p>If you go in looking for the differences, you&rsquo;ll find them.</p>
<p>You can amplify them.</p>
<p>You can leave with this paralyzed sense</p>
<p>of nothing having happened that was useful.</p>
<p>Or you can find these nuggets.</p>
<p>Everyone is a human being.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t play the mind game</p>
<p>of what I would have asked to Hitler, but.</p>
<p>I play that mind game all the time,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s for another conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I had many in my family that have suffered under him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he is a human being.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And people sometimes caricature Hitler,</p>
<p>saying that&rsquo;s when you mention Hitler,</p>
<p>the conversation devolves.</p>
<p>Oh, right, you&rsquo;ve got a certain point.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>I think sort of these extremes</p>
<p>are useful thought experiments to understand,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re not willing to take your ideals</p>
<p>to that extreme, then maybe your ideals need some rethinking</p>
<p>from a journalistic perspective, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>A number of years ago,</p>
<p>my wife and I were with our veterinarian,</p>
<p>who was German-born, Dr. Bach, B-A-C-H.</p>
<p>We were talking about the dog and stuff,</p>
<p>and then we were talking about Trump.</p>
<p>And he just mentioned in passing,</p>
<p>he said, my mother voted for Hitler.</p>
<p>Wow, that hit me like a brick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because it was so, at the very least,</p>
<p>understanding how pathways that lead to</p>
<p>people doing things like he did and ordered is essential.</p>
<p>And the only way to understand that is to dig in</p>
<p>and ask questions and get uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It still makes my hair prickle</p>
<p>when I think back to him saying,</p>
<p>yeah, my mom voted for Hitler.</p>
<p>That somehow makes it super real, like, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s elections, there&rsquo;s real people</p>
<p>living their lives and-</p>
<p>Exactly, struggling with a broken economy</p>
<p>and all kinds of-</p>
<p>Having their own little personal resentments</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about presidents, American presidents.</p>
<p>Who had a positive or negative impact</p>
<p>on climate change efforts, in your view?</p>
<p>Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden.</p>
<p>Or maybe you could say that they don&rsquo;t have much of an impact.</p>
<p>So, like, they, in public discourse,</p>
<p>presidents have a kind of,</p>
<p>maybe, disproportional,</p>
<p>like, we imagine they have a huge amount of impact.</p>
<p>How much impact do they actually have on climate policy?</p>
<p>Very-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have comments on this.</p>
<p>Well, there is a background decarbonization rate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened for 150 years.</p>
<p>We move from wood to charcoal to coal to oil</p>
<p>and gas is cleaner, it&rsquo;s more hydrogen, less carbon.</p>
<p>And when you, I asked recently,</p>
<p>I asked some really smart scientists</p>
<p>who study these long trajectories of energy.</p>
<p>When you look at those curves,</p>
<p>is there anything in that curve that says,</p>
<p>oh, climate treaty, 1992?</p>
<p>Oh, Paris?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>Or China, I mean, when China came in</p>
<p>with its huge growth in emissions,</p>
<p>that created a bit of a recarbonization blip.</p>
<p>But that was this huge growth in their economy</p>
<p>that pulled a bunch of people out of poverty.</p>
<p>So, yeah, no, presidents don&rsquo;t really change anything</p>
<p>on timescales that we would measure,</p>
<p>as meaning, where you could parse it out.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s not to say that Obama&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and the current focus on the stimulus that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>which includes a lot more money for research,</p>
<p>et cetera, and innovation.</p>
<p>I do think that will be beneficial</p>
<p>in a very, very long run.</p>
<p>But I have to say, when Obama stood up</p>
<p>and took credit for reductions from moving from coal to gas</p>
<p>because of fracking, that was actually Cheney</p>
<p>who set that in motion.</p>
<p>I was thinking, I would say Bush,</p>
<p>not because I like him or anything,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s the guy who inadvertently started fracking.</p>
<p>It goes further back than that.</p>
<p>It was a federal investment in fracking</p>
<p>in the 60s and 70s.</p>
<p>And then this one guy in Texas, right here in Texas,</p>
<p>George Mischel, who cobbled together technology.</p>
<p>And that led to this real dramatic change from gas to coal</p>
<p>that mostly played out in the Obama years,</p>
<p>but that really was stimulated</p>
<p>by Cheney&rsquo;s early energy task force, 2001,</p>
<p>when they were getting into office.</p>
<p>And also, Bush did something interesting</p>
<p>in the whole wonky climate treaty process.</p>
<p>It was under Bush that they started to focus on sectors.</p>
<p>Oh, and also on big emitters.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about 200 countries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about basically eight or 10 countries.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get them into a room</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s have these little subrooms</p>
<p>on electrification, on mining, on whatever,</p>
<p>and by parsing it out.</p>
<p>And Obama picked up the same model.</p>
<p>They had different names for it</p>
<p>because presidents always name something different</p>
<p>than the last president.</p>
<p>One was the major economies forum,</p>
<p>and then it was the major emitters, something or other.</p>
<p>And that, getting away from the treaty dots and dashes</p>
<p>toward just sectoral, big sectors that matter,</p>
<p>gas, electrification, makes a difference.</p>
<p>But again, you couldn&rsquo;t ever measure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the lag time would be a point of measure.</p>
<p>And also, I think one very under-reported fact,</p>
<p>so the UNEP, the Environment Program,</p>
<p>they come out with what they call a gap report every year,</p>
<p>where they estimate how much is the world doing</p>
<p>compared to what should it or has it promised to do.</p>
<p>Emissions.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in 2019, so just before COVID hit,</p>
<p>they actually did a survey of the 2010s.</p>
<p>So the last big sort of report on how well are we doing.</p>
<p>And their takeaway quote,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not gonna get this right,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty much what they said was,</p>
<p>if you take the world as if we hadn&rsquo;t cared</p>
<p>about climate change since 2005,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t tell the difference between that world</p>
<p>and the world that we&rsquo;re actually living in.</p>
<p>So despite the fact that we&rsquo;ve had 10 years</p>
<p>of immense focus on climate, and everybody talks about it,</p>
<p>and the Paris Agreement,</p>
<p>which is perhaps the biggest global sort of agreement</p>
<p>in what we&rsquo;re gonna be doing, you can&rsquo;t actually tell.</p>
<p>And that, I think, is incredibly important</p>
<p>because what it tells you is,</p>
<p>all that we&rsquo;re doing is, not even on the margin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of smaller than that,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure what that is,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re basically dealing in,</p>
<p>for instance, the UK loves to point out</p>
<p>that they have dramatically reduced their carbon emissions,</p>
<p>and they have.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve really dramatically lowered their emissions,</p>
<p>mostly because they&rsquo;ve de-industrialized.</p>
<p>They basically said, look, we&rsquo;re just gonna be bankers</p>
<p>for all of you guys,</p>
<p>and then everybody else is gonna produce our stuff,</p>
<p>which of course is great for Britain,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s great for Britain,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t all do that.</p>
<p>And so most of what we&rsquo;re trying to do right now</p>
<p>is sort of this virtue signaling.</p>
<p>It makes us feel good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of, yeah, on the margin,</p>
<p>or in the very tiny margin,</p>
<p>but what we basically,</p>
<p>and that was, Andy, your point with China.</p>
<p>The reason why we can&rsquo;t tell the difference, of course,</p>
<p>is because China basically became the workshop for everyone.</p>
<p>And so not only did they lift</p>
<p>more than half a million people out of poverty,</p>
<p>sorry, half a billion.</p>
<p>Yes, half a billion people out of poverty,</p>
<p>but they also basically took over</p>
<p>most production in the world.</p>
<p>And so, of course, many rich countries could decarbonize,</p>
<p>or at least reduce their carbon emissions</p>
<p>and feel very virtuous about it,</p>
<p>but fundamentally, we haven&rsquo;t solved</p>
<p>how does the world do this?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think we&rsquo;re also left with this sense of,</p>
<p>not only are we being told this is an unmitigated catastrophe</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why this is the only thing</p>
<p>we should be focusing on,</p>
<p>but also somehow, and we can all fix it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we have any sense</p>
<p>of how hard this is actually gonna be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, of course, why I would go back and say,</p>
<p>look, the only way you&rsquo;re gonna fix this</p>
<p>is through innovation,</p>
<p>because if you have something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cheaper than fossil fuels, you&rsquo;ve fixed it.</p>
<p>If you have something that&rsquo;s harder</p>
<p>and costlier and more inconvenient,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re just not gonna make it.</p>
<p>And getting more time by cutting vulnerability.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The pockets of vulnerability on the planet are huge</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re identifiable and you know what to do.</p>
<p>What are the biggest pockets of vulnerability?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Infrastructure of cities?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s where people are living</p>
<p>and what their capacities are.</p>
<p>So moving people, how do you decrease</p>
<p>the vulnerability in the world?</p>
<p>What are the big-</p>
<p>Affordable housing.</p>
<p>One reason so many people moved out of San Francisco</p>
<p>and adjacent cities into the countryside</p>
<p>and then had their houses burned down</p>
<p>is because they can&rsquo;t afford to live in the city anymore.</p>
<p>So affordable housing in cities</p>
<p>can limit exposure to, in that case, wildfire.</p>
<p>Durban, South Africa,</p>
<p>that terrible devastating flood they had this year,</p>
<p>past year, who was washed away?</p>
<p>Poor people who don&rsquo;t have any place to live.</p>
<p>So they settled in a floodplain</p>
<p>along a stream bed that&rsquo;s livable</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not raining buckets.</p>
<p>And those are vulnerabilities that are there</p>
<p>because of dislocation, housing.</p>
<p>Tacloban, this typhoon that hit the Philippines terribly</p>
<p>ahead of the Paris talks, or was it the previous one?</p>
<p>No, it was in 2013, I believe.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Thousands died.</p>
<p>Most of the stories that were written</p>
<p>were framed around climate change</p>
<p>because the Pope made a deal about it.</p>
<p>It was just before the climate talks of that year.</p>
<p>And what happened, partially why there were so many losses,</p>
<p>was Tacloban City had quadrupled in population</p>
<p>in the last 30 years.</p>
<p>And most of the people coming into the city</p>
<p>were poor, looking for work,</p>
<p>and settling in marginal places</p>
<p>where a storm surge killed them.</p>
<p>So those are things we,</p>
<p>whatever the we is in the different places,</p>
<p>really can work on.</p>
<p>And that gives more flex for sure</p>
<p>in thinking about how this long trajectory</p>
<p>that seems so immovable and so hard,</p>
<p>the decarbonization part, there&rsquo;s no excuse.</p>
<p>I wrote a piece, I guess a year ago.</p>
<p>I said there&rsquo;s a vulnerability emergency</p>
<p>hiding behind this climate emergency label.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what needs work.</p>
<p>And also on the Tacloban,</p>
<p>I mean, the hurricane that hit in 2013,</p>
<p>there was almost a similar hurricane</p>
<p>in the early part of 1900s</p>
<p>that hit pretty much the same strength</p>
<p>and it eradicated half the city.</p>
<p>It killed half the city.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happened since then is</p>
<p>people just got much, much richer</p>
<p>from early 1900 to 2013.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just moved a lot of people out of poverty.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a lot bigger.</p>
<p>And yeah.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is even a bigger example of that.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, they had horrible cyclones,</p>
<p>one of which was the Beatles,</p>
<p>George Harrison&rsquo;s Concert for Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Great album that I still have somewhere.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>He did a concert, a fundraising concert,</p>
<p>the Concert for Bangladesh</p>
<p>after this terrible cyclone tragedy hit Bangladesh.</p>
<p>And I think there were several hundred thousand</p>
<p>who were killed.</p>
<p>And a couple like that around that time.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has been hit by comparable storms recently.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Every death is terrible, but it&rsquo;s like 123 deaths.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just because of wealth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because people know what to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s cell phones.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they have elevated platforms</p>
<p>in many communities in the floodplains there</p>
<p>that you know to get to.</p>
<p>So they went from hundreds of thousands of deaths</p>
<p>in a cyclone to 123.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>When we were working with Bangladesh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no longer the problem of people dying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that their cattle dies.</p>
<p>So, you know, they want cattle places</p>
<p>where you could herd your cattle.</p>
<p>This is their capital.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not to make fun of it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an amazing progress</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve stopped worrying about your parents dying</p>
<p>and you worry about your cows dying.</p>
<p>And when I was talking about social innovation,</p>
<p>the other hour, there&rsquo;s a model emerging in Bangladesh</p>
<p>for farmers to move from raising chickens, poultry, to ducks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>And ducks actually fetch a higher price at the market.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>When you get flooded-</p>
<p>They survive.</p>
<p>You can still have your income and your future.</p>
<p>So let me ask you to give advice,</p>
<p>put on your sage, wise hat,</p>
<p>and give advice to young people</p>
<p>that are looking into this world</p>
<p>and see how they can do the most good.</p>
<p>We talked about what is the $1</p>
<p>that can do the most positive improvement</p>
<p>to lead to $40, $45, and so on.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people</p>
<p>in high school and college</p>
<p>how to have a positive impact on the world,</p>
<p>how to have a career they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Maybe ask Bjorn first,</p>
<p>and how to have a life they can be proud of.</p>
<p>So I think, and this really pretty well reflects</p>
<p>the whole conversation we&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to sort of take the catastrophism</p>
<p>out of the climate conversation.</p>
<p>And this really matters</p>
<p>because a lot of kids literally think</p>
<p>that the world is gonna end pretty soon.</p>
<p>And that obviously makes any other kind of plan</p>
<p>meaningless.</p>
<p>So first of all, look, you&rsquo;re not going to die.</p>
<p>That poster that a lot of kids have,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna die from old age,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna die from climate.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna die from old age</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna die much older, very likely.</p>
<p>So the reality is the world has improved dramatically</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very likely to improve even more.</p>
<p>So the baseline is good.</p>
<p>This is just the facts.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s still lots and lots of problems.</p>
<p>And what you should do as a young person</p>
<p>is stop being paralyzed by fear</p>
<p>and then realize what you can do</p>
<p>is basically help humanity become even smarter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different places you can do.</p>
<p>I mean, the obvious thing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about climate is,</p>
<p>what if you could become the guy</p>
<p>that develops fourth generation nuclear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that neither of us know anything about right now,</p>
<p>but develop the energy source</p>
<p>that will basically power the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>How cool would that be?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the many things you could do.</p>
<p>But again, also remember,</p>
<p>there are lots and lots of other things that need solutions.</p>
<p>So what about you become the guy that makes the,</p>
<p>or the girl that makes the social innovation</p>
<p>in Tanzania or in Kenya, sorry, in Kenya,</p>
<p>or what about if you become the person</p>
<p>who finds a way that is a much cheaper,</p>
<p>more effective way to tackle tuberculosis right now,</p>
<p>it needs four to six months of medication,</p>
<p>that one of the big problems is</p>
<p>once you pop the pills and you&rsquo;re fresh,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to get people to do it</p>
<p>for the other five and a half months, right?</p>
<p>And you need that,</p>
<p>otherwise you actually have a big risk</p>
<p>of getting a multi-drug resistant tuberculosis,</p>
<p>which is a real scourge on the earth.</p>
<p>So what if you develop that?</p>
<p>So the truth is, not only can your life be much better</p>
<p>when you sort of ditch that doomerism,</p>
<p>but it also becomes much more possible</p>
<p>for you to be a positive part</p>
<p>of making sure that you do that progress.</p>
<p>Why has the world improved so much?</p>
<p>Because our parents and great grandparents,</p>
<p>they made all this work,</p>
<p>this was all their innovations and a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful that they&rsquo;ve done it,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s kind of time to pay back.</p>
<p>So you got to do this for our grandkids,</p>
<p>you got to make those innovations,</p>
<p>make those policy opportunities,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll make the world an even better place.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And to me, there&rsquo;s never been a better time</p>
<p>to be effective as a young person</p>
<p>because the internet, connectedness,</p>
<p>you can brainstorm with someone in another country</p>
<p>just as easily as you can brainstorm</p>
<p>with someone down the block when we were kids.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, my pen pal was letters</p>
<p>taking weeks to come.</p>
<p>And so the key properties, ideally,</p>
<p>that young people would do well to cultivate</p>
<p>are, well, certainly adaptability,</p>
<p>because change is changing.</p>
<p>Not just, you know, the rate of change is changing.</p>
<p>These layers of change are all piling up on each other.</p>
<p>Having an ability to understand</p>
<p>the information environment is a fundamental need now</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t a need when we were growing up.</p>
<p>We read a few newspapers,</p>
<p>my dad would turn on the nightly news,</p>
<p>and Walter Cronkite would say, that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>He would say, that&rsquo;s the way it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so not the way the media environment is now.</p>
<p>So courses in media literacy should be kind of</p>
<p>fundamental parts of curriculum from like kindergarten on,</p>
<p>or parents can do the same thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a woman at URI, University of Rhode Island,</p>
<p>Renee Hobbs, who teaches a course in propaganda literacy.</p>
<p>And she said, you know, the history of the word is not bad.</p>
<p>Propaganda could be good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pro, it&rsquo;s for the church.</p>
<p>She did a wonderful chat with the,</p>
<p>she laid this out, and, but understanding</p>
<p>when it is propaganda, like the tobacco, you know,</p>
<p>there is hopefully a difference between that and that,</p>
<p>cigarette ads and journalistically acquired information.</p>
<p>So Akita, everything Bjorn was talking about too,</p>
<p>is just understanding how to not be sucked</p>
<p>into this information environment</p>
<p>and spit out as a paralyzed, doomist entity.</p>
<p>Because once you have an ability to step back,</p>
<p>then you can use Twitter or whatever you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>to find people who might have a skillset you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that is something you need to do</p>
<p>to incorporate, to harness,</p>
<p>to do the thing you want to do in the world.</p>
<p>Finding your way to make the world better.</p>
<p>And it can have nothing to do with climate,</p>
<p>but if it makes a few more people&rsquo;s lives better,</p>
<p>then overall you&rsquo;re leading toward</p>
<p>better capacity for all this stuff.</p>
<p>So that, and then the climate problem,</p>
<p>the prismatic giant nature of it</p>
<p>is what makes it so daunting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also what gives everybody an opportunity.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something for artists, scientists, poets,</p>
<p>everybody needs to get into the game.</p>
<p>I just spent some time with Kim Stanley Robinson</p>
<p>who wrote that book, Ministry of the Future,</p>
<p>which is this sprawling novel about a worst case outcome</p>
<p>where everyone in India is dying.</p>
<p>So fiction can help experiment,</p>
<p>different kinds of fiction, different kinds of arts</p>
<p>can help us sort of experiment</p>
<p>with what the future might look like in different ways.</p>
<p>And just get started.</p>
<p>And the other thing, unfortunately, that&rsquo;s needed</p>
<p>I think I first said this in 2008</p>
<p>when someone asked me something about climate.</p>
<p>I said, weirdly, you have to sort of have a sense of urgency</p>
<p>but a sense of patience at the same time.</p>
<p>Like, just roll those words around in your mind.</p>
<p>Like, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Urgent and patient.</p>
<p>How could that possibly be?</p>
<p>But actually it really is the reality.</p>
<p>There is an urgency with this building gas</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cumulative, that doesn&rsquo;t go away</p>
<p>like smoke when it rains.</p>
<p>And every year that happens, it&rsquo;s adding to risk.</p>
<p>And you can kind of wake up completely freaked out urgent</p>
<p>but when you realize energy transitions take time</p>
<p>then you have to sort of find patience</p>
<p>or whatever your word is for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you have to oscillate back and forth</p>
<p>throughout the day, having a sense of urgency</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to actually be productive</p>
<p>and have patience so you can have a calm head about you</p>
<p>in terms of putting everything into perspective.</p>
<p>And like you said, with information,</p>
<p>that is interesting,</p>
<p>especially in the scientific community.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve spoken about this before.</p>
<p>You know, that there is some responsibility</p>
<p>or at least an opportunity for scientists</p>
<p>to not just do science but to understand the dynamics</p>
<p>of the different mediums in which information is exchanged.</p>
<p>So it could be Twitter for a few years,</p>
<p>then it could be TikTok, then it could be,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m a huge believer in the power of YouTube.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, perhaps decades,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very interesting medium for education</p>
<p>and communication and for debate and that&rsquo;s grassroots.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from like the bottom up, you know,</p>
<p>that every scientist is able to communicate their work.</p>
<p>And I personally believe have the responsibility</p>
<p>to communicate their work.</p>
<p>If anything, the internet made me realize</p>
<p>that science is not just about doing the science,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about communicating it.</p>
<p>Like this is not some kind of virtue signaling on my part.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>No, like I feel like if the tree falls in the forest</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s around to hear it, it really didn&rsquo;t fall.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not, there should be a culture of,</p>
<p>well, at MIT, there&rsquo;s a place called the Media Lab.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Where they really emphasize,</p>
<p>like you always be able to demo something</p>
<p>to show off your work.</p>
<p>They really emphasize showing off their work.</p>
<p>And I think that was in some part criticized</p>
<p>in the bigger MIT culture that, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like focusing too much on the PR</p>
<p>versus doing the science.</p>
<p>But I really disagree with that.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a balance to strike.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be all smoke and mirrors,</p>
<p>but there really is a lot of value to communication</p>
<p>and not just sort of some broad.</p>
<p>You almost don&rsquo;t want to teach a course on communication</p>
<p>because by the time you teach the course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already too late.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always being on top of how,</p>
<p>what is the language?</p>
<p>What is the culture and the etiquette?</p>
<p>What is the technology of communication that is effective?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I actually had a big conversation about that in my university</p>
<p>because I think, and this is perhaps especially true</p>
<p>for social sciences,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s probably true for everyone,</p>
<p>just simply communicating what it is that you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>in research makes it possible for you</p>
<p>to sort of get an outsider&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>and see, did I just go into an incredibly deep hole</p>
<p>that just three other people really care about in the world?</p>
<p>Or is this actually something that matters to the world?</p>
<p>And being able to explain what it is that you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>to everyone else makes, you know,</p>
<p>my sort of sense is if you can&rsquo;t say it</p>
<p>in a couple of minutes, it&rsquo;s probably,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily true,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably because it wasn&rsquo;t all that important.</p>
<p>There was a hashtag generated maybe seven years ago</p>
<p>by a Caltech PhD candidate woman, and it was fantastic.</p>
<p>The hashtag was, I am a scientist because,</p>
<p>and she posted it with a picture of herself</p>
<p>with her answer, you know?</p>
<p>And that, when I talk to scientists</p>
<p>or basically anybody about communicating,</p>
<p>I say don&rsquo;t start with, I am a phytologist,</p>
<p>and I use a spectrophotometer to do X.</p>
<p>Start with, I am a scientist</p>
<p>because the world is endlessly interesting,</p>
<p>and I just found these salamanders,</p>
<p>which are gonna vanish if we don&rsquo;t stop this fungus</p>
<p>from coming to the United States, utterly interesting.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got people hooked.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the motivation part,</p>
<p>because everyone grew up as a kid,</p>
<p>and a kid is basically like a scientist.</p>
<p>Wow, what the hell is this?</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p>So you can connect with people that way.</p>
<p>But this other issue you broached is really important.</p>
<p>And what I love about MIT particularly,</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time there over the decades,</p>
<p>not just talking to the hurricane guy,</p>
<p>Amy Smith, who has the development lab</p>
<p>in the basement there somewhere.</p>
<p>Most of MIT looks like it&rsquo;s the basement,</p>
<p>but yes, it&rsquo;s part of the charm.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the usability function</p>
<p>is part of a lot of that goes on there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s engineering and science.</p>
<p>It reminds me, in 1997,</p>
<p>these two very different scientists,</p>
<p>Dan Kamen at Berkeley and Michael Dove at Yale,</p>
<p>wrote a manifesto.</p>
<p>It was The Virtues of Mundane Science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they called it.</p>
<p>It was a prod to the scientific community.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s about useful, utility.</p>
<p>Because the whole arena is set up to advance your career</p>
<p>through revealing new knowledge</p>
<p>that will get you tenure someday.</p>
<p>Actually doing useful science is disincentivized.</p>
<p>Having a conversation,</p>
<p>especially if it involves more than one discipline.</p>
<p>Because as a young scientist,</p>
<p>there were some postdocs at Columbia</p>
<p>who wrote this other manifesto paper saying,</p>
<p>here are the things universities need to do</p>
<p>to foster the collaborative capacity we need</p>
<p>to have sustainable development.</p>
<p>And it was like four or five things</p>
<p>that universities don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Give you time to become fluent in,</p>
<p>for a physicist to talk to an anthropologist</p>
<p>and understand how anthropology works with sociology,</p>
<p>takes time.</p>
<p>And then building a relationship with a community</p>
<p>that has a problem that you want to fix takes time.</p>
<p>And so you do these quick turnaround papers</p>
<p>that get you toward your little micro career goal,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not actually getting you</p>
<p>what you want in the world.</p>
<p>Those are really hard problems going forward.</p>
<p>But starting with that idea of usability,</p>
<p>what can I do with my skill sets?</p>
<p>You know, a lot of great physicists I know</p>
<p>are dug in on string theory and stuff.</p>
<p>And someone has to dig in on that too,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d like to have them pull a little bit</p>
<p>of their brainpower away to think about</p>
<p>some of the practical things Bjorn thinks about too.</p>
<p>So the two of you have been thinking</p>
<p>about some of the biggest questions,</p>
<p>which is life here on Earth.</p>
<p>The history of life here,</p>
<p>the future of life here on Earth.</p>
<p>The existence of Earth itself.</p>
<p>And how to allocate our resources</p>
<p>to alleviate suffering in the world.</p>
<p>So let me ask the big question.</p>
<p>What do you think is the why of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of our life here on Earth?</p>
<p>You waited till the last moment to ask us that question.</p>
<p>Yes, in case there&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>In case I can trick you into finding an answer.</p>
<p>Well, so, I mean, again, I&rsquo;m just gonna take a stab</p>
<p>in this because I think in some ways</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing that you were talking about before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about getting everybody sort of in the same track</p>
<p>and all agree on something,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about getting a lot of people</p>
<p>with very different goals and targets</p>
<p>and ways of thinking about the world</p>
<p>to go in the same direction.</p>
<p>So for me, the goal of life, certainly my goal,</p>
<p>but I think for most people,</p>
<p>is to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>It sounds incredibly pedestrian</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s become so overused,</p>
<p>but that really and literally is the point.</p>
<p>Your point of your life is to,</p>
<p>when one of your friends is sad,</p>
<p>to make sure that they sort of get out of that</p>
<p>and find out why they&rsquo;re sad</p>
<p>and maybe move them a little bit in the right direction.</p>
<p>And all the things that we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>stop people from dying from tuberculosis</p>
<p>and live longer lives and fix climate change,</p>
<p>but fix it in such a way</p>
<p>that we actually use resources smartest</p>
<p>because there are lots of problems.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s make sure we deal with them adequately.</p>
<p>This is very unsexy in some sense,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s also very basic and really what matters.</p>
<p>Well, you know, biologically evolution has demanded</p>
<p>that life is about finding sources of energy</p>
<p>and perpetuating yourself, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the baseline.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s led us into a bit of a bollocks</p>
<p>because we have this easy energy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s come from the ground so far,</p>
<p>but our brilliance has given this larger awareness</p>
<p>of everything about the planet is transitory.</p>
<p>And so how do you work with that productively</p>
<p>is really an important question.</p>
<p>I could just sort of, you know,</p>
<p>try to be as rich as possible</p>
<p>and use as much energy as possible</p>
<p>and have other people.</p>
<p>I mean, Alex Epstein, I think, again,</p>
<p>this is one of the constraints on my support</p>
<p>for what he says is he&rsquo;s just talking about growth</p>
<p>and progress in that sense,</p>
<p>but there are consequences</p>
<p>and there are long-term trajectories here</p>
<p>that have to be taken into account too.</p>
<p>So what do you wake up to do?</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s finding your part of this.</p>
<p>And as Bjorn said,</p>
<p>finding a way to pursue and expand betterment.</p>
<p>When I taught, I was at Pace University for six years</p>
<p>and one of the courses I launched there</p>
<p>was called blogging a better planet.</p>
<p>And it was for grad students, mostly in communication.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an environment, it wasn&rsquo;t like better planet,</p>
<p>save the climate.</p>
<p>But my task for the students was to blog</p>
<p>about something they&rsquo;re passionate about, first of all,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>just like you can&rsquo;t do your conversations</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t wake up in the morning</p>
<p>wanting to do what you&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>I used to call myself a selfish blogger</p>
<p>because I was learning every day.</p>
<p>I still am.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>My wife laughs, she thinks I work too much,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m always asking those questions, like sustain what?</p>
<p>So my charge to the students was harness a passion,</p>
<p>build a blog, either alone or with others,</p>
<p>that notches the world a little bit</p>
<p>towards some better outcome.</p>
<p>And so there was a musician who did a thing on music,</p>
<p>musicians who use their art for their work</p>
<p>for making the world better.</p>
<p>Some of it was like music therapy,</p>
<p>bands contributing money, whatever.</p>
<p>Another one did, her blog was on comfort food</p>
<p>all around the world.</p>
<p>And I thought it was my favorite, it was a video.</p>
<p>See, I think it should be viral, actually.</p>
<p>It was like looking at the world,</p>
<p>every different cultures, she was in Queens,</p>
<p>so every culture, every cuisine is there in Queens,</p>
<p>200 countries, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But she would go and talk to people&rsquo;s moms</p>
<p>and have them cook the food of that country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s their comfort food.</p>
<p>I mean, I just love this</p>
<p>because we all need to eat</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting this expanded sense of what comfort is</p>
<p>by thinking about what other cultures choose.</p>
<p>And that felt like a great course</p>
<p>because it was not directive,</p>
<p>it was just, it gave them this potential to go forward.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;d love to think they&rsquo;ve all gone on</p>
<p>to become a superstar, whatever it is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the giving, that&rsquo;s the letting go part.</p>
<p>Even if one did something special,</p>
<p>then that makes me feel job done.</p>
<p>And, you know, after I&rsquo;d been writing about climate</p>
<p>for 30 years, 2016-ish, I did a lot of writing</p>
<p>about what did I learn, unlearned and stuff.</p>
<p>And I had had a stroke in 2011, which was interesting.</p>
<p>It was the first time I really thought about my brain.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t think about your brain</p>
<p>on a day-to-day basis, but this is my brain telling me,</p>
<p>you know, ding, ding, ding, ding,</p>
<p>some weird shit&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And when I was thinking about climate</p>
<p>or confronting climate change,</p>
<p>it felt like some of the things I learned</p>
<p>about my own existence, you know, I&rsquo;m gonna die,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really absorb that.</p>
<p>Is that the first time you kind of faced your mortality?</p>
<p>That was like my first, like, yeah,</p>
<p>this is really the shit, you know,</p>
<p>or at least deep disability, if not death,</p>
<p>and that ability is transitory.</p>
<p>And I thought about the climate problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna solve the global warming problem,</p>
<p>at least not in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>But you work on making those trajectories sustainable,</p>
<p>you know, the end of life particularly.</p>
<p>You work on making sure other people don&rsquo;t get strokes</p>
<p>if they can avoid it.</p>
<p>In my case, I wrote about it.</p>
<p>I was blogging about my stroke while I was having it.</p>
<p>I was tweeting about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a funny tweet that&rsquo;s kind of mistyped</p>
<p>because, you know, things weren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Co-PP?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like share your knowledge, share your learning.</p>
<p>And everyone can do this now, like on whatever platform.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also this like giving up part,</p>
<p>but not in a depressing,</p>
<p>well, maybe you could call it depressing.</p>
<p>I started to Zoom in years ago</p>
<p>on the idea of the serenity prayer, the sobriety thing.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like know what you can change,</p>
<p>know what you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Grant me the serenity to accept the things</p>
<p>that cannot change, the courage to change the things</p>
<p>that can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, those three properties</p>
<p>are really important right now.</p>
<p>Some aspects of this, we know absolutely</p>
<p>what we can work on.</p>
<p>Cutting vulnerability.</p>
<p>Energy transitions take time.</p>
<p>Science can help us discriminate the difference.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an iterative changing landscape going forward.</p>
<p>But at the same time, science,</p>
<p>like I personally on climate modeling,</p>
<p>or like narrowing how hot it&rsquo;s gonna get,</p>
<p>or more clarity on when an ice sheet is gonna collapse.</p>
<p>I think those are what I call known unknowables.</p>
<p>So being able to, I&rsquo;ve seen enough evidence</p>
<p>that those are deeply complex problems</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not gonna get there quickly.</p>
<p>So then that gives you a landscape to act on.</p>
<p>And that, you know, whether you bring God</p>
<p>into the mix is irrelevant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really know what you can change,</p>
<p>know what you can&rsquo;t, and know what,</p>
<p>that gives you the quality to work on them.</p>
<p>And serenity is comfort with that this is transitory,</p>
<p>that the human journey, like anyone&rsquo;s individual journey,</p>
<p>will have some end.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be near.</p>
<p>This Anthropocene that I&rsquo;ve been writing about</p>
<p>for decades can still be a good Anthropocene,</p>
<p>or at least a less bad one in terms of how we get through it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also a musician.</p>
<p>So in context, one of my favorite songs of yours,</p>
<p>an album, A Very Fine Line, I should mention</p>
<p>that with the stroke coming close to death,</p>
<p>the lyrics here are quite brilliant, I have to say.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very fine line between winning and losing,</p>
<p>a very fine line between living and dying,</p>
<p>a very fine line, by the way, people should listen to this.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t play this because YouTube will give me trouble.</p>
<p>A very fine line between loving and leaving.</p>
<p>Most of your life you spend walking a very fine line,</p>
<p>and the rest of the lyrics are just quite brilliant.</p>
<p>It is a fine line.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you walked it with me today, gentlemen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re brilliant, kind, beautiful human beings.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having this quote-unquote debate</p>
<p>that was much more about just exploring ideas together.</p>
<p>Bjorn, thank you so much.</p>
<p>And Andy, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>You know, these kinds of extended conversations</p>
<p>are the more of it the better.</p>
<p>And finding ways to spread that capacity</p>
<p>just to get people out of this win-lose thing</p>
<p>is really important.</p>
<p>So thanks for what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Bjorn Lomborg and Andrew Refkin.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Henry David Thoreau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
