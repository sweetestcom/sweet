    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Stephen Bunnell,</p>
<p>also known online as Destiny.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a video game streamer and political commentator,</p>
<p>one of the early pioneers of both live streaming in general</p>
<p>and live streamed political debate and discourse.</p>
<p>Politically, he is a progressive,</p>
<p>identifying as either left or far left,</p>
<p>depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>There are many reasons I wanted to talk to Stephen.</p>
<p>First, I just talked to Ben Shapiro,</p>
<p>and many people have told me</p>
<p>that Stephen is the Ben Shapiro of the left</p>
<p>in terms of political perspective</p>
<p>and exceptional debate skills.</p>
<p>Second reason is he skillfully defends</p>
<p>some nuanced, non-standard views,</p>
<p>at the same time being pro-establishment,</p>
<p>pro-institutions, and pro-Biden,</p>
<p>while also being pro-capitalism and pro-free speech.</p>
<p>Third reason is he has been there at the beginning</p>
<p>and throughout the meteoric rise</p>
<p>of the video game live streaming community.</p>
<p>In some mainstream circles,</p>
<p>this community is not taken seriously,</p>
<p>perhaps because of its demographic distribution</p>
<p>skewing young, or perhaps because of the sometimes</p>
<p>harsh style of communication.</p>
<p>But I think this community should be taken seriously</p>
<p>and shown respect.</p>
<p>Millions of young minds tune into live streams</p>
<p>like Destiny&rsquo;s to question and to try to understand</p>
<p>what is going on with the world,</p>
<p>often exploring challenging, even controversial ideas.</p>
<p>The language is sometimes harsher</p>
<p>and the humor sometimes meaner than I would prefer.</p>
<p>But I, Grandpa Lex, put on my rain boots</p>
<p>and went into the beautiful, chaotic muck</p>
<p>of online discourse, and have so far survived</p>
<p>to tell the tale, with a smile</p>
<p>and even more love in my heart than before.</p>
<p>On top of all this, we were lucky to have Molina Gorinson,</p>
<p>a popular streamer and world traveler,</p>
<p>join us at the end of the conversation.</p>
<p>You can check out her channel on twitch.tv slash Molina,</p>
<p>and you can check out Steven&rsquo;s channel</p>
<p>on youtube.com slash Destiny.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got True Classic Tees for shirts,</p>
<p>Athletic Greens for nutrition,</p>
<p>Masterclass for learning, and Blinkist for nonfiction.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, there&rsquo;s no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by a thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m currently wearing as I&rsquo;m doing this very ad read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called True Classic Tees.</p>
<p>High quality, soft, slim-fitted t-shirts for men.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re definitely slim-fitted currently</p>
<p>because I just ate a lot and I drank two cappuccinos,</p>
<p>venti cappuccinos from Starbucks</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t sleep much last night</p>
<p>and I had a lot to get done today</p>
<p>and so I was feeling really good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still feeling really good</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m celebrating that by even more caffeine.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re definitely slim-fitted, extra slim-fitted.</p>
<p>I wear large and they feel good, they look good.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing better in this world</p>
<p>than a great-fitting, comfortable, sexy t-shirt.</p>
<p>Okay, there might be a couple of other things</p>
<p>but a t-shirt is pretty nice.</p>
<p>And so, I wear a suit and tie</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m trying to do a thing</p>
<p>that I want to take super seriously.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wear a dress shirt when it&rsquo;s more relaxed</p>
<p>but still, I&rsquo;m taking it pretty seriously</p>
<p>and the go-to is a t-shirt, t-shirt and jeans.</p>
<p>My favorite t-shirts, the ones I go with, black,</p>
<p>is called True Classic Tees.</p>
<p>Like I said, go to trueclassic.com</p>
<p>and enter code Lex to get 25% off.</p>
<p>Free shipping included on purchases over 100 bucks,</p>
<p>100% risk-free guarantee with a 30-day return policy.</p>
<p>True Classic, when you look good, you feel good.</p>
<p>I had to read that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t tell me to read that</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what it says on their website.</p>
<p>So, when you look good, you feel good.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s AG1 drink that I drink twice a day.</p>
<p>It takes care of all my nutritional needs</p>
<p>for all the crazy fasting, keto diet,</p>
<p>carnivore diet, whatever diet I do.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m traveling, if I&rsquo;m stressed,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m sleep-deprived, all the chaos that&rsquo;s going on in life.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m not complaining.</p>
<p>Chaos in life is beautiful.</p>
<p>But I try to do anything I can that&rsquo;s easy to do</p>
<p>to take care of my body.</p>
<p>I do try to get sleep.</p>
<p>I do try to make sure I have a bed</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m super comfortable with.</p>
<p>I try to make sure I get enough electrolytes,</p>
<p>enough vitamins.</p>
<p>The vitamin part is taken care of by Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s delicious.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a zen aspect of just slowing down life</p>
<p>and enjoying a nice drink of Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>It just puts me back to a place</p>
<p>where all the stress of life disappears</p>
<p>and I return to a place of calm.</p>
<p>Anyway, they&rsquo;ll give you one month&rsquo;s supply of fish oil</p>
<p>when you sign up at athleticgreens.com slash flex.</p>
<p>These reads are getting increasingly more ridiculous</p>
<p>and I love it.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Masterclass.</p>
<p>$180 a year gets you an all-access pass</p>
<p>to watch courses from the best people in the world</p>
<p>at the coolest stuff in the world.</p>
<p>So we got Chris Hadfield.</p>
<p>I mean, the list is ridiculous.</p>
<p>I hope to talk to a bunch of them on the podcast.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll never be able to have such a dense</p>
<p>and sexy presentation of their insights on a podcast</p>
<p>as Masterclass achieves in these classes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just not comparable.</p>
<p>A podcast is a fun chat.</p>
<p>This is an intense, also fun, educational experience.</p>
<p>So Chris Hadfield, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Will Wright,</p>
<p>Carlos Santana, Garry Kasparov, Daniel Negrano,</p>
<p>Neil Gaiman, Martin Scorsese, Tony Hawk, Jane Good,</p>
<p>it just goes on and on.</p>
<p>It never stops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really, really worth it.</p>
<p>I recommend it.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>Get unlimited access to every Masterclass</p>
<p>and get 15% off an annual membership</p>
<p>at masterclass.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Blinkist,</p>
<p>my favorite app for learning new things.</p>
<p>They take key ideas from thousands of nonfiction books</p>
<p>and condense them down into 15 minutes</p>
<p>that you can read or listen to.</p>
<p>And sometimes the new things I learn</p>
<p>are from books I&rsquo;ve already read,</p>
<p>sometimes multiple times.</p>
<p>The insights they pull out really take a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>Not in all cases, but in many cases,</p>
<p>a fresh perspective on books I&rsquo;ve already read.</p>
<p>Obviously, if I haven&rsquo;t read the book,</p>
<p>this is a great way to pick which nonfiction books</p>
<p>you should read.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re never gonna get a chance to read those books,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nice way to get caught up</p>
<p>in case it&rsquo;s brought up in conversation</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not completely lost out at sea.</p>
<p>Like a lonely sailor wishing he could be home with family.</p>
<p>This is your way.</p>
<p>This is the way to return back to family.</p>
<p>Come along with me, dear sailor.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Destiny.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you watched me watching your yay interview.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so curious,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re navigating a conversation like that,</p>
<p>are you, how intentional is the thought process</p>
<p>between like building rapport and pushing</p>
<p>and giving a little and letting like-</p>
<p>Zero, zero intention.</p>
<p>I was watching and thank you so much.</p>
<p>It was very kind for you to review that conversation.</p>
<p>It meant a lot that you were complimentary in parts</p>
<p>on the technical aspects of the conversation,</p>
<p>but no, zero.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m actually deliberately trying to avoid,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve called it debate brain,</p>
<p>which is just another flavor of thinking about</p>
<p>the meta conversation, trying to optimize</p>
<p>how should this conversation go?</p>
<p>Because I feel like the more you do that,</p>
<p>the better you get at that,</p>
<p>the less human connection you have.</p>
<p>Like the less genuinely you&rsquo;re actually sitting there</p>
<p>in the moment and listening to the person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more like calculating what&rsquo;s the right thing to say</p>
<p>versus like feeling what is that person feeling right now?</p>
<p>What are they thinking?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to do is like putting myself</p>
<p>in their mind and thinking,</p>
<p>what does the world look like to them?</p>
<p>What does the world feel like to them?</p>
<p>And so from that, I truly try to listen.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m also learning, especially because Rogan</p>
<p>and others have been giving me shit for not pushing back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good sometimes to say from a place of care</p>
<p>for the other human being to say, stop.</p>
<p>What did you just say?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that represents who you are</p>
<p>and what you really mean.</p>
<p>Or maybe if it does at that time represents who they are,</p>
<p>I could see a better world</p>
<p>if they grow into a different direction</p>
<p>and try to point that direction out to them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really complicated dance</p>
<p>between letting somebody share their full story</p>
<p>versus letting somebody like essentially,</p>
<p>I guess like proselytize your audience.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay, hold on, let&rsquo;s take a minute here.</p>
<p>But yeah, I used to be four or five years ago,</p>
<p>it was attack, attack, attack, attack, attack,</p>
<p>whatever you said.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m leaning way more towards the like, okay,</p>
<p>well, tell me how you feel about everything</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll go from there.</p>
<p>So a lot of people like my new approach.</p>
<p>Some older fans will watch and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>why are you letting this guy just ramble on?</p>
<p>You know, he said like five or six wrong things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re only gonna call him out on two of them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just different styles of conversation.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>Do you do a lot of research beforehand too?</p>
<p>Depending on the conversation, yeah.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re gonna talk like vaccines and stuff,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s a ton of reading and stuff</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d never thought I&rsquo;d know going into it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a more personal,</p>
<p>like political philosophy conversation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not as much you can prepare for just,</p>
<p>it truly depends on the conversation.</p>
<p>How much are you actually listening to the other person?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always listening, you have to listen.</p>
<p>Because as soon as you stop listening,</p>
<p>the quality of everything falls apart.</p>
<p>The connection disappears,</p>
<p>the quality of the conversation disappears.</p>
<p>But my natural inclination is to just be</p>
<p>way more aggressive than normal.</p>
<p>So I have to constantly remind myself,</p>
<p>I guess you would call it a meta conversation.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re like, okay,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably saying this because of that</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll let him go here and then we&rsquo;ll stop later.</p>
<p>But yeah, because my preferred style of conversation</p>
<p>is like, I&rsquo;m gonna talk</p>
<p>and the second I say something you disagree with,</p>
<p>then let&rsquo;s iron it out, right?</p>
<p>I got like, I think in like syllogisms,</p>
<p>like, okay, here&rsquo;s premise A, good, okay.</p>
<p>Premise B, okay, and then conclusion.</p>
<p>And then as long as we&rsquo;re both deductively sound,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not crazy, no psychosis,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re gonna agree on everything.</p>
<p>Whereas other people like to,</p>
<p>most people think in stories, like narratives,</p>
<p>like a whole, there&rsquo;s a whole like narrative</p>
<p>and the individual facts don&rsquo;t matter as much</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll pick and choose what they want.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really hard because everybody thinks narrative</p>
<p>so I have to function in that world.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s frustrating for me sometimes.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve seen, you&rsquo;ve had a lot of excellent debates.</p>
<p>One of them I just recently last night watched</p>
<p>is on systemic racism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen you</p>
<p>completely lose your shit.</p>
<p>Oh, shoot, who was that against?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly, but you were just very frustrated.</p>
<p>Sorry, not lose your shit, but you&rsquo;re frustrated constantly</p>
<p>because of the thing, let&rsquo;s lay out one, two, three.</p>
<p>And every time you try to lay it out, it would falter.</p>
<p>I think it had to do with sort of,</p>
<p>can you use data to make an argument</p>
<p>or do you need to use a study</p>
<p>that does an interpretation of that data?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like this tension between,</p>
<p>I think this is a behavioral economist</p>
<p>that you were talking to.</p>
<p>You do this kind of nice layout</p>
<p>that the whole point of behavioral economics</p>
<p>is says there&rsquo;s more to it than just the data.</p>
<p>You have to give a context</p>
<p>and do the rich, rigorous interpretation</p>
<p>in the context of the full human story.</p>
<p>And then there was like a dance back and forth.</p>
<p>Sometimes you use data, sometimes not,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting really frustrated and shutting down.</p>
<p>And so that felt like a failure mode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Sam Harris have similar sticking points.</p>
<p>Like if we can&rsquo;t agree on the terminology, we can&rsquo;t go on.</p>
<p>To me, I feel like sort of the Wittgenstein perspective</p>
<p>is like, I think if you get stuck on any one thing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just not gonna make progress.</p>
<p>You have to, part of the conversation has to be</p>
<p>about doing a good dance together</p>
<p>versus being dogmatically stuck on the path to truth.</p>
<p>I think the true challenge is identifying</p>
<p>what of those sticking points are important</p>
<p>versus what is not important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if I&rsquo;m having an argument with somebody</p>
<p>about like Jewish representation in media,</p>
<p>they might, it might be like a big conversation</p>
<p>and they might say a couple things.</p>
<p>Like I think Jewish people, you know,</p>
<p>they tend to help their own or whatever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>But like for the purpose of the conversation,</p>
<p>we can keep moving.</p>
<p>But if they casually drop like, you know, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why the Holocaust numbers</p>
<p>are blown up from like 100,000 to 6 million.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, and it&rsquo;s like, okay, well, hold on.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, if you think this, we have to stop here</p>
<p>because this is gonna be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a language game in this part.</p>
<p>If you really believe this fact,</p>
<p>then the whole rest of the conversation</p>
<p>is gonna be informed by that belief, you know?</p>
<p>And it has to be something</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t bother you personally.</p>
<p>You have to step outside your own ego.</p>
<p>So Holocaust denial is somebody</p>
<p>that would bother a lot of people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some things, just observing you,</p>
<p>I feel like when you get really good at conversation,</p>
<p>you can become a stickler to,</p>
<p>you might have your favorite terms</p>
<p>that really bothers you</p>
<p>if people don&rsquo;t agree on those terms.</p>
<p>Begs the question.</p>
<p>You mean raising the question.</p>
<p>Yeah, I usually just want,</p>
<p>if people say stuff, I just let it slide, yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because if you fight,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re having a conversation with somebody</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re talking to their audience at the same time,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>you never want to come off as overcombative</p>
<p>or overaggressive because it puts people in like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a trigger in your brain.</p>
<p>And this is true of relationships or friendships</p>
<p>of persuasive rhetoric or whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a trigger in the brain.</p>
<p>And as soon as that defensive trigger gets like flipped on,</p>
<p>everything is over.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lost the ability to persuade</p>
<p>because everything becomes a fight at that point, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I wanted to talk to you</p>
<p>because I heard somewhere that you were referred to</p>
<p>as the Ben Shapiro of the left.</p>
<p>And since I&rsquo;m talking with Ben as well,</p>
<p>I wanted to sort of complete spiritually</p>
<p>this platonic political philosophy puzzle in my head.</p>
<p>You are a progressive,</p>
<p>but a progressive with many nonstandard progressive views.</p>
<p>And you had a heck of a fascinating journey</p>
<p>through all of that.</p>
<p>And like I said, I think you argue with passion sometimes</p>
<p>with excessive amounts of passion.</p>
<p>But almost-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really polite way of saying that.</p>
<p>Almost always with good faith</p>
<p>and with rigor, with seriousness.</p>
<p>I asked on your subreddit, which is an excellent subreddit.</p>
<p>Shout out to the Destiny subreddit so much,</p>
<p>at least for that particular post.</p>
<p>What I really loved is when I asked for questions for you,</p>
<p>they were like, holy shit, there&rsquo;s adults in there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all behave.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, nobody say incest.</p>
<p>I was like, what, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>But actually the questions that rose to the top</p>
<p>were really good.</p>
<p>So somebody said that Destiny was,</p>
<p>speaking of your journey,</p>
<p>was a conservative in his early teens.</p>
<p>Then he became a libertarian.</p>
<p>Then he became a left-wing social justice warrior.</p>
<p>Then he flirted with socialism.</p>
<p>And now he is a social democrat liberal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also heard you refer to yourself as a far left person.</p>
<p>So to the degree that is true to that journey,</p>
<p>can you take me through your evolution</p>
<p>through the landscape of political ideologies</p>
<p>that you went through?</p>
<p>So my dad comes from Kentucky</p>
<p>and my mom is a Cuban immigrant.</p>
<p>Cubans are notorious for being very conservative</p>
<p>in the United States for historical reasons</p>
<p>and for other reasons.</p>
<p>But my upbringing was a very Republican one.</p>
<p>I grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck,</p>
<p>Michael Savage, on the radio, Billy Cunningham.</p>
<p>I think Sean Hannity a little bit later on,</p>
<p>but that was my whole upbringing politically.</p>
<p>I remember I was writing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d written articles for the school journal</p>
<p>in favor of defending the war in Iraq</p>
<p>and defending Bush from all the criticism, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that was my upbringing.</p>
<p>I think once I hit high school, college,</p>
<p>I had my edgy libertarian-esque high school phase</p>
<p>of reading Ayn Rand, of figuring out that,</p>
<p>oh my God, nothing in life matters</p>
<p>except for class and money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually the answer to everything.</p>
<p>And I got to college.</p>
<p>I became a Ron Paul fan, very big Ron Paul fan.</p>
<p>And then from there, I kind of work, do life.</p>
<p>Life happens.</p>
<p>At kind of the lowest point of my life</p>
<p>in terms of where I&rsquo;m working financially,</p>
<p>everything is kind of in ruin in my life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a whole bunch of dumb stuff that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Probably my most conservative point,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is about being poor</p>
<p>and thinking you can work your way out of it,</p>
<p>you can do whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just my upbringing is always just like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not having financial success,</p>
<p>just work, work, work, work, work.</p>
<p>And then I got into streaming.</p>
<p>Very, very lucky break.</p>
<p>Everything just lined up at the right time.</p>
<p>And then as I&rsquo;ve progressed through streaming,</p>
<p>I would say through the years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gradually fallen more and more to the left,</p>
<p>especially once my kid turned four, five, six years old.</p>
<p>And I started to see how much different his life was</p>
<p>just because of the financial opportunities</p>
<p>that I was able to provide for him</p>
<p>through no merit of his own.</p>
<p>And that started to radically change</p>
<p>how I viewed the world in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>So actually, let&rsquo;s linger on that low point.</p>
<p>You worked at McDonald&rsquo;s, you worked at a casino,</p>
<p>you did carpet cleaning.</p>
<p>What was the lowest point?</p>
<p>Definitely the carpet cleaning.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Why was it the lowest point?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you were just flirting with starting streaming?</p>
<p>My whole life has been a series of lucky breaks,</p>
<p>really, truly.</p>
<p>I grew up playing a lot of video games,</p>
<p>but back in my day, our day, you had to read.</p>
<p>There was a lot of text on the screen.</p>
<p>Back in my day, we used to play-</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t all talk to you.</p>
<p>Yeah, because nowadays everything&rsquo;s voice acted,</p>
<p>but back then you had to read a lot.</p>
<p>I was a really good reader and a really good vocabulary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard you actually say that.</p>
<p>What games are we talking about?</p>
<p>What do you mean just reading?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about like RPGs?</p>
<p>Yeah, JRPGs.</p>
<p>So like Final Fantasy games, Phantasy Stars,</p>
<p>like any RPG that would have been</p>
<p>on the SNES, Sega, PlayStation.</p>
<p>These are the things that I&rsquo;m-</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pause on that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I just talked to Todd Howard,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s of the Elder Scrolls fame</p>
<p>and the Fallout fame and beyond.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your thoughts on Elder Scrolls?</p>
<p>Why is Skyrim the greatest RPG of all time?</p>
<p>Man, I really don&rsquo;t like Skyrim or Fallout.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t love it?</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>Why do you hate Skyrim?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I really like characters</p>
<p>and like compelling stories</p>
<p>and narrators around those characters.</p>
<p>And I like to see them kind of like grow and change,</p>
<p>kind of like a movie or a story.</p>
<p>So in your like Final Fantasy games, you&rsquo;ve got characters.</p>
<p>There are a lot of like classical tropes</p>
<p>of like a character starts off kind of like edgy, angsty,</p>
<p>all on their own.</p>
<p>They develop relationships, friendships.</p>
<p>They realize that the life is more about themselves</p>
<p>and they do that.</p>
<p>So I like that growth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what you see</p>
<p>in all of those old role-playing games.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the open world ones as much</p>
<p>because your main character is just like a blank slate,</p>
<p>never talks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for you to like project onto,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not the same like linear narrative</p>
<p>of like growth for the character.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an actual story arc to the character</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more crafted in a beautiful way</p>
<p>by the designers of the game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think one is better or worse.</p>
<p>I tend towards like, I want to hear a compelling story</p>
<p>around like a set of characters</p>
<p>that like grow and change as the game goes on.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s beautifully put then.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just really loved being able to leave the town.</p>
<p>You go outside the town and you look outside,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nature and the world of possibilities is before you.</p>
<p>You can do whatever the fuck you want.</p>
<p>I mean, that immensity of just being lost in the world</p>
<p>is really immersive for me.</p>
<p>But yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Whatever attracts you about a world.</p>
<p>So you were just starting to play video games.</p>
<p>You grew up playing video games.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of your lucky breaks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just like a lot of random skills you pick up</p>
<p>depending on the type of game you play.</p>
<p>I played a lot of text-based games on the computer.</p>
<p>So I was a very fast typer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a very fast typer.</p>
<p>Read a lot, learned weird kind of math stuff</p>
<p>for some of the calculations, some of the games.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m pretty good at getting information,</p>
<p>figuring stuff out, learning patterns, all of that.</p>
<p>And then that plus the reading</p>
<p>and everything with the games meant that I,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say I excelled in school</p>
<p>because my grades were pretty bad,</p>
<p>but I was in like all honors, all AP classes or whatever.</p>
<p>A lot of dual enrollment,</p>
<p>a lot of AP credit going into college.</p>
<p>So I did pretty well in school,</p>
<p>probably better than I should have,</p>
<p>but it was because I had the game stuff</p>
<p>that was like really powering a lot of my brain there</p>
<p>while I was trying to sleep through class.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to soak in information,</p>
<p>integrate it, quickly take notes.</p>
<p>Generally, I think I&rsquo;m pretty good at that, yeah.</p>
<p>You do this a lot when you stream, you&rsquo;re typing stuff.</p>
<p>Is there a system in that note-taking?</p>
<p>And what note, what do you use for note-taking?</p>
<p>Does it matter?</p>
<p>I use a notepad.</p>
<p>Like notepad.exe notepad?</p>
<p>Yep, notepad.exe, not the plus plus, not.</p>
<p>Is there genius to the madness behind that,</p>
<p>or you just don&rsquo;t give a shit?</p>
<p>No, I mean like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna depend on the style of conversation.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m with somebody</p>
<p>that is very meticulously organized their thoughts,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re a, find a better word here for rambler,</p>
<p>you can edit that in, better word for rambler,</p>
<p>somebody that talks a lot and a lot,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start like taking notes, bullet points,</p>
<p>like this, this, this, this, this, this, this,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a style of conversation</p>
<p>where I say seven or eight different things,</p>
<p>and then when you go to respond to everything I said,</p>
<p>I cut you off immediately, and we argue that point.</p>
<p>But if somebody&rsquo;s gonna do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like, hold on,</p>
<p>you just said these eight things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna respond to every single one,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written them all down,</p>
<p>and then you can go,</p>
<p>if you wanna go point by point, we can,</p>
<p>but you just said all this, and I wrote it down,</p>
<p>so now we&rsquo;re gonna go.</p>
<p>So what are you actually writing down,</p>
<p>like a couple of words per point they left?</p>
<p>Honestly, like,</p>
<p>there are very few unique conversations in politics,</p>
<p>like a lot of them are kind of retreading old ground.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re having a debate on abortion,</p>
<p>somebody might say like,</p>
<p>oh, well I believe this thing about viability,</p>
<p>and I believe this thing about, you know,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re a fetus versus a human,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just write down like those points,</p>
<p>so that when I go to respond,</p>
<p>I kind of have like a, like note cards,</p>
<p>like a guiding thing there</p>
<p>to keep me centered on my response.</p>
<p>Political discourse is a kind of tree,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re walking down, and I got it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like taking-</p>
<p>Just to keep my focus guided,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not like running off on a weird tangent,</p>
<p>or responding to something I didn&rsquo;t say or something.</p>
<p>What about like doing research?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, is there a system to your note taking?</p>
<p>Because mentally you seem to be</p>
<p>one of the most organized people I&rsquo;ve listened to,</p>
<p>so is there, is it in your mind,</p>
<p>or is there a system that&rsquo;s on paper?</p>
<p>A little of both.</p>
<p>I feel like the human mind is a beautiful thing</p>
<p>if you have interest in an area,</p>
<p>so like what I&rsquo;ll tell people is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s like a totally new topic</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m researching, I don&rsquo;t know anything,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll do a couple of these on stream,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re boring, but people watch it.</p>
<p>I might open a Wikipedia article,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll read, and I hit something I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>and then I open the next Wikipedia article,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll read it, and then I might have like seven tabs open,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll read, and I&rsquo;ll read, and I&rsquo;ll read,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll read a ton of stuff,</p>
<p>maybe for an hour, two, three, four hours of stuff,</p>
<p>and then by the end, you know,</p>
<p>someone in chat will ask me like,</p>
<p>do you even remember like this particular thing?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say, not really, no, not too much.</p>
<p>But what happens is, as long as you&rsquo;ve seen it once,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;ll happen is like the next day, the day after,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll read something else, and we&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>oh, I remember that thing from this thing.</p>
<p>I remember like vaguely that.</p>
<p>And then if you see it like a third time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh, this makes sense,</p>
<p>because especially when it comes to,</p>
<p>oh, here&rsquo;s like a little trick on stuff.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ever reading any news,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a place that pops up,</p>
<p>always look at it on a map,</p>
<p>because so much of history is like on a map.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so important to like know the geography.</p>
<p>It makes things make so much more sense.</p>
<p>But yeah, once I start to see stuff over and over again,</p>
<p>just because I&rsquo;ve like read it a few times,</p>
<p>stuff will start to kind of connect to my mind.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh yeah, well, this makes sense.</p>
<p>Of course, these people believe this, because of this.</p>
<p>Or of course, like this happened here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because, you know, that happened there.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s a lot of that.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s like a topic that I&rsquo;m doing specific research for,</p>
<p>so like vaccine-related stuff is a big one.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian-Russian conflict is a big one.</p>
<p>That, I&rsquo;ll break out a note.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably get like a Google Doc,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just start like writing like an outline</p>
<p>of kind of the rough points of everything,</p>
<p>just to organize my thoughts around different topics, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna go tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll return to the low point of your life at some point.</p>
<p>Always returning from the philosophy to the psychology.</p>
<p>So you did the Ukraine topic.</p>
<p>One question is, what role does US play in this war?</p>
<p>Could they have done something to avoid the war?</p>
<p>Did they have a role to play in forcing Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s hand?</p>
<p>Do they have a role to play in de-escalating the war</p>
<p>towards a peace agreement and the opposite?</p>
<p>If it does escalate towards something like</p>
<p>the use of a tactical nuclear weapon, are they to blame?</p>
<p>Are we to blame?</p>
<p>Oh man, somebody sent me an email a while ago</p>
<p>with great words.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a specific way to navigate a conversation</p>
<p>where you can kind of like contribute to a negative event,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not really the one responsible for it.</p>
<p>Like the classic example is,</p>
<p>a woman goes out late at night,</p>
<p>gets a little bit too drunk, and then something happens.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, while there might&rsquo;ve been steps</p>
<p>she could&rsquo;ve taken to mitigate the risk,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not her fault of what happened</p>
<p>because the responsibility rests on the agent</p>
<p>making the choice, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chooser at some point</p>
<p>that is choosing to do wrong or evil.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in any of the arguments</p>
<p>that say the United States has contributed</p>
<p>to Russia&rsquo;s position on Ukraine</p>
<p>or the actions that they&rsquo;ve taken on Ukraine.</p>
<p>There are several arguments that some people,</p>
<p>some even political scholars are putting out there</p>
<p>to say that the United States is to blame,</p>
<p>but I find them completely unconvincing.</p>
<p>I think that when you ask the question of like,</p>
<p>what is the United States role or what has our role been?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important for us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we even agree as a country</p>
<p>on what our role should be,</p>
<p>which I think is a hard one</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got this kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this growing populist movement in the United States.</p>
<p>It might be the far left and the far right.</p>
<p>And I think populists tend to have this kind of</p>
<p>isolationist view of the world</p>
<p>where the United States should just be our own thing.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be telling anybody what to do.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be the world police.</p>
<p>And then kind of more in these</p>
<p>like center left, center right positions.</p>
<p>And then across a lot of Europe, you&rsquo;ve got, well, okay.</p>
<p>The United States is kind of like the big kid on the block.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re looking to them for guidance and leadership</p>
<p>on situations like what&rsquo;s going on in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So insofar as the original question is like,</p>
<p>what is like the United States responsibility?</p>
<p>I think we have a responsibility to ensure</p>
<p>the relative like freedom,</p>
<p>prosperity and stability across Europe.</p>
<p>I think that defending Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty</p>
<p>and right to their borders is a part of that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe that prior to the invasion in 2022,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the United States was contributing</p>
<p>to Russia invading that country.</p>
<p>I know there are arguments given that like</p>
<p>the expansion of NATO has something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been threatening to Russia,</p>
<p>but the Baltics joined</p>
<p>and Russia didn&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>The invasion to Crimea was very clearly a response</p>
<p>to the revolution in 2014.</p>
<p>The invasion on the borders is clearly a response</p>
<p>to Ukraine winning that civil war in the Southeast</p>
<p>and the Donbass and Russia becoming more aggressive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that you can blame any of that</p>
<p>on NATO expansion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no NATO countries that are threatening Russia</p>
<p>or debating Russia.</p>
<p>Do you think there is a nuclear threat?</p>
<p>Do you think about this?</p>
<p>Do you worry about this,</p>
<p>that there is a threat of a tactical nuclear weapon</p>
<p>being dropped?</p>
<p>I think that possibility exists either way.</p>
<p>And I think the responsibility for that is on Russia</p>
<p>because it just can&rsquo;t be the case that if you have nukes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to invade countries and take their land.</p>
<p>Because if anything, I think that that down the road</p>
<p>also increases the potential for nuclear problems</p>
<p>in the future, right?</p>
<p>Because at that point, either every single country</p>
<p>has to acquire their own nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t, Russia&rsquo;s gonna mess with you,</p>
<p>or every single country has to join NATO.</p>
<p>And now what, we&rsquo;re back at square zero,</p>
<p>ground zero, square one, where people are like,</p>
<p>oh, well, look, all these countries joining NATO</p>
<p>is aggressive towards Russia.</p>
<p>Like, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve mentioned that there&rsquo;s a complicated calculus</p>
<p>going on with the countries that have nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s our responsibility?</p>
<p>Are you allowed to do anything you want</p>
<p>to countries that don&rsquo;t have nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really tricky discussion.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Because what is US supposed to do</p>
<p>if Russia drops a tactical nuclear weapon?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a set of options, none of which are good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a tricky moment right now</p>
<p>because the things that Biden and other public figures say,</p>
<p>I feel like has a significant impact</p>
<p>on the way this game turns out.</p>
<p>Because I think mutually assured destruction</p>
<p>is partially a game of words.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, I believe in the power of conversation,</p>
<p>of leaders talking to each other.</p>
<p>I feel like you have to have a balance</p>
<p>between threat and compromise,</p>
<p>and like empathy for the needs,</p>
<p>the geopolitical, the economic needs of a nation,</p>
<p>but also sort of respect and represent your own interests.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a tricky one.</p>
<p>Like how do you play the hand?</p>
<p>It reminds me of, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever heard</p>
<p>in like evolutionary psych or evolutionary biology,</p>
<p>there are things called tit for tat strategies.</p>
<p>It kind of reminds me of that,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like there are a whole bunch</p>
<p>of these little biological mechanisms</p>
<p>where creatures will develop,</p>
<p>like socializing like tit for tat.</p>
<p>If you do something bad to me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do something bad for you.</p>
<p>And then more complicated schemes will come out</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;ll be like tit, tit for tat,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, you can make one mistake</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna get you if you do a second one,</p>
<p>or it could be tit, tit, tit for tat,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re gonna be tit for tat, tat for tit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like all these like back and forths</p>
<p>where creatures kind of optimize themselves.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think something the United States did really well</p>
<p>in terms of that kind of conversational strategy.</p>
<p>And I approved of this in the beginning</p>
<p>was Biden was very clear about setting out</p>
<p>like the exact level of US involvement for the war.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna do a no fly zone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not gonna be US troops on the ground in Ukraine,</p>
<p>but we are gonna send a whole bunch of money</p>
<p>and a whole bunch of arms and a whole bunch of intel to them.</p>
<p>And I thought he did a good job at laying out</p>
<p>like the limitation of the US involvement</p>
<p>while opening as much as we could</p>
<p>in the ways that we could help.</p>
<p>But yeah, that looming threat</p>
<p>of some sort of tactical nuclear weapon,</p>
<p>I think on the table right now is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be the annihilation</p>
<p>of like Russian sea forces and everything.</p>
<p>But what happens if it continues to escalate?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a world that nobody wants to be in, yeah.</p>
<p>So we talked about difficult conversations.</p>
<p>And again, thank you so much</p>
<p>for reviewing the yay conversation.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about Putin.</p>
<p>Speaking of difficult conversations.</p>
<p>So if you sit down,</p>
<p>if I sit down with somebody like Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>or Vladimir Zelensky,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right way to have that conversation?</p>
<p>We can talk about that one,</p>
<p>or we could talk about somebody more well understood</p>
<p>through history, like Stalin or Hitler,</p>
<p>somebody like that.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s an easier example</p>
<p>to illustrate how to handle</p>
<p>extremely difficult conversations.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I can handle really difficult conversations</p>
<p>between like two people.</p>
<p>Leaders of countries though,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much that you are representing</p>
<p>in that conversation.</p>
<p>I guess the thing that would be interesting to me</p>
<p>would be like, what is Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s interest?</p>
<p>Like what is the genuine interest</p>
<p>that he has in the conflict?</p>
<p>Because I think finding out like,</p>
<p>what is your buy-in or what is your,</p>
<p>like what is the driving force keeping you here</p>
<p>is probably the most important thing.</p>
<p>I think for Zelensky,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s quite a bit more simpler</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s on the defense.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s defending his country and his people.</p>
<p>For Putin, I&rsquo;ve heard all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Dugin has his writings on like the East versus the West,</p>
<p>the collapse of the West in the face</p>
<p>of like all of the liberalism</p>
<p>and the weird LGBT stuff that they criticize.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the desire to like return</p>
<p>to this like former Soviet Union-esque thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got Putin&rsquo;s quotes</p>
<p>that collapse of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>was the biggest geopolitical disaster</p>
<p>of 20th century.</p>
<p>And I guess figuring out like, what is Putin after?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people write about it, but yeah.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of answers to that question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of answers</p>
<p>that he can give to that question.</p>
<p>So say I sit down with him for three hours</p>
<p>and talk about it.</p>
<p>I think this is a really interesting distinction</p>
<p>because you do do difficult conversations</p>
<p>in the space of ideas.</p>
<p>But also in your stream, you have,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a bunch of drama going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a human psychology is laid out</p>
<p>in its full richness before you.</p>
<p>So to me with leaders, I think a part of the conversation</p>
<p>has to be about the human psychology.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Not like a meta conversation,</p>
<p>but like really understand what they feel,</p>
<p>what they fear, who they are as a human being.</p>
<p>Like as a family man,</p>
<p>as a person proud of their country,</p>
<p>as a person with an ego,</p>
<p>as a person who&rsquo;s been affected,</p>
<p>if not corrupted by powers,</p>
<p>all of us can be and likely are.</p>
<p>So all of that, that gives context</p>
<p>to then the answers about what do you want in this war?</p>
<p>Is that the answers about what you want in this war</p>
<p>will be political answers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a game that&rsquo;s being played again with words</p>
<p>and politicians are incredibly good at playing that game.</p>
<p>I think the deeper truth comes from understanding</p>
<p>the human being from which those words come.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you do those kinds of conversations where-</p>
<p>Never talked to any country leader, so.</p>
<p>No, not a country leader,</p>
<p>but say a controversial figure</p>
<p>or somebody that represents a certain idea.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just talk in the space of ideas</p>
<p>or challenge the ideas,</p>
<p>but understand who is this person,</p>
<p>how did you come to those ideas?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, when I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been a couple of very controversial</p>
<p>right-leaning figures.</p>
<p>So the two, obviously the mainstreamers for me</p>
<p>are Lauren Southern and Nick Fuentes.</p>
<p>And those types of conversations</p>
<p>initially aren&rsquo;t very political at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s more like,</p>
<p>obviously we believe in very, very, very different things,</p>
<p>but beliefs don&rsquo;t happen accidentally.</p>
<p>So how did you get to where you are?</p>
<p>Those are way more personal conversations, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Is there things you regret about those conversations</p>
<p>where you failed?</p>
<p>Is there things you&rsquo;re proud of where you succeeded?</p>
<p>For things that I&rsquo;m proud of,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m really good at attempting</p>
<p>to understand people without judgment.</p>
<p>That I think a lot of people feel like</p>
<p>they can have conversations with me</p>
<p>where they can share a lot.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna jump down their throat</p>
<p>for them having a politically incorrect observation,</p>
<p>or for them being judgmental of somebody else,</p>
<p>or having a feeling that&rsquo;s maybe not something</p>
<p>they should have, something they&rsquo;re embarrassed about.</p>
<p>So I think I do a really good job at that.</p>
<p>And then by extension of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten the ability to hear perspectives</p>
<p>from so many different people</p>
<p>that I think I can understand</p>
<p>a lot of different perspectives.</p>
<p>For failures of mine,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s always gonna be on stream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be like, I didn&rsquo;t push back hard enough,</p>
<p>or I didn&rsquo;t know a certain fact for a conversation.</p>
<p>These are usually the,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be on these</p>
<p>very technical grounds generally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the direction</p>
<p>my conversations have gone recently,</p>
<p>especially over the past six months.</p>
<p>So your goal is to de-radicalize</p>
<p>the audience of those folks.</p>
<p>So that used to be my goal.</p>
<p>My goal was de-radicalization.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m kind of hoping that that&rsquo;s just the byproduct.</p>
<p>So the goal, I think, is to talk to somebody</p>
<p>and to show they believe this because of these reasons.</p>
<p>And if you wanna change people&rsquo;s beliefs,</p>
<p>we have to talk about the underlying reasons</p>
<p>for why they think the things they think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to just say, like, that belief is bad</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, well, they believe it</p>
<p>for a whole bunch of things that are true and real,</p>
<p>to them at least.</p>
<p>So you have to address all of the underlying things</p>
<p>that they believe before you can change</p>
<p>the overlying belief.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m having a conversation with somebody,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be like, okay, why do you feel this</p>
<p>about that, that, and that?</p>
<p>Okay, I understand that.</p>
<p>Maybe like a better way to solve that</p>
<p>would be like this or that instead of this thing.</p>
<p>So to what degree do you have to empathize</p>
<p>with the person&rsquo;s worldview versus pushback?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the hard one.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m talking to other people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost always me stepping as much inside their bubble</p>
<p>as I can.</p>
<p>I have to like live and breathe their worldview</p>
<p>and be able to speak their worldview</p>
<p>in order to like navigate their thoughts</p>
<p>because my worldview is, I don&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even using this as an insult.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I am a little bit autistic or something,</p>
<p>but when I break apart things,</p>
<p>I just wanna see like study, study, study,</p>
<p>fact, fact, fact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how my mind works for everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I like to see.</p>
<p>Like personal stories don&rsquo;t do much for me.</p>
<p>Narrators don&rsquo;t do much for me.</p>
<p>Just show me like the data and the studies or whatever,</p>
<p>but for other people,</p>
<p>I think most brains are more human than that</p>
<p>and they tend to see things</p>
<p>that more kind of like surreal pictures</p>
<p>that are kind of painted</p>
<p>and the brushstrokes are way broader</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t care about the itty bitty tiny fact.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m talking to somebody else</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to get into their head</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to change their mind on things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be stepping into their world</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna try to be working through that framework.</p>
<p>A really good example might be,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll say like when it comes to trans issues for minors,</p>
<p>16 or 17 year old needs to get on puberty blockers.</p>
<p>The way that I want that debate to play out</p>
<p>is let&rsquo;s look at all the data,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what are the outcomes,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what are the processes for getting a medication</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll evaluate all of that</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll go in whatever like points more favorably,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s wholly unconvincing to most people, right?</p>
<p>So as a parent,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m having that conversation with another parent,</p>
<p>the easiest way for me to have that conversation</p>
<p>is like, hey, we both have kids.</p>
<p>Imagine how horrible it would be</p>
<p>if we felt like our kids needed help</p>
<p>and the government was trying to get between us</p>
<p>and their doctor in that conversation.</p>
<p>That might be how that talk plays out,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a really good argument</p>
<p>because I think there probably are times</p>
<p>that the government should get in between it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll have that conversation</p>
<p>because now I&rsquo;m in a world</p>
<p>where they understand what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m resonating with the way that they feel about things</p>
<p>and then I can make progress</p>
<p>with the way that they&rsquo;re kind of viewing the world</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m talking in a language they understand.</p>
<p>So on this particular topic of trans issues,</p>
<p>is that the reason you were banned from Twitch?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They just said hate speech,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t use like slurs or anything,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s hard to know exactly.</p>
<p>So I think you made the claim</p>
<p>that trans women shouldn&rsquo;t compete with cis women</p>
<p>in the women&rsquo;s athletics.</p>
<p>Can you make this case</p>
<p>and can you steelman the case against it?</p>
<p>I think in your community,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of trans folks who love you</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot who hate you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so if you can walk the tightrope of this conversation</p>
<p>to try to steelman both sides.</p>
<p>One of the argumentative strategies I say</p>
<p>is that like anytime you have a conversation,</p>
<p>you should be able to argue both sides</p>
<p>better than anybody else.</p>
<p>So for the my side, the genuine belief side,</p>
<p>it feels like overwhelmingly all of the data is showing</p>
<p>that trans, mostly trans women,</p>
<p>even after I think three years on some sort of like HRT</p>
<p>or estrogen stuff,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still maintaining these advantages</p>
<p>from their male puberty over cisgender women.</p>
<p>And if that is the case,</p>
<p>if we are gonna draw these distinctions around our sports</p>
<p>between women and men,</p>
<p>it feels unfair to have a category inside the women&rsquo;s sports</p>
<p>that are maintaining advantages</p>
<p>that are coming from a male puberty,</p>
<p>regardless of the amount of time they&rsquo;ve spent</p>
<p>on hormone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>So that would be my argument on that side.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s unfair from a performance enhancement aspect.</p>
<p>So the same way we ban performance enhancing drugs</p>
<p>that involve increasing of testosterone</p>
<p>in that same way would be unfair.</p>
<p>Essentially, yeah.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the case against?</p>
<p>The key, yeah.</p>
<p>So the case in favor of them competing together</p>
<p>is that realistically,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not gonna be a trans sports category.</p>
<p>Realistically, trans women</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t gonna be competitive with cis men</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve gone through these huge,</p>
<p>you know, like hormone changes</p>
<p>by the medication they&rsquo;re taking.</p>
<p>And that when we look at how sports are kind of done anyway,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of biological differences</p>
<p>between people within sports categories</p>
<p>that are determining their placement</p>
<p>in the professional world.</p>
<p>So for instance, somebody like me</p>
<p>is probably never gonna go far in the NBA</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not tall enough.</p>
<p>I think the average height in the NBA-</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t doubt yourself.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t doubt myself, yeah.</p>
<p>I wanna say it&rsquo;s like six or something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re huge people.</p>
<p>Or, you know, you look at like Michael Phelps</p>
<p>as a classic example of a guy</p>
<p>whose torso is like so long,</p>
<p>his body is built for swimming.</p>
<p>And I think there are some trans people</p>
<p>that will look at that,</p>
<p>or somebody advocating for this position,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll look at that and they&rsquo;ll go,</p>
<p>okay, realistically,</p>
<p>the way that Michael Phelps&rsquo; body processes lactic acid,</p>
<p>the shape physiologically of his body</p>
<p>is gonna put him in a level of competition</p>
<p>that so many men are never gonna reach</p>
<p>just because of biology.</p>
<p>How is it fair that you can have these biological outliers</p>
<p>competing in these categories,</p>
<p>but then when we come to like sports categories</p>
<p>with trans and cis women,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna take trans women</p>
<p>and say that they can&rsquo;t compete against cis women.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you also just say</p>
<p>that they have some level of biological difference there?</p>
<p>Like, is it really gonna be that great of a difference</p>
<p>than what Michael Phelps has versus the average swimmer,</p>
<p>or an NBA player has versus like the average height male?</p>
<p>Yeah, do you think we&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>into some tricky ethical territory</p>
<p>as we start to be able to,</p>
<p>through biology and genetics,</p>
<p>modify the human body?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I feel like those things are coming sooner</p>
<p>than we wanted them to.</p>
<p>Oh man, dude, have you seen the AI art?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m an AI person.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, then yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always been like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen when robots</p>
<p>can do art better than humans, LOL?</p>
<p>Like, well, we&rsquo;ll see in 20 years,</p>
<p>in 20 years, in 20 years.</p>
<p>And now you have AI art winning competitions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny because robots are essentially-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a robot behind you, by the way.</p>
<p>A robot behind me.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>Robots are really good at-</p>
<p>Careful what you say.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh God, I&rsquo;ll be careful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not like one of the Chinese ones</p>
<p>with a gun on it, right?</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Hopefully not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see, depending on what you say, yeah.</p>
<p>Robots are really good at showing</p>
<p>the limitations of the human mind</p>
<p>in categories that we didn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>we were limited before.</p>
<p>I think that humans have this idea intrinsically</p>
<p>that we have some type of innovative,</p>
<p>creative drive that is just outside</p>
<p>of the bounds of physical understanding.</p>
<p>And with a sophisticated enough program,</p>
<p>we see that maybe that&rsquo;s not actually true.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really scary thing.</p>
<p>Philosophically to deal with,</p>
<p>because we feel like we&rsquo;re very special, right?</p>
<p>We own the planet, we make computers.</p>
<p>And the idea that you can start to get these robots</p>
<p>that can do things that&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>you can do math, fine.</p>
<p>Okay, you can do calculations, fine.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t do art.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the human stuff.</p>
<p>And then when they start to do that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, shoot.</p>
<p>And that terrifies you a little bit?</p>
<p>Like the human species losing control</p>
<p>of our dominance over this earth?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily losing control</p>
<p>of our dominance.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess like a Skynet thing</p>
<p>could come in at some point.</p>
<p>But I think it brings us</p>
<p>to this really fundamental level of like,</p>
<p>what does it mean to be human?</p>
<p>What is it that we&rsquo;re good at?</p>
<p>What should we be doing with technology?</p>
<p>We never really ask that question in the Western world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always the technology is like normative</p>
<p>in that technology equals good</p>
<p>and more technology equals better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been like the default assumption.</p>
<p>In fact, if you ask a lot of people,</p>
<p>how do you know if civilization has progressed</p>
<p>over the past 100 or 200 years?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t say we have better relationships,</p>
<p>we have longer marriages, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say technology has improved.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got crazy phones, we&rsquo;ve got crazy computers.</p>
<p>And the idea that more technology might be bad</p>
<p>has never even crossed somebody&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s used for like a really bad thing.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>We kind of think as more and more automation is happening,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to get more and more meaning</p>
<p>from things like being artists and doing creative pursuits.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s like, oh shit, if the art,</p>
<p>if the creative pursuits are also being automated,</p>
<p>then what are we gonna gain meaning from?</p>
<p>What are the activities from which you&rsquo;ll gain meaning?</p>
<p>You know, my whole life I&rsquo;ve been working</p>
<p>on artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been different revolutions.</p>
<p>One of them is the machine learning revolution.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to build up intuition</p>
<p>and destroy that intuition about what is</p>
<p>and isn&rsquo;t solvable by machines.</p>
<p>I think for the longest time, I grew up thinking</p>
<p>Go is not, the game of Go is not solvable.</p>
<p>Because my understanding of AI systems</p>
<p>is ultimately that it&rsquo;s fundamentally a search mechanism</p>
<p>that is fundamentally going to be brute force.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shortcuts.</p>
<p>Sure, like if it can&rsquo;t solve the traveling salesman problem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even gonna be able to give you an approximation.</p>
<p>So most interesting problems</p>
<p>are giant travel salesman problem.</p>
<p>And then, so of course,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be able to solve that.</p>
<p>And then you, then the deep learning revolution</p>
<p>made you realize, holy shit,</p>
<p>these large neural networks with a giant number of knobs</p>
<p>is able to actually somehow</p>
<p>estimate functions that can do a pretty good job</p>
<p>of understanding deep representation of a thing,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s a game of Go</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s the human natural language</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s images and video or audio and even actions</p>
<p>in different video games and actions of robotics and so on.</p>
<p>And then you realize with diffusion models</p>
<p>and different generative models,</p>
<p>you start to realize, holy shit,</p>
<p>it can actually generate not just interesting representations</p>
<p>or interesting manifestations</p>
<p>of the representations of forms,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s able to do something</p>
<p>that impresses humans in its creativity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful in the way we think of art is beautiful.</p>
<p>Like it surprises us and makes us chuckle</p>
<p>and makes us sit back in awe and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And yet the thing that it seems to struggle with the most</p>
<p>is the physical world currently.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s counterintuitive.</p>
<p>We humans think that it&rsquo;s pretty trivial,</p>
<p>the being able to pick up a cup,</p>
<p>being able to like write with a pen,</p>
<p>like in the physical space, we think that&rsquo;s trivial.</p>
<p>We give ourselves respect for being great artists</p>
<p>and great mathematicians and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that seems to be much easier than the physical space.</p>
<p>The bodies are really cool.</p>
<p>There is a, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably Asimov or somebody.</p>
<p>There was some science fiction writer</p>
<p>that had a short story and it was like an alien</p>
<p>that had landed on earth.</p>
<p>And it was describing our bodies</p>
<p>from a totally alien perspective.</p>
<p>And when you think about all the things we can do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>We can climb through a whole multitude of environments.</p>
<p>We can exist in a multitude of temperatures.</p>
<p>We can manipulate things just with our hands</p>
<p>and the way that we can interact with things around us.</p>
<p>And yeah, we&rsquo;re very capable on like a physical level,</p>
<p>even though, like you said, we think about ourselves like,</p>
<p>oh, well, human beings have really big brains.</p>
<p>And we do, we&rsquo;re really intelligent as well.</p>
<p>But yeah, our bodies are pretty cool too.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a fascinating hierarchical biological system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re made up of a bunch of different living organisms</p>
<p>that all don&rsquo;t know about the big picture of our body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all functioning in its own little local world</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s doing its thing.</p>
<p>But together, it has a, it forms a super resilient system.</p>
<p>All of that comes from a very comprehensive system</p>
<p>compressed encoding of what makes a human.</p>
<p>You start with the DNA and it builds up</p>
<p>from a single cell to a giant organism.</p>
<p>I mean, and because of the DNA,</p>
<p>through the evolution process,</p>
<p>you can constantly create new humans</p>
<p>and new living organisms that adapt to the environment.</p>
<p>Like that resilience to the physical world,</p>
<p>it seems like running the whole earth over again,</p>
<p>the whole evolutionary process over again</p>
<p>is, might be the only way to do it.</p>
<p>So to create a robot that actually adapts,</p>
<p>is as resilient to the dynamic world,</p>
<p>might be a really difficult problem.</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>Well, I was gonna say like in a programming environment,</p>
<p>you can do things on timescales</p>
<p>that are impossible in the real world, right?</p>
<p>Like the benefit to AI and computers is computationally,</p>
<p>they can compute so much data so quickly.</p>
<p>Whereas on human timetables, we have to wait.</p>
<p>When you talk about evolution,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s generation after generation after generation.</p>
<p>Maybe in a virtual environment that could be simulated</p>
<p>and then those changes could happen a lot quicker.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s on a human timescale,</p>
<p>but you have to look at earth as a quantum mechanical system,</p>
<p>the computation is happening super fast.</p>
<p>This is a giant computer doing a giant simulation.</p>
<p>So just because for us humans, it&rsquo;s slow,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like trillions of organisms involved in you,</p>
<p>destiny being you.</p>
<p>Sure, but the next iteration of like from human to human,</p>
<p>on the quantum level, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on.</p>
<p>You talk about like changes in DNA, for instance, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s happening from a generation to generation timescale.</p>
<p>Like in a virtual environment,</p>
<p>that could theoretically happen.</p>
<p>Well, it already is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like protein folding, like huge cloud computing,</p>
<p>probably ML stuff that&rsquo;s like working</p>
<p>and doing all of that stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll run like trillions and trillions of simulations</p>
<p>every second and stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe not every second, but.</p>
<p>Still slower than the actual protein folding, much slower.</p>
<p>The, that&rsquo;s for the problem of solving protein folding</p>
<p>to estimate the 3D structure,</p>
<p>but the actual body does the actual protein folding</p>
<p>way faster.</p>
<p>So like we&rsquo;re, the question is,</p>
<p>can we shortcut the simulation of human evolution,</p>
<p>try to figure out how to build up an organism</p>
<p>without simulating all the details?</p>
<p>Because we have to simulate all the details of biology</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;d have to put something in a pond</p>
<p>and then watch it for a billion years.</p>
<p>That might be the most efficient way to do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the universe most likely is,</p>
<p>is a kind of simulation created by a teenager</p>
<p>in their basement to try to see what happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a computer game.</p>
<p>That might be the most efficient way</p>
<p>to create interesting organisms.</p>
<p>But within the system, it&rsquo;s perhaps possible</p>
<p>to create other robots that will be of use</p>
<p>and will entertain us in the way</p>
<p>that other humans entertain us.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really interesting, of course, problem.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s surprising how difficult it has been</p>
<p>to create systems that operate in the physical world</p>
<p>and operate in that physical world</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s safe to humans and interesting to humans.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s also the human factor,</p>
<p>the human-robot interaction.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s like the most interesting problem,</p>
<p>to figure out how to do that well.</p>
<p>And so Elon Musk and others, Boston Dynamics,</p>
<p>have worked on legged robots.</p>
<p>So I really care about legged robots.</p>
<p>Those are super interesting.</p>
<p>How to make them such that they&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to operate successfully in a dynamic environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super tricky.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like the dumbest of dogs,</p>
<p>speaking of which, there&rsquo;s a dog barking outside.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really tricky to create</p>
<p>those kinds of organisms that live in the human world.</p>
<p>Then again, if more and more of us</p>
<p>move into the digital world, so you stream a lot,</p>
<p>part of who you are exists in the digital space.</p>
<p>The fact that you have a physical representation also,</p>
<p>maybe more and more will become not important.</p>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>because I bought a lot of stock in Meta,</p>
<p>and man, it&rsquo;s down a lot.</p>
<p>Meta the company.</p>
<p>Is there some degree, can you look at yourself,</p>
<p>like Steven, the physical meat vehicle,</p>
<p>and then the destiny, this digital space,</p>
<p>like digital avatar.</p>
<p>Do you sense that in a certain way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the digital avatar?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always tried to keep my on-stream personality</p>
<p>as genuine as possible, so they&rsquo;re one and the same to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really view them as two separate entities,</p>
<p>but I mean, I always view myself as Steven,</p>
<p>the real-life person.</p>
<p>Destiny&rsquo;s my online name, but.</p>
<p>No, but because so many,</p>
<p>your social network is established in the digital space.</p>
<p>So many people know you through the digital space.</p>
<p>Can we swap out another person that looks like you?</p>
<p>And like an AI system,</p>
<p>and then that entity known as destiny</p>
<p>will continue existing.</p>
<p>So I mean, I must be like,</p>
<p>there must be some level of sophistication</p>
<p>that could emulate a human brain, I would imagine, right?</p>
<p>Probably the tech&rsquo;s not there yet, but.</p>
<p>Well, the question is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the level of sophistication of the audience</p>
<p>that would recognize that something has changed?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s the Turing test.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How hard is it to trick your audience,</p>
<p>your large audience of fans that watch your streams,</p>
<p>that when you swap out an AI that emulates you,</p>
<p>that nothing has changed?</p>
<p>And the question is,</p>
<p>do you have to really simulate</p>
<p>so much of the human brain for that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>So, I mean, like you said,</p>
<p>a lot of political discourse</p>
<p>is just walking down the tree together.</p>
<p>So you can probably emulate a lot of that discussion.</p>
<p>Yeah, it would depend on if you&rsquo;re doing old data sets</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re training on that,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m having conversations about abortion</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re creating vaccines,</p>
<p>I imagine it could do it for quite a while.</p>
<p>The only thing that would be weird</p>
<p>is when novel issues pop up.</p>
<p>Then you probably need a more sophisticated resemblance</p>
<p>of the inner brain, right?</p>
<p>You have to keep training on the internet,</p>
<p>so how the language models,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the most incredible breakthroughs,</p>
<p>is the language models.</p>
<p>You just have to keep retraining the system on Reddit,</p>
<p>which is actually what a lot of it is trained on,</p>
<p>which is hilarious.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>that kind of like funny problems,</p>
<p>like the trolley problem,</p>
<p>that we can kind of work</p>
<p>through our normative ethical systems on,</p>
<p>are now like real questions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re driving a Tesla and it&rsquo;s on autopilot</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna hit somebody,</p>
<p>but it can swerve and hit somebody else,</p>
<p>what ought the system do?</p>
<p>We went very quickly</p>
<p>from fun kind of like project in philosophy class</p>
<p>to we need to solve this for insurance purposes</p>
<p>as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to think about.</p>
<p>Well, I actually have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring up the trolley problem with you later.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating version of it that I find hilarious.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s return to your low point.</p>
<p>You started playing video games.</p>
<p>That was a lucky break.</p>
<p>You did text-based ones.</p>
<p>That was a lucky break</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve gotten to be pretty good at learning.</p>
<p>And then you started thinking about going to college</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>What happened next?</p>
<p>I mean, I went to like a prep school,</p>
<p>so you kind of have to go to college after.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the point, right?</p>
<p>I was also a millennial.</p>
<p>All of us had to go to college.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always what they told us, so.</p>
<p>My life was kind of, it&rsquo;s hard to describe.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really think much of the future.</p>
<p>I was just kind of enjoying the day-to-day</p>
<p>because everything in my life was pretty weird.</p>
<p>Both my parents had moved to Florida</p>
<p>by the time I was 16, 17.</p>
<p>I was living with my grandma.</p>
<p>I was working.</p>
<p>I had a girlfriend, moved out.</p>
<p>We got a place, did college.</p>
<p>By the time I got into college,</p>
<p>I had transitioned from working at McDonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to I was like working in a casino restaurant, basically.</p>
<p>And I was really good at that job.</p>
<p>So high level of patience for drunk people and sane people.</p>
<p>And I was doing music in school</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d really grown to love music.</p>
<p>And my kind of thought process was,</p>
<p>my thought process was I can do music as a hobby, I guess,</p>
<p>unless I get really good</p>
<p>and maybe I can make money with that.</p>
<p>But otherwise I love music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay going to school for music, getting good at it,</p>
<p>and then just doing that on the side.</p>
<p>And then my main job would kind of be</p>
<p>this career I was building at the casino.</p>
<p>And basically the trying to balance personal life</p>
<p>plus graveyard shift, six to eight weeks at a casino,</p>
<p>and then a full-time music degree was not possible for me.</p>
<p>And eventually I had to drop school</p>
<p>after I think it was like three years.</p>
<p>And after I dropped school to maintain my casino job,</p>
<p>after a few months, I got fired from my casino job.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d essentially just thrown away</p>
<p>like the past like three or four years of my life.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you get fired from the casino job?</p>
<p>I heard there&rsquo;s a story behind that.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a story.</p>
<p>Basically, I was just really dumb</p>
<p>when it came to understanding corporate politics.</p>
<p>And this is funny</p>
<p>because the same attitude kind of followed me</p>
<p>into the streaming world.</p>
<p>My thought process has kind of always been</p>
<p>that like as long as I&rsquo;m really good at what I do,</p>
<p>I should be untouchable.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m really good, you can&rsquo;t do anything to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to play any dumb games or whatever.</p>
<p>And at the casino, I think I was the youngest.</p>
<p>It was originally shiftly</p>
<p>than supervisor position at the casino.</p>
<p>And when I started to get my own shifts,</p>
<p>there were problems that I would run into on graveyard shift</p>
<p>because of carryover from the swing shift.</p>
<p>I remember one of these problems</p>
<p>was underneath the soda machine,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t cleaning it properly</p>
<p>and fruit flies were showing up.</p>
<p>And the manager came in one morning and she was like,</p>
<p>hey, what&rsquo;s going on with the machine?</p>
<p>And I was like, listen,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take everything from swing shift</p>
<p>and do everything at grave shift.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>They need to figure out their stuff better</p>
<p>or I need more employees.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not possible for me.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what did you tell anybody else?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I complained to the supervisor</p>
<p>on the swing shift all the time.</p>
<p>And she told me,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not getting the answer that you like,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s your responsibility to email the next person up.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, okay, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And some months went on and I ran into more problems</p>
<p>because on graveyard, here&rsquo;s how,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s everywhere,</p>
<p>but morning shift is the easiest</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re the most overstaffed</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when all the VPs are in</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when all the managers are there</p>
<p>and everybody blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Swing shift is the most challenging.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where your highest flow of customers is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also decently staffed there,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on.</p>
<p>And graveyard, nobody cares at all about you.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t give you any employees.</p>
<p>You might get swamped, you might not.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>Make sure it&rsquo;s clean for day shift.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>A quick question for sort of clarification.</p>
<p>So this is 24 hour?</p>
<p>24 hour diner, yeah, inside the casino, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a diner in a casino.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I had an amazing moment</p>
<p>at a diner in a casino recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special place.</p>
<p>A diner in a casino is a place of magic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d say magic,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of other worldly stuff going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s characters, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and I had an interaction with a waitress</p>
<p>that was the sweetest waitress in the world.</p>
<p>And it was just like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>made me feel less alone in this cruel world of ours.</p>
<p>So graveyard begins when?</p>
<p>For me, my shift was 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.</p>
<p>Or sometimes I get called in early,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;d be 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no love for that shift.</p>
<p>No, especially not trying to do school at the same time.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>But yeah, basically, long story short,</p>
<p>I ran into a problem with my,</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t have enough employees on my shift.</p>
<p>VPs were coming in in the morning.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just like, hey, the diner&rsquo;s kind of dirty.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you&rsquo;ve cut all my employees past 4 a.m.</p>
<p>Like on some nights, I&rsquo;m literally cooking</p>
<p>and doing front of house, like all on my own.</p>
<p>Like, I can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>And my manager, Pam, told me,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;ve got to figure it out.</p>
<p>And so I remembered her advice.</p>
<p>So I emailed the VP of food and beverage and I CC&rsquo;d her.</p>
<p>And I said, I&rsquo;m not getting the help I need</p>
<p>on my restaurant.</p>
<p>Now, I didn&rsquo;t know at the time</p>
<p>that I was basically completely throwing her under the bus</p>
<p>because of that email.</p>
<p>But retroactively, when I look back on things,</p>
<p>or retrospectively, I see that was the moment</p>
<p>that I got like marked for deletion.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t really understand it,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;d heard terminology</p>
<p>for papering somebody out the door.</p>
<p>But after that point, I started to get written up</p>
<p>for like a lot of little random things.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d missed one day of work</p>
<p>in my three years at the casino.</p>
<p>And I started to get written up</p>
<p>for like showing up like one or two minutes late.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of weird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s whatever.</p>
<p>Or written up for random ways about filing paperwork.</p>
<p>And then eventually there came a situation</p>
<p>with another employee where they were,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s complicated, it has to do with like call-out stuff.</p>
<p>But basically they wanted to come,</p>
<p>or they wanted to call out.</p>
<p>And I told them if they called out,</p>
<p>they were gonna get fired because they were at like 10 points.</p>
<p>They were at nine points and 10 points is firing,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Pam told me, you can tell her that she&rsquo;s gonna get a point,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t tell her she&rsquo;s gonna get fired.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that meant.</p>
<p>And then I told her that if you call out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get, you know, you&rsquo;re fucked,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get fired, or you&rsquo;re gonna be at 10 points.</p>
<p>And then I got called in early, like three days later.</p>
<p>And Pam was like, you inappropriately communicated</p>
<p>with an employee because you said the F word</p>
<p>in a text message.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, really?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shot.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, well, you also tried to fire the employee.</p>
<p>And I was like, no, I told her she was gonna get 10 points.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, well, you used the F word.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is insane.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t, just because I was such a high-performing</p>
<p>employee, I was like, there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m getting fired.</p>
<p>And then I did.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>Cashed out my 401k and moped for like three months</p>
<p>because I had thrown away school for this casino job.</p>
<p>And then I got fired from this job that like,</p>
<p>yeah, nobody believed I got fired.</p>
<p>It was just insane, yeah.</p>
<p>So if you look back, if you were allowed to,</p>
<p>not just to look back to your own memory,</p>
<p>but actually watch yourself,</p>
<p>like somebody recorded a video that whole time,</p>
<p>do you think you would be surprised,</p>
<p>you would notice some things like potentially</p>
<p>of not having a self-awareness,</p>
<p>not having like social, like a civility and social etiquette</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s played in the human relations?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So is that at the core of it, essentially?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, that follows me even to this day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re recording or not,</p>
<p>but when we spoke earlier about like meta conversations,</p>
<p>I have to think a lot sometimes about meta conversations</p>
<p>because the way that I want to drive a conversation</p>
<p>will sometimes be way different</p>
<p>than what is like the best way to have a conversation.</p>
<p>Whereas I just want to like go really hard</p>
<p>on like some itty-bitty, like some idiosyncrasy</p>
<p>at some factor, figure, whatever,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not like the human conversation</p>
<p>I need to have, you know?</p>
<p>So you got fired slash left that job</p>
<p>and that took you to the job that would be the lowest point.</p>
<p>Yeah, because there was a huge downgrade in pay.</p>
<p>I went from getting like, I think at the casino,</p>
<p>because I worked so much overtime,</p>
<p>I was getting like 22.50 an hour on all my overtime.</p>
<p>And this was back in 2008, 2009 as like a college student,</p>
<p>like it was amazing pay.</p>
<p>I had benefits, like everything was good.</p>
<p>And then the carpet cleaning was like,</p>
<p>I was probably getting my paycheck like every other week</p>
<p>was maybe 1,500 bucks or $1,000.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m working like 13 day stretches,</p>
<p>like I have every other Sunday off.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so many hours.</p>
<p>Like I have to show up at the shop at like seven or six</p>
<p>and then I go home at like eight or nine,</p>
<p>depending on when my jobs are throughout the day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing businesses or residential</p>
<p>or what are you doing?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Are you working for a company that does carpet cleaning?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, and so like there&rsquo;s a schedule thing,</p>
<p>you have to go to it and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so like this is why the schedule would suck,</p>
<p>is sometimes I&rsquo;d show up at,</p>
<p>I think we had to be in the shop at,</p>
<p>I think it was 7 a.m.</p>
<p>We show up at the shop at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>First job might be at eight or nine,</p>
<p>but that job might be like a one hour job.</p>
<p>So I might show up at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>and have a job from 8.30 to 9.30.</p>
<p>Then my next job might not be from,</p>
<p>until like say 11.</p>
<p>So from 8.30 to 9.30 I&rsquo;ll do one job.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve got a job from like 11 to 12 or something.</p>
<p>Then I might have like a decent job from like five to eight.</p>
<p>But like my whole day is destroyed</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing like three smallish jobs.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m getting like 30 bucks maybe for being in the shop</p>
<p>or at my job for like 10 or 11 hours</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like horrible.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re somebody that seems to be extremely good</p>
<p>at thinking and conversation.</p>
<p>And so have a bit of an ego perhaps</p>
<p>in both the negative and the positive sense of that word.</p>
<p>Was there some aspect of working at McDonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and then working at the casino</p>
<p>and then working for the,</p>
<p>as a carpet cleaner that was humbling?</p>
<p>No, never.</p>
<p>I had a-</p>
<p>The ego burned bright through it all.</p>
<p>Or no, you can push back on the ego.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I understand.</p>
<p>I totally get what you mean.</p>
<p>I had a really close friend growing up whose name was Chris</p>
<p>and I think we probably met when he was,</p>
<p>we were like four or five, I think.</p>
<p>He lived behind me and I grew up with him</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d always been kind of an outsider</p>
<p>to the world that I was in</p>
<p>once I got to high school for sure</p>
<p>because all of those kids were incredibly wealthy.</p>
<p>You know, Corvettes and Mustangs when they turned 16.</p>
<p>It was a prep school and I was doing the,</p>
<p>they had like a work study program there</p>
<p>where you could stay after school from 2.30 to five</p>
<p>every day to kind of like work to pay for your tuition.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d been working like throughout all of high school.</p>
<p>I got another job at McDonald&rsquo;s when I was 18,</p>
<p>worked at the casino.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d always been doing that kind of work.</p>
<p>I never really viewed it as like beneath me or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t have like a family of doctors</p>
<p>or lawyers or anything.</p>
<p>And then me and my other friend, Chris guy,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d always make fun of everybody else</p>
<p>for being kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>like preppy kids and everything, so.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some pride to that sort of hard work.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess a little bit, yeah.</p>
<p>Because, you know, looking especially at my dad,</p>
<p>like the solution to every problem</p>
<p>was just throw more hours of work at it basically.</p>
<p>So that was always my, yeah, go-to and I never, yeah.</p>
<p>What was psychologically the low point?</p>
<p>I think psychologically the low point was that</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m doing this carpet cleaning job,</p>
<p>driving around my city, there&rsquo;s like this feeling of,</p>
<p>I guess for a lot of people it&rsquo;s probably college,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a feeling when you&rsquo;re in high school</p>
<p>that everything is like so exciting</p>
<p>and the whole world is kind of in front of you</p>
<p>and there are a trillion, trillion</p>
<p>different branching paths of possibilities.</p>
<p>And, you know, even through high school,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking like, am I gonna be a doctor or a lawyer</p>
<p>or can I join the MBA or can I do this or that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these things in front of you.</p>
<p>And when I especially felt it</p>
<p>when I was doing these carpet cleaning jobs</p>
<p>and I think it was in the fall,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be outside some of these houses</p>
<p>and I just kind of look around</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d recognize a lot of these neighborhoods</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d drive around with friends in</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;d, you know, be walking through.</p>
<p>I ran cross country, some of them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be running through these neighborhoods</p>
<p>and it was just kind of like this feeling of looking around</p>
<p>and it was like, when I was here in the past,</p>
<p>this was like kind of like a transitionary phase of my life</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m doing this and it&rsquo;s so fun and exciting</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna move on to something else</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be fun and exciting and awesome.</p>
<p>And then like, you know, two years later,</p>
<p>my whole life has collapsed.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m in a house that I can&rsquo;t afford anymore.</p>
<p>My ex that I hate is pregnant with my kid</p>
<p>and I have no money, I&rsquo;ve got no upward mobility,</p>
<p>I failed college, my job is horrible.</p>
<p>Like just every single, like this is like,</p>
<p>all of those, the way function had collapsed into one thing</p>
<p>and that one thing was the worst thing</p>
<p>that could have possibly been at the time for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, like everything was gone and horrible.</p>
<p>So yeah, that was the feeling I had at the time.</p>
<p>Do you ever contemplate suicide?</p>
<p>I thought about thinking about it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve just never been that kind of person, so.</p>
<p>I mean, basically as a way to escape from the hardship.</p>
<p>Something that I&rsquo;m so incredibly lucky,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why or how,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna chalk it up to biology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had really high mental baseline.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve like depression and all of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been a few short stints I&rsquo;ve dealt with at past 30</p>
<p>because I did a lot of drugs.</p>
<p>But other than that, my mental baseline is just so high.</p>
<p>And even in the carpet cleaning days,</p>
<p>like if you, man, the videos might still be there.</p>
<p>I think on my old YouTube channel</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll be like playing StarCraft</p>
<p>when I first started getting into streaming</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be calling up customers like,</p>
<p>this is Steve from Guaranteed Clean,</p>
<p>we had to move your job back one hour,</p>
<p>is it okay if I show up instead of 2.30?</p>
<p>And then I hang up, it&rsquo;s like, all right guys,</p>
<p>we got three more games and it&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Like stuff like that.</p>
<p>So my baseline has always been like really high</p>
<p>for mental function.</p>
<p>Even in the low point that you had strength,</p>
<p>is there anything you can give by way of advice</p>
<p>from people for whom the wave function collapses</p>
<p>as it does for many of us?</p>
<p>Like, holy fuck, the world is not full of opportunity</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of a failure.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rough because like I usually ask for compassion</p>
<p>from people that have it better off.</p>
<p>Because like once you&rsquo;re down there,</p>
<p>like the only reason, I say I got lucky,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t even really lucky.</p>
<p>Or it was lucky, but it was more lucky.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just lucky that I got into streaming.</p>
<p>It was lucky that I was into computers at an early age.</p>
<p>It was lucky that I played video games at an early age.</p>
<p>It was lucky that all the tech came up</p>
<p>at exactly that right point in time.</p>
<p>Like I was a pretty smart guy,</p>
<p>but it was definitely preparation meets opportunity.</p>
<p>And that opportunity was like</p>
<p>at the exact precise moment of my life.</p>
<p>If anything had gone differently,</p>
<p>then I would just be cleaning carpets today, so.</p>
<p>So in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>This is like one out of like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many, many Stevens</p>
<p>that are just still carpet cleaning</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re full of pain and resentment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The one piece of advice that I give,</p>
<p>and I hate that I have to push back</p>
<p>against all these crypto bros and everybody online.</p>
<p>For decently intelligent people that are successful,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard anybody give a contradiction to this.</p>
<p>Maybe you will.</p>
<p>You can tell me if you disagree.</p>
<p>I always look at kids in high school</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, just try a little bit harder.</p>
<p>Like 30 minutes a night, if you don&rsquo;t study,</p>
<p>just do 30 minutes, just do a little bit more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re laying the foundation for the rest of your life</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t appreciate it in high school and college.</p>
<p>But oh my God, when you get out,</p>
<p>everything in your life is so much easier.</p>
<p>You have probably more responsibility</p>
<p>over the direction of your life</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like 13, 14 years old</p>
<p>than you ever will once you&rsquo;re like 25 and older.</p>
<p>Because this is like when you&rsquo;re determining</p>
<p>the foundations that everything&rsquo;s gonna be built on.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>First of all, it does seem that</p>
<p>the liberating aspect of being young</p>
<p>is like anything you learn.</p>
<p>So working hard at learning something will pay off.</p>
<p>In like nonlinear ways, like you said with video games.</p>
<p>I feel like, so like people who are like, I hate school.</p>
<p>All right, well, fine.</p>
<p>But find something where you&rsquo;re challenging yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re growing, you&rsquo;re learning, you&rsquo;re learning a skill,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re learning about a thing.</p>
<p>Of course, you could push back and say,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s some trajectories that might not be productive</p>
<p>like if you spend the entirety of your teen years</p>
<p>playing, I don&rsquo;t know, League of Legends game,</p>
<p>you have a love and hate relationship with.</p>
<p>No, just a hate and hate relationship.</p>
<p>Okay, well, we&rsquo;ll talk about,</p>
<p>I think you have a love-hate relationship</p>
<p>with hate in general.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just, in love.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try to decomplexify that one.</p>
<p>I think in general, just investing yourself</p>
<p>fully with passion really does pay off.</p>
<p>But that said, also school,</p>
<p>I feel like doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit.</p>
<p>Like high school in particular,</p>
<p>middle school and high school,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s general education.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re lucky to have good teachers,</p>
<p>but honestly, I haven&rsquo;t mostly.</p>
<p>The textbooks themselves with good teachers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one chance in life</p>
<p>you have to really explore a subject.</p>
<p>Fuck grades.</p>
<p>Getting good grades is a tension, I would say,</p>
<p>with actual learning, that is true.</p>
<p>But just get a biology textbook</p>
<p>and to explore ideas in biology</p>
<p>and allowing yourself to be inspired by the beauty of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that really, really, really pays off</p>
<p>and you never get a chance to do that again.</p>
<p>And maybe not even textbooks,</p>
<p>like reading, straight up reading.</p>
<p>I think if you read, this is a one time in life</p>
<p>you get a chance to read, really read.</p>
<p>Like read a book a day, read.</p>
<p>You can really invest.</p>
<p>You can really grow by reading.</p>
<p>I mean, Elon Musk, all those guys talk about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very rare that you meet</p>
<p>like a dumb person who reads a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s ever happened in my life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dumb or not successful.</p>
<p>And the cool thing is it seems like the reading,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like investment.</p>
<p>The reading you do early on in high school</p>
<p>pays off way more than the reading you do later.</p>
<p>So like the really influential reading</p>
<p>is during those high school years.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re basically learning from others</p>
<p>the mistakes they&rsquo;ve made, the solutions to problems.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically learning the shortcuts to life.</p>
<p>Like whatever the hell you want to do.</p>
<p>Music, read from the best people that the music theory,</p>
<p>like learn music theory.</p>
<p>Learn, read biographies about jazz musicians,</p>
<p>blues musicians.</p>
<p>See all the mistakes, see what they did,</p>
<p>see the shortcuts.</p>
<p>If you want to do podcasting, read about other podcasts.</p>
<p>If you want to do streaming, read about other streamers,</p>
<p>physicists and so on.</p>
<p>And I feel like you figure out all the mistakes</p>
<p>and you get to shortcut through life.</p>
<p>Because most people show up to college</p>
<p>without having done that.</p>
<p>And now you get a chance to shortcut your way past them.</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%.</p>
<p>But nobody really teaches you that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, go to school from this time to that time.</p>
<p>Shut up, this is just what you do.</p>
<p>Eat your broccoli.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s two huge problems.</p>
<p>One is now that I&rsquo;m older,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t know anything as a kid.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really criticize adults as a kid.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re a kid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ageist, if I may say so.</p>
<p>I am, I am super ageist.</p>
<p>And as I get older, I get even more ageist.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people where I argue with them.</p>
<p>I was like, man, dude, you&rsquo;re really 22, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I can tell every word you say.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s seeps of like 22 year old-ness.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay, I love that for you, yeah.</p>
<p>I could just say, because you mentioned this.</p>
<p>Your wife is a fellow streamer, Melina.</p>
<p>You mentioned that this is a source of fights</p>
<p>for the two of you that, and I could just feel that.</p>
<p>There is truth to what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which is like, all right,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that because you&rsquo;re 22.</p>
<p>Just wait until you&rsquo;re 25,</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t be saying that anymore.</p>
<p>Now, that is the most annoying thing for people to hear.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t ever say that, of course.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s actually usually true.</p>
<p>Because we do go through phases in life.</p>
<p>And you can understand that most things are phases.</p>
<p>So just in general, you can say, just wait.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t see this, you won&rsquo;t feel this way.</p>
<p>Again, I could say that to you,</p>
<p>you could say that to yourself, just wait.</p>
<p>Whatever you&rsquo;re feeling like, just wait.</p>
<p>In five, 10 years, you&rsquo;ll be a different person,</p>
<p>and you will laugh at the things you take seriously now,</p>
<p>that are causing you pain now, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But people hate hearing that.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think the joke that I always say is like,</p>
<p>if I could literally step into a time machine,</p>
<p>and I could come back out and see myself as a 17 year old,</p>
<p>and I could say, hey, I am literally you from the future.</p>
<p>You see the time machine.</p>
<p>And I would look at me, and I would see the time machine.</p>
<p>And I would give myself the best advice in the world,</p>
<p>to be the most successful person.</p>
<p>I would ignore all of it.</p>
<p>Even knowing it came from myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, this guy sold out.</p>
<p>This dude doesn&rsquo;t know what the fuck he&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>Like, nah, I&rsquo;ll figure it out better.</p>
<p>Like, he must&rsquo;ve made some,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would think as a 17.</p>
<p>Even if I knew it was myself from the future,</p>
<p>I would just 100% never believe it.</p>
<p>And knowing that is very frustrating.</p>
<p>But I keep that in mind when I deal with younger people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why like, I never,</p>
<p>I always say on stream when I&rsquo;m talking to,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s been stuff with like Sneako,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another girl on my stream called Lab.</p>
<p>Like when I see the way the,</p>
<p>I see the mistakes they&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, because I&rsquo;ve made all of these mistakes,</p>
<p>sometimes in the most public and horrible fashion ever.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m never like a mentor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna sit there and like tell you like,</p>
<p>oh, do this or that or that or that.</p>
<p>Cause like, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re gonna listen to me.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to condescend to you.</p>
<p>And you know, you figure stuff out</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be here if you want to talk about it, but yeah.</p>
<p>There was a, one of the stories,</p>
<p>there was a company that didn&rsquo;t work with me</p>
<p>because I was very adamant on defending</p>
<p>like very radical notions about language</p>
<p>and racial slurs and everything.</p>
<p>When I was like 22 or whatever.</p>
<p>And there was a company and they said,</p>
<p>well, we don&rsquo;t want to work with this guy for an event.</p>
<p>And after they&rsquo;d said that,</p>
<p>I had written an article on my website</p>
<p>called the company was Gigabyte.</p>
<p>They make motherboards.</p>
<p>I said, fuck Gigabyte in the ass.</p>
<p>That was the title to my article.</p>
<p>And it was like, well, if they don&rsquo;t want to work with me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to blow them up</p>
<p>and never do anything ever with them again.</p>
<p>And it was just like, like looking back at it now,</p>
<p>obviously as a, as an older person, like,</p>
<p>hey, you need to pump the brakes and chill.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re destroying yourself.</p>
<p>But yeah, as a young person, it&rsquo;s like, yeah, you&rsquo;re 22.</p>
<p>Of course you think that you can say whatever</p>
<p>and do whatever.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re good at what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the whole world behind you.</p>
<p>And yeah, geez.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>You have a history of using offensive language,</p>
<p>like the R word, the N word,</p>
<p>including the N word with a hard R,</p>
<p>calling women bitches,</p>
<p>talking about rape in a nonchalant way.</p>
<p>What part of that do you regret?</p>
<p>And what part of that do you not?</p>
<p>Language is very complicated.</p>
<p>When it comes to stuff relating to slurs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been like a whole trajectory of feelings</p>
<p>on everything related to language.</p>
<p>So my-</p>
<p>For you personally and for the internet as a whole.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t care about the internet.</p>
<p>Almost for me personally.</p>
<p>In my early twenties, I&rsquo;ll say like 22, 23,</p>
<p>I think probably when I first started streaming,</p>
<p>my feeling is that any word is just a word.</p>
<p>And if it hurts you, that&rsquo;s your fault.</p>
<p>Take responsibility for yourself.</p>
<p>This probably came from my background</p>
<p>of being like a really independent person.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just kind of like the mind</p>
<p>that I had for everything.</p>
<p>And there were basically,</p>
<p>there were like a collection of experiences that I had</p>
<p>that as I grew, I started to realize like, okay,</p>
<p>well, I feel differently about some of these words</p>
<p>depending on the context.</p>
<p>And I can see how they can affect other people</p>
<p>depending on the context.</p>
<p>So as I&rsquo;ve kind of like grown,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve developed a more sophisticated understanding</p>
<p>of how different words are used</p>
<p>and how they affect people, whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>And more importantly, whether I like it or not.</p>
<p>And that words can, even if I don&rsquo;t want it to be,</p>
<p>they can be a vehicle for emboldening</p>
<p>certain types of ideas that I don&rsquo;t want to embolden.</p>
<p>And yeah, that&rsquo;s kind of been the whole like growth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky that in the time</p>
<p>that I came up on the internet,</p>
<p>I was able to learn these lessons</p>
<p>because if I was trying to learn those same lessons today,</p>
<p>I would have been completely destroyed</p>
<p>because I had insane views on language like 10 years ago.</p>
<p>We could talk about the past.</p>
<p>We could talk about the present.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the past first.</p>
<p>So how do you deal with the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s videos of you in the past</p>
<p>saying the N word, including the N word with a hard R?</p>
<p>So generally-</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the context?</p>
<p>Can you give me like, what would be the context usually?</p>
<p>When I lay out this defense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not because I wouldn&rsquo;t have used the N word.</p>
<p>Generally, whenever I said the N word,</p>
<p>it was usually in an example of like,</p>
<p>this is something that like a racist person would say.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever, on the internet,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever called anybody</p>
<p>like the N word with a hard R.</p>
<p>Not because I wouldn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>but just because it wasn&rsquo;t in my vocabulary.</p>
<p>I played RTS, real-time strategy,</p>
<p>and we use the F slur for gay people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one, and I use that one a ton.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve called people that a ton in the past.</p>
<p>So I should actually just, as a small tangent-</p>
<p>Yeah, go for it.</p>
<p>And this is what I&rsquo;d like to explore with you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ruthlessness to the language in the gaming world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different communities.</p>
<p>They have different flavors of language-</p>
<p>Of hate speech, yeah.</p>
<p>Of hate speech, essentially.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a humor to it,</p>
<p>which really bothers me in a dark way</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t been able to really think through,</p>
<p>because humor seems to be a kind of catalyst for hate.</p>
<p>It seems to normalize hate.</p>
<p>Like you say, basically, it&rsquo;s like Louis C.K.</p>
<p>says a lot of edgy things,</p>
<p>but you take something Louis C.K. says</p>
<p>and do it in a non-funny way,</p>
<p>and do it over and over and over,</p>
<p>and keep increasing the hatefulness of it, the vitriol.</p>
<p>And somehow you find yourself like Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p>in a world full of hate, where there&rsquo;s no good and evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>In fact, the good is to be mocked,</p>
<p>and the evil is to be celebrated for the humor of it.</p>
<p>Basically not taking the ideas of evil seriously.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what it,</p>
<p>it reveals something about human nature that you can let go.</p>
<p>The moral relativism that can happen</p>
<p>when you do that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>At the same time, I&rsquo;m a fan of dark humor when done well.</p>
<p>Anyway, for people who are not familiar,</p>
<p>I just wanted to mention that some of the worst hate speech</p>
<p>that ends in LOL happens in gaming communities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you come from in a certain part.</p>
<p>So a lot of people don&rsquo;t remember this,</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t know this because they&rsquo;re younger,</p>
<p>but way back in the day, in the late 90s,</p>
<p>early mid 2000s of the internet,</p>
<p>the way that online kind of like shit talk worked was,</p>
<p>you were just trying to ramp up</p>
<p>to the most insanely edgy, crazy stuff you could say</p>
<p>to like provoke a reaction.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of something called the aristocrats?</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s like a joke, the joke?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the joke, yeah, there&rsquo;s a movie on it, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, basically every single like shit talk</p>
<p>back and forth on the internet was like that.</p>
<p>Like what is the most increasingly depraved,</p>
<p>and back then, you didn&rsquo;t get banned for slurs</p>
<p>or anything on any of these chat rooms.</p>
<p>So it was just like insane world to walk into.</p>
<p>And I was fully 100% a part of, a product of,</p>
<p>and a contributor to that world.</p>
<p>So that probably still goes on on the internet in some way,</p>
<p>and that probably still goes on in the internet</p>
<p>in a maybe more pacified way.</p>
<p>Only in darker parts of the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say for the most part, most,</p>
<p>well, compared to back then, compared to 20 years ago,</p>
<p>the internet is way cleaned up now.</p>
<p>There are still gonna be boards you can go on,</p>
<p>or parts of the internet where you see that type of humor,</p>
<p>but not, nowhere near as mainstream.</p>
<p>Like back then, you could open your mic on Xbox Live</p>
<p>and hear some insane stuff when that first started.</p>
<p>Nowhere near what you&rsquo;d hear today.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still elements of escalation that happen</p>
<p>that just seems to be part of human nature on the internet.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t get the feedback</p>
<p>of actually hurting people directly.</p>
<p>So the trolling, like for the lulz,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll do like whatever, like you will still escalate.</p>
<p>Within the bounds, you&rsquo;re just saying</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s more bounds now.</p>
<p>On Reddit, there&rsquo;s more bounds, and so on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s moderators that kind of yell at you,</p>
<p>that ban you, and so on, if you cross those bounds.</p>
<p>But overall, that basic human instinct to escalate,</p>
<p>especially under the veil of anonymity, is still there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s dark, it&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>Yeah, just, there&rsquo;s a lot of different ways to look at it,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s different ways you can break that arc.</p>
<p>Like for instance, like you mentioned dark humor,</p>
<p>and you say that like, sometimes dark humor is funny,</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s really important to dig into</p>
<p>and figure out like why certain things are funny,</p>
<p>and why certain things.</p>
<p>Can I give you an example?</p>
<p>Yeah, go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from your subreddit.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>No, that made me laugh, and I felt wrong about it.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>So this is a&hellip;</p>
<p>I already know what this is, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is a trolley problem.</p>
<p>To me, it connects because I think about the,</p>
<p>it keeps, because I worked on autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>the trolley problem, the philosophical thought experiment,</p>
<p>keeps brought up a lot.</p>
<p>When AI is part of making the decision,</p>
<p>do I kill three people here, or five people here,</p>
<p>and AI makes that decision, how do you do that calculus?</p>
<p>And this particular, there&rsquo;s a deep,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s satire that reveals some kind of flaw in society.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s what-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what dark humor does?</p>
<p>Successful dark humor does.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if this-</p>
<p>It reveals a flaw.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a certain brand of dark humor,</p>
<p>and I think the reason,</p>
<p>I think the reason is why it&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>or why it is good humor,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s because it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it necessarily reveals a flaw.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like it reveals a kind of virtue, I think.</p>
<p>If you look at this particular thing-</p>
<p>Can I explain what we&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Yeah, go for it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, sure. We&rsquo;re just listening.</p>
<p>The title of the Reddit post is,</p>
<p>you know what to pick.</p>
<p>And it says, five people are going to die either way,</p>
<p>but if you flip the lever,</p>
<p>the trolley will do a sick fucking loop first.</p>
<p>And also the top comment is a question saying,</p>
<p>which I think is also part of the dark humor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s successful.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Can I get the gender and ethnic backgrounds</p>
<p>of the groups first?</p>
<p>And the top answer is,</p>
<p>both groups are each comprised</p>
<p>of five white, orphaned, cis male,</p>
<p>heavy meth users who are consistently</p>
<p>in and out of drug rehab,</p>
<p>all who identify as right-wing extremists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a sophisticated thing that we engage in.</p>
<p>Humor is really complicated.</p>
<p>But I would argue that hopefully the humor here</p>
<p>shows the virtue of this is obviously horrible,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of why it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s such a horrible question to ask.</p>
<p>Do we kill five people in a boring way</p>
<p>or in a really entertaining way?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s really-</p>
<p>And then when you ask even more,</p>
<p>what are the ethnic backgrounds?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s even worse to say that.</p>
<p>So I feel like that&rsquo;s the type of-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a way that you can engage with dark humor</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, oof.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s so wrong and so taboo.</p>
<p>And we all know that it&rsquo;s wrong and taboo,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of where the shared laugh comes from.</p>
<p>So for me, the question,</p>
<p>asking the diversity question</p>
<p>is a sophisticated way of revealing the absurdity</p>
<p>of asking about diversity</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s talking about human life.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Because the way that I took that was,</p>
<p>I think it reveals the absurdity</p>
<p>of how people will weigh different ethnic backgrounds</p>
<p>so differently when it comes to value of human life.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m actually thinking of that</p>
<p>in terms of an immigration-related question,</p>
<p>where people are really keen and quick to dehumanize</p>
<p>black or brown people.</p>
<p>So the question is like,</p>
<p>well, if five of them are brown and five are white,</p>
<p>well, I know which one I&rsquo;m gonna pull the lever for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I read that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s satirizing that aspect.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I mean, that that&rsquo;s the flaw.</p>
<p>To me, at least, it showed that humanity</p>
<p>or social networks that are easy to be outraged</p>
<p>and love the outrage and the chaos,</p>
<p>that Twitter and social networks will pull that lever.</p>
<p>Like, they would always try to maximize the fun.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sick aspect to all the atrocities,</p>
<p>all the tragedies that happen in the world</p>
<p>that we kind of always lean towards</p>
<p>the outrageous narrative weaved around it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the one that leads to sort of the most clicks,</p>
<p>to the most attention, to the most outrage,</p>
<p>to all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s almost like a satire of society.</p>
<p>When they are faced with tragedy, they will maximize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of a word that&rsquo;s not fun, but-</p>
<p>Entertainment.</p>
<p>Maximize the entertainment, yeah.</p>
<p>This is a big criticism I give,</p>
<p>especially to conservative crowds.</p>
<p>Left-leaning people, everybody does it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like when people blame the media</p>
<p>for the state of the media today.</p>
<p>I very much believe that everything in society</p>
<p>is a feedback loop, and that if you&rsquo;re really unhappy</p>
<p>with the state of the media,</p>
<p>I think that the media is a good reflection</p>
<p>for what people wanna see.</p>
<p>Because there is a room right now in the United States</p>
<p>where somebody could start a company</p>
<p>where all they do is completely factual reporting,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a political slant,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not giving you these</p>
<p>sensationalist narratives or stories,</p>
<p>and that media company would fail in two weeks,</p>
<p>because people don&rsquo;t wanna see that, generally.</p>
<p>People really wanna see the,</p>
<p>show me the guy that really believes in what I say,</p>
<p>that calls the other guy an idiot,</p>
<p>the guy that are screaming on TV or on the radio,</p>
<p>like, this is what I really want.</p>
<p>And people will engage in that,</p>
<p>and that feedback loop will continue for generations.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden people are like,</p>
<p>why is the media so biased?</p>
<p>Why is the media driving so many narratives?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, what do you mean?</p>
<p>This is exactly what you wanna see.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s frustrating for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of my big, kind of,</p>
<p>when I defend establishments,</p>
<p>or when I talk about the interplay between citizen</p>
<p>and all these institutions we have,</p>
<p>that the institutions are very much a reflection</p>
<p>of the population, at least in democratic societies.</p>
<p>And I think that people very much try to elude</p>
<p>the personal responsibility</p>
<p>or the country&rsquo;s responsibility</p>
<p>to why some of them look the way that they do.</p>
<p>But that takes us back to the N word with a hard R.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>For the particular examples that I was given,</p>
<p>or for the particular conversations that I was having,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna have challenging conversations</p>
<p>around certain words,</p>
<p>I think you should probably be able to say them,</p>
<p>otherwise it feels really ridiculous to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like my-</p>
<p>Do you still believe that?</p>
<p>For, yes.</p>
<p>And not like calling people those words,</p>
<p>but in having conversations about those words,</p>
<p>I would say that I still believe that, yeah.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think, as you said,</p>
<p>that using those words</p>
<p>actually gives motivation and strength</p>
<p>to people who have hate in their hearts?</p>
<p>I think, depending on the context of what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s gonna be a big driver</p>
<p>in terms of how people are going to perceive or take it.</p>
<p>So, in a conversation about the N word,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would normally say the N word,</p>
<p>we would just talk about the word,</p>
<p>much the same way that, say, like in a movie,</p>
<p>like in Django, people use the N word.</p>
<p>Should that be censored in that movie,</p>
<p>or in the context of that movie,</p>
<p>is it being employed in a way</p>
<p>where these aren&rsquo;t good people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not supposed to like them,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the audience walks away with?</p>
<p>Yeah, but that context is different in the conversation.</p>
<p>It feels like in conversation,</p>
<p>you using that word normalizes it.</p>
<p>And normalizing that word is going to make it easier</p>
<p>for people who use that word in a hateful way to use it.</p>
<p>Same with the F word, the F slur.</p>
<p>If you use that casually and normalize it</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s not hateful,</p>
<p>you use it in a way that&rsquo;s not hateful,</p>
<p>but the side effect is that it normalizes it,</p>
<p>then people who do use it in a hateful way</p>
<p>will be more likely to use it.</p>
<p>Therefore, mathematically looking at the equation</p>
<p>of the number of times the N word or the F word</p>
<p>is used throughout the world,</p>
<p>it increases the number of times it&rsquo;s used in a hateful way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that human beings-</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re a part of that problem, Steven.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>I understand the thought process,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if using certain words</p>
<p>within different contexts is going to necessarily normalize</p>
<p>the hateful use of that word.</p>
<p>That is an argument that I&rsquo;ve heard people use.</p>
<p>Somebody will say like, okay, well, hold on.</p>
<p>That should never be used ever</p>
<p>because by virtue of you normalizing it,</p>
<p>even in an inoffensive environment,</p>
<p>you increase the proclivity for people to use it</p>
<p>in a potentially more offensive environment.</p>
<p>My argument is always that like,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t think that crossover exists,</p>
<p>but if you did want to take that argument,</p>
<p>and maybe you do feel this way,</p>
<p>I think that you get really problematic</p>
<p>when you run into communities that do use certain words</p>
<p>that people would say, well, they should be allowed to do it.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you think that any utterance</p>
<p>of the N word at all is highly problematic</p>
<p>and might increase hatred,</p>
<p>then the entire rap industry has to dramatically change</p>
<p>the way that they engage with the N word.</p>
<p>And obviously a lot of people that criticize</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s use of the N word aren&rsquo;t gonna turn to rappers</p>
<p>and say, well, you guys can&rsquo;t say it either.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s who, I mean, it&rsquo;s who uses the N word,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what, it&rsquo;s not, so it&rsquo;s not just the word,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the, it is context dependent,</p>
<p>but I would say that you as a white person</p>
<p>having conversations, the context there</p>
<p>is the kind that would lead to an increase in hate.</p>
<p>Do you think the N word should be censored in the dictionary?</p>
<p>No, and I believe there&rsquo;s a Wikipedia page on it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not censored.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t, I think it should be in the dictionary.</p>
<p>I think the context of casual conversation,</p>
<p>like I said, I just believe that on the internet,</p>
<p>having humor, having fun conversations as you have</p>
<p>on your streams, that leads to the normalization</p>
<p>of the word without any educational value,</p>
<p>without significant educational value.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would agree with that.</p>
<p>I think I would, I think I would agree with that.</p>
<p>No, sorry, so there&rsquo;s a difference between F slur</p>
<p>and N word and both I think should not be used</p>
<p>in a fun way, but the F word was used in a fun way</p>
<p>for the longest time.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you something that bothers me</p>
<p>about your streams, not your stream,</p>
<p>your streams and basically every other stream</p>
<p>is the casual use of the R word.</p>
<p>Oh, the ableism, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s about the able,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know, listen, it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like virtue signaling here.</p>
<p>No, ableism isn&rsquo;t virtue signaling.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a legitimate, yeah.</p>
<p>Like I get emails from fans that say like,</p>
<p>hey, like I deal with this particular issue.</p>
<p>Every time you use this word,</p>
<p>it kind of feels like you&rsquo;re attacking me.</p>
<p>Like just like, so it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s a valid concept, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something cuts wrong for me.</p>
<p>Like for example, I&rsquo;m not bothered by,</p>
<p>I am bothered by the excessive use of the word fuck.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But not.</p>
<p>In the same way that.</p>
<p>Moderate use of the word fuck.</p>
<p>What is it, I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>and when somebody calls somebody an R word,</p>
<p>what is it that, what is the feeling that you get</p>
<p>that makes you feel bad about it?</p>
<p>It signals to me that you don&rsquo;t give a damn about</p>
<p>people who are struggling</p>
<p>in ways that you are not struggling.</p>
<p>Like that, that signals to me.</p>
<p>Like about the experience of others.</p>
<p>Do you think that there are other words also</p>
<p>that could convey like a similar feeling to you,</p>
<p>or why, because it feels like you&rsquo;ve drawn</p>
<p>a pretty special circle around,</p>
<p>because like I imagine, oh, this guy&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an uneducated dumb fuck,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a networker.</p>
<p>Like, those words probably don&rsquo;t feel it.</p>
<p>That circle keeps changing.</p>
<p>Which it can, which is fine, it does.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what the whole point with the culture.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to feel, my feeling is a kind of,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m a human being that exists</p>
<p>in a social context that we&rsquo;re all evolving</p>
<p>that language together and just feels wrong.</p>
<p>Like, you know, the word bitch, for example,</p>
<p>it really, like I&rsquo;ve heard on your streams</p>
<p>and in general, calling a woman a stupid bitch</p>
<p>really bothers me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just the word bitch, it&rsquo;s context.</p>
<p>Like, for example, me personally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking to me personally,</p>
<p>like badass bitch is different than stupid bitch.</p>
<p>Way different.</p>
<p>Sure, like a bad bitch or something is different than,</p>
<p>yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Way different.</p>
<p>I think it speaks to a bigger sense of civility</p>
<p>and respect for human beings that are not like you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, that&rsquo;s the feeling that I&rsquo;m bothering.</p>
<p>So I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say here is,</p>
<p>just because people speak in this kind of way</p>
<p>in the gaming world and in streams,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that you, like a lot of people look up to you.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean, young people especially,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that you don&rsquo;t have the responsibility</p>
<p>to sort of stand alone from the crowd.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re somebody that values</p>
<p>the power of effective discourse.</p>
<p>And to be effective discourse,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some level of civility.</p>
<p>So you can be the sort of the beacon of civility</p>
<p>in that world versus giving in to the derogatory words.</p>
<p>Because like, you have to lift people out of that world,</p>
<p>out of the muck of, what I would say is like drama</p>
<p>in effective discourse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I think that&rsquo;s one of your missions, right?</p>
<p>Is like to inspire the world through conversation,</p>
<p>through debate, through effective discourse.</p>
<p>So I guess I&rsquo;m just calling out that I think using our word,</p>
<p>for me personally, as a fan that believes in your mission,</p>
<p>it just makes you look ineffective and bad</p>
<p>and uninspiring to young people that look up to you.</p>
<p>Because those young people are going to use those words</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re using, and they&rsquo;ll do it much less effectively.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess the challenge is always just like</p>
<p>finding the line.</p>
<p>Like my vocabulary shifted dramatically from,</p>
<p>even from like two or three years ago,</p>
<p>I think my vocabulary shifted quite a bit</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve kind of gotten rid of some words</p>
<p>and some things are kind of coming out.</p>
<p>The R word is one that has kind of gone out and come back</p>
<p>and gone out and come back.</p>
<p>That one we&rsquo;ve definitely gone back and forth on.</p>
<p>I know there are different thoughts about it</p>
<p>in different communities on the internet.</p>
<p>This is interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just telling you, for me, it cuts,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not a social justice warrior type,</p>
<p>it cuts pretty hard.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re saying is I&rsquo;m going to lose a subscriber</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m, no, it&rsquo;s not a subscriber.</p>
<p>I actually have to empathize harder</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, maybe this is not a very good person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I feel.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re so carelessly using that word,</p>
<p>then maybe you&rsquo;re not actually thinking deeply</p>
<p>about the suffering in the world.</p>
<p>Like to be a student of human nature,</p>
<p>you really have to think about other humans</p>
<p>and other experiences that are unlike your own.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the sense I get.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you&rsquo;re also like the grandpa,</p>
<p>I mean, ageist, who&rsquo;s trying to be cool with the young kids.</p>
<p>A lot of the reason young kids look up to you</p>
<p>is like you also know the language of the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, that&rsquo;s not an excuse</p>
<p>to use words that we think shouldn&rsquo;t be used.</p>
<p>I guess the question that I would have,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s always a struggle,</p>
<p>and to some extent it&rsquo;s kind of happened,</p>
<p>is let&rsquo;s say that like three years ago,</p>
<p>I would have said I&rsquo;m no longer saying the R word.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to get rid of that in my vocabulary.</p>
<p>Like is there a chance that today</p>
<p>we would be having a conversation about like,</p>
<p>why do you call people dumb fucks?</p>
<p>Like is that really appropriate?</p>
<p>Like does this attack at the core</p>
<p>of like somebody&rsquo;s like level of intelligence,</p>
<p>education, opportunities in life, like, is that worthy?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think so?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a, as the kids say, cope.</p>
<p>You really think so?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Because the words have definitely moved in a way</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, this was okay, now it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>this is okay, now it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re standing your ground by using,</p>
<p>listen, you could, you could, you could.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s better to use those words,</p>
<p>if you want to defend the ground words stand on,</p>
<p>to use them rarely and deliberately</p>
<p>versus how you currently use them,</p>
<p>which is to express an emotion.</p>
<p>Like you, I&rsquo;m going to be honest,</p>
<p>you use R word, not when you&rsquo;re at your best.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s generally, that can be true</p>
<p>for a lot of swearing too though.</p>
<p>But yeah, I know what you mean.</p>
<p>No, but like, you know that R word is offensive, you know?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s part of it is like the,</p>
<p>you tell yourself that like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still kind of fighting political correctness</p>
<p>by using it a little bit when you say it.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think, I&rsquo;m trying to think in terms of like,</p>
<p>where is the virtue, where,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of arguments</p>
<p>for why some words are okay,</p>
<p>some words aren&rsquo;t okay or whatever.</p>
<p>And I try to like think more along those lines rather than,</p>
<p>but like, there&rsquo;s going to be like a lot of phrases</p>
<p>where like, if the R word has come out,</p>
<p>the conversation is over.</p>
<p>Like, I know that, like things,</p>
<p>my brain is shut down, the person I&rsquo;m talking to is,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a lot of words also</p>
<p>in terms of like, it like,</p>
<p>if you ever hear me say like fucking moron in a debate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Like this conversation is over.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that anything productive</p>
<p>is happening past that point.</p>
<p>I think fucking moron is not,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s ineffective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not civil, but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t bother me in a way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically when you speak in a way</p>
<p>that I know there&rsquo;s a group that&rsquo;s going to be hurt by that.</p>
<p>Not only do I think about the hurt that group experiences,</p>
<p>I think of you as a lesser intellectual,</p>
<p>like as a lesser person who&rsquo;s thinking about the world.</p>
<p>What bothers me the most is just what kind of mindset</p>
<p>that inspires in young people,</p>
<p>or especially when you&rsquo;re a public figure</p>
<p>and a lot of people look up to you.</p>
<p>So I definitely don&rsquo;t think sort of this idea,</p>
<p>the R word is not the battleground</p>
<p>of expanding the Overton window of discourse, okay?</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll lead to dumb fuck being canceled</p>
<p>two years later, unless that word</p>
<p>is hurting people&rsquo;s experience,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t foresee that happening.</p>
<p>I think legitimately R word and F slur</p>
<p>and calling women bitches,</p>
<p>context matters here too, like of course,</p>
<p>but just the way I&rsquo;ve heard you use it,</p>
<p>it is not, it&rsquo;s from emotion and it&rsquo;s from frustration</p>
<p>and it ultimately is rooted in disrespect.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s ineffective.</p>
<p>And of course, like who gets to say, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m saying somebody who,</p>
<p>I admire effective conversations</p>
<p>and I admire great humor, dark humor, wit.</p>
<p>To me, oftentimes the use of the R word</p>
<p>in the way you&rsquo;ve used it in the way I see the community</p>
<p>use it is none of those things.</p>
<p>It contributes not at all to the humor and so on.</p>
<p>Now I could see it might contribute</p>
<p>to the camaraderie of that particular group,</p>
<p>especially when they normalize the use of that word.</p>
<p>You kind of take some of the edge off,</p>
<p>but you forget that there&rsquo;s a large number of other people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have the chemistry,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t hear the music of the friendship that you have,</p>
<p>the relationship you have.</p>
<p>And instead they hear the normalization of a hateful word</p>
<p>and it ultimately has an impact that&rsquo;s hateful.</p>
<p>And then people like me who show up,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched much of your stuff.</p>
<p>It turns me off from,</p>
<p>a couple of times your content came before me</p>
<p>and I listened to it a little bit, it turned me off</p>
<p>completely, I didn&rsquo;t understand how good your heart is.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand how your mission of actually</p>
<p>de-radicalize people, help people,</p>
<p>and increase the level of good faith discourse in the world.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand any of that,</p>
<p>because what I was hearing is pretty rough,</p>
<p>like the R-word type of stuff.</p>
<p>And I just feel like the benefit-cost analysis</p>
<p>is heavy on the cost.</p>
<p>So I just have to sort of call this out.</p>
<p>And I straight up think it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Why do you think it&rsquo;s wrong?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s hurting people</p>
<p>without any benefit to you whatsoever.</p>
<p>When you say hurting people,</p>
<p>do you mean the person I&rsquo;m using it at</p>
<p>or do you think there&rsquo;s like the affected third group?</p>
<p>The third group.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good feedback, right?</p>
<p>I always consider everything,</p>
<p>especially I respect you a lot, you&rsquo;re a really smart guy.</p>
<p>Something that I always kind of like fight over</p>
<p>in terms of like language or like who to attack</p>
<p>or what to attack or what to do</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s very hard to draw like what boxes</p>
<p>are okay to insult people on versus what aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So for instance, if I call somebody like a Nazi</p>
<p>with a lot of vitriol, I am okay with every single Nazi</p>
<p>being negatively affected by that,</p>
<p>because that category intrinsically calls upon it</p>
<p>some level of more condemnation for me, right?</p>
<p>Whereas like if I&rsquo;m out there,</p>
<p>I try not to do like image related jokes, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to call you like,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re a fat fucking loser,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of people that are fat</p>
<p>that are overweight where I don&rsquo;t want them to feel bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them, I&rsquo;m not trying to call you out</p>
<p>or like insult you.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a lot of, you say cost benefit.</p>
<p>I look at like a lot of collateral damage</p>
<p>from a word like that,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no purpose in doing that.</p>
<p>So certain words are easy to get rid of.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re off the table, right?</p>
<p>EPSILER, N-word, like these are not words you call people</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much collateral, it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some words where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if you have some form of like mental thing,</p>
<p>it is a bad thing, you&rsquo;re not a bad person,</p>
<p>but just using that word</p>
<p>could feel like a collateral damage to those people.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s other categories of words.</p>
<p>So like, if I say that like,</p>
<p>this person is like, it&rsquo;s a stupid fucking Republican,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably some Republicans that aren&rsquo;t dumb,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t want to feel called out by that.</p>
<p>Like, are those types of phrases that you think</p>
<p>should be completely removed as well?</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m kind of curious.</p>
<p>This completely removed, just so we&rsquo;re clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not referring to censorship.</p>
<p>Oh no, I&rsquo;m not even talking about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a person like emotionally like.</p>
<p>Removed is the wrong word though.</p>
<p>Like I care about like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to listen to people on the internet</p>
<p>saying like, you shouldn&rsquo;t say that word, that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m trying to look to your mind and heart.</p>
<p>And the reason we&rsquo;re talking today</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re betraying your gift.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re better than this.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s indicative of like,</p>
<p>a more flippant thought process</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, the only way you can say that word</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re ignoring the hurt and suffering of those people.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody that says-</p>
<p>Not even those people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ignoring the state of language.</p>
<p>Because I think you&rsquo;re getting to the point,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not about a single word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about like, it&rsquo;s music.</p>
<p>And I just feel like there is a-</p>
<p>Very strong note.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strong note that ruins the melody.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I can say,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t use the R-word or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just speaking to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just listening to music and reviewing the final result.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily,</p>
<p>because maybe one use of the R-word strategically</p>
<p>or part of an actual like,</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;ve built up a camaraderie</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sandwiched in like, some love,</p>
<p>but then you try to reveal their,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re talking about a lot of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of drama.</p>
<p>You have friends with whom you&rsquo;re worrying and stuff,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all a little bit beautifully insane.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve said that you are becoming more and more insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the human condition laid before us.</p>
<p>Wonderful.</p>
<p>And some of that is swearing and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a tricky thing.</p>
<p>But the whole skill of discourse,</p>
<p>just like it is with dark humor,</p>
<p>is walking that line.</p>
<p>I just feel like it&rsquo;s a overuse of the R-word.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to die in that ground,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that representative.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s certain things like that,</p>
<p>it feels like it ruins the music.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same like a dumb Republican or a dumb Democrat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, yeah, that ruins it too a little bit.</p>
<p>Depends on how you use it.</p>
<p>You can be lazy with that.</p>
<p>You know, like even overuse of the word,</p>
<p>I think bots is what&rsquo;s used for people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t think or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually know the definition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m offended on behalf of robots.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>That might be a compliment soon.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>But I guess bot means you don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re like an NPC.</p>
<p>You just copy and paste.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m offended on behalf of NPCs.</p>
<p>I count myself as one.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a sense if you say bots too much,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just dismissing people.</p>
<p>Like everything I say is right.</p>
<p>And anyone that disagrees with me is a bot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s lazy too.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>Basically saying a lot of people in the mainstream media</p>
<p>or something like that are bots.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s, a little bit of that is effective.</p>
<p>But too much, it becomes ineffective.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to speak to that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just, the reason we&rsquo;re highlighting clear examples</p>
<p>like the N word, Joe Rogan had to contend with that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s ineffective.</p>
<p>It makes you less effective at this course.</p>
<p>But like you&rsquo;ve talked about many times,</p>
<p>language is a tricky one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always hard</p>
<p>because you talk about like constructing a melody.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one melody that sounds good to everyone.</p>
<p>But there are probably certain notes</p>
<p>that like if you got rid of them,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s still gonna like it about as much</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t really lose anything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole other part of an audience</p>
<p>that might be more willing to listen, of course.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not about losing the magic of that melody.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t wanna be vanilla.</p>
<p>I just feel like there&rsquo;s stuff</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t need to be there.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fat.</p>
<p>But then again, you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the other thing that people should understand</p>
<p>that might be listening to this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re streaming many hours a day for many years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s 11 or 12, I think, yeah.</p>
<p>Started in 2010.</p>
<p>And so one of the things that people can do</p>
<p>is just clip out anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going through the full human experience of emotion,</p>
<p>anger, fear, frustration, all of it.</p>
<p>So of course, there&rsquo;s going to be moments</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>Anything else to say about the language?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still always trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>There are opinions that I have</p>
<p>that have changed throughout the years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the R word has always been</p>
<p>the next one on the chopping block</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all kind of looking at,</p>
<p>but people are always worried about that treadmill.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible in a year or two,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have a different view on it</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll have changed away some of the words I use.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely like a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always like a work in progress.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always like different communities</p>
<p>that feel different ways about different words, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but do you acknowledge that there&rsquo;s people out there</p>
<p>that are never gonna talk to you?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re never gonna think of you as a good man</p>
<p>because you used the N word with a hard R publicly.</p>
<p>In the past?</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, those people exist,</p>
<p>but I mean, there are some people that are beyond my reach,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m okay with.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s gonna be some people</p>
<p>because of things that have been involved,</p>
<p>or even ideas that I have now</p>
<p>that might make them beyond my reach.</p>
<p>Something you said earlier was very true.</p>
<p>I think the goal is to like identify</p>
<p>what are the elements that you can cut out</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t integral to your message,</p>
<p>but could be alienating to more people.</p>
<p>And those are probably the things that you identify.</p>
<p>But I think that you can get lost in yourself,</p>
<p>or lost in the internet,</p>
<p>or lost in the outside of yourself</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to appeal to every single person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just never gonna be the case.</p>
<p>And for, I actually, I like that I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>the journey that I&rsquo;ve had on the internet,</p>
<p>that you can find me saying and defending</p>
<p>a lot of insane stuff 10 years ago,</p>
<p>because I think it shows like a level of progress.</p>
<p>And I think I do get a lot of respect</p>
<p>and buy-in to certain communities</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m not just some random dude</p>
<p>telling you that like,</p>
<p>oh, you shouldn&rsquo;t say the F word or the N word.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a guy that&rsquo;s been there, that&rsquo;s done it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s defended it, and you can see my whole past,</p>
<p>my whole history is laid bare for you</p>
<p>to watch every thousands of hours of it.</p>
<p>But I can show that like there&rsquo;s growth</p>
<p>and evolution and change that can happen in a person, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you&rsquo;re honest about that growth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky thing,</p>
<p>because people just call,</p>
<p>bring up stuff from your past, right?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I hope we figure out as a civilization</p>
<p>a mechanism to clearly say this was me two years ago,</p>
<p>this was me five years ago.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a different person.</p>
<p>And like, because Twitter doesn&rsquo;t care about that.</p>
<p>These social mechanisms that bring stuff up</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one stupid thing you say,</p>
<p>it becomes like a scarlet letter.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to fight that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tricky to fight that.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen Men in Black?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When KJ on the bench and he says a person is smart,</p>
<p>but people are stupid, dumb, finicky animals or whatever,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that changes for human dynamics</p>
<p>when there is a group of people</p>
<p>that make it so hard to control.</p>
<p>I think one-on-one, anybody can sit across from somebody</p>
<p>and admit to some horrible stuff.</p>
<p>I used to be, I abused my husband when I was 20,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m 35 and I see it&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>or I did this, I was addicted to whatever,</p>
<p>and I made these mistakes.</p>
<p>One-on-one, it&rsquo;s always easy.</p>
<p>But in group environments, that in-group, out-group,</p>
<p>tribalistic thing of identifying one thing</p>
<p>and then coming to destroy a person&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>is such a huge impulse we have.</p>
<p>And I think probably when we were hunter-gatherers</p>
<p>in the forest, it&rsquo;s probably good,</p>
<p>because you really want to push weird people out</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>But now on the internet,</p>
<p>when we can hunt for any dissenting opinion</p>
<p>and just with ruthless precision</p>
<p>destroy somebody&rsquo;s life over it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty scary dynamic.</p>
<p>I think one of the mechanisms that could fix it</p>
<p>is make it super easy for each individual person</p>
<p>to analyze all the stupid shit</p>
<p>they themselves have said in the past.</p>
<p>Like a full recording.</p>
<p>Because I think people are just honestly</p>
<p>paint a very rosy picture to their own brain</p>
<p>of who they have been in the past.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>If we can have empathy for the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve said stupid shit,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re drunk, the ridiculous things you say,</p>
<p>the offensive things you might&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>the offensive things you might&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>I just feel like that would give us</p>
<p>the ammunition to have empathy for others</p>
<p>that are like, okay, yeah, this guy five years ago said this.</p>
<p>Maybe that doesn&rsquo;t represent who they are</p>
<p>any more than stuff I said five years ago</p>
<p>represents who I am today.</p>
<p>I feel like technology can actually enable that.</p>
<p>Maybe, although you&rsquo;re talking about more recording</p>
<p>and more stuff which people are already wary of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>I think there is going to be more and more recording.</p>
<p>We have to figure out how to do that</p>
<p>in the way that respects people&rsquo;s privacy</p>
<p>and gives them ownership of their data and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at the search history I&rsquo;ve done on Google,</p>
<p>which for most people is available,</p>
<p>like your Google search history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to watch the evolution of a human being.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like the same person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a different person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also hard, too, with the internet today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be ageist again,</p>
<p>but now all of the people are thrown together,</p>
<p>whereas I don&rsquo;t want a 27-year-old judging</p>
<p>the language of a 15 or 16-year-old.</p>
<p>Obviously, he&rsquo;s in high school.</p>
<p>There is that story that came out of the,</p>
<p>there was a kid that saved a recording of,</p>
<p>I think it was some white girl.</p>
<p>I think that she got her driver&rsquo;s license</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like, I can drive now, N words,</p>
<p>with the A or whatever.</p>
<p>It was dumb.</p>
<p>She shouldn&rsquo;t have said it,</p>
<p>but I think she was like 15 or 16</p>
<p>when she TikToked this or whatever,</p>
<p>and he held on to that recording</p>
<p>until she applied and got accepted to college</p>
<p>three years later, and then he released it</p>
<p>to get her kicked out of college,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, damn.</p>
<p>Everything that I had ever said as like a 15, 16-year-old</p>
<p>was like immortalized on the internet.</p>
<p>My life wouldn&rsquo;t have even begun,</p>
<p>and those are insanely high standards to hold people to.</p>
<p>Not that, like obviously you shouldn&rsquo;t be saying those,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t be saying certain words or whatever,</p>
<p>but you have to be able to make mistakes in adolescence</p>
<p>like everybody does.</p>
<p>We all did.</p>
<p>Everybody did it growing up, you know?</p>
<p>Why do you think there is so much misogyny</p>
<p>in the streaming community,</p>
<p>and how can you fight it?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve shown a lot of interest in fighting it,</p>
<p>trying to decrease or eliminate misogyny</p>
<p>from your community.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>I think that eliminating racism</p>
<p>is easier than eliminating misogyny,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>On the internet, you mean?</p>
<p>You mean anywhere, because I think fundamentally,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s that much difference</p>
<p>between like white people and black people</p>
<p>and brown people and Asian people or whatever.</p>
<p>You know, we have different cultures and stuff,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day, we&rsquo;re all people,</p>
<p>but I think there are differences between men and women,</p>
<p>like throughout all of history and time,</p>
<p>and then even today in every culture,</p>
<p>and when real differences do exist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s harder to account for them in a way</p>
<p>that can we have conversations with each other</p>
<p>without it becoming very gendered in a negative way, right?</p>
<p>Negative way of gendering something</p>
<p>would be like a misogynistic way of doing it.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s unclear to me that it&rsquo;s so difficult</p>
<p>to avoid the negative gendering versus the positive,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of positive to the tension,</p>
<p>the dance between the different genders and so on.</p>
<p>Maybe in this particular moment in history, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not trivial to me that racism</p>
<p>is easier to eliminate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting hypothesis,</p>
<p>just because there&rsquo;s more biological difference</p>
<p>between men and women.</p>
<p>That means it&rsquo;s harder to eliminate, but-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is true.</p>
<p>I hear this a lot.</p>
<p>I read this somewhere,</p>
<p>but I need to get a better source</p>
<p>before I repeat it everywhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that in the US military, for instance,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve gotten exceedingly well,</p>
<p>they do an exceedingly good job</p>
<p>at getting different people of different races to integrate,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a huge problem</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re through basic training,</p>
<p>all the training, everything.</p>
<p>But for different sexes,</p>
<p>it still represents a significant problem</p>
<p>that the military hasn&rsquo;t figured out.</p>
<p>And I actually looked at like,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s the military doing?</p>
<p>Because if something was solvable,</p>
<p>like can we sleep for four hours a night and be healthy?</p>
<p>If we could, I bet the military would know.</p>
<p>So I kind of look sometimes at them</p>
<p>to see their integration,</p>
<p>it might be that there are other issues there</p>
<p>that make it kind of-</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels like the military</p>
<p>is a very particular kind of-</p>
<p>For sure, yeah, it could be.</p>
<p>The actual task at hand</p>
<p>might bias the difficulty of the process.</p>
<p>Potentially, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of interesting talk</p>
<p>about like women integrating into male groups,</p>
<p>and how do you do this in a way</p>
<p>where everybody is happy with the outcome</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not like issues.</p>
<p>I think Jordan Peterson spoke about this a little bit,</p>
<p>and then Workplace Culture speaks about this a bit.</p>
<p>Would you happen to remember,</p>
<p>I wanna say it was like five or 10 years ago,</p>
<p>there was a big tech conference,</p>
<p>and there were two guys behind a woman,</p>
<p>and they made a joke about like a USB dongle,</p>
<p>like dongle was a dick.</p>
<p>And this woman turned around,</p>
<p>she tweeted pictures of them,</p>
<p>spoke about like misogyny,</p>
<p>and then that blew up into a huge ordeal that like, yeah.</p>
<p>There was this interesting phenomenon</p>
<p>that in a less misogynistic</p>
<p>and more inclusive workplace environment,</p>
<p>some women might end up feeling worse,</p>
<p>because in a more misogynistic environment,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking like, okay, that&rsquo;s a woman,</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t get our humor,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna treat her in a very indifferent,</p>
<p>very dispassionate, cold way, and whatever,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m gonna have my boys over here.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got like these environments</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re a little bit more warmer,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, oh cool,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna bring this woman into our environment,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna make all the same types</p>
<p>of like crass jokes we did before,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually worse now.</p>
<p>Now the woman feels even more otherwise,</p>
<p>because like, oh my God, why do you talk like this?</p>
<p>I think that internet communities,</p>
<p>especially online ones that do like political debate</p>
<p>and video games, are very much like big boys clubs.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not enough to just say,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be misogynistic to get rid of misogyny,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always gonna be an othering effect on women.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of like behaviors that are unintuitive</p>
<p>that you have to account for,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve gotta try to like push that back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a very, very, very challenging thing to do.</p>
<p>So I like to deal with concrete examples more.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a concrete example.</p>
<p>And this is like a recent initiative in my community,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to like be,</p>
<p>because misogyny hasn&rsquo;t been fixed</p>
<p>anywhere on the internet, and I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>well, there are ways that I can push my community to do this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you should almost ever make a comment</p>
<p>on a woman&rsquo;s appearance, ever,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re appearing in like some political</p>
<p>or professional manner.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s a positive comment,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s equally bad to a negative comment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just never good to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of an unintuitive thing,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, well, a woman appears,</p>
<p>wow, she&rsquo;s really cute.</p>
<p>It seems like a nice comment, you&rsquo;re being nice,</p>
<p>you know, she looks cute or whatever,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s not at all the point</p>
<p>of why she&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And just by saying that, you&rsquo;re kind of like</p>
<p>otherizing her as like a person to like,</p>
<p>think she looks good, rather than listening</p>
<p>to anything she has to say, you know?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>and that is a part of misogyny,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost like obvious,</p>
<p>like any woman will tell you that.</p>
<p>Woman will, yeah, but they&rsquo;re not in these spaces,</p>
<p>and a lot of the guys don&rsquo;t know, yeah.</p>
<p>But I think what that requires is just empathy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need, you need to consider the female experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, like you have to either read about</p>
<p>or talk with women.</p>
<p>You learn, like the low-hanging fruit</p>
<p>is very easy to learn.</p>
<p>It feels like just the level of social skill,</p>
<p>oftentimes, in internet communities is quite low.</p>
<p>I disagree, I don&rsquo;t like to say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem with empathy,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s very hard to have empathy for experiences</p>
<p>that are so outside of your own.</p>
<p>Well, maybe some people, there might be some people</p>
<p>that can do it, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that I had to learn.</p>
<p>Women are half the population.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re women, they&rsquo;re totally different.</p>
<p>Totally different.</p>
<p>So here, we talk about, yeah, yeah, here&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not totally different.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an example, okay?</p>
<p>So, especially for me, my archetype makes up</p>
<p>a lot of the internet, white man.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never been a point.</p>
<p>The name of a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Who might be a dancer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the backstory, from New Orleans, or from?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought that through yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s ambiguous, okay?</p>
<p>Like an open world.</p>
<p>An open world, I want you to project wherever you want</p>
<p>Destiny the Dancer to be from, that&rsquo;s in your mind, okay?</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll save that for later tonight.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>As a white guy, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s ever been a spot</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been in, where I&rsquo;ve been made to feel like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t belong there, just by virtue of who I am.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I actually don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s impossible for me</p>
<p>to empathize with that,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t even have that experience.</p>
<p>If you go back eight, nine years,</p>
<p>one of the big issues that came up</p>
<p>was harassment in gaming against women.</p>
<p>And I was one of the big debaters against that,</p>
<p>saying that like, sure, women might get harassment,</p>
<p>but everybody gets harassment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a woman, and you&rsquo;re in gaming,</p>
<p>and you get harassed, congratulations,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being treated like a man.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re actually asking for</p>
<p>is for us to actually treat you differently.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be insulted.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be treated like a man.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually misogyny, is women making that argument.</p>
<p>Do you still stand by that?</p>
<p>Is that a problem if I do?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Okay, almost, hold on.</p>
<p>So a little while after.</p>
<p>I disagree with it.</p>
<p>Sure, okay, that&rsquo;s good, you should.</p>
<p>A little while later, I had a friend, Jessica,</p>
<p>super cool girl, we go to play games.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s between jobs, and she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got like two months, and we&rsquo;re gonna grind CSGO.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, this is awesome, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>CSGO, Counter-Strike, Global Offensive,</p>
<p>shooter game, FPS, microphones.</p>
<p>First day, we start playing, okay?</p>
<p>Hop into our first game.</p>
<p>Obviously, she talks, everybody&rsquo;s making,</p>
<p>is that a 12-year-old boy?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you making sandwiches?</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah, yeah, okay, whatever.</p>
<p>Play our first game.</p>
<p>Play our second game, same jokes.</p>
<p>Third game, fourth game.</p>
<p>By like the fourth or fifth game,</p>
<p>I was actually starting to feel triggered.</p>
<p>Like every time the game started, I was like,</p>
<p>can you just like talk so we can get over</p>
<p>like the stupid fucking jokes?</p>
<p>It was so fucking stupid.</p>
<p>And you hear the same fucking joke every single time.</p>
<p>And it took one day of that experience</p>
<p>for me to realize it&rsquo;s not about being insulted,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this othering feeling that you don&rsquo;t belong.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never felt that, because I&rsquo;m a white guy.</p>
<p>Not to be like virtue signaling,</p>
<p>but like there&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s no places</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re white, you don&rsquo;t belong here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a guy, you don&rsquo;t belong here.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve never felt that non-inclusion.</p>
<p>And playing with her, there&rsquo;s a different feeling</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s the same types of jokes</p>
<p>coming from a group of people</p>
<p>to make you feel like you don&rsquo;t belong there,</p>
<p>where I was like, damn, this actually feels really bad.</p>
<p>And it feels bad in a different way,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, if you call me like an F slur</p>
<p>or any other type of swear word or insult,</p>
<p>like, yeah, you can call me that.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all kind of the same.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all white dudes and we call each other names.</p>
<p>But like, this is a woman and this is not her place</p>
<p>and she doesn&rsquo;t belong here.</p>
<p>Kind of the analogy that I would make,</p>
<p>because after getting these experiences,</p>
<p>I would learn this afterwards.</p>
<p>If I tell you that there&rsquo;s another guy in a room</p>
<p>and you need to think of the worst insults</p>
<p>ever for that person,</p>
<p>without ever knowing anything about them or meeting them,</p>
<p>if I tell you that it&rsquo;s like a white straight guy</p>
<p>and you have to write insults, you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>Maybe you can do like school shooter,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not really much you can say</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>But if I tell you it&rsquo;s a woman,</p>
<p>we could, there are so many different jokes you can write.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a black person,</p>
<p>so many different racist things we can say.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>I can come up with a lot of stuff for a white guy.</p>
<p>In terms of stuff that is just intrinsic</p>
<p>to him being a white guy?</p>
<p>Yeah, like there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Wait a minute, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot, the internet has sharpened that sword.</p>
<p>In terms of like jokes that are targeted at his sex?</p>
<p>Incel, virgin, weak.</p>
<p>Some of the incel, virgin, maybe,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s getting there, sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s recent though, sorry, I&rsquo;m older on the internet.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have those words way back then.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>When I was making these analogies,</p>
<p>that incel and virgin-</p>
<p>Back in my day, we didn&rsquo;t have gender prioritization.</p>
<p>There were no incels back then.</p>
<p>None of us had sex, we just accepted it.</p>
<p>We were all computer gamers.</p>
<p>Nobody had sex to play video games back then, okay?</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t remember that.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the Big Bang Theory.</p>
<p>You were just a loser that was stuck in-</p>
<p>You guys didn&rsquo;t even know sex existed</p>
<p>so you could use it as an incel.</p>
<p>We had to download sexual pictures</p>
<p>and it took two minutes and you didn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>if you were gonna get the right thing</p>
<p>by the time it finished loading.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is like, okay,</p>
<p>I think you agree that if somebody gives you a race,</p>
<p>like a black person who&rsquo;s a woman,</p>
<p>we can write very cutting, scathing insults for that person</p>
<p>that are very otherizing.</p>
<p>Or words that would really hurt if they were spoken to.</p>
<p>Yeah, that are very cutting to the person.</p>
<p>But for a white guy, it&rsquo;s kind of hard</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the default.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as much otherizing of those people.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s kind of the-</p>
<p>So the insults you have from white guy to white guy,</p>
<p>the insults are much harsher.</p>
<p>So when you start to apply the same kind of harshness</p>
<p>to other groups-</p>
<p>You can make them feel like they really don&rsquo;t belong.</p>
<p>And that otherizing effect is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very hard for me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really empathize with it because I&rsquo;ve never felt it.</p>
<p>So I have to intellectualize it and then sympathize with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a whole process I have to go through.</p>
<p>And then I try to walk other people through that</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re a white guy on the internet,</p>
<p>which is a lot of the internet,</p>
<p>you really don&rsquo;t know what that feels like.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never felt like that before.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re now in a leadership position, grandpa destiny.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, a lot of people look up to you for that,</p>
<p>for that sort of pathway to empathy.</p>
<p>How not to otherize.</p>
<p>I mean, you have felt otherizing.</p>
<p>You mentioned the high school people not being-</p>
<p>Yeah, but those were always for things that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different to insult somebody</p>
<p>for a non-immutable characteristic.</p>
<p>Like, okay, you think poorly about me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not enough money or I don&rsquo;t have money,</p>
<p>but I could get more money and I could change that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s different for somebody to really attack you</p>
<p>for, like, your gender or attack you for, like, your race.</p>
<p>A lot of the attacks that hit the hardest</p>
<p>is not about gender.</p>
<p>I do think that they&rsquo;re, like,</p>
<p>the way women are attacked on the internet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same kind of attacks you would do</p>
<p>towards other guys, but you&rsquo;d go harsher.</p>
<p>I feel like they&rsquo;re fundamentally different.</p>
<p>I feel like when we&rsquo;re attacking guys,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not usually attacking you</p>
<p>on, like, the virtue of you being a guy.</p>
<p>But, like, if it&rsquo;s a woman and she&rsquo;s typing something,</p>
<p>like, oh, did your boyfriend type that for you?</p>
<p>Or, like, what are you even doing here?</p>
<p>Like, shouldn&rsquo;t you be trying to find a husband?</p>
<p>Or, like, oh, you&rsquo;re, like, a stupid cunt.</p>
<p>Like, go start an OnlyFans or whatever.</p>
<p>No, but the stupidity, the intelligence aspect</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s attacked.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s so much different.</p>
<p>Like, you can call a guy stupid,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s a guy that&rsquo;s being stupid.</p>
<p>But when you call a woman stupid,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s stupid because she&rsquo;s a woman.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I honestly think that women are called stupid</p>
<p>more than men on the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing to do, like, the attack is not gendered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the gender inspires an increased level of attack.</p>
<p>I feel like it is gendered.</p>
<p>I wish we had data on this.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of the XKCD comics?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good comic where,</p>
<p>and this is something that I&rsquo;ve dealt with</p>
<p>a lot in my community, okay?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy at a board, and he fucks up a math equation,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, wow, you suck at math.</p>
<p>And then the next panelist, there&rsquo;s a girl that does it,</p>
<p>and she fucks it up, and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>wow, women suck at math.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that feeling that happens where,</p>
<p>when I bring on, I won&rsquo;t use names,</p>
<p>but there are YouTube people that I&rsquo;ve brought on</p>
<p>that have crazy opinions.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re men, that person is crazy.</p>
<p>Oh my God, he said the crazy stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so dumb, he&rsquo;s so crazy, he&rsquo;s so stupid.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s a woman, it&rsquo;s like, oh my God,</p>
<p>why do you always bring dumb women here?</p>
<p>Why do so many women on the internet have crazy opinions?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different minority character</p>
<p>that has to stand and represent their whole group</p>
<p>where white men don&rsquo;t typically have to.</p>
<p>Speaking of groups versus individuals, yes.</p>
<p>But then what I feel happens is then another person</p>
<p>from that group comes, another woman comes,</p>
<p>and people, before she says anything,</p>
<p>will already feel like they&rsquo;re ready with that attack.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re ready for the attack because she&rsquo;s a woman.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna call her, she&rsquo;s stupid because she&rsquo;s a woman,</p>
<p>not because she says something,</p>
<p>but just because she&rsquo;s a woman.</p>
<p>So the group in their brain accumulates</p>
<p>all the negative characteristics</p>
<p>of the individuals they&rsquo;ve met.</p>
<p>Not the positive, the negative.</p>
<p>And it becomes like this ball of stickiness,</p>
<p>and then that becomes the bias for their judgment</p>
<p>of a new person that comes.</p>
<p>With white men, there&rsquo;s more of a blank slate</p>
<p>in terms of bias of how they analyze the person.</p>
<p>With any of the minority group,</p>
<p>they basically make a judgment</p>
<p>based on the negative characteristics</p>
<p>of the individuals they&rsquo;ve met in the past.</p>
<p>That leads to a system where you&rsquo;re just harsher</p>
<p>towards minority groups and towards women.</p>
<p>How do you solve that?</p>
<p>The most important thing for any problem ever</p>
<p>is step one is to be aware of it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not aware of it,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re hopelessly lost at sea.</p>
<p>But yeah, the first thing I like to say</p>
<p>is just be aware of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a girl that I&rsquo;ve had on recently,</p>
<p>and she says a lot of, in my opinion, kind of crazy things,</p>
<p>but people will use her as like,</p>
<p>this is why women shouldn&rsquo;t be here.</p>
<p>This is like, she&rsquo;s crazy and she&rsquo;s a woman,</p>
<p>and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But I can bring on a guy who says similarly dumb things,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s evaluated on his own merits,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a guy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never, ever, ever been a case</p>
<p>where I brought a stupid guy on stream,</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s been like, this guy makes me hate men.</p>
<p>This guy makes me hate white people.</p>
<p>That has never happened.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s other women that come on,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, now I know why incels exist,</p>
<p>or I totally understand where</p>
<p>red pill ideology comes from.</p>
<p>And even if the statements are kind of true,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re making these observations</p>
<p>over and over and over and over again,</p>
<p>it damages your ability to individually perceive somebody.</p>
<p>And then two people that make the same statements,</p>
<p>one can be perceived more harshly</p>
<p>just because of that group bias you&rsquo;ve got built up.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something about streaming</p>
<p>that just brings that out of people,</p>
<p>because you have to talk for seven hours,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re like, all right,</p>
<p>well, whatever psychological issues and complexities I have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to explore them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be magnified.</p>
<p>Magnified, and then it&rsquo;s, as you talked about,</p>
<p>the mimetic theories, or Girardian,</p>
<p>like whatever, the things that are very similar,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to magnify the conflicts that you have,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to explore all the different perspectives</p>
<p>on those different conflicts.</p>
<p>And I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just anecdotal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nice to have women on stream.</p>
<p>I think the dynamic that you guys have is wonderful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just the female voice in general.</p>
<p>I love having women on the podcast.</p>
<p>The female voice, I feel like,</p>
<p>is under-heard on the internet.</p>
<p>And I would love the internet to be a place</p>
<p>where women feel safe to speak.</p>
<p>All right, given that you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>like we talked about a progressive</p>
<p>with non-standard progressive views,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re very pro-free speech, pro-capitalism.</p>
<p>So given that, it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re also pro-establishment and pro-institutions.</p>
<p>So right now, if you look at the world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a significant distrust of institutions,</p>
<p>at least in sort of public intellectual discourse.</p>
<p>What is the nature of your support</p>
<p>for government and institutions?</p>
<p>Can you make the case for and against them?</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there is a synergistic effect</p>
<p>when two humans come together.</p>
<p>If I can speak very broadly in terms of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll say utility, okay?</p>
<p>My happiness with one person might be 10.</p>
<p>The happiness with another person might be 10.</p>
<p>When they come together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 50 between the two of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like this synergistic effect</p>
<p>when humans work together</p>
<p>that the sum is greater</p>
<p>than all the individual parts or whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like an emergent thing that happens there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a capacity, there&rsquo;s a possibility of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, a possibility, sure.</p>
<p>Things could go really wrong.</p>
<p>There could be a cannibalistic tribe</p>
<p>that all eats each other, sure.</p>
<p>But for the purpose of this-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other failure modes, but yes.</p>
<p>Okay, sure, yeah.</p>
<p>But I think broadly speaking,</p>
<p>are you gonna be the well-actually guy?</p>
<p>Okay, if you wanna well, okay.</p>
<p>Well, actually.</p>
<p>Well, actually, sometimes-</p>
<p>Sometimes cannibalism is actually good for both.</p>
<p>True, yeah, sometimes things do go wrong.</p>
<p>But I think broadly speaking,</p>
<p>the fact that you&rsquo;re sitting here</p>
<p>in clothing that you didn&rsquo;t make,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sitting here on an airplane</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know how to fly or build,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of cool stuff that happens</p>
<p>when people come together and they make civilizations.</p>
<p>And part of that civilization building</p>
<p>is the fact that we can specialize,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the fact that we can offload</p>
<p>a bunch of trust onto third parties</p>
<p>that we delegate the power</p>
<p>to make important decisions about our lives.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about how to build</p>
<p>like a combustion engine,</p>
<p>but I know that when I push the button on my car,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna drive around,</p>
<p>and the fumes aren&rsquo;t gonna kill me,</p>
<p>and I can park it in garages,</p>
<p>and the building&rsquo;s not gonna collapse.</p>
<p>And the only reason all of this works</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;ve offloaded a lot of trust</p>
<p>onto these third-party things.</p>
<p>And I would say that the pillars</p>
<p>of these third-party things that society is built on</p>
<p>are, roughly speaking, institutions.</p>
<p>So that might be the institution</p>
<p>of peer review for scientific articles.</p>
<p>It might be the institution of voting for government,</p>
<p>or the ability for us to vote in that whole process.</p>
<p>It might, yeah, the FDA,</p>
<p>all of these institutions are things</p>
<p>that they need to exist</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have the time</p>
<p>or the capability to individually sort</p>
<p>through all of these things individually.</p>
<p>We have to rely on some third-party to do it.</p>
<p>Okay, so you believe at scale,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re together,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re greater than the sum of our parts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the case for institutions.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>What about the inefficiencies of bureaucracy?</p>
<p>Is there some aspect when, at scale,</p>
<p>different dynamics come into play</p>
<p>than they do when there&rsquo;s two people together,</p>
<p>two people that love each other,</p>
<p>the birds and the bees,</p>
<p>is there some aspect that leads more</p>
<p>to cannibalism at scale?</p>
<p>So like corruption, inefficiencies</p>
<p>that are due to bureaucracy and so on.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy, which is not,</p>
<p>I hate it when people try to say bureaucracy is government</p>
<p>because bureaucracy exists a ton</p>
<p>in private environments as well, right,</p>
<p>in businesses and everything.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy introduces its own set of problems,</p>
<p>but I mean, a bureaucracy is necessary</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s coordinating all of the underlying things</p>
<p>in order to create something that&rsquo;s greater</p>
<p>than the sum of its parts, right?</p>
<p>Like all of the software developers in the world</p>
<p>are useless without being paired with good designers</p>
<p>in order to make their products usable by a person.</p>
<p>And the coordination of those people</p>
<p>and the coordination of increasingly more and more things</p>
<p>necessitate some level of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>I think we always say bureaucracy when it&rsquo;s like a bad,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a slur almost,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re a bureaucrat, you&rsquo;re bureaucratic.</p>
<p>The bureaucracy is slowing everything down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, sure, the bureaucracy slows things down,</p>
<p>but bureaucracy also gives us things like safe medicine</p>
<p>and safe water to drink for most of the US</p>
<p>or safe buildings to live in or safe cars to drive, so.</p>
<p>So the managers in institution</p>
<p>versus like the software developers and the designers,</p>
<p>the managers is the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The reason bureaucracy is used as a slur</p>
<p>is that something about human nature</p>
<p>leads to bureaucracy often growing indefinitely.</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>And becoming less and less efficient without,</p>
<p>I mean, this is where capitalism can come in,</p>
<p>that capitalism puts a pressure on the bureaucracy</p>
<p>not to grow too much</p>
<p>because you want the bureaucracy to be useful,</p>
<p>but not large.</p>
<p>Yeah, to be a certain size, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>To be the minimum size to get the job done.</p>
<p>And so capitalism provides that mechanism.</p>
<p>Government does not always.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the criticism of government,</p>
<p>of institutions where it can grow</p>
<p>without a significant mechanism that says</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a cost to bureaucracy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not being accounted for here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just paying for the increasing size of government</p>
<p>without the benefit.</p>
<p>Yeah, government is a special institution</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have to show itself</p>
<p>to be financially viable.</p>
<p>And we kind of live in a capitalist economy</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s generally the case.</p>
<p>So government gets its powers from votes from the people,</p>
<p>which introduces a whole new set of possible positives</p>
<p>and possible negatives, right?</p>
<p>Having something, for instance,</p>
<p>that gives food or shelter to homeless people,</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t want that to have to run at a profit.</p>
<p>But giving an organization that can self-justify</p>
<p>its budgets perpetually and indefinitely growing,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s not the best thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, we always have to figure out</p>
<p>how to do the constraints there.</p>
<p>What about the corrupting nature of power?</p>
<p>That comes with institutions as well.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So then you better pick your style of institution</p>
<p>very carefully.</p>
<p>I think that the democratic institution</p>
<p>we have in the United States today,</p>
<p>I think works very well.</p>
<p>But I mean, there are other styles of government</p>
<p>that have been tried in the past</p>
<p>that I think lend themselves more to corruption.</p>
<p>Not to say that, by the way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not corruption in the United States.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s gonna be varying levels of corruption</p>
<p>at all levels.</p>
<p>But you ran into this interesting problem</p>
<p>where authoritarian regimes can act</p>
<p>with ruthless precision and swiftness</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have to ask any questions.</p>
<p>They just do, do, do, do, do, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>But the problem is it&rsquo;s an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re prone to missteps.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re slow to respond to changing or evolving needs.</p>
<p>There was an interesting study that was put out a while ago</p>
<p>that showed that every single famine</p>
<p>that happened around the world,</p>
<p>almost 98% of them happened under authoritarian regimes</p>
<p>where freedom of speech is very limited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare for a famine to happen under a democracy</p>
<p>because press and everything makes the government</p>
<p>more responsive to the needs of the people.</p>
<p>Power can corrupt.</p>
<p>There are levels of corruption,</p>
<p>but you have to have a system of checks and balances</p>
<p>on all of those different levels</p>
<p>to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t run off the rails, I guess,</p>
<p>and do a sick loop-de-loop</p>
<p>and half the population gets.</p>
<p>Nice callback.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that will listen to you say</p>
<p>that the democracy in the United States</p>
<p>is working pretty damn well</p>
<p>and they will spit out the drink</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re drinking a drink and be very upset.</p>
<p>Can you make the case that they&rsquo;re right and you&rsquo;re wrong?</p>
<p>Can I make the case that-</p>
<p>Can you steel man?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re right, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the steel man for them</p>
<p>is that people have a lot of problems on the day-to-day,</p>
<p>and when they look and they see what government is doing,</p>
<p>they might see potholes outside their house,</p>
<p>homeless people all over their downtown,</p>
<p>and the United States just approved</p>
<p>another X billion amount of dollars for Ukraine,</p>
<p>or they might be living in a city</p>
<p>where half the factories are shut down,</p>
<p>a lot of their people out of work,</p>
<p>but the president is on the TV</p>
<p>talking about how to find jobs</p>
<p>for immigrants coming in from Mexico,</p>
<p>and for these people,</p>
<p>they have problems that exist in their lives.</p>
<p>Some of them are paying taxes to alleviate these problems,</p>
<p>and then when they listen to the government talk,</p>
<p>it feels like the government is not responding</p>
<p>to the needs that they have,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s one problem.</p>
<p>Then on top of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got all of these people working in alternative media</p>
<p>that can show you,</p>
<p>well, look at this politician wasting this much money,</p>
<p>or look at him double speaking here or there.</p>
<p>Look at Hillary Clinton saying</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got a private position and a public position.</p>
<p>Look at how all of these politicians have family members</p>
<p>that are getting rich</p>
<p>because of their relationships with people in Congress.</p>
<p>Look at the revolving door</p>
<p>between capitalist companies and the government.</p>
<p>How can you look at all of that,</p>
<p>take into account that the government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not responding to your needs,</p>
<p>and then really feel like it&rsquo;s a government</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for and by the people and for the people?</p>
<p>Yeah, this was a very good steel man and good question.</p>
<p>How can you?</p>
<p>How can you tell that they&rsquo;re not just politicians</p>
<p>that care more about continuously winning the elections</p>
<p>versus running government effectively?</p>
<p>They should care about winning the elections.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first misconception.</p>
<p>A lot of people say,</p>
<p>this guy only cares about getting voted in.</p>
<p>This guy, he doesn&rsquo;t even believe in fracking or abortion.</p>
<p>He just changes his opinion to get voted in.</p>
<p>Anytime somebody says that,</p>
<p>you should say, that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>You want them to change their opinion</p>
<p>so they get voted in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of a democracy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want them to remain obstinate.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want them to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not changing my opinion no matter what the people want.</p>
<p>You want them to evolve and adopt new opinions</p>
<p>based on what the population,</p>
<p>their constituents are voting for.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the cynical take is that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>on the surface, they&rsquo;re changing their opinion,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s a boys club,</p>
<p>where boys means the elite,</p>
<p>that under in the smoke-filled rooms in secret,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually have their own agenda</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re following that agenda</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just saying anything publicly</p>
<p>to placate the public based on whatever the new trends are.</p>
<p>So here is-</p>
<p>The cynical take a pull-up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I understand.</p>
<p>Somebody asked me this question and it flipped,</p>
<p>I 180&rsquo;d completely.</p>
<p>I was a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016</p>
<p>and my single issue voting thing was lobbying.</p>
<p>I thought that lobbying, the government was corrupt,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t responding to the needs of people.</p>
<p>It completely destroyed my faith in government and everything</p>
<p>and I had one question posed to me by a conservative</p>
<p>that used to come on my stream and chat with me</p>
<p>and he said, and then he asked me,</p>
<p>can you think of any popular opinion</p>
<p>that the American public has</p>
<p>that the government is unresponsive to?</p>
<p>Is there some big piece of legislation or policy</p>
<p>or whatever that people want that the government isn&rsquo;t doing?</p>
<p>They asked me that, I couldn&rsquo;t think of a single good answer</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, oh, geez.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good answer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Drugs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Legalization.</p>
<p>Legalization or drug, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Yeah, go for it.</p>
<p>Oh, shoot, you&rsquo;re doing the Joe Rogan thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pushing back because I brought up weed.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I have become meme.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even, I don&rsquo;t want to interrupt your poll</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s memes upon memes upon memes</p>
<p>I can go with here.</p>
<p>But no, because people bring up, okay, there&rsquo;s no issues.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no issues that the government</p>
<p>is not representing of the public.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the issue.</p>
<p>So somebody will bring up like,</p>
<p>well, what about the legalization of drugs, okay?</p>
<p>The first issue people have is one,</p>
<p>they look at national polling.</p>
<p>Very few things are decided on a national level.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first huge mistake.</p>
<p>Arguably, a lot of BLM made mistakes in this arena</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re saying like,</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t the government doing anything about policing?</p>
<p>Federal government can&rsquo;t do anything about policing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be your,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s going to be your state government,</p>
<p>sometimes your local city government.</p>
<p>The people that like your chief of police,</p>
<p>your police commissioner,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from your mayor, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got people looking,</p>
<p>one, at the wrong parts of the government</p>
<p>to even figure out the solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Two, oftentimes for polling,</p>
<p>the questions are vague enough that you can pull very high.</p>
<p>So when you get into the weeds on things,</p>
<p>no pun intended,</p>
<p>you start to realize like,</p>
<p>oh shoot, this is more complicated than I thought.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the numbers in particular</p>
<p>for legalization of marijuana,</p>
<p>but this is what I&rsquo;m going to guess is the case.</p>
<p>If you poll and you say,</p>
<p>should we legalize marijuana?</p>
<p>That number might poll at like 65, 70%,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s including people</p>
<p>that are in favor of medical marijuana.</p>
<p>If you were to poll like,</p>
<p>should we decriminalize recreational use of marijuana?</p>
<p>That number might drop to like 52%.</p>
<p>And then if you poll like,</p>
<p>should we completely legalize,</p>
<p>not just decriminalize,</p>
<p>but completely legalize recreational use of marijuana?</p>
<p>That number might drop to like 40%.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like all these different ways</p>
<p>you can pull around issues where people are like,</p>
<p>oh no, we broadly agree on this topic.</p>
<p>But when you really figure out, well, do you?</p>
<p>Do we really agree?</p>
<p>Or is there just like broad consensus</p>
<p>around a thing that&rsquo;s never going to show up</p>
<p>like in a piece of legislation?</p>
<p>A really good example,</p>
<p>one example I do know is socialized healthcare.</p>
<p>I think if you poll,</p>
<p>there was a time a few years ago</p>
<p>where if you poll America,</p>
<p>do you think every American citizen</p>
<p>should have access to like free healthcare?</p>
<p>I think that answer,</p>
<p>that poll like 74% yes.</p>
<p>But when you asked,</p>
<p>should the government be the sole provider of healthcare?</p>
<p>It dropped to like 26%,</p>
<p>dropped 50 points.</p>
<p>And you could see,</p>
<p>it was both asking questions about single payer,</p>
<p>but the way that it was asked was so different</p>
<p>that even if you all,</p>
<p>it looks like there&rsquo;s consensus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not nearly as much consensus</p>
<p>as people think around certain ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, go.</p>
<p>We can argue.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That polls, the way you ask the polls really matters.</p>
<p>When you ask,</p>
<p>should the government be in charge of a thing?</p>
<p>That also biases the answer, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s such a negative experience</p>
<p>with government creating a dot gov site</p>
<p>that runs the thing.</p>
<p>But sometimes, sometimes.</p>
<p>I think if you dig in,</p>
<p>if you have a one hour conversation</p>
<p>with each individual citizen.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I think you will understand that yes,</p>
<p>there is support for socialized medicine.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>The argument has to be made though, yeah.</p>
<p>What do you mean,</p>
<p>the argument has to be made?</p>
<p>If you just ask a conservative,</p>
<p>like what about single payer?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna tell you no.</p>
<p>You might be able to build up to an argument for it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna have to make the case for it.</p>
<p>No, but I thought we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>the feeling deep inside your mind and heart.</p>
<p>Does the government represent that?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like some shallow surface layer public opinion.</p>
<p>Does the government effectively represent</p>
<p>what the people want?</p>
<p>Not a shallow survey, but a deeply what they want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually that familiar</p>
<p>with the debates over healthcare,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s maybe look at an easier one.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s harder.</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>War is a really good example</p>
<p>where the government was very responsive,</p>
<p>I think, to the people.</p>
<p>You think so.</p>
<p>So Iraq, Afghanistan,</p>
<p>the government didn&rsquo;t manipulate public opinion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an argument to be made</p>
<p>that they did in terms of like WMD and everything,</p>
<p>but after 9-11,</p>
<p>were you in the United States after 9-11?</p>
<p>After 9-11, I legitimately.</p>
<p>That seems accusatory.</p>
<p>Where were you on 9-11?</p>
<p>Just checking, okay.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>I have evidence and witnesses.</p>
<p>No, okay, all right.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m very defensive right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very strange.</p>
<p>Look into it.</p>
<p>Alex Jones.</p>
<p>I think after 9-11,</p>
<p>we could have gone to war with any country in the world.</p>
<p>We were ready,</p>
<p>because all of America was like, oh my God,</p>
<p>and they pointed to Iraq,</p>
<p>and the reasons for the WMDs was kind of dumb,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think we even needed WMDs to go to Iraq.</p>
<p>We could have just said,</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was giving medical aid to Taliban,</p>
<p>Al-Qaeda, Iraq, let&rsquo;s go,</p>
<p>and we would have gone for it,</p>
<p>but post-Iraq,</p>
<p>Iraq was for a while popular,</p>
<p>and then became obviously deeply unpopular,</p>
<p>Iraq and Afghanistan,</p>
<p>and I think you could see that influence</p>
<p>other foreign policy that the United States had.</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<p>we opted more towards drone warfare</p>
<p>than troops on the ground for places like Yemen.</p>
<p>We opted more towards kind of like sending money and help</p>
<p>instead of boots on the ground for places like Syria,</p>
<p>and I think that a lot of that was kind of in response</p>
<p>to how unpopular the Iraq stuff had became,</p>
<p>and when you looked at a lot of elections afterwards,</p>
<p>even for Obama,</p>
<p>like one of the defining characteristics</p>
<p>of a lot of campaigns were like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna close Guantanamo Bay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get us out of foreign wars,</p>
<p>even up to Trump,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going into,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna stop doing all this weird stuff</p>
<p>in the Middle East.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t still withdraw from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t withdraw,</p>
<p>but they definitely like tapered off</p>
<p>and weren&rsquo;t like as aggressively pushing</p>
<p>those types of conflicts,</p>
<p>because they knew it was unpopular.</p>
<p>But I think if you also consider perfect information</p>
<p>or good information,</p>
<p>if you ask a lot of people,</p>
<p>are you okay spending this amount of money</p>
<p>for this purpose,</p>
<p>so a military conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan,</p>
<p>I think almost from the very beginning,</p>
<p>they would say no.</p>
<p>After 9-11?</p>
<p>I feel like-</p>
<p>Maybe like a few days after 9-11.</p>
<p>Like what was-</p>
<p>I remember Freedom Prize.</p>
<p>We were so mad at-</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s some memes and so on, yes,</p>
<p>but the nature of the public support for the war,</p>
<p>was there public support in 2003,</p>
<p>which is when the invasion happened?</p>
<p>I feel like initially there was a lot.</p>
<p>I remember seeing it on,</p>
<p>but then I also lived in a Republican household</p>
<p>and I was not very like media savvy at the time,</p>
<p>so my parents-</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if the nature of that public support</p>
<p>had to do with WMDs or with 9-11,</p>
<p>because the weird-</p>
<p>It became about WMDs.</p>
<p>But I wonder what is the,</p>
<p>if you were to poll people and let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>hypothetically, there was above 50% support for the war,</p>
<p>what would be the nature of that support?</p>
<p>And to what degree is the government</p>
<p>actually representing the will of the people</p>
<p>versus some complex mechanism</p>
<p>like the military-industrial complex</p>
<p>is manipulating the narrative</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s controlling public opinion?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the media that gets a lot of attention</p>
<p>by being divided and how they&rsquo;re shaping the narrative</p>
<p>through the mechanism of division.</p>
<p>So what-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of complicated things out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like the people and then the government,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s, yeah, for sure,</p>
<p>I agree that there are gonna be different elements at play.</p>
<p>And how much of those elements that lead us astray</p>
<p>can be attributed to the largeness</p>
<p>of the different systems and the different institutions,</p>
<p>like the media institutions and government,</p>
<p>the institutions that have a monopoly on violence,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put it this way,</p>
<p>which is one way to define government.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely gonna be different institutions at play,</p>
<p>but I think that all I would say is,</p>
<p>in reference to my original point,</p>
<p>when there becomes broad consensus around a thing,</p>
<p>I think the government will usually follow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna follow more often than not.</p>
<p>But I think that a lot of times,</p>
<p>I think Americans think that there&rsquo;s more consensus</p>
<p>around certain issues than there actually are.</p>
<p>So a really good example, we&rsquo;re on that war point too.</p>
<p>What caused the lowest dip in Biden&rsquo;s approval rating?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was right after</p>
<p>we pulled out of Afghanistan,</p>
<p>which I think if I would have asked people</p>
<p>a year before, like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume that we could pull out of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s probably gonna collapse after we leave</p>
<p>because they just don&rsquo;t have the will to fight.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the support.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, whatever, it&rsquo;s just not gonna work.</p>
<p>But like, no Americans are gonna die.</p>
<p>It might be a couple other people,</p>
<p>but like, no Americans are gonna die.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get out of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Would you support that?</p>
<p>I think broadly speaking,</p>
<p>I think like more than 60 or 70% of Americans are like,</p>
<p>yeah, that would be fine.</p>
<p>But then when it actually plays out on TV,</p>
<p>when we see the people hanging onto the planes,</p>
<p>when we see like helicopter embassies,</p>
<p>some of the courts and politicians,</p>
<p>well, now it&rsquo;s like, oh my God, this was horrible.</p>
<p>And it was so botched.</p>
<p>It could have gone so much better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, could it have gone better?</p>
<p>Like, maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>But I mean, it seems like you can have consensus</p>
<p>around a certain opinion,</p>
<p>but the way that things play out</p>
<p>and the way that people actually feel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually way, way, way more complicated.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not usually this broad consensus opinion.</p>
<p>All right, yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to believe that.</p>
<p>I mean, just to lay my cards on the table,</p>
<p>I have faith in the power of effective government.</p>
<p>I just have a lot of concern about what happens</p>
<p>as institutions grow in size.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>And I just have a lot of worry</p>
<p>about the natural corrupting influence</p>
<p>on the individuals and on the system as a whole,</p>
<p>like the boys club nature of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there must be a better term.</p>
<p>But basically they agree to the game</p>
<p>and they play the game</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a generational aspect, momentum to the game.</p>
<p>And they more and more stop being responsive</p>
<p>to the people that they represent.</p>
<p>I just feel like there is that mechanism.</p>
<p>And I think the nice thing, democracy elections</p>
<p>are resistance to that natural human mechanism.</p>
<p>Also the balances of power</p>
<p>is a resistance to that mechanism.</p>
<p>In some ways, the media that reveals</p>
<p>the bullshit of politicians</p>
<p>is also a resistance to that mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to be full of shit as a politician</p>
<p>because people will try to catch you on it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a honesty method there that keeps you honest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to some degree.</p>
<p>But it still feels like,</p>
<p>it still feels like politicians are gonna politician.</p>
<p>Yeah, they definitely play their games.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably always gonna be that meta narrative</p>
<p>over like governance that just develops</p>
<p>as like you have to form relationships and play games</p>
<p>to get legislation passed and everything.</p>
<p>The only reason why I don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>when people attack institutions</p>
<p>is because one, institutions are incredibly important,</p>
<p>arguably paramount.</p>
<p>No, they are to keeping society running.</p>
<p>And two, I think sometimes when we shift the blame</p>
<p>onto institutions too much,</p>
<p>I think that we lose sight of what the real problems are.</p>
<p>So for instance, in the United States today,</p>
<p>people might be very critical of the government</p>
<p>not getting much done,</p>
<p>but then everybody turns their eyes to the government</p>
<p>for being ineffective.</p>
<p>But what I would argue is I would say</p>
<p>the government is actually incredibly effective</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s showcasing the will of the American people</p>
<p>really well right now,</p>
<p>which is we are historically more divided</p>
<p>than we have ever been.</p>
<p>And if I were to just look at the people</p>
<p>and I were to say we have a historic divide</p>
<p>that is getting like rapidly blown apart</p>
<p>by things like the internet and the media, right?</p>
<p>If that exists,</p>
<p>well, what would I expect that government to look like?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect the government</p>
<p>to be governing very effective.</p>
<p>I would expect that government to show</p>
<p>that legitimate divide in people.</p>
<p>Do you think that divide,</p>
<p>we have a perception of a large divide</p>
<p>between left and right.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a real divide that&rsquo;s in this country?</p>
<p>Narrow the language.</p>
<p>What do you mean by real divide?</p>
<p>Do you think there is that divide in ideology,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a large number of people</p>
<p>that believe a certain set of policies</p>
<p>and the different set of policies?</p>
<p>Or is it just the perception on Twitter?</p>
<p>No, I think there is a large divide in terms of belief.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s very much divide between any people</p>
<p>in terms of like what they,</p>
<p>like on the most fundamental levels want</p>
<p>in terms of like human beings.</p>
<p>But in terms of like Democrat versus Republican right now,</p>
<p>I think there is a huge divide</p>
<p>in terms of the direction they wanna see the country go</p>
<p>and what they believe really</p>
<p>and what they even believe is reality, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve gotten to.</p>
<p>Can I just speak about the mechanism</p>
<p>of the left and right here?</p>
<p>Maybe on the mimetic rivalry aspect.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect to the left</p>
<p>on which you&rsquo;re a part of that attacks their own</p>
<p>for ideological impurity more than the right does?</p>
<p>Is it the bigotry of small differences?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a name, there&rsquo;s a concept where</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re near somebody</p>
<p>who is very slightly different than you,</p>
<p>you wanna destroy it.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re with somebody that&rsquo;s way different than you,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think the left does it,</p>
<p>but I think the right does it too.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize it until I started dipping more</p>
<p>into conservative communities, but oh my God,</p>
<p>the people from the Daily Wire</p>
<p>and the people from Turning Point and the America First,</p>
<p>but all these different groups of people hate each other</p>
<p>and they fight each other so much.</p>
<p>They hire and fire sometimes employees,</p>
<p>they talk smack about each other.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of political division</p>
<p>between both sides.</p>
<p>I think that the left just kind of gets highlighted more</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like the internet</p>
<p>and a lot of the internet spaces</p>
<p>have a lot of left leaning people.</p>
<p>So you see like the crazy communist</p>
<p>and the crazy progressives</p>
<p>and the crazy center left liberals</p>
<p>and the crazy blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Whereas like a lot of the right leaning people</p>
<p>have kind of been pushed off of the main areas</p>
<p>of the internet now.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>My sense was that it&rsquo;s hard to exist on the center left,</p>
<p>but maybe because I just don&rsquo;t have the full spectrum view</p>
<p>of the political divide.</p>
<p>It felt like center left is a difficult position</p>
<p>to occupy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would definitely say so, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s that difficult to be center right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to be center right.</p>
<p>I think actually maybe even more difficult</p>
<p>because a center right person might be somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like conservative, but not a fan of Trump.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like over.</p>
<p>Like look at like Liz Cheney, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had politicians that are just like,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t back the Trump stuff and now they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Or you might be like center right,</p>
<p>but like you don&rsquo;t think the election was stolen.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re like half the Republican Party</p>
<p>is looking at you like you&rsquo;re crazy, you know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a Ben Shapiro who I&rsquo;m talking with.</p>
<p>I think he publicly spoke against Trump, right?</p>
<p>He did initially,</p>
<p>but I felt like he softened his language up on him</p>
<p>pretty significantly, but.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a significant pressure</p>
<p>to kind of cop out to a certain kind of messaging.</p>
<p>Which the whole Republican Party is feeling right now.</p>
<p>Geez, that two years from now,</p>
<p>that election is gonna be insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard, okay.</p>
<p>So to generalize, it&rsquo;s hard to be in the center,</p>
<p>it feels like.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>To center and then like do like a random walk</p>
<p>among the policies around that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that mechanism is.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes people like me not feel good</p>
<p>being in the center.</p>
<p>It seems like people are just not nice</p>
<p>to people in the center.</p>
<p>Like the public, the Twitter machine is not nice</p>
<p>to the people who are open-minded in the center.</p>
<p>Is that, is there some truth to that?</p>
<p>Two reasons for that.</p>
<p>One is because I think a lot of people</p>
<p>that market themselves as center</p>
<p>are legitimately spineless cowards</p>
<p>and deserve to be called out.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never killed a man, but today might be my first.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll take over, like I told you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take over your stream.</p>
<p>With the AI, yeah, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Is that guy gonna be streaming in the background?</p>
<p>Hey fellas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Lots of gotchas, lots of gotchas.</p>
<p>Okay, gotcha.</p>
<p>Okay, gotcha.</p>
<p>And decrease the, which already is a pretty low level</p>
<p>of emotion, just decrease it completely.</p>
<p>When people are screaming at you and accusing stuff,</p>
<p>just remain calm.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Emotionless.</p>
<p>The gaslighter strategy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even, I don&rsquo;t ever identify as center anything</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s got such a bad reputation because some.</p>
<p>Fuck that, I stand center with a spine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called being open-minded.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not center left and right,</p>
<p>those are just labels.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a really good quote my mom said to me</p>
<p>when I was really young.</p>
<p>She said, Stevie, don&rsquo;t ever let your mind be so open</p>
<p>that your brain falls out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I find that a lot of center people do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what she told me last night.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Why are you like this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, man.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m glad I can, glad I can bring that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you feel like this is a safe space.</p>
<p>Like I said, people are not judgmental.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about fucking my mom,</p>
<p>you know what, you&rsquo;re totally within your rights.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>You said that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>I support that.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Her husband probably wouldn&rsquo;t be too happy about it,</p>
<p>but you know.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s any sexual relations.</p>
<p>It was just that having a conversation with her.</p>
<p>You projected that.</p>
<p>That says more about you than me.</p>
<p>Anyway, go ahead about spineless center.</p>
<p>Spineless center.</p>
<p>There is some aspect to that, which is like amorphous.</p>
<p>To me, center means you think freely</p>
<p>about each individual policy without being stuck to a can.</p>
<p>Yeah, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>They call themselves centrist,</p>
<p>but then they&rsquo;re anti-establishment,</p>
<p>essentially, on everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know your position on the vaccines or anything,</p>
<p>but I met a lot of free and open thinkers</p>
<p>who were like, you know what, I am open to everything,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an experimental vaccine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to eat hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the institutions</p>
<p>are telling me not to take,</p>
<p>and I think Fauci got too much money from that company,</p>
<p>and these are, but I&rsquo;m an open thinker,</p>
<p>and what open thinker becomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at MIT.</p>
<p>What do you think my position on vaccines is exactly?</p>
<p>I hear a lot of crazy things from a lot of people, okay?</p>
<p>You might be from MIT,</p>
<p>but I know you from the internet, okay,</p>
<p>and people from the internet are weird and crazy, so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like arrogance,</p>
<p>and I have criticized scientists during COVID,</p>
<p>a lot of people, but scientists included,</p>
<p>are having arrogance.</p>
<p>Which is fair.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of good criticism</p>
<p>to be made of different scientific</p>
<p>and medical establishments over a lot of stuff,</p>
<p>but nobody can make those good criticisms</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re too obsessed over just trying</p>
<p>to have the anti-establishment answer,</p>
<p>and that is what is upsetting me the most.</p>
<p>Like, I think there are good conversations to be had</p>
<p>about a lot of stuff related to</p>
<p>how we handled the coronavirus.</p>
<p>You know, were lockdowns effective?</p>
<p>Was there enough data to support the huge measures we took?</p>
<p>You know, why didn&rsquo;t we have the option to show</p>
<p>I was infected a month ago?</p>
<p>Why do I need to be vaccinated?</p>
<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t that option ever a thing in the United States?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was.</p>
<p>There are really good questions to be asked there,</p>
<p>but all the people asking the questions</p>
<p>are also trying to tell you that ivermectin</p>
<p>and monoclonal antibodies are the way to go for everything,</p>
<p>and the vaccine is evil,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna turn you gay like the frogs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, Jesus, like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like no place to reasonably criticize from</p>
<p>because all of the people that are criticizing</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t doing it with an open mind or, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not reading studies or doing anything.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying like, I do my own research,</p>
<p>which means they listened to whatever</p>
<p>the last guy on Joe Rogan said,</p>
<p>and now they are parroting that opinion 100%.</p>
<p>Easy now, easy now, bros.</p>
<p>The last guy on Joe Rogan, not Joe Rogan, okay?</p>
<p>That Robert Malone guy on Joe Rogan</p>
<p>got me real fucked up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one guest.</p>
<p>People see him as like the father of mRNA technology.</p>
<p>He published one paper, okay?</p>
<p>What do you mean people?</p>
<p>Which people think that?</p>
<p>Joe Rogan fans.</p>
<p>I get, like, I run into these people.</p>
<p>I start arguing with people, and they start citing me.</p>
<p>Well, what about-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Joe Rogan fan, and I appreciate the vaccine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you do.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s definitely-</p>
<p>Sorry, but you said there&rsquo;s a type.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a type.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the type?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the type of Joe Rogan fan?</p>
<p>Anti-establishment.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s not Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a general public discourse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a default anti-establishment.</p>
<p>On the right and the left,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the default easy thing to go to.</p>
<p>I think Joe Rogan fans are definitely</p>
<p>a certain type of anti-establishment, though.</p>
<p>Like, I could guess the Joe Rogan fan.</p>
<p>Like, if I were to do general population</p>
<p>versus Joe Rogan fan,</p>
<p>who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine?</p>
<p>Do you have data on this?</p>
<p>Or are you just guessing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just guessing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think you are actually judging.</p>
<p>I am, yeah.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re judging.</p>
<p>Because I think you&rsquo;re also,</p>
<p>the beautiful thing about podcasting,</p>
<p>this could be similar to streaming,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a large number of people</p>
<p>that just listen.</p>
<p>Like, what does it mean to be a Joe Rogan fan?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you just listen.</p>
<p>I think people listen and absorb the information.</p>
<p>I would say that the Joe Rogan fan base</p>
<p>is as divided in the vaccine as the general public.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Man, I&rsquo;m gonna look for polling data on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure somebody&rsquo;s gotta have done it out there, but.</p>
<p>No, but you&rsquo;re basically revealing the fact</p>
<p>they have no data.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using your own judgment.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Based on how he&rsquo;s had conversations</p>
<p>about his experience with the coronavirus,</p>
<p>and then based on the guests that have come on</p>
<p>that have talked and echoed</p>
<p>a lot of anti-vax talking points</p>
<p>and been completely unchallenged,</p>
<p>and then based on statements he&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>about myocarditis and the vaccine and everything as well,</p>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the level of challenge or not that he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and then what his true positions are,</p>
<p>and then the types of guests he typically chooses</p>
<p>to bring on to talk about the vaccines, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, but that represents somehow</p>
<p>a deep anti-establishment feeling</p>
<p>versus just the vaccine.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen the vaccine and other things</p>
<p>being a thing that broke people.</p>
<p>I think all the coronavirus,</p>
<p>that whole one or two years broke a lot of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of emotion,</p>
<p>and that emotion quickly solidified into an opinion</p>
<p>that almost had nothing to do with thinking through</p>
<p>and updating your knowledge and so on.</p>
<p>You just made up your mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think a lot of it comes</p>
<p>from that anti-establishment place.</p>
<p>The vaccine represents the ultimate of establishment.</p>
<p>It was a huge private company</p>
<p>backed by a huge public government,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s Fauci, and there&rsquo;s Biden, and there&rsquo;s Pfizer,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all these countries locking us up in our homes,</p>
<p>telling us to do a thing.</p>
<p>The vaccine was the ultimate submission tool</p>
<p>to show you that the government owns you.</p>
<p>Not only do you have to get injected once, it&rsquo;s a series,</p>
<p>and then you gotta get boosters,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re trying to keep you under their thumb,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the control.</p>
<p>I feel like that vaccine</p>
<p>became the ultimate rallying cry</p>
<p>between do you support, are you a sellout</p>
<p>that is gonna believe whatever the government</p>
<p>tells the sheep to take,</p>
<p>or are you gonna be the guy that stands against the crowd</p>
<p>and gets fired from his job</p>
<p>and pulls his kids from school</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not gonna let the evil Fauci medicine</p>
<p>jab them in the arm?</p>
<p>And the funny thing is the crowd that stands against</p>
<p>the institution is not larger than the crowd of sheep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like one sheep standing there.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah, or it feels that way sometimes.</p>
<p>One vaccinated sheep.</p>
<p>Well, okay, what&rsquo;s the defense of institutions?</p>
<p>How do you regain the trust of institutions?</p>
<p>First of all, do you think that there&rsquo;s ways</p>
<p>in which WHO, CDC failed,</p>
<p>and do you think there&rsquo;s criticism towards Pfizer</p>
<p>and the big pharma companies that&rsquo;s deserved?</p>
<p>Damn, it&rsquo;s the pharma companies, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>For CDC and WHO, so here&rsquo;s a criticism that I have</p>
<p>of all of academia,</p>
<p>and I feel it stronger and stronger every day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough to be a researcher</p>
<p>or to be correct about issues.</p>
<p>Academia needs to increase its ability to communicate.</p>
<p>It is just an unbelievable, unmitigated failure</p>
<p>that academics are unwilling to wade</p>
<p>into the complicated topics that exist today</p>
<p>because other people are, you know?</p>
<p>First you call me spineless,</p>
<p>and then you call me a bad communicator.</p>
<p>But no, look, you&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>so you get props for me, okay?</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
<p>That motherfucker.</p>
<p>But there are like so many, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you must have heard another fellow academic,</p>
<p>a fellow colleague, express some amount of frustration</p>
<p>about like in their specific discipline,</p>
<p>they know something to be true,</p>
<p>and they know that like a lot of the messaging</p>
<p>is like wrong or bad in the public about it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re never gonna step out and say anything</p>
<p>because either one, they&rsquo;re very measured</p>
<p>and careful with their take,</p>
<p>which they feel is incompatible</p>
<p>with what people wanna hear,</p>
<p>or two, they&rsquo;re really worried that they might be incorrect,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re gonna be cautious</p>
<p>while everybody else is going out</p>
<p>and like hard-courting their opinions.</p>
<p>And they also don&rsquo;t have the support of institutions</p>
<p>for them to go out on a limb.</p>
<p>Yeah, that too.</p>
<p>So like to take risks.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve heard that with lab leak theory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of biologists, virologists friends</p>
<p>that are like, yeah, it&rsquo;s obviously leaked from a lab.</p>
<p>Like early on.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe, okay.</p>
<p>We can fight over this one.</p>
<p>But sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>No, no, keep talking.</p>
<p>We can fight over this.</p>
<p>But like they, okay, I should sort of backstep</p>
<p>and say like that&rsquo;s like you talk about shooting the shit.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t really investigated, but it&rsquo;s your gut.</p>
<p>Like this doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>They would never say that publicly.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Mostly because you&rsquo;re saying like what they would all say</p>
<p>is like we want to see data.</p>
<p>Yeah, which would be good, which is fine.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going with like this is too many coincidence</p>
<p>in the same place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the logic.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t want to say anything</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no data.</p>
<p>You need to have evidence.</p>
<p>You need to have actual evidence</p>
<p>to say one way or the other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also just like you said.</p>
<p>I mean, effective communication.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a fan of Sean Carroll.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like one of the only people in this whole planet</p>
<p>that I like besides you.</p>
<p>I love Sean Carroll.</p>
<p>Anytime Sean Carroll is brought up as evidence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a smile that comes over your face.</p>
<p>Of like joy, of like a little kid</p>
<p>thinking about Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Okay, I love Sean Carroll too.</p>
<p>People should listen to Spock.</p>
<p>I love Sean Carroll because I hate this divide</p>
<p>between like you&rsquo;re either STEM</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re like philosophy, arts, and all that other stuff.</p>
<p>And the two worlds kind of cross.</p>
<p>And I love that he was so good at physics,</p>
<p>but like explores and pays attention</p>
<p>to all of the like sociological stuff too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so rare to find that quality in a person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s legit.</p>
<p>One of the really, really, really special minds.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to be a Sean Carroll.</p>
<p>You can be just a little better at educating.</p>
<p>Another person in the medical and the health space</p>
<p>is somebody named Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>a friend of mine from Stanford.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible educator.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of process in science</p>
<p>they usually call like review or survey papers</p>
<p>where you basically summarize all that&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>integrate it, and like draw wisdom from it,</p>
<p>and also project like where is the discipline headed.</p>
<p>And Andrew does that basically on all these subcomponents</p>
<p>of the different stuff going on in neuroscience,</p>
<p>in biology, neurobiology, all of that.</p>
<p>He does a podcast called Huberman Lab</p>
<p>where he just summarizes all and is able to explain</p>
<p>like what does that actually mean for your life</p>
<p>in terms of protocols of how to make your life better.</p>
<p>I feel like people should be able to do that more and more.</p>
<p>But with virology and, oh boy, that&rsquo;s a tricky one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really tricky one.</p>
<p>I wish that people could have honest conversations.</p>
<p>Like I attack a lot of people</p>
<p>that do the lab leak theory stuff,</p>
<p>but truly we should be able</p>
<p>to have that conversation publicly.</p>
<p>The people that are having the conversation</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t ever really want to have the conversation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not being honest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guy that like does his own research,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s so boring reading studies,</p>
<p>and a lot of it I can only do abstracts,</p>
<p>and like it&rsquo;s so much work,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll never ever say that about myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guy that does his own research</p>
<p>because every time I hear somebody say that,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t do any research.</p>
<p>When they say they do their own research,</p>
<p>what they mean is they&rsquo;ve seen one podcast</p>
<p>and their opinion on it is completely-</p>
<p>What podcast is that?</p>
<p>Definitely not mine because if it was mine</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be criticizing anything they say.</p>
<p>But yeah, so like lab leak is another one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, how do you know it&rsquo;s lab leak?</p>
<p>How do I know it&rsquo;s lab leak?</p>
<p>Because Fauci lied, and Hunter Biden lapped up,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, okay, come on,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t engaged with it at all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really interesting research</p>
<p>that shows there&rsquo;s a really strong study</p>
<p>that shows that there&rsquo;s like a high degree of certainty</p>
<p>that it came from the wet markets.</p>
<p>Very, very high degree of certainty.</p>
<p>And there was an article that came out recently</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like Senate concludes that virus</p>
<p>actually came from the Wuhan virology lab or whatever,</p>
<p>and that whole article, if you actually read it,</p>
<p>it never says that in the article.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they tweeted it with that headline.</p>
<p>But yeah, to back up, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I think we should have good-</p>
<p>You should be sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sorry, actually.</p>
<p>I get to ramble here, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here for a long time.</p>
<p>I rescind my apology, okay?</p>
<p>I actually rescind my apology.</p>
<p>We should be able to have challenging conversations</p>
<p>about things, but you gotta, man,</p>
<p>be well read on both sides.</p>
<p>Not this like, I do my own research,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t believe anything that Fauci says.</p>
<p>Like, come on, dude.</p>
<p>Dude, you can do better than that.</p>
<p>Not you personally, but gotcha.</p>
<p>How does that feel?</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s the catchphrase.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Through all tragedy and triumph,</p>
<p>through all the rollercoaster of life,</p>
<p>your response to it is gotcha.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, well, actually, let me jump to that</p>
<p>before I continue with political discourse.</p>
<p>Psychologically, you are in a lot of heated debates,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re usually super calm under fire until you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Sometimes you lose your temper completely.</p>
<p>Very rarely, but.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like your opinion, man.</p>
<p>Let me ask about your psychology.</p>
<p>What are psychologically your strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re self-aware about?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m very nonjudgmental,</p>
<p>so I can entertain a lot of different thoughts</p>
<p>without agreeing with them or condoning them.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really big benefit to me.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I seem to be pretty calm</p>
<p>in dealing with annoying people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why I got promoted at the casino so fast.</p>
<p>I could deal with drunks or whatever.</p>
<p>Like, it just didn&rsquo;t affect me that much.</p>
<p>What percent of the population is annoying?</p>
<p>Depends on how you&rsquo;re engaging with them.</p>
<p>Most people aren&rsquo;t really annoying ever.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re in a political debate,</p>
<p>what percentage is annoying?</p>
<p>I guess it depends on who I&rsquo;m debating</p>
<p>and what the topic is.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;m trying to point out the fact</p>
<p>that sometimes you can say that reveals something about you</p>
<p>if you think a large percent of people are annoying.</p>
<p>Well, I would say working graveyard shift</p>
<p>when alcohol is involved,</p>
<p>that percentage of people goes very, very, very high.</p>
<p>Or to be more fair, actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a high percentage, truly.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a server,</p>
<p>one bad customer can ruin the rest of your shift.</p>
<p>So you only need one or two people acting in that manner</p>
<p>to just totally throw you off.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re able to, at least these days,</p>
<p>not allow that one customer to throw you off,</p>
<p>quote unquote.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m very much like a,</p>
<p>I noticed this especially after having a son.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about six-year-old kids or whatever</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, if they get mad,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re never gonna be mad for that long.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll move on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my mentality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a six-year-old kid.</p>
<p>I might be mad about something,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll get over it in 30 minutes or an hour.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty good about not carrying that through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very rare that I&rsquo;ll hold a grudge against anybody</p>
<p>or be angry about something</p>
<p>or really disaffected by something over the long-term.</p>
<p>That almost never happens to me.</p>
<p>What are your weaknesses psychologically, would you say?</p>
<p>I still have a problem with projecting,</p>
<p>I think we all probably do,</p>
<p>but my mind onto others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if I understand this and I&rsquo;ve said this,</p>
<p>you should understand it.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an issue that I,</p>
<p>I still have that where I project too much.</p>
<p>What about holding grudges and stuff like that?</p>
<p>I never hold grudges.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like the least grudgy person ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a meme in my community</p>
<p>because anybody can always come back</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re acting different.</p>
<p>What about the, as long as they&rsquo;re acting different?</p>
<p>As long as they&rsquo;re acting different.</p>
<p>I mean, all right.</p>
<p>The reason why I say that is because,</p>
<p>so for instance, nobody likes this,</p>
<p>but I have a strong stance on apologies</p>
<p>and that I hate them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ever want to hear an apology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about them ever.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t mean anything to me.</p>
<p>If you did something bad,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;ve fixed the behavior</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not doing that thing,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re generally chill.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been a lot of people</p>
<p>that have been involved in weird stuff with me,</p>
<p>but then they go off, they do their thing,</p>
<p>and they come back and it&rsquo;s like, okay, cool.</p>
<p>As long as you don&rsquo;t do it again, we&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry you feel that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your fault, Steven.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your fault.</p>
<p>Okay, gotcha.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said plenty of negative stuff,</p>
<p>positive stuff and negative stuff about Hassan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is my podcast.</p>
<p>So I get to get you to force you to say positive things.</p>
<p>What do you love?</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all about love.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to grilling me on the R word stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna make me compliment Hassan?</p>
<p>This is gonna be a harder conversation than that.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna get you to feel emotions.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s another popular political streamer.</p>
<p>I think you had, as the kids call it,</p>
<p>a bridge burning over Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>My research is very limited on this.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But what do you respect and love most about Hassan?</p>
<p>He puts in a lot of work.</p>
<p>When he was growing his stream</p>
<p>from 2,000 concurrent viewers to 15,000,</p>
<p>he was streaming, it was like 12 hours a day,</p>
<p>every single day.</p>
<p>So that was admirable.</p>
<p>He did a lot of work.</p>
<p>He does seem to be pretty good at networking</p>
<p>and socializing and making the correct friends</p>
<p>and connections to continue to build his business.</p>
<p>What about him as a political thinker?</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t think highly of him in that regard,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s unfair.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s unfair.</p>
<p>I honestly wanna push back on that because.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have zero respect for him as a political thinker.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s not gonna be almost anything.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh, I will say, I admire the fact</p>
<p>that through no actual capability or ability of his own,</p>
<p>he manages to wind up at some of the correct answers</p>
<p>just because he&rsquo;s towing the line.</p>
<p>So good job for him on that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a lot of correct opinions,</p>
<p>just he has no idea why, so.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s undeserved.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s too harsh, man.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The reason I bring that up is I feel like</p>
<p>there is a deep grudge in there somehow.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the father now, so since you&rsquo;re so old,</p>
<p>the grandfather of the political debate on stream,</p>
<p>political debater.</p>
<p>So there could be some grudge about that split that happened</p>
<p>or not enough credit given or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I just think he&rsquo;s somebody that has a left-leaning ideology</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different than yours.</p>
<p>He was a Bernie supporter, right?</p>
<p>And I guess you were not.</p>
<p>Can you explain to me what the division is?</p>
<p>He exemplifies everything that I absolutely hate</p>
<p>about politics.</p>
<p>Which is what?</p>
<p>Which is shallow engagement, heavily ideologically driven.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not ideologically different, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely not, free of ideology.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>like the free thinker in the real meaning of that word.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the way, let me qualify.</p>
<p>Issue by issue thinking.</p>
<p>Let me qualify what I mean when I say that.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time, unfortunate time,</p>
<p>delving into the boring world of philosophy.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time thinking about like,</p>
<p>what are my ethical positions?</p>
<p>How do I feel about myself, the people around me,</p>
<p>and how that relates to the world around me?</p>
<p>And then from all of these positions,</p>
<p>I think you might&rsquo;ve used the phrase</p>
<p>first principles earlier.</p>
<p>From these kind of like first principles,</p>
<p>out of that is where all of my political positions</p>
<p>are built out of, like full stop.</p>
<p>So if you ask me a question like,</p>
<p>how do you feel about like the right to own a firearm?</p>
<p>Or how do you feel about social healthcare?</p>
<p>Like we can walk through,</p>
<p>well this is how I feel about it</p>
<p>as like a thing from the government.</p>
<p>This is where the government gets its power.</p>
<p>This is ethically how groups of people</p>
<p>are supposed to function.</p>
<p>This is morally how we relate to each other.</p>
<p>And personally, this is how I feel like.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll be able to do</p>
<p>every single political belief back there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m telling you,</p>
<p>like if I were to ask Hasan,</p>
<p>what do you feel about this political topic?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna tell me what progressives are supposed to say.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he thinks about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he thinks about it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s a cynical take?</p>
<p>Why is he, just because his views coincide</p>
<p>with the mainstream narrative,</p>
<p>mainstream viewpoints of progressive thinkers.</p>
<p>I mean, why does that mean he&rsquo;s not thinking?</p>
<p>Because his engagement with every subject</p>
<p>is incredibly shallow, 100% predictable.</p>
<p>Like I could write like a,</p>
<p>I could probably program a script</p>
<p>to like give you every single potential answer</p>
<p>you could have to any single question you could give him.</p>
<p>Again, I think that&rsquo;s pretty cynical take.</p>
<p>Okay, it could be the case</p>
<p>that his brain perfectly aligns</p>
<p>with every single mainstream person.</p>
<p>No, but I don&rsquo;t know if you know it as perfectly aligns.</p>
<p>Because I think you&rsquo;re just taking a very select,</p>
<p>just like streamers do of each other,</p>
<p>a very select slice that represents the perfect alignment,</p>
<p>as opposed to looking at a person struggling with ideas</p>
<p>and thinking through ideas,</p>
<p>and then giving them a pass.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people, like I give you a pass.</p>
<p>Just the fact that you say a lot of crazy shit</p>
<p>on stream for drama, like which is-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say things for drama.</p>
<p>That might be dramatic, but.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve evolved as a fish evolves legs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve evolved a mechanism which creates controversy.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>That you could say it&rsquo;s not intention, but it happens.</p>
<p>I think you- Okay, sure.</p>
<p>The extremists kind of learn that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m sure Hasan does the same kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And so like underneath it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a thinking being</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s contending with political ideas.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think so?</p>
<p>He does a really good job at hiding it.</p>
<p>There are other political figures that I really don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t say the same thing about.</p>
<p>So like, I don&rsquo;t know if you have Vosch written in there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, that&rsquo;s a person that-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Vosch.</p>
<p>He also split out of my community and grew up to something,</p>
<p>and now he hates me, and he&rsquo;s an anti-fan community,</p>
<p>and they all hate me.</p>
<p>Okay, tell me something you love about Vosch.</p>
<p>I can tell you a lot of things about Vosch.</p>
<p>I think Vosch legitimately thinks</p>
<p>through a lot of his political positions.</p>
<p>I admire, or did admire, that he has like his own</p>
<p>positions he would take sometimes contrary</p>
<p>to people further left than him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got some positions that don&rsquo;t fit his ideology</p>
<p>kind of at all, like he&rsquo;s his own intermittent thinker.</p>
<p>Rhetorically, he&rsquo;s very effective.</p>
<p>He was willing to sit down and do research</p>
<p>for like his debates and everything.</p>
<p>He would spend a lot of time practicing</p>
<p>like his rhetorical effectiveness</p>
<p>and navigating conversations.</p>
<p>He intentionally and purposefully built like a community</p>
<p>that exemplified his values.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve got a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, we are completely split and hate each other now,</p>
<p>but like I have a lot of-</p>
<p>Why, why, why?</p>
<p>First of all, hate is a strong,</p>
<p>why the hate?</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t hate him, but he hates me</p>
<p>because we had a couple of really big debates.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Well, one had to do with whether or not</p>
<p>you should live your values.</p>
<p>And can you give me the story</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a charitable interpretation?</p>
<p>I always give charitable interpretation.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I absolutely do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Wait, name one time it happened.</p>
<p>Five minutes ago, you talking about Hassan.</p>
<p>Everything I said about Hassan is true.</p>
<p>There is no steel man there, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not charitable interpretation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, if you can prove me wrong,</p>
<p>I would love for you to do it, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using my gut instinct.</p>
<p>Usually when somebody feels strongly</p>
<p>about another person in that way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not coming from a place of data and reason,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from a place of emotion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming from a place of resentment</p>
<p>and grudge and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I understand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s emotions deep in there.</p>
<p>So the got you is hiding,</p>
<p>the got you is a surface of an iceberg</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a deep ocean underneath</p>
<p>that you yourself have not explored.</p>
<p>I disagree, but I understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And love is actually a doorway,</p>
<p>the young love is a doorway for you</p>
<p>to explore the depths of you.</p>
<p>Get into that ocean to find my fish, my pre-evolved form.</p>
<p>I understand why you think the way you do</p>
<p>and you should, you shouldn&rsquo;t believe me.</p>
<p>And I understand that</p>
<p>because if somebody told me the same thing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d think you probably just really don&rsquo;t like this person</p>
<p>for a reason or two.</p>
<p>I understand why you think that way, okay?</p>
<p>The reality is though,</p>
<p>for any political person that I disagree with,</p>
<p>like I can give them a fair shake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the few things</p>
<p>I think I do exceedingly well on my stream.</p>
<p>Even with Hassan, there&rsquo;s been drama</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s been involved in</p>
<p>and when I&rsquo;m involved in drama,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll always throw me under the bus.</p>
<p>But when he&rsquo;s involved in stuff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always say like, oh,</p>
<p>like I think Hassan was right here</p>
<p>or I think that he meant this.</p>
<p>There was a thing that came up once.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on livestream fail.</p>
<p>He was getting roasted because he referred to somebody,</p>
<p>he used the expression shitskin</p>
<p>to refer to somebody&rsquo;s like the way they looked.</p>
<p>And I have only ever heard that</p>
<p>in the context of 4chan people</p>
<p>talking about like Indians or like black people,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a racial thing.</p>
<p>But I could tell the context</p>
<p>and everything that he was saying,</p>
<p>he was insulting some guy.</p>
<p>I think it was kind of like Incel, Virgil, whatever.</p>
<p>He was going for like acne skin.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what he meant when he said it.</p>
<p>And there were a whole bunch of people</p>
<p>that were insulting, like, oh my God,</p>
<p>did he just say racist term?</p>
<p>And I was like, no, I don&rsquo;t think he was racist.</p>
<p>I think he was like, he was just reaching for words</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what came out.</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s an example of me</p>
<p>being charitable towards him.</p>
<p>Okay, but didn&rsquo;t you criticize him for something?</p>
<p>I was trying to, I like Googled</p>
<p>why the hell you guys split up</p>
<p>because I thought your friends,</p>
<p>you should be like-</p>
<p>Split up over a Kamala Harris video,</p>
<p>but go ahead, what were you-</p>
<p>Is that why, is that the,</p>
<p>I feel like you criticized him over something.</p>
<p>And I, okay, this is very vague memory,</p>
<p>but you criticized him over something</p>
<p>and I felt that criticism wasn&rsquo;t charitable.</p>
<p>Was it Pete Buttigieg stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, Pete Buttigieg, yes, yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ve said this a million times,</p>
<p>but no amount of context or no amount of nuances</p>
<p>is ever acceptable to people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Hasan is homophobic,</p>
<p>but I think the comments made about Pete Buttigieg</p>
<p>were really homophobic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he said, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and there were a lot of people</p>
<p>making a lot of comments</p>
<p>that made me really uncomfortable about Pete Buttigieg</p>
<p>that was insane to me.</p>
<p>Spurred by the comments of Hasan?</p>
<p>No, but it was an environment of progressives,</p>
<p>all the progressives were attacking Pete</p>
<p>and I felt like his gayness became like the subject.</p>
<p>Yeah, but why throw Hasan under the bus for that?</p>
<p>Because he was jumping along</p>
<p>with all of those types of like insults.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve done the same kind of stuff?</p>
<p>If I do, call me out on it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll probably say I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the R word was about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine, that&rsquo;s a good call out, yeah.</p>
<p>No, but like your friend,</p>
<p>like you should privately tell him, right?</p>
<p>Well, no, by then we were sworn enemies, so.</p>
<p>So that wasn&rsquo;t the reason.</p>
<p>No, no, no, it was over a Kamala Harris video.</p>
<p>Sworn enemies.</p>
<p>He hates me.</p>
<p>What am I supposed?</p>
<p>Listen, for all of these people,</p>
<p>I will accept them back into my life</p>
<p>if they ever want to come back in at any point in time,</p>
<p>but usually they&rsquo;re the ones that-</p>
<p>If they correct themselves, right?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not expecting anybody to.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the deal with Vosh and Hasan.</p>
<p>These are like the three, we&rsquo;re the three guys online.</p>
<p>None of us will talk to each other.</p>
<p>Hasan because he won&rsquo;t give clout to anybody</p>
<p>and Vosh because he thinks I&rsquo;m bad faith.</p>
<p>And then neither of them will talk to me</p>
<p>because they both hate me.</p>
<p>You guys should go like on a camping trip together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Brokeback Mountain, but three-way</p>
<p>and just like rejoin, refine.</p>
<p>Yeah, that could be a thing.</p>
<p>Refine the patient for each other.</p>
<p>Honestly, just from the internet perspective,</p>
<p>for me as a, just stepping into this world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some aspect to which you have a responsibility.</p>
<p>I hate that word.</p>
<p>You have an opportunity.</p>
<p>You have an opportunity.</p>
<p>I wish you guys would kind of be the beacon</p>
<p>of forgiveness and friendship and camaraderie</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>And even if we disagree, it would be really good content</p>
<p>for us to argue with each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, like shit talk, like friends shit talk</p>
<p>versus not, like the fact that you guys</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t talk to each other.</p>
<p>Like I would love for you to shit talk publicly</p>
<p>with a camaraderie always there.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s love in the beginning, love in the end,</p>
<p>but you beat the shit out of each other in the middle.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what live streaming is for,</p>
<p>the political discourse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great political discourse</p>
<p>versus I think what underlies it is some jealousy</p>
<p>and so on with this.</p>
<p>You get this many follow-ups.</p>
<p>I just wanna make sure you&rsquo;re clear to your audience.</p>
<p>Everybody has, to your audience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you have flaws and I&rsquo;m just not,</p>
<p>in this dynamic.</p>
<p>Hard to find, you know, because I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>Your only flaw is you&rsquo;re too modest.</p>
<p>Yeah, so why did you guys split up?</p>
<p>Because I would love it, honestly,</p>
<p>just let me just put that idea out there</p>
<p>for you guys to make up.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Of course, as everybody talks,</p>
<p>me, Vash and Hassan, it&rsquo;s crazy that the three largest</p>
<p>political debate left-leaning people online</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do any type of content or collaboration at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so stupid.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s strange.</p>
<p>What was the reason you guys split up, the Kamala Harris?</p>
<p>So Hassan&rsquo;s entry into kind of like</p>
<p>the Twitch political debate world was in, I think, 2018.</p>
<p>I think he did a debate with Charlie Kirk</p>
<p>and he reached out to me to kind of review that debate,</p>
<p>to go over it on stream.</p>
<p>And he came on, we went over it,</p>
<p>and then we kind of friendship developed.</p>
<p>We hung out in real life.</p>
<p>I think when I came to LA, I think I slept on his couch,</p>
<p>we played with his dog, we were kind of friends.</p>
<p>And as time went on, I think he was a little bit more,</p>
<p>he was farther left than he let on.</p>
<p>So I was a social Democrat, he was a social Democrat,</p>
<p>but back in those days, like 2018,</p>
<p>when people said they were a social Democrat,</p>
<p>they really meant socialist,</p>
<p>but they just didn&rsquo;t want to say it.</p>
<p>So he was farther left than me,</p>
<p>and we had a lot of deep divides</p>
<p>in our approach to politics.</p>
<p>Whereas I was very much like a first principles,</p>
<p>this is my whole political position,</p>
<p>and he was very much kind of like a,</p>
<p>this is like the political ideology I&rsquo;m involved in,</p>
<p>and this is kind of like the field</p>
<p>that I kind of like navigate in.</p>
<p>So there were a couple instances</p>
<p>where these divides would be laid very bare.</p>
<p>One was when, it was either him or the Young Turks,</p>
<p>I think it was him, there was a shooting in a neighborhood</p>
<p>where very young black child gets killed by a white shooter.</p>
<p>And they did a video about like hate crimes</p>
<p>and how hate crimes are on the rise between races</p>
<p>and white people are evil and blah, blah, blah, not that,</p>
<p>but like white people committing hate crimes</p>
<p>against black people.</p>
<p>And I remember saying to him, I was like,</p>
<p>hey, we don&rsquo;t have all the data yet for this.</p>
<p>It feels really bad to make videos about this beforehand</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the same type of shit</p>
<p>that happens at airports.</p>
<p>Is there a thing going on?</p>
<p>Was it a brown person?</p>
<p>Are they Muslim?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Islamic extremism.</p>
<p>We see this played out so many times in recent history,</p>
<p>probably not a good idea to jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well, no, you don&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not that big a deal, whatever.</p>
<p>And obviously as the story goes,</p>
<p>tale as old as time, the data comes out,</p>
<p>it was just an errant shot.</p>
<p>There was like gang violence,</p>
<p>shot goes out of nowhere, hits a kid in the car.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like a hate crime.</p>
<p>The guy was trying to kill a kid.</p>
<p>But yeah, we basically, we bump up against a few</p>
<p>kind of political disagreements like this.</p>
<p>And an annoying thing is happening in my community</p>
<p>where Hassan is like the serious political figure</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s from the Young Turks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just kind of like, I do politics, but I also game.</p>
<p>And anytime I criticize Hassan, people like destiny,</p>
<p>you need to be more respectful.</p>
<p>He does this full time.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna bring criticisms,</p>
<p>you need to be like really well read and researched</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s got a more serious, whatever,</p>
<p>which I thought was ridiculous.</p>
<p>By the way, if people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>he worked at the Young Turks,</p>
<p>which is like the largest left-leaning YouTube channel,</p>
<p>probably, right?</p>
<p>At least at the time, yeah.</p>
<p>So finally, he did a video on,</p>
<p>we skip ahead to some more minor disagreements.</p>
<p>He does a video on Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>He calls it Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like seven or eight horrible things</p>
<p>about Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, okay, I know at least one or two</p>
<p>of these things are not fully accurate.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna do all the research.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have all the sources</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have a long conversation about it</p>
<p>so that now when I provide criticism to him,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna be like this horrible,</p>
<p>like just me saying something flippantly or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be like substantial criticism.</p>
<p>So I was on a plane ride, JFK to Orlando, whatever,</p>
<p>flying to Sweden to visit my wife.</p>
<p>And on the plane, I review all of the video,</p>
<p>all the data, do all the research and I write everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, okay.</p>
<p>I get to my wife&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s house and I&rsquo;m at the table.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having a conversation like,</p>
<p>hey, we should talk about the Kamala Harris stuff.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, okay, well, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>And we go over it and I&rsquo;ll leave to the audience</p>
<p>to watch the video.</p>
<p>Enough people to say this,</p>
<p>I feel pretty confident saying this.</p>
<p>I was pretty reasonable, pretty measured,</p>
<p>pretty calm the whole time.</p>
<p>And I think he started to get increasingly irritated</p>
<p>that I was levying like more and more serious criticisms</p>
<p>at like the quality of work that he did.</p>
<p>Probably because he felt a little bit intimidated,</p>
<p>I think by my willingness to like dive</p>
<p>through political stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d been a couple of awkward blow ups</p>
<p>where like on, there&rsquo;s like a show called the Raj Royale</p>
<p>where sometimes politics would come up</p>
<p>and Hassan would kind of try to explain something.</p>
<p>And there was another person one time on the show</p>
<p>that made the joke.</p>
<p>It was like, instead of Hassan taking 10 minutes</p>
<p>to explain this, can Destiny just come here</p>
<p>and explain it in 30 seconds?</p>
<p>And he like exploded at that.</p>
<p>He got so fucking mad at that.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think that when I made that kind of call out</p>
<p>or critique of him over the Kamala Harris stuff,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably feeling like increasingly irritated,</p>
<p>threatened, agitated.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s kind of what began</p>
<p>the huge split from our-</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think you were a dick at all?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so in that conversation.</p>
<p>Especially given that like, at that point,</p>
<p>cause this is still 2018 or 20, this might be 2019.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still known at that point as being very aggressive</p>
<p>towards conservatives or alt-righters.</p>
<p>Oh, gotcha.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, and with lefties is what I call them.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m being like very general.</p>
<p>Like my conversation side with conservatives</p>
<p>is like, you&rsquo;re a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so dumb.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m like doing it.</p>
<p>So like with him, I&rsquo;m like, well, don&rsquo;t you think</p>
<p>that like, this is like a little bit</p>
<p>of like an inconsistent presentation about like,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;d be nice.</p>
<p>But I always leave to the audience</p>
<p>so they can go and watch that Kamala video,</p>
<p>Kamala Harris video, Destiny of Son,</p>
<p>if they think that I was being a dick at all.</p>
<p>But a lot of people watching said</p>
<p>I was being pretty gentle, so.</p>
<p>Well, let me say, as a new fan of this space,</p>
<p>I hope you guys make up and I hope you guys fight it out</p>
<p>in the space of discourse and ideas.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>And also with empathy, understanding what the strength</p>
<p>of the other person is, what their buttons are.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s like an unspoken rule</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t press the buttons that you need to.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re doing it mutually and it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Cause you know, it&rsquo;s fun to piss each other off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of like what friends do.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t cross a certain line.</p>
<p>But then other than that, you fight it out.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s step back.</p>
<p>One other super interesting aspect of your worldview</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re a big supporter of Biden.</p>
<p>Can you explain what you love about Biden?</p>
<p>Do you love Biden more than Sean Carroll or less?</p>
<p>Sean Carroll is just like in another world of admiration.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m culturally appropriating you</p>
<p>by saying gotcha now.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so convenient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an easy word.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the same wavelength.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re synchronizing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I mean, it is really interesting</p>
<p>because even the people that support Biden</p>
<p>usually don&rsquo;t say they love sort of,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t support it strongly, you know.</p>
<p>Ideologically, philosophically,</p>
<p>the reason why I like Biden is because he&rsquo;s really committed</p>
<p>to this bringing the left and right together,</p>
<p>which is something we so desperately need in the country.</p>
<p>And his, you know, statements over and over again</p>
<p>of like, I&rsquo;m not the Democrat president</p>
<p>or the Republican president.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the president of the United States.</p>
<p>His desire to bring Republicans together</p>
<p>to work on things like the infrastructure bill,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so incredibly needed.</p>
<p>And I have a huge amount of respect and admiration for him</p>
<p>for trying to push through on that message.</p>
<p>Do you think then it&rsquo;s unfortunate</p>
<p>that he made that comment about MAGA?</p>
<p>MAGA Republicans?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I forget what the comment was,</p>
<p>but MAGA Republicans are not good people kind of.</p>
<p>I watched the full video and he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There is this toxic aspect.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to call out</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re always gonna spend like,</p>
<p>oh, he hates our Republicans.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not, if you watch the quote,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s very specifically calling out</p>
<p>like this group of people</p>
<p>that think that the election was fraudulent.</p>
<p>Is it clear?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he meant by-</p>
<p>We can bring it up.</p>
<p>All right, this is-</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>But I remember watching it on stream.</p>
<p>He was like, if he said it, yeah, that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>You can probably like YouTube MAGA Republicans Biden.</p>
<p>But like, it feels like it&rsquo;s pretty clear</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking about the people that are like election denying.</p>
<p>Too much of what&rsquo;s happening in our country today</p>
<p>is not normal.</p>
<p>Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans</p>
<p>represent an extremism</p>
<p>that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>Listen to this part.</p>
<p>Very clear up front.</p>
<p>Not every Republican,</p>
<p>not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans.</p>
<p>Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.</p>
<p>I know,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been able to work</p>
<p>with these mainstream Republicans.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no question that the Republican Party today</p>
<p>is dominated, driven, and intimidated</p>
<p>by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.</p>
<p>And that is a threat to this country.</p>
<p>I disagree with that, man.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t clearly say extremist ideology.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say the people that doubt</p>
<p>the validity of the election.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s Donald Trump.</p>
<p>No, but there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all the candidates that Donald Trump is supporting.</p>
<p>How many, what is it, like 40, 50?</p>
<p>How many candidates right now</p>
<p>that are MAGA candidates are election deniers?</p>
<p>No, but there&rsquo;s 80 million</p>
<p>of whatever people voted for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>You could say that&rsquo;s the MAGA Republicans.</p>
<p>So to me, it sounded like he was referring</p>
<p>to not even the majority.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s one nice, helpful, clarifying statement.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s basically there&rsquo;s the mainstream Republicans,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s those that voted for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I heard it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, so-</p>
<p>Maybe he should&rsquo;ve done a better job at clarifying, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, I-</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a clear,</p>
<p>there is a huge problem with this group of Americans</p>
<p>that think that the election is stolen.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s trying to call it.</p>
<p>But no matter if that&rsquo;s what he meant,</p>
<p>even flirting with that line</p>
<p>is not a person who&rsquo;s bringing people together.</p>
<p>I feel like the extending a hand to the most,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with Republicans in Congress.</p>
<p>Not even a majority of Republicans are like this.</p>
<p>But why say not the majority of Republicans are like this?</p>
<p>Say we&rsquo;re one country, we believe the same thing.</p>
<p>So focus on the uniting part versus saying-</p>
<p>He does before and after.</p>
<p>That was 50 seconds, okay?</p>
<p>But that, you never,</p>
<p>the point is you never say something like that.</p>
<p>Listen, that, you&rsquo;ve spoken about the Bosnia speech,</p>
<p>which is your favorite of his.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I went back to it and listened to it.</p>
<p>Before I move to that, just on this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard for him to call out</p>
<p>that group of election deniers,</p>
<p>I think, without it always feeling like-</p>
<p>Why call them out?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s arguably one of the most destructive forces</p>
<p>that exist in this country today.</p>
<p>Did it destroy anything?</p>
<p>They were trying to.</p>
<p>Did it, though?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t, did it?</p>
<p>So does that mean we don&rsquo;t call it out?</p>
<p>We wait till next time?</p>
<p>No, because calling it out is giving fuel to the division.</p>
<p>Like the people that doubted the validity of the election,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s anger, that&rsquo;s frustration with the other side.</p>
<p>You heal that as opposed to saying</p>
<p>all those people that believed that at any time are idiots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re un-American.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t think the election was real.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Biden has the ears of these people at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he can do for-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that believe the same thing in 2016</p>
<p>with the Russian hacking, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That is a super not fair comparison.</p>
<p>There are definitely, the mainstream Democrat opinion</p>
<p>was that Russian intrusion</p>
<p>in terms of social media and stuff happened,</p>
<p>but there was never a claim that the election was stolen.</p>
<p>Or at least, I don&rsquo;t know of any mainstream Democrat</p>
<p>that supported that.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is not just saying</p>
<p>there was interference and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is literally saying</p>
<p>the election was literally stolen,</p>
<p>that ballot boxes were hidden,</p>
<p>that vote tallies were manipulated.</p>
<p>I think the claim is there&rsquo;s a huge gulf</p>
<p>of difference between the two.</p>
<p>So you can attack Donald Trump for that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s not the words of a uniter</p>
<p>to attack people that believe that.</p>
<p>You could argue maybe it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>but especially not being super clear about that,</p>
<p>about who you&rsquo;re referring to when you say MAGA Republicans.</p>
<p>Because MAGA is a hat and a slogan</p>
<p>that refers to whatever the number is,</p>
<p>70 million people, whoever, that voted for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Of all the Republicans that consider themselves</p>
<p>MAGA Republicans, what percentage of them do you think</p>
<p>believe the election was stolen?</p>
<p>I feel like that number is, I don&rsquo;t have the palm,</p>
<p>but I feel like that number is probably more than 70%.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a MAGA Republican?</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m not familiar.</p>
<p>Like a Trump-supporting Republican, a MAGA Republican.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there for Trump.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between somebody</p>
<p>that voted for Trump and a-</p>
<p>MAGA Republican.</p>
<p>And a MAGA Republican.</p>
<p>So my mom is a MAGA Republican.</p>
<p>If Trump ran independently and DeSantis ran</p>
<p>under the Republican ticket, my mom would vote for Trump.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll follow him to the end of the earth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a MAGA Republican.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easy to mistake that distinction</p>
<p>in these kinds of political speeches.</p>
<p>Because to me, anybody who voted for Trump</p>
<p>can easily, in the context of the speech,</p>
<p>be interpreted as a MAGA Republican.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Maybe it could have been more clear,</p>
<p>but I think in listening to that,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious who he&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>But I guess if you have an emotional response to it,</p>
<p>I can understand the emotional response.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people-</p>
<p>If I have an emotional response,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t like, I think I&rsquo;m with, what is it?</p>
<p>Michelle Obama, they go low, we go high.</p>
<p>Meaning like, to me, a uniter doesn&rsquo;t participate</p>
<p>in derision.</p>
<p>Sure, a uniter might not, but a leader has to be able</p>
<p>to accurately assess the situation before him</p>
<p>and make people aware of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You mean all the impeachment trials,</p>
<p>all the censoring from social media,</p>
<p>all of that didn&rsquo;t do the job?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not his job.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about censoring any of that.</p>
<p>That mechanism, his job is to inspire a nation</p>
<p>to unite a nation.</p>
<p>How can he do that when half the people don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that he was even legitimately elected?</p>
<p>Like, I think he&rsquo;s done a good job at working on legislation</p>
<p>and doing stuff that hopefully benefits all Americans.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s important to recognize</p>
<p>that there is a contingent of Americans</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t even believe that this is really crazy.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people that recognize that</p>
<p>and are fighting that and are constantly screaming that</p>
<p>from the rooftops.</p>
<p>His job is to be the inspiring figure</p>
<p>that makes the majority of Americans be proud</p>
<p>for him to be a president of the nation they love.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the uniting aspect is,</p>
<p>is you remind people that we are one</p>
<p>and we love this country,</p>
<p>we love the ideas that it represents.</p>
<p>He does that in other parts of that speech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a 20 minute speech, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a fuck up.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t participate in that division.</p>
<p>Anyway, I understand, I understand.</p>
<p>I just wanted to push back on the saying,</p>
<p>one of his strengths is that he&rsquo;s uniting.</p>
<p>But yes, that is an ideal, that is a goal, is a great one.</p>
<p>And he is one that espoused that goal for a long time.</p>
<p>Do you think, what else?</p>
<p>So from policy perspective and so on.</p>
<p>I thought the way he&rsquo;s handled Ukraine and everything</p>
<p>thus far has been almost perfect.</p>
<p>I think he did a really good job</p>
<p>at the political maneuvering</p>
<p>of bringing other countries into the fold,</p>
<p>at establishing clearly what our mission was</p>
<p>in relation to Ukraine.</p>
<p>I thought he did a good job there.</p>
<p>I admire him for pulling out of Afghanistan,</p>
<p>even if it was a little bit rough around the edges,</p>
<p>like we got out and we&rsquo;re gone,</p>
<p>no American lives were lost.</p>
<p>The domestic policy, he&rsquo;s passed more major legislation</p>
<p>than I think anybody thought possible.</p>
<p>The green energy stuff with the last bill,</p>
<p>the infrastructure bill,</p>
<p>a lot of the coronavirus relief I thought was really good,</p>
<p>especially the expansion of the child tax credit.</p>
<p>So from a policy perspective, foreign and domestic,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s been successful.</p>
<p>Rhetorically, I think he&rsquo;s generally been above board</p>
<p>in terms of not attacking people or being too divisive.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to bring people together and work on them.</p>
<p>What do you think about the sort of popular in the media</p>
<p>criticism of his mental decline?</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;s experiencing mental decline?</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s an old guy.</p>
<p>But do you think, I mean, do you?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe a little bit,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s still doing a good job, so, you know.</p>
<p>Not from a speech perspective,</p>
<p>you mean from a policy perspective?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m analyzing it as a job, yeah.</p>
<p>From a speech perspective, maybe not the greatest,</p>
<p>but yeah, I mean, he&rsquo;s definitely, what is he, like 80, 81?</p>
<p>How old is he?</p>
<p>I lose track after so many years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you did say that he&rsquo;s probably going</p>
<p>to run in 2024 and he&rsquo;s probably going to win.</p>
<p>Did I say that, that he&rsquo;s probably gonna win?</p>
<p>No way did I say that.</p>
<p>I heard that somewhere.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably gonna run.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who knows who will win?</p>
<p>But I think, I feel like the incumbent advantage</p>
<p>is so strong.</p>
<p>Are you really gonna throw that away?</p>
<p>Like, I think it&rsquo;s been like one or two times in history</p>
<p>in the US, right, where like the non-incumbent,</p>
<p>the parties put somebody else up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the concern is like the,</p>
<p>just the age and the mental decline,</p>
<p>just the wear and tear of the campaign,</p>
<p>all of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>All of the speech you have to make,</p>
<p>the debates and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, what?</p>
<p>The least excited.</p>
<p>I mean, two years from now is a long time.</p>
<p>At his current mental state, he could run and do it.</p>
<p>He could do a possible job.</p>
<p>In two years, man, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen videos of Bill Clinton recently.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking pretty rough.</p>
<p>You know, if Biden is looking a lot more rough,</p>
<p>worse for wear in two years,</p>
<p>then maybe they actually do have to dig out another person</p>
<p>for running, who knows?</p>
<p>What do you think about Trump, when he won in 2016,</p>
<p>I think is when you came to fruition, politically speaking.</p>
<p>So what do you think his winning</p>
<p>the 2016 election represents?</p>
<p>So for me, Trump, the reason why I got into politics</p>
<p>was Trump was like this new epistemic force</p>
<p>in American politics that like,</p>
<p>you kind of have to like flirt with facts before,</p>
<p>even if you wanted to be non-factual.</p>
<p>He super didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Lying was like a first language to him,</p>
<p>just like in speaking in terms of like,</p>
<p>the way that he used language to just say to you</p>
<p>what he felt like you needed to hear to support him</p>
<p>and not care at all about what is going on about,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s what Trump represented to me</p>
<p>in terms of like things that I cared about.</p>
<p>He also represents a lot more, obviously,</p>
<p>that there was this undercurrent of American opinion</p>
<p>that a lot of people didn&rsquo;t know still existed,</p>
<p>and it did, he got elected,</p>
<p>that the Overton window was misidentified</p>
<p>by even a large amount of the Republican Party,</p>
<p>that populism was a lot more popular</p>
<p>than a lot of people figured.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot that I guess he represented.</p>
<p>Do you think Trump should have been banned from Twitter?</p>
<p>Can you make the case for and against it?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a big supporter of free speech.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the case in favor of it.</p>
<p>Do you think he should be brought back as Elon tweeted?</p>
<p>Yeah, because if he gets brought back,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a higher chance that I&rsquo;ll be brought back.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m supporting that all the way.</p>
<p>Thank you, Elon, unbanned my account.</p>
<p>So because you called me weak-spine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to message Elon.</p>
<p>Okay, at Omnidestiny, it was a verified Twitter account.</p>
<p>Omnidestiny.</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you get banned from Twitter, Destiny?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add that to Elon.</p>
<p>I saw that there was a screenshot of you</p>
<p>referring to the rape of somebody.</p>
<p>Okay, that was on an older Twitter account,</p>
<p>and that was a bad tweet.</p>
<p>You have multiple Twitter accounts,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re trying to go around the bans</p>
<p>that you keep getting.</p>
<p>Okay, hold on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re slandering me a lot right now, okay?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the facts straight, okay?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember why my first account got banned,</p>
<p>but it was a wild account.</p>
<p>I tweeted some wildly inappropriate things.</p>
<p>You regret?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that word.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give the answer that most people give,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t regret it,</p>
<p>because I learned a lot.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad I had the bad experiences that I did.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you like the word regret?</p>
<p>I think if we look at where we are,</p>
<p>how do you feel about determinism?</p>
<p>I believe in the hardest of determinism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who I am, okay?</p>
<p>So who I am today is the culmination</p>
<p>of everything that&rsquo;s occurred in the past.</p>
<p>I believe you speaking of, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I believe in you speaking about regret</p>
<p>is a nice way to communicate</p>
<p>that in this deterministic world,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve analyzed the acts of the past,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re no longer that person.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, for sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what regret usually means.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks for giving me the human explanation.</p>
<p>Okay, true.</p>
<p>In a sense, there&rsquo;s a lot of things I&rsquo;ve done that I regret.</p>
<p>Oh, what are you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not human, you&rsquo;re a bot?</p>
<p>NPC is my preferred term.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>I wish I would have been smart enough at the time</p>
<p>to not have to have had made those mistakes.</p>
<p>Okay. There you go.</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
<p>But yeah, obviously, really dumb,</p>
<p>really crazy, off-the-wall tweets.</p>
<p>But that account got banned,</p>
<p>but then I made another account called,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m giving you a history</p>
<p>of my Twitter accounts,</p>
<p>but I had another account called OmniDestiny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor.</p>
<p>And that was my, I got verified, I was cool,</p>
<p>they let me have that account,</p>
<p>because originally they banned it,</p>
<p>and I said, appeal, and I was like,</p>
<p>oh, let me have one more.</p>
<p>And back then, Twitter was cool,</p>
<p>and they were like, okay, go for it.</p>
<p>And that account lasted for a long time.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t actually know 100% why that account got banned.</p>
<p>I believe that the tweet that showed up in the final,</p>
<p>I got banned for hate speech.</p>
<p>And it was because I was,</p>
<p>there was a picture that I tweeted</p>
<p>with three different alt-righters</p>
<p>that are kind of like neo-Nazi people,</p>
<p>and they were all like mixed-race people.</p>
<p>And I said, like, the new alt-right</p>
<p>looks like a Disney Channel original movie,</p>
<p>in terms of racial composition.</p>
<p>And somehow they got flagged</p>
<p>for instigating violence against minorities, I think.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the tweet that got me banned,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s what showed up in the final report.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, maybe there were other reasons,</p>
<p>because nobody ever communicates.</p>
<p>But ever since that account went under,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just been ban evading ever since, so.</p>
<p>Oh, ban evading ever since.</p>
<p>So all my new accounts that got banned just get banned,</p>
<p>because they finally figure out it&rsquo;s me,</p>
<p>and then they ban evade.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like one dude at Twitter HQ</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like constantly looking for my new accounts,</p>
<p>and they get me, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah.</p>
<p>So post-Trump world.</p>
<p>Do you think, okay, I mean, this-</p>
<p>Oh, should he be banned?</p>
<p>Oh, you asked me to make both cases.</p>
<p>Should he be banned?</p>
<p>I mean, damn, dude, when you&rsquo;re tweeting out shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s arguably leading to stuff like January 6th,</p>
<p>I can understand why,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, what else is this wild dude</p>
<p>gonna tweet out?</p>
<p>Like, is he gonna start instigating other violent events?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sympathetic towards the like,</p>
<p>okay, well, he can&rsquo;t just be here saying stuff like this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna ban him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sympathetic-</p>
<p>Instigating actual physical violence in the physical world.</p>
<p>Yeah, like if I were to tweet stuff like that,</p>
<p>I would get banned, probably.</p>
<p>On the flip side,</p>
<p>this is the President of the United States.</p>
<p>It seems like he&rsquo;s like doing presidential decree</p>
<p>by social media sometimes.</p>
<p>Like, is it really right that one public,</p>
<p>or private, I should say,</p>
<p>one private company can like erase</p>
<p>the President of the United States words</p>
<p>from the eyes of a lot of Americans</p>
<p>that are using these social media feeds?</p>
<p>And one big one, which I for sure am against,</p>
<p>is the permanent ban.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I hate that.</p>
<p>Even in my community.</p>
<p>If somebody comes back after like a year,</p>
<p>like, I mean-</p>
<p>Did you just compare yourself</p>
<p>to the President of the United States?</p>
<p>No, I compared myself to Twitter</p>
<p>banning the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way.</p>
<p>If I ban Donald Trump in my chat room,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d unban him in a year.</p>
<p>A year?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process for unbanning Donald Trump?</p>
<p>What would he have to do?</p>
<p>Usually, people send me an email,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, listen, I did this stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I was dumb.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give him another chance.</p>
<p>But a year?</p>
<p>What if they send an email a month later?</p>
<p>Usually, I&rsquo;ll unban him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually my policy.</p>
<p>I ban pretty quickly in my community,</p>
<p>but if you ever ask me to come back-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a big softie.</p>
<p>I usually let him back, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, because I used to be</p>
<p>the worst type of internet person,</p>
<p>and I think I&rsquo;m a little bit better than I used to be, so.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re older.</p>
<p>Yeah, now that I&rsquo;ve matured, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Age bestows a wisdom</p>
<p>that just can&rsquo;t be gotten any other way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense in general?</p>
<p>Is there something interesting you could say</p>
<p>about your view on free speech?</p>
<p>It seems like one of those terms</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also overused to mean a lot of different things.</p>
<p>What does it mean to you?</p>
<p>If you have a democratic style of governance,</p>
<p>you are entrusting people</p>
<p>with one of the most awesome</p>
<p>and radical of responsibilities.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s saying that you&rsquo;re going to pick the people</p>
<p>that are gonna make some of the hardest decisions</p>
<p>in all of human history.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna trust people to vote correctly,</p>
<p>you have to be able to trust them</p>
<p>to have open and honest dialogue with each other.</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,</p>
<p>you have to believe that your people</p>
<p>are going to be able to rise above</p>
<p>and make the correct determinations</p>
<p>when they hear these types of speeches.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re so worried</p>
<p>that somebody&rsquo;s gonna hear a certain political figure</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna be completely radicalized instantly,</p>
<p>then what that tells me</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t have enough faith in humans</p>
<p>for democracy to be a viable institution.</p>
<p>Which is fine.</p>
<p>You can be anti-democratic,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think you can be pro-democracy</p>
<p>and anti-free speech.</p>
<p>Within reason.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the within reason?</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t post like child porn</p>
<p>or something on Twitter</p>
<p>where people try to get you on that stuff.</p>
<p>Or like direct calls to violence are probably not.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be tweeting out like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna meet up tomorrow and go bomb,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah, probably not.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s okay to allow racism</p>
<p>and antisemitism and hate speech?</p>
<p>Hate speech, yes.</p>
<p>Because that can be very broadly defined.</p>
<p>I can understand there being some basic rules</p>
<p>of like no slurs on like a platform</p>
<p>that gets into like acceptable forms of moderation</p>
<p>or like excessive harassment and bullying,</p>
<p>I can understand.</p>
<p>But past that, when the moderation becomes ideological,</p>
<p>I get a little bit nervous</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a whole other host of reasons.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s all a gray area,</p>
<p>but when it feels like ideology</p>
<p>has seeped into the censorship, not good.</p>
<p>Yeah, which it&rsquo;s so fascinating to think,</p>
<p>especially now that Elon bought Twitter,</p>
<p>how do you engineer a system</p>
<p>that prevents ideology from seeping in</p>
<p>and nevertheless is able to create a platform</p>
<p>that has healthy conversations?</p>
<p>Because if you have one guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just screaming nonsense nonstop,</p>
<p>it has this effect where the quiet voices</p>
<p>at the back of the room are silenced.</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s what you usually don&rsquo;t talk about.</p>
<p>Like if you let one annoying, loud person in,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually censoring the voice of a lot of people</p>
<p>that would like to speak, but they don&rsquo;t get a chance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things,</p>
<p>especially around like trans discourse,</p>
<p>I have to constantly do that,</p>
<p>like reminder for my audiences.</p>
<p>So like when I&rsquo;m dealing with these types of people</p>
<p>on the internet, a lot of them might seem really crazy,</p>
<p>a lot of these types of people might seem insane,</p>
<p>but like in the real world,</p>
<p>outside of like the crazy Twitter activist world,</p>
<p>like the vast majority of people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re meeting from LGBT communities</p>
<p>are like the coolest, normalest people.</p>
<p>All they want is the right to live their life</p>
<p>in the way they want to and to be like unobstructed.</p>
<p>And like, yeah, but people will get this impression</p>
<p>of like an online activist,</p>
<p>like a vegan or LGBT person or whatever.</p>
<p>And then they think that every single person</p>
<p>in real life is like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really negative stereotype.</p>
<p>And then even the other people in that group.</p>
<p>Oh, is Melina coming over?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s her.</p>
<p>Okay, Melina just joined us.</p>
<p>What were we talking about?</p>
<p>Was it interesting?</p>
<p>You were saying that you were gonna talk to Elon</p>
<p>about getting at Omnidestiny,</p>
<p>the verified Twitter account, unbanned.</p>
<p>I said, that&rsquo;s so-</p>
<p>That sounds like a lie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so gracious of you.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even believe you would do that for me.</p>
<p>And then you admitted that you tried</p>
<p>to evade the ban multiple times,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m sure would be very looked upon.</p>
<p>You know, I heard that in Norway, in their prison system,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t actually punish you for trying to escape jail</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s like the natural human thing to do.</p>
<p>They hug you?</p>
<p>What do they do?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they, but they don&rsquo;t punish you</p>
<p>because of course you&rsquo;re trying to be free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m trying to be on Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to be free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the natural humanistic-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the natural, of course, it&rsquo;s the banning of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a destructive force.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just-</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m a positive, I&rsquo;m a force for good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why all my accounts only get banned</p>
<p>for banning banning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get banned for doing bad things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a progressive show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like far left.</p>
<p>I love like progressive causes.</p>
<p>I thought this is what you criticized Hasan for being.</p>
<p>I show them from a place of first principles,</p>
<p>not from a mindless AI echoing kind of thing, you know?</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re a free thinking bot.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll return to some politics.</p>
<p>That was beautiful.</p>
<p>Malia, can you tell us about yourself?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also a fellow streamer.</p>
<p>Yes. What&rsquo;s your story?</p>
<p>I stream and I started streaming</p>
<p>because I met him basically, kind of,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t do the politics.</p>
<p>I do like travels or talk about relationships,</p>
<p>talk to my audience, basically.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re from that part of the world, right, Sweden?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So did you escape from prison and they didn&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>That was Norway, you just went to Norway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different-</p>
<p>I actually really, I&rsquo;ve been to Sweden a bunch of times.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tech sector there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really, like, flourishing.</p>
<p>Where did you go?</p>
<p>Which city?</p>
<p>I went to Stockholm.</p>
<p>I think I gave a few lectures there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a vibrant tech sector, it was cool.</p>
<p>And people are super nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re friendly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not, like, very deep.</p>
<p>Like, we don&rsquo;t really have much deep conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a meta conversation.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s not many intellectuals that come from Sweden?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really speak very highly of ourselves.</p>
<p>We kind of, like, just chill all the time.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t make a scene.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re just, like, talking, you know?</p>
<p>Do you know what the name for that is?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a specific name for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Jantelagen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s a philosophy behind it.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re part of, like, Sweden or Norway,</p>
<p>you, like, you don&rsquo;t talk too highly of yourself</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s seen as kind of, like, rude.</p>
<p>Like, think of, like, America as the exact opposite.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even really want to, like,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to make yourself into a victim too much.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be too much of anything.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just, like, sticking to the group.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make a big scene about yourself.</p>
<p>But that said, you came here</p>
<p>and you put yourself in front of a camera</p>
<p>and became a streamer.</p>
<p>Yes, do you understand how weird that is</p>
<p>for my friends in Sweden?</p>
<p>Do you have anxiety?</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t talk about myself</p>
<p>and just, like, make a big deal about myself</p>
<p>for hours every day.</p>
<p>Was that, like, terrifying?</p>
<p>Did you have anxiety about that?</p>
<p>No, because I don&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>But then I come back and I&rsquo;m like, ooh.</p>
<p>Also, what do you feel like when you&rsquo;re actually streaming?</p>
<p>You feel like you&rsquo;re just alone in a room?</p>
<p>One-on-one type thing?</p>
<p>No, I see Chad and I&rsquo;m thinking,</p>
<p>oh, they&rsquo;re like little fairies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really real.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, like, out there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they look like.</p>
<p>I just see little demons and they&rsquo;re just cute.</p>
<p>And just colors, you know?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking to little fairies inside your head.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>Is that how you feel about Chad?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re demons for me, but-</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re demons?</p>
<p>Okay, my Anna fairies.</p>
<p>Are they, so is Chad a source of stress or happiness?</p>
<p>Like, is there a-</p>
<p>No, for me, it&rsquo;s a source of happiness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been very intentional</p>
<p>with, like, the construction of my community,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m really happy with where it&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>How are you able to actually have deep political discourse</p>
<p>while playing a video game at the same time?</p>
<p>I have a really good chat room</p>
<p>in terms of, like, the way that people</p>
<p>engage in conversations.</p>
<p>Like, I was one of the earliest people</p>
<p>to embrace the philosophy of, like,</p>
<p>I am in total control of what people watch me think,</p>
<p>that, like, I have a high level of responsibility</p>
<p>for how they conduct themselves,</p>
<p>and that if I conduct myself in a certain way,</p>
<p>I can expect a certain level of conduct from them.</p>
<p>And for the most part, it&rsquo;s, like,</p>
<p>worked pretty well for the past,</p>
<p>you know, nine or 10 years, yeah.</p>
<p>What about the actual playing of the game?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re able to parallelize the brain, like-</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Like, it seems, like,</p>
<p>Factorio seems like a super complex game.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t actually think that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think multitasking for a human brain is possible.</p>
<p>If you see me playing a game,</p>
<p>usually what&rsquo;s happening is the conversation is, like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it a million times,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not thinking about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve automated that.</p>
<p>Or if the conversation is very challenging,</p>
<p>then if you watch me,</p>
<p>if you really watch what&rsquo;s happening in the game,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably just running around in circles</p>
<p>because I have to think about the conversation.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because with Factorio,</p>
<p>it looks like a lot of stuff is going on.</p>
<p>Sometimes, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard for a person who hasn&rsquo;t played the game</p>
<p>to detect that you&rsquo;re not actually-</p>
<p>Does that come off as, like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re super intelligent and multitask,</p>
<p>or does it come off as, like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not interested in this conversation at all?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a coolness to it.</p>
<p>Like, when you&rsquo;re not paying attention,</p>
<p>like, if you&rsquo;re looking elsewhere,</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re checking your phone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re too cool for this conversation.</p>
<p>There is a sense like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, the reality is, though,</p>
<p>is if you watch,</p>
<p>it was easier to see in Minecraft,</p>
<p>because in Minecraft,</p>
<p>when there was a challenging conversation,</p>
<p>if you watch me play,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally just running around and jumping in circles</p>
<p>because I have to think about the conversation 100%.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do a complicated task</p>
<p>and think about the conversation.</p>
<p>Or, like, the people always joke in my chat,</p>
<p>like, oh, no, the notepad came out.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a really challenging conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get rid of the game,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll bring out a notepad,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll start writing stuff down</p>
<p>to keep track of what&rsquo;s going on, yeah.</p>
<p>So what kind of stuff do you stream?</p>
<p>So advice, you talk about-</p>
<p>Yeah, like, either I talk to chat</p>
<p>or I travel around, basically.</p>
<p>Like, have a conversation,</p>
<p>so we, like, go to countries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to, like, Italy.</p>
<p>I was in Italy for, like, one and a half months,</p>
<p>just, like, traveling around alone,</p>
<p>going to cities,</p>
<p>like, having, like, my camera with me</p>
<p>and, like, streaming for hours.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the coolest place you&rsquo;ve been to?</p>
<p>Ever?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably New Zealand.</p>
<p>New Zealand?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>After that, it&rsquo;s probably gonna be Italy, I think,</p>
<p>because I like history and, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, so both history,</p>
<p>because New Zealand is also beautiful.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both natural beauty and historical beauty.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I think I just really like the Polynesian sort of culture.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>like the ocean people,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just really beautiful.</p>
<p>People are very relaxed, chill.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very far away,</p>
<p>which is interesting as well,</p>
<p>because whenever they talk about politics</p>
<p>or they talk about just, like, the world,</p>
<p>it feels really far away.</p>
<p>So where&rsquo;s home for you?</p>
<p>Is Austin home?</p>
<p>Did you-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s home for me.</p>
<p>A human being is home?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lived in a lot of different places</p>
<p>and traveled around a lot.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you think of home as, like, humans?</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if there&rsquo;s gonna be a place,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably gonna be, like,</p>
<p>my childhood places, probably.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, my old country house or something like that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have it anymore,</p>
<p>but, like, that&rsquo;s, like, home for me, I guess.</p>
<p>So how&rsquo;d you guys meet each other?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re currently married.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>To each other, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To each other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just making sure we&rsquo;re on the same page.</p>
<p>All right, cool.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you guys meet?</p>
<p>I was watching his YouTube stuff, like, 2018, I think,</p>
<p>like, because it was the Swedish election around that time</p>
<p>and I was interested in politics.</p>
<p>And then I think he said in one of his videos</p>
<p>that he had an Instagram</p>
<p>and that he needed people to stop DMing him</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t cutie pies.</p>
<p>And then I messaged him and said,</p>
<p>am I a cutie pie?</p>
<p>And then you replied in, like, two minutes.</p>
<p>And then, that&rsquo;s when I was in New Zealand.</p>
<p>And I guess you wanted to escape America</p>
<p>or, like, LA for a little bit.</p>
<p>And that included New Zealand.</p>
<p>Where were you mentally there?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve talked through this timeline.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s 2018?</p>
<p>Was it 18, 19?</p>
<p>Where was the low point?</p>
<p>Or that was way earlier?</p>
<p>Low point, carpet cleaning.</p>
<p>That was, like, 2010.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>2018 was probably your peak.</p>
<p>Every day now is my peak.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Why would you say that?</p>
<p>Nobody ever admits being past their prime.</p>
<p>Just so you know.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, my prime is still coming up.</p>
<p>It was probably around the time</p>
<p>where you were getting a lot of lefties</p>
<p>through your community</p>
<p>and you were really, like,</p>
<p>thinking about that they would go too far.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I think that was still when Hasan and Vosh</p>
<p>were both in my community.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So I would say it feels like</p>
<p>there was not really, like, much issues</p>
<p>when it comes to your stuff</p>
<p>or, like, your work stuff back then.</p>
<p>Oh, something we didn&rsquo;t talk about is that, like,</p>
<p>there were no politics on Twitch.</p>
<p>I exclusively inhabited that place</p>
<p>for, like, two years</p>
<p>because nobody else did it</p>
<p>because it was a really toxic environment for politics.</p>
<p>So for a couple of years as it grew,</p>
<p>like, I kind of grew the whole space</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t, nobody was doing it yet.</p>
<p>What did that look like?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having, like, political debates,</p>
<p>political discourse.</p>
<p>Yeah, mainly, like, going into YouTube people</p>
<p>to try to argue with them</p>
<p>or just doing politics on stream,</p>
<p>like reading stories, researching stuff,</p>
<p>talking about stuff.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s not, like, other people on Twitch</p>
<p>to debate about politics</p>
<p>because there was no politics.</p>
<p>It was, yeah.</p>
<p>Was there a debate in the space of communism,</p>
<p>socialism, social democrats,</p>
<p>are you trying to outline your own position</p>
<p>during that time?</p>
<p>I think it was mainly me fighting against conservatives</p>
<p>because it was, like, Trump stuff.</p>
<p>And then it was coming off the back of, like,</p>
<p>there was this movement called Gamergate</p>
<p>and there was all this anti-SJW stuff on the internet.</p>
<p>And I was, like, the SJW, like, the progressive</p>
<p>that was fighting on the progressive side of things.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s what I was known for.</p>
<p>But I was fighting with people off of Twitch</p>
<p>because on Twitch,</p>
<p>there weren&rsquo;t very many political discussions happening.</p>
<p>So you were holding the SJW flag.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To what degree do you still hold it?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s the best,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the steelman case for SJW?</p>
<p>I mean, like, I&rsquo;m still very much that SJW</p>
<p>from 2018, 2019.</p>
<p>But the positions have moved so much farther left</p>
<p>that some people might not call me that anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>It depends on who I&rsquo;m talking to.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically, what is social justice?</p>
<p>Were you, like, being sensitive to the experience of others?</p>
<p>Yeah, being sensitive and empathetic</p>
<p>towards the experience of others</p>
<p>and then trying to build a better world</p>
<p>that, like, suits as many different types of people</p>
<p>as possible while being, like, aware of, like, their needs.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you guys met, like, from your perspective,</p>
<p>is that, is she telling lies?</p>
<p>Is it accurate?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s pretty accurate, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, when&rsquo;d you guys actually meet?</p>
<p>I flew out in 2019.</p>
<p>19, yeah, and, like, in February.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically, there was, like,</p>
<p>weird stuff happening in LA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d just come off of kind of a weird,</p>
<p>not kind of sort of relationship,</p>
<p>and I just wanted to, like, go away for a while.</p>
<p>Another company reached out to me,</p>
<p>and they had, like, a fun streaming device,</p>
<p>and they said they&rsquo;d sponsor a trip if I went somewhere.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, well, I know this person.</p>
<p>I know a couple of people in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Melina&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll go to New Zealand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be fun.</p>
<p>And, yeah, I did that for two weeks.</p>
<p>Do you guys believe in love?</p>
<p>I feel like you lack the gotcha got us into this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure to the degree to which you have human emotions.</p>
<p>I have quite a few.</p>
<p>Okay, from your perspective,</p>
<p>when did you fall in love with Melina?</p>
<p>When did you fall in love with Meli Mel?</p>
<p>The minute I saw her.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Our first two weeks together were a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We had a lot of chemistry in person.</p>
<p>I was kind of shocked I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about it,</p>
<p>because we spent a week together,</p>
<p>and you said, I really want to tell you something,</p>
<p>and you were stalling that for the longest time.</p>
<p>I think she was&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, she said, I love you?</p>
<p>No, he basically just said,</p>
<p>I really like you, and it never really happens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he said.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, and I thought, hey, I thought.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s still run.</p>
<p>We said Trump getting banned from Twitter.</p>
<p>Is that what we were talking about before?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, you agreed to me coming on here.</p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;m gonna be doing this to you.</p>
<p>So how long did that take?</p>
<p>Two weeks, you said?</p>
<p>It took like a week.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it was just like&hellip;</p>
<p>The thing is, my mind processes information so quickly.</p>
<p>Two weeks to somebody like you is actually years for me.</p>
<p>Oh, like me?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there was a lot of factorial type</p>
<p>of strategic thinking going on.</p>
<p>I was seeing all the events,</p>
<p>like Dr. Strange or whatever in the Avengers,</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s seeing into all the futures.</p>
<p>Oh, so when you saw me, you just saw the future?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was looking at all of them, yeah.</p>
<p>You were doing some game theoretic simulation</p>
<p>of all the possible outcomes?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But no, yeah, it was probably pretty soon I realized</p>
<p>that we had a lot of chemistry.</p>
<p>I think before I left after my two weeks there,</p>
<p>I was like, we need to make sure you got a ticket</p>
<p>to come visit me in the United States</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll be fun and everything.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>We kind of decided that last minute too.</p>
<p>It was really like five hours before your flight back.</p>
<p>We kind of realized because it was kind of like,</p>
<p>men, it&rsquo;s just like a one-time thing.</p>
<p>And then that was it.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re like, oh no, this is a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We should probably hang out again.</p>
<p>Oh, so you realized you would miss each other.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This was a one-time thing.</p>
<p>The melancholy side of love.</p>
<p>Okay, when did you fall in love with Steven?</p>
<p>I thought he hated me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I thought, not hated me.</p>
<p>She still thinks I hate her.</p>
<p>No, I remember what he said that he really liked me.</p>
<p>I was a little shocked about that.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There was a lot of random things happening in New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun,</p>
<p>but it was definitely very interesting things that happened</p>
<p>because I was around a lot of other people as well.</p>
<p>So I thought he might&rsquo;ve had a really bad time.</p>
<p>But when he said that, I was thinking about it more.</p>
<p>And then we spent more time together a week after that.</p>
<p>And then it felt like that was more real.</p>
<p>And I think when he was about to leave,</p>
<p>I kind of realized like, no, I really like him.</p>
<p>Do you guys ever say love to each other?</p>
<p>Like, I love you?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure.</p>
<p>Why would you ask that?</p>
<p>What has he said before?</p>
<p>Cause I haven&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard you speak.</p>
<p>The only time I&rsquo;ve heard Steven talk about love</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re like criticizing the Red Pill community,</p>
<p>saying they don&rsquo;t ever talk about love in relationships.</p>
<p>Almost all the time I&rsquo;m giving criticism to people.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m kind of stepping in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very disconnected from my own emotional experience</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to talk within there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty rare that I&rsquo;ll talk about.</p>
<p>What is your own emotional experience exactly?</p>
<p>Highly blunted, I guess.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s deep in there?</p>
<p>Are you, is this just who you are genetically</p>
<p>or are you running from something?</p>
<p>I think I have a pretty good understanding of myself.</p>
<p>A lot of people make that accusation to me,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I am.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is just who you are?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just who I am, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is not childhood stuff like trauma?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all sorted and done.</p>
<p>You figured it all out?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I figure old age as I grow every year,</p>
<p>I figure out more and more.</p>
<p>He did mention, I think I heard this somewhere</p>
<p>that this is a source of fights</p>
<p>for the two of you, the age thing.</p>
<p>I felt the ageism throughout this whole conversation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically, he&rsquo;s saying that he gambles like with time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like, oh, I think she will be good later.</p>
<p>And then just like-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an investment, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>When this treasury bond matures,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be able to cash out.</p>
<p>What do you think so far?</p>
<p>Is the stocks going up or?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tumultuous.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Like Bitcoin, crypto mill.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>If you guys don&rsquo;t mind,</p>
<p>one interesting aspect of your relationship</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re in an open relationship.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>From a game theoretic simulation perspective,</p>
<p>what went into that calculation?</p>
<p>And like, how does that-</p>
<p>Like how it started or?</p>
<p>Yeah, how did that started, sure.</p>
<p>The only relationships I&rsquo;ve ever done</p>
<p>has been open relationships</p>
<p>since I was like in high school.</p>
<p>Cause I didn&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>like why wouldn&rsquo;t you be able to like</p>
<p>do other things with other people,</p>
<p>but then just like have your main partner basically.</p>
<p>So what is an open relationship generally speaking?</p>
<p>That means you have one main partner?</p>
<p>Not a monogamous relationship.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re somehow allowed like in different ways.</p>
<p>You can see other people sexually.</p>
<p>Sexually, but like there&rsquo;s one main station.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be there for some people,</p>
<p>but like I think it&rsquo;s probably easier</p>
<p>and we probably don&rsquo;t really have time</p>
<p>or the energy for like more than</p>
<p>like one person to like really like-</p>
<p>What about like emotional?</p>
<p>Really complicated.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of complicated stuff going on</p>
<p>under the hood there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think broadly speaking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got like polyamorous relationships</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got like open relationships</p>
<p>where polyamorous is like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;ve got like three different girlfriends</p>
<p>and we all hang out or sometimes even live together</p>
<p>or three boyfriends, whatever.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got like open relationships,</p>
<p>which is like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>like you can basically hook up with other people</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got like your main relationship</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I think ours is probably somewhere in the middle of that</p>
<p>to where like we&rsquo;ve got like long-term friends,</p>
<p>some of them we hook up with</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of how we, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a delicate dance that explodes</p>
<p>every six months on itself.</p>
<p>So it does explode, you guys fight over it?</p>
<p>We fight over some things, yeah.</p>
<p>It things happen, yeah.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s mostly because a lot of people can&rsquo;t handle it</p>
<p>and they agree to something</p>
<p>and then they realize that we&rsquo;re way too cool</p>
<p>and then they get really obsessed</p>
<p>and they think that they can like get in there</p>
<p>and then it gets really dramatic.</p>
<p>Have you figured it out?</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>I feel like we figure out things more and more</p>
<p>like when it comes to like what&rsquo;s a good person</p>
<p>for us to hang out</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s not a good person for us to hang out with</p>
<p>or like I probably have more opinions</p>
<p>on like who he hangs out with</p>
<p>because he likes the fucking psychos.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you like to surround-</p>
<p>He likes the nut, like the crazy ones,</p>
<p>like the baby trap sort of women.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ones and I don&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>because that affects me.</p>
<p>That affects your game theoretical relation.</p>
<p>Right, you like to surround yourself</p>
<p>like in general you&rsquo;ve talked about with crazy people.</p>
<p>I say crazy and I really shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a humorous way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very unstable.</p>
<p>Can be unstable, but people that are very unique.</p>
<p>Like when I meet this person, that&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Not boring.</p>
<p>Yeah, not boring, yeah.</p>
<p>And you said that you&rsquo;re progressively</p>
<p>becoming not boring yourself.</p>
<p>No, I think I&rsquo;m pretty stable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t let them affect me much, but-</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think they affect your-</p>
<p>No, if I&rsquo;ve said that, I said it jokingly.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve like, I&rsquo;ve got my stuff</p>
<p>like really well figured out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what allows me to engage with people like this</p>
<p>so easily because I can engage,</p>
<p>I can make them feel seen and heard</p>
<p>and then if it gets insane, I can cut off</p>
<p>and I can be chill.</p>
<p>Like very few things affect me in the longterm.</p>
<p>Do you guys experience jealousy?</p>
<p>Usually like whenever I feel like he&rsquo;s not spending</p>
<p>the like the amount of time that I&rsquo;m asking for</p>
<p>and he spends it on his video games or his stream</p>
<p>or like he sees someone else like more than he sees me</p>
<p>or something like that, that would like not be good</p>
<p>because then it affects like our relationship.</p>
<p>Do you have a good sense of like,</p>
<p>is it literally time or is it the energy put into the-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably like if he&rsquo;s with me,</p>
<p>that like the attention and the time</p>
<p>like when he hangs out with me</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s also probably the time.</p>
<p>So if I feel like something else is distracting too much,</p>
<p>like it could be work or it could be a friend</p>
<p>or it could be anything.</p>
<p>Like if I feel like it starts to take away from like me,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m having an issue with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he really cares much.</p>
<p>I guess the only jealousy you experience</p>
<p>is probably when you feel like,</p>
<p>like if I get upset about him seeing someone too much</p>
<p>and then I go see someone more</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s like, why can&rsquo;t I go see my friend more</p>
<p>like as much as you?</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s the sort of like thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to navigate on, I guess.</p>
<p>I think we are like diametrically opposed sometimes</p>
<p>in terms of how we view like engagement with people</p>
<p>or engagement with the world sometimes.</p>
<p>So like on her end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>like a perfect week for her might be like being in a cabin,</p>
<p>watching like fireflies at night,</p>
<p>going hiking every morning, going swimming at the beach</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re taking in</p>
<p>like the grandeur of nature.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like connected with yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like very at peace.</p>
<p>Everything is like chill and cool.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the wind, the feeling of nature, everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like her peak living experience.</p>
<p>I like being present.</p>
<p>Yeah, and like my peak experiences</p>
<p>are like people trying to destroy my life,</p>
<p>like the challenge of like navigating</p>
<p>really complicated discussion,</p>
<p>like, you know, several different dramatic events</p>
<p>unfolding in my career.</p>
<p>Like these things are like very,</p>
<p>I like the stress and the action and the entertainment</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s like very cool for me.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re together,</p>
<p>she generally wants me to be like more chill.</p>
<p>But if I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m being like stimulated a lot,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s easy for like my mind to wander.</p>
<p>To wander somewhere else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the issue.</p>
<p>We have a very different way of like engaging with the world.</p>
<p>So how can you find happiness in the stillness?</p>
<p>I feel like if we&rsquo;re just like aware of it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying our best,</p>
<p>like whenever we like we&rsquo;re supposed to do this one thing.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that we want to go to New York</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, we should just like go out</p>
<p>and do this one specific thing.</p>
<p>We try to find something that he enjoys doing.</p>
<p>Like now that we&rsquo;re in Texas,</p>
<p>we can go shooting or do something fun that he enjoys</p>
<p>then we can do it.</p>
<p>And then I think like,</p>
<p>just like for me also to be aware</p>
<p>that like when he spends a lot of time on crazy people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not because he like loves them</p>
<p>or wants to be with them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just because he likes having his life destroyed.</p>
<p>Like you said, which I don&rsquo;t really do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a completely different thing.</p>
<p>So like for me to like understand more like how he&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so different from mine</p>
<p>and for him to understand how I&rsquo;m thinking about things</p>
<p>and like what I prioritize in my life,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like how we navigate.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I think the differences can be good.</p>
<p>Like when we&rsquo;re finding a way, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I think you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re relatable.</p>
<p>More of a human, you&rsquo;re an AI.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m definitely very difficult to get along with.</p>
<p>Like I always tell people that,</p>
<p>that like if you&rsquo;re dating me for like more than a few years,</p>
<p>like you get like an award for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a war zone that you&rsquo;ve survived.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re like a veteran, you get medals and stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always like,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s probably been like six different,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she says it anymore,</p>
<p>but there were like six different times in our relationship</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;s like, is it always like this?</p>
<p>Is this actually right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like every next year, it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>You lied in the beginning of about,</p>
<p>like you were lying about that.</p>
<p>Well, it got worse.</p>
<p>You were like, no, it&rsquo;s just like right now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a huge argument online</p>
<p>about saying the N-word in private.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to be like this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to be streaming 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, when are you going to go to bed?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a week.</p>
<p>Did playing League come into this?</p>
<p>A little bit, but I&rsquo;m clean.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m clean of League like six months right now.</p>
<p>What do you hate about League of Legends?</p>
<p>I never got-</p>
<p>The humans.</p>
<p>Well, speaking of which,</p>
<p>my participation in League involved on the robot side.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an improvement.</p>
<p>Because both with StarCraft II and League of Legends,</p>
<p>because OpenAI and DeepMind</p>
<p>both participated in creating bots in those.</p>
<p>I was a professional StarCraft II player,</p>
<p>so I remember when the AI started to play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, the types of restrictions</p>
<p>that you would have to put on like a gaming robot</p>
<p>to make it like functional</p>
<p>and not totally unfair to the other side.</p>
<p>Yeah, to make it human-like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Was that interesting to you,</p>
<p>to see AI be able to play those video games?</p>
<p>I think in some ways,</p>
<p>people think things are more complicated</p>
<p>than they actually are.</p>
<p>And I think video games is one of those things</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re like, oh my God,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a million possibilities at every second</p>
<p>and who knows?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, no, there&rsquo;s like three or four things</p>
<p>going on at any point in time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m willing to bet that like an AI</p>
<p>could probably solve some of these games like pretty easily,</p>
<p>especially if there are no constraints</p>
<p>on how they can learn, yeah.</p>
<p>Can I talk to you about relationships?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we already have, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, but more generally speaking,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t get a chance to talk</p>
<p>about the Red Pill community.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, what is the Red Pill community,</p>
<p>the metasphere in general?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get both of your opinions on this.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re probably not as opinionated on that whole.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, what do you think I am then?</p>
<p>Like, probably not as much as you,</p>
<p>but I do have opinions.</p>
<p>You do, okay.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t like speak out too much on it</p>
<p>because I feel like there&rsquo;s like a language barrier.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t really do politics</p>
<p>because this is my second language, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, you have to know the.</p>
<p>A little bit like that, yeah.</p>
<p>You know how to use,</p>
<p>have to use derogatory terms every other sentence</p>
<p>so they understand you, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about that.</p>
<p>But you also, you need like a good,</p>
<p>like you need to be able to like speak really well</p>
<p>for people to take you seriously, I think.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>like if I don&rsquo;t have like the words</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have the,</p>
<p>like I can&rsquo;t pronounce things correctly,</p>
<p>then people are not gonna say.</p>
<p>And a ESL person searching for words looks stupid,</p>
<p>essentially.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how people view it, yeah.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>I have a podcast that a bunch of people listen to</p>
<p>and I mumble and they, yeah.</p>
<p>Wait, what&rsquo;s your first language?</p>
<p>Russian.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>I speak both languages horribly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not, I&rsquo;m not like,</p>
<p>there is definitely a big disconnect</p>
<p>between my brain and my mouth module.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not able to generate the thoughts efficiently.</p>
<p>Like the things you&rsquo;re able to do,</p>
<p>like the da-da-da-da-da,</p>
<p>like speak like that, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very tough.</p>
<p>Plus there&rsquo;s a huge amount of anxiety</p>
<p>and social interaction that I have,</p>
<p>which makes speaking even harder.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>I understand it, man.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>The gotcha is both a symbol of compassion</p>
<p>and derision at once.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just letting you know,</p>
<p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna sit there and stare at you in silence.</p>
<p>Confirm, echo.</p>
<p>No, you can just say like, yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it, gotcha.</p>
<p>No, no, gotcha sounds, no, it&rsquo;s so short.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, say a longer sentence,</p>
<p>but that means the same thing.</p>
<p>I understand you.</p>
<p>Yeah, good, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, not chills, you know?</p>
<p>You get chills, so you understand me.</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels good.</p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p>And like, if you just like hold the other person&rsquo;s hand,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even better.</p>
<p>You gotta put in some emotion there, okay?</p>
<p>Show that you have some.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>What do you think about, gotcha.</p>
<p>What do you think about red pill?</p>
<p>What, sorry, what is it, first of all,</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>Yeah, the red pill community,</p>
<p>obviously it&rsquo;s the matrix reference.</p>
<p>The red pill that you take is when you realize</p>
<p>what dating standards and norms really are in the world,</p>
<p>that men are providers and have to become some great thing</p>
<p>to hunt and attract, you know,</p>
<p>the woman who are just kind of there,</p>
<p>floating around, looking for people</p>
<p>to give them the most resources.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like coming to a realization</p>
<p>of what the world of dating really is,</p>
<p>broken away from the Hollywood standards</p>
<p>and the romantic stuff that they try to sell you</p>
<p>in, you know, stores.</p>
<p>So there was kind of,</p>
<p>maybe you can kind of educate me on this,</p>
<p>but red pill used to be associated with just,</p>
<p>maybe anti-establishment views, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe Republican conservative viewpoints,</p>
<p>maybe alt-right. People use,</p>
<p>yeah, they use red pill a lot in like different communities.</p>
<p>Like when you say the red pill community.</p>
<p>Yeah, that usually means dating.</p>
<p>The dating thing.</p>
<p>But a lot of people say, oh, Trump voters, they&rsquo;re red pilled.</p>
<p>Are you red pilled on like politics or whatever?</p>
<p>People will say stuff like that, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like the manosphere,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all the similar type of stuff.</p>
<p>And Andrew Tate is somebody that represents</p>
<p>kind of the figurehead.</p>
<p>Of the manosphere of like the red pill stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, cool.</p>
<p>So what are some ideas that they represent</p>
<p>and what do you think about them?</p>
<p>I think they do a good job at speaking</p>
<p>to disaffected young men who feel like</p>
<p>the rest of the world has kind of left them behind</p>
<p>or isn&rsquo;t willing to speak to them.</p>
<p>And they do identify some true and real problems.</p>
<p>It feels like on the left,</p>
<p>we have a really hard time doing like self-improvement</p>
<p>or telling people how to better themselves.</p>
<p>We focus too much on like structural or systemic issues</p>
<p>rather than what can an individual do</p>
<p>to uplift or empower themselves.</p>
<p>And it also feels like they do a good job</p>
<p>at speaking to some of the positive aspects of masculinity.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s okay to be like strong and brave</p>
<p>and a soldier and a warrior and provide for your family</p>
<p>and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So I would say like those are like positive messages,</p>
<p>like self-improvement and everything</p>
<p>that come from the red pill community.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the negative?</p>
<p>I think the analysis on how men and women interact</p>
<p>is a way too transactional.</p>
<p>All of like the romanticism and love and chemistry</p>
<p>is totally sucked out of it.</p>
<p>Everything is very like sex-based,</p>
<p>like how do you basically have sex</p>
<p>with the most amount of women possible</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna make you happy.</p>
<p>And then I think people&rsquo;s motivations sometimes</p>
<p>are just spoken about in such a shallow derogatory way</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think is always reflective of reality.</p>
<p>Like a woman only wants you</p>
<p>because you make six figures and you&rsquo;re tall</p>
<p>and a guy only wants you</p>
<p>because he wants to have sex with you and blah, blah.</p>
<p>Like it feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of that going on a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that misses some fundamental aspect</p>
<p>about relationships, about meaningful relationships</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I&rsquo;ve never heard red pill people ever,</p>
<p>ever talk about like meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always just how to get in one</p>
<p>or how to have sex really.</p>
<p>Mel, what bothers you about some of that philosophy?</p>
<p>I feel like the people that are like the red pill people,</p>
<p>I feel like their solution</p>
<p>is something that doesn&rsquo;t actually work out.</p>
<p>Or it works out for some people,</p>
<p>people that makes a lot of money</p>
<p>and is like really successful in that sort of way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not gonna help most men out there.</p>
<p>So I feel like it&rsquo;s just like a pointless speech</p>
<p>to give to these like really lost guys.</p>
<p>And they really do believe that they can become successful,</p>
<p>they can get money</p>
<p>and when they get all these things, they can get girls.</p>
<p>But most of them is not gonna achieve that ever.</p>
<p>To get the money part or become successful?</p>
<p>Just become a billionaire,</p>
<p>and you will get all the girls and which is true,</p>
<p>but not everyone can do that.</p>
<p>So I feel like when these guys are speaking to these men</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>we just care about these men out there,</p>
<p>they need to hear this.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really help a lot of them.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t inspire them to develop compassion</p>
<p>towards the opposite sex,</p>
<p>which is probably something required</p>
<p>to have a meaningful relationship.</p>
<p>And also like they seem to complain a lot about women,</p>
<p>like only wanting men that have money and that&rsquo;s tall</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s muscular or whatever, all those things.</p>
<p>But they complain about that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s like also kind of what they&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>make the men try to do for themselves.</p>
<p>So they kind of like fall into the same sort of behavior</p>
<p>and it seems like they&rsquo;re kind of unaware of that as well.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just playing a part of the game</p>
<p>instead of trying to find a woman</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t look for those things</p>
<p>and that are looking for not those things, yeah.</p>
<p>I actually would love to have like straight up data</p>
<p>on people in that world versus not in that world,</p>
<p>how often they get laid.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like literally, so I think for sure,</p>
<p>people in that world have fewer meaningful</p>
<p>long-term relationships that are fulfilling,</p>
<p>that actually helped them succeed in life,</p>
<p>that helped them be happy and content</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But just even the straight up,</p>
<p>the shallow goal of getting laid, I wonder.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very possible that like just the roughness</p>
<p>with which they treat intellectually women,</p>
<p>that might lead to lower success, not higher success.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very adversarial,</p>
<p>which I think is always disappointing.</p>
<p>Anything that talks about men and women,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good to acknowledge differences,</p>
<p>but when it becomes like adversarial,</p>
<p>especially when you talk about sex,</p>
<p>sex is something that men are getting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that women are giving</p>
<p>and that type of like trade-off</p>
<p>and the way they talk about it is like,</p>
<p>yeah, it sets people against each other</p>
<p>in a really toxic way, I think.</p>
<p>How do you talk to people from that world,</p>
<p>from the red pill world?</p>
<p>Like would you ever talk to like somebody like Andrew Tate?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, if I had the chance to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on the Fresh and Fit podcast a few times</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ve got a friend, Sneeko,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like very red pill, that stuff.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m trying to talk to them,</p>
<p>usually it&rsquo;s kind of like approaching it like a scared cat.</p>
<p>The first thing you have to do is like be very gentle</p>
<p>and say like, I understand your issues,</p>
<p>I understand your complaints,</p>
<p>I know that I&rsquo;m scary because you think I&rsquo;m gonna say</p>
<p>like toxic masculinity and feminism</p>
<p>and all these scary words at you.</p>
<p>So the first thing is always to recognize it.</p>
<p>Like a lot of what they talk about,</p>
<p>there are like true aspects to what they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>that people on the left won&rsquo;t recognize.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s good to acknowledge those things</p>
<p>that like men and women are kind of different.</p>
<p>We do look for different things in general</p>
<p>when it comes to relationships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to say that, there&rsquo;s nothing bad there.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;ll usually be like, once I&rsquo;ve got your trust</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in your bubble,</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s talk about the things that you want</p>
<p>and maybe some of the strategies that you&rsquo;re employing</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t necessarily gonna get you</p>
<p>some of the things that you want.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re really worried</p>
<p>about like shallow girls, like ruining your life,</p>
<p>like Melina said, it&rsquo;s probably not best</p>
<p>to build your entire worldview</p>
<p>around trying to get shallow girls</p>
<p>that are gonna ruin your life.</p>
<p>Like if your way of attracting a girl</p>
<p>is to go to the gym, get a whole bunch of money</p>
<p>and try to like flaunt your wealth as much as possible,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be attracting the very same type of women</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re here like decrying on your stream.</p>
<p>You think we talked about that on the podcast,</p>
<p>like you probably wanna have a woman that&rsquo;s gonna be there</p>
<p>if you lose your job, it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>Like that cares about the things that&rsquo;s not just your job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more stable.</p>
<p>And also I don&rsquo;t help you become a great man</p>
<p>or a great like grow.</p>
<p>Like I feel like a great friendship and a partnership,</p>
<p>like it helps you make you a better person.</p>
<p>Some of the most successful people I know,</p>
<p>I mean, they have families</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s clearly a dynamic there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like that makes them,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t be that without.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not an island, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the kids actually a big part of that too.</p>
<p>Like for most people, if you&rsquo;re like a good parent,</p>
<p>they make you step up somehow in life.</p>
<p>You have to take responsibility</p>
<p>for getting your shit together</p>
<p>and excelling in ways that I guess the philosophy</p>
<p>of the Red Bull does not quite get to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always an interesting,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve asked that a couple of times</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>would you let your daughter date Andrew Tate?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always funny to watch them</p>
<p>kind of like squirm around those answers sometimes.</p>
<p>But see, if they don&rsquo;t have a daughter,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t have a daughter,</p>
<p>I think your whole philosophy changes</p>
<p>once you have a daughter.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But even at that, like they can,</p>
<p>they know that what they&rsquo;re answering,</p>
<p>they feel a little bit weird about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to watch them,</p>
<p>even they know it&rsquo;s like, ah, fuck, you know?</p>
<p>Well, they might say like,</p>
<p>I want my daughter to date like a high value male</p>
<p>to the degree that he&rsquo;s a high value male, yes.</p>
<p>But like, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll feel that way.</p>
<p>The definition of high value changes completely.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Certainly the stereotypical measures of value</p>
<p>contribute to the calculation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so much more than that.</p>
<p>I think the chemistry of the whole thing is bigger.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also mentioned about body count.</p>
<p>You guys both have a high body count.</p>
<p>Does body count matter?</p>
<p>Or it depends, like you said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s low in some people&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s high in other people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Does body count matter in relationships?</p>
<p>Does the past matter?</p>
<p>Well, the past matters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think body count.</p>
<p>Not to me, I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>Not just as it is, no.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be.</p>
<p>What the past does.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the past is who you are, right?</p>
<p>Like somebody tells me like they have a 200 body count</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re 16.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s probably going on there that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>I was thinking about that too, like,</p>
<p>because it could be like really young people</p>
<p>that are having some sort of like mental.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Or somebody is like 45</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve like never had sex before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably something going on, right?</p>
<p>So it could be indicative.</p>
<p>But if somebody is like in their 20s</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve had sex with, you know,</p>
<p>a hundred people or 50 people, whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more experience, which can be good.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay, so that just represents you&rsquo;re like sexually open</p>
<p>and so it doesn&rsquo;t really necessarily mean any kind of.</p>
<p>Not necessarily, it could though.</p>
<p>The number alone doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, you could meet a guy that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I just really, really like when I fuck a lot of people</p>
<p>because it makes me so cool.</p>
<p>Like, you can meet someone like that,</p>
<p>which is like, maybe.</p>
<p>So the body count doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>but like where it comes from.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, like why have you slept</p>
<p>with the people that you slept with, I guess.</p>
<p>Does it hurt like the romantic aspect of the relationship,</p>
<p>knowing that there&rsquo;s a lot of people in the past?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Not for us.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Is a part of the relationship fundamentally romantic?</p>
<p>For us?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d say so.</p>
<p>Yeah, for us, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You come off as such a cold person.</p>
<p>No, I was just in my head thinking</p>
<p>and I wanted to just say gotcha right there.</p>
<p>Oh, nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so judgmental.</p>
<p>I think when it comes to the sex thing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always like, the way that I explain it is,</p>
<p>and I understand like, I have to say this</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t advocate for what I do for everybody</p>
<p>or what she does for everybody.</p>
<p>Because obviously there&rsquo;s a whole bunch</p>
<p>of natural feelings of jealousy</p>
<p>that pop up for a lot of people.</p>
<p>But when people ask me, you know, it&rsquo;s always like,</p>
<p>oh, like, isn&rsquo;t this like horrible</p>
<p>that you guys are doing this and you don&rsquo;t love each other?</p>
<p>From my perspective, I can have sex with like any person</p>
<p>and it can be sex.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s not like a special thing</p>
<p>between two people in my eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, anybody can have sex.</p>
<p>But there are like certain activities</p>
<p>and ways that you can spend time with each other</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like carving out</p>
<p>these like precious little moments in time</p>
<p>with a certain person that can do things</p>
<p>that are special to that person.</p>
<p>And those are the kind of like events</p>
<p>that I remember more than anything else.</p>
<p>So like the idea of like, oh, wow,</p>
<p>I had sex with a person that was so special</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean as much as like, you know,</p>
<p>us traveling to like New Zealand</p>
<p>or sharing some special moment</p>
<p>doing like some really fun activity or event or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually how I look at it, yeah.</p>
<p>So a shared intimate moment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I kind of agree,</p>
<p>but I can definitely connect the romance with sex.</p>
<p>Boring.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious why you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s a woman.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s where the red pill&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what you said.</p>
<p>We also talked about misogyny,</p>
<p>which is clearly the embodiment of that.</p>
<p>What were you saying?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some, there&rsquo;s a connection between romance and-</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it is</p>
<p>because I think sex could be a lot of things, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some sort of bonding, I&rsquo;d say, in some way.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you really like BDSM.</p>
<p>You kind of like, you become submissive to someone</p>
<p>or you take control over someone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a very bonding, intimate moment, I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s romantic.</p>
<p>The intimacy is romantic.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>If you can show yourself as really submissive or weak,</p>
<p>or you have absolutely no control over yourself</p>
<p>and you let someone else do it,</p>
<p>or you are the one being that,</p>
<p>like you are the dominant for someone,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really intimate thing</p>
<p>because you show the weakest part of yourself, kind of.</p>
<p>I just feel like I personally,</p>
<p>to me, some component of romantic,</p>
<p>but to me, this is not judging to others.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s how I was brought up.</p>
<p>The romance increases if the number of intimate interactions</p>
<p>are limited to one person.</p>
<p>For me, for some reason, spreading it out</p>
<p>decreases exponentially the feeling of romance you feel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what, that could be just like</p>
<p>sort of having grown up in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of, there&rsquo;s the fairy tale stories</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of maybe living through them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is like really normal.</p>
<p>Most people probably feel that way, yeah.</p>
<p>But because you guys are able to successfully not do that,</p>
<p>I just wanna question my own understanding of it, you know?</p>
<p>Like why is that?</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Why am I being very jealous for no reason?</p>
<p>Maybe you can maximize the number of intimate experiences</p>
<p>if you just open up and let go of the jealousy, essentially.</p>
<p>I feel like in Sweden, like in Scandinavia,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re extremely just sexually open, like in general.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not like super religious either.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very like relaxed.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t feel bad about ourselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a different sort of thing.</p>
<p>And I would say like we&rsquo;re more progressive</p>
<p>when it comes to feminism and stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more common they will meet women</p>
<p>with a higher body count than like,</p>
<p>when I meet like American girls,</p>
<p>all of them have like vaginismus,</p>
<p>like super suppressed like sexually.</p>
<p>And they have like-</p>
<p>Wait, what did you just use?</p>
<p>They have like issues to like,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t relax during sex, so it just hurts for them.</p>
<p>Vaginismus.</p>
<p>Vaginismus, isn&rsquo;t that what it&rsquo;s called?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like I meet so many girls</p>
<p>that are having like a lot of issues with sex</p>
<p>and they have like a very low body count</p>
<p>because they just can&rsquo;t relax or they, yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably, and usually they come</p>
<p>from like a very religious background.</p>
<p>So they have just been told, like, you cannot wear that.</p>
<p>You cannot be like that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t like, you know, and like where I grew up,</p>
<p>it was not like that at all.</p>
<p>We just see it as more like a casual thing.</p>
<p>So then you could just maximize</p>
<p>the awesomeness of the experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to trouble over it.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>I think the important thing I think for everybody to realize</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s always pros and cons to everything.</p>
<p>Like my lifestyle,</p>
<p>like obviously I get to have a lot of fun experiences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a huge pro and that&rsquo;s super cool.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re like a more monogamy brain person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get those experiences.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a monogamy brain person,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re sharing that special moment in time</p>
<p>with somebody else,</p>
<p>like that moment can be really, really, really special</p>
<p>because now it&rsquo;s the thing that you&rsquo;re showing yourself</p>
<p>and opening yourself up to another person</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re only trusting you to do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a really special thing</p>
<p>that only the two of you are sharing with each other.</p>
<p>So, I mean like there&rsquo;s always like pros and cons</p>
<p>to everything.</p>
<p>Like, I think we both would say like,</p>
<p>like doing an open relationship is probably not,</p>
<p>like we would not recommend it.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, of course not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we would, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, I recently fasted for three days</p>
<p>and I ate a chicken breast at the end of that.</p>
<p>And it was like the most delicious food I&rsquo;ve ever eaten.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s some aspect of fasting and scarcity</p>
<p>and so on that like,</p>
<p>and you have to figure out what for your own psyche,</p>
<p>what works the best.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good to be a little bored</p>
<p>or like not do something or like work</p>
<p>because you can just enjoy the time</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing something really fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more fun, otherwise you&rsquo;re just gonna get numb</p>
<p>in general with everything, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I personally just never get bored.</p>
<p>Like, I guess the boring thing is exciting to me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like me because everything I like is boring.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you, we talked about misogyny</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to battle it out on the internet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense as a woman</p>
<p>about the level of misogyny in the internet,</p>
<p>in the streaming community and how to fight it?</p>
<p>For me, I guess I get it every single day somehow.</p>
<p>Like, because I have an online,</p>
<p>like I have a chat that&rsquo;s live, right?</p>
<p>But I have like mods moderating that all the time</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t really need to see much of it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just pretty annoying</p>
<p>because you get to like see it all the time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s become like background noise?</p>
<p>Yeah, a little bit and it&rsquo;s like the same comments</p>
<p>over and over again.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s usually for me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t personally care that much.</p>
<p>I understand that other people do,</p>
<p>especially when it comes into like,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s like a lot of sexism and stuff.</p>
<p>And when there&rsquo;s a lot of like men</p>
<p>not taking women seriously, like I definitely get that.</p>
<p>And I used to get that even more like a few years ago</p>
<p>with my accent and everything.</p>
<p>And like I used to be blonde as well, like a few months ago.</p>
<p>So I feel like people wouldn&rsquo;t take me seriously</p>
<p>because of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bit annoying,</p>
<p>but I feel like it&rsquo;s pretty easy to like see through</p>
<p>when someone acts that way.</p>
<p>And for me personally, I don&rsquo;t really care,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a bit annoying.</p>
<p>And like being online</p>
<p>and like getting stuff every single day,</p>
<p>I would say like probably the worst thing is</p>
<p>when you feel like you put in a lot of effort</p>
<p>into some sort of work,</p>
<p>everyone is just gonna say,</p>
<p>you just got that because you&rsquo;re a woman</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re attractive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably like the worst thing.</p>
<p>Is there a way to fight that you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think you can.</p>
<p>I think it just comes up all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it is what it is, I guess.</p>
<p>You just gotta keep doing whatever you do</p>
<p>and like not let it like emotionally control you somehow.</p>
<p>I think having more women in those spaces is always good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably good, yeah.</p>
<p>Like a lot of the guys you can tell online</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t ever-</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bring on the worst ones then, Steven.</p>
<p>See, she just did it.</p>
<p>She did the misogyny thing.</p>
<p>By having some bad women on,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s saying all women, see?</p>
<p>Well, you know it&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>See, but I disagree with you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m older than both of you</p>
<p>and therefore wiser, right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Well, combined, we&rsquo;re older than you.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re old.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re one only matronomy.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve got combined age.</p>
<p>Or it could be the same thing as like,</p>
<p>also the age thing and like the woman thing.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that I&rsquo;m just copying</p>
<p>every single thing that he says,</p>
<p>which I think is a bit annoying as well.</p>
<p>So I can never really like-</p>
<p>Oh, Sonic used to have that one thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is a bit annoying.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I like it so much, you know?</p>
<p>It was about the defunding police.</p>
<p>Like my dad is a cop.</p>
<p>I like friendship, camaraderie and love and respect,</p>
<p>which you both have had for a time and have lost</p>
<p>and I would like you to regain it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to increase,</p>
<p>not decrease the amount of love in the space.</p>
<p>What do you think about some of the harshness</p>
<p>of his language, which we talked about?</p>
<p>R-word in the past when he used N-word,</p>
<p>all of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Funny what he used to do.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>No, like, what do you think about it?</p>
<p>Like, do you give him advice?</p>
<p>To not speak a certain way?</p>
<p>No, like a little more civility.</p>
<p>I was just trying to get a second opinion on this.</p>
<p>Second opinion about-</p>
<p>Normie people, non-internet people</p>
<p>are way more extreme than she&rsquo;s way more extreme.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s the thing for me, okay?</p>
<p>I was not online until three years ago at all.</p>
<p>Like I would watch YouTube.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much all I would do.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything else, really.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t grow up playing video games or anything.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like extremely new to everything.</p>
<p>So when I came into this world</p>
<p>and I started seeing clips from him in the past,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I really had much of an opinion</p>
<p>because it just sounded like it was just a different,</p>
<p>like words that we&rsquo;re using, but it didn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it feels.</p>
<p>It was just like, if you&rsquo;re saying the R-word,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because you just want to call someone stupid,</p>
<p>but you want to like do it a little bit more.</p>
<p>Like, but it&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t feel like it was like a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like racist, more like, you know, it&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>Agreement on this side here, right?</p>
<p>So like, if he was saying the F-word</p>
<p>because it was just like a word to like insult someone</p>
<p>and he was like, I don&rsquo;t think he was ever,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you were ever homophobic back in the day</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>But I think it was just like a way</p>
<p>to express yourself maybe back then.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no videos of me or anything</p>
<p>because I wasn&rsquo;t even online back then.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So my case was, I definitely don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>Steven is homophobic or racist or any of those, obviously.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a good heart there and a good mind.</p>
<p>I was just saying-</p>
<p>He just likes being mean, I think.</p>
<p>Well, there is some, you lose yourself</p>
<p>and forget the bigger picture that he&rsquo;s pushing</p>
<p>for more effective discourse on the internet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like an inspiration to a lot of people,</p>
<p>especially now, of like how you can use</p>
<p>effective conversation to make for a better world,</p>
<p>to radicalize people and so on.</p>
<p>And then you lose some of that power</p>
<p>by losing yourself in like the language,</p>
<p>just more language of emotion</p>
<p>versus effective communication.</p>
<p>I would say-</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a gray area.</p>
<p>I would say like something that is probably</p>
<p>recently done in that case,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s been joking about women a lot.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s fault, they&rsquo;re bad.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s been like a lot of jokes</p>
<p>when it comes to misogyny, I guess, in your community.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s actually turned people</p>
<p>a little bit that way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve done the recent misogyny.</p>
<p>Yes, so that, I guess that&rsquo;s actually true</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think it was pretty,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was clear enough.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it actually was.</p>
<p>I think you did that mistake.</p>
<p>But I think back then I was even saying like,</p>
<p>hey, you should probably not,</p>
<p>like you probably should not do that.</p>
<p>Because it actually is pretty hard for me</p>
<p>because whenever I come into his community,</p>
<p>like his chat, people are just gonna spam.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a woman moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a woman moment whenever I say something</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of like, yeah, it&rsquo;s getting pretty annoying.</p>
<p>As I said, it&rsquo;s just annoying</p>
<p>when you see it every single day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Wisdom from somebody younger than you.</p>
<p>Wisdom can come from all kinds of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Just sometimes in very limited quantities</p>
<p>depends on the age.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>You can learn something from anybody.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people,</p>
<p>the both of you?</p>
<p>That you have both audiences</p>
<p>where young people look up to you.</p>
<p>In general, if you were to give advice</p>
<p>to somebody in high school,</p>
<p>like how to create a life that can be proud of,</p>
<p>what would you say?</p>
<p>The most important thing that I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>is to view people as different and not better or worse.</p>
<p>And when you view people as different</p>
<p>instead of better or worse,</p>
<p>you learn that there&rsquo;s almost something</p>
<p>that you can learn from anybody.</p>
<p>Like be open and empathetic</p>
<p>towards other people&rsquo;s experiences.</p>
<p>Nobody does anything by random choice.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s always reasons why people act the way they do.</p>
<p>And as long as you&rsquo;re willing to kind of like</p>
<p>be open and receptive to the lived experiences</p>
<p>of other people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to gather information</p>
<p>and create like a more cohesive</p>
<p>and better view of the world</p>
<p>than any of your peers will.</p>
<p>Do you have any kind of advice</p>
<p>you can give to young folks?</p>
<p>I feel like something that I see,</p>
<p>especially in America a lot,</p>
<p>is that a lot of people kind of get told what to do</p>
<p>early on, like in high school,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re supposed to become this thing,</p>
<p>like education wise,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re supposed to like become a doctor</p>
<p>or this thing or whatever.</p>
<p>And then they kind of just like give up on things</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actually passionate about.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of teenagers get really confused.</p>
<p>They get an education and then they get that job</p>
<p>and they hate everything.</p>
<p>And they think that when they&rsquo;re reaching the job,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re reaching like the journey,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get happy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like where the happiness is gonna be.</p>
<p>But then when they get to there,</p>
<p>they just hate everything.</p>
<p>And then they become really depressed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen this so much.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve seen this all the time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty sad to me to see so many people</p>
<p>that are just wasting time.</p>
<p>And then they just get really confused.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing with relationships too.</p>
<p>No one really knows what they want anymore.</p>
<p>I feel like everyone is just kind of doing whatever</p>
<p>like society is saying,</p>
<p>or their parents are saying,</p>
<p>or their friends are saying.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re never really doing anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super meaningful anymore.</p>
<p>And like they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>so what I would say is like try to find something</p>
<p>that is important to you.</p>
<p>It could be anything really,</p>
<p>like some sort of passion,</p>
<p>maybe like your friends,</p>
<p>maybe like what matters to you.</p>
<p>Like figuring those things out,</p>
<p>I think is really important.</p>
<p>And that comes from being able to listen</p>
<p>to like some inner voice.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not gonna come from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess, it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re living the life</p>
<p>and like there&rsquo;s things happening around you</p>
<p>and people tell you what to do</p>
<p>and what not to do.</p>
<p>No one really has like their own opinions.</p>
<p>Everyone is just kind of like listening</p>
<p>to the cooler thing or, you know.</p>
<p>Except Steven, he seems to stand on his own.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;d say so.</p>
<p>And like something I realized too,</p>
<p>like, cause we just went to TwitchCon</p>
<p>and we were talking to a lot of streamers.</p>
<p>How was that?</p>
<p>It was interesting.</p>
<p>I thought it was interesting</p>
<p>because the few people that I feel like I,</p>
<p>that seem really cool</p>
<p>and that I look up to like in the streaming world,</p>
<p>all of them wants to quit streaming.</p>
<p>All of them wants to do it.</p>
<p>No one wants, like no one likes it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re so successful.</p>
<p>Like they are around successful people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working every single day.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working hard.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making so much money</p>
<p>and everyone is just complaining.</p>
<p>And like, they&rsquo;re complaining about</p>
<p>like not being able to see their partner or, you know,</p>
<p>because they need to live somewhere else.</p>
<p>Because I see these things</p>
<p>and they seem extremely unhappy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s so hard for them to just like</p>
<p>cut all this successful stuff off</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s like what you, you know, learn to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like supposed to be like your happiness,</p>
<p>but it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Everyone is really unhappy.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>maybe streaming is different,</p>
<p>but YouTube folks too have interacted with a few.</p>
<p>And even in podcasting space,</p>
<p>people become obsessed about the views</p>
<p>and numbers and subscribers and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So I turn, I never talk about that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pay attention to that.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s a drug that destroys your mind.</p>
<p>Your mind as an artist,</p>
<p>ability to create truly unique things.</p>
<p>Also your mind in terms of the anxiety,</p>
<p>the ups and downs of the attention mechanism.</p>
<p>And then also being just,</p>
<p>if something that you make is not popular,</p>
<p>but it meant a lot to you,</p>
<p>you will think of it less because it&rsquo;s not popular.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really dangerous thing.</p>
<p>And because everyone around you is reinforcing,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ll get messages like,</p>
<p>wow, this thing got this many views or something.</p>
<p>Great job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, you don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, everyone is enforcing this language</p>
<p>of views and likes and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s correlated of course,</p>
<p>because truly impactful things</p>
<p>will get a lot of attention often.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, on the individual local scale,</p>
<p>like temporarily, it can really fuck with your mind.</p>
<p>And I see that in the creators,</p>
<p>they become addicts to the algorithm.</p>
<p>Lost in chasing views.</p>
<p>We know friends that, we know cool people,</p>
<p>and then they start streaming</p>
<p>and eventually they&rsquo;re like chasing the dragon of like.</p>
<p>And they change, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like hard to engage for them anymore.</p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve always said,</p>
<p>one of the biggest blessings and biggest curses of humanity</p>
<p>is we are very good at acclimating.</p>
<p>You can become paralyzed,</p>
<p>you can have all sorts of horrible things happen to you,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get used to it and you&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have a good baseline.</p>
<p>But it works the other way too,</p>
<p>in that you can get more and more and more and more</p>
<p>and you acclimate to it almost immediately.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, this is a phenomenon</p>
<p>that I bet it happens in the YouTube world,</p>
<p>but I know it happens in the streaming world</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re streaming 1,000 viewers every day,</p>
<p>huge event happens and you blow up</p>
<p>and you got like 15,000 viewers for a day or two.</p>
<p>And then it starts to go down and down and down</p>
<p>and down and down.</p>
<p>And then after all the drama stayed off,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re at like 3,000 concurrent viewers.</p>
<p>Now in the macro, you went from 1,000 to 3,000,</p>
<p>that feels awesome.</p>
<p>But you actually feel like shit the whole time</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re remembering when you had 10 or 15,000</p>
<p>and now everything feels horrible.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see people climb over time and like, fuck,</p>
<p>like, but whatever that one huge stream I had,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, dude, you&rsquo;re doing great.</p>
<p>Yeah, that happens a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many people that we know</p>
<p>that we find super, super cool.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re passionate about things.</p>
<p>They have so much interest</p>
<p>and then they just get like so addicted to these numbers</p>
<p>and like all the, everything is just ruined.</p>
<p>Like all the cool things about them is ruined</p>
<p>because they stopped doing the things</p>
<p>that they actually like to do something else</p>
<p>that gives them more viewers and more money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really sad to see.</p>
<p>Yeah, that temporary sacrifice that seems temporary</p>
<p>is that it actually destroys you.</p>
<p>Like for one time, making a choice,</p>
<p>because I come across those choices often.</p>
<p>Like I can do this.</p>
<p>You can kind of know what&rsquo;s going to be popular and not.</p>
<p>And you have to ask yourself the question,</p>
<p>like, is this going to sacrifice?</p>
<p>Because people are sacrificing like intimate relationships.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sacrificing time with their family.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sacrificing time with the things</p>
<p>that they feel good about and that they like.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I kind of realized last year</p>
<p>because I was working so much</p>
<p>and I was just grinding, grinding, grinding.</p>
<p>But it was because it was kind of new for me.</p>
<p>And then new years came by and I was like,</p>
<p>wait, what did I even do like the entire year?</p>
<p>Like I traveled to a bunch of places,</p>
<p>but nothing actually really meant anything to me</p>
<p>because I felt like I was just working the entire time.</p>
<p>I felt like I was just numb through the entire year.</p>
<p>And I was really scary.</p>
<p>Like I rented like a super pretty house</p>
<p>like for a week with my dad and my sister</p>
<p>because I wanted to spend time with them.</p>
<p>But the entire time I was just streaming</p>
<p>and I actually didn&rsquo;t ever like calm down</p>
<p>and just like chill with them.</p>
<p>And I like, that&rsquo;s like time I&rsquo;ll never get back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit about the money that I made that week,</p>
<p>but I lost the time.</p>
<p>And like, that is really important to me.</p>
<p>And I, yeah.</p>
<p>And a lot of people are doing that.</p>
<p>And I feel like you, as you said,</p>
<p>like you can definitely see that in like artists for sure.</p>
<p>I feel like if you look at like artists</p>
<p>like back in the sixties or seventies,</p>
<p>I feel like things were just so much better back then.</p>
<p>And it feels like they were actually making music</p>
<p>that meant something to them.</p>
<p>They were actually making art.</p>
<p>And I feel like today everything is just kind of like</p>
<p>whatever is cool, whatever sells, whatever, you know,</p>
<p>sounds in a certain way,</p>
<p>everything is kind of the same thing.</p>
<p>And everything that is very artistic and very cool</p>
<p>is actually not that popular at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of sad, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, there&rsquo;s now bigger mechanisms</p>
<p>and platforms to spread stuff, music.</p>
<p>So as long as you could be content with not being popular,</p>
<p>I think you can still create art.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not like when people get a little popular,</p>
<p>they get addicted to that so fast.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>You have been somewhat good,</p>
<p>at least from my outside of perspective,</p>
<p>because I think you, I can at least imagine</p>
<p>you making choices that could make you more popular</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t seem to make those choices.</p>
<p>Like sabotage my career, like frankly.</p>
<p>But it is very intentional, like you said,</p>
<p>and I made that choice at every single stage of my life.</p>
<p>One is because from the perspective</p>
<p>of being a carpet cleaner,</p>
<p>my life is way better than that was or ever would have been.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m already doing way better</p>
<p>than I ever thought somebody like me ever could be.</p>
<p>But then two, I super love my job.</p>
<p>Every time I wake up,</p>
<p>every time I fly to a place to do a podcast,</p>
<p>every time I get to talk to really cool people,</p>
<p>like every single part of my job, I super like.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>I just cut it off because I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m already making plenty of money doing what I do.</p>
<p>And why would I ever wake up and not like what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>when I can like what I&rsquo;m doing?</p>
<p>How do you guys find through that,</p>
<p>given that you love it</p>
<p>and you sometimes maybe lose yourself in the drug of it,</p>
<p>how do you find like work-life balance together</p>
<p>inside a relationship?</p>
<p>Like time for each other?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a good person to ask.</p>
<p>What do you love more, Mel or Factorio?</p>
<p>Factorio is a really good game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like not a fair comparison, okay?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about one of the best, cleanest games,</p>
<p>best support ever made, cleanest code base.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is-</p>
<p>I think I understand also another reason you said that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more Factorio time for me.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Starting to understand where the misogyny comes from.</p>
<p>By the way, is Factorio legit a really good game?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy programming?</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s all I do.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>To me, programming is the game in itself</p>
<p>that I enjoy probably more than anything else, but yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much a game like that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into stuff like that,</p>
<p>you can lose hundreds of hours very quickly to,</p>
<p>you have a problem and then you think of a solution</p>
<p>and then you iterate on that over and over and over again</p>
<p>in larger, larger schemes.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to redesign stuff.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s a very much like that kind of game.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re essentially building a factory,</p>
<p>like what, on a foreign planet or something like that?</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s like a bunch of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to automate different problems</p>
<p>so that you can build bigger things,</p>
<p>so that you can automate bigger problems,</p>
<p>so you can build bigger things</p>
<p>and automate bigger problems, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more complicated than like a city building game,</p>
<p>like some city type of thing?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s more complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Factorio is like a game of like logic,</p>
<p>like strictly like logic.</p>
<p>Oh, so you&rsquo;re almost like building a circuit or something.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s circuitry</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got your N-ORGs, ORG-AIDs,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much like that, like problems.</p>
<p>What are the enemies in the game?</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like zogs that try to bite you</p>
<p>and you can get guns and shoot and kill them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a-</p>
<p>I saw there&rsquo;s like shooting going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s like a minor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like another problem to solve</p>
<p>in the game, basically, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>So you see what we did there?</p>
<p>We just started talking about the game</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re trying, oh my God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good game, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>Anyway, is there, is that basically the struggle,</p>
<p>not a struggle, how to get human,</p>
<p>like intimate human time?</p>
<p>I feel like it was like that a little bit more in the past.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s been better lately,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s because when we started dating,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t streaming and I kind of just like gave up</p>
<p>like my trip in New Zealand.</p>
<p>I give up, like I left Sweden.</p>
<p>So I was just like in LA, which I hate.</p>
<p>I hate LA, I don&rsquo;t like LA at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to make friends that are like real,</p>
<p>that are into the same stuff as you.</p>
<p>It was just really hard for me to connect with anyone,</p>
<p>especially also like being a European</p>
<p>and like being around Americans was very strange.</p>
<p>So the only thing I had when I came here was him.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t expect-</p>
<p>Bad situation.</p>
<p>Because, yeah, because we had like two weeks of hanging out</p>
<p>and like he would be on his computer sometimes</p>
<p>and like do emails and stuff,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking that he would stream</p>
<p>like 12 hours a day.</p>
<p>And it was pretty, like it was pretty intense</p>
<p>like in the beginning of it as well.</p>
<p>And I realized it was really hard to like get attention</p>
<p>or get time because his like love meter would be like full</p>
<p>if I was just in the house.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just kind of like the way he is.</p>
<p>And for me back then,</p>
<p>when I didn&rsquo;t have anything else to do,</p>
<p>was kind of like a, it was kind of crazy for me.</p>
<p>I feel like right now, because I do work as well</p>
<p>and I have things going for me</p>
<p>and I have other friends now that I made,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s a lot easier.</p>
<p>Cause, and I can definitely like enjoy</p>
<p>just like being in separate rooms</p>
<p>and just like hear him in the background is really nice.</p>
<p>So I can sit and paint and like in my room</p>
<p>and I will do that for hours</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m just like hearing a scream in the background.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like comforting that he&rsquo;s just there.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Cause to you, that&rsquo;s the sound of happiness.</p>
<p>Yes, because I know he&rsquo;s right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll come in and check on me sometimes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of like, it&rsquo;s actually very comforting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very nice.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of what a relationship is.</p>
<p>Like you do fun things together</p>
<p>and you share moments together,</p>
<p>but also just like having someone like around you</p>
<p>is really, really nice.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably, maybe it&rsquo;s me growing up.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>And like, I started liking like the kind of,</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re like an old couple,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re like 80 and we&rsquo;re just like around.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really have to talk much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to just do that.</p>
<p>And that fills your love meter?</p>
<p>That pressure?</p>
<p>I like this terminology, love meter.</p>
<p>I need both.</p>
<p>I mean, okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making it sound like,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m like craving like crazy time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying anything.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t said a single thing at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re making face right now.</p>
<p>I know exactly what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much judging going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no judging at all.</p>
<p>No, but like we, I think,</p>
<p>I think whenever we do plan something out,</p>
<p>like if we go on a trip,</p>
<p>like every other month or once a month,</p>
<p>I feel like usually like that&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>As long as he&rsquo;s not playing Factorio the entire time.</p>
<p>Like if I feel like he&rsquo;s going on these trips for me</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not like doing things for me</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s not interested in like spending time</p>
<p>or like being present with me,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll feel like,</p>
<p>I just feel like I&rsquo;m just wasting time right now.</p>
<p>And then I get kind of disappointed.</p>
<p>But otherwise I think this, like, this is fun.</p>
<p>I think this is like spending time together.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re like doing something together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun, yeah.</p>
<p>My love meter is full.</p>
<p>Your love meter is full.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my social life.</p>
<p>We like to think about it that way,</p>
<p>that like, I need like a little bit more</p>
<p>of like this one thing, like quality time.</p>
<p>And he needs like almost zero quality time.</p>
<p>But like, let&rsquo;s say that we took away like physical touch,</p>
<p>you would probably not be very happy.</p>
<p>So you need physical touch.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just Factorio, huh?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m a very cuddly person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like cuddly and then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I guess like acts of service.</p>
<p>Like if I do something for you, you get really happy.</p>
<p>Like hot chocolate.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like if I give him hot chocolate in the morning,</p>
<p>he gets really happy.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The actual, it&rsquo;s not the hot chocolate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the giving of the hot chocolate.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just the hot chocolate.</p>
<p>But if she gives it to me,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to get it myself.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just physical touch that you like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>All right, well, if you had to choose</p>
<p>between Factorio and the drama or political discourse.</p>
<p>Which one would you choose?</p>
<p>Probably political discourse, probably my calling,</p>
<p>but I am a good Factorio player.</p>
<p>What role exactly does Factorio play</p>
<p>in your streaming life?</p>
<p>Oh, well, right now it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>usually there are like these games</p>
<p>that I play in the background as I have conversations,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard for me to just sit on the computer</p>
<p>and just talk and not like be playing a game</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just something to keep me kind of like occupied.</p>
<p>You know, I was gonna go buy</p>
<p>like little like widget things, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what yours is.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Minecraft or Factorio for me.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, my love meter is full from this.</p>
<p>Mel, thank you so much for joining us.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>This was really fun.</p>
<p>You guys are fascinating human beings.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what kind of beautiful</p>
<p>thing you create next.</p>

<p>through the different people you interact with.</p>
<p>Destiny, Steven, you&rsquo;re an amazing human.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
