How are you?
I&amp;rsquo;m good.
How are you?
Great.
I was wondering what you&amp;rsquo;ve had it with this week.

    <p>So, Pops.</p>
<p>Yes, Jenny.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I was wondering what you&rsquo;ve had it with this week.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with this week is people bragging.</p>
<p>And let me give you an example.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>So, I have a friend that moved into a new house.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And she built, decorated furniture, wallpaper, all that.</p>
<p>I mean, she was not going to hire a designer because her taste is so good.</p>
<p>So, I was wondering what you&rsquo;ve had it with this week.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with this week is people bragging.</p>
<p>And let me give you an example.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>So, I have a friend that moved into a new house.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And she was not going to hire a designer because her taste is so good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, I go in.</p>
<p>Not only is everything absolutely atrocious, she gives a play-by-play of how much each</p>
<p>individual piece cost her room to room.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s flexing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking the whole time she&rsquo;s doing that, it is so sad to me you spent this much money</p>
<p>for your house to look so bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s horrible stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to tell how much your furniture costs.</p>
<p>I would agree with that.</p>
<p>The only thing I think like if you got a really cheap piece that everybody loved, I would</p>
<p>love, you know, like I only paid $150 for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of thing you want to know about, like a fabulous piece for cheap.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Not ugly shit for expensive.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s just I was so turned off.</p>
<p>So, she had bad taste?</p>
<p>Bad taste and wanted everybody to know how much she spent.</p>
<p>Did she spend a lot?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, not Jennifer Welch design, but a lot.</p>
<p>And it was terrible.</p>
<p>It was horrible.</p>
<p>See, this is what happens to me all the time.</p>
<p>I go to somebody&rsquo;s home that I didn&rsquo;t design.</p>
<p>I get sucked in to people&rsquo;s homes and then they take me on a tour and every decision</p>
<p>they made, why they made those decisions and it&rsquo;s painstaking for me because what I want</p>
<p>to say is I do this 40 hours a week.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working right now and I am not interested in the minutiae and the process that you went</p>
<p>through to design and or remodel your house at all.</p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t watch design shows because I do that all day long.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in it.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Lay it on me.</p>
<p>Madonna.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s painful for me to say it because I&rsquo;ve grown up with her.</p>
<p>Love Madonna.</p>
<p>Loved her.</p>
<p>This fierce female icon, rock and bod, great dancer, great songs.</p>
<p>Every decade of my life there&rsquo;s a Madonna song in it.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Particularly like high school and college.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then I see her at the Grammys.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>It is so bad.</p>
<p>It is so bad.</p>
<p>I would have withdrawn.</p>
<p>If her plastic surgery looked like that, I would say I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick.</p>
<p>I would not go out in public with that.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a fresh facelift?</p>
<p>Obviously she thinks it looks good if you&rsquo;re going on the Grammys.</p>
<p>Or do you think she just felt like she couldn&rsquo;t get out of it?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s Madonna.</p>
<p>She could get out of it.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>She clearly thinks it looks good and it&rsquo;s some form of an addiction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some form of just a little bit more filler here, just a little bit more there.</p>
<p>To answer your question, I think she&rsquo;s had a facelift.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s had fillers.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s had everything she could possibly have and now she looks like a cat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so bad.</p>
<p>But you know what&rsquo;s so true with plastic surgery in terms of facelifts is that if you get enough</p>
<p>of them, you look exactly like all the other people that have had a lot of facelifts, man</p>
<p>or woman.</p>
<p>She looks the same with the facelift, with the super big cheeks and the eyes.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s filler too.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people, all the filler injectors, they all end up kind of looking like the same</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>And listen, listener.</p>
<p>We love a good Botox.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>And I love a filler.</p>
<p>I mean, so we&rsquo;re just saying there is a fine line between totally juicing up like Madonna</p>
<p>and doing a little maintenance here and there.</p>
<p>Because what Madonna has done is so bad.</p>
<p>I think that there is a breed of people amongst all of us where all of these women end up</p>
<p>looking like the same person and it is so bad.</p>
<p>And men.</p>
<p>And men.</p>
<p>I mean, the men with the facelifts.</p>
<p>I see it far more with women.</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t matter what sex you are.</p>
<p>If you have two or three, you look just like everybody else with one.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you who has the best cosmetic surgery I&rsquo;ve ever laid eyes on in my entire</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Kris Jenner.</p>
<p>She looks better today than she did when they started that deal 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you know, I was in Italy a couple of summers ago and we&rsquo;re at this restaurant in Capri</p>
<p>called Aurora.</p>
<p>And we look over and Kris Jenner with her boyfriend is sitting literally at the booth</p>
<p>right next to us.</p>
<p>And she looks really, really good in person.</p>
<p>I mean, she looks just as good in person as she does in the photos.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like, okay, she&rsquo;s photoshopping everything.</p>
<p>She looked really fantastic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it makes you wonder, like, maybe we should go to her person, her facelift person.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not feasible.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>But after you see her, she&rsquo;s thinking about everybody else would be bad.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>And today, first of all, we call her pumps.</p>
<p>But today I would like to give a special shout out to some international listeners in the</p>
<p>Netherlands.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And we have 108 listeners in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m glad that they add to our other 108 listeners, totaling us at 216.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But, you know, first of all, welcome, Netherlands.</p>
<p>Welcome Netherlands.</p>
<p>A.K.A.</p>
<p>Holland.</p>
<p>Do they speak English or Dutch?</p>
<p>Well, they speak Dutch and I think it&rsquo;s called Flemish.</p>
<p>Well, how do they understand us?</p>
<p>They speak like seven and eight languages.</p>
<p>Because their country is so small, it&rsquo;s not subtitled, so they speak English as fluently</p>
<p>as we do.</p>
<p>Plus French, plus German, plus Spanish.</p>
<p>I mean, they speak so many languages.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re big losers compared to the people in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>I absolutely love people that can speak more than one language.</p>
<p>I find it so attractive.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that means you really don&rsquo;t like that many Americans.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about right.</p>
<p>So today, Pumps, we are going to talk about something, this is going to be an interesting</p>
<p>episode.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s about party etiquette and RSVPing and how to be a good guest, how to be a good</p>
<p>host.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re very good.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m terrible at all of the above.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think that our guest is going to pitch to us that she&rsquo;s had it with a lot of things</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to resemble a lot of those things.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to hate us.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re going to be a part of the problem, a part of what she has had it</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to blackball us from any invitations.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>I mean, I have this problem where I get an invitation and I&rsquo;m like, oh, that&rsquo;s sweet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go to that.</p>
<p>Sounds so good when you see it three weeks away.</p>
<p>So RSVP.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And then each day that passes as the event draws closer, I get mad and resentful, mad</p>
<p>and resentful, mad and resentful until finally, like when I think of the person that&rsquo;s hosting</p>
<p>the event, I think I fucking hate this person.</p>
<p>And it could be you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I would be like, I hate this person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s selfish to throw parties.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wedding, a baby shower, a dinner party.</p>
<p>I get so&hellip;</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t want to get out of my schedule.</p>
<p>I have a toddler-like schedule with my life and I don&rsquo;t want to get out of it at all.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to get dolled up.</p>
<p>Like after I&rsquo;ve been at work all day, the last thing I want to do is like go home and</p>
<p>doll it up to the nines, cocktail dress, skim, Spanx, hair done, all that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, I would rather be in my pajamas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind the dolling.</p>
<p>I like clothes and all of that.</p>
<p>What bothers me is I&rsquo;m not interested in anything that anybody at the party is going to say</p>
<p>to me at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s going on with their kids.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s going on with their husbands.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what&rsquo;s going on with their careers.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve gotten older, I&rsquo;ve gotten insufferably selfish and agoraphobic.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t want to hear what&rsquo;s going on in other people&rsquo;s lives and feign interest.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this question.</p>
<p>If you had a choice that you had to go to a party every single day for the rest of your</p>
<p>life, but you got to go to all the parties, like Oscar parties, Cannes Film Festival,</p>
<p>if Tom Hanks had a party, you would be there.</p>
<p>Larry David has a dinner party.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right next to Larry.</p>
<p>But you had to do it every day.</p>
<p>So you had shitty parties you had to go to, too.</p>
<p>Or never be invited to another party.</p>
<p>What would you choose?</p>
<p>Never be invited to another party.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s where I land, too.</p>
<p>I mean, like, even the draw of Larry David.</p>
<p>Why are you stealing?</p>
<p>Larry David&rsquo;s my guy.</p>
<p>I love Larry David, too.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I introduced you to Larry.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But that was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to have possession of Larry David.</p>
<p>I have a framed picture of Larry David on my desk.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s your framed picture of Larry David?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a framed picture.</p>
<p>But who spotted Larry at the French Open and told you?</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But then I was there with him.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying, you can&rsquo;t have Larry David all to yourself.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m just saying, I think the Oscars sound miserable.</p>
<p>Oh, my God, miserable.</p>
<p>I think, I mean, I just, I&rsquo;m not interested in large group activities and social interactions</p>
<p>and having to feign interest in small talk at all.</p>
<p>I think that my two number ones why I don&rsquo;t like parties, number one is having to get</p>
<p>all dolled up.</p>
<p>Number two is the small talk.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the small talk, and it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not good at small talk.</p>
<p>It requires effort.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I think we need to bring our guest in to weigh in on this.</p>
<p>And our guest today is, she&rsquo;s an actress.</p>
<p>She is a podcast host, a television personality.</p>
<p>And I think a good party thrower.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast, Heather Dubrow.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi, Heather.</p>
<p>Hi, gals.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Wonderful.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I am fine.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>It sounded a little question marky on the fine.</p>
<p>I was thinking about it.</p>
<p>I am fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>Well, Heather, we want to hear, you know, this is a podcast.</p>
<p>We say with a wink about positivity, and it is, it makes us all feel positive when</p>
<p>we get shit off our chest, Heather.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so what we want to know from Heather Dubrow is what have you had it with?</p>
<p>Oh, you ready for this?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Are we allowed to curse?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with fucking bakeries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you something.</p>
<p>I love throwing parties.</p>
<p>I consider myself actually very good at it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But the one thing in my life that has been the bane of my existence always is the cake.</p>
<p>Every cake I do is a disaster.</p>
<p>So if you watch Real Housewives and my first season on the show, I did a naming party because</p>
<p>I changed my last name to my husband&rsquo;s last name after many years.</p>
<p>And I did a party.</p>
<p>And it was the one time I ever did a trade out where someone gave me something for free.</p>
<p>I always pay for everything because I want to not like it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So they gave me the cake and it showed up and it looked, it was juvenile.</p>
<p>It was the ugliest, like a seven year old birthday party with a big, like pink bow on</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>And I went, all right.</p>
<p>The girl broke the bow off the cake in the middle of the party and it became drama.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become this iconic moment.</p>
<p>She broke the bow off the cake and ate it in the middle of the party.</p>
<p>But even ever since then, the cakes are worse and worse, just so bad.</p>
<p>So this year, I always celebrate my birthday in February because January, everyone&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>hung over and broken over it and done.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I celebrate in February.</p>
<p>I had a party on Friday night, catch steak in LA.</p>
<p>It was so fabulous.</p>
<p>And this very famous bakery who do a lot of gorgeous, I researched, I saw someone pitched</p>
<p>it to me.</p>
<p>I said, great.</p>
<p>And they go, how about this?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we do like a cool like box and we&rsquo;re going to do this and we&rsquo;re going to have a</p>
<p>champagne coupe glass and you&rsquo;re going to be in the glass of champagne.</p>
<p>And I go, okay, great.</p>
<p>And I said to the party planner, I go, do they know what I look like?</p>
<p>Did they show?</p>
<p>Oh, they Googled you.</p>
<p>They got it.</p>
<p>They got it.</p>
<p>So I get to the party and everything&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>The vendors are right.</p>
<p>This looks great.</p>
<p>That looks great.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>And I said, where&rsquo;s the cake?</p>
<p>So they take me to the back.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Like the most hideous thing you&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m telling you, someone was trying to be mean on purpose.</p>
<p>It was a personal attack.</p>
<p>It was a personal attack.</p>
<p>I go, you know what?</p>
<p>Just leave it, but bring it in backwards.</p>
<p>So I had them at the cake moment, bring the cake in backwards.</p>
<p>And I gave like a funny toast and I had them spit it around.</p>
<p>I ripped the thing off, but I&rsquo;ve had it with bakers, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my problem with cakes.</p>
<p>The really, really pretty ones taste like shit, right?</p>
<p>And if you want a really good tasting cake, it&rsquo;s literally the bakery at the grocery store</p>
<p>that has the delicious, proper tasting cake.</p>
<p>And then you go to the artsy bakers and you want this beautiful cake and the frosting</p>
<p>is awful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hardly edible at all.</p>
<p>The Europeans are far better at all the baking stuff than Americans.</p>
<p>The bakeries in Europe are far greater.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d rather have like a Duncan Hines or a Betty Crocker from the box.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>With the frosting from the tub that I&rsquo;ll eat anyway, plain.</p>
<p>But you know, a lot of people do fake cakes now.</p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For the photo.</p>
<p>For a photo, they decorate a fake, you know, there&rsquo;s nothing in there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve got, you know, slices.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I want to get into because I think this is going to be, and I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>it first.</p>
<p>So you are a good hostess and you like to throw parties, right?</p>
<p>And so I hate parties, have become more and more agoraphobic.</p>
<p>Somebody will invite me to something, I&rsquo;ll respond that I&rsquo;m coming.</p>
<p>And as the date draws in closer and closer, I start to hate that person.</p>
<p>It can be her.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I hate her.</p>
<p>This party is selfish.</p>
<p>This is so self-serving.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a grandstand to throw a party and I have to give up my Friday night with home</p>
<p>with my dogs, watching a show.</p>
<p>And I start to get really bitter about it.</p>
<p>So first of all, tell us what you think about the RSVP etiquette.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with RSVPs.</p>
<p>When I moved to California, I thought my mom, when I got married, I thought she was going</p>
<p>to lose her shit.</p>
<p>Like she was like, people don&rsquo;t RSVP here.</p>
<p>This is not like New York.</p>
<p>What is wrong with people that they don&rsquo;t RSVP?</p>
<p>It took me a long time to, first of all, stop sending real invitations.</p>
<p>I just, the whole paperless, well, when paperless post came out, that was better, but you know,</p>
<p>the invite and the whole thing, it just felt so uncouth to me.</p>
<p>I really, I couldn&rsquo;t do it, but eventually it just is so much easier.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>And nobody checks their snail mail.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And also this is what they do.</p>
<p>Oh, look at that gorgeous, very expensive invitation Heather sent me.</p>
<p>Let me put that in my phone.</p>
<p>And then they toss it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>No one saves them anymore.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a waste of money.</p>
<p>So I got rid of that.</p>
<p>But what I don&rsquo;t understand is if you don&rsquo;t want to come, just say no, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I probably don&rsquo;t really want you anyway.</p>
<p>You could be filler.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Say no.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this about the invitation.</p>
<p>So I have known, I have some girls that work for me that are younger.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re in that whole, you know, you go through a period where all you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is going to weddings or you&rsquo;re having a wedding.</p>
<p>So the girls that work for me and my design firm are in that stage.</p>
<p>And I noticed that now the kids, the millennials are using the plus one in a very manipulative</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And I kind of dig it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like, okay, pumps is great, but her boyfriend is a total asshole.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s not getting a plus one.</p>
<p>And they do this stuff on purpose.</p>
<p>Like this girl will get an invitation, no plus one because nobody likes the boyfriend.</p>
<p>And then somebody else will get a plus one because they like that couple.</p>
<p>Have you heard of this?</p>
<p>No, I love that though.</p>
<p>I always thought it was a money thing.</p>
<p>I always thought that when people, you know, could only have a certain amount of guests</p>
<p>that only invite a plus one for that age group, if they were very serious with someone.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Engaged or better.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like something like that.</p>
<p>But honestly, I, you know, I really just don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>I feel like if you&rsquo;re on a certain budget, that is fine, but then cut your guest list.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not nice to make people come without a plus one because there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>that like have anxiety and they don&rsquo;t like walking into a place by themselves.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that that plus one is always the drunk at the party.</p>
<p>And you know what I&rsquo;m talking about?</p>
<p>Like how do you deal with when you&rsquo;re hosting a party and you&rsquo;ve got that one drunk person</p>
<p>that will not leave your house and is harassing all of your guests?</p>
<p>How do you deal with that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough thing.</p>
<p>I found that for me in the last several years, I&rsquo;ve gone from throwing really big parties</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve really gotten smaller.</p>
<p>I love a dinner party because my thing about a guest list is that you should want to sit</p>
<p>next to everyone at your party.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s someone coming to your party and you&rsquo;re like, okay, well, I just don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to put them on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t be at your party.</p>
<p>But sometimes you can&rsquo;t help it because it&rsquo;s like cousin Larry.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And you have to include them.</p>
<p>I think you have to have a preemptive strike.</p>
<p>The other thing I do, because sometimes, to be honest, it&rsquo;s my mother that&rsquo;s drinking</p>
<p>too much.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an asshole.</p>
<p>So I will tell the servers like, pour a light for this one.</p>
<p>Watch that one.</p>
<p>Every other drink, water it down.</p>
<p>The whole thing.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very, very smart.</p>
<p>How long do you think, because I&rsquo;m a person that would agree to go to your dinner party,</p>
<p>okay?</p>
<p>I would RSVP.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m coming.</p>
<p>And then I would start resenting you.</p>
<p>And then I would show up begrudgingly.</p>
<p>And then how long after the dessert is served is the expectation to stay and chit chat?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real, oh, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>How early can you leave without being an asshole?</p>
<p>Because my philosophy is you can&rsquo;t leave until you get there.</p>
<p>So I want to be the first person at your party so that I can, when everybody else starts</p>
<p>coming, I can fade to black and no one will, oh, she&rsquo;s around here somewhere.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve snuck off.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of my pattern is be the first one there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good, I like that.</p>
<p>I have to say, so I had a party on Friday night for my birthday and there were 70 people</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>And at first, Terry was like, that&rsquo;s too many people.</p>
<p>And I go, no, it&rsquo;s not because this is LA.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to happen is these people are going to come, this group over here is going</p>
<p>to come very early and they&rsquo;re going to do what pump does.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to leave.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to say, oh, we&rsquo;re so-and-so, she went to the bathroom, gone.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the people that come an hour late and stay for the whole thing.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just, it like, it tends to work out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind any of that.</p>
<p>I feel like as a guest, if you like to leave early, show up early, get there, say your</p>
<p>hellos.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you have to say goodbye to everyone.</p>
<p>And honestly, I don&rsquo;t even like when people do that because then other people see them</p>
<p>saying goodbye and it makes me feel like, oh, should we go?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go over some things that can happen at dinner parties.</p>
<p>And I want to get your feedback.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to list some things off.</p>
<p>How do you feel about a person that is a self-appointed DJ?</p>
<p>They show up at your house and they decide they&rsquo;re going to be the DJ and they&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>their playlist.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Not on Heather&rsquo;s watch.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Not on my watch.</p>
<p>This is two things that I think are super three seating for sure.</p>
<p>Music curated to who is there.</p>
<p>If my mom&rsquo;s there, I have got Frank Sinatra on and, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve got these couples there, we&rsquo;re playing 80s pop.</p>
<p>These people, we&rsquo;ve got to go on.</p>
<p>I am very like, it&rsquo;s a very curated thing.</p>
<p>Huge faux pas.</p>
<p>The other thing I don&rsquo;t like is the self-appointed photographer.</p>
<p>That drives me insane.</p>
<p>And I have a couple of friends, not really anymore, but I had a couple of friends that</p>
<p>were so they&rsquo;re off the list that need to photograph like every leaf of lettuce.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of had it with people constantly taking pictures of food, right?</p>
<p>I just think I&rsquo;m so tired of being in an event and seeing this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Fall down.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What do you feel about a dinner guest that blows their nose in your cloth napkin?</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something, Terry&rsquo;s mom will do that anywhere.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s older now, so God bless, but even in her younger days.</p>
<p>And so if anyone ever does that and listen, I&rsquo;m going to be honest, I&rsquo;ve seen my husband</p>
<p>do it.</p>
<p>I look at him and I go, okay, Laura.</p>
<p>Not okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How do you feel about people that are called bedroom borrowers?</p>
<p>And these are the horny couple that you invite to your dinner party that sneak off and go</p>
<p>get a slap and tickle on in your guest bedroom or maybe even your own bedroom.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>That happens?</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I went to a dinner club once and a wife from one of the couples and a husband of one of</p>
<p>the couples goes in the bathroom and has sex with all of the dinner club people there.</p>
<p>And their spouses.</p>
<p>And their spouses on top of everything else.</p>
<p>Obviously that dinner group broke up, but.</p>
<p>Wait, there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack in this story.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>This whole, what is a dinner club?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where you have like, say 10 couples and one month it&rsquo;s at my home and I do everything</p>
<p>and then the next month it&rsquo;s somebody else and it just rotates once a month.</p>
<p>You have dinner with these people.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s cute.</p>
<p>And this, these two people were like cheating on their people?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They were married to other people and then had sex in the bathroom of the hostesses at</p>
<p>the dinner club.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Was it a powder room or like a full bath?</p>
<p>I think it was the powder bath if I&rsquo;m, I mean, it&rsquo;s been about 20 years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>That is a great question.</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t question.</p>
<p>I was just thinking spatially.</p>
<p>You have to know.</p>
<p>Is it, you know, is it a, you know, a quickie, you know, how, how intense was it?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m kind of shocked that you&rsquo;re shocked that it seems like you&rsquo;re today years old</p>
<p>that you found out that people could possibly have in the past, snuck off at your house</p>
<p>and had sex in a guest bedroom.</p>
<p>Cause you know what happened Heather?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>I always have security at my parties.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>Are they monitoring the bedrooms?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No one, no one goes up or down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>Could have happened in the powder room.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Next up is how do you feel like I hosted recently a fundraiser for a person that was running</p>
<p>for district attorney and it was at my house and it was like from five 30 to seven and</p>
<p>I have two dogs that I adore.</p>
<p>And so my dogs attended the fundraiser because it&rsquo;s their house.</p>
<p>So we were researching what to talk about with you and some Forbes actually, Forbes</p>
<p>magazine said overly attached pet owners are a no, no.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that would be me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it was horrible Heather.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not kidding you.</p>
<p>They barked at everybody.</p>
<p>They ran around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, put these fuckers outside.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not going to kill them.</p>
<p>But no, they, she was like, well no, they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like the, the guest of honor, one of them was barking and trying to bite her</p>
<p>pants the whole time.</p>
<p>That is a complete exaggeration.</p>
<p>That is completely exaggerated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with pumps on this one.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like we were at someone&rsquo;s house for dinner recently and they&rsquo;re so lovely</p>
<p>and it was just the four of us having dinner, but the dogs were there and they were fine.</p>
<p>They were super sweet.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been at other people&rsquo;s homes where the dogs are like so aggressive and they want</p>
<p>to, even when they&rsquo;re sweet, they like just want like, it&rsquo;s like I got a nice outfit on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really want your dog slobber on my pants or on my thing and it&rsquo;s like not the</p>
<p>moment.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re barking at people, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say that logically I agree with both of you.</p>
<p>You make perfect sense and I agree with it.</p>
<p>But in practicum, in my everyday life, my fucking dogs will attend every party that</p>
<p>I host.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an, that brings up a point that I just occurred to me.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say Heather invited you to a dinner party.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t take my dogs, but would you have, I mean, people probably have tried saying</p>
<p>that the service dogs, that&rsquo;s a no, no, no, don&rsquo;t bring your kids or your dog.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t take my dog to Heather&rsquo;s house, nor can you bring a kid.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, I would much rather somebody bring a dog than a kid to my house.</p>
<p>Have you ever had anyone bring a plus one when you didn&rsquo;t invite them with one?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;ve gotten older, I&rsquo;ve avoided throwing parties altogether because I want to have</p>
<p>fewer people and fewer instances of unwanted social interactions in my life.</p>
<p>I want to make my life as a fundraiser with all those strangers.</p>
<p>It was for a good cause.</p>
<p>I mean, we live in Oklahoma and there&rsquo;s some cuckoo for Cocoa Puff politicians here.</p>
<p>And I had to, I had to get this help this woman, I had to, and she won and she&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So my, my heartstrings about, you know, women&rsquo;s issues kind of overrode there.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>This is a big one.</p>
<p>And I have witnessed this back in my younger days when I was really on the party circuit</p>
<p>on the dinner club circuit, the whole nine couples, married couples that engage in PDA</p>
<p>at a party.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Listen, my husband has this friend and he and the wife and we, we stopped hanging out</p>
<p>with them because they would like make out at the table in a restaurant where she would</p>
<p>put on and she would tell us stories like, um, like, Oh, I put on my lingerie and my</p>
<p>daughters were like, her daughter, why are you wearing lingerie in front of your like</p>
<p>eight year old daughter?</p>
<p>So creepy.</p>
<p>So weird.</p>
<p>The PDA in a restaurant is just atrocious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like any PDA ever.</p>
<p>Maybe a handhold or something like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But to put your tongue in somebody else&rsquo;s mouth in a restaurant is repulsive.</p>
<p>So there is this couple when I would go out probably in my twenties and thirties and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>married couple, darling love them.</p>
<p>But every single party I was at, no matter what party it was, they would find like an</p>
<p>Ottoman that is kind of like a cocktail Ottoman used as a coffee table.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d look over an hour into the party and they&rsquo;re laid out on the Ottoman full blown</p>
<p>mugging his hand in between her legs and it is just like full blown soft core porn.</p>
<p>And you can ask anybody who&rsquo;s been to a party with them, you know, the PDA couple, everybody</p>
<p>immediately knows who they are.</p>
<p>And I, okay, here&rsquo;s what I want to unpack psychologically.</p>
<p>Do we think they do it at home?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>I think we get off on people watching them have sex.</p>
<p>The voyeurism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s got to be it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like couples that act like they&rsquo;re so in love on social media and they communicate</p>
<p>with each other on social media.</p>
<p>A hundred percent, you know, they&rsquo;re fucked up and on their way to a divorce.</p>
<p>Immediate red flag.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s compensating for some shortcoming in the marriage because it is not a normal,</p>
<p>that is something that&rsquo;s reserved in private.</p>
<p>I mean, if my husband started French kissing me in public, I would literally be like, what</p>
<p>the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Same thing.</p>
<p>I have this thing about sitting on the same side of the booth.</p>
<p>If we went to a restaurant and we&rsquo;re at a four top and he came over and sat down next</p>
<p>to me, I&rsquo;d go get the fuck over there.</p>
<p>Like I am not going to be this nutty couple.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with it.</p>
<p>And when you start going out and you know, Valentine, it&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day season.</p>
<p>This is, this is peak season for all of these offenders that have to sit on the same side</p>
<p>of the booth.</p>
<p>And I mean, I have had it.</p>
<p>I literally want to walk up to them and get, say, I really don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re in love.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re compensating for something.</p>
<p>I know the minute you get in the car, she&rsquo;s browbeating you or you&rsquo;re browbeating her.</p>
<p>I know it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve cracked the case.</p>
<p>If you sit on the same side of the booth, you either crack your neck, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Or maybe they just don&rsquo;t like each other and they both want to face forward and look at</p>
<p>everyone else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it at all.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I want to move on to in our theme of hosting parties.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to start with Pumps.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Pumps, tell us if we were to have a fantasy dinner party and you could invite three guests,</p>
<p>living or dead, who would you invite?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I would have Dolly Parton as my number one.</p>
<p>Love her.</p>
<p>Love Dolly Parton.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s on my list.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Oh, well, she&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s list.</p>
<p>She could be.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, his charisma is like, you can feel it when he&rsquo;s in the same building as you.</p>
<p>So I would want to do him.</p>
<p>And then I think this is probably something everybody in my age category is going to say,</p>
<p>but Princess Diana.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So MJ with Dolly Parton.</p>
<p>Princess Diana.</p>
<p>Princess Diana.</p>
<p>With Dolly Parton.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go on to you, Heather.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Dolly is on my list too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>You know, it depends.</p>
<p>If you had asked me a month ago, a month from now, it might be different.</p>
<p>I mean, the dinner I want to have is Dolly.</p>
<p>I want Oprah and I want Katie Couric.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve liked Katie.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like the Today Show, but I like her podcast.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s pumped the break.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t like the Today Show?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been Good Morning America.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard anybody say they didn&rsquo;t like the Today Show.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I just like her.</p>
<p>I like her too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s really cute.</p>
<p>Remember when her husband died and she wore his ring around her neck?</p>
<p>And I mean-</p>
<p>I mean, all of them.</p>
<p>And she got the young guy and then they got married.</p>
<p>Like, I just like her.</p>
<p>I feel like she&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I like when she speaks and I just, I, but I felt like that group, we&rsquo;d have a lot of</p>
<p>laughs.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>So mine is Larry David, who I, I mean, love.</p>
<p>I have a framed picture of Larry David on my desk.</p>
<p>Curb Your Enthusiasm is my favorite show.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like short men and I&rsquo;m afraid that he&rsquo;s probably short, but I will take</p>
<p>one for the team because I love him so much.</p>
<p>Second would be Rafael Nadal.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>That would be a good one.</p>
<p>I love Rafa.</p>
<p>I love him so much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>When he, when he hits those forehands and then he pumps his fist and says, vamos.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel it in every particle of my body.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not having a dinner party.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s having that, that couple that&rsquo;s having sex.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s having sex with Rafa in the powder bath.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to become everything that everybody&rsquo;s had it with.</p>
<p>But third, RBG, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>Oftentimes when I&rsquo;m doing stupid vapid shit, like my interior design pod, my interior design</p>
<p>projects or this podcast, I think, you know, I wonder if I could have been like George</p>
<p>Clooney&rsquo;s wife or RBG.</p>
<p>And then I think, nah, I don&rsquo;t have enough depth, but I do think I would like to have</p>
<p>a dinner date in an hour.</p>
<p>So I recently played in a tournament with my husband and we made it to the semifinals.</p>
<p>And he really is a much better pickleball player than I, but I think we lost, I think</p>
<p>because of him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he, I think he was the weak link.</p>
<p>After we lost the tournament, he announced he has a very like, you know, accelerator</p>
<p>press down or foot completely on the break type personality.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m quitting pickleball for good.</p>
<p>So seven days later, he&rsquo;s entered into another tournament and then he just played and he</p>
<p>got second place.</p>
<p>And so I noticed he has all these trophies from his tennis and pickleball adult career.</p>
<p>So I laid them all out last night and there is a common theme among all of them.</p>
<p>I could not believe second place, second place, second place, to which I said to him, honey,</p>
<p>almost.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When you posted that picture, I thought you&rsquo;re such a bitch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a total bitch, insufferable bitch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Heather Dubrow, thank you so much for telling us what you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you feel better getting all that off your chest?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I only felt fine at the beginning and now I feel great.</p>
<p>Feel like a million bucks.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I adore the two of you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both so funny, so talented.</p>
<p>I love your show and thank you so much for having me on.</p>
<p>Thank you so much Heather.</p>
<p>Bye guys.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I love her.</p>
<p>She is so fun.</p>
<p>I mean, I could sit and talk to her forever.</p>
<p>For hours.</p>
<p>And I think Heather is like, if she were to invite us to a dinner party.</p>
<p>I kind of think we&rsquo;d want to go.</p>
<p>I would 100% want to go, but I think like we would probably not get invited a second</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>Even on our best behavior.</p>
<p>We would probably.</p>
<p>Both of us love to Irish exit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really good at it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>This is what I want to go over with you.</p>
<p>I have found some tips that can help you Irish exit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And these are very important.</p>
<p>I want to go over them with you and the listener.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Before you go in, you got to know your exits.</p>
<p>Side doors, back doors, any way that you can sneak out without being noticed.</p>
<p>So immediately upon arrival, you&rsquo;ve got to scout out your exit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Number two, you can&rsquo;t be the one that plays the music and hook your phone up.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Because when you leave.</p>
<p>Then they notice because you take the phone off.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You have to keep your coat and accessories close.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even bring them out of the car.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s 50 below zero.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take a coat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take my purse.</p>
<p>That is smart.</p>
<p>Because then you just have to wait on other people to get it back for you or it becomes</p>
<p>obvious because you&rsquo;re carrying your coat towards the door.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a beeline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beeline.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a getaway car waiting.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s an Uber, you need to have it ready.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to have that Uber ready and waiting so that when you leave, if somebody sees you</p>
<p>in the driveway, you can say, I am so sorry.</p>
<p>My ride is here.</p>
<p>I have to go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no pulling you back in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably great advice.</p>
<p>And the last one is something I really need to discuss with you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And it is keeping track of your company.</p>
<p>This is the single biggest obstacle to any Irish goodbye is a friendship.</p>
<p>And I have experienced both you and Josh Welch claim to be the biggest Irish exiters on the</p>
<p>planet.</p>
<p>And I have been in situations with each of you where I am ready.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re yakking.</p>
<p>And I look over and there you are yak mouthing with other yak mouths preventing me from an</p>
<p>Irish exit, feigning interest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m standing there making an angry face and I feel exposed.</p>
<p>I feel like we were partners in this crime.</p>
<p>And you leave me in the lurch and you&rsquo;ve done it to me multiple times.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>You start yak mouthing.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I start yakking.</p>
<p>You start yakking.</p>
<p>And then I feel like I can&rsquo;t gracefully get out of it.</p>
<p>You have multiple times.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I have a lot more time at parties than I planned to because of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>That is fair.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I just I want to know that moving forward that we can work on this together.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes, we can.</p>
<p>Do you really apologize?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would hate that if you were doing it to me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll think about forgiving you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, just that big black heart will just have to melt a little bit for me.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for tuning in to our podcast where we get stuff off of our chest.</p>
<p>We get stuff off of our chest with our friend Heather Dubrow who is awesome.</p>
<p>And I want to ask everybody please DM us a voice memo on I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast on Instagram.</p>
<p>And please, people, I&rsquo;m going to ask you to do something really big here.</p>
<p>Pumps is a total thirst trapper.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking dehydration beyond all recognition.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s always on those Apple charts looking at reviews that people write.</p>
<p>And you people are just not writing them quick enough.</p>
<p>It hurts her.</p>
<p>She needs this motivation.</p>
<p>So go give her a five star review and in the reviews on Apple podcast, tell us how much</p>
<p>you love pumps to satisfy the thirst trapping dehydration of pumps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely always thirsty.</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only true part of that.</p>
<p>We will see you when, Pumps?</p>
<p>Next Tuesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>Why do you talk so high?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my sorority girl voice.</p>
<p>Sorority girl voice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>All I can say about that is, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
