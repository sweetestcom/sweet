    <p>The following is a conversation with Pamela McCordick. She&rsquo;s an author who has written on</p>
<p>the history and the philosophical significance of artificial intelligence. Her books include</p>
<p>Machines Who Think in 1979, The Fifth Generation in 1983 with Ed Feigenbaum, who&rsquo;s considered to</p>
<p>be the father of expert systems, The Edge of Chaos that features women, and many more books.</p>
<p>I came across her work in an unusual way by stumbling in a quote from Machines Who Think</p>
<p>that is something like, artificial intelligence began with the ancient wish to forge the gods.</p>
<p>That was a beautiful way to draw a connecting line between our societal relationship with AI</p>
<p>from the grounded day to day science, math and engineering, to popular stories and science</p>
<p>fiction and myths of automatons that go back for centuries. Through her literary work,</p>
<p>she has spent a lot of time with the seminal figures of artificial intelligence, including</p>
<p>the founding fathers of AI from the 1956 Dartmouth summer workshop where the field was launched.</p>
<p>I reached out to Pamela for a conversation in hopes of getting a sense of what those early</p>
<p>days were like, and how their dreams continue to reverberate through the work of our community</p>
<p>today. I often don&rsquo;t know where the conversation may take us, but I jump in and see. Having no</p>
<p>constraints, rules, or goals is a wonderful way to discover new ideas. This is the Artificial</p>
<p>Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on iTunes,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter, at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M</p>
<p>A N. And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Pamela McCordick. In 1979, your book Machines Who Think</p>
<p>was published. In it, you interview some of the early AI pioneers and explore the idea that</p>
<p>AI was born not out of maybe math and computer science, but out of myth and legend. So, tell me</p>
<p>if you could the story of how you first arrived at the book, the journey of beginning to write it.</p>
<p>I had been a novelist. I&rsquo;d published two novels, and I was sitting under the portal at Stanford</p>
<p>one day, the house we were renting for the summer. And I thought, I should write a novel about these</p>
<p>weird people in AI, I know. And then I thought, ah, don&rsquo;t write a novel, write a history. Simple.</p>
<p>Just go around, interview them, splice it together, voila, instant book. Ha, ha, ha. It was</p>
<p>much harder than that. But nobody else was doing it. And so, I thought, well, this is a great</p>
<p>opportunity. And there were people who, John McCarthy, for example, thought it was a nutty</p>
<p>idea. The field had not evolved yet, so on. And he had some mathematical thing he thought I should</p>
<p>write instead. And I said, no, John, I am not a woman in search of a project. This is what I want</p>
<p>to do. I hope you&rsquo;ll cooperate. And he said, oh, mutter, mutter, well, okay, it&rsquo;s your time.</p>
<p>What was the pitch for the, I mean, such a young field at that point. How do you write</p>
<p>a personal history of a field that&rsquo;s so young? I said, this is wonderful. The founders of the</p>
<p>field are alive and kicking and able to talk about what they&rsquo;re doing. Did they sound or feel like</p>
<p>founders at the time? Did they know that they have founded something?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. They knew what they were doing was very important. Very. What I now see in retrospect</p>
<p>is that they were at the height of their research careers. And it&rsquo;s humbling to me that they took</p>
<p>time out from all the things that they had to do as a consequence of being there. And to talk to</p>
<p>this woman who said, I think I&rsquo;m going to write a book about you. No, it was amazing. Just amazing.</p>
<p>So who stands out to you? Maybe looking 63 years ago, the Dartmouth conference,</p>
<p>so Marvin Minsky was there, McCarthy was there, Claude Shannon, Alan Newell, Herb Simon,</p>
<p>some of the folks you&rsquo;ve mentioned. Then there&rsquo;s other characters, right? One of your coauthors</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t at Dartmouth.</p>
<p>No. He was, I think, an undergraduate then.</p>
<p>And of course, Joe Traub. All of these are players, not at Dartmouth, but in that era.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>CMU and so on. So who are the characters, if you could paint a picture, that stand out to you</p>
<p>from memory? Those people you&rsquo;ve interviewed and maybe not, people that were just in the</p>
<p>In the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Of course, the four founding fathers were extraordinary guys. They really were.</p>
<p>Who are the founding fathers?</p>
<p>Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy. They were the four who were not only</p>
<p>at the Dartmouth conference, but Newell and Simon arrived there with a working program</p>
<p>called The Logic Theorist. Everybody else had great ideas about how they might do it, but</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t going to do it yet.</p>
<p>And you mentioned Joe Traub, my husband. I was immersed in AI before I met Joe</p>
<p>because I had been Ed Feigenbaum&rsquo;s assistant at Stanford. And before that,</p>
<p>I had worked on a book edited by Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman called Computers and Thought.</p>
<p>It was the first textbook of readings of AI. And they only did it because they were trying to teach</p>
<p>AI to people at Berkeley. And there was nothing, you&rsquo;d have to send them to this journal and that</p>
<p>journal. This was not the internet where you could go look at an article. So I was fascinated from</p>
<p>the get go by AI. I was an English major. What did I know? And yet I was fascinated. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why you saw that historical, that literary background, which I think is very much a part</p>
<p>of the continuum of AI, that AI grew out of that same impulse. That traditional, what was,</p>
<p>what drew you to AI? How did you even think of it back then? What was the possibilities,</p>
<p>the dreams? What was interesting to you? The idea of intelligence outside the human cranium,</p>
<p>this was a phenomenal idea. And even when I finished Machines Who Think,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know if they were going to succeed. In fact, the final chapter is very wishy washy,</p>
<p>frankly. Succeed, the field did. Yeah. So was there the idea that AI began with the wish to</p>
<p>forge the gods? So the spiritual component that we crave to create this other thing greater than</p>
<p>ourselves. For those guys, I don&rsquo;t think so. Newell and Simon were cognitive psychologists.</p>
<p>What they wanted was to simulate aspects of human intelligence,</p>
<p>and they found they could do it on the computer. Minsky just thought it was a really cool thing</p>
<p>to do. Likewise, McCarthy. McCarthy had got the idea in 1949 when he was a Caltech student.</p>
<p>And he listened to somebody&rsquo;s lecture. It&rsquo;s in my book. I forget who it was. And he thought,</p>
<p>oh, that would be fun to do. How do we do that? And he took a very mathematical approach.</p>
<p>Minsky was hybrid, and Newell and Simon were very much cognitive psychology. How can we simulate</p>
<p>various things about human cognition? What happened over the many years is, of course,</p>
<p>our definition of intelligence expanded tremendously. These days, biologists are</p>
<p>comfortable talking about the intelligence of the cell, the intelligence of the brain,</p>
<p>not just human brain, but the intelligence of any kind of brain. Cephalopods, I mean, an octopus is</p>
<p>really intelligent by any amount. We wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of that in the 60s, even the 70s.</p>
<p>So all these things have worked in. And I did hear one behavioral primatologist, Franz De Waal,</p>
<p>say, AI taught us the questions to ask. Yeah, this is what happens, right? When you try to build it,</p>
<p>is when you start to actually ask questions. It puts a mirror to ourselves. Yeah, right. So you</p>
<p>were there in the middle of it. It seems like not many people were asking the questions that</p>
<p>you were, or just trying to look at this field the way you were. I was so low. When I went to</p>
<p>get funding for this because I needed somebody to transcribe the interviews and I needed travel</p>
<p>expenses, I went to everything you could think of, the NSF, the DARPA. There was an Air Force</p>
<p>place that doled out money. And each of them said, well, that&rsquo;s a very interesting idea.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll think about it. And the National Science Foundation actually said to me in plain English,</p>
<p>hey, you&rsquo;re only a writer. You&rsquo;re not a historian of science. And I said, yeah, that&rsquo;s true. But</p>
<p>the historians of science will be crawling all over this field. I&rsquo;m writing for the general</p>
<p>audience, so I thought. And they still wouldn&rsquo;t budge. I finally got a private grant without</p>
<p>knowing who it was from, from Ed Fredkin at MIT. He was a wealthy man, and he liked what he called</p>
<p>crackpot ideas. And he considered this a crackpot idea, and he was willing to support it. I am ever</p>
<p>grateful, let me say that. Some would say that a history of science approach to AI, or even just a</p>
<p>history, or anything like the book that you&rsquo;ve written, hasn&rsquo;t been written since. Maybe I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not familiar, but it&rsquo;s certainly not many. If we think about bigger than just these couple of</p>
<p>decades, few decades, what are the roots of AI? Oh, they go back so far. Yes, of course, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all the legendary stuff, the Golem and the early robots of the 20th century. But they go back much</p>
<p>further than that. If you read Homer, Homer has robots in the Iliad. And a classical scholar was</p>
<p>pointing out to me just a few months ago, well, you said you just read the Odyssey. The Odyssey</p>
<p>is full of robots. It is, I said? Yeah. How do you think Odysseus&rsquo;s ship gets from one place to</p>
<p>another? He doesn&rsquo;t have the crew people to do that, the crewmen. Yeah, it&rsquo;s magic. It&rsquo;s robots.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought, how interesting. So we&rsquo;ve had this notion of AI for a long time. And then toward the</p>
<p>end of the 19th century, the beginning of the 20th century, there were scientists who actually</p>
<p>tried to make this happen some way or another, not successfully. They didn&rsquo;t have the technology for</p>
<p>it. And of course, Babbage in the 1850s and 60s, he saw that what he was building was capable of</p>
<p>intelligent behavior. And when he ran out of funding, the British government finally said,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enough. He and Lady Lovelace decided, oh, well, why don&rsquo;t we play the ponies with this? He</p>
<p>had other ideas for raising money too. But if we actually reach back once again, I think people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually really know that robots do appear and ideas of robots. You talk about the Hellenic</p>
<p>and the Hebraic points of view. Oh, yes. Can you tell me about each? I defined it this way. The</p>
<p>Hellenic point of view is robots are great. They are party help. They help this guy Hephaestus,</p>
<p>this god Hephaestus in his forge. I presume he made them to help him and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And they welcome the whole idea of robots. The Hebraic view has to do with, I think it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>second commandment, thou shalt not make any graven image. In other words, you better not</p>
<p>start imitating humans because that&rsquo;s just forbidden. It&rsquo;s the second commandment. And</p>
<p>a lot of the reaction to artificial intelligence has been a sense that this is somehow wicked,</p>
<p>this is somehow blasphemous. We shouldn&rsquo;t be going there. Now, you can say, yeah, but there are going</p>
<p>to be some downsides. And I say, yes, there are, but blasphemy is not one of them.</p>
<p>You know, there is a kind of fear that feels to be almost primal. Is there religious roots to that?</p>
<p>Because so much of our society has religious roots. And so there is a feeling of, like you</p>
<p>said, blasphemy of creating the other, of creating something, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>artificial intelligence. It&rsquo;s creating life in general. It&rsquo;s the Frankenstein idea.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the annotated Frankenstein on my coffee table. It&rsquo;s a tremendous novel. It really is just</p>
<p>beautifully perceptive. Yes, we do fear this and we have good reason to fear it,</p>
<p>but because it can get out of hand. Maybe you can speak to that fear,</p>
<p>the psychology, if you&rsquo;ve thought about it. You know, there&rsquo;s a practical set of fears,</p>
<p>concerns in the short term. You can think if we actually think about artificial intelligence</p>
<p>systems, you can think about bias of discrimination in algorithms. You can think about their social</p>
<p>networks have algorithms that recommend the content you see, thereby these algorithms control</p>
<p>the behavior of the masses. There&rsquo;s these concerns. But to me, it feels like the fear</p>
<p>that people have is deeper than that. So have you thought about the psychology of it?</p>
<p>I think in a superficial way I have. There is this notion that if we produce a machine that</p>
<p>can think, it will outthink us and therefore replace us.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s a primal fear of almost kind of a kind of mortality. So around the time you said</p>
<p>you worked at Stanford with Ed Feigenbaum. So let&rsquo;s look at that one person. Throughout his</p>
<p>history, clearly a key person, one of the many in the history of AI. How has he changed in general</p>
<p>around him? How has Stanford changed in the last, how many years are we talking about here?</p>
<p>Oh, since 65.</p>
<ol start="65">
<li>So maybe it doesn&rsquo;t have to be about him. It could be bigger. But because he was a key</li>
</ol>
<p>person in expert systems, for example, how is that, how are these folks who you&rsquo;ve interviewed in the</p>
<p>70s, 79 changed through the decades?</p>
<p>In Ed&rsquo;s case, I know him well. We are dear friends. We see each other every month or so. He told me</p>
<p>that when Machines Who Think first came out, he really thought all the front matter was kind of</p>
<p>bologna. And 10 years later, he said, no, I see what you&rsquo;re getting at. Yes, this is an impulse</p>
<p>that has been a human impulse for thousands of years to create something outside the human</p>
<p>cranium that has intelligence. I think it&rsquo;s very hard when you&rsquo;re down at the algorithmic level,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just trying to make something work, which is hard enough to step back and think of</p>
<p>the big picture. It reminds me of when I was in Santa Fe, I knew a lot of archaeologists,</p>
<p>which was a hobby of mine. And I would say, yeah, yeah, well, you can look at the shards and say,</p>
<p>oh, this came from this tribe and this came from this trade route and so on. But what about the big</p>
<p>picture? And a very distinguished archaeologist said to me, they don&rsquo;t think that way. No,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to match the shard to where it came from. Where did the remainder of this corn</p>
<p>come from? Was it grown here? Was it grown elsewhere? And I think this is part of any</p>
<p>scientific field. You&rsquo;re so busy doing the hard work, and it is hard work, that you don&rsquo;t step</p>
<p>back and say, oh, well, now let&rsquo;s talk about the general meaning of all this. Yes.</p>
<p>So none of the even Minsky and McCarthy, they&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, those guys did. Yeah. The founding fathers did.</p>
<p>Early on or later?</p>
<p>Pretty early on. But in a different way from how I looked at it. The two cognitive psychologists,</p>
<p>Newell and Simon, they wanted to imagine reforming cognitive psychology so that we would really,</p>
<p>really understand the brain. Minsky was more speculative. And John McCarthy saw it as,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m doing him right by this, he really saw it as a great boon for human beings to have</p>
<p>this technology. And that was reason enough to do it. And he had wonderful, wonderful</p>
<p>fables about how if you do the mathematics, you will see that these things are really good for</p>
<p>human beings. And if you had a technological objection, he had an answer, a technological</p>
<p>answer. But here&rsquo;s how we could get over that and then blah, blah, blah. And one of his favorite things</p>
<p>was what he called the literary problem, which of course he presented to me several times.</p>
<p>That is everything in literature, there are conventions in literature. One of the conventions</p>
<p>is that you have a villain and a hero. And the hero in most literature is human,</p>
<p>and the villain in most literature is a machine. And he said, that&rsquo;s just not the way it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be. But that&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re used to it. So when we tell stories about AI, it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>with this paradigm. I thought, yeah, he&rsquo;s right. Looking back, the classics RUR is certainly the</p>
<p>machines trying to overthrow the humans. Frankenstein is different. Frankenstein is</p>
<p>a creature. He never has a name. Frankenstein, of course, is the guy who created him, the human,</p>
<p>Dr. Frankenstein. This creature wants to be loved, wants to be accepted. And it is only when</p>
<p>Frankenstein turns his head, in fact, runs the other way. And the creature is without love,</p>
<p>that he becomes the monster that he later becomes.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s the villain in Frankenstein? It&rsquo;s unclear, right?</p>
<p>Oh, it is unclear, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the people who drive him. By driving him away, they bring out the worst.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. They give him no human solace. And he is driven away, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>He becomes, at one point, the friend of a blind man. And he serves this blind man,</p>
<p>and they become very friendly. But when the sighted people of the blind man&rsquo;s family come in,</p>
<p>ah, you&rsquo;ve got a monster here. So it&rsquo;s very didactic in its way. And what I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is that Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley were great readers of the literature surrounding abolition</p>
<p>in the United States, the abolition of slavery. And they picked that up wholesale. You are making</p>
<p>monsters of these people because you won&rsquo;t give them the respect and love that they deserve.</p>
<p>Do you have, if we get philosophical for a second, do you worry that once we create</p>
<p>machines that are a little bit more intelligent, let&rsquo;s look at Roomba, the vacuums, the cleaner,</p>
<p>that this darker part of human nature where we abuse the other, the somebody who&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>will come out?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t worry about it. I could imagine it happening. But I think that what AI has to offer</p>
<p>the human race will be so attractive that people will be won over.</p>
<p>So you have looked deep into these people, had deep conversations, and it&rsquo;s interesting to get</p>
<p>a sense of stories of the way they were thinking and the way it was changed, the way your own</p>
<p>thinking about AI has changed. So you mentioned McCarthy. What about the years at CMU, Carnegie</p>
<p>Mellon, with Joe? Sure. Joe was not in AI. He was in algorithmic complexity.</p>
<p>Was there always a line between AI and computer science, for example?</p>
<p>Is AI its own place of outcasts? Was that the feeling?</p>
<p>There was a kind of outcast period for AI. For instance, in 1974, the new field was hardly 10</p>
<p>years old. The new field of computer science was asked by the National Science Foundation,</p>
<p>I believe, but it may have been the National Academies, I can&rsquo;t remember,</p>
<p>to tell your fellow scientists where computer science is and what it means.</p>
<p>And they wanted to leave out AI. And they only agreed to put it in because Don Knuth said,</p>
<p>hey, this is important. You can&rsquo;t just leave that out.</p>
<p>Really? Don, dude?</p>
<p>Don Knuth, yes.</p>
<p>I talked to him recently, too. Out of all the people.</p>
<p>Yes. But you see, an AI person couldn&rsquo;t have made that argument. He wouldn&rsquo;t have been believed.</p>
<p>But Knuth was believed. Yes.</p>
<p>So Joe Traub worked on the real stuff.</p>
<p>Joe was working on algorithmic complexity. But he would say in plain English again and again,</p>
<p>the smartest people I know are in AI.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Oh, yes. No question. Anyway, Joe loved these guys. What happened was that I guess it was</p>
<p>as I started to write Machines Who Think, Herb Simon and I became very close friends.</p>
<p>He would walk past our house on Northumberland Street every day after work. And I would just</p>
<p>be putting my cover on my typewriter. And I would lean out the door and say,</p>
<p>Herb, would you like a sherry? And Herb almost always would like a sherry. So he&rsquo;d stop in</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d talk for an hour, two hours. My journal says we talked this afternoon for three hours.</p>
<p>What was on his mind at the time in terms of on the AI side of things?</p>
<p>Oh, we didn&rsquo;t talk too much about AI. We talked about other things.</p>
<p>Just life.</p>
<p>We both love literature. And Herb had read Proust in the original French twice all the</p>
<p>way through. I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve read it in English in translation. So we talked about literature.</p>
<p>We talked about languages. We talked about music because he loved music. We talked about</p>
<p>art because he was actually enough of a painter that he had to give it up because he was afraid</p>
<p>it was interfering with his research and so on. So no, it was really just chat, chat.</p>
<p>But it was very warm. So one summer I said to Herb, my students have all the really</p>
<p>interesting conversations. I was teaching at the University of Pittsburgh then in the English</p>
<p>department. They get to talk about the meaning of life and that kind of thing. And what do I have?</p>
<p>I have university meetings where we talk about the photocopying budget and whether the course</p>
<p>on romantic poetry should be one semester or two. So Herb laughed. He said, yes, I know what you</p>
<p>mean. He said, but you could do something about that. Dot, that was his wife, Dot and I used to</p>
<p>have a salon at the University of Chicago every Sunday night. And we would have essentially an</p>
<p>open house and people knew. It wasn&rsquo;t for a small talk. It was really for some topic of</p>
<p>depth. He said, but my advice would be that you choose the topic ahead of time. Fine, I said.</p>
<p>So we exchanged mail over the summer. That was US Post in those days because</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t have personal email. And I decided I would organize it and there would be eight of us,</p>
<p>Alan Noland, his wife, Herb Simon and his wife Dorothea. There was a novelist in town,</p>
<p>a man named Mark Harris. He had just arrived and his wife Josephine. Mark was most famous then for</p>
<p>a novel called Bang the Drum Slowly, which was about baseball. And Joe and me, so eight people.</p>
<p>And we met monthly and we just sank our teeth into really hard topics and it was great fun.</p>
<p>TK How have your own views around artificial intelligence changed</p>
<p>through the process of writing Machines Who Think and afterwards, the ripple effects?</p>
<p>RL I was a little skeptical that this whole thing would work out. It didn&rsquo;t matter. To me,</p>
<p>it was so audacious. AI generally. And in some ways, it hasn&rsquo;t worked out the way I expected</p>
<p>so far. That is to say, there&rsquo;s this wonderful lot of apps, thanks to deep learning and so on.</p>
<p>But those are algorithmic. And in the part of symbolic processing, there&rsquo;s very little yet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a field that lies waiting for industrious graduate students.</p>
<p>TK Maybe you can tell me some figures that popped up in your life in the 80s with expert systems</p>
<p>where there was the symbolic AI possibilities of what most people think of as AI,</p>
<p>if you dream of the possibilities of AI, it&rsquo;s really expert systems. And those hit a few walls</p>
<p>and there was challenges there. And I think, yes, they will reemerge again with some new</p>
<p>breakthroughs and so on. But what did that feel like, both the possibility and the winter that</p>
<p>followed the slowdown in research? BG Ah, you know, this whole thing about AI winter is to me</p>
<p>a crock. TK Snow winters.</p>
<p>BG Because I look at the basic research that was being done in the 80s, which is supposed to be,</p>
<p>my God, it was really important. It was laying down things that nobody had thought about before,</p>
<p>but it was basic research. You couldn&rsquo;t monetize it. Hence the winter.</p>
<p>TK That&rsquo;s the winter. BG You know, research,</p>
<p>scientific research goes and fits and starts. It isn&rsquo;t this nice smooth,</p>
<p>oh, this follows this follows this. No, it just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>TK The interesting thing, the way winters happen, it&rsquo;s never the fault of the researchers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the some source of hype over promising. Well, no, let me take that back. Sometimes it</p>
<p>is the fault of the researchers. Sometimes certain researchers might over promise the</p>
<p>possibilities. They themselves believe that we&rsquo;re just a few years away. Sort of just recently</p>
<p>talked to Elon Musk and he believes he&rsquo;ll have an autonomous vehicle, will have autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>in a year. And he believes it. BG A year?</p>
<p>TK A year. Yeah. With mass deployment of a time.</p>
<p>BG For the record, this is 2019 right now. So he&rsquo;s talking 2020.</p>
<p>TK To do the impossible, you really have to believe it. And I think what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>when you believe it, because there&rsquo;s a lot of really brilliant people around him,</p>
<p>is some good stuff will come out of it. Some unexpected brilliant breakthroughs will come out</p>
<p>of it when you really believe it, when you work that hard. BG I believe that. And I believe</p>
<p>autonomous vehicles will come. I just don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;ll be in a year. I wish.</p>
<p>TK But nevertheless, there&rsquo;s, autonomous vehicles is a good example. There&rsquo;s a feeling</p>
<p>many companies have promised by 2021, by 2022, Ford, GM, basically every single automotive</p>
<p>company has promised they&rsquo;ll have autonomous vehicles. So that kind of over promise is what</p>
<p>leads to the winter. Because we&rsquo;ll come to those dates, there won&rsquo;t be autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>BG And there&rsquo;ll be a feeling, well, wait a minute, if we took your word at that time,</p>
<p>that means we just spent billions of dollars, had made no money, and there&rsquo;s a counter response to</p>
<p>where everybody gives up on it. Sort of intellectually, at every level, the hope just</p>
<p>dies. And all that&rsquo;s left is a few basic researchers. So you&rsquo;re uncomfortable with</p>
<p>some aspects of this idea. TK Well, it&rsquo;s the difference between science and commerce.</p>
<p>BG So you think science goes on the way it does?</p>
<p>TK Oh, science can really be killed by not getting proper funding or timely funding.</p>
<p>I think Great Britain was a perfect example of that. The Lighthill report in,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the year, essentially said, there&rsquo;s no use Great Britain putting any money</p>
<p>into this, it&rsquo;s going nowhere. And this was all about social factions in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Edinburgh hated Cambridge and Cambridge hated Manchester. Somebody else can write that story.</p>
<p>But it really did have a hard effect on research there. Now, they&rsquo;ve come roaring back with Deep</p>
<p>Mind. But that&rsquo;s one guy and his visionaries around him. BG But just to push on that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of interesting. You have this dislike of the idea of an AI winter.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s that coming from? Where were you? TK Oh, because I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>BG There was a particular period of time. It&rsquo;s a romantic notion, certainly.</p>
<p>TK Yeah, well. No, I admire science, perhaps more than I admire commerce. Commerce is fine. Hey,</p>
<p>you know, we all gotta live. But science has a much longer view than commerce and continues</p>
<p>almost regardless. It can&rsquo;t continue totally regardless, but almost regardless of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>saleable and what&rsquo;s not, what&rsquo;s monetizable and what&rsquo;s not. BG So the winter is just something</p>
<p>that happens on the commerce side, and the science marches. That&rsquo;s a beautifully optimistic</p>
<p>and inspiring message. I agree with you. I think if we look at the key people that work in AI,</p>
<p>that work in key scientists in most disciplines, they continue working out of the love for science.</p>
<p>You can always scrape up some funding to stay alive, and they continue working diligently.</p>
<p>But there certainly is a huge amount of funding now, and there&rsquo;s a concern on the AI side and</p>
<p>deep learning. There&rsquo;s a concern that we might, with over promising, hit another slowdown in</p>
<p>funding, which does affect the number of students, you know, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>RG Yeah, it does. BG So the kind of ideas you had in Machines Who Think,</p>
<p>did you continue that curiosity through the decades that followed?</p>
<p>RG Yes, I did. BG And what was your view, historical view of how AI community evolved,</p>
<p>the conversations about it, the work? Has it persisted the same way from its birth?</p>
<p>RG No, of course not. It&rsquo;s just as we were just talking, the symbolic AI really kind of dried up</p>
<p>and it all became algorithmic. I remember a young AI student telling me what he was doing,</p>
<p>and I had been away from the field long enough. I&rsquo;d gotten involved with complexity at the Santa</p>
<p>Fe Institute. I thought, algorithms, yeah, they&rsquo;re in the service of, but they&rsquo;re not the main event.</p>
<p>No, they became the main event. That surprised me. And we all know the downside of this. We all</p>
<p>know that if you&rsquo;re using an algorithm to make decisions based on a gazillion human decisions,</p>
<p>baked into it are all the mistakes that humans make, the bigotries, the short sightedness,</p>
<p>and so on and so on. BG So you mentioned Santa Fe Institute. So you&rsquo;ve written the novel</p>
<p>Edge of Chaos, but it&rsquo;s inspired by the ideas of complexity, a lot of which have been extensively</p>
<p>explored at the Santa Fe Institute. It&rsquo;s another fascinating topic, just sort of emergent</p>
<p>complexity from chaos. Nobody knows how it happens really, but it seems to where all the interesting</p>
<p>stuff does happen. So how did first, not your novel, but just complexity in general and the</p>
<p>work at Santa Fe, fit into the bigger puzzle of the history of AI? Or maybe even your personal</p>
<p>journey through that? RG One of the last projects I did</p>
<p>concerning AI in particular was looking at the work of Harold Cohen, the painter. And Harold was</p>
<p>deeply involved with AI. He was a painter first. And what his project, ARIN, which was a lifelong</p>
<p>project, did was reflect his own cognitive processes. Okay. Harold and I, even though I wrote</p>
<p>a book about it, we had a lot of friction between us. And I went, I thought, this is it. The book</p>
<p>died. It was published and fell into a ditch. This is it. I&rsquo;m finished. It&rsquo;s time for me to</p>
<p>do something different. By chance, this was a sabbatical year for my husband. And we spent two</p>
<p>months at the Santa Fe Institute and two months at Caltech. And then the spring semester in Munich,</p>
<p>Germany. Okay. Those two months at the Santa Fe Institute were so restorative for me. And I began</p>
<p>to, the Institute was very small then. It was in some kind of office complex on old Santa Fe trail.</p>
<p>Everybody kept their door open. So you could crack your head on a problem. And if you finally didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get it, you could walk in to see Stuart Kaufman or any number of people and say, I don&rsquo;t get this.</p>
<p>Can you explain? And one of the people that I was talking to about complex adaptive systems</p>
<p>was Murray Gelman. And I told Murray what Harold Cohen had done. And I said, you know,</p>
<p>this sounds to me like a complex adaptive system. And he said, yeah, it is. Well, what do you know?</p>
<p>Harold Aaron had all these kids and cousins all over the world in science and in economics and</p>
<p>so on and so forth. I was so relieved. I thought, okay, your instincts are okay. You&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>right thing. I didn&rsquo;t have the vocabulary. And that was one of the things that the Santa Fe</p>
<p>Institute gave me. If I could have rewritten that book, no, it had just come out. I couldn&rsquo;t rewrite</p>
<p>it. I would have had a vocabulary to explain what Aaron was doing. Okay. So I got really interested</p>
<p>in what was going on at the Institute. The people were, again, bright and funny and willing to</p>
<p>explain anything to this amateur. George Cowan, who was then the head of the Institute, said he</p>
<p>thought it might be a nice idea if I wrote a book about the Institute. And I thought about it and I</p>
<p>had my eye on some other project, God knows what. And I said, I&rsquo;m sorry, George. Yeah, I&rsquo;d really</p>
<p>love to do it, but just not going to work for me at this moment. He said, oh, too bad. I think it</p>
<p>would make an interesting book. Well, he was right and I was wrong. I wish I&rsquo;d done it. But that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that, that that was a road not taken that I wish I&rsquo;d taken.</p>
<p>Well, you know what? Just on that point, it&rsquo;s quite brave for you as a writer, as sort of</p>
<p>coming from a world of literature and the literary thinking and historical thinking. I mean, just</p>
<p>from that world and bravely talking to quite, I assume, large egos in AI or in complexity.</p>
<p>Yeah, in AI or in complexity and so on. How&rsquo;d you do it? I mean, I suppose they could be</p>
<p>intimidated of you as well because it&rsquo;s two different worlds coming together.</p>
<p>I never picked up that anybody was intimidated by me.</p>
<p>But how were you brave enough? Where did you find the guts to sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>God, just dumb luck. I mean, this is an interesting rock to turn over. I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to write a book about it. And you know, people have enough patience with writers</p>
<p>if they think they&rsquo;re going to end up in a book that they let you flail around and so on.</p>
<p>Well, but they also look if the writer has,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a sparkle in their eye, if they get it.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>When were you at the Santa Fe Institute?</p>
<p>The time I&rsquo;m talking about is 1990, 1991, 1992. But we then, because Joe was an external faculty</p>
<p>member, were in Santa Fe every summer. We bought a house there and I didn&rsquo;t have that much to do</p>
<p>with the Institute anymore. I was writing my novels. I was doing whatever I was doing.</p>
<p>But I loved the Institute and I loved</p>
<p>again, the audacity of the ideas. That really appeals to me.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s this feeling, much like in great institutes of neuroscience, for example,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in it for the long game of understanding something fundamental about</p>
<p>reality and nature. And that&rsquo;s really exciting. So if we start now to look a little bit more recently,</p>
<p>how, you know, AI is really popular today. How is this world, you mentioned algorithmic,</p>
<p>but in general, is the spirit of the people, the kind of conversations you hear through the</p>
<p>grapevine and so on, is that different than the roots that you remember?</p>
<p>No. The same kind of excitement, the same kind of, this is really going to make a difference</p>
<p>in the world. And it will. It has. You know, a lot of folks, especially young, 20 years old or</p>
<p>something, they think we&rsquo;ve just found something special here. We&rsquo;re going to change the world</p>
<p>tomorrow. On a time scale, do you have a sense of what, of the time scale at which breakthroughs</p>
<p>of the time scale at which breakthroughs in AI happen? I really don&rsquo;t. Because look at Deep Learning.</p>
<p>That was, Jeffrey Hinton came up with the algorithm in 86. But it took all these years</p>
<p>for the technology to be good enough to actually be applicable. So no, I can&rsquo;t predict that at all.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t even try. Well, let me ask you to, not to try to predict, but to speak to the,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m sure in the 60s, as it continues now, there&rsquo;s people that think, let&rsquo;s call it,</p>
<p>we can call it this fun word, the singularity. When there&rsquo;s a phase shift, there&rsquo;s some profound</p>
<p>feeling where we&rsquo;re all really surprised by what&rsquo;s able to be achieved. I&rsquo;m sure those dreams are</p>
<p>there. I remember reading quotes in the 60s and those continued. How have your own views,</p>
<p>maybe if you look back, about the timeline of a singularity changed?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the singularity as Ray Kurzweil has presented it.</p>
<p>How would you define the Ray Kurzweil? How do you think of singularity in those?</p>
<p>If I understand Kurzweil&rsquo;s view, it&rsquo;s sort of, there&rsquo;s going to be this moment when machines</p>
<p>are smarter than humans and, you know, game over. However, the game over is. I mean, do they put us</p>
<p>on a reservation? Do they, et cetera, et cetera. And first of all, machines are smarter than humans</p>
<p>in some ways all over the place. And they have been since adding machines were invented.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not going to come like some great eatable crossroads, you know, where</p>
<p>they meet each other and our offspring, Oedipus says, you&rsquo;re dead. It&rsquo;s just not going to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah. So it&rsquo;s already game over with calculators, right? They&rsquo;re already out to do much better at</p>
<p>basic arithmetic than us. But you know, there&rsquo;s a human like intelligence. And it&rsquo;s not the ones</p>
<p>that destroy us, but you know, somebody that you can have as a, as a friend, you can have deep</p>
<p>connections with that kind of passing the touring test and beyond those kinds of ideas. Have you</p>
<p>dreamt of those? Oh yes, yes, yes. Those possibilities. In a book I wrote with Ed Feigenbaum,</p>
<p>a book I wrote with Ed Feigenbaum, there&rsquo;s a little story called the geriatric robot.</p>
<p>And how I came up with the geriatric robot is a story in itself. But here&rsquo;s what the geriatric</p>
<p>robot does. It doesn&rsquo;t just clean you up and feed you and wheel you out into the sun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great advantages. It listens. It says, tell me again about the great coup of 73. Tell me again</p>
<p>about how awful or how wonderful your grandchildren are and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And it isn&rsquo;t hanging around to inherit your money. It isn&rsquo;t hanging around because it can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>any other job. This is his job. And so on and so forth. Well, I would love something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, for me, that deeply excites me. So I think there&rsquo;s a lot of us.</p>
<p>Lex, you gotta know, it was a joke. I dreamed it up because I needed to talk to college students</p>
<p>and I needed to give them some idea of what AI might be. And they were rolling in the aisles as</p>
<p>I elaborated and elaborated and elaborated. When it went into the book, they took my hide off</p>
<p>in the New York Review of Books. This is just what we have thought about these people in AI.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re inhuman. Come on, get over it. Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s a good thing for</p>
<p>the world that AI could potentially do? I do. Absolutely. And furthermore,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pushing 80 now. By the time I need help like that, I also want it to roll itself in a corner</p>
<p>and shut the fuck up. Let me linger on that point. Do you really though?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do. Here&rsquo;s why. Don&rsquo;t you want it to push back a little bit?</p>
<p>A little. But I have watched my friends go through the whole issue around having help</p>
<p>in the house. And some of them have been very lucky and had fabulous help. And some of them</p>
<p>have had people in the house who want to keep the television going on all day, who want to talk on</p>
<p>their phones all day. No. Just roll yourself in the corner and shut the fuck up. Unfortunately,</p>
<p>us humans, when we&rsquo;re assistants, we&rsquo;re still, even when we&rsquo;re assisting others,</p>
<p>we care about ourselves more. Of course. And so you create more frustration. And a robot AI</p>
<p>assistant can really optimize the experience for you. I was just speaking to the point,</p>
<p>you actually bring up a very, very good point. But I was speaking to the fact that</p>
<p>us humans are a little complicated, that we don&rsquo;t necessarily want a perfect servant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, maybe you disagree with that, but there&rsquo;s a, I think there&rsquo;s a push and pull with humans.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>A little tension, a little mystery that, of course, that&rsquo;s really difficult for AI to get right. But</p>
<p>I do sense, especially today with social media, that people are getting more and more lonely,</p>
<p>even young folks, and sometimes especially young folks, that loneliness, there&rsquo;s a longing for</p>
<p>connection and AI can help alleviate some of that loneliness. Some, just somebody who listens,</p>
<p>like in person. So to speak. So to speak, yeah. So to speak. Yeah, that to me is really exciting.</p>
<p>That is really exciting. But so if we look at that, that level of intelligence, which is</p>
<p>exceptionally difficult to achieve actually, as the singularity or whatever, that&rsquo;s the human level</p>
<p>bar, that people have dreamt of that too. Turing dreamt of it. He had a date timeline. Do you have,</p>
<p>how have your own timeline evolved on past?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think about it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even think?</p>
<p>No. Just this field has been so full of surprises for me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just taking in and see the fun about the basic science.</p>
<p>Yeah. I just can&rsquo;t. Maybe that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been around the field long enough to think,</p>
<p>you know, don&rsquo;t go that way. Herb Simon was terrible about making these predictions of</p>
<p>when this and that would happen. And he was a sensible guy.</p>
<p>His quotes are often used, right?</p>
<p>As a legend, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you have concerns about AI, the existential threats that many people</p>
<p>like Elon Musk and Sam Harris and others are thinking about?</p>
<p>Yeah. That takes up half a chapter in my book. I call it the male gaze.</p>
<p>Well, you hear me out. The male gaze is actually a term from film criticism.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m blocking on the women who dreamed this up. But she pointed out how most movies were</p>
<p>made from the male point of view, that women were objects, not subjects. They didn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>agency and so on and so forth. So when Elon and his pals Hawking and so on came,</p>
<p>AI is going to eat our lunch and our dinner and our midnight snack too, I thought, what?</p>
<p>And I said to Ed Feigenbaum, oh, this is the first guy. First, these guys have always been</p>
<p>the smartest guy on the block. And here comes something that might be smarter. Oh, let&rsquo;s stamp</p>
<p>it out before it takes over. And Ed laughed. He said, I didn&rsquo;t think about it that way.</p>
<p>But I did. I did. And it is the male gaze. Okay, suppose these things do have agency.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s wait and see what happens. Can we imbue them with ethics? Can we imbue them</p>
<p>with a sense of empathy? Or are they just going to be, I don&rsquo;t know, we&rsquo;ve had centuries of guys</p>
<p>like that. That&rsquo;s interesting that the ego, the male gaze is immediately threatened. And so you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t think in a patient, calm way of how the tech could evolve. Speaking of which, your 96 book,</p>
<p>The Future of Women, I think at the time and now, certainly now, I mean, I&rsquo;m sorry, maybe at the</p>
<p>time, but I&rsquo;m more cognizant of now, is extremely relevant. You and Nancy Ramsey talk about four</p>
<p>possible futures of women in science and tech. So if we look at the decades before and after</p>
<p>the book was released, can you tell a history, sorry, of women in science and tech and how it</p>
<p>has evolved? How have things changed? Where do we stand? Not enough. They have not changed enough.</p>
<p>The way that women are ground down in computing is simply unbelievable. But what are the four</p>
<p>possible futures for women in tech from the book? What you&rsquo;re really looking at are various aspects</p>
<p>of the present. So for each of those, you could say, oh yeah, we do have backlash. Look at what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening with abortion and so on and so forth. We have one step forward, one step back.</p>
<p>The golden age of equality was the hardest chapter to write. And I used something from</p>
<p>the Santa Fe Institute, which is the sandpile effect, that you drop sand very slowly onto a pile</p>
<p>and it grows and it grows and it grows until suddenly it just breaks apart. And</p>
<p>in a way, Me Too has done that. That was the last drop of sand that broke everything apart.</p>
<p>That was a perfect example of the sandpile effect. And that made me feel good. It didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>change all of society, but it really woke a lot of people up. But are you in general optimistic</p>
<p>about maybe after Me Too? I mean, Me Too is about a very specific kind of thing.</p>
<p>Boy, solve that and you solve everything.</p>
<p>But are you in general optimistic about the future?</p>
<p>Yes. I&rsquo;m a congenital optimistic. I can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>What about AI? What are your thoughts about the future of AI?</p>
<p>Of course, I get asked, what do you worry about? And the one thing I worry about is the things</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t anticipate. There&rsquo;s going to be something out of left field that we will just say,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t prepared for that. I am generally optimistic. When I first took up</p>
<p>being interested in AI, like most people in the field, more intelligence was like more virtue.</p>
<p>You know, what could be bad? And in a way, I still believe that. But I realize that my</p>
<p>notion of intelligence has broadened. There are many kinds of intelligence,</p>
<p>and we need to imbue our machines with those many kinds.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve now just finished or in the process of finishing the book that you&rsquo;ve been working</p>
<p>on, the memoir, how have you changed? I know it&rsquo;s just writing, but how have you changed</p>
<p>the process? If you look back, what kind of stuff did it bring up to you that surprised you,</p>
<p>looking at the entirety of it all? The biggest thing, and it really wasn&rsquo;t a surprise,</p>
<p>is how lucky I was. Oh, my. To have access to the beginning of a scientific field that is going to</p>
<p>change the world. How did I luck out? And yes, of course, my view of things has widened a lot.</p>
<p>If I can get back to one feminist part of our conversation. Without knowing it,</p>
<p>it really was subconscious. I wanted AI to succeed because I was so tired of hearing</p>
<p>that intelligence was inside the male cranium. And I thought if there was something out there</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t a male thinking and doing well, then that would put a lie to this whole notion of</p>
<p>intelligence resides in the male cranium. I did not know that until one night Harold Cohen and I</p>
<p>were having a glass of wine, maybe two, and he said, what drew you to AI? And I said, oh,</p>
<p>you know, smartest people I knew, great project, blah, blah, blah. And I said, and I wanted</p>
<p>something besides male smarts. And it just bubbled up out of me like, what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of brilliant, actually. So AI really humbles all of us and humbles the people that</p>
<p>need to be humbled the most. Let&rsquo;s hope.</p>
<p>Wow. That is so beautiful. Pamela, thank you so much for talking to me. It&rsquo;s really a huge honor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a great pleasure.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
