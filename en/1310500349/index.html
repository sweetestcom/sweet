    <p>The following is a conversation with Coffee Zilla,</p>
<p>an investigator and journalist exposing frauds,</p>
<p>scams, and fake gurus.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the most important journalistic voices</p>
<p>we have working today,</p>
<p>both in terms of his integrity and fearlessness</p>
<p>in the pursuit of truth.</p>
<p>Please follow, watch, and support his work</p>
<p>at youtube.com slash Coffee Zilla.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Rocket Money for savings and subscriptions,</p>
<p>Eight Sleep for naps,</p>
<p>Better Help for mental health,</p>
<p>and Masterclass for online learning.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, on to the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting.</p>
<p>I swear I do.</p>
<p>But if you skip them, please still check out the sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Rocket Money,</p>
<p>an app that helps you identify</p>
<p>and stop paying for subscriptions you don&rsquo;t need,</p>
<p>want, or simply forgot about.</p>
<p>On average, people save up to $700 a year with Rocket Money.</p>
<p>You know how there&rsquo;s garbage out in space?</p>
<p>And space is really big,</p>
<p>but it starts getting cluttered up.</p>
<p>Same with there&rsquo;s garbage out in the ocean.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny how this garbage</p>
<p>just starts accumulating in different places.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think of subscriptions</p>
<p>and these little things that sneak in</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not paying attention to,</p>
<p>that you signed up for with the best intentions,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t use anymore,</p>
<p>and you forgot you subscribed to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really nice to get rid of that</p>
<p>because it really does add up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great, great way to save money.</p>
<p>And also, to have an easy heart</p>
<p>that you can feel safe signing up for stuff</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re legitimately curious,</p>
<p>knowing that it&rsquo;ll be caught</p>
<p>and eventually removed with Rocket Money.</p>
<p>So anyway, start canceling subscriptions today</p>
<p>at rocketmoney.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>You could save hundreds a year at rocketmoney.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Eight Sleep</p>
<p>and its new Pod 3 mattress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place of happiness for me,</p>
<p>a great nap on a cold bed with a warm blanket,</p>
<p>away from the world,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking, focused on reading,</p>
<p>and drifting slowly into sleep,</p>
<p>as you probably are to the sound of my voice.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Maybe I should collaborate with Eight Sleep,</p>
<p>where they have a little audio device in the mattress,</p>
<p>and I speak sweet nothings into your ears.</p>
<p>As you fall asleep.</p>
<p>I think nobody will want that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just brainstorming ideas here.</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah, I&rsquo;m a big, big, big, big believer</p>
<p>of power naps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really powerful way for me to refresh my mind,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just honestly really something I look forward to,</p>
<p>is doing that on an Eight Sleep bed,</p>
<p>versus on the floor, or on a hotel mattress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things I look forward to, actually,</p>
<p>to get back home to.</p>
<p>Anyway, check it out and get special savings</p>
<p>when you go to eightsleep.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp,</p>
<p>spelled H-E-L-P, help.</p>
<p>They figure out what you need,</p>
<p>and match you with a licensed professional therapist</p>
<p>in under 48 hours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been speaking with a bunch of folks recently</p>
<p>about the value of therapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of surprising to me,</p>
<p>how many people from all kinds of walks of life,</p>
<p>at some point in their life,</p>
<p>if not continuously throughout their life,</p>
<p>got a lot of value from therapy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize this, I think, earlier in my life.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of value to it,</p>
<p>and I think the nice thing about BetterHelp</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s just really accessible and easy to get started.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s something you haven&rsquo;t tried before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely worth trying.</p>
<p>You should try as many things as possible.</p>
<p>So this has helped a lot of people,</p>
<p>so why won&rsquo;t you give it a try?</p>
<p>Check them out at betterhelp.com slash Lex,</p>
<p>and save on your first month.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by MasterClass.</p>
<p>$180 a year gets you an all-access pass</p>
<p>to watch courses from the best people in the world</p>
<p>in their respective disciplines.</p>
<p>We got Chris Hadfield, we got Will Wright,</p>
<p>Carlos Santana, Garrett Gasparro,</p>
<p>Daniel Negreanu, Neil Gaiman, Martin Scorsese.</p>
<p>What would I not give to talk to Martin Scorsese?</p>
<p>But until then, you can listen to the MasterClass.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really fundamental difference</p>
<p>between MasterClass and podcasts.</p>
<p>I think long-form podcasts are good</p>
<p>at sort of having the fun, relaxed exploration of ideas,</p>
<p>and MasterClass is, no pun intended,</p>
<p>masterful at doing structured communication</p>
<p>of those ideas from the best people in the world.</p>
<p>It really is just a really crisp lecture</p>
<p>on what those folks know best and are best at.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just infinite value, honestly,</p>
<p>especially if there&rsquo;s people on there</p>
<p>that you really want to learn from,</p>
<p>and I bet there is if you look at the list.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely worth trying.</p>
<p>Go to masterclass.com slash Lex</p>
<p>to give the gift of an annual membership</p>
<p>when you buy one of your own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s masterclass.com slash Lex.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Coffee Zilla.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>How do you like your coffee?</p>
<p>Dark and soul-crushing?</p>
<p>That was the number one question on the internet.</p>
<p>Do you like your coffee to reverberate deeply</p>
<p>through the worst of human nature?</p>
<p>Is that how you drink your coffee?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through a lot of phases on coffee.</p>
<p>I used to, in college, I would go super deep</p>
<p>into grinding fresh beans, all of that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>water temperature exactly right.</p>
<p>And then I hit a phase where I was just,</p>
<p>it was the maintenance dose.</p>
<p>Then I went to espresso because I could get a lot more in.</p>
<p>And now I go through phases of,</p>
<p>sometimes I like it with a little oat milk,</p>
<p>sometimes a little half and half in sugar</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m feeling it.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;ve gotten soft in your old age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone a little, I have.</p>
<p>But hey, if I&rsquo;m doing a SBF interview,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s black that day, nothing less.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s black, no sugar.</p>
<p>The lights go down.</p>
<p>What do you actually do in those situations,</p>
<p>like leading up to a show?</p>
<p>Do you get hyped up?</p>
<p>How do you put yourself in the right mind space</p>
<p>to explore some of these really difficult topics?</p>
<p>I think a lot of it&rsquo;s preparation.</p>
<p>And then once it happens, it&rsquo;s mostly fueled</p>
<p>by sort of adrenaline, I would say.</p>
<p>I really deeply care about getting to the root cause</p>
<p>of some of these issues because I think so often</p>
<p>people in positions of power are let off the hook.</p>
<p>So I really care about holding their feet to the fire</p>
<p>and it translates into a lot of energy the day of.</p>
<p>So I never find myself, funny enough,</p>
<p>I usually drink a lot of caffeine</p>
<p>leading up to the interview.</p>
<p>And then I try to drink minimum the day of</p>
<p>because I have so much adrenaline,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be hyper-stimulated.</p>
<p>I have to say, of all the recent guests I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>the energy you had when you walked into the door</p>
<p>was pretty intense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited!</p>
<p>Are people not excited to be here?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re scared.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re a big deal, Lex.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re scared.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know.</p>
<p>I felt like you were gonna knock down the door or something.</p>
<p>You were very excited.</p>
<p>Like that just energy.</p>
<p>It was terrifying because I&rsquo;m terrified</p>
<p>of social interaction.</p>
<p>Anyway, speaking of terrifying.</p>
<p>You chose a good living of interviewing people.</p>
<p>Face your fears, my friend.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about SBF and FTX.</p>
<p>Who is Sam Bankman-Freed?</p>
<p>Can you tell the story from the beginning</p>
<p>as you understand it?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Sam Bankman-Freed is a kid who grew up</p>
<p>sort of from a position of huge privilege.</p>
<p>Both his parents are lawyers.</p>
<p>I believe both of them were from Harvard.</p>
<p>He went to MIT, went to like,</p>
<p>or sorry, backing up a bit more,</p>
<p>he went to like this top prep high school.</p>
<p>Then to MIT.</p>
<p>Then he went to Jane Street.</p>
<p>And after that, he started a trading firm</p>
<p>in I think 2017 called Alameda Research</p>
<p>with a few friends.</p>
<p>Some of them were from Jane Street.</p>
<p>Some of them worked at Google.</p>
<p>And they were sort of the smartest kids on the block</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s what everyone thought.</p>
<p>They made a lot of their money</p>
<p>on something called the Kimchi Premium,</p>
<p>or at least the story goes, which just to explain that,</p>
<p>the price of Bitcoin in Korea was substantially higher</p>
<p>than in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And so you could arbitrage that</p>
<p>by buying Bitcoin elsewhere</p>
<p>and selling it on a Korean exchange.</p>
<p>So they made their money early</p>
<p>doing kind of smart trades like that.</p>
<p>They flipped that into market making,</p>
<p>which they were pretty early on that,</p>
<p>just providing liquidity to an exchange.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a strategy that is considered delta neutral,</p>
<p>which means basically,</p>
<p>if you take kind of both sides of the trade</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re making a spread, like a fee on that,</p>
<p>you make money, whether it goes up or down.</p>
<p>So in theory,</p>
<p>there shouldn&rsquo;t be that much risk associated with it.</p>
<p>So Alameda kind of blew up</p>
<p>because they would offer these people,</p>
<p>people who are giving out loans,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d say, hey,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give you this really attractive rate of return.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing strategies that seemingly are low risk.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re a low risk bet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the smart kids from Jane Street,</p>
<p>and you can kind of trust us to be this</p>
<p>smarter than everyone else kind of thing.</p>
<p>Around 2019, Sam started FTX,</p>
<p>which is an exchange.</p>
<p>Specifically, it specialized in derivatives.</p>
<p>So like margins,</p>
<p>kind of more sophisticated crypto products.</p>
<p>And it got in with Binance early on.</p>
<p>So Binance actually has a prior relationship to FTX,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll explore in a second,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re going to play a role</p>
<p>in FTX&rsquo;s collapse actually.</p>
<p>Binance is the number one crypto exchange,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re led by,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s called CZ on Twitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to butcher his full name,</p>
<p>but really smart guy has played his hand really well</p>
<p>and built up a quite large exchange.</p>
<p>And Binance was funding a bunch of different like startups.</p>
<p>So they funded,</p>
<p>they helped invest into FTX.</p>
<p>Early on, they invested a hundred million.</p>
<p>So these guys were kind of like teammates early on,</p>
<p>SBF and CZ.</p>
<p>And FTX quickly grew.</p>
<p>They got like, especially in 2020, 2021,</p>
<p>they got a lot of endorsements.</p>
<p>They got a lot of credibility in the space.</p>
<p>And eventually FTX actually bought out Binance.</p>
<p>They gave them $2 billion.</p>
<p>So pretty good investment for CZ in a couple of years.</p>
<p>And now lead that up to 2022, what happens?</p>
<p>Luna collapse, Three Arrows Capital collapse,</p>
<p>which if you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just these kinds of cataclysmic events in crypto</p>
<p>led by some pretty risky behavior,</p>
<p>whether Luna was a token</p>
<p>that promised really attractive returns</p>
<p>that were unsustainable ultimately,</p>
<p>and it just kind of spiraled.</p>
<p>It did what&rsquo;s called a stable coin death spiral,</p>
<p>which we can talk about if we need to.</p>
<p>The stable coin death spiral.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait till that like actually enters the lexicon,</p>
<p>like a Wikipedia page on it,</p>
<p>like economic students are learning in school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a chapter in a book.</p>
<p>Anyway, I mean, this is the reality of our world.</p>
<p>This is a really big part of the economic system</p>
<p>is cryptocurrency and stable coin is part of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird because on the one hand,</p>
<p>cryptocurrency is supposed to somewhat simplify</p>
<p>or add transparency to the financial markets.</p>
<p>The idea is for the first time,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to wait for an SEC filing</p>
<p>from some corporate business.</p>
<p>You can look at what they&rsquo;re doing on chain, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good because a lot of big financial problems</p>
<p>are caused by lack of transparency</p>
<p>and lack of understanding risk.</p>
<p>But ironically, you get some people</p>
<p>creating these arbitrarily complicated financial products</p>
<p>like algorithmic stable coins,</p>
<p>which then introduce more risk and blow everything up.</p>
<p>So anyways, Three Arrows Capital blew up</p>
<p>and all of a sudden this crypto industry,</p>
<p>which everyone thought was going to the moon,</p>
<p>Bitcoin to 100,000 is in some trouble.</p>
<p>And FTX seems like the only people who,</p>
<p>besides like Binance,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also really big and stable and Coinbase,</p>
<p>they seemed like they were doing fine.</p>
<p>In fact, they were bailing out companies in the summer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember that SBF</p>
<p>was likened to like Jamie Diamond,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the CEO of Chase,</p>
<p>who like kind of was like the buck stops here.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m like the backstop, right?</p>
<p>So SBF was supporting the industry.</p>
<p>He was like the stable guy.</p>
<p>So come to like around October and November,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all this talk about regulation.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s been blowing up.</p>
<p>SBF&rsquo;s leading the charge on regulation.</p>
<p>And CZ, the CEO of Binance gets word</p>
<p>that maybe SBF is kind of like cutting them out</p>
<p>or making regulation that would maybe impact his business.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t like that too much.</p>
<p>They start kind of feuding a little bit on Twitter.</p>
<p>So when it comes out, a CoinDesk report came out</p>
<p>that FTX&rsquo;s balance sheet wasn&rsquo;t looking that good.</p>
<p>Like it looked pretty weak.</p>
<p>They had a lot of coins that in theory had value</p>
<p>if you looked at their market price,</p>
<p>but for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>if you tried to sell them, they&rsquo;d collapse in value.</p>
<p>So it was sort of like this thing, a house built on sand.</p>
<p>And a friend of mine on Twitter,</p>
<p>he goes by Dirty Bubble Media.</p>
<p>He released a report and he basically said,</p>
<p>I think these guys are insolvent.</p>
<p>Well, CZ saw that and he retweeted it</p>
<p>and started adding fuel to the fire of like the speculation.</p>
<p>Because up till this point,</p>
<p>everyone thought FTX is super safe, super secure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to not keep your money there.</p>
<p>Tom Brady keeps his money there, whatever.</p>
<p>And CZ kind of adds fuel to the fire by saying,</p>
<p>not only am I retweeting this,</p>
<p>adding kind of like validity to this speculation,</p>
<p>but also I&rsquo;m going to take the FTT that I got,</p>
<p>which part of their balance sheet was this FTT token,</p>
<p>which is FTX&rsquo;s like proprietary token.</p>
<p>And Alameda and FTX control a lot of it.</p>
<p>They were using this token to basically be</p>
<p>a large amount of collateral for their whole balance sheet.</p>
<p>So it accounted for this huge amount of their value.</p>
<p>And the CEO of Binance had a huge chunk of it as well.</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;m going to sell all of it.</p>
<p>And the fuel that that introduced to the market is,</p>
<p>if he sells all this FTT,</p>
<p>and this FTT is underwriting a lot of the value of FTX.</p>
<p>Does FTT almost approximate like similar things</p>
<p>if you were to buy a stock in a public company?</p>
<p>Is that kind of like a stock in FTX?</p>
<p>It sort of was this proxy because what FTX</p>
<p>was committed to doing was sort of like</p>
<p>buying back FTT tokens.</p>
<p>They would do this thing called the buy and burn.</p>
<p>I think there was some amount of sharing</p>
<p>in the revenue fees of FTX.</p>
<p>It was kind of this convoluted thing.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the exact value of FTT</p>
<p>was speculated from the beginning.</p>
<p>And it was clear that it was very tied</p>
<p>to the performance of FTX,</p>
<p>which is important because we&rsquo;ll get to later,</p>
<p>FTX sort of built their whole scaffold on FTT,</p>
<p>which meant that this scaffold was very wobbly.</p>
<p>Because if FTX loses a little bit of confidence,</p>
<p>then your value goes down.</p>
<p>When your value goes down,</p>
<p>you lose more confidence and this goes down.</p>
<p>So it was kind of like this thing that this flywheel</p>
<p>that when it was going well,</p>
<p>you got huge amounts of growth.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s going bad,</p>
<p>you get a exchange death spiral, so to speak.</p>
<p>Actually this structure,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty non-standard structure.</p>
<p>Did the architects of its initial design</p>
<p>anticipate the wobbliness of the whole system?</p>
<p>So putting fraud and all those things</p>
<p>that happened later aside,</p>
<p>do you think it was difficult to anticipate</p>
<p>this kind of FTT, FTX element of research weird dynamic?</p>
<p>No, because I think sophisticated traders</p>
<p>always think in terms of diversification and correlation.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to,</p>
<p>the way to think about risk in investing is like,</p>
<p>if I invest in you, Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>and then I also invest in some product you produce,</p>
<p>the performance of those two things</p>
<p>will be pretty correlated.</p>
<p>So whether I invest in you or I invest in this product</p>
<p>that you are completely behind, I&rsquo;m not de-risking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically counting all on you doing well, right?</p>
<p>And if you do bad, my investments do very bad.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m trying to build a stable thing,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t put all my eggs in the Lex Friedman basket</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m positive that you&rsquo;re gonna do well, right?</p>
<p>And these people-</p>
<p>As your financial advisor,</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend</p>
<p>you do not put all your eggs in this basket.</p>
<p>Right, and so you can think about it like,</p>
<p>if I know that these people were trained to think like this.</p>
<p>And so the idea that you could start this exchange,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re worth billions of dollars,</p>
<p>and you underwrite your whole system by betting,</p>
<p>putting most of it on your own token is insane.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s crazy is we&rsquo;ll later find out</p>
<p>that they were basically taking customer assets,</p>
<p>which were real things like Bitcoin and Ethereum</p>
<p>with risks that were not so correlated to FDX,</p>
<p>and they were swapping them out.</p>
<p>They were using to go basically gamble those</p>
<p>and putting FTT in its place as quote value.</p>
<p>So they were increasing the risk of the system</p>
<p>in order to bet big with the idea</p>
<p>that if they bet big and won,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d all be singing their praises.</p>
<p>If they bet big and lost,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they had a plan,</p>
<p>but I think they were being extremely risky</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way to avoid their knowledge of that.</p>
<p>So when you say customer assets is,</p>
<p>I come to this crypto exchange,</p>
<p>I have Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>and this is a thing that has pretty stable value over time.</p>
<p>I mean, as crypto, relatively so,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to store it on this crypto exchange.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>This is, so this thing to the degree</p>
<p>that crypto holds value,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to continue holding value.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not supposed to be an extra risk</p>
<p>inserted into the thing.</p>
<p>Right, and FTX was pretty clear from the beginning</p>
<p>that they wouldn&rsquo;t invest your assets in anything else.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t do anything else with it.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t trade it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what made FTX so,</p>
<p>such like a horror story for investor confidence</p>
<p>is basically they made every signal</p>
<p>that they would not do anything nefarious with your tokens.</p>
<p>They would just put them to the side,</p>
<p>put them in a separate account</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have access to.</p>
<p>And they just kind of wait there</p>
<p>until the day that you&rsquo;re ready to withdraw them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s explicitly what they told their customers.</p>
<p>So going back to the story a little bit,</p>
<p>CZ then says, hey, I&rsquo;m selling this token</p>
<p>that underwrites the value of FTX.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a total panic.</p>
<p>SBF during this time says several lies</p>
<p>such as FTX assets are fine.</p>
<p>We have enough money to cover all withdrawals.</p>
<p>And a day later, he basically admits</p>
<p>that that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the money, they&rsquo;re shutting down.</p>
<p>And then a few days later after that,</p>
<p>they declared bankruptcy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I should be clear,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Alameda Research, FTX International,</p>
<p>and FTX US, which is the US side of things.</p>
<p>These are three different entities.</p>
<p>All of them are in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not clear to the extent</p>
<p>that they were commingling funds,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clear that they were commingling funds</p>
<p>to some extent.</p>
<p>So they kind of were taking from each other.</p>
<p>And that is where the fraud happens, right?</p>
<p>Because if going back to our earlier analogy,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re supposed to set funds aside,</p>
<p>and I find out you were using it</p>
<p>to go make all these arbitrage trades</p>
<p>or do market making or all these activities</p>
<p>you were known for,</p>
<p>for your like hedge fund trading firm thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge problem</p>
<p>because he basically lied about this.</p>
<p>And especially when he&rsquo;s saying explicitly</p>
<p>that we have these things,</p>
<p>we have these funds,</p>
<p>and these things turn out to be lies.</p>
<p>Well, again, the question of fraud comes in</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, there&rsquo;s no way he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So the obvious question might be,</p>
<p>well, why isn&rsquo;t he locked up?</p>
<p>Why is he running around?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because really his story</p>
<p>is that he didn&rsquo;t know any of it.</p>
<p>He found out that they had,</p>
<p>to steel man his position,</p>
<p>he would say he was totally disconnected</p>
<p>from what Alameda was doing.</p>
<p>He had no idea that they had such a large margin position</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d had an accounting quirk</p>
<p>and that accounting quirk hit $8 billion from his view.</p>
<p>And so when he was saying that they had money to cover it,</p>
<p>he was saying that truthfully to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>And he just was so distracted at the time</p>
<p>that he made a series of increasingly embarrassing mistakes</p>
<p>and now he owes it to the people to right those wrongs</p>
<p>by publicly making this huge apology tour.</p>
<p>So you might&rsquo;ve seen him on,</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s been talking to nearly everyone</p>
<p>about basically how he&rsquo;s just didn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the stupidest man alive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically it.</p>
<p>What are some interesting things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve learned from those interviews?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve appreciated why you don&rsquo;t talk in that position.</p>
<p>Most people wouldn&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>Most people would listen to their legal counsel</p>
<p>and not talk.</p>
<p>I do not think any lawyer worth their salt</p>
<p>would tell him to talk</p>
<p>because right now I think the danger of what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s locking himself into a story of how things happened.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that story is gonna hold up</p>
<p>in the coming months</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>from the insider conversations I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>with Alameda Research employees, with FTX employees,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to square what they are telling me</p>
<p>with no incentive to lie</p>
<p>with what SBF is telling me with every incentive to lie,</p>
<p>which is fundamentally that he didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>they were commingling funds.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know they were gambling with customer money</p>
<p>and it was basically this huge mistake</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s Alameda&rsquo;s fault,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t involved in Alameda, a company he owned.</p>
<p>So like a compassionate but hard-hitting gangster</p>
<p>that you are, very recently you interacted with SBF on,</p>
<p>I like how you adjust the suspenders as you&rsquo;re saying this.</p>
<p>You interact on Twitter Spaces with SBF</p>
<p>and really put his feet to the fire</p>
<p>with some hard-hitting questions.</p>
<p>What did you ask</p>
<p>and what did you learn from that interaction?</p>
<p>Sure, I should say first,</p>
<p>this was not a willing interaction.</p>
<p>I mean, I thought that was kind of the funny part of it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been asking him for an interview for a while.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been giving interviews to nearly everyone who wants one,</p>
<p>big channels, small channels.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t give me one,</p>
<p>but I managed to get some by sneaking up</p>
<p>on some Twitter Spaces and DMing the people</p>
<p>and like being like, hey, can I come up?</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t get him to ask everything that I wanted</p>
<p>because he like would leave sometimes,</p>
<p>after I asked some of the questions,</p>
<p>but really what I asked was about this 8 billion</p>
<p>and zooming in on the improbability of his lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like if you run a company</p>
<p>and you know the insides and outs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the top of your field, top in class,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden it all goes bust</p>
<p>and you say, I had no idea how any of this worked.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s like the guy who runs Whataburger</p>
<p>saying, I didn&rsquo;t know where we sourced our beef.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know where we, that&rsquo;s a Texas example, actually.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take it like worldwide, Walmart.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t know we used Chinese manufacturers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>To become Walmart, you have to know</p>
<p>how your supply chain works.</p>
<p>You have to know, even if you&rsquo;re at a high level,</p>
<p>you know how this stuff works.</p>
<p>Can I do a hard turn on that and go as one must to Hitler?</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s writing is not on any of the documents</p>
<p>around, as far as I know, on the final solution.</p>
<p>So in some crazy world, he could theoretically say,</p>
<p>I knew, I didn&rsquo;t know anything about the death camps.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this plausible deniability in theory.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, but that, most people would look at that</p>
<p>and say, eh, it&rsquo;s very unlikely, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Especially if all the insiders are coming out</p>
<p>and saying, no, no, no, of course he knew.</p>
<p>He was directing us from the top.</p>
<p>I mean, what was clear, what&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>about the structure, and like, I love the nitty-gritty.</p>
<p>Sorry, we&rsquo;re back to SPF.</p>
<p>We went to Hitler, now we&rsquo;re back to the SPF.</p>
<p>Sorry, I wanted to turn us as fast as possible</p>
<p>away from Hitler.</p>
<p>So the insiders in what, Alameda Research?</p>
<p>Alameda Research.</p>
<p>What was interesting is that there was this sort</p>
<p>of one-way window going on between Alameda and FTX,</p>
<p>where FTX employees didn&rsquo;t know a lot of what was going on.</p>
<p>Alameda insiders, and I would say by design,</p>
<p>knew almost everything that was going on at FTX.</p>
<p>And so I think that was really interesting</p>
<p>from the perspective of a lot of the so-called,</p>
<p>like what you could, what he&rsquo;s trying to ascribe to</p>
<p>as like failures or mistakes or ignorance and negligence,</p>
<p>when looked at closely, are much more designed</p>
<p>and they sort of don&rsquo;t arise spontaneously.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this thing in banking and trading</p>
<p>where if I run a bank and you run a trading firm,</p>
<p>we need to have informational walls between us</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s huge conflicts of interest that can arise.</p>
<p>So the negligent argument might be that,</p>
<p>oh, we just didn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sort of these dumb kids in the Bahamas,</p>
<p>so we shared information equally.</p>
<p>But when you see a one-way wall,</p>
<p>that starts to look a lot different.</p>
<p>If I have a backend source of looking at,</p>
<p>or sorry, you&rsquo;re the trading firm,</p>
<p>so you have a backend way to look at all my accounts</p>
<p>and I have no idea that you&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>that all of a sudden looks like a much more designed thing.</p>
<p>When it would be plausible,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say going to use another analogy too,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re saying, look, I commingled funds</p>
<p>because I was so bad at corporate structures,</p>
<p>you would expect those companies</p>
<p>to have a very simple corporate structure</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>But what we see with FTX and Alameda</p>
<p>is they had something like 50 companies and subsidiaries</p>
<p>and this impossibly complicated web of corporate activity.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get there by accident.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wake up and go,</p>
<p>oh, I designed like this watch</p>
<p>that ticked a very specific way,</p>
<p>but it was all accidental.</p>
<p>If you really didn&rsquo;t know what you were doing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d end up with a simple structure.</p>
<p>So even just like from a fundamental perspective,</p>
<p>what SPF was doing</p>
<p>and like the activities they were engaging in</p>
<p>were so complicated and purposely designed</p>
<p>to obfuscate what they were doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to subscribe to the negligence argument.</p>
<p>And I wanna quickly say too,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people have honed in on this.</p>
<p>There was insider trading going on</p>
<p>from Alameda&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>where they would know what coins FTX</p>
<p>was going to list on their exchange.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous effect where,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re this legitimate exchange,</p>
<p>you list a coin, the price spikes.</p>
<p>Insiders told me it was a regular practice</p>
<p>for Alameda insiders to know that FTX</p>
<p>was going to list a coin and as a company buy up that coin</p>
<p>so they could sell it after it listed.</p>
<p>And they made millions of dollars.</p>
<p>How do you do that accidentally?</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s illegal.</p>
<p>Totally illegal.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s illegal from like,</p>
<p>and if an individual does it, it&rsquo;s illegal, it&rsquo;s fraud.</p>
<p>What if a company is systematically doing it</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t tell me that FTX</p>
<p>or someone at FTX wasn&rsquo;t feeding that information</p>
<p>to Alameda or somehow giving them keys to know that.</p>
<p>And that would happen at the highest level.</p>
<p>It would happen at SPS level.</p>
<p>And this is why his arguments of,</p>
<p>I was dumb, I was naive, I was sort of ignorant</p>
<p>are so preposterous because he&rsquo;s dumb and ignorant</p>
<p>the second it becomes criminal to be smart</p>
<p>and sophisticated, right?</p>
<p>But then also coming out and talking about it,</p>
<p>which is a-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bizarre move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bizarre and almost a dark move.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of the 8 billion?</p>
<p>You mentioned 8 billion.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the 8 billion?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the missing 8 billion?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sort of like wire fraud.</p>
<p>You sort of, he&rsquo;s sort of copping to like smaller crimes</p>
<p>to avoid the big crime.</p>
<p>The big crime is you knew everything</p>
<p>and you were behind it, right?</p>
<p>The smaller crimes are like a little wire fraud here,</p>
<p>little wire fraud there.</p>
<p>So what the 8 billion is,</p>
<p>is that FTX didn&rsquo;t always have banking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get banking as a crypto exchange.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these questions of like,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the money coming from?</p>
<p>Is it coming from money launderers?</p>
<p>So for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always been hard for exchanges to get bank accounts.</p>
<p>So before when FTX was just getting started,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have a bank account.</p>
<p>So how do you put money on FTX?</p>
<p>Well, they would have you wire your money</p>
<p>to their trading firm.</p>
<p>Their wiring instructions would go to their trading firm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to get banking as a trading firm.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d put your money with the trading firm</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;d credit you the money on FTX.</p>
<p>Okay, first of all,</p>
<p>this is a whole circumvention</p>
<p>of all these banking guidelines and regulations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first like thing that I think is legal.</p>
<p>But basically what SBF argued</p>
<p>is that there was an accounting glitch error problem</p>
<p>where when you&rsquo;d send money to Alameda,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;d credit you on FTX,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t safeguard your deposits.</p>
<p>Like your deposits would go</p>
<p>into what he called a stub account,</p>
<p>which is just like some account that&rsquo;s not very well labeled</p>
<p>kind of like a placeholder account.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t realize that those were Alameda&rsquo;s funds</p>
<p>or they were playing with those funds</p>
<p>and that they basically should have</p>
<p>safeguarded that for customers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his explanation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s preposterous because it&rsquo;s $8 billion, but anyways.</p>
<p>Just poor labeling of accounts.</p>
<p>Of an $8 billion account.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a billion between?</p>
<p>A billion.</p>
<p>I do this all the time in programming.</p>
<p>This is the craziest thing.</p>
<p>Like he was talking to me</p>
<p>and at one point in the conversation, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause he said I didn&rsquo;t have knowledge</p>
<p>of Alameda&rsquo;s accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Forbes a month ago was getting</p>
<p>detailed accounting of Alameda.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he goes,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, that wasn&rsquo;t detailed accounting.</p>
<p>I just knew I was right within 10 billion or so.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is that error margin?</p>
<p>$10 billion for a company that is arguably</p>
<p>never worth more than a hundred million.</p>
<p>Probably never even worth more than 50 billion.</p>
<p>Your error margin is $10 billion.</p>
<p>You have to be,</p>
<p>this is a guy who is sending around statements</p>
<p>that like there was no risk involved.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re telling me he had a error margin</p>
<p>of $10 billion?</p>
<p>That is the difference between like a healthy company</p>
<p>and a company so deep underwater you&rsquo;re going to jail.</p>
<p>So you have to believe that he is impossibly stupid</p>
<p>and square that with the sophistication</p>
<p>that he brought to the table.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an impossible argument.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Do you think he is incompetent, insane, or evil?</p>
<p>If you were to bet money on each of those.</p>
<p>Incompetent, insane, or evil.</p>
<p>Insane meaning he&rsquo;s lying to everyone,</p>
<p>but also to himself,</p>
<p>which is a little bit different than incompetence.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not incompetent.</p>
<p>So the, I think he&rsquo;s some combination of insane and evil,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s impossible to know</p>
<p>unless we know deep inside his heart</p>
<p>how self like diluted he is versus a calculated strategy.</p>
<p>And I think if you look at SBF,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s such a, I think he&rsquo;s a fascinating individual.</p>
<p>Just, I mean, you know, he&rsquo;s a horrible human being.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start there.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s also somewhat interesting</p>
<p>from a psychology perspective,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very open about the fact</p>
<p>that he understands image</p>
<p>and he understands how to cultivate image,</p>
<p>the importance of image,</p>
<p>so well that I think a lot of people,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;ve talked about it,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t emphasizing that enough when interacting with him.</p>
<p>This is a man whose entire history</p>
<p>is about cultivating the right opinions</p>
<p>at the right time to achieve the right effect.</p>
<p>Why do you think he would suddenly change that approach</p>
<p>when he has all the more reason to cultivate an image?</p>
<p>So he is extremely good naturally or-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s good, but he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a hyper aware.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s deliberate in cultivating a public image</p>
<p>and controlling the public image.</p>
<p>You know about the like Democrat donations.</p>
<p>Like he knew to donate to the right people, $40 million.</p>
<p>He says on a call that we released with Tiffany Fong,</p>
<p>he says on a call that he donated</p>
<p>the same amount to Republicans.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s speculation on whether this is true</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a liar or whatever.</p>
<p>So caveat there.</p>
<p>But he said he donated to Republicans the same amount,</p>
<p>but he donated dark</p>
<p>because he knew that most journalists are liberal</p>
<p>and they would kind of hold that against him.</p>
<p>So he wanted all the sides to be in his favor,</p>
<p>in his pocket,</p>
<p>while simultaneously understanding</p>
<p>the entire media landscape and playing them like a fiddle</p>
<p>by cultivating this image of I&rsquo;m this progressive,</p>
<p>woke billionaire who wants to give it all away,</p>
<p>do everything for charity.</p>
<p>I drive a Corolla while living in a million dollar</p>
<p>penthouse, multimillion.</p>
<p>But that was sort of the angle.</p>
<p>He understood so well how to play the media.</p>
<p>And I think he underestimated when he did this,</p>
<p>how much people would put him under a deeper microscope.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think he has achieved the same level of success</p>
<p>in cultivating this new image,</p>
<p>because I think people are so skeptical now,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s buying it.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s trying it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing it to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>But it has worked leading up</p>
<p>to this particular wobbly situation.</p>
<p>So before that, wasn&rsquo;t there a public perception</p>
<p>of him being a force for good, a financial force for good?</p>
<p>100%, yeah.</p>
<p>Somebody from Sequoia Capital wrote this glowing review</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s gonna be the world&rsquo;s first trillionaire.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many pieces done on,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the most generous billionaire in the world,</p>
<p>that he was sort of like the steel man of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to make tons of money.</p>
<p>This is like the effective altruism movement,</p>
<p>make as much money as you can, as fast as you can,</p>
<p>and then give it all away.</p>
<p>And he was sort of like the poster child for that.</p>
<p>And he did give some of it away and got a lot of press</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>And I think that was kind of by design.</p>
<p>I wanna address a real quick point.</p>
<p>A lot of people have said that Binance played a role.</p>
<p>And while they catalyzed this,</p>
<p>insolvency is a problem</p>
<p>that will eventually manifest either way.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t put any blame on CZ</p>
<p>for basically causing this meltdown.</p>
<p>The underlying foundation was unstable</p>
<p>and it was gonna fall apart at the next push.</p>
<p>He just happened to be the final,</p>
<p>kind of like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Yeah, the catalyst that revealed the fraud.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s culpable</p>
<p>for FTX&rsquo;s malfeasance in how they handled accounts,</p>
<p>if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So what role did they play?</p>
<p>Could they have helped alleviate some of the pain</p>
<p>of investors, of people that held funds there?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, probably, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would see some kind of weird obligation,</p>
<p>like with the 2 billion they made on FTX.</p>
<p>Remember, they got 2 billion, some of it in cash,</p>
<p>some of it in FTT tokens.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much actual cash they have from that deal,</p>
<p>but they have billions from the success</p>
<p>of what seems to be a fraud.</p>
<p>It seems to have been a fraud from early on.</p>
<p>They had the backdoor as early as 2020,</p>
<p>from what I can tell.</p>
<p>So the backdoor between FTX and Alameda Research.</p>
<p>Do you think CZ saw through who SPF is?</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s doing?</p>
<p>No, I think CZ is like, he&rsquo;s a shark.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s good at building a big business.</p>
<p>Like a good shark or a bad shark?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think sharks just eat.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think-</p>
<p>My relationship with shark has, like finding Nemo,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a shark in that.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos is a shark.</p>
<p>So whether people have loaded connotations</p>
<p>of like how they feel about Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>I mean, I would say like,</p>
<p>I think CZ is a ruthless businessman.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s cold, he&rsquo;s calculated, he&rsquo;s very deliberate.</p>
<p>And I think what he should do in this position</p>
<p>is forfeit the funds that he profited from that investment,</p>
<p>because largely I think it was, it&rsquo;s owed to the customers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much hurting out there.</p>
<p>So I think they could do a lot of good around that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they will,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if he sees it in his best interest.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably how he&rsquo;s thinking.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think they could have helped</p>
<p>or they could still help there.</p>
<p>Who do you think suffered the most from this so far?</p>
<p>The little account holders.</p>
<p>This is always true.</p>
<p>So one of the big temptations with fraud,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of scams, frauds,</p>
<p>is everyone looks at the big number.</p>
<p>Everyone, that&rsquo;s the headline, billions of dollars,</p>
<p>the top 50 creditors, what everyone thinks at first.</p>
<p>But quickly, when you dig down,</p>
<p>you realize that most people who lost $10 million,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s terrible for them.</p>
<p>I wish them to get their money back,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s usually the people with like 50,000 or less</p>
<p>that are most impacted.</p>
<p>Usually they do not have the money to spare.</p>
<p>Usually they&rsquo;re not diversified in a sophisticated way.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s those people.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the small account holders</p>
<p>that I feel the worst for.</p>
<p>And unfortunately,</p>
<p>they often get the least press time or air time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the really difficult truth of this</p>
<p>is that, especially in the culture of cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of young people who are not diversified.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically all in on a particular crypto.</p>
<p>And it just breaks my heart to think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s somebody with 50,000 or 30,000 or 20,000,</p>
<p>but the point is that money is everything they own.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And now-</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>Life is basically destroyed.</p>
<p>Like, you know, imagine you&rsquo;re 18, 19, 20, 21 years old.</p>
<p>You saved up, you&rsquo;ve been working, you saved up,</p>
<p>and this is it.</p>
<p>This is basically destroying a life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so brutal about this is that</p>
<p>this all comes on the back.</p>
<p>The entire crypto market comes on the back of,</p>
<p>comes from the deep distrust of traditional finance.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Everybody lost trust in the banking systems.</p>
<p>And they lost trust that if those banking systems</p>
<p>acted in a corrupt way,</p>
<p>that they would receive the justice.</p>
<p>It turned out that the banks received favorable treatment,</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So people lost faith in the structure</p>
<p>of our financial system in a way that is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still feeling the reverberations of it.</p>
<p>And so when crypto came along,</p>
<p>it was like kind of this way to reinvent the wheel,</p>
<p>reinvent the world for the like sort of lowly</p>
<p>and the like less powerful</p>
<p>and kind of level the playing field.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s so sad about events like this</p>
<p>is you see that fundamentally</p>
<p>a lot of the power structures are the same</p>
<p>where the people at the top</p>
<p>face little repercussions for what they do.</p>
<p>The people at the bottom are still getting screwed.</p>
<p>The people at the bottom are still getting lied to.</p>
<p>And law enforcement is way behind the ball.</p>
<p>Do you think this really damaged people trust</p>
<p>in cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>For sure, way bigger than Luna,</p>
<p>way bigger than Three Arrows Capital.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of who SBF was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the dollar figure behind it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because he wooed so many of our media elites</p>
<p>who should have been calling him out</p>
<p>or at least investigating him and not rubber stamping him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an indictment of our financial system,</p>
<p>even our most sophisticated people in BlackRock,</p>
<p>in Sequoia, who didn&rsquo;t see this coming,</p>
<p>who also rubber stamped him.</p>
<p>And you just wonder like,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t trust the top people in crypto</p>
<p>who are supposedly the good guys,</p>
<p>the guys saving crypto,</p>
<p>just a month ago or two months ago,</p>
<p>he was the guy on Capitol Hill</p>
<p>that was talking to Gary Gensler,</p>
<p>to all the top people in Washington.</p>
<p>He was orchestrating the regulation of crypto.</p>
<p>If that guy is a complete fraudster, liar, psychopath,</p>
<p>and nobody knew it until it was too late,</p>
<p>what does that mean about the system itself</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re building?</p>
<p>So you are one of, if not the best,</p>
<p>like fraudster investigators in the world.</p>
<p>Did you sense, was this on your radar at all,</p>
<p>SBF, over the past couple of years?</p>
<p>Were any red flags going off for you?</p>
<p>Yes, so funny enough,</p>
<p>like one of my videos from six months ago or so blew up</p>
<p>because I gotta give a lot of credit to Matt Levine</p>
<p>of Bloomberg, great journalist, great finance journalist.</p>
<p>And I wanna say, when I like talk about media elite,</p>
<p>there are people doing great work</p>
<p>in these mainstream institutions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a monolith, just like independent media</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t all doing great work</p>
<p>and all the corporate media is bad or whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like these overarching narratives</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t subscribe to.</p>
<p>So Matt Levine&rsquo;s a great journalist.</p>
<p>He did an interview with SBF where he got Sam</p>
<p>to basically describe a lot of what was going on in DeFi,</p>
<p>but it kind of a larger philosophy around crypto.</p>
<p>And he described a Ponzi scheme</p>
<p>where he just described this black box.</p>
<p>It does nothing, but if we ascribe it value,</p>
<p>then we can create more value and more value and more value.</p>
<p>And it kind of was this ridiculous description</p>
<p>of a Ponzi scheme, but there was no moral judgment on it.</p>
<p>It was like, oh yeah, this is great.</p>
<p>We can make a lot of money from this.</p>
<p>And Matt is like, well,</p>
<p>it sounds like you&rsquo;re in the Ponzi business</p>
<p>and business is good.</p>
<p>I made a video about that.</p>
<p>I said, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is absurd, whatever, it&rsquo;s obscene.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t explicitly call SBF a fraud there.</p>
<p>And I think if I&rsquo;m being, I think I saw some of it,</p>
<p>but like many people, I think a lot of us were kind of like,</p>
<p>I think a lot of us missed how wrong everyone could be</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>I did notice leading up to the crash, what was happening.</p>
<p>And I called it out a day or a day and a half</p>
<p>before it happened.</p>
<p>Cause I saw my friend&rsquo;s post, Dirty Bubble Media.</p>
<p>And this was the first real look</p>
<p>into the heart of their finances.</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re this black box.</p>
<p>You just kind of had to evaluate them without knowing much.</p>
<p>And once we got a peek under the hood</p>
<p>of what their finances were, I realized, oh my gosh,</p>
<p>these guys might be completely insolvent.</p>
<p>So I made a tweet about it.</p>
<p>I hope some people saw it and got their money out.</p>
<p>But pretty quickly after that,</p>
<p>I caught the narrative of what was really going on</p>
<p>at Alameda, that it was basically this Ponzi scheme</p>
<p>that they had built.</p>
<p>Do you ever sit like Batman in the dark</p>
<p>since he fight crime and wonder, like sad,</p>
<p>just staring into the darkness and thinking,</p>
<p>I should have caught this earlier?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think.</p>
<p>In your $10 billion, $10 million, $10 million.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working our way there.</p>
<p>With a bunch of cocaine on the table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never enough.</p>
<p>Like you always could be catching stuff sooner.</p>
<p>You always could be doing more.</p>
<p>The fascinating thing you said is that</p>
<p>one of the lessons here is that a large number of people,</p>
<p>influential, smart people,</p>
<p>could all be wrong at the same time</p>
<p>in terms of their evaluation of SBF.</p>
<p>This is one thing that I don&rsquo;t understand too,</p>
<p>is I think it&rsquo;s one thing to not see something.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s another thing to rubber stamp</p>
<p>or explicitly endorse.</p>
<p>I feel like a lot of people didn&rsquo;t look too close</p>
<p>because I think a lot of the warning signs were there.</p>
<p>But my feeling is if you&rsquo;re a Sequoia,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a BlackRock,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you do that due diligence?</p>
<p>I mean, like before just endorsing something,</p>
<p>especially in the crypto space,</p>
<p>this is just why I don&rsquo;t do any deals</p>
<p>in the crypto space ever.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s impossible to know</p>
<p>which ones are gonna be the big hits</p>
<p>or the big frauds or whatever.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re gonna make that bet,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make that play,</p>
<p>you would think that you would do</p>
<p>all the research in the world</p>
<p>and you would get sophisticated looks at their liabilities,</p>
<p>at how they were structured, all that stuff.</p>
<p>And that is the most shocking part</p>
<p>is not that people missed it because you can miss fraud,</p>
<p>but that there were so many glowing endorsements</p>
<p>like this guy is not gonna be that thing.</p>
<p>We explicitly endorse him.</p>
<p>I saw a Fortune magazine.</p>
<p>He was called the next Warren Buffett.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just crazy.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to have enough like Tom Brady endorsements</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t really investigate?</p>
<p>So like, that there&rsquo;s a kind of momentum,</p>
<p>like societal social momentum.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>I actually think that&rsquo;s hugely a blind spot of our society</p>
<p>is we have all these heuristics</p>
<p>that can be points of failure,</p>
<p>where like a rule of thumb is if you go to an Ivy League,</p>
<p>well, you must be smart, right?</p>
<p>A rule of thumb is if you&rsquo;re both your parents</p>
<p>are Harvard lawyers, you must know the law.</p>
<p>You must like kind of be sophisticated.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re running a billion dollar exchange,</p>
<p>you must be somehow somewhat ethical, right?</p>
<p>And all of these heuristics can lead to giant blind spots</p>
<p>where you kind of just go, oh, we&rsquo;ll check.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of energy to look into people.</p>
<p>And if enough of those rules of thumb are met,</p>
<p>we just kind of check them off</p>
<p>and put them through the system.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s been hugely exposing</p>
<p>for sort of like our blind spot.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know maybe how to look in.</p>
<p>For example, there&rsquo;s a few assumptions.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a lot of people are very skeptical</p>
<p>of institutions of government and so on,</p>
<p>but perhaps too much so.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But for some part of history,</p>
<p>there was too much faith in government.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so right now I think there&rsquo;s faith</p>
<p>in certain large companies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s distrust in certain ones and trust in others.</p>
<p>Like people seem to distrust Facebook,</p>
<p>extremely skeptical of Facebook,</p>
<p>but they trust, I think, Google with their data.</p>
<p>I think they trust Apple with their data.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Much more so.</p>
<p>Like search, people don&rsquo;t seem to be Google search.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m just gonna, I&rsquo;m gonna-</p>
<p>Put it in there.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked at your Google search history?</p>
<p>Your Google search history has gotta be</p>
<p>some of the darkest things.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever looked</p>
<p>at my Google search history.</p>
<p>You should.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty careful with like browser hygiene</p>
<p>and stuff like that because I think it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Well, Google search history,</p>
<p>unless you explicitly delete, is there.</p>
<p>I recommend you look at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Look, because it goes back to the first days</p>
<p>of you using Google search history.</p>
<p>Fun fact actually about that.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I am aware of that.</p>
<p>I just mean for like certain sensitive topics</p>
<p>where like I&rsquo;m investigating some fraud</p>
<p>and I go sign into their website, right?</p>
<p>Log in.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t use like a traditional browser.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use a VPN and I&rsquo;ll like put it on like Brave</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>You log in, you create an account as Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You start.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>You mentioned effective altruism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know, SBF has been associated</p>
<p>with this effective altruism,</p>
<p>which made me look twice at EA and see like, wait.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>Was this used by SBF to give himself a good public image</p>
<p>or is there something about effective altruism</p>
<p>that makes it easy to misuse by bad people?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>He could have endorsed a wide range of philosophies.</p>
<p>And I guess you just have to wonder are all those,</p>
<p>would those philosophies also be tainted</p>
<p>if he had gone bad?</p>
<p>I guess effective altruism is sort of unique</p>
<p>because he used it as part of his brand.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like he described himself as a consequentialist</p>
<p>and like that ended up mattering.</p>
<p>It was like he described himself as an effective altruist</p>
<p>and he used that part of the brand to lift himself up.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s getting so much scrutiny.</p>
<p>I think the merits of it should speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t personally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not personally an effective altruist.</p>
<p>I personally am motivated by giving in part emotionally.</p>
<p>And for some reason that I can&rsquo;t exactly describe,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s somewhat important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you should detach giving</p>
<p>from some personal connection.</p>
<p>I find trouble with that.</p>
<p>And like I said, it&rsquo;s for reasons I can&rsquo;t describe</p>
<p>because effective altruism is sort of the most logical</p>
<p>ivory tower position you could possibly take.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like strip all humanity away from giving,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s treat it like a business.</p>
<p>And how many people can we serve</p>
<p>through the McDonald&rsquo;s line of charity</p>
<p>for like the dollar, right?</p>
<p>I just personally don&rsquo;t resonate with that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think the entire movement</p>
<p>is like indicted because of it.</p>
<p>Typically, most people who care about giving and charity</p>
<p>on the whole are nice people and are,</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t speak for the whole movement.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t think SBF indicts the whole movement,</p>
<p>even though I personally don&rsquo;t subscribe to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it made me pause, reflect and step back</p>
<p>like about the movement and about anything</p>
<p>that has a strong ideology.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s anything in your life</p>
<p>that has a strong set of ideas behind it, be careful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, look, I kind of feel like what it teaches me</p>
<p>and what I kind of think about when I think about systems</p>
<p>is that no system saves you from the individual.</p>
<p>No system saves you from the individual,</p>
<p>their intentions, their lust for power or greed.</p>
<p>I mean, I think one of the great ideas</p>
<p>is the decentralization of power.</p>
<p>And like, this is why I think democracies are so great</p>
<p>is because they decentralize power</p>
<p>across a wide range of like interests and groups</p>
<p>and that being an effective way to kind of try as best</p>
<p>as you can to spread out the impact of one individual</p>
<p>because one bad individual can do a lot of harm.</p>
<p>I mean, clearly as seen here.</p>
<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t think it has anything to do with ideology</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not like being an effective altruist</p>
<p>made Sam Bankman free to fraud.</p>
<p>He was a fraud who happened to be an effective altruist.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>So there is something about, yes,</p>
<p>no system protects you from an individual,</p>
<p>but some system enable or serve as a better catalyst</p>
<p>than others for the worst aspects of human nature.</p>
<p>So for example, communist ideology,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the ideology</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s implementation in the 20th century.</p>
<p>It seemed like such a sexy and powerful and viral ideology</p>
<p>that it somehow allows the evil bad people</p>
<p>to like sneak into the very top.</p>
<p>And so like, that&rsquo;s what I mean about certain ideas</p>
<p>sound so nice that allow you like the lower classes,</p>
<p>the workers, the people that do all the work,</p>
<p>they should have power.</p>
<p>They have been screwed over for far too long.</p>
<p>They need to take power back.</p>
<p>That sounds like a really powerful idea.</p>
<p>And then it just seems like with those powerful ideas,</p>
<p>evil people sneak in to the top</p>
<p>and start to abuse that power.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, I mean, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of</p>
<p>probably big brain political takes,</p>
<p>but what I can say is that you can never get away</p>
<p>from both the system and the individual mattering.</p>
<p>For sure, some systems incentivize some behaviors</p>
<p>in certain ways, but some people will take that and go,</p>
<p>okay, all we need to do is design the perfect system.</p>
<p>And then these individuals will act completely rationally</p>
<p>or responsibly in accordance to what our incentives say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>You could also say, all we have to do</p>
<p>is focus on the individual.</p>
<p>And all we have to do is just create a society</p>
<p>which raises very well-adjusted people.</p>
<p>And then we can throw them into any system</p>
<p>with any incentives and they will act like responsibly,</p>
<p>ethically, morally.</p>
<p>And I also don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So incentives are real,</p>
<p>but also the individual ultimately plays a large role too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I come down sort of in the middle there.</p>
<p>And some of that is just accidents of history too,</p>
<p>which individuals finds which system, you know.</p>
<p>You become the face of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, with FTX versus Coinbase versus Binance,</p>
<p>which individual, which kinds of ideas</p>
<p>and life story come to power.</p>
<p>That matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating that history turns</p>
<p>in these small little events done</p>
<p>by small little individuals that, you know,</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s a failed artist or you have FDR</p>
<p>or you have all these different characters</p>
<p>that do good or do evil onto the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like single individuals and they have a life story</p>
<p>and it could have turned out completely different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s the flap of the butterfly wings.</p>
<p>So yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We should be skeptical as attributing too much</p>
<p>to the system or the individual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all like a beautiful mess.</p>
<p>The Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, that was like a Lex line.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard quite a few episodes</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like such a Lex line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful mess.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Beautifully said.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m a fan of the show.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>I love you too.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Can you think of possible trajectories</p>
<p>how this FTX, SBF saga ends?</p>
<p>And which one do you hope for?</p>
<p>Do you hope that SBF goes to jail?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the individual.</p>
<p>And in terms of the investors and the customers,</p>
<p>what do you hope happens?</p>
<p>And what do you think are the possible things</p>
<p>that can happen?</p>
<p>So A, yeah, I definitely think SBF should go to jail</p>
<p>for nothing else for a semblance of justice,</p>
<p>the facsimile of justice to occur for all the investors.</p>
<p>I also think there are people probably several steps</p>
<p>down the chain that probably knew</p>
<p>at least Caroline Ellison.</p>
<p>You can have questions about sort of their,</p>
<p>Dan Friedberg, who I&rsquo;d love to talk about as well.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people in that room who I think knew.</p>
<p>I think we do so much of like the one guy is all to blame.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s throw everything at him</p>
<p>when clearly this was a company wide issue.</p>
<p>So everyone who knew, I think should face</p>
<p>the same punishment, which I think should be jail</p>
<p>for all of those people.</p>
<p>In part to send a signal to anybody</p>
<p>that tries this kind of stuff in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the big things that you saw,</p>
<p>like, okay, take a microcosm of all of this action</p>
<p>and just look at like the influencer space, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of deals that were done</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve covered ad nauseum about influencer finds out</p>
<p>they can make a lot of money selling a crypto coin.</p>
<p>The first thing they wonder is, am I gonna get caught?</p>
<p>If I do this, is there a consequence?</p>
<p>And if the answer is no, then it&rsquo;s a pretty easy decision</p>
<p>as long as you don&rsquo;t like have any moral scruples about it</p>
<p>which apparently none of them did</p>
<p>or a lot of them didn&rsquo;t, I should say.</p>
<p>So as soon as somebody steps in and regulates</p>
<p>that math changes and all of a sudden</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a self-interest reason to not go do the bad thing.</p>
<p>So for example, and I can give a concrete example of this.</p>
<p>There was a NFT, the first ever NFT</p>
<p>sort of like official indictment</p>
<p>or the DOJ released this press release</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re charging these guys who ran a NFT project</p>
<p>that they didn&rsquo;t follow through on their promises.</p>
<p>They made all these promises, lied</p>
<p>and then ran away with the money.</p>
<p>First ever consequence for anyone in the NFT space.</p>
<p>That day that that press release came out,</p>
<p>I saw several NFT projects come back to life from the dead.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because all those founders are freaking out</p>
<p>and they realized we scammed people.</p>
<p>We have to go at least make it look like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing the right thing, right?</p>
<p>Even just, so that&rsquo;s on the optic side</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also tons of people who now go,</p>
<p>oh, basically law enforcement is on the scene.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do the same thing.</p>
<p>So there is a very pragmatic reason for this punishment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much just because people work it into their math</p>
<p>of should I commit fraud?</p>
<p>And the last several years have been very,</p>
<p>sort of been like a little bit of a nihilistic landscape</p>
<p>where no one was getting punished.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this question of you&rsquo;re almost an idiot</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t take the deals.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s really important, extremely important</p>
<p>for kind of law enforcement to play a role,</p>
<p>regulation to play a role,</p>
<p>to make it harder to commit those crimes.</p>
<p>And if you commit those crimes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actual real world punishment for it.</p>
<p>Your point about like what&rsquo;s gonna happen to the investors.</p>
<p>I think that was kind of your question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough because if the money&rsquo;s not there,</p>
<p>the money&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s gonna be the guy,</p>
<p>they got the best in class guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the guy who ran the dissolving of Enron.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I can&rsquo;t imagine someone better equipped</p>
<p>to run a complicated corporate fraud like dissolution.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s tough</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s gonna get probably, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>10 cents on the dollar, maybe less.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>to do a progressive redistribution of funds.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just really worried about the pain</p>
<p>that small investors feel.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of thought around that.</p>
<p>I forget if they actually do do this.</p>
<p>I mean, I know there&rsquo;s a lot of law</p>
<p>about like you can&rsquo;t treat creditors differently.</p>
<p>You have to treat them all the same.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;ll be some kind of proportional payback.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not gonna be</p>
<p>that the guys at the top get a significant amount</p>
<p>of their money back and the rest get nothing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think there&rsquo;s such a small amount</p>
<p>of assets that back this whole thing in the end.</p>
<p>And that value is actually declining every day</p>
<p>because it was inextricably tied to FBF.</p>
<p>It was like the FTT tokens, which now what are those worth?</p>
<p>The serum tokens, that was his project</p>
<p>or the project they made.</p>
<p>What is that worth?</p>
<p>Basically nothing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a hard situation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bigger ethical concern, which is FTX US,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear how backed it was,</p>
<p>but it was clearly more backed than FTX International.</p>
<p>Do you take all that money and throw it into a big pot</p>
<p>and give people money back?</p>
<p>Or do you give the US people back their amount of money,</p>
<p>which is probably gonna be significantly more</p>
<p>and leave everyone internationally out in the cold?</p>
<p>And to add to that ethical issue,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a liquidator and you&rsquo;re US-based.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous question, like legal questions about,</p>
<p>how do you ethically do that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous incentive to just favor the US people</p>
<p>over everyone else,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s our country, America, whatever.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s necessarily fair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>And some, I forget where you said this,</p>
<p>but one of the, I mean,</p>
<p>it probably permeates a lot of the investigations you do,</p>
<p>which is this idea that it&rsquo;s really sad</p>
<p>that the middle-class in most situations like this</p>
<p>get fucked over.</p>
<p>So the IRS go after the middle-class,</p>
<p>then go after the rich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically everyone who doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of leverage</p>
<p>in terms of lawyers, money, get fucked over.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re the ones,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s always the rich and powerful</p>
<p>who get the favorable treatment</p>
<p>as like a microcosm of this funny story.</p>
<p>So one of the big criticisms of crypto,</p>
<p>and I think rightly so,</p>
<p>is the irreversibility of the transaction.</p>
<p>So if I accidentally send a transaction somewhere,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gone, right?</p>
<p>So crypto.com accidentally sent a lady $10 million,</p>
<p>and now they want the money back and they&rsquo;re suing her.</p>
<p>But the funny thing is,</p>
<p>is if you are on crypto.com and you send,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I accidentally send you money</p>
<p>and I come knocking on your door,</p>
<p>Lex, I didn&rsquo;t mean to send you like $1,000,</p>
<p>I need my money back.</p>
<p>Or if I go to crypto.com and I said,</p>
<p>hey, I sent that to the wrong person, can you reverse it?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, screw off, no way.</p>
<p>If I go to court, they&rsquo;ll kill me in court</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna go,</p>
<p>look, this is how the blockchain works.</p>
<p>But then they do it, they do the exact same thing.</p>
<p>They send this lady $10 million,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re suing her and they&rsquo;re gonna win.</p>
<p>Now what&rsquo;s in court is not whether</p>
<p>they get the money back,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s should she be liable for theft, I believe.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s just another case of</p>
<p>the same rules apply differently to different people,</p>
<p>whether you have the money to back you or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very sad thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think people like,</p>
<p>you need journalists fighting for the little person.</p>
<p>We really need it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like this unfortunate thing</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s the most risky thing to do,</p>
<p>like legally, you should not be doing that,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s important to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ethical thing, it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>What do you think about influencers and celebrities</p>
<p>that supported FTX and SBF?</p>
<p>Do they, should they be punished?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they should take a huge reputational hit.</p>
<p>I mean, I think they should be embarrassed.</p>
<p>I think they should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>But it was really hard to know, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>for them to know, like for example,</p>
<p>I think about this a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who do I, because I don&rsquo;t investigate,</p>
<p>like sponsored by Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s a nutritional drink.</p>
<p>Should I investigate them deeply?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You just kind of use reputational,</p>
<p>like it seems to work for me.</p>
<p>Should I like-</p>
<p>I think it really depends on,</p>
<p>I think your credibility hit will depend</p>
<p>on what domain you&rsquo;re an expert in.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sponsored by a robotics company</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re an expert in robotics,</p>
<p>if that company turns out to be a disaster and a fraud,</p>
<p>then you should have looked more deeply.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking mostly about,</p>
<p>like I hold Tom Brady a lot less accountable</p>
<p>than financial advisors, financial influencers,</p>
<p>because that is their world of expertise.</p>
<p>And you treat their recommendation differently,</p>
<p>proportionally to what you think their expertise is.</p>
<p>So in some ways, I don&rsquo;t actually think,</p>
<p>Tom Brady, I&rsquo;m sure he reached a lot of people.</p>
<p>I personally didn&rsquo;t feel at all moved by his recommendation</p>
<p>because you know, it&rsquo;s just money.</p>
<p>But when you hear somebody who should be an expert</p>
<p>in that thing, endorse a product in that space,</p>
<p>you hold that opinion to a higher standard.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re completely cataclysmically wrong,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a different level of accountability.</p>
<p>And I think rightfully so.</p>
<p>When Jim Cramer was saying Bear Stearns is fine,</p>
<p>he made that terrible call with Bear Stearns in 2008.</p>
<p>He was rightfully reamed for all of that.</p>
<p>Even though it could be considered that like,</p>
<p>well, you know, did he have all the information?</p>
<p>Maybe not, but he&rsquo;s a financial advisor.</p>
<p>He does this for a living.</p>
<p>If you go on and you make a big call</p>
<p>and you turn out to be wrong and people lose tons of money,</p>
<p>you are going to take a hit, and I think rightfully so.</p>
<p>But no, I don&rsquo;t think these people should go to jail</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s such a complicated thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I just feel it personally myself.</p>
<p>I get it, but you still feel the burden</p>
<p>of the fact that your opinion has influence.</p>
<p>I know it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I know Tom Brady&rsquo;s opinion on financial investment</p>
<p>should not have influence, but it does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the reality of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real burden.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know anything about SBF or FTX.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t on my radar at all.</p>
<p>But I could have seen myself taking them on as a sponsor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people I respect, Sam Harris and others,</p>
<p>like talk with SBF like he&rsquo;s doing good for the world.</p>
<p>So I could see myself being hoodwinked,</p>
<p>having not done research.</p>
<p>And the same thing, it makes me wonder.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t want to become cynical, man.</p>
<p>But it makes you wonder, who are the people in your life</p>
<p>you trust that are like, that could be the next SBF</p>
<p>or worse, big, powerful leaders,</p>
<p>Hitler and all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>To what degree do you want to investigate?</p>
<p>Do you want to hold their feet to the fire,</p>
<p>see through their bullshit, call them on their bullshit?</p>
<p>And also, as a friend, if you happen to be friends,</p>
<p>or have a connection, how to help them</p>
<p>not slip into the land of fraud?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, all of that is just overwhelming.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we should be clear.</p>
<p>Like, finance is sort of a special space</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re talking about people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not talking about whether</p>
<p>someone takes a bad supplement,</p>
<p>or like a supplement that is just, they&rsquo;re $50 out, right?</p>
<p>I think the scale of harm, and therefore responsibility,</p>
<p>escalates depending on what field you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t hold Tom Brady as,</p>
<p>like if he gives a bad football opinion, right,</p>
<p>and he should have known better,</p>
<p>that is a different scale of harm</p>
<p>than a doctor giving bad advice, right?</p>
<p>Like, he tells you a pill works,</p>
<p>and the pill kills you, or something like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just different levels of accountability</p>
<p>depending on the field you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>and you have to be aware of it.</p>
<p>Finance is, you have to be extremely conservative</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna give financial advice,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re playing with people&rsquo;s lives,</p>
<p>and you cannot play with them haphazardly,</p>
<p>you cannot gamble with them,</p>
<p>you cannot play with them on a bet,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting paid a lot of money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the nature of the space,</p>
<p>and so with the space comes the responsibility,</p>
<p>and the accountability,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think you can get around that.</p>
<p>Who was Dan Friedberg that you mentioned?</p>
<p>Some of these figures in the SBF realm</p>
<p>that are interesting to you.</p>
<p>Super interesting kind of subject,</p>
<p>because Dan Friedberg is the former general counsel</p>
<p>for Ultimate Bet.</p>
<p>Ultimate Bet was a poker site</p>
<p>where famously they got in a scandal</p>
<p>because the owner, Russ Hamilton,</p>
<p>was cheating with a little software piece of code</p>
<p>they called God Mode.</p>
<p>God Mode allowed you to see the guy across from you&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can imagine you can win pretty consistently</p>
<p>if you know exactly what your opponent has.</p>
<p>Very unethical.</p>
<p>I should be clear that for some inexplicable reason,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they were ever charged</p>
<p>and convicted of a crime,</p>
<p>but they were investigated by a gambling commission</p>
<p>that found they made tens of millions of dollars this way.</p>
<p>For sure, and Dan Friedberg is the general counsel.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s caught on a call basically conspiring with Russ</p>
<p>to hide this fraud.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying we should blame it on a consultant,</p>
<p>third party, and Russ Hamilton famously says,</p>
<p>it was me, I did it, I don&rsquo;t wanna give the money back.</p>
<p>Find basically a way to get rid of this.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Dan Friedberg&rsquo;s big achievement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s known for, he&rsquo;s most known for.</p>
<p>And this is the guy they pick</p>
<p>as their chief regulatory officer for FTX.</p>
<p>Why do you hire somebody who, I get it,</p>
<p>not formally charged and convicted, investigated,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all the, and there&rsquo;s tape out there.</p>
<p>So I wanna be clear about what&rsquo;s actually available evidence</p>
<p>but someone who&rsquo;s seemingly only achievement</p>
<p>is hiding fraud, why do you hire that guy</p>
<p>if the intention is not to hide fraud?</p>
<p>So this is a question I put to Sam Bankman Fried</p>
<p>and his answer was, well, we have a lot of lawyers.</p>
<p>And I said, well, it&rsquo;s your chief regulatory officer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, it wasn&rsquo;t, we did regulate a lot.</p>
<p>And it was just this big dance of basically</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s done great work, he&rsquo;s a great guy.</p>
<p>And I think that tells you everything you need to know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s figures like that probably</p>
<p>even at the lower levels,</p>
<p>just infiltrate the entire organization.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just like, yeah, why wasn&rsquo;t there a CFA?</p>
<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t there anyone in that space</p>
<p>who could seemingly be the eyes that goes,</p>
<p>holy whatever, we need to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in dangerous territory here, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, it seems very deliberate.</p>
<p>I mean, I talked to one FTX employee that they talked about</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s told me they talked about taking,</p>
<p>I think it was taking FTX US public</p>
<p>and Sam was very against the idea.</p>
<p>And the employee in retrospect speculated</p>
<p>that it might&rsquo;ve been because you face so much scrutiny,</p>
<p>like regulation-wise, like you&rsquo;d have to go through a lot,</p>
<p>like more thorough audits, all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>that basically he knew they would never pass.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s red flags all the way down</p>
<p>with that guy.</p>
<p>And you hope all of them get punished.</p>
<p>Everyone who knew, I mean, I think for sure</p>
<p>there are people at FTX who didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think there are some people at Alameda who didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s degrees, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s degrees of not knowing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a looking away when you kind of know shady stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still the same as knowing, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s might be even worse.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, like I was talking to one insider</p>
<p>and we were talking about the insider trading.</p>
<p>They were telling me about this insider trading.</p>
<p>And I said, do you think this was criminal?</p>
<p>And they said, it was probably criminal in hindsight, yes.</p>
<p>And the question is someone who answers a question</p>
<p>like that, what does that like mean?</p>
<p>You know, like it was probably criminal.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right, there are different degrees.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll say at the most basic, I would be very happy</p>
<p>if everyone who had direct knowledge went to jail,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think will happen to be clear.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are gonna cut deals.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are gonna cut deals.</p>
<p>So they actually nail Sam Bankman Freed.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s their only focus.</p>
<p>What about his reputation?</p>
<p>What do you think about all these interviews?</p>
<p>Do you think they are helping him?</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;re good for the world?</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;re bad for the world?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>And like, say you get to sit down,</p>
<p>interview with him for three hours,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m holding the door closed.</p>
<p>What kind, is that a useful conversation or not?</p>
<p>Or at this point, it should be legal and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s all about how you interview him.</p>
<p>You can interview someone responsibly.</p>
<p>You can interview him irresponsibly.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve seen examples of both.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an irresponsible?</p>
<p>I keep interrupting you rudely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay, no, no, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unacceptable.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I think it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>There was like a New York Times interview,</p>
<p>which spends any amount of time talking about his sleep.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yeah, I&rsquo;m sleeping great.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s so deeply disrespectful</p>
<p>to the victims.</p>
<p>And especially when you&rsquo;re not even releasing</p>
<p>an interview live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you have time to triage</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re gonna talk about.</p>
<p>Why would you spend any amount of time</p>
<p>talking about the sleep that a fraudster is getting?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so weird.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Well, can I steal a man in that case?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it turned out well.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>I think, okay, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I could see myself talking about somebody&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>or getting in somebody&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>if I knew I have unlimited time with them.</p>
<p>If I knew I had like four hours.</p>
<p>Because you get into the mind of the person,</p>
<p>how they think, how they see the world.</p>
<p>Because I think that ultimately reveals,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re actually really good at lying,</p>
<p>it reveals the depths, the complexity of the mind</p>
<p>that through like osmosis, you get to understand</p>
<p>like this person, this person is not as trivial</p>
<p>as you realize.</p>
<p>Also, it makes you maybe realize that this person</p>
<p>is, has a lot of hope, has a lot of positive ambition</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, that has developed over their life.</p>
<p>And then certain interesting ways things went wrong.</p>
<p>They become corrupt and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You just, that&rsquo;s all fine.</p>
<p>But this conversation was not properly contextualized</p>
<p>in the world of what he did.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve asked about this interview</p>
<p>because I was like so curious.</p>
<p>It was out of the New York Times.</p>
<p>And there was not much mention of fraud or jail</p>
<p>or the big crimes, like misappropriation</p>
<p>of even client assets.</p>
<p>It was just sort of this, Sam sat down with me,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s under investigation, but there&rsquo;s not much specifics.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, yeah, he&rsquo;s playing storybook brawl,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s sleeping, he&rsquo;s, and it&rsquo;s just like, okay,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t adding to the conversation.</p>
<p>Especially when the New York Times,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you should be grilling.</p>
<p>Right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>So, but as I said, I mean, it&rsquo;s all arranged the gamut</p>
<p>and some interviews, like some of it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>And then some of it&rsquo;s weird,</p>
<p>like the Andrew Sorkin interview,</p>
<p>he asked some hard hitting questions,</p>
<p>which I really appreciated.</p>
<p>And then at the end, he goes, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>Sam Bankman Freed, and everyone gives like an ovation</p>
<p>for Sam.</p>
<p>I mean, the steel man of that, of course,</p>
<p>is like, they&rsquo;re actually applauding Andrew Sorkin.</p>
<p>But the way you like lay it up,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go like, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an applause line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, ladies and gentlemen, the Eagles,</p>
<p>Elton John, Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>And so to go to, so you have this like deal book summit,</p>
<p>where you have all these important figures</p>
<p>that are positively important.</p>
<p>And at the end, you have Sam Bankman Freed, a fraudster,</p>
<p>and you go, ladies and gentlemen, Sam Bankman Freed,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s applauding.</p>
<p>That I think is a net, like, I think that&rsquo;s a negative.</p>
<p>I think the way that the optics of that</p>
<p>just were all wrong.</p>
<p>And so I think, yeah, you have to be very responsible.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s useful,</p>
<p>going back to how you can usefully do this.</p>
<p>You can, even when somebody&rsquo;s determined to lie to you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always important to pin them down</p>
<p>to an accounting of events,</p>
<p>because that is unimaginably helpful</p>
<p>when it comes to a prosecutor</p>
<p>trying to prove this guy&rsquo;s guilty,</p>
<p>is if you say you didn&rsquo;t do a crime,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t tell me any details about it,</p>
<p>day of the trial, you can basically make up any story.</p>
<p>But if you tell me in detail where you were that day,</p>
<p>I can go hunt down, you say you were with Joe,</p>
<p>I go hunt down Joe and he says he wasn&rsquo;t with you,</p>
<p>boom, you&rsquo;ve lost credibility.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re much more likely to be convicted.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really important to get SBF&rsquo;s exact accounting</p>
<p>of how things went wrong,</p>
<p>because right now he&rsquo;s positioning himself</p>
<p>to throw his Alameda CEO, Caroline Ellison, under the bus.</p>
<p>She did everything, she knew everything, I knew nothing.</p>
<p>Well, is Caroline Ellison&rsquo;s gonna take the stand</p>
<p>and go, well, I have all these text messages</p>
<p>and this is all a lie,</p>
<p>and then Sam Megman Freed is gonna be completely</p>
<p>ruined, like self-ruined by his own design.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>So more like a legal type of get the details</p>
<p>of where he was, what he was thinking, what the-</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>I think the public probably cares</p>
<p>to get to know what happened to.</p>
<p>And again, I think if you&rsquo;re careful,</p>
<p>you can expose someone as they lie to you</p>
<p>without giving into those lies, right?</p>
<p>Like without capitulating to,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m just gonna assume you&rsquo;re correct.</p>
<p>I think you can point to, well, Lex,</p>
<p>you say it happened this way,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve lied about X, Y, and Z,</p>
<p>why should we believe you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a suddenly a totally different conversation</p>
<p>than just being like, oh, okay, that&rsquo;s how it happened.</p>
<p>The thing I caught that bothered me,</p>
<p>and the thing I hope to do in interviews</p>
<p>if I eventually get good at this thing</p>
<p>is the human aspect of it,</p>
<p>which is like, which I think you have to do in person,</p>
<p>is he seems a bit nonchalant about the pain</p>
<p>and the suffering of people.</p>
<p>They have red flags about,</p>
<p>and the way he communicates about the loss of money,</p>
<p>like the pain that people are feeling about the money,</p>
<p>I get red flags.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not, forget if you&rsquo;re involved</p>
<p>in that pain or not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not feeling that pain.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;ll say he is,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;ll be playing a game of League of Legends</p>
<p>while doing it.</p>
<p>No, but I just see it from his face,</p>
<p>the dynamic, and that needs to be grilled.</p>
<p>Like that little human dance there,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, I mean, I considered, I talked to him,</p>
<p>I considered doing an in-person interview with him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Are you still considering it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Do you think I should in person?</p>
<p>I think it depends if you think you have anything</p>
<p>to add to the conversation.</p>
<p>A lot of people have-</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s been already, you did an incredible job.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I think-</p>
<p>I think I would like to grill the shit out of him</p>
<p>as a fellow human, but not an investigator,</p>
<p>but a coffee sale investigator.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like another human being,</p>
<p>another human being who I can have compassion for,</p>
<p>who has caused a lot of suffering in the world.</p>
<p>Like that, that grilling.</p>
<p>Like basically convey the anger that people,</p>
<p>and the pain that people are feeling, right?</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think, I think it&rsquo;d be really hard.</p>
<p>I mean, like that guy is sort of a master dancer,</p>
<p>and what he would say at the end of it,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve listened to so many interviews of him.</p>
<p>I probably am like a GPT model for Sam.</p>
<p>I think he would do some kind of thing about like,</p>
<p>yeah, I really, I really hear you.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s just terrible.</p>
<p>I feel such an obligation to the people who&rsquo;ve lost money.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a lot of money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of money.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;d do something like that.</p>
<p>And it would be very superficially like, okay.</p>
<p>But when you drill down to the details of what he did,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just impossible that he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I wish I had asked,</p>
<p>maybe I can talk about like, I wish I had gone on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so hard when you&rsquo;re doing a live interview</p>
<p>to kind of focus on one thing.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s asked about the terms of service.</p>
<p>So in the terms of service, there was like,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t touch your funds.</p>
<p>Your funds are safe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re never going to do anything with that.</p>
<p>Anytime anyone brings that up, he says, oh,</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s this other terms of service over here</p>
<p>with margin trading accounts.</p>
<p>Remember we talked about, it&rsquo;s a derivatives platform.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in our derivatives side,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re subject to different terms of service,</p>
<p>which kind of lets us like move your money around</p>
<p>with everyone else, okay?</p>
<p>So we treat it as one big pool of funds.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of the explanation</p>
<p>of how this all happened is,</p>
<p>we had this huge leverage position and we lost everything.</p>
<p>But what no one has sort of done a good enough job</p>
<p>getting to the heart of,</p>
<p>is that this pool of funds never was segregated properly.</p>
<p>It was all treated under the same umbrella</p>
<p>of we can use your funds.</p>
<p>There was no amount of, we have the client deposits,</p>
<p>which were just deposited with us</p>
<p>and not like used to margin trade or do anything over here.</p>
<p>These funds over here, we have saved.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, they lied from the get-go</p>
<p>about how they were treating the most precious assets,</p>
<p>which is your customer deposits</p>
<p>that you said you didn&rsquo;t invest.</p>
<p>Clearly you put them all over here,</p>
<p>you YOLO gambled them.</p>
<p>And then when everyone starts withdrawing from here,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have any money over here.</p>
<p>So that is like one of the most fundamental things</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone grill him on.</p>
<p>And the next time if I get the chance to ambush him again,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna drill down on</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s impossible for that not to be fraud.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no world where you had a pool of funds over here</p>
<p>and now you don&rsquo;t have them</p>
<p>without you somehow borrowing over here.</p>
<p>Because if you deposited one Bitcoin</p>
<p>and I never sold that Bitcoin and it&rsquo;s earmarked Lex Friedman</p>
<p>and you come and it&rsquo;s not there,</p>
<p>something had to happen, right?</p>
<p>So this is so interesting.</p>
<p>So for me, the approach that,</p>
<p>like you said, the most important question of,</p>
<p>because for you it&rsquo;s like, were those funds segregated?</p>
<p>For me, the question is, as a human being,</p>
<p>how would you feel if you&rsquo;re observing that?</p>
<p>So like, you know, that like marshmallow test with the babies</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s the human thing, it&rsquo;s the human nature question.</p>
<p>Like I can understand there&rsquo;s a pile of money</p>
<p>and you, the good faith interpretation is like,</p>
<p>well, I know what to do with that pile of money</p>
<p>to grow that pile of money.</p>
<p>Let me just take a little bit of that.</p>
<p>Like how willing are you to do that kind of thing?</p>
<p>How able are you to do that kind of thing?</p>
<p>And when shit goes wrong, what goes through your mind?</p>
<p>How does it become corrupted?</p>
<p>How do you begin to lose yourself?</p>
<p>How do you delegate responsibility for the failures?</p>
<p>Like, as opposed to getting facts,</p>
<p>try to sneak into the human mind of a person</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re thinking of that.</p>
<p>Because the facts, they&rsquo;re gonna start waffling.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna start like trying to make sure</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t say anything that gets them incriminated.</p>
<p>But I just, I want to understand the human being there</p>
<p>because I think that indirectly gives you a sense of</p>
<p>where were you in this big picture?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve talked to so many people</p>
<p>who have sort of committed some range of like outright fraud</p>
<p>to like misleading marketing.</p>
<p>No one thinks they&rsquo;re a bad person.</p>
<p>Nobody admits that they did it and they knew they did,</p>
<p>or almost nobody does.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually one funny exception.</p>
<p>But I had a guy who admitted like, yeah, I did it.</p>
<p>It was wrong.</p>
<p>And, you know, but I did it and I wanted the money,</p>
<p>which was kind of like almost refreshing in its honesty.</p>
<p>But the reason I focus on like the facts</p>
<p>is because unless you find a bright red line,</p>
<p>humans can rationalize anything.</p>
<p>I can rationalize any level of like,</p>
<p>well, I did this because I had the best of intentions.</p>
<p>And if you play the intention game,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never convict anyone</p>
<p>because everyone has good intentions.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s honest, everyone&rsquo;s doing the best they can</p>
<p>and got misleaded and got misguided and da, da, da, da.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you have to drill down to the concrete</p>
<p>and go, look, I get it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like the last 50 guys that I interviewed.</p>
<p>You had the best of intentions.</p>
<p>It all went wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very sorry for you.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, there&rsquo;s people hurting</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s people that have significant damage</p>
<p>to their life because of you.</p>
<p>What did you actually do?</p>
<p>And what can we prove taking intention out of it,</p>
<p>taking motivation out, what can we prove that you did</p>
<p>that was unethical, illegal, or immoral?</p>
<p>And like, that is sort of what usually I try to go to</p>
<p>because I will do those human interviews,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just like the same record on repeat.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of people go through the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you, I&rsquo;m with you on everything you said,</p>
<p>but there is ways to avoid the record on repeat.</p>
<p>I mean, those are different skillset.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exceptionally good at the investigative,</p>
<p>like investigating.</p>
<p>I do believe there&rsquo;s a way to break through the repeat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different techniques to it.</p>
<p>One of which is like taking outside</p>
<p>of their particular story.</p>
<p>Yes, when everyone looks at their own story,</p>
<p>they can see themselves as a good player doing good.</p>
<p>But you can do other thought experiments.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll follow you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll know what the thought experiment is.</p>
<p>No, well, it depends.</p>
<p>It depends, my friend.</p>
<p>I mean, like, you know, to me, there&rsquo;s a million of them,</p>
<p>but just exploring your ethics.</p>
<p>Would you kill somebody to protect your family?</p>
<p>And you explore that.</p>
<p>You start to sneak into, like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your sense of the in-group versus the out-group?</p>
<p>How much damage you can do to the out-group?</p>
<p>And who is the out-group?</p>
<p>And you start to build that sense of the person.</p>
<p>Are we like the two mobsters that we&rsquo;re dressed as?</p>
<p>Do we protect the family and fuck everyone else?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re with us, and the ones who are against us, fuck them.</p>
<p>Or do we have a sense that human beings all have value,</p>
<p>equal value, and we&rsquo;re a joint humanity?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ways to get to that.</p>
<p>And you start to build up this sense of, like,</p>
<p>some people that make a lot of money are better than others.</p>
<p>They deserve to be at the top.</p>
<p>If you have that feeling, you start to get a sense of, like,</p>
<p>yeah, the poor people are the dumbasses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the idiots.</p>
<p>If you believe that, then you start to understand</p>
<p>that this person may have been at the core</p>
<p>of this whole corrupt organization.</p>
<p>Yes, two things.</p>
<p>One, I think you should join me on this side of the table.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put SBF over here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll, good guy, bad guy, human, facts.</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bad guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, no, no, no, slow down, coffee.</p>
<p>What is your feeling about humanity?</p>
<p>Yeah, I-</p>
<p>Have you been getting enough sleep?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>So I think, no, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of truth</p>
<p>to what you said.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed that is hard to combat</p>
<p>is sort of, like, preference falsification</p>
<p>and just, like, just the outright lying about those things</p>
<p>is tough to kind of pin down.</p>
<p>But yeah, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ways to interview people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of interesting techniques.</p>
<p>And yeah, I don&rsquo;t disagree.</p>
<p>Good cop, bad cop.</p>
<p>We should do, this should be like a sitcom.</p>
<p>Okay, you did an incredible documentary on SafeMoon.</p>
<p>The title is, I Uncovered a Billion Dollar Fraud.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the story of SafeMoon?</p>
<p>Sure, so SafeMoon was a crypto coin</p>
<p>that exploded on the scene in 2021, I think, at this point.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m losing track of my years.</p>
<p>One year in crypto is like five years in real life.</p>
<p>But it kind of gained a huge amount of popularity</p>
<p>because of this idea that, it&rsquo;s in the name,</p>
<p>you go safely to the moon.</p>
<p>How they were gonna do this</p>
<p>is with sort of a sophisticated smart contract idea</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s, I kind of have to explain</p>
<p>the way some contracts get rug pulled for a second,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s scams happen.</p>
<p>So in the, sometimes it&rsquo;s called like the shit coin space,</p>
<p>the alt coin space, anything like below Bitcoin, Ethereum,</p>
<p>and maybe the top five or 10,</p>
<p>is kind of seen as this wasteland of gambling.</p>
<p>And like, you don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the developers are gonna become anything or not.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of like reading the white paper,</p>
<p>trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this big question about like,</p>
<p>how can you get scammed?</p>
<p>How can, back to the interests,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want the developer to have some like,</p>
<p>parachute cord where they can pull all the money out.</p>
<p>So one way this happens is that in decentralized finance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called the liquidity pool, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically this big pot of money</p>
<p>that allows people to trade between two different currencies.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say like SafeMoon and Bitcoin, right?</p>
<p>Or Ethereum, or it&rsquo;s actually on the Binance Smart Chain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;d be BNB.</p>
<p>And this pool of money can be controlled by the developers</p>
<p>in such a way they can steal it all, right?</p>
<p>They can just grab it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna go too much into details</p>
<p>because I feel like I&rsquo;ll lose people here.</p>
<p>But the point of SafeMoon was,</p>
<p>the core idea was we&rsquo;re locking this money up.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t touch it.</p>
<p>And actually every transaction that you buy SafeMoon with,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll take a 5% tax of that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do a 10% tax, but 5% of it,</p>
<p>will go back to all the holders of SafeMoon, okay?</p>
<p>And 5% of it will go back in this little pool of money, okay?</p>
<p>So the idea is as you trade,</p>
<p>as this token becomes more viral, two things will happen.</p>
<p>One, the people who are holding it long-term</p>
<p>will be rewarded for holding it long-term</p>
<p>by receiving this 5% tax that&rsquo;s distributed to everyone.</p>
<p>And two, you can kind of trust</p>
<p>that your money&rsquo;s gonna have this stable value</p>
<p>because this pool of money here in the middle,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of guaranteeing you can get your SafeMoon out</p>
<p>into this actually valuable currency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna move.</p>
<p>So the story of SafeMoon was that fundamentally,</p>
<p>this was not the case.</p>
<p>They promised that this money was gonna be locked up.</p>
<p>It was not actually locked up at all.</p>
<p>They said it was automatically locked up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>
<p>Well, it was very manually locked up</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t actually lock a lot of it up.</p>
<p>They took a lot of it for themselves, for the developers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of players in this.</p>
<p>Some of the, a lot of them have left by now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of this main CEO</p>
<p>that everyone knows, John Karony now.</p>
<p>And despite saying that they were gonna lock up</p>
<p>all the funds for four years,</p>
<p>somehow he&rsquo;s gone from, as everyone else in the token</p>
<p>has lost 99% of the value of the token.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve lost 99%.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gotten like a $6 million crypto portfolio,</p>
<p>multimillion dollar real estate portfolio,</p>
<p>invested millions into various companies.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s accrued this huge wealth.</p>
<p>And so I made a video basically exposing that</p>
<p>and showing how this coin,</p>
<p>which once had a $4 billion market cap,</p>
<p>is just viral everywhere.</p>
<p>Everyone was talking about it.</p>
<p>Because of these viral ideas,</p>
<p>like it is sort of a captivating idea</p>
<p>that by holding it, you could get returns, right?</p>
<p>Like you just hold onto it, you automatically get money.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a viral idea that this money in the middle,</p>
<p>in the pot, isn&rsquo;t gonna leave you.</p>
<p>When those things turned out to be false,</p>
<p>this community has had a slow death</p>
<p>as a lot of people realized it was a scam.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been a core part of the community,</p>
<p>which gets to an interesting dynamic</p>
<p>we can talk about if you want to,</p>
<p>where they have like doubled down on the belief in Karony.</p>
<p>And so part of it was out of a hope</p>
<p>to let those people know what was really going on</p>
<p>in their coin and like hopefully save some of them,</p>
<p>not in like some altruistic sense,</p>
<p>but like, or not in like some like, I&rsquo;m like a hero sense,</p>
<p>but in the sense of like,</p>
<p>I think a lot of them didn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like literally didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So just sort of like as a public service,</p>
<p>letting them know so they could get their money out</p>
<p>and hopefully save themselves a lot of pain and suffering.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>So they really dug in.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Some did, some did, some left.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of people have left,</p>
<p>but the people who are left</p>
<p>are people with large amounts of SafeMoon holdings</p>
<p>that are down immensely.</p>
<p>And you can imagine at a certain point in losses,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tremendous psychological pressure to go,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m in it.</p>
<p>I got to go for the long haul.</p>
<p>And then you want to believe</p>
<p>that this thing is legitimate and will succeed</p>
<p>because A, there&rsquo;s an ego component around,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been scammed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too smart to get scammed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tremendously, you know,</p>
<p>it hurts psychologically to acknowledge</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been taken for a ride.</p>
<p>And also you just want this thing to succeed</p>
<p>for your financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>So you like want to believe it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s tremendous psychological pressure</p>
<p>to build cult-like communities around these tokens.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve noticed with the incentive of like community built,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of new to finance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like these meme coins or these cults.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really fair to call all of them cults.</p>
<p>Like some of them are open to criticism,</p>
<p>but one of the things that defines cults</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re not open to sunlight or criticism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s these financial communities</p>
<p>that are opening up with crypto, with a few stocks,</p>
<p>where if you criticize them, you are attacked.</p>
<p>And the entire community has every incentive</p>
<p>to kind of like downplay your legitimate criticisms</p>
<p>or kind of go after you.</p>
<p>And so it creates this interesting dynamic</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m fascinated by.</p>
<p>What do you think about Bitcoin then?</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s one of those communities</p>
<p>that does attack you when criticized?</p>
<p>So which, I guess,</p>
<p>which coins do you think are open to criticism</p>
<p>and which are not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of tough.</p>
<p>Like no community is a monolith.</p>
<p>So just like, it&rsquo;s just a spectrum of how open they are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always this core contingent of extreme believers</p>
<p>who will go after anyone who criticizes them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just about how wide of a band</p>
<p>that makes up of the entire token.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>How intensely, how active that small community is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in Bitcoin, they&rsquo;re called Bitcoin maximalists.</p>
<p>But you can also call any community&rsquo;s subgroup</p>
<p>like that maximalist, whatever the belief is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Dunkin Donuts maximalists.</p>
<p>That community is probably small</p>
<p>in terms of attack you online.</p>
<p>You know which community has a very intense following?</p>
<p>So I got attacked on the internet</p>
<p>when I said Messi&rsquo;s better than Ronaldo.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s controversial.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a very intense maximalist community there.</p>
<p>The other one that surprised me is when I said,</p>
<p>now I did it in jest.</p>
<p>Okay, folks?</p>
<p>I said, Emacs is a better ID than Vim.</p>
<p>I love Emacs, I agree.</p>
<p>Listen, I have trauma.</p>
<p>I wake up sweating sometimes at night thinking-</p>
<p>Emacs master race.</p>
<p>The Vim people are after me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in the shadows.</p>
<p>No, Vim is an amazing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually a surprise I&rsquo;ve recently learned</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s still even more so than before</p>
<p>an incredibly active community.</p>
<p>So a lot of people wrote to me-</p>
<p>But do you use Spacemacs?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just Emacs and Vim?</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I use Raw.</p>
<p>I have- Old school Emacs?</p>
<p>Oh, you gotta use, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But hold on a second.</p>
<p>I actually recently, I have recently said,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make love, not war.</p>
<p>And I went to VS Code.</p>
<p>I went to a more modern ID.</p>
<p>But, because I did most of my programming in Emacs,</p>
<p>I did most of anything as one does in Emacs,</p>
<p>just because I also love Lisp,</p>
<p>so I can customize everything.</p>
<p>Then I realized, like,</p>
<p>like how long will Vim and Emacs be around, really?</p>
<p>I was thinking, as a programmer,</p>
<p>looking like 10, 20 years out,</p>
<p>you know, I should challenge myself to learn new IDs,</p>
<p>to learn the new tools</p>
<p>that the majority of the community is using,</p>
<p>so that I can understand what are the benefits and the cost.</p>
<p>I found myself getting a little too comfortable</p>
<p>with the tools that I grew up with.</p>
<p>And I think one of the fundamental ways</p>
<p>of being as a programmer,</p>
<p>as anyone involved with technology,</p>
<p>based on how quickly it&rsquo;s evolving,</p>
<p>is to keep learning new tools.</p>
<p>Like, the way of life should be constantly learning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a mathematician or a physicist</p>
<p>or any of those disciplines that are more stable.</p>
<p>This is like, everything is changing.</p>
<p>Crypto&rsquo;s, like you said, a perfect example of that.</p>
<p>You have to constantly update your understanding</p>
<p>of the, of digital finance, constantly,</p>
<p>in order to be able to function,</p>
<p>in order to be able to criticize it,</p>
<p>in order to be able to know what to invest in.</p>
<p>So yeah, that was why I did,</p>
<p>I tried PyCharm, a bunch,</p>
<p>the whole JetBrains infrastructure,</p>
<p>and then also VS Code,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really popular,</p>
<p>and, you know, Atom and Sublime, all of those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring, I&rsquo;ve been exploring.</p>
<p>But VS Code is amazing.</p>
<p>You should check out SpaceMax.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna give one more pitch for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just basically like a customizable configuration.</p>
<p>Well, Emacs is already customizable,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty useful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even much of a coder,</p>
<p>but for like certain journaling applications</p>
<p>or like time management, like I find it really useful, so.</p>
<p>But anyway, we&rsquo;re so like,</p>
<p>I feel like half this podcast is what it should have been,</p>
<p>and half of it&rsquo;s just us nerding out</p>
<p>about our own engineering, like idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>Sorry, guys.</p>
<p>All right, so what were we talking about?</p>
<p>SafeMoon and Bitcoin, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Is there, have you made enemies in certain communities?</p>
<p>What do you think about Bitcoin?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve made certain enemies</p>
<p>in the sort of crypto skeptics space,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s sort of this range of skepticism</p>
<p>you can have about cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obviously a skeptic of a lot of it,</p>
<p>but there are certain aspects of crypto</p>
<p>that I think are inevitable,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna do my best to kind of describe those here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not committed to any crypto specifically,</p>
<p>but there are some, I&rsquo;ve taken a lot of heat,</p>
<p>ironically, for not being skeptical enough.</p>
<p>There are some people who believe</p>
<p>that like the entire thing is a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re rslashbutcoin on Reddit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing community, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very funny.</p>
<p>They have-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a butcoin?</p>
<p>Is that-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a play on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like-</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>At least we admit it&rsquo;s a scam.</p>
<p>Very funny guys, very funny people there.</p>
<p>So, but they&rsquo;ll be like, you know,</p>
<p>CoffeeZilla should just admit</p>
<p>that all of it&rsquo;s a giant Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>All of it&rsquo;s basically like not real.</p>
<p>So everything including Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all basically all the Ponzi-nomics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Ponzi-nomics all the way down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there is no fundamental use case</p>
<p>that is that useful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if,</p>
<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t wanna strawman them here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re saying that it&rsquo;s all useless.</p>
<p>At minimum, they&rsquo;re saying the level of interest</p>
<p>in cryptocurrencies is far,</p>
<p>the actual usefulness of it is far less</p>
<p>than the amount of attention and time and money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being poured into it.</p>
<p>So like the revolutionariness of this technology</p>
<p>is not at all revolutionary.</p>
<p>Let me kind of steel man what I think the pro-crypto take is.</p>
<p>I think that technologies are sort of this inert thing</p>
<p>and the success of them in my opinion is not based on PR,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not based on marketing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s based on cheaper, faster, better.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the success of any technology</p>
<p>relies on those three things and longevity of it.</p>
<p>So I have two employees</p>
<p>and both of them are out of the country.</p>
<p>So I have to frequently make</p>
<p>international wire payments to them.</p>
<p>Is one of them SBF, just as a reporter, I have to ask.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, all right, he&rsquo;s not on the payroll.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he&rsquo;d have to pay me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to do my best Coffeezilla words,</p>
<p>I get hard-hitting investigative questions.</p>
<p>So with these international payments,</p>
<p>you face all sorts of slow fees</p>
<p>and you face kind of like this time thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s this painful process.</p>
<p>So if I use different cryptocurrencies,</p>
<p>some of them are like really fast,</p>
<p>some of them have really low fees.</p>
<p>I just believe in a world where digital currencies</p>
<p>with fast payments, with cheap payments,</p>
<p>revolutionize the global exchange of currency.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if this is going to include the blockchain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the blockchain is the first thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really embraced truly digital currency,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t need to go through</p>
<p>this complicated system of wire transfers and just happens.</p>
<p>So I can send you,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I want to send you Ethereum or Bitcoin,</p>
<p>I can send it to you just as fast</p>
<p>if I send you a dollar or a billion dollars,</p>
<p>and I can send it to you just as fast</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re across from me</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re across the world from me.</p>
<p>That I think is a step change in easier, faster, better.</p>
<p>In terms of like just this really basic</p>
<p>international payments kind of idea.</p>
<p>So I think at like its core,</p>
<p>if the lowest form use case of cryptocurrencies is that,</p>
<p>I think it will change the world in some variety.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kind of the larger question is,</p>
<p>is that technology going to include</p>
<p>the blockchain specifically or not?</p>
<p>The other benefit is transparency,</p>
<p>which I personally like as an investigator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that previously it&rsquo;s like hard to describe</p>
<p>how opaque our financial system is</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;ve tried to investigate someone or something.</p>
<p>Understanding finances, unless you have a subpoena,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re like the FBI or like the SEC</p>
<p>and you can get a subpoena for someone&rsquo;s finances</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going through discovery,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what someone has.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically playing poker with everyone</p>
<p>and the cards are face down.</p>
<p>For the first time, the blockchain to some extent,</p>
<p>because there are ways to obfuscate it.</p>
<p>And in some ways cryptocurrency has enabled more fraud,</p>
<p>which is kind of this irony.</p>
<p>But in some ways it&rsquo;s enabled people</p>
<p>to also audit a lot better and in real time.</p>
<p>And I think that is a structural change</p>
<p>that is fundamentally for the better.</p>
<p>The question of all this is,</p>
<p>do those betters outweigh the cons that this introduces?</p>
<p>And how much can regulation mitigate those cons?</p>
<p>Some of those cons being like fraud, money laundering,</p>
<p>all these negative externalities</p>
<p>that are easier with cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Why do you think cryptocurrency in particular</p>
<p>seems to attract fraudulent people?</p>
<p>Like scammers and fraudsters.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s unregulated, it&rsquo;s the wild west</p>
<p>and you can transmit large amounts of money</p>
<p>very quickly across the world.</p>
<p>What about-</p>
<p>With very little oversight.</p>
<p>Creating new crypto projects, like new coins.</p>
<p>Because you have to show very little actual use case.</p>
<p>You can just promise.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like true of any emerging technology.</p>
<p>So much vaporware happens at the beginning</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s all promise.</p>
<p>Because fundamentally, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re legitimate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m illegitimate.</p>
<p>We look the same at the start of a technology.</p>
<p>Because both of us are promising what this can do.</p>
<p>And in fact, the less scruples and morals I have,</p>
<p>in some ways I can out-compete you.</p>
<p>Because I can say, mine does what Lexis does,</p>
<p>but like way better and way faster.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to happen in a year rather than 10 years.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re being honest, I&rsquo;m playing a dishonest game,</p>
<p>I look better.</p>
<p>Once this space matures,</p>
<p>and you actually have some people actually doing the things</p>
<p>that they say they&rsquo;re going to do,</p>
<p>suddenly this equation changes.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re Amazon, you&rsquo;re delivering in two days.</p>
<p>I can say whatever I want.</p>
<p>You do the thing you do, and I have no credibility.</p>
<p>So I think that like part of the fraud is,</p>
<p>you know, just the ability to transmit so much money</p>
<p>so quickly with such little oversight.</p>
<p>Part of it is like, this just happens</p>
<p>with any emergent technology.</p>
<p>Vaporware is a real thing.</p>
<p>And hopefully, as this space matures,</p>
<p>as regulation comes in, things will improve.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you your own psychology.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going after some of the richest,</p>
<p>some of the most powerful people in the world.</p>
<p>Do you worry about your own financial, legal,</p>
<p>and psychological wellbeing?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not totally oblivious to the precariousness</p>
<p>of like any kind of journalism like this.</p>
<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s risks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed, there&rsquo;s a quote,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to butcher it,</p>
<p>but I hope you guys understand the spirit of it.</p>
<p>You know, news is when you print something</p>
<p>someone else doesn&rsquo;t want you to print.</p>
<p>Everything else is public relations.</p>
<p>I really believe to do meaningful journalism,</p>
<p>you have to go after people.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not inherently a safe profession.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to do important work,</p>
<p>you have to have risk tolerances.</p>
<p>And I think everyone has a line</p>
<p>of what that risk tolerance is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s different for everyone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could do what Edward Snowden did.</p>
<p>I think that would be my bright red line,</p>
<p>is going against my own government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a, in my opinion, I really see him as a hero.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s such a selfless act of self-destruction.</p>
<p>You know that the party you&rsquo;re going after</p>
<p>has all the power and will crush you.</p>
<p>And you do it anyway out of the like the true,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, platonic ideal of journalism.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I could do that.</p>
<p>I think I need some ability to live and subsist</p>
<p>in the society that I am in.</p>
<p>And I think my bright red line would be like,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m forced to flee the country for my work,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d finally have to say no.</p>
<p>But for, as journalists go, I&rsquo;m pretty risk,</p>
<p>I take risk pretty well.</p>
<p>I especially like think risk is important to take</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re young and when you can do that.</p>
<p>I think when I have, I mean, I&rsquo;m married.</p>
<p>So when I have a family,</p>
<p>I think I will probably dial this risk thing down,</p>
<p>just being honest.</p>
<p>I mean, I think you kind of have to.</p>
<p>But right now, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of like running on all cylinders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to take on quite a range of people,</p>
<p>but yeah, I think a lot about it.</p>
<p>Wolfpack of one or small Wolfpack,</p>
<p>as opposed to having like a New York Times behind you</p>
<p>or a huge organizations with lawyers,</p>
<p>with a team, with a history.</p>
<p>These people are less courageous.</p>
<p>This is the dirty truth.</p>
<p>The bigger the organization,</p>
<p>the more conservative a lot of them are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that sometimes they like,</p>
<p>and this is not to bash big organizations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying this as an observation</p>
<p>of someone who&rsquo;s talked to a lot of people.</p>
<p>And especially in the world of fraud,</p>
<p>a lot of them are scared to engage in fraud</p>
<p>that is obvious, but hasn&rsquo;t been litigated yet.</p>
<p>This is why you&rsquo;ll never see documentaries</p>
<p>about ongoing fraud on Netflix.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much of a liability.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll sue Netflix to hell.</p>
<p>And they know that if they win,</p>
<p>Netflix has the money to pay it.</p>
<p>So corporations like the New York Times,</p>
<p>a lot of these, some of them are very,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re as courageous as they can be.</p>
<p>But at the bottom line,</p>
<p>if someone sues you to hell and back</p>
<p>and you have to pay up, you will disappear.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re relying on liability insurance,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re already paying out the ass for</p>
<p>to try to cover you if you get sued.</p>
<p>But if you get sued, even if you win,</p>
<p>that liability insurance now goes up in price</p>
<p>the next year.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re the New York Times, it goes up by a lot.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>that independent journalists can do uniquely</p>
<p>that they can actually take like in some ways more risk</p>
<p>than a giant institution,</p>
<p>which has a lot more in my sense to lose,</p>
<p>even though it would appear</p>
<p>like they have more in terms of defense too.</p>
<p>But you get, you can be bullied legally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you get afraid of that?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, all these things</p>
<p>are things you have to be aware of</p>
<p>and then forget to do your job.</p>
<p>Like you have to be, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like being like a snowboarder</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, do you realize you could hit your head?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>But in order to go do the flip or whatever,</p>
<p>you have to just accept the risk,</p>
<p>mitigate the risk as much as possible and move on.</p>
<p>So we have like insurance.</p>
<p>We keep like a pool of funds for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m very conservative with how I spend my money</p>
<p>basically all on production</p>
<p>and like trying to make my life as secure as I can.</p>
<p>And then I just do the work that I, you know,</p>
<p>I want to do because.</p>
<p>So 99% of your fund goes into the studio</p>
<p>and then into that elaborate space of yours.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>How many kittens had to die to manufacture that studio?</p>
<p>But anyway, that&rsquo;s my investigation for later.</p>
<p>What keeps you mentally strong through all of this?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your source of mental like strength</p>
<p>or your psychological strength through this?</p>
<p>I think there was a time</p>
<p>when I was getting a lot of cease and desists.</p>
<p>Some people were like actually like saying</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re going to show up to my house,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I was that.</p>
<p>I think I was pretty worried about that for a while.</p>
<p>My wife was a huge source of strength here</p>
<p>where she was like, hey, if you&rsquo;re not comfortable with it,</p>
<p>you need to get out of the game</p>
<p>or you need to basically like suck it up.</p>
<p>And like, this is what it is.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go after these people,</p>
<p>you have to basically be mentally strong around this.</p>
<p>And seeing her have that realization</p>
<p>helped me have the same realization.</p>
<p>And I really deeply admire and respect that about her.</p>
<p>And it solved a lot of my concerns around that.</p>
<p>It just made me realize every profession has risks.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>You mitigate and then you move on.</p>
<p>Why do you think there&rsquo;s so few journalists like you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically the embodiment,</p>
<p>at least in the space you operate,</p>
<p>of what great journalism should be.</p>
<p>Why do you think there&rsquo;s very few like you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an enormous compliment</p>
<p>and probably overstatement.</p>
<p>But I first want to pay respect.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great journalists</p>
<p>and a lot of them are like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to just kind of take it and go,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many great journalists.</p>
<p>Matt Levine, Kelsey Piper,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got anonymous journalists like Dirty Bubble,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got citizen journalists like Tiffany Fong.</p>
<p>But I think if you&rsquo;re going to be in this space</p>
<p>in the longterm, you do need to accept certain risks.</p>
<p>And I think in the longterm,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know how easy it is</p>
<p>to play that game for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Because you make&hellip;</p>
<p>To do great journalism, you don&rsquo;t get paid a lot</p>
<p>compared to what you could get paid</p>
<p>if you did press pieces or anything like that.</p>
<p>You take a lot of risks legally,</p>
<p>you take physical risks, you take&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, if you care about money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the profession.</p>
<p>And I feel like a lot of people, when they get notoriety,</p>
<p>they move to like, well, I can just maximize</p>
<p>the money security side of things.</p>
<p>And I think it takes out</p>
<p>a lot of would-be great journalists.</p>
<p>And also, so first of all,</p>
<p>comfort of physical and mental well-being.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And also being invited to parties with powerful people.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You make enemies, rich and powerful enemies doing this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why it makes it&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s admirable.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting case study</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been doing it as long as you have.</p>
<p>And I hope you keep doing it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just interesting that it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, I wanna make a call.</p>
<p>I think societies can create better journalists</p>
<p>and worse journalists insofar as they support</p>
<p>the journalists who are doing great work.</p>
<p>And I wanna call out Edward Snowden specifically,</p>
<p>because what we have done to him is such a travesty.</p>
<p>And the only lesson you can learn</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a logical human being</p>
<p>is that you should never whistleblow</p>
<p>on the United States government</p>
<p>after looking at what they did to Snowden.</p>
<p>So as a society, we can put pressure on lawmakers</p>
<p>to make it easier for people to do the great work</p>
<p>by not punishing the people who do great work,</p>
<p>if that makes sense, and de-risking it for them.</p>
<p>Because we shouldn&rsquo;t expect journalists to be martyrs</p>
<p>to do great work, right?</p>
<p>To do important work.</p>
<p>And part of that comes from protecting whistleblowers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like very common sense things.</p>
<p>I love, like, it&rsquo;s great to heroicize people</p>
<p>like Edward Snowden and stuff like that,</p>
<p>but we shouldn&rsquo;t expect them to be heroes to do that work.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about going,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been focused on financial fraud.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about going after other centers of power?</p>
<p>Like government, politics?</p>
<p>Politics, it seems to me, you can&rsquo;t do good work.</p>
<p>Like everybody doing good work in politics</p>
<p>is to some extent, from my limited perspective,</p>
<p>as I said, I&rsquo;m not that into it.</p>
<p>It seems like everyone has to take a side</p>
<p>because even if you do great work,</p>
<p>whoever you&rsquo;re exposing, half the other people,</p>
<p>no matter how good your work is,</p>
<p>are going to claim it&rsquo;s just for partisan hackery</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to malign you.</p>
<p>So it seems like a lot of journalists have to take a slant,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not explicit, like bias,</p>
<p>they have to take a slant on who they expose.</p>
<p>I hate that.</p>
<p>I would really like a world where you could freely expose</p>
<p>both sides without having a constant malignment of like,</p>
<p>you know, who are you working for?</p>
<p>Or you did this for X, Y, Z, or whatever.</p>
<p>I really find that deeply problematic</p>
<p>about our current journalism in the political sphere.</p>
<p>As far as government stuff, I think it&rsquo;s easy to do,</p>
<p>not easy, but it&rsquo;s much more enticing</p>
<p>to do foreign journalism than to do local journalism</p>
<p>on positions of power.</p>
<p>Because if you question, it&rsquo;s so easy to just get,</p>
<p>the bigger cases you expose locally, you get in danger.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just like very, very clear cut.</p>
<p>The bigger the case, the more your financial wellbeing,</p>
<p>your access, your entire life is like sort of in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Whereas if you do foreign journalism,</p>
<p>you can do great work and largely you&rsquo;re protected</p>
<p>by your own government.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of this weird thing where if you want</p>
<p>great journalism on America, sometimes going abroad</p>
<p>might be the way to go.</p>
<p>But the politician thing that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>you mentioned that and going abroad.</p>
<p>I think the way you think about your current work,</p>
<p>I think applies in great journalism, in politics as well.</p>
<p>So what happens, I have that sense,</p>
<p>because I aspire to be like you in the conversation space</p>
<p>of like with politicians.</p>
<p>I tried to talk to people on the left and the right</p>
<p>and do so in a nonpartisan way and criticize,</p>
<p>but also steel man their cases.</p>
<p>What happens, I&rsquo;ve learned, is when you talk to somebody</p>
<p>on the right, the right kind of brings you in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yes, we&rsquo;ll keep you comfortable, come with us.</p>
<p>And then the left attacks you.</p>
<p>And so, and the same happens on the left.</p>
<p>You talk on the left, the right attacks you</p>
<p>and the left is like, come with us.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a temptation, a momentum to staying</p>
<p>to that one side, whatever that side is.</p>
<p>The same with foreign journalism.</p>
<p>You can cover Putin critically.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strong pull to being pro-Ukraine,</p>
<p>pro-Zelensky, pro, basically really covering</p>
<p>in a favorable way to the point of propaganda,</p>
<p>to the point of PR, the Zelensky regime.</p>
<p>If you criticize the Zelensky regime,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a strong pull towards then being supportive</p>
<p>of not necessarily the Putin regime,</p>
<p>but a very different perspective on it,</p>
<p>which is like NATO is the one that created that war.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s narratives that pull you.</p>
<p>And what I think a great journalist does</p>
<p>is make enemies on both sides and walk through that fire</p>
<p>and not get pulled in to the protection of any one side</p>
<p>because they get so harshly attacked</p>
<p>anytime they deviate from the center.</p>
<p>Well, and I think also like there&rsquo;s a criticism</p>
<p>of all centrists, which I think in some way is fair.</p>
<p>And I say that as someone largely who&rsquo;s a centrist,</p>
<p>which is that this what about is, or like this,</p>
<p>like what about the left or what about the right</p>
<p>can skew when it&rsquo;s not a both sides issue.</p>
<p>So in the case of like Russia, Ukraine,</p>
<p>I think like, I&rsquo;m strongly in favor of Ukraine,</p>
<p>even though I tend to go like on both sides.</p>
<p>And that might be partly because</p>
<p>one of my employees is Ukrainian.</p>
<p>And I think what a great journalist does,</p>
<p>especially like in politics,</p>
<p>is I think they criticize the regime that&rsquo;s most in power,</p>
<p>most controls the keys and is the most corrupt at that time.</p>
<p>And they might appear to be like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say during the realm of Trump,</p>
<p>a great journalist would criticize Trump,</p>
<p>but that same journalist who held Trump&rsquo;s feet to the fire</p>
<p>should be capable of holding Biden&rsquo;s feet to the fire</p>
<p>four years later, if that kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So any revealing any, so attacking any power center</p>
<p>for the corruption, for the flaws they have.</p>
<p>Irrespective of like your political agenda</p>
<p>or your political ideas, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I mean about sort of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>There are several key players,</p>
<p>NATO, Russia, Ukraine, China, India.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s several less important players,</p>
<p>maybe some of the like Iran and like Israel and maybe Africa.</p>
<p>And what great journalism requires</p>
<p>is basically revealing the flaws</p>
<p>of each one of those players,</p>
<p>irrespective of the attacks you get.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right that throughout any particular situation,</p>
<p>there is some parties that are worse than others</p>
<p>and you have to weigh your perspective accordingly.</p>
<p>But also it requires you to be fearless in certain things.</p>
<p>Like for example, I don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like to be a journalist covering China now.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s an exact case of like,</p>
<p>China has made it so difficult to be a good journalist</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve effectively squashed criticism</p>
<p>because to be a journalist in China</p>
<p>means constantly risking your life every single day</p>
<p>to criticize that government.</p>
<p>And so the best journalists</p>
<p>are a lot of times outside the country</p>
<p>or they have sources inside the country</p>
<p>who are like, there&rsquo;s like this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s layers to the journalism where there&rsquo;s insiders</p>
<p>who are leaking information,</p>
<p>but they themselves cannot publish</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s extremely risky.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think as a society,</p>
<p>one measure of how healthy the political structure is</p>
<p>is how well you can criticize it</p>
<p>without fearing for your safety.</p>
<p>In that sense, the chaos and the bickering</p>
<p>going on in the United States politics is a good thing.</p>
<p>That people can criticize very harshly.</p>
<p>Very harsh.</p>
<p>And be in terms of safety are pretty safe.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>I think our only challenge is like</p>
<p>where it gets dangerous is around</p>
<p>like top secret information.</p>
<p>The government comes down so hard</p>
<p>that the danger in covering politics here</p>
<p>is you can expose something that&rsquo;s top secret</p>
<p>that should be exposed and they&rsquo;ll ruin you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where you again give props to Snowden</p>
<p>for stepping up.</p>
<p>100%, 100%.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the origin of the suspender wearing Batman?</p>
<p>How did you come to do what you do?</p>
<p>We talked about where you are and how your mind works,</p>
<p>but how did it start?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of always been interested in fraud</p>
<p>or at least I saw fraud early on</p>
<p>and I was just like curious about what is this?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what I was really looking at.</p>
<p>So basically my mom got cancer when I was in high school</p>
<p>and it was pretty traumatic.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>She had thyroid cancer, which is,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know it at the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like cancer is cancer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fairly easily treatable with surgery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the better survivable ones.</p>
<p>And I just watched her get like bombarded</p>
<p>with all these like phony health scams</p>
<p>of just like colloidal silver,</p>
<p>all these different like remedies.</p>
<p>And she was very into all the different ways</p>
<p>that she might treat her cancer.</p>
<p>And obviously surgery is very daunting.</p>
<p>And I was just confused.</p>
<p>I was like, why are we doing so many different remedies</p>
<p>that all seem a very dubious health value?</p>
<p>Later I&rsquo;d find out that these are like all grifters.</p>
<p>I mean, they take advantage of free speech in America</p>
<p>to like advertise their products</p>
<p>as life-saving miracles, whatever,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re of course not.</p>
<p>Eventually she got the surgery, thank God.</p>
<p>But I know people in my life who their parents passed away</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t have the surgery.</p>
<p>They instead took the alternative option.</p>
<p>I know like, I don&rsquo;t wanna go into specifics</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t wanna mention their specific like case,</p>
<p>but their family member went to Mexico</p>
<p>for some alternate treatment, health treatment,</p>
<p>instead of getting an easy surgery and they died.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, I realized,</p>
<p>where is the outrage about this?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the, who covers this stuff?</p>
<p>And I realized, well, not many people do.</p>
<p>Then I went to college,</p>
<p>I was getting a chemical engineering degree</p>
<p>and all my friends were like telling me,</p>
<p>hey, you should come to this meeting.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need this.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re doing this engineering stuff, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna make like 70K a year,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t you wanna get like rich now?</p>
<p>Like why wait till you&rsquo;re 60 years old to retire?</p>
<p>Like you can be rich now, Lex.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d go show up to a hotel and there&rsquo;d be an MLM,</p>
<p>like multi-level marketing pitch for Amway</p>
<p>or whatever it was that day.</p>
<p>And I was once again fascinated.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what I was looking at,</p>
<p>but I was like, what is this weird game we&rsquo;re all playing</p>
<p>where we sit in this room,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at the speaker who says he&rsquo;s so successful.</p>
<p>But why is he taking a Friday or a Saturday</p>
<p>to do this pitch at night?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna telling me I&rsquo;m gonna be financially free,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re working on their Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, how financially free are they?</p>
<p>So I was just like confused.</p>
<p>I was like, none of my friends were rich.</p>
<p>They all said they were gonna be rich.</p>
<p>No one ever seemed to get rich.</p>
<p>And so I was sort of baffled by what I was looking at.</p>
<p>Later, I graduate, I had no interest in doing engineering,</p>
<p>which we can kind of get into,</p>
<p>but I wanna do something in media.</p>
<p>And I started covering a variety of topics,</p>
<p>but eventually I sort of revisited this interest in fraud.</p>
<p>And I started talking about these kind of</p>
<p>get rich quick grifters that were online,</p>
<p>sort of the Tai Lopez variety, 67 steps or whatever,</p>
<p>like five steps to get rich, five coins to 5 million,</p>
<p>these get rich quick schemes</p>
<p>that a lot of people were interested in.</p>
<p>No one seemed to get rich once again,</p>
<p>except for the people at the tippity tippity top</p>
<p>selling the get rich quick thing.</p>
<p>And I was like fascinated by the structure of it.</p>
<p>And I was like, does nobody see what this is?</p>
<p>Like, does nobody get it?</p>
<p>So I started making a series of videos on that</p>
<p>and the response was like palpable.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like, I&rsquo;ve made a lot of stuff before that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d made stuff that got a million views.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d had like some marginal success,</p>
<p>but the response of like the emails that came in,</p>
<p>I could tell this work,</p>
<p>even though it had far less views at the time,</p>
<p>was having a different level of impact.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I was really interested in.</p>
<p>One of my problems with engineering was from my standpoint,</p>
<p>I did chemical engineering at Texas A&amp;M.</p>
<p>And like, I was like,</p>
<p>is my future just gonna be in a chemical plant</p>
<p>improving some process by 2%?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like my gift to the world.</p>
<p>Like I just, I didn&rsquo;t see the hard impact</p>
<p>and that maybe that&rsquo;s a lack of imagination</p>
<p>because chemicals matter,</p>
<p>but I needed, I wanted to see an impact in the world.</p>
<p>And so when like I did start doing this fraud stuff,</p>
<p>exposing fraud, I like clicked in my brain.</p>
<p>I was like, whoa, this is kind of doing what I want to do.</p>
<p>And so I started posting videos.</p>
<p>At first it really focused on like get rich quick scheme,</p>
<p>grifty advertising, which I think is super predatory</p>
<p>and we can go into why,</p>
<p>but it eventually graduated to crypto</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s snowballed I guess,</p>
<p>because now we&rsquo;re talking to Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>Okay, grifty advertising.</p>
<p>So actually there&rsquo;s a step back.</p>
<p>What is a multi-level marketing scheme?</p>
<p>Like what, because I&rsquo;ve experienced a similar thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I remember I worked at,</p>
<p>I sold women&rsquo;s shoes at Sears and a bank.</p>
<p>And I just remember like some kind of,</p>
<p>I forgot the name of the company,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d like, you can sell like knives or whatever.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a couple of-</p>
<p>Oh, I know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of things like this, right?</p>
<p>And I remember feeling a similar thing, like why?</p>
<p>To me what was fascinating about it is like,</p>
<p>wow, like human civilization is a interesting,</p>
<p>like a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t, maybe didn&rsquo;t know the words for that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Like you can like get in a room</p>
<p>and you convince each other of ideas</p>
<p>and you have these ambitions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a general desire, especially when you&rsquo;re young</p>
<p>to like, like life sucks right now.</p>
<p>Nobody respects you.</p>
<p>You have no money and you want to do good.</p>
<p>And you want to be sold this dream of like,</p>
<p>if I work hard enough at this weird thing,</p>
<p>I can shortcut and get to the very top.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>And I also in me felt that like life really sucks</p>
<p>and I can do good and I&rsquo;m lucky I found a way to do good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, and I don&rsquo;t know, you connect with that somehow.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like this weird fire inside people</p>
<p>to like, to make better of themselves, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just an American thing or if it,</p>
<p>but anyway, that was fascinating to me</p>
<p>from a human nature perspective.</p>
<p>Grifters play on this though, right?</p>
<p>Like this is, so the best salesmen play on true narratives</p>
<p>that you already believe.</p>
<p>So the true narrative is, you know, life is unfair.</p>
<p>It is tough.</p>
<p>The American dream as described by go to a job,</p>
<p>work at the same company for 40 years and then retire</p>
<p>to a safety net that you&rsquo;re positive is gonna be there.</p>
<p>That is largely debt.</p>
<p>And so they like play on those fears and those problems</p>
<p>to then sell you a pill, a solution, a thing.</p>
<p>And the problem is that the solution is usually worse</p>
<p>than even the problem they sketched out.</p>
<p>Like you will do better most of the time</p>
<p>by going with the regular company</p>
<p>than you will by going with these goofy</p>
<p>multi-level marketing.</p>
<p>But let me answer your question.</p>
<p>What is a multi-level marketing?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a criticism, first of all, that,</p>
<p>well, let me get to what it is in theory.</p>
<p>Like at its most ideal, multi-level marketing</p>
<p>is where you have a product that you&rsquo;re selling.</p>
<p>And one of the ways you help sell it</p>
<p>is by rather than going through traditional marketing,</p>
<p>like where you go and you put out print advertising,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like sort of a social network of marketing.</p>
<p>I sell to you and then actually Lex,</p>
<p>not only can I sell to you,</p>
<p>you can then go sell this product</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll make money selling it.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>To incentivize me to get other salesmen,</p>
<p>because when I get another salesman,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually giving myself competition.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>So to incentivize me to do that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pay me part of what you make, right?</p>
<p>And then you go out and you go,</p>
<p>okay, well, I can sell this product.</p>
<p>I also can get new salesmen to like sell for me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna make money from you, whatever.</p>
<p>So it goes down the line of you create multiple levels</p>
<p>where you can profit from their marketing, right?</p>
<p>The problem with this system</p>
<p>is that however well-intentioned it is,</p>
<p>is that usually the emphasis of that selling</p>
<p>and making money ends up not being about the product at all</p>
<p>and ends up entirely being about recruiting new people</p>
<p>to recruit new people to recruit new people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real way to make money in multi-level marketing.</p>
<p>This is where the very true criticism</p>
<p>of most multi-level marketing, if not all,</p>
<p>are pyramid schemes in structure.</p>
<p>Because what a pyramid scheme is,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s all about I put in $500</p>
<p>and I recruit two people to put in $500</p>
<p>and that comes up to me.</p>
<p>And they get two people to put in $500 and it goes to them.</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s a flawed business model</p>
<p>is in order for it to work and everyone to make money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to assume an infinite human race.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>Most people end up getting screwed in multi-level marketing</p>
<p>and in pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that thing.</p>
<p>And the quality of the product,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily matter what you&rsquo;re selling.</p>
<p>To people who are financially incentivized</p>
<p>to buy this thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so you&rsquo;re selling the dream of becoming rich</p>
<p>to the people down in the pyramid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real product of multi-level marketing,</p>
<p>unfortunately.</p>
<p>And so you look at the statistics of these companies</p>
<p>and although they&rsquo;ll make it seem like it&rsquo;s so easy</p>
<p>to be the top 0.1% who&rsquo;s making all this money,</p>
<p>the statistics are that 97% make less</p>
<p>than a minimum wage doing this.</p>
<p>They spend an enormous amount of time.</p>
<p>And just what&rsquo;s so cruel about it is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not advertised upfront.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like if I go work at McDonald&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I know what I&rsquo;m getting.</p>
<p>If I go work at Amway, I have visions of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve sold me visions of beaches and whatever</p>
<p>and more than likely I&rsquo;m losing money.</p>
<p>So better than 50% of people lose money,</p>
<p>but 97% of people make less than minimum wage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a bad business</p>
<p>for the vast majority of people who join it</p>
<p>and the people at the very top</p>
<p>who are lying to the people at the bottom</p>
<p>saying they all can do it when they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>are making all the money.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s really messed up.</p>
<p>The interesting thing I&rsquo;ve noticed,</p>
<p>maybe myself too,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve participated in the knife selling</p>
<p>for a short amount of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the experience that most people have.</p>
<p>Is that Cutco, is it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was Cutco.</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s killing me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several variations of it.</p>
<p>I think I was part of a less popular one.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, I keep wanting to say it was called Vector.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes.</p>
<p>Something with a V was what I was gonna say.</p>
<p>It might be Vector.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get what you&rsquo;re saying though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a multi-level marketing knife selling.</p>
<p>But the thing is,</p>
<p>I just remember my own small experience with it</p>
<p>is I was too, I was embarrassed at myself</p>
<p>for having like participated.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an embarrassment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people down in the pyramid</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like speak about it, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand the aspects of human nature</p>
<p>that facilitate this.</p>
<p>Well, this is one of the problems with fraud</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a tremendous embarrassment to being had.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Also, if you buy,</p>
<p>so slightly different human nature</p>
<p>is that if you buy into a get-rich-quick scheme</p>
<p>and then it doesn&rsquo;t deliver,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to blame yourself</p>
<p>than blame the product for not actually working.</p>
<p>You go, well, there must be something flawed with me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And they constantly reinforce this.</p>
<p>They go, well, it&rsquo;s all about your hard work.</p>
<p>The system works.</p>
<p>Look at me, I did it.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re failing,</p>
<p>it must be some indictment of your character</p>
<p>and you have to always double down.</p>
<p>You have to double, the system can&rsquo;t be flawed.</p>
<p>You must be flawed.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, it&rsquo;s a really messed up system.</p>
<p>It really preys on people&rsquo;s psychology</p>
<p>to keep them in this loop.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why in some ways these things are so viral,</p>
<p>even though they don&rsquo;t actually get most people</p>
<p>a significant amount of wealth</p>
<p>and they cost most people money.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very unfortunate.</p>
<p>Most people do have the dream of becoming rich.</p>
<p>Most young people.</p>
<p>Right, and the thing is,</p>
<p>is that everyone knows in business, what do you sell?</p>
<p>You sell solutions to problems.</p>
<p>So if so many young people wanna get rich,</p>
<p>the product is that pitch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you sell them the dream.</p>
<p>Why this gets so grifty and so cruel and predatory</p>
<p>is because there is no easy solution to this.</p>
<p>There is no solution that people are gonna buy</p>
<p>because the real solution people want is no work,</p>
<p>no education, no skills required, no money upfront.</p>
<p>And people will pay any price for that magic pill</p>
<p>and people are happy to sell that magic pill.</p>
<p>And I think those people are very cruel</p>
<p>and I think deserve to get exposed for it.</p>
<p>So somebody that&rsquo;s been criticized</p>
<p>for MLM type schemes is Andrew Tate.</p>
<p>Somebody that I&rsquo;m very likely to talk with.</p>
<p>So for people who have been telling me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m too afraid to talk to Andrew Tate,</p>
<p>first of all, let me just say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid to talk to anyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that certain people require preparation</p>
<p>and you have to allocate your life in such a way</p>
<p>that you wanna prepare properly for them.</p>
<p>And so you have to kinda think who you want to prepare for.</p>
<p>Because I have other folks that have more power</p>
<p>than this particular figure that I&rsquo;m preparing for.</p>
<p>So you have to make sure you allocate your time wisely.</p>
<p>But I do think he&rsquo;s a very influential person</p>
<p>that raises questions of what it means</p>
<p>to be a man in the 21st century.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very important and interesting question</p>
<p>because young people look up to philosophers,</p>
<p>to influencers about what it means to be a man.</p>
<p>They look up to Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>they look up to Andrew Tate,</p>
<p>they look up to others, to other figures.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important to talk about that,</p>
<p>to think what does it mean to be a good man in the society?</p>
<p>Of course, in the other gender, there&rsquo;s the same question,</p>
<p>what does it mean to be a good woman?</p>
<p>I think obviously the bigger question</p>
<p>is what does it mean to be a good person?</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the men podcast.</p>
<p>I swear to God.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re into, okay.</p>
<p>So that said, one aspect of the criticism</p>
<p>that Andrew&rsquo;s received is not just on the misogyny,</p>
<p>is on the MLM aspect of the multi-level marketing schemes.</p>
<p>So is there some truth to that?</p>
<p>Is there some fraudulent aspect to that?</p>
<p>So yeah, I definitely think so.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the main reason I criticized him.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s back up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few clarifications I need to make.</p>
<p>What Andrew Tait is selling is not multi-level marketing,</p>
<p>although he is selling the dream.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s selling an affiliate marketing thing,</p>
<p>which is slightly different.</p>
<p>So in multi-level marketing, if I sell to you</p>
<p>and then you go sell to two other people,</p>
<p>I make money from those two other people down the chain,</p>
<p>multi-level.</p>
<p>Affiliate marketing is sort of like one level.</p>
<p>I only make money.</p>
<p>So Andrew Tait had this affiliate program</p>
<p>where if you sold Hustlers University to somebody else,</p>
<p>which sounds like something people would,</p>
<p>boomers would put on Facebook in like 2010,</p>
<p>I went to Hustlers University.</p>
<p>School of Hardware.</p>
<p>By the way, you were a member of Hustlers University.</p>
<p>Yeah, I joined.</p>
<p>I joined.</p>
<p>I became a Hustler.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in large part due to why I&rsquo;m so successful</p>
<p>is because of my Hustler University membership.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>But so it&rsquo;s an affiliate program.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d sell, like I sell to you this $50 course</p>
<p>and I make like $5 and Andrew Tait in perpetuity</p>
<p>makes $50 a month off of you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What does this course actually sell, right?</p>
<p>Because ultimately he&rsquo;s selling the dream.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s selling, hey, the matrix has enslaved you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really gone down this like neo rabbit hole.</p>
<p>So the matrix has enslaved you.</p>
<p>Your life is controlled by these people</p>
<p>who want to keep you like kind of weak,</p>
<p>you know, lazy, whatever.</p>
<p>You need to break out and you need to achieve</p>
<p>the new dream, which is sort of like</p>
<p>hustling your way to the top.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need the antiquated systems of school.</p>
<p>You can just pay me $50 a month</p>
<p>and I will teach you everything.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what do you actually get?</p>
<p>Well, and why is it a scam?</p>
<p>So you actually, I think it&rsquo;s just a scam</p>
<p>in terms of like value and like you&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>based on these completely unrealistic things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s get rich.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You get a series of discord rooms.</p>
<p>So you, do you know what discord?</p>
<p>Most people know what discord is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a bunch of, you know, chat rooms basically.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like AOL or is it like?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m talking to the guy who quit Emacs.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s discord servers.</p>
<p>And in these, like, there&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like seven different rooms you can go in</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s several rooms</p>
<p>and each one is like a different field of making money.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>E-commerce, trading, cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>I think fulfillment by Amazon, like copywriting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I went to all of these, I checked them out.</p>
<p>I checked out all their money-making tools.</p>
<p>The first funny thing is that Andrew Tate</p>
<p>is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>The supposed successful guy that you like bought into</p>
<p>is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these professors that you have now,</p>
<p>he is hired and said, these guys are super qualified.</p>
<p>So like looked up some of what some of these guys have done</p>
<p>and some of them have launched like scammy crypto coins.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency professor was like shilling</p>
<p>a bunch of coins that did bad</p>
<p>and then like deleted the tweets.</p>
<p>I mean, just completely exactly what you&rsquo;d expect.</p>
<p>Behind the paywall, it&rsquo;s nothing of substance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna learn to get rich by escaping the matrix</p>
<p>and going to work for Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>Fulfillment by Amazon is not escaping the matrix, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not the way to hustle to the top.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally a field of making money</p>
<p>that everyone in the world has access to.</p>
<p>If you wanna differentiate yourself and make money,</p>
<p>the first thing you realize is going into skill sets</p>
<p>that literally anyone with an internet account can do</p>
<p>is a bad way to do that</p>
<p>because you have to have some differentiating factor</p>
<p>to add value.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just such a obvious and complete skill set</p>
<p>scam because there is no value</p>
<p>to this like so-called education.</p>
<p>The professors are crap.</p>
<p>The advice, they&rsquo;re like hiding</p>
<p>some of the bad things they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and Andrew Tate&rsquo;s nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that&rsquo;s why everyone joins.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s done is very interesting because,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll give him credit in his marketing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been very savvy to like make the reasons</p>
<p>you admire him, not the thing he&rsquo;s sort of selling,</p>
<p>which is weird.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s selling get rich quick,</p>
<p>which seems like it relates to his persona,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually very orthogonal to it.</p>
<p>His persona is like the tell it how it is,</p>
<p>like tall, buff, rich guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like actually his persona that you&rsquo;re buying into.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s selling you this thing to the side,</p>
<p>which when people get in there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not delivered on the product,</p>
<p>he still is those things that you first thought he was.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I think it&rsquo;s to some extent,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s made a lot of money by making the thing</p>
<p>that he makes money on,</p>
<p>not the thing he gets so much pushback online for</p>
<p>and what he&rsquo;s also loved for.</p>
<p>So people will push back for his misogyny,</p>
<p>but the real way he&rsquo;s making money is just like basic,</p>
<p>get rich quick schemes that are super obvious to spot,</p>
<p>but everyone&rsquo;s distracted by like,</p>
<p>oh, he said some crazy stuff about women</p>
<p>or all these various other scandals he&rsquo;s gotten himself in.</p>
<p>To get more and more and more attention.</p>
<p>So with the persona,</p>
<p>is the Hustler University still operating?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve rebranded it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part of their pitch now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, they put me on as like,</p>
<p>I mean, as like, the Matrix is trying to take us out, Lex.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s me saying like,</p>
<p>you know, they put me in like saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m part of the Matrix.</p>
<p>They put me in saying, oh, this guy sucks.</p>
<p>You know, I joined, it sucks.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ll play that and they do like a bass drop</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t listen to people like this, dah, dah, dah, dah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m basically like a-</p>
<p>Oh, so you&rsquo;ve been co-opted by the Matrix to attack.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an insider threat that infiltrated</p>
<p>and now is being used by the Matrix to attack him.</p>
<p>Well, to-</p>
<p>Everyone who criticizes him as part of the Matrix,</p>
<p>he won&rsquo;t say who the Matrix is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s just the shadowy cabal</p>
<p>of rich, powerful people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the easy narrative</p>
<p>for people who are disaffected</p>
<p>and who feel cheated by the system.</p>
<p>You just collectivize that system</p>
<p>and you make it the bad guy and you go, look, look,</p>
<p>those guys, those guys who have been cheating you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the bad guys.</p>
<p>They want me shut up.</p>
<p>And then now the person that, the people who harmed you,</p>
<p>they want this guy shut up, you&rsquo;re gonna listen to him.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like the most basic</p>
<p>psychological manipulation</p>
<p>that everyone seems to constantly fall for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really trivial and stupid, but-</p>
<p>Can you steel man the case for Husserl&rsquo;s University</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s actually giving young people confidence,</p>
<p>teaching invaluable lessons about like,</p>
<p>actually incentivizing them</p>
<p>to do something like Fulfillment by Amazon,</p>
<p>the basic thing to try it, to learn about it,</p>
<p>to fail or maybe see like, to try,</p>
<p>to give a catalyst and incentive to try these things.</p>
<p>As much as it pains me, I will try to give a succinct,</p>
<p>maybe steel man of it as best as I can</p>
<p>thinking that it&rsquo;s such a grift.</p>
<p>But I think what you would say is that some people</p>
<p>in order to make a change in their life</p>
<p>need someone who they can look up to.</p>
<p>And men don&rsquo;t have a lot of like strong role models,</p>
<p>like big male presences in their life</p>
<p>who can serve as a proper example.</p>
<p>So the most charitable interpretation would be,</p>
<p>Andrew Tate would encourage you</p>
<p>to go reach for the stars, I guess.</p>
<p>My problem is I have a deep,</p>
<p>I have a deep issue with the like,</p>
<p>lust and greed that centers all these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this glorification of wealth equals status,</p>
<p>wealth equals good person,</p>
<p>wealth and Bugatti equals you are meaningful, you matter.</p>
<p>And like the dark underlying thing</p>
<p>is that none of that, none of that matters.</p>
<p>Like it matters that you make a decent living,</p>
<p>but past just like that,</p>
<p>I think the like lust for more stuff</p>
<p>and the idolization of these people</p>
<p>that is just like opulence is a net bad.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like my steel man has to stop there</p>
<p>because I really disagree with like the values</p>
<p>that are pushed by people like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I agree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that should be criticized.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just like an amazing meal</p>
<p>at a great restaurant, it matters.</p>
<p>Money and Bugattis for many people make life beautiful.</p>
<p>Like those are all components,</p>
<p>but I think money isn&rsquo;t the,</p>
<p>you can also enjoy a beautiful life on a hike in nature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to enjoy life.</p>
<p>And one of the deepest has been tested through time</p>
<p>is the intimacy, close connection,</p>
<p>friendship with other people or with a loved one.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t talk about like love.</p>
<p>Like what it means to be deeply connected</p>
<p>with another person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like get women, get money,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But that, I think, I don&rsquo;t want to dismiss that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like value in that, there&rsquo;s fun in that.</p>
<p>I think the positive,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t investigated Hustlers University,</p>
<p>but the positive I see in general is young people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get much respect from society.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s easy to call it the matrix and so on,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a kind of dismissal of them as human beings,</p>
<p>as if capable of contributing, of doing anything special.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s, you have young people</p>
<p>who are sitting there broke with big dreams.</p>
<p>They need the mentors, they need somebody to inspire them.</p>
<p>So like I would criticize the flawed nature of the message,</p>
<p>but also it&rsquo;s just like you have to realize</p>
<p>like there needs to be institutions or people</p>
<p>or influencers that help like inspire, right?</p>
<p>The problem is though,</p>
<p>is the people who are pitching unrealistic versions of that</p>
<p>are getting a lot of attention,</p>
<p>whereas like there&rsquo;s so many great free courses</p>
<p>where you can learn everything and more</p>
<p>about fulfillment by Amazon or about copywriting</p>
<p>or all these different things</p>
<p>that I think like so often the air is just,</p>
<p>the oxygen is sucked up by all the grifters</p>
<p>who promise everything.</p>
<p>Back to what we said about vaporware.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons that like educational products</p>
<p>can so often be co-opted by grifters</p>
<p>is vaporware is very hard to distinguish</p>
<p>because like the feedback loop on education is not clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious immediately.</p>
<p>So I can sell you a book and I can say,</p>
<p>this is gonna change your life if you apply it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t, if your life doesn&rsquo;t change,</p>
<p>I just say, well, you didn&rsquo;t apply it, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this weird relationship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear the value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so easy to like quantify education.</p>
<p>So that gets co-opted by people who make all the promises.</p>
<p>They get a ton of attention, a ton of money.</p>
<p>And then those people are often left confused</p>
<p>and like kind of disillusioned,</p>
<p>maybe thinking, well, this didn&rsquo;t work in one year,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not gonna work at all.</p>
<p>And so I think, yeah, there are problems there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly a need for like male role models.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly a need for somebody kind of</p>
<p>to speak to a younger generation.</p>
<p>I just think that person shouldn&rsquo;t be maybe Andrew Tate,</p>
<p>like personally.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you have to criticize</p>
<p>those particular individuals.</p>
<p>I also-</p>
<p>And yeah, I think that like the Bugatti aspiration</p>
<p>is so stupid.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s so-</p>
<p>Let me steal Matt.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a person who doesn&rsquo;t care about money,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like money.</p>
<p>The women maybe appreciate the sort of the beauty</p>
<p>of the other sex,</p>
<p>but like, yeah, cars in particular is like,</p>
<p>really, is this really the manifestation</p>
<p>of all the highest accomplishments</p>
<p>a human being can have in life?</p>
<p>Yes, I can criticize all that.</p>
<p>But to steal Matt in that case is,</p>
<p>a young person, a dreamer has ambition.</p>
<p>And I often find that education throughout my whole life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been people who love me,</p>
<p>teachers who saw ambition in me</p>
<p>and try to reason with me</p>
<p>that my ambition is not justified.</p>
<p>Looking at the data, look, kid, you&rsquo;re not that special.</p>
<p>Look at the data.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, and they want you to like,</p>
<p>not dream, essentially.</p>
<p>And then again, I look at the data,</p>
<p>which is all the people,</p>
<p>I just talked to Hodger Gracie.</p>
<p>This, Hodger Gracie is just a person,</p>
<p>widely acknowledged as probably the greatest of all time,</p>
<p>dominated everybody.</p>
<p>But for the longest time, he sucked.</p>
<p>And he was surrounded by people</p>
<p>that kind of don&rsquo;t necessarily believe in him,</p>
<p>so he had to believe in himself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to have somebody,</p>
<p>I just, as older I get and I&rsquo;ve seen it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so powerful to have somebody who comes to you,</p>
<p>an older person, whether it&rsquo;s real or not,</p>
<p>that says, you got this, kid, I believe in you.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, so I think dreaming</p>
<p>is actually really important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more protective over,</p>
<p>people co-opt those dreams for money.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And like, I do think it matters so much</p>
<p>that we encourage people to take risks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the great things about America</p>
<p>is it lionizes like sort of people</p>
<p>who have taken risks and won.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s just a weird vapid thing</p>
<p>when like the reason you do all of it</p>
<p>is for this thing you can get out at the end of the day.</p>
<p>When we all know,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve just heard a million interviews,</p>
<p>like nobody ever gets through Bugatti and goes,</p>
<p>this now completely fulfills me.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the beauty and the fulfillment</p>
<p>actually comes from becoming obsessed</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re doing for its own sake,</p>
<p>sort of the journey, the beauty of that thing.</p>
<p>And I think money&rsquo;s just this thing we have to deal with</p>
<p>to be able to do cool stuff.</p>
<p>Like I acknowledge that, you know,</p>
<p>you need money to build a $10 million studio.</p>
<p>Like you gotta get the cameras,</p>
<p>you gotta get the lights.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very blessed to be able to have gotten that.</p>
<p>But past a certain point,</p>
<p>like I think that is really the function of money</p>
<p>is to just do cool stuff.</p>
<p>But ultimately if you can&rsquo;t fall in love with the process</p>
<p>and like the craft itself,</p>
<p>you will be left very unhappy at the end of it.</p>
<p>And so to start people off on that journey</p>
<p>by pointing to the shiny object</p>
<p>and going like, that&rsquo;s what you should care about,</p>
<p>seems to me so backwards.</p>
<p>We should learn from the actual people who have done it</p>
<p>and said, that shiny thing did nothing for me.</p>
<p>Learn to love the journey</p>
<p>and like, that&rsquo;s the thing we pitch people.</p>
<p>As unsexy as that might be.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well said.</p>
<p>And the same applies to like the Red Pill community</p>
<p>that talks about dating and so on.</p>
<p>That there is, it&rsquo;s not just about the number of hot women</p>
<p>you go to bed with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about intimacy and love</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And so like, there&rsquo;s components to a fulfilling life</p>
<p>that is important to sort of educate young people about.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>But at the same time, feeding the dream</p>
<p>is saying take big risks.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And you, the little you</p>
<p>that has no evidence of ever being great, can be great.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s evidence time and time again</p>
<p>of people that come from very humble beginnings</p>
<p>and doing incredible things that change the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s just a tremendous like funny thing</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t become great</p>
<p>without having a willful denial of the statistics.</p>
<p>Like in some ways you have to take the chance,</p>
<p>even if that chance is so improbable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always those people who did take that chance</p>
<p>who end up winning, so I agree.</p>
<p>Probably SBF and FTX is the biggest thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever covered,</p>
<p>but previously you&rsquo;ve called the Save the Kids scam</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s influencer scam,</p>
<p>like the biggest in the world</p>
<p>influencer scam you&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Can you describe it?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So Save the Kids was a charity coin</p>
<p>that was launched by a number</p>
<p>of extremely popular influencers.</p>
<p>I think they had over 50 million followers together.</p>
<p>Huge names.</p>
<p>And they basically said,</p>
<p>hey guys, invest in this coin,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna save the kids.</p>
<p>A portion of the proceeds go to charity.</p>
<p>And this coin, it&rsquo;s unruggable.</p>
<p>So rugging is the term for,</p>
<p>remember earlier we talked about Safemoon,</p>
<p>you just grab the pool of funds in the middle</p>
<p>and you take them out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unruggable because we have this smart code</p>
<p>that is gonna prevent people who are quote whales,</p>
<p>which is a crypto term for saying</p>
<p>you have a large portion of the tokens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll prevent those people from selling</p>
<p>a large amount of that at one time, right?</p>
<p>And so basically you don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about trusting us.</p>
<p>It just is what it is.</p>
<p>Join and we will change the world,</p>
<p>save the kids, whatever.</p>
<p>It was really skeezy from the beginning</p>
<p>and sketchy because their logo matched</p>
<p>the Save the Children logo,</p>
<p>which is like an actual charity that,</p>
<p>so they basically copied it</p>
<p>and said we&rsquo;re saving the kids,</p>
<p>like a knockoff brand.</p>
<p>And almost immediately the project rugged.</p>
<p>They stole the money and tracing back through</p>
<p>the code was changed at the last second before launch.</p>
<p>Like if you looked at their code</p>
<p>that they launched as a test</p>
<p>versus the code they launched in actuality,</p>
<p>they changed only like two lines</p>
<p>and it was the whale code</p>
<p>to basically make the whale code non-existent.</p>
<p>Like you can sell as much as you want,</p>
<p>as fast as you want.</p>
<p>And it turned out that some of the influencers</p>
<p>had not only sold that and made money,</p>
<p>but also had a pattern of pump and dumping tokens.</p>
<p>So we can talk about what that is like.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s pump and dump?</p>
<p>A pump and dump is just where,</p>
<p>you have a huge following,</p>
<p>you promote your little Lex coin to everybody</p>
<p>while holding a big portion of it.</p>
<p>And as everyone rushes in to buy it,</p>
<p>the price is gonna pump</p>
<p>and you dump at the same time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the name comes from, pump and dump.</p>
<p>You pump the price, sell all your tokens,</p>
<p>make a lot of money.</p>
<p>So I traced basically their wallets on the blockchain</p>
<p>and found that two of the actors specifically</p>
<p>had had a long history of doing this,</p>
<p>which really proved malicious intent.</p>
<p>And why I called it the worst is not,</p>
<p>it certainly wasn&rsquo;t the worst in terms of like</p>
<p>the amount of people affected.</p>
<p>It relatively was like a small pump and dump</p>
<p>because it rugged almost immediately.</p>
<p>But in terms of the amount of people</p>
<p>that were involved in it,</p>
<p>in terms of the amount of malicious behavior before it</p>
<p>that like sort of proved that this wasn&rsquo;t an accident,</p>
<p>the fact that there was like this whale code,</p>
<p>it was one of the most cynical attempts</p>
<p>to just take the money of the followers you had</p>
<p>and just like, that&rsquo;s mine now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I called it that, but that&rsquo;s to save the kids.</p>
<p>So that was-</p>
<p>That was a lot of the FaZe members.</p>
<p>And it was, I think Addison Rae.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people who seemed like</p>
<p>they were kind of taking shrapnel on it.</p>
<p>There was like this guy, Tico,</p>
<p>who he didn&rsquo;t even sell the tokens.</p>
<p>He just like held onto it the entire time</p>
<p>and lost like a few thousand dollars or maybe even,</p>
<p>I forget the exact amount.</p>
<p>He lost a lot of money, a decent amount.</p>
<p>And so like, he took a lot of shrapnel with that,</p>
<p>but there were also people who were maliciously doing this.</p>
<p>So in that investigation,</p>
<p>like several of the members of FaZe got kicked out.</p>
<p>One of them got like permanently banned.</p>
<p>And then this other guy that I talked about</p>
<p>fled the country.</p>
<p>Like he sold all his belongings and like fled the country</p>
<p>and, you know, hid out in London or wherever he is now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know where he is.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the UK area.</p>
<p>So the basic idea there is to try to convert</p>
<p>your influence into money.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic idea behind</p>
<p>a lot of influencer crypto promotions.</p>
<p>Well, but, right.</p>
<p>But that little word influencer means something.</p>
<p>Because there are most crypto scams,</p>
<p>influencer scams, they&rsquo;re not, right?</p>
<p>Most kind of-</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The most high profile ones, like just by nature,</p>
<p>they tend to be made high profile by the influencer.</p>
<p>So sometimes they are, but you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>A lot of money has been lost and like nobody finds out</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no one big sort of attached to it.</p>
<p>They just steal a lot of money.</p>
<p>But influencers are great salespeople</p>
<p>because like in order to overcome the resistance</p>
<p>of getting you to buy some random coin,</p>
<p>there has to be a reason.</p>
<p>And so much of the 21st century content creator generation</p>
<p>is defined by these strange parasocial relationships</p>
<p>where people feel like they know you,</p>
<p>not the character you play, but you,</p>
<p>and you have some friendship with them.</p>
<p>When in actuality, you don&rsquo;t know the viewers.</p>
<p>You know, you have a sense,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t actually know all of these people.</p>
<p>And so that relationship is extremely powerful</p>
<p>in terms of persuasion.</p>
<p>So you can say, I believe in this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve watched you for years.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden I say, if Lex believes in it,</p>
<p>I believe in it.</p>
<p>I trust him as a human.</p>
<p>And so that differentiates these coins.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden the coin blows up, gets really popular.</p>
<p>You made this side deal and you make a ton of money.</p>
<p>I have to say podcasting in particular is an intimacy.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a huge fan of podcasts</p>
<p>and I feel like I&rsquo;m friends with the people I listen to.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And boy, is that a responsibility.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it really hurts me to announce</p>
<p>that I am launching LexCoin.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, man.</p>
<p>I hate money.</p>
<p>I hate this kind of, the schemingness of all of this,</p>
<p>the use of any kind of degree of fame</p>
<p>that you have for that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something just-</p>
<p>What makes it so like frustrating is these people-</p>
<p>Disgusting.</p>
<p>I have a general sense of what they were like,</p>
<p>sort of what I&rsquo;m in the,</p>
<p>even though I wouldn&rsquo;t describe myself as an influencer,</p>
<p>I make content on YouTube.</p>
<p>I know that, especially since they were taking</p>
<p>these huge corporate sponsorships,</p>
<p>they were making tons of money.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have need for these scams.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s one thing to scam</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like broke on the street, you know,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re playing three card Monty to like live.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a whole other ethically cruel thing to do</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re basically trying to upgrade your penthouse</p>
<p>to the building next door.</p>
<p>And like, you&rsquo;re already well off</p>
<p>and you just kind of want to get even further ahead.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where-</p>
<p>Well, this is the fascinating thing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate recently</p>
<p>to sort of get, you know, whatever, a larger platform.</p>
<p>And when you find out, it&rsquo;s like, life is amazing.</p>
<p>I always thought life is amazing,</p>
<p>but it becomes more amazing.</p>
<p>Like, you meet so many cool people and so on.</p>
<p>But what you start getting is you have more opportunities</p>
<p>to like, yeah, like scammers will come to you</p>
<p>and then try to use you, right?</p>
<p>And I could see for somebody it could be tempting</p>
<p>to be like, ooh, it&rsquo;d be nice to make some money.</p>
<p>I wanted to say like on this kind of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on this topic of opportunities you get,</p>
<p>you know, kind of when you get a platform.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons kind of I railed</p>
<p>a little bit earlier against materialism or whatever,</p>
<p>I think to the extent to which</p>
<p>you can moderate your own greed,</p>
<p>you can play longer term games.</p>
<p>And I think so many people end up cutting</p>
<p>an otherwise promising career short</p>
<p>by just wanting it too fast.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s like a huge edge,</p>
<p>just like discipline is in terms</p>
<p>of like achieving what you want.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m like a very moderate,</p>
<p>like being comfortable with a moderate existence</p>
<p>and finding happiness in that is a huge edge</p>
<p>because really your overhead is so much cheaper</p>
<p>than the people who need a Ferrari</p>
<p>or a super nice house to feel fulfilled.</p>
<p>And when your overhead is less,</p>
<p>you have the luxury to say no to like sketchy offers.</p>
<p>You have freedom that other people don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>because a lot of times people don&rsquo;t pitch it this way.</p>
<p>They pitch a Ferrari as freedom</p>
<p>or like a big house is like you&rsquo;ve made it.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, those shackle you back</p>
<p>to like you got to find the cashflow for those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never a free ride.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really beautifully put.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that I had fuck you money</p>
<p>at the very beginning.</p>
<p>I was broke for most of my life.</p>
<p>The way you have fuck you money</p>
<p>is by not needing much to say fuck you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the overhead that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>If you can live simply and be truly happy</p>
<p>and be truly free,</p>
<p>I think that means you could be free</p>
<p>in any kind of situation.</p>
<p>You could make the wise kind of decisions.</p>
<p>And in that case, money enables you</p>
<p>in certain ways to do more cool stuff,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t shackle you like you said.</p>
<p>Too many people in this society you would shackle</p>
<p>because material possessions kind of like</p>
<p>draw you into this race of more and more and more and more.</p>
<p>And then you feel the burden of that,</p>
<p>bigger houses and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Now you have to keep working.</p>
<p>Now you have to keep doing this thing.</p>
<p>Now you have to make more money.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a YouTube channel and so on,</p>
<p>you have to get more.</p>
<p>And the same, it&rsquo;s not even just about money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I deliberately don&rsquo;t check views and likes</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t want that dopamine of pulling you in.</p>
<p>I have to do the thing that gets more and more attention</p>
<p>or more and more like, yeah, like money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so wise, yeah, agreed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge negative hit on your ability to do creative work.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about that?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m always interested in this.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s funny because when you abstract yourself out</p>
<p>to the people you admire and respect</p>
<p>who inspired you to do the creative work you do,</p>
<p>you never think about like the views they were getting</p>
<p>or the money they were making</p>
<p>or the influence they had.</p>
<p>All you ever think about is the work itself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny when a lot of people get in this position,</p>
<p>your temptation is to focus on that which you can measure,</p>
<p>which is like all the stuff you said,</p>
<p>like the likes, the views.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not actually the target or what you got into it for.</p>
<p>If you get into it for like,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re inspired or whatever,</p>
<p>your goal is inspiration, it&rsquo;s impact.</p>
<p>And like that can&rsquo;t be quantified that same way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting, you have to find a way</p>
<p>as a creator of any of this stuff</p>
<p>to like deliberately detach yourself from the measurable</p>
<p>and focus on this thing, which is kind of abstract.</p>
<p>And I was wondering if you have any like ideas for that.</p>
<p>So one, yeah, there&rsquo;s a bunch of ideas.</p>
<p>So one is figure out ways where you don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>the number of views on things.</p>
<p>So I wrote a Chrome extension for myself</p>
<p>that hides the number of views.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really funny.</p>
<p>No, what&rsquo;s funny is I have-</p>
<p>For me, cause it&rsquo;s useful for other people&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>Right, oh my gosh, I&rsquo;m gonna need to borrow this.</p>
<p>That was my problem.</p>
<p>I actually have some Chrome extensions for,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t like going down like recommendation rabbit</p>
<p>holes when I&rsquo;m at work.</p>
<p>I just wanna like search for a video, find it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna see like all the up next</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ll waste time.</p>
<p>So I use Chrome extensions for that.</p>
<p>But the views is a problem because it&rsquo;s relevant</p>
<p>to me as a creator.</p>
<p>Like, is this a big video?</p>
<p>Is it a-</p>
<p>Yeah, which is why I really hurt when they remove</p>
<p>like likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>Cause I wanna know for tutorials and so on what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s probably really useful</p>
<p>for you, the dislikes, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have that?</p>
<p>Do you ever considered making that Chrome extension public?</p>
<p>Sure, actually, yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be a good philosophy behind it, right?</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;re a creator-</p>
<p>I really like it.</p>
<p>I love the idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted this thing before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it necessarily exists.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve made a Chrome extension public.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be cool.</p>
<p>I would love to see, yeah, I would go to that process</p>
<p>of adding it to the, cause I love like open sourcing stuff.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;ll go add it to the Chrome extension,</p>
<p>like the store.</p>
<p>Yeah, cause I totally have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve hated this for like a long time.</p>
<p>YouTube made a change and they just continue</p>
<p>to make the analytics front and center,</p>
<p>which makes sense from their perspective.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to give people better data</p>
<p>on what is successful and what makes something successful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to train their creators,</p>
<p>but in the process, it can lead to some unhealthy habits</p>
<p>of thinking views, define a video.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve long thought, okay, I&rsquo;ve learned analytics.</p>
<p>I understand retention.</p>
<p>Now I sort of want to do like the Zen,</p>
<p>like forget it all now.</p>
<p>And you can only do that if it&rsquo;s out of your sight.</p>
<p>Depends how many friends you have who are creatives.</p>
<p>The other really important thing,</p>
<p>and I found this, this has nothing to do with creatives,</p>
<p>but people I respect very much in my life,</p>
<p>some of them people would know that they could be famous.</p>
<p>They will come to me and say,</p>
<p>they will comment on how popular a video was on YouTube.</p>
<p>They will sort of compliment.</p>
<p>The success.</p>
<p>The success defined by the popularity.</p>
<p>Even for a podcast where most of the listenership</p>
<p>is not on YouTube or Spotify now is getting crazy.</p>
<p>They will still compliment the YouTube number.</p>
<p>So one of the deliberate things I do is I either,</p>
<p>depending if it&rsquo;s a close friend,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get offended and made fun of them for that.</p>
<p>And to sort of signal to them,</p>
<p>this is not the right thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>And for people more like strangers</p>
<p>that compliment that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>I show zero interest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t receive the compliment well.</p>
<p>And I focus on the aspects of the compliment</p>
<p>that have to do with like, what do they find interesting?</p>
<p>Like, you know, I kind of make them,</p>
<p>reveal to them that you shouldn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about the number of views.</p>
<p>It is strange.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like this weird hypnotism that happens</p>
<p>once you get past a certain number.</p>
<p>And that number is some approximation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s always like hard numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 100,000, a million, 10 million.</p>
<p>People just see a number and they just go like,</p>
<p>wow, that is, and they assign a quality to it</p>
<p>that may not, like, it usually means nothing at all.</p>
<p>So I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been good at like handling that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, thank you?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>That said, I do admire, very different for me,</p>
<p>but I admire Mr. Beast who unapologetically says like,</p>
<p>the number is all that matters.</p>
<p>Like basically the number shows,</p>
<p>like the number of views you get shows like how much,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, joy you brought to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>Because if they watched the thing,</p>
<p>they kept watching the thing.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t turn to now.</p>
<p>That means they loved it.</p>
<p>You brought value to their life.</p>
<p>You brought enjoyment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to bring the maximum amount of enjoyment</p>
<p>to the maximum number of the people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to do the most epic videos</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So I admire that when you&rsquo;re so unapologetically</p>
<p>into the numbers.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s sort of, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, gosh, we&rsquo;re getting way too in the way tonight.</p>
<p>Is this a bad, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like constantly self-monitoring</p>
<p>about like what topics we&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>But if we can, Mr. Beast is so interesting</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s almost done what,</p>
<p>have you ever seen Moneyball?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the story of how someone brought statistics</p>
<p>to baseball and it revolutionized everything.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Moneyballed YouTube.</p>
<p>He took statistics to YouTube and it changed everything.</p>
<p>And everybody now, so many people are playing catch up.</p>
<p>I think it would be interesting in a few years</p>
<p>to see how he develops.</p>
<p>And now that he&rsquo;s like kind of revolutionized</p>
<p>like the data side of things,</p>
<p>how he then approaches future videos.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a point at which you&rsquo;ve optimized,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve optimized.</p>
<p>But optimizing for short-term video performance</p>
<p>is not the same as optimizing</p>
<p>for long-term viewer happiness.</p>
<p>And how do you do that?</p>
<p>Assuming the YouTube algorithm</p>
<p>does not perfectly already do it for you, which it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re trying to obviously do that,</p>
<p>optimize for long-term happiness.</p>
<p>And also growing, optimize for long-term creative growth.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I think the thing that people don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know enough about Jimmy.</p>
<p>But to me, the thing that seems to be special about him</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the money ball aspect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like taking the data seriously.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s the part of the idea generation.</p>
<p>The constant brainstorming and coming up with videos.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice to connect the idea generation with the data.</p>
<p>But how many people, when they create on YouTube</p>
<p>and other platforms,</p>
<p>really generate a huge amount of ideas?</p>
<p>Like constantly brainstorm.</p>
<p>Constantly, constantly brainstorm.</p>
<p>At least for me, I don&rsquo;t think I go</p>
<p>so many steps ahead in my thinking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t try to come up with all possible conversations.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t come up with all possible videos I can make.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t, so the one mistake to make</p>
<p>is to map Jimmy&rsquo;s philosophy onto every genre.</p>
<p>Because not every genre fits that model.</p>
<p>Your model is not an idea-centric model.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a people-centric model.</p>
<p>And so you, like, if you were in the business</p>
<p>of creating just mass entertainment</p>
<p>for the sake of mass entertainment,</p>
<p>you might focus on, okay, the reason going idea-focused</p>
<p>instead of person-focused is such a revolutionary idea</p>
<p>in some senses is because ideas can be broader,</p>
<p>more broadly appealing than any single human can be.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not going for that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going for a podcast interview.</p>
<p>And I think for you, the goal should always be</p>
<p>how deep can you get with interesting guests</p>
<p>and finding the most interesting guests,</p>
<p>which is a different, probably, set of skills than-</p>
<p>Well put, really well put.</p>
<p>But I think the right mapping there</p>
<p>is finding the most interesting guests.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And I think, I don&rsquo;t do enough work on that.</p>
<p>So for example, I try to be,</p>
<p>something I do prioritize is talking to people</p>
<p>that nobody&rsquo;s talked to before.</p>
<p>So, because it&rsquo;s like, I kind of see myself</p>
<p>as not a good, like, I know a lot of people</p>
<p>that are much better than me.</p>
<p>I really admire, I think Joe Rogan is still the GOAT.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just an incredible conversationalist.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, all right, who is somebody</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s not gonna talk to?</p>
<p>Either he&rsquo;s not interested or it&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Like, I wanna talk to that person.</p>
<p>I wanna reveal the interesting aspects of that person.</p>
<p>And I think I should do a Mr. Beast style rigor</p>
<p>in searching for interesting people.</p>
<p>And you should probably find people to help you search.</p>
<p>Sure, he does that.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re being honest, he does that, of course,</p>
<p>with other folks, but he&rsquo;s the main engine.</p>
<p>Yeah, you need like, sort of like a pre-filter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the final filter.</p>
<p>Because your problem is, you&rsquo;re only able</p>
<p>to think of humans that you&rsquo;ve thought of before</p>
<p>or been exposed to.</p>
<p>And most of the world, you&rsquo;ve never been exposed to.</p>
<p>So you need people to like pre-filter and go,</p>
<p>okay, these guys are just interesting humans.</p>
<p>Lex has never heard of them.</p>
<p>And then you sort of take a batch of like 100 people</p>
<p>and you go, who seems the most interesting for me?</p>
<p>But by the way, on that topic, where it weeds into weeds,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve almost done, I&rsquo;m building up,</p>
<p>I programmed this guest recommendation thing</p>
<p>where I wanna get suggestions from other people,</p>
<p>because I really wanna find people that nobody knows.</p>
<p>This is the tricky thing.</p>
<p>Not, you&rsquo;re not famous, but the idea is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably fascinating humans out there</p>
<p>that nobody knows.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That, I wanna find those.</p>
<p>And I believe in the crowdsourcing aspect will raise them.</p>
<p>And now, of course, the top 100 will be crypto scams.</p>
<p>No, but yes.</p>
<p>So like, I have to make sure that these kinds of swarms</p>
<p>of humans that recommend, I can filter through</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s whole kinds of systems for that.</p>
<p>But I wanna find the fascinating people out there</p>
<p>that nobody&rsquo;s ever heard from.</p>
<p>And from a programmer perspective,</p>
<p>I thought surely I could do that</p>
<p>by just building the system.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s how programmers always think.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just automate a system to do it.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the Jimmy Moneyball, right?</p>
<p>Like looking at the data.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Weeds on weeds.</p>
<p>How do we get to Mr. Beast exactly?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Okay, save the kids.</p>
<p>Influencer.</p>
<p>Influencer, that&rsquo;s probably how.</p>
<p>Let me ask you more on the guru front.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, okay, let&rsquo;s start with somebody</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve covered that I think you&rsquo;ve covered a lot</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really embarrassed to not know much about him.</p>
<p>I think this is like old school coffee sell.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been through stages, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through stages and phases, true.</p>
<p>So a character named Dan Lok.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who is he?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve exposed him for cult-like human</p>
<p>and his cult-like practices.</p>
<p>Who is he?</p>
<p>What has he done?</p>
<p>So Dan Lok is sort of,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gone through a number of iterations,</p>
<p>but he was kind of this like sales trainer guy</p>
<p>who really made a hard push</p>
<p>into what he called high ticket sales.</p>
<p>And he was telling people that they could kind of escape</p>
<p>the nine to five rat race</p>
<p>if they just learn high ticket sales</p>
<p>and they can have the life of their dreams.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll teach you to sell,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll teach you to ask,</p>
<p>like, not only will I teach you to sell you that pen,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll teach you to sell it for $50,000</p>
<p>instead of a dollar, right?</p>
<p>So I talked to a lot of the people</p>
<p>who had taken this course,</p>
<p>because it was pretty expensive.</p>
<p>I think it was like $2,500 or $1,000.</p>
<p>And mind you, the people who are taking it are like teachers</p>
<p>and like people who don&rsquo;t have a lot of money.</p>
<p>And then you take the course and immediately you find out,</p>
<p>okay, well, there&rsquo;s an upsell.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, you&rsquo;re not ready.</p>
<p>You need to go from like high ticket closer,</p>
<p>which is one of the products to inner circle</p>
<p>or like the level up, right?</p>
<p>And all of these courses are structured like this.</p>
<p>So they spend a tremendous amount on Google ads</p>
<p>to get people in the door, promising the dream.</p>
<p>And then once you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually not done being like the product.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually in the system that tries to upsell you</p>
<p>again and again and again and again.</p>
<p>And eventually you&rsquo;re paying monthly</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting more and more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly paying for access to Dan Lok&rsquo;s wisdom</p>
<p>and like ideas.</p>
<p>And fundamentally,</p>
<p>the sales system wasn&rsquo;t working for people.</p>
<p>I mean, I talked to like, for example,</p>
<p>a teacher who put in like $25,000,</p>
<p>was in debt at one point and has nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>I know, and it was sort of these tactics</p>
<p>of pressuring, pressuring, pressuring.</p>
<p>And then anytime anyone would complain,</p>
<p>he would try to silence them.</p>
<p>So I heard from like, funny enough,</p>
<p>this lady was a teacher as well.</p>
<p>She put together a Facebook group,</p>
<p>basically saying, I think this guy&rsquo;s a scam.</p>
<p>His course didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not working for a lot of people</p>
<p>because fundamentally the promise of turning someone</p>
<p>from a non-salesman into a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s making six figures selling</p>
<p>is not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a matter of just like take my course.</p>
<p>But anyways, it wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>She created a Facebook group about it</p>
<p>and he like sues her</p>
<p>and was like legally pressuring her to stop doing that.</p>
<p>And I realized like somebody has to speak out about this</p>
<p>and everyone who is, is getting silenced.</p>
<p>So I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna use my platform</p>
<p>to raise awareness to this.</p>
<p>And people came out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>I mean, saying that this guy defrauded me or he scammed me.</p>
<p>And I wanna just really quickly take a second,</p>
<p>take a beat to explain why get rich quick schemes</p>
<p>are different than let&rsquo;s say selling a water bottle</p>
<p>and saying it&rsquo;s the greatest water bottle ever, right?</p>
<p>Because sometimes people wonder, they go like,</p>
<p>well, doesn&rsquo;t like Nissan say their car</p>
<p>is gonna make you happy</p>
<p>and then it doesn&rsquo;t make you happy.</p>
<p>Like, why is that different</p>
<p>from the kind of advertising of a get rich quick course?</p>
<p>I mean, both of them are sort of promising things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t true, but you get something,</p>
<p>you take some kind of a training.</p>
<p>You know, isn&rsquo;t it the same thing?</p>
<p>No, here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this concept in economics called elastic demand</p>
<p>and inelastic demand.</p>
<p>What it essentially means is that if I raise the value</p>
<p>of this water bottle, there&rsquo;s a point at which</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna be like, no,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, right?</p>
<p>But there are areas in our lives</p>
<p>where we have desperation around them</p>
<p>that can get deeply predatory very quickly</p>
<p>because they have no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no elasticity around their demand.</p>
<p>For example, your health.</p>
<p>If you get cancer and I have the pill that will solve it,</p>
<p>or at least let&rsquo;s say I don&rsquo;t, I have a sugar pill here,</p>
<p>but if I can convince you that this pill</p>
<p>will solve your cancer or treat your cancer,</p>
<p>you will pay any amount of money you have on this earth</p>
<p>to get this pill.</p>
<p>But obviously that gets really predatory really quick</p>
<p>because selling something that isn&rsquo;t real</p>
<p>is almost as compelling</p>
<p>as selling something that is real, right?</p>
<p>So this happens in the get rich quick space too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s any amount of money you would pay</p>
<p>to make a lot more money, right?</p>
<p>So these products have inelastic demand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you see what is essentially a few webinars</p>
<p>getting sold for $2,500.</p>
<p>Courses that literally have identical videos on YouTube,</p>
<p>like very similar course curriculums</p>
<p>that are selling for such extravagant amounts of money.</p>
<p>And I think there can be comparisons made to college</p>
<p>because obviously there&rsquo;s similar questions about benefits.</p>
<p>But in this case, there&rsquo;s not even statistics available</p>
<p>that even shows the average person</p>
<p>gets something out of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true of like, if you go to college,</p>
<p>your average income will improve, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the justification there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no case studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing backing their extravagant claims</p>
<p>of you&rsquo;re gonna make all this money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna make all this wealth.</p>
<p>Instead, they&rsquo;re just, as we said before,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re selling you a dream.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I find all those types</p>
<p>of get-rich-quick schemes so problematic,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve railed against them</p>
<p>for a significant amount of time.</p>
<p>What have you learned from attacking,</p>
<p>exposing some of the things that Dan Lok is doing?</p>
<p>What have you learned about human nature</p>
<p>and fraudsters and gurus and so on?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So I think one of them is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this systemic problem that the phrase,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sucker born every minute, is very true.</p>
<p>There is no end to the people</p>
<p>who will fall for something like this.</p>
<p>And the problem is, is because there&rsquo;s just no end</p>
<p>to need and want and just lack.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s easy to, on the one hand,</p>
<p>criticize people&rsquo;s greed, but a lot of times,</p>
<p>you have to put yourself in their shoes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at a dead-end job, you have nothing going for you,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the money to go to college,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna get in debt, fair play,</p>
<p>where do you go, right?</p>
<p>As you said, there&rsquo;s somebody who&rsquo;s there saying</p>
<p>they believe in you, they believe you can make six figures.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re gonna believe in that.</p>
<p>And so I really felt like it made a lot more sense</p>
<p>to tackle it from the other side,</p>
<p>from the side of people that can stop,</p>
<p>that can basically be exposed and basically be,</p>
<p>have sort of like a negative put on their work.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re largely going under the radar,</p>
<p>so I kind of felt like, you know, do you wanna educate,</p>
<p>do you wanna like blame it on the victims</p>
<p>and say you should have known better,</p>
<p>you should have done this, you should stop,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no end to that,</p>
<p>or do you go after the grifters themselves?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I realized.</p>
<p>I realized like that&rsquo;s the tactic that I went with.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tough,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a little like legally risky to do that,</p>
<p>but yeah, you just kinda gotta be smart about it, I guess.</p>
<p>So your platform has gotten really big,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s some responsibility to that.</p>
<p>Weirdly big, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Because like only a year ago, it was like a lot,</p>
<p>a lot smaller, and then it&rsquo;s hard to make that adjustment,</p>
<p>you know, because like to me, it&rsquo;s just the same,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same show I&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>So how do you avoid becoming a guru yourself</p>
<p>or your ego growing?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different trajectories it could take,</p>
<p>one of which is you can start seeing everybody as a scammer</p>
<p>and only you can reveal it.</p>
<p>And like you have a audience of people</p>
<p>who love seeing the epic CoffeeZilla grilling,</p>
<p>and you can destroy everyone,</p>
<p>and that power now is getting to your head.</p>
<p>How do you avoid that?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, this is like less optically obvious.</p>
<p>I think the main way is like,</p>
<p>my circle of friends doesn&rsquo;t care about any of that.</p>
<p>Like my wife doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Whose opinion I value has no relation</p>
<p>to like a subscriber metric or anything like that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like tangibly the most important thing</p>
<p>to just staying grounded.</p>
<p>As far as like becoming a guru,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t have anything to like sell.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not interested in teaching people finance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in teaching people,</p>
<p>not interested in selling a course.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve kind of given myself a hard line on that,</p>
<p>which I think has helped me a bit,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a temptation to go,</p>
<p>well, I can tell what&rsquo;s a scam,</p>
<p>so let me tell you what&rsquo;s not a scam.</p>
<p>And a lot of people have offered a lot of money to do that,</p>
<p>and basically be like,</p>
<p>hey, I have such and such legitimate product,</p>
<p>come be like an endorser.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>because I think it undermines a lot of what I do,</p>
<p>is if you get like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re taking money in on the side to say this is legit,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re saying this isn&rsquo;t legit,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge conflict of interest.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s about managing conflicts of interest</p>
<p>and keeping people around me</p>
<p>that are grounded.</p>
<p>And also I think,</p>
<p>yeah, my only interest really is just like,</p>
<p>make cool stuff,</p>
<p>and I guess I&rsquo;ll do that until people stop watching, so.</p>
<p>A question on that topic</p>
<p>from the CoffeeZilla subreddit, shout out.</p>
<p>Shout out.</p>
<p>How does Coffee find the strength to maintain his integrity</p>
<p>and resist temptation of being paid a great amount of money</p>
<p>to advertise or promote a potential scam?</p>
<p>I think that goes back</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;ve been talking about a lot,</p>
<p>which is just on what you prioritize, what you value.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just never,</p>
<p>I guess I grew up kind of lower middle class,</p>
<p>and I had a great time.</p>
<p>Like I had a great childhood, I had very loving parents.</p>
<p>And because of that,</p>
<p>I guess intuited at an early age</p>
<p>that money doesn&rsquo;t do a whole lot.</p>
<p>And I knew a lot of people who were way better off</p>
<p>who had miserable childhoods</p>
<p>because whether their dad was always gone at work</p>
<p>or like they just had other family issues</p>
<p>that just money can&rsquo;t buy.</p>
<p>And I realized, I guess quickly,</p>
<p>that money&rsquo;s a very like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a glittery object that isn&rsquo;t what it appears to be.</p>
<p>And so to me, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having the time of my life making my show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna have the time,</p>
<p>like you could ruin all that</p>
<p>just trying to go for this quick check</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s like, no, I&rsquo;m having a great time.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s actually maybe,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably the same way,</p>
<p>but for me, there&rsquo;s a lot of happiness in having integrity</p>
<p>in looking in the mirror</p>
<p>and knowing that you&rsquo;re the kind of person that has that.</p>
<p>In fact, walking away from money is also fun</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like promising yourself,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s showing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to just say you have integrity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to like,</p>
<p>ah, I actually,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discovered several times in my life</p>
<p>that I have integrity.</p>
<p>Yeah, you get put like basically to the test.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know if I publicly said,</p>
<p>but to myself, I say like,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t buy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can&rsquo;t buy with me,</p>
<p>like for a billion dollars,</p>
<p>like a trillion dollars.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;d be nice to get tested that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be cool to see,</p>
<p>because you never know until you&rsquo;re in that room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The same with power, given power.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to believe I&rsquo;m the kind of person</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t abuse power,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know until you&rsquo;re tested.</p>
<p>So anyway, you&rsquo;re in a really tricky position</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re doing incredible,</p>
<p>I mean, you are a world-class journalist, straight up.</p>
<p>And so there is pressure on that</p>
<p>of like not having,</p>
<p>like erring on the side of caution</p>
<p>with like having conflicts of interest and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really tough seat to sit in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough, but it&rsquo;s unfairly tough, I feel like.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re sort of</p>
<p>weighing all of those.</p>
<p>But that said, go donate to Coffeezilla.</p>
<p>Donate all, everything.</p>
<p>Support him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a really, really important human being.</p>
<p>The other guy I did,</p>
<p>I think is the first person I discovered</p>
<p>that you investigated is Brian Rose of London Real.</p>
<p>Can you talk about his story?</p>
<p>Brian Rose, he was sort of this interesting figure</p>
<p>because he was like trying to be,</p>
<p>to one level or another, the Joe Rogan of London,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t think he did a terribly bad job of,</p>
<p>especially initially.</p>
<p>He had some really interesting podcasts</p>
<p>with some really interesting people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny enough, I started out as a like,</p>
<p>I would watch him.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if I was like a huge fan,</p>
<p>but I was like, I like some of his interviews.</p>
<p>He had some really good, like big gets</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, great guests.</p>
<p>However, when kind of COVID started,</p>
<p>he went down this really weird grifting rabbit hole</p>
<p>where he did like this interview with David Icke,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s, as you know,</p>
<p>like a pretty big COVID conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>And I mean like actual,</p>
<p>like he believes some of the royals are literally lizards.</p>
<p>So he got shut down for that.</p>
<p>And he kind of made a big stink,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Nobody likes to be censored.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even saying that he should have been censored,</p>
<p>but his reaction to that was to like</p>
<p>raise a ton of money from his audience,</p>
<p>promising this digital freedom platform.</p>
<p>And at first it was like, oh, we want to raise $100,000.</p>
<p>And then they raised it like within a day.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, well, we got to raise a lot more money.</p>
<p>And so eventually they raised a million dollars</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to raise $250,000 a month</p>
<p>to kind of keep putting his viewers&rsquo; money into this stuff.</p>
<p>So I started digging into the platform they were building</p>
<p>and there was nothing free about it.</p>
<p>They had censorship guidelines</p>
<p>and there was nothing about a platform at all.</p>
<p>There was no underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>He just got some white label live streaming thing.</p>
<p>So I criticized him for that.</p>
<p>It was just this ridiculous thing.</p>
<p>All the donators expected one thing.</p>
<p>They thought Brian Rose was going to take on Google</p>
<p>and Facebook and like bring free speech back for everybody.</p>
<p>And of course he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then it kind of got worse</p>
<p>because he started taking a lot of heat for that.</p>
<p>And he really pivoted hard into like the DeFi grift.</p>
<p>So he started selling this course about DeFi mastery.</p>
<p>And this is a guy who knows nothing about crypto</p>
<p>or very little at the least.</p>
<p>So it just got really kind of,</p>
<p>he just kind of doubled down on this course model</p>
<p>of you&rsquo;re going to be rich if you just follow me.</p>
<p>And it was ultimately,</p>
<p>you just type in Brian Rose on YouTube.</p>
<p>You can see what his audience thought of that.</p>
<p>Cause almost all of them have left him at this point.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s getting like a thousand views a video.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t because of me.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like people lost taste</p>
<p>in just the constant ask for more money,</p>
<p>more money, more money.</p>
<p>At some point people get sick of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, everyone has an understanding</p>
<p>that like no one works for free,</p>
<p>but when it starts to be ego driven</p>
<p>and driven around money, everything&rsquo;s about money,</p>
<p>it drives people away.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re a part of that sort of helping people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to have a voice.</p>
<p>Yeah, I certainly spoke out.</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t like I was quiet.</p>
<p>I was very loud about it at the time.</p>
<p>But I mean, in the sense that there,</p>
<p>if you look at someone like Andrew Tate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a video about him,</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;s been banned off all the platforms,</p>
<p>he gets more views than Brian Rose.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s just like it was a testament</p>
<p>to how much Brian Rose was like doing like the grift</p>
<p>that people could, even people who were fans</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t care about what I said,</p>
<p>like couldn&rsquo;t look past, you know,</p>
<p>just the constant ask for more and more money.</p>
<p>People just get burned out.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect that you worry about</p>
<p>where with a large audience,</p>
<p>there seems to be a certain aspect of human nature</p>
<p>where people like to see others destroyed?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Do you worry about hurting people that don&rsquo;t deserve it?</p>
<p>Or rather sort of attacking people that are a grifter light,</p>
<p>but they get like a giant storm of negativity towards them</p>
<p>and therefore sort of overpoweringly cancel them</p>
<p>or like hurt them disproportionately?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I try to be sensitive to my platform.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve grown,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to make sure my video topics have grown with me.</p>
<p>And like, it does reach this tricky point</p>
<p>where if you&rsquo;re exposing a grifter with like 50,000 subs,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing some harm, are you punching down?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so far there&rsquo;s been enough high profile things</p>
<p>that I can distract myself with</p>
<p>to where this has never been a problem.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t ever wanna be sort of like Sir Lancelot</p>
<p>in retirement.</p>
<p>Where have you heard this analogy?</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s this great analogy where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Sir Lancelot&rsquo;s the guy who slays the dragon, right?</p>
<p>He gets a lot of fame and he gets a lot of fortune</p>
<p>for saving the dragon,</p>
<p>or at least a lot of people love him.</p>
<p>But what happens after he slays the first dragon?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gotta go find a bigger dragon.</p>
<p>So he goes finds a bigger dragon.</p>
<p>And eventually, depending on how many dragons</p>
<p>you think are there in the world,</p>
<p>maybe he kills all the dragons.</p>
<p>And one day people go see Sir Lancelot</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s in a field with cows and he&rsquo;s chopping their heads.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s sort of put himself in retirement,</p>
<p>but he can&rsquo;t even enjoy the fruits</p>
<p>because his whole thing is like, I&rsquo;m killing the dragon.</p>
<p>So I try to be cognizant</p>
<p>and I try to always make myself willing to hang up my,</p>
<p>my suspenders, I guess, hang up my hat.</p>
<p>I try to be aware, like,</p>
<p>if I significantly improve the problem,</p>
<p>I put myself out of business.</p>
<p>I want to be okay with that, basically.</p>
<p>And just be fine with it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, the funny thing is,</p>
<p>I was more worried about this as like an issue earlier</p>
<p>because I thought there was a finite,</p>
<p>like, I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna solve this faster,</p>
<p>especially as it started gaining traction.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m gonna solve this fast.</p>
<p>I got this, you know?</p>
<p>Classic naive, you know, we all think we&rsquo;re so influential.</p>
<p>FTX comes along.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, you just, you just, yeah,</p>
<p>you just get like a, with time you get humbled</p>
<p>because you talk to people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to like versions of Coffeezilla that are older</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like, oh yeah, they didn&rsquo;t solve it.</p>
<p>And they probably were better.</p>
<p>I just imagine a smoke-filled room</p>
<p>of just like retired Batman</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re this young, bright-eyed.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Fiery-spirited investigator.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process of investigation that you can speak to?</p>
<p>What are some interesting things you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>about what it takes to do great investigations?</p>
<p>Sure, great investigations reveal something new</p>
<p>or bring something to light.</p>
<p>So I think what everyone thinks in terms of investigations</p>
<p>is like a lot of like, you know, Googling</p>
<p>or like searching through articles.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the first thing you wanna get away from.</p>
<p>And you wanna try to talk to people</p>
<p>doing like the non-obvious things</p>
<p>and just trying to get perspectives</p>
<p>that are beyond just what is available.</p>
<p>So a lot of it&rsquo;s just having conversations</p>
<p>is so enlightening, both to victims</p>
<p>and also obviously trying to get,</p>
<p>talk to the people themselves.</p>
<p>Secondly, there&rsquo;s sometimes some analysis you can generate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s meaningful, like blockchain evidence.</p>
<p>So in the case of SafeMoon, for example,</p>
<p>going back to that, I found someone&rsquo;s secret account</p>
<p>where they were pumping, dumping coins.</p>
<p>They were saying things like, who sold?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so mad at the guy who sold, F the guy who sold.</p>
<p>And you look at his account and he was the guy selling.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, that is just, that&rsquo;s great stuff.</p>
<p>So digging through the blockchain,</p>
<p>kind of I&rsquo;ve gained some skills there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of this fun,</p>
<p>I guess I would say it&rsquo;s this weird edge I have right now</p>
<p>because a lot of people don&rsquo;t know too much about that.</p>
<p>And so I have this weird expertise that works now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;ll work forever</p>
<p>because I think people kind of figure out</p>
<p>how to do very similar analyses.</p>
<p>But so it&rsquo;s like kind of an interesting edge</p>
<p>right now that I have.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like a data driven investigation,</p>
<p>but you also do interviews, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>And then also recently I&rsquo;ve tried to get more response,</p>
<p>speaking to your point about like,</p>
<p>as your platform gets bigger,</p>
<p>you need more responsibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to get much more responsible</p>
<p>about like reaching out or somehow giving the subject</p>
<p>some way to talk.</p>
<p>Because I think in early on,</p>
<p>I was such a small channel that A,</p>
<p>if I asked them, they wouldn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>But B, I kind of felt like I was launching these videos</p>
<p>into the abyss.</p>
<p>And when some of my videos had real traction,</p>
<p>I was like, okay, hang on a second.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s double check this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s triple check it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to make sure.</p>
<p>All this stuff is correct</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no other side of the story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this has interesting implications</p>
<p>because for example,</p>
<p>I investigated this thing called Genesis,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a billion dollar crypto lender.</p>
<p>And my conclusion was that they were insolvent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge accusation.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>Well, I emailed their press team, everybody.</p>
<p>I said, hey, I think you&rsquo;re insolvent.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re this.</p>
<p>I think I laid out all my accusations.</p>
<p>And I said, you have till I think 2 p.m.</p>
<p>the next day to respond.</p>
<p>At 8 a.m. before I made my video,</p>
<p>they announced to all their investors</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re freezing withdrawals.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the money.</p>
<p>So they front, I don&rsquo;t know if they saw the inner,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know if they actually saw that email.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna take credit for collapsing them or whatever.</p>
<p>But my point is, had I not taken that level of kind of care</p>
<p>and just said, hey, you&rsquo;re a scammer, you&rsquo;re frauds.</p>
<p>Ironically, could I have done more good</p>
<p>by allowing people to withdraw their money early?</p>
<p>I made some tweets that people did see</p>
<p>that like some people got their money out,</p>
<p>but my YouTube audience is much larger.</p>
<p>And could I have helped more people</p>
<p>had I not given them basically the ability</p>
<p>to know what I was gonna produce when I produced it?</p>
<p>Boy, your life is difficult</p>
<p>because you can potentially hurt the company</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t deserve it if you&rsquo;re wrong,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re right and you warn the company,</p>
<p>you might hurt the,</p>
<p>whew.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m glad your wife is a supporter and keeps you strong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tough, tough decision.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I guess you wanna err on the side</p>
<p>of the individual people, of the investors and so on.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a really, really tricky decision to make.</p>
<p>Very tricky.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>And then the thing I&rsquo;ve seen in your interviews</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t remember,</p>
<p>because I think when I watched you earlier in your career,</p>
<p>you were a little bit harsher.</p>
<p>You were having, you were like trollier.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having a little more fun.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;ve seen you recently, you do have the fun,</p>
<p>but whenever you interview, you seem respectful.</p>
<p>Like you attack in good faith,</p>
<p>which is really important for an interviewer.</p>
<p>So then people can go on</p>
<p>and actually try to defend themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important signal to send to people,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re not just about tearing down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re after like the, you know, it&rsquo;s cliche to say,</p>
<p>but the truth, like you&rsquo;re really trying</p>
<p>to actually investigate in good faith, which is great.</p>
<p>So that signal is out there.</p>
<p>So like people like SBF could, like he should,</p>
<p>he should go on your platform, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, now it&rsquo;s like in full,</p>
<p>not just like a half-assed conversation on Twitter space,</p>
<p>but in full.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great that that signal is out there.</p>
<p>But of course the downside of sort of,</p>
<p>as you become more famous,</p>
<p>people might be scared to sort of go on.</p>
<p>But you do put that signal of being respectful out there,</p>
<p>which is really, really important.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It surprises me.</p>
<p>I know it surprises other people,</p>
<p>because other people have commented,</p>
<p>but it consistently surprises me</p>
<p>how many people still talk to me.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s because they,</p>
<p>and I really do give a good attempt</p>
<p>to try to argue in good faith.</p>
<p>I try not to just like load up ad hominems</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>I just try to present the evidence</p>
<p>and let the audience make up their mind.</p>
<p>But it surprises me sometimes that people</p>
<p>will just be like, yeah, they wanna talk,</p>
<p>they wanna talk, they wanna talk.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very human in a way.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s like almost,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like good.</p>
<p>Like one of the things that is always told</p>
<p>to everyone who&rsquo;s gonna talk to the cops,</p>
<p>like you should never talk to the cops, whatever,</p>
<p>which is true.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t talk to the cops.</p>
<p>Because even if you&rsquo;re innocent,</p>
<p>they can use your words,</p>
<p>they can twist your words, et cetera.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something that gets lost</p>
<p>in that almost robotic self-interest</p>
<p>that I think having open conversations,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;ve done something wrong,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something really compelling about that</p>
<p>that continues to make people talk</p>
<p>in interrogation rooms, in Twitter spaces,</p>
<p>wherever you are,</p>
<p>regardless of whether you totally shouldn&rsquo;t be talking.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna downplay that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually really important.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like a lot of cases get solved,</p>
<p>a lot of investigations go farther</p>
<p>because people sort of make the miscalculation to talk.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s like almost important</p>
<p>in a way that we have that human bias</p>
<p>to like connect in spite of self-interest.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also they&rsquo;re judging the integrity</p>
<p>and the good faith of the other person.</p>
<p>So I think when people consume your content,</p>
<p>especially your latest content,</p>
<p>they know that you&rsquo;re a good person.</p>
<p>I found myself,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a lot of journalists that reach out to me</p>
<p>and I find myself like not wanting to talk to them</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know if the other person on the side</p>
<p>is coming in good faith.</p>
<p>Even on silly stuff, I&rsquo;m not a-</p>
<p>Same way.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not a, I don&rsquo;t have anything to hide.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t really have anything to hide,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know what their like spin is.</p>
<p>Can I tell you an example?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dying because I believe so strongly</p>
<p>that journalists have done themselves such a disservice.</p>
<p>Okay, one of the truest things is that like</p>
<p>everyone loves journalism in theory</p>
<p>and almost everyone dislikes journalists as a whole.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a deep distrust of journalists</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a deep love for journalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this weird disconnect.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it can be summarized in,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this book called the,</p>
<p>oh God, what it&rsquo;s called?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called The Journalist and the Murderer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written by Janet Malcolm.</p>
<p>The first line of this book is that like</p>
<p>every journalist who knows what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>who isn&rsquo;t too like,</p>
<p>is smart enough to know what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>knows what they&rsquo;re doing is deeply unethical</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a tradition in journalism</p>
<p>to betray the subject,</p>
<p>to lie to them in the hopes of getting a story</p>
<p>and play to their ego and to their sense of self</p>
<p>to make it seem like you&rsquo;re gonna write one article</p>
<p>and you stab them in the back at the end</p>
<p>when you press publish</p>
<p>and you write the totally different article.</p>
<p>This is what actually everyone hates about journalists.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s happened to me before.</p>
<p>So I did a story like way back in the day,</p>
<p>I got interviewed about something</p>
<p>that was like data with YouTube.</p>
<p>I made a few comments about data and YouTube.</p>
<p>And somehow by the time the article got published,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about me endorsing their opinion</p>
<p>that PewDiePie is an anti-Semite.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I reached out to this person,</p>
<p>I said, I never said that.</p>
<p>Like, how did you even twist my words to say that?</p>
<p>And I felt so disgusted and betrayed to have like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like this mouthpiece for an ideology</p>
<p>or like a thought that I do not actually agree with.</p>
<p>So, and when journalists do this, they think,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m never gonna interview this person again,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like the ends justify the means,</p>
<p>I get the story.</p>
<p>But the ends don&rsquo;t justify the means</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve now undermined</p>
<p>the entire field&rsquo;s credibility with that person.</p>
<p>And when that happens enough times,</p>
<p>you end up sitting across from Lex Friedman</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, well, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re gonna represent me fairly.</p>
<p>Because the base assumption is that regardless</p>
<p>of what the journalist says, they could betray you</p>
<p>and they might betray you at the end of the day</p>
<p>and be saying you&rsquo;re great</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re secretly writing like a hit piece</p>
<p>about like, you know, how much, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a bad force for the world.</p>
<p>Where, whereas there&rsquo;s an alternate universe</p>
<p>where if the journalist was somewhat upfront</p>
<p>about their approach, or at least didn&rsquo;t mislead</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t say like, I love you, I think you&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>You would end up with less access,</p>
<p>but you would end up with more trusted journalism,</p>
<p>which I think in the long run would be better.</p>
<p>I think you get more access.</p>
<p>I think in the long-term, yeah, but all of these,</p>
<p>like everything we&rsquo;re talking about is long-term games</p>
<p>versus short-term games.</p>
<p>In the short-term, you get more access</p>
<p>if you suck up to the person,</p>
<p>if you say this, say this, say this,</p>
<p>and you stab them in the back later.</p>
<p>Long-term, you build a long-term reputation,</p>
<p>people trust you, it actually matters more.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice when that reputation is your own individual.</p>
<p>So like you have a YouTube channel, you&rsquo;re one individual.</p>
<p>So people trust that because you have a huge disincentive</p>
<p>to screw people over.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>I feel like if you&rsquo;re in the New York Times,</p>
<p>if you screw somebody over,</p>
<p>the New York Times gets the hit, not you individually.</p>
<p>So you can like, you&rsquo;re safer,</p>
<p>but like the reason I don&rsquo;t screw people over</p>
<p>is I know that, well, there&rsquo;s my own ethics and integrity,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;s a strong disincentive to like,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re now, that person&rsquo;s gonna go public</p>
<p>with me screwing them over,</p>
<p>completely lying about everything,</p>
<p>how I presented the person, for example.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just gonna percolate throughout the populace</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna be like,</p>
<p>Alexis, the person is a lying sack of shit.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a huge disincentive to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, journalists don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>That is what&rsquo;s interesting about, yeah,</p>
<p>the move towards independent journalism.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll probably end up at a space where,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Mainstream journalism has so much work to do</p>
<p>to repair the trust with the average individual.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to take a lot of like self-reflection.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a few mainstream journalists about this.</p>
<p>And a lot of them will admit it behind closed doors,</p>
<p>but like there&rsquo;s this general sense that,</p>
<p>oh, the public&rsquo;s not being fair to us.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re very self, they&rsquo;re defensive, I guess,</p>
<p>in a way.</p>
<p>And I understand why,</p>
<p>because sometimes it&rsquo;s just a few bad apples</p>
<p>that ruin it for everybody.</p>
<p>But without the acknowledgement of the deep distrust</p>
<p>that they have with a good portion of our society,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to rebuild that.</p>
<p>Just like when there&rsquo;s no acknowledgement</p>
<p>of the corruption of the 2008 financial crash,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way to rebuild that.</p>
<p>Even if most bankers, most traders are not unethical</p>
<p>or duplicitous or totally normal people</p>
<p>who maybe aren&rsquo;t deserving of the bad reputation,</p>
<p>but you have to acknowledge the damage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been done by bad actors</p>
<p>before you can like heal that system.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think about Elon</p>
<p>just opening the door to a journalist</p>
<p>to see all the emails that were sent,</p>
<p>the quote unquote Twitter files?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I saw a lot of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like in this weird thing where I see,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so, I follow a lot of independent people</p>
<p>and I follow a lot of mainstream journalists</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s very polar opposite takes on that.</p>
<p>People really quickly politicize it,</p>
<p>but to me, the thing that was fascinating</p>
<p>is just the transparency that I&rsquo;ve never seen from,</p>
<p>one of the really frustrating things to me,</p>
<p>because a lot of this podcast</p>
<p>has been about interviewing tech people, CEOs and so on,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just so guarded with everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get to, and so it&rsquo;s nice to get,</p>
<p>hopefully this is a signal, look, you can be transparent.</p>
<p>Like this is a signal to increase transparency.</p>
<p>Hopefully so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, yeah, it&rsquo;s been tribalized so quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of faith in that.</p>
<p>And unfortunately it&rsquo;s been this like bludgeon match</p>
<p>of like, you know, if you&rsquo;re on the right,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s uncovering the greatest story ever</p>
<p>about Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on the left, you think they were just sharing,</p>
<p>they were just silencing revenge porn pics of Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>So therefore it was justified.</p>
<p>And by the way, Trump also sent messages to Twitter.</p>
<p>So doesn&rsquo;t that mean that like we should be criticizing,</p>
<p>this goes back to why I don&rsquo;t touch politics</p>
<p>is because I think as many problems as I have,</p>
<p>I think when you become a journalist that,</p>
<p>not even a political journalist,</p>
<p>when you become a journalist in politics,</p>
<p>you have like twice the problem.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m happy to be well outside</p>
<p>of that kind of sphere.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an interesting-</p>
<p>It is interesting.</p>
<p>Forget Twitter files,</p>
<p>but Twitter itself is really, really interesting</p>
<p>from the virality of information transfer.</p>
<p>And from a journalistic perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like how information travels,</p>
<p>how it becomes distributed, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>What do you think about Twitter?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always conflicted on Twitter</p>
<p>because I almost hate how much I enjoy using it.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m like, this is like this mindless bird app</p>
<p>is consuming my time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this incredible networking tool,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s weird is when I think</p>
<p>about my own presence on Twitter,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve almost made it too easy to like say something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve half thought.</p>
<p>Like the friction to send a tweet is so much less</p>
<p>than like, if I&rsquo;m gonna make a YouTube video,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s several points at which I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>well, what&rsquo;s the other side?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no friction there.</p>
<p>And so one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed</p>
<p>is everyone I follow on Twitter,</p>
<p>a lot of them after reading all their tweets,</p>
<p>I think nothing more of them, nothing less of them.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of them that I think less of.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had an experience</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve read someone tweets</p>
<p>and I think more of them in a way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what does that say that?</p>
<p>Yeah, what is that?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so many people I admire</p>
<p>that the worst of them is represented in Twitter.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million examples.</p>
<p>They become like snarky and sometimes mocking</p>
<p>and derisive and negative and like emotional messes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, what is that?</p>
<p>Maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t criticize it</p>
<p>and accept that as like a beautiful raw aspect</p>
<p>of that human being, but not encompassing,</p>
<p>not representing the full entirety of that human being.</p>
<p>But it does reflect like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to not reflect it to some extent.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;d have to counter that bias really carefully</p>
<p>because that is them.</p>
<p>It is a thought they had.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just probably something</p>
<p>that should have been an unexpressed thought perhaps.</p>
<p>So yeah, I kind of wonder like my,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, should I be on Twitter?</p>
<p>But the problem is, is it&rsquo;s such a great place</p>
<p>where so many, like so much of the news happens on Twitter,</p>
<p>so much of the journalism breaks on Twitter.</p>
<p>Even people in the New York Times, they&rsquo;ll tweet their scoop</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll like, they&rsquo;ll put that out on Twitter first.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this really weird thing where I&rsquo;d love to be off it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like too useful for my job.</p>
<p>I kind of hate it.</p>
<p>No, no, you need to, well, it depends.</p>
<p>But from my perspective, you should be on it.</p>
<p>Oh, I definitely am, yeah.</p>
<p>So like, Coffeezilla should definitely be on Twitter,</p>
<p>but have developed the calluses and the strength</p>
<p>to not give into the lesser aspects.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;re silly, you&rsquo;re funny.</p>
<p>You could be cutting with your humor.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t give into the darker aspects of that,</p>
<p>like low effort negativity.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, the way you are in your videos,</p>
<p>I would say if you&rsquo;re ever negative</p>
<p>or making fun of stuff, I think that&rsquo;s high effort.</p>
<p>So I would still put a lot of effort into it,</p>
<p>like calmly thinking through that.</p>
<p>Because, and also not giving into the dopamine desire</p>
<p>to say something that&rsquo;s gonna get a lot of likes.</p>
<p>You know, I have that all the time.</p>
<p>You use Twitter enough, you realize certain messages</p>
<p>that are going to get more likes than others.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>And are usually the ones that are extreme, more extreme.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like emotional, like, Lex is an idiot.</p>
<p>Or like, Lex is the greatest human being ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much better than, oh, wow,</p>
<p>what a polite, nuanced conversation.</p>
<p>I can tell you right now which of those three tweets</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t gonna perform well.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I think the extremes are okay, if you believe it.</p>
<p>Like I will sometimes say positive things.</p>
<p>I said that the Twitter files release was historic.</p>
<p>Of course, this before I realized,</p>
<p>I mean, the reason I said it is not,</p>
<p>is because the transparency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so refreshing to see some, any level of transparency.</p>
<p>And then of course, those kinds of comments,</p>
<p>the way Twitter does, is every side will interpret it</p>
<p>in the worst possible way for them,</p>
<p>and they will run with it.</p>
<p>Or some side, when it&rsquo;s political,</p>
<p>yeah, one side will interpret, yes, I agree with Lex.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s historic.</p>
<p>They might not have even read the article.</p>
<p>They just like, they literally, or the tweet thread,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just like, it is historic because it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Historic because Hunter Biden was finally the collusion,</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And then the other side&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s a nothing burger.</p>
<p>But yeah, that aspect of nuance,</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s frozen in time,</p>
<p>even with editing, there&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>So tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tricky, but if you maintain a cool head</p>
<p>through all of that, and hold to your ethics</p>
<p>and your ideas, and use it to spread the ideas,</p>
<p>which you do extremely well on YouTube,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be a really powerful platform.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other platform that allows</p>
<p>for the viral spread of ideas, good ideas,</p>
<p>than this.</p>
<p>And this is where, like, especially with Twitter Spaces,</p>
<p>I mean, where else would I see, I think twice,</p>
<p>impromptu conversations with coffeezilla and SPF?</p>
<p>Never, yeah, nowhere else.</p>
<p>Because he wasn&rsquo;t going to come on my show.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t going to come on some big prepared thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hey, YOLO, let&rsquo;s go on a Twitter Space.</p>
<p>And I like pop up, and you know what&rsquo;s funny?</p>
<p>And this, I hope this release is late enough,</p>
<p>or, well, SPF probably won&rsquo;t see this.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>And unfortunately, he will.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully I&rsquo;ll have time to enact my little plan,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m hoping if he goes on any future Spaces,</p>
<p>I can haunt him from interview to interview,</p>
<p>which is like, I keep showing up,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, oh, I hate this guy.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s already kind of probably</p>
<p>has PTSD of, like, in the shadows lurks a coffeezilla.</p>
<p>That would just, it&rsquo;s just like, that really amuses me.</p>
<p>I mean, there is, I think he honestly</p>
<p>would enjoy talking to you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an aspect of Twitter Spaces</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little uncertain of, like, what are we doing here?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s an urgency,</p>
<p>because other voices might want to butt in.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an intimate one-on-one where you can, like, breathe,</p>
<p>like, hold on a second, I think it&rsquo;s much easier.</p>
<p>So in that sense, Twitter Space is a little bit negative</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s too many voices,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s a very controversial kind of thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the friction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so easy to just jump in.</p>
<p>So I could just, I mean, I could,</p>
<p>I mean, you just imagine, like, a Twitter Space</p>
<p>with, like, Zelensky and Putin.</p>
<p>Like, how else are these two going to talk, right?</p>
<p>Like, can&rsquo;t you imagine?</p>
<p>If you try to set it up on Zoom, like, it&rsquo;s never happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never happening.</p>
<p>Too many delegates, like, the only way it happens</p>
<p>is Putin, like, sitting there, like-</p>
<p>Zelensky&rsquo;s live.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s live, right?</p>
<p>Just jumping in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>–î–∞–≤–∞–π –ø–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏ –ø–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–º.</p>
<p>Okay, actually, just on a small tangent.</p>
<p>So how do you have a productive day?</p>
<p>Do you have any insights</p>
<p>on how to manage your time optimally?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;ve gone the gamut of,</p>
<p>from obsessive time tracking in 15-minute buckets</p>
<p>to kind of, like, the other extreme,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s more kind of, like, large-scale,</p>
<p>some deep work here, two-hour bucket, you know,</p>
<p>account for an hour of lunch and some other thing.</p>
<p>But now, I just roughly, because I manage a team</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some things that kind of come up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only a team of two, it&rsquo;s not, like, big,</p>
<p>but I just have things</p>
<p>that are not necessarily controllable by me.</p>
<p>I, like, have to take some meetings or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as easy to plan out my day ahead of time.</p>
<p>So I do a lot of retrospective time management,</p>
<p>where I look at my day, and that&rsquo;s what I mostly do now,</p>
<p>and I account, did I spend this day productively?</p>
<p>What could I do better?</p>
<p>And then try to implement it in the future.</p>
<p>So a lot of this, I realize, is very personal for me.</p>
<p>I do very well in long streaks of working.</p>
<p>And if I, I can&rsquo;t do a lot of work in 15 minutes,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do a lot of work in even an hour,</p>
<p>but if you give me, like, three hours or five hours</p>
<p>or six hours of uninterrupted work,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, like, that&rsquo;s where I get most of my stuff done.</p>
<p>So from the, it just, it&rsquo;d be fun to explore those,</p>
<p>when you did 15-minute buckets.</p>
<p>So you have a day in front of you,</p>
<p>and you have, like, a Google sheet</p>
<p>or a spreadsheet or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did an Excel.</p>
<p>Excel.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re, do you have a plan for the day,</p>
<p>or do you go, like, when you did it,</p>
<p>or you just literally sort of focus on a particular task,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re tracking as you&rsquo;re doing that task</p>
<p>of every 15 minutes?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would kind of do it live.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, so one of the reasons I&rsquo;m so obsessive about it</p>
<p>is because I&rsquo;m not organized by nature.</p>
<p>And I lost, like, in college,</p>
<p>I learned how much lack of organization</p>
<p>can just hurt you in terms of output.</p>
<p>And so I realized, like, I just had to build systems</p>
<p>that would enable me to become more organized.</p>
<p>So really, I think, I think that,</p>
<p>doing that really taught me a lot about time</p>
<p>in the same way that tracking calories</p>
<p>can teach you about food.</p>
<p>Like, just learning, accounting for these things</p>
<p>will give you skills that, eventually,</p>
<p>you might not need to track on such a granular level</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve kind of, like, figured out.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how I feel about it.</p>
<p>I think everyone should,</p>
<p>if you care about productivity and stuff,</p>
<p>should do a little bit of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s sustainable in the long term.</p>
<p>It just takes so much effort and time to, like,</p>
<p>and I think the marginal effect of it in the long term</p>
<p>is kind of minimal once you learn these basic skills.</p>
<p>But yeah, I was basically tracking, like, live what I did.</p>
<p>And what I saw is that a lot of my real work</p>
<p>would be done in small sections of the day.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;d be, like, a lot of just nothing.</p>
<p>Like, a lot of small things where I&rsquo;m busy,</p>
<p>but little is being achieved.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s a really interesting insight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never figured out how to un-busy myself</p>
<p>and focus on the, like, core essentials.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still getting to that.</p>
<p>But it is interesting realizing most of your day</p>
<p>is, like, a lot of nothing.</p>
<p>And then, like, some real deep work</p>
<p>where most of your value comes from</p>
<p>is, like, 20% of your day.</p>
<p>Yeah, I try to start every day with that.</p>
<p>So the hardest task of the day,</p>
<p>and you focus for long periods of time.</p>
<p>And I also have the segment of two hours</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a set of tasks that I do every single day.</p>
<p>Well, the idea is you do that for, like, your whole life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, like, long-term investment of Anki.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, like, learning</p>
<p>and reminding yourself of facts,</p>
<p>you know, that are useful in your everyday life.</p>
<p>And then for me, also music.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll play a little bit of music.</p>
<p>Play a piano.</p>
<p>Piano.</p>
<p>And so, like, keeping that regular thing</p>
<p>is part of your life.</p>
<p>And one thing that I&rsquo;ve really taken from this</p>
<p>is, because I&rsquo;ve read all the, like,</p>
<p>I had a self-improvement phase in my early 20s.</p>
<p>And one thing you learn is that everyone wants</p>
<p>to give you a broad, general solution.</p>
<p>But really, the real trick of figuring out, like,</p>
<p>optimizing is figuring out the things</p>
<p>that work for you specifically.</p>
<p>So, like, one interesting thing you said is, like,</p>
<p>oh, I like to do my hard work at the beginning of the day.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people recommend this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried so many times.</p>
<p>And I just do better work late at night.</p>
<p>And so, usually, my streak of work is, like,</p>
<p>from, like, after dinner, 7.30 to, like, 2 a.m.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my prime time.</p>
<p>And so, like, a lot of my videos, which you&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>which is, like, lit from this studio,</p>
<p>which appears to be daytime, it&rsquo;s, like, shot at 3 a.m.,</p>
<p>you know, just, like, in a caffeine-fueled rush.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of how it works for me.</p>
<p>And then, also, like, with the social outlets</p>
<p>and stuff like that, which, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>And I know, I feel like we think similarly on this.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s easy to discount these things as less relevant</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have quantitative metrics</p>
<p>associated with them.</p>
<p>But in terms of longevity and, like, I think,</p>
<p>to be able to do creative work,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an amount of recharge and, like, re-inputting stuff</p>
<p>that is frequently discounted by people like us</p>
<p>who are, like, obsessed with, you know, quantitative metrics.</p>
<p>And so, I really found that some of my best work</p>
<p>gets done after I take, like, a break</p>
<p>or, like, I&rsquo;ll go play, like, live sets of music.</p>
<p>And, I mean, like, that&rsquo;s, like, for me, really recharging.</p>
<p>But nowhere on a spreadsheet is that gonna show up</p>
<p>as productive or, like, meaningful.</p>
<p>But for me, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>it recharges me in a way that, like,</p>
<p>I need to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I usually have a spreadsheet of 15-minute increments</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m socially interacting with people.</p>
<p>And I evaluate how-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting roasted right now.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, I&rsquo;m probably roasting myself.</p>
<p>But I do find that when I do have social interactions,</p>
<p>I like to do it with people that are, outside of that,</p>
<p>exceptionally busy themselves.</p>
<p>Because then you understand the value of time.</p>
<p>And when you understand the value of time,</p>
<p>your interaction becomes more intimate and intense.</p>
<p>Like, the cliche of work hard, party hard,</p>
<p>or whatever the cliche is.</p>
<p>Play hard.</p>
<p>Play hard, damn it.</p>
<p>Whatever, the-</p>
<p>English is my second language.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I mean, that cliche, there&rsquo;s a truth to that.</p>
<p>The intensity of the social interaction,</p>
<p>even like, you know, it&rsquo;s not even the intensity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even the party hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, even if you&rsquo;re going hiking and relaxing</p>
<p>and taking in nature, so it&rsquo;s very relaxed,</p>
<p>but you understand the value of that.</p>
<p>When you put a huge amount of value</p>
<p>on those moments spent in nature,</p>
<p>that recharges me much more.</p>
<p>So you have to surround yourself with people</p>
<p>that think of life that way,</p>
<p>that think about the value of every single moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things you do</p>
<p>when you break it up in 15 minute increments,</p>
<p>is you realize how much time there is in the day,</p>
<p>how much awesomeness there is in the day</p>
<p>to experience, to get done, and so on.</p>
<p>And then, so you can feel that when you&rsquo;re with somebody.</p>
<p>And then for me personally, like,</p>
<p>when I interact with people,</p>
<p>I really like to be fully present for the interaction.</p>
<p>I can tell this is, for anyone who has, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been the audience forever,</p>
<p>so I haven&rsquo;t been on this side of the table before.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very intense.</p>
<p>You look right in the eye.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like-</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know about right in the eye.</p>
<p>Eye contact is an issue, but yes, I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>Lex has a soulful gaze, guys.</p>
<p>Just in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very soulful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very comforting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a warm hug.</p>
<p>Back to serious talk.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ve studied a lot of people who lie,</p>
<p>who defraud, cheat, and scam.</p>
<p>On a basic human level,</p>
<p>how, do you have trouble trusting human beings</p>
<p>in your own life?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your relationship with trust of other humans?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So funny enough, before I did this,</p>
<p>I was like an incorrigible optimist.</p>
<p>Everything, the sun shined, every which place.</p>
<p>I always saw, like, everybody is fundamentally good.</p>
<p>Nobody was bad.</p>
<p>It just was like sort of wrong place, wrong time,</p>
<p>bad incentives.</p>
<p>That view has darkened significantly,</p>
<p>but I just try to remember my sample set.</p>
<p>And just like, I&rsquo;m just sampling sort of the worst.</p>
<p>And I try not to let it bleed into my day-to-day life.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s probably because I was such an optimist</p>
<p>early on that I&rsquo;ve been able to kind of retain some of it.</p>
<p>I call it enlightened optimism.</p>
<p>Like choosing to be optimistic in the face</p>
<p>of a realistic sense of the problems in the world,</p>
<p>with a realistic sense of like the scale</p>
<p>and the challenge ahead.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s much braver to be an optimist</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re aware of what&rsquo;s going on in the world</p>
<p>than to be a cynic.</p>
<p>I think being a complete cynic is maybe,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s maybe the easier way,</p>
<p>just mentally, to cope with so much negativity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like just saying, well, it&rsquo;s all bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all doomed to fail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all gonna go bust, is easier.</p>
<p>Yeah, that leap into believing that it&rsquo;s a good world</p>
<p>is a little baby act of courage.</p>
<p>Or at least I think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s naive.</p>
<p>No, it can be.</p>
<p>Some people are naive that are optimistic.</p>
<p>But oftentimes, just because someone&rsquo;s optimistic</p>
<p>does not mean they&rsquo;re naive.</p>
<p>They could be full well aware of how troubling the world is.</p>
<p>And I also believe some of the people you study,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m a big believer that all of us</p>
<p>are capable of good and evil.</p>
<p>So in some sense, the people you study</p>
<p>are just the successful ones,</p>
<p>the ones who chose sort of the dark path</p>
<p>and were successful at it.</p>
<p>And I think all of us can choose the dark path in life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the responsibility we all carry</p>
<p>is we get to choose that at every moment.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a big responsibility.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a chance to really have integrity.</p>
<p>It is a chance to stand for something good in this world.</p>
<p>All of us have that because I think</p>
<p>all of us are capable of evil.</p>
<p>All of us could be good Germans.</p>
<p>All of us could, in atrocities, be part of the atrocities.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s, I really have,</p>
<p>especially in recent years,</p>
<p>tried to somewhat depersonalize my work</p>
<p>and see it almost like as like a, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like a force of nature that I&rsquo;m fighting</p>
<p>more than like individuals.</p>
<p>Because of this exact thing, I think like sort of,</p>
<p>therefore, but the grace of God,</p>
<p>there go I is kind of a really profound way</p>
<p>to understand yourself rather than</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like fundamentally good</p>
<p>and like full of integrity.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that so much of that</p>
<p>is a product of your environment</p>
<p>and your family and your upbringing.</p>
<p>And so much of the people who don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>is a product of their environment.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t absolve them.</p>
<p>But it gives you more perspective</p>
<p>to like to sort of deal fairly, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>And not approach it from a place of anger</p>
<p>or a place of outrage.</p>
<p>There is a sense of like sadness for the victims.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of outrage for the victims,</p>
<p>but approach the individual who&rsquo;s done the thing</p>
<p>from that place of understanding of</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t just this person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a whole broader thing going on here.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people</p>
<p>of how to live this life?</p>
<p>How to have a career they can be proud of?</p>
<p>So high school students, college students,</p>
<p>or maybe a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great, well, let me think about this for a second.</p>
<p>I think don&rsquo;t be afraid to go against the grain</p>
<p>and sort of challenge the expectations on you.</p>
<p>Like you sort of have to do this weird thing</p>
<p>where you acknowledge how difficult it will be</p>
<p>to achieve something great</p>
<p>while also having the courage to go for it anyways.</p>
<p>And understanding that other people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have it figured out I think is a big theme of my work,</p>
<p>which is that everyone wants like the guru</p>
<p>to show them the way, to show them the secrets.</p>
<p>So much of life and achieving anything</p>
<p>is learning to figure it out yourself</p>
<p>and like the meta skill of being an autodidactic</p>
<p>where you can, I don&rsquo;t know if I said that word right.</p>
<p>Basically you self-teach.</p>
<p>You learn the meta skill of like learning to learn.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s such an underrated aspect of education.</p>
<p>People leave education, they go,</p>
<p>when am I gonna use two plus two?</p>
<p>When am I gonna learn, you know, use calculus?</p>
<p>But so much of it is learning this higher level</p>
<p>abstract thinking that can apply to anything.</p>
<p>And getting that early on is incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>So yeah, I would say like a lot of it is I guess</p>
<p>to some extent, like you kind of have to do</p>
<p>that Steve Jobs thing where you realize</p>
<p>that nobody else in the world is smarter than you.</p>
<p>And that both means that like</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t show you the perfect way,</p>
<p>but it also means you could do great things</p>
<p>and kind of chart your own path, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cheesy.</p>
<p>This is why I hate giving advice.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s cheesy.</p>
<p>I mean, and I don&rsquo;t think it is.</p>
<p>I think my journey is so full of luck</p>
<p>and like specific experience.</p>
<p>I wonder how generalizable it is.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;ve learned anything</p>
<p>and if I could talk specifically to myself,</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve taken a very difficult path.</p>
<p>And I think part of taking that path,</p>
<p>like of a great journalist, frankly,</p>
<p>is like I can be that person.</p>
<p>Like just believing in yourself that you could take that.</p>
<p>Because like if you see a problem in the world,</p>
<p>you could be the solution to that problem.</p>
<p>Like you can solve that problem.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s really important to believe that.</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re lucky to have the belief inside yourself.</p>
<p>Maybe the thing that you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is like don&rsquo;t look to others for that strength.</p>
<p>And also like be really comfortable failing.</p>
<p>I think one of the best things</p>
<p>that like you would never know about me,</p>
<p>just looking at my background,</p>
<p>that helped me was playing music live.</p>
<p>I had incredible amounts of stage fright growing up,</p>
<p>mostly because I was terrible at piano.</p>
<p>I was like sucked.</p>
<p>And I specifically, I taught myself how to play.</p>
<p>And I joined jazz band in like high school,</p>
<p>did it through college.</p>
<p>I remember all my recitals,</p>
<p>I messed up every single solo I ever did.</p>
<p>I never like actually nailed it.</p>
<p>And every time I&rsquo;d go up there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like have so much dread around this.</p>
<p>And it was easier to get up there</p>
<p>because there were sort of some people up there.</p>
<p>But eventually I started like playing live too.</p>
<p>And I sucked at that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve just gone through the trenches</p>
<p>of like just like being publicly sort of,</p>
<p>in my mind, humiliated,</p>
<p>like that prepared me so much for what I do now</p>
<p>of trying to basically being fearless of failure</p>
<p>in the face of like a wide audience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that anymore</p>
<p>because kind of I&rsquo;ve experienced so many iterations of it</p>
<p>at a smaller scale of just like abject public humiliation</p>
<p>to where it&rsquo;s like not something that bothers me.</p>
<p>I have no stage fright that doesn&rsquo;t bother me anymore.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;d think like,</p>
<p>oh, maybe he just was always good at this.</p>
<p>I was terrible at it.</p>
<p>I had a complete phobia about public anything.</p>
<p>So it was that rapid iteration of just failure.</p>
<p>And eventually I just like came to the conclusion</p>
<p>of like, I wanna love it.</p>
<p>I wanna like love like getting up on a stage and bombing.</p>
<p>If you can learn to like love that and be fearless there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost nothing you can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s brilliant advice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still terrifying to me, like live performance.</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly the feeling</p>
<p>is loving the fact that you tried.</p>
<p>And somehow failure is like a deeper celebration</p>
<p>of the fact that you tried.</p>
<p>Because success is easy.</p>
<p>But like failure is like bombing.</p>
<p>I mean, music, yeah.</p>
<p>On small scale, on the smallest and the largest of stages,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say who, but there&rsquo;s a huge band,</p>
<p>huge band that wanted to be on stage.</p>
<p>And it probably will happen.</p>
<p>But like, but I turned it down because I was like, no.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m gonna suck for sure.</p>
<p>So the question is, do I wanna suck</p>
<p>in front of a very large live audience?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then I turned it down because like, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>But now I realize, yes.</p>
<p>Embrace it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be good for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna crush your ego to the degree it&rsquo;s remaining.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just good for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good not to take yourself seriously</p>
<p>and do those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But honestly, I feel that way in an audience,</p>
<p>like in an open mic, it hurts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I really admire comedians.</p>
<p>And like, I go to open mics all the time</p>
<p>with comedians and musicians,</p>
<p>and I just see them bomb and play in front</p>
<p>of like just a few folks,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re putting their heart out.</p>
<p>And especially the ones that kind of suck,</p>
<p>but are going all out anyway.</p>
<p>I think open mics are the best place to learn though,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the lowest stakes you can get</p>
<p>while still being public.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna face like fears around this,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking very specifically like public speaking</p>
<p>or any kind of like, you know, being in front of a camera.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna face your fear, you have to do it.</p>
<p>And the easiest way to do it is to lower the stakes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna start being Lex Friedman</p>
<p>on stage with a huge band.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna be.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like in that way, it is so impossible.</p>
<p>But the more you lower the stakes</p>
<p>and just like open it up to like two strangers,</p>
<p>five strangers, like the most dive bar open mic</p>
<p>you can go to and like start performing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what I did is like,</p>
<p>like I love open mics now.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like low stakes on the one hand,</p>
<p>but you really get the feeling of like going for it.</p>
<p>And get better and better and better at that.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll get the strength</p>
<p>to take a bigger and bigger and bigger risks.</p>
<p>Listen, Koff, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours,</p>
<p>not just for who you are, but for what you stand for.</p>
<p>People like you are rare and they&rsquo;re a huge inspiration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inspired by your fearlessness,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re taking on some of the most powerful</p>
<p>and richest people in this world and doing so</p>
<p>with respect, I think, with good faith,</p>
<p>but also with the boldness and fearlessness.</p>
<p>Listen, man, I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>Keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>as long as you got the strength for it.</p>
<p>Cause I think you inspire all of us.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing important work, brother.</p>
