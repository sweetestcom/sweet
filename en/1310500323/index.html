    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve definitely experienced moments</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything but chess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also say that&rsquo;s pretty universal.</p>
<p>I think if you want to be the best at anything you do</p>
<p>or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation</p>
<p>with Alexandra and Andrea Botez.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sisters, professional chess players,</p>
<p>commentators, educators, entertainers, and streamers.</p>
<p>Their channel is called Botez Live on Twitch and YouTube.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you check it out.</p>
<p>A small side note about the currently ongoing controversy</p>
<p>in the chess world, where the 19 year old grandmaster,</p>
<p>Hans Niemann, beat Magnus Carlsen at the Sink Field Cup.</p>
<p>After this, Magnus, for the first time ever,</p>
<p>withdrew from the tournament, implying with a tweet</p>
<p>that there may have been cheating</p>
<p>or at least something shady going on.</p>
<p>Folks like the grandmaster, Hikaru Nakamura,</p>
<p>fanned the flames of cheating accusations,</p>
<p>and the internet made a bunch of proposals</p>
<p>on how the cheating could have been done,</p>
<p>and it ranged from the ridiculous to the hilarious,</p>
<p>often both.</p>
<p>Hans himself came out and said that he has cheated before</p>
<p>when he was 12 and 16 on random online games</p>
<p>to jack up his rating.</p>
<p>But he said that he has never cheated in person</p>
<p>over the board.</p>
<p>Danny Wrench from chess.com, who I&rsquo;ve spoken with,</p>
<p>may make a statement in response to Hans&rsquo;s claims soon.</p>
<p>Folks like grandmaster Jakob Luegge</p>
<p>spoke to his experience training Hans Niemann</p>
<p>and has said that his memory and intuition</p>
<p>were quite brilliant.</p>
<p>So as you see, there&rsquo;s a lot of perspectives on this.</p>
<p>ChessBase has a good summary of the saga</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll link in the description.</p>
<p>Also note that this is so quickly moving</p>
<p>that new stuff might come out between me recording this</p>
<p>and publishing the episode,</p>
<p>but I thought I&rsquo;d mention this anyway</p>
<p>since the episode with the Botas sisters</p>
<p>is a conversation about chess</p>
<p>and was recorded shortly before the controversy,</p>
<p>so we didn&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m considering having Hans on this podcast</p>
<p>and also Magnus back on the podcast,</p>
<p>and maybe others like Hikaru</p>
<p>or folks from chess.com&rsquo;s anti cheat staff</p>
<p>to discuss their really interesting</p>
<p>cheating detection algorithms,</p>
<p>but I may also just stay out of it.</p>
<p>I find chess to be a beautiful game</p>
<p>and the chess community</p>
<p>full of fascinating, brilliant people,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;ll keep having conversations like these</p>
<p>about chess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>My goal with this podcast and in general as a human being</p>
<p>is to increase the amount of love in the world.</p>
<p>Sometimes that involves celebrating brilliance and beauty</p>
<p>in science, in art, in chess.</p>
<p>Sometimes it involves empathetic conversations</p>
<p>with controversial figures that seek to understand,</p>
<p>not to ride.</p>
<p>Sometimes it involves standing against</p>
<p>the internet lynch mob,</p>
<p>as the ChessBase article calls it,</p>
<p>to hear the story of a human being who is under attack,</p>
<p>even if it means I get attacked in the process as well.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>

<p>in the description,</p>
<p>and now, dear friends,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Alexandra and Andrea Botas.</p>
<p>You just got back from Italy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most memorable thing?</p>
<p>I was just there recently as well.</p>
<p>It was very chaotic because we went out on a whim</p>
<p>and we only had our first hotel booked,</p>
<p>and then we rented a car and drove around all of the cities</p>
<p>and went to like five different cities</p>
<p>in about a week and a bit.</p>
<p>So I think it was just the variety</p>
<p>of seeing so many different places</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re used to being at home all the time,</p>
<p>and Andrea, is yours your luggage?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say it was the most stressful vacation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been in in our life,</p>
<p>and it was a valuable learning lesson</p>
<p>because now I know how to be prepared for trips,</p>
<p>but we lost our bags and I never got them back.</p>
<p>And like Alex said,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;d be sleeping every night</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just driving through a new city</p>
<p>with a giant van in the most narrowest streets</p>
<p>and getting in many, many fights with Italian men.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t really a vacation.</p>
<p>I saw this motion so many times.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t it liberating to lose your baggage?</p>
<p>Is it still the lining?</p>
<p>It was liberating.</p>
<p>My entire life, I&rsquo;ve always had the issue of overpacking.</p>
<p>And I told her before the trip,</p>
<p>Andrea, you&rsquo;re gonna pack light, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, Alex, yeah.</p>
<p>And then I see her stuffing her overweight suitcase.</p>
<p>But you did the same.</p>
<p>We both had giant, big extra baggage that we didn&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m actually very glad we lost it</p>
<p>because for Venice, hauling that around on all the boats</p>
<p>and through the tiny streets and there&rsquo;s no Ubers.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s the first time where I can travel</p>
<p>without checking in a bag, which I&rsquo;ve never done before.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;ve learned what it means to pack light</p>
<p>because I saw that I could survive off of just my,</p>
<p>this sounds very dramatic,</p>
<p>but it was really a big learning lesson for me.</p>
<p>The driving must&rsquo;ve been crazy</p>
<p>because driving in Italy is rough.</p>
<p>The driving was crazy.</p>
<p>I did most of it and it would be really interesting</p>
<p>driving through places like Florence</p>
<p>or even through the beach areas that were super windy</p>
<p>because there are two way streets</p>
<p>that should really only be one way.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d be driving this huge van</p>
<p>and then another car comes on a cliff</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just waiting for it to slowly pass.</p>
<p>So it took all of my focus and concentration</p>
<p>to drive well in Italy,</p>
<p>but it was actually really relaxing</p>
<p>because the hardest thing about making a lot of videos online</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re always thinking about it, what&rsquo;s coming next.</p>
<p>And when we were in Italy,</p>
<p>it was so chaotic that I did not think about work</p>
<p>for a good week and a bit.</p>
<p>Oh, cause you&rsquo;re just.</p>
<p>We were stressed.</p>
<p>I was just trying to keep us alive.</p>
<p>It seemed higher priority.</p>
<p>And that was kind of fun.</p>
<p>It was kind of fun.</p>
<p>No planning, nothing.</p>
<p>Just on a whim.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it or ever do that again, but.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty awesome.</p>
<p>And we even randomly ran into two friends of ours</p>
<p>who were in the same city</p>
<p>and we just traveled with them for about half of the trip.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you just took on the chaos.</p>
<p>Exactly, it was an adventure.</p>
<p>Okay, and I see like,</p>
<p>cause you were using your hands a lot.</p>
<p>You picked up some of the Italian hand gestures.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>We did get yelled at by a lot of Italians.</p>
<p>The old Italian grandmas would come to us after breakfast</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;d leave something on the plate</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>you could feed an entire village with that.</p>
<p>Tell your friends.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d feel so ashamed.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got cursed out a lot,</p>
<p>but it really reminded me of where we grew up and helped.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah, bring back those mechanisms.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d you grow up?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re Romanian,</p>
<p>but it was like an immigrant neighborhood.</p>
<p>In Canada.</p>
<p>So, same if you don&rsquo;t finish your plate,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s disrespectful to the people who made the food.</p>
<p>How was the food in Italy?</p>
<p>I feel like the carbs thing is too intense.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think very overrated in my opinion.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually not supposed to eat gluten</p>
<p>cause I have an allergy,</p>
<p>but I was in Italy and it&rsquo;s gluten galore.</p>
<p>So I was actually eating a lot of it</p>
<p>and it was very interesting</p>
<p>cause I didn&rsquo;t get sick while I was in Italy,</p>
<p>but I do while I&rsquo;m in the US.</p>
<p>So somehow the food was actually maybe more okay</p>
<p>for me to digest, which I appreciated,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t like it as much as I thought.</p>
<p>Did you like the food there?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I did, I did.</p>
<p>I love carbs, but it feels like Vegas</p>
<p>when I go there for the food is like,</p>
<p>if I stay here too long, I&rsquo;m gonna do things I regret.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it feels like with the food.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to moderate</p>
<p>and everybody is pushing very large portions</p>
<p>and while kind of eating things on you,</p>
<p>pasta, pizza and bread, so delicious.</p>
<p>So yeah, I love it, but I regret everything.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t wanna go to a place</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m going to regret everything I do</p>
<p>for too long of a time.</p>
<p>Yeah, surprisingly the people there though</p>
<p>are still very fit and everyone stays in good shape,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re walking around all day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re much more active than anyone.</p>
<p>And they also just know how to moderate food.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve gotten used to the US way of eating.</p>
<p>The US portions. What is that?</p>
<p>Just a lot, always a lot and more.</p>
<p>And I feel in the US food advertisements</p>
<p>are also much more in your face</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re more often reminded of junk food</p>
<p>than we were in Italy.</p>
<p>So even though we were eating less healthy things,</p>
<p>I think we were getting cravings</p>
<p>and being pushed towards junk food less often.</p>
<p>All right, I gotta ask you a hard question.</p>
<p>So the romance languages.</p>
<p>So I think French is up there as like number one.</p>
<p>Number one in terms of?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s ranking them?</p>
<p>Oh, you guys speak Italian or no?</p>
<p>Not Italian, but we studied French and Spanish in school.</p>
<p>And Romanian.</p>
<p>I feel like every country calls their language</p>
<p>a romance language.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s Romanian, French, Spanish, Portuguese.</p>
<p>And I think there was one more that was like this dialect,</p>
<p>but those are considered the romance languages.</p>
<p>Okay, so where would you put Italian?</p>
<p>I think we got yelled at so much in Italian</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not gonna be a love word.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the bottom of the list</p>
<p>cause people did not use it nicely to us.</p>
<p>But I always really liked how French sounds.</p>
<p>I think something about it where maybe Spanish</p>
<p>actually sounds nicer to the ears,</p>
<p>but French has more character and it feels more sultry.</p>
<p>So I like French.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>Yeah, that was my answer too.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Sultry, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like French, in France,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m always being judged.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re better than me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what French.</p>
<p>They are better than us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so true.</p>
<p>Which is why I long to belong to that.</p>
<p>I like the British accent.</p>
<p>The British accent?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, one thing we did on our Italian trip</p>
<p>is we just picked up British accents</p>
<p>for the entire trip for fun.</p>
<p>And we forgot we were doing them</p>
<p>to the point where we talked to British people</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d ask us, why are you talking like that?</p>
<p>We just couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>I did feel much more elegant and mature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>People like, I don&rsquo;t know if they felt the same way</p>
<p>about us, but it was more of the confidence.</p>
<p>You do feel like you&rsquo;re more poised for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how&rsquo;d you guys get into chess?</p>
<p>When did you first, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>when did you first fall in love with chess?</p>
<p>So we both started playing when we were pretty young,</p>
<p>around six years old.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when our dad taught us.</p>
<p>And I enjoyed playing chess</p>
<p>because I had good results early on,</p>
<p>but a lot of it was being pushed from my dad to play chess.</p>
<p>And I only really started loving it</p>
<p>when we moved from Canada and we started moving a lot</p>
<p>and chess was the one stable thing that I had.</p>
<p>And it was also where all of my friends were.</p>
<p>So it was kind of that foundational thing for me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I started studying chess very intensely.</p>
<p>And when I started putting in the hours out of my own will</p>
<p>and not because I was being pushed by my dad,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I started really loving it.</p>
<p>And I even wanted to take time off college</p>
<p>to just focus on chess.</p>
<p>So training and competing?</p>
<p>Training and competing, yeah.</p>
<p>It was when I was doing it for myself</p>
<p>that I started getting my best results.</p>
<p>And actually enjoying the thing.</p>
<p>And really enjoying it, yeah.</p>
<p>I would spend summer vacations studying for tournaments</p>
<p>and my mom would come and say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You need to make friends, go leave the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d be like, no, I need to play chess.</p>
<p>And I remember those moments.</p>
<p>That you rebelled by playing chess, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>How did you get into it?</p>
<p>Yeah, my experience with loving in high school</p>
<p>is very opposite from Alex&rsquo;s, but right,</p>
<p>my sister was playing and my dad taught me</p>
<p>when I was also six. Andrea was cool</p>
<p>in high school, unlike me.</p>
<p>You were.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say cool, I&rsquo;d say more balanced</p>
<p>and I was interested in other hobbies.</p>
<p>In my childhood, if I ever really did love chess,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certainly moments about traveling</p>
<p>and being together with my family</p>
<p>and spending those moments together,</p>
<p>but those are more the social and the experiences.</p>
<p>But funny enough, I think my happiest moment</p>
<p>where I really played the game for my own enjoyment</p>
<p>was probably my most recent tournament.</p>
<p>Because this was after, obviously, we&rsquo;ve been streaming</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m no longer in high school,</p>
<p>but when I was in school, I was always playing for college</p>
<p>and for the results, trying to build a resume.</p>
<p>So I was too stressed out about the pressure</p>
<p>to really enjoy the game.</p>
<p>Whereas when I just played my first tournament,</p>
<p>so it was after a two year break because of the pandemic</p>
<p>and it was also all live on Twitch,</p>
<p>so there was some pressure, but it was the first time</p>
<p>that I was really eager to study for the game,</p>
<p>sitting and focusing since we&rsquo;ve been streaming</p>
<p>and not getting distracted by something else.</p>
<p>In years, like I said.</p>
<p>And the tournament experience, I hit my highest rating</p>
<p>and it was my best tournament ever.</p>
<p>And I think most of that is because it came</p>
<p>from my own enjoyment.</p>
<p>So you didn&rsquo;t enjoy the domination?</p>
<p>Because I think you did really well, right?</p>
<p>This is like a couple months ago?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, the tournament.</p>
<p>Well, of course, I think the results came</p>
<p>from enjoying the tournament.</p>
<p>Because I would be in high school studying triple</p>
<p>the amount of time, like six hours every day</p>
<p>compared to this tournament, I didn&rsquo;t even prepare for it.</p>
<p>And for three years, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to pass one rating, whereas in this one tournament,</p>
<p>I passed it by like 70 points without even any preparation.</p>
<p>So it was, I think, as soon as you stopped worrying</p>
<p>about the competitions, when the games get much better.</p>
<p>What does it mean to pass a rating?</p>
<p>So I was stuck at 1900.</p>
<p>1900 is 100 points off of expert.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Usually when you reach 2000, you&rsquo;re considered an expert,</p>
<p>which is the rating Andrea was going for.</p>
<p>Okay, expert, that&rsquo;s a technical term</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s like a talk and trash term?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a colloquial term</p>
<p>where if somebody is around a 2000</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re playing them in a tournament,</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t have the actual title next to their name,</p>
<p>but you always say, I&rsquo;m playing an expert.</p>
<p>What about like the more official things like master?</p>
<p>Does that have to do with the rating or something else?</p>
<p>Yeah, so national master in the US is when you&rsquo;re 2200.</p>
<p>Okay, and what&rsquo;s international master?</p>
<p>International master is based off of a different system,</p>
<p>the FIDE system, which is international.</p>
<p>To be an international master, it&rsquo;s 2400</p>
<p>and you have to have three international master norms.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Magnus said he&rsquo;s a 28, six something.</p>
<p>That was, yeah.</p>
<p>And then he said, that&rsquo;s pretty decent.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Well, he always talks a lot about that.</p>
<p>But see the thing is, I think what he meant</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s a decent rating</p>
<p>because it accurately captures his actual level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not overinflated or underinflated and so on.</p>
<p>And so the discussion there was how do you get to,</p>
<p>can a human being get to 2900?</p>
<p>And then he says, because my current rating</p>
<p>is pretty decent at representing my skill level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a long road to actually get there.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, so you have to beat people</p>
<p>at your same level, that&rsquo;s how the number increases.</p>
<p>Exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>And you beat a bunch of people in the tournament, right?</p>
<p>That are higher than your luck.</p>
<p>I did, I got very lucky.</p>
<p>I was playing, I was really nervous</p>
<p>because my category was like 200 points above my rating.</p>
<p>And of course, I was very rusty</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t play in a tournament in a while,</p>
<p>but it went pretty well.</p>
<p>Do you feel the pressure when you&rsquo;re actually recording it,</p>
<p>like the streaming?</p>
<p>It was definitely, so before every round I was vlogging</p>
<p>and I was doing meet and greets</p>
<p>and doing other things for the livestream.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw you do a meet and greet.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know what the hell you were doing, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like what am I, how do I do this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I see.</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>It was actually really wholesome.</p>
<p>The beginning was very silly</p>
<p>because I was just not expecting</p>
<p>that it was gonna be more of a seminar.</p>
<p>I thought it was like, oh, you pose and take pictures,</p>
<p>but they actually asked really nice, meaningful questions,</p>
<p>but unfortunately it&rsquo;s bad for YouTube retention</p>
<p>and we cut them all out, so.</p>
<p>Bad for YouTube?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The good long form conversation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it was like questions, Q and A type of thing.</p>
<p>Exactly, you have to have very fast paced for YouTube</p>
<p>and that seminar was not fast paced.</p>
<p>Okay, well, not everything in life</p>
<p>needs to be on YouTube, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like two parallel things,</p>
<p>stuff that&rsquo;s fun for YouTube.</p>
<p>Yes, one day we&rsquo;ll post that Q and A.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you guys like, when you become like ultra famous,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re currently just regular famous.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll appreciate the long, slow content, yes.</p>
<p>And that, the YouTube aspect, the creation aspect,</p>
<p>does that add to the fun, ultimately,</p>
<p>of the chess, of like your love of chess?</p>
<p>Oh, for the love of chess in general</p>
<p>or just for competing in that one tournament?</p>
<p>No, love of chess in general.</p>
<p>I think you said that for competing for that tournament</p>
<p>is adding pressure.</p>
<p>Yeah, but actually I would say like a good pressure,</p>
<p>but yeah, this is where I differed to Alex</p>
<p>because when I was just competitive and I was younger,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I loved chess as much</p>
<p>as when I started doing it for content</p>
<p>because unlike her, who a lot of her friends</p>
<p>and social circle were other chess players,</p>
<p>I never really traveled</p>
<p>and built really solid friendships through chess</p>
<p>until I started streaming and meeting other chess streamers</p>
<p>and actually playing and talking to people for fun</p>
<p>rather than just always being alone in the game</p>
<p>and never really meeting other people my age</p>
<p>or people with similar interests.</p>
<p>So I would say Twitch was the thing</p>
<p>that really changed how I approached the game.</p>
<p>I think with some YouTubers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a pressure to be almost somebody else.</p>
<p>You create a persona and you&rsquo;re stuck in that persona.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m too much of a boomer</p>
<p>to know what the hell Twitch is anyway,</p>
<p>but it feels like when you&rsquo;re actually live streaming,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t help but be who you really are.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, oh, well, I think when you&rsquo;re live streaming</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of other streamers about this,</p>
<p>you kind of just over exaggerate</p>
<p>one side of your personality.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s kind of like being like on all the time.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re trying to be more entertaining</p>
<p>and sometimes you&rsquo;re being silly at moments or more,</p>
<p>you take what character traits like people know you for.</p>
<p>And for me, one is being like ADHD</p>
<p>and the younger sibling who&rsquo;s very energetic</p>
<p>and causes trouble,</p>
<p>even though sometimes it&rsquo;s a little switch.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure you cause trouble just for the camera.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I think, yeah, I think,</p>
<p>and of course, once you&rsquo;re live streaming</p>
<p>for like four or five hours,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be moments in the stream where it&rsquo;s more chill,</p>
<p>but especially when you&rsquo;re like editing that content</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re doing bigger streams that are shorter,</p>
<p>you are kind of playing up a side of yourself</p>
<p>because of course, there&rsquo;s a lot of parts of me</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t show to the camera</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not as entertaining to watch,</p>
<p>like the more serious part.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s things that you are really interested in</p>
<p>about what you do.</p>
<p>Like I love competitive chess</p>
<p>where I could sit and really think about it,</p>
<p>but I know that that is not gonna be as entertaining</p>
<p>for stream.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s not gonna be as entertaining for YouTube.</p>
<p>So you kind of have to take what you like,</p>
<p>but then really adapt it for whatever the format is.</p>
<p>And sometimes that feels inauthentic,</p>
<p>but other times it just feels like repackaging</p>
<p>what you love for people</p>
<p>in a more general audience to enjoy.</p>
<p>Do you feel like it&rsquo;s a trap a little bit as you evolve?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re trapped in?</p>
<p>Oh, I think social media, oh, sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>Social media in general is a trap of that kind?</p>
<p>Well, so we&rsquo;ve been trying to switch</p>
<p>to learn how to make YouTube videos recently.</p>
<p>And so much of learning YouTube school</p>
<p>is kind of the beastification of content</p>
<p>where you try to get to the point of the video</p>
<p>within like the first 10 seconds to not lose people.</p>
<p>The beastificate, you mean like Mr. Beast?</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, where it&rsquo;s so fast paced,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason to wait, there&rsquo;s high stakes.</p>
<p>And everything is created to keep people watching the video</p>
<p>and keep people on the platform.</p>
<p>And in some ways it is a trap</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s harder to do the kind of content you like</p>
<p>because you really have to squeeze it to be like,</p>
<p>okay, well, do we have a good thumbnail for this?</p>
<p>Do we have a good title for this?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;re trying to figure out</p>
<p>how to keep true to what we wanna do.</p>
<p>Yeah, see, the way I think about it is,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff you can create</p>
<p>and yeah, the Mr. Beastification process.</p>
<p>But also I think about what are the videos,</p>
<p>conversations or things I will create in this life</p>
<p>that will be the best thing I do.</p>
<p>And I try not to do things in my life</p>
<p>that will prevent me from getting there.</p>
<p>I feel like if you&rsquo;re always focusing on doing kind of,</p>
<p>optimizing the thumbnail in the 10 seconds and so on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never do the thing that&rsquo;s truly you&rsquo;re known for</p>
<p>and remembered for.</p>
<p>So finding that balance is tricky.</p>
<p>I get that, but at the same time,</p>
<p>this might be my own copium,</p>
<p>which I know is a word you know now.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m slowly learning the full complexity</p>
<p>of the term, yes.</p>
<p>But the other way I think about it is,</p>
<p>it is a skill to learn how to communicate</p>
<p>with large audiences.</p>
<p>And first I started streaming chess,</p>
<p>which is something I just did and really loved,</p>
<p>but now I have to learn how to translate that format.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s a skillset we could build,</p>
<p>then we could use it to do really important things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of YouTubers</p>
<p>who have done interviews about how,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t love the kind of content they did at first,</p>
<p>but what they&rsquo;re doing right now is really meaningful.</p>
<p>So I like to think of it, maybe like skill development,</p>
<p>cause not everybody hits off podcasts</p>
<p>where they can talk to super interesting people</p>
<p>right off the bat.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can be slow and boring in a podcast.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry about the first 10 seconds.</p>
<p>I mean, people like keep pushing me for,</p>
<p>cause the first 10 seconds of the videos I do is,</p>
<p>well, I know it&rsquo;s most important for YouTube,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>
<p>I wrote a Chrome extension that hides</p>
<p>all the views and likes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at the click through.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at Twitch views, Andrea does.</p>
<p>So we also can relate.</p>
<p>I love numbers too, but that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t look at it.</p>
<p>Cause you become like, oh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start to think that a conversation</p>
<p>or I think you did sucks because it doesn&rsquo;t get views,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just not the case.</p>
<p>YouTube algorithm is this monster that figures stuff out.</p>
<p>And if you let it control your mind,</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s going to destroy you creatively.</p>
<p>So you have to find a nice balance.</p>
<p>I have to say, I was laughing a little bit</p>
<p>when I was listening to the Magnus episode</p>
<p>and the first 10 minutes,</p>
<p>you guys are talking about soccer, football.</p>
<p>Two robots seem human in the conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>I was like, let&rsquo;s have some fun,</p>
<p>make conversation about non chess related topics.</p>
<p>Yeah, talk about sports.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was kind of hilarious.</p>
<p>I was surprised that even at his level,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure, but I was surprised how much he loves chess.</p>
<p>It sounds cliche to say,</p>
<p>but like the way he looked at a chess board,</p>
<p>you know those memes like,</p>
<p>I wish somebody looked at me the way he still like</p>
<p>the way he glanced down and he reached for the pieces</p>
<p>with excitement to show me something.</p>
<p>There was, there wasn&rsquo;t like, okay, I&rsquo;ll show you.</p>
<p>It was like, like there was still that fire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that always shocks me</p>
<p>about some of like super grandmasters.</p>
<p>Like one of my coaches was a person who also,</p>
<p>his name&rsquo;s GM Hammer of Norway.</p>
<p>He also coached Magnus.</p>
<p>He was his second and he was helping me train</p>
<p>for my tournament.</p>
<p>And I was kind of putting off doing the homework.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re putting it off,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re studying the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Like you should be enjoying even when you&rsquo;re practicing,</p>
<p>which when I grew up, I thought to get to the top level,</p>
<p>like practicing has to be hard and unpleasant.</p>
<p>And when I was listening to Magnus episode,</p>
<p>he was like, I didn&rsquo;t read books very much.</p>
<p>Or there was one thing that you said</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like very normal for studying classical chess</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t do just because it didn&rsquo;t interest him.</p>
<p>He says, I suck at puzzles.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like puzzles.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he doesn&rsquo;t do what he doesn&rsquo;t enjoy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s like purely driven out of passion.</p>
<p>I think the internet was like, I suck at puzzles too.</p>
<p>Yeah, they like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re grandmasters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to study at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>And, but I think the lesson there that&rsquo;s really powerful</p>
<p>is he spends most of the day thinking about chess</p>
<p>because he wants to.</p>
<p>So do whatever, if you&rsquo;re into getting better at chess,</p>
<p>do whatever it takes to actually just the number of hours</p>
<p>you spend a day thinking about chess, maximize that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like super serious about it.</p>
<p>I actually get very addicted</p>
<p>whenever I start studying chess,</p>
<p>which is why I don&rsquo;t do it as seriously</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m focused on content.</p>
<p>Cause I go through these rabbit holes</p>
<p>where if I&rsquo;m focusing on chess,</p>
<p>I wanna be as good as I possibly can at the game.</p>
<p>Otherwise it&rsquo;s hard for me to enjoy it</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s such a competitive thing.</p>
<p>And I remember training for tournaments</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re training for tournaments,</p>
<p>you even start dreaming about chess</p>
<p>and you can stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re flipped</p>
<p>into this completely different world,</p>
<p>which is also what I like best about the game</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a completely different living experience.</p>
<p>And then you take some drugs</p>
<p>and now you start to see things on the ceiling.</p>
<p>Is there some factual hallucination</p>
<p>like to the Queen&rsquo;s Gambit, like those scenes?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that based on your life story?</p>
<p>Well, I can&rsquo;t say that on camera.</p>
<p>No, just kidding.</p>
<p>Actually chess players are very careful to not take drugs.</p>
<p>They drink a lot.</p>
<p>They drink so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually crazy for how good they&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to play chess when they do.</p>
<p>But when it comes to things like psychedelics</p>
<p>or other things, they usually stay away from those</p>
<p>cause they don&rsquo;t wanna mess anything up in their brain.</p>
<p>So this is actually intervention.</p>
<p>I saw that you mentioned somewhere,</p>
<p>I think it was the lie detector test</p>
<p>where you have a drinking problem.</p>
<p>Is that an actual&hellip;</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s actually a meme</p>
<p>that we like to joke about on stream</p>
<p>because occasionally we&rsquo;d have like a white claw on stream</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And then people meme about it.</p>
<p>It goes back to Andrea&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>of amplifying a part of your personality</p>
<p>to make yourself a little bit more entertaining.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna use that as an excuse from now on.</p>
<p>This podcast is just amplifying a part of that personality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really like this, but have you played drunk?</p>
<p>Like Magnus has played drunk.</p>
<p>He says it helps someone with the creativity.</p>
<p>Is there any truth to that?</p>
<p>Well, Andrea is under 21,</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s obviously would never do that.</p>
<p>But I have played while drinking.</p>
<p>Actually, I enjoy playing chess and drinking</p>
<p>more than pre gaming or going out to a club and drinking,</p>
<p>which sounds really silly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll usually play against opponents</p>
<p>who are also having some beer.</p>
<p>And it does make you feel like you&rsquo;re seeing the game</p>
<p>from a fresher perspective</p>
<p>where it can sometimes make you feel more confident,</p>
<p>liquid confidence, and it does help with creativity.</p>
<p>You just feel like you could pull things off,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a limit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like you&rsquo;ve had one drink or two drink,</p>
<p>but then it goes beyond that.</p>
<p>And then you just start missing tactics</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it only helps players</p>
<p>in very short time controls.</p>
<p>One time I was challenging this grandmaster on stream</p>
<p>and we were playing bullet chess,</p>
<p>which is one minute chess.</p>
<p>And I was giving him handicaps.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, you have to take four shots</p>
<p>before the next game.</p>
<p>And he just got like 10 times stronger</p>
<p>and transformed into like the Hulk</p>
<p>and destroyed me more than the last game.</p>
<p>But of course, if you&rsquo;re playing like a three hour game,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna get old.</p>
<p>But I think in short time controls, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely has to be blitz.</p>
<p>It has to be where it&rsquo;s more intuition</p>
<p>rather than sitting and calculating.</p>
<p>This is probably like negatively affecting</p>
<p>your ability to calculate.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>How much when you guys play,</p>
<p>when you look at the chess board,</p>
<p>how much of it is calculation?</p>
<p>How much of it is intuition?</p>
<p>How much of it is memorized openings?</p>
<p>It really depends between short form chess.</p>
<p>So five minutes, three minutes, one minute</p>
<p>and classical chess.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite to play?</p>
<p>I love playing blitz now because that&rsquo;s most of what I do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually how I got into chess streaming</p>
<p>because I couldn&rsquo;t spend entire weekends</p>
<p>or weeks playing tournaments.</p>
<p>I would just, while I was in college, log on</p>
<p>and play these long blitz or bullet sessions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very fast.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have time to go calculate as deeply.</p>
<p>You basically have to calculate short lines pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And a lot of it is pattern recognition and intuition.</p>
<p>As three minutes, you said?</p>
<p>Three minutes, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>And so for that, it&rsquo;s just basically intuition.</p>
<p>A lot of it is intuition, yeah.</p>
<p>See, I saw on streams you actually keep talking</p>
<p>while playing chess.</p>
<p>It seems really difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, that helps my result.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t help my result.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it hurts.</p>
<p>It helps content, not the game.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But you can still do it.</p>
<p>Because it feels like how can you possibly concentrate</p>
<p>while talking?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because so much of it is intuition.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, while you&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about that topic,</p>
<p>but then you just come to the board</p>
<p>and you just understand what you should be doing here.</p>
<p>And then sometimes you get in trouble</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re talking and you have now lost</p>
<p>half of your time.</p>
<p>You have a minute and a half, your opponent has three,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>But that kind of goes to show</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s how blitz chess usually works,</p>
<p>whereas classical is very different.</p>
<p>Which of you is better at chess?</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s do it this way.</p>
<p>Can you, Andrea, can you say what,</p>
<p>in which way is Alex stronger than you?</p>
<p>Which way is she weaker than you?</p>
<p>Not physically in terms of chess.</p>
<p>Well, yes, of course she is higher rated.</p>
<p>But when we do play, I think her strengths against me</p>
<p>where she really gets me is the end game.</p>
<p>She has stronger end game, so she can,</p>
<p>and I actually have a stronger opening,</p>
<p>but as soon as she&rsquo;s able to simplify.</p>
<p>Andrea, I&rsquo;m supposed to say what is good about you,</p>
<p>not you.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m getting there.</p>
<p>Well, see, this is what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>because don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s related, okay?</p>
<p>Because if I can get an advantage</p>
<p>in the beginning of the game,</p>
<p>but as soon as she starts trading pieces down,</p>
<p>like my confidence drops,</p>
<p>because I know that the end game</p>
<p>is the hardest part of the game and the longest,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where she ends up beating me.</p>
<p>So her end game is I think really what makes the difference.</p>
<p>It sounds like her psychological warfare is better too,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re getting nervous.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s harder to play against higher rated players,</p>
<p>same how Magnus and former world champions</p>
<p>have that psychological edge.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s always going to be different for Andrea,</p>
<p>because she knows statistically</p>
<p>she should be winning something like one in four games,</p>
<p>but she usually does better than that,</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s very distracting and talks a lot.</p>
<p>That does help.</p>
<p>What does it feel like to play a higher rated player?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the experience of that?</p>
<p>Playing somebody like Magnus.</p>
<p>So it depends on how much higher rated than you they are.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s like between me and Andrea,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a 200 point difference,</p>
<p>you know they should win,</p>
<p>but at least you still feel like you have a chance.</p>
<p>I was playing in a title Tuesday,</p>
<p>which is this tournament chess.com has every Tuesday.</p>
<p>And I got really lucky, beat a GM,</p>
<p>drew an international master,</p>
<p>and then I got paired against Hikaru Nakamura.</p>
<p>And my brain just went blank,</p>
<p>because I just know that I&rsquo;m so unlikely to win</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t even play the game properly</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s that much of a difference</p>
<p>where they should be winning like 99% of the time.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like psychological.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s the biggest experience</p>
<p>is like actually knowing the numbers</p>
<p>and statistically thinking there&rsquo;s no way I can win.</p>
<p>But I meant like, is there a suffocating feeling</p>
<p>like positionally you feel like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly under attack?</p>
<p>You just feel like you&rsquo;re slowly getting outsmarted.</p>
<p>And the worst is when you don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing wrong.</p>
<p>You come out of that and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I thought I was doing great and I got slowly squeezed.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand what was going on.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just kind of baffled.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like watching AlphaZero beat up Stockfish.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t really understand why it&rsquo;s making certain moves</p>
<p>or how it thought of the plan.</p>
<p>You just see it slowly getting the position better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it feels like.</p>
<p>I would add it&rsquo;s kind of different for me</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re someone who&rsquo;s significantly higher rated.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say more than like 300 points</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re playing Magnus.</p>
<p>What I notice is I just feel lost straight</p>
<p>as soon as I don&rsquo;t know my preparation</p>
<p>because they know so many opening lines</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna know the best line to beat you</p>
<p>that you haven&rsquo;t studied.</p>
<p>So then on move 10, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>he already has a maybe plus 0.5 advantage</p>
<p>which is really small.</p>
<p>But for someone with such a significant skill level</p>
<p>you know you already lost at that point.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a third of the game.</p>
<p>What are the strengths and weaknesses of Andrea?</p>
<p>Andrea is very good at opening preparation.</p>
<p>As she said.</p>
<p>As she said, she likes bringing that up.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s very meticulous about it</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;ll really go in and learn her lines.</p>
<p>And having that initial starting confidence</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just helpful for the opening</p>
<p>but it helps develop your plans for the middle game.</p>
<p>So I think she&rsquo;s very good at that.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s actually pretty good</p>
<p>at tactical combinations.</p>
<p>What is tactics?</p>
<p>Tactics is like solving puzzles</p>
<p>or basically finding lines that are forced</p>
<p>where if you find them, you&rsquo;re going to win.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like puzzles within a position.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Whereas strategic chess is making slow moves</p>
<p>and over the process of like 20 moves</p>
<p>you get a slightly better position based on</p>
<p>an understanding of the overall strategy.</p>
<p>So in my extensive research review on Wikipedia,</p>
<p>it says your most played opening</p>
<p>is the King&rsquo;s Indian defense.</p>
<p>In which, quote, black allows white</p>
<p>to advance their pawns to the center of the board</p>
<p>in the first two moves.</p>
<p>Is there any truth to this?</p>
<p>So the King&rsquo;s Indian.</p>
<p>And what is it?</p>
<p>Probably is my most played opening.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one where even when my coach</p>
<p>who was a grandmaster taught me,</p>
<p>he was like, so you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing the King&rsquo;s Indian for 10 years</p>
<p>and I still don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of those openings that computers</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t like because you do,</p>
<p>or at least Stockfish doesn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Maybe AlphaZero would change their mind.</p>
<p>I forgot to look at what.</p>
<p>Can you show me, by the way, what it is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it white&rsquo;s opening or black&rsquo;s opening?</p>
<p>Black responds to the D4 Queen&rsquo;s pawn push.</p>
<p>And you take your knight out to F6.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just put in the stereotypical,</p>
<p>classical King&rsquo;s Indian more so to say.</p>
<p>We actually have a very famous King&rsquo;s Indian game</p>
<p>in the notes that we prepared.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>For the record, I asked you guys for some games</p>
<p>that you find pretty cool</p>
<p>and maybe to get a chance to talk about some.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is the King&rsquo;s Indian.</p>
<p>As you can see, white has much more control</p>
<p>over the center.</p>
<p>White has three pawns in the center</p>
<p>while black has none past the fifth rank.</p>
<p>And you just have this pawn on D6.</p>
<p>And one of the ideas in chess is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not taking the center,</p>
<p>then your plan revolves around</p>
<p>trying to continually challenge it.</p>
<p>But what is really fun about the King&rsquo;s Indian</p>
<p>is that black sometimes gets these crazy King side attacks</p>
<p>while white gets Queen side attacks.</p>
<p>And even though it&rsquo;s a little bit suspicious for black</p>
<p>and the computer could usually break it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to defend as a human when you&rsquo;re being attacked.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t pull off the attack as black,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re just gonna end up being lost in the end game.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a very asymmetrical position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very asymmetrical,</p>
<p>although a lot of people now stop playing</p>
<p>into the classical King&rsquo;s Indian,</p>
<p>even though computers give it a big advantage.</p>
<p>And they play these slower lines in the King&rsquo;s Indian,</p>
<p>which are less fun to play.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s slower mean?</p>
<p>It takes a longer time to do something interesting with?</p>
<p>They basically don&rsquo;t let you get as much</p>
<p>of a King side attack</p>
<p>because they try opening up the center</p>
<p>and then you have no weaknesses,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re just slowly improving the position of your pieces</p>
<p>instead of being able to go for that King side attack.</p>
<p>So for people just listening,</p>
<p>there is the white pawns are all on the fourth row</p>
<p>in a row together.</p>
<p>That feels like a bad position.</p>
<p>For black?</p>
<p>For white.</p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t like taking the center?</p>
<p>No, I like taking the center.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re talking trash already.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just like they&rsquo;re like feel vulnerable</p>
<p>there in a row together.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re like, who&rsquo;s gonna defend them?</p>
<p>I guess the Knights defend and the Queen defends it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually talking about a theme</p>
<p>that you do see sometimes, which is called hanging pawns.</p>
<p>And when you have two pawns right next to each other</p>
<p>with no other pawns to defend them.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it is a valid point.</p>
<p>And actually as black,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to break apart these pawns</p>
<p>or get them to push and create some holes into the position,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a trade off.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a lot of what chess openings are about.</p>
<p>You get more space,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll also end up having to protect your pawns</p>
<p>potentially or move them forward to the point</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re overextended.</p>
<p>And plus pawns being vulnerable, it&rsquo;s kind of fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s more stuff in danger.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, cause if it&rsquo;s like this,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s like trapped, like you can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s blocked, yeah.</p>
<p>And blocked off, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you can&rsquo;t have fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the most,</p>
<p>one of the opening principles for white</p>
<p>is get your pawns in the center.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say like this is actually preferable for white.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go over some opening principles.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Cause this is a very good learning lesson</p>
<p>for any chess beginners in the audience.</p>
<p>Okay, so first thing you wanna do is control the center.</p>
<p>There we go, E4, the more aggressive one.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that like the basic vanilla move?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, somebody told me that&rsquo;s the most popular</p>
<p>opening move in chess.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Why is that considered aggressive?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s E4 and D4 and the king&rsquo;s pawn is known</p>
<p>as being for more tactical players,</p>
<p>whereas D4 is known for more positional players.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s considered more aggressive.</p>
<p>Tactical.</p>
<p>More gambits with E4, I think.</p>
<p>So tactical means I&rsquo;m gonna try to attack you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna try to go for puzzles</p>
<p>and rely more on your combination abilities.</p>
<p>Whereas if it&rsquo;s something positional,</p>
<p>you usually have like three to four moves</p>
<p>that are all good in the position,</p>
<p>whereas tactics, you need to see this one line.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more precise.</p>
<p>So this one&rsquo;s cool cause he can like,</p>
<p>the queen can come out, the bishop can come out.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s one of the most popular checkmates</p>
<p>and usually what you teach new students</p>
<p>to try to cheese their friends</p>
<p>cause then they feel really excited</p>
<p>that they know this new trap</p>
<p>where you bring the bishop and the queen out</p>
<p>and you try to checkmate on F7.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the trap that queen&rsquo;s gambit, Beth Harmon,</p>
<p>falls for in their first game versus the janitor.</p>
<p>She gets all mad cause she gets checkmated very early.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the one she gets checkmated with?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I love how you guys were actually paying attention</p>
<p>to the games carefully,</p>
<p>which is pretty cool that they did a good job</p>
<p>of improving, evolving her game throughout the show</p>
<p>to actually represent an actual growth of a chess player.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They really took every detail into consideration,</p>
<p>which was cool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what else?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I brought stuff into the center.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do the same.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then you want to develop your pieces.</p>
<p>So in the beginning of the game,</p>
<p>you want to take out the bishops and knights first</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to start</p>
<p>with the most valuable piece like the queen</p>
<p>cause then it&rsquo;ll become a vulnerability</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll get attacked very early on.</p>
<p>And the reason you&rsquo;re taking out these two pieces first</p>
<p>is cause you want to castle your king.</p>
<p>So you can move a knight move or a bishop move</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s considered developing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So at this stage, not like even before</p>
<p>getting a few pawns out.</p>
<p>You usually want to start with getting a pawn</p>
<p>because you want to get space in the center,</p>
<p>but also when you push pawns,</p>
<p>it helps free up some of your pieces.</p>
<p>So usually start with one pawn first</p>
<p>and then you could start taking out your minor pieces,</p>
<p>which is the bishop and the knight.</p>
<p>I have anxiety about a pawn just floating out there.</p>
<p>Defenseless.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not attacked yet.</p>
<p>See, those are what you call ghost threats.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re scared of something that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>So if I were to attack it.</p>
<p>Feel like there&rsquo;s a deeper thing going on here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re attacking the pawn in the center here</p>
<p>and it is vulnerable, but as soon as you do that,</p>
<p>I can develop my own knight and defend it as well.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And now for people just listening,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two pawns that just came out to meet each other</p>
<p>and a couple of knights.</p>
<p>You love the chess commentary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very poetic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The pawns met after midnight.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m going to romanticize the game a bit.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s, if you bring out the bishops</p>
<p>with the knights, you&rsquo;re matching that with the other.</p>
<p>Black is going to match it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Whatever you&rsquo;re attacking with.</p>
<p>Yep, he&rsquo;s developing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to defend it.</p>
<p>Now you could develop your bishop</p>
<p>or your knight, whatever you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>Oh no, now you give him options.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>Now I am attacking the pawn in the center,</p>
<p>which is what you were afraid about before,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s see how you defend it here.</p>
<p>By doing this symmetrical thing,</p>
<p>bringing out the knight on the other side.</p>
<p>And actually your other move was good as well,</p>
<p>defending with the pawn,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re freeing up space for your bishop.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically trying to develop your pieces</p>
<p>as quickly as possible, put your pawns in the center,</p>
<p>and then get your king to safety.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s usually the basic opening tips that you get.</p>
<p>And it is kind of counterintuitive</p>
<p>that safety is in the corner of the board for a king.</p>
<p>That was always confusing to me, but you know.</p>
<p>Three pawns in front,</p>
<p>though you typically don&rsquo;t push those.</p>
<p>Maybe like one, maybe I&rsquo;ll go one square,</p>
<p>but these will be like the wall of defense</p>
<p>that keep him safe.</p>
<p>But another way to also think about it</p>
<p>is your pieces usually wanna point towards the center.</p>
<p>If you have a knight closer to the center</p>
<p>than closer to the side,</p>
<p>it actually has more squares it can go to.</p>
<p>So a huge part of it is just wanting to have flexibility</p>
<p>for where your pieces go.</p>
<p>So more pieces are going to be able to make threats</p>
<p>in the center or even open up the position.</p>
<p>So since that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s most likely to open,</p>
<p>you want your king somewhere</p>
<p>where the position will stay closed</p>
<p>so that you have the pawns to defend.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like rules like this,</p>
<p>but I always wonder,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve built chess engines,</p>
<p>but then you start to wonder like,</p>
<p>why is it that positionally these things are good?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve built up an intuition about it,</p>
<p>but I wish, and that&rsquo;s the thing that would be amazing</p>
<p>if engines could explain,</p>
<p>why is this kind of thing better than this kind of thing?</p>
<p>You start to build up an intuition,</p>
<p>but if I&rsquo;m just like knowing nothing about chess,</p>
<p>it feels confusing that cornering your king,</p>
<p>like getting him like trapped here.</p>
<p>Like it feels like you could get checkmated easier there</p>
<p>if I was just using like dumb intuition,</p>
<p>but it seems like that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>I imagine maybe, cause AlphaZero learned</p>
<p>by playing games against itself, right?</p>
<p>And I imagine if you have a lot of games</p>
<p>and you do build an intuition,</p>
<p>because if you were to keep your king in the center,</p>
<p>you just see that in those games,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with threats a lot more often.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s shortcut rules</p>
<p>and this doesn&rsquo;t even mean it&rsquo;s the best way to play chess</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve seen with AlphaZero</p>
<p>kind of changing the rules of the game a little bit.</p>
<p>But as a human, to learn it from scratch</p>
<p>is a lot more difficult than to start with principles.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why beginners usually learn chess this way.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you&rsquo;re playing other humans</p>
<p>and the other humans have also operated</p>
<p>on a different principles.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why people that come up now</p>
<p>that are training with engines</p>
<p>are just going to be much better</p>
<p>than the people of the past</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna try out weirder ideas</p>
<p>that go against the principles of old.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna do like weird stuff,</p>
<p>including sacrifices and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I also think that&rsquo;s why AlphaZero was so shocking</p>
<p>because Stockfish was using an opening database.</p>
<p>So it was already based off of knowledge</p>
<p>that humans have from playing chess for years</p>
<p>that we just thought is how you&rsquo;re supposed to play.</p>
<p>Whereas AlphaZero just learned</p>
<p>from playing the game so many times</p>
<p>and came up with very novel opening ideas.</p>
<p>Were you impressed by AlphaZero?</p>
<p>Have you seen some of the games?</p>
<p>I have seen some of the games.</p>
<p>I think impressed, bewildered, and motivated</p>
<p>were the three things I experienced.</p>
<p>I think Magnus said he was also impressed</p>
<p>that it could easily be mistaken for creativity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his trash talk towards the AI.</p>
<p>That was a beautiful sentence.</p>
<p>I was listening to the podcast.</p>
<p>I mean, as a human, I agree with him</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t wanna give the machine</p>
<p>the power of creativity,</p>
<p>but if it looks creative, give it a compliment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>I know that you&rsquo;re being nice to the machines</p>
<p>in case they are ever looking back through this.</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>What other principles are there for the opening?</p>
<p>You can go a little bit more forward, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Yeah, we can finish full development.</p>
<p>Positions like this, let&rsquo;s just say</p>
<p>you developed all of your pieces.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like a really nice,</p>
<p>like nobody took any pieces</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just in a nice positional thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s not actually a very accurate one.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually, I could put a different one on the board,</p>
<p>but usually after you&rsquo;ve developed all of your pieces,</p>
<p>you wanna get your queen out a little bit</p>
<p>to connect your rooks,</p>
<p>and you also start thinking about certain pawn pushes</p>
<p>and getting more space.</p>
<p>But another good tip is just can you improve</p>
<p>the position of your pieces?</p>
<p>Think about timing.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve already moved a piece once</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a piece that hasn&rsquo;t moved at all,</p>
<p>then you wanna focus on the piece that hasn&rsquo;t moved at all</p>
<p>to be able to have it more likely to jump into the game.</p>
<p>Right, so don&rsquo;t move pieces multiple times.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Like try to move it to the most optimal position.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>What, so what&rsquo;s the Indian,</p>
<p>I think we kind of went over it,</p>
<p>but did you ever say why you like it so much?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s weird?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s king size?</p>
<p>I liked it because it&rsquo;s a very fun, aggressive defense</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just throwing your pieces towards white,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many sacrificing opportunities.</p>
<p>And for some reason,</p>
<p>tactical games always feel like the most beautiful,</p>
<p>the most satisfying,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I liked about the King&rsquo;s Indian.</p>
<p>But I also suffered a lot from this love</p>
<p>because I would play things</p>
<p>that are not necessarily correct,</p>
<p>then my attack wouldn&rsquo;t pan out,</p>
<p>and then I would just struggle the rest of the game</p>
<p>having no play and just trying to defend.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re always attacking,</p>
<p>Wikipedia also says that,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re known for your attacking play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also known for losses according to Stanford.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s not bring that up.</p>
<p>See Wikipedia doesn&rsquo;t talk trash,</p>
<p>it just says nice things.</p>
<p>Yeah, Wikipedia&rsquo;s a lot nicer.</p>
<p>I actually played a lot of positional chess in classic</p>
<p>because I really like the slow squeeze,</p>
<p>but when I transitioned to playing a lot of online chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost as if I was looking</p>
<p>for more instant gratification</p>
<p>because it feels so much better</p>
<p>to beat someone with an attack.</p>
<p>And even if sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t pan out,</p>
<p>I was okay with it because you get so many games in.</p>
<p>So I think my style in online chess</p>
<p>really changed from my classical chess.</p>
<p>What about you Andrea?</p>
<p>Do you have a style?</p>
<p>Are you attacking?</p>
<p>Are you a more like conservative defensive player?</p>
<p>Are you chaotic?</p>
<p>Opening wise, I like to play more positionally.</p>
<p>Like I like to push T4 and just slowly improve my pieces</p>
<p>and slowly get an attack.</p>
<p>But like Alex said, if you&rsquo;re playing bullet chess</p>
<p>or blitz against viewers,</p>
<p>you often like wanna play riskier moves</p>
<p>that may not be as good.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s kind of when I would play more aggressive.</p>
<p>But I do enjoy tournaments for that reason</p>
<p>because then like once you&rsquo;re 15 moves in,</p>
<p>which as soon as you&rsquo;re out of your prep,</p>
<p>I like sitting and thinking in more positional,</p>
<p>yeah, positional middle games.</p>
<p>One of the games you found to be pretty cool</p>
<p>was the Hakara Nakamura versus Galfan in 2009.</p>
<p>And that one I think includes the King&rsquo;s Indian defense.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Why is that an interesting one to you?</p>
<p>I also play the King&rsquo;s Indian as black</p>
<p>and I love this model game.</p>
<p>But as Alex was saying,</p>
<p>like all these advantages for the King&rsquo;s Indian.</p>
<p>But now there&rsquo;s this one line</p>
<p>that like every higher rated player</p>
<p>just destroys my King&rsquo;s Indian.</p>
<p>And you see these beautiful games and like,</p>
<p>ah, yes, I wanna play for these ideas.</p>
<p>But now no one plays into it anymore</p>
<p>and you just get demolished.</p>
<p>So this is why I don&rsquo;t play the King&rsquo;s Indian anymore,</p>
<p>but not to ruin the fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a love hate relationship, truly.</p>
<p>The reality.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like the higher level players do</p>
<p>or does everybody?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you&rsquo;re studying openings</p>
<p>and you know this line as white,</p>
<p>you just, you automatically get the upper edge.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of how openings develop.</p>
<p>You start having players trying new lines</p>
<p>and then you see ones and then everybody adopts it</p>
<p>if they think it&rsquo;s the best one.</p>
<p>But yeah, so Hikaru is really known</p>
<p>for his aggressive style of play.</p>
<p>Is Hikaru black here or what?</p>
<p>Yeah, Hikaru is black here.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s playing the King&rsquo;s Indian.</p>
<p>And as you can see in this position,</p>
<p>white already has a lot, a huge center advantage.</p>
<p>But what Hikaru is gonna start doing</p>
<p>even with the next move is bringing all of his pieces</p>
<p>towards the white King side,</p>
<p>because his plan is to start pushing his pawns</p>
<p>towards the white King and ignore the attack</p>
<p>that goes on in the Queen side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of the dream attack with the King&rsquo;s Indian.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a complete asymmetry towards the King side</p>
<p>and the left side of the board is a ton of pieces.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Wow, he moved the knight like three times in a row.</p>
<p>Yep, and that&rsquo;s what you need to do</p>
<p>because you have to move the knight</p>
<p>in order to make space for your pawn.</p>
<p>So again, this is why it&rsquo;s so counterintuitive</p>
<p>and Stockfish doesn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting almost most of your pieces on the back rank</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re pushing your King side pawns</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re blocking your own dark squared Bishop.</p>
<p>So none of it makes sense.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re mimicking it, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Okay, so yeah, here you see white going</p>
<p>for a Queen side attack,</p>
<p>black going for the King side attack</p>
<p>and you can keep going a little bit</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll wait to where he starts with the pretty sacrifices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more fun to analyze games in person</p>
<p>than on the computer, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so here Hikaru is preparing the attack</p>
<p>and what I really like about this game</p>
<p>is that he finds these tactics</p>
<p>that are not necessarily what a computer would go for</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very hard to face as a human</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why a lot of people play the King&rsquo;s Indian</p>
<p>because in practice it&rsquo;s hard to defend against.</p>
<p>So we can keep moving a little bit forward.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yep, so white is just continuing the King side plan.</p>
<p>No, is that like the first piece</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s taken in the game?</p>
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s the first trade.</p>
<p>Attack begins.</p>
<p>Exactly, Hikaru had to pause his attack for a little bit</p>
<p>to just make sure that white didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>two dire threats on the Queen side.</p>
<p>So cool to see the asymmetry of this thing.</p>
<p>Exactly, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s beautiful about the King&rsquo;s Indian.</p>
<p>And just one thing to highlight</p>
<p>because his rook move here is very bizarre</p>
<p>and typically like a computer probably didn&rsquo;t like this</p>
<p>but the ideas are interesting</p>
<p>because this is a major weakness for black</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re coming to attack</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s also making room for his Bishop</p>
<p>to come backwards and challenge.</p>
<p>So this is like a human like maneuver</p>
<p>that computers would like.</p>
<p>I think computers would like this though</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d have to move it regardless</p>
<p>because he takes the pawn here</p>
<p>and his rook would be under attack.</p>
<p>Yeah, well having looked at it,</p>
<p>when I actually studied this as a line</p>
<p>and this right away isn&rsquo;t the best move cutting computer.</p>
<p>So actually that&rsquo;s such a good question.</p>
<p>So do you guys when you study games use your mind</p>
<p>but do you also use computers to build up your intuition</p>
<p>of like looking at a position like this</p>
<p>and what would a computer do</p>
<p>and then try to understand why it wants to do that?</p>
<p>When I was studying seriously</p>
<p>I would try to use my own mind</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re never gonna get the exact same position</p>
<p>so you really need to notice trends</p>
<p>and often computers will give you moves</p>
<p>that are only specific to that position</p>
<p>because of a certain tactic.</p>
<p>But I do use computers to check what I did</p>
<p>and make sure I didn&rsquo;t make any obvious blunder</p>
<p>that I might have missed.</p>
<p>What does a computer tell you?</p>
<p>Just like what is the best move</p>
<p>or does it give you any kind of explanation of why?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t tell you why</p>
<p>but it gives you the different valuations of the position</p>
<p>like black is down a half pawn here or something like that</p>
<p>but it hints you towards what the right move is</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s on you to figure out why</p>
<p>and you can usually figure out why if not right away</p>
<p>then just by going through a few moves</p>
<p>and being like, oh, okay, that makes sense.</p>
<p>I feel like a computer will take you down</p>
<p>with some weird lines potentially like sacrifice.</p>
<p>Like why the hell am I sacrificing this?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll get to the pretty sacrifice soon.</p>
<p>So we could just keep playing.</p>
<p>The pawns are being pushed forward.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Hikaru is kind of ignoring</p>
<p>the queen side attack here.</p>
<p>They basically both only reply to each other&rsquo;s plan</p>
<p>when they have to.</p>
<p>This is where you convert all the podcast viewers</p>
<p>to YouTube.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They have no idea what we&rsquo;re talking about right now.</p>
<p>There is a Zen like experience</p>
<p>of just like listening and imagining.</p>
<p>The board.</p>
<p>Just imagine the pieces on the ceiling.</p>
<p>Yeah, we should be calling them out</p>
<p>and then people will be freaking out even more.</p>
<p>Am I supposed to keep track of what the position is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too many.</p>
<p>How hard is blindfold chess?</p>
<p>Have you tried?</p>
<p>Like are you able to keep the mind?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played blindfold chess before.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s pretty hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a muscle that I&rsquo;ve trained as much</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very visual when it comes to chess.</p>
<p>But it is one as a top player</p>
<p>that starts becoming very second nature for you.</p>
<p>Actually, this is what, I talked to Magnus about this.</p>
<p>Maybe I was, again, influenced by Queen&rsquo;s Gambit.</p>
<p>What do you actually visualize when it&rsquo;s in your head?</p>
<p>So for Magnus, it was a boring 2D board.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Do you have some kind of?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s every chess player, no.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have like,</p>
<p>cause you know some chess like computer games,</p>
<p>you can do all kinds of skins and like fancy stuff.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any fancy stuff?</p>
<p>Sadly, I don&rsquo;t have like a cool 3D warrior mode on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the basic.</p>
<p>I just have the default chess base board in my head.</p>
<p>Cause you don&rsquo;t, yeah, you can&rsquo;t use your brain power</p>
<p>for adding colors to it</p>
<p>cause you already have to keep track of the pieces.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one board at a time?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The current position.</p>
<p>Yeah, I bet every chess.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s any who hit it differently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain players who are really good</p>
<p>and they can even play blindfold chess</p>
<p>and play multiple games at the same time.</p>
<p>So I would be curious how they do it.</p>
<p>But usually when you&rsquo;re thinking of one game,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only one in your mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you have to do this operation</p>
<p>where you move one piece.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing like the branch analysis.</p>
<p>Like, and so you still have to somehow visualize</p>
<p>the branching process and not forget stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s like constant memory recall or something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always looking at one board at a time, but.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also, oh, cause you&rsquo;re also looking in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cause then you have to back track.</p>
<p>Calculating variations and coming back.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;re keeping the position in your memory.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re remembering where all the pieces are</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re playing it out on one board</p>
<p>and then you can come back to the initial one</p>
<p>that you started with that you kind of just keep</p>
<p>in your brain and it&rsquo;s also easier to come back to it</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve played a position from it.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s that memory recall</p>
<p>that gets you to blunder.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll like see that I&rsquo;m being attacked by certain things,</p>
<p>but then because I get so exhausted thinking</p>
<p>about a different thing, I forget,</p>
<p>I actually forget about an entire branch of things</p>
<p>that I was supposed to be worried about.</p>
<p>It happens very often.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you spend a bunch of time calculating in a position,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say like when you&rsquo;re really in trouble</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re spending 15, 20 minutes calculating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll forget about something that you spotted like,</p>
<p>oh, if I do these two, three moves, I&rsquo;ll walk into a trap</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve looked at so many lines and then you play it</p>
<p>and then you see it and you&rsquo;re like, oh, I looked at it</p>
<p>and I saw it, but I forgot about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often called tunneling where you&rsquo;re just looking</p>
<p>so deeply on one thing you forget about the rest</p>
<p>of the board.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the worst when, at least in a beginner level,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a, I don&rsquo;t know, a Bishop just sitting there,</p>
<p>obviously attacking your like queen or something.</p>
<p>And then you just forget that Bishop exists.</p>
<p>Cause if they just sit there for a few moves</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t move, you just forget their existence.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s just, yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely very embarrassing.</p>
<p>Well, it happens to everyone, so.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Okay, so we see a few trades happening on the queen side</p>
<p>where he had to go for those, otherwise he&rsquo;s in trouble.</p>
<p>And this is where the game, oh, sorry.</p>
<p>This is where it gets exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Knight H4 is really when the sacrifice starts.</p>
<p>And here the two important pawns are the ones in front</p>
<p>of the King, cause they&rsquo;re helping with the entire defense</p>
<p>and Hikaru is actually preparing to sacrifice his Knight</p>
<p>for a pawn just so that he can continue his attack</p>
<p>and open up the position.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t do that here as black</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t get some kind of attack,</p>
<p>you are completely lost on the queen side.</p>
<p>And also you&rsquo;ve pushed all of your own king side pawns,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna be in danger.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of those do or die moments.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, so that&rsquo;s what makes it all in,</p>
<p>cause the King is wide open.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, the King is wide open</p>
<p>and all of White&rsquo;s pieces are pointed</p>
<p>towards the queen side too, where you&rsquo;re also cramped.</p>
<p>So is the attack primarily by black done</p>
<p>by the two pawns and the Knight?</p>
<p>And the light squared Bishop is always extremely important.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t wanna trade this in the King&rsquo;s Indian</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very helpful for a lot of attacks.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s on the other side of the board,</p>
<p>I guess it can go all the way across in,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not sure what it&rsquo;s doing here,</p>
<p>but probably threatening.</p>
<p>Like for example, if it was another move black</p>
<p>could have played would be something like Bishop H3,</p>
<p>where if you take the Bishop,</p>
<p>you actually get mated on G2.</p>
<p>With what?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you take here</p>
<p>and then you could push the pawn</p>
<p>and then it would be checkmate.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of using your Bishop to sacrifice</p>
<p>against White&rsquo;s King side pawns.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll be freaking out if their Bishop did that.</p>
<p>What are they up to?</p>
<p>Right, and that&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>this position looks very scary as White</p>
<p>because all of Black&rsquo;s pawns are starting</p>
<p>to come towards you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of those things where humans</p>
<p>do start to worry in these positions,</p>
<p>whereas computers obviously can just calculate</p>
<p>the best line and maybe the attack doesn&rsquo;t go through.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying the computer might say</p>
<p>that the White is actually a slight favorite here?</p>
<p>Yeah, potentially.</p>
<p>Okay, so then White makes a little bit of room</p>
<p>by moving the Rook.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the attack begins.</p>
<p>I like the commentary here.</p>
<p>The Knight is hugging the King.</p>
<p>And actually White can&rsquo;t even take the King here</p>
<p>because then H4 and H3 is coming in.</p>
<p>White can&rsquo;t take the Knight.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh did I say King?</p>
<p>Yes, thank you, the Knight.</p>
<p>White can&rsquo;t take the Knight because why?</p>
<p>So if White takes the Knight here,</p>
<p>then Black starts pushing his pawn to H4</p>
<p>with H3 incoming and the idea of trying</p>
<p>to defend against this is, it looks very difficult.</p>
<p>So White just chooses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be cool to watch a chess game,</p>
<p>to experience watching it without understanding it</p>
<p>just for a day.</p>
<p>Feel like I could use that to make better content.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what getting drunk does.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for chess players,</p>
<p>it never leaves your brain.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter how.</p>
<p>But this is actually a very cute move</p>
<p>because Black&rsquo;s Queen is under attack,</p>
<p>but the King is so cramped that he can&rsquo;t actually take it</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s gonna get checkmated by a pawn,</p>
<p>which is a sad way to go cruelly.</p>
<p>Yeah, those pawns are doing a lot of work here.</p>
<p>They really are.</p>
<p>That is the King&rsquo;s Indian.</p>
<p>This is the King&rsquo;s Indian player&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>The attack of the King side pawns.</p>
<p>Yeah, these pawns are like, right,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re the ones that are doing a lot</p>
<p>of the threatening.</p>
<p>Right, and they&rsquo;re also opening up the position</p>
<p>to bring more of the pieces in.</p>
<p>But the pawns kind of help break open the King side,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t checkmate by themselves.</p>
<p>So after the pawns come in,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you need to start bringing in pieces as well,</p>
<p>which you will see Ahi Kar do here.</p>
<p>Okay. There you go.</p>
<p>He puts. One more sacrifice.</p>
<p>This was actually another beautiful sacrifice in the game.</p>
<p>But then puts the King in check with a pawn.</p>
<p>Right, and the pawn is going to be given here for free,</p>
<p>but the idea is you&rsquo;re giving your own piece</p>
<p>because you want to have more space and open up the King,</p>
<p>which is what you&rsquo;re always trying to do</p>
<p>when you have a King side.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to remove as many of the King&rsquo;s defenders</p>
<p>as you can without giving up too much.</p>
<p>And then you have a ton of pieces on the King side</p>
<p>for black, just waiting to.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>To do harm.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>And notice how every single move,</p>
<p>white is getting attacked.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re just never getting a break.</p>
<p>Black just keeps throwing all their pieces.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny that black&rsquo;s Queen has been hanging</p>
<p>for like three moves now</p>
<p>and white still can&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>So rook puts the King in check.</p>
<p>The King runs.</p>
<p>And then again, we leave the Queen hanging</p>
<p>and you develop a piece,</p>
<p>this light squared Bishop that&rsquo;s so important,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re once again threatening checkmate on G2.</p>
<p>And then Bishops coming to the game.</p>
<p>Once again, the Queen hanging.</p>
<p>I mean, the game is just so beautiful.</p>
<p>The amount of calculation Hikaru put into this position.</p>
<p>It feels like so much is in danger.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>And Knight takes what?</p>
<p>A pawns.</p>
<p>So now his Queen is attacked twice</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>He takes the Bishop</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s still threatening the checkmate on G2.</p>
<p>And then the Queen takes the Bishop.</p>
<p>So now he&rsquo;s defending against G2</p>
<p>and black just goes and grabs some material back here.</p>
<p>So here, black is already is winning.</p>
<p>Well, he ends up winning a Knight here</p>
<p>because black had to be so much on the defensive.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just taking pieces.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean at this point,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re up two whole pieces.</p>
<p>So you knew it was in here.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>And Queen.</p>
<p>Queen.</p>
<p>And then you take,</p>
<p>and then the rook takes</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not as much of an attack on the King anymore,</p>
<p>but Hikaru is up a Knight here,</p>
<p>which is GG.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s the correct way of saying that?</p>
<p>Because I played Demis Hassabis.</p>
<p>I played him in chess.</p>
<p>And then I quickly realized like from his facial expressions</p>
<p>that I should have like stopped playing.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>It was like, it&rsquo;s already set.</p>
<p>Yeah, when it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s like, like, this is the good time to like,</p>
<p>give up.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna get to checkmate where like this,</p>
<p>you know, he could see like,</p>
<p>the checkmate is like five or seven moves away or something.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the play?</p>
<p>Usually you have to resign if you&rsquo;re in a position</p>
<p>or you should through chess etiquette resign</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a position where your opponent</p>
<p>is definitely gonna win out of respect.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re a piece down.</p>
<p>And obviously all top grandmasters do that.</p>
<p>The only people who don&rsquo;t do that is kids</p>
<p>because their coaches.</p>
<p>They love to play till the checkmate.</p>
<p>Their coaches always tell them never resign</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be in hopelessly lost positions</p>
<p>playing against like two rooks, a king,</p>
<p>and they only have their sole king,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still playing on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a position where it&rsquo;s obvious they can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>Because the kids might make errors.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And so it might as well.</p>
<p>That was the interesting thing about,</p>
<p>I think game six of the previous world championship</p>
<p>with Magnus.</p>
<p>Was it the one where he beat Nap?</p>
<p>Yeah, the first time he beat him,</p>
<p>where it was like, he said that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how often you come across</p>
<p>this kind of situation.</p>
<p>He said, the engines predict a draw,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s going to be a draw.</p>
<p>So you play on hoping that you take a person into,</p>
<p>I mean, this is, I guess, an end game thing.</p>
<p>You take them to deep water</p>
<p>and they make a positional mistake or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when, like he from his gut knows</p>
<p>that this is supposed to be a draw,</p>
<p>but he still plays on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that is one where</p>
<p>it could theoretically be a draw,</p>
<p>but it could be very hard to defend</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a hard technique to know as a human.</p>
<p>And especially in that game,</p>
<p>I know that Nepo was also in time pressure,</p>
<p>which makes it even harder.</p>
<p>So in situations like that, you should always continue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more where an engine would give you something</p>
<p>like plus 10 or something where it&rsquo;s not just clearly a win,</p>
<p>but anybody would know how to win.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re usually supposed to resign.</p>
<p>So what do you find beautiful about this game?</p>
<p>Is it the attacking chess and just the asymmetry of it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the asymmetry.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the fact that this is the dream</p>
<p>for the King&rsquo;s Indian,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re able to get a beautiful attack.</p>
<p>And there was also those two really nice sacrifices</p>
<p>where Black just continuously kept putting pressure</p>
<p>on White&rsquo;s King to the point where he was able</p>
<p>to win material.</p>
<p>And the best part of it is that if the attack didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>out, Black would have been completely lost.</p>
<p>How often does that happen, by the way?</p>
<p>Like as an attacking player,</p>
<p>how often do you put yourself in the position of like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m screwed unless this works out?</p>
<p>In online chess more than I should.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s usually when I sacrifice,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s either gonna work or I&rsquo;m lost.</p>
<p>And those are the most fun positions to play usually.</p>
<p>But in tournaments, if you&rsquo;re doing a sacrifice,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re playing it with 100% confidence</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re taking the time to calculate it.</p>
<p>But yeah, when you have three minutes,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>So you take a whim and you follow your intuition</p>
<p>and you find out later.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re very confident it&rsquo;ll work</p>
<p>and you haven&rsquo;t calculated all the way until the end,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve calculated to the point where you have enough</p>
<p>in exchange for the sack</p>
<p>and you think you could play that position.</p>
<p>How do you train chess these days?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, do you practice?</p>
<p>Do you do deliberate practice?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re in this tough position</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re also a creator and educator and entertainer.</p>
<p>So do you try to put in time of like daily practice?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t train chess anymore when I&rsquo;m focusing on creating.</p>
<p>I do if I&rsquo;m preparing for a tournament.</p>
<p>But back in the day,</p>
<p>I would train very seriously for tournaments.</p>
<p>And the way it would work is I do opening preparation</p>
<p>for a specific tournament</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when you really need to have</p>
<p>those lines memorized</p>
<p>and you could also prepare for specific opponents.</p>
<p>And I would do tactics to make sure I stay sharp.</p>
<p>So those were the two things I would do every single day</p>
<p>for a tournament and then mix up the rest</p>
<p>with like maybe some end games,</p>
<p>maybe some positional chess.</p>
<p>So what does tactics preparation looks like?</p>
<p>Do you do like a puzzle, like a random puzzle thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would just train puzzles</p>
<p>for at least like 30 to 60 minutes or books.</p>
<p>And sometimes you were,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s different kinds of puzzles.</p>
<p>One you could train for pattern recognition</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re supposed to go through them very quickly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just so that when you&rsquo;re playing the game,</p>
<p>if your mind is tired,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still keeping track of things</p>
<p>a little bit more easily.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re practicing your combination</p>
<p>and those sometimes take like 20 minutes to find</p>
<p>because you have to just calculate a lot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more like making sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve trained with that muscle.</p>
<p>But Andrea is actually very good at finding ways</p>
<p>to balance and still study while also doing content.</p>
<p>Yeah, so what, you&rsquo;re able to do both?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hard thing.</p>
<p>I was getting very irritated with content</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m very competitive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like playing chess if I&rsquo;m losing.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re talking and entertaining,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be losing more games than winning.</p>
<p>So then I started doing more training streams</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;d bring on my coach.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I wanted to add</p>
<p>to Alex&rsquo;s training repertoire.</p>
<p>So I would do daily puzzles every time I&rsquo;m streaming,</p>
<p>which helped me a lot, even if it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this thing on chess.com called Puzzle Rush,</p>
<p>where you have three minutes</p>
<p>and you just do puzzle after puzzle</p>
<p>where they get incrementally harder.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a really good way</p>
<p>to build your pattern recognition,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re rusty.</p>
<p>So I would do that till I hit a high score</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t play any blitz</p>
<p>until I hit the score that I want.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of more like the fun part of chess studying.</p>
<p>The very important one is actually analyzing your losses</p>
<p>in your tournament games.</p>
<p>And first you sit and you look through your mistake yourself</p>
<p>and try to see if you can find the better moves.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when you would check over with a computer</p>
<p>to see if you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>So game analysis is also very important, which I try to do.</p>
<p>I remember to give a shout out,</p>
<p>I listened to a couple of episodes</p>
<p>of the Perpetual Chess Podcast, which is pretty good.</p>
<p>But whatever I listened to, I remember the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I think they really focus on like teaching people.</p>
<p>How to train.</p>
<p>Yeah, how to play, how to train, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They do like, yeah, I&rsquo;m looking now, adult improver.</p>
<p>So basically like how do regular noobs get better at chess?</p>
<p>One of the things that, one of the person that said,</p>
<p>I think he was the grandmaster, but he said,</p>
<p>to maximize the amount of time you spend every day of like,</p>
<p>basically as you were saying, like suffering.</p>
<p>So like you, it&rsquo;s not about the,</p>
<p>like you should be thinking.</p>
<p>You should be doing calculating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the opposite of what Magnus said.</p>
<p>Like you should be doing a lot of time.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the puzzle is</p>
<p>or whatever the hell you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but you should be like doing that difficult calculation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you get better.</p>
<p>Yeah, it really depends what you&rsquo;re training.</p>
<p>Cause I used to think the same,</p>
<p>but it depends what you&rsquo;re weaker at.</p>
<p>Cause if you&rsquo;re doing the really difficult puzzles,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re training for like visualization</p>
<p>and calculating more moves ahead than you typically would,</p>
<p>which maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t get into that as often</p>
<p>in a regular game because typically you run into like</p>
<p>three to four tactics, which are actually the easier</p>
<p>and more fun ones to solve.</p>
<p>So it really depends.</p>
<p>And on top of that, as a hobbyist,</p>
<p>your motivation is very different</p>
<p>than when you&rsquo;re playing from a young age</p>
<p>and have pretty high competitive ambition.</p>
<p>And a lot of people who are new to chess,</p>
<p>you could basically work on anything and still improve.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re focusing on something you like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably gonna stick to it more</p>
<p>and be more consistent,</p>
<p>which I think is more helpful longterm.</p>
<p>What was the most embarrassing loss of your career?</p>
<p>I had so many flashbacks,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s a question for Andrea.</p>
<p>I like that you specified.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Cause.</p>
<p>I mean, because you said you&rsquo;re so competitive and like.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no.</p>
<p>I could tell just even from the way you said it,</p>
<p>that like you hate losing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that was the reason I hated chess</p>
<p>in high school, cause it&rsquo;d always be like,</p>
<p>but okay, there&rsquo;s many traumatizing losses</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like your top three, you&rsquo;re running for first.</p>
<p>And then you throw a game you shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and this shouldn&rsquo;t hurt my ego as much as it does,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always kids.</p>
<p>Or when I was a high school girl,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the younger boys who are really cocky.</p>
<p>And when they win, they start rubbing it in your face</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re yawning and looking around</p>
<p>when like 90% of the game you were destroying them</p>
<p>and you had this one tiny mistake</p>
<p>and now their ego&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll never forget I was playing like</p>
<p>for a chess scholarship.</p>
<p>And it was tiebreaker for first,</p>
<p>and I think I lost to a 12 year old girl</p>
<p>who couldn&rsquo;t even use the scholarship,</p>
<p>but she beat me in one first place</p>
<p>and she got some other prize.</p>
<p>So yeah, I was losing to that little girl</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s literally like 2300 now, so makes sense.</p>
<p>Right, you keep telling yourself that.</p>
<p>What do you think, do you think Gasparro was feeling that</p>
<p>when he was playing 13 year old Magnus?</p>
<p>Like why?</p>
<p>As much as it&rsquo;s a beauty of the sport</p>
<p>that any age can be brilliant, any demographic, anything,</p>
<p>I feel like when you&rsquo;re adults</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re paired against the kid,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just hard not to let it get to you.</p>
<p>And it depends, maybe if they&rsquo;re a really sweet kid,</p>
<p>but most of the times I play kids,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just really arrogant.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think they do it intentionally</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re kids.</p>
<p>I mean, there is a certain etiquette thing</p>
<p>where like you said, yawning, and in general,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re kids, there&rsquo;s no etiquette.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Yeah, the kids traumatized me too.</p>
<p>I was playing in Vegas and it was not even my opponent.</p>
<p>It was the board next to me.</p>
<p>And the kid was at least 10 years old, 12 max,</p>
<p>and he was playing against an adult</p>
<p>and he takes out his hand and he starts doing a fake phone</p>
<p>to which the kid sitting across diagonally</p>
<p>picks up their banana and starts talking like it&rsquo;s a phone</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just mouthing words</p>
<p>while their two adult opponents</p>
<p>are thinking intensely at the game.</p>
<p>And then I see the adult look up, look at the kid,</p>
<p>just making banana phone and the despair in his eyes</p>
<p>as he sighs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not even doing it for trash talk.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just bored.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just bored kids.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>What was the,</p>
<p>cause you play a bunch of people for your channel.</p>
<p>What was the most like memorable?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most fun, most intense?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of fun ones.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve played kids before, some trash talking kids.</p>
<p>That sounds great.</p>
<p>They trash talk kids.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nothing like losing a 12 year old</p>
<p>who then starts doing a Fortnite dance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that actually happened?</p>
<p>That did happen.</p>
<p>He is a very young master.</p>
<p>I think he became master</p>
<p>when he was like nine years old or something.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s very good at chess and doing a lot of training,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also incredibly good at trash talking.</p>
<p>And he beat me one game and he stood up</p>
<p>and he started doing the Fortnite dance.</p>
<p>So you gotta just swallow your pride in those moments.</p>
<p>What is that culture of like street chess players?</p>
<p>It seems pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that seems to be celebrating the beauty of the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the trash talking, but also having fun with it,</p>
<p>but also taking it seriously.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve done a few of those.</p>
<p>Did you go to New York?</p>
<p>Yeah, in Union Square Park in Washington Square.</p>
<p>What was that like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a unique place.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen it anywhere else in the US</p>
<p>where people are just professional chess hustlers,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not necessarily a top player,</p>
<p>but they play chess every single day.</p>
<p>And so many of them learn chess by themselves</p>
<p>and never had a professional coach.</p>
<p>So they are quite good at it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also very tight knit.</p>
<p>They all know each other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very social thing</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not just playing chess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the experience of getting to know this person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very much a personality and they talk to you.</p>
<p>They could either give you tips</p>
<p>or they could be really chatty and talk to you during.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a chess experience rather than just playing a game.</p>
<p>Do you tell them like what your rating is</p>
<p>or do you just let people, like both ways,</p>
<p>do you discover how good the person actually is?</p>
<p>Initially, I loved going and not telling people my rating</p>
<p>and just surprising them and winning games.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;ve gone so many times that they just know us.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t get away with it anymore.</p>
<p>One time, actually, I don&rsquo;t know if I should share this,</p>
<p>but one time we dressed up as grandmothers</p>
<p>and we had prosthetics on our face.</p>
<p>And I think they still recognized us.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s probably the, there&rsquo;s other components,</p>
<p>like probably the trash talk and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Actually, no, it was funny.</p>
<p>We were talking like grandmothers,</p>
<p>but it was the way I held, it was the way I held them.</p>
<p>Grandmother talk like, back of my day.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, we&rsquo;re not bringing this back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not bringing this back.</p>
<p>Okay, what were your names, what were the code names?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I think it was Edna, Edna, and I had a really,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the other one.</p>
<p>But it was embarrassing because we were walking so slowly</p>
<p>and Andrea dropped her cane or something at one point</p>
<p>and then people in the park came to help her.</p>
<p>We felt so embarrassed.</p>
<p>But yeah, it was funny.</p>
<p>Cause they didn&rsquo;t know it was us</p>
<p>until he saw the way I reached for my pawn.</p>
<p>And he said, the way you held your pawn, I knew it was you.</p>
<p>It was like such a niche thing.</p>
<p>That was what blew the grandma cover.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you have a style of how you play physically?</p>
<p>Is that recognizable?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think we did until grandma went to play chess, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve never thought about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think our style is just trash talking now.</p>
<p>Style is very, if you&rsquo;re talking about style</p>
<p>on YouTube and Twitch, we definitely have a distinctive style.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your distinctive, just talking shit?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But not going too far.</p>
<p>No, no, definitely that&rsquo;s, definitely going to.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s us two against each other.</p>
<p>Oh, we trash talk each other so hard.</p>
<p>So brutally.</p>
<p>And I love looking at Andrea</p>
<p>and watching her little nose scrunch up</p>
<p>as she&rsquo;s annoyed and the satisfaction</p>
<p>I get when that happens.</p>
<p>How many times do you play against each other</p>
<p>on online publicly?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of games.</p>
<p>We played a lot of times.</p>
<p>We try not to do it too often cause it&rsquo;s repetitive,</p>
<p>but every now and then when we haven&rsquo;t done it for a while,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go at it again.</p>
<p>What do you mean repetitive?</p>
<p>Is that implied trash talk right there?</p>
<p>No, it just, we play similar openings.</p>
<p>So you just start seeing the same position too often.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same opening against each other every time.</p>
<p>Andrea&rsquo;s really good at opening.</p>
<p>So I just start playing bad openings</p>
<p>to get her out of her preparation.</p>
<p>Cause I don&rsquo;t like opening theory very much.</p>
<p>I just like playing the game</p>
<p>and getting into middle games and end games.</p>
<p>But yeah, typically the only time we&rsquo;re playing each other</p>
<p>is when we&rsquo;re setting up in the park</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have opponents yet and we need content.</p>
<p>So we just play each other until people show up.</p>
<p>But we always put stakes on the line,</p>
<p>which makes it very interesting.</p>
<p>Cause otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t be fun to play each other</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no stakes.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the most fun place you&rsquo;ve played?</p>
<p>Is it New York?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And it was actually when we set up in Times Square one night,</p>
<p>we just brought a table with us and chess.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even where people usually play chess,</p>
<p>but it was so lively.</p>
<p>There were all of the lights out</p>
<p>and so many people just kept stopping by to play chess.</p>
<p>And it was really one of my favorite streams.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the opposite of like the classical chess world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super loud.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s music, there&rsquo;s cars,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s street dancers,</p>
<p>even some naked people walking around</p>
<p>who we had to be careful not to get banned.</p>
<p>But I honestly really liked the chaotic environments</p>
<p>for chess games.</p>
<p>Cause I think it&rsquo;s a good way</p>
<p>to break more into the mainstream culture</p>
<p>and make it entertaining and appealing</p>
<p>to anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know anything about chess.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way.</p>
<p>And also in an authentic way,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what we really like about chess</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re just enjoying the game,</p>
<p>but also the atmosphere</p>
<p>and the people who you&rsquo;re playing with.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things that I think you see less</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re just thinking of chess as a competitive thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned a few other games,</p>
<p>like the Bobby Fischer games,</p>
<p>the Candidates match,</p>
<p>the game of the century,</p>
<p>which I feel like is a weird game</p>
<p>to call the game of the century</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s still like a few decades left in the century.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t an official thing.</p>
<p>It was just the chess journalist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like made on a chess article.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s stuck if you look on.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it did stick.</p>
<p>Again, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>This is all I do research wise.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so that particular one was a 13 year old Fischer</p>
<p>and he did a queen sacrifice.</p>
<p>I wonder, there&rsquo;s that movie searching for Bobby Fischer.</p>
<p>Was that related?</p>
<p>Cause didn&rsquo;t they have a young somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s supposed to be kind of like Bobby Fischer</p>
<p>played by Josh Waitzkin.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he ended up being an international master.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t based on Bobby Fischer.</p>
<p>It was based on another player,</p>
<p>but I liked how they told it through the lens</p>
<p>of being inspired by Bobby Fischer.</p>
<p>Do you remember that game?</p>
<p>Like why do you think it was dubbed the game of the century?</p>
<p>It was just journalists being like.</p>
<p>I think part of it was the atmosphere</p>
<p>where you have the US junior champion</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s this 13 year old nobody.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the first time he&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>in a very competitive landscape</p>
<p>against some of the top American players.</p>
<p>And he goes up against an international master.</p>
<p>So somebody who&rsquo;s a lot stronger than he is</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s played in Olympiads for the American team.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s having a bad tournament,</p>
<p>but then he has this one game</p>
<p>where he just shows off his tactical prowess</p>
<p>and plays incredibly well.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if this is true,</p>
<p>but in the paper clippings of it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d say things like grandmasters were by the board</p>
<p>and they would say things like,</p>
<p>oh, Bobby is lost in this position.</p>
<p>What is he doing?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this 13 year old kid</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just playing incredibly well.</p>
<p>And then that also happened</p>
<p>before Bobby&rsquo;s started really rapidly improving at chess.</p>
<p>Not that people knew that,</p>
<p>but he kind of seemed like a rising star.</p>
<p>So I think the game was beautiful,</p>
<p>but I also think the idea of a 13 year old kid</p>
<p>coming out from nowhere</p>
<p>and beating a top American player was very fascinating.</p>
<p>And there was aggressive chess</p>
<p>and it was interesting ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, taking big risks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool to see a 13 year old do that.</p>
<p>What about the,</p>
<p>you mentioned that his match against Mark Taimano</p>
<p>from their 71 candidates match</p>
<p>was interesting in some way.</p>
<p>Why is it interesting to you?</p>
<p>Move 45, I&rsquo;m looking at some notes.</p>
<p>This is with the Bishop E3.</p>
<p>I think I know which one you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I wouldn&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>a lot of these games on these lists</p>
<p>I think are really great combinations</p>
<p>that when tactics come into play,</p>
<p>which is what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re very good at exemplifying lessons.</p>
<p>This is why you study famous games.</p>
<p>So you can apply these lessons to your own games.</p>
<p>And I think the main takeaway for this one</p>
<p>was they&rsquo;re punishing their opponent</p>
<p>from steering away from opening principles,</p>
<p>which is something that we learned a little earlier</p>
<p>where he delayed the development of his King</p>
<p>and put his Queen out a little bit too exposed.</p>
<p>So Bobby Fisher immediately punished that.</p>
<p>And then there was just like a beautiful combination</p>
<p>where it was like a 12 in a row perfect moves,</p>
<p>which was a tactic, just winning the game.</p>
<p>But it only came from punishing those mistakes.</p>
<p>The mistake being bringing the Queen out?</p>
<p>Bringing the Queen out</p>
<p>and yeah, not castling your King right away.</p>
<p>And these were just like opening principles</p>
<p>that now they&rsquo;re written in books,</p>
<p>but for books you would study these principles</p>
<p>by studying games.</p>
<p>And also, I&rsquo;m looking at some notes,</p>
<p>his dominance during the candidate&rsquo;s turn</p>
<p>was unprecedented.</p>
<p>He swept two top grandmasters.</p>
<p>I mean, that guy&rsquo;s meteoric rise is incredible.</p>
<p>Sad that I think at whatever in his 20s,</p>
<p>he then quit chess.</p>
<p>One has to wonder where he could have gone.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is sad that we lost such a brilliant mind</p>
<p>so early on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also sad, I think kind of what ended up happening</p>
<p>in his life and the slowly going crazier.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of chess</p>
<p>that opens the door to crazy?</p>
<p>Like how challenging it is on you,</p>
<p>the stress, the anxiety of it, the isolation.</p>
<p>And being alone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very lonely sport.</p>
<p>It is, even do you guys, since you both play it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still lonely, the experience of it?</p>
<p>It was when I was competing a lot.</p>
<p>I think the crazy part of it for me</p>
<p>was how obsessed you can get about a board game</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re optimizing your entire life</p>
<p>to beat another person at pushing wooden pieces</p>
<p>across the board.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to other things.</p>
<p>And the fact that so many people spend so much</p>
<p>of their life on it,</p>
<p>but you can also spend so much of your life</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so deep and so interesting.</p>
<p>And I mean, I&rsquo;ve definitely experienced moments</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything but chess.</p>
<p>And I had that before I went to college</p>
<p>where I just wanted to take a gap year and focus on chess</p>
<p>because I went to high school, we moved a lot,</p>
<p>there was always other things going on.</p>
<p>So I felt like I could never really focus on chess.</p>
<p>And the one time I could, by taking a gap year,</p>
<p>I ended up not doing because my parents really wanted me</p>
<p>to go to university right away.</p>
<p>But I think maybe if I had taken that gap year,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would have gone back to school.</p>
<p>So maybe it wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also say that&rsquo;s pretty universal.</p>
<p>I think if you want to be the best at anything you do</p>
<p>or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s only chess.</p>
<p>Well, some things, some obsessions are more transferable</p>
<p>to a balanced social life.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>Like healthy development.</p>
<p>Yeah, chess is a lot less social than most other sports.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something deeply isolating about this game.</p>
<p>I mean, the great chess players I&rsquo;ve met,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really competitive too.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;re almost nonstop paranoid</p>
<p>about blundering at every level.</p>
<p>And that develops a person who is really anxious</p>
<p>about losing versus someone who deeply enjoys perfection</p>
<p>or winning and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this constant paranoia about losing.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m misinterpreting it, but that creates huge amount</p>
<p>of stress over like thousands of games,</p>
<p>especially in a young person.</p>
<p>And that blundering is such a painful experience</p>
<p>because you could be playing a game that you&rsquo;ve played</p>
<p>for five, six hours and you have one lapse in focus</p>
<p>and you blunder and you throw the entire game away.</p>
<p>And sometimes not just the entire game,</p>
<p>but the entire tournament.</p>
<p>Now you can&rsquo;t place or do anything anymore.</p>
<p>So you just feel those mistakes so strongly.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no one to blame but yourself.</p>
<p>Are you guys hard on yourself?</p>
<p>Have you been about losing?</p>
<p>Like before you became super famous for streaming</p>
<p>where you could be like, well, fuck this,</p>
<p>at least I can have fun playing.</p>
<p>So I was really hard on myself and I went to play</p>
<p>a tournament in Canada to try to qualify</p>
<p>for the Olympiad team.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, I&rsquo;m an adult now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna feel emotional if I lose.</p>
<p>And then I got there on the first day.</p>
<p>I think I was ranked like fourth in Canada for females.</p>
<p>How long ago was this?</p>
<p>This was like earlier in the year actually.</p>
<p>And I go and I lose to somebody lower rated</p>
<p>on the first day.</p>
<p>And I think it was because I blundered</p>
<p>and I went back to my room and I was like,</p>
<p>I am not an adult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not eating, I&rsquo;m not leaving this room.</p>
<p>I feel terrible and I know I shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but it just cuts so deep.</p>
<p>And then I actually ended up qualifying</p>
<p>for the Olympiad team, but I didn&rsquo;t wanna play</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to train</p>
<p>and the losses are so painful that I was like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>Yeah, in high school and growing up,</p>
<p>I just remember weekends.</p>
<p>And I think being competitive in any sport,</p>
<p>again, probably people relate to this,</p>
<p>which is like spending weekends crying.</p>
<p>And even like Alex said, like punishing yourself</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re disappointed in yourself</p>
<p>because you fight so hard and you prepare</p>
<p>and you study and you&rsquo;re like, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s once again on the bright side though,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re studying so hard and after like a four hour game</p>
<p>and you actually are on the opposite end and you win,</p>
<p>you feel like such a huge rush of dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like on a high from the wind.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also plus sides or you can turn this around.</p>
<p>But yeah, like Alex said, like losing</p>
<p>after preparing for something and fighting on hours</p>
<p>and hours is the worst feeling in the world.</p>
<p>Did you ever get anything like that with martial arts?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, you know, wrestling,</p>
<p>I wrestled all through high school and middle school.</p>
<p>Definitely, so it&rsquo;s an individual sport.</p>
<p>I did a lot of individual sport, tennis,</p>
<p>those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I think even with wrestling and tennis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still on a team.</p>
<p>You can still like, there&rsquo;s still a comradery there.</p>
<p>I feel like with chess, especially you go on your own</p>
<p>with the tournaments, like you really are alone.</p>
<p>But I mean, I always personally just had</p>
<p>like a very self critical mind in general.</p>
<p>I would not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I decided not to play chess</p>
<p>because I think when I was really young,</p>
<p>I met somebody who was able to play blindfold chess.</p>
<p>They were teaching me, they were laying in there</p>
<p>on the couch, trashed, drinking and smoking.</p>
<p>And there were.</p>
<p>Sounds like a Russian.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>There are now a faculty somewhere in the United States.</p>
<p>I forget where.</p>
<p>But he making jokes, talking to others</p>
<p>and he would move the pieces, like he would yell</p>
<p>across the room.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking that if a person is able to do that,</p>
<p>then that kind of world you can live in inside your mind</p>
<p>that becomes the chessboard.</p>
<p>To me, that meant like the chessboard is not just out here.</p>
<p>It could be in here and you could do these beautiful,</p>
<p>you can create these beautiful patterns in your mind.</p>
<p>I thought like, I had such a strong pull towards that</p>
<p>where I had to decide either I&rsquo;m gonna dedicate everything</p>
<p>to this or not.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do half assed.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when I decided to walk away from it</p>
<p>because I had so much other beautiful things in my life.</p>
<p>I loved mathematics.</p>
<p>I loved, just everything was beautiful to me.</p>
<p>I thought chess would pull me all in.</p>
<p>And there was nothing like it, I think,</p>
<p>in my whole life since then.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s such a dangerous addiction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a beautiful addiction, but it&rsquo;s a dangerous one,</p>
<p>depending on what your mind is like.</p>
<p>It reminds me of something I thought of</p>
<p>before I stopped competing as much.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d look at people and think,</p>
<p>imagine being so intelligent that you could become</p>
<p>a grandmaster and yet only spending the rest of your life</p>
<p>being a grandmaster.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s one of those things where it does require</p>
<p>a lot of mental power, but by doing chess,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to explore other subjects deeply.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And not in a way that is bad necessarily,</p>
<p>more an admiration and wondering what else could have been</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve just seen people get to these levels</p>
<p>of obsession where it&rsquo;s all they wanna do.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re grandmasters, but they&rsquo;re not even top players.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re never gonna make a living out of it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll make like maybe 30, 40K a year max.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even focus on their competitive chess</p>
<p>because they have to supplement it by teaching</p>
<p>and doing things they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just because of how strong of an obsession</p>
<p>it can be because it truly is very intellectually rewarding.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what people are addicted to</p>
<p>in the self improvement, but you can get that</p>
<p>from a lot of other things as well.</p>
<p>Well, I think for me, what I was inspired by</p>
<p>that stuck with me is that a human being</p>
<p>could be so good at one thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>To me, that person on the couch drinking and so on,</p>
<p>I assumed he was the best chess player in the world.</p>
<p>Like to be able to play inside your head,</p>
<p>it just felt like a feat that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And so I fell in love with the idea</p>
<p>that I hope to be something like that</p>
<p>in my life at something.</p>
<p>It would be pretty cool to be really good at one thing.</p>
<p>And like life in some sense is a search for the things</p>
<p>that you could be that good at.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even think about like how much money</p>
<p>does it make or any of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s can I fall in love with something</p>
<p>and make it a life pursuit where I can be damn good at it.</p>
<p>And being damn good at it is the source of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Not like not to win because you want to win a tournament</p>
<p>or win because like you just want to be better</p>
<p>at somebody else.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s for the beauty of the game itself</p>
<p>or the beauty of the activity itself.</p>
<p>And then you realize that that&rsquo;s one of the compelling</p>
<p>things about chess.</p>
<p>It is a game with rules and you can win.</p>
<p>If you want to be really damn good in some aspect</p>
<p>of life like that, it&rsquo;s a harder and weirder pursuit.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you feel like you kind of did that</p>
<p>with computer science or AI related things?</p>
<p>Like getting that level of damn good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the cool things about AI and robotics</p>
<p>or intellectual pursuits or scientific pursuits</p>
<p>is you can spend until you&rsquo;re 80 doing it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in the early days of that.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I came to Texas,</p>
<p>one of the reasons I didn&rsquo;t want to pursue</p>
<p>an academic career at MIT is I want to build a company.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m in the early days of that AI company.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s an open world to see if I&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>going to be good at it.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s there that I&rsquo;ve been cognizant</p>
<p>of my whole life is that I have a passion for it.</p>
<p>Something within me draws me to that thing.</p>
<p>And you have to listen to that, to that voice.</p>
<p>So with chess, you&rsquo;re fucked unless you like early on</p>
<p>are really training really hard.</p>
<p>I think life is more forgiving.</p>
<p>You can be world class at a thing</p>
<p>after making a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>And after spending the first few decades of your life</p>
<p>doing something completely different.</p>
<p>And chess, it&rsquo;s like an Olympic sport.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no, perfection is a requirement,</p>
<p>is a necessity.</p>
<p>What do you think is that pursuit for you?</p>
<p>Like why did you decide to stream?</p>
<p>What drew you?</p>
<p>I like these questions.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re really getting deep.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is like a therapy session.</p>
<p>I mean, isn&rsquo;t it terrifying to be in front of a camera?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s terrifying to be in front of five cameras.</p>
<p>The set up is.</p>
<p>Corrections, six.</p>
<p>Six, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more terrifying for me to try to remember</p>
<p>if I actually turned them all.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned to you off mic,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still suffering from a bit of PTSD</p>
<p>after screwing up a recording of Magnus.</p>
<p>He had to console me because that was the thing.</p>
<p>I felt, okay, you wanna build robots.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get a camera to even run correctly,</p>
<p>how are you gonna do anything else in life?</p>
<p>Oh no, don&rsquo;t let it spiral like that.</p>
<p>It was spiraling hard and I was just laying there</p>
<p>and just feeling sorry for myself.</p>
<p>But I think that feeling, by the way,</p>
<p>and the small tangent, is really useful.</p>
<p>I feel like a lot of growing happens when you feel shitty.</p>
<p>As long as you can get out of it.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t let it spiral indefinitely.</p>
<p>But just feeling really, really shitty</p>
<p>about everything in my life.</p>
<p>Like I was having an existential crisis.</p>
<p>Like how will I be able to do anything at all?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re a giant failure,</p>
<p>all those kinds of negative voices.</p>
<p>But I think I made some good decisions</p>
<p>in the week after that.</p>
<p>Of like, okay.</p>
<p>Do you think you couldn&rsquo;t have made those decisions</p>
<p>if you were less hard on yourself?</p>
<p>Me personally, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too lazy.</p>
<p>Okay, so you really need to be angry at yourself enough</p>
<p>to go and do what you need.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not even angry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just upset of being self critical.</p>
<p>Like also for me personally,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have proclivities for depression,</p>
<p>I have a lot more room</p>
<p>to feel extremely shitty about myself.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that can get stuck in that place,</p>
<p>like clinically depressed,</p>
<p>you have to be really, really careful.</p>
<p>You have to notice the triggers,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna get into that place.</p>
<p>But for me, just looking empirically,</p>
<p>feeling shitty has always been productive.</p>
<p>Like it makes me long term happier.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it makes me more grateful to be alive</p>
<p>and it helps me grow, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So I kinda embrace it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I feel like I will never do anything.</p>
<p>I have to feel shitty,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not a thing I prescribe to others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous professor at MIT,</p>
<p>his name is Marvin Minsky.</p>
<p>And when he was giving advice about like to the students,</p>
<p>he said, the secret to my success</p>
<p>was that I always hated everything I did in the past.</p>
<p>So always sort of being self critical</p>
<p>about everything you&rsquo;ve accomplished,</p>
<p>never really take a moment of gratitude.</p>
<p>And I think for a lot of people that hear that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>You should like take a pause and be grateful,</p>
<p>but it really worked for him.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a choice you have to make.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the quote, be happy but never satisfied,</p>
<p>where you can have a positive spin</p>
<p>and still want to improve yourself.</p>
<p>But yeah, like when did you decide</p>
<p>to take a step in the spotlight,</p>
<p>that terrifying spotlight of the internet?</p>
<p>It was actually my senior year of college</p>
<p>and I was really busy with work and school</p>
<p>and chess was kind of like this lost love.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is that</p>
<p>the longer I don&rsquo;t play chess,</p>
<p>the more I kind of miss playing it casually</p>
<p>and enjoy it more.</p>
<p>Cause then I start looking at it with fresh eyes,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have time to play tournaments.</p>
<p>So I started streaming online because it was more social</p>
<p>than just playing strangers on the internet</p>
<p>without knowing anything about who they are.</p>
<p>And I started slowly growing a community</p>
<p>and got in touch with chess.com pretty quickly too.</p>
<p>So then it was this hobby that I would do once a week,</p>
<p>every Thursday at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>And it was one of the things that brought me a lot of joy.</p>
<p>And actually I, speaking of depression,</p>
<p>did struggle for it with at least 10 years of my life.</p>
<p>And it was one of those things where chess and streaming</p>
<p>was such a distraction and it brought me such great joy</p>
<p>that I just kept doing it cause I really, really liked it.</p>
<p>And then I was working on something that didn&rsquo;t pan out</p>
<p>and decided to go and take a risk and just stream full time,</p>
<p>which, you know, seemed a little bit weird at the moment.</p>
<p>Was that terrifying, that leap?</p>
<p>It was terrifying,</p>
<p>but I had taken so many terrifying leaps in the past</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t, you know, the last two hadn&rsquo;t worked out,</p>
<p>but I was like, well, I&rsquo;ll get it eventually.</p>
<p>So somehow having failed before and going through failure</p>
<p>and knowing that it&rsquo;ll be okay,</p>
<p>made me more likely to just try something</p>
<p>that was a very, very weird job.</p>
<p>Goodbye camera.</p>
<p>I saw it die.</p>
<p>Yeah, the camera, we don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>But one of the cameras died.</p>
<p>Luckily we have another five.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Like this is where this triggers the spiral,</p>
<p>Alexis is gonna go to A to death now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still somehow awake.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give about the dark places</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gone in your mind, the depression you suffered from,</p>
<p>how to get out from your own story?</p>
<p>Whenever I go to those really dark places,</p>
<p>the scariest thing is that it feels like</p>
<p>I will never get rid of this feeling</p>
<p>and it is very overwhelming.</p>
<p>And I just have to kind of look back over time spans</p>
<p>and remember that every single time I have got through it</p>
<p>and remind myself that it is just temporary.</p>
<p>And that has been the most helpful thing for me</p>
<p>because I just try to combat the scariest thing about it.</p>
<p>And then believe, have faith that it&rsquo;s gonna,</p>
<p>like this will go away.</p>
<p>And take action obviously to make sure it goes away.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve also tried to spin it as depression</p>
<p>is one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve had to deal with,</p>
<p>but also one of the biggest motivators</p>
<p>because if I just am left with my own brain,</p>
<p>I get very depressed.</p>
<p>Then I really like working or focusing on things.</p>
<p>So it actually pushed me to try to focus on school,</p>
<p>try to focus on chess, focus on whatever I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And also if I&rsquo;m feeling really bad,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s probably something a little bit off</p>
<p>and I use it as a signal and try to think of it as,</p>
<p>okay, this is just a sign that there&rsquo;s things</p>
<p>that could be improved for long term.</p>
<p>What about you, Andrea?</p>
<p>Have you gone to dark places in your mind?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say my family, like I see Alex going through this,</p>
<p>my mom also has very serious depression.</p>
<p>Luckily, I got the genes where I don&rsquo;t go through</p>
<p>that serious level of depression that they do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say mine is much more temporarily.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more similar to what I was feeling</p>
<p>when I was feeling shitty about it.</p>
<p>Exactly, you go through periods, yes, exactly,</p>
<p>where like, but I know that it&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s clinical and that&rsquo;s just a genetic thing</p>
<p>or a mental thing, whereas I know it&rsquo;s more serious</p>
<p>for like my family members.</p>
<p>And I did relate a lot with you where you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>where that really pushes you and I felt that a lot</p>
<p>through content where you just kind of feel hopeless</p>
<p>and kind of like an existential crisis</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t like the content I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what pushes me to like, okay,</p>
<p>you have no choice but to try something</p>
<p>that now you&rsquo;re gonna be passionate about</p>
<p>because otherwise you&rsquo;re gonna be stuck</p>
<p>in this never ending cycle.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s short term and then it helps me come up</p>
<p>with the things that I enjoy the most content wise</p>
<p>and it also long term taught me just how to have</p>
<p>a more balanced life, like doing small things</p>
<p>that make me happier on a daily basis,</p>
<p>to like working out, to eating healthier,</p>
<p>which I notice when I don&rsquo;t do for weeks,</p>
<p>I just get a lot more depressed.</p>
<p>What has playing chess taught you about life?</p>
<p>Has it made you better at life in any kind of way</p>
<p>or has it made you worse?</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people kind of romanticize the idea</p>
<p>that chess is kind of like life or life is kind of like chess</p>
<p>and becoming better at making decisions on the chess board</p>
<p>is gonna make you better at making decisions in life.</p>
<p>Is there some truth to that?</p>
<p>I always shy away from these comparisons</p>
<p>with chess and life.</p>
<p>Cause yeah, it has both positives and negatives.</p>
<p>So one thing it really helps develop from an early age</p>
<p>is having an analytical mind,</p>
<p>but then you could also get like paralysis of analysis</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve just thought of everything to death</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re moving too slowly</p>
<p>when you just have to keep going forward</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s not a great path ahead.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more like exercising your brain and staying sharp</p>
<p>and then also applying that to other things.</p>
<p>Whereas if instead of playing chess,</p>
<p>you were watching TV or something like that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably end up being less sharp.</p>
<p>Yeah, I used to, in high school,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always preach like,</p>
<p>ah, chess transfers to life skills that I would teach.</p>
<p>I taught chess for juvenile department</p>
<p>for a special education school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d cite studies in prisons where like,</p>
<p>oh, playing chess helped them with X</p>
<p>and for your kids, it helps with teamwork</p>
<p>and thinking over life choices.</p>
<p>And now that I&rsquo;m older, I don&rsquo;t believe in any of that BS.</p>
<p>But I do think that the process of working really hard</p>
<p>at something which takes really long to see results</p>
<p>and you have to be really dedicated.</p>
<p>And like, I remember in high school and in middle school,</p>
<p>well, all my friends, they were having fun on the weekends</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d have to be there studying as a chess a day</p>
<p>and knowing one day I&rsquo;ll pay off,</p>
<p>but for like two, three years, nothing paid off.</p>
<p>Kind of learning that type of patience with anything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, you know, like getting a real job.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I ever really worked a real job in my life</p>
<p>since I went straight into streaming</p>
<p>and I got to work for myself,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s what people go to college for.</p>
<p>Like they learn how to live in the real world</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d say that that&rsquo;s what chess taught me as a kid.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re streaming,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing the creative work, do you feel lonely?</p>
<p>So a bunch of creators talk about sort of the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s counterintuitive because you&rsquo;re famous now, you know.</p>
<p>Sort of, not quite, but we&rsquo;re very lucky</p>
<p>to have each other.</p>
<p>So is that the source of the comfort</p>
<p>and like, is there some sense where it&rsquo;s isolating</p>
<p>to have these personalities,</p>
<p>they have to always be having fun, being wild and so on?</p>
<p>Or is it actually the opposite?</p>
<p>Like, is it a source of comfort</p>
<p>to know that there&rsquo;s so many cool people out there</p>
<p>that are giving you their love?</p>
<p>It started as a source of comfort</p>
<p>because it started with a very small community</p>
<p>who would be something,</p>
<p>it would be around 200 to 300 viewers</p>
<p>and you know, only like 30 to 40 of them</p>
<p>would actually chat actively.</p>
<p>So you felt like it was a community, not an audience.</p>
<p>So you like knew them personally almost.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And it was people who were interested in chess</p>
<p>and I would really enjoy that.</p>
<p>And then as, you know, we started growing bigger,</p>
<p>the audience kind of changed</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re not there for you personally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there while you&rsquo;re entertaining</p>
<p>and it changed for me.</p>
<p>And I ended up being a lot more self conscious</p>
<p>of things online and started even thinking of myself</p>
<p>more like a product than a human being when I&rsquo;m online</p>
<p>because I had to.</p>
<p>Brand.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Otherwise you just start taking everything personally</p>
<p>that people comment about you</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s based off a very small clip.</p>
<p>I see, so it was almost a kind of a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And it took time to get enough,</p>
<p>because even if you have tough skin,</p>
<p>eventually it gets to you when you&rsquo;re online</p>
<p>every single day listening to, you know,</p>
<p>thousands of people&rsquo;s feedback on you.</p>
<p>I think the loneliest part of being creator</p>
<p>is going through burnout,</p>
<p>which everyone is just, it&rsquo;s bound to happen,</p>
<p>which is why I think we&rsquo;re very lucky</p>
<p>that we have each other because right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a numbers game and you&rsquo;re viral and trendy</p>
<p>at one point and then you have to fall.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s months where you&rsquo;re just grinding.</p>
<p>And I just come into my friends room and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>Andrea, we&rsquo;re irrelevant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m glad, that&rsquo;s really like the worst part</p>
<p>of being creator and figuring out how to get over that hump.</p>
<p>But it makes me very grateful that I have my sister</p>
<p>because I know that I&rsquo;m not the only person going through it.</p>
<p>And yeah, I know that most of my creator friends</p>
<p>feel very lonely in that process</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have someone who&rsquo;s their family</p>
<p>and their business partner and they&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>by each other side by side.</p>
<p>You kind of tie in your self worth to your job</p>
<p>and your content and maybe even more extremely</p>
<p>than other jobs because you also are the entire company</p>
<p>and the entire product.</p>
<p>So when things are going well or when things are not,</p>
<p>you just need to be careful to not reflect it like,</p>
<p>oh, I am doing bad.</p>
<p>I am bad rather than the trends have now changed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s outside things we&rsquo;re gonna keep going</p>
<p>and this is just the normal waves,</p>
<p>which is how we think about it now.</p>
<p>And also just about, are we enjoying this?</p>
<p>Is this what we wanna make?</p>
<p>But we were stuck in the camp for a while</p>
<p>when we 10Xed our viewership after the pandemic</p>
<p>because people were home and playing chess.</p>
<p>And then of course that dropped by like 70%.</p>
<p>And then you see that and you&rsquo;re trying your best</p>
<p>and you just kind of have to deal with it and be like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m just gonna keep persevering</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;ll get better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a struggle of sorts in the 21st century</p>
<p>of like how to be an artist, how to be a creator,</p>
<p>how to be an interesting mind in response to this algorithm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, turning off views and likes is really good.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at Twitch views for that reason.</p>
<p>And I get obsessed with the numbers too.</p>
<p>And I know Andrea does, but for me,</p>
<p>what I try now is to be more focused in the moment,</p>
<p>but Andrea somehow can do it even with the views.</p>
<p>So you just, you get, you have fun with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too much of like a given to the temporary satisfaction.</p>
<p>Like I like seeing, I like knowing</p>
<p>that if something happens right now,</p>
<p>viewership&rsquo;s gonna boost by a couple of hundred</p>
<p>and seeing that I&rsquo;m right, of course.</p>
<p>But what about when the viewers start dropping?</p>
<p>Exactly, well, and I always,</p>
<p>like you just have this intuition now.</p>
<p>But I think also the reason that it doesn&rsquo;t affect me</p>
<p>so much is when we first started our content journey,</p>
<p>we were only Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>And we, our livelihood were based on Twitch viewers.</p>
<p>But now like I&rsquo;ve learned how to recycle that content</p>
<p>into like YouTube and shorts and other things</p>
<p>where I know like, okay, if this stream does badly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many more things you can do</p>
<p>that also just have a much larger output.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t get to me as much as it did.</p>
<p>Do you ever feel that with your podcasts</p>
<p>or do you feel like it&rsquo;s been authentic since the start?</p>
<p>No, so there&rsquo;s a million things to say there.</p>
<p>So one is there&rsquo;s a reason I stopped taking a salary at MIT</p>
<p>and moved to Texas is I wanted my bank account to go to zero</p>
<p>because I do my best with my back against the wall.</p>
<p>So one of the comforts I have is I don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if this podcast is popular or not.</p>
<p>I want it to not be popular.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want it to make money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re failing Lex.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanna, I mean, I just do best</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m more desperate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like one thing to say.</p>
<p>Seems like a reoccurring theme</p>
<p>with how you build up your greatest work,</p>
<p>which is honestly very respectable.</p>
<p>Yeah, so thank you.</p>
<p>This is like.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend.</p>
<p>Right, thank you for finding the silver lining</p>
<p>for an unhealthy mental state.</p>
<p>But the other thing is I was very conscious</p>
<p>just like with chess and those kinds of things</p>
<p>that I love numbers.</p>
<p>And I would be, if I paid attention,</p>
<p>if I tried to be somebody at their best,</p>
<p>like Mr. Beast who really pays attention to numbers,</p>
<p>I would just not, I&rsquo;d become destroyed by it.</p>
<p>The highs and the lows of it.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t think I would be creating</p>
<p>the best work possible.</p>
<p>But one of the big benefits of a podcast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s listeners and there&rsquo;s an intimacy with the voice.</p>
<p>And I think that is much more stable</p>
<p>and a deeper and a more meaningful connection than YouTube.</p>
<p>YouTube is a fickle mistress.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a weird drug that like, it really wants you.</p>
<p>With very addicting feedback loops.</p>
<p>When you have a video that&rsquo;s number one out of 10,</p>
<p>oh my God, the adrenaline you get.</p>
<p>And then the thing I really don&rsquo;t like also</p>
<p>is the world will introduce you as a person</p>
<p>that has a video on YouTube with some X number of views.</p>
<p>Like the world wants you to be addicted to these numbers.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Because they associate it with having done a good job.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what people think views are,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And primarily because they don&rsquo;t have any other signal</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s a good job.</p>
<p>I think the much better signal is people</p>
<p>that are close to you, your family, your colleagues,</p>
<p>that say, wow, that was cool, I listened to that,</p>
<p>that was really, I didn&rsquo;t know this,</p>
<p>this was really powerful, this is really moving and so on.</p>
<p>But definitely I&rsquo;m terrified of numbers.</p>
<p>Because I feel like, just like I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather be a Stanley Kubrick, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d rather create great art,</p>
<p>not to be pretentious,</p>
<p>but the best possible thing you can create.</p>
<p>Whatever the beauty that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the capacity for creating beauty that&rsquo;s in you,</p>
<p>I would like to maximize that.</p>
<p>And I feel like for some people like Mr. Beast,</p>
<p>I think those are perfectly aligned.</p>
<p>Because he just loves the most epic thing possible,</p>
<p>but not for everybody.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>for whom that&rsquo;s not perfectly aligned.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m definitely one of those.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still really confused</p>
<p>why anybody listens to this anyway.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s also something I guess you&rsquo;re trying to find,</p>
<p>trying to figure out.</p>
<p>I get very afraid of ever becoming someone</p>
<p>who just makes junk food content,</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t stop while you&rsquo;re in the moment,</p>
<p>and it has all of your attention,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t really bring any value to your life,</p>
<p>which is something that I think the algorithm</p>
<p>still does really reward.</p>
<p>And making sure that as we are learning</p>
<p>how to create better content,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still something that is gonna be meaningful long term.</p>
<p>Well, ultimately, you inspire a lot of young people.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are the best.</p>
<p>When I get messages from people who are like,</p>
<p>I played you a year ago, and my rating was 1400,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m 1900.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to challenge you again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 14 year old writing a former email.</p>
<p>Those things are always very, very fun to get.</p>
<p>And even just outside of chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just empowering to see,</p>
<p>like for young women too, to see that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I mean, you guys are being yourself,</p>
<p>and making money for being yourself,</p>
<p>and having fun, and growing as human beings,</p>
<p>which I think is really inspiring for people to see.</p>
<p>So in that sense, it&rsquo;s really rewarding.</p>
<p>And then the way I think about it is</p>
<p>there is some benefit of doing entertaining type of stuff</p>
<p>so that you get the,</p>
<p>kind of like Mr. Beast does with philanthropy, right?</p>
<p>The bigger Mr. Beast becomes,</p>
<p>the more effective he is at actually doing</p>
<p>positive impact on the world.</p>
<p>So those things are tied together.</p>
<p>But of course, with podcasts, you guys,</p>
<p>well, maybe you have these kinds of tense things,</p>
<p>but what kind of ideas, what kind of people do platform?</p>
<p>What kind of person,</p>
<p>what kind of human being do you wanna be?</p>
<p>Because you are actually becoming a person,</p>
<p>and a set of ideas in front of the public eye,</p>
<p>and you have to ask yourself that question really hard,</p>
<p>like really seriously.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re doing stuff in private,</p>
<p>you have the complete luxury to try shit out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think you have less of a luxury to try shit out</p>
<p>because the internet can be vicious in punishing you</p>
<p>for trying shit out.</p>
<p>And do you think that&rsquo;s sometimes a bad thing</p>
<p>where you have less freedom to make mistakes?</p>
<p>Yeah, you have two choices.</p>
<p>So one, you put up a wall</p>
<p>and say I don&rsquo;t give a shit what people think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like doing that</p>
<p>because I like being fragile to the world,</p>
<p>keeping my, sort of wearing my heart on my sleeve.</p>
<p>Or the other one, yeah, you have to be,</p>
<p>you have to actually think through what you&rsquo;re gonna say.</p>
<p>You have to think of like, what do I believe?</p>
<p>You have to be more serious about what you put out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying, but it&rsquo;s also actually,</p>
<p>you should have always been doing that.</p>
<p>You should be deliberate with your actions and your words.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but some of it, it&rsquo;s such a balance</p>
<p>because some of my favorite people are brilliant people</p>
<p>that allow themselves to act ridiculous and be silly.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, who&rsquo;s become a good friend,</p>
<p>is the silliest human of all.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s incredibly brilliant and productive and so on,</p>
<p>but allows themselves to be silly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also inspiring to people.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have to be perfect.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to, you can be a weird, a giant weird mess.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>I think when you start to delve into political topics,</p>
<p>into topics that really get tense for people,</p>
<p>then you have to be a little bit more careful and deliberate.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also wise to stay the hell away</p>
<p>from those topics in general.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned to you offline,</p>
<p>somebody I&rsquo;ve been debating whether I want to talk to</p>
<p>or not is Karjakin on the chess board</p>
<p>because chess is just a game,</p>
<p>but throughout the history of the 20th century,</p>
<p>it was played between the Russians and the Americans</p>
<p>and so on where they were at war, cold or hot war.</p>
<p>And those are interesting.</p>
<p>Those are interesting conversations to be had</p>
<p>at the Olympics and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a mini war.</p>
<p>And so I have to decide whether I want to talk to him or not</p>
<p>and those kinds of things.</p>
<p>You have to make those kinds of decisions.</p>
<p>For now, you guys are not playing chess</p>
<p>with Donald Trump or Obama or so on.</p>
<p>We are not right now, no.</p>
<p>How long is a stream?</p>
<p>Like a few hours, right?</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re two to three hours.</p>
<p>When I was first streaming,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d stream for like six hours a day.</p>
<p>A day.</p>
<p>At least usually.</p>
<p>Yeah, for like six to seven days a week.</p>
<p>Are you doing just like a talking one?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;d be playing chess the entire time while talking.</p>
<p>And when I started streaming,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of how everybody blows up on Twitch.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just putting in crazy hours and you&rsquo;re always there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about making the best content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about letting people feel</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re hanging out with you</p>
<p>and just being on as much as you can.</p>
<p>But I ended up feeling very burnt out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to be your best self</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in front of a camera for that long</p>
<p>because you do get scared of going into places</p>
<p>where you want to learn, but you might not be the best in.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s harder to learn in public</p>
<p>than do something that like,</p>
<p>yeah, we&rsquo;re better than 99% of our viewers at chess.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot less scary than trying to play a game</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re bad at or discuss topics</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>
<p>Yeah, have the beginner&rsquo;s mind and be dumb at something.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is where the fun is</p>
<p>and you get to learn together,</p>
<p>but people punish you for it on the internet.</p>
<p>What about you, Andrea?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think like Alex said at the beginning,</p>
<p>when we were grinding a lot,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really even have time for much of a private life</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re streaming every hour of your life</p>
<p>and people want it, like the appeal of streamers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called like being parasocial</p>
<p>where you feel like they&rsquo;re your friend</p>
<p>and they like it because they want you</p>
<p>to share everything about your life.</p>
<p>Really the main challenge for me at first</p>
<p>when trying to prioritize quantity over quality,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re not doing anymore,</p>
<p>was realizing that I can&rsquo;t turn everything I&rsquo;m interested in</p>
<p>and every passion into content.</p>
<p>Before I&rsquo;m like, well, I must stream more,</p>
<p>but I like music and I like playing piano</p>
<p>and I like reading into these topics and I like fitness</p>
<p>and then I try to live stream all of it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just, at some point it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>just enjoy your time off for those hobbies</p>
<p>and prioritize what you&rsquo;re good at</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just gonna be better for the channel overall.</p>
<p>So that was a learning lesson for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice because there are some intersections</p>
<p>when I have tried new things that I really enjoy</p>
<p>and it pays off, but that&rsquo;s less often.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more like you can be yourself,</p>
<p>but only specific parts of yourself online</p>
<p>and the rest, sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to just keep private</p>
<p>and feel that you could just give it your 100% freedom.</p>
<p>See, I feel like I try to be the exact same person</p>
<p>on podcasts as in private life.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like hiding anything.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re also a generalist, right?</p>
<p>Where you have people with all topics.</p>
<p>For us, we built our audience off a very specific thing</p>
<p>so people sometimes feel like,</p>
<p>even at the start when we started playing less chess,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, I subbed for chess.</p>
<p>Why are you not playing chess?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>People are tuning in for an interesting conversation</p>
<p>on a bunch of topics.</p>
<p>So like the more you are yourself, the better it is,</p>
<p>but it is very hard when you build your brand</p>
<p>on like one type of gaming content.</p>
<p>Build your brand.</p>
<p>But yeah, the way you become a generalist</p>
<p>is you slowly expand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like expand to checkers.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s like a downward.</p>
<p>Maybe poker.</p>
<p>Poker, yeah, exactly, poker.</p>
<p>But also just the ideas, the space of ideas.</p>
<p>And one of the cool things about chess</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re talking over the chess board,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s a kind of podcast, you know?</p>
<p>That is actually an idea we&rsquo;ve had with playing chess</p>
<p>while also doing a podcast and talking with people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like an icebreaker.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also focusing on the game at the same time.</p>
<p>But you know, we are slowly evolving</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing more things.</p>
<p>Like one thing we wanted to do is spend less time</p>
<p>in front of the computer.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re doing a chess travel show</p>
<p>where we go to different countries</p>
<p>and look at the chess culture.</p>
<p>So it actually feels like we&rsquo;re doing things</p>
<p>that we would want to do and explore anyway.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s not as much in the idea space,</p>
<p>which we both enjoy and do a lot in our own free time,</p>
<p>but in the sharing cool experiences with our audience</p>
<p>that we actually want to do.</p>
<p>Where do you look forward to going?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to Romania on September 9th.</p>
<p>And I think this is the most exciting for me</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re going back to, you know,</p>
<p>the country where our entire family&rsquo;s from,</p>
<p>where our grandmother taught our dad</p>
<p>who taught us how to play chess.</p>
<p>It has a very strong chess culture.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be very unique to go back and see</p>
<p>how everything is when we haven&rsquo;t been back</p>
<p>for a very long time.</p>
<p>And for Romanians, like it&rsquo;s very rare</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s like a famous Romanian</p>
<p>who accomplishes something,</p>
<p>which is why like right now,</p>
<p>Andrew Tate&rsquo;s the most famous Romanian.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s banned for a bad reason.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like something very special</p>
<p>about Romanian pride.</p>
<p>And when we meet fellow Romanians in the US,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just an amazing connection.</p>
<p>And like, I hear the way my dad talk about like,</p>
<p>for example, Nadia, who was a famous Romanian gymnast</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, yeah, like Romania,</p>
<p>we sucked at everything.</p>
<p>But when she won the Olympics for gymnast,</p>
<p>every kid on the street was doing gymnastics</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very rare that they make it</p>
<p>to that level of success.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that we&rsquo;re super successful,</p>
<p>super famous, but it is really cool</p>
<p>to meet other Romanians through chess</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very special bond.</p>
<p>Yeah, you feel like it&rsquo;s a community and like you belong.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can&rsquo;t get that anywhere else.</p>
<p>Let me ask your opinion since you mentioned him,</p>
<p>Andrew Tate, you&rsquo;re both women, successful women,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re both creators.</p>
<p>So Andrew Tate is an example of somebody</p>
<p>that has become exceptionally successful</p>
<p>at galvanizing public attention,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also, from many perspective, a misogynist.</p>
<p>So let me ask a personal question.</p>
<p>Do you think I should talk to him on this podcast?</p>
<p>How would you feel as a fan as somebody,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to the great Alex and Andrea Botez</p>
<p>and the next episode is with Andrew Tate?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a double edged sword</p>
<p>and most of these things are not as black and white</p>
<p>as they seem, you know,</p>
<p>because on one hand, I don&rsquo;t agree with his beliefs</p>
<p>and I think he said a lot of things that are very hurtful</p>
<p>and that influence people&rsquo;s opinions.</p>
<p>At the same time, talking to someone through that</p>
<p>and trying to get to the root of it</p>
<p>and how much of it he used just as a social media tactic</p>
<p>to maybe change the opinion of people</p>
<p>who have been so influenced by him towards</p>
<p>something that is maybe more understanding towards women</p>
<p>or things like that could do some good,</p>
<p>but at the same time, platforming someone like that</p>
<p>and giving them more attention also signals to other people</p>
<p>who have a platform that it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of weighing the pluses and the minuses</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very tough decision because it&rsquo;s not clear.</p>
<p>And the thing about the internet,</p>
<p>you make the wrong decision, you&rsquo;re gonna pay for it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, like personally,</p>
<p>and it is funny, like I think the whole way</p>
<p>you rose to fame is just a growth hack</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen other people do it</p>
<p>where like you just say kind of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, honestly, I don&rsquo;t really listen to his content</p>
<p>because I just find it so dumb,</p>
<p>but I think he knows that by saying the dumbest,</p>
<p>most controversial things, that&rsquo;s like a quick rise to fame</p>
<p>and I think surface level, like he can really hold it up,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why I would honestly enjoy tuning</p>
<p>into a conversation where you&rsquo;re really breaking down</p>
<p>to the core of those beliefs</p>
<p>and I think like young kids who look up to him</p>
<p>and when you actually hear someone challenging it</p>
<p>could actually be helpful for people,</p>
<p>but at the same time, it&rsquo;s a lot of bad publicity,</p>
<p>people see your podcast, they see, wow,</p>
<p>like if they don&rsquo;t know you</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re interviewing him</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t listen, they&rsquo;ll see that</p>
<p>and then 100% think it&rsquo;s for the other reason.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also afraid of a society</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t have discourse</p>
<p>with people you disagree with</p>
<p>and even though I don&rsquo;t like Andrew Tate,</p>
<p>I think the fact that he got banned from all the platforms</p>
<p>is kind of scary because it sets a precedent</p>
<p>and you always have to ask yourself,</p>
<p>would this be ethical if I was on the other side</p>
<p>and even things with a president like Trump,</p>
<p>even if let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re somebody who was on the left,</p>
<p>if that would have happened to a leftist president,</p>
<p>how would you feel?</p>
<p>Would you think that&rsquo;s morally ethical?</p>
<p>So that is something that I think is important.</p>
<p>We try to find ways to have conversations</p>
<p>and reach some mutual understanding</p>
<p>and try instead of just amplifying the worst</p>
<p>about every human being.</p>
<p>Well, so one of the major reasons I&rsquo;m struggling with</p>
<p>is because I really enjoy talking to brilliant women.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also, a lot of women reached out to me</p>
<p>saying like, it is what it is,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re inspired when the female guest is on.</p>
<p>And to me, if I talk to somebody like Andrew Tate,</p>
<p>even if I have a really hard hitting,</p>
<p>I think it could be a very good conversation</p>
<p>that lessens the likelihood</p>
<p>that a brilliant, powerful female will go on the show.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;ll never watch it,</p>
<p>but the thing we do in this society</p>
<p>is we put labels on each other.</p>
<p>Well, Lex is the person that platforms misogynists.</p>
<p>I did a thing where Joe Rogan got in trouble</p>
<p>over an N word controversy earlier in the year.</p>
<p>And Joe&rsquo;s a good friend of mine</p>
<p>and I said that I stand with Joe,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not a racist or something like that.</p>
<p>And within certain communities,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now somebody who&rsquo;s an apologist for racists, right?</p>
<p>Or a racist myself, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And we put labels without ever listening to the content,</p>
<p>without ever sort of,</p>
<p>actually just even the very simple step</p>
<p>or it seems to be difficult of like,</p>
<p>taking on the best possible interpretation</p>
<p>of what a person said</p>
<p>and giving them the benefit of the doubt</p>
<p>and having empathy for another person.</p>
<p>So you have to play in this field</p>
<p>where people will assign labels to each other</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>But ultimately, I believe,</p>
<p>I hope that good conversations is a way</p>
<p>to like a greater understanding for people</p>
<p>to grow together as a society</p>
<p>and improve and learn the lessons,</p>
<p>the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>But you also have to play this game</p>
<p>where people just like putting labels on each other</p>
<p>and canceling each other over those.</p>
<p>Or that guy said one thing nice about Donald Trump,</p>
<p>he must be a far right Nazi.</p>
<p>Or the opposite,</p>
<p>that this person said something nice about the vaccine,</p>
<p>he must be a far left whatever,</p>
<p>because apologist for whatever, for Fauci.</p>
<p>Or most of us I think are ultimately in the middle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird, it&rsquo;s a weird thing.</p>
<p>But I think, and it&rsquo;s also painful on a personal level.</p>
<p>Like people have written to me</p>
<p>about things like single words,</p>
<p>half sentences that I&rsquo;ve said about either Putin or Zelensky</p>
<p>where they have hate towards me because of what I said.</p>
<p>Either both directions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now accumulated very passionate people</p>
<p>that some call me a Putin apologist,</p>
<p>some call me a Zelensky apologist.</p>
<p>And it hurts to, given how much I have family there,</p>
<p>how much I&rsquo;ve seen of suffering there,</p>
<p>and to carry that burden over time</p>
<p>and not let it destroy you is tough.</p>
<p>So like, do you wanna take on another thing like that</p>
<p>when you have conversations?</p>
<p>Or can I just talk to awesome people like you two?</p>
<p>Where it&rsquo;s not that burden.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not controversial.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re interesting, you&rsquo;re fascinating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re inspiring, you&rsquo;re like fun.</p>
<p>Not all those difficult things that come with more difficult</p>
<p>conversations.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But somebody has to be making those difficult decisions</p>
<p>and challenging the notions that we should cancel someone</p>
<p>just for slightly disagreeing with us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard to take that on personally.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a huge part of it.</p>
<p>When you know it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>for the right reasons and you&rsquo;re getting a lot of people</p>
<p>coming and misinterpreting it, it&rsquo;s very painful.</p>
<p>But I think you have to ask yourself long term</p>
<p>if when you made that decision, you ultimately thought</p>
<p>it would be better or worse for your listeners</p>
<p>to know that conversation.</p>
<p>And then if you can sleep with it at night, take the risk.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually when I talk to people that,</p>
<p>especially astrophysicists, and you realize</p>
<p>how tiny we are.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How incredible, like how huge the universe is.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, you can do anything.</p>
<p>You could like, you can walk around naked,</p>
<p>talk shit to people, do whatever the hell.</p>
<p>And actually in modern social media,</p>
<p>people just like forget.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s ultimately liberating.</p>
<p>Just try to do, at least from my perspective,</p>
<p>the best possible thing for the world you can.</p>
<p>Take big risks, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the other thing with being canceled nowadays</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s attention is much more shortsighted.</p>
<p>You can get canceled and then it&rsquo;ll blow over in three days.</p>
<p>And you actually see things like this on Twitch very often</p>
<p>where people just have bursts of outrage</p>
<p>and they come into your chat and they&rsquo;re all spamming</p>
<p>and saying mean things, and then three days after.</p>
<p>And of course they&rsquo;re not actually ever serious things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually like things clipped of any streamers</p>
<p>in like their worst moments, but then people forget</p>
<p>about it pretty soon after.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to accept that?</p>
<p>Like when somebody is being shitty to you for a day?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I still get sometimes emotional about it,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m like, oh wow,</p>
<p>these things that are being said are not true</p>
<p>or like this was clearly taken out of context,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve just accepted that it&rsquo;s part of the job.</p>
<p>And if I am trying my best and I am trying things</p>
<p>with as good intentions as possible,</p>
<p>then I just try to learn every time that happens</p>
<p>and be like, okay, what could I do better?</p>
<p>And what is just part of the job?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s start some controversy.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the greatest chess player of all time?</p>
<p>Is it Magnus Carlsen, is it Gary Kasparov,</p>
<p>is it somebody else, Bobby Fischer?</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite, Alex?</p>
<p>So whenever I hear this question,</p>
<p>I interpret it in a very specific way</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not who was the most talented chess player</p>
<p>or who had the most impact on the chess world,</p>
<p>but who is the greatest at playing chess?</p>
<p>Where if you were putting all of these players</p>
<p>at their peak, who would be the best?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kind of living in a world</p>
<p>where obviously humans are becoming more like cyborgs</p>
<p>and their tools make them a lot more powerful.</p>
<p>And the computer is the most powerful tool</p>
<p>for chess that we&rsquo;ve ever witnessed.</p>
<p>And the top players now, someone like Magnus Carlsen</p>
<p>or Gary Kasparov, if they were gonna go towards people</p>
<p>like even Lasker or Bobby Fischer back in the day,</p>
<p>Lasker, he was world champion for 27 years,</p>
<p>he was the best in his field by far,</p>
<p>but would he be able to stand up to someone</p>
<p>like Magnus Carlsen who has had these tools?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>So most chess players have said Gary Kasparov</p>
<p>and I think even Magnus has said that in the past,</p>
<p>but I like to think of it as Magnus in his peak</p>
<p>and Gary at his peak, and because Magnus was able</p>
<p>to live more in a computer era,</p>
<p>I feel like so far he&rsquo;s the greatest of all time.</p>
<p>And some studies say things like</p>
<p>how there&rsquo;s rating inflation,</p>
<p>but I looked into some of them</p>
<p>and they basically calculated people&rsquo;s play</p>
<p>over the years and it seems</p>
<p>that there hasn&rsquo;t been inflation,</p>
<p>people are just getting better</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s because you have better tools at chess.</p>
<p>And also one of the cases, what&rsquo;s your?</p>
<p>I was gonna say, I actually, I disagree with that.</p>
<p>Good, make it interesting.</p>
<p>I think I would judge the greatest player of all time</p>
<p>in relative to the time that they lived in</p>
<p>and Magnus, although he is technically</p>
<p>the strongest chess player in history,</p>
<p>that is because he had computers to study chess with.</p>
<p>And of course, if you compare him to like Gary Kasparov,</p>
<p>he plays most like Stockfish,</p>
<p>but Gary Kasparov at his time,</p>
<p>he beat more players of his skill level than Magnus did.</p>
<p>Magnus loses more often.</p>
<p>He also of course held the belt for 20 years more.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say actually, because Gary lacked the help</p>
<p>of computers to study chess</p>
<p>and overall performed better against players</p>
<p>of his skill level, I think he would be number one.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean, the case that people make for Magnus</p>
<p>on many, I mean, what Alex said,</p>
<p>but also Magnus plays a lot and he doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>he plays a lot blitz, bullet and like he puts,</p>
<p>he gets drunk and like he&rsquo;s really putting himself out there</p>
<p>and in all kinds of conditions and he&rsquo;s able to dominate</p>
<p>and a lot of them, we get to see many of the like losses</p>
<p>or blunders and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>because he just puts himself out there.</p>
<p>And I think Kasparov was much more like.</p>
<p>Never saw him play drunk, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s very focused on the world championship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very limited number of games</p>
<p>and very focused on winning.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s some aspect to the versatility,</p>
<p>the aggressive play, the fun, all of that,</p>
<p>that I think you have to give credit to.</p>
<p>Oh, 100%.</p>
<p>In terms of just the scope,</p>
<p>the scale of the variety of genius exhibited by Magnus.</p>
<p>And he might not even be done yet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;ll ever hit 2,900,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t judge yet</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not at the peak of his career potentially.</p>
<p>What do you think about him not playing world championship?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that like, isn&rsquo;t that wild?</p>
<p>The entirety of the history of chess in the 20th century</p>
<p>going like meh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s walking away from this one tournament</p>
<p>that seems to be at the center of chess.</p>
<p>What do you think about that decision?</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t help but be disappointed as a chess fan</p>
<p>who wants to see the best player in the world</p>
<p>defend his title.</p>
<p>But I also understand it on a personal level</p>
<p>and not feeling as satisfied</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going to the world championship</p>
<p>and having to defend against people</p>
<p>who are less strong than you.</p>
<p>And also imagine winning world championships</p>
<p>and not feeling a joy out of that.</p>
<p>So maybe by not doing that</p>
<p>and focusing instead on a goal like 2,900,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll be more likely to accomplish it</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s focusing on what actually motivates him</p>
<p>to play chess.</p>
<p>But I do think that it will hurt</p>
<p>how we judge the next world champion.</p>
<p>I think it won&rsquo;t change him being the best player</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>And for someone to replace him,</p>
<p>even let&rsquo;s say like Nepo versus Sting,</p>
<p>even if one of them win and right on some stance,</p>
<p>it does lower the merit</p>
<p>because now who has the world chess championship title</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t actually the best player in the world.</p>
<p>And that has happened before in the past,</p>
<p>but still going to take the same effort to prove</p>
<p>when they would pass him like 10, 20 years</p>
<p>to become stronger than Magnus.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it changes the skill level</p>
<p>that it takes to become the best chess player in the world.</p>
<p>I think for chess fans, it&rsquo;s very disappointing,</p>
<p>but I think in the overall like grand scheme</p>
<p>of like the public view to people who don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>so like, you know, what breaks the popular culture</p>
<p>and you think of what names people know</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t play chess like Bobby Fischer did it.</p>
<p>Most people know Casper over Magnus.</p>
<p>It takes the same ability and talent and that doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>I think it does change though</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re playing a player who&rsquo;s not as strong,</p>
<p>but I see your point as well.</p>
<p>And I know we differ on this.</p>
<p>Like I said, I heard you ask Magnus,</p>
<p>but what is your take on it?</p>
<p>Well, listen, his answer is kind of brilliant,</p>
<p>which he&rsquo;s not saying he&rsquo;s bored</p>
<p>of the world championship.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bored of a process</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t determine the best player.</p>
<p>Like, and it&rsquo;s too exciting inducing to him</p>
<p>to have a small number of games.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t mind losing, which is really fascinating</p>
<p>to a better player or somebody who is his level.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s more anxious about losing to a weaker player</p>
<p>because of the small sample size.</p>
<p>Now, if like poker players had that anxiety,</p>
<p>they would never play at all, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the World Series of Poker.</p>
<p>You get to lose against weaker players all the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the throw of the dice.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an interesting perspective</p>
<p>that he would love to play 20, 30, 40 games</p>
<p>in the world championship,</p>
<p>and then he would enjoy it much more.</p>
<p>And also play shorter games</p>
<p>because they emphasize the like pure chess,</p>
<p>actually being able to like much more variety</p>
<p>in the middle game just to see a bunch of chaos</p>
<p>and see how you&rsquo;re able to compute,</p>
<p>calculate and intuition, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I wish the chess world would step up and meet him</p>
<p>in a place that makes sense,</p>
<p>change the world championship.</p>
<p>So FIDE changing it somehow, a loss for that.</p>
<p>Or having other really respected tournaments</p>
<p>that become like an annual thing that step up to that.</p>
<p>Or more kind of online YouTube type of competitions,</p>
<p>which I think they&rsquo;re trying to do more and more,</p>
<p>like the Crypto Cup and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And the Grand Tour does play in,</p>
<p>which takes a lot of the top players</p>
<p>and they do it online in shorter formats.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, so that&rsquo;s his perspective.</p>
<p>My perhaps narrow perspective</p>
<p>is I romanticize the Olympic games</p>
<p>and those are every four years</p>
<p>and the world championships because they&rsquo;re rare,</p>
<p>because the sample size is so small.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the magic happens.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s on the line for people</p>
<p>that spend their whole life, 20 years of dedication,</p>
<p>everything you have, every minute of the day</p>
<p>spent for that moment.</p>
<p>You think about like gymnastics at the Olympic games.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain sports where a single mistake</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>And that stress, that pressure, it can break people</p>
<p>or it can create magic.</p>
<p>Like a person that&rsquo;s the underdog</p>
<p>has the best night of their life</p>
<p>or the person that&rsquo;s been dominating for years</p>
<p>all of a sudden slips up.</p>
<p>That drama from a human perspective is beautiful.</p>
<p>So I still like the world championships,</p>
<p>but then again, looking at all the draws,</p>
<p>looking at like, well, the magic isn&rsquo;t quite there.</p>
<p>So to me, when I see faster games of chess,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more beautiful.</p>
<p>But then I don&rsquo;t understand the game of chess</p>
<p>deeply enough to know.</p>
<p>Like, does it have to be so many draws?</p>
<p>Like, is there a way to create a more dynamic chess?</p>
<p>And he talked about random chess</p>
<p>with a random starting position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>But then of course, that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>then you do have to play hundreds of games</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s great that the world number one</p>
<p>is struggling with these questions</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s in the position,</p>
<p>he has the leverage to actually change the game of chess</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s publicly seen, as it&rsquo;s publicly played.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still young enough to dominate</p>
<p>for quite a long time if he wants.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I, you know, with Kasparov, the fight between nations,</p>
<p>I hope they have the world championship</p>
<p>and I hope he&rsquo;s still a part of it somehow.</p>
<p>I hope he changes his mind.</p>
<p>And comes back.</p>
<p>Comes back.</p>
<p>Kind of dramatic thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But it is, his heart is not in it.</p>
<p>And then,</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s not beautiful to see, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is beautiful that the thing he wants</p>
<p>is a great game of chess against an opponent</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his level or better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great that he&rsquo;s coming from that place.</p>
<p>But I hope he comes back tomorrow.</p>
<p>Because the world championship is a special thing</p>
<p>in any sport.</p>
<p>So you do wish that the person</p>
<p>who wins the world championship</p>
<p>is the best player in the world?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I hope that the best people in the world,</p>
<p>the two best people in the world</p>
<p>are the ones that sit down.</p>
<p>But the person that wins is the person that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the magic of it.</p>
<p>Nobody knows who&rsquo;s going to win.</p>
<p>I think Magnus is so, he really wants</p>
<p>the best person to win.</p>
<p>Like the, that&rsquo;s why he wants the large sample size.</p>
<p>But to me there&rsquo;s some magic to it.</p>
<p>The stress of it, the drama of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all part of the game.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not just about the purity of the game,</p>
<p>like the calculation.</p>
<p>The pure chess of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also like the drama.</p>
<p>Like the, yeah, the pressure, the drama, all of it.</p>
<p>The shit talking, if it gets to you, the mind games.</p>
<p>This is the part that&rsquo;s fun to watch,</p>
<p>but less fun to be playing.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Who can melt, who can rise under that pressure</p>
<p>and who melts under that pressure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that look up to you,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re inspired by you</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve taken a kind of nonlinear path through life.</p>
<p>Is there any advice you have for people</p>
<p>like in high school today?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to figure out what they want to do.</p>
<p>Do they want to go to Stanford?</p>
<p>Do they want to pursue a career in, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>in industry or go kind of the path you guys have taken,</p>
<p>which is have the ability to do all of that</p>
<p>and still choose to make the thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re passionate about your life.</p>
<p>I always liked the calculated risks approach</p>
<p>where when you&rsquo;re younger, it&rsquo;s okay to take more risks</p>
<p>because you have a lot more time,</p>
<p>but there has to be a reason</p>
<p>why you&rsquo;re doing that particular risk.</p>
<p>Is it something that you&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time already</p>
<p>really passionate and working on</p>
<p>or is it just something that&rsquo;s trendy</p>
<p>and you want to do it because you don&rsquo;t have a better option?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually similar to what Andrea did</p>
<p>when she decided to go into streaming instead of school.</p>
<p>Yeah, the reason I got into streaming</p>
<p>because I was initially going to go to college,</p>
<p>but the pandemics,</p>
<p>it was right at the beginning of the pandemic</p>
<p>and all my classes were online.</p>
<p>And I never thought, ever since I was 12,</p>
<p>like my dream was school and I saw myself nowhere else</p>
<p>than going to university.</p>
<p>And I thought of it and kind of weighed out the risks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, if I take a gap year</p>
<p>and I try streaming with my sister, what do I have to lose?</p>
<p>I gained some experience working with someone</p>
<p>who has a lot more experience than I do.</p>
<p>And then I can go back to school after.</p>
<p>And if I go to school right now,</p>
<p>I do online classes for a year</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something that I could do at any time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why it made a lot of sense for me to go into this.</p>
<p>But of course, this is also a very unique opportunity.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how applicable,</p>
<p>but I do think overall the calculated risk</p>
<p>is a really good lesson.</p>
<p>So life is like chess.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Maybe sometime.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You also, have you considered a career</p>
<p>in professional fighting?</p>
<p>I saw you did a self defense class,</p>
<p>you did a little Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>Did you see the 10 year old kid who&hellip;</p>
<p>Throwing her?</p>
<p>Yes, and apparently I could have broken a leg.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s actually funny, like chess boxing is a thing</p>
<p>and I have been doing a lot of boxing.</p>
<p>Physical activity is like, honestly,</p>
<p>one of my favorite things to do.</p>
<p>And I have been testing it out on content</p>
<p>and we have a creator friend</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s hosting a chess boxing tournament,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no woman who could match me, unfortunately,</p>
<p>because all the opponents are male</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t fight a guy.</p>
<p>How does chess boxing work?</p>
<p>So you do a round of chess and a round of boxing.</p>
<p>And we actually did a training camp for it before.</p>
<p>And of course, after you go into the ring.</p>
<p>Is this real?</p>
<p>Is this serious?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>We went to a London chess boxing club.</p>
<p>And after you get&hellip;</p>
<p>No, it seemed like videos,</p>
<p>I thought it was something you&rsquo;d just do in Russia</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a real sport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real sport.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s very cool.</p>
<p>But after you get really tired,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to make a mistake</p>
<p>and they call them Jaffers or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s probably good strategies,</p>
<p>like what do you want to&hellip;</p>
<p>Because some of it is a cardio thing.</p>
<p>Do you want to work on your chess or your boxing?</p>
<p>They do both, it&rsquo;s very fun.</p>
<p>But yeah, from a content perspective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of people that would love to see.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to see Andrea getting hit.</p>
<p>That would be&hellip;</p>
<p>I would love to fight.</p>
<p>Unless she doesn&rsquo;t get hit.</p>
<p>Our roommate fought in a fight</p>
<p>and she did end up winning,</p>
<p>but seeing her get hit,</p>
<p>I thought I was going to throw up off screen.</p>
<p>I just think it was so cool.</p>
<p>She had no experience in boxing whatsoever.</p>
<p>And then coming from someone in the content world,</p>
<p>where you start waking up six days a week at 6 a.m.</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s training every day,</p>
<p>like a real professional athlete,</p>
<p>I think like it&rsquo;s such a unique experience</p>
<p>and also like a really test</p>
<p>of how much you can really commit to this and progress.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s really rewarding.</p>
<p>Did you ever end up doing the marathon with David Goggins</p>
<p>that you were training for?</p>
<p>No, I got injured, but we&rsquo;re going to do it soon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s on my bucket list,</p>
<p>just to see what your limits are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ready to do it?</p>
<p>What did you do leading up to this?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just going to go into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mental anyway.</p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I run a lot to make sure like there&rsquo;s no&hellip;</p>
<p>You have to have a base level of fitness</p>
<p>to make sure your body doesn&rsquo;t completely freak out.</p>
<p>But other than that, 50 plus miles is just about</p>
<p>like taking it one step at a time</p>
<p>and just being able to deal with the suffering</p>
<p>and all the voices, the little voices</p>
<p>that tell you all the excuses,</p>
<p>like why are you doing this?</p>
<p>This blister is bleeding, whatever.</p>
<p>Whatever the thing that makes you want to stop,</p>
<p>just shut it off.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like you like pain.</p>
<p>No, well, no, no.</p>
<p>But the pain does seem to show the way to progress.</p>
<p>So what&hellip;</p>
<p>In your turn of life.</p>
<p>In my world.</p>
<p>Something that&rsquo;s really hard and I don&rsquo;t want to do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s like a universal truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, if there&rsquo;s a few doors to go into,</p>
<p>the one that I want to go into least,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one that usually is the right one.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I will learn something from it.</p>
<p>The David Goggins thing, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Listen, we&rsquo;re talking offline,</p>
<p>the conversation with Liv,</p>
<p>she has a very numeric, calculated risk.</p>
<p>Everything is planned.</p>
<p>I go with the heart.</p>
<p>I just go whatever the hell.</p>
<p>I think two years ago, I woke up,</p>
<p>it was summer, I decided to tweet,</p>
<p>I will do as many pushups.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I did this,</p>
<p>but I will do as many pushups and pull ups</p>
<p>as this week gets likes, something like that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And then that it got like 30,000.</p>
<p>Once you put it out on the internet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re held accountable.</p>
<p>Well, for myself, I mean, in some sense.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when, I already was connected to David</p>
<p>at that point, but that&rsquo;s when he called me.</p>
<p>And then didn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
<p>And then I did it and it was one of the hardest things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<p>How long did you take?</p>
<p>I did it for seven days and I got injured.</p>
<p>So I did about a few thousand.</p>
<p>Wait, so this is what got you to be injured?</p>
<p>This challenge?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I keep getting injured doing stuff.</p>
<p>But this particular thing, I started doing the,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize that you have to really ramp up.</p>
<p>So I got like overuse injury tendonitis on the shoulder</p>
<p>all the way down to the elbow.</p>
<p>So I took like eight or nine days off</p>
<p>and then started again.</p>
<p>And then it took about 31 days to do.</p>
<p>30,000.</p>
<p>The number was like 26, 27,000.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And it took like three, four hours a day.</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sounds like torture.</p>
<p>And not, you know, constantly asking myself,</p>
<p>what am I doing with my life?</p>
<p>This is why you&rsquo;re single, was the voice in my head.</p>
<p>This is what are you doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like face down on the carpet.</p>
<p>Like exhausted.</p>
<p>Like what, what?</p>
<p>Because of a tweet?</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Did you record it or you just?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>I did record it for myself.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now imagine doing this every day</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like to be a Twitch streamer.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing stupid things.</p>
<p>That was really important to me actually</p>
<p>to not make it into content.</p>
<p>You know, I recorded everything.</p>
<p>So maybe one day I could publish it.</p>
<p>I recorded it mostly because it&rsquo;s really hard to count.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When you get exhausted.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like I just, so you actually enter the Zen place</p>
<p>where with pushups, where it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like breathing.</p>
<p>You get into a rhythm and you can do quite a lot.</p>
<p>But I wanted to make sure like,</p>
<p>if I actually get this done, I want there to be evidence</p>
<p>that I got it done for myself so I can count it.</p>
<p>I had this idea that I would use machine learning</p>
<p>to like automatically process the video to count it.</p>
<p>But then like, after like 10 days,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even give a shit what anyone thought.</p>
<p>It was about me versus me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even care.</p>
<p>Lex versus Lex.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then, yeah.</p>
<p>And David was extremely supportive.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s when I realized like,</p>
<p>I really want to go head to head with him.</p>
<p>So yeah, those kinds of people are beautiful.</p>
<p>They really challenge you to your limits.</p>
<p>Whatever that is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, the thing is physical exercise</p>
<p>is such an easy way to push yourself to your limit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s in all other walks of life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trickier to configure.</p>
<p>Like how do you push yourself to your limits in chess?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to figure out.</p>
<p>But like in physical.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s ever dangerous?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>The danger.</p>
<p>She likes the pain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that your eyes lit up as I said.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re gonna get out of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out something profound</p>
<p>about yourself.</p>
<p>And I mean, one of the reasons I went to Ukraine</p>
<p>is I really wanted to experience the hardship</p>
<p>and the intensity of war that people are experiencing</p>
<p>so I can understand myself better,</p>
<p>I can understand them better.</p>
<p>So the words that are leaving my mouth are grounded</p>
<p>in a better understanding of who they are.</p>
<p>And I mean, the running a lot with David Gong</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a much simpler thing to do.</p>
<p>Simpler way to understand something about yourself,</p>
<p>about like the limits of human nature.</p>
<p>I think most growth happens with voluntary suffering</p>
<p>or struggle, involuntary stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the dark trauma is created.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it is.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just attracted to torture.</p>
<p>And what is it that your mind does</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going through this involuntary suffering?</p>
<p>I think,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like stages.</p>
<p>First, all the excuses start coming.</p>
<p>Like why are you doing this?</p>
<p>And then you start to wonder like what kind of person</p>
<p>do you want to be?</p>
<p>So all the dreams you had,</p>
<p>all the promises you made to yourself and to others,</p>
<p>all the ambitions you had that haven&rsquo;t come yet realized,</p>
<p>somehow that all becomes really intensely like visceral</p>
<p>as the struggle is happening.</p>
<p>And then when all of that is allowed to pass from your mind,</p>
<p>you have this clear appreciation</p>
<p>of what you really love in life,</p>
<p>which is just like just living.</p>
<p>Just the moment, the step at a time.</p>
<p>I think what meditation does and it&rsquo;s most effective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that pain is a catalyst</p>
<p>for the meditative process, I think.</p>
<p>For me, for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Magnus said there&rsquo;s no meaning to life.</p>
<p>Do you guys agree or no?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>I do not know why we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>but I do know that having some kind of meaning</p>
<p>that I give my own life</p>
<p>makes it a lot more motivating every day.</p>
<p>So I just try to focus on finding meaning within my own life</p>
<p>even if I know it&rsquo;s just self imposed.</p>
<p>And then chess is a part of that?</p>
<p>Chess is a part of it.</p>
<p>Maybe it was more so when I was younger</p>
<p>because it was easier to just feel like I wanna improve</p>
<p>as a person and to use chess</p>
<p>to kind of measure some kind of self improvement.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s more different than that.</p>
<p>And I think I need to once again find</p>
<p>what that northern star is.</p>
<p>Basically, I need to have a why for why I&rsquo;m doing things.</p>
<p>And then I feel like I could do very hard things.</p>
<p>What role does love play in the human condition?</p>
<p>Alex and Andrea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let Andrea start this one since I took the last.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And yeah, just to add my answer for the last one.</p>
<p>I also kind of think, well, life is meaningless,</p>
<p>but I like the stoic idea where that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that you live to revolt against.</p>
<p>But for the second question.</p>
<p>The revolt against the fundamental meaninglessness of life.</p>
<p>I like it. Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was what does love play?</p>
<p>What role does love play?</p>
<p>Yeah, in the human condition.</p>
<p>The way I see it,</p>
<p>love is a reason you want to share experiences</p>
<p>with other people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I see it.</p>
<p>Like the people you really love,</p>
<p>you wanna share the things you&rsquo;re going through with them.</p>
<p>The good and the bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my simple take on love.</p>
<p>My take on it is that part of what it is to be human</p>
<p>is to be somebody who feels things emotionally</p>
<p>and love is one of the most intense feelings you can have.</p>
<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s the opposite of that</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s things like hate,</p>
<p>but I think the love you feel for people like your parents</p>
<p>and your friends and romantic love in that moment</p>
<p>is much more intense than in other situations.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s also just very unique to humans</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I appreciate about it.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what the Stoics are searching for.</p>
<p>Andrea, Alex, thank you so much for this</p>
