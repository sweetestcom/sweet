<p>Ôªøwell hello everyone I have a special</p>
<p>guest today this is an amazing success</p>
<p>story</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sky de welcome how are you doing</p>
<p>thanks for being on you a remarkable</p>
<p>story I want to know a little bit about</p>
<p>growing up you always had a weight</p>
<p>problem can you tell me a little bit</p>
<p>about that I was never in a weight even</p>
<p>when I was a toddler I was overweight</p>
<p>even evil even like when you were born</p>
<p>did your mother ever say like you</p>
<p>started gaining weight like at age 2 or</p>
<p>3 was there a certain year that you</p>
<p>started gaining weight when I see my</p>
<p>photos when I was a kid maybe when I was</p>
<p>by 2 years old I was fine I look fine</p>
<p>but after that I would not even in</p>
<p>kindergarten I was anyone else in my</p>
<p>class Wow what did you have any steroids</p>
<p>that you know that your parents ever</p>
<p>give you steroids or antibiotics or</p>
<p>infections or you have asthma anything</p>
<p>like that were the symptoms upper</p>
<p>respiratory or a lung we&rsquo;re with us that</p>
<p>the symptoms you know when you are kid</p>
<p>you go to the doctor and they would just</p>
<p>prescribe you injections and medications</p>
<p>I cannot remember anything I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>anything my mother&rsquo;s an old woman she</p>
<p>cannot read and write so whatever doctor</p>
<p>says it goes ok I got it I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>why I asked that question a little bit</p>
<p>later but go ahead you&rsquo;re you were gonna</p>
<p>say tell me a little bit about</p>
<p>went through your whole childhood</p>
<p>struggling with weight yes all the time</p>
<p>all the time I was fat I was being</p>
<p>ridiculed at being called names and all</p>
<p>of that and even though that I was</p>
<p>eating just the amount of the other kids</p>
<p>I was teaching just like them I was</p>
<p>playing with them but I was like double</p>
<p>the size of them no matter what I did I</p>
<p>started my first date when I was nine</p>
<p>years old Wow yes and it was very strict</p>
<p>it was very hard for me and I I I lost</p>
<p>maybe 14 kilograms in a year and then I</p>
<p>give up because it was too hard for me</p>
<p>as a kid then I started trying with</p>
<p>myself after I became in 14 I start to</p>
<p>become trying the ice by myself and then</p>
<p>I became anorexic then I became bulimic</p>
<p>and start the cycle Wow I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>suffering from it you know what you</p>
<p>cannot cure this I still have to fight</p>
<p>this yeah safe safer place with keto so</p>
<p>did you become bulimic when you were</p>
<p>like with 13 or 14 what what age no I</p>
<p>started yeah and then believe me I said</p>
<p>15 to 16 okay and then it was like a</p>
<p>cycle of anorexia and bulimia and binge</p>
<p>eating Wow</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t help them metabolism but</p>
<p>say that just kept going and how old are</p>
<p>you now I&rsquo;m going to be 45 in July this</p>
<p>has been a long time it&rsquo;s been a very</p>
<p>long time</p>
<p>yes Wow</p>
<p>so you you struggle it with the weight</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going along and you had other</p>
<p>symptoms as well did you not did you</p>
<p>have some other body issues or I think</p>
<p>you had you remember telling me about</p>
<p>you had some other issues fatigue</p>
<p>anxiety started nothing before 16 at 16</p>
<p>I start getting depression okay and</p>
<p>fatigue yes</p>
<p>very sweet mood but it was it was good</p>
<p>luck</p>
<p>you know teenage years yeah no it was</p>
<p>nothing and it was like a cycle in and</p>
<p>out of it but it was the Depression</p>
<p>started with me at 16 no my health</p>
<p>became so bad in my twenties that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>working and what&rsquo;s in what way like the</p>
<p>depression or some other problems the</p>
<p>depression became worse and then I</p>
<p>started to having problems in memories I</p>
<p>had a problem to connect my brain to my</p>
<p>hands when I was in the university I was</p>
<p>sitting the class and all of a sudden I</p>
<p>cannot understand what&rsquo;s being said to</p>
<p>me and even if I understand I want to</p>
<p>take a note my hand cannot write what my</p>
<p>brains telling it so I struggled with</p>
<p>University and I became more depressed</p>
<p>and I was being fatigued I was being</p>
<p>gone no not myself I&rsquo;m in a class and</p>
<p>all of a sudden I feel like I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>another world all foggy I&rsquo;m not in the</p>
<p>same class I&rsquo;m not the same board I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t remember anything like I&rsquo;m in the</p>
<p>class of the first time I don&rsquo;t know as</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t know English I don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>teacher I didn&rsquo;t know my classmates all</p>
<p>of a sudden it&rsquo;s just closes on me I</p>
<p>know nothing</p>
<p>Wow terrifying really terrifying and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know what was wrong with me very</p>
<p>lazy I&rsquo;m very stupid and I lost my</p>
<p>university degree because of that I</p>
<p>never graduated from it so I was blaming</p>
<p>myself I said oh you&rsquo;re stupid you were</p>
<p>anorexic that&rsquo;s why you cared about your</p>
<p>body not about your health and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how why you lost your university degree</p>
<p>but now I understand no but totally my</p>
<p>fault actually</p>
<p>right exactly you&rsquo;re going along and I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re probably trying a</p>
<p>lot of different solutions along the way</p>
<p>right trying this trying that yes</p>
<p>diets crosses me I tried it everything I</p>
<p>left nothing Wow yes nothing even crazy</p>
<p>diets like this cabbage soup diet and</p>
<p>banana diet egg diet</p>
<p>I left nothing and in an anorexia was</p>
<p>anorexic for years I would eat like 50</p>
<p>calorie a day no more and I would still</p>
<p>not lose weight wow that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>depressing</p>
<p>my gosh</p>
<p>so this went on for years and then when</p>
<p>did you tell me when things started this</p>
<p>shift</p>
<p>what was the taught the time things</p>
<p>started to shift for you yeah like what</p>
<p>information did you get that led you to</p>
<p>trying something that did work well</p>
<p>because my house my house became so bad</p>
<p>it was scary actually</p>
<p>my heart was getting deteriorated in the</p>
<p>last few years but the last two years it</p>
<p>was scary in a way that if I went to the</p>
<p>specialist doctors the best of the best</p>
<p>in my country</p>
<p>nobody even could diagnose what&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>with me</p>
<p>the depression was way over my head</p>
<p>no medication was working with me I had</p>
<p>the suicidal thoughts I was always</p>
<p>thinking I cannot I cannot breathe</p>
<p>without thinking that I need to die now</p>
<p>not tomorrow to happen now and I wanted</p>
<p>to be in very very violent very it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like every breath is hard for me and I</p>
<p>tried to commit suicide many times and</p>
<p>one time twice to the very serious I was</p>
<p>in the hospital friends for two days I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>good and this is about suicide but even</p>
<p>my blood was raging all the time I was</p>
<p>being very angry as you take it for no</p>
<p>reason I wanted to fight</p>
<p>I want I was even able to kill someone</p>
<p>because I was so raging I thought that</p>
<p>if I get into a fight with someone it</p>
<p>would be physical and I would kill them</p>
<p>even and even this I would I would think</p>
<p>about the scenario I would say even if</p>
<p>that kills them if it&rsquo;s not enough I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>that great even killing a person is not</p>
<p>enough to kill me and I was very scared</p>
<p>about all these thoughts I would I would</p>
<p>actually lock myself in my room and not</p>
<p>if you see my family sit with my family</p>
<p>because I was scared during that period</p>
<p>of time were you on medication at the</p>
<p>same time did they put your name it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing is working so I would stop any</p>
<p>medication sometimes I would go to</p>
<p>someone help me please I&rsquo;m in this</p>
<p>situation that would give me at some</p>
<p>indication it would call me a little bit</p>
<p>for like three or four weeks and then no</p>
<p>because the interesting thing about the</p>
<p>feeling of those feelings you told me</p>
<p>about that&rsquo;s like one of the big side</p>
<p>effects of certain medications so I was</p>
<p>just curious I mean it&rsquo;s definitely a</p>
<p>classic that&rsquo;s why they they put some of</p>
<p>the black labels on some of these</p>
<p>medications that warn people against</p>
<p>that because it&rsquo;s not a natural thing to</p>
<p>have someone have those impulses so so</p>
<p>eventually you you found one of my</p>
<p>videos right tell me about that yeah</p>
<p>well my house beside my mental health I</p>
<p>was like physically I couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything I was always in my bed I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t walk and sometimes my body gets</p>
<p>like a wave of stiffness and all my body</p>
<p>would get stiff I cannot even move my</p>
<p>mouth I cannot move my my eyes I cannot</p>
<p>do nothing&rsquo;s like there is no connection</p>
<p>between what my brain was to work and my</p>
<p>bunny I cannot do nothing for my body</p>
<p>and this would be like four minutes and</p>
<p>sometimes for half an hour or an hour it</p>
<p>depends and sometimes I would get like</p>
<p>he heads like this and sometimes would</p>
<p>stay with me for months actually</p>
<p>sometimes I would I want to walk and</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m walking all of a sudden I get</p>
<p>stiff I can&rsquo;t move my leg and if I work</p>
<p>I work like up and you&rsquo;d learn like I</p>
<p>can balance myself my spine is like</p>
<p>Wiggly my legs are Wiggly I can fall I</p>
<p>would I would fall from any noise from</p>
<p>any sudden noise any sudden movement</p>
<p>anything it will just make me fall from</p>
<p>from my feet and what - Azzam I would be</p>
<p>like shaking and all my body just like</p>
<p>squeezes on me non-stop constant no</p>
<p>matter what I do I&rsquo;m in constant pain</p>
<p>and after I did my stomach sleep</p>
<p>actually for the first year I was better</p>
<p>because you know say we don&rsquo;t eat enough</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t connect all of these things so</p>
<p>for me I was fine after I become better</p>
<p>and I can eat better my health just went</p>
<p>downhill you did the gastric bypass for</p>
<p>weight loss at that point and you felt a</p>
<p>little bit better and for those of you</p>
<p>that are just watching the reason why</p>
<p>she felt better is that when you have</p>
<p>gastric bypass at least initially it</p>
<p>bypasses something in the small</p>
<p>intestine that reduces your risk for</p>
<p>diabetes it reduces insulin especially</p>
<p>high insulin because high insulin is</p>
<p>usually behind a lot of problems you</p>
<p>mentioned but go ahead continue so you</p>
<p>you got the gastric gastric bypass felt</p>
<p>better and then all of a sudden you slip</p>
<p>back and started feeling worse when you</p>
<p>start eating yes all of these things</p>
<p>just became worse and worse and worse</p>
<p>and plus I would get to like now</p>
<p>understand that was insulin resistant</p>
<p>symptoms I would get hungry all the time</p>
<p>tired all the time I would wake up from</p>
<p>my sleep three four times every night a</p>
<p>feeling like a drop and I need to eat</p>
<p>snack to feel at all</p>
<p>better and with that when I eat I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>satisfied I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not full</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never full and I was always look for</p>
<p>chocolates and sugar and all the sweet</p>
<p>things and of course my health became</p>
<p>worse and worse till I was actually</p>
<p>better than I I couldn&rsquo;t even sit I</p>
<p>cannot sit for like five minutes</p>
<p>I always need to lay down to let me feel</p>
<p>a little bit better you know I have no</p>
<p>strength I have no control of my body</p>
<p>sometimes even I need to go to the</p>
<p>bathroom or even take a sip of water and</p>
<p>the water is right beside me I cannot</p>
<p>actually reach the water it was it was</p>
<p>that bad with me Wow and one day I was</p>
<p>in my bed scrolling in the iPad to watch</p>
<p>anything to describe struck me from my</p>
<p>pain and your video was on the</p>
<p>recommendation hmm because a few a few</p>
<p>months ago I was searching for why am I</p>
<p>always hungry why do I feel hungry or</p>
<p>when I eat fruits why I make smoothie</p>
<p>and makes me more hungry instead of full</p>
<p>why a bananas making me hungry and I</p>
<p>thought no no I find nothing until few</p>
<p>months later when your video showed up</p>
<p>and actually I ignored it I said what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>insulin is it one of the video of yours</p>
<p>about insulin resistance was like 20</p>
<p>minutes on video and I said oh is that</p>
<p>and I ignored it and for the next 45</p>
<p>days every time I open my iPad and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the same video every time and I</p>
<p>grabbed I said who is this doctor what</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking about and why is it</p>
<p>recommended for me and I would ignore it</p>
<p>until one day it&rsquo;s just I got curious I</p>
<p>said oh let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see what you&rsquo;d never</p>
<p>see and this clicks changed my life Wow</p>
<p>I kept trying to tell you but you just</p>
<p>were ignoring me until finally I had to</p>
<p>remind you I had to bug you enough worse</p>
<p>like watch my video</p>
<p>why how should my feet for after months</p>
<p>of searching I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and why&rsquo;s this video all the time is the</p>
<p>same video for days doctor until I</p>
<p>watched it and it was not clicked yes it</p>
<p>was like a viewer you were talking about</p>
<p>me when you were describing the</p>
<p>insulin-resistant symptoms</p>
<p>it was like as if you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>me or your talk about my situation he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually describing me Wow</p>
<p>yes miss a video again and then I</p>
<p>started to watch other videos I want to</p>
<p>see what&rsquo;s this heat oh you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about and I was in a very bad state is</p>
<p>that even your short videos that four or</p>
<p>five minutes even these sometimes I</p>
<p>would fall asleep even in these five</p>
<p>minutes I would just go into sleep and I</p>
<p>need to rewatch it every watching until</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be able to finish just five minutes</p>
<p>sometimes eight or ten times I need to</p>
<p>reverse one video to be able to go</p>
<p>through actually and sometimes just to</p>
<p>understand it because my brain was so</p>
<p>bad doctor I couldn&rsquo;t guess I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember anything so I needed to watch</p>
<p>everything most of all times to actually</p>
<p>understand this one Wow Wow</p>
<p>so so obviously you started eating</p>
<p>differently and tell us what happened</p>
<p>after that well about four or five days</p>
<p>I went to and tell them I need to make</p>
<p>to do me a blood test for insulin</p>
<p>resistant unfortunately he did around</p>
<p>one practice for me yes and they called</p>
<p>me said you have no insulin resistant</p>
<p>and I was happy because now</p>
<p>have to actually cut colors I can eat</p>
<p>bread I can eat chocolate oh it&rsquo;s happy</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s voice inside of me that kept</p>
<p>bugging me the same day kept bugging me</p>
<p>no way no way this doctor was talking</p>
<p>about you and he was describing you no</p>
<p>way he is wrong in what he&rsquo;s saying I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>tried so many crazy diets in my life try</p>
<p>this one it will not kill me and the</p>
<p>next day I woke up I fried some eggs</p>
<p>with butter and bacon and coffee and</p>
<p>that was it I for the firt like within</p>
<p>three weeks sudden I realized that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have any suicidal thoughts</p>
<p>even though doctor I didn&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>that no when I looked at your videos I</p>
<p>was just trying to find a way to just</p>
<p>get up from bed just to walk I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know about the cycle psychology I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that will make me feel better I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know so many all these things</p>
<p>about keto I didn&rsquo;t know about it so all</p>
<p>of a sudden three weeks in and I really</p>
<p>realized that say it&rsquo;s the first time in</p>
<p>years I don&rsquo;t feel like I want to kill</p>
<p>myself about my family I&rsquo;m not raging</p>
<p>and then I got it YouTube and search dr.</p>
<p>Berg keto and suicide and all this and</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m allowed so it works and this</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;ve just insulin resistant and</p>
<p>then I start to be more interested about</p>
<p>keto in treatment not just weight loss</p>
<p>or not just as an insulin resistance</p>
<p>program I realize that it&rsquo;s much much</p>
<p>more than that</p>
<p>Wow did you also know bozer since I</p>
<p>became on keto I never got this</p>
<p>stiffness</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>the only thing that kept with me because</p>
<p>I had constant nightmares and I would</p>
<p>get fevers and I would get shaky hands</p>
<p>please I started carnival and carnival</p>
<p>help me in this keto made it much much</p>
<p>less subdued much carnival helped me to</p>
<p>go 100% he took me to 95% to 100% mixing</p>
<p>between Quito and carnival three months</p>
<p>just three months doctor that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible so that tells me you must</p>
<p>have had some digestive issues</p>
<p>what about did you start doing any</p>
<p>intimate of fasting as well well but</p>
<p>then without me thinking I was fasting</p>
<p>for about 14 to 16 hours a day</p>
<p>wow these are body without me feeling</p>
<p>hungry and this happened very fast</p>
<p>within five or six days I started waking</p>
<p>up and I&rsquo;m not calm not hungry it just</p>
<p>tells me the power of how amazing the</p>
<p>body can bounce back if it has the right</p>
<p>thing even if there&rsquo;s a damage in your</p>
<p>brain from the past carbs which we know</p>
<p>that you ate a few of them</p>
<p>the ketones bypass the damage and start</p>
<p>to actually feed the neurons in your</p>
<p>brain and the heart and I can imagine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just probably such a sense of</p>
<p>relief to have to you know get over this</p>
<p>thing oh my gosh I can&rsquo;t imagine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so amazing</p>
<p>Yes Doctor I was I was always saying as</p>
<p>I told you before because it&rsquo;s scary now</p>
<p>I cannot believe that all what I was</p>
<p>suffering from and all my life was</p>
<p>ruined because of cars and nobody ever</p>
<p>told me anything I went to so many</p>
<p>specialists so many specialists and I</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>please tell me something something is</p>
<p>wrong with me and they told me there is</p>
<p>nothing wrong with you it&rsquo;s just a guess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an actual diagnosis it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>guess and they would give me treatments</p>
<p>and nothing works and some of them</p>
<p>actually they told me you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>imagining it you&rsquo;re just in distress</p>
<p>just calm down and I was I was in a very</p>
<p>distressed mood because now I can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>trust myself with what I&rsquo;m feeling and</p>
<p>my family started to not believe me but</p>
<p>I think actually I am suffering for real</p>
<p>they thought that state of mind that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to be sick I want people to</p>
<p>care about me and so I felt hopeless oh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hopeless yeah I was going to give</p>
<p>up actually and now when I think what I</p>
<p>was like two years ago and where I am</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s scary doctor that&rsquo;s all because</p>
<p>of calm yeah just go carbohydrates for</p>
<p>those of you that are new to this</p>
<p>information there&rsquo;s a test that</p>
<p>unfortunately they should have done any</p>
<p>long time ago it&rsquo;s called homa ir hom a</p>
<ul>
<li>I R it measures fasting insulin and an</li>
</ul>
<p>glucose but it&rsquo;s mainly the insulin</p>
<p>fasting test that they never test they</p>
<p>would have found that your insulin is</p>
<p>probably off the charts growing up and I</p>
<p>think this is what I think that happened</p>
<p>I was in practice for 30 years and they</p>
<p>were there there&rsquo;s always a group of</p>
<p>people who came in that were born</p>
<p>overweight they like but when you start</p>
<p>to ask them questions about if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sometimes their mother did remember and</p>
<p>I found out that either their asthmatic</p>
<p>they had some type of infection ear</p>
<p>infection throat infection the flu some</p>
<p>type of infection early on that affected</p>
<p>the endocrine system and true things off</p>
<p>to the point where it slowed the</p>
<p>metabolism down which is fascinating not</p>
<p>to mention that if they gave you</p>
<p>treatments whether it&rsquo;s antibiotics or</p>
<p>this or that that makes it where</p>
<p>especially as a child so that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>what started the whole thing and then I</p>
<p>could imagine if you&rsquo;re like me I mean</p>
<p>I just lived on carbs and not even</p>
<p>connecting the dots between your</p>
<p>cognitive function and those</p>
<p>carbohydrates and your blood Sugar&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>mean the what Kido does especially even</p>
<p>intermittent fasting with the right kind</p>
<p>of Kido</p>
<p>or carnivore which puts you in Quito</p>
<p>hard core it affects your mood it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>bring you right up just bring you out of</p>
<p>these lower mood states and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a point where you can</p>
<p>actually be where you don&rsquo;t crave</p>
<p>anything it&rsquo;s like you just ate but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not hungry and you just you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>satisfied and you feel calm here I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>curious did you have you taken any B</p>
<p>vitamins yet or nutritional yeast the B</p>
<p>ones the B vitamins specifically</p>
<p>especially vitamin b1 will take away</p>
<p>that internal anger and stress and</p>
<p>pressure it would take it away within</p>
<p>three minutes just like so and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just coming it&rsquo;s basically it&rsquo;s a kind</p>
<p>of a it&rsquo;s a lot it&rsquo;s called lactic</p>
<p>acidosis where you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>combination you don&rsquo;t have enough oxygen</p>
<p>in your body and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting this tension and you just need</p>
<p>some relief and you sometimes you get</p>
<p>restless leg you can&rsquo;t you cannot sit</p>
<p>still and it&rsquo;s just yet you&rsquo;re exhausted</p>
<p>all the time so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a nervous</p>
<p>energy that it&rsquo;s a severe b1 deficiency</p>
<p>and the B one is supposed to feed that</p>
<p>part of your brain I don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>saw my video on the hippocampus which is</p>
<p>all about the memory and having</p>
<p>remembering things and and also learning</p>
<p>so I think you maybe have to go back to</p>
<p>school now that you can hopefully start</p>
<p>learning very soon and you can retain</p>
<p>data actually the most thing that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>careful I want to do is to help people</p>
<p>and to open their eyes that there is a</p>
<p>solution for your problem because nobody</p>
<p>did this for me I went to so many people</p>
<p>and nobody had an answer for me now that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found it my way I don&rsquo;t want others</p>
<p>to suffer like me and have no answers</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve created my Instagram</p>
<p>account and my YouTube account and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to teach people about Duke eat or</p>
<p>not just as if you said doctor when you</p>
<p>win you&rsquo;re healthy you will lose your</p>
<p>fats but be healthy first take care of</p>
<p>your body first and you will lose fine</p>
<p>and you will be healthy so don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about I need to do this I need to do</p>
<p>that because I want to lose 10 kg every</p>
<p>month be be healthy and your body will</p>
<p>take care of it</p>
<p>it will eat keto and you will be fine</p>
<p>everything will be fine but first treat</p>
<p>the things when I talk to people so many</p>
<p>people of them they came to me just for</p>
<p>weight issues and then when I told them</p>
<p>do this and do that they would come back</p>
<p>to me and said actually I was very angry</p>
<p>person now I&rsquo;m very calm actually</p>
<p>because so many even I had a few things</p>
<p>that I was always thinking that oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a genetic thing oh I have this because</p>
<p>my aunt&rsquo;s has it my grandmother and now</p>
<p>on keto it disappeared so it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>genetic thing it&rsquo;s actually something</p>
<p>was wrong with my body</p>
<p>so even them and they said oh I thought</p>
<p>because my grandmother was like this so</p>
<p>I am like this now on Keeton it</p>
<p>disappeared so I tell them yes do maketo</p>
<p>the right way for the right reason and</p>
<p>your body won&rsquo;t just transform in a</p>
<p>magical way and this is I&rsquo;m very very</p>
<p>very passionate about and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve enrolled in your course so I would</p>
<p>get a certificate so at least I would</p>
<p>have some validation because I&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>specialist I&rsquo;m not a doctor</p>
<p>so people yes some of them are very</p>
<p>trusted what tell me they love me and</p>
<p>they trust my word but some people they</p>
<p>need this certification and I want to</p>
<p>learn from you more and more dr. Bergin</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know when someone was</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s life has changed and saved I</p>
<p>told you I was able to kill anybody I</p>
<p>was able to take drugs just because I</p>
<p>want to numb my pain and in my country</p>
<p>you kill someone deliberately you get</p>
<p>executed so I could have been executed</p>
<p>by now well it wasn&rsquo;t your video doctor</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s incredible magic yes can you</p>
<p>imagine that&rsquo;s why I want to learn from</p>
<p>you actually you are worried so forget</p>
<p>or whatever I want to learn I would just</p>
<p>go to youtube and dr. Beck and this and</p>
<p>that watch the videos that I need to</p>
<p>watch because you mama Saviour you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know me you don&rsquo;t know me you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that I exist and yet you you save my</p>
<p>life in so many ways for that I&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>thankful doctor you thank you I</p>
<p>appreciate that thank you</p>
<p>because you always wonder who&rsquo;s watching</p>
<p>these videos and then then you get to</p>
<p>see people like you even have each year</p>
<p>when I well not this year because of the</p>
<p>coma but each year we&rsquo;d have these</p>
<p>summits and we&rsquo;d have seven or eight</p>
<p>hundred people fly in from around the</p>
<p>world and you get to meet people that</p>
<p>are applying this information and with</p>
<p>amazing results but you don&rsquo;t know these</p>
<p>people you don&rsquo;t even know them but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting a video out and they</p>
<p>benefited from it so that&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>gratifying I have a question for you I</p>
<p>have a I think you know I have a a</p>
<p>channel in Arabic do you know yeah okay</p>
<p>yes and so what I&rsquo;ve noticed is that</p>
<p>people in the Middle East they a lot of</p>
<p>them have diabetes what what what are</p>
<p>they eating that&rsquo;s causing that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I don&rsquo;t know we have an abundance</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>face and restaurants and easy food very</p>
<p>high in white and sugar and because of</p>
<p>our weather we do not move a lot we</p>
<p>depend on the cards because it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>hard to mistake tons of beer so even</p>
<p>people who are go and walk a little bit</p>
<p>thirty minutes one hour will not learn</p>
<p>all of this you can you can resist a</p>
<p>cake today and tomorrow but you cannot</p>
<p>resist it every day and it&rsquo;s in your</p>
<p>face all the time and it&rsquo;s very easy we</p>
<p>have so many restaurants that have 24/7</p>
<p>that will deliver to your home and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even expensive so and all the</p>
<p>gatherings then has to be ok because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been - I&rsquo;ve been to Dubai and they</p>
<p>do have a lot of sweets there a lot of</p>
<p>different sweets and I&rsquo;m like oh my</p>
<p>goodness I&rsquo;m trying to find something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not from all over the world so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard very hard and into it we</p>
<p>have a specialist place for diabetes and</p>
<p>yet they do not test for insulin</p>
<p>resistance I was there for yes I joined</p>
<p>that Club for exercising and they did</p>
<p>all types of tests on me yet there was</p>
<p>no test for insulin resistance and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a specialist center for diabetes and it</p>
<p>is a resistance so many people many</p>
<p>weight is they do have some resistance</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t know all of a sudden is</p>
<p>it ready right I know I I really am I</p>
<p>just some really adamant about getting</p>
<p>the word out on that area I&rsquo;m glad that</p>
<p>you are gonna be helping as well what</p>
<p>about the other problem which is vitamin</p>
<p>D there&rsquo;s like a pandemic a vitamin D</p>
<p>deficiency now I&rsquo;m guessing correct me</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m wrong</p>
<p>but just because of the clothing</p>
<p>covering up most of the body it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna get a lot of vitamin D</p>
<p>exposure that way and obviously people</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t take by the Mandi as a</p>
<p>supplement and it&rsquo;s virtually impossible</p>
<p>to get your vitamin D from food so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s about it Mindy problem outcome</p>
<p>next week that&rsquo;s how big problem because</p>
<p>our club bring best one too because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too hot you just burn right and for that</p>
<p>we use cars and don&rsquo;t get enough</p>
<p>exposure</p>
<p>most of our malls are closed because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the heat so we do not get it</p>
<p>sometimes and you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting about vitamin D deficiencies</p>
<p>that can put you at risk for diabetes</p>
<p>right from there it can put your liver</p>
<p>at risk it can make you depressed</p>
<p>it can cause massive inflammation it can</p>
<p>create autoimmune problems this period</p>
<p>of very deficient so vitamin D is really</p>
<p>key with and also low immune system so I</p>
<p>mean I think that&rsquo;s like going to be a</p>
<p>big part of people really turning things</p>
<p>around to is just at least clean up the</p>
<p>vitamin deficiencies that people have in</p>
<p>different parts of the world but</p>
<p>especially in where you are but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such an easy fix you know if you just</p>
<p>have vitamin D but yeah it&rsquo;s just too</p>
<p>hot you cannot be out there for too long</p>
<p>or else he&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;ll you know little burn</p>
<p>you sore so I think it&rsquo;s like over a</p>
<p>hundred degrees right what&rsquo;s that in</p>
<p>Fahrenheit okay I know it&rsquo;s over a</p>
<p>hundred degrees I think it&rsquo;s a under</p>
<p>griefer I think it&rsquo;s probably a hundred</p>
<p>and ten maybe 115 maybe 20 it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>literally you can fry an egg on the</p>
<p>sidewalk</p>
<p>we cannot even open the clock door we</p>
<p>need to hold the teacher or something to</p>
<p>be able to hold the card or to open it</p>
<p>or to handle the wheels because it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>much if if the card is not under the</p>
<p>shield or something right under the Sun</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d actually bake inside the car well</p>
<p>no what I&rsquo;m curious about what did they</p>
<p>do a hundred and fifty years ago before</p>
<p>they had air conditioning what did they</p>
<p>do to sleep at night how did they</p>
<p>survive well actually my mother says it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t this bad it was simple life no</p>
<p>much we didn&rsquo;t have all these factories</p>
<p>and all the houses were made from by</p>
<p>month from mothers okay so so there was</p>
<p>air circulation like nowadays</p>
<p>refrigeration and yet it doesn&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>for two or three days yeah okay</p>
<p>fascinating</p>
<p>Wow well I&rsquo;m so glad you came up you</p>
<p>stumbled and you persisted and you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t ignore that video for too long</p>
<p>and then you finally watched it and you</p>
<p>learn something and you applied it and</p>
<p>now look at you and be like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re helping other people which is</p>
<p>amazing which is it they&rsquo;re near hey um</p>
<p>I appreciate that thank you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome well I wanted to thank</p>
<p>you for coming on I think a lot of</p>
<p>people are gonna get a lot of benefit</p>
<p>from this and hopefully if someone is</p>
<p>new to Quito they&rsquo;ll even try it there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of videos I&rsquo;ll put your link down</p>
<p>below if if your your videos are in</p>
<p>Arabic right yes okay yeah so this is</p>
<p>exciting so I will will follow up with</p>
<p>you and let me know when you become a</p>
<p>coach and we&rsquo;ll get you certified I have</p>
<p>a lot more courses coming up soon on</p>
<p>different things so you&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>advantage of that but you&rsquo;ll be part of</p>
<p>our coaching network so that</p>
<p>gonna be very exciting to help help</p>
<p>everyone that needs it</p>
<p>great I was looking for this doctor it&rsquo;s</p>
