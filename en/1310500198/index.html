    <p>The following is a conversation with Brett Weinstein,</p>
<p>evolutionary biologist, author, cohost</p>
<p>of the Dark Horse podcast, and, as he says,</p>
<p>reluctant radical.</p>
<p>Even though we&rsquo;ve never met or spoken before this,</p>
<p>we both felt like we&rsquo;ve been friends for a long time,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree on everything with Brett,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure as hell happy he exists</p>
<p>in this weird and wonderful world of ours.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Jordan Harmon&rsquo;s show, ExpressVPN, Magic Spoon,</p>
<p>and Four Sigmatic.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say a few words about COVID 19</p>
<p>and about science broadly.</p>
<p>I think science is beautiful and powerful.</p>
<p>It is the striving of the human mind</p>
<p>to understand and to solve the problems of the world.</p>
<p>But as an institution,</p>
<p>it is susceptible to the flaws of human nature,</p>
<p>to fear, to greed, power, and ego.</p>
<p>2020 is the story of all of these</p>
<p>that has both scientific triumph and tragedy.</p>
<p>We needed great leaders and we didn&rsquo;t get them.</p>
<p>What we needed is leaders who communicate</p>
<p>in an honest, transparent, and authentic way</p>
<p>about the uncertainty of what we know</p>
<p>and the large scale scientific efforts</p>
<p>to reduce that uncertainty and to develop solutions.</p>
<p>I believe there are several candidates for solutions</p>
<p>that could have all saved hundreds of billions of dollars</p>
<p>and lessened or eliminated</p>
<p>the suffering of millions of people.</p>
<p>Let me mention five of the categories of solutions.</p>
<p>Masks, at home testing, anonymized contact tracing,</p>
<p>antiviral drugs, and vaccines.</p>
<p>Within each of these categories,</p>
<p>institutional leaders should have constantly asked</p>
<p>and answered publicly, honestly,</p>
<p>the following three questions.</p>
<p>One, what data do we have on the solution</p>
<p>and what studies are we running</p>
<p>to get more and better data?</p>
<p>Two, given the current data and uncertainty,</p>
<p>how effective and how safe is the solution?</p>
<p>Three, what is the timeline and cost involved</p>
<p>with mass manufacturing distribution of the solution?</p>
<p>In the service of these questions,</p>
<p>no voices should have been silenced,</p>
<p>no ideas left off the table.</p>
<p>Open data, open science,</p>
<p>open, honest scientific communication and debate</p>
<p>was the way, not censorship.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ideas out there</p>
<p>that are bad, wrong, dangerous,</p>
<p>but the moment we have the hubris</p>
<p>to say we know which ideas those are</p>
<p>is the moment we&rsquo;ll lose our ability to find the truth,</p>
<p>to find solutions,</p>
<p>the very things that make science beautiful and powerful</p>
<p>in the face of all the dangers that threaten the wellbeing</p>
<p>and the existence of humans on Earth.</p>
<p>This conversation with Brett</p>
<p>is less about the ideas we talk about.</p>
<p>We agree on some, disagree on others.</p>
<p>It is much more about the very freedom to talk,</p>
<p>to think, to share ideas.</p>
<p>This freedom is our only hope.</p>
<p>Brett should never have been censored.</p>
<p>I asked Brett to do this podcast to show solidarity</p>
<p>and to show that I have hope for science and for humanity.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s my conversation with Brett Weinstein.</p>
<p>What to you is beautiful about the study of biology,</p>
<p>the science, the engineering, the philosophy of it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting question.</p>
<p>I must say at one level, it&rsquo;s not a conscious thing.</p>
<p>I can say a lot about why as an adult</p>
<p>I find biology compelling,</p>
<p>but as a kid I was completely fascinated with animals.</p>
<p>I loved to watch them and think about why they did</p>
<p>what they did and that developed into a very conscious</p>
<p>passion as an adult.</p>
<p>But I think in the same way that one is drawn to a person,</p>
<p>I was drawn to the never ending series of near miracles</p>
<p>that exists across biological nature.</p>
<p>When you see a living organism,</p>
<p>do you see it from an evolutionary biology perspective</p>
<p>of like this entire thing that moves around</p>
<p>in this world or do you see from an engineering perspective</p>
<p>that first principles almost down to the physics,</p>
<p>like the little components that build up hierarchies</p>
<p>that you have cells, the first proteins and cells</p>
<p>and organs and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So do you see low level or do you see high level?</p>
<p>Well, the human mind is a strange thing</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s probably a bit like a time sharing machine</p>
<p>in which I have different modules.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know enough about biology for them to connect.</p>
<p>So they exist in isolation and I&rsquo;m always aware</p>
<p>that they do connect, but I basically have to step</p>
<p>into a module in order to see the evolutionary dynamics</p>
<p>of the creature and the lineage that it belongs to.</p>
<p>I have to step into a different module to think</p>
<p>of that lineage over a very long time scale,</p>
<p>a different module still to understand</p>
<p>what the mechanisms inside would have to look like</p>
<p>to account for what we can see from the outside.</p>
<p>And I think that probably sounds really complicated,</p>
<p>but one of the things about being involved</p>
<p>in a topic like biology and doing so for one,</p>
<p>really not even just my adult life for my whole life</p>
<p>is that it becomes second nature.</p>
<p>And when we see somebody do an amazing parkour routine</p>
<p>or something like that, we think about what they must</p>
<p>be doing in order to accomplish that.</p>
<p>But of course, what they are doing is tapping</p>
<p>into some kind of zone, right?</p>
<p>They are in a zone in which they are in such command</p>
<p>of their center of gravity, for example,</p>
<p>that they know how to hurl it around a landscape</p>
<p>so that they always land on their feet.</p>
<p>And I would just say for anyone who hasn&rsquo;t found a topic</p>
<p>on which they can develop that kind of facility,</p>
<p>it is absolutely worthwhile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really something that human beings are capable</p>
<p>of doing across a wide range of topics,</p>
<p>many things our ancestors didn&rsquo;t even have access to.</p>
<p>And that flexibility of humans,</p>
<p>that ability to repurpose our machinery</p>
<p>for topics that are novel means really,</p>
<p>the world is your oyster.</p>
<p>You can figure out what your passion is</p>
<p>and then figure out all of the angles</p>
<p>that one would have to pursue to really deeply understand it.</p>
<p>And it is well worth having at least one topic like that.</p>
<p>You mean embracing the full adaptability</p>
<p>of both the body and the mind.</p>
<p>So like, I don&rsquo;t know what to attribute the parkour to,</p>
<p>like biomechanics of how our bodies can move,</p>
<p>or is it the mind?</p>
<p>Like how much percent wise,</p>
<p>is it the entirety of the hierarchies of biology</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>or is it just all the mind?</p>
<p>The way to think about creatures</p>
<p>is that every creature is two things simultaneously.</p>
<p>A creature is a machine of sorts, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a machine in the,</p>
<p>I call it an aqueous machine, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s run by an aqueous computer, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not identical to our technological machines.</p>
<p>But every creature is both a machine</p>
<p>that does things in the world</p>
<p>sufficient to accumulate enough resources</p>
<p>to continue surviving, to reproduce.</p>
<p>It is also a potential.</p>
<p>So each creature is potentially, for example,</p>
<p>the most recent common ancestor</p>
<p>of some future clade of creatures</p>
<p>that will look very different from it.</p>
<p>And if a creature is very, very good at being a creature,</p>
<p>but not very good in terms of the potential</p>
<p>it has going forward,</p>
<p>then that lineage will not last very long into the future</p>
<p>because change will throw at challenges</p>
<p>that its descendants will not be able to meet.</p>
<p>So the thing about humans is we are a generalist platform,</p>
<p>and we have the ability to swap out our software</p>
<p>to exist in many, many different niches.</p>
<p>And I was once watching an interview</p>
<p>with this British group of parkour experts</p>
<p>who were being, they were discussing what it is they do</p>
<p>and how it works.</p>
<p>And what they essentially said is,</p>
<p>look, you&rsquo;re tapping into deep monkey stuff, right?</p>
<p>And I thought, yeah, that&rsquo;s about right.</p>
<p>And anybody who is proficient at something</p>
<p>like skiing or skateboarding, you know,</p>
<p>has the experience of flying down the hill</p>
<p>on skis, for example,</p>
<p>bouncing from the top of one mogul to the next.</p>
<p>And if you really pay attention,</p>
<p>you will discover that your conscious mind</p>
<p>is actually a spectator.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s involved in the experience,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not driving.</p>
<p>Some part of you knows how to ski,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not the part of you that knows how to think.</p>
<p>And I would just say that what accounts</p>
<p>for this flexibility in humans</p>
<p>is the ability to bootstrap a new software program</p>
<p>and then drive it into the unconscious layer</p>
<p>where it can be applied very rapidly.</p>
<p>And, you know, I will be shocked</p>
<p>if the exact thing doesn&rsquo;t exist in robotics.</p>
<p>You know, if you programmed a robot</p>
<p>to deal with circumstances that were novel to it,</p>
<p>how would you do it?</p>
<p>It would have to look something like this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain kind of magic, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>with the consciousness being an observer.</p>
<p>When you play guitar, for example, or piano for me,</p>
<p>music, when you get truly lost in it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the heck is responsible</p>
<p>for the flow of the music,</p>
<p>the kind of the loudness of the music going up and down,</p>
<p>the timing, the intricate, like even the mistakes,</p>
<p>all those things,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the conscious mind.</p>
<p>It is just observing,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s somehow intricately involved.</p>
<p>More, like, because you mentioned parkour,</p>
<p>the dance is like that too.</p>
<p>When you start up in tango dancing,</p>
<p>if when you truly lose yourself in it,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s just like you&rsquo;re an observer,</p>
<p>and how the hell is the body able to do that?</p>
<p>And not only that, it&rsquo;s the physical motion</p>
<p>is also creating the emotion,</p>
<p>the, like, the damn is good to be alive feeling.</p>
<p>So, but then that&rsquo;s also intricately connected</p>
<p>to the full biology stack that we&rsquo;re operating in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how difficult it is to replicate that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking offline about Boston Dynamics robots.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve recently been, they did both parkour,</p>
<p>they did flips, they&rsquo;ve also done some dancing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something I think a lot about</p>
<p>because what most people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t look deep enough</p>
<p>is those robots are hard coded to do those things.</p>
<p>The robots didn&rsquo;t figure it out by themselves,</p>
<p>and yet the fundamental aspect of what it means to be human</p>
<p>is that process of figuring out, of making mistakes,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s something about overcoming</p>
<p>those challenges and the mistakes</p>
<p>and, like, figuring out how to lose yourself</p>
<p>in the magic of the dancing or just movement</p>
<p>is what it means to be human.</p>
<p>That learning process, so that&rsquo;s what I want to do</p>
<p>with the, almost as a fun side thing</p>
<p>with the Boston Dynamics robots,</p>
<p>is to have them learn and see what they figure out,</p>
<p>even if they make mistakes.</p>
<p>I want to let Spot make mistakes</p>
<p>and in so doing discover what it means to be alive,</p>
<p>discover beauty, because I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the essential aspect of mistakes.</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics folks want Spot to be perfect</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t want Spot to ever make mistakes</p>
<p>because it wants to operate in the factories,</p>
<p>it wants to be very safe and so on.</p>
<p>For me, if you construct the environment,</p>
<p>if you construct a safe space for robots</p>
<p>and allow them to make mistakes,</p>
<p>something beautiful might be discovered,</p>
<p>but that requires a lot of brain power.</p>
<p>So Spot is currently very dumb</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna give it a brain.</p>
<p>So first make it see, currently it can&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>meaning computer vision, it has to understand</p>
<p>its environment, it has to see all the humans,</p>
<p>but then also has to be able to learn,</p>
<p>learn about its movement, learn how to use its body</p>
<p>to communicate with others, all those kinds of things</p>
<p>that dogs know how to do well,</p>
<p>humans know how to do somewhat well.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a beautiful challenge,</p>
<p>but first you have to allow the robot to make mistakes.</p>
<p>Well, I think your objective is laudable,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna realize</p>
<p>that the Boston Dynamics folks are right</p>
<p>the first time Spot poops on your rug.</p>
<p>I hear the same thing about kids and so on.</p>
<p>I still wanna have kids.</p>
<p>No, you should, it&rsquo;s a great experience.</p>
<p>So let me step back into what you said</p>
<p>in a couple of different places.</p>
<p>One, I have always believed that the missing element</p>
<p>in robotics and artificial intelligence</p>
<p>is a proper development, right?</p>
<p>It is no accident, it is no mere coincidence</p>
<p>that human beings are the most dominant species</p>
<p>on planet Earth and that we have the longest childhoods</p>
<p>of any creature on Earth by far, right?</p>
<p>The development is the key to the flexibility.</p>
<p>And so the capability of a human at adulthood</p>
<p>is the mirror image, it&rsquo;s the flip side</p>
<p>of our helplessness at birth.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be very interested to see what happens</p>
<p>in your robot project if you do not end up</p>
<p>reinventing childhood for robots,</p>
<p>which of course is foreshadowed in 2001 quite brilliantly.</p>
<p>But I also wanna point out,</p>
<p>you can see this issue of your conscious mind</p>
<p>becoming a spectator very well</p>
<p>if you compare tennis to table tennis, right?</p>
<p>If you watch a tennis game, you could imagine</p>
<p>that the players are highly conscious as they play.</p>
<p>You cannot imagine that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ever played ping pong decently.</p>
<p>A volley in ping pong is so fast</p>
<p>that your conscious mind, if your reactions</p>
<p>had to go through your conscious mind,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to play.</p>
<p>So you can detect that your conscious mind,</p>
<p>while very much present, isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>And you can also detect where consciousness</p>
<p>does usefully intrude.</p>
<p>If you go up against an opponent in table tennis</p>
<p>that knows a trick that you don&rsquo;t know how to respond to,</p>
<p>you will suddenly detect that something</p>
<p>about your game is not effective,</p>
<p>and you will start thinking about what might be,</p>
<p>how do you position yourself so that move</p>
<p>that puts the ball just in that corner of the table</p>
<p>or something like that doesn&rsquo;t catch you off guard.</p>
<p>And this, I believe, is we highly conscious folks,</p>
<p>those of us who try to think through things</p>
<p>very deliberately and carefully,</p>
<p>mistake consciousness for the highest kind of thinking.</p>
<p>And I really think that this is an error.</p>
<p>Consciousness is an intermediate level of thinking.</p>
<p>What it does is it allows you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically like uncompiled code.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t run very fast.</p>
<p>It is capable of being adapted to new circumstances.</p>
<p>But once the code is roughed in,</p>
<p>it gets driven into the unconscious layer,</p>
<p>and you become highly effective at whatever it is.</p>
<p>And from that point, your conscious mind</p>
<p>basically remains there to detect things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t anticipated by the code you&rsquo;ve already written.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t exactly know how one would establish this,</p>
<p>how one would demonstrate it.</p>
<p>But it must be the case that the human mind</p>
<p>contains sandboxes in which things are tested, right?</p>
<p>Maybe you can build a piece of code</p>
<p>and run it in parallel next to your active code</p>
<p>so you can see how it would have done comparatively.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s gotta be some way of writing new code</p>
<p>and then swapping it in.</p>
<p>And frankly, I think this has a lot to do</p>
<p>with things like sleep cycles.</p>
<p>Very often, when I get good at something,</p>
<p>I often don&rsquo;t get better at it while I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>I get better at it when I&rsquo;m not doing it,</p>
<p>especially if there&rsquo;s time to sleep and think on it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some sort of new program</p>
<p>swapping in for old program phenomenon,</p>
<p>which will be a lot easier to see in machines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be hard with the wetware.</p>
<p>I like, I mean, it is true,</p>
<p>because somebody that played,</p>
<p>I played tennis for many years,</p>
<p>I do still think the highest form of excellence in tennis</p>
<p>is when the conscious mind is a spectator.</p>
<p>So the compiled code is the highest form of being human.</p>
<p>And then consciousness is just some specific compiler.</p>
<p>You used to have like Borland C++ compiler.</p>
<p>You could just have different kind of compilers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the thing that by which we measure</p>
<p>the power of life, the intelligence of life</p>
<p>is the compiled code.</p>
<p>And you can probably do that compilation all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not saying that tennis is played consciously</p>
<p>and table tennis isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that because tennis is slowed down</p>
<p>by the just the space on the court,</p>
<p>you could imagine that it was your conscious mind playing.</p>
<p>But when you shrink the court down,</p>
<p>It becomes obvious.</p>
<p>It becomes obvious that your conscious mind</p>
<p>is just present rather than knowing where to put the paddle.</p>
<p>And weirdly for me,</p>
<p>I would say this probably isn&rsquo;t true</p>
<p>in a podcast situation.</p>
<p>But if I have to give a presentation,</p>
<p>especially if I have not overly prepared,</p>
<p>I often find the same phenomenon</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m giving the presentation.</p>
<p>My conscious mind is there watching</p>
<p>some other part of me present,</p>
<p>which is a little jarring, I have to say.</p>
<p>Well, that means you&rsquo;ve gotten good at it.</p>
<p>Not let the conscious mind get in the way</p>
<p>of the flow of words.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the sensation to be sure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the highest form of podcasting too.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what it looks like</p>
<p>when a podcast is really in the pocket,</p>
<p>like Joe Rogan, just having fun</p>
<p>and just losing themselves.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I aspire to as well,</p>
<p>just losing yourself in conversation.</p>
<p>Somebody that has a lot of anxiety with people,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m such an introvert.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>I was scared before you showed up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just anxiety.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a giant mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to lose yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to just get out of the way of your own mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, trust is a big component of that.</p>
<p>Your conscious mind retains control</p>
<p>if you are very uncertain.</p>
<p>But when you do get into that zone when you&rsquo;re speaking,</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s different for you</p>
<p>with English as a second language,</p>
<p>although maybe you present in Russian and it happens.</p>
<p>But do you ever hear yourself say something</p>
<p>and you think, oh, that&rsquo;s really good, right?</p>
<p>Like you didn&rsquo;t come up with it,</p>
<p>some other part of you that you don&rsquo;t exactly know</p>
<p>came up with it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever heard myself in that way</p>
<p>because I have a much louder voice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s constantly yelling in my head at,</p>
<p>why the hell did you say that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very self critical voice that&rsquo;s much louder.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very, maybe I need to deal with that voice,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been like, what is it called?</p>
<p>Like a megaphone just screaming</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t hear the other voice that says,</p>
<p>good job, you said that thing really nicely.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of focused right now on the megaphone person</p>
<p>in the audience versus the positive,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s definitely something to think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been productive, but the place where I find gratitude</p>
<p>and beauty and appreciation of life is in the quiet moments</p>
<p>when I don&rsquo;t talk, when I listen to the world around me,</p>
<p>when I listen to others, when I talk,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely self critical in my mind.</p>
<p>When I produce anything out into the world</p>
<p>that originated with me,</p>
<p>like any kind of creation, extremely self critical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for productivity,</p>
<p>for always striving to improve and so on.</p>
<p>It might be bad for just appreciating</p>
<p>the things you&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit with Marvin Minsky on this</p>
<p>where he says the key to a productive life</p>
<p>is to hate everything you&rsquo;ve ever done in the past.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know he said that.</p>
<p>I must say, I resonate with it a bit.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, my life currently has me putting</p>
<p>a lot of stuff into the world,</p>
<p>and I effectively watch almost none of it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand it.</p>
<p>Yeah, what do you make of that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just yesterday read Metamorphosis by Kafka,</p>
<p>we read Metamorphosis by Kafka</p>
<p>where he turns into a giant bug</p>
<p>because of the stress that the world puts on him.</p>
<p>His parents put on him to succeed.</p>
<p>And I think that you have to find the balance</p>
<p>because if you allow the self critical voice</p>
<p>to become too heavy, the burden of the world,</p>
<p>the pressure that the world puts on you</p>
<p>to be the best version of yourself and so on to strive,</p>
<p>then you become a bug and that&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>And then the world turns against you because you&rsquo;re a bug.</p>
<p>You become some kind of caricature of yourself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you become the worst version of yourself</p>
<p>and then thereby end up destroying yourself</p>
<p>and then the world moves on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lovely story.</p>
<p>I do think this is one of these places,</p>
<p>and frankly, you could map this onto</p>
<p>all of modern human experience,</p>
<p>but this is one of these places</p>
<p>where our ancestral programming</p>
<p>does not serve our modern selves.</p>
<p>So I used to talk to students</p>
<p>about the question of dwelling on things.</p>
<p>Dwelling on things is famously understood to be bad</p>
<p>and it can&rsquo;t possibly be bad.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t exist, the tendency toward it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t exist if it was bad.</p>
<p>So what is bad is dwelling on things</p>
<p>past the point of utility.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s obviously easier to say than to operationalize,</p>
<p>but if you realize that your dwelling is the key, in fact,</p>
<p>to upgrading your program for future well being</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a point, presumably,</p>
<p>from diminishing returns, if not counter productivity,</p>
<p>there is a point at which you should stop</p>
<p>because that is what is in your best interest,</p>
<p>then knowing that you&rsquo;re looking for that point is useful.</p>
<p>This is the point at which it is no longer useful</p>
<p>for me to dwell on this error I have made.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>And it also gives you license, right?</p>
<p>If some part of you feels like it&rsquo;s punishing you</p>
<p>rather than searching, then that also has a point</p>
<p>at which it&rsquo;s no longer valuable</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some liberty in realizing,</p>
<p>yep, even the part of me that was punishing me</p>
<p>knows it&rsquo;s time to stop.</p>
<p>So if we map that onto compiled code discussion,</p>
<p>as a computer science person, I find that very compelling.</p>
<p>You know, when you compile code, you get warnings sometimes.</p>
<p>And usually, if you&rsquo;re a good software engineer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to make sure there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>you know, you treat warnings as errors.</p>
<p>So you make sure that the compilation produces no warnings.</p>
<p>But at a certain point, when you have a large enough system,</p>
<p>you just let the warnings go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know where that warning came from,</p>
<p>but, you know, just ultimately you need to compile the code</p>
<p>and run with it and hope nothing terrible happens.</p>
<p>Well, I think what you will find, and believe me,</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>with respect to robots and learning</p>
<p>is gonna end up having to go to a deep developmental state</p>
<p>and a helplessness that evolves into hyper competence</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>But I live, I noticed that I live by something</p>
<p>that I, for lack of a better descriptor,</p>
<p>call the theory of close calls.</p>
<p>And the theory of close calls says that people</p>
<p>typically miscategorize the events in their life</p>
<p>where something almost went wrong.</p>
<p>And, you know, for example, if you,</p>
<p>I have a friend who, I was walking down the street</p>
<p>with my college friends and one of my friends</p>
<p>stepped into the street thinking it was clear</p>
<p>and was nearly hit by a car going 45 miles an hour,</p>
<p>would have been an absolute disaster, might have killed her,</p>
<p>certainly would have permanently injured her.</p>
<p>But she didn&rsquo;t, you know, car didn&rsquo;t touch her, right?</p>
<p>Now you could walk away from that and think nothing of it</p>
<p>because, well, what is there to think?</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Or you could think, well, what is the difference</p>
<p>between what did happen and my death?</p>
<p>The difference is luck.</p>
<p>I never want that to be true, right?</p>
<p>I never want the difference between what did happen</p>
<p>and my death to be luck.</p>
<p>Therefore, I should count this as very close to death</p>
<p>and I should prioritize coding</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t happen again at a very high level.</p>
<p>So anyway, my basic point is</p>
<p>the accidents and disasters and misfortune</p>
<p>describe a distribution that tells you</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really likely to get you in the end.</p>
<p>And so personally, you can use them to figure out</p>
<p>where the dangers are so that you can afford</p>
<p>to take great risks because you have a really good sense</p>
<p>of how they&rsquo;re gonna go wrong.</p>
<p>But I would also point out civilization has this problem.</p>
<p>Civilization is now producing these events</p>
<p>that are major disasters,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not existential scale yet, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very serious errors that we can see.</p>
<p>And I would argue that the pattern is</p>
<p>you discover that we are involved in some industrial process</p>
<p>at the point it has gone wrong, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now always asking the question,</p>
<p>okay, in light of the Fukushima triple meltdown,</p>
<p>the financial collapse of 2008,</p>
<p>the Deepwater Horizon blowout, COVID 19,</p>
<p>and its probable origins in the Wuhan lab,</p>
<p>what processes do I not know the name of yet</p>
<p>that I will discover at the point</p>
<p>that some gigantic accident has happened?</p>
<p>And can we talk about the wisdom or lack thereof</p>
<p>of engaging in that process before the accident, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a wise civilization would be doing.</p>
<p>And yet we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I just wanna mention something that happened</p>
<p>a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who JB Straubel is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the co founder of Tesla,</p>
<p>CTO of Tesla for many, many years.</p>
<p>His wife just died.</p>
<p>She was riding a bicycle.</p>
<p>And in the same thin line between death and life</p>
<p>that many of us have been in,</p>
<p>where you walk into the intersection</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this close call.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, you get the short straw.</p>
<p>I wonder how much of our own individual lives</p>
<p>and the entirety of the human civilization</p>
<p>rests on this little roll of the dice.</p>
<p>Well, this is sort of my point about the close calls</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a level at which we can&rsquo;t control it, right?</p>
<p>The gigantic asteroid that comes from deep space</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have time to do anything about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot we can do to hedge that out,</p>
<p>or at least not short term.</p>
<p>But there are lots of other things.</p>
<p>Obviously, the financial collapse of 2008</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t break down the entire world economy.</p>
<p>It threatened to, but a Herculean effort</p>
<p>managed to pull us back from the brink.</p>
<p>The triple meltdown at Fukushima was awful,</p>
<p>but every one of the seven fuel pools held,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t a major fire that made it impossible</p>
<p>to manage the disaster going forward.</p>
<p>We got lucky.</p>
<p>We could say the same thing about the blowout</p>
<p>at the Deepwater Horizon,</p>
<p>where a hole in the ocean floor large enough</p>
<p>that we couldn&rsquo;t have plugged it, could have opened up.</p>
<p>All of these things could have been much, much worse, right?</p>
<p>And I think we can say the same thing about COVID,</p>
<p>as terrible as it is.</p>
<p>And we cannot say for sure that it came from the Wuhan lab,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a strong likelihood that it did.</p>
<p>And it also could be much, much worse.</p>
<p>So in each of these cases, something is telling us,</p>
<p>we have a process that is unfolding</p>
<p>that keeps creating risks where it is luck</p>
<p>that is the difference between us</p>
<p>and some scale of disaster that is unimaginable.</p>
<p>And that wisdom, you can be highly intelligent</p>
<p>and cause these disasters.</p>
<p>To be wise is to stop causing them, right?</p>
<p>And that would require a process of restraint,</p>
<p>a process that I don&rsquo;t see a lot of evidence of yet.</p>
<p>So I think we have to generate it.</p>
<p>And somehow, at the moment,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a political structure</p>
<p>that would be capable of taking</p>
<p>a protective algorithm and actually deploying it, right?</p>
<p>Because it would have important economic consequences.</p>
<p>And so it would almost certainly be shot down.</p>
<p>But we can obviously also say,</p>
<p>we paid a huge price for all of the disasters</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve mentioned.</p>
<p>And we have to factor that into the equation.</p>
<p>Something can be very productive short term</p>
<p>and very destructive long term.</p>
<p>Also, the question is how many disasters we avoided</p>
<p>because of the ingenuity of humans</p>
<p>or just the integrity and character of humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of an open question.</p>
<p>We may be more intelligent than lucky.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hope.</p>
<p>Because the optimistic message here that you&rsquo;re getting at</p>
<p>is maybe the process that we should be,</p>
<p>that maybe we can overcome luck with ingenuity.</p>
<p>Meaning, I guess you&rsquo;re suggesting the processes</p>
<p>we should be listing all the ways</p>
<p>that human civilization can destroy itself,</p>
<p>assigning likelihood to it,</p>
<p>and thinking through how can we avoid that.</p>
<p>And being very honest with the data out there</p>
<p>about the close calls and using those close calls</p>
<p>to then create sort of mechanism</p>
<p>by which we minimize the probability of those close calls.</p>
<p>And just being honest and transparent</p>
<p>with the data that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Well, I think we need to do a couple things for it to work.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been an advocate for the idea</p>
<p>that sustainability is actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to operationalize,</p>
<p>but it is an objective that we have to meet</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re to be around long term.</p>
<p>And I realized that we also need to have reversibility</p>
<p>of all of our processes.</p>
<p>Because processes very frequently when they start</p>
<p>do not appear dangerous.</p>
<p>And then when they scale, they become very dangerous.</p>
<p>So for example, if you imagine</p>
<p>the first internal combustion engine vehicle</p>
<p>driving down the street,</p>
<p>and you imagine somebody running after them saying,</p>
<p>hey, if you do enough of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna alter the atmosphere</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna change the temperature of the planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s preposterous, right?</p>
<p>Why would you stop the person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s invented this marvelous new contraption?</p>
<p>But of course, eventually you do get to the place</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re doing enough of this</p>
<p>that you do start changing the temperature of the planet.</p>
<p>So if we built the capacity,</p>
<p>if we basically said, look, you can&rsquo;t involve yourself</p>
<p>in any process that you couldn&rsquo;t reverse if you had to,</p>
<p>then progress would be slowed,</p>
<p>but our safety would go up dramatically.</p>
<p>And I think in some sense, if we are to be around long term,</p>
<p>we have to begin thinking that way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just involved in too many very dangerous processes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about one of the things</p>
<p>that if not threatened human civilization</p>
<p>certainly hurt it at a deep level, which is COVID 19.</p>
<p>What percent probability would you currently place</p>
<p>on the hypothesis that COVID 19 leaked</p>
<p>from the Wuhan Institute of Virology?</p>
<p>So I maintain a flow chart of all the possible explanations,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t break down exactly that way.</p>
<p>The likelihood that it emerged from a lab is very, very high.</p>
<p>If it emerged from a lab,</p>
<p>the likelihood that the lab was the Wuhan Institute</p>
<p>is very, very high.</p>
<p>There are multiple different kinds of evidence</p>
<p>that point to the lab,</p>
<p>and there is literally no evidence that points to nature.</p>
<p>Either the evidence points nowhere or it points to the lab,</p>
<p>and the lab could mean any lab,</p>
<p>but geographically, obviously,</p>
<p>the labs in Wuhan are the most likely,</p>
<p>and the lab that was most directly involved</p>
<p>with research on viruses that look like COVID,</p>
<p>that look like SARS COVID 2,</p>
<p>is obviously the place that one would start.</p>
<p>But I would say the likelihood that this virus</p>
<p>came from a lab is well above 95%.</p>
<p>We can talk about the question of could a virus</p>
<p>have been brought into the lab and escaped from there</p>
<p>without being modified.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also possible,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t explain any of the anomalies</p>
<p>in the genome of SARS COVID 2.</p>
<p>Could it have been delivered from another lab?</p>
<p>Could Wuhan be a distraction</p>
<p>in order that we would connect the dots in the wrong way?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s conceivable.</p>
<p>I currently have that below 1% on my flowchart,</p>
<p>but I think&hellip;</p>
<p>A very dark thought that somebody would do that</p>
<p>almost as a political attack on China.</p>
<p>Well, it depends.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think that&rsquo;s one possibility.</p>
<p>Sometimes when Eric and I talk about these issues,</p>
<p>we will generate a scenario just to prove</p>
<p>that something could live in that space, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a placeholder for whatever may actually have happened.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t have to have been an attack on China.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly one possibility.</p>
<p>But I would point out,</p>
<p>if you can predict the future in some unusual way</p>
<p>better than others, you can print money, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what markets that allow you to bet for</p>
<p>or against virtually any sector allow you to do.</p>
<p>So you can imagine a simply amoral person</p>
<p>or entity generating a pandemic,</p>
<p>attempting to cover their tracks</p>
<p>because it would allow them to bet against things</p>
<p>like cruise ships, air travel, whatever it is,</p>
<p>and bet in favor of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>sanitizing gel and whatever else you would do.</p>
<p>So am I saying that I think somebody did that?</p>
<p>No, I really don&rsquo;t think it happened.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen zero evidence</p>
<p>that this was intentionally released.</p>
<p>However, were it to have been intentionally released</p>
<p>by somebody who did not know,</p>
<p>did not want it known where it had come from,</p>
<p>releasing it into Wuhan would be one way</p>
<p>to cover their tracks.</p>
<p>So we have to leave the possibility formally open,</p>
<p>but acknowledge there&rsquo;s no evidence.</p>
<p>And the probability therefore is low.</p>
<p>I tend to believe maybe this is the optimistic nature</p>
<p>that I have that people who are competent enough</p>
<p>to do the kind of thing we just described</p>
<p>are not going to do that</p>
<p>because it requires a certain kind of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna use the word evil,</p>
<p>but whatever word you wanna use to describe</p>
<p>the kind of disregard for human life required to do that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just not going to be coupled with competence.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a trade off chart</p>
<p>where competence on one axis and evil is on the other.</p>
<p>And the more evil you become,</p>
<p>the crappier you are at doing great engineering,</p>
<p>scientific work required to deliver weapons</p>
<p>of different kinds, whether it&rsquo;s bioweapons</p>
<p>or nuclear weapons, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That seems to be the lessons I take from history,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to be happening in the future.</p>
<p>But to stick on the lab leak idea,</p>
<p>because the flow chart is probably huge here</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating possibilities.</p>
<p>One question I wanna ask is,</p>
<p>what would evidence for natural origins look like?</p>
<p>So one piece of evidence for natural origins</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s happened in the past</p>
<p>that viruses have jumped.</p>
<p>Oh, they do jump.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s possible to have happened.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a sort of like a historical evidence,</p>
<p>like, okay, well, it&rsquo;s possible that it have&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not evidence of the kind you think it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a justification for a presumption, right?</p>
<p>So the presumption upon discovering</p>
<p>a new virus circulating is certainly</p>
<p>that it came from nature, right?</p>
<p>The problem is the presumption evaporates</p>
<p>in the face of evidence, or at least it logically should.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t in this case.</p>
<p>It was maintained by people who privately</p>
<p>in their emails acknowledged that they had grave doubts</p>
<p>about the natural origin of this virus.</p>
<p>Is there some other piece of evidence</p>
<p>that we could look for and see that would say,</p>
<p>this increases the probability that it&rsquo;s natural origins?</p>
<p>Yeah, in fact, there is evidence.</p>
<p>I always worry that somebody is going to make up</p>
<p>some evidence in order to reverse the flow.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say I am&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of incentive for that actually.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of incentive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, why didn&rsquo;t the powers that be,</p>
<p>the powers that lied to us about weapons</p>
<p>of mass destruction in Iraq,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t they ever fake weapons</p>
<p>of mass destruction in Iraq?</p>
<p>Whatever force it is, I hope that force is here too.</p>
<p>And so whatever evidence we find is real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the competence thing I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>but okay, go ahead, sorry.</p>
<p>Well, we can get back to that.</p>
<p>But I would say, yeah, the giant piece of evidence</p>
<p>that will shift the probabilities in the other direction</p>
<p>is the discovery of either a human population</p>
<p>in which the virus circulated prior to showing up in Wuhan</p>
<p>that would explain where the virus learned all of the tricks</p>
<p>that it knew instantly upon spreading from Wuhan.</p>
<p>So that would do it, or an animal population</p>
<p>in which an ancestor epidemic can be found</p>
<p>in which the virus learned this before jumping to humans.</p>
<p>But I point out in that second case,</p>
<p>you would certainly expect to see a great deal of evolution</p>
<p>in the early epidemic, which we don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>So there almost has to be a human population</p>
<p>somewhere else that had the virus circulate</p>
<p>or an ancestor of the virus that we first saw</p>
<p>in Wuhan circulating.</p>
<p>And it has to have gotten very sophisticated</p>
<p>in that prior epidemic before hitting Wuhan</p>
<p>in order to explain the total lack of evolution</p>
<p>and extremely effective virus that emerged</p>
<p>at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t believe in the magic of evolution</p>
<p>to spring up with all the tricks already there?</p>
<p>Like everybody who doesn&rsquo;t have the tricks,</p>
<p>they die quickly.</p>
<p>And then you just have this beautiful virus</p>
<p>that comes in with a spike protein</p>
<p>and through mutation and selection,</p>
<p>just like the ones that succeed and succeed big</p>
<p>are the ones that are going to just spring into life</p>
<p>with the tricks.</p>
<p>Well, no, that&rsquo;s called a hopeful monster.</p>
<p>And hopeful monsters don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The job of becoming a new pandemic virus is too difficult.</p>
<p>It involves two very difficult steps</p>
<p>and they both have to work.</p>
<p>One is the ability to infect a person and spread</p>
<p>in their tissues sufficient to make an infection.</p>
<p>And the other is to jump between individuals</p>
<p>at a sufficient rate that it doesn&rsquo;t go extinct</p>
<p>for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Those are both very difficult jobs.</p>
<p>They require, as you describe, selection.</p>
<p>And the point is selection would leave a mark.</p>
<p>We would see evidence that it would stay.</p>
<p>In animals or humans, we would see.</p>
<p>Both, right?</p>
<p>And we see this evolutionary trace of the virus</p>
<p>gathering the tricks up.</p>
<p>Yeah, you would see the virus,</p>
<p>you would see the clumsy virus get better and better.</p>
<p>And yes, I am a full believer in the power of that process.</p>
<p>In fact, I believe it.</p>
<p>What I know from studying the process</p>
<p>is that it is much more powerful than most people imagine.</p>
<p>That what we teach in the Evolution 101 textbook</p>
<p>is too clumsy a process to do what we see it doing</p>
<p>and that actually people should increase their expectation</p>
<p>of the rapidity with which that process can produce</p>
<p>just jaw dropping adaptations.</p>
<p>That said, we just don&rsquo;t see evidence that it happened here</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>but it means in spite of immense pressure</p>
<p>to find it somewhere, there&rsquo;s been no hint</p>
<p>which probably means it took place inside of a laboratory.</p>
<p>So inside the laboratory,</p>
<p>gain of function research on viruses.</p>
<p>And I believe most of that kind of research</p>
<p>is doing this exact thing that you&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>which is accelerated evolution</p>
<p>and just watching evolution do its thing</p>
<p>and a bunch of viruses</p>
<p>and seeing what kind of tricks get developed.</p>
<p>The other method is engineering viruses.</p>
<p>So manually adding on the tricks.</p>
<p>Which do you think we should be thinking about here?</p>
<p>So mind you, I learned what I know</p>
<p>in the aftermath of this pandemic emerging.</p>
<p>I started studying the question and I would say</p>
<p>based on the content of the genome and other evidence</p>
<p>in publications from the various labs</p>
<p>that were involved in generating this technology,</p>
<p>a couple of things seem likely.</p>
<p>This SARS CoV2 does not appear to be entirely the result</p>
<p>of either a splicing process or serial passaging.</p>
<p>It appears to have both things in its past</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s at least highly likely that it does.</p>
<p>So for example, the fern cleavage site</p>
<p>looks very much like it was added in to the virus</p>
<p>and it was known that that would increase its infectivity</p>
<p>in humans and increase its tropism.</p>
<p>The virus appears to be excellent</p>
<p>at spreading in humans and minks and ferrets.</p>
<p>Now minks and ferrets are very closely related to each other</p>
<p>and ferrets are very likely to have been used</p>
<p>in a serial passage experiment.</p>
<p>The reason being that they have an ACE2 receptor</p>
<p>that looks very much like the human ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>And so were you going to passage the virus</p>
<p>or its ancestor through an animal</p>
<p>in order to increase its infectivity in humans,</p>
<p>which would have been necessary,</p>
<p>ferrets would have been very likely.</p>
<p>It is also quite likely</p>
<p>that humanized mice were utilized</p>
<p>and it is possible that human airway tissue was utilized.</p>
<p>I think it is vital that we find out</p>
<p>what the protocols were.</p>
<p>If this came from the Wuhan Institute,</p>
<p>we need to know it</p>
<p>and we need to know what the protocols were exactly</p>
<p>because they will actually give us some tools</p>
<p>that would be useful in fighting SARS CoV2</p>
<p>and hopefully driving it to extinction,</p>
<p>which ought to be our priority.</p>
<p>It is a priority that does not,</p>
<p>it is not apparent from our behavior,</p>
<p>but it really is, it should be our objective.</p>
<p>If we understood where our interests lie,</p>
<p>we would be much more focused on it.</p>
<p>But those protocols would tell us a great deal.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t the Wuhan Institute, we need to know that.</p>
<p>If it was nature, we need to know that.</p>
<p>And if it was some other laboratory,</p>
<p>we need to figure out what and where</p>
<p>so that we can determine what we can determine</p>
<p>about what was done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re opening up my mind about why we should investigate,</p>
<p>why we should know the truth of the origins of this virus.</p>
<p>So for me personally,</p>
<p>let me just tell the story of my own kind of journey.</p>
<p>When I first started looking into the lab leak hypothesis,</p>
<p>what became terrifying to me</p>
<p>and important to understand and obvious</p>
<p>is the sort of like Sam Harris way of thinking,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s obvious that a lab leak of a deadly virus</p>
<p>will eventually happen.</p>
<p>My mind was, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter</p>
<p>if it happened in this case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that it&rsquo;s going to happen in the future.</p>
<p>So why the hell are we not freaking out about this?</p>
<p>And COVID 19 is not even that deadly</p>
<p>relative to the possible future viruses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this, the way I disagree with Sam on this,</p>
<p>but he thinks about this way about AGI as well,</p>
<p>not about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different discussion, I think,</p>
<p>but with viruses, it seems like something that could happen</p>
<p>on the scale of years, maybe a few decades.</p>
<p>AGI is a little bit farther out for me,</p>
<p>but it seemed, the terrifying thing,</p>
<p>it seemed obvious that this will happen very soon</p>
<p>for a much deadlier virus as we get better and better</p>
<p>at both engineering viruses</p>
<p>and doing this kind of evolutionary driven research,</p>
<p>gain of function research.</p>
<p>Okay, but then you started speaking out about this as well,</p>
<p>but also started to say, no, no, no,</p>
<p>we should hurry up and figure out the origins now</p>
<p>because it will help us figure out</p>
<p>how to actually respond to this particular virus,</p>
<p>how to treat this particular virus.</p>
<p>What is in terms of vaccines, in terms of antiviral drugs,</p>
<p>in terms of just all the number of responses</p>
<p>that we should have.</p>
<p>Okay, I still am much more freaking out about the future.</p>
<p>Maybe you can break that apart a little bit.</p>
<p>Which are you most focused on now?</p>
<p>Which are you most freaking out about now</p>
<p>in terms of the importance of figuring out</p>
<p>the origins of this virus?</p>
<p>I am most freaking out about both of them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re both really important</p>
<p>and we can put bounds on this.</p>
<p>Let me say first that this is a perfect test case</p>
<p>for the theory of close calls</p>
<p>because as much as COVID is a disaster,</p>
<p>it is also a close call from which we can learn much.</p>
<p>You are absolutely right.</p>
<p>If we keep playing this game in the lab,</p>
<p>if we are not, if we are,</p>
<p>especially if we do it under pressure</p>
<p>and when we are told that a virus</p>
<p>is going to leap from nature any day</p>
<p>and that the more we know,</p>
<p>the better we&rsquo;ll be able to fight it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna create the disaster,</p>
<p>all the sooner.</p>
<p>So yes, that should be an absolute focus.</p>
<p>The fact that there were people saying</p>
<p>that this was dangerous back in 2015</p>
<p>ought to tell us something.</p>
<p>The fact that the system bypassed a ban</p>
<p>and offshored the work to China</p>
<p>ought to tell us this is not a Chinese failure.</p>
<p>This is a failure of something larger and harder to see.</p>
<p>But I also think that there&rsquo;s a clock ticking</p>
<p>with respect to SARS CoV2 and COVID,</p>
<p>the disease that it creates.</p>
<p>And that has to do with whether or not</p>
<p>we are stuck with it permanently.</p>
<p>So if you think about the cost to humanity</p>
<p>of being stuck with influenza,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an immense cost year after year.</p>
<p>And we just stop thinking about it because it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Some years you get the flu, most years you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Maybe you get the vaccine to prevent it.</p>
<p>Maybe the vaccine isn&rsquo;t particularly well targeted.</p>
<p>But imagine just simply doubling that cost.</p>
<p>Imagine we get stuck with SARS CoV2</p>
<p>and its descendants going forward</p>
<p>and that it just settles in</p>
<p>and becomes a fact of modern human life.</p>
<p>That would be a disaster, right?</p>
<p>The number of people we will ultimately lose</p>
<p>is incalculable.</p>
<p>The amount of suffering that will be caused is incalculable.</p>
<p>The loss of wellbeing and wealth, incalculable.</p>
<p>So that ought to be a very high priority,</p>
<p>driving this extinct before it becomes permanent.</p>
<p>And the ability to drive extinct goes down</p>
<p>the longer we delay effective responses.</p>
<p>To the extent that we let it have this very large canvas,</p>
<p>large numbers of people who have the disease</p>
<p>in which mutation and selection can result in adaptation</p>
<p>that we will not be able to counter</p>
<p>the greater its ability to figure out features</p>
<p>of our immune system and use them to its advantage.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m feeling the pressure of driving it extinct.</p>
<p>I believe we could have driven it extinct six months ago</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t do it because of very mundane concerns</p>
<p>among a small number of people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not alleging that they were brazen about</p>
<p>or that they were callous about deaths that would be caused.</p>
<p>I have the sense that they were working</p>
<p>from a kind of autopilot in which you,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in some kind of a corporation,</p>
<p>a pharmaceutical corporation,</p>
<p>you have a portfolio of therapies</p>
<p>that in the context of a pandemic might be very lucrative.</p>
<p>Those therapies have competitors.</p>
<p>You of course wanna position your product</p>
<p>so that it succeeds and the competitors don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, at some point through means</p>
<p>that I think those of us on the outside</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really intuit, you end up saying things</p>
<p>about competing therapies that work better</p>
<p>and much more safely than the ones you&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t true and do cause people to die</p>
<p>in large numbers.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s some kind of autopilot, at least part of it is.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a complicated coupling of the autopilot</p>
<p>of institutions, companies, governments.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also the geopolitical game theory thing</p>
<p>going on where you wanna keep secrets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Chernobyl thing where if you messed up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big incentive, I think,</p>
<p>to hide the fact that you messed up.</p>
<p>So how do we fix this?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more important to fix?</p>
<p>The autopilot, which is the response</p>
<p>that we often criticize about our institutions,</p>
<p>especially the leaders in those institutions,</p>
<p>Anthony Fauci and so on,</p>
<p>some of the members of the scientific community.</p>
<p>And the second part is the game with China</p>
<p>of hiding the information</p>
<p>in terms of on the fight between nations.</p>
<p>Well, in our live streams on Dark Horse,</p>
<p>Heather and I have been talking from the beginning</p>
<p>about the fact that although, yes,</p>
<p>what happens began in China,</p>
<p>it very much looks like a failure</p>
<p>of the international scientific community.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s frightening, but it&rsquo;s also hopeful</p>
<p>in the sense that actually if we did the right thing now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not navigating a puzzle about Chinese responsibility.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re navigating a question of collective responsibility</p>
<p>for something that has been terribly costly to all of us.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not a very happy process.</p>
<p>But as you point out, what&rsquo;s at stake</p>
<p>is in large measure at the very least</p>
<p>the strong possibility this will happen again</p>
<p>and that at some point it will be far worse.</p>
<p>So just as a person that does not learn the lessons</p>
<p>of their own errors doesn&rsquo;t get smarter</p>
<p>and they remain in danger,</p>
<p>we collectively, humanity has to say,</p>
<p>well, there sure is a lot of evidence</p>
<p>that suggests that this is a self inflicted wound.</p>
<p>When you have done something</p>
<p>that has caused a massive self inflicted wound,</p>
<p>self inflicted wound, it makes sense to dwell on it</p>
<p>exactly to the point that you have learned the lesson</p>
<p>that makes it very, very unlikely</p>
<p>that something similar will happen again.</p>
<p>I think this is a good place to kind of ask you</p>
<p>to do almost like a thought experiment</p>
<p>or to steel man the argument against the lab leak hypothesis.</p>
<p>So if you were to argue, you said 95% chance</p>
<p>that the virus leak from a lab.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of ways I think you can argue</p>
<p>that even talking about it is bad for the world.</p>
<p>So if I just put something on the table,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to say that for one,</p>
<p>it would be racism versus Chinese people</p>
<p>that talking about that it leaked from a lab,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of immediate kind of blame</p>
<p>and it can spiral down into this idea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somehow the people are responsible for the virus</p>
<p>and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Is it possible for you to come up</p>
<p>with other steel man arguments against talking</p>
<p>or against the possibility of the lab leak hypothesis?</p>
<p>Well, so I think steel manning is a tool</p>
<p>that is extremely valuable,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also possible to abuse it.</p>
<p>I think that you can only steel man a good faith argument.</p>
<p>And the problem is we now know</p>
<p>that we have not been engaged in opponents</p>
<p>who were wielding good faith arguments</p>
<p>because privately their emails reflect their own doubts.</p>
<p>And what they were doing publicly was actually a punishment,</p>
<p>a public punishment for those of us who spoke up</p>
<p>with I think the purpose of either backing us down</p>
<p>or more likely warning others</p>
<p>not to engage in the same kind of behavior.</p>
<p>And obviously for people like you and me</p>
<p>who regard science as our likely best hope</p>
<p>for navigating difficult waters,</p>
<p>shutting down people who are using those tools honorably</p>
<p>is itself dishonorable.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t feel that there&rsquo;s anything to steel man.</p>
<p>And I also think that immediately at the point</p>
<p>that the world suddenly with no new evidence on the table</p>
<p>switched gears with respect to the lab leak,</p>
<p>at the point that Nicholas Wade had published his article</p>
<p>and suddenly the world was going to admit</p>
<p>that this was at least a possibility, if not a likelihood,</p>
<p>we got to see something of the rationalization process</p>
<p>that had taken place inside the institutional world.</p>
<p>And it very definitely involved the claim</p>
<p>that what was being avoided was the targeting</p>
<p>of Chinese scientists.</p>
<p>And my point would be,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna see the targeting of anyone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to see racism of any kind.</p>
<p>On the other hand, once you create license to lie</p>
<p>in order to protect individuals when the world has a stake</p>
<p>in knowing what happened, then it is inevitable</p>
<p>that that process, that license to lie will be used</p>
<p>by the thing that captures institutions</p>
<p>for its own purposes.</p>
<p>So my sense is it may be very unfortunate</p>
<p>if the story of what happened here</p>
<p>can be used against Chinese people.</p>
<p>That would be very unfortunate.</p>
<p>And as I think I mentioned,</p>
<p>Heather and I have taken great pains to point out</p>
<p>that this doesn&rsquo;t look like a Chinese failure.</p>
<p>It looks like a failure</p>
<p>of the international scientific community.</p>
<p>So I think it is important to broadcast that message</p>
<p>along with the analysis of the evidence.</p>
<p>But no matter what happened, we have a right to know.</p>
<p>And I frankly do not take the institutional layer</p>
<p>at its word that its motivations are honorable</p>
<p>and that it was protecting good hearted scientists</p>
<p>at the expense of the world.</p>
<p>That explanation does not add up.</p>
<p>Well, this is a very interesting question about</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s ever okay to lie at the institutional layer</p>
<p>to protect the populace.</p>
<p>I think both you and I are probably on the same,</p>
<p>have the same sense that it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s an effective mechanism in the short term,</p>
<p>in the long term, it&rsquo;s going to be destructive.</p>
<p>This happened with masks.</p>
<p>This happened with other things.</p>
<p>If you look at just history pandemics,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an idea that panic is destructive</p>
<p>amongst the populace.</p>
<p>So you want to construct a narrative,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a lie or not to minimize panic.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re suggesting that almost in all cases,</p>
<p>and I think that was the lesson from the pandemic</p>
<p>in the early 20th century,</p>
<p>that lying creates distrust</p>
<p>and distrust in the institutions is ultimately destructive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your sense that lying is not okay?</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>There are obviously places where complete transparency</p>
<p>is not a good idea, right?</p>
<p>To the extent that you broadcast a technology</p>
<p>that allows one individual to hold the world hostage,</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;ve got something to be navigated.</p>
<p>But in general, I don&rsquo;t believe that the scientific system</p>
<p>should be lying to us.</p>
<p>In the case of this particular lie,</p>
<p>the idea that the wellbeing of Chinese scientists</p>
<p>outweighs the wellbeing of the world is preposterous.</p>
<p>Right, as you point out,</p>
<p>one thing that rests on this question</p>
<p>is whether we continue to do this kind of research</p>
<p>going forward.</p>
<p>And the scientists in question, all of them,</p>
<p>American, Chinese, all of them were pushing the idea</p>
<p>that the risk of a zoonotic spillover event</p>
<p>causing a major and highly destructive pandemic</p>
<p>was so great that we had to risk this.</p>
<p>Now, if they themselves have caused it,</p>
<p>and if they are wrong, as I believe they are,</p>
<p>about the likelihood of a major world pandemic</p>
<p>spilling out of nature</p>
<p>in the way that they wrote into their grant applications,</p>
<p>then the danger is the call is coming from inside the house</p>
<p>and we have to look at that.</p>
<p>And yes, whatever we have to do</p>
<p>to protect scientists from retribution, we should do,</p>
<p>but we cannot protecting them by lying to the world.</p>
<p>And even worse,</p>
<p>by demonizing people like me, like Josh Rogin,</p>
<p>like Yuri Dagan, the entire drastic group on Twitter,</p>
<p>by demonizing us for simply following the evidence</p>
<p>is to set a terrible precedent, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re demonizing people for using the scientific method</p>
<p>to evaluate evidence that is available to us in the world.</p>
<p>What a terrible crime it is to teach that lesson, right?</p>
<p>Thou shalt not use scientific tools.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Whatever your license to lie is, it doesn&rsquo;t extend to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen the attacks on you,</p>
<p>the pressure on you has a very important effect</p>
<p>on thousands of world class biologists actually.</p>
<p>At MIT, colleagues of mine, people I know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a slight pressure to not be allowed</p>
<p>to one, speak publicly and two, actually think.</p>
<p>Like do you even think about these ideas?</p>
<p>It sounds kind of ridiculous,</p>
<p>but just in the privacy of your own home,</p>
<p>to read things, to think, it&rsquo;s many people,</p>
<p>many world class biologists that I know</p>
<p>will just avoid looking at the data.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not even that many people</p>
<p>that are publicly opposing gain of function research.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also like, it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not worth the battle.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many people that kind of argue</p>
<p>that those battles should be fought in private,</p>
<p>with colleagues in the privacy of the scientific community</p>
<p>that the public is somehow not maybe intelligent enough</p>
<p>to be able to deal with the complexities</p>
<p>of this kind of discussion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but the final result</p>
<p>is combined with the bullying of you</p>
<p>and all the different pressures</p>
<p>in the academic institutions is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just people are self censoring</p>
<p>and silencing themselves</p>
<p>and silencing the most important thing,</p>
<p>which is the power of their brains.</p>
<p>Like these people are brilliant.</p>
<p>And the fact that they&rsquo;re not utilizing their brain</p>
<p>to come up with solutions</p>
<p>outside of the conformist line of thinking is tragic.</p>
<p>Well, it is.</p>
<p>I also think that we have to look at it</p>
<p>and understand it for what it is.</p>
<p>For one thing, it&rsquo;s kind of a cryptic totalitarianism.</p>
<p>Somehow people&rsquo;s sense of what they&rsquo;re allowed</p>
<p>to think about, talk about, discuss</p>
<p>is causing them to self censor.</p>
<p>And I can tell you it&rsquo;s causing many of them to rationalize,</p>
<p>which is even worse.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re blinding themselves to what they can see.</p>
<p>But it is also the case, I believe,</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re describing about what people said,</p>
<p>and a great many people understood</p>
<p>that the lab leak hypothesis</p>
<p>could not be taken off the table,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t say so publicly.</p>
<p>And I think that their discussions with each other</p>
<p>about why they did not say what they understood,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what capture sounds like on the inside.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what force captured the institutions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody knows for sure out here in public.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know that it wasn&rsquo;t just simply a process.</p>
<p>But you have these institutions.</p>
<p>They are behaving towards a kind of somatic obligation.</p>
<p>They have lost sight of what they were built to accomplish.</p>
<p>And on the inside, the way they avoid</p>
<p>going back to their original mission</p>
<p>is to say things to themselves,</p>
<p>like the public can&rsquo;t have this discussion.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be trusted with it.</p>
<p>Yes, we need to be able to talk about this,</p>
<p>but it has to be private.</p>
<p>Whatever it is they say to themselves,</p>
<p>that is what capture sounds like on the inside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a institutional rationalization mechanism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very, very deadly.</p>
<p>And at the point you go from lab leak to repurposed drugs,</p>
<p>you can see that it&rsquo;s very deadly in a very direct way.</p>
<p>Yeah, I see this in my field with things</p>
<p>like autonomous weapon systems.</p>
<p>People in AI do not talk about the use of AI</p>
<p>in weapon systems.</p>
<p>They kind of avoid the idea that AI&rsquo;s use them</p>
<p>in the military.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny, there&rsquo;s this like kind of discomfort</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, they all hurry,</p>
<p>like something scary happens and a bunch of sheep</p>
<p>kind of like run away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it looks like.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even know what to do about it.</p>
<p>And then I feel this natural pull</p>
<p>every time I bring up autonomous weapon systems</p>
<p>to go along with the sheep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a natural kind of pull towards that direction</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, what can I do as one person?</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s currently nothing destructive happening</p>
<p>with autonomous weapon systems.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in like in the early days of this race</p>
<p>that in 10, 20 years might become a real problem.</p>
<p>Now where the discussion we&rsquo;re having now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now facing the result of that in the space of viruses,</p>
<p>like for many years avoiding the conversations here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do that in the early days,</p>
<p>but I think we have to, I guess, create institutions</p>
<p>where people can stand out.</p>
<p>People can stand out and like basically be individual</p>
<p>thinkers and break out into all kinds of spaces of ideas</p>
<p>that allow us to think freely, freedom of thought.</p>
<p>And maybe that requires a decentralization of institutions.</p>
<p>Well, years ago, I came up with a concept</p>
<p>called cultivated insecurity.</p>
<p>And the idea is, let&rsquo;s just take the example</p>
<p>of the average Joe, right?</p>
<p>The average Joe has a job somewhere</p>
<p>and their mortgage, their medical insurance,</p>
<p>their retirement, their connection with the economy</p>
<p>is to one degree or another dependent</p>
<p>on their relationship with the employer.</p>
<p>That means that there is a strong incentive,</p>
<p>especially in any industry where it&rsquo;s not easy to move</p>
<p>from one employer to the next.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strong incentive to stay</p>
<p>in your employer&rsquo;s good graces, right?</p>
<p>So it creates a very top down dynamic,</p>
<p>not only in terms of who gets to tell other people</p>
<p>what to do, but it really comes down to</p>
<p>who gets to tell other people how to think.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>The way out of it is to cultivate security</p>
<p>to the extent that somebody is in a position</p>
<p>to go against the grain and have it not be a catastrophe</p>
<p>for their family and their ability to earn,</p>
<p>you will see that behavior a lot more.</p>
<p>So I would argue that some of what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is just a simple predictable consequence</p>
<p>of the concentration of the sources of wellbeing</p>
<p>and that this is a solvable problem.</p>
<p>You got a chance to talk with Joe Rogan yesterday.</p>
<p>Yes, I did.</p>
<p>And I just saw the episode was released</p>
<p>and Ivermectin is trending on Twitter.</p>
<p>Joe told me it was an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>I look forward to listening to it today.</p>
<p>Many people have probably, by the time this is released,</p>
<p>have already listened to it.</p>
<p>I think it would be interesting to discuss a postmortem.</p>
<p>How do you feel how that conversation went?</p>
<p>And maybe broadly, how do you see the story</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s unfolding of Ivermectin from the origins</p>
<p>from before COVID 19 through 2020 to today?</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed talking to Joe</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m undescribably grateful</p>
<p>that he would take the risk of such a discussion,</p>
<p>that he would, as he described it,</p>
<p>do an emergency podcast on the subject,</p>
<p>which I think that was not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>This needed to happen for various reasons</p>
<p>that he took us down the road of talking about</p>
<p>the censorship campaign against Ivermectin,</p>
<p>which I find utterly shocking</p>
<p>and talking about the drug itself.</p>
<p>And I should say we talked, we had Pierre Corey available.</p>
<p>He came on the podcast as well.</p>
<p>He is, of course, the face of the FLCCC,</p>
<p>the Frontline COVID 19 Critical Care Alliance.</p>
<p>These are doctors who have innovated ways</p>
<p>of treating COVID patients and they happened on Ivermectin</p>
<p>and have been using it.</p>
<p>And I hesitate to use the word advocating for it</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not really the role of doctors or scientists,</p>
<p>but they are advocating for it in the sense</p>
<p>that there is this pressure not to talk about</p>
<p>its effectiveness for reasons that we can go into.</p>
<p>So maybe step back and say, what is Ivermectin</p>
<p>and how much studies have been done</p>
<p>to show its effectiveness?</p>
<p>So Ivermectin is an interesting drug.</p>
<p>It was discovered in the 70s</p>
<p>by a Japanese scientist named Satoshi Omura</p>
<p>and he found it in soil near a Japanese golf course.</p>
<p>So I would just point out in passing</p>
<p>that if we were to stop self silencing</p>
<p>over the possibility that Asians will be demonized</p>
<p>over the possible lab leak in Wuhan</p>
<p>and to recognize that actually the natural course</p>
<p>of the story has a likely lab leak in China,</p>
<p>it has a unlikely hero in Japan,</p>
<p>the story is naturally not a simple one.</p>
<p>But in any case, Omura discovered this molecule.</p>
<p>He sent it to a friend who was at Merck,</p>
<p>scientist named Campbell.</p>
<p>They won a Nobel Prize for the discovery</p>
<p>of the Ivermectin molecule in 2015.</p>
<p>Its initial use was in treating parasitic infections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very effective in treating the worm</p>
<p>that causes river blindness,</p>
<p>the pathogen that causes elephantitis, scabies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very effective anti parasite drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely safe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the WHO&rsquo;s list of essential medications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe for children.</p>
<p>It has been administered something like 4 billion times</p>
<p>in the last four decades.</p>
<p>It has been given away in the millions of doses</p>
<p>by Merck in Africa.</p>
<p>People have been on it for long periods of time.</p>
<p>And in fact, one of the reasons</p>
<p>that Africa may have had less severe impacts from COVID 19</p>
<p>is that Ivermectin is widely used there to prevent parasites</p>
<p>and the drug appears to have a long lasting impact.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting molecule.</p>
<p>It was discovered some time ago apparently</p>
<p>that it has antiviral properties.</p>
<p>And so it was tested early in the COVID 19 pandemic</p>
<p>to see if it might work to treat humans with COVID.</p>
<p>It turned out to have very promising evidence</p>
<p>that it did treat humans.</p>
<p>It was tested in tissues.</p>
<p>It was tested at a very high dosage, which confuses people.</p>
<p>They think that those of us who believe</p>
<p>that Ivermectin might be useful in confronting this disease</p>
<p>are advocating those high doses, which is not the case.</p>
<p>But in any case, there have been quite a number of studies.</p>
<p>A wonderful meta analysis was finally released.</p>
<p>We had seen it in preprint version,</p>
<p>but it was finally peer reviewed and published this last week.</p>
<p>It reveals that the drug, as clinicians have been telling us,</p>
<p>those who have been using it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s highly effective at treating people with the disease,</p>
<p>especially if you get to them early.</p>
<p>And it showed an 86% effectiveness as a prophylactic</p>
<p>to prevent people from contracting COVID.</p>
<p>And that number, 86%, is high enough</p>
<p>to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction if we wished to deploy it.</p>
<p>First of all, the meta analysis,</p>
<p>is this the Ivermectin for COVID 19</p>
<p>real time meta analysis of 60 studies?</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a bunch of meta analysis there.</p>
<p>Because I was really impressed by the real time meta analysis</p>
<p>that keeps getting updated.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>The one at ivmmeta.com?</p>
<p>Well, I saw it at c19ivermeta.com.</p>
<p>No, this is not that meta analysis.</p>
<p>So that is, as you say, a living meta analysis</p>
<p>where you can watch as evidence rolls in.</p>
<p>Which is super cool, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve got some really nice graphics</p>
<p>that allow you to understand, well, what is the evidence?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s concentrated around this level of effectiveness,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>So anyway, it&rsquo;s a great site, well worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>No, this is a meta analysis.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know any of the authors but one.</p>
<p>Second author is Tess Lorry of the BIRD group.</p>
<p>BIRD being a group of analysts and doctors in Britain</p>
<p>that is playing a role similar to the FLCCC here in the US.</p>
<p>So anyway, this is a meta analysis</p>
<p>that Tess Lorry and others did</p>
<p>of all of the available evidence.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite compelling.</p>
<p>People can look for it on my Twitter.</p>
<p>I will put it up and people can find it there.</p>
<p>So what about dose here?</p>
<p>In terms of safety, what do we understand</p>
<p>about the kind of dose required</p>
<p>to have that level of effectiveness?</p>
<p>And what do we understand about the safety</p>
<p>of that kind of dose?</p>
<p>So let me just say, I&rsquo;m not a medical doctor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a biologist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on ivermectin in lieu of vaccination.</p>
<p>In terms of dosage, there is one reason for concern,</p>
<p>which is that the most effective dose for prophylaxis</p>
<p>involves something like weekly administration.</p>
<p>And because that is not a historical pattern of use</p>
<p>for the drug, it is possible</p>
<p>that there is some longterm implication</p>
<p>of being on it weekly for a long period of time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a strong indication of that.</p>
<p>The safety signal that we have over people using the drug</p>
<p>over many years and using it in high doses.</p>
<p>In fact, Dr. Corey told me yesterday</p>
<p>that there are cases in which people</p>
<p>have made calculation errors</p>
<p>and taken a massive overdose of the drug</p>
<p>and had no ill effect.</p>
<p>So anyway, there&rsquo;s lots of reasons</p>
<p>to think the drug is comparatively safe,</p>
<p>but no drug is perfectly safe.</p>
<p>And I do worry about the longterm implications</p>
<p>of taking it.</p>
<p>I also think it&rsquo;s very likely</p>
<p>that because the drug is administered</p>
<p>in a dose something like, let&rsquo;s say 15 milligrams</p>
<p>for somebody my size once a week</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve gone through the initial double dose</p>
<p>that you take 48 hours apart,</p>
<p>it is apparent that if the amount of drug in your system</p>
<p>is sufficient to be protective at the end of the week,</p>
<p>then it was probably far too high</p>
<p>at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a question about whether or not</p>
<p>you could flatten out the intake</p>
<p>so that the amount of ivermectin goes down,</p>
<p>but the protection remains.</p>
<p>I have little doubt that that would be discovered</p>
<p>if we looked for it.</p>
<p>But that said, it does seem to be quite safe,</p>
<p>highly effective at preventing COVID.</p>
<p>The 86% number is plenty high enough</p>
<p>for us to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction</p>
<p>in light of its R0 number of slightly more than two.</p>
<p>And so why we are not using it is a bit of a mystery.</p>
<p>So even if everything you said now</p>
<p>turns out to be not correct,</p>
<p>it is nevertheless obvious that it&rsquo;s sufficiently promising</p>
<p>and it always has been in order to merit rigorous</p>
<p>scientific exploration, investigation,</p>
<p>doing a lot of studies and certainly not censoring</p>
<p>the science or the discussion of it.</p>
<p>So before we talk about the various vaccines for COVID 19,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk to you about censorship.</p>
<p>Given everything you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>why did YouTube and other places</p>
<p>censor discussion of ivermectin?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a question about why they say they did it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a question about why they actually did it.</p>
<p>Now, it is worth mentioning</p>
<p>that YouTube is part of a consortium.</p>
<p>It is partnered with Twitter, Facebook, Reuters, AP,</p>
<p>Financial Times, Washington Post,</p>
<p>some other notable organizations.</p>
<p>And that this group has appointed itself</p>
<p>the arbiter of truth.</p>
<p>In effect, they have decided to control discussion</p>
<p>ostensibly to prevent the distribution of misinformation.</p>
<p>Now, how have they chosen to do that?</p>
<p>In this case, they have chosen to simply utilize</p>
<p>the recommendations of the WHO and the CDC</p>
<p>and apply them as if they are synonymous</p>
<p>with scientific truth.</p>
<p>Problem, even at their best,</p>
<p>the WHO and CDC are not scientific entities.</p>
<p>They are entities that are about public health.</p>
<p>And public health has this, whether it&rsquo;s right or not,</p>
<p>and I believe I disagree with it,</p>
<p>but it has this self assigned right to lie</p>
<p>that comes from the fact that there is game theory</p>
<p>that works against, for example,</p>
<p>a successful vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>That if everybody else takes a vaccine</p>
<p>and therefore the herd becomes immune through vaccination</p>
<p>and you decide not to take a vaccine,</p>
<p>then you benefit from the immunity of the herd</p>
<p>without having taken the risk.</p>
<p>So people who do best are the people who opt out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hazard.</p>
<p>And the WHO and CDC as public health entities</p>
<p>effectively oversimplify stories in order to make sense</p>
<p>of oversimplify stories in order that that game theory</p>
<p>does not cause a predictable tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>With that said, once that right to lie exists,</p>
<p>then it turns out to serve the interests of,</p>
<p>for example, pharmaceutical companies,</p>
<p>which have emergency use authorizations</p>
<p>that require that there not be a safe</p>
<p>and effective treatment and have immunity from liability</p>
<p>for harms caused by their product.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a recipe for disaster, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be a sophisticated thinker</p>
<p>about complex systems to see the hazard</p>
<p>of immunizing a company from the harm of its own product</p>
<p>at the same time that that product can only exist</p>
<p>in the market if some other product that works better</p>
<p>somehow fails to be noticed.</p>
<p>So somehow YouTube is doing the bidding of Merck and others.</p>
<p>Whether it knows that that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I think this may be another case of an autopilot</p>
<p>that thinks it&rsquo;s doing the right thing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s parroting the corrupt wisdom</p>
<p>of the WHO and the CDC,</p>
<p>but the WHO and the CDC have been wrong again and again</p>
<p>in this pandemic.</p>
<p>And the irony here is that with YouTube coming after me,</p>
<p>well, my channel has been right where the WHO and CDC</p>
<p>have been wrong consistently over the whole pandemic.</p>
<p>So how is it that YouTube is censoring us</p>
<p>because the WHO and CDC disagree with us</p>
<p>when in fact, in past disagreements,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been right and they&rsquo;ve been wrong?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much to talk about here.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve heard this many times actually</p>
<p>on the inside of YouTube and with colleagues</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked with is they kind of in a very casual way</p>
<p>say their job is simply to slow</p>
<p>or prevent the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>And they say like, that&rsquo;s an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>Like to know what is true or not is an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>And so from the YouTube perspective,</p>
<p>I think they basically outsource of the task</p>
<p>of knowing what is true or not to public institutions</p>
<p>that on a basic Google search claim</p>
<p>to be the arbiters of truth.</p>
<p>So if you were YouTube who are exceptionally profitable</p>
<p>and exceptionally powerful in terms of controlling</p>
<p>what people get to see or not, what would you do?</p>
<p>Would you take a stand, a public stand</p>
<p>against the WHO, CDC?</p>
<p>Or would you instead say, you know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s open the dam and let any video on anything fly.</p>
<p>What do you do here?</p>
<p>Say you were put, if Brent Weinstein was put in charge</p>
<p>of YouTube for a month in this most critical of times</p>
<p>where YouTube actually has incredible amounts of power</p>
<p>to educate the populace, to give power of knowledge</p>
<p>to the populace such that they can reform institutions.</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>How would you run YouTube?</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, or fortunately,</p>
<p>this is actually quite simple.</p>
<p>The founders, the American founders,</p>
<p>settled on a counterintuitive formulation</p>
<p>that people should be free to say anything.</p>
<p>They should be free from the government</p>
<p>blocking them from doing so.</p>
<p>They did not imagine that in formulating that right,</p>
<p>that most of what was said would be of high quality,</p>
<p>nor did they imagine it would be free of harmful things.</p>
<p>What they correctly reasoned was that the benefit</p>
<p>of leaving everything so it can be said exceeds the cost,</p>
<p>which everyone understands to be substantial.</p>
<p>What I would say is they could not have anticipated</p>
<p>the impact, the centrality of platforms</p>
<p>like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, et cetera.</p>
<p>If they had, they would not have limited</p>
<p>the First Amendment as they did.</p>
<p>They clearly understood that the power of the federal</p>
<p>government was so great that it needed to be limited</p>
<p>by granting explicitly the right of citizens</p>
<p>to say anything.</p>
<p>In fact, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook may be more powerful</p>
<p>in this moment than the federal government</p>
<p>of their worst nightmares could have been.</p>
<p>The power that these entities have to control thought</p>
<p>and to shift civilization is so great</p>
<p>that we need to have those same protections.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that harmful things won&rsquo;t be said,</p>
<p>but it means that nothing has changed</p>
<p>about the cost benefit analysis</p>
<p>of building the right to censor.</p>
<p>So if I were running YouTube,</p>
<p>the limit of what should be allowed</p>
<p>is the limit of the law, right?</p>
<p>If what you are doing is legal,</p>
<p>then it should not be YouTube&rsquo;s place</p>
<p>to limit what gets said or who gets to hear it.</p>
<p>That is between speakers and audience.</p>
<p>Will harm come from that? Of course it will.</p>
<p>But will net harm come from it?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t believe it will.</p>
<p>I believe that allowing everything to be said</p>
<p>does allow a process in which better ideas</p>
<p>do come to the fore and win out.</p>
<p>So you believe that in the end,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s complete freedom to share ideas,</p>
<p>that truth will win out.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve noticed, just as a brief side comment,</p>
<p>that certain things become viral</p>
<p>irregardless of their truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that things that are dramatic and or funny,</p>
<p>like things that become memes are not,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to be grounded in truth.</p>
<p>And so that what worries me there</p>
<p>is that we basically maximize for drama</p>
<p>versus maximize for truth in a system</p>
<p>where everything is free.</p>
<p>And that is worrying in the time of emergency.</p>
<p>Well, yes, it&rsquo;s all worrying in time of emergency,</p>
<p>to be sure.</p>
<p>But I want you to notice that what you&rsquo;ve happened on</p>
<p>is actually an analog for a much deeper and older problem.</p>
<p>Human beings are the, we are not a blank slate,</p>
<p>but we are the blankest slate that nature has ever devised.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason for that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where our flexibility comes from.</p>
<p>We have effectively, we are robots</p>
<p>in which a large fraction of the cognitive capacity</p>
<p>has been, or of the behavioral capacity,</p>
<p>has been offloaded to the software layer,</p>
<p>which gets written and rewritten over evolutionary time.</p>
<p>That means effectively that much of what we are,</p>
<p>in fact, the important part of what we are</p>
<p>is housed in the cultural layer and the conscious layer</p>
<p>and not in the hardware hard coding layer.</p>
<p>So that layer is prone to make errors, right?</p>
<p>And anybody who&rsquo;s watched a child grow up</p>
<p>knows that children make absurd errors all the time, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the process, as we were discussing earlier.</p>
<p>It is also true that as you look across</p>
<p>a field of people discussing things,</p>
<p>a lot of what is said is pure nonsense, it&rsquo;s garbage.</p>
<p>But the tendency of garbage to emerge</p>
<p>and even to spread in the short term</p>
<p>does not say that over the long term,</p>
<p>what sticks is not the valuable ideas.</p>
<p>So there is a high tendency for novelty</p>
<p>to be created in the cultural space,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a high tendency for it to go extinct.</p>
<p>And you have to keep that in mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the genome, right?</p>
<p>Everything is happening at a much higher rate.</p>
<p>Things are being created, they&rsquo;re being destroyed.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t say that, I mean, obviously,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen totalitarianism arise many times,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very destructive each time it does.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like, hey, freedom to come up</p>
<p>with any idea you want hasn&rsquo;t produced a whole lot of carnage.</p>
<p>But the question is, over time,</p>
<p>does it produce more open, fairer, more decent societies?</p>
<p>And I believe that it does.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t prove it, but that does seem to be the pattern.</p>
<p>I believe so as well.</p>
<p>The thing is, in the short term, freedom of speech,</p>
<p>absolute freedom of speech can be quite destructive.</p>
<p>But you nevertheless have to hold on to that,</p>
<p>because in the long term, I think you and I, I guess,</p>
<p>are optimistic in the sense that good ideas will win out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how strongly I believe that it will work,</p>
<p>but I will say I haven&rsquo;t heard a better idea.</p>
<p>I would also point out that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>very significant in this question of the hubris involved</p>
<p>in imagining that you&rsquo;re going to improve the discussion</p>
<p>by censoring, which is the majority of concepts</p>
<p>at the fringe are nonsense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s automatic.</p>
<p>But the heterodoxy at the fringe,</p>
<p>which is indistinguishable at the beginning</p>
<p>from the nonsense ideas, is the key to progress.</p>
<p>So if you decide, hey, the fringe is 99% garbage,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just get rid of it, right?</p>
<p>Hey, that&rsquo;s a strong win.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting rid of 99% garbage for 1% something or other.</p>
<p>And the point is, yeah, but that 1% something or other</p>
<p>is the key.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re throwing out the key.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what YouTube is doing.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think at the point that it started censoring</p>
<p>my channel, in the immediate aftermath</p>
<p>of this major reversal over LabLeak,</p>
<p>it should have looked at itself and said,</p>
<p>well, what the hell are we doing?</p>
<p>Who are we censoring?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re censoring somebody who was just right, right?</p>
<p>In a conflict with the very same people</p>
<p>on whose behalf we are now censoring, right?</p>
<p>That should have caused them to wake up.</p>
<p>So you said one approach, if you&rsquo;re on YouTube,</p>
<p>is this basically let all videos go</p>
<p>that do not violate the law.</p>
<p>Well, I should fix that, okay?</p>
<p>I believe that that is the basic principle.</p>
<p>Eric makes an excellent point about the distinction</p>
<p>between ideas and personal attacks,</p>
<p>doxxing, these other things.</p>
<p>So I agree, there&rsquo;s no value in allowing people</p>
<p>to destroy each other&rsquo;s lives,</p>
<p>even if there&rsquo;s a technical legal defense for it.</p>
<p>Now, how you draw that line, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m talking about is,</p>
<p>yes, people should be free to traffic in bad ideas,</p>
<p>and they should be free to expose that the ideas are bad.</p>
<p>And hopefully that process results</p>
<p>in better ideas winning out.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an interesting line between ideas,</p>
<p>like the earth is flat,</p>
<p>which I believe you should not censor.</p>
<p>And then you start to encroach on personal attacks.</p>
<p>So not doxxing, yes, but not even getting to that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain point where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s no longer ideas, that&rsquo;s more,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somehow not productive, even if it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>It feels like believing the earth is flat</p>
<p>is somehow productive,</p>
<p>because maybe there&rsquo;s a tiny percent chance it is.</p>
<p>It just feels like personal attacks, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m torn on this</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s assholes in this world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fraudulent people in this world.</p>
<p>So sometimes personal attacks are useful to reveal that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a line you can cross.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a comedy where people make fun of others.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s amazing, that&rsquo;s very powerful,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very useful, even if it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s like, once it gets to be,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s a certain line,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a gray area where you cross,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s no longer in any possible world productive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really weird gray area</p>
<p>for YouTube to operate in.</p>
<p>And that feels like it should be a crowdsource thing,</p>
<p>where people vote on it.</p>
<p>But then again, do you trust the majority to vote</p>
<p>on what is crossing the line and not?</p>
<p>I mean, this is where,</p>
<p>this is really interesting on this particular,</p>
<p>like the scientific aspect of this.</p>
<p>Do you think YouTube should take more of a stance,</p>
<p>not censoring, but to actually have scientists</p>
<p>within YouTube having these kinds of discussions,</p>
<p>and then be able to almost speak out in a transparent way,</p>
<p>this is what we&rsquo;re going to let this video stand,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s all these other opinions.</p>
<p>Almost like take a more active role</p>
<p>in its recommendation system,</p>
<p>in trying to present a full picture to you.</p>
<p>Right now they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>the recommender systems are not human fine tuned.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all based on how you click,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this clustering algorithms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not taking an active role</p>
<p>on giving you the full spectrum of ideas</p>
<p>in the space of science.</p>
<p>They just censor or not.</p>
<p>Well, at the moment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be pretty hard to compel me</p>
<p>that these people should be trusted</p>
<p>with any sort of curation or comment</p>
<p>on matters of evidence,</p>
<p>because they have demonstrated</p>
<p>that they are incapable of doing it well.</p>
<p>You could make such an argument,</p>
<p>and I guess I&rsquo;m open to the idea of institutions</p>
<p>that would look something like YouTube,</p>
<p>that would be capable of offering something valuable.</p>
<p>I mean, and even just the fact of them</p>
<p>literally curating things and putting some videos</p>
<p>next to others implies something.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s a question to be answered,</p>
<p>but at the moment, no.</p>
<p>At the moment, what it is doing</p>
<p>is quite literally putting not only individual humans</p>
<p>in tremendous jeopardy by censoring discussion</p>
<p>of useful tools and making tools that are more hazardous</p>
<p>than has been acknowledged seem safe, right?</p>
<p>But it is also placing humanity in danger</p>
<p>of a permanent relationship with this pathogen.</p>
<p>I cannot emphasize enough how expensive that is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s effectively incalculable.</p>
<p>If the relationship becomes permanent,</p>
<p>the number of people who will ultimately suffer</p>
<p>and die from it is indefinitely large.</p>
<p>Yeah, currently the algorithm is very rabbit hole driven,</p>
<p>meaning if you click on Flat Earth videos,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re going to be presented with</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not going to be nicely presented</p>
<p>with arguments against the Flat Earth.</p>
<p>And the flip side of that,</p>
<p>if you watch like quantum mechanics videos</p>
<p>or no, general relativity videos,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very rare you&rsquo;re going to get a recommendation.</p>
<p>Have you considered the Earth is flat?</p>
<p>And I think you should have both.</p>
<p>Same with vaccine.</p>
<p>Videos that present the power and the incredible</p>
<p>like biology, genetics, virology about the vaccine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re rarely going to get videos</p>
<p>from well respected scientific minds</p>
<p>presenting possible dangers of the vaccine.</p>
<p>And the vice versa is true as well,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re looking at the dangers of the vaccine</p>
<p>on YouTube, you&rsquo;re not going to get the highest quality</p>
<p>of videos recommended to you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about like manually inserted CDC videos</p>
<p>that are like the most untrustworthy things</p>
<p>you can possibly watch about how everybody</p>
<p>should take the vaccine, it&rsquo;s the safest thing ever.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s about incredible, again, MIT colleagues of mine,</p>
<p>incredible biologists, virologists that talk about</p>
<p>the details of how the mRNA vaccines work</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think maybe this is me with the AI hat on,</p>
<p>is I think the algorithm can fix a lot of this</p>
<p>and YouTube should build better algorithms</p>
<p>and trust that to a couple of complete freedom of speech</p>
<p>to expand what people are able to think about,</p>
<p>present always varied views,</p>
<p>not balanced in some artificial way, hard coded way,</p>
<p>but balanced in a way that&rsquo;s crowdsourced.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an algorithm problem that can be solved</p>
<p>because then you can delegate it to the algorithm</p>
<p>as opposed to this hard code censorship</p>
<p>of basically creating artificial boundaries</p>
<p>on what can and can&rsquo;t be discussed,</p>
<p>instead creating a full spectrum of exploration</p>
<p>that can be done and trusting the intelligence of people</p>
<p>to do the exploration.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot there.</p>
<p>I would say we have to keep in mind</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about a publicly held company</p>
<p>with shareholders and obligations to them</p>
<p>and that that may make it impossible.</p>
<p>And I remember many years ago,</p>
<p>back in the early days of Google,</p>
<p>I remember a sense of terror at the loss of general search.</p>
<p>It used to be that Google, if you searched,</p>
<p>came up with the same thing for everyone</p>
<p>and then it got personalized and for a while</p>
<p>it was possible to turn off the personalization,</p>
<p>which was still not great</p>
<p>because if everybody else is looking</p>
<p>at a personalized search and you can tune into one</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t personalized, that doesn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>why the world is sounding the way it is.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it was at least an option.</p>
<p>And then that vanished.</p>
<p>And the problem is I think this is literally deranging us.</p>
<p>That in effect, I mean, what you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>is unthinkable.</p>
<p>It is unthinkable that in the face of a campaign</p>
<p>to vaccinate people in order to reach herd immunity</p>
<p>that YouTube would give you videos on hazards of vaccines</p>
<p>when this is, how hazardous the vaccines are</p>
<p>is an unsettled question.</p>
<p>Why is it unthinkable?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense from a company perspective.</p>
<p>If intelligent people in large amounts are open minded</p>
<p>and are thinking through the hazards</p>
<p>and the benefits of a vaccine, a company should find</p>
<p>the best videos to present what people are thinking about.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s come up with a hypothetical.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s come up with a very deadly disease</p>
<p>for which there&rsquo;s a vaccine that is very safe,</p>
<p>though not perfectly safe.</p>
<p>And we are then faced with YouTube trying to figure out</p>
<p>what to do for somebody searching on vaccine safety.</p>
<p>Suppose it is necessary in order to drive</p>
<p>the pathogen to extinction, something like smallpox,</p>
<p>that people get on board with the vaccine.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a tiny fringe of people who thinks</p>
<p>that the vaccine is a mind control agent.</p>
<p>So should YouTube direct people to the only claims</p>
<p>against this vaccine, which is that it&rsquo;s a mind control</p>
<p>agent when in fact the vaccine is very safe,</p>
<p>whatever that means.</p>
<p>If that were the actual configuration of the puzzle,</p>
<p>then YouTube would be doing active harm,</p>
<p>pointing you to this other video potentially.</p>
<p>Now, yes, I would love to live in a world where people</p>
<p>are up to the challenge of sorting that out.</p>
<p>But my basic point would be, if it&rsquo;s an evidentiary</p>
<p>question, and there is essentially no evidence</p>
<p>that the vaccine is a mind control agent,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s plenty of evidence that the vaccine is safe,</p>
<p>then while you look for this video,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna give you this one, puts it on a par, right?</p>
<p>So for the mind that&rsquo;s tracking how much thought</p>
<p>is there behind it&rsquo;s safe versus how much thought</p>
<p>is there behind it&rsquo;s a mind control agent</p>
<p>will result in artificially elevating this.</p>
<p>Now in the current case, what we&rsquo;ve seen is not this at all.</p>
<p>We have seen evidence obscured in order to create</p>
<p>a false story about safety.</p>
<p>And we saw the inverse with ivermectin.</p>
<p>We saw a campaign to portray the drug as more dangerous</p>
<p>and less effective than the evidence</p>
<p>clearly suggested it was.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about a comparable thing,</p>
<p>but I guess my point is the algorithmic solution</p>
<p>that you point to creates a problem of its own,</p>
<p>which is that it means that the way to get exposure</p>
<p>is to generate something fringy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the only thing on some fringe,</p>
<p>then suddenly YouTube would be recommending those things,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s obviously a gameable system at best.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the solution to that,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re creating a thought experiment,</p>
<p>maybe playing a little bit of a devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>I think the solution to that is not to limit the algorithm</p>
<p>in the case of the super deadly virus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for the scientists to step up</p>
<p>and become better communicators, more charismatic,</p>
<p>fight the battle of ideas, sort of create better videos.</p>
<p>Like if the virus is truly deadly,</p>
<p>you have a lot more ammunition, a lot more data,</p>
<p>a lot more material to work with</p>
<p>in terms of communicating with the public.</p>
<p>So be better at communicating and stop being,</p>
<p>you have to start trusting the intelligence of people</p>
<p>and also being transparent</p>
<p>and playing the game of the internet,</p>
<p>which is like, what is the internet hungry for, I believe?</p>
<p>Authenticity, stop looking like you&rsquo;re full of shit.</p>
<p>The scientific community,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s any flaw that I currently see,</p>
<p>especially the people that are in public office,</p>
<p>that like Anthony Fauci,</p>
<p>they look like they&rsquo;re full of shit</p>
<p>and I know they&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t they look more authentic?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re losing that game</p>
<p>and I think a lot of people observing this entire system now,</p>
<p>younger scientists are seeing this and saying,</p>
<p>okay, if I want to continue being a scientist</p>
<p>in the public eye and I want to be effective at my job,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to be a lot more authentic.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re learning the lesson,</p>
<p>this evolutionary system is working.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just a younger generation of minds coming up</p>
<p>that I think will do a much better job</p>
<p>in this battle of ideas</p>
<p>that when the much more dangerous virus comes along,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be able to be better communicators.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the hope.</p>
<p>Using the algorithm to control that is,</p>
<p>I feel like is a big problem.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to have the same problem with a deadly virus</p>
<p>as with the current virus</p>
<p>if you let YouTube draw hard lines</p>
<p>by the PR and the marketing people</p>
<p>versus the broad community of scientists.</p>
<p>Well, in some sense you&rsquo;re suggesting something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s close kin to what I was saying</p>
<p>about freedom of expression ultimately</p>
<p>provides an advantage to better ideas.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in agreement broadly speaking,</p>
<p>but I would also say there&rsquo;s probably some sort of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine the world that you propose</p>
<p>where YouTube shows you the alternative point of view.</p>
<p>That has the problem that I suggest,</p>
<p>but one thing you could do is you could give us the tools</p>
<p>to understand what we&rsquo;re looking at, right?</p>
<p>You could give us,</p>
<p>so first of all, there&rsquo;s something I think myopic,</p>
<p>solipsistic, narcissistic about an algorithm</p>
<p>that serves shareholders by showing you what you want to see</p>
<p>rather than what you need to know, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the distinction is flattering you,</p>
<p>playing to your blind spot</p>
<p>is something that algorithm will figure out,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not healthy for us all</p>
<p>to have Google playing to our blind spot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very dangerous.</p>
<p>So what I really want is analytics that allow me</p>
<p>or maybe options and analytics.</p>
<p>The options should allow me to see</p>
<p>what alternative perspectives are being explored, right?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m searching</p>
<p>and it leads me down this road, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s ivermectin, okay?</p>
<p>I find all of this evidence that ivermectin works.</p>
<p>I find all of these discussions</p>
<p>and people talk about various protocols and this and that.</p>
<p>And then I could say, all right, what is the other side?</p>
<p>And I could see who is searching, not as individuals,</p>
<p>but what demographics are searching alternatives.</p>
<p>And maybe you could even combine it</p>
<p>with something Reddit like where effectively,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that there was a position that, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that a vaccine is a mind control device</p>
<p>and you could have a steel man this argument competition</p>
<p>effectively and the better answers that steel man</p>
<p>and as well as possible would rise to the top.</p>
<p>And so you could read the top three or four explanations</p>
<p>about why this really credibly is a mind control product.</p>
<p>And you can say, well, that doesn&rsquo;t really add up.</p>
<p>I can check these three things myself</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t possibly be right, right?</p>
<p>And you could dismiss it.</p>
<p>And then as an argument that was credible,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say plate tectonics before</p>
<p>that was an accepted concept,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, wait a minute,</p>
<p>there is evidence for plate tectonics.</p>
<p>As crazy as it sounds that the continents</p>
<p>are floating around on liquid,</p>
<p>actually that&rsquo;s not so implausible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got these subduction zones,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a geology that is compatible,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got puzzle piece continents</p>
<p>that seem to fit together.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a surprising amount of evidence</p>
<p>for that position.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna file some Bayesian probability with it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s updated for the fact that actually</p>
<p>the steel man arguments better than I was expecting, right?</p>
<p>So I could imagine something like that</p>
<p>where A, I would love the search to be indifferent</p>
<p>to who&rsquo;s searching, right?</p>
<p>The solipsistic thing is too dangerous.</p>
<p>So the search could be general,</p>
<p>so we would all get a sense</p>
<p>for what everybody else was seeing too.</p>
<p>And then some layer that didn&rsquo;t have anything to do</p>
<p>with what YouTube points you to or not,</p>
<p>but allowed you to see, you know,</p>
<p>the general pattern of adherence</p>
<p>to searching for information.</p>
<p>And again, a layer in which those things could be defended.</p>
<p>So you could hear what a good argument sounded like</p>
<p>rather than just hear a caricatured argument.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also reward people,</p>
<p>creators that have demonstrated</p>
<p>like a track record of open mindedness</p>
<p>and correctness as much as it could be measured</p>
<p>over a long term and sort of,</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of this maps</p>
<p>to incentivizing good longterm behavior,</p>
<p>not immediate kind of dopamine rush kind of signals.</p>
<p>I think ultimately the algorithm on the individual level</p>
<p>should optimize for personal growth,</p>
<p>longterm happiness, just growth intellectually,</p>
<p>growth in terms of lifestyle personally and so on,</p>
<p>as opposed to immediate.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to build a better society,</p>
<p>not even just like truth,</p>
<p>because I think truth is a complicated thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more just you growing as a person,</p>
<p>exploring the space of ideas, changing your mind often,</p>
<p>increasing the level to which you&rsquo;re open minded,</p>
<p>the knowledge base you&rsquo;re operating from,</p>
<p>the willingness to empathize with others,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things the algorithm should optimize for.</p>
<p>Like creating a better human at the individual level</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re, I think that&rsquo;s a great business model</p>
<p>because the person that&rsquo;s using this tool</p>
<p>will then be happier with themselves for having used it</p>
<p>and will be a lifelong quote unquote customer.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great business model</p>
<p>to make a happy, open minded, knowledgeable,</p>
<p>better human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible business model under the current system.</p>
<p>What you want is to build the system</p>
<p>in which it is a great business model.</p>
<p>Why is it a terrible model?</p>
<p>Because it will be decimated by those</p>
<p>who play to the short term.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re living it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re living it.</p>
<p>Well, no, because if you have the alternative</p>
<p>that presents itself,</p>
<p>it points out the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>I mean, it points out that YouTube is operating in this way,</p>
<p>Twitter is operating in this way,</p>
<p>Facebook is operating in this way.</p>
<p>How long term would you like the wisdom to prove at?</p>
<p>Well, even a week is better when it&rsquo;s currently happening.</p>
<p>Right, but the problem is,</p>
<p>if a week loses out to an hour, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it loses out.</p>
<p>It loses out in the short term.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>At least you&rsquo;re a great communicator</p>
<p>and you basically say, look, here&rsquo;s the metrics.</p>
<p>And a lot of it is like how people actually feel.</p>
<p>Like this is what people experience with social media.</p>
<p>They look back at the previous month and say,</p>
<p>I felt shitty on a lot of days because of social media.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you look back at the previous few weeks and say,</p>
<p>wow, I&rsquo;m a better person because of that month happened.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, they immediately choose the product</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to lead to that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what love for products looks like.</p>
<p>If you love, like a lot of people love their Tesla car,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s, or iPhone or like beautiful design.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what love looks like.</p>
<p>You look back, I&rsquo;m a better person</p>
<p>for having used this thing.</p>
<p>Well, you got to ask yourself the question though,</p>
<p>if this is such a great business model,</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t it devolving?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we see it?</p>
<p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s competence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people are just, it&rsquo;s not easy to build new,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy to build products, tools, systems</p>
<p>on new ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a new idea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through this, everything we&rsquo;re seeing now</p>
<p>comes from the ideas of the initial birth of the internet.</p>
<p>There just needs to be new sets of tools</p>
<p>that are incentivizing long term personal growth</p>
<p>and happiness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Right, but what we have is a market</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t favor this, right?</p>
<p>I mean, for one thing, we had an alternative to Facebook,</p>
<p>right, that looked, you owned your own data,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t exploitative and Facebook bought</p>
<p>a huge interest in it and it died.</p>
<p>I mean, who do you know who&rsquo;s on diaspora?</p>
<p>The execution there was not good.</p>
<p>Right, but it could have gotten better, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the argument that why hasn&rsquo;t somebody</p>
<p>done it a good argument for it&rsquo;s not going to completely</p>
<p>destroy all of Twitter and Facebook when somebody does it</p>
<p>or Twitter will catch up and pivot to the algorithm.</p>
<p>This is not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously great ideas that remain unexplored</p>
<p>because nobody has gotten to the foothill</p>
<p>that would allow you to explore them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but you know, an internet</p>
<p>that was non predatory is an obvious idea</p>
<p>and many of us know that we want it</p>
<p>and many of us have seen prototypes of it</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t move because there&rsquo;s no audience there.</p>
<p>So the network effects cause you to stay</p>
<p>with the predatory internet.</p>
<p>But let me just, I wasn&rsquo;t kidding about build the system</p>
<p>in which your idea is a great business plan.</p>
<p>So in our upcoming book, Heather and I in our last chapter</p>
<p>explore something called the fourth frontier</p>
<p>and fourth frontier has to do with sort of a 2.0 version</p>
<p>of civilization, which we freely admit</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t tell you very much about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that would have to be,</p>
<p>we would have to prototype our way there.</p>
<p>We would have to effectively navigate our way there.</p>
<p>But the result would be very much</p>
<p>like what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>It would be something that effectively liberates humans</p>
<p>meaningfully and most importantly,</p>
<p>it has to feel like growth without depending on growth.</p>
<p>In other words, human beings are creatures</p>
<p>that like every other creature</p>
<p>is effectively looking for growth, right?</p>
<p>We are looking for underexploited</p>
<p>or unexploited opportunities and when we find them,</p>
<p>our ancestors for example, they happen into a new valley</p>
<p>that was unexplored by people.</p>
<p>Their population would grow until it hit carrying capacity.</p>
<p>So there would be this great feeling of there&rsquo;s abundance</p>
<p>until you hit carrying capacity, which is inevitable</p>
<p>and then zero sum dynamics would set in.</p>
<p>So in order for human beings to flourish longterm,</p>
<p>the way to get there is to satisfy the desire for growth</p>
<p>without hooking it to actual growth,</p>
<p>which only moves and fits and starts.</p>
<p>And this is actually, I believe the key</p>
<p>to avoiding these spasms of human tragedy</p>
<p>when in the absence of growth,</p>
<p>people do something that causes their population</p>
<p>to experience growth, which is they go and make war on</p>
<p>or commit genocide against some other population,</p>
<p>which is something we obviously have to stop.</p>
<p>By the way, this is a hunter gatherers guide</p>
<p>to the 21st century coauthored.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>With your wife, Heather, being released in September.</p>
<p>I believe you said you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>a little bit of a preview videos on each chapter</p>
<p>leading up to the release.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m looking forward to the last chapter</p>
<p>as well as all the previous ones.</p>
<p>I have a few questions on that.</p>
<p>So you generally have faith to clarify that technology</p>
<p>could be the thing that empowers this kind of future.</p>
<p>Well, if you just let technology evolve,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be our undoing, right?</p>
<p>One of the things that I fault my libertarian friends for</p>
<p>is this faith that the market is going to find solutions</p>
<p>without destroying us.</p>
<p>And my sense is I&rsquo;m a very strong believer in markets.</p>
<p>I believe in their power</p>
<p>even above some market fundamentalists.</p>
<p>But what I don&rsquo;t believe is that they should be allowed</p>
<p>to plot our course, right?</p>
<p>Markets are very good at figuring out how to do things.</p>
<p>They are not good at all about figuring out</p>
<p>what we should do, right?</p>
<p>What we should want.</p>
<p>We have to tell markets what we want</p>
<p>and then they can tell us how to do it best.</p>
<p>And if we adopted that kind of pro market</p>
<p>but in a context where it&rsquo;s not steering,</p>
<p>where human wellbeing is actually the driver,</p>
<p>we can do remarkable things.</p>
<p>And the technology that emerges</p>
<p>would naturally be enhancing of human wellbeing.</p>
<p>Perfectly so?</p>
<p>No, but overwhelmingly so.</p>
<p>But at the moment, markets are finding</p>
<p>our every defective character and exploiting them</p>
<p>and making huge profits</p>
<p>and making us worse to each other in the process.</p>
<p>Before we leave COVID 19,</p>
<p>let me ask you about a very difficult topic,</p>
<p>which is the vaccines.</p>
<p>So I took the Pfizer vaccine, the two shots.</p>
<p>You did not.</p>
<p>You have been taking ivermectin.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So one of the arguments</p>
<p>against the discussion of ivermectin</p>
<p>is that it prevents people</p>
<p>from being fully willing to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>How would you compare ivermectin</p>
<p>and the vaccine for COVID 19?</p>
<p>All right, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I would say, first of all,</p>
<p>there are some hazards with the vaccine</p>
<p>that people need to be aware of.</p>
<p>There are some things that we cannot rule out</p>
<p>and for which there is some evidence.</p>
<p>The two that I think people should be tracking</p>
<p>is the possibility, some would say a likelihood,</p>
<p>that a vaccine of this nature,</p>
<p>that is to say very narrowly focused on a single antigen,</p>
<p>is an evolutionary pressure</p>
<p>that will drive the emergence of variants</p>
<p>that will escape the protection</p>
<p>that comes from the vaccine.</p>
<p>So this is a hazard.</p>
<p>It is a particular hazard in light of the fact</p>
<p>that these vaccines have a substantial number</p>
<p>of breakthrough cases.</p>
<p>So one danger is that a person who has been vaccinated</p>
<p>will shed viruses that are specifically less visible</p>
<p>or invisible to the immunity created by the vaccines.</p>
<p>So we may be creating the next pandemic</p>
<p>by applying the pressure of vaccines</p>
<p>at a point that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to.</p>
<p>The other danger has to do with something called</p>
<p>antibody dependent enhancement,</p>
<p>which is something that we see in certain diseases</p>
<p>like dengue fever.</p>
<p>You may know that dengue, one gets a case,</p>
<p>and then their second case is much more devastating.</p>
<p>So break bone fever is when you get your second case</p>
<p>of dengue, and dengue effectively utilizes</p>
<p>the immune response that is produced by prior exposure</p>
<p>to attack the body in ways that it is incapable</p>
<p>of doing before exposure.</p>
<p>So this is apparently, this pattern has apparently blocked</p>
<p>past efforts to make vaccines against coronaviruses.</p>
<p>Whether it will happen here or not,</p>
<p>it is still too early to say.</p>
<p>But before we even get to the question</p>
<p>of harm done to individuals by these vaccines,</p>
<p>we have to ask about what the overall impact is going to be.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not clear in the way people think it is</p>
<p>that if we vaccinate enough people, the pandemic will end.</p>
<p>It could be that we vaccinate people</p>
<p>and make the pandemic worse.</p>
<p>And while nobody can say for sure</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed,</p>
<p>it is at least something to be aware of.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t vaccines usually create</p>
<p>that kind of evolutionary pressure</p>
<p>to create deadlier, different strains of the virus?</p>
<p>So is there something particular with these mRNA vaccines</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uniquely dangerous in this regard?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not even just the mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines and the adenovector DNA vaccine</p>
<p>all share the same vulnerability,</p>
<p>which is they are very narrowly focused</p>
<p>on one subunit of the spike protein.</p>
<p>So that is a very concentrated evolutionary signal.</p>
<p>We are also deploying it in mid pandemic</p>
<p>and it takes time for immunity to develop.</p>
<p>So part of the problem here,</p>
<p>if you inoculated a population before encounter</p>
<p>with a pathogen, then there might be substantially</p>
<p>enough immunity to prevent this phenomenon from happening.</p>
<p>But in this case, we are inoculating people</p>
<p>as they are encountering those who are sick with the disease.</p>
<p>And what that means is the disease is now faced</p>
<p>with a lot of opportunities</p>
<p>to effectively evolutionarily practice escape strategies.</p>
<p>So one thing is the timing,</p>
<p>the other thing is the narrow focus.</p>
<p>Now in a traditional vaccine,</p>
<p>you would typically not have one antigen, right?</p>
<p>You would have basically a virus full of antigens</p>
<p>and the immune system would therefore</p>
<p>produce a broader response.</p>
<p>So that is the case for people who have had COVID, right?</p>
<p>They have an immunity that is broader</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t so focused</p>
<p>on one part of the spike protein.</p>
<p>So anyway, there is something unique here.</p>
<p>So these platforms create that special hazard.</p>
<p>They also have components that we haven&rsquo;t used before</p>
<p>in people.</p>
<p>So for example, the lipid nanoparticles</p>
<p>that coat the RNAs are distributing themselves</p>
<p>around the body in a way that will have unknown consequences.</p>
<p>So anyway, there&rsquo;s reason for concern.</p>
<p>Is it possible for you to steel man the argument</p>
<p>that everybody should get vaccinated?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>The argument that everybody should get vaccinated</p>
<p>is that nothing is perfectly safe.</p>
<p>Phase three trials showed good safety for the vaccines.</p>
<p>Now that may or may not be actually true,</p>
<p>but what we saw suggested high degree of efficacy</p>
<p>and a high degree of safety for the vaccines</p>
<p>that inoculating people quickly</p>
<p>and therefore dropping the landscape of available victims</p>
<p>for the pathogen to a very low number</p>
<p>so that herd immunity drives it to extinction</p>
<p>requires us all to take our share of the risk</p>
<p>and that because driving it to extinction</p>
<p>should be our highest priority that really</p>
<p>people shouldn&rsquo;t think too much about the various nuances</p>
<p>because overwhelmingly fewer people will die</p>
<p>if the population is vaccinated from the vaccine</p>
<p>than will die from COVID if they&rsquo;re not vaccinated.</p>
<p>And with the vaccine as it currently is being deployed,</p>
<p>that is a quite a likely scenario</p>
<p>that everything, you know, the virus will fade away.</p>
<p>In the following sense that the probability</p>
<p>that a more dangerous strain will be created is nonzero,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not 50%, it&rsquo;s something smaller.</p>
<p>And so the most likely, well, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe you disagree with that,</p>
<p>but the scenario we&rsquo;re most likely to see now</p>
<p>that the vaccine is here is that the virus,</p>
<p>the effects of the virus will fade away.</p>
<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t believe that the probability</p>
<p>of creating a worse pandemic is low enough to discount.</p>
<p>I think the probability is fairly high</p>
<p>and frankly, we are seeing a wave of variants</p>
<p>that we will have to do a careful analysis</p>
<p>to figure out what exactly that has to do</p>
<p>with campaigns of vaccination,</p>
<p>where they have been, where they haven&rsquo;t been,</p>
<p>where the variants emerged from.</p>
<p>But I believe that what we are seeing is a disturbing pattern</p>
<p>that reflects that those who were advising caution</p>
<p>may well have been right.</p>
<p>The data here, by the way, and the small tangent is terrible.</p>
<p>Terrible, right.</p>
<p>And why is it terrible is another question, right?</p>
<p>This is where I started getting angry.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s an obvious opportunity</p>
<p>for exceptionally good data, for exceptionally rigorous,</p>
<p>like even the self, like the website for self reporting,</p>
<p>side effects for, not side effects,</p>
<p>but negative effects, right?</p>
<p>Adverse events.</p>
<p>Adverse events, sorry, for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s many things I could say</p>
<p>from both the study perspective,</p>
<p>but mostly, let me just put on my hat of like HTML</p>
<p>and like web design.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like the worst website.</p>
<p>It makes it so unpleasant to report.</p>
<p>It makes it so unclear what you&rsquo;re reporting.</p>
<p>If somebody actually has serious effect,</p>
<p>like if you have very mild effects,</p>
<p>what are the incentives for you to even use</p>
<p>that crappy website with many pages and forms</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t make any sense?</p>
<p>If you have adverse effects,</p>
<p>what are the incentives for you to use that website?</p>
<p>What is the trust that you have</p>
<p>that this information will be used well?</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And the data about who&rsquo;s getting vaccinated,</p>
<p>anonymized data about who&rsquo;s getting vaccinated,</p>
<p>where, when, with what vaccine,</p>
<p>coupled with the adverse effects,</p>
<p>all of that we should be collecting.</p>
<p>Instead, we&rsquo;re completely not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing it in a crappy way</p>
<p>and using that crappy data to make conclusions</p>
<p>that you then twist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically collecting in a way</p>
<p>that can arrive at whatever conclusions you want.</p>
<p>And the data is being collected by the institutions,</p>
<p>by governments, and so therefore,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously they&rsquo;re going to try</p>
<p>to construct any kind of narratives they want</p>
<p>based on this crappy data.</p>
<p>Reminds me of much of psychology, the field that I love,</p>
<p>but is flawed in many fundamental ways.</p>
<p>So rant over, but coupled with the dangers</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re speaking to,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have even the data to understand the dangers.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna pick up on your rant and say,</p>
<p>we, estimates of the degree of underreporting in VAERS</p>
<p>are that it is 10% of the real to 100%.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the system for reporting.</p>
<p>Yeah, the VAERS system is the system</p>
<p>for reporting adverse events.</p>
<p>So in the US, we have above 5,000 unexpected deaths</p>
<p>that seem in time to be associated with vaccination.</p>
<p>That is an undercount, almost certainly,</p>
<p>and by a large factor.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how large.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen estimates, 25,000 dead in the US alone.</p>
<p>Now, you can make the argument that, okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a large number,</p>
<p>but the necessity of immunizing the population</p>
<p>to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction</p>
<p>is such that it&rsquo;s an acceptable number.</p>
<p>But I would point out</p>
<p>that that actually does not make any sense.</p>
<p>And the reason it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>is actually there are several reasons.</p>
<p>One, if that was really your point,</p>
<p>that yes, many, many people are gonna die,</p>
<p>but many more will die if we don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>Were that your approach,</p>
<p>you would not be inoculating people who had had COVID 19,</p>
<p>which is a large population.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to expose those people to danger.</p>
<p>Their risk of adverse events</p>
<p>in the case that they have them is greater.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no reason that we would be allowing</p>
<p>those people to face a risk of death</p>
<p>if this was really about an acceptable number of deaths</p>
<p>arising out of this set of vaccines.</p>
<p>I would also point out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something incredibly bizarre.</p>
<p>And I struggle to find language that is strong enough</p>
<p>for the horror of vaccinating children in this case</p>
<p>because children suffer a greater risk of longterm effects</p>
<p>because they are going to live longer.</p>
<p>And because this is earlier in their development,</p>
<p>therefore it impacts systems that are still forming.</p>
<p>They tolerate COVID well.</p>
<p>And so the benefit to them is very small.</p>
<p>And so the only argument for doing this</p>
<p>is that they may cryptically be carrying more COVID</p>
<p>than we think, and therefore they may be integral</p>
<p>to the way the virus spreads to the population.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s the reason that we are inoculating children,</p>
<p>and there has been some revision in the last day or two</p>
<p>about the recommendation on this</p>
<p>because of the adverse events</p>
<p>that have shown up in children,</p>
<p>but to the extent that we were vaccinating children,</p>
<p>we were doing it to protect old, infirm people</p>
<p>who are the most likely to succumb to COVID 19.</p>
<p>What society puts children in danger,</p>
<p>robs children of life to save old, infirm people?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s upside down.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about the way we are going about</p>
<p>vaccinating, who we are vaccinating,</p>
<p>what dangers we are pretending don&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>that suggests that to some set of people,</p>
<p>vaccinating people is a good in and of itself,</p>
<p>that that is the objective of the exercise,</p>
<p>not herd immunity.</p>
<p>And the last thing, and I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna prevent you from jumping in here,</p>
<p>but the second reason, in addition to the fact</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re exposing people to danger</p>
<p>that we should not be exposing them to.</p>
<p>By the way, as a tiny tangent,</p>
<p>another huge part of this soup</p>
<p>that should have been part of it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an incredible solution is large scale testing.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>But that might be another couple hour conversation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s these solutions that are obvious</p>
<p>that were available from the very beginning.</p>
<p>So you could argue that iveractin is not that obvious,</p>
<p>but maybe the whole point is you have aggressive,</p>
<p>very fast research that leads to a meta analysis</p>
<p>and then large scale production and deployment.</p>
<p>Okay, at least that possibility</p>
<p>should be seriously considered,</p>
<p>coupled with a serious consideration</p>
<p>of large scale deployment of testing,</p>
<p>at home testing that could have accelerated</p>
<p>the speed at which we reached that herd immunity.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t even wanna.</p>
<p>Well, let me just say, I am also completely shocked</p>
<p>that we did not get on high quality testing early</p>
<p>and that we are still suffering from this even now,</p>
<p>because just the simple ability to track</p>
<p>where the virus moves between people</p>
<p>would tell us a lot about its mode of transmission,</p>
<p>which would allow us to protect ourselves better.</p>
<p>Instead, that information was hard won</p>
<p>and for no good reason.</p>
<p>So I also find this mysterious.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken with Eric Weinstein, your brother,</p>
<p>on his podcast, The Portal,</p>
<p>about the ideas that eventually led to the paper</p>
<p>you published titled, The Reserved Capacity Hypothesis.</p>
<p>I think first, can you explain this paper</p>
<p>and the ideas that led up to it?</p>
<p>Sure, easier to explain the conclusion of the paper.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question about why a creature</p>
<p>that can replace its cells with new cells</p>
<p>grows feeble and inefficient with age.</p>
<p>We call that process, which is otherwise called aging,</p>
<p>we call it senescence.</p>
<p>And senescence, in this paper, it is hypothesized,</p>
<p>is the unavoidable downside of a cancer prevention</p>
<p>feature of our bodies.</p>
<p>That each cell has a limit on the number of times</p>
<p>it can divide.</p>
<p>There are a few cells in the body that are exceptional,</p>
<p>but most of our cells can only divide</p>
<p>a limited number of times.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called the Hayflick limit.</p>
<p>And the Hayflick limit reduces the ability</p>
<p>of the organism to replace tissues.</p>
<p>It therefore results in a failure over time</p>
<p>of maintenance and repair.</p>
<p>And that explains why we become decrepit as we grow old.</p>
<p>The question was why would that be,</p>
<p>especially in light of the fact that the mechanism</p>
<p>that seems to limit the ability of cells to reproduce</p>
<p>is something called a telomere.</p>
<p>Telomere is a, it&rsquo;s not a gene, but it&rsquo;s a DNA sequence</p>
<p>at the ends of our chromosomes</p>
<p>that is just simply repetitive.</p>
<p>And the number of repeats functions like a counter.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a number of repeats that you have</p>
<p>after development is finished.</p>
<p>And then each time the cell divides a little bit</p>
<p>of telomere is lost.</p>
<p>And at the point that the telomere becomes critically short,</p>
<p>the cell stops dividing even though it still has</p>
<p>the capacity to do so.</p>
<p>Stops dividing and it starts transcribing different genes</p>
<p>than it did when it had more telomere.</p>
<p>So what my work did was it looked at the fact</p>
<p>that the telomeric shortening was being studied</p>
<p>by two different groups.</p>
<p>It was being studied by people who were interested</p>
<p>in counteracting the aging process.</p>
<p>And it was being studied in exactly the opposite fashion</p>
<p>by people who were interested in tumorigenesis and cancer.</p>
<p>The thought being because it was true that when one looked</p>
<p>into tumors, they always had telomerase active.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the enzyme that lengthens our telomeres.</p>
<p>So those folks were interested in bringing about a halt</p>
<p>to the lengthening of telomeres</p>
<p>in order to counteract cancer.</p>
<p>And the folks who were studying the senescence process</p>
<p>were interested in lengthening telomeres</p>
<p>in order to generate greater repair capacity.</p>
<p>And my point was evolutionarily speaking,</p>
<p>this looks like a pleiotropic effect</p>
<p>that the genes which create the tendency of the cells</p>
<p>to be limited in their capacity to replace themselves</p>
<p>are providing a benefit in youth,</p>
<p>which is that we are largely free of tumors and cancer</p>
<p>at the inevitable late life cost that we grow feeble</p>
<p>and inefficient and eventually die.</p>
<p>And that matches a very old hypothesis in evolutionary theory</p>
<p>by somebody I was fortunate enough to know, George Williams,</p>
<p>one of the great 20th century evolutionists</p>
<p>who argued that senescence would have to be caused</p>
<p>by pleiotropic genes that cause early life benefits</p>
<p>at unavoidable late life costs.</p>
<p>And although this isn&rsquo;t the exact nature of the system,</p>
<p>he predicted it matches what he was expecting</p>
<p>in many regards to a shocking degree.</p>
<p>That said, the focus of the paper is about the,</p>
<p>well, let me just read the abstract.</p>
<p>We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols designed,</p>
<p>this is the end of the abstract.</p>
<p>We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols</p>
<p>designed to increase reproductive output,</p>
<p>simultaneously exert strong selection</p>
<p>against reproductive senescence</p>
<p>and virtually eliminate selection</p>
<p>that would otherwise favor tumor suppression.</p>
<p>This appears to have greatly elongated</p>
<p>the telomeres of laboratory mice.</p>
<p>With their telomeric failsafe effectively disabled,</p>
<p>these animals are unreliable models</p>
<p>of normal senescence and tumor formation.</p>
<p>So basically using these mice is not going to lead</p>
<p>to the right kinds of conclusions.</p>
<p>Safety tests employing these animals</p>
<p>likely overestimate cancer risks</p>
<p>and underestimate tissue damage</p>
<p>and consequent accelerated senescence.</p>
<p>So I think, especially with your discussion with Eric,</p>
<p>the conclusion of this paper has to do with the fact that,</p>
<p>like we shouldn&rsquo;t be using these mice to test the safety</p>
<p>or to make conclusions about cancer or senescence.</p>
<p>Is that the basic takeaway?</p>
<p>Like basically saying that the length of these telomeres</p>
<p>is an important variable to consider.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>I think there was a reason that the world of scientists</p>
<p>who was working on telomeres</p>
<p>did not spot the pleiotropic relationship</p>
<p>that was the key argument in my paper.</p>
<p>The reason they didn&rsquo;t spot it was that there was a result</p>
<p>that everybody knew, which seemed inconsistent.</p>
<p>The result was that mice have very long telomeres,</p>
<p>but they do not have very long lives.</p>
<p>Now, we can talk about what the actual meaning</p>
<p>of don&rsquo;t have very long lives is,</p>
<p>but in the end, I was confronted with a hypothesis</p>
<p>that would explain a great many features</p>
<p>of the way mammals and indeed vertebrates age,</p>
<p>but it was inconsistent with one result.</p>
<p>And at first I thought,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s something wrong with the result.</p>
<p>Maybe this is one of these cases</p>
<p>where the result was achieved once</p>
<p>through some bad protocol and everybody else</p>
<p>was repeating it, didn&rsquo;t turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>Many laboratories had established</p>
<p>that mice had ultra long telomeres.</p>
<p>And so I began to wonder whether or not</p>
<p>there was something about the breeding protocols</p>
<p>that generated these mice.</p>
<p>And what that would predict is that the mice</p>
<p>that have long telomeres would be laboratory mice</p>
<p>and that wild mice would not.</p>
<p>And Carol Greider, who agreed to collaborate with me,</p>
<p>tested that hypothesis and showed that it was indeed true,</p>
<p>that wild derived mice, or at least mice</p>
<p>that had been in captivity for a much shorter period of time</p>
<p>did not have ultra long telomeres.</p>
<p>Now, what this implied though, as you read,</p>
<p>is that our breeding protocols</p>
<p>generate lengthening of telomeres.</p>
<p>And the implication of that is that the animals</p>
<p>that have these very long telomeres</p>
<p>will be hyper prone to create tumors.</p>
<p>They will be extremely resistant to toxins</p>
<p>because they have effectively an infinite capacity</p>
<p>to replace any damaged tissue.</p>
<p>And so ironically, if you give one of these</p>
<p>ultra long telomere lab mice a toxin,</p>
<p>if the toxin doesn&rsquo;t outright kill it,</p>
<p>it may actually increase its lifespan</p>
<p>because it functions as a kind of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>So the reason that chemotherapy works</p>
<p>is that dividing cells are more vulnerable</p>
<p>than cells that are not dividing.</p>
<p>And so if this mouse has effectively</p>
<p>had its cancer protection turned off,</p>
<p>and it has cells dividing too rapidly,</p>
<p>and you give it a toxin, you will slow down its tumors</p>
<p>faster than you harm its other tissues.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll get a paradoxical result</p>
<p>that actually some drug that&rsquo;s toxic</p>
<p>seems to benefit the mouse.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think that that was understood</p>
<p>before I published my paper.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m pretty sure it has to be.</p>
<p>And the problem is that this actually is a system</p>
<p>that serves pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p>that have the difficult job of bringing compounds to market,</p>
<p>many of which will be toxic.</p>
<p>Maybe all of them will be toxic.</p>
<p>And these mice predispose our system</p>
<p>to declare these toxic compounds safe.</p>
<p>And in fact, I believe we&rsquo;ve seen the errors</p>
<p>that result from using these mice a number of times,</p>
<p>most famously with Vioxx, which turned out</p>
<p>to do conspicuous heart damage.</p>
<p>Why do you think this paper and this idea</p>
<p>has not gotten significant traction?</p>
<p>Well, my collaborator, Carol Greider,</p>
<p>said something to me that rings in my ears to this day.</p>
<p>She initially, after she showed that laboratory mice</p>
<p>have anomalously long telomeres</p>
<p>and that wild mice don&rsquo;t have long telomeres,</p>
<p>I asked her where she was going to publish that result</p>
<p>so that I could cite it in my paper.</p>
<p>And she said that she was going to keep the result in house</p>
<p>rather than publish it.</p>
<p>And at the time, I was a young graduate student.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really understand what she was saying.</p>
<p>But in some sense, the knowledge that a model organism</p>
<p>is broken in a way that creates the likelihood</p>
<p>that certain results will be reliably generateable,</p>
<p>you can publish a paper and make a big splash</p>
<p>with such a thing, or you can exploit the fact</p>
<p>that you know how those models will misbehave</p>
<p>and other people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a question, if somebody is motivated cynically</p>
<p>and what they want to do is appear to have deeper insight</p>
<p>into biology because they predict things</p>
<p>better than others do, knowing where the flaw is</p>
<p>so that your predictions come out true is advantageous.</p>
<p>At the same time, I can&rsquo;t help but imagine</p>
<p>that the pharmaceutical industry,</p>
<p>when it figured out that the mice were predisposed</p>
<p>to suggest that drugs were safe,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t leap to fix the problem because in some sense,</p>
<p>it was the perfect cover for the difficult job</p>
<p>of bringing drugs to market and then discovering</p>
<p>their actual toxicity profile, right?</p>
<p>This made things look safer than they were</p>
<p>and I believe a lot of profits</p>
<p>have likely been generated downstream.</p>
<p>So to kind of play devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also possible that this particular,</p>
<p>the length of the telomeres is not a strong variable</p>
<p>for the drug development and for the conclusions</p>
<p>that Carol and others have been studying.</p>
<p>Is it possible for that to be the case?</p>
<p>So one reason she and others could be ignoring this</p>
<p>is because it&rsquo;s not a strong variable.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t believe so and in fact,</p>
<p>at the point that I went to publish my paper,</p>
<p>Carol published her result.</p>
<p>She did so in a way that did not make a huge splash.</p>
<p>Did she, I apologize if I don&rsquo;t know how,</p>
<p>what was the emphasis of her publication of that paper?</p>
<p>Was it purely just kind of showing data</p>
<p>or is there more, because in your paper,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of more of a philosophical statement as well.</p>
<p>Well, my paper was motivated by interest</p>
<p>in the evolutionary dynamics around senescence.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t pursuing grants or anything like that.</p>
<p>I was just working on a puzzle I thought was interesting.</p>
<p>Carol has, of course, gone on to win a Nobel Prize</p>
<p>for her co discovery with Elizabeth Greider</p>
<p>of telomerase, the enzyme that lengthens telomeres.</p>
<p>But anyway, she&rsquo;s a heavy hitter in the academic world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what her purpose was.</p>
<p>I do know that she told me she wasn&rsquo;t planning to publish</p>
<p>and I do know that I discovered that she was</p>
<p>in the process of publishing very late</p>
<p>and when I asked her to send me the paper</p>
<p>to see whether or not she had put evidence in it</p>
<p>that the hypothesis had come from me,</p>
<p>she grudgingly sent it to me</p>
<p>and my name was nowhere mentioned</p>
<p>and she broke contact at that point.</p>
<p>What it is that motivated her, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it can possibly be</p>
<p>that this result is unimportant.</p>
<p>The fact is, the reason I called her in the first place,</p>
<p>an established contact that generated our collaboration,</p>
<p>was that she was a leading light in the field</p>
<p>of telomeric studies and because of that,</p>
<p>this question about whether the model organisms</p>
<p>are distorting the understanding</p>
<p>of the functioning of telomeres, it&rsquo;s central.</p>
<p>Do you feel like you&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>as a young graduate student, do you think Carol</p>
<p>or do you think the scientific community</p>
<p>broadly screwed you over in some way?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of it in those terms.</p>
<p>Probably partly because it&rsquo;s not productive</p>
<p>but I have a complex relationship with this story.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I&rsquo;m livid with Carol Greider</p>
<p>for what she did.</p>
<p>She absolutely pretended that I didn&rsquo;t exist in this story</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think I was a threat to her.</p>
<p>My interest was as an evolutionary biologist,</p>
<p>I had made an evolutionary contribution,</p>
<p>she had tested a hypothesis and frankly,</p>
<p>I think it would have been better for her</p>
<p>if she had acknowledged what I had done.</p>
<p>I think it would have enhanced her work</p>
<p>and I was, let&rsquo;s put it this way,</p>
<p>when I watched her Nobel lecture,</p>
<p>and I should say there&rsquo;s been a lot of confusion</p>
<p>about this Nobel stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never said that I should have gotten a Nobel prize.</p>
<p>People have misportrayed that.</p>
<p>In listening to her lecture,</p>
<p>I had one of the most bizarre emotional experiences</p>
<p>of my life because she presented the work</p>
<p>that resulted from my hypothesis.</p>
<p>She presented it as she had in her paper</p>
<p>with no acknowledgement of where it had come from</p>
<p>and she had in fact portrayed the distortion</p>
<p>of the telomeres as if it were a lucky fact</p>
<p>because it allowed testing hypotheses</p>
<p>that would otherwise not be testable.</p>
<p>You have to understand as a young scientist</p>
<p>to watch work that you have done presented</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s surely the most important lecture</p>
<p>of her career, it&rsquo;s thrilling.</p>
<p>It was thrilling to see her figures</p>
<p>projected on the screen there.</p>
<p>To have been part of work that was important enough</p>
<p>for that felt great and of course,</p>
<p>to be erased from the story felt absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>So anyway, that&rsquo;s sort of where I am with it.</p>
<p>My sense is what I&rsquo;m really troubled by in this story</p>
<p>is the fact that as far as I know,</p>
<p>the flaw with the mice has not been addressed.</p>
<p>And actually, Eric did some looking into this.</p>
<p>He tried to establish by calling the Jack&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>and trying to ascertain what had happened with the colonies,</p>
<p>whether any change in protocol had occurred</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t get anywhere.</p>
<p>There was seemingly no awareness that it was even an issue.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very troubled by the fact that as a father,</p>
<p>for example, I&rsquo;m in no position to protect my family</p>
<p>from the hazard that I believe lurks</p>
<p>in our medicine cabinets, right?</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;m aware of where the hazard comes from,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t tell me anything useful</p>
<p>about which of these drugs will turn out to do damage</p>
<p>if that is ultimately tested.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very frustrating position to be in.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there&rsquo;s a part of me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even still grateful to Carol for taking my call.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t have to take my call</p>
<p>and talk to some young graduate student</p>
<p>who had some evolutionary idea</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t in her wheelhouse specifically, and yet she did.</p>
<p>And for a while, she was a good collaborator, so.</p>
<p>Well, can I, I have to proceed carefully here because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a complicated topic.</p>
<p>So she took the call.</p>
<p>And you kind of, you&rsquo;re kind of saying that</p>
<p>she basically erased credit, you know,</p>
<p>pretending you didn&rsquo;t exist in some kind of,</p>
<p>in a certain sense.</p>
<p>Let me phrase it this way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, as a research scientist at MIT,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had, and especially just part of</p>
<p>a large set of collaborations,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of students come to me</p>
<p>and talk to me about ideas,</p>
<p>perhaps less interesting than what we&rsquo;re discussing here</p>
<p>in the space of AI, that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about anyway.</p>
<p>In general, with everything I&rsquo;m doing with robotics, people</p>
<p>have told me a bunch of ideas</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m already thinking about.</p>
<p>The point is taking that idea, see, this is different</p>
<p>because the idea has more power in the space</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about here,</p>
<p>and robotics is like your idea means shit</p>
<p>until you build it.</p>
<p>Like, so the engineering world is a little different,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a kind of sense that I probably forgot</p>
<p>a lot of brilliant ideas have been told to me.</p>
<p>Do you think she pretended you don&rsquo;t exist?</p>
<p>Do you think she was so busy that she kind of forgot,</p>
<p>you know, that she has like the stream</p>
<p>of brilliant people around her,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of ideas that are swimming in the air,</p>
<p>and you just kind of forget people</p>
<p>that are a little bit on the periphery</p>
<p>on the idea generation, like, or is it some mix of both?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a mix of both.</p>
<p>I know that because we corresponded.</p>
<p>She put a graduate student on this work.</p>
<p>He emailed me excitedly when the results came in.</p>
<p>So there was no ambiguity about what had happened.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, when I went to publish my work,</p>
<p>I actually sent it to Carol in order to get her feedback</p>
<p>because I wanted to be a good collaborator to her,</p>
<p>and she absolutely panned it,</p>
<p>made many critiques that were not valid,</p>
<p>but it was clear at that point</p>
<p>that she became an antagonist,</p>
<p>and none of this adds up.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t possibly have forgotten the conversation.</p>
<p>I believe I even sent her tissues at some point in part,</p>
<p>not related to this project, but as a favor.</p>
<p>She was doing another project that involved telomeres,</p>
<p>and she needed samples that I could get ahold of</p>
<p>because of the Museum of Zoology that I was in.</p>
<p>So this was not a one off conversation.</p>
<p>I certainly know that those sorts of things can happen,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what happened here.</p>
<p>This was a relationship that existed</p>
<p>and then was suddenly cut short</p>
<p>at the point that she published her paper by surprise</p>
<p>without saying where the hypothesis had come from</p>
<p>and began to be a opposing force to my work.</p>
<p>Is there, there&rsquo;s a bunch of trajectories</p>
<p>you could have taken through life.</p>
<p>Do you think about the trajectory of being a researcher,</p>
<p>of then going to war in the space of ideas,</p>
<p>of publishing further papers along this line?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s often the dynamic of that fascinating space</p>
<p>is you have a junior researcher with brilliant ideas</p>
<p>and a senior researcher that starts out as a mentor</p>
<p>that becomes a competitor.</p>
<p>I mean, that happens.</p>
<p>But then the way to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost an opportunity to shine</p>
<p>is to publish a bunch more papers in this place</p>
<p>to tear it apart, to dig into,</p>
<p>like really make it a war of ideas.</p>
<p>Did you consider that possible trajectory?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>A couple of things to say about it.</p>
<p>One, this work was not central for me.</p>
<p>I took a year on the T. Lemire project</p>
<p>because something fascinating occurred to me</p>
<p>and I pursued it.</p>
<p>And the more I pursued it,</p>
<p>the clearer it was there was something there.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t the focus of my graduate work.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t want to become a T. Lemire researcher.</p>
<p>What I want to do is to be an evolutionary biologist</p>
<p>who upgrades the toolkit of evolutionary concepts</p>
<p>so that we can see more clearly</p>
<p>how organisms function and why.</p>
<p>And T. Lemire&rsquo;s was a proof of concept, right?</p>
<p>That paper was a proof of concept</p>
<p>that the toolkit in question works.</p>
<p>As for the need to pursue it further,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of absurd</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not the first person to say</p>
<p>maybe that was the way to go about it.</p>
<p>But the basic point is, look, the work was good.</p>
<p>It turned out to be highly predictive.</p>
<p>Frankly, the model of senescence that I presented</p>
<p>is now widely accepted.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t feel any misgivings at all</p>
<p>about having spent a year on it, said my piece,</p>
<p>and moved on to other things</p>
<p>which frankly I think are bigger.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of good to be done</p>
<p>and it would be a waste to get overly narrowly focused.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many ways through the space of science</p>
<p>and the most common ways is just publish a lot.</p>
<p>Just publish a lot of papers, do these incremental work</p>
<p>and exploring the space kind of like ants looking for food.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re tossing out a bunch of different ideas.</p>
<p>Some of them could be brilliant breakthrough ideas, nature.</p>
<p>Some of them are more confidence kind of publications,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Did you consider that kind of path in science?</p>
<p>Of course I considered it,</p>
<p>but I must say the experience of having my first encounter</p>
<p>with the process of peer review be this story,</p>
<p>which was frankly a debacle from one end to the other</p>
<p>with respect to the process of publishing.</p>
<p>It did not, it was not a very good sales pitch</p>
<p>for trying to make a difference through publication.</p>
<p>And I would point out part of what I ran into</p>
<p>and I think frankly part of what explains Carol&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>is that in some parts of science,</p>
<p>there is this dynamic where PIs parasitize their underlings</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re very, very good, you rise to the level</p>
<p>where one day instead of being parasitized,</p>
<p>you get to parasitize others.</p>
<p>Now I find that scientifically despicable</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t the culture of the lab I grew up in at all.</p>
<p>My lab, in fact, the PI, Dick Alexander, who&rsquo;s now gone,</p>
<p>but who was an incredible mind and a great human being,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t want his graduate students working</p>
<p>on the same topics he was on,</p>
<p>not because it wouldn&rsquo;t have been useful and exciting,</p>
<p>but because in effect, he did not want any confusion</p>
<p>about who had done what because he was a great mentor</p>
<p>and the idea was actually a great mentor</p>
<p>is not stealing ideas and you don&rsquo;t want people</p>
<p>thinking that they are.</p>
<p>So anyway, my point would be,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t up for being parasitized.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the idea that if you are very good,</p>
<p>you get parasitized until it&rsquo;s your turn</p>
<p>to parasitize others.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Crossing over from evolution into cellular biology</p>
<p>may have exposed me to that.</p>
<p>That may have been par for the course,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t make it acceptable.</p>
<p>And I would also point out that my work falls</p>
<p>in the realm of synthesis.</p>
<p>My work generally takes evidence accumulated by others</p>
<p>and places it together in order to generate hypotheses</p>
<p>that explain sets of phenomena</p>
<p>that are otherwise intractable.</p>
<p>And I am not sure that that is best done</p>
<p>with narrow publications that are read by few.</p>
<p>And in fact, I would point to the very conspicuous example</p>
<p>of Richard Dawkins, who I must say I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>a tremendous amount from and I greatly admire.</p>
<p>Dawkins has almost no publication record</p>
<p>in the sense of peer reviewed papers in journals.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s done instead is done synthetic work</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s published it in books,</p>
<p>which are not peer reviewed in the same sense.</p>
<p>And frankly, I think there&rsquo;s no doubting</p>
<p>his contribution to the field.</p>
<p>So my sense is if Richard Dawkins can illustrate</p>
<p>that one can make contributions to the field</p>
<p>without using journals as the primary mechanism</p>
<p>for distributing what you&rsquo;ve come to understand,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s obviously a valid mechanism</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a far better one from the point of view</p>
<p>of accomplishing what I want to accomplish.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>There is of course several levels</p>
<p>you can do the kind of synthesis</p>
<p>and that does require a lot of both broad</p>
<p>and deep thinking is exceptionally valuable.</p>
<p>You could also, I&rsquo;m working on something</p>
<p>with Andrew Huberman now, you can also publish synthesis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like review papers that are exceptionally valuable</p>
<p>for the communities.</p>
<p>It brings the community together, tells a history,</p>
<p>tells a story of where the community has been.</p>
<p>It paints a picture of where the path lays for the future.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really valuable.</p>
<p>And Richard Dawkins is a good example</p>
<p>of somebody that does that in book form</p>
<p>that he kind of walks the line really interestingly.</p>
<p>You have like somebody who like Neil deGrasse Tyson,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s more like a science communicator.</p>
<p>Richard Dawkins sometimes is a science communicator,</p>
<p>but he gets like close to the technical</p>
<p>to where it&rsquo;s a little bit, it&rsquo;s not shying away</p>
<p>from being really a contribution to science.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s made real contributions.</p>
<p>In book form.</p>
<p>Yes, he really has.</p>
<p>Which is fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, Roger Penrose, I mean, similar kind of idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Synthesis does not, especially synthesis work,</p>
<p>work that synthesizes ideas does not necessarily need</p>
<p>to be peer reviewed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s peer reviewed by peers reading it.</p>
<p>Well, and reviewing it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, it is reviewed by peers,</p>
<p>which is not synonymous with peer review.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing is people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that the two things aren&rsquo;t the same, right?</p>
<p>Peer review is an anonymous process</p>
<p>that happens before publication</p>
<p>in a place where there is a power dynamic, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the joke of course is that peer review</p>
<p>is actually peer preview, right?</p>
<p>Your biggest competitors get to see your work</p>
<p>before it sees the light of day</p>
<p>and decide whether or not it gets published.</p>
<p>And again, when your formative experience</p>
<p>with the publication apparatus is the one I had</p>
<p>with the telomere paper, there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>that that seems like the right way</p>
<p>to advance important ideas.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the harm in publishing them</p>
<p>so that your peers have to review them in public</p>
<p>where they actually, if they&rsquo;re gonna disagree with you,</p>
<p>they actually have to take the risk of saying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is right and here&rsquo;s why, right?</p>
<p>With their name on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want my work reviewed by peers,</p>
<p>but I want it done in the open, you know,</p>
<p>for the same reason you don&rsquo;t meet</p>
<p>with dangerous people in private, you meet at the cafe.</p>
<p>I want the work reviewed out in public.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a difficult question?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>There is popularity in martyrdom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s popularity in pointing out</p>
<p>that the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>That can become a drug in itself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve confronted this in scientific work I&rsquo;ve done at MIT</p>
<p>where there are certain things that are not done well.</p>
<p>People are not being the best version of themselves.</p>
<p>And particular aspects of a particular field</p>
<p>are in need of a revolution.</p>
<p>And part of me wanted to point that out</p>
<p>versus doing the hard work of publishing papers</p>
<p>and doing the revolution.</p>
<p>Basically just pointing out, look,</p>
<p>you guys are doing it wrong and then just walking away.</p>
<p>Are you aware of the drug of martyrdom,</p>
<p>of the ego involved in it,</p>
<p>that it can cloud your thinking?</p>
<p>Probably one of the best questions I&rsquo;ve ever been asked.</p>
<p>So let me try to sort it out.</p>
<p>First of all, we are all mysteries to ourself at some level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible there&rsquo;s stuff going on in me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not aware of that&rsquo;s driving.</p>
<p>But in general, I would say one of my better strengths</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m not especially ego driven.</p>
<p>I have an ego, I clearly think highly of myself,</p>
<p>but it is not driving me.</p>
<p>I do not crave that kind of validation.</p>
<p>I do crave certain things.</p>
<p>I do love a good eureka moment.</p>
<p>There is something great about it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something even better about the phone calls</p>
<p>you make next when you share it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty fun, right?</p>
<p>I really like it.</p>
<p>I also really like my subject, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about a walk in the forest</p>
<p>when you have a toolkit in which you can actually look</p>
<p>at creatures and see something deep, right?</p>
<p>I like it, that drives me.</p>
<p>And I could entertain myself for the rest of my life, right?</p>
<p>If I was somehow isolated from the rest of the world,</p>
<p>but I was in a place that was biologically interesting,</p>
<p>hopefully I would be with people that I love</p>
<p>and pets that I love, believe it or not.</p>
<p>But if I were in that situation and I could just go out</p>
<p>every day and look at cool stuff and figure out</p>
<p>what it means, I could be all right with that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not heavily driven by the ego thing, as you put it.</p>
<p>So I am completely the same except instead of the pets,</p>
<p>I would put robots.</p>
<p>But so it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s the eureka, it&rsquo;s the exploration</p>
<p>of the subject that brings you joy and fulfillment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the ego.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s more to say.</p>
<p>No, I really don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the ego thing.</p>
<p>I will say I also have kind of a secondary passion</p>
<p>for robot stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never made anything useful, but I do believe,</p>
<p>I believe I found my calling.</p>
<p>But if this wasn&rsquo;t my calling,</p>
<p>my calling would have been inventing stuff.</p>
<p>I really enjoy that too.</p>
<p>So I get what you&rsquo;re saying about the analogy quite well.</p>
<p>But as far as the martyrdom thing,</p>
<p>I understand the drug you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen it more than I&rsquo;ve felt it.</p>
<p>I do, if I&rsquo;m just to be completely candid</p>
<p>and this question is so good, it deserves a candid answer.</p>
<p>I do like the fight, right?</p>
<p>I like fighting against people I don&rsquo;t respect</p>
<p>and I like winning, but I have no interest in martyrdom.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I have no interest in martyrdom</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;m having too good a time, right?</p>
<p>I very much enjoy my life and.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a good answer.</p>
<p>I have a wonderful wife.</p>
<p>I have amazing children.</p>
<p>I live in a lovely place.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna exit any quicker than I have to.</p>
<p>That said, I also believe in things</p>
<p>and a willingness to exit if that&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>is not exactly inviting martyrdom,</p>
<p>but it is an acceptance that fighting is dangerous</p>
<p>and going up against powerful forces</p>
<p>means who knows what will come of it, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the sense that the thing is out there</p>
<p>that used to kill inconvenient people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s done anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s primarily done through destroying them reputationally,</p>
<p>which is not something I relish the possibility of,</p>
<p>but there is a difference between</p>
<p>a willingness to face the hazard</p>
<p>rather than a desire to face it because of the thrill, right?</p>
<p>For me, the thrill is in fighting when I&rsquo;m in the right.</p>
<p>I think I feel that that is a worthwhile way</p>
<p>to take what I see as the kind of brutality</p>
<p>that is built into men and to channel it</p>
<p>to something useful, right?</p>
<p>If it is not channeled into something useful,</p>
<p>it will be channeled into something else,</p>
<p>so it damn well better be channeled into something useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not motivated by fame or popularity,</p>
<p>those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know what, you&rsquo;re just making me realize</p>
<p>that enjoying the fight,</p>
<p>fighting the powerful and idea that you believe is right</p>
<p>is a kind of optimism for the human spirit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we can win this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re turning into action,</p>
<p>into personal action, this hope for humanity</p>
<p>by saying like, we can win this.</p>
<p>And that makes you feel good about the rest of humanity,</p>
<p>that if there&rsquo;s people like me, then we&rsquo;re going to be okay.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re like, your ideas might be wrong or not,</p>
<p>but if you believe they&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fighting the powerful against all odds,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re going to be okay.</p>
<p>If I were to project, I mean,</p>
<p>because I enjoy the fight as well,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the way I, that&rsquo;s what brings me joy,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s optimism in action.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a little different for me.</p>
<p>And again, I think, you know, I recognize you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a familiar, your construction is familiar,</p>
<p>even if it isn&rsquo;t mine, right?</p>
<p>For me, I actually expect us not to be okay.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not okay with that.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really important, if I feel like what I&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t know of any reason that it&rsquo;s not okay,</p>
<p>or any reason that it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>As far as I know, we could still save humanity</p>
<p>and we could get to the fourth frontier</p>
<p>or something akin to it.</p>
<p>But I expect us not to, I expect us to fuck it up, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that thought, but I&rsquo;ve looked into the abyss</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done my calculations</p>
<p>and the number of ways we could not succeed are many</p>
<p>and the number of ways that we could manage</p>
<p>to get out of this very dangerous phase of history is small.</p>
<p>The thing I don&rsquo;t have to worry about is</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t do enough, right?</p>
<p>That I was a coward, that I prioritized other things.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think I will be able to say</p>
<p>to myself, and in fact, the thing that allows me to sleep,</p>
<p>is that when I saw clearly what needed to be done,</p>
<p>I tried to do it to the extent that it was in my power.</p>
<p>And if we fail, as I expect us to,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say, well, geez, that&rsquo;s on me, you know?</p>
<p>And frankly, I regard what I just said to you</p>
<p>as something like a personality defect, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to free myself from the sense</p>
<p>that this is my fault.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my guess is that personality defect</p>
<p>is probably good for humanity, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good one for me to have the externalities</p>
<p>of it are positive, so I don&rsquo;t feel too bad about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s funny, so yeah, our perspective on the world</p>
<p>are different, but they rhyme, like you said.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve also looked into the abyss,</p>
<p>and it kind of smiled nervously back.</p>
<p>So I have a more optimistic sense that we&rsquo;re gonna win</p>
<p>more than likely we&rsquo;re going to be okay.</p>
<p>Right there with you, brother.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m expecting me to be right.</p>
<p>But back to Eric, you had a wonderful conversation.</p>
<p>In that conversation, he played the big brother role,</p>
<p>and he was very happy about it.</p>
<p>He was self congratulatory about it.</p>
<p>Can you talk to the ways in which Eric made you</p>
<p>a better man throughout your life?</p>
<p>Yeah, hell yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, for one thing, you know,</p>
<p>Eric and I are interestingly similar in some ways</p>
<p>and radically different in some other ways,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s often a matter of fascination</p>
<p>to people who know us both because almost always</p>
<p>people meet one of us first, and they sort of</p>
<p>get used to that thing, and then they meet the other,</p>
<p>and it throws the model into chaos.</p>
<p>But you know, I had a great advantage,</p>
<p>which is I came second, right?</p>
<p>So although it was kind of a pain in the ass</p>
<p>to be born into a world that had Eric in it</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a force of nature, right?</p>
<p>It was also terrifically useful because A,</p>
<p>he was a very awesome older brother</p>
<p>who made interesting mistakes, learned from them,</p>
<p>and conveyed the wisdom of what he had discovered,</p>
<p>and that was, you know, I don&rsquo;t know who else</p>
<p>ends up so lucky as to have that kind of person</p>
<p>blazing the trail.</p>
<p>It also probably, you know, my hypothesis</p>
<p>for what birth order effects are</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re actually adaptive, right?</p>
<p>That the reason that a second born is different</p>
<p>than a first born is that they&rsquo;re not born</p>
<p>into a world with the same niches in it, right?</p>
<p>And so the thing about Eric is he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>completely dominant in the realm of fundamental thinking,</p>
<p>right, like what he&rsquo;s fascinated by</p>
<p>is the fundamental of fundamentals,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s excellent at it, which meant</p>
<p>that I was born into a world where somebody</p>
<p>was becoming excellent in that, and for me</p>
<p>to be anywhere near the fundamental of fundamentals</p>
<p>was going to be pointless, right?</p>
<p>I was going to be playing second fiddle forever,</p>
<p>and I think that that actually drove me</p>
<p>to the other end of the continuum</p>
<p>between fundamental and emergent,</p>
<p>and so I became fascinated with biology</p>
<p>and have been since I was three years old, right?</p>
<p>I think Eric drove that, and I have to thank him for it</p>
<p>because, you know, I mean.</p>
<p>I never thought of, so Eric drives towards the fundamental,</p>
<p>and you drive towards the emergent,</p>
<p>the physics and the biology.</p>
<p>Right, opposite ends of the continuum,</p>
<p>and as Eric would be quick to point out</p>
<p>if he was sitting here, I treat the emergent layer,</p>
<p>I seek the fundamentals in it,</p>
<p>which is sort of an echo of Eric&rsquo;s style of thinking</p>
<p>but applied to the very far complexity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s overpoweringly argues for the importance of physics,</p>
<p>the fundamental of the fundamental.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not here to defend himself.</p>
<p>Is there an argument to be made against that?</p>
<p>Or biology, the emergent,</p>
<p>the study of the thing that emerged</p>
<p>when the fundamental acts at the cosmic scale</p>
<p>and then builds the beautiful thing that is us</p>
<p>is much more important.</p>
<p>Psychology, biology, the systems</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re actually interacting with in this human world</p>
<p>are much more important to understand</p>
<p>than the low level theories of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and general relativity.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t say that one is more important.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s probably a different time scale.</p>
<p>I think understanding the emergent layer</p>
<p>is more often useful, but the bang for the buck</p>
<p>at the far fundamental layer may be much greater.</p>
<p>So for example, the fourth frontier,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s gonna have to be fusion powered.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anything else will do it,</p>
<p>but once you had fusion power,</p>
<p>assuming we didn&rsquo;t just dump fusion power on the market</p>
<p>the way we would be likely to</p>
<p>if it was invented usefully tomorrow,</p>
<p>but if we had fusion power</p>
<p>and we had a little bit more wisdom than we have,</p>
<p>you could do an awful lot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not gonna come from people like me</p>
<p>who look at the dynamics of it.</p>
<p>Can I argue against that?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>I think the way to unlock fusion power</p>
<p>is through artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>So I think most of the breakthrough ideas</p>
<p>in the futures of science will be developed by AI systems.</p>
<p>And I think in order to build intelligent AI systems,</p>
<p>you have to be a scholar of the fundamental</p>
<p>of the emergent, of biology, of the neuroscience,</p>
<p>of the way the brain works,</p>
<p>of intelligence, of consciousness.</p>
<p>And those things, at least directly,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have anything to do with physics.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making me a little bit sad</p>
<p>because my addiction to the aha moment thing</p>
<p>is incompatible with outsourcing that job.</p>
<p>Like the outsource thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna outsource that thing to the AI.</p>
<p>You reap the moment.</p>
<p>And actually, I&rsquo;ve seen this happen before</p>
<p>because some of the people who trained Heather and me</p>
<p>were phylogenetic systematists,</p>
<p>Arnold Kluge in particular.</p>
<p>And the problem with systematics</p>
<p>is that to do it right when your technology is primitive,</p>
<p>you have to be deeply embedded in the philosophical</p>
<p>and the logical, right?</p>
<p>Your method has to be based in the highest level of rigor.</p>
<p>Once you can sequence genes,</p>
<p>genes can spit so much data at you</p>
<p>that you can overwhelm high quality work</p>
<p>with just lots and lots and lots of automated work.</p>
<p>And so in some sense,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a generation of phylogenetic systematists</p>
<p>who are the last of the greats</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s replacing them is sequencers.</p>
<p>So anyway, maybe you&rsquo;re right about the AI.</p>
<p>And I guess I&rsquo;m&hellip;</p>
<p>What makes you sad?</p>
<p>I like figuring stuff out.</p>
<p>Is there something that you disagree with the error con,</p>
<p>even trying to convince them you failed so far,</p>
<p>but you will eventually succeed?</p>
<p>You know, that is a very long list.</p>
<p>Eric and I have tensions over certain things</p>
<p>that recur all the time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to think what would be the ideal&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it in the space of science,</p>
<p>in the space of philosophy, politics, family, love, robots?</p>
<p>Well, all right, let me&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna use your podcast</p>
<p>to make a bit of a cryptic war</p>
<p>and just say there are many places</p>
<p>in which I believe that I have butted heads with Eric</p>
<p>over the course of decades</p>
<p>and I have seen him move in my direction</p>
<p>substantially over time.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been winning.</p>
<p>He might win a battle here or there,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve been winning the war.</p>
<p>I would not say that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible he could say the same thing about me.</p>
<p>And in fact, I know that it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There are places where he&rsquo;s absolutely convinced me.</p>
<p>But in any case, I do believe it&rsquo;s at least&hellip;</p>
<p>It may not be a totally even fight,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more even than some will imagine.</p>
<p>But yeah, we have&hellip;</p>
<p>There are things I say that drive him nuts, right?</p>
<p>Like when something, like you heard me talk about the&hellip;</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>It was the autopilot that seems to be putting</p>
<p>a great many humans in needless medical jeopardy</p>
<p>over the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>And my feeling is we can say this almost for sure.</p>
<p>Anytime you have the appearance</p>
<p>of some captured gigantic entity</p>
<p>that is censoring you on YouTube</p>
<p>and handing down dictates from the who and all of that,</p>
<p>it is sure that there will be</p>
<p>a certain amount of collusion, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be some embarrassing emails in some places</p>
<p>that are gonna reveal some shocking connections.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s gonna be an awful lot of emergence</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t involve collusion, right?</p>
<p>In which people were doing their little part of a job</p>
<p>and something was emerging.</p>
<p>And you never know what the admixture is.</p>
<p>How much are we looking at actual collusion</p>
<p>and how much are we looking at an emergent process?</p>
<p>But you should always walk in with the sense</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s gonna be a ratio.</p>
<p>And the question is, what is the ratio in this case?</p>
<p>I think this drives Eric nuts</p>
<p>because he is very focused on the people.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s focused on the people who have a choice</p>
<p>and make the wrong one.</p>
<p>And anyway, he may.</p>
<p>Discussion of the ratio is a distraction to that.</p>
<p>I think he takes it almost as an offense</p>
<p>because it grants cover to people who are harming others.</p>
<p>And I think it offends him morally.</p>
<p>And if I had to say, I would say it alters his judgment</p>
<p>on the matter.</p>
<p>But anyway, certainly useful just to leave open</p>
<p>the two possibilities and say it&rsquo;s a ratio,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know which one.</p>
<p>Brother to brother, do you love the guy?</p>
<p>Hmm, hell yeah, hell yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love him if he was just my brother,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also awesome.</p>
<p>So I love him and I love him for who he is.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about back to your book,</p>
<p>Hunter Gatherer&rsquo;s Guide to the 21st Century.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait both for the book and the videos</p>
<p>you do on the book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting that there&rsquo;s like a structured,</p>
<p>organized way to present this.</p>
<p>A kind of from an evolutionary biology perspective,</p>
<p>a guide for the future,</p>
<p>using our past as the fundamental, the emergent way</p>
<p>to present a picture of the future.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about something that,</p>
<p>I think about a little bit in this modern world,</p>
<p>which is monogamy.</p>
<p>So I personally value monogamy.</p>
<p>One girl, ride or die.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Ride or, no, that&rsquo;s exactly it now.</p>
<p>But that said, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the right way</p>
<p>to approach this,</p>
<p>but from an evolutionary biology perspective</p>
<p>or from just looking at modern society,</p>
<p>that seems to be an idea that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right way to put it, flourishing?</p>
<p>It is waning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s waning.</p>
<p>So I suppose based on your reaction,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also a supporter of monogamy</p>
<p>or you value monogamy.</p>
<p>Are you and I just delusional?</p>
<p>What can you say about monogamy</p>
<p>from the context of your book,</p>
<p>from the context of evolutionary biology,</p>
<p>from the context of being human?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can say that I fully believe</p>
<p>that we are actually enlightened</p>
<p>and that although monogamy is waning,</p>
<p>that it is not waning because there is a superior system.</p>
<p>It is waning for predictable other reasons.</p>
<p>So let us just say it is,</p>
<p>there is a lot of pre trans fallacy here</p>
<p>where people go through a phase</p>
<p>where they recognize that actually</p>
<p>we know a lot about the evolution of monogamy</p>
<p>and we can tell from the fact</p>
<p>that humans are somewhat sexually dimorphic</p>
<p>that there has been a lot of polygyny in human history.</p>
<p>And in fact, most of human history was largely polygynous.</p>
<p>But it is also the case that most of the people</p>
<p>on earth today belong to civilizations</p>
<p>that are at least nominally monogamous</p>
<p>and have practiced monogamy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not anti evolutionary.</p>
<p>What that is is part of what I mentioned before</p>
<p>where human beings can swap out their software program</p>
<p>and different mating patterns are favored</p>
<p>in different periods of history.</p>
<p>So I would argue that the benefit of monogamy,</p>
<p>the primary one that drives the evolution</p>
<p>of monogamous patterns in humans</p>
<p>is that it brings all adults into child rearing.</p>
<p>Now the reason that that matters</p>
<p>is because human babies are very labor intensive.</p>
<p>In order to raise them properly,</p>
<p>having two parents is a huge asset</p>
<p>and having more than two parents,</p>
<p>having an extended family also very important.</p>
<p>But what that means is that for a population</p>
<p>that is expanding, a monogamous mating system makes sense.</p>
<p>It makes sense because it means that the number of offspring</p>
<p>that can be raised is elevated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s elevated because all potential parents</p>
<p>are involved in parenting.</p>
<p>Whereas if you sideline a bunch of males</p>
<p>by having a polygynous system</p>
<p>in which one male has many females,</p>
<p>which is typically the way that works,</p>
<p>what you do is you sideline all those males,</p>
<p>which means the total amount of parental effort is lower</p>
<p>and the population can&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m arguing is that you should expect to see</p>
<p>populations that face the possibility of expansion</p>
<p>endorse monogamy.</p>
<p>And at the point that they have reached carrying capacity,</p>
<p>you should expect to see polygyny break back out.</p>
<p>And what we are seeing</p>
<p>is a kind of false sophistication around polyamory,</p>
<p>which will end up breaking down into polygyny,</p>
<p>which will not be in the interest of most people.</p>
<p>Really the only people whose interest</p>
<p>it could be argued to be in</p>
<p>would be the very small number of males at the top</p>
<p>who have many partners and everybody else suffers.</p>
<p>Is it possible to make the argument</p>
<p>if we focus in on those males at the quote unquote top</p>
<p>with many female partners,</p>
<p>is it possible to say that that&rsquo;s a suboptimal life,</p>
<p>that a single partner is the optimal life?</p>
<p>Well, it depends what you mean.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that you and I wouldn&rsquo;t have to go very far</p>
<p>to figure out that what might be evolutionarily optimal</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t match my values as a person</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure it doesn&rsquo;t match yours either.</p>
<p>Can we try to dig into that gap between those two?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, we can do it very simply.</p>
<p>Selection might favor your engaging in war</p>
<p>against a defenseless enemy or genocide, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to figure out</p>
<p>how that might put your genes at advantage.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, Lex.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not getting involved in no genocide.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I will do anything to avoid it.</p>
<p>So some part of me has decided that my conscious self</p>
<p>and the values that I hold trump my evolutionary self</p>
<p>and once you figure out that in some extreme case,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true and then you realize</p>
<p>that that means it must be possible in many other cases</p>
<p>and you start going through all of the things</p>
<p>that selection would favor</p>
<p>and you realize that a fair fraction of the time,</p>
<p>actually, you&rsquo;re not up for this.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna be some robot on a mission</p>
<p>that involves genocide when necessary.</p>
<p>You wanna be your own person and accomplish things</p>
<p>that you think are valuable.</p>
<p>And so among those are not advocating,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s suppose you were in a position</p>
<p>to be one of those males at the top of a polygynous system.</p>
<p>We both know why that would be rewarding, right?</p>
<p>But we also both recognize.</p>
<p>Do we?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Lots of sex?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, what else?</p>
<p>Lots of sex and lots of variety, right?</p>
<p>So look, every red blooded American slash Russian male</p>
<p>can understand why that&rsquo;s appealing, right?</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is up against an alternative</p>
<p>which is having a partner with whom one is bonded</p>
<p>especially closely, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>A love.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t wanna straw man the polygyny position.</p>
<p>Obviously polygyny is complex</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing that stops a man presumably</p>
<p>from loving multiple partners and from them loving him back.</p>
<p>But in terms of, if love is your thing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a question about, okay, what is the quality of love</p>
<p>if it is divided over multiple partners, right?</p>
<p>And what is the net consequence for love in a society</p>
<p>when multiple people will be frozen out</p>
<p>for every individual male in this case who has it?</p>
<p>And what I would argue is, and you know,</p>
<p>this is weird to even talk about,</p>
<p>but this is partially me just talking</p>
<p>from personal experience.</p>
<p>I think there actually is a monogamy program in us</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not automatic.</p>
<p>But if you take it seriously, you can find it</p>
<p>and frankly, marriage, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be marriage,</p>
<p>but whatever it is that results in a lifelong bond</p>
<p>with a partner has gotten a very bad rap.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the butt of too many jokes.</p>
<p>But the truth is, it&rsquo;s hugely rewarding, it&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>But if you know that you&rsquo;re looking for something, right?</p>
<p>If you know that the objective actually exists</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not some utopian fantasy that can&rsquo;t be found,</p>
<p>if you know that there&rsquo;s some real world, you know,</p>
<p>warts and all version of it, then you might actually think,</p>
<p>hey, that is something I want and you might pursue it</p>
<p>and my guess is you&rsquo;d be very happy when you find it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there is, getting to the fundamental</p>
<p>and the emergent, I feel like there is some kind of physics</p>
<p>of love.</p>
<p>So one, there&rsquo;s a conservation thing going on.</p>
<p>So if you have like many partners, yeah, in theory,</p>
<p>you should be able to love all of them deeply.</p>
<p>But it seems like in reality that love gets split.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s another law that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>in terms of monogamy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s at the physics level,</p>
<p>but if you are in a monogamous relationship by choice</p>
<p>and almost as in slight rebellion to social norms,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more powerful.</p>
<p>Like if you choose that one partnership,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also more powerful.</p>
<p>If like everybody&rsquo;s in a monogamous,</p>
<p>this pressure to be married and this pressure of society,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different because that&rsquo;s almost like a constraint</p>
<p>on your freedom that is enforced by something</p>
<p>other than your own ideals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by somebody else.</p>
<p>When you yourself choose to, I guess,</p>
<p>create these constraints, that enriches that love.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some kind of love function,</p>
<p>like E equals MC squared, but for love,</p>
<p>that I feel like if you have less partners</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s done by choice, that can maximize that.</p>
<p>And that love can transcend the biology,</p>
<p>transcend the evolutionary biology forces</p>
<p>that have to do much more with survival</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It can transcend to take us to a richer experience,</p>
<p>which we have the luxury of having,</p>
<p>exploring of happiness, of joy, of fulfillment,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Totally agree with this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no question that by choice,</p>
<p>when there are other choices,</p>
<p>imbues it with meaning that it might not otherwise have.</p>
<p>I would also say, I&rsquo;m really struck by,</p>
<p>and I have a hard time not feeling terrible sadness</p>
<p>over what younger people are coming</p>
<p>to think about this topic.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re missing something so important</p>
<p>and so hard to phrase that,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re missing it.</p>
<p>They might know that they&rsquo;re unhappy,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t understand what it is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re even looking for,</p>
<p>because nobody&rsquo;s really been honest with them</p>
<p>about what their choices are.</p>
<p>And I have to say, if I was a young person,</p>
<p>or if I was advising a young person,</p>
<p>which I used to do, again, a million years ago</p>
<p>when I was a college professor four years ago,</p>
<p>but I used to talk to students.</p>
<p>I knew my students really well,</p>
<p>and they would ask questions about this,</p>
<p>and they were always curious</p>
<p>because Heather and I seemed to have a good relationship,</p>
<p>and many of them knew both of us.</p>
<p>So they would talk to us about this.</p>
<p>If I was advising somebody, I would say,</p>
<p>do not bypass the possibility</p>
<p>that what you are supposed to do is find somebody worthy,</p>
<p>somebody who can handle it,</p>
<p>somebody who you are compatible with,</p>
<p>and that you don&rsquo;t have to be perfectly compatible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about dating until you find the one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about finding somebody whose underlying values</p>
<p>and viewpoint are complimentary to yours,</p>
<p>sufficient that you fall in love.</p>
<p>If you find that person, opt out together.</p>
<p>Get out of this damn system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s telling you what&rsquo;s sophisticated</p>
<p>to think about love and romance and sex.</p>
<p>Ignore it together, all right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key, and I believe you&rsquo;ll end up laughing</p>
<p>in the end if you do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll discover, wow, that&rsquo;s a hellscape</p>
<p>that I opted out of, and this thing I opted into?</p>
<p>Complicated, difficult, worth it.</p>
<p>Nothing that&rsquo;s worth it is ever not difficult,</p>
<p>so we should even just skip</p>
<p>the whole statement about difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>I just, I wanna be honest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, oh, it&rsquo;s nonstop joy.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s fricking complex, but worth it?</p>
<p>No question in my mind.</p>
<p>Is there advice outside of love</p>
<p>that you can give to young people?</p>
<p>You were a million years ago a professor.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to young people,</p>
<p>high schoolers, college students about career, about life?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s not, they&rsquo;re not gonna like it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not easy to operationalize,</p>
<p>and this was a problem when I was a college professor, too.</p>
<p>People would ask me what they should do.</p>
<p>Should they go to graduate school?</p>
<p>I had almost nothing useful to say</p>
<p>because the job market and the market of prejob training</p>
<p>and all of that, these things are all so distorted</p>
<p>and corrupt that I didn&rsquo;t wanna point anybody to anything</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all broken, and I would tell them that,</p>
<p>but I would say that results in a kind of meta level advice</p>
<p>that I do think is useful.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know where the opportunities will be.</p>
<p>You should invest in tools rather than knowledge.</p>
<p>To the extent that you can do things,</p>
<p>you can repurpose that no matter what the future brings</p>
<p>to the extent that if you, as a robot guy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the skills of a robot guy.</p>
<p>Now, if civilization failed</p>
<p>and the stuff of robot building disappeared with it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d still have the mind of a robot guy,</p>
<p>and the mind of a robot guy can retool</p>
<p>around all kinds of things, whether you&rsquo;re forced to work</p>
<p>with fibers that are made into ropes.</p>
<p>Your mechanical mind would be useful in all kinds of places,</p>
<p>so invest in tools like that that can be easily repurposed,</p>
<p>and invest in combinations of tools, right?</p>
<p>If civilization keeps limping along,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be up against all sorts of people</p>
<p>who have studied the things that you studied, right?</p>
<p>If you think, hey, computer programming</p>
<p>is really, really cool, and you pick up computer programming,</p>
<p>guess what, you just entered a large group of people</p>
<p>who have that skill, and many of them will be better</p>
<p>than you, almost certainly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you combine that with something else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very rarely combined with it,</p>
<p>if you have, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s carpentry</p>
<p>and computer programming, if you take combinations</p>
<p>of things that are, even if they&rsquo;re both common,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not commonly found together,</p>
<p>then those combinations create a rarefied space</p>
<p>where you inhabit it, and even if the things</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even really touch, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>they create a mind in which the two things are live</p>
<p>and you can move back and forth between them</p>
<p>and step out of your own perspective</p>
<p>by moving from one to the other,</p>
<p>that will increase what you can see</p>
<p>and the quality of your tools.</p>
<p>And so anyway, that isn&rsquo;t useful advice.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t tell you whether you should go</p>
<p>to graduate school or not, but it does tell you</p>
<p>the one thing we can say for certain about the future</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s uncertain, and so prepare for it.</p>
<p>And like you said, there&rsquo;s cool things to be discovered</p>
<p>in the intersection of fields and ideas.</p>
<p>And I would look at grad school that way,</p>
<p>actually, if you do go, or I see,</p>
<p>I mean, this is such a, like every course</p>
<p>in grad school, undergrad too,</p>
<p>was like this little journey that you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>that explores a particular field.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious how useful it is,</p>
<p>but it allows you to discover intersections</p>
<p>between that thing and some other thing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re bringing to the table these pieces of knowledge,</p>
<p>some of which when intersected might create a niche</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely novel, unique, and will bring you joy.</p>
<p>I mean, I took a huge number of courses</p>
<p>in theoretical computer science.</p>
<p>Most of them seem useless, but they totally changed</p>
<p>the way I see the world in ways that I&rsquo;m not prepared</p>
<p>or is a little bit difficult to kind of make explicit,</p>
<p>but taken together, they&rsquo;ve allowed me to see,</p>
<p>for example, the world of robotics totally different</p>
<p>and different from many of my colleagues</p>
<p>and friends and so on.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a good way to see if you go</p>
<p>to grad school was as a opportunity</p>
<p>to explore intersections of fields,</p>
<p>even if the individual fields seem useless.</p>
<p>Yeah, and useless doesn&rsquo;t mean useless, right?</p>
<p>Useless means not directly applicable,</p>
<p>but a good, useless course can be the best one</p>
<p>you ever took.</p>
<p>Yeah, I took James Joyce, a course on James Joyce,</p>
<p>and that was truly useless.</p>
<p>Well, I took immunobiology in the medical school</p>
<p>when I was at Penn as, I guess I would have been</p>
<p>a freshman or a sophomore.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be in this class.</p>
<p>It blew my goddamn mind, and it still does, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we had this, I don&rsquo;t even know who it was,</p>
<p>but we had this great professor who was highly placed</p>
<p>in the world of immunobiology.</p>
<p>The course is called Immunobiology, not immunology.</p>
<p>Immunobiology, it had the right focus,</p>
<p>and as I recall it, the professor stood sideways</p>
<p>to the chalkboard, staring off into space,</p>
<p>literally stroking his beard with this bemused look</p>
<p>on his face through the entire lecture.</p>
<p>And you had all these medical students</p>
<p>who were so furiously writing notes</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t even think they were noticing</p>
<p>the person delivering this thing,</p>
<p>but I got what this guy was smiling about.</p>
<p>It was like so, what he was describing,</p>
<p>adaptive immunity is so marvelous, right?</p>
<p>That it was like almost a privilege to even be saying it</p>
<p>to a room full of people who were listening, you know?</p>
<p>But anyway, yeah, I took that course,</p>
<p>and lo and behold, COVID.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be useful.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, suddenly it&rsquo;s front and center,</p>
<p>and wow, am I glad I took it.</p>
<p>But anyway, yeah, useless courses are great.</p>
<p>And actually, Eric gave me one of the greater pieces</p>
<p>of advice, at least for college, that anyone&rsquo;s ever given,</p>
<p>which was don&rsquo;t worry about the prereqs.</p>
<p>Take it anyway, right?</p>
<p>But now, I don&rsquo;t even know if kids can do this now</p>
<p>because the prereqs are now enforced by a computer.</p>
<p>But back in the day, if you didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t have the prereqs,</p>
<p>nobody stopped you from taking the course.</p>
<p>And what he told me, which I didn&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>was that often the advanced courses are easier in some way.</p>
<p>The material&rsquo;s complex, but it&rsquo;s not like intro bio</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re learning a thousand things at once, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like focused on something.</p>
<p>So if you dedicate yourself, you can pull it off.</p>
<p>Yeah, stay with an idea for many weeks at a time,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s ultimately rewarding,</p>
<p>and not as difficult as it looks.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a ridiculous question?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Well, I feel terrible having to give you the answer.</p>
<p>I realize you asked the question,</p>
<p>but if I tell you, you&rsquo;re gonna again feel bad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>But look, there&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p>There can be a disappointment.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s gonna be a horror, right?</p>
<p>Because we actually know the answer to the question.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely meaningless.</p>
<p>There is nothing that we can do</p>
<p>that escapes the heat death of the universe</p>
<p>or whatever it is that happens at the end.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not gonna make it there anyway.</p>
<p>But even if you were optimistic about our ability</p>
<p>to escape every existential hazard indefinitely,</p>
<p>ultimately it&rsquo;s all for naught and we know it, right?</p>
<p>That said, once you stare into that abyss,</p>
<p>and then it stares back and laughs or whatever happens,</p>
<p>then the question is, okay, given that,</p>
<p>can I relax a little bit, right?</p>
<p>And figure out, well, what would make sense</p>
<p>if that were true, right?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something very clear to me.</p>
<p>I think if you do all of the,</p>
<p>if I just take the values that I&rsquo;m sure we share</p>
<p>and extrapolate from them,</p>
<p>I think the following thing is actually a moral imperative.</p>
<p>Being a human and having opportunity</p>
<p>is absolutely fucking awesome, right?</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t make use of the opportunity</p>
<p>and a lot of people don&rsquo;t have opportunity, right?</p>
<p>They get to be human, but they&rsquo;re too constrained</p>
<p>by keeping a roof over their heads to really be free.</p>
<p>But being a free human is fantastic.</p>
<p>And being a free human on this beautiful planet,</p>
<p>crippled as it may be, is unparalleled.</p>
<p>I mean, what could be better?</p>
<p>How lucky are we that we get that, right?</p>
<p>So if that&rsquo;s true, that it is awesome to be human</p>
<p>and to be free, then surely it is our obligation</p>
<p>to deliver that opportunity to as many people as we can.</p>
<p>And how do you do that?</p>
<p>Well, I think I know what job one is.</p>
<p>Job one is we have to get sustainable.</p>
<p>The way to get the maximum number of humans</p>
<p>to have that opportunity to be both here and free</p>
<p>is to make sure that there isn&rsquo;t a limit</p>
<p>on how long we can keep doing this.</p>
<p>That effectively requires us to reach sustainability.</p>
<p>And then at sustainability, you could have a horror show</p>
<p>of sustainability, right?</p>
<p>You could have a totalitarian sustainability.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the objective.</p>
<p>The objective is to liberate people.</p>
<p>And so the question, the whole fourth frontier question,</p>
<p>frankly, is how do you get to a sustainable</p>
<p>and indefinitely sustainable state</p>
<p>in which people feel liberated,</p>
<p>in which they are liberated,</p>
<p>to pursue the things that actually matter,</p>
<p>to pursue beauty, truth, compassion, connection,</p>
<p>all of those things that we could list as unalloyed goods,</p>
<p>those are the things that people should be most liberated</p>
<p>to do in a system that really functions.</p>
<p>And anyway, my point is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how precise that calculation is,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accurate enough.</p>
<p>And if it is accurate enough, then the point is, okay,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s no ultimate meaning,</p>
<p>but the proximate meaning is that one.</p>
<p>How many people can we get to have this wonderful experience</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve gotten to have, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s so wrong</p>
<p>that if I invest my life in it,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m making some big error.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure of that.</p>
<p>Life is awesome, and we wanna spread the awesome</p>
<p>as much as possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, you sum it up that way, spread the awesome.</p>
<p>Spread the awesome.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the fourth frontier.</p>
<p>And if that fails, if the fourth frontier fails,</p>
<p>the fifth frontier will be defined by robots,</p>
<p>and hopefully they&rsquo;ll learn the lessons</p>
<p>of the mistakes that the humans made</p>
<p>and build a better world with more awesome.</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;re very happy here</p>
<p>and that they do a better job with the place than we did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Brett.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it took us this long to talk,</p>
<p>as I mentioned to you before,</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t actually spoken, I think, at all.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always felt that we&rsquo;re already friends.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that works</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve listened to your podcasts a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also sort of loved your brother.</p>
<p>And so it was like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve known each other for the longest time,</p>
<p>and I hope we can be friends and talk often again.</p>
<p>And I hope that you get a chance to meet</p>
<p>some of my robot friends as well and fall in love.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m so glad that you love robots as well.</p>
<p>So we get to share in that love.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t wait for us to interact together.</p>
<p>So we went from talking about some of the worst failures</p>
<p>of humanity to some of the most beautiful</p>
<p>aspects of humanity.</p>
<p>What else can you ask for from a conversation?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>You know, Lex, I feel the same way towards you,</p>
<p>and I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>This has been a lot of fun,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m looking forward to our next one.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Brett Weinstein,</p>
<p>and thank you to Jordan Harbridge&rsquo;s show,</p>
<p>Express CPN, Magic Spoon, and Four Sigmatic.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Charles Darwin.</p>
<p>Ignorance more frequently begets confidence</p>
<p>than does knowledge.</p>
<p>It is those who know little, not those who know much,</p>
<p>who so positively assert that this or that problem</p>
<p>will never be solved by science.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
