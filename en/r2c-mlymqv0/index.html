<p>﻿[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome back everyone we are here for</p>
<p>another q a we have quite a few</p>
<p>questions lined up and people that are</p>
<p>going to ask those questions anything</p>
<p>that I say is definitely not meant to or</p>
<p>intended to cure you because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>illegal to cure people in the state of</p>
<p>Virginia so just check with your doctor</p>
<p>before implementing any of these</p>
<p>suggestions</p>
<p>all right Steve let&rsquo;s just Dive Right In</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>absolutely no cures on this show okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get right over to social media and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll start off with shrey from YouTube</p>
<p>I frequently have dry mouth which causes</p>
<p>me to drink a lot of water and urinate</p>
<p>often which results in clear urine</p>
<p>should I be concerned about that</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m going to be releasing a full</p>
<p>video on dry mouth dry eyes and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>dry skin so I&rsquo;m going to cover that but</p>
<p>I think what I&rsquo;d rather have you do is</p>
<p>watch the whole video because it really</p>
<p>depends on what you&rsquo;re doing are you</p>
<p>doing keto on you drying drying out are</p>
<p>you on medication are you drying out do</p>
<p>you drink a lot of alcohol like I just</p>
<p>need to find out because the the</p>
<p>solution is not as simple as just drink</p>
<p>more water so um stay tuned for that</p>
<p>video I&rsquo;m going to release it this week</p>
<p>should be pretty interesting all right</p>
<p>well speaking of videos It&rsquo;s confession</p>
<p>time for your producers so</p>
<p>um I uh I&rsquo;m down about another 12 13</p>
<p>pounds not that that is the uh you know</p>
<p>the the end-all uh</p>
<p>outcome for for what we&rsquo;re doing to stay</p>
<p>healthy but I was going to a corporate</p>
<p>party other night and I thought well you</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;ve already eaten my food and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have hors d&rsquo;oeuvres for</p>
<p>goodness sake so I said what would it</p>
<p>hurt if I stopped by Krispy Kreme and</p>
<p>got three chocolate glaze in one of</p>
<p>their traditional ones I mean it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>route to my my business event and so I I</p>
<p>did that and then I ate a bunch of</p>
<p>greasy food at the thing and then of</p>
<p>course felt guilty and then but the</p>
<p>point the reason is you all know I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>perfect and knows half the audience we</p>
<p>try we try to do the best we can and</p>
<p>climb back out so I&rsquo;m back on the</p>
<p>program but the point is if I had one is</p>
<p>that I watched Dr Berg&rsquo;s video a recent</p>
<p>one that talks about what to do if you</p>
<p>eat too much sugar and that really</p>
<p>helped me I ran five miles later that</p>
<p>night</p>
<p>um I uh you know did the various things</p>
<p>that he suggested so that doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that you should go out and cheat and</p>
<p>ruin your life like I did but it does</p>
<p>mean that there&rsquo;s certain Solutions if</p>
<p>you go off the wagon a little bit ways</p>
<p>to kind of reel it in and minimize the</p>
<p>agony uh that occurs when we cheat and</p>
<p>do things like that and I&rsquo;m being a</p>
<p>little facetious here but really it</p>
<p>makes a big difference in my life if I</p>
<p>eat like crap I feel like crap</p>
<p>you know I not that any of our followers</p>
<p>um ever would do that</p>
<p>um because they&rsquo;re they stay very very</p>
<p>strict all the time and they never</p>
<p>actually even go off the program but in</p>
<p>case they were forced at one point two</p>
<p>at gunpoint to come off the diet and eat</p>
<p>a Krispy Kreme donut</p>
<p>um I have a video what he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about I should we should probably even</p>
<p>put it in the in the link down below not</p>
<p>that any of you need it but it I show</p>
<p>you how to it&rsquo;s damage control what to</p>
<p>do if you accidentally slip occasionally</p>
<p>once a year and then you have to get</p>
<p>back on the wagon so all these different</p>
<p>things you can do to neutralize the</p>
<p>effects of sugar alcohol Krispy Kreme</p>
<p>Donuts</p>
<p>um Steve a long time ago I think this is</p>
<p>last week no it was a long time ago I</p>
<p>actually I did I ate one dozen donuts</p>
<p>so that was um disastrous so I did say I</p>
<p>will never do that again and that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>I have never done that again so</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s like smoking three packs of</p>
<p>cigarettes after getting caught your dad</p>
<p>doing it does have an effect but by the</p>
<p>way I just want to clarify the Hot Donut</p>
<p>sign was flashing I was powerless over</p>
<p>that went back so you have to put</p>
<p>blinders on uh when you go by uh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the Isle of sirens that will draw</p>
<p>you in the next thing you know anyway</p>
<p>enough about my weaknesses let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to social media uh Storm from YouTube is</p>
<p>keto safe for a seven-year-old with</p>
<p>unstable blood glucose levels</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the best thing for a seven</p>
<p>year old but maybe not do the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting maybe just three</p>
<p>meals a day but make sure it&rsquo;s a healthy</p>
<p>version but oh my goodness would that</p>
<p>help the blood sugars I mean think about</p>
<p>the average child consumes not just</p>
<p>regular junk food but it&rsquo;s called Ultra</p>
<p>processed junk food so they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>seriously refined carbs on steroids and</p>
<p>so if they could switch over wow would</p>
<p>it affect their life in a big way the</p>
<p>ability to learn your cognitive function</p>
<p>your mood your um your attention when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re studying things like that and</p>
<p>um overall outlook on health I mean huge</p>
<p>of course it took me a couple years to</p>
<p>change my ways in fact I changed when I</p>
<p>was 28 years old that&rsquo;s when I finally</p>
<p>changed over I&rsquo;m 32 now so you know</p>
<p>spend some years so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and also in the comments section if you</p>
<p>guys could just</p>
<p>just since we&rsquo;re on this topic write</p>
<p>down</p>
<p>out of all the foods that you&rsquo;re that</p>
<p>you could eat if you I mean if you had</p>
<p>permission to eat junk food wise what</p>
<p>would it be would it be a donut would it</p>
<p>be chips would it be Pizza what is that</p>
<p>thing that you could I mean would love</p>
<p>to eat if you could just put that in the</p>
<p>comments I&rsquo;m curious</p>
<p>um I think if I had to put something it</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>probably salty buttery popcorn that is</p>
<p>um made really you know healthily no</p>
<p>made um</p>
<p>um without all the GMO stuff of course I</p>
<p>would never do that but</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s my that would be my thing that</p>
<p>I would go to so go ahead and type down</p>
<p>below I&rsquo;m just curious</p>
<p>um and I&rsquo;ll read the comments later</p>
<p>all right Steve let&rsquo;s get back on track</p>
<p>okay and the best way to do that is to</p>
<p>pitch one out to our well-read audience</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s our first question for today</p>
<p>okay which nutrient deficiency can cause</p>
<p>you to hear your heart beat louder than</p>
<p>usual so let&rsquo;s say you put your head on</p>
<p>the pillow and you hear this pounding</p>
<p>boom boom boom you&rsquo;re hearing your pulse</p>
<p>rate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what deficiency is that</p>
<p>interesting okay I tell you what why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we now go over to our green room</p>
<p>and we have</p>
<p>um a well a new mommy she&rsquo;s got other</p>
<p>babies but she&rsquo;s got a brand new one</p>
<p>here and she&rsquo;s doing such a great job</p>
<p>trying to keep that little child uh</p>
<p>happy we&rsquo;re gonna put her on here first</p>
<p>so welcome everybody Jenny is coming to</p>
<p>us uh from uh Riverside California just</p>
<p>below uh good old Big Bear Mountain you</p>
<p>probably remember that uh doc so Jenny</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with the doctor go ahead with</p>
<p>your question</p>
<p>okay so um by the way I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>ketogenic with all my pregnancies and</p>
<p>breastfeeding and there&rsquo;s no issues for</p>
<p>people who might be worried about milk</p>
<p>supply and</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve never ever had to uh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a decrease in milk supply</p>
<p>at all so</p>
<p>um I started the ketogenic diet when I</p>
<p>was 20. I&rsquo;m 37 now and um the reason I</p>
<p>started it was for GI issues so not to</p>
<p>lose weight or anything and I noticed</p>
<p>when I first started I didn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>caffeine or Stevia and then a couple</p>
<p>years in I discovered Stevia and I</p>
<p>noticed that my blood sugar would crash</p>
<p>whenever I would use it and the same</p>
<p>kind of thing happened with caffeine</p>
<p>and so then I started kind of digging</p>
<p>around and noticed that Stevia and</p>
<p>caffeine stimulate insulin and they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily raise blood sugar</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um after I continue to use them for a</p>
<p>while I think my body kind of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I maybe I caused some insulin resistance</p>
<p>and then I was able to use them without</p>
<p>um a blood sugar crash so I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>kind of been curious because I do drink</p>
<p>a little caffeine and I do use Stevia</p>
<p>but I feel like in an ideal scenario</p>
<p>would we really</p>
<p>um want to avoid anything that might</p>
<p>stimulate insulin even if</p>
<p>um you know like caffeine Stevia I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read studies where some</p>
<p>bodybuilders will swish with mouthwash</p>
<p>before they work out to try to stimulate</p>
<p>insulin resistance in their muscles</p>
<p>muscle cells so I feel like just the</p>
<p>sweet taste alone must stimulate insulin</p>
<p>and my question is are we being too</p>
<p>nitpicky if we you know if I feel like I</p>
<p>need to really</p>
<p>the the ideal</p>
<p>have the ideal diet is that too nitpicky</p>
<p>caffeine and Stevia stimulate insulin</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s their insulin index I guess</p>
<p>very good question</p>
<p>um or questions uh you know</p>
<p>um one thing I want to bring up about</p>
<p>Stevie is it&rsquo;s so many times and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if this is your situation they</p>
<p>um to make the Stevie into a powder</p>
<p>to make the stevia into a powder they</p>
<p>have to use maltodextrin a lot of times</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um and sometimes</p>
<p>I know in Europe I don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>America they don&rsquo;t necessarily always</p>
<p>have to list it if it&rsquo;s less than one</p>
<p>gram per serving so</p>
<p>um it could be</p>
<p>um not necessarily your Stevia but it</p>
<p>could be the maltodextrin in that</p>
<p>ingredient</p>
<p>because even like a lot of the</p>
<p>supplements that they have put out there</p>
<p>even especially the citrates anything</p>
<p>citrates like potassium citrate</p>
<p>magnesium citrate they use maltodextrin</p>
<p>also with the flavorings use</p>
<p>maltodextrin so that&rsquo;s like a little</p>
<p>hidden thing that can definitely affect</p>
<p>glucose</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I think that it really depends on</p>
<p>how bad your insulin sensitivity is or</p>
<p>your resistances you know some people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a minor problem so they can get</p>
<p>away with it other people can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um and then also your goals like how um</p>
<p>how far do you have enough Health</p>
<p>Reserve to be able to to do that you</p>
<p>know maybe</p>
<p>occasionally some people can&rsquo;t afford to</p>
<p>do that they have to be strict but those</p>
<p>are the people that are usually not</p>
<p>strict</p>
<p>um so I&rsquo;m sorry sorry about that let me</p>
<p>just go ahead and turn that off sorry</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then you you had another question</p>
<p>you have Stevia and then the other</p>
<p>ingredient was um</p>
<p>you said two things Stevia caffeine yeah</p>
<p>caffeine stimulates</p>
<p>um noradrenaline and adrenaline</p>
<p>to some degree so it does activate the</p>
<p>adrenals and a little bit of cortisol so</p>
<p>that could that&rsquo;s probably mobilizing a</p>
<p>little bit more sugar in your glycogen</p>
<p>than you should it&rsquo;s not giving you</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>but it might be raising some things so</p>
<p>one of those things I would test it out</p>
<p>but I will say if you&rsquo;re just doing one</p>
<p>cup of coffee right and a little bit of</p>
<p>stevia yeah it might affect you at a</p>
<p>very small level that I wouldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>worry about it too much really it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>for the average person so yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah but I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing what you&rsquo;re doing I&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing breastfeeding I&rsquo;m really uh</p>
<p>glad that you&rsquo;re doing that because um</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just the healthiest kid for</p>
<p>your child and plus the keto yeah you</p>
<p>probably have some pretty serious</p>
<p>healthy kids</p>
<p>yeah and actually they do keto too for</p>
<p>the most part so and they are fine I</p>
<p>mean people are so afraid to deprive</p>
<p>their children of modified foods</p>
<p>oh my goodness yeah yeah that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too bad I&rsquo;m so glad that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>great that you came on and uh</p>
<p>hopefully I answered it</p>
<p>thank you so much yeah that&rsquo;s great so</p>
<p>she does a packet of Stevie I do four</p>
<p>Donuts which is equal to levels of</p>
<p>discipline here I&rsquo;m so pleased to be</p>
<p>like Jenny okay let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>answers uh from the first question our</p>
<p>astute audience uh let&rsquo;s see okay and</p>
<p>the question asks which nutrient</p>
<p>deficiency can cause you to hear your</p>
<p>heartbeat uh louder than usual like</p>
<p>something out of Edgar Allen Poe and 80</p>
<p>of the uh oops had jumped a little bit</p>
<p>Hardy response 80 responding and says</p>
<p>potassium deficiency 10 say magnesium</p>
<p>deficiency and finally 10 say A B</p>
<p>vitamin deficiency intelligence level</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to have seen my video on it</p>
<p>so um it&rsquo;s kind of buried so I will you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s not an easy answer but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>potassium a potassium deficiency</p>
<p>um the story was that when I was um</p>
<p>long ago when I went to this Italian</p>
<p>restaurant and I had um In America which</p>
<p>is very different than in Italy but I</p>
<p>had all this pasta pizza wine sweets</p>
<p>more sweets and more sweets and I drew</p>
<p>drove home and then I tried to go to bed</p>
<p>and I was hearing my my pulse rate bum</p>
<p>boom boom that is um a serious potassium</p>
<p>deficiency because when you have that</p>
<p>much carbohydrate in your body your body</p>
<p>is getting rid of this um sugar first</p>
<p>not necessarily trying to store it as</p>
<p>fat but to store it as stored sugar coal</p>
<p>glycogen so it&rsquo;s going to dump it in the</p>
<p>muscles in the liver and then it has it</p>
<p>needs potassium uh to store it so it</p>
<p>just sucked all the potassium out of my</p>
<p>blood I end up with uh</p>
<p>um low potassium and that affects the</p>
<p>heart rate because it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>potassium is like the governor of the</p>
<p>the heart so it can affect blood</p>
<p>pressure in the pulse rate and um so I</p>
<p>had this uh this shift of potassium from</p>
<p>my blood into the tissues</p>
<p>um still in my body but in not in a good</p>
<p>place where I can use it so if you</p>
<p>happen to accidentally eat all these</p>
<p>donuts and hear your pulse rate you need</p>
<p>potassium as the remedy</p>
<p>goodness sakes again folks watch that</p>
<p>video it&rsquo;s fascinating how to cheat and</p>
<p>get away with it no that&rsquo;s not the title</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that don&rsquo;t follow my don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>follow what I did okay let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>belt out the next question since the</p>
<p>audience 80 percent of them have</p>
<p>demonstrated that Brilliance here we go</p>
<p>okay true or false</p>
<p>regular sauna use can decrease all cause</p>
<p>mortality</p>
<p>wow okay audience dig into that let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to social media Rose from Facebook</p>
<p>I have high blood pressure and taking no</p>
<p>meds can I eat kimchi sauerkraut and</p>
<p>other fermented foods</p>
<p>I would highly recommend that I would</p>
<p>highly recommend that for sure</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>great Foods</p>
<p>fermented and um</p>
<p>blood pressure 90 percent of all types</p>
<p>of blood pressure is called essential</p>
<p>which is um what that means is they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what causes it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>idiopathic and so</p>
<p>I mean how could you have 90 percent</p>
<p>of blood pressure not having an unknown</p>
<p>cause you know they say it could be</p>
<p>related to Lifestyle well</p>
<p>um they don&rsquo;t really look at</p>
<p>um two really big factors well actually</p>
<p>three one is insulin resistance that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>big one number two</p>
<p>um potassium deficiency and vitamin D</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t look at those things and I</p>
<p>think the reason is because there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a lot of</p>
<p>um who&rsquo;s going to invest in that much</p>
<p>money in doing a study on something you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t patent</p>
<p>um and um unfortunately if you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>a study then it&rsquo;s not going to be on the</p>
<p>radar</p>
<p>and then people you know they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to actually endorse it so um but</p>
<p>in the meantime</p>
<p>um I think everyone needs to know some</p>
<p>of these alternative</p>
<p>uh viewpoints on health so they can try</p>
<p>them out for themselves</p>
<p>very good well today on usually all of</p>
<p>our guests our state side however we</p>
<p>have a huge contingent of folks watching</p>
<p>from around the world and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>evidence of that we&rsquo;d like to say good</p>
<p>morning on this Veterans Day by the way</p>

<p>Zimbabwe and all across these United</p>
<p>States America on as we again honor all</p>
<p>of our veterans that served here and</p>
<p>around the world and I tip our hat to</p>
<p>those all around the world that are</p>
<p>preserving freedom in their various</p>
<p>Armed Forces so we salute you with your</p>
<p>courage and bravery and so on anyway so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of folks listening Doc and</p>
<p>thank you all for making the show what</p>
<p>it is and let&rsquo;s go back to oh wow quiz</p>
<p>question number two is already been</p>
<p>tabulated it had asked true false</p>
<p>regular sauna use can decrease all cause</p>
<p>mortality and let&rsquo;s see 75 percent say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true and 25 percent say the heck</p>
<p>with the sauna</p>
<p>hmm you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I was actually surprised</p>
<p>um all cause mortality I mean that&rsquo;s yes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a true statement I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>incredible so</p>
<p>um another reason</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>do some sauna treatments</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m going to be doing a video today</p>
<p>on um what would happen</p>
<p>if you did</p>
<p>a couple weeks of uh sauna treatment</p>
<p>what are the benefits uh it&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>remarkable I&rsquo;ve talked about the cold</p>
<p>therapy jumping in a a cold Icy River</p>
<p>but somehow Steve found that too</p>
<p>uncomfortable so I decided to flip it</p>
<p>over to like maybe a warm sauna that</p>
<p>might be a little bit better for Steve</p>
<p>so I decided to do that video so that</p>
<p>stay tuned for that information as well</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait our little Health spot has</p>
<p>one I love it didn&rsquo;t know it was good</p>
<p>for you okay let&rsquo;s see Greg uh from</p>
<p>Facebook I am 68 with an enlarged</p>
<p>prostate I feel your pain you have said</p>
<p>consuming Dairy is not good for this</p>
<p>condition I have read that organic sheep</p>
<p>cheese like Feta might be okay your</p>
<p>thoughts Dr bird</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the challenge I mean the feta</p>
<p>cheese the Sheep cheese the goat cheese</p>
<p>is just awesome awesome product there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many great benefits from it however</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s hormonal uh factors there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>growth factors because think about the</p>
<p>purpose of this milk it&rsquo;s to grow</p>
<p>baby sheep baby cows and um</p>
<p>baby goats so um unfortunately for if if</p>
<p>your prostate is over swollen you might</p>
<p>may want to um look at that as something</p>
<p>that could potentially worsen it however</p>
<p>test it out you may be okay but you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have to do some type of test sometimes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um you can identify your urine flow</p>
<p>before and after you eat something so</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s one indication to see if it</p>
<p>you can do it or not but I will say the</p>
<p>benefits of uh especially European sheep</p>
<p>cheese or goat&rsquo;s cheese is um</p>
<p>fantastic fantastic so um</p>
<p>yeah the other thing with the prostate</p>
<p>too is um uh be careful of estrogenic</p>
<p>effects from things especially like soy</p>
<p>and also be careful about the other</p>
<p>anabolic hormone that makes things get</p>
<p>bigger and that is insulin</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um maybe you should focus on that first</p>
<p>because you might find a huge benefit to</p>
<p>the prostate when you start to lower</p>
<p>your insulin and get off the carbs</p>
<p>terrific okay our next guest is from</p>
<p>Wisconsin I know you love that state</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Lauren and she was a little</p>
<p>concerned that she didn&rsquo;t quite know how</p>
<p>to phrase her question so I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>help her she has a concern about her</p>
<p>metabolism so Lauren if you can in 30</p>
<p>seconds if you need to supplement what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said tell Dr Berg about your</p>
<p>concern so it&rsquo;s a metabolism issue</p>
<p>sure hi there good morning Dr Berg good</p>
<p>morning</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m always having problems</p>
<p>metabolizing fats and so I&rsquo;ve struggled</p>
<p>to get on keto</p>
<p>um yeah I&rsquo;ll just I&rsquo;ll say that I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember the specific detail that I</p>
<p>fired off to you</p>
<p>um but maybe I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that</p>
<p>okay uh what part of Wisconsin are you</p>
<p>from I&rsquo;m Milwaukee right by the lake oh</p>
<p>great yeah I have a lot of relatives</p>
<p>there I was raised in Kenosha Wisconsin</p>
<p>so no way yes yes for 18 years so um</p>
<p>yeah great place to grow up it does get</p>
<p>a little bit cold in Winter though</p>
<p>um so I think that um</p>
<p>um the thing that you need to look at is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like two things going on um one</p>
<p>is either you might not have enough bile</p>
<p>in your gallbladder or produced by the</p>
<p>liver because of some reason or it could</p>
<p>be something going on with the the</p>
<p>pancreas not making the lip base because</p>
<p>they all they both work together to</p>
<p>digest fats so if someone just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>digest fats</p>
<p>um I would add bile salts to the meal</p>
<p>right after the meal and see if that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t help you take like two two</p>
<p>tablets of a gallbladder formula or some</p>
<p>other bile cell the other thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very beneficial is to take choline</p>
<p>uh that&rsquo;s like part of bile and that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>help you digest fats as well there is a</p>
<p>genetic</p>
<p>um weakness that I&rsquo;m starting getting</p>
<p>into</p>
<p>this genetic testing lately and I found</p>
<p>some really I want to know more about it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be learning I&rsquo;ve been doing courses</p>
<p>on it and then I&rsquo;ll do videos on it but</p>
<p>if someone has like some type of</p>
<p>weakness within the genes to digest fats</p>
<p>um they they need you know more bile</p>
<p>salts and definitely choline and then</p>
<p>they can actually digest the fats but um</p>
<p>those are the things I would look at now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one more factor to this in order</p>
<p>to release the bile you also need an</p>
<p>acidic stomach so potentially it could</p>
<p>be you just need to add some betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride to your stomach before you</p>
<p>eat and so it stimulates your liver to</p>
<p>release more bile and produce more bile</p>
<p>but watch my videos on bio I have quite</p>
<p>a few but there&rsquo;s more to this topic but</p>
<p>I think you could eventually get it to a</p>
<p>point where you can handle you know a</p>
<p>decent amount of fats on the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so hopefully that helps you</p>
<p>ask one more thing</p>
<p>starting to do</p>
<p>is falling into that genetic category</p>
<p>and I have some evidence of it you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking other steps because I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched a slew of your videos and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned a ton</p>
<p>um what did I want to say what I wanted</p>
<p>to say is I think right now the most</p>
<p>beneficial portion of the keto fasting</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really fully doing keto just yet</p>
<p>has been the fasting the fasting is</p>
<p>fantastic it really helps calm my whole</p>
<p>system down so I&rsquo;m really grateful for</p>
<p>that oh that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>thank you yeah that&rsquo;s great thanks so</p>
<p>much the DNA testing it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very complex so I&rsquo;m going to try to make</p>
<p>it simple</p>
<p>um but to make it simple you have to</p>
<p>understand it very thoroughly and so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot to learn about it but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I did my my DNA test and uh uh found</p>
<p>some it doesn&rsquo;t tell you what&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>with you it just tells you where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>weak</p>
<p>weaknesses are which is beneficial so uh</p>
<p>now I have more information on what I</p>
<p>need to focus more on so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome so I&rsquo;ll be doing more videos on</p>
<p>that once I um learn all about it stay</p>
<p>tuned terrific next question please sir</p>
<p>all right the first sign of kidney</p>
<p>disease</p>
<p>is fill in the blank drum roll please</p>
<p>and by the way it takes 10 years after</p>
<p>you start getting this disease</p>
<p>until you ex usually feel a symptom</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>so what would be that first symptom that</p>
<p>you may experience with that disease</p>
<p>very good okay we always want to focus</p>
<p>on questions but we just got to throw in</p>
<p>uh some of these comments every once in</p>
<p>a while for instance from Tony on</p>
<p>YouTube thank you so much for all the</p>
<p>wealth of information you have shared it</p>

<p>else so an additional shout out to our</p>
<p>viewers in Russia Bulgaria Uganda</p>

<p>Tibet maritis martus oh I&rsquo;m butchering</p>
<p>it and of course Afghanistan which I can</p>
<p>pronounce so thank you folks for also</p>
<p>tuning in to the Dr Berg show uh Anna</p>
<p>Marie from Facebook Dr Berg you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>a great help I just finished treatment</p>
<p>for deep vein thrombosis I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following your keto program since</p>
<p>October 1 and have already lost six</p>
<p>kilograms thank you another thank you</p>
<p>from our audience</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s awesome all right</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see here oh by the way Terry said</p>
<p>pizza ice cream and chips are the</p>
<p>runaway leaders for our forbidden food</p>
<p>responses that makes me mad what about</p>
<p>Donuts</p>
<p>peace yeah yeah I can see that pizza ice</p>
<p>cream and chips</p>
<p>um well the good thing the good news is</p>
<p>you can have a you can have a keto</p>
<p>version of your pizza</p>
<p>uh as it ships some are a little more</p>
<p>difficult</p>
<p>um but there are like delicious kale</p>
<p>chips how about that I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>love that and uh ice cream there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of Keto recipes for ice cream too yes it</p>
<p>does take more time but um</p>
<p>you know I tried to make my own ice</p>
<p>cream I had a product out there</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it was a nightmare it was too hard</p>
<p>because when you have a product and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re shipping it</p>
<p>on ice</p>
<p>to someone&rsquo;s house first of all that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy expensive secondly</p>
<p>um if there&rsquo;s one thing that goes wrong</p>
<p>like um like happened to me where</p>
<p>um the trans uh you have to ship in an</p>
<p>um a refrigerator type truck right if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any problem with that</p>
<p>refrigerator in the truck at the other</p>
<p>end you get this ice cream that is</p>
<p>completely melted down to nothing</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um that was a very short little pilot</p>
<p>with the ice cream idea I&rsquo;m my best idea</p>
<p>in the world I must say that you let us</p>
<p>be guinea pigs and we sample a little</p>
<p>bit of it and it was fantastic I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>it was just so difficult to support but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything better</p>
<p>because Dr Berg really focuses on this</p>
<p>ingredients not the bottom line and I</p>
<p>mean that he pays a lot of money for</p>
<p>that stuff and that ice cream reflected</p>
<p>that but alas it ended up in a big</p>
<p>puddle and he uh moved on to the next</p>
<p>thing so thanks for that attempt uh Dr</p>
<p>Berg that was absolutely delicious let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see now let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>oh yeah he did that one oh here&rsquo;s a new</p>
<p>one thank you oh by the way quiz</p>
<p>question number three we&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>miss any quizzes this week and a quiz</p>
<p>asked the first sign of kidney disease</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>in uh 55 say yellow eyes 25 say dark</p>
<p>year dark urine ten percent say frequent</p>
<p>itchiness and 10 say swelling in the</p>
<p>lower extremities</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re all right about the symptoms</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something very specific that</p>
<p>I think is pretty surprising nocturia</p>
<p>you know what that is Steve uh yeah but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to tell the audience</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s uh the urge to urinate at</p>
<p>night</p>
<p>um now that&rsquo;s a very common symptom uh</p>
<p>getting up several times a night right</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re having to urinate that is</p>
<p>uh one of the first signs of kidney</p>
<p>disease so</p>
<p>um now it can it could be caused by</p>
<p>other things as well but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a crossover</p>
<p>to what the underlying cause of kidney</p>
<p>problems is and that would be uh the</p>
<p>diabetic uh nephropathy it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m going to do a video on but</p>
<p>um they both cross over so yes it is</p>
<p>related to insulin resistance</p>
<p>um but I think you should stay tuned for</p>
<p>the video on how to get rid of that</p>
<p>problem getting up at night and uh</p>
<p>urinating</p>
<p>so um the inability to hold your urine</p>
<p>through the night and be able to sleep</p>
<p>that would be uh the problem there so</p>
<p>stay tuned for that video but it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>definitely related to the kidney</p>
<p>all right we&rsquo;ll let begs for our next</p>
<p>question uh Doc and here it is</p>
<p>all right the memory indicator of kidney</p>
<p>disease on a urine test is</p>
<p>fill in the blank boom</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>we already read that sorry I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many great questions I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to pick out through them uh you</p>
<p>already told them the sauerkraut was</p>
<p>good uh oh here we go Dan excuse me Don</p>
<p>from Facebook just got my labs back and</p>
<p>everything is great except for my high</p>
<p>protein levels</p>
<p>um should I stay on the healthy keto if</p>
<p>program absolutely not oh let me let you</p>
<p>answer that</p>
<p>so um would that be a urine test or a</p>
<p>blood test or what kind of protein was</p>
<p>it uh albumin was it uh just regular</p>
<p>protein I need to know that but</p>
<p>um you know key this is what keto is</p>
<p>keto is low carb moderate protein okay</p>
<p>and higher amounts of fat so um</p>
<p>so if you do have uh this protein in</p>
<p>your urine you should probably just go</p>
<p>moderate protein</p>
<p>uh the best source of protein dietarily</p>
<p>is the egg but there&rsquo;s other good</p>
<p>sources too make sure you have enough</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid from either betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride or apple cider vinegar to</p>
<p>help you digest this protein</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>if you do have protein in the urine that</p>
<p>usually comes because your carbs are too</p>
<p>high sugar wise so and then someone says</p>
<p>should I go on keto well yeah that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>only thing you can do</p>
<p>um you don&rsquo;t want to go more carb you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to keep doing the carb thing</p>
<p>um and I&rsquo;m talking mainly about the</p>
<p>carbs that are related to causing</p>
<p>diabetes starches and refined carbs</p>
<p>things like that and sugars because I</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;ll get some</p>
<p>some counter to that someone will say</p>
<p>wait a second I eat carbohydrates I eat</p>
<p>salads I&rsquo;m like uh okay cool I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking about that it&rsquo;s uh mainly the</p>
<p>the other carbs that</p>
<p>uh can create that problem all right</p>
<p>very good last week we heard from</p>
<p>Virginia&rsquo;s husband Richard and he&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>cured of everything based on your oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right we don&rsquo;t care and this week</p>
<p>Virginia has a question for you Dr Berg</p>
<p>Virginia you&rsquo;re on with Dr Burke</p>
<p>good morning Dr Berg I do have</p>
<p>appreciation for all the research and</p>
<p>all that you have been pouring out and</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s benefiting me 15 months on a new</p>
<p>moderate protein and your Healthy</p>
<p>ketogenic diet but my burping issue</p>
<p>keeps coming up and from</p>
<p>um what you have been showing is that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>perhaps gallbladder formula I know that</p>
<p>I have water tea coffee the lemon</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um electrolyte drinks I do I burp so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to take a gallbladder</p>
<p>formula just one capsule before that and</p>
<p>it does seem to help this morning I</p>
<p>forgot I started burping just having</p>
<p>coffee and water</p>
<p>so I decided to do uh carnivore but with</p>
<p>the carnivore my blood sugar is going up</p>
<p>to like this morning I tested it as a</p>
<p>hundred and before that uh it was in the</p>
<p>80s and 90s</p>
<p>when I was on a healthy keto so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to keep the protein moderate like</p>
<p>10 ounces no more than that to give you</p>
<p>an example yesterday the only thing I</p>
<p>had was organ Meats uh just under the 10</p>
<p>uh not 10 grams 10 ounces</p>
<p>but my Sugar&rsquo;s going up so how do I do</p>
<p>this carnivore for a temporary time to</p>
<p>help with my psoriasis my gut issue</p>
<p>um well um yeah the question is how do</p>
<p>you keep your protein in a uh the right</p>
<p>range you have to increase your fats</p>
<p>um so how do you do that what foods are</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;d like ideally like</p>
<p>two to three to four times fat versus</p>
<p>protein that level ratio there so you</p>
<p>really have there&rsquo;s certain foods that</p>
<p>you have to eat like like certain</p>
<p>sausages</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>they have a lot of a lot more fat summer</p>
<p>sausage and other types of sausage</p>
<p>um and definitely the um</p>
<p>Pate you know they have um</p>
<p>different I know in Europe there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>more options in America it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>difficult but yeah that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem keeping your protein because</p>
<p>chances are your blood sugars are going</p>
<p>to be higher because of the uh</p>
<p>the extra protein will your body&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>turning it into body tissue so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no way to store it so it&rsquo;s going to turn</p>
<p>it into sugar uh eventually so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so as far as the burping goes</p>
<p>um if you</p>
<p>primarily with the gallbladder it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>burping with you when you eat a meal</p>
<p>versus drinking something if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking something and burping I think</p>
<p>um that could be a different thing</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mainly if you&rsquo;re eating food and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re burping a lot that would be the</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>the other thing to look at with you</p>
<p>especially from what you told me is um</p>
<p>another thing is choline choline is um</p>
<p>underrated</p>
<p>nutrient and that really helps a lot of</p>
<p>people with</p>
<p>kind of De burping and also the</p>
<p>gallbladder and thinning of the bile</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I did a genetic test and it just so</p>
<p>happens I have a problem with cholinks</p>
<p>myself so of course I&rsquo;m taking more of</p>
<p>it on a regular basis too but that</p>
<p>genetic test will pick up if you have a</p>
<p>a little mutation with that Gene that</p>
<p>just gives you a little weakness so what</p>
<p>happens when you&rsquo;re deficient in choline</p>
<p>is you um you could end up with the</p>
<p>fatty liver and that could affect the</p>
<p>bile production too so and choline in</p>
<p>the body actually acts like bile so</p>
<p>sometimes a combination of the bile</p>
<p>salts and the choline is a</p>
<p>like the secret</p>
<p>bullet that you can use to help yourself</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so anyway that&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just some things to think with</p>
<p>yeah going back to the meat what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>eating more is lamb and liver are those</p>
<p>not high fat do I need to add more fat</p>
<p>well it depends what cut you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using like uh there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s lean parts</p>
<p>of um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually you know what if you</p>
<p>eat a liver that&rsquo;s non-fatty you know</p>
<p>like I mean you have duck fat which you</p>
<p>know they actually make this product</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very very fatty like 10 times the</p>
<p>size of a normal which I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>get into that topic but</p>
<p>um typically</p>
<p>um there is more fat on liver</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>when you have a grass-fed liver it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a lot less fat it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be more protein and also um</p>
<p>you know maybe you have uh the type of</p>
<p>meats that you have</p>
<p>make sure you get the cuts that are just</p>
<p>a lot more fat you know less whatever</p>
<p>animal you use so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well listen Virginia</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re probably going to have to</p>
<p>add a little bit more fat to</p>
<p>um what you&rsquo;re eating and then see if</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t help you to kind of balance</p>
<p>out those calories all right so let us</p>
<p>know how that works out for Jenny we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait to have you back on give our</p>
<p>tip your hat to Richard your great</p>
<p>husband for us and uh off we go now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>uh oh uh when uh rajinit uh rad uh</p>
<p>Ranjit excuse me from Facebook any</p>
<p>advice for anyone suffering from</p>
<p>vitiligo</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s an autoimmune problem in</p>
<p>which I would take a lot of vitamin D</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s a stress component there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>adrenal saying you need to support your</p>
<p>adrenals with maybe something like</p>
<p>ashwagandha</p>
<p>um and um watch my video I have more</p>
<p>data on that topic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Steve I&rsquo;m going to be releasing another</p>
<p>video this week I just realized looking</p>
<p>at Jenny um holding her two beautiful</p>
<p>kids that I</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>well one of the videos um that I had to</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>um I also had to babysit that day so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see uh uh I did the entire video</p>
<p>actually holding my granddaughter so I</p>
<p>did the whole video so hopefully you</p>
<p>could actually even</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>get the information but it was a tricky</p>
<p>thing to do but I had to do it because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no other way</p>
<p>so stay tuned for that video</p>
<p>I just put Jenny her beautiful uh keto</p>
<p>babies up that was fun uh Jenny hope</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t seem too voyeuristic of us</p>
<p>but here let&rsquo;s give her one more look</p>
<p>looking kids so proud of her babies</p>
<p>thanks for sharing that with us Jenny</p>
<p>unwittingly you know we put you back up</p>
<p>uh anyway let&rsquo;s go on to the next uh</p>
<p>deal uh oh she looks so pleased with</p>
<p>beautiful babies okay uh Kelly from</p>
<p>Facebook is alcoholic neuropathy</p>
<p>different from other kinds of</p>
<p>neuropathies I don&rsquo;t see a video on your</p>
<p>channel on that condition</p>
<p>well think about</p>
<p>um what alcohol does to your nervous</p>
<p>system it just sucks the um the thymine</p>
<p>right out of your system the requirement</p>
<p>for thymine B1 goes so high anytime you</p>
<p>take a alcoholic um Advanced liver</p>
<p>disease you&rsquo;re always going to find a</p>
<p>serious problem with uh B1</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the time when sometimes doctors</p>
<p>will eventually check for it but</p>
<p>um yeah this is a different mechanism</p>
<p>than other other ways from it from</p>
<p>diabetic diabetic so you have um things</p>
<p>that can create um problems with</p>
<p>neuropathy uh you have alcohol you have</p>
<p>being a diabetic eating too much sugar</p>
<p>you could have chemotherapy create</p>
<p>create these problems so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different ways to get neuropathies but I</p>
<p>think the solution would just be the</p>
<p>same thing other than</p>
<p>cut down in alcohol but start taking</p>
<p>benphotamine that&rsquo;s my one of my</p>
<p>favorite nerve support</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>products out there and it&rsquo;s benphotamine</p>
<p>is a it&rsquo;s a synthetic B1 but it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any side effects</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fat soluble so it penetrates</p>
<p>the the nervous system and it&rsquo;ll help</p>
<p>rebuild the myelin sheath so you can get</p>
<p>your nerves back it&rsquo;s miraculous uh Ben</p>
<p>photamine is uh a pop there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>things you can use too but benphotamine</p>
<p>is a really good one is that one of your</p>
<p>product stock or just get that somewhere</p>
<p>else I do have it in the nerve support</p>
<p>formula</p>
<p>yes all right nerve support formula okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to our quiz questions the</p>
<p>astute audience got right back with this</p>
<p>one which asked the primary indicator of</p>
<p>kidney disease on a urine test is</p>
<p>and 78 of our respondents say high</p>
<p>creatine indicators and 12 say high</p>
<p>protein level indicators and 10 percent</p>
<p>um say</p>
<p>egfr or GFR indicators wow that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sophisticated</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re all right um it&rsquo;s a protein</p>
<p>and creatine is a protein</p>
<p>gratinine is a protein so you have that</p>
<p>and then also there is another indicator</p>
<p>which is a</p>
<p>decreased filtration rate which so I</p>
<p>think everyone had 100 on that because</p>
<p>there is you&rsquo;d also look at both of</p>
<p>those factors but but the protein the</p>
<p>urine is one of the suretail giveaways</p>
<p>that uh you have kidney problems so um</p>
<p>why is that because you know we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>born with about</p>
<p>a million little filters they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>nephrons these tiny little amazing</p>
<p>magical filters that are very different</p>
<p>than filters in your car because they</p>
<p>they keep recycling like like all the</p>
<p>fluid that you recycle like you might</p>
<p>drink Steve you might drink eight</p>
<p>glasses of water a day but your kidneys</p>
<p>are filtering</p>
<p>in a given day about</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 180 liters okay wow liters</p>
<p>of fluid so it&rsquo;s like recycled and</p>
<p>recycled and recycled and recycled and</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s amazing and so when you have</p>
<p>kidney disease you destroy these filters</p>
<p>so you may end up with a lot less</p>
<p>filters which means</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t filter what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>to this protein it&rsquo;s going to end up in</p>
<p>the urine</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s going to be since there&rsquo;s a hole</p>
<p>in the bucket you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>deficient of this protein in the blood</p>
<p>too so when you&rsquo;re deficient in the</p>
<p>blood some interesting things happen and</p>
<p>one being</p>
<p>edema and swelling all over the place so</p>
<p>your whole body is one big swollen ball</p>
<p>of inflammation because of this</p>
<p>imbalance of protein in your blood</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to be waterlogged and</p>
<p>your face will be puffy your eyes your</p>
<p>fingers your feet and um so I will be</p>
<p>releasing the video on the on the kidney</p>
<p>this week then I think it&rsquo;ll give people</p>
<p>a greater appreciation for their kidneys</p>
<p>and and maybe just maybe they may uh eat</p>
<p>better because of that to save the</p>
<p>kidney save your nephrons</p>
<p>wow audience please take care of your</p>
<p>kidneys that sounds absolutely awful</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m so proud of the audience</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been so lickety-split on the</p>
<p>questions we&rsquo;re going to get to the last</p>
<p>one in this week&rsquo;s show and there&rsquo;s our</p>
<p>final question for today</p>
<p>of all the foods</p>
<p>um that fight artery plaquing okay all</p>
<p>those Foods</p>
<p>which one is the most effective what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the best food overall</p>
<p>to help fight artery plaquing</p>
<p>all right well there&rsquo;s just too much</p>
<p>good news on the social media end for me</p>
<p>not to continue to mention it sharing</p>
<p>from Facebook I have dystonia sleep</p>
<p>disorder your keto and if system has</p>
<p>actually controlled my spasms and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>also lost 42 pounds</p>
<p>in four months thank you Dr Byrd boy</p>
<p>what a great story there&rsquo;s just a lot of</p>
<p>joy that comes out of these great</p>
<p>disciplines that you have researched so</p>
<p>hard okay let&rsquo;s see uh we talked about</p>
<p>prostates the pain in the prostate for</p>
<p>everybody</p>
<p>um oh let&rsquo;s see Jennifer from Facebook</p>
<p>is ketogood for Graves disease or an</p>
<p>overactive thyroid excuse me</p>
<p>yeah yeah I think I think it really</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>um I think also I would add two things I</p>
<p>would add a lot of vitamin D like</p>
<p>probably 30 or 40</p>
<p>000 international units of vitamin D as</p>
<p>well as doing the prolonged fasting</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really weird is some people get</p>
<p>this Graves and other people get</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s like which is a uh which is</p>
<p>the hypothyroid Graves is a hyper and um</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know why someone would get</p>
<p>one versus the other but both of those</p>
<p>conditions are really an immune problem</p>
<p>more than a thyroid problem and probably</p>
<p>it originated from the gut so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some leaky gut going on so you need to</p>
<p>work on that</p>
<p>but I would definitely</p>
<p>um get on keto for sure</p>
<p>and maybe even if there is gut issues uh</p>
<p>do the carnivore for a while because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know a lot of people have autoimmune</p>
<p>have sensitivities to like they can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>these uh 10 cups of salad a day for some</p>
<p>reason so they might um need to do</p>
<p>carnivore until they can kind of heal</p>
<p>the gut</p>
<p>um and this is a side note Steve I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just gonna throw this out there because</p>
<p>I did a video talking about Shifting the</p>
<p>time that you do your fasting to maybe</p>
<p>even try it out in the morning and then</p>
<p>at lunch and then not eat past that and</p>
<p>I said you know don&rsquo;t eat past three</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock right so I&rsquo;ve been experimenting</p>
<p>with that and I finally found something</p>
<p>that works for me</p>
<p>um not that you&rsquo;d want to do it but so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a big lunch okay do protein and</p>
<p>fat primarily but it&rsquo;s difficult to have</p>
<p>to add in that huge salad that I always</p>
<p>like sometimes which is like virtually</p>
<p>10 cups and if I&rsquo;m gonna do 10 cups I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to do 10 cups at like cabbage</p>
<p>leaf right if it&rsquo;s cabbage or other</p>
<p>types of vegetables that are</p>
<p>more dense you can cut that in half but</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re talking about lettuce sleeve</p>
<p>or aruga</p>
<p>arugula you can um I do my salad like at</p>
<p>three o&rsquo;clock so that way</p>
<p>um I have this huge salad with a lot of</p>
<p>stuff on it but I don&rsquo;t do a lot of</p>
<p>protein or fat</p>
<p>but I do that earlier so I have this</p>
<p>like 21 hour window of fasting which</p>
<p>works and it&rsquo;s kind of like one and a</p>
<p>half males because the salad is so small</p>
<p>calories so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>lately it seems to work really good and</p>
<p>it spreads out that time where I eat the</p>
<p>uh the protein in the salad just a tip</p>
<p>to see if you want to try to get your</p>
<p>Your Greens in there I I just feel</p>
<p>better when I do</p>
<p>um that salad probably because of the</p>
<p>amount of potassium and magnesium as</p>
<p>well as the feeding my microbes and the</p>
<p>phytonutrients that come along with it</p>
<p>which give you added benefits</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific well listen</p>
<p>next up or finally we&rsquo;re so grateful for</p>
<p>Cassandra to be so patient with us and</p>
<p>she appears to be freezing cold in</p>
<p>Houston she&rsquo;s gripping her um uh her</p>
<p>sweatshirt there I hope that you get</p>
<p>your heater fixed anyway Cassandra I</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s not the basis of your</p>
<p>question and you&rsquo;re on with uh Dr Byrd</p>
<p>you I&rsquo;m freezing all the time</p>
<p>um so I am a fitness and dance</p>
<p>instructor and</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve recently been diagnosed with</p>
<p>crohn&rsquo;s and bacteria fungus overgrowth</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>um got into the intermittent fasting</p>
<p>however I&rsquo;m having a hard time with diet</p>
<p>because of the fact that like Crohn&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and like candida the they contradict</p>
<p>each other so</p>
<p>um I guess one of my questions is since</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having such a hard time with diet</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unable to keep on weight like I</p>
<p>think in the last two weeks I&rsquo;ve lost 10</p>
<p>pounds</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m Having side effects to like apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar if I&rsquo;m taking electrolytes</p>
<p>my everything gets swollen if I&rsquo;m eating</p>
<p>anything with oils like olive oils or</p>
<p>fish</p>
<p>um getting swollen in the joints and so</p>
<p>I was kind of curious as to</p>
<p>is there some kind of I guess diet that</p>
<p>I might be able to try or is this so far</p>
<p>gone that I should give up and give into</p>
<p>the antibiotic world and then try</p>
<p>rebuilding my immune system that way</p>
<p>yeah very good question I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on I&rsquo;m glad you asked these questions</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the yeast</p>
<p>the candida the fungus the mold are all</p>
<p>in this family</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>mycobiota microbiota not the microbiome</p>
<p>not not the all the bacteria but the</p>
<p>mycobiota is all the the fungus families</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re all kind of related</p>
<p>um and so you have this overgrowth right</p>
<p>and what keeps those guys in check</p>
<p>what keeps those guys</p>
<p>is the bacteria okay so they both work</p>
<p>together so if you went to the road with</p>
<p>an antibiotic</p>
<p>you would go from bad to worse because</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll really have an overgrowth if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely sure you have this</p>
<p>um small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if you said that or not</p>
<p>but acebo are you sure you have that</p>
<p>uh what kind sorry for some reason it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all small intestinal bacterial</p>
<p>overgrowth where you have the</p>
<p>um a lot of bloating and uh</p>
<p>um the microbes in the small intestine</p>
<p>yes yeah yeah and so um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>one of the things when you take um</p>
<p>you know you have a sensitivity to oils</p>
<p>right which tells me</p>
<p>you you have you don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>stomach acid</p>
<p>the stomach acid is probably what</p>
<p>started the whole thing in the first</p>
<p>place you don&rsquo;t have enough hydrochloric</p>
<p>acid and so that way microbes can get</p>
<p>through the system and populate into the</p>
<p>wrong places number one and</p>
<p>um also</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to dry up your bile reserve</p>
<p>one of the purposes of bile</p>
<p>is to kill off as a detergent the my the</p>
<p>wrong microbes in your small intestine</p>
<p>as it comes to the intestines and then</p>
<p>it gets recycled at the end and it kind</p>
<p>of comes back so I know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in hydrochloric acid and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also deficient in bile so I know</p>
<p>that and you probably don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>diversify of microbes that you need</p>
<p>um to keep the candida in check</p>
<p>all right so what the heck do you do</p>
<p>right because um</p>
<p>you got a lot going on</p>
<p>um obviously I would definitely change</p>
<p>your diet to um I would probably do a</p>
<p>version of carnivore right now because I</p>
<p>think if you had too much greens that</p>
<p>may bloat you</p>
<p>and so we can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>um because you&rsquo;re going to be feeding</p>
<p>the microbes in the small intestine</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to compete for your</p>
<p>nutrition and they&rsquo;re going to like make</p>
<p>you deficient and you won&rsquo;t feel very</p>
<p>good so I would do a version of</p>
<p>carnivore uh but I would also at the</p>
<p>same time take bile salts</p>
<p>after you eat to help break down the</p>
<p>oils that you&rsquo;re going to have to have</p>
<p>or the fat with the carnivore</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and could you possibly tolerate</p>
<p>any type of fermented vegetables or no</p>
<p>so I just tried Sauerkraut last week and</p>
<p>I think the Crohn&rsquo;s reacted</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to feed microbes and fiber</p>
<p>into your small intestines so I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to do</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some garlic pills to kill off the</p>
<p>microbes as a natural antibiotic garlic</p>
<p>you can do thyme clove oregano</p>
<p>um as in tablets to kill off the uh the</p>
<p>sibo and then I think betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride I would play around with</p>
<p>that before the supplements so that way</p>
<p>you can start building up slowly and it</p>
<p>takes some time that hydrochloric acid</p>
<p>so you can start build that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be kind of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the ultimate way to correct this whole</p>
<p>thing over time and of course avoiding</p>
<p>sugar and things like that because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to feed the candida because</p>
<p>what happens you can start getting you</p>
<p>know the candida on the skin and</p>
<p>different areas and itchiness yeah my</p>
<p>gums are bleeding like crazy all of a</p>
<p>sudden and I&rsquo;m just like yeah</p>
<p>and when you say over time</p>
<p>like do you think that&rsquo;s like three to</p>
<p>six months or six or like a year to</p>
<p>three years no three to six months uh</p>
<p>and then you you keep like no sugar in</p>
<p>the diet and you just do the carnivore</p>
<p>and you do the um and play around with</p>
<p>the bile salts and and the betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride and then that will build</p>
<p>you up to the point where um and do a</p>
<p>lot of fasting because that&rsquo;ll actually</p>
<p>reset that your your intestine will be</p>
<p>cleaned out over when you fast so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to really help get the microbes</p>
<p>from the small intestine back into the</p>
<p>large bottle where they need to be</p>
<p>uh and then</p>
<p>um at that point you can start</p>
<p>repopulating with uh good bacteria once</p>
<p>your stomach is good because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to feed the ones in the small</p>
<p>intestine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a little complex but I would</p>
<p>watch my videos on the recent ones on</p>
<p>anything related to digestion because I</p>
<p>talk more about it</p>
<p>awesome awesome well thank you so much</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a difficult problem and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to get the right</p>
<p>information because there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of uh things out there that&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>put you in the wrong direction and oh</p>
<p>yeah I take this and like it gets worse</p>
<p>and oh my goodness so all right we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got uh our final contestant if you will</p>
<p>triumphi if I said that right from</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and uh giant they go ahead</p>
<p>with your uh quick question for Dr bird</p>
<p>go ahead you&rsquo;re on the air okay I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know good morning so I had</p>
<p>thyroid from my first pregnancy uh 10</p>
<p>years ago then I started taking thyroid</p>
<p>medication for hypothetism but I was</p>
<p>doing and taking the medication without</p>
<p>any fail but after that after 10 years</p>
<p>or something you feel that I&rsquo;m taking</p>
<p>overdose or the thyroid or in I need to</p>
<p>keep out of this or I need to keep going</p>
<p>for a lifelong medication so I tried</p>
<p>some other medications like I said the</p>
<p>and uh other things but nothing worked</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some reduced in the</p>
<p>thing but my TSH got go high however T4</p>
<p>and T3 is normal</p>
<p>but when after seeing my results my</p>
<p>mindset will go down okay something</p>
<p>going wrong like that because the TSH is</p>
<p>too high right</p>
<p>and in two years I had been followed</p>
<p>with vegan diet after that I felt some</p>
<p>nutritional deficiency for a B12 and</p>
<p>ferritin and vitamin D as well</p>
<p>so I had taken some supplements after</p>
<p>that there are some improvements on that</p>
<p>and again I go back to my normal night</p>
<p>with meat in it</p>
<p>now I feel I&rsquo;m trying some Alternatives</p>
<p>whether I need to skip my thyroid</p>
<p>medication and try the Alternatives like</p>
<p>ayurveda siddha are doing along with</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not sure did you say you have</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what they mentioned okay so</p>
<p>let me just give you some quick uh</p>
<p>advice on that and of course uh check</p>
<p>with you doctor but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>with Hashimoto&rsquo;s you got to be careful</p>
<p>about giving too much iodine</p>
<p>um because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really not usually</p>
<p>an iodine deficiency it&rsquo;s an immune</p>
<p>problem autoimmune where you definitely</p>
<p>need selenium for sure selenium that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>help you to build the glutathione to</p>
<p>help all the inflammation and the</p>
<p>counter the free radical damage that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>occurring</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be releasing a video on on</p>
<p>autoimmune stuff but</p>
<p>um I think with</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s kind of like they&rsquo;ll say</p>
<p>well you need to be on medication okay</p>
<p>how long do I have to be the rest of my</p>
<p>life does it ever correct it like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really causing my problem</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re right back to the autoimmune</p>
<p>and I would get Clues on what happened</p>
<p>just before you developed this condition</p>
<p>did you get pregnant did you go through</p>
<p>a stress some type of alteration might</p>
<p>have triggered this it could have</p>
<p>happened in the gut so I would</p>
<p>definitely work on the gut and see if</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t pull yourself out of the</p>
<p>situation vitamin D very very important</p>
<p>for any type of autoimmune I would start</p>
<p>taking that and then</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know when your thyroid stimulating</p>
<p>hormone this is how they diagnose the</p>
<p>thyroid is um too high or too low let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s too high</p>
<p>um then what&rsquo;s happened it&rsquo;s just not um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not connecting with the with the</p>
<p>thyroids and so there&rsquo;s some type of</p>
<p>problem with that and that could be</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s too much iodine in the</p>
<p>body or there&rsquo;s or there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem in the receptors but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to release a video on this one</p>
<p>topic autoimmune and actually it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be on iodine that&rsquo;s right watch the</p>
<p>one in iodine related to the thyroid and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you the full scoop because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re running out of time uh Steve did</p>
<p>we have one last question yes we do and</p>
<p>here it is it asked of all the foods</p>
<p>that fight artery plaquing which is the</p>
<p>most effective and our audience 65</p>
<p>percent of them say it&rsquo;s cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables 15 say celery by itself 10</p>
<p>say garlic and 10 say grass-fed foods</p>
<p>like butter meat or ghee</p>
<p>well this is interesting because</p>
<p>it is a cruciferous food but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fermented it&rsquo;s cabbage it&rsquo;s sauerkraut</p>
<p>now why would sauerkraut</p>
<p>help plaquing in the arteries well</p>
<p>sauerkraut is one of the few fermented</p>
<p>vegetables that is very high in vitamin</p>
<p>K2 normally K2 is in like the fatty</p>
<p>foods the animal products but you can</p>
<p>bacteria make it too so you get K2 K2</p>
<p>keeps the calcium out of the arteries</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>they have found</p>
<p>and this is interesting that um they</p>
<p>found bacteria</p>
<p>from your mouth and uh you know that</p>
<p>involved with um periodontal disease in</p>
<p>the plaquing in your heart they have</p>
<p>also found microbes</p>
<p>that should be in the gut in the</p>
<p>plaquing underneath the plaquing in your</p>
<p>heart because that plaquing is biofilms</p>
<p>which is a protective mechanism with</p>
<p>these microbes built up of calcium and</p>
<p>they tend to accumulate on roughened</p>
<p>edges or or if your arteries aren&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>smooth so</p>
<p>you know obviously maybe if I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>too much sugar or something that started</p>
<p>the whole process but there&rsquo;s biofilms</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s calcium there&rsquo;s um and it just</p>
<p>so happens that the lactic acid yeast in</p>
<p>the sauerkraut inhibits biofilms not to</p>
<p>mention out of all the foods that you</p>
<p>can eat sauerkraut has the most vitamin</p>
<p>C and vitamin C is also potent at</p>
<p>inhibiting biofilms</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>so I started looking at this and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like wow sauerkraut amazing for the</p>
<p>heart amazing for the gut which is also</p>
<p>good for the heart so um</p>
<p>I think most of you probably will should</p>
<p>have more appreciation for this uh</p>
<p>sauerkraut and maybe include that in</p>
<p>your diet uh for many reasons but um</p>
<p>anyway on that note I appreciate all</p>
<p>your attention stay tuned for more</p>
<p>videos this next week as well as next</p>
<p>Friday at the same time same place have</p>
<p>a great weekend</p>
