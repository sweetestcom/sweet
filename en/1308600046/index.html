    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Duncan French</p>
<p>as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Dr. French is the vice president of performance</p>
<p>at the UFC Performance Institute,</p>
<p>and he has over 20 years of experience</p>
<p>working with elite professional and Olympic athletes.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the UFC,</p>
<p>French was the director of performance science</p>
<p>at the University of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>And he has many, many quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>to his name, exploring, for instance,</p>
<p>how the particular order of exercise,</p>
<p>whether or not one performs endurance exercise</p>
<p>prior to resistance training or vice versa,</p>
<p>how that impacts performance of various movements</p>
<p>and endurance training protocols,</p>
<p>as well as the impact on hormones,</p>
<p>such as testosterone, estrogen,</p>
<p>and some of the stress hormones, such as cortisol.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also done fascinating work exploring</p>
<p>how neurotransmitters, things like dopamine and epinephrine,</p>
<p>also called adrenaline, can impact hormones</p>
<p>and how hormones can impact neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s particularly unique about Dr. French&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s figured out specific training protocols</p>
<p>that can maximize, for instance, testosterone output</p>
<p>or reduce stress hormone output</p>
<p>in order to maximize the effects of training</p>
<p>in the short-term and in the long-term.</p>
<p>So today you&rsquo;re going to learn a lot of protocols,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re into resistance training</p>
<p>or endurance training.</p>
<p>You will learn, for instance,</p>
<p>how to regulate the duration of your training</p>
<p>and the type of training that you do</p>
<p>in order to get the maximum benefit</p>
<p>from that training over time.</p>
<p>So whether or not you are somebody</p>
<p>who just exercises recreationally for your health,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re an amateur or professional athlete,</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re just trying to maximize your health</p>
<p>through the use of endurance and or resistance training,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s discussion will have a wealth of takeaways for you.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of people</p>
<p>working at the intersection of elite performance,</p>
<p>mechanistic science, and that can do so in a way</p>
<p>that leads to direct, immediately applicable protocols</p>
<p>that anybody can benefit from.</p>
<p>Dr. French also provides some incredibly important insights</p>
<p>about the direction that sport and exercise</p>
<p>are taking in the world today</p>
<p>and their applications towards performance and health.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3,</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs</p>
<p>in the sense that I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s any one substance or collection of substances</p>
<p>that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now, my conversation with Dr. Duncan French.</p>
<p>Duncan French, great to see you again.</p>
<p>Likewise, likewise, thank you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t often have many Stanford professors</p>
<p>in the Performance Institute, so I&rsquo;m really excited.</p>
<p>Oh, well, this place is amazing,</p>
<p>and you have a huge role in making it what it is.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m so excited to talk with you</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re one of these rare beasts</p>
<p>that you have been involved in human performance</p>
<p>and athletic performance at the collegiate level.</p>
<p>You are obviously very involved in MMA now</p>
<p>and the UFC Performance Institute.</p>
<p>And you also had the fortunate experience,</p>
<p>I like to think, of doing a PhD in,</p>
<p>what exactly was the PhD in?</p>
<p>It was exercise physiology.</p>
<p>Exercise physiology.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re familiar also with designing studies,</p>
<p>control groups, all the sorts of things that,</p>
<p>in my opinion anyway, are kind of lacking</p>
<p>from the internet social media version of exercise science,</p>
<p>which is that people throw out all sorts of ideas</p>
<p>about how people should be training,</p>
<p>what they should be doing,</p>
<p>and eating and not eating and doing.</p>
<p>And certainly, science doesn&rsquo;t have all the answers,</p>
<p>but I just think it&rsquo;s so rare to find somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s at the convergence of all those different fields.</p>
<p>And so I have a lot of questions for you today</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sure the audience</p>
<p>are going to be really interested in.</p>
<p>Well, listen, I mean, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very humbling.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;ve worked hard to get to where I am,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always tried to be authentic.</p>
<p>And I think authenticity comes alongside academic rigor</p>
<p>and objectivity and insight and knowledge base, right?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s about having confidence,</p>
<p>having expertise, and being able to deliver that expertise</p>
<p>to, in my world, to athletes.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always tried to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to have many strings to my bow</p>
<p>so that I can talk with many different hats on.</p>
<p>One day I&rsquo;m talking to a coach,</p>
<p>the next day I&rsquo;m talking to an athlete,</p>
<p>the next day I&rsquo;m talking to a CEO,</p>
<p>the next day I&rsquo;m talking to an academic professor.</p>
<p>So I think being able to wear those different hats</p>
<p>is certainly a skillset that I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>to build throughout my career.</p>
<p>And like I said, I&rsquo;ve been blessed to work with,</p>
<p>I think it was 36 different professional Olympic sports</p>
<p>last time I counted.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s been a wild ride.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been great.</p>
<p>Which of those sports was the most unusual?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with crown green bowling,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know, as an American guy,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how well you know that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of it.</p>
<p>Basically imagine a 20 foot by 20 foot square of turf</p>
<p>with a small raise in the middle, i.e. the crown.</p>
<p>So it slopes to the edges.</p>
<p>And then you throw out a white jack, a smaller ball,</p>
<p>and then you roll out larger balls</p>
<p>to try and get closest to the jack.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very European thing, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>But yeah, sports performance at crown green bowling,</p>
<p>there you go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Wow, and then to mixed martial arts fighters</p>
<p>and everything in between.</p>
<p>So along those lines,</p>
<p>could you give us a little bit of your background?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d you start out?</p>
<p>Where are you from originally?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m from the Northeast of England.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m from a town called Harrogate, which is in Yorkshire,</p>
<p>which is a Northern kind of area of the UK.</p>
<p>Nice sunny weather all year long.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can imagine.</p>
<p>Yeah, with the two weeks of summer that we get.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, I did my undergraduate studies there</p>
<p>in sports science.</p>
<p>I did teacher training</p>
<p>to be a physical education teacher after that.</p>
<p>Like most people, I then worked</p>
<p>as a high school physical education teacher.</p>
<p>Great experience working with kids,</p>
<p>developing athletic qualities.</p>
<p>But something in the back of my mind,</p>
<p>I wanted more.</p>
<p>I wanted to be at the higher end of elite sport.</p>
<p>I was a failed athlete like many people.</p>
<p>I represented my country in different sports and things,</p>
<p>but I never made it professionally.</p>
<p>So that little seed was sown in as much</p>
<p>as I then started to reach out to different areas</p>
<p>to do a PhD, whether it was in the UK</p>
<p>or also chance my arm took a punt,</p>
<p>see if we could get over to the States.</p>
<p>All my buddies were going on gap years</p>
<p>after they finished university or whatever</p>
<p>and going to Bali and hanging out or whatever,</p>
<p>traveling through Thailand.</p>
<p>And I figured, well, I&rsquo;ve always loved the States</p>
<p>and can I go and kill two birds with one stone</p>
<p>and do something academic, continue my studies,</p>
<p>but also do it in a different environment</p>
<p>and get some life experience.</p>
<p>And then many, many rejections,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re kind of aware</p>
<p>from different professors,</p>
<p>whether it was Roger Aranoka or William Cramer.</p>
<p>So you just wrote to these folks?</p>
<p>I just called, called, called</p>
<p>and sent out information and said, yeah,</p>
<p>so have you got any opportunities?</p>
<p>Pushed back from them all, but dogged and kept asking.</p>
<p>And yeah, Dr. William Cramer,</p>
<p>who was at Ball State University in Indiana at the time,</p>
<p>you know, a muscle neuroendocrinologist</p>
<p>and researcher in muscle physiology</p>
<p>using resistance training.</p>
<p>You know, he basically said, listen,</p>
<p>I can guarantee you funding</p>
<p>for the first year of your studies,</p>
<p>but not the next three.</p>
<p>Sounds like a typical academic response.</p>
<p>I can take care of you, but not that well necessarily.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I spoke to my parents and said,</p>
<p>hey, can we take a punt?</p>
<p>And they, you know, they were great in supporting me.</p>
<p>And yeah, long story short,</p>
<p>came out to begin my PhD at Ball State.</p>
<p>After a year, Dr. Cramer transferred to UConn,</p>
<p>you know, Connecticut in stores in the Northeast there.</p>
<p>And I transferred to him and with him and yeah,</p>
<p>four great years with my PhD</p>
<p>and getting my PhD with a really prolific research group</p>
<p>that looked at, you know, neuroendocrinology,</p>
<p>hormonal work, but using resistance training</p>
<p>primarily as an exercise stressor as a major mechanism</p>
<p>and then looking at all the different physiologies</p>
<p>off the back of resistance training.</p>
<p>Yeah. You guys were enormously productive.</p>
<p>I found dozens of papers</p>
<p>on how weight training impacts hormones</p>
<p>and your name&rsquo;s on all of them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s remarkable.</p>
<p>I have a question about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just inject a question about weight training</p>
<p>and hormones.</p>
<p>You hear this all the time</p>
<p>that doing these big heavy compound movements</p>
<p>or resistance training increases androgens,</p>
<p>things like testosterone, DHT, DHEA, and so forth.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how that actually happens?</p>
<p>Like what about, what is it about engaging motor neurons</p>
<p>under heavy loads sends a signal to the endocrine system?</p>
<p>Hey, release testosterone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never actually been able to find that in a textbook.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I mean-</p>
<p>And how can I do more of that?</p>
<p>As much as I know, you know, and again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m digging out into the annals</p>
<p>of Duncan French&rsquo;s kind of brain now,</p>
<p>but yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a stress response, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mechanical stress and it&rsquo;s metabolic stress.</p>
<p>And these are, you know, the downstream regulation</p>
<p>of testosterone release at the gonads</p>
<p>comes from many different areas.</p>
<p>My work primarily looked at, you know,</p>
<p>catecholamines and sympathetic arousal.</p>
<p>So things like epinephrine, adrenaline.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>Epinephrine, adrenaline, you know, noradrenaline.</p>
<p>How they were signaling,</p>
<p>that signaling cascade using, you know,</p>
<p>the HPA axis releasing cortisol,</p>
<p>and then, you know, looking at how that also influenced</p>
<p>the adrenal medulla to release, you know, androgens,</p>
<p>and then signaling that at the gonads.</p>
<p>That raises an interesting question.</p>
<p>So in presumably weight training in women,</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t have testes,</p>
<p>also it increases testosterone.</p>
<p>And is that purely through the adrenals?</p>
<p>When women lift weights,</p>
<p>their adrenal glands release testosterone?</p>
<p>Absolutely, I mean, that is the only area</p>
<p>of testosterone release for females.</p>
<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s the same downstream cascade.</p>
<p>Obviously the extent to which it happens</p>
<p>is significantly less in females,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s how you, there&rsquo;s good data out there</p>
<p>that shows, you know, females can increase</p>
<p>their anabolic environment,</p>
<p>their internal anabolic milieu,</p>
<p>using resistance training as a stressor.</p>
<p>And then they get the consequent muscle tissue growth,</p>
<p>you know, whether it&rsquo;s tendon, ligament adaptations,</p>
<p>you know, the beneficial consequences of resistance training</p>
<p>which is driven by anabolic stimuli.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have two questions about that.</p>
<p>The first one is something that you mentioned,</p>
<p>which is that the androgens, the testosterone</p>
<p>comes from the adrenals under resistance loads in women.</p>
<p>Is the same true in men?</p>
<p>I mean, we hear that the testes produce testosterone</p>
<p>when we weight train for men that have testes,</p>
<p>but do we know whether or not it&rsquo;s the adrenals</p>
<p>or the testes in men that are increasing testosterone?</p>
<p>More or both, a little bit from each?</p>
<p>The field is divided presently.</p>
<p>And as much as understanding the acute adrenergic response</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, anabolic response to exercise</p>
<p>in an acute phase and the exposure to, you know,</p>
<p>a stimulus that is stress-driven,</p>
<p>which might be partly from the adrenal glands,</p>
<p>partly from the gonads, versus a longitudinal exposure</p>
<p>to anabolic environments, which is primarily driven</p>
<p>by obviously the gonads and the release,</p>
<p>the endocrine environment from testosterone release</p>
<p>at the gonads.</p>
<p>So the field is split in terms of how exercise</p>
<p>is promoting hypertrophy, you know, muscle tissue growth,</p>
<p>and whether that is very much an adrenal stimuli</p>
<p>or if that&rsquo;s significant enough in these acute responses</p>
<p>versus the longitudinal exposure,</p>
<p>just elevated basal levels of anabolic testosterone</p>
<p>at a virtual level.</p>
<p>So it sounds like with most things, it&rsquo;s probably both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the adrenals and the gonads.</p>
<p>And then you mentioned that testosterone</p>
<p>can have enhancing effects or growth effects</p>
<p>on tendon and ligament also.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t often hear about that.</p>
<p>People always think, you know, testosterone muscle,</p>
<p>but testosterone has a lot of effects on other tissues</p>
<p>that are important for performance, it sounds like.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story there?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, you know, the testosterone hormone is,</p>
<p>I mean, listen, there&rsquo;s androgen receptors</p>
<p>on neural tissue, on neural axons.</p>
<p>Pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, you know, the binding capacity of testosterone</p>
<p>and influencing different tissues within the body,</p>
<p>I touched on, you know, muscle tissue,</p>
<p>but, you know, the ligaments, the tendons,</p>
<p>and even bone to some extent, you know,</p>
<p>testosterone has potential to influence that</p>
<p>in terms of removing osteopenic kind of characteristics,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it&rsquo;s a magic hormone, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>with many end impacts in terms of adaptation.</p>
<p>I definitely want to get back to your trajectory,</p>
<p>but as long as we&rsquo;re on the interactions</p>
<p>between androgens, testosterone,</p>
<p>and its derivatives and different tissues,</p>
<p>you know, from the work that you did as a PhD student</p>
<p>and throughout your career,</p>
<p>could you say that there&rsquo;s some general principles</p>
<p>of training that favor testosterone production</p>
<p>in terms of, that somebody who&rsquo;s not an elite athlete</p>
<p>could use, somebody who&rsquo;s already adapted</p>
<p>to weight training somewhat,</p>
<p>like they know the difference between a dumbbell</p>
<p>and a barbell, and they know the various movements,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to damage themselves,</p>
<p>but once they&rsquo;re doing that, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard shorter sessions are better than longer sessions,</p>
<p>but in rep loads, there&rsquo;s a lot of parameter space,</p>
<p>but if you were going to throw out some of the parameters</p>
<p>that you think are most important to pay attention to</p>
<p>for the typical person who&rsquo;s trying to use weight training</p>
<p>to build or maintain muscle, lose body fat,</p>
<p>so body recomposition, and or stay strong and healthy</p>
<p>for sport of a different kind.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the work that we obviously, you know,</p>
<p>I was exposed to back in my PhD,</p>
<p>it was a double-edged sword,</p>
<p>and as much as testosterone is really stimulated</p>
<p>by an intensity factor and also a volume factor.</p>
<p>Now, growth hormone is a little bit different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s largely driven by an intensity factor alone.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>I just thought that growth hormone was driven by volume,</p>
<p>which just goes to show you-</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ve got it wrong.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, I think you&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>It just goes to show you that most of what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>on the internet is completely,</p>
<p>not only is it wrong, it&rsquo;s usually backwards.</p>
<p>So, no, trust your instinct,</p>
<p>because I think people just make this stuff up, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very hard to measure growth hormone</p>
<p>and testosterone, and I can&rsquo;t imagine most of the stuff</p>
<p>that I see out there, they&rsquo;re taking drips</p>
<p>and measuring free versus bound</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what you do in laboratories.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, you look at total composition,</p>
<p>then you look at how much of that is free circulating</p>
<p>in the system, how much is bound,</p>
<p>and therefore biologically active,</p>
<p>bound to receptor creating adaptation.</p>
<p>But yeah, coming back to testosterone</p>
<p>in terms of the training strategies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s largely driven by both an intensity</p>
<p>and a volume factor.</p>
<p>So, if you look at many of the exercise interventions</p>
<p>that we use to try and investigate</p>
<p>and interrogate testosterone,</p>
<p>it was usually a six by 10 protocol.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re touching at about-</p>
<p>Six by 10, meaning?</p>
<p>Yeah, six sets of 10 repetitions,</p>
<p>which is quite a large, you know, 60 repetitions</p>
<p>is quite a large volume for a single exercise,</p>
<p>and that was usually pitched at about 80%</p>
<p>of a one repetition max intensity.</p>
<p>Okay, so 80% of the one rep max,</p>
<p>six sets of 10 reps separated by rest of like-</p>
<p>Two minutes.</p>
<p>Two minutes, which is actually pretty fast,</p>
<p>at least to me.</p>
<p>Anytime you see these two to three minutes</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually watching the clock,</p>
<p>those two minute rest periods go by pretty fast.</p>
<p>By the third, fourth set, you&rsquo;re dying for more.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, we formulated</p>
<p>that kind of exercise protocol to really target,</p>
<p>you know, the release of testosterone</p>
<p>and try and drive up these anabolic environments</p>
<p>to study the endocrine consequences.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s the type of protocol</p>
<p>that is most advantageous for driving anabolic environment.</p>
<p>And that was it for the workout?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, we would do that in a back squat.</p>
<p>So, you know, multi-joint, you know, challenging exercise,</p>
<p>multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% loads</p>
<p>of your one repetition max, and then six by 10.</p>
<p>We did play around with, you know,</p>
<p>your classic German volume type 10 by 10 kind of protocols,</p>
<p>but they were just unsustainable at that 80%.</p>
<p>The key to what we also did was we always adjusted</p>
<p>the loads to make sure that it was 10 repetitions</p>
<p>that were sustained.</p>
<p>So if the load was too high and an athlete</p>
<p>or a participant had to drop the weights</p>
<p>on the sixth repetition, we would unload the bar</p>
<p>and make sure they completed the 10 repetitions.</p>
<p>Bringing me back to the point of it&rsquo;s an intensity</p>
<p>and a volume derivative that is going to be</p>
<p>most advantageous for testosterone release.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>And one thing that you mentioned there</p>
<p>is especially interesting to me, which is you said,</p>
<p>when you go from six sets of 10 repetitions</p>
<p>to 10 sets of 10 repetitions, it&rsquo;s not as beneficial</p>
<p>and might even be counterproductive.</p>
<p>But to me, the difference between six and 10 sets</p>
<p>is only four sets.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even sound that much.</p>
<p>So that sort of hints at the possibility</p>
<p>that the thresholds for going from a workout</p>
<p>that increases testosterone to a workout</p>
<p>that diminishes testosterone</p>
<p>is actually a pretty narrow margin.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think it comes back</p>
<p>to that intensity factor then.</p>
<p>What we saw, that 10 by 10 protocol</p>
<p>really sees pretty significant drop-offs in the load.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re trying to stimulate with intensity,</p>
<p>with mechanical strain through intensity,</p>
<p>as well as metabolic strain through volume.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the paradigm that you&rsquo;ve got to look at</p>
<p>is that the mechanical load has to come from</p>
<p>the actual weight on the bar</p>
<p>and the volume is the metabolic stimulus.</p>
<p>How much are we driving lactate?</p>
<p>How much are we driving glycogenolysis</p>
<p>in terms of that type of energy system</p>
<p>for executing a 10 by 10 protocol?</p>
<p>And what we often saw was just a significant reduction</p>
<p>in the intensity capabilities of an athlete to sustain that.</p>
<p>So we shortened the volume</p>
<p>to try and maintain the intensity.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And you could imagine just taking very long rest,</p>
<p>keeping the session, being a big lazy bear in training.</p>
<p>I sometimes do this.</p>
<p>I tell myself I&rsquo;m going to work out for 45 minutes</p>
<p>and then two hours later, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>But not because I was huffing and puffing the whole time,</p>
<p>but because I was training really slowly.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that training slowly</p>
<p>can offset some of the negative effects</p>
<p>of doing a lot of volume?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s an old adage of, you know,</p>
<p>two responses to your question.</p>
<p>I mean, the first one I would say, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference between 10 sets of six</p>
<p>and six sets of 10.</p>
<p>And I think that comes back to the volume conversation.</p>
<p>You know, six sets of 10 is driving up metabolic stimulus.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing 10 sets of six,</p>
<p>you can probably take it to a higher intensity,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not going to get the same metabolic load.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get the same</p>
<p>internal metabolic environment</p>
<p>that drives the lactate release</p>
<p>that they will then signal, you know,</p>
<p>further anabolic testosterone release</p>
<p>because of the lactate in your body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a key consideration.</p>
<p>The rest is often the consideration that&rsquo;s overlooked</p>
<p>out there in general population</p>
<p>and in many sporting environments.</p>
<p>You know, that the rest is as important</p>
<p>a programming variable as the load</p>
<p>and the intensity of the load, the volume, et cetera.</p>
<p>And yes, if you extend the volume,</p>
<p>if you extend the duration of your rest periods,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re ultimately doing</p>
<p>is influencing that metabolic stimulus.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re allowing the flushing of the body,</p>
<p>the removal of waste products, you know,</p>
<p>lactate to be, you know, removed from the body</p>
<p>and then the metabolic environment is reduced.</p>
<p>So you want, so if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>you want to create a metabolic stress.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So the way that I&rsquo;ve been training, slow and lazy,</p>
<p>is not necessarily the best way to go.</p>
<p>I could, in theory, do a 45 or 60 minute session</p>
<p>where I pack in more work per unit time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be able to quote unquote perform as well.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be able to lift as much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to unweight the bar between sets</p>
<p>or maybe even during sets</p>
<p>if I have someone who could do that.</p>
<p>But it sounds like that&rsquo;s the way to go.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got to be,</p>
<p>so this, the old adage of high intensity, short duration</p>
<p>is probably the way to go.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And you know, in layman&rsquo;s terms,</p>
<p>if the same objective, the same training goal</p>
<p>is just muscle tissue growth,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not talking about maximal strength</p>
<p>or any of those type of parameters,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just talking about growing muscle.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s an athlete A</p>
<p>and they do six sets of 10 with two minutes rest</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s athlete B that does six sets of 10</p>
<p>with three minutes rest,</p>
<p>athlete A will likely see the highest muscle gains,</p>
<p>muscle hypertrophy gains.</p>
<p>Because of the metabolic stimulus that they&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>with the shorter rest periods.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And for all the years that I&rsquo;ve spent</p>
<p>exploring exercise science</p>
<p>and trying to get this information from the internet</p>
<p>and various places,</p>
<p>that this is the first time it&rsquo;s ever been</p>
<p>told to me clearly.</p>
<p>So basically I need to put my ego aside</p>
<p>and I need to not focus so much on getting as many reps</p>
<p>with a given weight and keep the rest restricted</p>
<p>two minutes, about two minutes,</p>
<p>get the work in and then I&rsquo;ll derive the benefits.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve absolutely nailed it to be honest.</p>
<p>And again, if you think about human nature</p>
<p>and how we approach,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re inherently lazy, right?</p>
<p>As humans, we want to take that rest.</p>
<p>We want to take the time out to recover and feel refreshed,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re trying to create a training stimulus.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to create a very specific stimulus</p>
<p>internal to the body.</p>
<p>And that is often driven by the metabolic environment</p>
<p>at that moment in time.</p>
<p>Now, if we allow the metabolic environment to change</p>
<p>by extending the rest periods,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to see as beneficial gains</p>
<p>at the end of it.</p>
<p>So it is very much a motivational and ego thing</p>
<p>rather than saying, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to push my loads as high as I can</p>
<p>and really challenge maximal strength,</p>
<p>do fewer repetitions, take longer periods of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely different approach to training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different end goal.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And you mentioned lactate.</p>
<p>So it seems still a bit controversial</p>
<p>as to what actually triggers hypertrophy.</p>
<p>You hear about lactate buildup or people,</p>
<p>the common language is the muscle gets torn and then repairs,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, does the muscle actually tear?</p>
<p>I mean, microtrauma.</p>
<p>Okay, microtrauma.</p>
<p>Disruption of, you know, within the muscle tissue.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re talking now about non-drug assisted people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s just say, let&rsquo;s define our terms here,</p>
<p>whose testosterone levels are within the range</p>
<p>of somewhere between 300 and 1,500 or whatever, 1,200.</p>
<p>Because it does seem that athletes</p>
<p>who take high levels of exogenous androgens</p>
<p>can do more work and just get protein synthesis</p>
<p>from just doing work, you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen these guys in the gym, right?</p>
<p>The telltale signs are not that hard to spot</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just doing a ton of volume,</p>
<p>not necessarily moving that much weight.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just bringing blood into the tissue.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re loading up on,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating a ton of protein,</p>
<p>presumably because they&rsquo;re basically in puberty part 15.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in their 15th round of puberty</p>
<p>where during puberty, you are a protein synthesis machine.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, that&rsquo;s pretty clear about puberty.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So, and then in terms of,</p>
<p>because I know the audience likes to try protocols,</p>
<p>so you described a protocol very nicely.</p>
<p>What about day-to-day recovery?</p>
<p>I mean, the workout that you described is intense but short.</p>
<p>How many days a week can the typical person do that</p>
<p>and sustain progress?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think that comes back to your training age</p>
<p>and your training history.</p>
<p>Obviously there&rsquo;s a resilience and a robustness</p>
<p>with an incremental training age.</p>
<p>So, you know, that&rsquo;s not a protocol</p>
<p>that I would advise anyone to go out and start tomorrow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be mopping them off the gym floor.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it&rsquo;s also relative, right?</p>
<p>So 80% of your maximum at a young training age</p>
<p>is still 80% versus, you know, I&rsquo;ve been training 10 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still 80%.</p>
<p>But yes, the mechanical load is gonna be significant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more tonnage, right?</p>
<p>But yeah, I think a protocol like that,</p>
<p>we would look at two times a week,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s pretty intensive like that.</p>
<p>Because again, it comes back to the point you make,</p>
<p>is that you really need to be, for want of better terms,</p>
<p>suffering a little bit through that type of protocol,</p>
<p>both in terms of the challenge of the load,</p>
<p>but also being able to tolerate the metabolic stress</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re exposed to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, a bit of a sicko feeling, right?</p>
<p>Because of the lactate that you&rsquo;re driving up.</p>
<p>So, you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t promote an athlete</p>
<p>doing that type of modality, you know,</p>
<p>multiple, multiple times,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re from the realms of bodybuilding,</p>
<p>and then you really, that&rsquo;s the sole purpose</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Most athletes in most sports have diverse requirements</p>
<p>in terms of outcomes that they&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just targeting muscle growth.</p>
<p>Muscle growth is a conduit to increased strength,</p>
<p>increased power, increased speed, obviously.</p>
<p>So yes, trying to get bigger cross-sectional area</p>
<p>of a muscle means that we can produce more force</p>
<p>into the ground or wherever it may be</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re a locomotive athlete.</p>
<p>But usually, sports men and women</p>
<p>are not just purely seeking muscle growth.</p>
<p>They look for different facets of muscle endurance</p>
<p>or maximal muscle power, muscle strength, you know?</p>
<p>So then you&rsquo;ve gotta be very creative</p>
<p>in how you build the workout.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a bodybuilder, absolutely.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re chasing muscle growth,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna do so with these types of protocols,</p>
<p>which sees high intensities and high volumes of workload</p>
<p>on a pretty regular basis.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just somebody, you know, a weekend warrior</p>
<p>that wants to keep in shape and look good,</p>
<p>I would say, you know, two times a week</p>
<p>for a really challenging workout like that,</p>
<p>and then flex the other types of workouts within the week</p>
<p>to have more of a volume emphasis,</p>
<p>where you reduce the intensity,</p>
<p>and you might just look at, you know,</p>
<p>larger rep ranges from 12 to 15 to 20.</p>
<p>Another workout where you&rsquo;re looking at, you know,</p>
<p>reducing the volume, but increasing the intensity,</p>
<p>and really trying to drive, you know, different stimulus</p>
<p>to give you more end points of success.</p>
<p>Great, no, that&rsquo;s really informative.</p>
<p>Along the lines of androgens and intensity,</p>
<p>when I think intensity, I think epinephrine, adrenaline.</p>
<p>And since you have a background</p>
<p>in catecholamines and testosterone,</p>
<p>last time I was here at the UFC Performance Institute,</p>
<p>we had a brief conversation,</p>
<p>and I want to make sure I got the details right,</p>
<p>that in the short term, a big increase in stress hormone</p>
<p>can lead to an increase in testosterone,</p>
<p>like a parachute jump.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So stress can promote the release of testosterone.</p>
<p>That was news to me.</p>
<p>We always hear about stress suppressing testosterone,</p>
<p>stress suppressing the immune system,</p>
<p>all these terrible things.</p>
<p>But in the short term, you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>it can actually increase the release of testosterone.</p>
<p>So I have that right?</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>And so then the second question is,</p>
<p>does my cognitive interpretation of the stressor</p>
<p>make a difference?</p>
<p>In other words, if I voluntarily jump out of a plane</p>
<p>with a parachute, does it have a different effect</p>
<p>on my testosterone than if you shove me out of the plane</p>
<p>against my will, or presumably with a parachute, too?</p>
<p>I mean, so this was what all my PhD work was looking at,</p>
<p>was the exposure to a stressor and the pre-arousal</p>
<p>of how your body essentially prepares for that stressor,</p>
<p>and then how it manages it</p>
<p>throughout the exposure to the stress.</p>
<p>And it was actually motivated from parachute jumpers.</p>
<p>There was an older study looking at parachute jumpers</p>
<p>into combat, and they were studying the cortisol,</p>
<p>the stress response, and the epinephrine response</p>
<p>of these parachute jumpers.</p>
<p>So it got us thinking about, hold on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain workouts that you do</p>
<p>that are just, they&rsquo;re daunting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, it&rsquo;s squat Saturday or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, this is going to destroy me.</p>
<p>Or I have to talk to this person I don&rsquo;t want to talk to,</p>
<p>or, you know, right?</p>
<p>I mean, something, or a PhD dissertation exam</p>
<p>or something, yeah.</p>
<p>Giving public speaking or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>Now, we used an exercise,</p>
<p>we used a resistance training protocol</p>
<p>that these athletes knew was going to be</p>
<p>very, very challenging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to have some anxiety to doing it.</p>
<p>They knew there were going to be</p>
<p>some physical distress from doing it.</p>
<p>And therefore, you know, their mindset</p>
<p>of how they were going to approach that was already set.</p>
<p>So what we saw prior,</p>
<p>15 minutes prior to the start of an exposure to the workout,</p>
<p>the epinephrine, the neuroadrenaline,</p>
<p>the adrenaline was already starting</p>
<p>to prepare the body sympathetically</p>
<p>to go into what it knew was going to be</p>
<p>a very, very challenging workout.</p>
<p>So that brings you back to, you know,</p>
<p>exercise preparation, competition for certain preparation,</p>
<p>preparation for certain competition, excuse me.</p>
<p>And, you know, pre-workout routines,</p>
<p>the use of music, you know,</p>
<p>all these different things that we know can now,</p>
<p>you know, anecdotally in the gym we put into place.</p>
<p>But, you know, the data that I presented</p>
<p>showed that it was the first of its kind</p>
<p>to show that this link between, you know,</p>
<p>epinephrine and norepinephrine release and arousal,</p>
<p>and then consequent performance,</p>
<p>so force output throughout the workout</p>
<p>was intimately linked.</p>
<p>So what was the takeaway there?</p>
<p>Should, is it beneficial for people</p>
<p>to get a little stressed about the upcoming impending event,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a lift in the gym</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s talking to somebody</p>
<p>that you might be intimidated to talk to or at an exam?</p>
<p>Is the stress good for performance or is it harmful?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And I think I can only talk to, you know,</p>
<p>physical exertion, which is what we were exploring.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to tread on the toes of the psychologists</p>
<p>with flow state and these types of things,</p>
<p>because clearly-</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re in the position</p>
<p>of scientific strength on this one.</p>
<p>I think you have the leverage.</p>
<p>I mean, most, you know,</p>
<p>I have a lot of friends in that community,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ll just say as a buffer</p>
<p>to the answer you&rsquo;re about to give,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s very little science around flow,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s very little neuroscience</p>
<p>related to most psychological states anyway.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ve got a lot of degrees of freedom here.</p>
<p>All right, I can breathe easy.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be anything you like, credit Duncan,</p>
<p>anything you dislike, send the mean comments to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think from my data, certainly,</p>
<p>the greater the arousal, the higher the performance was</p>
<p>from a physical exertion perspective.</p>
<p>And I think that was the intriguing part</p>
<p>of some of my findings,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s definitely an individual biokinetics</p>
<p>to some of these hormonal kind of releases.</p>
<p>And as much as those guys that had the highest,</p>
<p>you know, adrenergic response</p>
<p>in terms of epinephrine release,</p>
<p>norepinephrine release,</p>
<p>also sustained force output</p>
<p>for a longer period of the workout than those that didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the individuals that had a lower stimulus</p>
<p>of the sympathetic arousal, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>certainly didn&rsquo;t perform as well throughout the workout.</p>
<p>Now the intriguing thing then becomes is,</p>
<p>okay, and I think this, you know,</p>
<p>really segues into what we&rsquo;re doing here</p>
<p>with combat athletes, with mixed martial artists.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a philosophy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a paradigm now for myself</p>
<p>in terms of the exposure, repeat exposure.</p>
<p>You know, the more you do that challenging workout,</p>
<p>do you get the same psychological stimulus?</p>
<p>Do you still get the same stress response?</p>
<p>And the assumption is unlikely.</p>
<p>You know, you accommodate,</p>
<p>you become accustomed to the stress,</p>
<p>so your body will therefore adapt.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the classic overload principle, right?</p>
<p>You then need to take the stressor down a different route.</p>
<p>But I think when you look at, you know,</p>
<p>the athletes that we work with here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fist fight at the end of the day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing more stressful than that.</p>
<p>But I think just the exposure to the rigors of training,</p>
<p>to understand the bad positions, the bad situations,</p>
<p>to know that they can get out of certain situations,</p>
<p>out of certain, you know, submission holds</p>
<p>or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>I think that really ties in with some of my PhD work</p>
<p>in terms of what these guys do to approach</p>
<p>what is, you know, a really challenging sport</p>
<p>and arena in mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely the extreme of what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>in terms of asking, does stress favor or hinder performance?</p>
<p>Because yeah, like you said, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s someone trying to hurt you</p>
<p>as much as they possibly can within the bounds of the rules,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to do the same.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I find that your thesis work fascinating.</p>
<p>Were you never to be at the UFC Performance Institute,</p>
<p>luckily they made the right choice and brought you here.</p>
<p>But were you have never to come here,</p>
<p>I was still fascinated by this</p>
<p>because over and over we hear that stress is bad,</p>
<p>stress is bad, stress is bad.</p>
<p>But everything I read from the scientific literature</p>
<p>is that stress and epinephrine in particular</p>
<p>is coupled to the testosterone response</p>
<p>to performance and to adaptation,</p>
<p>provided it doesn&rsquo;t go on too long.</p>
<p>So unless I&rsquo;m saying something that violates that,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s your work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really important and beautiful work.</p>
<p>And I refer to it often,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just glad that we could bolt that down</p>
<p>because I think the people need to know this,</p>
<p>that discomfort is beneficial.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s another side to this that I want to ask about,</p>
<p>which is the use of cold,</p>
<p>in particular things like ice baths, cold showers,</p>
<p>or any other type of cold temperature exposure.</p>
<p>In theory, that&rsquo;s stress also, it&rsquo;s epinephrine.</p>
<p>And so how should one think about</p>
<p>the use of cold for recovery?</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s stress, how is, if stress,</p>
<p>if cold causes stress, then how is cold used for recovery?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And maybe you just want to share your thoughts on that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, and I think, you know, it&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And I think the jury is still out there, certainly,</p>
<p>knowing some of the conversations that we&rsquo;ve been having.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, when we talk about stress,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your classic fight, flight, or freeze approach.</p>
<p>And, you know, throwing your body into, you know,</p>
<p>a cold tub, an ice bath, or whatever it may be,</p>
<p>certainly is gonna have a physiological stress response.</p>
<p>Now, people are using that for different end goals.</p>
<p>And again, I think that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>the narrative has to be explained.</p>
<p>If you are using the stress specifically</p>
<p>to manage the mindset,</p>
<p>to use it as a specific stress stimulus,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the same as me doing six by 10, 80%.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re just trying to find something</p>
<p>to disrupt the system, to do something that&rsquo;s very,</p>
<p>if you want a better term, painful, discomfort, whatever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just finding a stressor</p>
<p>and then being able to manage the mindset.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re using cold,</p>
<p>specifically from a physiological perspective,</p>
<p>to promote, you know, redistribution of vascularity,</p>
<p>you know, of blood&rsquo;s flow, you know,</p>
<p>to different vascular areas of muscle</p>
<p>that you feel have gone through a workout,</p>
<p>that are damaged, or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ve got to understand</p>
<p>what that stress mechanism is.</p>
<p>And, you know, the data, the literature,</p>
<p>is certainly still out there</p>
<p>with respect to cryotherapy, and cold baths,</p>
<p>and some of these, you know, high,</p>
<p>these cold exposures in terms of what they do</p>
<p>at the level of the muscle tissue.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the target,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to promote a flushing mechanism,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re trying to promote redistribution</p>
<p>of the blood flow, what you&rsquo;ve got to understand</p>
<p>is that cold is going to clamp down</p>
<p>every part of the vascular system.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve really got to understand</p>
<p>how the muscle would be redistributed</p>
<p>to areas of interest.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think the stress response</p>
<p>is a real thing with respect to, you know, cold exposure.</p>
<p>But I think the narrative around</p>
<p>what are you using the cold for</p>
<p>has to precede the conversation.</p>
<p>Because, yes, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like putting your hand over a hot coal.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a stress the same way</p>
<p>as jumping in a cold bath is.</p>
<p>I think most people don&rsquo;t realize that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get the epinephrine release</p>
<p>from holding your hand up too close to the flame,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to get it from getting in the ice bath.</p>
<p>Your body doesn&rsquo;t know the difference, right?</p>
<p>Your body does not know the difference.</p>
<p>It has a, you know, a primordial kind of physiological</p>
<p>response that it&rsquo;s created over millions</p>
<p>and millions of years.</p>
<p>And I think that physiology is not changing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fixed in a particular way right now,</p>
<p>and that it doesn&rsquo;t understand the difference</p>
<p>between whether it&rsquo;s six by 10</p>
<p>doing a challenging workout over here,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s putting my hands on the hot coal,</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s a lion stood in front of me or whatever,</p>
<p>that epinephrine response from the level of the brain</p>
<p>down to the whole signaling cascade is the same.</p>
<p>And cold, I&rsquo;ve heard, can actually prevent</p>
<p>some of the beneficial effects of training,</p>
<p>that it can actually get in the way</p>
<p>of muscle growth, et cetera.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some pretty robust data out there now</p>
<p>showing that it definitely has an influence</p>
<p>on performance variables like strength and power</p>
<p>in particular, but absolutely in terms of muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a big kind of theme</p>
<p>in the world of athletic performance right now</p>
<p>in terms of periodization of cold exposure</p>
<p>as a recovery modality.</p>
<p>When do you use cold?</p>
<p>You know, should you be using cold for recovery</p>
<p>in periods of high training load</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually pursuing, you know,</p>
<p>maybe general proprietary work,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re actually trying to pursue muscle growth?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s usually where you get the most sore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually where, you know, you feel the most fatigued,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably not the most beneficial approach</p>
<p>to use an ice bath in that scenario</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re dampening, you&rsquo;re dulling the, you know,</p>
<p>the mTOR pathway and the hypertrophic signaling pathway.</p>
<p>Whereas in a competition phase,</p>
<p>where actually quality of exercise</p>
<p>and quality of execution of skill and technical work</p>
<p>has to be maintained,</p>
<p>you want to throw the kitchen sink of recovery capabilities</p>
<p>and recovery interventions in that scenario</p>
<p>because you now, you know,</p>
<p>the muscle building activity should be in the bank.</p>
<p>That should have been done in the general preparatory work.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re focusing on technical execution.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>if I want to maximize muscle growth or power</p>
<p>or, you know, improvements and adaptations,</p>
<p>then the inflammation response,</p>
<p>the delayed onset muscle soreness,</p>
<p>all this stuff that&rsquo;s uncomfortable</p>
<p>and that we hear is so terrible</p>
<p>is actually the stimulus for adaptation.</p>
<p>And so using cold in that situation</p>
<p>might short circuit my progress.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll ever do this,</p>
<p>but if I were to do an Ironman or something</p>
<p>or run a marathon under those conditions,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically coming to the race, so to speak,</p>
<p>with all the power and strength I&rsquo;m going to have.</p>
<p>And so there, reducing inflammation is good</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to allow me</p>
<p>to perform more work, essentially.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to be strategic</p>
<p>about when you use some of these interventions.</p>
<p>And, you know, the time when you&rsquo;re preparing</p>
<p>for a competition is not the appropriate time,</p>
<p>excuse me, is the appropriate time</p>
<p>when you want to drive recovery</p>
<p>and make sure that your body is optimized.</p>
<p>And, you know, when you&rsquo;re far away</p>
<p>from a competition, you know, date</p>
<p>or, you know, out of season or whatever it may be,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really trying to just tear up the body</p>
<p>a little bit to allow it to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s natural, you know, healing</p>
<p>and adaptation processes to take place.</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t want to negate that.</p>
<p>You know, you want the body</p>
<p>to optimize its internal recovery</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how muscle growth is going to happen, so.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time kind of consideration</p>
<p>that you need to make with these interventions, for sure.</p>
<p>At the UFC Performance Center,</p>
<p>are the fighters periodizing their cold exposure</p>
<p>or are they just doing cold at will?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not just the UFC.</p>
<p>And again, I talk about my personal experiences</p>
<p>with different sports.</p>
<p>I think just education around where science is at</p>
<p>and our understanding of concepts</p>
<p>like the use of cold exposure for recovery, ice bath.</p>
<p>You know, everyone wants to jump in an ice bath.</p>
<p>But I think as we&rsquo;ve stepped back</p>
<p>and scientists have started to say,</p>
<p>have started to figure out and look at some of the data,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re now more intuitive about,</p>
<p>well, actually that might not be the best</p>
<p>or the most optimal approach.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s any given sport.</p>
<p>So yes, certainly here at the UFC,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to educate our athletes</p>
<p>around, you know, appropriate timing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same with nutrition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with an ice bath intervention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with lifting weights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with going for a run</p>
<p>or working out on the bike.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s tactics to when you do things</p>
<p>and when you don&rsquo;t do things.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, stress and cold exposure,</p>
<p>we have to have a consideration around that as well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just, you know, MMA fighters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s any athlete.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the best professionals,</p>
<p>the most successful professionals do that really well.</p>
<p>They listen, number one, they educate themselves</p>
<p>and then they build structure.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, at the most elite level,</p>
<p>we always talk about it here at the UFC,</p>
<p>but the most elite level,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not necessarily training harder than anybody else.</p>
<p>Everybody in the UFC trains hard.</p>
<p>Like everyone is training super hard.</p>
<p>But the best athletes, the true elite levels</p>
<p>are the ones that can do it again and again and again</p>
<p>on a daily basis and sustain a technical output</p>
<p>for skill development.</p>
<p>Therefore their skills can improve or physical development,</p>
<p>their physical attributes can improve.</p>
<p>So that ability to reproduce on a day-to-day basis</p>
<p>falls into a recovery conversation.</p>
<p>Now, when is the right time to use something</p>
<p>like an ice bath and when isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>is part of the high-performance conversation for sure.</p>
<p>So really they&rsquo;re scientists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re building structure.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re figuring out variables.</p>
<p>But it sounds like the ability to do more quality work</p>
<p>over time is one of the key variables.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fundamental.</p>
<p>Garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>Quality in, quality out.</p>
<p>But in our sport, I talk about mixed martial arts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s truly a decathlon of combat.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many different attributes,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a grappling, whether it&rsquo;s a wrestling,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a transition work,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a stand-up striking.</p>
<p>So the different facets of a training program in this sport</p>
<p>are significantly large compared to something like</p>
<p>a wide receiver in football.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s no disrespect for wide receivers,</p>
<p>but they run routes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to run a route, a passing tree,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all they need to do.</p>
<p>These guys have to be on the ground.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to be great on the ground.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to be great standing up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to be great with the back against the fence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many different kind of facets to our sport.</p>
<p>So managing the distribution of all the training components</p>
<p>is one of the biggest challenges of mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>And the best guys get that right.</p>
<p>They allow their body to optimize the training.</p>
<p>And remember, why are we doing training?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing training for technical and tactical improvement.</p>
<p>Now, if your body is fatigued</p>
<p>or you just can&rsquo;t expose yourself</p>
<p>to more tactical development or technical development,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re essentially doing yourself a disservice.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be behind the curve</p>
<p>with respect to those guys</p>
<p>that can reproduce that day in, day out.</p>
<p>On the topic of skill development, regardless of sport,</p>
<p>we hear all the time,</p>
<p>and it certainly is intuitive to me</p>
<p>that the person who can focus the best</p>
<p>will progress the fastest.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Sometimes I talk to athletes</p>
<p>and they seem a little bit laid back</p>
<p>about their training sometimes,</p>
<p>and yet they obviously know how to flip the switch</p>
<p>and they can really dial in the intensity.</p>
<p>Do you think that there are optimal protocols</p>
<p>for skill learning in terms of physical skill learning?</p>
<p>Like, could it ever be parameterized</p>
<p>like the six sets of 10 reps?</p>
<p>And this gets to the heart of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>which is still, it&rsquo;s not a black box,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of a black box</p>
<p>with portions of it illuminated, I like to say.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts on skill development?</p>
<p>Is there, for somebody that wants to get better at sport,</p>
<p>do you recommend a particularly long</p>
<p>or short training session?</p>
<p>Does intensity matter, or is it just reps?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, no, it&rsquo;s not a volume-driven exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quality-driven exercise.</p>
<p>And listen, my expertise is not in motor learning</p>
<p>and motor skill acquisition.</p>
<p>I tend to default to Dr. Gabrielle Wolfe here at UNLV</p>
<p>for that, she&rsquo;s one of the leading proponents in this area.</p>
<p>But if you look at true skill development,</p>
<p>it is about rehearsal of accurate movement,</p>
<p>accurate movement mechanics.</p>
<p>And as soon as that becomes impacted by fatigue</p>
<p>or inaccurate movement,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now losing the motor learning.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re losing the accuracy of the skill</p>
<p>that people can call it muscle memory</p>
<p>or whatever they want, right?</p>
<p>But essentially, you&rsquo;re grooving neural axons</p>
<p>to create movement patterns,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re situational throughout sport, right?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a Cruyff turn in soccer</p>
<p>or a jump shot in basketball or a forehand down the line,</p>
<p>you can carve out that particular posture</p>
<p>and position and skill, and you can isolate it,</p>
<p>and you can drill it again and again and again.</p>
<p>Now, as soon as fatigue is influencing that repetition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to stop.</p>
<p>And the best coaches understand that.</p>
<p>They understand that it&rsquo;s quality over quantity</p>
<p>when it comes to skill acquisition.</p>
<p>So to answer your question in a roundabout way,</p>
<p>I would say, yes, it&rsquo;s shorter sessions</p>
<p>that are very high quality.</p>
<p>And I think the best athletes in my experience</p>
<p>are the ones that consciously and cognitively</p>
<p>are aware of it at every moment of the training session.</p>
<p>They should leave the training session</p>
<p>not necessarily just physically fatigued,</p>
<p>but mentally fatigued,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re completely engaged in the learning process.</p>
<p>The problem then becomes,</p>
<p>okay, if we just do lots of 30-minute sessions,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got to do a lot of 30-minute sessions</p>
<p>to get the volume exposure of the repetition</p>
<p>and the rehearsal of the skill again and again and again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit of a paradox.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>But a three-hour session versus a 90-minute session,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll take the 90-minute session any day</p>
<p>when it comes to skill acquisition,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to be driven by quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Yeah, training and skill learning</p>
<p>is incredibly mentally fatiguing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered why when one works out hard,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s with a run or with the weights,</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s hard to think later in the day.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, there really does seem to be something to it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve wondered, is it depletion of adrenaline, dopamine?</p>
<p>I sometimes think it might be dopamine,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m totally speculating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any data to support this.</p>
<p>But if you hit a really hard workout or run early in the day,</p>
<p>oftentimes the brain just doesn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to do hard mental work,</p>
<p>which gives me great admiration for these athletes</p>
<p>that are drilling their mind and body all day, every day,</p>
<p>with breaks.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>What leads to the mental fatigue after physical performance?</p>
<p>Well, again, I don&rsquo;t want to talk out,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to the man here.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re just two scientists speculating on this point.</p>
<p>Up until now, you&rsquo;ve been giving us</p>
<p>concrete peer-reviewed study-based feedback</p>
<p>on my questions.</p>
<p>But if we were to speculate,</p>
<p>I mean, I think this is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>People think if I get that really good workout</p>
<p>in the morning, I feel better all day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, unless that workout is really intense</p>
<p>or really long.</p>
<p>And then the mind just somehow won&rsquo;t latch on</p>
<p>to mental work quite as well.</p>
<p>I mean, just philosophically,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a, coming back to this kind</p>
<p>of stress consideration,</p>
<p>like a public speaking or taking an exam.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have an amazing coach</p>
<p>who is setting up training in a particular way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s challenging.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strain related to it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking physical strain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking figuring things out,</p>
<p>figuring out the skill.</p>
<p>And I think that can be stressful.</p>
<p>Like the learning process can be stressful.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve touched on stress.</p>
<p>I also think if they hit the right technique,</p>
<p>that reward center in the brain,</p>
<p>that dopamine shot is gonna fly up there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only so many times that we can get that</p>
<p>before that becomes dampened.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s an energetic piece to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the fueling of the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the carbohydrate fueling exercise</p>
<p>that actually the strategy around how you fuel</p>
<p>for learning and fuel for physical training</p>
<p>is actually pretty similar.</p>
<p>Glucose.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s glucose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sugar at the end of the day, right?</p>
<p>So, are you fueling accordingly</p>
<p>around your training sessions?</p>
<p>Be that very physical.</p>
<p>Cause everyone thinks, okay,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna jump on a treadmill</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna bang out 15 sprints at max effort.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna be dropping off</p>
<p>and lying on the floor at the end of it.</p>
<p>I need to refuel.</p>
<p>But what about the refueling of the brain</p>
<p>in a very demanding exercise or drilling session</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re looking at technique</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to figure out</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very challenging for your mind</p>
<p>to figure out the complexity of it,</p>
<p>but still needs to be fueled or refueled afterwards.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s obviously might be an area</p>
<p>where athletes do themselves a disservice</p>
<p>by not appropriate fueling</p>
<p>from what might be considered</p>
<p>to be a lower intensity session.</p>
<p>But the cognitive challenge has been significantly high.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re doing skill work or drill work</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s taxing the brain.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>oh, I wasn&rsquo;t pushing hard lifts or doing sprints.</p>
<p>And so I can just go off the rest of my day,</p>
<p>but then their mind is drifting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I speculate.</p>
<p>Yeah, that seems very reasonable.</p>
<p>I mean, I know that I&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>and presumably with the other athletes you&rsquo;ve worked with,</p>
<p>nutrition is a huge aspect of that.</p>
<p>And I think the general public can learn a lot</p>
<p>from athletic nutrition because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the general public is trying to attend to their kids,</p>
<p>attend to their work,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re lawyers or whatever,</p>
<p>they need to focus.</p>
<p>Nutrition is a barbed wire topic.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>But since we&rsquo;re free to do what we would do</p>
<p>if we were just sitting in each other&rsquo;s offices,</p>
<p>which is to just speculate a bit,</p>
<p>for the typical person,</p>
<p>do you think these low-carbohydrate diets,</p>
<p>typical person who exercises,</p>
<p>runs, swims, yoga, lifts weights,</p>
<p>maybe not all those things,</p>
<p>but some collection of those,</p>
<p>pushes themselves to do those things and to do them well,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t necessarily a highly competitive athlete?</p>
<p>Do you think that nutrition</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t include a lot of glucose,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t include a lot of carbohydrates is a problem</p>
<p>or is it okay?</p>
<p>What do you recommend for athletes?</p>
<p>What do you recommend for typical people?</p>
<p>Yeah, again, disclaimer, I&rsquo;m not a dietician, but I-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>The dieticians don&rsquo;t know what to recommend</p>
<p>to athletes either.</p>
<p>And I say that from having spent a lot of time</p>
<p>with the literature now, it&rsquo;s a complete mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I thought we didn&rsquo;t understand anything</p>
<p>about the brain.</p>
<p>The nutrition science stuff is all over the place.</p>
<p>So I think we have, again, a large degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it comes down to metabolic efficiency.</p>
<p>So we would never advocate a high&hellip;</p>
<p>I never say never, okay?</p>
<p>But we rarely advocate a high-performance athlete</p>
<p>in a high-intensity intermittent sport like MMA,</p>
<p>being totally ketogenic or-</p>
<p>You do not recommend that.</p>
<p>No, because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>some of those high-intensity efforts</p>
<p>usually require carbohydrate fueling</p>
<p>for the energy produced at those high intensities.</p>
<p>So we try to navigate around that.</p>
<p>Now, listen, there are fighters in the UFC and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Matt Brown is a great example</p>
<p>who promotes the ketogenic approach, and it works for him.</p>
<p>But we look at the science and the nature,</p>
<p>the characteristics of our sport,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t necessarily promote that.</p>
<p>Can I interrupt you real quick?</p>
<p>What about ketones for people</p>
<p>that are ingesting carbohydrates?</p>
<p>This is an interesting area</p>
<p>because people always hear ketones,</p>
<p>and they think, oh, I have to be ketogenic</p>
<p>to benefit from taking ketones.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And recreational athletes now as well</p>
<p>taking liquid or powder-based ketones</p>
<p>even though they do eat rice and oatmeal</p>
<p>and bread and other things.</p>
<p>So are there any known benefits of ketones</p>
<p>even if one is not in a state of ketosis?</p>
<p>So the use of ketones that I&rsquo;m primarily aware of</p>
<p>in our sport is after the event</p>
<p>in terms of the brain health</p>
<p>with athletes that are potentially taking trauma</p>
<p>to the brain, et cetera,</p>
<p>and looking to maintain the fueling</p>
<p>and the energy supply to the brain.</p>
<p>But yes, it&rsquo;s probably a little bit out of my remit,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t wanna talk on that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not fully familiar with that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve heard that ketones after head injury</p>
<p>can provide a buffering component.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna reverse brain damage,</p>
<p>but it might be able to offset some of the micro damage.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how we use it,</p>
<p>just to sustain the energy supply</p>
<p>to the brain that might be compromised</p>
<p>through brain trauma.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we use ketones.</p>
<p>To come back to the original question,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a general population,</p>
<p>then yes, I think there&rsquo;s a place to argue</p>
<p>that actually being on a ketogenic diet at times,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s a cycling exercise,</p>
<p>maybe not, I don&rsquo;t mean cycling a bike.</p>
<p>I mean, cycling ketosis is beneficial</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s gonna lead</p>
<p>to better metabolic management and metabolic efficiency.</p>
<p>At those lower intensities</p>
<p>where we should be fueling our metabolism</p>
<p>with lipids and fats,</p>
<p>clearly the Western diet and the modern day diets</p>
<p>is heavily driven by processed foods and carbohydrates</p>
<p>that people become predisposed to utilization</p>
<p>of that fuel source above lipids use, fat use,</p>
<p>intensities that are very low.</p>
<p>So some of our data with the fighters shows that as well.</p>
<p>But I think the challenge for us</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re working with a clientele</p>
<p>that require high intensity bouts of effort.</p>
<p>So fueling appropriately is very important for that.</p>
<p>Now we use tactics here where we essentially</p>
<p>have athletes on what you would say</p>
<p>kind of a, is it a largely a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>but then we will fuel carbohydrates</p>
<p>around training sessions.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll do very timed exposure to carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>Post training.</p>
<p>Post training, immediately pre, during,</p>
<p>and then immediately post.</p>
<p>And then the rest of their diets,</p>
<p>breakfast, lunch, and dinner,</p>
<p>are what would look like ketogenic type approaches.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to be very tactical in the exposure</p>
<p>to maximize the intensity for the training</p>
<p>and then return to a metabolically efficient diet,</p>
<p>which is heavily reduced in carbohydrate</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve fueled the sessions that need it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smiling because once again,</p>
<p>this place, the UFC Performance Center,</p>
<p>is doing things scientifically,</p>
<p>which to me, the idea, and I&rsquo;m pleased to hear that</p>
<p>because to me, this idea that the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>is the best and only diet,</p>
<p>or carbohydrates and low protein diets are the best diet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s ludicrous.</p>
<p>Then you mentioned metabolic efficiency.</p>
<p>I think some people might be familiar with that term,</p>
<p>some perhaps not,</p>
<p>but the way I understand metabolic efficiency</p>
<p>is that you teach the body to use fats</p>
<p>by maybe doing long bouts of cardio,</p>
<p>maybe lowering carbohydrates a bit,</p>
<p>so teaching the body to tap into its fat stores</p>
<p>for certain periods of training.</p>
<p>And then you also teach the body to utilize carbohydrates</p>
<p>by supplying carbohydrates immediately after training</p>
<p>and before training.</p>
<p>You teach the body to use ketones,</p>
<p>and then you use them at the appropriate time</p>
<p>as opposed to just deciding</p>
<p>that one of these fuel sources is good</p>
<p>and all the others are bad or dispensable.</p>
<p>Do I have that correct?</p>
<p>You nailed it.</p>
<p>I mean, from Bob Sibahar, formerly of USA Triathlon,</p>
<p>is the guy that kind of came up</p>
<p>with the concept of metabolic efficiency.</p>
<p>But yes, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I mean, at low intensities of exercise</p>
<p>or just day-to-day living,</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t be tapping into</p>
<p>our carbohydrate fuel sources extensively.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for higher intensity work</p>
<p>or the fight or flight needs of stress.</p>
<p>If athletes or any individual has a high-carbohydrate diet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna start to become predisposed</p>
<p>to utilizing that fuel source preferentially.</p>
<p>Now, at low intensity, that can be problematic,</p>
<p>certainly for an athlete,</p>
<p>because if they preferentially use carbohydrate</p>
<p>at lower intensities,</p>
<p>when the exercise demand goes to a higher intensity,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already exhausted their fuel stores.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t draw upon fat</p>
<p>because the oxidization of that fat is just too slow.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re essentially now become fatigued</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve already utilized their carbohydrate stores.</p>
<p>So what we try to do, yes, through diet manipulation</p>
<p>and a little bit of exercise manipulation is, as you say,</p>
<p>teach the body or train the body</p>
<p>to preferentially use a specific fuel source,</p>
<p>fat, obviously, at lower intensities</p>
<p>and carbohydrate at high intensities.</p>
<p>And we look at, specifically,</p>
<p>the crossover point between the two</p>
<p>tells a lot in terms of how an athlete is ultimately,</p>
<p>how their metabolism is working.</p>
<p>Well, again, I was smiling because I love this,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s grounded in something real and scientific,</p>
<p>which is that we have these different fuel sources.</p>
<p>The body can adapt to use any number of them or one of them.</p>
<p>I think most people are looking for that one pattern</p>
<p>of eating, that one pattern of exercising</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be best for them or sustain them.</p>
<p>And they often look back to the time</p>
<p>when they felt so much better</p>
<p>switching from one thing to the next,</p>
<p>but the adaptation process itself is also key, right?</p>
<p>Teaching the body.</p>
<p>So, if we were to just riff on this</p>
<p>just a little bit further, if somebody,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use myself as an example,</p>
<p>since I can only speculate</p>
<p>what other people&rsquo;s current nutrition protocols are,</p>
<p>but if somebody is eating in a particular way</p>
<p>and they want to try this kind of periodization of nutrition,</p>
<p>could one say, okay, for a few weeks,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do more high-intensity interval training</p>
<p>and weight training,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to eat a bit more carbohydrate</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m depleting more glycogen</p>
<p>than if I switch to a phase of my training</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m doing some longer runs,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m training less,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m just working at my desk a little bit more,</p>
<p>then I might switch to a lower carbohydrate diet.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>And then if I&rsquo;m going to enter a competition of some sort,</p>
<p>certainly not UFC or MMA of any kind, to be clear,</p>
<p>not because it isn&rsquo;t a wonderful sport,</p>
<p>but because that wouldn&rsquo;t be good for my other profession,</p>
<p>but if I were going to do that,</p>
<p>then I would think about stacking carbohydrates,</p>
<p>ketones, and fats.</p>
<p>Do I have that more or less right?</p>
<p>I mean, I think, yeah, you just said it eloquently.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consciously understanding</p>
<p>what the exposure to physical exertion is,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re flexing your diet accordingly.</p>
<p>And I think that-</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s need-based eating.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You know, for want of better terms,</p>
<p>you can call it whatever fancy terminology</p>
<p>there is out there,</p>
<p>but yes, it&rsquo;s needs-based eating,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re very conscious and cognizant</p>
<p>of what is my current exercise status.</p>
<p>You know, if I&rsquo;m taking some time off,</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t gorge on the carbohydrates.</p>
<p>We probably need to be cut.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be lower intensity work,</p>
<p>or even just habitual day-to-day walking around,</p>
<p>doing your groceries.</p>
<p>You know, that doesn&rsquo;t require massive amounts</p>
<p>of glycogen storage and carbohydrate fueling.</p>
<p>So you can potentially go more ketogenic in nature,</p>
<p>you know, oxidizing lipids for that fuel.</p>
<p>If you are in a high period of high-intensity training,</p>
<p>then you have to consciously flex your diet</p>
<p>to support that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not normal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve made a change.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve elevated the demand.</p>
<p>So the fueling requirements for the regenerative,</p>
<p>not only fueling the exercise,</p>
<p>but the regenerative requirements of your body</p>
<p>after that type of work</p>
<p>is going to be really important as well.</p>
<p>So yes, take on more carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s consciously interpreting</p>
<p>the nature of your diet</p>
<p>against where you are at any moment in time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like that.</p>
<p>I think the listeners in my podcast</p>
<p>generally are experimenters.</p>
<p>They are scientists of themselves,</p>
<p>which makes me happy, obviously.</p>
<p>And I like to think that they&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>to the changes they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re affecting themselves.</p>
<p>And they seem more open to trying things,</p>
<p>provided they can do it safely, you know,</p>
<p>and seeing what works for them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certainly going to try some of the change up.</p>
<p>I also am really a creature of habit.</p>
<p>And I think talking to you today,</p>
<p>I realize I&rsquo;m probably doing a number of things</p>
<p>truly wrong in my training,</p>
<p>but also that I don&rsquo;t tend to vary my nutrition</p>
<p>with my training quite as much as I should.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just locked into a protocol.</p>
<p>We covered a number of things</p>
<p>related to your PhD thesis work,</p>
<p>but I cut you off early on related to your trajectory.</p>
<p>After you finished your thesis,</p>
<p>I know you were at Notre Dame for a while.</p>
<p>Was that your first spot after your PhD thesis?</p>
<p>No, no, I basically finished my PhD</p>
<p>and I dropped into the British Olympic system</p>
<p>for about 14 years.</p>
<p>Oh my, okay.</p>
<p>I was with, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done three full Olympic cycles with different sports</p>
<p>and largely a strength and conditioning coach</p>
<p>as a practitioner.</p>
<p>I was always working in universities and academia alongside,</p>
<p>you know, in terms of continuing to publish and write</p>
<p>and do research and teach as well.</p>
<p>That explains the huge volume of publications.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think people realize the work</p>
<p>that goes into getting a quality peer-reviewed publication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, what do they call it now on Instagram?</p>
<p>Anik data, where people would do something,</p>
<p>want, you know, they have this experience</p>
<p>and then they put it in the world.</p>
<p>Anik data are,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know that we should call it data,</p>
<p>but so 14 years working with the British Olympic team?</p>
<p>Yeah, so with, you know,</p>
<p>whether it was GB boxing,</p>
<p>primarily with the Rio side, excuse me,</p>
<p>the Beijing cycle,</p>
<p>but also lightweight rowers and gymnastics.</p>
<p>And for the London Olympic games,</p>
<p>that cycle I was with,</p>
<p>I was the lead strength and conditioning</p>
<p>and physical performance coach for British basketball.</p>
<p>So GB basketball.</p>
<p>I had about three years in the English Premier League</p>
<p>and with Newcastle United and the soccer team.</p>
<p>And then for the Rio Olympic cycle,</p>
<p>I was with Great Britain Taekwondo.</p>
<p>So again, another combat sport.</p>
<p>After I&rsquo;d finished there,</p>
<p>I kind of moved to the University of Notre Dame</p>
<p>where I went into more of a,</p>
<p>more of a managerial position,</p>
<p>working across all the different technical services,</p>
<p>medical, nutrition, strength and conditioning,</p>
<p>you know, psychology, whatever,</p>
<p>sports science, whatever it may be.</p>
<p>As the, you know,</p>
<p>the director of performance sciences</p>
<p>for Notre Dame athletics.</p>
<p>And then after about 16 months there,</p>
<p>the UFC came knocking</p>
<p>and they recruited me out of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been a great ride</p>
<p>and lots of, you know, I&rsquo;ve got, you know,</p>
<p>lots of athletes have taught me a lot along the way.</p>
<p>Lots of coaches, you know, every day is a school day.</p>
<p>I still try and keep that mentality.</p>
<p>And, you know, in this world,</p>
<p>we call it white belt mentality.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, you know, I&rsquo;m a PhD.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got 25 years of experience in high performance sport,</p>
<p>but I still learn every single day</p>
<p>from these people out on the mats and in the ring.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s impressive to see what they do.</p>
<p>Yeah, it certainly is.</p>
<p>I got introduced to MMA just a few years ago.</p>
<p>I think the first time I came out here</p>
<p>was one of the first times I&rsquo;d heard of MMA</p>
<p>because I was kind of in my laboratory and, you know,</p>
<p>nose down.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really interesting sport</p>
<p>because it incorporates so many different types of movement.</p>
<p>As you said, you know, it&rsquo;s not just stand up boxing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just kicking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s every, you know, ground game, everything.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still learning about it.</p>
<p>But as you mentioned,</p>
<p>going in with that beginner&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>the white belt mentality,</p>
<p>what has been the most surprising thing for you</p>
<p>in terms of being exposed to MMA in particular,</p>
<p>as opposed to other sports?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s unique about MMA fighters</p>
<p>besides that they have this huge variety</p>
<p>of tactical skills that they have to learn and perfect?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I would say two things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to answer two questions.</p>
<p>One actually reiterates what you&rsquo;ve already said.</p>
<p>Like the degrees of freedom in mixed martial arts</p>
<p>are exponential, like no other sport.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve got 11 different weight classes.</p>
<p>We have men&rsquo;s classes.</p>
<p>We have women&rsquo;s classes.</p>
<p>We have, you know, kickboxers, wrestlers,</p>
<p>jujitsu fighters, judokas, you know, like karate fighters.</p>
<p>You know, the stylistic backgrounds are infinite.</p>
<p>And we have, we&rsquo;re a weight classification sport.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole issue relating to making weight</p>
<p>and then rebounding to fight about 24 to 30 hours.</p>
<p>Like just the variability in this sport,</p>
<p>the considerations that you have to make</p>
<p>are unprecedented compared to any other sport</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve worked with.</p>
<p>And a lot of them go against,</p>
<p>and they are the antithesis</p>
<p>of what you would expect for a high performance.</p>
<p>You know, in terms of,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t always have a very clearly defined</p>
<p>competition schedule.</p>
<p>You know, once these guys fight,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t necessarily know</p>
<p>when their next fight&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the closest spacing of a fight?</p>
<p>I mean, listen, I think the record is around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just over a month, I believe.</p>
<p>So, you know, that&rsquo;s a quick turnaround.</p>
<p>But most of these guys are fighting,</p>
<p>you know, three or four times a year,</p>
<p>three times a year is pretty normal.</p>
<p>The bigger fights, maybe two times a year.</p>
<p>But invariably the guys don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>when that next date is going to be.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in this gray area of, okay, what do we do?</p>
<p>Like, are we taking some time off?</p>
<p>Are we just going to do some general prep work?</p>
<p>Are we going to try and keep this, you know,</p>
<p>the knife sharpened in case I get-</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>in that way it&rsquo;s a lot like special operations.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you don&rsquo;t know when the call is going to happen.</p>
<p>They have to be ready at all times.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t this like, let&rsquo;s get ready for the season.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, like when I was</p>
<p>with the British Olympic Association,</p>
<p>you know, I knew it was the British Open,</p>
<p>the Spanish Open, the French Open,</p>
<p>the European Championships, the Israeli Open,</p>
<p>the American Open, the Canadian Open, the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>You know, I could-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a circuit in your brain, I can tell.</p>
<p>Right, you just plan like,</p>
<p>you know where all the targets are going to be.</p>
<p>Here, it&rsquo;s a moving target</p>
<p>because you might be just hanging out</p>
<p>doing some general prep work</p>
<p>and then you might get a short notice fight.</p>
<p>They give you a quick call</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s in six weeks or five weeks.</p>
<p>And okay, I&rsquo;ve got to ramp everything up really quickly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a real challenge in terms of just managing</p>
<p>all these different components of mixed martial arts alone.</p>
<p>To come back to your question,</p>
<p>the other thing which is truly fascinating</p>
<p>about these individuals is their,</p>
<p>just their mental resilience.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;ve touched on it in the talk,</p>
<p>but the ability to do what they do on a daily basis,</p>
<p>to look at all the different skill sets</p>
<p>that they have to try and engage in</p>
<p>and bring into their training,</p>
<p>to do that and embrace the grind,</p>
<p>embrace the process of just learning.</p>
<p>The physical side of our sport is unprecedented,</p>
<p>but the mental side, you know,</p>
<p>we have a funny saying here,</p>
<p>we always say it&rsquo;s 90% mental</p>
<p>apart from the 60% that&rsquo;s physical.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s just more and more and more.</p>
<p>And these guys&rsquo; ability to just do that on a daily basis</p>
<p>is very impressive.</p>
<p>Like their resilience, their internal drive</p>
<p>and their resilience is really impressive to see.</p>
<p>Yeah, all the fighters I&rsquo;ve met here</p>
<p>have been really terrific.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Every time I meet a fighter, how often I,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re often very soft-spoken.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Always extremely polite.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And fighting is such a, you know,</p>
<p>it comes from a very primitive portion of the brain.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But a large portion of the brain, nonetheless.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s another skill is that switch,</p>
<p>you know, and again,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the recoverability piece, right?</p>
<p>Like you cannot be type A</p>
<p>or you cannot be like supercharged 24 hours a day</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to just fry your system, right?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s something else</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re really trying to manage this whole process,</p>
<p>be it through nutritional interventions,</p>
<p>be it through education around sleep,</p>
<p>be it through training program management,</p>
<p>be it through psychological interventions.</p>
<p>You know, you could look at fighters and say,</p>
<p>like, these guys are go.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re red alert</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll run through a brick wall.</p>
<p>But actually, again,</p>
<p>their ability to turn it on and off</p>
<p>means that they can do what they do.</p>
<p>You know, they can bring it down and be very normal,</p>
<p>very polite, very, you know, accommodating.</p>
<p>Maybe even better than most people,</p>
<p>because, you know,</p>
<p>one of the reasons I&rsquo;m obsessed with human performance</p>
<p>and high performance and people like fighters</p>
<p>you know, elite military</p>
<p>or even bodybuilders for that matter</p>
<p>is that they experiment.</p>
<p>They find the outer limits of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>But one of the things that they have discovered</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re describing is this ability</p>
<p>to toggle between high alert states and calm states.</p>
<p>Most typical people can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>They see something that upsets them on the internet</p>
<p>or something on the news</p>
<p>or some external event pressures down on them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re stressed for many, many days and weeks.</p>
<p>And sometimes it goes pathological, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say this as a criticism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that most human beings within our species,</p>
<p>most members of our species</p>
<p>never learn to either flip the switch</p>
<p>or to just voluntarily toggle between states.</p>
<p>I think athletes learn how to do that extremely well.</p>
<p>And it sounds like MMA fighters do that even better</p>
<p>than perhaps many other athletes.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, there&rsquo;s the odd one or two</p>
<p>that would struggle with,</p>
<p>but I think in terms of that chronic exposure,</p>
<p>we see that coming from challenges</p>
<p>around cyclical weight cutting</p>
<p>and metabolic disruption and metabolic injury,</p>
<p>not necessarily from the psychological drive.</p>
<p>They do understand that this is a job for them</p>
<p>and the time on the mats,</p>
<p>most of them can turn it off a little bit</p>
<p>and downgrade things when they&rsquo;re off the mats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impressive to see.</p>
<p>Because again, like as a layman,</p>
<p>just looking at the fight game,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s going to be crazy chaotic,</p>
<p>100 miles an hour, every hour of every day.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s clearly not the case.</p>
<p>They manage their energy and their efforts pretty well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little bit like science,</p>
<p>although maybe scientists could take a lesson from it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like that evidence-based practice</p>
<p>or practice-based evidence, right?</p>
<p>No, I like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>A couple more questions.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>
<p>I know we talked about temperature earlier</p>
<p>when we discussed cold, but I can&rsquo;t help myself.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about heat</p>
<p>because earlier we were having a conversation</p>
<p>about heat adaptation, about how long does it take</p>
<p>for the human body or athlete or typical person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s maybe exploring sauna or things of that sort</p>
<p>to learn to be a better sweater?</p>
<p>It sounds like something none of us would want to do.</p>
<p>We all want to stay cool, calm, and collected.</p>
<p>But one of the reasons to deliberately expose oneself</p>
<p>to heat is for things like growth hormone release, et cetera.</p>
<p>We can talk about this, but a couple of questions.</p>
<p>One is heat exposure stress in the same way</p>
<p>that the ice bath or cold exposure is stress.</p>
<p>The second one is, is there any difference there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important?</p>
<p>And the other one is how does one get better</p>
<p>at heat adaptation, or at least what are you doing</p>
<p>with the fighters to get them better at dealing with heat?</p>
<p>How long does that take?</p>
<p>So the first question, just because I threw</p>
<p>three questions at you, is heat stress like cold is stress?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it is.</p>
<p>And I think heat shock proteins, for example,</p>
<p>are driven by that stressful exposure</p>
<p>to a changing environment.</p>
<p>So I think we do graded response</p>
<p>in terms of heat acclimation strategies.</p>
<p>But yes, we&rsquo;ve touched on it earlier in the conversation.</p>
<p>For me, heat is still a stressor.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s managed incorrectly,</p>
<p>you can have detrimental responses</p>
<p>rather than beneficial responses.</p>
<p>So barring like hyperthermia and death,</p>
<p>like, I mean, obviously you heat up the brain too much,</p>
<p>people will have seizures and die, but you lose neurons.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the right way to acclimate heat?</p>
<p>Taking into account that people should check</p>
<p>with their doctor, et cetera, we do all these disclaimers.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just say I want to get better</p>
<p>at dealing with heat, or I want to extract</p>
<p>more benefit from heat.</p>
<p>I mean, how many minutes a day are people</p>
<p>typically exposing themselves to heat?</p>
<p>How often and over what periods of time?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we normally start with about 15 minutes of exposure.</p>
<p>Now, if someone&rsquo;s really lacking acclimation to heat,</p>
<p>you can do that in three, five minute efforts.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And actually take time-</p>
<p>This is hot sauna.</p>
<p>Yeah, hot sauna.</p>
<p>Take time to step out.</p>
<p>200 degrees or something like Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>200 Fahrenheit, yes.</p>
<p>And we try to work up to 30 to 40 minutes</p>
<p>to 45 minutes in the sauna continuous.</p>
<p>Now, we have to understand what&rsquo;s the advantage</p>
<p>of heat acclimation for our athletes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, their ability to sweat</p>
<p>and to lose body fluids is going to be advantageous</p>
<p>to their weight cut process, their ability to make weight.</p>
<p>It is a technique that some of these guys adopt.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t have high sweat rates,</p>
<p>it means you&rsquo;re going to have to sit in the sauna</p>
<p>for longer and longer and longer</p>
<p>to get the same delta in sweat release.</p>
<p>So the more acclimated you are,</p>
<p>the more your body is thermogenically adapted,</p>
<p>the more sweat glands you have, the small pores,</p>
<p>you can sweat more and therefore,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll lose that fluid quicker</p>
<p>and you spend less time in the sauna.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we do it, to try and promote,</p>
<p>to limit the exposure.</p>
<p>And it comes back to your first question, is it a stressor?</p>
<p>Absolutely, it&rsquo;s a stressor if you&rsquo;ve got to spend</p>
<p>two hours, over a four-hour period,</p>
<p>two hours of it sat in a sauna because you just-</p>
<p>Where the phone doesn&rsquo;t work, so you can&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>no, just, you know, people just voice them from their phone</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a stressor in itself.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, yes, I think,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>what we do is we, like anything,</p>
<p>we build up in temperature,</p>
<p>but we build up in volume of exposure.</p>
<p>So, you know, we start with 15 minutes</p>
<p>and then we just try to add on and add on across the time.</p>
<p>And now for us, we kind of found about 14 sauna exposures,</p>
<p>starts to really then drive the adaptations</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a quick fix, you know,</p>
<p>a heat acclimation strategy has to happen</p>
<p>long before fight week or long before the fights.</p>
<p>You know, this is a process</p>
<p>that has to begin, you know,</p>
<p>eight to 10 weeks before the fight</p>
<p>so that we can actually get that adaptation</p>
<p>and that tolerance to the stressor,</p>
<p>to the exposure of heat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, until today,</p>
<p>when we talked about this earlier and again now,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that,</p>
<p>but it makes perfect sense now that I hear it,</p>
<p>that heat adaptation is possible,</p>
<p>that you basically can train the body</p>
<p>to become better at cooling itself,</p>
<p>which is what sweating is.</p>
<p>I mean, I should have known that before,</p>
<p>but you know, you don&rsquo;t see that in the textbooks.</p>
<p>And so, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, listen, it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>as the ketogenic conversation, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re training your body</p>
<p>to be more metabolic efficient,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re training your body to tolerate heat more,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re training your body.</p>
<p>Like the body is, you know,</p>
<p>as an organism, as an organic system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hugely adaptable, it&rsquo;s hugely plastic.</p>
<p>But I think the skill is understanding</p>
<p>the whens, the whys, and the where ofs</p>
<p>in terms of changing the overload,</p>
<p>changing the stimulus to drive specific adaptation.</p>
<p>And philosophically,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how we go about our work here.</p>
<p>We talk about adaptation-led programming.</p>
<p>Now, adaptation-led programming</p>
<p>fits into every single category,</p>
<p>not just lifting weights or running track,</p>
<p>it fits into nutrition,</p>
<p>it fits into sitting in the sauna,</p>
<p>it fits into being in a cold bath or not,</p>
<p>it fits into so many different things</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re driven by scientific insights.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we really want to go about our business.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love this concept of adaptation-led programming</p>
<p>and doing that not just in the context</p>
<p>of throwing another plate on the bar</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>but in every aspect of one&rsquo;s training and performance.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s applicable to the recreational athlete too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Would you say that what comes to mind is 12 weeks?</p>
<p>It feels like 12 weeks is a nice block of time</p>
<p>for someone to try something</p>
<p>in terms of to try something new,</p>
<p>see how they adapt, adapt,</p>
<p>and then maybe switch to something new.</p>
<p>I realized that it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to throw a kind of pan timeframe around something.</p>
<p>But in terms of if someone wanted to experiment</p>
<p>with heat adaptation or experiment with cold adaptation</p>
<p>or change up their training regimen or diet</p>
<p>and look at metabolic efficiency,</p>
<p>do you think 12 weeks is a good period of time</p>
<p>to really give something a thorough go</p>
<p>and gain an understanding of how well</p>
<p>or how poorly something works for oneself?</p>
<p>Or would you say eight is enough or three?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how long is a piece of string</p>
<p>for that kind of response, right?</p>
<p>I mean, yes, if we&rsquo;re just talking arbitrary numbers.</p>
<p>Recreational experimenter, yeah.</p>
<p>Three months exposure, 12-week training strategy,</p>
<p>12-week intervention is more than adequate</p>
<p>to say for 99% of things that change within the body</p>
<p>that physiologically adapt to a training stimulus</p>
<p>or an overload stimulus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna start to see either regression or progression,</p>
<p>beneficial or detrimental effects within three months.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I would say so.</p>
<p>Now, listen, I say that in as much as we do</p>
<p>training blocks here that are three weeks long.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because of this constraint</p>
<p>that sometimes people suddenly have to,</p>
<p>they get the call to fight.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah, so it&rsquo;s like super condensed.</p>
<p>And in that scenario, we&rsquo;re always conscious of,</p>
<p>is there a body or this individual,</p>
<p>do they have the ability to tolerate that super overload,</p>
<p>that like super condensed exposure?</p>
<p>Now, we might be doing that purposefully.</p>
<p>We might be trying to do an overreaching strategy</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re really trying to damage or flex something.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean like negatively damaged,</p>
<p>but like we&rsquo;re trying to damage tissue</p>
<p>to really get an adaptive response</p>
<p>versus more drawn out 12-week strategy,</p>
<p>which is more coherent, more planned out,</p>
<p>more structured in nature.</p>
<p>But yeah, for all your listeners, I would say,</p>
<p>if 12 weeks to engage in a process</p>
<p>of trying to change and adapt your body</p>
<p>or expose yourself to something is more than sufficient</p>
<p>to see if it&rsquo;s gonna be the right approach for you.</p>
<p>And I think the individual interpretation</p>
<p>is always has to be considered.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where it comes back</p>
<p>to be a thinking man&rsquo;s athlete</p>
<p>or be a thinking man&rsquo;s trainer,</p>
<p>like someone that&rsquo;s going through exercise.</p>
<p>You have to consciously understand</p>
<p>where your body&rsquo;s at any moment in time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta be real with yourself.</p>
<p>You can create a journal, create a log of your training,</p>
<p>create a log of your feelings,</p>
<p>your subjective feedback of how you felt,</p>
<p>your mood, your sleep.</p>
<p>Do your athletes do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, we try to promote that</p>
<p>because again, that&rsquo;s part of this process.</p>
<p>Might be 12 weeks for you,</p>
<p>but I might get the same responses in eight weeks.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s another critical theme here</p>
<p>is that we could put 15 guys on the mat</p>
<p>and give them the same workout,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s gonna be 15 different responses</p>
<p>to that same workout</p>
<p>because the human organism is so complex</p>
<p>and in nature that it&rsquo;s gonna adapt differently.</p>
<p>Some people will tolerate it.</p>
<p>Some people are gonna be challenged by it.</p>
<p>Some people have got a metabolic makeup</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna promote it.</p>
<p>Some people are metabolically challenged by it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so many different things</p>
<p>that we have to consider.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we try to do here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the cross we bear is that we try to understand</p>
<p>on an individual level</p>
<p>how to optimize athletic performance.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>And the athletes here are so fortunate to have this.</p>
<p>And most people out there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly been trying to encourage people</p>
<p>to learn some science and some mechanism</p>
<p>and become scientists of their own pursuits,</p>
<p>whether or not skill learning or athletic pursuit, et cetera.</p>
<p>As a sort of a final question,</p>
<p>what are some things about the UFC</p>
<p>or something about the UFC</p>
<p>that perhaps people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>in terms of its overall mission</p>
<p>or what you guys are trying to do here?</p>
<p>I mean, I think I&rsquo;ve become a fan of MMA</p>
<p>and I am more and more as time moves on.</p>
<p>Some people might be into MMA,</p>
<p>some people not into watching MMA,</p>
<p>but what are some things that the UFC is interested in</p>
<p>and doing that most people might not know about</p>
<p>and certainly I might not know about?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think,</p>
<p>we try to be cutting edge.</p>
<p>We try to be super progressive.</p>
<p>We think we&rsquo;ve got an amazing platform here,</p>
<p>particularly the Performance Institute</p>
<p>to do some really cool things</p>
<p>that can inform many different people.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t just mean the 600 or so athletes</p>
<p>that are on our global roster.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to do is influence global community</p>
<p>around optimizing human performance.</p>
<p>So any moment in time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re engaging in different technologies</p>
<p>with different vendors, different partners,</p>
<p>exploring opportunities to learn more, share data,</p>
<p>understand what&rsquo;s the best mechanisms</p>
<p>for interpreting your body,</p>
<p>interpreting how your body&rsquo;s responding to training,</p>
<p>interpreting your nutrition or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>We get, we&rsquo;re in a really privileged position to do that.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve also, hence you being here today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also trying to venture</p>
<p>into some really cool areas of science and research</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got applicability</p>
<p>that you can take from high performance athletes</p>
<p>and apply to yourself,</p>
<p>to Joe Blow walking down the street out there</p>
<p>that is really interesting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s everything from whether it&rsquo;s CBD and psychedelics</p>
<p>through to different technologies for thermal monitoring</p>
<p>and Bluetooth heart rate monitoring or whatever it may be</p>
<p>through to data management, et cetera,</p>
<p>and anything in between.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some great partners on the nutrition side,</p>
<p>on the psychology side, on the data side.</p>
<p>And I think we always try to just push the envelope</p>
<p>a little bit more.</p>
<p>I think we keep our core mission with our athletes,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of what we do,</p>
<p>hence your podcast and an amazing platform,</p>
<p>you do such a great job of it,</p>
<p>that we can all learn and take from the elite</p>
<p>and interpret how it might help us</p>
<p>and just in the general population.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s our North Star</p>
<p>is to provide our athletes</p>
<p>the best integrated service of care.</p>
<p>But we also want to influence just the global community</p>
<p>and put UFC at the forefront of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Well, you guys are certainly doing it.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t let the cat out of the bag just yet,</p>
<p>but the things that we&rsquo;re gearing up to do</p>
<p>with my laboratory and the work together,</p>
<p>hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to talk about that</p>
<p>and share that in the year to come,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re very excited about that.</p>
<p>And Duncan, look, I have this filter that I use</p>
<p>when I talk to people, academics or otherwise,</p>
<p>which is some people, they open their mouth</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t make much difference,</p>
<p>but when you speak, I learn so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take the protocols that I&rsquo;ve heard about today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to think about how I&rsquo;m training</p>
<p>and how I could train differently and better,</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;m eating, how I could eat differently and better</p>
<p>for sake of performance and just in general.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time,</p>
<p>your scientific expertise,</p>
<p>the stuff you&rsquo;re doing in the practical realm, it&rsquo;s immense.</p>
<p>So hopefully we can do it again.</p>
<p>Yes, thank you.</p>
<p>This has been a blast.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Yeah, keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>because I know there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there</p>
<p>that love the platform.</p>
<p>So thanks for the invite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for my conversation</p>
<p>with Dr. Duncan French.</p>
<p>I hope you found it as insightful and informative as I did.</p>
