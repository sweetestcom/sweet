<p>complaint is there&rsquo;s not enough fat on</p>
<p>those steaks those are way too lean that</p>
<p>butcher trimmed off too much fat for</p>
<p>that photo we got well it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a piece of art I mean like even the</p>
<p>images like wow okay I want that I want</p>
<p>that we got to make that it&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>and then like even like the my wife</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna be making a lot of things in</p>
<p>here but one thing she likes is the bone</p>
<p>marrow she just loves that bone she can</p>
<p>live on bone marrow oh she&rsquo;s like her</p>
<p>and I would get along because I&rsquo;m a bone</p>
<p>marrow enthusiast but I think a lot of</p>
<p>people miss out on some of the best</p>
<p>parts of the animal you know the bone</p>
<p>marrow the heart the heart can be really</p>
<p>affordable to actually a lot of these</p>
<p>really good parts until the most recent</p>
<p>push with a lot of people getting</p>
<p>interested in like Weston a prices</p>
<p>information and the paleo movement</p>
<p>doctors like yourself you know teaching</p>
<p>people how to eat nose-to-tail and of</p>
<p>course on our channel we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>promoting this as well but people used</p>
<p>to just a few years ago now have no</p>
<p>idea that heart or liver could be so</p>
<p>affordable could be so delicious and I</p>
<p>think people miss out on a lot of the</p>
<p>best pieces of the animal I mean I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get don&rsquo;t get me wrong I love a ribeye</p>
<p>you know I love me a nice t-bone but you</p>
<p>know some of them if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>grass-fed sometimes there&rsquo;s just not</p>
<p>enough fat so that&rsquo;s kind of an issue</p>
<p>here grass-fed is always the way to go</p>
<p>in my opinion right supporting local</p>
<p>cattle ranchers had a local cattle</p>
<p>rancher from a two ranch on my channel</p>
<p>the other day and he&rsquo;s down in Texas and</p>
<p>it was just so cool being just getting</p>
<p>able to see my audience connect with him</p>
<p>and there were people in his local area</p>
<p>who were able to pick up some meat</p>
<p>directly from the producer after</p>
<p>listening to him on the show we always</p>
<p>recommend that but the problem with some</p>
<p>of the grass-fed is</p>
<p>seasonally in certain times of the</p>
<p>season they don&rsquo;t have as much fat so</p>
<p>bone marrow is one of the best things to</p>
<p>use su and also like so yeah we wanted</p>
<p>to teach people how to eat nose-to-tail</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re talking about this all the</p>
<p>time as well teach people how to use the</p>
<p>entire animal and of course how to get</p>
<p>in the good healthy animal fats so this</p>
<p>book what&rsquo;s unique about this book and</p>
<p>thanks so much again for having me on</p>
<p>dr. Berger what&rsquo;s I really really</p>
<p>appreciate you know everything you do on</p>
<p>your channel everything you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>doing to direct people and how to live</p>
<p>healthfully how to eat the right foods</p>
<p>how to do a ketogenic diet the right way</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve done a lot of great work</p>
<p>and you definitely have brought so much</p>
<p>attention to the movement here and been</p>
<p>a really positive influence on so many</p>
<p>people I mean the amount of people who</p>
<p>contacted me and said hey man I found</p>
<p>you and dr. Birds channel and look at</p>
<p>this I lost 100 pounds or I lost 200</p>
<p>pounds or I reversed my type-2 diabetes</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve got my autoimmune condition</p>
<p>under control so many people have told</p>
<p>me that they found keto from dr. Berg</p>
<p>and channels like ours primal edge</p>
<p>health as well but what&rsquo;s cool about</p>
<p>this book is it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s all animal foods</p>
<p>so a lot of people they start doing a</p>
<p>ketogenic diet we actually I&rsquo;m sure you</p>
<p>talked to a lot of these folks as well a</p>
<p>lot of people end up finding that keto</p>
<p>is great but sometimes they have to take</p>
<p>it to the next level and look at maybe</p>
<p>food sensitivities and a lot of people</p>
<p>have been</p>
<p>about a carnivore diet is like the</p>
<p>ultimate elimination diet and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of what I see it as you&rsquo;re removing</p>
<p>any possible irritants you&rsquo;re removing</p>
<p>any possible foods that might be giving</p>
<p>you a reaction and you&rsquo;re whittling it</p>
<p>down to the bare essentials which are</p>
<p>the animal fats and the animal proteins</p>
<p>so whole unrefined animal foods for me</p>
<p>are the crux of my diet are the baseline</p>
<p>of our kids diet as well and they eat</p>
<p>lots of fruit they carbohydrates they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>growing children so we don&rsquo;t put them on</p>
<p>a straight low-carb keto diet but our</p>
<p>whole family eats animal fats in</p>
<p>abundance and the reason we made this</p>
<p>book the way we did it using no plants</p>
<p>at all no plants harmed in the making of</p>
<p>this book it&rsquo;s all animal foods we call</p>
<p>it zero carb recipes for people who</p>
<p>really love animals and you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a cheeky comment kind of</p>
<p>happened to laughs at the ad the vegan</p>
<p>trolls out there but we made this to</p>
<p>help people with autoimmune conditions</p>
<p>people who are trying to get back into</p>
<p>eating meat people who might be doing a</p>
<p>autoimmune protocol type diet or even a</p>
<p>gapps type diet the gut and psychology</p>
<p>syndrome or you know a low fodmap diet</p>
<p>or a full carnivore diet we wanted this</p>
<p>book to be applicable to all these folks</p>
<p>across the board and teach people how to</p>
<p>use the whole animal and how do you nose</p>
<p>the tail and how to get all the</p>
<p>nutrients we need from the most</p>
<p>bioavailable foods that are the most</p>
<p>easily digestible foods in the world</p>
<p>those are always gonna be the animal</p>
<p>foods so to me it&rsquo;s all about the animal</p>
<p>foods and we&rsquo;re really happy to be able</p>
<p>to uh you know put out a book like this</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s unique it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s definitely I thought</p>
<p>was much needed in the space and yeah</p>
<p>Jessica really did a really good job on</p>
<p>this book so I can&rsquo;t take any credit for</p>
<p>it was all her</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just the I&rsquo;m just the the face and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the messenger</p>
<p>exactly don&rsquo;t shoot the messenger right</p>
<p>well um you know years ago I remember</p>
<p>like as a kid but my family is from</p>
<p>Sweden my you know my grandparents stuff</p>
<p>so we would go over to their side of the</p>
<p>family their house and they would they</p>
<p>would have they would cook with large it</p>
<p>cook with lard a lot of lard and you</p>
<p>know I remember in college Chiropractic</p>
<p>College it has been grain that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need etc and fat so I remember eating</p>
<p>bacon and taking this towel and just</p>
<p>dampening out all the grease and</p>
<p>everything and just getting rid all this</p>
<p>fat and like it&rsquo;s bad it has a meaning</p>
<p>of pizza and chips and I&rsquo;m like I got it</p>
<p>wrong but the they back then they a lot</p>
<p>of young lard they which by the way can</p>
<p>potentially have a lot of vitamin D and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing about vitamin D it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really really really hard for people to</p>
<p>get vitamin D unless they know what the</p>
<p>heck they&rsquo;re doing and what 57% of the</p>
<p>population is deficient vitamin D right</p>
<p>there and that&rsquo;s like incredible so</p>
<p>where do you get vitamin D I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you you you can get maybe a little bit</p>
<p>of I think b2 in mushrooms but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not going to satisfy even a fraction and</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re getting enough Sun you</p>
<p>know which very few people do who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna have something everyone&rsquo;s inside</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t go outside they&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>computer all day long like me yeah yeah</p>
<p>but man I live in a beautiful place we</p>
<p>got abundant sunshine year-round and my</p>
<p>job is still indoors on the computer so</p>
<p>I although I you know I love the Sun I</p>
<p>look at it as a nutrient I still very</p>
<p>often don&rsquo;t get enough just because of</p>
<p>the nature of how much I work and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard yeah and so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s just talk a</p>
<p>little bit about vitamin B how important</p>
<p>is person I think it&rsquo;s probably the most</p>
<p>important vitamin especially when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with autoimmune stuff immune</p>
<p>immune immune I mean it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>direct correlation II you but the</p>
<p>problem too is that not only are we</p>
<p>knocking up Sun there&rsquo;s a I familiar</p>
<p>with some of the mutations in the</p>
<p>vitamin D receptor have you kind of got</p>
<p>into that isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>much about and love yeah certain open</p>
<p>assembly there&rsquo;s certain quite a few</p>
<p>part of populations that have mutations</p>
<p>in the vitamin D receptor and you can</p>
<p>test genetic test to see if you have a</p>
<p>called polymorphism and basically you</p>
<p>have this alteration in this receptor</p>
<p>for the vitamin d receptor and another</p>
<p>thing that microbes will do bacteria and</p>
<p>viruses as a strategy is they&rsquo;ll block</p>
<p>your vitamin D receptor to basically</p>
<p>shut down your immune system so they can</p>
<p>take over and so there&rsquo;s a huge huge</p>
<p>connection between vitamin D deficiency</p>
<p>and autoimmune especially when you get</p>
<p>to MS and so there&rsquo;s a whole protocol so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple ways you can fix that</p>
<p>you know you need to take more bottom in</p>
<p>D you need to keep increasing it to the</p>
<p>point where it connects or there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing you can take is in the</p>
<p>medical community it&rsquo;s called vitamin D</p>
<p>and receptor analogues which is</p>
<p>basically it&rsquo;s kind of like a another</p>
<p>thing that kind of pushes in the vitamin</p>
<p>D without having to take vitamin D and</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a certain but the problem is</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re using medications right</p>
<p>there like benicar it&rsquo;s a blood pressure</p>
<p>medication that&rsquo;s a that actually</p>
<p>bypasses the whole system and gives you</p>
<p>some connects vitamin D in there but you</p>
<p>can also use bile salts that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing that you can do Wow yeah bile</p>
<p>salts will help open up that vitamin D</p>
<p>receptor big-time and interesting so I</p>
<p>wonder if there&rsquo;s a connection between</p>
<p>gall bladder function and vitamin D</p>
<p>production in the body as well massive</p>
<p>you you can&rsquo;t without bile and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a bowel deficiency if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a gall bladder if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in bile you&rsquo;re not gonna</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be able to absorb</p>
<p>vitamin d2 well because you need the</p>
<p>bile to break it down at least from</p>
<p>foods but they&rsquo;re even looking now at</p>
<p>infants that are born at certain months</p>
<p>of the year</p>
<p>having less autoimmune based on how much</p>
<p>sunshine the mother got you know if yes</p>
<p>and this is a big this is a big thing a</p>
<p>lot of cultures you know when you look</p>
<p>at this book right here is really cool I</p>
<p>think we might have talked about this</p>
<p>book last time I was on your show I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>crazy I like said my books yes nutrition</p>
<p>and physical degeneration from Weston a</p>
<p>price</p>
<p>he talks about the timing of pregnancy</p>
<p>was kind of important in a lot of these</p>
<p>cultures and they would actually time a</p>
<p>pregnancy around the abundance of</p>
<p>certain foods you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting a lot of these foods were</p>
<p>vitamin D rich foods that these</p>
<p>different cultures were using as</p>
<p>fertility boosting foods so you know</p>
<p>certain shellfish were used a lot also</p>
<p>here in the Andes they would trade for</p>
<p>this little egg called an antelope they</p>
<p>from the anima look basically and this</p>
<p>is a skatelite creature and it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>unfertilized egg and it&rsquo;s got a lot of</p>
<p>iodine and very likely of course because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sea creature probably a</p>
<p>significant amount of vitamin D and</p>
<p>pregnancy would be time in a lot of</p>
<p>these cultures so that the children</p>
<p>could be born under the most optimal</p>
<p>environmental conditions of course you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want a kid born in the middle of</p>
<p>winter when the mothers already depleted</p>
<p>when the food supply is so crap you know</p>
<p>so then I think it&rsquo;s very very important</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>observation you just made there well you</p>
<p>even like ms occurs in blatte&rsquo; twos</p>
<p>above a certain amount a lot actually</p>
<p>higher than a certain latitude so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting the Sun your risk</p>
<p>factor for MS goes straight up and</p>
<p>vertical simply because of vitamin D</p>
<p>vitamin D is going to be a modulator</p>
<p>involved in two thousand genes I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s so key now unless that</p>
<p>person living in the north is consuming</p>
<p>salmon or fish eggs which is loaded with</p>
<p>vitamin D so college school those</p>
<p>cultures would have been doing just a</p>
<p>few generations back right until you get</p>
<p>the bread you get the grains you get</p>
<p>Cheerios in every place you get</p>
<p>pasteurized milk which basically turns</p>
<p>it into something that I wouldn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to even give to my dog when you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>you know raw milk that you know your</p>
<p>your ancestors in Sweden and they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>Swiss also we&rsquo;re using an abundance and</p>
<p>some of these cultures living almost</p>
<p>exclusively off of raw cheese&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fermented dairy products and raw fresh</p>
<p>milk you know I mean these are great</p>
<p>foods but you pasteurize it you give</p>
<p>people the weep the corn the soy and</p>
<p>they leave their heritage foods behind</p>
<p>and look what happens we get obesity we</p>
<p>get diabetes shoot ms I mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such a fascinating correlation</p>
<p>there and you know now that I think</p>
<p>about it here in Ecuador on</p>
<p>equator you see very few people with MS</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s not as common</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not seeing things like rickets</p>
<p>very often here either and the diet is</p>
<p>pretty westernized right there is a lot</p>
<p>of Western disease coming in from the</p>
<p>vegetable oils from the junk food that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting here and you know</p>
<p>coca-cola and all this crap that people</p>
<p>drink here instead of you know water</p>
<p>right you know maybe a little buttered</p>
<p>coffee if you guys are into it but yeah</p>
<p>the the diet is definitely degenerated</p>
<p>in a lot of these areas and of course</p>
<p>the disconnection from the Sun coupling</p>
<p>with that is going to create a massive</p>
<p>health deficit and the immune system is</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s just not gonna function it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not in fact those of you that are</p>
<p>watching if you wanted to do a</p>
<p>five-second test to see if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in vitamin D do this okay</p>
<p>you just need to press on your shin</p>
<p>because the phone right on your your</p>
<p>lower leg and see it press pretty hard</p>
<p>and see if there&rsquo;s any tenderness and</p>
<p>then or and then you can press on your</p>
<p>sternum right here there&rsquo;s bone your</p>
<p>breast bone press in there if it&rsquo;s sore</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s very painful chances are you may</p>
<p>be a low in vitamin D and what you do</p>
<p>take some vitamin D we chuck it in one</p>
<p>hour and that pain will be completely</p>
<p>gone because one of the big symptoms of</p>
<p>vitamin D deficiency is bone pain</p>
<p>interesting yeah their rickets is really</p>
<p>common and a lot of the Western world as</p>
<p>well I mean unfortunately we see a lot</p>
<p>of well there&rsquo;s a there was a news</p>
<p>article that was circulating around this</p>
<p>year about a girl that had such bad</p>
<p>rickets and such bad you know vitamin</p>
<p>and mineral deficiency from her parents</p>
<p>raising her on a very restrictive vegan</p>
<p>diet and you know not saying that every</p>
<p>single kid raised on a vegan diet is</p>
<p>gonna manifest these symptoms but this</p>
<p>was a specific case that was pretty</p>
<p>shocking I think she was a British girl</p>
<p>and this 12 he she was 9 or 12 and just</p>
<p>really debilitating rickets and this</p>
<p>girl was in such bad shape the parents</p>
<p>were actually I believe legally held</p>
<p>responsible for it so yeah I get that</p>
<p>vitamin D so now what are you some of</p>
<p>your preferred vitamin D sources as far</p>
<p>as a dietary sources go</p>
<p>hands-down the best one is going to be</p>
<p>cod liver oil or Cobb liver you you ever</p>
<p>you ever have the cat liver in a can you</p>
<p>can actually get it yeah yeah I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>cans full of it here it&rsquo;s great it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny because we got some some little</p>
<p>recipes that we like to make and the</p>
<p>kids like it too that kind of used the</p>
<p>cod livers and our kids really like like</p>
<p>some low carb red things with the cod</p>
<p>livers on them are these little flax</p>
<p>pancakes and my wife makes but you know</p>
<p>I think with the polyunsaturated fatty</p>
<p>level of flax I&rsquo;ve kind of backed off of</p>
<p>using so much of it but excuse me well</p>
<p>yeah cod livers are good my kids will</p>
<p>eat a whole can of it it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like pudding</p>
<p>but the Colliver if you take what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s different about cod</p>
<p>liver than fish oils the cod liver has</p>
<p>not just DHA and EPA but it has vitamin</p>
<p>D and vitamin A and a perfect 50/50</p>
<p>split so you get the benefits of vitamin</p>
<p>A which is essential for night vision in</p>
<p>internal skin internal like lesions in</p>
<p>turn like ulcers and stuff like that</p>
<p>sinus stuff you mucous membranes dry</p>
<p>eyes dry mouth that&rsquo;s vitamin A so like</p>
<p>we have a baby in the house right now</p>
<p>Lucy&rsquo;s little Lucy my son&rsquo;s daughter and</p>
<p>grandfather she&rsquo;s four months she can</p>
<p>graduate this is your first grandchild</p>
<p>yeah yeah congratulations</p>
<p>yeah we haven&rsquo;t talked since that is so</p>
<p>cool yeah is it is it kind of like</p>
<p>having your own baby except without all</p>
<p>the responsibility stuff it&rsquo;s wonderful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cool I don&rsquo;t have to change the</p>
<p>diaper I can just go in there play with</p>
<p>her and then give her back yeah she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crying not my responsibility</p>
<p>exactly I&rsquo;ll have to jeez I did a video</p>
<p>with her it was just kind of like ah yes</p>
<p>it was for clickbait but I I took Lucy</p>
<p>and I just I actually held her and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t say anything you did the whole</p>
<p>video on the board holding Lucy and no</p>
<p>one even paid attention so but I got a</p>
<p>lot of clicks but Lucy is a very healthy</p>
<p>baby and you know she&rsquo;s breastfed and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making sure that her mother Jordi</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s married to</p>
<p>my son Jordan is doing all the right</p>
<p>things nutrition-wise but you know Lucy</p>
<p>is really hungry so the only two things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re feeding it right now just</p>
<p>small amounts will be cod liver well and</p>
<p>just a little bit each day as well as</p>
<p>grass-fed pasture egg yolks</p>
<p>not the whites just the yolk yeah push</p>
<p>it up give it to her she just sucks it</p>
<p>up like crazy you should see her after</p>
<p>that the collar all she loves it</p>
<p>her teeth are gonna come in perfect her</p>
<p>skin she has the big cheeks she&rsquo;s such a</p>
<p>healthy baby so um yeah so that&rsquo;s um you</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s interesting our daughter she</p>
<p>had some dental caries which is kind of</p>
<p>what threw us into this looking into</p>
<p>high-fat nutrition you know actually I</p>
<p>would have never been into a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet as far as my life timeline goes I</p>
<p>would have never probably heard of keto</p>
<p>were worried so much about getting in</p>
<p>enough animal fats had my daughter not</p>
<p>experience dental caries so she she had</p>
<p>you know which is choose decay if for</p>
<p>those of you don&rsquo;t know very rampant in</p>
<p>the Western world now you&rsquo;d be amazed at</p>
<p>how many kids get teeth extracted before</p>
<p>their adult teeth come in she had some</p>
<p>dental carriers and it freaked us out we</p>
<p>learned about the principles that were</p>
<p>taught by Weston a price we read his</p>
<p>book started looking into kind of</p>
<p>ancestral nutrition what were people</p>
<p>eating just a few generations back</p>
<p>before they had all these issues with</p>
<p>health with teeth he was noticing that</p>
<p>tuberculosis love levels in these</p>
<p>countries in these societies pre</p>
<p>industrialized food supply</p>
<p>there was no tuberculosis there was no</p>
<p>dental caries their jaws were formed</p>
<p>properly the women had easier childbirth</p>
<p>because their hips were wide enough and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t see this so much in the Western</p>
<p>world now with you know really</p>
<p>degenerated food supply the women&rsquo;s hips</p>
<p>are getting closer together a lot of</p>
<p>people have difficulty in birth and a</p>
<p>lot of kids have dental caries so this</p>
<p>led us to actually researching the</p>
<p>importance of fats the importance of fat</p>
<p>soluble vitamins so back in 2012 this is</p>
<p>what kind of sparked our journey 2013</p>
<p>and must&rsquo;ve been because she was born in</p>
<p>2012 and yeah we gave her lots of butter</p>
<p>you know for the</p>
<p>the vitamin k2 butter is also a pretty</p>
<p>decent source of vitamin D lots of</p>
<p>animal fats we started giving her liver</p>
<p>grass-fed beef liver and of course egg</p>
<p>yolks were another one of her favorites</p>
<p>and she her teeth hardened up they</p>
<p>stopped the tooth decay was able to be</p>
<p>stopped in its tracks and now her adult</p>
<p>teeth are coming in and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>perfectly normal our second child he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got perfect teeth you know he was</p>
<p>blessed enough to be raised on a on a</p>
<p>lot of animal foods and like you said</p>
<p>the first the first food we gave him</p>
<p>were raw egg yolks egg yolks from our</p>
<p>chickens you know III as a child I</p>
<p>craved butter and I didn&rsquo;t know of</p>
<p>course I didn&rsquo;t connected up that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>vitamin k2 k2 is what I needed and I had</p>
<p>every single Tuesday the cavity you know</p>
<p>but k2 ISM is fascinating it works with</p>
<p>vitamin d3 in k2 is essential in the</p>
<p>transportation of the calcium out of the</p>
<p>soft tissues into the bone but it really</p>
<p>makes really good teeth solid teeth good</p>
<p>bone structure but k2 also people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize this it gives you more cardiac</p>
<p>output so let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exercising and you just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite have that endurance and you want</p>
<p>more just take some k2 that&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>that edge because it outputs more energy</p>
<p>from the mitochondria it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>about calcium but it&rsquo;s uh I&rsquo;ll usually</p>
<p>take it before I&rsquo;ll work out maybe about</p>
<p>an hour before and I can go up hills</p>
<p>like crazy so it&rsquo;s definitely great yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool I actually had not heard</p>
<p>that factoid I think you know people get</p>
<p>so afraid of these fats they think lard</p>
<p>they think butter they think fatty</p>
<p>snakes they think fatty meat I think</p>
<p>bone marrow or you know even you know</p>
<p>brain where these are full of dangerous</p>
<p>cholesterol and saturated fat that</p>
<p>saturated fat is so bad but um people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize how important these things</p>
<p>are I mean your your whole body is made</p>
<p>of cholesterol yeah I think I forget how</p>
<p>many pounds of cholesterol we actually</p>
<p>have in our body but it&rsquo;s ridiculous I</p>
<p>mean every one of our cells is the cell</p>
<p>walls are made of a cholesterol our</p>
<p>brain is made up of cholesterol</p>
<p>we need fats and the body just runs so</p>
<p>efficiently when we use fat as if</p>
<p>fuel source I think yeah the the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet and you know even a</p>
<p>carnivorous diet which is becoming much</p>
<p>more popular now the way I like to teach</p>
<p>a carnivore diet is using nose-to-tail</p>
<p>eating and making it more of a ketogenic</p>
<p>carnivore diet so a lot of people focus</p>
<p>a little bit more on just eating as much</p>
<p>steak as they can and I like to teach</p>
<p>people how to actually use the fat</p>
<p>because you know things like sheep fat</p>
<p>beef suet these are really affordable</p>
<p>and you can get these from you know</p>
<p>local rancher you can get these from</p>
<p>places like I don&rsquo;t know if you you know</p>
<p>like us wellness maybe some of these</p>
<p>groups i order laughs John John woods</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s uh he&rsquo;s actually coming to my</p>
<p>summit meeting with one of the sponsors</p>
<p>and he can see samples out there Mike</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s the best it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>grass-fed a hundred percent but he you</p>
<p>know he he&rsquo;s very you should talk to him</p>
<p>sometime interview him on your show you</p>
<p>maybe you have but fascinating</p>
<p>understanding of grass-fed and what it</p>
<p>does nutritional and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>awesome you know there&rsquo;s another um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another person I&rsquo;ll have to turn</p>
<p>you on to you could do an interview on</p>
<p>her she&rsquo;s a podiatrist she&rsquo;s a surgeon</p>
<p>as well for the feet right and this is</p>
<p>what she told me and you could probably</p>
<p>ask her more about this but I just I was</p>
<p>like it just stuck with me she was doing</p>
<p>she goes you know you got different</p>
<p>colored people on the outside but then</p>
<p>the inside they&rsquo;re all the same color</p>
<p>and then she said except vegans and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like what are you talking about she goes</p>
<p>yeah when I if someone is a vegan when</p>
<p>you cut their foot open all the the the</p>
<p>muscle is like gray like what well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like okay that&rsquo;s interesting so anyway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what is her name again</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll find out I have it in my database</p>
<p>and you can you could talk to her and</p>
<p>get more data but I just stuck with me</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t really ask her too</p>
<p>much more about that but I was like oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s interesting yeah then they</p>
<p>you started to tell deeper into some of</p>
<p>this information you start looking at</p>
<p>the importance of these animal fats the</p>
<p>importance of these animal foods for</p>
<p>everything from fertility to bone</p>
<p>mineral density to you know maintaining</p>
<p>lean muscle mass and it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>important that we look at you know</p>
<p>animal foods as a I mean I I make it the</p>
<p>most important part of my diet and I</p>
<p>think that people who are maybe</p>
<p>vegetarian leaning should at least</p>
<p>consider including some and maybe you</p>
<p>know replace if you&rsquo;re eating tofu and</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;ve been misled right the tofu</p>
<p>is not healthier for us than a steak and</p>
<p>a nice marbled steak will always say she</p>
<p>ate as well as any other food on the</p>
<p>planet and it&rsquo;s yeah the the fats the</p>
<p>animal fats are crucial so I mean one of</p>
<p>my favorite fast is this suet when I</p>
<p>like to do is I&rsquo;ll take a steak I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>cook a steak I&rsquo;ll cook it real rare I</p>
<p>like it rare and then I&rsquo;ll take some</p>
<p>little chopped up the suet in some</p>
<p>little bit so maybe just pull off peel</p>
<p>off a little disk of it the suet being</p>
<p>the fat around the kidney of a ruminant</p>
<p>animal and and I&rsquo;ll just warm it up a</p>
<p>little bit on the skillet there I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>still leave that really rare and</p>
<p>basically raw in the middle but that fat</p>
<p>is just so good it&rsquo;s so easy to digest</p>
<p>compared to most other fats for me and I</p>
<p>just yeah I love it so animal fats are</p>
<p>crucial and hey nothing wrong with</p>
<p>coconut oil if you can handle the</p>
<p>coconut oil if you can handle the</p>
<p>coconut oil it&rsquo;s great but when you look</p>
<p>at something like you mentioned you know</p>
<p>pastured lard having you know with if</p>
<p>the pigs are outdoors pastured lard is</p>
<p>going to have significant amounts of</p>
<p>vitamin D the higher vitamin D content</p>
<p>than almost any other food you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>find foods like cod livers you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s actually some vitamin D also in</p>
<p>beef liver as well as vitamin A you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna find that if you replace those</p>
<p>plant fats that you&rsquo;ve been focused on</p>
<p>thinking that those plant fats are</p>
<p>healthy especially those vegetable oils</p>
<p>man like the those are the worst</p>
<p>offenders</p>
<p>what are you sir soils not good is that</p>
<p>well unfortunately that&rsquo;s my worst enemy</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s crazy a lot of these</p>
<p>people that hate me so much in the you</p>
<p>know these vegans who hate me so much</p>
<p>those poor guys are eating this stuff</p>
<p>regularly the cottonseed oil the corn</p>
<p>oil canola</p>
<p>well canola oils like these grapeseed</p>
<p>oil it just doesn&rsquo;t that sound delicious</p>
<p>it sounds real good literally yeah in</p>
<p>college I think you know because I had</p>
<p>this fixed idea that you know I need to</p>
<p>get rid of fat because just being</p>
<p>grained in you I um I made some meatloaf</p>
<p>right and I didn&rsquo;t read the recipe that</p>
<p>well because it&rsquo;s said to drain some of</p>
<p>the excess grease so I ate a pound of</p>
<p>meat loaf but of course I put an entire</p>
<p>loaf of bread in there and not to</p>
<p>mention a whole bunch of ketchup right</p>
<p>well that started my gallbladder problem</p>
<p>I mean that was probably that and of</p>
<p>course we&rsquo;re doing deep frying with</p>
<p>Crisco so I was ingrained in like fats</p>
<p>bad but it wasn&rsquo;t a fat it&rsquo;s not the fat</p>
<p>it was the ketchup the bread and the</p>
<p>trans fats so just it&rsquo;s just another</p>
<p>point that got me off track for probably</p>
<p>a decade before I came full circle and</p>
<p>realize you can do fat as long as you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t add all the carbs and sugar you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t add sugar you&rsquo;re like you say well</p>
<p>meeting about a meeting ice cream yeah</p>
<p>but it has so much sugar in it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna create sticky blood in all sorts</p>
<p>of issues you know yeah if you want to</p>
<p>gain weight as quickly as you can eat a</p>
<p>lot of carbs and a lot of fat at the</p>
<p>same time oh yeah just gain as much</p>
<p>weight as you can and now I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking about good weight I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking about you know all right you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting on muscle I&rsquo;m talking about you</p>
<p>just want to gain a bunch of weight</p>
<p>mostly fat do that eat carbs and fat in</p>
<p>a great abundance you know I&rsquo;d say if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do a high carb diet you</p>
<p>definitely need to eat less fat if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be healthy right these</p>
<p>insulin signaling is I mean a lot of us</p>
<p>on the low-carb community we talk about</p>
<p>insulin resistance right insulin</p>
<p>resistance being the root of many</p>
<p>diseases them even be highly implicated</p>
<p>in heart disease but we don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that fat does play a role in insulin</p>
<p>resistance as well let me explain so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not trying to make anybody afraid of fat</p>
<p>but understand this principle when you</p>
<p>eat a ketogenic diet we need a high-fat</p>
<p>diet your muscle tissues don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>take up glucose because you save the</p>
<p>glucose for certain parts of the body</p>
<p>that require</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re parts of the brain that need</p>
<p>glucose your liver is gonna partition</p>
<p>the glucose that you do have so what</p>
<p>happens is your muscle tissues will be</p>
<p>using fat for fuel when you&rsquo;re using fat</p>
<p>for fuel and there&rsquo;s an abundance of fat</p>
<p>in the muscles and in the tissues in the</p>
<p>blood it signals your body not to take</p>
<p>up glucose because you should be either</p>
<p>using glucose or fat right and of course</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a binary system we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>constantly using both fuel sources</p>
<p>throughout the day but your muscle</p>
<p>tissues don&rsquo;t want to take up glucose</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re burning fat as fuel so when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking in a high-fat diet if you</p>
<p>add a bunch of sugar to that your body</p>
<p>is going to become physiologically</p>
<p>insulin resistant because your muscles</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to take up the glucose</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re being told like it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re being tricked into thinking that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a fasting state or in a</p>
<p>ketogenic state where you&rsquo;re using fat</p>
<p>for fuel and you don&rsquo;t use glucose in</p>
<p>the muscles if you take in a bunch of</p>
<p>fat and carbs at the same time you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make yourself insulin resistant and you</p>
<p>will store body fat and that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>start storing in the liver you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>get fatty liver then once you start</p>
<p>storing that visceral fat it creates</p>
<p>systemic insulin resistant that is just</p>
<p>very very difficult to get rid of if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to continue eating</p>
<p>carbohydrates so that&rsquo;s why pulling out</p>
<p>the cards not worried about fat not</p>
<p>saying pull out the fat eating a</p>
<p>ketogenic diet that you are burning fat</p>
<p>in will allow you to get rid of that</p>
<p>insulin resistance and burn the body fat</p>
<p>eventually so it&rsquo;s important to realize</p>
<p>that both of those together a deadly</p>
<p>combo you&rsquo;re talking about something I</p>
<p>think just I just did a video I have a</p>
<p>very interesting this is yeah this one</p>
<p>right here you can see that evidence</p>
<p>that acute insulin administration</p>
<p>enhances LDL cholesterol susceptibility</p>
<p>to oxidation there you go so insulin</p>
<p>increasing oxidation of cholesterol yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so basically up here and it talks</p>
<p>about also you get oxidized cholesterol</p>
<p>if insulin is high even if your blood</p>
<p>sugars are normal so if you have instant</p>
<p>resistance you&rsquo;re pumping out your body</p>
<p>is making more insulin it&rsquo;s not coming</p>
<p>necessarily from the sugar your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just making</p>
<p>more and that is oxidizing the</p>
<p>cholesterol so when people see their</p>
<p>cholesterol out of control when they</p>
<p>start a ketogenic diet whatever realize</p>
<p>that that is going to improve as insulin</p>
<p>resistance goes away and as you do it</p>
<p>longer because your system is changing</p>
<p>over and it&rsquo;s becoming more efficient</p>
<p>but um you know it&rsquo;s also the</p>
<p>cholesterol that&rsquo;s not oxidized should</p>
<p>we worry about that some of the</p>
<p>questions guys like Dave Feldman and I</p>
<p>think you talked to Dave right yeah I</p>
<p>new friends with he&rsquo;s a great guy he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a lot of good work at cholesterol</p>
<p>co.com</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve done a lot of good work</p>
<p>raising awareness of this on your side</p>
<p>as well so I&rsquo;m sure if anybody was a</p>
<p>searched cholesterol in dr. Berg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>videos you&rsquo;d find some great information</p>
<p>about why we don&rsquo;t necessarily need to</p>
<p>worry about high cholesterol some of us</p>
<p>on a ketogenic or high-fat diet do get</p>
<p>elevated cholesterol the cholesterol is</p>
<p>not the boogeyman that has been made out</p>
<p>to be just like you know glucose in and</p>
<p>of itself is not bad but when you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>an overabundance of glucose you can get</p>
<p>those an advanced glycation end-products</p>
<p>we can start to get a lot of oxidative</p>
<p>stress in the body it&rsquo;s about balance</p>
<p>right so if you&rsquo;re getting oxidation of</p>
<p>LDL from all that insulin then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have issues and they&rsquo;re blaming</p>
<p>the fat for what clearly the sugar and</p>
<p>the insulin are very likely highly</p>
<p>culpable in and of course the body&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>so simple as you know black and white</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot going on you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>systems interacting with other systems</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a beautiful delicate dance</p>
<p>within us but uh but the cholesterol is</p>
<p>not the enemy maybe the insulin is the</p>
<p>dang enemy it is it is no doubt</p>
<p>absolutely it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the thing I</p>
<p>mean you you you work with clients you</p>
<p>see the results some probably all that</p>
<p>long people are reporting oh I lost all</p>
<p>this weight my diabetes my heart is</p>
<p>getting better and you just like like I</p>
<p>do a show on Friday morning and I have a</p>
<p>nice chance to just to get a sample from</p>
<p>all over the world people calling in and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just over and over and over it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like massive results this is what</p>
<p>happened I lost another you know ten</p>
<p>pounds of my cholesterol everything came</p>
<p>back I mean like it&rsquo;s just like over and</p>
<p>over and over I mean</p>
<p>very few people that ever said they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not like winning like crazy and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no one that says they&rsquo;re getting worse</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m like wow you know what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty obvious to me that it&rsquo;s the way</p>
<p>to go yeah it&rsquo;s pretty amazing I mean it</p>
<p>makes my day when I get people from you</p>
<p>know clients said I did private coaching</p>
<p>with two to three years ago sometimes</p>
<p>will contact me and just update me on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happened and they&rsquo;ll send me</p>
<p>pictures and I&rsquo;ll recognize the before</p>
<p>picture but it almost like did you</p>
<p>photoshop this this is a different</p>
<p>person and it&rsquo;s just so ridiculous to</p>
<p>see you know people lose in a hundred</p>
<p>pounds in eight months is I mean these</p>
<p>are the regular stories that I&rsquo;m hearing</p>
<p>these are regular testimonials that</p>
<p>people are sending to me and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fun to be able to work with so</p>
<p>many people and to actually you know</p>
<p>helped them where they&rsquo;ve yo-yo dieted</p>
<p>before they&rsquo;ve never been able to find</p>
<p>something that they can maintain a</p>
<p>sustained long-term and a ketogenic and</p>
<p>a low-carb approach where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>focusing on healthy fats healthy fats</p>
<p>from animals whole unrefined sources of</p>
<p>food real human nutrition and they get</p>
<p>the results they wanted their whole life</p>
<p>and they do it effortlessly and</p>
<p>enjoyably and then they start changing</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s lives around them because</p>
<p>everyone asks them hey what it what</p>
<p>happened what did you do you know</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;ll send their friends and</p>
<p>family my way I don&rsquo;t have come to me</p>
<p>for coaching or something or we do a our</p>
<p>keto and carnivore collective or group</p>
<p>coaching thing we do this each month</p>
<p>where we run it sort of like a course</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s with a lot of live interactive</p>
<p>voice chats so we do two voice chats</p>
<p>every single week and one of those is a</p>
<p>lesson then another one&rsquo;s a Q&amp;A where</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s bouncing ideas off of each</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s supporting each other and we</p>
<p>use a you know private forum for this so</p>
<p>each month we&rsquo;ve got a different group</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just amazing seeing these</p>
<p>people and their friends and family</p>
<p>learning so much and integrating these</p>
<p>principles into their life and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>amazing seeing how transformative it can</p>
<p>be and I know you probably feel the same</p>
<p>way for me it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>normal now it&rsquo;s like I don&rsquo;t get hungry</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s okay if I go for a</p>
<p>heavy workout or something and I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eaten all day I might feel kind of</p>
<p>hungry before the meal but it&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>like it was before where it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>shig after a meal my blood sugar is up</p>
<p>and down all day you know inflammatory</p>
<p>responses from food digestive issues</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had in the past you know these</p>
<p>things that have been so detrimental to</p>
<p>my quality of life you know I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to take them for granted at all and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not saying I take them for granted but</p>
<p>the new normal it can be it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>interesting the new normal is so</p>
<p>different from what it used to be for me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s cool talking to people all the</p>
<p>time and seeing them on their path and</p>
<p>seeing where they&rsquo;re at in their journey</p>
<p>because I do sometimes forget what it</p>
<p>felt like in my own life because it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>far back behind me but then you know</p>
<p>talking to clients all the time and</p>
<p>seeing people out there in the trenches</p>
<p>trying to get their life back trying to</p>
<p>get their health back you know kit helps</p>
<p>to keep me grounded and keep me</p>
<p>appreciative and you know kind of</p>
<p>appreciate the blessings of being able</p>
<p>to function well in human body being</p>
<p>able to have mental clarity to have</p>
<p>stable blood glucose levels have low</p>
<p>inflammation levels and the fuel your</p>
<p>body with fat and you know getting the</p>
<p>nose-to-tail nutrition from animal foods</p>
<p>is something that has just really</p>
<p>changed the game for me and my family</p>
<p>and for you know I&rsquo;m sure millions of</p>
<p>people who tune into your channel as</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s just really cool you know I</p>
<p>mean we don&rsquo;t get TV spots you know you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see dr. Berg or Tristan from</p>
<p>primal edge health getting invited on on</p>
<p>dr. oz although I don&rsquo;t know man maybe</p>
<p>you one day could get jump on the dr. oz</p>
<p>train but I wouldn&rsquo;t even if he called I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t do it I wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>interested in all this it&rsquo;s not mine not</p>
<p>my gig it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s two commercially</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into yeah that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so cool</p>
<p>so many people through your platform on</p>
<p>YouTube and change so many lives and you</p>
<p>know at some of these YouTube channels</p>
<p>yours being one of the biggest ones I</p>
<p>mean you&rsquo;re probably getting as many</p>
<p>people watching your videos every week</p>
<p>as even tuned into something like dr. oz</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m not trying to toot your</p>
<p>horn or inflame ego too big but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you reach a lot of people for free</p>
<p>through YouTube with information that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just giving out so you know I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s great what guys</p>
<p>like you were doing and you know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s anybody out there who</p>
<p>works as hard I put out two videos every</p>
<p>day as you do them mom-mom</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
