    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we continue our discussion of the senses,</p>
<p>and the senses we are going to discuss</p>
<p>are pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>Pain and pleasure reflect two opposite ends of a continuum,</p>
<p>a continuum that involves detection of things in our skin</p>
<p>and the perception, the understanding</p>
<p>of what those events are.</p>
<p>Our skin is our largest sensory organ</p>
<p>and our largest organ indeed.</p>
<p>It is much larger than any of the other organs in our body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an odd organ if you think about it.</p>
<p>It has so many functions.</p>
<p>It acts as a barrier between our organs</p>
<p>and the outside world.</p>
<p>It harbors neurons, nerve cells,</p>
<p>that allow us to detect things like light touch</p>
<p>or temperature or pressure of various kinds.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an organ that we hang ornaments on.</p>
<p>People put earrings in their ears.</p>
<p>People decorate their skin with tattoos</p>
<p>and inks and other things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an organ that allows us to experience</p>
<p>either great pain or great pleasure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a multifaceted organ,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one that our brain needs to make sense of</p>
<p>in a multifaceted way.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to discuss all that.</p>
<p>And most importantly, how you can experience more pleasure</p>
<p>and less pain by understanding these pathways.</p>
<p>We will also discuss things you can do.</p>
<p>And if you wish, things you can take</p>
<p>that will allow you to experience more pleasure</p>
<p>and less pain in response to a variety</p>
<p>of different experiences.</p>
<p>Before I go any further,</p>
<p>I want to highlight a particularly exciting area of science</p>
<p>that relates to the skin</p>
<p>and to sensing of pleasure and pain,</p>
<p>but has everything to do with motivation.</p>
<p>Motivation is something that many people struggle with.</p>
<p>Not everybody, but most people experience dips</p>
<p>and peaks in their motivation,</p>
<p>even if they really want something.</p>
<p>How should we think about these changes in motivation?</p>
<p>What do they reflect?</p>
<p>Well, at a very basic level, they reflect fluctuations,</p>
<p>changes in the levels of a chemical called dopamine.</p>
<p>Most of us have heard of dopamine.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a neuromodulator,</p>
<p>meaning it modulates or changes the way</p>
<p>that neurons, nerve cells work.</p>
<p>Most of us have heard that dopamine</p>
<p>is the molecule of pleasure.</p>
<p>However, that is incorrect.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a molecule of motivation and anticipation.</p>
<p>To illustrate how dopamine works,</p>
<p>I want to highlight some very important work,</p>
<p>largely carried out by the laboratory</p>
<p>of a guy named Wolfram Schultz.</p>
<p>The Schultz Laboratory has done dozens</p>
<p>of excellent experiments on the dopamine system</p>
<p>and have identified something called reward prediction error.</p>
<p>Although in some sense, you can think about it</p>
<p>as reward prediction variance,</p>
<p>changes in the levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you expect a reward</p>
<p>and whether or not you get the reward.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to make this very simple.</p>
<p>Dopamine is released into the brain and body</p>
<p>and generally makes us feel activated and motivated</p>
<p>and as if we have energy to pursue a goal.</p>
<p>And it is released into the brain and body</p>
<p>in anticipation of a reward.</p>
<p>Measurements of dopamine have been made</p>
<p>in animals and humans.</p>
<p>And what you find is that when we anticipate a reward,</p>
<p>dopamine is released.</p>
<p>We will put in the work to achieve that reward.</p>
<p>That work could be mental work or physical work,</p>
<p>but when the reward arrives,</p>
<p>dopamine levels drop back down to baseline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>When we receive a reward,</p>
<p>dopamine levels go back down to baseline.</p>
<p>So the way to envision this is you can just imagine</p>
<p>a sort of increase in dopamine as we anticipate something,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working towards it, we&rsquo;re working towards a goal,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re excited about seeing somebody or meeting somebody</p>
<p>or receiving some reward,</p>
<p>and then the reward comes and dopamine goes down.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s all fine and good,</p>
<p>but there is a way to get much more dopamine</p>
<p>out of that process and therefore a way</p>
<p>to have much more motivation, energy, and focus</p>
<p>because those are the consequences of elevated dopamine.</p>
<p>The way to do that is to not deliver the reward</p>
<p>on an expected schedule.</p>
<p>So experiments have been done</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an anticipation of a reward, there&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>and then the reward only arrives every other</p>
<p>or every third bout of work, okay?</p>
<p>So this would be like getting a pat on the head</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a dog or perhaps a child or an adult,</p>
<p>or getting a monetary reward only for every third project</p>
<p>or every third race that you win.</p>
<p>Pick any kind of goal, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>These molecules don&rsquo;t care about what you&rsquo;re pursuing,</p>
<p>they are a common currency of different types of activities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a regular reward schedule,</p>
<p>and it will not alter the pattern of dopamine release</p>
<p>that I described before.</p>
<p>However, if the reward arrives intermittently,</p>
<p>almost randomly, so you anticipate a reward as a maybe,</p>
<p>it might come, it might come,</p>
<p>then you work, work, work, work, work, no reward.</p>
<p>You repeat the work, work, work, work, work, work,</p>
<p>and then you get a reward.</p>
<p>So some trials you do, some trials you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely random.</p>
<p>Under those conditions, the amplitude,</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released into your system</p>
<p>and the motivation to continue working hard</p>
<p>or playing whatever kind of game you&rsquo;re playing,</p>
<p>doubles or triples.</p>
<p>And this is the basis of things like slot machines</p>
<p>and gambling, and this is why so many people</p>
<p>will give so much of their money up to casinos,</p>
<p>and the casinos always win.</p>
<p>Sometimes people walk away with more money</p>
<p>than they came to the casino with,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of the time,</p>
<p>the house wins, as they say.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because they understand</p>
<p>intermittent reward schedules,</p>
<p>and you can apply this to stay motivated</p>
<p>in your own pursuits.</p>
<p>Rather than thinking about the pleasure of a reward,</p>
<p>understand that dopamine is released</p>
<p>in response to anticipation of a reward,</p>
<p>and that is the fuel for work.</p>
<p>And every once in a while, at random, remove the reward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way to continue to stay motivated,</p>
<p>not to reward every action or every goal.</p>
<p>And this is also true if you&rsquo;re trying to train up children</p>
<p>or train up players on a team,</p>
<p>you should not celebrate every win.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a little counterintuitive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go more into the biology of dopamine</p>
<p>and how it relates to the pleasure system</p>
<p>later on in the podcast,</p>
<p>but for now, understand intermittent reward schedules,</p>
<p>harness the biology of dopamine</p>
<p>in ways that can allow you</p>
<p>essentially infinite motivation over time.</p>
<p>Before I go any further,</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes.</p>
<p>For nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>I think we all intuitively understand</p>
<p>what pleasure and pain are.</p>
<p>Pleasure generally is a sensation in the body</p>
<p>and in the mind that leads us to pursue more</p>
<p>of whatever is bringing about that sensation.</p>
<p>And pain is also a sensation in the body and in the mind</p>
<p>that in general leads us to want to withdraw</p>
<p>or move away from some activity or interaction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not always the case.</p>
<p>Some people actively seek out pain.</p>
<p>Some people somehow can&rsquo;t seem to engage with</p>
<p>or experience pleasure,</p>
<p>but most people operate on this basis of pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>Scientists would call this appetitive behaviors,</p>
<p>meaning behaviors that lead us to create an appetite</p>
<p>for more of those behaviors, and aversive behaviors,</p>
<p>behaviors that make us want to move away from something.</p>
<p>The simplest example of that would be putting your hand</p>
<p>near a hot flame.</p>
<p>At some point, there would be a reflex</p>
<p>or a deep desire to withdraw your hand.</p>
<p>Tasting something delicious in general</p>
<p>makes us want to eat more of that thing.</p>
<p>Interactions with other people that we find delicious</p>
<p>also make us want to interact with those people more.</p>
<p>None of this is complicated or sophisticated.</p>
<p>This is simply to illustrate the fact that pleasure</p>
<p>and pain tend to evoke opposite responses,</p>
<p>opposite behavioral responses</p>
<p>and opposite emotional responses.</p>
<p>So how does that come about?</p>
<p>Well, it really comes about by an interaction</p>
<p>that starts at one end of our body, meaning our skin,</p>
<p>and the other end of the organs of our body,</p>
<p>which is deep within the brain.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider these two ends of the spectrum</p>
<p>of pleasure and pain and what they contribute</p>
<p>to those experiences of pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>The organ that we call the skin, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>is the largest organ in our body.</p>
<p>And throughout that organ, we have neurons,</p>
<p>little nerve cells.</p>
<p>Now, to be really technical about it,</p>
<p>and the way I&rsquo;d like you to understand it</p>
<p>is that the so-called cell body,</p>
<p>meaning the location of a cell in which the DNA</p>
<p>and other goodies, the kind of central factory of the cell,</p>
<p>that actually sits right outside your spinal cord.</p>
<p>So all up and down your spinal cord on either side</p>
<p>are these little blobs of neurons,</p>
<p>little collections of neurons.</p>
<p>They have a name, if you&rsquo;d like to know,</p>
<p>for you aficionados or those who are curious,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called DRGs, dorsal root ganglia.</p>
<p>A ganglion is just a collection or a clump of cells.</p>
<p>And those DRGs are really interesting</p>
<p>because they send one branch that we call an axon,</p>
<p>a little wire, out to our skin,</p>
<p>also to our muscles and to our organs,</p>
<p>but here we&rsquo;re talking about the skin.</p>
<p>They send a wire out to our skin,</p>
<p>and that wire literally reaches up into the skin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually in our skin.</p>
<p>And they have another wire from that same cell body</p>
<p>that goes in the opposite direction,</p>
<p>which is up to our brain,</p>
<p>and creates connections within our brain</p>
<p>in the so-called brainstem.</p>
<p>What this means is that the neuron in your body</p>
<p>that we call the DRG that sends a wire, an axon,</p>
<p>to sense what&rsquo;s going on in your big toe,</p>
<p>and then sends another axon in the opposite direction</p>
<p>into the base of your brain,</p>
<p>that is the largest cell in your entire body of any kind,</p>
<p>fat cell, muscle cell, nerve cell, et cetera.</p>
<p>Those are extremely long cells.</p>
<p>They can be a meter or more,</p>
<p>depending on how tall you happen to be.</p>
<p>So we have these cells that have wires</p>
<p>that go off in two different directions,</p>
<p>and the wire that&rsquo;s within our skin</p>
<p>will respond to any number</p>
<p>of different categories of stimuli, okay?</p>
<p>These wires are positioned within the skin</p>
<p>to respond to mechanical forces, so maybe light touch.</p>
<p>Some will only send electrical activity up toward the brain</p>
<p>in response to light touch,</p>
<p>meaning if you press on the skin really hard,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>You stroke the skin lightly</p>
<p>with your fingertip or a feather,</p>
<p>and they respond very robustly.</p>
<p>Others respond to coarse pressure, to hard pressure,</p>
<p>but they won&rsquo;t respond to a light feather.</p>
<p>For instance, others respond to temperature.</p>
<p>So they will respond to the presence of heat</p>
<p>or the presence of cold or changes in heat and cold.</p>
<p>And still others respond to other types of stimuli</p>
<p>like certain chemicals on our skin.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably experienced the sensation</p>
<p>of eating a hot pepper.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t recommend doing this,</p>
<p>but were you to take a little slice of jalapeno</p>
<p>or other hot pepper, habanero pepper or something like that</p>
<p>and rub it on your skin,</p>
<p>you would actually feel something at that location.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because that pepper</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just create a sensation within your mouth,</p>
<p>it will create a similar sensation on your skin.</p>
<p>So these neurons are amazing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re collecting information of particular kinds</p>
<p>from the skin throughout the entire body</p>
<p>and sending that information up toward the brain.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really incredible,</p>
<p>I just want you to ponder this for a second,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really incredible is that the language</p>
<p>that those neurons use is exactly the same.</p>
<p>The neuron that responds to light touch</p>
<p>sends electrical signals up toward the brain.</p>
<p>The neurons that respond to cold or to heat</p>
<p>or to habanero pepper,</p>
<p>they only respond to the particular thing</p>
<p>that evokes the electrical response.</p>
<p>I should say that they only respond</p>
<p>to the particular stimulus,</p>
<p>the pepper, the cold, the heat, et cetera,</p>
<p>that will evoke an electrical signal.</p>
<p>But the electrical signals are a common language</p>
<p>that all neurons use.</p>
<p>And yet, if something cold is presented to your skin,</p>
<p>like an ice cube,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t see that ice cube,</p>
<p>if your eyes are closed</p>
<p>or someone comes up behind you</p>
<p>and puts an ice cube against your bare skin back,</p>
<p>you know that that sensation, that thing is cold.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t misperceive it as heat</p>
<p>or as a habanero pepper, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>What that means is that there must be another element</p>
<p>in the equation of what creates pleasure or pain.</p>
<p>And that element is your brain.</p>
<p>Your brain takes these electrical signals</p>
<p>and interprets them partially based on experience,</p>
<p>but also there are some innate,</p>
<p>meaning some hardwired aspects of pain and pleasure sensing</p>
<p>that require no experience whatsoever.</p>
<p>A child doesn&rsquo;t have to fall down but once</p>
<p>to know on that first fall that hurt.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to touch a flame but once</p>
<p>and the very first time</p>
<p>they will withdraw their hand from the flame.</p>
<p>So no prior experience is required.</p>
<p>Other things, prior experience is required.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>that has a intense, intense aversion to spicy foods,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;ve tasted spicy foods before.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you really like sweet foods,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;ve tasted them before.</p>
<p>So you can start to make predictions based</p>
<p>on prior experience,</p>
<p>but the pain and pleasure system</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need prior experience.</p>
<p>What they need is a brain</p>
<p>that can interpret these electrical signals.</p>
<p>They can take these electrical signals</p>
<p>and somehow create what we call pleasure</p>
<p>and pain out of them.</p>
<p>So what parts of the brain?</p>
<p>Well, mainly it&rsquo;s the so-called somatosensory cortex.</p>
<p>The portion of our neocortex,</p>
<p>which is on the outside of our brain,</p>
<p>the kind of bumpy part, not kind of.</p>
<p>If you have a normally formed brain, it will be bumpy.</p>
<p>If you have a smooth brain, that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Some animals just have a smooth brain.</p>
<p>Humans have a bumpy brain,</p>
<p>which means it has a very large surface area</p>
<p>and those bumps are because you squeezed it like a pizza</p>
<p>and clumped and bunched it all up and put inside the skull.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That means you have a lot of neurons.</p>
<p>And in your somatosensory cortex,</p>
<p>you have a map of your entire body surface.</p>
<p>That map is called a homunculus.</p>
<p>And if we were to take your cortex</p>
<p>and lay it out on a table,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually done this with the courtesies</p>
<p>of various animals and humans included,</p>
<p>what you would find is that there&rsquo;s literally a map</p>
<p>of your entire body surface,</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t look exactly like you.</p>
<p>This map would be very distorted.</p>
<p>Why would it be distorted?</p>
<p>Well, certain areas of your body</p>
<p>have a much denser innervation, as we call it,</p>
<p>or put simply, many more of these sensory wires</p>
<p>from these DRGs within your skin.</p>
<p>So this map of you that exists in your brain,</p>
<p>and you do have one of these on each side of your brain,</p>
<p>so you have two of these maps, two homunculi,</p>
<p>that is you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your representation of touch,</p>
<p>including pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>And in that map, your lips are enormous.</p>
<p>And your back is very, very small.</p>
<p>And the area around your eyes</p>
<p>and the area representing your face is absolutely enormous.</p>
<p>So you would look like some sort of odd, weird clay doll</p>
<p>from some sort of bizarre late night animation thing.</p>
<p>And just imagine the psychedelic experience</p>
<p>of that character of you,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what it would look like.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not randomly organized.</p>
<p>To the contrary, it&rsquo;s highly organized</p>
<p>in a very particular way,</p>
<p>which is that the areas of your skin</p>
<p>that have the highest density of these sensory receptors</p>
<p>are magnified in your brain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like having more pixels</p>
<p>in a certain part of a camera than others.</p>
<p>And in doing that, allowing higher resolution,</p>
<p>in this case of touch, not a vision,</p>
<p>but of touch sensation in certain parts of your body.</p>
<p>What are the areas that are magnified?</p>
<p>Well, the lips, the face, the tips of the fingers,</p>
<p>the feet, and the genitals.</p>
<p>And so this map of you has very large lips, face,</p>
<p>tips of fingers, bottoms of feet, and genitals.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the innervation,</p>
<p>the number of wires that go into those regions</p>
<p>of your body far exceeds the number of wires</p>
<p>for sensation of touch that go to other areas of your body.</p>
<p>You can actually experience this in real time right now</p>
<p>by doing a simple experiment</p>
<p>that we call two-point discrimination.</p>
<p>Two-point discrimination is your ability</p>
<p>to know whether or not two points of pressure</p>
<p>are far apart, near each other,</p>
<p>or you actually could perceive incorrectly</p>
<p>as one point of pressure.</p>
<p>You might want a second person to do this experiment.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you would do it.</p>
<p>You would close your eyes.</p>
<p>That person would take two fine points.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make them too sharp, please.</p>
<p>So it could be two pencils or pens or the backs of pens.</p>
<p>Two pens, I&rsquo;m holding in my hands.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just listening to this, I&rsquo;m just holding two pens.</p>
<p>My favorite pens, these Pilot V5s or V7s, which I love.</p>
<p>If you were to close your eyes</p>
<p>and I were to take these two pens</p>
<p>and put their points close together,</p>
<p>about a centimeter apart,</p>
<p>and present them to the top of your hand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to do that now to myself,</p>
<p>you, even though your eyes were closed,</p>
<p>you would be able to perceive</p>
<p>that that was two points of pressure</p>
<p>presented simultaneously to the top of your hand.</p>
<p>However, if I were to do this to the middle of your back,</p>
<p>you would not experience them as two points of pressure.</p>
<p>You would experience them as one single point of pressure.</p>
<p>In other words, your two-point discrimination is better,</p>
<p>is higher on areas of your body,</p>
<p>which have many, many more sensory receptors.</p>
<p>You are more sensitive at those locations.</p>
<p>Now this makes perfect sense once you experience it</p>
<p>or you hear about it.</p>
<p>However, most of us don&rsquo;t really appreciate how important</p>
<p>and what a profound influence this change</p>
<p>in density of receptors across our body surface has.</p>
<p>And we can go a step further and describe another feature</p>
<p>of the way that you&rsquo;re built</p>
<p>and the way that you experience pleasure and pain,</p>
<p>which is called the dermatome.</p>
<p>The dermatome is literally the way in which</p>
<p>your body surface is carved up into different territories,</p>
<p>much like a map of the United States</p>
<p>is carved up into different territories of states</p>
<p>and counties, et cetera.</p>
<p>The dermatome is the way in which neurons</p>
<p>connect to different parts of your body.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve actually experienced the dermatome before.</p>
<p>The dermatome is when you have a neuron</p>
<p>that connects to a particular area of the body.</p>
<p>And that neuron doesn&rsquo;t just send one little wire out</p>
<p>like one little line and go up into the skin</p>
<p>to detect mechanical or thermal or chemical stimuli.</p>
<p>It actually sends many branches out like a tree.</p>
<p>But remember those branches of the tree</p>
<p>come from one single neuron.</p>
<p>Now, occasionally what will happen</p>
<p>is you will experience something like cold or heat</p>
<p>or pain or tingling on a patch of your body.</p>
<p>And occasionally that patch of body</p>
<p>will actually have a very cleanly demarcated boundary,</p>
<p>a very stark boundary with the areas around it.</p>
<p>A good example of this would be the herpes simplex 1 virus,</p>
<p>which if one has this virus,</p>
<p>and I should mention that somewhere between 80 and 90%</p>
<p>of people have this virus.</p>
<p>This is not a sexually transmitted virus.</p>
<p>This is a virus that&rsquo;s transmitted very easily</p>
<p>between people through various forms of contact,</p>
<p>non-sexual contact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s present in children, it&rsquo;s present in adults,</p>
<p>and most people get it.</p>
<p>Some get symptoms and some don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>some get recurring symptoms, some don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We can talk about that at the end if you like.</p>
<p>But this virus lives on what&rsquo;s called the fifth cranial nerve</p>
<p>also called the trigeminal nerve.</p>
<p>The trigeminal nerve sends branches out to the lips,</p>
<p>to the eyes and to certain portions of the face.</p>
<p>So for those of you listening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just kind of put my right hand across my face</p>
<p>and to sort of simulate the three branches,</p>
<p>the trigeminal aspect of this nerve, so tri-3.</p>
<p>Now, when the herpes virus flares up,</p>
<p>as they say in response to stress or other factors,</p>
<p>the virus inflames that nerve</p>
<p>and people experience tingling and pain on the nerve.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll get a cold sore or a blister on their lip</p>
<p>or near their mouth.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll get a collection of those.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because that dermatome is actually inflamed.</p>
<p>Now, other people will experience</p>
<p>something like shingles, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fairly common viral infection.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;ll notice is they&rsquo;ll get a rash</p>
<p>that has a boundary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they&rsquo;ll get a bunch of bumps,</p>
<p>sometimes blisters, and it&rsquo;ll have a sharp boundary.</p>
<p>That boundary exists because the virus exists on the nerve.</p>
<p>And so it actually is boundaried</p>
<p>with the neighboring area of the body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s receiving input from another nerve.</p>
<p>And that one doesn&rsquo;t have the virus living on it.</p>
<p>So anytime you see a rash or a pattern on the body surface,</p>
<p>on the skin, that has a pretty stark boundary,</p>
<p>chances are that&rsquo;s an event that&rsquo;s impacting the dermatome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced this before, not through herpes simplex,</p>
<p>but through the experience of having a lot of blood</p>
<p>sort of aggregating in a kind of a segment</p>
<p>across the front of my face.</p>
<p>It was really bizarre.</p>
<p>I looked in the mirror and I thought,</p>
<p>what is going on here?</p>
<p>I was having an allergic reaction to something I&rsquo;d eaten.</p>
<p>And that allergic reaction clearly was affecting</p>
<p>one of the nerves and therefore the dermatome.</p>
<p>And what it showed up was,</p>
<p>it was almost like someone had drawn lines on my face</p>
<p>that said, okay, this rash or this reaction rather</p>
<p>can happen here, but not in the region right next to it.</p>
<p>Whenever you see that,</p>
<p>chances are it&rsquo;s a reaction of the nerves of the dermatome.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll start to see these things more and more</p>
<p>when you start to look for them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t always have to have a viral infection</p>
<p>to experience this.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll just experience tingling</p>
<p>or even a pleasant sensation,</p>
<p>and it will be restricted in kind of a strict boundary</p>
<p>on one location of your body surface and not another.</p>
<p>Not corresponding to an organ like, okay, this arm</p>
<p>or just your feet or something like that,</p>
<p>but just a segment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like someone outlined a particular area</p>
<p>of her body surface.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the dermatome.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;ve got sensors in the skin</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a brain that&rsquo;s going to interpret</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with those sensors.</p>
<p>In fact, we can take an example of a sudden rash</p>
<p>or inflammation at one location in the dermatome,</p>
<p>and we can ask what would make it hurt?</p>
<p>What would make it worse?</p>
<p>What would make it go away?</p>
<p>And believe it or not, your subjective interpretation</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening has a profound influence</p>
<p>on your experience of pleasure or pain.</p>
<p>There are several things that can impact these experiences,</p>
<p>but the main categories are expectation.</p>
<p>So sort of whether or not you thought or could expect</p>
<p>that this thing was going to happen, right?</p>
<p>If someone tells you, this is going to hurt,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you an injection right here,</p>
<p>it might hurt for a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very different and your experience of that pain</p>
<p>will be very different than if it happened suddenly</p>
<p>out of the blue.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also anxiety, how anxious or how high or low</p>
<p>your level of arousal, autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to impact your experience of pleasure or pain.</p>
<p>How well you slept and where you are</p>
<p>in the so-called circadian or 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>Our ability to tolerate pain changes dramatically</p>
<p>across the 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine, it&rsquo;s during the daylight</p>
<p>waking hours that we are better able to tolerate.</p>
<p>We are more resilient to pain</p>
<p>and we are better able to experience pleasure.</p>
<p>At night, our threshold for pain is much lower.</p>
<p>In other words, the amount of mechanical or chemical</p>
<p>or thermal, meaning temperature stimuli</p>
<p>that can evoke a pain response</p>
<p>and how we would rate that response is much lower at night.</p>
<p>And in particular, in the hours between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on a kind of standard circadian schedule.</p>
<p>And then the last one is our genes.</p>
<p>Pain threshold and how long a pain response lasts</p>
<p>is in part dictated by our genes.</p>
<p>And later, I&rsquo;m going to discuss this myth</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s really a myth</p>
<p>as to whether or not certain people in particular redheads,</p>
<p>people who have red pigmented hair and fair skin,</p>
<p>whether or not their pain thresholds differ.</p>
<p>And to just give you a little sneak peek into that,</p>
<p>indeed they do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because of a genetic difference</p>
<p>in a particular gene and a particular pattern of receptors</p>
<p>in the skin that are related</p>
<p>to the pigmentation of hair and skin.</p>
<p>So we have expectation, anxiety, how well we&rsquo;ve slept,</p>
<p>where we are in the so-called 24-hour circadian time</p>
<p>and our genes.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about expectation and anxiety</p>
<p>because those two factors can powerfully modulate</p>
<p>our experience of both pleasure and pain</p>
<p>in ways that will allow us to dial up pleasure, if we like,</p>
<p>and to dial down pain, if indeed that&rsquo;s what we want to do.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about expectation and anxiety</p>
<p>because those two things are somewhat tethered.</p>
<p>There are now a number of solid experiments,</p>
<p>both in animal models and in humans,</p>
<p>that point to the fact that if we know</p>
<p>a painful stimulus is coming,</p>
<p>that we can better prepare for it mentally</p>
<p>and therefore buffer or reduce the pain response.</p>
<p>However, the timing in which that anticipation occurs</p>
<p>is vital for this to happen.</p>
<p>And if that timing isn&rsquo;t quite right,</p>
<p>it actually can make the experience of pain far worse.</p>
<p>So here I&rsquo;m summarizing a large amount of literature,</p>
<p>but essentially if subjects are warned</p>
<p>that a painful stimulus is coming,</p>
<p>their subjective experience of that pain is vastly reduced.</p>
<p>However, if they are warned just two seconds</p>
<p>before that pain arrives, it does not help.</p>
<p>It actually makes it worse.</p>
<p>And the reason is they can&rsquo;t do anything mentally</p>
<p>to prepare for it in that brief two-second window.</p>
<p>Similarly, if they are warned about pain that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>two minutes before a painful stimulus is coming,</p>
<p>electric shock or a poke or cold stimulus or heat stimulus,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty extreme, that also makes it worse</p>
<p>because their expectation ramps up the autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>the level of alertness is all funneled</p>
<p>toward that negative experience that&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>So how soon before a painful stimulus should we know about it</p>
<p>if the goal is to reduce our level of pain?</p>
<p>And the answer is somewhere between 20 seconds</p>
<p>and 40 seconds is about right.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m averaging across a number of different studies,</p>
<p>but if you have about 20 seconds or 40 seconds</p>
<p>advanced warning that something bad is coming,</p>
<p>you can prepare yourself for that.</p>
<p>But the preparation itself and the arousal</p>
<p>that comes with it, the kind of leaning in,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m either going to relax myself</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m going to really kind of dig my heels in</p>
<p>and kind of meet the pain head on,</p>
<p>that seems to be the optimal window.</p>
<p>This can come in useful in a variety of contexts,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s important because what it illustrates</p>
<p>is that it absolutely cannot be just the pattern</p>
<p>of signals that are arriving from the skin,</p>
<p>from these DRGs, these neurons that connect to skin</p>
<p>that dictates our experience of pain or pleasure.</p>
<p>There has to be a subjective interpretation component.</p>
<p>And indeed that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the range of pain experiences.</p>
<p>And from that, we will understand better</p>
<p>what the range of pleasure experiences are</p>
<p>that different people have,</p>
<p>because we are all different in terms of our pain threshold.</p>
<p>First of all, what is pain threshold?</p>
<p>Pain threshold has two dimensions.</p>
<p>The first dimension is the amount of mechanical</p>
<p>or chemical or thermal stimulation that it takes</p>
<p>for you or me or somebody else to say,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take that anymore, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another element as well,</p>
<p>which is how long the pain persists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just describe myself, for example,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself somebody</p>
<p>who has a particularly high pain threshold.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s particularly low either,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t consider myself somebody</p>
<p>that has a particularly high pain threshold.</p>
<p>When I stub my toe against the corner of the bed,</p>
<p>it absolutely hurts.</p>
<p>But one thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed</p>
<p>is that I have a very sharp inflections,</p>
<p>very high inflections in my perception of pain,</p>
<p>and then they go away quickly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s adaptive or not, it&rsquo;s probably not.</p>
<p>But my experience of pain is very intense, but very brief.</p>
<p>Other people experience pain in a much kind of slower rising</p>
<p>but longer lasting manner.</p>
<p>And to just really point out how varied we all are</p>
<p>in terms of our experience of pain,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s look to an experiment.</p>
<p>There have been experiments done</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine and elsewhere,</p>
<p>which involved having subjects put their hand</p>
<p>into a very cold vat of water</p>
<p>and measuring the amount of time</p>
<p>that they kept their hand in that water.</p>
<p>And then they would tell the experimenter very quietly</p>
<p>how painful that particular stimulus was</p>
<p>on a scale of one to 10,</p>
<p>so-called Likert scale for you aficionados.</p>
<p>That simple experiment revealed</p>
<p>that people experienced the same thermal,</p>
<p>in this case cold, stimulus vastly different.</p>
<p>Some people would rate it as a 10 out of 10, extreme pain.</p>
<p>Other people would rate it as barely painful at all,</p>
<p>like a one, other people, a three,</p>
<p>other people, a five, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting is that the same thing is true</p>
<p>for experience of a hot painful stimulus,</p>
<p>120 degree hot plate where you have to put your hand on it.</p>
<p>And then at some point you remove your hand.</p>
<p>Some people are able to keep their hand</p>
<p>on there the whole time,</p>
<p>but people rate that experience as very painful,</p>
<p>a little bit painful or moderately painful</p>
<p>depending on who they are.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>probably not that surprising, however.</p>
<p>But what is very interesting is that</p>
<p>when the same experiment was done on medical doctors</p>
<p>or medical doctors in training,</p>
<p>they too of course experienced pain</p>
<p>through a range of subjective experiences.</p>
<p>Some of them, just like any other person off the street,</p>
<p>said a particular stimulus of a particular temperature</p>
<p>was very painful.</p>
<p>Others said it wasn&rsquo;t painful at all.</p>
<p>And some said it was moderately painful.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be vitally important</p>
<p>for the treatment of pain</p>
<p>because pain is not an event in the skin.</p>
<p>Pain is a subjective emotional experience.</p>
<p>You may have heard that we have a particular category</p>
<p>of these DRGs that innervate the skin,</p>
<p>which are called nociceptors.</p>
<p>Nociceptor comes from the word nocera, I believe it is,</p>
<p>which means to harm.</p>
<p>However, nociceptors don&rsquo;t carry information about pain.</p>
<p>They carry information about particular types of stimuli</p>
<p>impacting the skin.</p>
<p>And then the brain assigns a value, a valence to it,</p>
<p>a label, and says that&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>And where people draw the line</p>
<p>between not painful and painful varies.</p>
<p>Now, because physicians are people</p>
<p>and because physicians treat pain,</p>
<p>what we know from a lot of data now</p>
<p>is that if someone comes into the clinic</p>
<p>and says they&rsquo;re experiencing chronic pain</p>
<p>or whole body pain or acute pain after an injury</p>
<p>or one location, doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the cause is</p>
<p>or even if there&rsquo;s a cause at all,</p>
<p>how the doctor reacts to that report of the patient&rsquo;s pain</p>
<p>will dictate in many cases, the course of treatment.</p>
<p>And of course, doctors, their goal is to treat the patient</p>
<p>according to the patient&rsquo;s needs, not their own.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what good doctors do.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s been found,</p>
<p>and I think now there is work being done</p>
<p>to try and change this.</p>
<p>But if a doctor has a very high threshold for pain,</p>
<p>their interpretation of somebody else&rsquo;s report of pain</p>
<p>is going to be different.</p>
<p>They might not discount the patient, right?</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they think,</p>
<p>oh, this person, their pain is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>In fact, from having a high threshold for pain,</p>
<p>if someone comes in and says, I&rsquo;m in extreme pain,</p>
<p>that doctor probably thinks, wow,</p>
<p>this has to be really, really extreme.</p>
<p>But they can be talking about two different experiences.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a physician has a very low threshold for pain</p>
<p>and someone comes in and says,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m, yeah, I&rsquo;m experiencing some pain in my back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the sciatica thing,</p>
<p>but it, you know, it&rsquo;s, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a, I don&rsquo;t know, like a four out of 10.</p>
<p>Well, that physician might interpret that four out of 10</p>
<p>as a pretty extreme sense of pain</p>
<p>or a pretty extreme experience of pain.</p>
<p>And so you can start to see how the subjective nature</p>
<p>of pain can start to have real impact</p>
<p>on the treatment of pain</p>
<p>because treatment of pain is carried out by physicians.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no objective measure of pain.</p>
<p>We can ask how long somebody can keep their hand</p>
<p>on a hot plate or in a cold bath.</p>
<p>You can do various experiments.</p>
<p>They even have some extreme experiments</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;ll shave a portion of the leg</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll put on a very painful chemical compound</p>
<p>and see how long people can tolerate that.</p>
<p>These are very uncomfortable experiments,</p>
<p>as you can imagine.</p>
<p>But in general, we don&rsquo;t have a way</p>
<p>of measuring somebody else&rsquo;s subjective experience of pain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no blood pressure measure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no heart rate beats per minute measure of pain.</p>
<p>So one of the great efforts of neuroscience</p>
<p>and of medicine is to try and come up</p>
<p>with more objective measures of pain.</p>
<p>Similarly, pleasure is something that we all talk about.</p>
<p>Ooh, that feels so good, or I love that,</p>
<p>or more of that, please, or less of that.</p>
<p>But we have no way of gauging</p>
<p>what other people are experiencing</p>
<p>except what they report through language.</p>
<p>And so this is really just to illustrate</p>
<p>that this whole thing around pain isn&rsquo;t a black box.</p>
<p>We do have an understanding of the elements.</p>
<p>There are elements in the skin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s elements of the brain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s expectation, anxiety, sleep, and genes,</p>
<p>but that it is very complicated.</p>
<p>And yet there are certain principles</p>
<p>that fall out of that complicated picture</p>
<p>that can allow us to better understand</p>
<p>and navigate this axis that we call the pleasure-pain axis.</p>
<p>So rather than focus on just the subjective nature of pain,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about the absolute qualities of pain</p>
<p>and the absolute qualities of pleasure</p>
<p>so that we can learn how to navigate those two experiences</p>
<p>in ways that serve us each better.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to talk about heat and cold.</p>
<p>We do indeed have sensors in our skin</p>
<p>that respond to heat and cold.</p>
<p>And for any of you that have entered a cold shower</p>
<p>or a cold body of water of any kind, or ice bath, et cetera,</p>
<p>you will realize that getting into cold is much harder</p>
<p>if you do it slowly.</p>
<p>Now, despite that, people tend to do it very slowly.</p>
<p>I have noticed an enormous variation</p>
<p>with which people can embrace the experience of cold.</p>
<p>I noticed it because I do some work with athletes</p>
<p>and I do some work with military</p>
<p>and I do some work with the general public.</p>
<p>And one of the best tests of how somebody can handle pain</p>
<p>is to ask them to just get into an ice bath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very sophisticated experience,</p>
<p>but it really gets into the core of the kind of circuitry</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about both in the skin and in the brain.</p>
<p>Some people, regardless of sex, regardless of age,</p>
<p>and regardless of physical ability,</p>
<p>can just get into the cold.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re somehow able to do it.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know what their experience of the cold is,</p>
<p>and neither do you, you only know your experience,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re able to do that.</p>
<p>Some do it quickly, some do it slowly.</p>
<p>Others find the experience of cold to be so aversive</p>
<p>that they somehow cannot get themselves in.</p>
<p>They start quaking, they start complaining,</p>
<p>and many of them just simply get out.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Some don&rsquo;t even get in past their knees.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t necessarily about pain threshold,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s related to that.</p>
<p>I think it can be helpful to everyone to know</p>
<p>that even though it feels better at a mental level</p>
<p>to get into the cold slowly, and people ask,</p>
<p>oh, I just want to get in slowly, I want to take my time.</p>
<p>It is actually much worse</p>
<p>from a neurobiological perspective.</p>
<p>The neurons that sense cold respond</p>
<p>to what are called relative drops in temperature.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about the absolute temperature of the water,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the relative change in temperature.</p>
<p>So as you move from a particular temperature,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s in the air next to an ice bath</p>
<p>or cold shower, or from a body of water that&rsquo;s warm</p>
<p>to a body of water that&rsquo;s colder,</p>
<p>or sometimes in the ocean, you&rsquo;ll notice it&rsquo;s warm,</p>
<p>and then as you swim out further,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get into a pocket of water where it&rsquo;s much colder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the cold receptors in your skin</p>
<p>start firing and sending signals up to your brain.</p>
<p>Therefore, you can bypass these signals</p>
<p>going up to the brain with each relative change,</p>
<p>one degree change, two degrees change, et cetera,</p>
<p>by simply getting in all at once.</p>
<p>In fact, it is true,</p>
<p>and maybe you&rsquo;ve been told this before,</p>
<p>and it is true that if you get into cold water</p>
<p>up to your neck, it&rsquo;s actually much more comfortable</p>
<p>than if you&rsquo;re halfway in and halfway out,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because of the difference in the signals</p>
<p>that are being sent from the cold receptors</p>
<p>on your upper torso, which is out of the water</p>
<p>in your lower torso.</p>
<p>Now, I wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone to take this to mean</p>
<p>that they should just jump into an unknown body of water.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of factors like currents,</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s very, very cold, yes, indeed,</p>
<p>you can stop the heart.</p>
<p>People can have heart attacks</p>
<p>from getting into extremely cold water,</p>
<p>like a melted mountain stream</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been frozen all winter,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s been very, very cold,</p>
<p>or has a snowpack going into it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s very cold, you can indeed have a heart attack,</p>
<p>so please be smart about how cold</p>
<p>and what bodies of cold water</p>
<p>you happen to put yourself into,</p>
<p>but it is absolutely true that provided it&rsquo;s safe,</p>
<p>getting into a cold water</p>
<p>is always going to be easier to do quickly,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be easier to do up to your neck.</p>
<p>In fact, you actually want to get your shoulders submerged.</p>
<p>There are a number of other things you can do.</p>
<p>If you really want and it&rsquo;s safe to do,</p>
<p>you can put your face under</p>
<p>and activate the so-called dive reflex,</p>
<p>which also makes the tolerance of cold easier,</p>
<p>believe it or not.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very counterintuitive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like getting into cold water faster</p>
<p>and more completely,</p>
<p>you will experience as less uncomfortable, less cold,</p>
<p>and indeed, that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because these cold receptors</p>
<p>are measuring every relative drop in temperature,</p>
<p>so every single one is graded, as we say in biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not absolute.</p>
<p>As an additional point,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re sitting in a body of cold water</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not circulating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that you start to warm up a little bit,</p>
<p>or even if you feel like you&rsquo;re freezing cold,</p>
<p>if you move and that water around you moves, of course,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll notice it&rsquo;s got even colder,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a thermal layer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually heating up the water</p>
<p>that surrounds your body</p>
<p>like a halo around every aspect of your body,</p>
<p>a sort of silhouette of you, of heat,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re heating that water.</p>
<p>When you move, you disrupt that thermal layer.</p>
<p>Now, heat is the opposite.</p>
<p>Heat and the heat receptors in your skin</p>
<p>respond to absolute changes in temperature,</p>
<p>and this is probably because our body and our brain</p>
<p>can tolerate drops in temperature</p>
<p>much better than it can tolerate</p>
<p>increases in temperature safely,</p>
<p>so when you move from, say, a standard outdoor environment,</p>
<p>I mean, here in the States,</p>
<p>we measure in terms of Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>so maybe it&rsquo;s a 75 or an 80-degree or even 90-degree day,</p>
<p>and you get into a 100-degree sauna,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re in a cool air-conditioned building</p>
<p>and you go outside and it&rsquo;s very warm outside,</p>
<p>you sort of feel like the heat hits you all at once, boom,</p>
<p>hits you all at once, kind of like a slap in the face,</p>
<p>but then it will just stay at that level.</p>
<p>Your body will acclimate to that particular temperature.</p>
<p>However, if that temperature is very, very high,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that your experience of that heat</p>
<p>and your experience of kind of pain and discomfort</p>
<p>and your desire to get out of that heat will tend to persist.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really adapt in the same way,</p>
<p>and certain people who are really good</p>
<p>at handling very hot sauna get better at this.</p>
<p>You learn to calm your breathing, et cetera,</p>
<p>lower your autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don&rsquo;t want to let your body temperature</p>
<p>go too high because if neurons cook, they die.</p>
<p>If neurons die, they don&rsquo;t come back, and that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Many people, unfortunately,</p>
<p>harm themselves with hyperthermia.</p>
<p>Everyone has a different threshold for this,</p>
<p>but in general, you don&rsquo;t want your body temperature</p>
<p>to go up too high.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a fever of like 103</p>
<p>starts to become worrisome, 104.</p>
<p>You really get concerned if, and it goes, you know,</p>
<p>up into that range or higher,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you need to really cool down the body</p>
<p>or get to the hospital so they can cool you down.</p>
<p>Heat is measured in absolute terms by the neurons.</p>
<p>So gradually moving into heat makes sense,</p>
<p>and finding that threshold,</p>
<p>which is safe and comfortable for you,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s uncomfortable,</p>
<p>at least resides within that realm of safety.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s heat and cold,</p>
<p>and those are sort of non-negotiables.</p>
<p>You can try and lower your level of arousal.</p>
<p>In fact, many people who get into a cold shower</p>
<p>or an ice bath, I think the recommendation</p>
<p>that I always give is that you have</p>
<p>two possible approaches to that.</p>
<p>You can either try and relax yourself,</p>
<p>kind of just stay calm within the cold,</p>
<p>or you can lean into it.</p>
<p>You can actually take mental steps</p>
<p>to generate more adrenaline,</p>
<p>to kind of meet the demands of that cold.</p>
<p>And at some point, we&rsquo;ll do a whole episode</p>
<p>on how to use cold and heat to certain advantages.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done a little bit of this in past episodes,</p>
<p>using the cold to supercharge human performance</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But in general, cold is measured in relative terms,</p>
<p>and therefore getting in all at once is a good idea,</p>
<p>provided you can do it safely,</p>
<p>and heat is measured in absolute levels</p>
<p>by your brain and body,</p>
<p>and therefore you want to actually move into it gradually.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of the inverse of what you might think.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to understand</p>
<p>about the experience of pain,</p>
<p>and to really illustrate just how subjective pain really is,</p>
<p>is that our experience of pain</p>
<p>and the degree of damage to our body</p>
<p>are not always correlated,</p>
<p>and in fact, sometimes can be in opposite directions.</p>
<p>A good example of this would be x-rays.</p>
<p>We all occasionally get x-rays,</p>
<p>at least in the US we get x-rays</p>
<p>when we go to the dentist from time to time,</p>
<p>and the occasional x-ray might be safe,</p>
<p>depending on who you are,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re not pregnant, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone to the dentist, they put you in the chair,</p>
<p>they cover you with a lead blanket,</p>
<p>and then they run behind the screen to protect themselves,</p>
<p>and they beam you with the x-rays</p>
<p>to get a picture of your teeth and your jaws</p>
<p>and your skull, et cetera.</p>
<p>Well, if you were to get too many x-rays,</p>
<p>you could severely damage the tissues of your body,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t experience any pain during the x-ray itself.</p>
<p>In contrast, you can think that your body is damaged</p>
<p>and experience extreme pain,</p>
<p>and yet your body can have no damage.</p>
<p>A classic example of this was published</p>
<p>in the British Journal of Medicine,</p>
<p>in which a construction worker fell from,</p>
<p>I think it was a second story, which he was working,</p>
<p>and a nail went up and through his boot,</p>
<p>and he looked down and he saw the nail</p>
<p>going through his boot,</p>
<p>and he was in absolute excruciating pain.</p>
<p>They took him to the hospital,</p>
<p>and because the nail was so long</p>
<p>and because of where it had entered and exited the boot,</p>
<p>they had to cut away the boot in order to get to the nail,</p>
<p>and when they did that,</p>
<p>they revealed that the nail had passed</p>
<p>between two of his toes.</p>
<p>It had actually failed to impale his body in any way,</p>
<p>and yet the view, the perception of that nail</p>
<p>entering his boot at one end</p>
<p>and exiting the boot at the other</p>
<p>was sufficient to create the experience</p>
<p>of a nail that had gone through his foot,</p>
<p>and the moment he realized</p>
<p>that that nail had not gone through his foot,</p>
<p>the pain completely evaporated,</p>
<p>and this has been demonstrated numerous times.</p>
<p>People that work in emergency rooms</p>
<p>actually see variations on this, not always that extreme,</p>
<p>but many times what we see</p>
<p>and how we perceive that wound or that event</p>
<p>has a profound influence on how we experience pain,</p>
<p>and I mention this not just because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a kind of sensational and fantastic example</p>
<p>of this extreme subjective nature of pain,</p>
<p>but also because it brings us back to this element,</p>
<p>which is we don&rsquo;t know how other people feel,</p>
<p>not just about pain, but about pleasure.</p>
<p>We think we do.</p>
<p>We have some general sense of whether or not</p>
<p>an event ought to be painful or pleasurable,</p>
<p>but actually, we barely understand how we feel,</p>
<p>let alone how other people feel,</p>
<p>and we can be badly wrong about how we feel,</p>
<p>meaning we can misinterpret our own sense of pain</p>
<p>or our own sense of pleasure</p>
<p>depending on what we see with our eyes</p>
<p>and what we hear with our ears.</p>
<p>So we hear a scream, like a shrill scream,</p>
<p>and we think it must be pain,</p>
<p>and if we look at something that&rsquo;s happening to somebody</p>
<p>and it fits a prior category or a prior representation</p>
<p>of what we would consider painful stimulus,</p>
<p>well, then we think that they&rsquo;re in extreme pain,</p>
<p>but actually they might not be in pain at all.</p>
<p>Now, this highly subjective nature of pain</p>
<p>and the way in which we use our visual system</p>
<p>to interpret other people&rsquo;s pain and our own pain</p>
<p>has actually been leveraged</p>
<p>to treat a very extreme form of chronic pain,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an absolutely fascinating area</p>
<p>of biology and neuroscience,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one that we can actually all leverage</p>
<p>toward reducing our own levels of pain</p>
<p>whenever we are injured,</p>
<p>or believe it or not, even in chronic pain.</p>
<p>To describe this area of science</p>
<p>requires a kind of extreme example,</p>
<p>but I want to be clear that even if you don&rsquo;t suffer</p>
<p>from this extreme example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s relevance and a tool to extract for you.</p>
<p>The extreme example is that of an amputated digit,</p>
<p>meaning one of your fingers or your toes,</p>
<p>or of an amputated limb.</p>
<p>So people that have digits or limbs</p>
<p>that are gone, missing from an injury or surgical removal,</p>
<p>will often have the experience that it&rsquo;s still there,</p>
<p>the so-called phantom limb phenomenon.</p>
<p>Now, why would that be?</p>
<p>Well, when you remove a particular finger or limb,</p>
<p>obviously that finger and limb is gone,</p>
<p>and the dorsal root ganglion neuron</p>
<p>that would normally send a wire</p>
<p>out to that particular region of the body,</p>
<p>that wire is no longer there</p>
<p>because that portion of the body is no longer there.</p>
<p>And in some cases, those neurons die,</p>
<p>almost always, but not always.</p>
<p>However, the map, your so-called homunculus,</p>
<p>your representation of yourself in the brain,</p>
<p>is still there.</p>
<p>And this map, the so-called homunculus map</p>
<p>that you have and that I have, is very plastic.</p>
<p>It can change.</p>
<p>And so as a consequence,</p>
<p>areas of the map that are adjacent to one another</p>
<p>can actually start to invade other areas of the map.</p>
<p>So for instance, there are neuroimaging studies</p>
<p>that have documented that somebody that has, say,</p>
<p>a complete removal of their left arm,</p>
<p>the representation of their left arm</p>
<p>still exists in the cortex.</p>
<p>And experimentally,</p>
<p>if one is to stimulate that area of the cortex,</p>
<p>that person, and if that person were you,</p>
<p>would experience having that arm,</p>
<p>that it were being stimulated, even though it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Now, someone who has an amputated arm</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need to have their brain stimulated</p>
<p>in order to have the experience</p>
<p>of that phantom limb being present.</p>
<p>In fact, many people who have limbs that were amputated</p>
<p>feel as if that limb is still present,</p>
<p>even though obviously it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And no matter how many times they look to the stump</p>
<p>and just see a stump,</p>
<p>somehow it doesn&rsquo;t reorganize that homunculus,</p>
<p>so-called central brain map.</p>
<p>Now, that would be fine.</p>
<p>You might even think that would be better,</p>
<p>better to think you have the arm there</p>
<p>than to feel as if it&rsquo;s missing.</p>
<p>And yet many people who have amputated limbs</p>
<p>report phantom limb pain.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t feel that the arm</p>
<p>is just casually draped next to them.</p>
<p>They feel as if it&rsquo;s bunched up and it&rsquo;s an extreme pain.</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of contorted stance</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m taking right here in my chair</p>
<p>is not unlike the way that these patients describe this.</p>
<p>They feel as if it&rsquo;s kind of cramped up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very uncomfortable for them.</p>
<p>Now, an absolutely creative,</p>
<p>and you could even say genius scientist</p>
<p>by the name of Ramachandran,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually his last name.</p>
<p>His complete name is a little bit more complicated.</p>
<p>So you almost always hear Ramachandran</p>
<p>referred to as Ramachandran or V.S. Ramachandran</p>
<p>because his full name</p>
<p>is Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran.</p>
<p>So a lot of letters in there, a lot of vowels.</p>
<p>But Ramachandran is a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>He was actually a colleague of mine</p>
<p>when my lab was formerly</p>
<p>at the University of California, San Diego.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done a lot of work on this phantom limb phenomenon.</p>
<p>And Ramachandran actually started off as a vision scientist</p>
<p>and he understood the power of the visual system</p>
<p>in dictating our experience of things like pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>And so what he developed was a very low technology</p>
<p>yet neuroscientifically sophisticated treatment</p>
<p>for phantom limb.</p>
<p>It consisted of a box, literally a box,</p>
<p>that had mirrors inside of it.</p>
<p>And the patient would put the intact hand or limb</p>
<p>into one side.</p>
<p>And obviously they couldn&rsquo;t put the amputated limb</p>
<p>into the other side,</p>
<p>but because of the configuration of the mirrors,</p>
<p>it appeared as though they had two symmetric limbs</p>
<p>inside the box.</p>
<p>And then he would have them look at that limb</p>
<p>and move it around.</p>
<p>And as they would do this,</p>
<p>they would report real-time movement,</p>
<p>or I should say real-time perception of movement</p>
<p>in the phantom limb.</p>
<p>Now, this is absolutely incredible,</p>
<p>but it makes total sense</p>
<p>when you think about the so-called top-down</p>
<p>or contextual modulation of our sensory experience.</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s anticipation, it&rsquo;s anxiety,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interpretation of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>that drives our perception of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And so as he would have these patients</p>
<p>move their intact limb to a more relaxed position,</p>
<p>the patients would feel as if the phantom limb</p>
<p>were relaxing.</p>
<p>And this was used successfully to treat phantom limb pain</p>
<p>in a number of different people.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t always work.</p>
<p>And you can imagine sometimes it might be a little trickier</p>
<p>like for a leg,</p>
<p>although there have been leg boxes</p>
<p>that have been developed and arranged for this purpose.</p>
<p>And what was remarkable</p>
<p>is that they could finish these experiments</p>
<p>and have the patient, the person,</p>
<p>enter a state of relaxation,</p>
<p>reduce the pain in the phantom limb,</p>
<p>and it would stay there,</p>
<p>even though, of course, as they exited the mirror box,</p>
<p>they would go about their life</p>
<p>and use their intact limb for its various purposes.</p>
<p>I love this experiment</p>
<p>because it really speaks to the subjective nature</p>
<p>of pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>It speaks to the power of the visual system.</p>
<p>Like what we see,</p>
<p>just like the nail through the boot experiment,</p>
<p>what we see profoundly impacts our experience</p>
<p>of pleasure and pain, in this case, pain.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s another aspect to the phantom limb experience</p>
<p>and of these maps,</p>
<p>the so-called homunculus maps in the cortex</p>
<p>that Ramachandran worked on,</p>
<p>which is very interesting</p>
<p>and reveals the degree to which these maps are plastic</p>
<p>or can change in response to experience.</p>
<p>Turns out that because of the locations</p>
<p>of different body part representations within these maps,</p>
<p>certain parts of our body</p>
<p>that normally we don&rsquo;t think of as related</p>
<p>can start to create merged experiences.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, Ramachandran described a patient</p>
<p>who had a somewhat odd experience of having lost their foot.</p>
<p>So they actually had their foot amputated</p>
<p>about midway up the Achilles,</p>
<p>so lower portion of the calf and foot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall what the reason was for having it removed.</p>
<p>And fortunately for this patient,</p>
<p>they did not experience pain in that portion of their body,</p>
<p>but rather they confided in him</p>
<p>that whenever they would have sex,</p>
<p>they would experience their orgasm in their phantom foot,</p>
<p>in addition to in their genitals, of course.</p>
<p>And Ramachandran understood the homunculus map</p>
<p>and he understood that this was because the representation</p>
<p>of the foot within the homunculus actually lies adjacent to</p>
<p>and is somewhat interdigitated with,</p>
<p>it actually kind of merges with</p>
<p>the representation of the genitalia.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a weird situation,</p>
<p>and yet you now know that the density of innervation</p>
<p>of the feet and the genitalia,</p>
<p>as well as the lips and the face,</p>
<p>are actually the highest sensory innervation</p>
<p>that you have in your entire body.</p>
<p>And this speaks to, I think,</p>
<p>a more important general principle for all people</p>
<p>of the experience of pleasure or pain,</p>
<p>which is that an aspect of our pain or pleasure</p>
<p>can be highly localized, right?</p>
<p>It can be because of a cut</p>
<p>to a particular location on the body,</p>
<p>or it can be because, excuse me,</p>
<p>of a fall injury or a kind of bruise</p>
<p>on one side of our body.</p>
<p>And yet our experience of pleasure and pain</p>
<p>can also be an almost body-wide experience.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s always most rich,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always most heightened in these regions of our body</p>
<p>that have dense sensory innervation.</p>
<p>So we experience pain and pleasure</p>
<p>according to local phenomenon,</p>
<p>receptors in the skin and this homunculus map</p>
<p>that has all these different territories.</p>
<p>But because of the way that those territories are related,</p>
<p>this kind of wild example of somebody experiencing orgasm</p>
<p>in their phantom foot speaks to the larger experience,</p>
<p>the more typical, rather, experience that I should say,</p>
<p>that all people have,</p>
<p>which is that pleasure can be body-wide,</p>
<p>or we can experience it in our face,</p>
<p>the bottoms of our feet,</p>
<p>and other areas of the body that we experience pleasure,</p>
<p>and similarly with pain.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the topic of whole body pain,</p>
<p>not just localized pain,</p>
<p>as well as whole body pleasure,</p>
<p>not just localized pleasure.</p>
<p>There are a number of examples of whole body pain</p>
<p>that people suffer from.</p>
<p>And one common one is called fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>I want to just first share with you</p>
<p>a little bit of medical insight.</p>
<p>A few months back, I did an Instagram Live</p>
<p>with Dr. Sean Mackey, who&rsquo;s an MD, medical doctor,</p>
<p>and a PhD at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>That was recorded and placed on my Instagram,</p>
<p>if you want to check it out.</p>
<p>We can provide a link to that in the show notes.</p>
<p>Dr. Mackey is the chief of the Division of Pain</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a scientist, he studies pain,</p>
<p>and he treats patients dealing with various forms of pain,</p>
<p>whole body pain like fibromyalgia, acute pain, et cetera.</p>
<p>And he shared with me something very interesting,</p>
<p>which is that anytime you hear or see the word syndrome,</p>
<p>that means that the medical establishment</p>
<p>does not understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>A syndrome is a constellation of symptoms</p>
<p>that point in a particular direction</p>
<p>or some general set of directions</p>
<p>about what could be going on,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t reveal a true underlying disease necessarily.</p>
<p>It could be a aggregate of diseases</p>
<p>or it could be something else entirely.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that I emphasize</p>
<p>the so-called psychosomatic phenomenon.</p>
<p>I think sometimes we hear psychosomatic</p>
<p>and we interpret that as meaning all in one&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s important to remember</p>
<p>that everything is neural,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s pain in your body</p>
<p>because you have a gaping wound</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re hemorrhaging out of that wound</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s pain for which you cannot explain it</p>
<p>on the basis of any kind of injury, it&rsquo;s all neural.</p>
<p>So saying body, brain or psychosomatic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of irrelevant</p>
<p>and I hope someday we move past that language.</p>
<p>Psychosomatic is interesting.</p>
<p>There was a paper that was published in 2015</p>
<p>and then again in 2020, a different paper</p>
<p>focused on the so-called psychogenic fevers</p>
<p>or psychosomatic effects.</p>
<p>And I just briefly want to mention this</p>
<p>because it relates back to pain.</p>
<p>These studies have shown that there are areas</p>
<p>of the so-called thalamus,</p>
<p>which integrates and filter sensory information</p>
<p>of different kinds and within the brainstem,</p>
<p>an area called the DMH,</p>
<p>and I can also provide a link to this study if you like,</p>
<p>that shows that there is a true neurological basis.</p>
<p>There are brain areas and circuits</p>
<p>that are related to what&rsquo;s called psychogenic fever.</p>
<p>When we are stressed and in particular,</p>
<p>if we think that we were injured</p>
<p>or that we were infected by something,</p>
<p>we can actually generate a true fever.</p>
<p>It is not an imagined fever,</p>
<p>it is our thinking generating an increase</p>
<p>in body temperature.</p>
<p>And so this has been called psychosomatic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been called psychogenic, but it has a neural basis.</p>
<p>So when we hear syndrome</p>
<p>and a patient comes into a clinic</p>
<p>and says that they suffer, for instance,</p>
<p>from something which is very controversial, frankly,</p>
<p>like chronic fatigue syndrome,</p>
<p>some physicians believe</p>
<p>that it reflects a real underlying medical condition,</p>
<p>others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>However, syndrome means we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t mean something doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Fibromyalgia or whole body pain for a long time</p>
<p>was written off or kind of explained away</p>
<p>by physicians and scientists, frankly,</p>
<p>my community, as one of these syndromes.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be explained.</p>
<p>However, now there is what I would consider</p>
<p>and I think others would and should consider</p>
<p>firm understanding of at least one of the bases</p>
<p>for this whole body pain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s activation of a particular cell type called glia</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a receptor on these glia,</p>
<p>for those of you that want to know,</p>
<p>called the TOL4 receptor.</p>
<p>And activation of the TOL4 receptor</p>
<p>is related to certain forms of whole body pain</p>
<p>and fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>Now, what treatments exist for fibromyalgia?</p>
<p>And even if you don&rsquo;t suffer from fibromyalgia</p>
<p>and even if you don&rsquo;t know anyone who does,</p>
<p>this is important information</p>
<p>because what I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>relates to how you and your body,</p>
<p>which is you, of course,</p>
<p>can deal with pain of any kind.</p>
<p>And there are actually things that one can do and take</p>
<p>that can encourage nerve health in general,</p>
<p>in other conditions like diabetic neuropathy,</p>
<p>but in all individuals.</p>
<p>So there are clinical data using a prescription drug.</p>
<p>This is work that actually was done</p>
<p>by Dr. Mackey and colleagues.</p>
<p>The drug is called naltrexone.</p>
<p>Naltrexone is actually used for the treatment</p>
<p>of various opioid addictions and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But it turns out that a very low dose,</p>
<p>I believe it was a 110th the size of the typical dose</p>
<p>of naltrexone has been shown to have some success</p>
<p>in dealing with and treating certain forms of fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>And it has that success because of its ability</p>
<p>to bind to and block these TOL4 receptors on glia.</p>
<p>Okay, so this so-called syndrome</p>
<p>or this thing that previously was called a syndrome,</p>
<p>fibromyalgia, actually has a biological basis.</p>
<p>It was not just in patients&rsquo; heads.</p>
<p>And I really tip my hat to the medical establishment,</p>
<p>including Dr. Mackey and others,</p>
<p>who explored the potential underlying biologies</p>
<p>of things like fibromyalgia,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re starting to arrive at treatments.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not a physician, I&rsquo;m a professor,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not prescribing anything.</p>
<p>You should talk to your doctor, of course,</p>
<p>if you have fibromyalgia or other forms of chronic</p>
<p>or whole body pain to explore whether or not</p>
<p>these low dose naltrexone treatments are right for you.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful case study, if you will,</p>
<p>not a case study of an individual patient,</p>
<p>but a case in study of linking up</p>
<p>the patient&rsquo;s self-report of these experiences</p>
<p>and using science to try to establish clinical treatments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another treatment,</p>
<p>or I should say there&rsquo;s another approach</p>
<p>that one could take.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not recommending people do this necessarily.</p>
<p>You have to determine what&rsquo;s right and safe for you.</p>
<p>I cannot do that, there&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>Your situation&rsquo;s very far too much,</p>
<p>and it would be outside of my wheelhouse</p>
<p>to prescribe anything.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a particular compound,</p>
<p>which in the United States is sold over the counter,</p>
<p>and in Europe is prescription.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast before</p>
<p>for other purposes.</p>
<p>And that compound is acetyl L-carnitine.</p>
<p>Acetyl L-carnitine, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>is by prescription in most countries in Europe.</p>
<p>In the US, you can buy this over the counter.</p>
<p>There is evidence that acetyl L-carnitine</p>
<p>can reduce the symptoms of chronic whole body pain</p>
<p>and other certain forms of acute pain</p>
<p>at dosages of somewhere between one to three</p>
<p>and sometimes four grams per day.</p>
<p>Now, acetyl L-carnitine can be taken orally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s found in 500 milligram capsules,</p>
<p>as well as by injection.</p>
<p>By injection in the States, in the United States that is,</p>
<p>also requires a prescription,</p>
<p>or requires a prescription, I should say.</p>
<p>The over the counter forms are generally capsules</p>
<p>or powders.</p>
<p>Those apparently do not require a prescription.</p>
<p>There are several studies exploring acetyl L-carnitine</p>
<p>in this context, as well as for diabetic neuropathy.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting about acetyl L-carnitine</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s one of the few compounds</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t just used for the treatment of pain,</p>
<p>but has also been shown in certain contexts</p>
<p>to improve peripheral nerve health generally.</p>
<p>And for that reason, it&rsquo;s an interesting compound.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also talked about acetyl L-carnitine</p>
<p>on here previously,</p>
<p>because it has robust effects</p>
<p>on things like sperm motility and health,</p>
<p>including the speeds at which sperm swim,</p>
<p>how straight they swim.</p>
<p>Turns out that swimming for sperm is more efficient</p>
<p>if they swim straight,</p>
<p>as opposed to like those kids on the swim team</p>
<p>that are like banging up against the lane lines</p>
<p>and zigzagging all over the place.</p>
<p>So it does turn out to be the case</p>
<p>that the quickest route between any two places</p>
<p>is a straight line.</p>
<p>And the good sperm know that,</p>
<p>and the less good sperm don&rsquo;t seem to know that.</p>
<p>And acetyl L-carnitine seems to facilitate</p>
<p>straight swimming trajectories,</p>
<p>as well as speed of swimming and overall sperm health.</p>
<p>And there is evidence from quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>showing that acetyl L-carnitine supplementation</p>
<p>can also be beneficial for women&rsquo;s fertility</p>
<p>in ways that it affects perhaps,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t really know the mechanism,</p>
<p>health and status of the egg or egg implantation.</p>
<p>There are a large number of studies on acetyl L-carnitine.</p>
<p>You can look those up on PubMed if you like,</p>
<p>or on examine.com.</p>
<p>There are some studies that I don&rsquo;t think are included there</p>
<p>which are particularly interesting.</p>
<p>One that I just would like to reference.</p>
<p>The last name of the first author is Mahdavi.</p>
<p>So M-A-H-D-A-V-I.</p>
<p>The title of the paper is</p>
<p>Effects of L-carnitine Supplementation</p>
<p>on Serum Inflammatory Markers</p>
<p>and Matrix Metalloprotease Enzymes</p>
<p>in Females with Knee Osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>So this is a randomized,</p>
<p>double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study</p>
<p>that showed really interesting effects</p>
<p>of short-term supplementation of acetyl L-carnitine.</p>
<p>Longer term, the effects were less impressive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty interesting</p>
<p>that this compound has so many different effects.</p>
<p>How could it have these effects?</p>
<p>Well, it appears that it&rsquo;s having these effects</p>
<p>through its impact on the so-called inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>Inflammatory cytokines, for those of you that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>are secreted by the immune system</p>
<p>in response to different stressors,</p>
<p>physical stressors, mental stressors too,</p>
<p>food that you eat that isn&rsquo;t good for you,</p>
<p>the so-called hidden sugars,</p>
<p>yes, will increase inflammation</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re ingested too often</p>
<p>or in amounts that are too high in quantity.</p>
<p>Things like interleukin-1-beta,</p>
<p>things like C-reactive protein,</p>
<p>things like interleukin-6.</p>
<p>Interleukin-6 is kind of the generic inflammatory marker</p>
<p>that all studies refer to,</p>
<p>and yet there are other interleukins.</p>
<p>Please note that there are other interleukins</p>
<p>like interleukin-10 that are anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>So your immune system can secrete inflammatory molecules</p>
<p>to deal with wounds and stress and things,</p>
<p>and in the short term, that&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>and in the long term, that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>And it can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10.</p>
<p>And these matrix metalloproteases, it&rsquo;s kind of a mouthful,</p>
<p>but these matrix metalloproteases are very interesting.</p>
<p>Anytime you see A-S-E, ACE, that&rsquo;s generally an enzyme,</p>
<p>which means that these compounds, in this case,</p>
<p>these matrix metalloproteases,</p>
<p>are used to break down certain elements around wounds</p>
<p>and scarring, which might sound like a bad thing,</p>
<p>but in some cases is good because it allows certain cells,</p>
<p>like glial cells, so-called microglia,</p>
<p>to come in like little ambulances,</p>
<p>like little paramedics, and clean up wounds.</p>
<p>So scarring and inflammation is kind of a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>It can be good, but too much scarring,</p>
<p>if it contains a wound too much,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t allow the infiltration of cell types to move in</p>
<p>and take care of that wound and heal it up.</p>
<p>So it appears that L-carnitine is impacting</p>
<p>a number of different processes,</p>
<p>both to impact pain and perhaps,</p>
<p>and I want to underscore perhaps,</p>
<p>but there are good studies happening now,</p>
<p>perhaps accelerate wound healing as well.</p>
<p>As long as we&rsquo;re talking about acute pain and chronic pain</p>
<p>and supplementation and non-prescription drugs,</p>
<p>at least in the United States,</p>
<p>that people can take to deal with pain of various kinds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>the two that I get asked most often about,</p>
<p>which are agmatine and S-adenosylmethionine,</p>
<p>which is sometimes called SAMe.</p>
<p>Both of those have been shown to have some impact,</p>
<p>categorized on examiners, notable impact,</p>
<p>on various forms of pain due to osteoarthritis</p>
<p>or due to injury of various kinds</p>
<p>in different subject population,</p>
<p>men, women, people of different ages, et cetera.</p>
<p>SAMe in particular has been interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been shown head-to-head</p>
<p>with drugs like naproxen and other drugs of that sort,</p>
<p>which are well-established</p>
<p>and sold over the counter in the US,</p>
<p>to work at least as well as some of those compounds</p>
<p>at certain dosages.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also been shown that SAMe</p>
<p>and some of those things take more time</p>
<p>in order to have those effects.</p>
<p>In fact, head-to-head with things like naproxen</p>
<p>have been shown that they can take up to a month</p>
<p>in order to have the pain-relieving effect.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not that makes them a better choice</p>
<p>or a worse choice really depends on your circumstances.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not recommending that anybody take anything,</p>
<p>but I do think it&rsquo;s interesting and important to point out</p>
<p>that things like agmatine, things like SAMe</p>
<p>have been shown under certain circumstances</p>
<p>to be beneficial for pain,</p>
<p>and they are outside the realm of prescription drugs.</p>
<p>I think this is a growing area of,</p>
<p>some people call them supplements,</p>
<p>some people call them nutraceuticals.</p>
<p>Look, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>these are compounds that affect cellular processes,</p>
<p>and the more that we understand</p>
<p>how they affect those cellular processes,</p>
<p>as we now do for things like acetyl L-carnitine,</p>
<p>I think the more trust that we can put into them</p>
<p>or the more to which we might want to avoid them</p>
<p>because of some of the side effects or contraindications</p>
<p>that those compounds could have.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in those other compounds,</p>
<p>I do invite you, as I always do, to check out examine.com,</p>
<p>but also to do your research on those compounds</p>
<p>by simply putting them into Google</p>
<p>or putting them into PubMed, which would be even better.</p>
<p>And if you are going to go into PubMed,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to start playing scientists,</p>
<p>which I do encourage you to do,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to not just read abstracts,</p>
<p>but if you can, if the studies are freely available,</p>
<p>I realize not all of them are freely available,</p>
<p>to try and read those studies,</p>
<p>at least to the extent that you can.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a particularly nice study that you might look at</p>
<p>that was published in 2010 in Pain Medicine,</p>
<p>which is Keynan et al., K-E-Y-N-A-N,</p>
<p>which looked at the safety and efficacy</p>
<p>of dietary agmentine sulfate</p>
<p>on lumbar disc associated radiculopathy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not laughing at the condition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a painful condition that describes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a range of symptoms</p>
<p>that relate to pinching of nerves in the spinal columns.</p>
<p>I was laughing at my pronunciation of it.</p>
<p>That particular study is quite good.</p>
<p>And the conclusion of that study</p>
<p>that they drew was that there were limited side effects</p>
<p>and that dietary agmentine sulfate is safe and efficacious</p>
<p>for treating and alleviating pain</p>
<p>and improving quality of life</p>
<p>in lumbar disc associated pain.</p>
<p>However, there were very specific dosage regimens,</p>
<p>excuse me, that were described there</p>
<p>and duration of treatment.</p>
<p>And so you should not take anything that I say</p>
<p>or that study to mean that you can just take this stuff</p>
<p>willy nilly or at any concentration, of course, or dose.</p>
<p>You always want to pay attention to what the science says.</p>
<p>That paper, fortunately, is freely available online</p>
<p>and we will also provide a link to that study.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested in SAMe</p>
<p>and its usage for the treatment of various types of pain</p>
<p>and perhaps other benefits,</p>
<p>a number of companies have stopped making SAMe.</p>
<p>Instead, what they&rsquo;re now focusing on</p>
<p>is what they think is a better</p>
<p>or more bioavailable alternative,</p>
<p>which is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate</p>
<p>or 5-MTHF.</p>
<p>This molecule is necessary</p>
<p>for converting homocysteine to methionine,</p>
<p>which is then converted to SAMe.</p>
<p>So rather than taking SAMe directly,</p>
<p>the idea is to take something that&rsquo;s upstream of SAMe</p>
<p>and make more SAMe endogenously available.</p>
<p>This is a different strategy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this strategy before</p>
<p>for increasing other things like growth hormone, et cetera.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always this question of whether or not</p>
<p>in trying to increase the amount</p>
<p>of a particular molecule in the body,</p>
<p>whether or not taking that specific molecule</p>
<p>is the best thing or working further upstream,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s referred to,</p>
<p>working on the precursor</p>
<p>or increasing the levels of the precursor</p>
<p>is the better way to go.</p>
<p>It appears that this 5-MTHF</p>
<p>is the strategy that people are now taking</p>
<p>in place of taking SAMe directly.</p>
<p>So in other words, they&rsquo;re taking this</p>
<p>in order to get elevated levels of SAMe.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to turn our attention</p>
<p>to a completely non-drug, non-supplement related approach</p>
<p>to dealing with pain.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that has existed for thousands of years</p>
<p>and that only recently</p>
<p>has the Western scientific community</p>
<p>started to pay serious attention to,</p>
<p>but they have started to pay serious attention to it.</p>
<p>And there is terrific mechanistic science</p>
<p>to now explain how and why acupuncture</p>
<p>can work very well</p>
<p>for the treatment of certain forms of pain.</p>
<p>Now, first off, I want to tell you what was told to me</p>
<p>by our director or chief of the pain division</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey,</p>
<p>which was that some people respond very well to acupuncture</p>
<p>and others do not.</p>
<p>And the challenge is identifying who will respond well</p>
<p>and who won&rsquo;t respond well.</p>
<p>Now, when I say won&rsquo;t respond well,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that they responded</p>
<p>in a negative way, that it was bad for them,</p>
<p>but it does appear that a fraction of people</p>
<p>experience tremendous pain relief from acupuncture</p>
<p>and others experience none at all or very little</p>
<p>to the point where they have to seek out</p>
<p>other forms of treatment.</p>
<p>The science on this is still ongoing.</p>
<p>There was actually an excellent paper published on this</p>
<p>in the Journal of the American Medical Association,</p>
<p>one of the premier medical clinical journals.</p>
<p>And it basically reinforced the idea</p>
<p>that you have responders and non-responders.</p>
<p>A number of laboratories have started to explore</p>
<p>how acupuncture works.</p>
<p>And one of the premier laboratories for this</p>
<p>is Chufu Ma&rsquo;s lab at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>Chufu has spent many years studying the pain system</p>
<p>and a system that&rsquo;s related to the pain system,</p>
<p>which is the system that controls our sensation of itch.</p>
<p>Just as a brief aside about itch,</p>
<p>itch and pain are often co-associated with one another.</p>
<p>I was recently in Texas and I will tell you,</p>
<p>they have some mean mosquitoes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re small, but whatever they&rsquo;re injecting into your skin,</p>
<p>well, here I am talking now</p>
<p>about my subjective experience of pain.</p>
<p>Whatever they injected into my skin felt to me</p>
<p>like the most extreme mosquito bites I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Not while they were biting me,</p>
<p>not while they were injecting the venom,</p>
<p>but boy, do those Texan mosquitoes make me itch.</p>
<p>How do they do it?</p>
<p>Well, their venom creates little packets</p>
<p>of so-called histamine that travel around.</p>
<p>Those packets are called mast cells,</p>
<p>little packets of histamine that go to that location</p>
<p>and make me, and presumably you,</p>
<p>want to scratch those mosquito bites.</p>
<p>I scratch mine, you scratch yours,</p>
<p>but we both scratch our mosquito bites.</p>
<p>And when we do that, the histamines are released,</p>
<p>it gets red and inflamed, and they itch even worse.</p>
<p>The inflammation is actually caused by the histamine.</p>
<p>Well, that experience of inflammation and pain and itch</p>
<p>is what we call a prurogenic experience, okay?</p>
<p>So we have pain, which is nociception, essentially.</p>
<p>I know that the pain aficionados always get a little upset</p>
<p>because they say, oh, there&rsquo;s no such thing</p>
<p>as a pain receptor, it&rsquo;s nociceptive receptors,</p>
<p>and pain is subjective experience.</p>
<p>Yes, I acknowledge all that, but for fluency,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just think about pain as a certain experience</p>
<p>and itch as a separate experience,</p>
<p>but they often exist together</p>
<p>because those mosquito bites were what I would call painful</p>
<p>or at least not pleasant.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t just itch, they were also painful,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because itch brings with it inflammation,</p>
<p>and inflammation often brings with it pain relief,</p>
<p>but it can also bring with it the sensation of pain.</p>
<p>So itch and pain are two separate phenomenon.</p>
<p>It was actually discovered</p>
<p>through a really interesting phenomenon</p>
<p>that relates to something that is actually consumed</p>
<p>in supplement form, which is this tropical legume.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a bean called mucuna purines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s M-U-C-U-N-A, that&rsquo;s one word, P-R-U-I-E-N-S.</p>
<p>Mucuna purines is a bean, it&rsquo;s this legume,</p>
<p>that this bean is 99% L-dopa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dopamine, or rather, it&rsquo;s the precursor to dopamine,</p>
<p>and people buy this stuff and take it over the counter</p>
<p>as ways to increase their levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>It does make you feel really dopamined out.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes you feel a little high</p>
<p>and really motivated and really energetic,</p>
<p>a lot like other drugs that will do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily recommend taking mucuna purines.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t like taking it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make me feel good.</p>
<p>I crash really hard when I take it,</p>
<p>but on the outside of this bean</p>
<p>is a compound that makes people itch, okay?</p>
<p>So they remove this when you take it in supplement form.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s usually in capsule form,</p>
<p>but the outside of this bean, it&rsquo;s like a hairy bean, right?</p>
<p>And those little hairs contain a compound</p>
<p>which was actually used to study</p>
<p>and identify these itch receptors in the skin.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have time to go into all the details of itch,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s pretty interesting that you have these compounds</p>
<p>out in nature that can make us itch.</p>
<p>Inside them, they have dopamine.</p>
<p>I mean, this is really weird,</p>
<p>but plant compounds are really powerful.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you that</p>
<p>because something&rsquo;s from a plant or an herb</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not powerful.</p>
<p>There are very powerful plant and herb compounds,</p>
<p>mucunipurines being one of them</p>
<p>with dopamine on the inside and itchy stuff on the outside.</p>
<p>Now, what does this all have to do with acupuncture?</p>
<p>Well, Chufu Ma&rsquo;s lab has not just identified</p>
<p>the itch pathway, there&rsquo;s pruritogens as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>which cause itch and the prurigenic phenomenon</p>
<p>of itch being separate from pain.</p>
<p>His lab has also studied how acupuncture</p>
<p>causes relief of, but also can exacerbate pain.</p>
<p>Now, the form of acupuncture that they explored</p>
<p>was one that&rsquo;s commonly in use called electroacupuncture.</p>
<p>So this isn&rsquo;t just putting little needles</p>
<p>into different parts of the body.</p>
<p>These needles are able to pass an electrical current,</p>
<p>not magically, but because they have a little wire</p>
<p>going back to a device and you can pass electrical current.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they found.</p>
<p>This is a study, excuse me,</p>
<p>published in the journal Neuron, cell press journal,</p>
<p>excellent journal, very high stringency.</p>
<p>So what Chufu Ma&rsquo;s lab found was that</p>
<p>if electroacupuncture is provided to the abdomen,</p>
<p>to the stomach area, it creates activation</p>
<p>of what are called the sympathetic ganglia.</p>
<p>These have nothing to do with sympathy</p>
<p>in the emotional sense, has to do with the stress response.</p>
<p>Sympa just means together.</p>
<p>So it activated a bunch of neurons along the spinal cord</p>
<p>and the activation of these neurons involves</p>
<p>noradrenaline and something called NPY, neuropeptide Y.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that stimulating the abdomen</p>
<p>with electroacupuncture was either anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>or it could cause inflammation.</p>
<p>It could actually exacerbate inflammation</p>
<p>depending on whether or not it was of low</p>
<p>or high intensity.</p>
<p>Now that makes it a very precarious technique.</p>
<p>And this may speak to some of the reason</p>
<p>why some people report relief from acupuncture</p>
<p>and others do not.</p>
<p>However, they went a step further</p>
<p>and stimulated other areas of the body</p>
<p>using electroacupuncture.</p>
<p>And what they found is that stimulation of the legs,</p>
<p>of the hind limbs, as it&rsquo;s called in animals</p>
<p>and the legs in humans caused a circuit,</p>
<p>a neural circuit to be activated that goes from the legs</p>
<p>up to an area of the base of the brain called the DMV,</p>
<p>not the DMH, which I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>but the DMV, like you go the DMV,</p>
<p>which is a miserable experience for most people,</p>
<p>forgive me DMV employees, but let&rsquo;s be honest,</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t enjoy going to the DMV as patrons,</p>
<p>but we have to, so we go.</p>
<p>The DMV and low intensity stimulation,</p>
<p>this electroacupuncture of the hind limbs</p>
<p>activated the DMV and activated the adrenal glands,</p>
<p>which sit atop your kidneys and caused the release</p>
<p>of what are called catecholamines.</p>
<p>And those were strongly anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>In other words, electroacupuncture of the legs and feet</p>
<p>can, if done correctly, be anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>and reduce symptoms of pain.</p>
<p>And can we think accelerate wound healing</p>
<p>because activations of these catecholaminergic pathways</p>
<p>can accelerate wound healing as well.</p>
<p>So the takeaway from this is that</p>
<p>while there are thousands of years</p>
<p>and millions of subjects involved in explorations</p>
<p>of electroacupuncture and acupuncture,</p>
<p>Western medicine is starting to come into this</p>
<p>and start to explore underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that love acupuncture</p>
<p>and are real proponents of it, it&rsquo;s worked for you,</p>
<p>you might say, well, why does Western medicine</p>
<p>even need to come into this?</p>
<p>Why should they even be exploring this?</p>
<p>But we should all be relieved that they are</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s starting to happen now</p>
<p>is that as the mechanistic basis for this</p>
<p>is starting to come to light,</p>
<p>insurance coverage of things like acupuncture</p>
<p>is starting to emerge as well.</p>
<p>And this is in contrast to other therapies</p>
<p>for which there&rsquo;s a lot of anecdotal evidence,</p>
<p>but very little mechanistic understanding.</p>
<p>One example of that would be laser photobiomodulation,</p>
<p>the use of lasers of different types, really,</p>
<p>to treat pain and to accelerate wound healing.</p>
<p>A lot of people claim that this can really help them.</p>
<p>However, most places, at least in the States,</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t cover this with insurance</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t perform this in standard clinics.</p>
<p>And the reason is the underlying mechanism isn&rsquo;t known.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to get into the argument</p>
<p>about whether or not mechanistic understanding</p>
<p>should or should not be required</p>
<p>in order to have insurance coverage of things that work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what this is about.</p>
<p>And that actually would be a boring discussion</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m shouting at a tunnel through you</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hear you shout back</p>
<p>no matter what your stance on that is.</p>
<p>But just trust me when I say</p>
<p>that I am both relieved and delighted to hear</p>
<p>that excellent medical institutions like Stanford</p>
<p>are starting to think about electroacupuncture</p>
<p>and how it can work,</p>
<p>that places like Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>are starting to explore this at a mechanistic level.</p>
<p>And I do believe that there&rsquo;s an open-mindedness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s starting to emerge.</p>
<p>For instance, the National Institutes of Health</p>
<p>not only has a Institute for Mental Health</p>
<p>and Cancer Research and an Eye Institute,</p>
<p>but now Complementary Health,</p>
<p>the so-called NCCIH,</p>
<p>National Institutes of Complementary Health</p>
<p>that is exploring things like electroacupuncture,</p>
<p>meditation, various supplements and things of those sort.</p>
<p>I do think that we&rsquo;re entering a new realm</p>
<p>in which things like pain and pain management</p>
<p>will be met with more openness by all physicians,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>So please take that into consideration.</p>
<p>Right now, the mechanistic evidence</p>
<p>for laser photobiomodulation is not strong.</p>
<p>One of the major issues or the barriers to that</p>
<p>is that most of the studies that are out there</p>
<p>were actually paid for by companies</p>
<p>that build devices for laser photobiomodulation.</p>
<p>And so we really need independent studies</p>
<p>funded by federal institutions</p>
<p>that have no bias or financial relationship</p>
<p>in order to gain trust in whatever data happened to emerge.</p>
<p>There is a technique</p>
<p>that at one time was considered alternative,</p>
<p>but now has a lot of mechanistic science</p>
<p>to explain how it works.</p>
<p>And it does indeed work for the treatment of chronic</p>
<p>and also for acute pain.</p>
<p>And that treatment is hypnosis,</p>
<p>in particular, self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>My colleague at Stanford, in fact, my collaborator,</p>
<p>Dr. David Spiegel, our Associate Chair of Psychiatry,</p>
<p>has devoted his professional life</p>
<p>to developing hypnosis tools</p>
<p>that people can use to help them sleep better,</p>
<p>focus better, stay motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>While most people hear hypnosis and they think,</p>
<p>oh, this is stage hypnosis,</p>
<p>people walking around like chickens</p>
<p>or being forced to laugh or fall asleep on command, et cetera,</p>
<p>this is completely different than all that.</p>
<p>This is self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>And there are now dozens, if not more,</p>
<p>quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>published in excellent journals</p>
<p>done by Dr. Spiegel and others at other universities.</p>
<p>It really all has to do with how self-hypnosis</p>
<p>can modulate activity of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And related structures like the insula.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is involved</p>
<p>in our executive function, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>our planning, our decision-making,</p>
<p>but also how we interpret context,</p>
<p>what the meaning of a given sensation is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Just want to remind everybody</p>
<p>that the currency of the brain and body</p>
<p>has not changed in hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been dopamine, serotonin, glutamate,</p>
<p>GABA, testosterone, estrogen.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s changed are the contingencies,</p>
<p>the events in the world that drive</p>
<p>whether or not we get an increase or decrease</p>
<p>in testosterone or estrogen.</p>
<p>The events in the world that dictate</p>
<p>whether or not we get an increase</p>
<p>or a decrease in dopamine.</p>
<p>Believe me, the events that drove those increases</p>
<p>and decreases were very different</p>
<p>even a hundred years ago than they are now.</p>
<p>And as we create new things and societies change, et cetera,</p>
<p>they will continue to exchange information</p>
<p>in the same currency, which is dopamine, serotonin,</p>
<p>and all these other neuromodulators and chemicals.</p>
<p>Hypnosis takes advantage of this</p>
<p>by allowing an individual, you if you like,</p>
<p>to change the way that you interpret particular events</p>
<p>and to actually experience what would be painful</p>
<p>as less painful or not painful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the example of pain.</p>
<p>Hypnosis is powerful for other reasons too.</p>
<p>It actually can help rewire neural circuits</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t experience as much pain</p>
<p>so that you can sleep faster, focus faster.</p>
<p>If this is all sounding very fantastical,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s supported by data.</p>
<p>The data are that when people do self-hypnosis,</p>
<p>even brief self-hypnosis of 10 or 15 minutes</p>
<p>a few times a week, maybe even return to that hypnosis</p>
<p>by just using a one minute a day hypnosis,</p>
<p>they can achieve significant</p>
<p>and often very impressive degrees of pain relief</p>
<p>in chronic pain, whether or not that chronic pain arises</p>
<p>through things like fibromyalgia or through other sources.</p>
<p>If you want to check this out,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wonderful zero cost resource</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grounded in this work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the app, reveri.com.</p>
<p>So R-E-V-E-R-I.com.</p>
<p>There you can download a zero cost app</p>
<p>for Apple phones or for Android phones.</p>
<p>And there are a variety of different hypnosis scripts.</p>
<p>These are actually self-hypnosis scripts.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll actually hear Dr. David Spiegel talking to you.</p>
<p>He can teach you about hypnosis and how it works.</p>
<p>There are links to scientific studies</p>
<p>at that web address that I gave you before, reveri.com.</p>
<p>You can see the various studies</p>
<p>and the various write-ups related to those studies</p>
<p>and how this all works.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re simple protocols.</p>
<p>You just click on a tab and you listen to the self-hypnosis</p>
<p>and it will take you into hypnosis.</p>
<p>And several of those hypnosis scripts</p>
<p>have been shown clinically</p>
<p>to relieve certain patterns of chronic pain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a powerful tool.</p>
<p>And I encourage you not to write off the non-drug,</p>
<p>non-supplement tools as less than powerful</p>
<p>because indeed many people experience</p>
<p>tremendous relief from them.</p>
<p>And of course they also can be combined</p>
<p>with drug treatments if that&rsquo;s right for you</p>
<p>or with supplements and things of that sort to treat pain</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>So again, electroacupuncture now often supported</p>
<p>by insurance, not always, but often.</p>
<p>Great mechanistic data starting to emerge.</p>
<p>Hypnosis, terrific tool.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even the self-hypnosis tool</p>
<p>that one can access through the zero-cost app Reveri</p>
<p>and lots of great clinical data</p>
<p>and scientific mechanistic data.</p>
<p>There are neuroimaging studies</p>
<p>showing the different brain areas are activated in hypnosis,</p>
<p>so-called default network,</p>
<p>kind of where your brain kind of idles</p>
<p>and the different circuits that are active at rest</p>
<p>shift with hypnosis and shift long-term</p>
<p>in ways that positively can serve you.</p>
<p>And then these things like laser photobiomodulation</p>
<p>still more or less in that experimental medical community,</p>
<p>I should say Western medical community, not so certain,</p>
<p>but hopefully there will be data soon</p>
<p>and hopefully those data will point to mechanisms</p>
<p>that allow the insurance companies</p>
<p>and other sort of medical bodies to support them</p>
<p>if indeed they have a mechanistic basis.</p>
<p>I just want to briefly touch on a common method</p>
<p>of pain relief that speaks to a more general principle</p>
<p>of how things like electroacupuncture</p>
<p>and also some of these new emerging techniques</p>
<p>of kind of like active tissue release</p>
<p>and this principle that you hear a lot about</p>
<p>in sports medicine now,</p>
<p>that when you have pain or injury at one site</p>
<p>that you should provide pressure above and below that site.</p>
<p>You may have seen this in the Olympics,</p>
<p>which is ongoing now,</p>
<p>where people will put tape on their body</p>
<p>at certain locations.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the logic or what they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is that this is designed to create relief</p>
<p>in a joint or in a limb that&rsquo;s below the tape,</p>
<p>not necessarily under the tape, but above or below.</p>
<p>So for instance, if there&rsquo;s pain in one shoulder,</p>
<p>sometimes people will put it on the trapezius muscle</p>
<p>or things of that sort.</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a basis for this</p>
<p>because of the way that these different nerves</p>
<p>run in from the skin and from the muscles</p>
<p>up into the spinal cord and into the brainstem,</p>
<p>providing pressure on one nerve pathway</p>
<p>can often impact another pathway.</p>
<p>And the simplest and most common example of this</p>
<p>is one that we all do instinctually or intuitively,</p>
<p>even animals do this.</p>
<p>This is something that in the textbooks</p>
<p>is called the gait theory of pain</p>
<p>developed by Melzack and Wall, kind of classic theory.</p>
<p>Basically we have receptors in our skin,</p>
<p>the so-called C-fibers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a name for these little wires</p>
<p>that come from a particular class of DRGs that&rsquo;s very thin</p>
<p>that brings about certain kinds of nociceptor information.</p>
<p>I want to say pain information,</p>
<p>but then the pain people,</p>
<p>believe it or not, they&rsquo;re pain people.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re a pain because what they tell me</p>
<p>is there aren&rsquo;t pain receptors, okay, nociceptors.</p>
<p>That information comes in through the C-fibers.</p>
<p>And what happens when we injure something?</p>
<p>Well, provided that we won&rsquo;t damage it worse by touching it,</p>
<p>oftentimes what we will do is we will rub the source of pain</p>
<p>or the location in which we were experiencing pain.</p>
<p>And it turns out that&rsquo;s not an unuseful thing to do.</p>
<p>When we rub our skin or an area</p>
<p>or we provide pressure nearby it,</p>
<p>we activate the so-called A-fibers,</p>
<p>the bigger wires and neurons that innervate,</p>
<p>meaning they jut into that area of skin.</p>
<p>And those A-fibers,</p>
<p>the ones that respond to mechanical pressure</p>
<p>actually are able to inhibit those C-fibers,</p>
<p>the ones that are carrying that so-called pain information.</p>
<p>So rubbing an area or providing pressure</p>
<p>above or below an injury</p>
<p>actually provides real pain relief support</p>
<p>for the location of that injury or that pain</p>
<p>because of the way that these different patterns</p>
<p>or these different types of neurons</p>
<p>interact with one another.</p>
<p>When I say it inhibits it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that it like shouts at it.</p>
<p>What it does is it releases,</p>
<p>it literally kind of like vomits up a little bit</p>
<p>of a neurotransmitter called GABA.</p>
<p>And GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits.</p>
<p>It quiets the activity of other neurons.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s acting as kind of an analgesic, if you will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s acting as its own form of drug</p>
<p>that you make with your body</p>
<p>to quiet the activity of these pain neurons.</p>
<p>So rubbing a wound,</p>
<p>provided it doesn&rsquo;t damage the wound worse,</p>
<p>or providing pressure above or below,</p>
<p>typically it&rsquo;s above,</p>
<p>a particular injury can have a real effect</p>
<p>in relieving some of the pain of that injury.</p>
<p>And some people have speculated this is through fascia</p>
<p>or this is through other bodily organs and tissues.</p>
<p>And it might be.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do a whole episode on fascia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely interesting tissue.</p>
<p>But right now,</p>
<p>it seems that the main source of that pain relief</p>
<p>is through this A-fiber inhibition of these C-fibers,</p>
<p>so-called Melzack and Wall-Gate theory of pain,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to look it up and learn about that further.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about a phenomenon</p>
<p>that has long intrigued and perplexed people</p>
<p>for probably thousands of years.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s redheads.</p>
<p>You may have heard before</p>
<p>that redheads have a higher pain threshold</p>
<p>than other individuals.</p>
<p>And indeed that is true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s now a study that looked at this mechanistically.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gene called the MC1R gene.</p>
<p>And this MC1R gene encodes</p>
<p>for a number of different proteins.</p>
<p>Some of those proteins, of course,</p>
<p>are related to the production of melanin.</p>
<p>This is why redheads often, not always,</p>
<p>but often are very fair-skinned,</p>
<p>sometimes have freckles, not always,</p>
<p>and of course have red hair.</p>
<p>Some people are really intense gingers,</p>
<p>not psychologically or emotionally intense,</p>
<p>perhaps that too,</p>
<p>but meaning their hair is very, very red.</p>
<p>Others, it&rsquo;s a lighter red.</p>
<p>So of course there&rsquo;s variation here.</p>
<p>But this gene, this MC1R gene,</p>
<p>is associated with a pathway</p>
<p>that relates to something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast before</p>
<p>during the episode on hunger and feeding.</p>
<p>And this is POMC.</p>
<p>POMC stands for pro-opio-melanocortin.</p>
<p>And POMC is cut up, it&rsquo;s cleaved into different hormones,</p>
<p>including one that enhances pain perception.</p>
<p>This is melanocyte-stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>And another one that blocks pain, beta-endorphin.</p>
<p>Now, if you listen to the episodes</p>
<p>on testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>and the episodes on hunger and feeding,</p>
<p>some of these molecules will start to ring a bell.</p>
<p>Things like melanostimulating hormone</p>
<p>relate to pigmentation in the skin,</p>
<p>relate to sexual arousal, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it turns out that in redheads,</p>
<p>because of the fact that they have this gene,</p>
<p>this MC1R gene,</p>
<p>the POMC, pro-opio-melanocortin,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cut into different hormones,</p>
<p>melanocyte-stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>and another one, beta-endorphin.</p>
<p>Beta-endorphin should cue you to the fact</p>
<p>that this is in the pain pathway.</p>
<p>The endorphins are endogenously made,</p>
<p>meaning made within our body, opioids.</p>
<p>They actually make us feel numb</p>
<p>in response to certain kinds of pain.</p>
<p>Now, not completely numb,</p>
<p>but they numb or reduce our perception of pain</p>
<p>because of the ways in which they are released</p>
<p>from certain brain centers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about those brain centers in a moment.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>is that this study showed</p>
<p>that the presence of these hormones is in everybody.</p>
<p>We all have melanocortin-4,</p>
<p>we all have beta-endorphins,</p>
<p>we all have POMC, et cetera,</p>
<p>but redheads make more of these endogenous endorphins.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It allows them to buffer against the pain response.</p>
<p>I have a personal anecdote to share with you</p>
<p>about this redhead</p>
<p>and heightened levels of pain tolerance phenomenon.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not a redhead.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t dye my hair,</p>
<p>but my partner for many years was a redhead</p>
<p>and still is a redhead.</p>
<p>She had bright red hair and had that since childhood.</p>
<p>Well, we had the fortunate experience</p>
<p>of becoming friends with Wim Hof and family.</p>
<p>They actually came out to visit us</p>
<p>and did a series of seminars in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>This was in 2016, as I recall.</p>
<p>And my partner, she had never done an ice bath.</p>
<p>She had never done any kind of real cold water</p>
<p>exposure experience before,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s one particular gathering,</p>
<p>as is often the case when Wim is around,</p>
<p>there was an ice bath</p>
<p>and a number of people were getting into this thing.</p>
<p>This was actually before a dinner event.</p>
<p>And I think for most people who have never done an ice bath,</p>
<p>getting in for 30 seconds or a minute is tolerable,</p>
<p>but it takes some effort,</p>
<p>takes some willpower,</p>
<p>and takes some overcoming that pain barrier</p>
<p>because it is a little bit painful, not a lot.</p>
<p>Some people can stay in longer,</p>
<p>three minutes, five minutes without much discomfort.</p>
<p>What was incredible is that without any desire</p>
<p>to compete with anybody else,</p>
<p>my partner Redhead got into the ice bath</p>
<p>and just like sat there for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>In fact, at one point she just kind of turned to me</p>
<p>and said, you know, I don&rsquo;t really feel pain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really in pain.</p>
<p>And Wim loved this.</p>
<p>Wim thought it was great.</p>
<p>He thought it was like the most terrific thing in the world.</p>
<p>And he got back in the ice bath and they became fast friends</p>
<p>and I think they&rsquo;re probably still fast friends.</p>
<p>So in any event, that&rsquo;s an N of one,</p>
<p>what we call an anecdata example.</p>
<p>Anecdata is not really a term that we should use too much</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s N of one anecdotes are just that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just anecdotes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been described many times in various clinics</p>
<p>that were by anesthesiologists,</p>
<p>by observation of coaches, et cetera,</p>
<p>that Redheads, men and women who are Redheads</p>
<p>seem to have this higher pain threshold.</p>
<p>And it does seem to be because their body</p>
<p>naturally produces ways to counter the pain response.</p>
<p>They produce their own endogenous opioids.</p>
<p>Now this of course should not be taken to mean</p>
<p>that Redheads can tolerate more pain</p>
<p>and therefore should be subjected to more pain.</p>
<p>All it means is that their threshold for pain on average,</p>
<p>not all of them, but on average is shifted higher</p>
<p>than that of other individuals.</p>
<p>And it remains to be determined whether or not</p>
<p>other light skin, light haired individuals</p>
<p>also have a heightened level of pain threshold.</p>
<p>And I should mention, because I mentioned the ice bath,</p>
<p>that of course pain threshold is something</p>
<p>that can be built up and provide you do that safely</p>
<p>in ways that aren&rsquo;t damaging your tissues.</p>
<p>Because of course, pain is a signal</p>
<p>that is designed to help you to keep from harming yourself.</p>
<p>But provided that you can do that in a way that&rsquo;s safe</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t damage your tissues,</p>
<p>increasing your pain threshold</p>
<p>through the use of things like ice baths</p>
<p>is something that really can be done.</p>
<p>It has a lot to do with these contextual</p>
<p>or top-down modulations of the experience.</p>
<p>You can tell yourself that this is good for me,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m doing this by choice or whatever it is,</p>
<p>you could distract yourself.</p>
<p>There are a huge number of different ways</p>
<p>that one could do that.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting ways for which</p>
<p>there are actually really good scientific data</p>
<p>come from my colleague, Sean Mackey&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>And that actually looked at how love,</p>
<p>and in particular the experience of obsessive love</p>
<p>could actually counter the pain response,</p>
<p>not just in redheads, but in everybody.</p>
<p>So that study, I&rsquo;ll just briefly describe,</p>
<p>it involved having people come into the laboratory</p>
<p>and experience any one or a number</p>
<p>of different painful stimuli,</p>
<p>but they had selectively recruited subjects</p>
<p>that were in new relationships</p>
<p>for which there was a high degree of infatuation.</p>
<p>So much so that the people couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about</p>
<p>or communicating with that new partner</p>
<p>up to 80% of their waking time, which is a lot.</p>
<p>That constant obsessing about that partner</p>
<p>was correlated with, it wasn&rsquo;t causal necessarily,</p>
<p>but was correlated with the ability</p>
<p>to sustain higher levels of pain</p>
<p>than people who were in more typical</p>
<p>non-obsessive forms of love,</p>
<p>longstanding relationships</p>
<p>where there wasn&rsquo;t long obsessive love rather.</p>
<p>And of course, in this study,</p>
<p>there were a lot of good control groups.</p>
<p>They included a distractor,</p>
<p>they included people obsessing about other things,</p>
<p>their pet, et cetera.</p>
<p>They included other forms of love and attachment,</p>
<p>but it does seem that certain patterns of thinking</p>
<p>can allow us to buffer ourselves against the pain response.</p>
<p>And that should not be surprising.</p>
<p>Certain forms of thinking are associated</p>
<p>with the release of particular neuromodulators,</p>
<p>in particular dopamine.</p>
<p>And dopamine, it may seem,</p>
<p>is kind of the thing that underlies everything,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a molecule that&rsquo;s associated with novelty,</p>
<p>expectation, motivation, and reward.</p>
<p>We talked about this at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really the molecule of expectation</p>
<p>and motivation and hope and excitement</p>
<p>more than it&rsquo;s associated with the receival of the reward.</p>
<p>Well, dopamine is coursing throughout the brain</p>
<p>at heightened levels and coursing throughout the body</p>
<p>at heightened levels when we fall in love.</p>
<p>This probably has some adaptive mechanism</p>
<p>that ensured pair bonding between people,</p>
<p>or who knows, maybe it ensured</p>
<p>not bonding to multiple people.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows how dopamine functions</p>
<p>in terms of pair bonding,</p>
<p>but it is known that when people fall in love,</p>
<p>new relationships create very high levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably the mechanistic basis</p>
<p>by which these people were able to buffer the pain response</p>
<p>by thinking about their partner or this new relationship</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in almost obsessively or obsessively.</p>
<p>Now that raises a deeper question.</p>
<p>We should always be asking, yeah, but how, how?</p>
<p>Well, the dopamine system can have powerful effects</p>
<p>on the inflammation system.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t do this through mysterious ways.</p>
<p>It does this by interacting through the brainstem</p>
<p>and some of the neurons that innervate the spleen</p>
<p>and other areas of the body that deploy cells</p>
<p>to go combat infection, inflammation, and pain.</p>
<p>And the ways in which dopamine can modulate pain,</p>
<p>and in this case, this particular study,</p>
<p>transform our experience of pain,</p>
<p>maybe even into something that&rsquo;s pleasurable,</p>
<p>is not mysterious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really through the activation of brainstem neurons</p>
<p>that communicate with areas of our body</p>
<p>that deploy things like immune cells.</p>
<p>So for instance, we have neurons in our brainstem</p>
<p>that can be modulated by the release of dopamine.</p>
<p>And those neurons in the brainstem</p>
<p>control the release of immune cells</p>
<p>from tissues like the spleen or organs like the spleen.</p>
<p>And those immune cells can then go combat infection.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard before that when we&rsquo;re happy,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re better able to combat infection, deal with pain,</p>
<p>deal with all sorts of things.</p>
<p>It essentially makes us more resilient.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not because dopamine is some magic molecule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because dopamine affects particular circuits</p>
<p>and tells, in a very neurobiological way,</p>
<p>in a biochemical way, tells those cells and circuits</p>
<p>that conditions are good.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there&rsquo;s pain in the body,</p>
<p>conditions are good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in love, or conditions are good.</p>
<p>You want to be in this experience.</p>
<p>Or conditions are good.</p>
<p>This is for a greater cause,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re fighting or suffering for some larger purpose.</p>
<p>So all of that has existed largely</p>
<p>in the realm of psychology and even motivational literature</p>
<p>and this kind of thing.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a real mechanistic basis for it.</p>
<p>Dopamine is a molecule that can bind to receptor sites</p>
<p>on these brain areas.</p>
<p>Those brain areas can then modulate the organs</p>
<p>and tissues of the body</p>
<p>that can allow us to lean into challenge.</p>
<p>And those challenges can be infection.</p>
<p>It can be physical pain.</p>
<p>It can be long bouts of effort that are required of us.</p>
<p>And I think many people have described the feeling</p>
<p>of being newly in love as a heightened level of energy,</p>
<p>a capacity to do anything.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole concept of a muse</p>
<p>is one in which some individual or some thing</p>
<p>either imagined or real enters our life.</p>
<p>And we can use that as fuel.</p>
<p>And that fuel is chemical fuel.</p>
<p>And that chemical fuel is dopamine.</p>
<p>And it really does allow for more resilience</p>
<p>and can even transform the experience of pain</p>
<p>or what would otherwise be pain</p>
<p>into an experience of pleasure.</p>
<p>So along those lines, let&rsquo;s talk about pleasure.</p>
<p>With all the cells and tissues and machinery</p>
<p>related to pain,</p>
<p>you might think that our entire touch system</p>
<p>is designed to allow us to detect pain</p>
<p>and to avoid tissue damage.</p>
<p>And while a good percentage of it is devoted to that,</p>
<p>a good percentage of it is also devoted</p>
<p>to this thing that we call pleasure.</p>
<p>And that should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>Pleasure isn&rsquo;t just there for our pleasure.</p>
<p>It serves an adaptive role.</p>
<p>And that adaptive role relates to the fact</p>
<p>that every species has a primary goal,</p>
<p>which is to make more of itself.</p>
<p>Otherwise it would go extinct.</p>
<p>That process of making more of itself,</p>
<p>sexual reproduction, is closely associated</p>
<p>with the sensation and the perception of pleasure.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no surprise that not only is the highest density</p>
<p>of sensory receptors in and on and around the genitalia,</p>
<p>but the process of reproduction evokes sensations</p>
<p>and molecules and perceptions associated with pleasure.</p>
<p>And the currency of pleasure exists</p>
<p>in multiple chemical systems,</p>
<p>but the primary ones are the dopamine system,</p>
<p>which is the anticipation of pleasure</p>
<p>and the work required to achieve the ability</p>
<p>to experience that pleasure,</p>
<p>and the serotonin system,</p>
<p>which is more closely related</p>
<p>to the immediate experience of that pleasure.</p>
<p>And from dopamine and serotonin stem out other hormones</p>
<p>and molecules, things like oxytocin,</p>
<p>which are associated with pair bonding.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is more closely associated</p>
<p>with the serotonin system biochemically</p>
<p>and at the circuit level,</p>
<p>meaning the areas of the brain and body</p>
<p>that manufacture a lot of serotonin.</p>
<p>Usually, not always, but usually contain neurons</p>
<p>that also manufacture and make use of the molecule oxytocin.</p>
<p>Those chemicals together create sensations of warmth,</p>
<p>of wellbeing, of safety.</p>
<p>The dopamine molecule is more closely associated</p>
<p>with hormones like testosterone</p>
<p>and other molecules involved with pursuit</p>
<p>and further effort in order to get more of whatever</p>
<p>could potentially cause more release of dopamine.</p>
<p>So this is a very broad strokes, no pun intended,</p>
<p>description of the pleasure system.</p>
<p>There are of course other molecules as well.</p>
<p>One in particular that&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>is something called PEA.</p>
<p>PEA stands for phenol ethylamine,</p>
<p>sometimes also referred to as phenol ethylamine,</p>
<p>depending on who you are and where you live,</p>
<p>how you pronounce it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>PEA is a molecule which is incredibly potent</p>
<p>at augmenting or increasing the activity</p>
<p>of certain cells and neural circuits</p>
<p>that relate to the pleasure system.</p>
<p>PEA has purportedly been thought to be released</p>
<p>in response to ingestion of things</p>
<p>like certain forms of dark chocolate,</p>
<p>some people take it in supplement form,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit of a stimulant,</p>
<p>but it also seems to heighten the perception of pleasure</p>
<p>in response to a particular amount</p>
<p>of dopamine and or serotonin.</p>
<p>So for instance, in a kind of a arbitrary experiment</p>
<p>and units type example,</p>
<p>if a given experience evokes a particular amount</p>
<p>of serotonin and dopamine and gives rise</p>
<p>to a subjective experience of pleasure</p>
<p>of say level three out of 10,</p>
<p>the ingestion of PEA prior to that experience</p>
<p>can increase the rating of that experience</p>
<p>as more pleasureful, maybe a four or a five or even a six.</p>
<p>And PEA is known to be present in,</p>
<p>or I should say its release is stimulated</p>
<p>by a number of different compounds,</p>
<p>such as dark chocolate, certain things like aspartame</p>
<p>and certain people can actually increase</p>
<p>the amount of PEA released.</p>
<p>Some of these glutamate related molecules like aspartame</p>
<p>or things that are in the glutamate pathway</p>
<p>can increase PEA release.</p>
<p>And then some people will actually take PEA</p>
<p>in supplement form for its mild stimulant properties,</p>
<p>as well as for increasing the perception of</p>
<p>or the ability to experience pleasure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like dopamine itself.</p>
<p>People that take things like mucunipurines, L-DOPA,</p>
<p>or drugs of abuse, which I certainly don&rsquo;t recommend,</p>
<p>things like cocaine or amphetamine</p>
<p>experience tremendous increases in dopamine,</p>
<p>not so much increases in serotonin.</p>
<p>Some people will take serotonin in precursor form</p>
<p>like 5-HTP or serotonin itself,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll take the amino acid precursor like tryptophan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying these things as recommendations</p>
<p>for increasing the one sense of pleasure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m describing them because of what they do</p>
<p>generally falls into two categories.</p>
<p>The first category is to raise the foundation</p>
<p>what we call the tonic level of dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p>So if levels of serotonin and dopamine are too low,</p>
<p>it becomes almost impossible to experience pleasure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a so-called ahedonia.</p>
<p>This is also described as depression,</p>
<p>although it needn&rsquo;t be long-term depression.</p>
<p>So certain drugs like antidepressants,</p>
<p>like Welbutrin, buprenorphine, as it&rsquo;s commonly called,</p>
<p>or the so-called SSRIs,</p>
<p>the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, excuse me,</p>
<p>like Prozac, Zoloft and similar,</p>
<p>will increase dopamine and serotonin respectively.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not increasing the peaks in those molecules,</p>
<p>what we call the acute release of those molecules.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re raising</p>
<p>the overall levels of those molecules.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re raising the sort of foundation</p>
<p>or the tide, if you will.</p>
<p>Think about it as your mood or your pleasure rather</p>
<p>as like a boat, and if it&rsquo;s on the shore</p>
<p>and it can&rsquo;t get out to sea unless that tide is high enough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the way to think</p>
<p>about these tonic levels of dopamine and serotonin.</p>
<p>Now, most of us fortunately do not have problems</p>
<p>with our baseline or our tonic levels</p>
<p>of dopamine and serotonin release.</p>
<p>Things like PEA in that case will cause a slight increase</p>
<p>in that tide and make the ability of certain experiences</p>
<p>to increase dopamine further more available.</p>
<p>What we call this in neuroscience is so-called gain control.</p>
<p>It can kind of turn up the volume,</p>
<p>bring us closer to the threshold</p>
<p>to activate certain circuits.</p>
<p>And this is really what we mean</p>
<p>when we say a neuromodulator, okay?</p>
<p>This is why when you are very happy about something,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re out with your friends,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really excited, you know,</p>
<p>maybe depending on where you live</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on in your area of the world right now,</p>
<p>like, you know, like I have a niece</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s been locked up in quarantine</p>
<p>for a long time recently because it was deemed safe.</p>
<p>She got to go to summer camp.</p>
<p>I have never seen that kid so happy to spend,</p>
<p>excuse me, spend time with her friends.</p>
<p>She was so excited and it was really amazing</p>
<p>to see how excited she was.</p>
<p>Her baseline levels of dopamine were clearly up,</p>
<p>so much so that when she saw her friends,</p>
<p>she literally started squealing, okay?</p>
<p>They were squealing, she was squealing,</p>
<p>everyone was squealing.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t squealing, I would admit it if I was squealing.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t squealing, but it was such a delight to see,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure that made my dopamine levels go up,</p>
<p>which was she was just so excited,</p>
<p>such that anything and everything</p>
<p>felt like an exciting stimulus.</p>
<p>This is pleasure, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to write off the experience</p>
<p>from a neurobiological reductionist standpoint,</p>
<p>quite the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really beautiful to see, again, this principle</p>
<p>that different experiences and the experience of pleasure</p>
<p>from different things,</p>
<p>seeing your friends for the first time,</p>
<p>a summer camp for a kid,</p>
<p>whatever it might happen to be,</p>
<p>use the same currency, dopamine,</p>
<p>use the same currency, serotonin.</p>
<p>And this is a principle that I hope</p>
<p>in listening to this podcast</p>
<p>and even some of its repetitive features</p>
<p>from one episode to the next,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that those will start to embed in your mind</p>
<p>that the brain and body use these common currencies</p>
<p>for different experiences.</p>
<p>So yes, if your dopamine and serotonin,</p>
<p>or I should say if your dopamine</p>
<p>and or serotonin levels are too low,</p>
<p>it will be very hard to achieve pleasure,</p>
<p>to experience physical pleasure</p>
<p>or emotional pleasure of any kind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why treatments of the sort</p>
<p>that I described a minute ago might be right for you.</p>
<p>Obviously we can&rsquo;t determine if they&rsquo;re right for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why they have side effects.</p>
<p>If you artificially increase these molecules</p>
<p>that are associated with pleasure,</p>
<p>oftentimes you get a lack of motivation</p>
<p>to go seek things like food.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t get much interest in food</p>
<p>because why should they</p>
<p>if their serotonin levels are already up?</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s a ton of individual variation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say that these antidepressants</p>
<p>are always bad.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ve saved lives.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve saved millions of lives.</p>
<p>Sometimes people have side effects</p>
<p>that make them not the right choice.</p>
<p>So it has to be determined for the individual.</p>
<p>Things like PEA are a more subtle effect.</p>
<p>I should mention PEA supplementation</p>
<p>is something that a number of people use,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very short-lived</p>
<p>because of the half-life of this molecule is very brief.</p>
<p>The effect only lasts about 20 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Things like L-Dopa, mucunipurines,</p>
<p>lead to longer baseline increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>But remember, anytime you raise a baseline,</p>
<p>you reduce the so-called signal to noise.</p>
<p>What it means is if you&rsquo;re riding around</p>
<p>at really high dopamine,</p>
<p>at first, everything will start to seem exciting,</p>
<p>like my niece and seeing her friends for the first time,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>But then what will happen</p>
<p>is when your dopamine levels return to more normal levels,</p>
<p>it will take a much greater dopamine increase,</p>
<p>a much bigger event, more novel, more exciting,</p>
<p>in order to achieve the sense</p>
<p>that what you&rsquo;re experiencing is pleasureful.</p>
<p>And this is because of the relationship</p>
<p>between pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>Now, in a future episode,</p>
<p>we are going to go deep into this relationship</p>
<p>between pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>But just briefly, as a precursor to that,</p>
<p>and because it&rsquo;s relevant to the conversation</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been having,</p>
<p>you might want to be wary of any experience,</p>
<p>any experience, no matter how it arrives,</p>
<p>chemical, physical, emotional, or some combination,</p>
<p>you might want to be wary of letting your dopamine</p>
<p>go too high, and certainly you want to be wary</p>
<p>of it going too low,</p>
<p>because of the way that these circuits adjust.</p>
<p>Basically, every time that the pleasure system</p>
<p>is kicked in in high gear,</p>
<p>an absolutely spectacular event,</p>
<p>you cannot be more ecstatic.</p>
<p>There is a mirror symmetric activation of the pain system.</p>
<p>And this might seem like an evil curse of biology,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>This is actually a way to protect this whole system</p>
<p>of reward and motivation that I talked about</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>It might sound great to just ingest substances</p>
<p>or engage in behaviors where it&rsquo;s just dopamine,</p>
<p>dopamine, dopamine, and just constantly be motivated,</p>
<p>but the system will eventually crash.</p>
<p>And so what happens is when you have a big increase</p>
<p>in dopamine, you also will get a big increase</p>
<p>in the circuits that underlie our sense of disappointment</p>
<p>and readjusting the balance.</p>
<p>And with repeated exposure to high levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>not naturally occurring, wonderful events,</p>
<p>but really high chemically induced peaks in dopamine,</p>
<p>high magnitude, chemically induced peaks in dopamine,</p>
<p>what happens is those peaks in dopamine start to go down</p>
<p>and down and down in response to the same,</p>
<p>what ought to be incredible experience.</p>
<p>We start to what&rsquo;s called habituate or attenuate,</p>
<p>and yet the pain increases in size.</p>
<p>And this has a preservative function in keeping us safe,</p>
<p>believe it or not.</p>
<p>But what I just described is actually the basis of most,</p>
<p>if not all forms of addiction,</p>
<p>something that we will deal with</p>
<p>in a future episode in depth.</p>
<p>So what should you think about all this?</p>
<p>How should you think about pleasure</p>
<p>and how should you think about pain?</p>
<p>What is too much pleasure?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s going to differ from person to person,</p>
<p>but to the extent that one can access pleasure repeatedly</p>
<p>over time, ideally without chemical augmentation,</p>
<p>certainly not excessive chemical augmentation,</p>
<p>that means that this pleasure system is tuned up well</p>
<p>and can continue to experience pleasure.</p>
<p>However, if you find yourself engaging</p>
<p>in the same behavior over and over again,</p>
<p>but achieving less and less pleasure from it,</p>
<p>chances are you want to adjust down</p>
<p>how often you engage in that behavior</p>
<p>and or adjust down your expectation of reward</p>
<p>every time you engage in that behavior.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>I talked about how dopamine will allow us</p>
<p>to get into bouts of hard work.</p>
<p>We will work very hard to pursue a reward.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what dopamine does.</p>
<p>And then when the reward comes,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t increase our dopamine.</p>
<p>In fact, our dopamine levels go down.</p>
<p>One of the key things that we can all do</p>
<p>to adjust our ability to experience pleasure</p>
<p>is to engage in that intermittent reward schedule.</p>
<p>You can either adjust down the peak in dopamine,</p>
<p>meaning not let yourself ever get too happy,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s no fun, right?</p>
<p>Life is about occasionally achieving</p>
<p>or experiencing ecstasy,</p>
<p>but every once in a while, remove the reward.</p>
<p>And of course, I don&rsquo;t mean ecstasy the drug.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a separate matter.</p>
<p>The MDMA trials are a separate matter.</p>
<p>Very interesting, I want to be clear.</p>
<p>I meant psychological and physical ecstasy</p>
<p>of the natural sort.</p>
<p>I have immense interest in what&rsquo;s going on in the MDMA trials</p>
<p>but just for clarity purposes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a separate topic that we will cover</p>
<p>in an episode, excuse me, very soon.</p>
<p>So how do you adjust this dopamine system?</p>
<p>Well, every once in a while at random,</p>
<p>not in a predictable way, you remove the reward</p>
<p>and that will keep you and your dopamine system</p>
<p>tuned up in the proper ways.</p>
<p>The gain of the dopamine system, as we say,</p>
<p>will be adjusted so that you can continue</p>
<p>to experience dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>when you actually get the reward.</p>
<p>This can be translated into a huge number</p>
<p>of different domains, but I want to give some examples</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sure that many of you are asking,</p>
<p>wait, what does this actually mean?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a student</p>
<p>or this could be a student in academia</p>
<p>or this could be a student of a physical practice.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, when you do something really well,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s even just showing up to the practice</p>
<p>rather than pat yourself on the back,</p>
<p>just tell yourself, yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the minimum that&rsquo;s expected of me.</p>
<p>When everyone&rsquo;s excited about something that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re excited about it,</p>
<p>try and adjust down your excitement a little bit.</p>
<p>I know this might seem counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re preserving the ability</p>
<p>to experience excitement in a variety of contexts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you get a big monetary award.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s great, I&rsquo;m happy for you, and that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>However, you should be a little bit wary</p>
<p>if you care about your dopamine system</p>
<p>and you care about your ability</p>
<p>to get subsequent monetary rewards,</p>
<p>excuse me, awards, rewards, doesn&rsquo;t matter which,</p>
<p>through effort, if you want to be able</p>
<p>to maintain the ability to exert effort,</p>
<p>well, then you probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to run out</p>
<p>and immediately buy something with that monetary reward.</p>
<p>In other words, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to layer on</p>
<p>more dopamine release, okay?</p>
<p>You might, but you might not, you might skip it.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ll find then is that your motivation</p>
<p>is essentially infinite.</p>
<p>This is what I described at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s because dopamine is this currency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, these days you hear a lot about Bitcoin</p>
<p>and Ethereum and Dogecoin and US dollars and euros</p>
<p>and all this other stuff,</p>
<p>but the currency that you use in your body</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter what external currency those are.</p>
<p>In fact, as you watch the value of different currencies</p>
<p>go up, whether or not it&rsquo;s cryptocurrency</p>
<p>or standard currency, the value is actually reflective</p>
<p>of the dopamine that exists inside of people, right?</p>
<p>So all the excitement about a particular currency,</p>
<p>crypto or otherwise, is really just dopamine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the currency that we all use.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no negotiating that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that we&rsquo;re built.</p>
<p>Now, to give yet other examples,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re teaching other people how to do something</p>
<p>and they do something exceptionally well.</p>
<p>If you reward them every single time,</p>
<p>and in particular, if you reward them with something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even greater than the experience of what they did,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say kids win a soccer game and they&rsquo;re ecstatic,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re jumping all over the place, they&rsquo;re super excited,</p>
<p>and you reward them with an even bigger experience,</p>
<p>a celebration, you are actually inhibiting their ability</p>
<p>to perform the same set of activities</p>
<p>that led them to the win if,</p>
<p>and I really want to underscore if,</p>
<p>you reward them every time.</p>
<p>Of course, we should reward kids and each other</p>
<p>and ourselves for our accomplishments,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to do it every time.</p>
<p>And sure, there will be some disappointment</p>
<p>from suddenly removing the reward that you expected,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s exactly the point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what keeps these circuits tuned up properly.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s the other form of pleasure,</p>
<p>which is the more immediate visceral</p>
<p>or sensory experience of pleasure.</p>
<p>This is distinct from goals and goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the immediate experience.</p>
<p>This is more of the serotonergic system.</p>
<p>There are other systems involved too,</p>
<p>but this is also the system that draws out</p>
<p>those endogenous opioids from a particular structure.</p>
<p>We have a structure in the back of our brain called PAG,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the periaqueductal gray area.</p>
<p>Very interesting brain area that is associated with pain,</p>
<p>but also with pleasure because under certain conditions,</p>
<p>it deploys endogenous opioids</p>
<p>and gives us a kind of blissed out feeling.</p>
<p>Okay, this is not like the opioids</p>
<p>of the opioid epidemic sort that people take</p>
<p>and unfortunately have led to tremendous amounts</p>
<p>of suffering and abuse.</p>
<p>These are endogenously released opioids.</p>
<p>These are the kind of opioids that come out</p>
<p>from long distance bouts of physical exercise and running.</p>
<p>These are the opioids that are deployed</p>
<p>in response to giving birth</p>
<p>and overcoming the tremendous pain of childbirth.</p>
<p>So PAG is very contextual</p>
<p>and there are a few types of stimuli,</p>
<p>or I should say events in life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really showing my nerdy side.</p>
<p>There are a few types of stimuli,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about experiences,</p>
<p>that evoke endogenous opioid release from PAG.</p>
<p>One is sexual activity.</p>
<p>Sexual activity can increase pain threshold.</p>
<p>And here I am not suggesting</p>
<p>or getting involved in anyone&rsquo;s particular proclivities</p>
<p>or personal experiences.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome to editorialize this however you like.</p>
<p>However, what I&rsquo;m talking about are animal data</p>
<p>and yes, human data as well,</p>
<p>that show that pain thresholds are increased</p>
<p>anytime PAG is activated</p>
<p>because of the release of these endogenous opioids.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the immediate experience</p>
<p>of whether or not a particular form of touch</p>
<p>is pleasurable or not.</p>
<p>And there, there&rsquo;s some very interesting biology</p>
<p>that relates to really how those little wires</p>
<p>from those DRGs innervate our skin.</p>
<p>Work studies, I should say,</p>
<p>done by David Ginty&rsquo;s lab at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>The Ginty lab has spent years</p>
<p>working on the somatosensory system, the touch system,</p>
<p>has identified a particular category of neurons</p>
<p>that innervate the skin.</p>
<p>And then those neurons, of course,</p>
<p>send that information up to the brain too.</p>
<p>And they actually respond to direction of touch.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might be more sensitive to this than others,</p>
<p>but it turns out that certain hairs</p>
<p>like to be deflected one way versus another.</p>
<p>Whether or not you like cats or not,</p>
<p>you can do this experiment.</p>
<p>You can pet a cat in the direction that their fur lies.</p>
<p>So it lies down in a particular direction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;s actually a gene</p>
<p>that dictates that the hairs lie down</p>
<p>in a particular direction.</p>
<p>And if you pet them in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cooperating with that direction,</p>
<p>so not pushing the hairs up,</p>
<p>but rather stroking the hairs on the back of the cat,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll notice is they often like that.</p>
<p>Not all cats, some cats are pretty grouchy,</p>
<p>but if you stroke their hair, they will often purr,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll often push into you.</p>
<p>If you were to stroke their hair in the opposite direction,</p>
<p>pushing the hairs up against the direction</p>
<p>that they want to lie down, cats do not like that.</p>
<p>And it turns out people don&rsquo;t like that either.</p>
<p>Some people do like to have their hair pushed</p>
<p>in a direction against the direction</p>
<p>in which it wants to lay down,</p>
<p>but there is more typically a response</p>
<p>of feeling like it&rsquo;s pleasurable for instance,</p>
<p>when someone brushes or combs their hair</p>
<p>in the direction that it wants to lay down.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the way in which these neurons</p>
<p>that innervate these hairs sends information</p>
<p>up to the brain, bifurcates actually,</p>
<p>it splits into brain centers that evoke a sense of pleasure</p>
<p>or a sense of not pleasure, it&rsquo;s not necessarily pain.</p>
<p>So you might find that certain people are very particular.</p>
<p>They like to be touched in a certain way, but not others.</p>
<p>You might be one of those people.</p>
<p>And areas of our skin that have high density of receptors</p>
<p>are very, very sensitive in a real way,</p>
<p>in a real sense of the word to patterns of touch</p>
<p>and whether or not a touch is too firm or too light.</p>
<p>And that will be modulated by overall levels of arousal.</p>
<p>And when I talk about arousal,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m talking about is how alert or how sleepy we are.</p>
<p>It is impossible to experience pain</p>
<p>when we are deep in sleep.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean sleeping like of the typical night sort,</p>
<p>I mean of the anesthesia sort.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the purpose of anesthesia,</p>
<p>to bring the brain and body into a deep plane of rest,</p>
<p>very deep in fact.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very hard, if not impossible to achieve</p>
<p>or experience pleasure</p>
<p>when we are in a very low state of arousal as well.</p>
<p>When we are in heightened states of arousal,</p>
<p>we can achieve pain, we can experience pain</p>
<p>and we can experience pleasure, okay?</p>
<p>And under those heightened states of arousal,</p>
<p>we are more sensitive literally,</p>
<p>the passage of electrical signals</p>
<p>from those locations on the body</p>
<p>that have heightened degrees or higher degrees,</p>
<p>I should say of receptors, use your imagination.</p>
<p>They include the lips, the face, the feet and the genitals</p>
<p>and nearby areas, literally nearby areas.</p>
<p>Under conditions of high arousal, two things happen.</p>
<p>The ability to achieve or experience pleasure</p>
<p>at those locations goes up</p>
<p>and our tolerance and our threshold for pain also goes up.</p>
<p>So the principle here is that as our levels of arousal,</p>
<p>that foundation of arousal goes up or down,</p>
<p>so too goes up and down our ability</p>
<p>to achieve pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>And so these two extremes of being deep within anesthesia</p>
<p>or another extreme is asleep</p>
<p>or in heightened levels of arousal,</p>
<p>our ability to achieve pleasure and pain</p>
<p>are going to scale according to those.</p>
<p>And this is why, and I&rsquo;m certainly not suggesting this,</p>
<p>but this is why some people will take stimulants</p>
<p>or drugs of abuse that increase arousal</p>
<p>in order to achieve pleasure of other kinds.</p>
<p>The problem is, is that those drugs</p>
<p>and particular things like cocaine and methamphetamine</p>
<p>and amphetamine become their own form of reinforcement,</p>
<p>so much so that the person doesn&rsquo;t seek out</p>
<p>any other form of excitement or arousal, okay?</p>
<p>So today we weren&rsquo;t talking about addiction.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t necessarily talking about motivation,</p>
<p>but we touched on those topics</p>
<p>as sort of a precursor of what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p>We talked about the pathways in the skin and in the brain</p>
<p>and elsewhere in the body</p>
<p>that control our sense of pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>We described a number of different tools</p>
<p>ranging from hypnosis to different supplements</p>
<p>to electroacupuncture and various other tools</p>
<p>that one could use to modulate</p>
<p>your sense of pleasure or pain.</p>
<p>And of course, in thinking about pleasure,</p>
<p>we have to think about the dopamine system</p>
<p>and the serotonin system</p>
<p>and some of the related chemical systems.</p>
<p>I realized that today&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>had a lot of scientific details.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve timestamped everything for you</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t have to digest it all at once, of course.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect that everyone would be able to understand</p>
<p>all these details all at once.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more important really</p>
<p>is to understand the general principles</p>
<p>of how something like pleasure and pain work,</p>
<p>how they interact and the various cells and systems</p>
<p>within the brain and body that allow them to occur</p>
<p>and that modulate or change their ability to occur.</p>
<p>And of course, your subjective experience</p>
<p>of pleasure or pain.</p>
<p>So I do hope that this was on whole</p>
<p>more pleasurable than painful for you.</p>
