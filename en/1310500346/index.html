    <p>The following is a conversation with Todd Howard, one of the greatest video game designers</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>He has led the development of the Fallout series and the Elder Scrolls series, including</p>
<p>Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and the future Elder Scrolls VI, and a totally</p>
<p>new world in an upcoming game called Starfield.</p>
<p>Many of these have won Game of the Year awards and have been some of the most celebrated</p>
<p>and impactful games ever made.</p>
<p>To me, Skyrim is quite possibly the greatest game ever.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description, it&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Shopify for e-commerce, Asleep for napping, Inside Tracker for bio-monitoring,</p>
<p>and Element for salty greatness.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, on to the full ad reads, never any ads in the middle, I hate those.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting, but if you skip them, please still check out the sponsors,</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Shopify, a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere,</p>
<p>anything, whatever they enjoy making, whatever they enjoy selling, it makes it easy to reach</p>
<p>a huge audience.</p>
<p>The whole thing looks super sexy, it&rsquo;s a great looking online store, and it allows you to</p>
<p>take your idea, convert it into a product, and hopefully spread joy to other people who</p>
<p>want to buy that product.</p>
<p>And it gives you tools to do day-to-day management of that selling of the product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked a bunch of times to do merch, man, there&rsquo;s so much cool stuff, because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a fan of merch myself, like when I&rsquo;m a fan, I&rsquo;m a fan of a lot of podcasts, a lot of shows,</p>
<p>a lot of people, I just like wearing things that I&rsquo;m a fan of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of cool celebration of a beautiful thing, I just in general like celebrating</p>
<p>others and merch is one of the ways to do that.</p>

<p>This episode is also brought to you by 8sleep and its new Pod 3 mattress.</p>
<p>There are very few things in life I enjoy as much as a nap, I am ultra caffeinated at</p>
<p>the moment, but shortly, or rather shortly into the past, whatever the expression for</p>
<p>that is, English is in fact my second language, I took a nap recently I guess, shortly into</p>
<p>the past, into the recent past I took a nap that was about 20 minutes, I want to say,</p>
<p>and I woke up completely refreshed.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s probably really good science on that, of just napping.</p>
<p>Is there a book, not on sleep, but specifically on napping, on mastering napping, master napper?</p>
<p>If there isn&rsquo;t a book I&rsquo;m going to write one, it will forever be remembered, and it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>a short one.</p>
<p>I really enjoy napping, and my favorite thing to nap on is an 8sleep bed because it cools</p>
<p>it down with a warm blanket and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s heaven.</p>
<p>Check it out and get special holiday savings of up to $400 when you go to 8sleep.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by InsideTracker, a service I use to track biological data that</p>
<p>comes from my own body and gives me wisdom that only large scale raw data can provide.</p>
<p>The signal that&rsquo;s pulled off from that data using machine learning algorithms, and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about blood data, DNA data, fitness tracker data, all kinds of data, I&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>going to a Neuralink event very shortly, and that event is about extracting data from</p>
<p>your mind.</p>
<p>Long-term vision of brain-computer interfaces, two-way communication between computers, maybe</p>
<p>artificial intelligence-enhanced computers, and the human mind.</p>
<p>That data is extremely powerful to tell you what&rsquo;s going on in your mind and your body,</p>
<p>and I think InsideTracker is at the cutting edge of what can actually lead to positive</p>
<p>lifestyle changes using that data coming from the person, personalized to that person.</p>
<p>All right, get $200 off InsideTracker&rsquo;s Ultimate Plan, or 34% off the entire store when you</p>
<p>go to InsideTracker.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Element Electrolyte Drink Mix, spelled L-M-N-T.</p>
<p>I drink a lot of Element.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some guest that was on recently, it might have been Grimes or Liv, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure exactly, but they said they&rsquo;re a huge fan of Element.</p>
<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>But they said, we had like a debate about favorite flavors and what to drink and how</p>
<p>much to drink, and they discovered that I drink way too much Element, from their perspective.</p>
<p>From my perspective, never enough.</p>
<p>So it makes me feel great in terms of diet.</p>
<p>It makes sure that I get enough hydration, it makes water taste great.</p>
<p>For all the crazy exercise and mental and physical stuff I do, diet stuff I do, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just really important to make sure your electrolytes are done correctly.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Todd Howard.</p>
<p>Is it possible that we are currently living inside a video game that the future you designed?</p>
<p>Can you give hints as to how one would escape if this was a video game?</p>
<p>How can a video game character escape to outside the video game?</p>
<p>Are these things you don&rsquo;t consider when you design the game?</p>
<p>Actually we do.</p>
<p>Because in the kind of games that we make, we want it to be as open as possible.</p>
<p>So when you start a game, you&rsquo;re always testing it.</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>What would the game allow me to do?</p>
<p>And you check everything.</p>
<p>You try to pick up the mugs.</p>
<p>You try every door.</p>
<p>You collide with everything.</p>
<p>Like, hey, what are the rules of this world?</p>
<p>We try to do games where we say yes as much as possible.</p>
<p>That leads to some level of chaos.</p>
<p>But if you were stuck in a video game, you would try everything.</p>
<p>And usually, you&rsquo;re going to find a door or a space where the designers didn&rsquo;t anticipate</p>
<p>you piling all those crates up and getting over a wall that they didn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a designed doorway out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an accidental, unintended doorway out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a happy bug.</p>
<p>You could like Truman&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>Just get in the ocean and go till it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Just keep going.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But the more realistic the game becomes, the harder it is to find that door.</p>
<p>The bigger the world.</p>
<p>The bigger the open world.</p>
<p>And then as we do it, we learn they&rsquo;re going to find a way.</p>
<p>So just don&rsquo;t try to pen them in.</p>
<p>Usually, we leave like this developer test cell area in the game that we don&rsquo;t anticipate</p>
<p>anyone will find.</p>
<p>And they ultimately find it.</p>
<p>It usually has crates of all the weapons in the game and things like that.</p>
<p>The little hints you drop now will just drive people mad, which is something I enjoy deeply.</p>
<p>So Skyrim NPCs have, at times, hilarious dialogue.</p>
<p>What does it take to build a good NPC dialogue?</p>
<p>The main thing is to make them reactive.</p>
<p>A lot of times when you write characters for movies or things like that, you want to make</p>
<p>that character interesting for themselves, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their story?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some characters like that that the player definitely cares about.</p>
<p>But the best characters are the ones that react to you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll find a lot of people love our guards, and the guards are written almost purely to</p>
<p>be reactive.</p>
<p>Hey, nice tie.</p>
<p>I like your jacket.</p>
<p>Do this.</p>
<p>Cool watch.</p>
<p>Hey, what&rsquo;d you do?</p>
<p>And so that, hey, you&rsquo;re the man as you walk by, that makes them interesting.</p>
<p>Or the way they react to something that you do.</p>
<p>Lydia in Skyrim, who everybody loves, I&rsquo;m sworn to carry your burdens, that&rsquo;s a generic</p>
<p>line that all of the house carls have.</p>
<p>And it just kind of lands when she says it.</p>
<p>Why does it land?</p>
<p>And did you anticipate it would land?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a slight snarkiness in that particular read of it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re asking her to do something, and she&rsquo;s reacting to you.</p>
<p>What about the trade-off between maybe the randomness and the scripted nature of the</p>
<p>dialogue?</p>
<p>Like, is there any room for randomness of the dialogue tree?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>We tend to write them in stacks with, you know, it&rsquo;s a very small, think of it as a</p>
<p>small state machine that just says, okay, this is what&rsquo;s happening, here&rsquo;s a random</p>
<p>list of things I could say to that.</p>
<p>And then some of that plays out in ways you don&rsquo;t anticipate.</p>
<p>But we look at the things.</p>
<p>What are the players doing that we could have the characters respond to that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>expect?</p>
<p>You know, jumping on tables, or stealing stuff, or, you know, sneaking in in the middle of</p>
<p>the night, or those kind of things.</p>
<p>The more that we can do, the more reactive and interesting the characters appear.</p>
<p>And these state machines, how big are these things?</p>
<p>Are these individual to the individual characters?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just fascinating how you design state machines.</p>
<p>Is it just a giant database?</p>
<p>I would think of the AI as one big one, yeah, for sort of everybody.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an AI.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a manager for all the people.</p>
<p>And one of the things that makes what we do particularly unique is, and this is a tradeoff</p>
<p>for what people are seeing, because a lot of it&rsquo;s not on the screen, but we&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>cycles to run this, which is, we&rsquo;re thinking about everybody in the whole world all the</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>The ones that are further away at a much less tick rate, they go into low, but we know if</p>
<p>they want to walk across the world, and we&rsquo;re running every quest at the same time.</p>
<p>Whereas in other open world games, you start an activity, the rest of the world&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to shut down so that they can really make that as impactful.</p>
<p>I really prefer that the rest of it&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a simulation that we&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>So when those things collide, that&rsquo;s where it gets the most interesting.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re running all of those people and understanding where they want to go and their</p>
<p>cycles and what they want to do.</p>
<p>And the ones that are closer to you, we just update a lot more, is one way to think about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that people had, they were wondering about to what degree it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to run the world without you.</p>
<p>So there is a feeling to role-playing games that you&rsquo;re the central, you&rsquo;re at the center</p>
<p>of the world and the whole world rotates around you, as it does in normal life.</p>
<p>Like when we walk around, there&rsquo;s a, when you forget yourself, you start to take yourself</p>
<p>very seriously.</p>
<p>Like you are the center of the world.</p>
<p>You forget that there&rsquo;s 8 billion people on earth and you forget that they have lives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a sobering realization that they all have really interesting life stories</p>
<p>and they have their worries, they suffer in different complicated ways.</p>
<p>And yet when you play a role-playing game, there&rsquo;s a, I mean, both computationally and</p>
<p>from a storytelling perspective, you wonder if the world goes on without you.</p>
<p>Like if you come back, if you take a break and you come back, is there still a bustling</p>
<p>town that now has a history since you have last visited?</p>
<p>So to what degree can you create a world that goes on without you or goes on at the same</p>
<p>time as you do your thing, whatever the heck you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t prioritize the stuff you can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more like an amusement park.</p>
<p>If you study like the design or level designers did this, how do they build Disney world in</p>
<p>these places?</p>
<p>So it still exists for you, the player.</p>
<p>So it is fairly, you know, when you&rsquo;re going to come in, this is what you&rsquo;re going to see.</p>
<p>The shops are in the front.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just for us to make it far more believable and get some more emergent behavior that not</p>
<p>just make that sort of the verisimilitude of what you&rsquo;re in for that moment, but you</p>
<p>buy it all.</p>
<p>I always say like, you know, we got to do the little things so that you buy the reality</p>
<p>of the virtual world you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>So we want to do something crazy, you know, when a dragon lands or a death law comes out</p>
<p>of the wasteland or those kinds of things that you, it has the impact to you as the</p>
<p>viewer that it would to the people in the world.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But still you&rsquo;re simulating stuff that&rsquo;s close to you.</p>
<p>It is a bit of a simulation going on.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so that creates some interesting dynamics then.</p>
<p>And the stuff that we&rsquo;re looking at in the future, you know, our plan is to push that</p>
<p>even more, to think about how these things exist in the world first.</p>
<p>And we do some of this, but even more so in the future to say, how do these things exist?</p>
<p>Take like a faction in the world.</p>
<p>What is their role in the world?</p>
<p>As opposed to just their role is for the player to join it, go through a bunch of quests and</p>
<p>become the head of the faction, you know, think a little bit deeper about the simulation</p>
<p>and what would the mages guild be doing in a fantasy world or the fighters guild be doing</p>
<p>in a fantasy world versus just sign up, do quests, get gold.</p>
<p>And so that when you show up to that mages guild, it&rsquo;s a bustling guild full of stuff</p>
<p>going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that it&rsquo;s bustling is that they feel rooted in it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t feel like a storefront for come here, do quests, get experience.</p>
<p>Is that one of the essential components of randomly generated worlds?</p>
<p>So when I think back to Daggerfall as gigantic world, or when I first played it, I thought</p>
<p>like, I mean, you&rsquo;re just struck by the immensity of it.</p>
<p>The immensity of the possibility.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re young and you look into your future, it&rsquo;s wide open and you can do anything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what Daggerfall felt like.</p>
<p>The openness was gigantic.</p>
<p>And Daggerfall is interesting coming off Arena, where Arena does the same thing, but Daggerfall</p>
<p>in many ways is bigger despite focusing on an area because of how the density of, okay,</p>
<p>this is how much physical game space we&rsquo;ll do for these villages and towns.</p>
<p>And it does feel endless, even though you&rsquo;re looking at a map that has constraints.</p>
<p>And Daggerfall actually was a touchstone for us going into Starfield for how we do</p>
<p>the planets because there&rsquo;s a different kind of gameplay experience when you just wander</p>
<p>outside a city in Daggerfall than follow a quest line and go through, go to this place</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely handcrafted and everything around every corner, we&rsquo;ve kind of placed</p>
<p>like Skyrim.</p>
<p>Starfield&rsquo;s a bit more like Daggerfall and if you wander outside the city, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be generating things and you kind of get used to that game flow, different than we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done before and fun in a different kind of way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about Starfield.</p>
<p>So just for people who don&rsquo;t know, and how dare you for not knowing, but with Daggerfall</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the Elder Scrolls series that started, sort of talking about the big</p>
<p>titles within the series, started with Arena in 94, Daggerfall in 96, I didn&rsquo;t look up</p>
<p>the years before this, this is depressing, or awesome.</p>
<p>So all of these games brought hundreds, probably for some of them thousands of hours of joy</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>So Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t remember Arena being that open world.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s all the provinces.</p>
<p>It follows kind of the same pattern, it just doesn&rsquo;t have all the number of villages and</p>
<p>places that Daggerfall has, while Daggerfall focuses on the Iliac Bay area, Arena does</p>
<p>it all.</p>
<p>It just changes the scale in terms of, you know, one block on the map equals this much</p>
<p>space.</p>
<p>There is something that, I mean, I&rsquo;m speaking to anecdotal experience, but I just remember</p>
<p>it feeling wide open, Daggerfall.</p>
<p>It definitely was, yes.</p>
<p>In a way Arena didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember, maybe because Arena, it was so cool to have just the role playing</p>
<p>game aspect, you&rsquo;re focused on the items and the character development.</p>
<p>Daggerfall has a lot more depth, particularly in the character system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it introduces, all of the skills and those kind of things.</p>
<p>Arena, it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a game I love, and it&rsquo;s very, very elegant.</p>
<p>If you look at the first one where it&rsquo;s just an XP based system, do this, get XP, level</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Very classic role playing game.</p>
<p>Daggerfall digs deep into who&rsquo;s your character, how you&rsquo;re going to develop it, what are your</p>
<p>skills, there&rsquo;s advantages, there&rsquo;s disadvantages.</p>
<p>And the environment going full 3D from Arena, which is actually like a 2.5D Doom style engine,</p>
<p>that I agree with you, that Daggerfall feels like there&rsquo;s more possibilities when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>playing it.</p>
<p>Were you able to look up to the sky in Daggerfall?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>My memory&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full 3D, yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what full 3D means.</p>
<p>And then you can go outside the city?</p>
<p>You can walk outside the city.</p>
<p>You can do that in Arena too, but it looks more fakie, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all going to be a flat plane.</p>
<p>Here comes things, and then a dungeon entrance is 8-bit.</p>
<p>Here comes a little flat coming at the camera.</p>
<p>So before we go to the end and the middle, so from Starfield to Fallout and the Elder</p>
<p>Scrolls series, let&rsquo;s go to the very beginning.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the origin story?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s even go before then.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the first time you remember the thing that made you fall in love with video games?</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s partly my age coming up with the arcades and playing Space Invaders</p>
<p>at the Pizza Place.</p>
<p>And then Pac-Man really&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting about video games and what Pac-Man did for video games, where it popularized</p>
<p>them in a way that was just insane at the time.</p>
<p>Had a song, had a cartoon, had all of the things.</p>
<p>Nintendo comes along.</p>
<p>So it was always part of&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, I think if you were a kid growing up then, it was such a newness to playing</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>I remember being in fifth grade when the TRS-80 was brought into the classroom and there was</p>
<p>a Star Trek game.</p>
<p>And I was enamored with it and they were going to start teaching some rudimentary programming.</p>
<p>Like, okay, would you like to know how this is made?</p>
<p>And I was hooked.</p>
<p>I was like, I need to figure out how to make this stuff.</p>
<p>And so I was a self-taught programmer and my whole goal was to write my own video games.</p>
<p>And, you know, by sixth, seventh grade, I had written my own much better Star Trek clone,</p>
<p>Apple II.</p>
<p>And I really enjoyed programming on the Apple II then.</p>
<p>And that, I think, was the right level of, like, complexity, you know, at that age where</p>
<p>you could kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>You were always learning, but you could still understand a lot of the problem set for, like,</p>
<p>this is what I want to get on the screen.</p>
<p>And I was also into art.</p>
<p>So I did a lot of art and I did a lot of programming and I was always making games.</p>
<p>That was my hobby from the time I was, you know, 10 or 12.</p>
<p>What was, to you, involved in making games?</p>
<p>Like, how did you think of it?</p>
<p>Was it from a graphics perspective, like what shows up on screen?</p>
<p>Was it how it makes you feel?</p>
<p>Was it about the story?</p>
<p>Was it the text-based stuff and the dialogue and the prompting?</p>
<p>Like, what does it mean to create a video game at that young age to you?</p>
<p>Well, it was a way of experiencing things that I couldn&rsquo;t myself.</p>
<p>So you know, if you&rsquo;re playing Dungeons and Dragons at the time, too, where you really</p>
<p>feel, even pen and paper, these are like, they feel somewhat, in quotes, real to you</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re playing them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very invested in your character and what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And then I love the games, The Wizardry and Ultima, that were able to bring that to a</p>
<p>computer so I could, you know, do it on my own time.</p>
<p>It was very, very real to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d sit in my bedroom and then go to bed and think about it and then, oh no, I have to</p>
<p>go to school.</p>
<p>I want to come home and figure out how to do this problem in the game.</p>
<p>And so whatever I was creating was something that I was excited about at the time.</p>
<p>I made Raiders of the Lost Ark games.</p>
<p>Like with graphics and everything?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it was usually, you know, made a Miami Vice game, made a Gru the Wanderer game,</p>
<p>made a Traveler game.</p>
<p>But every time I was doing it, I wanted to figure out a new method on the Apple II of</p>
<p>pulling it off graphically, whether that was editing character sets to get graphics in</p>
<p>different formats, or how can I enable the secret double high-res mode it had, or just</p>
<p>things like that where it became kind of this limitless, what can I make this do?</p>
<p>And I had some friends who were doing the same thing, and then you get into who can</p>
<p>impress each other.</p>
<p>And I was kind of middle of the pack, I would say.</p>
<p>But again, this was the time where they&rsquo;re bringing computers into the school and the</p>
<p>Apples come into the school and the teachers are learning it because they have to teach</p>
<p>the students.</p>
<p>But then I would say I was part of a group of students that were like way past that.</p>
<p>And it was very much of a self-taught, you know, how do you make this thing dance?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask a strange question.</p>
<p>So at that time, a lot of people consider you one of, if not the greatest game designer</p>
<p>creator of all time.</p>
<p>You were middle of the pack then.</p>
<p>Did you have a sense that this would be your life and you would also be creating, you know,</p>
<p>the greatest games ever?</p>
<p>Not in the slightest.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think anybody&hellip;</p>
<p>But I was very much like that was my dream at that age.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s a job?</p>
<p>And as I got older, I was really going through college and even the computer classes then</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t where I wanted them to be, so I was still kind of doing my own stuff.</p>
<p>And I ended up getting a business degree and then interviewing for some jobs, like finance</p>
<p>jobs.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I should do this to make money and I can keep doing this on the side.</p>
<p>And I remember I actually got to like the final level of like this corporate finance</p>
<p>job at Circuit City and they turned me down.</p>
<p>And I was like, fuck them, I&rsquo;m just going to go make video games.</p>
<p>So thank you, Circuit City.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember Circuit City.</p>
<p>I think they went bankrupt, actually.</p>
<p>Well, they were based in Richmond.</p>
<p>I was going to school close to there.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the origin story of you joining Bethesda Softworks at the time?</p>
<p>So I had gotten Wayne Gretzky Hockey 3 for Christmas from my girlfriend at the time who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now my wife.</p>
<p>I was in college and I noticed that it was, you know, in Rockville, Maryland.</p>
<p>And oh, that&rsquo;s on my way home over Christmas break back to William &amp; Mary where I went</p>
<p>to college.</p>
<p>And I was at this point committed, like, this is what I want to do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to drive by and knock on the door, which is what I did.</p>
<p>So I drove by and knocked on the doors, Martin Luther King Day, 93.</p>
<p>And someone came out and met me and said, well, maybe, and I said, well, I&rsquo;m in college.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about when I&rsquo;m out of school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay, well, contact us then.</p>
<p>And I will say I was, I would contact them every once in a while.</p>
<p>I did work for a small software company right out of school down in that area of Williamsburg</p>
<p>and still would contact Bethesda.</p>
<p>Arena had just come out.</p>
<p>So then we&rsquo;re in 94.</p>
<p>Arena had just come out and I loved it.</p>
<p>So I was into sports games.</p>
<p>I like the hockey stuff.</p>
<p>They were doing a basketball.</p>
<p>They did a basketball game.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m just looking at, they did a lot of, they did like six sports games, six, Bethesda</p>
<p>had at least 10 games, six of them sports games and CAA basketball, hockey league simulator.</p>
<p>So it was really like sports gridiron, which is like the first kind of physics-based football</p>
<p>game at the time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a famous story with Electronic Arts trying to do Madden and then hiring Bethesda</p>
<p>before my time to make Madden because they were struggling.</p>
<p>When I started at Bethesda, I remember the owner had John Madden&rsquo;s Oakland Raiders playbook</p>
<p>in his office.</p>
<p>I was like, ooh, can I see that?</p>
<p>And I love sports, right?</p>
<p>So I still play Madden to this day.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an alternate reality where-</p>
<p>I made sports games?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>This blew my mind.</p>
<p>I wanted to make like the ultimate college football game.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s always like, you know, it&rsquo;s like music.</p>
<p>You probably listen to lots of type of music.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t play every time.</p>
<p>But I think of open worlds as fundamentally different.</p>
<p>No, like source of happiness, entertainments, storytelling, world, gaming than Madden.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just because I love both.</p>
<p>I love both worlds, but-</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re two totally different experiences.</p>
<p>Just like when you might watch a movie, you might be in the mood for Lord of the Rings</p>
<p>one day and then you want some other, I don&rsquo;t know, competitive show or game show or something</p>
<p>like that.</p>
<p>Or watch football on TV, right?</p>
<p>You watch football on TV.</p>
<p>And then I want to watch, get really into Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>So I think all those things have validity.</p>
<p>And actually one of the first things I worked on when I started at Bethesda was NCAA basketball,</p>
<p>Road to the Final Four 2.</p>
<p>So that was kind of an external project, was came in like, hey, you know sports, get this</p>
<p>game done.</p>
<p>And then went on to-</p>
<p>But they were doing everything I loved.</p>
<p>It was like, this is where I have to work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing like the Terminator science fiction stuff.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re doing these open world role playing games.</p>
<p>Like, I love that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing sports.</p>
<p>Like this, I have to work here.</p>
<p>So I started there and-</p>
<p>And Arena, you loved.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So when I came in, it had just come out and they were doing the CD-ROM version.</p>
<p>So CD-ROMs aren&rsquo;t even out yet.</p>
<p>Oh, it used to be floppy disks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably when, what was Arena?</p>
<p>We would burn them in the basement.</p>
<p>We had the disk replicators.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So Arena was not released on floppy.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s six floppy disks.</p>
<p>Six floppy disks.</p>
<p>Maybe it was eight.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But in those days, the number of floppy disks was very, very important to what the money</p>
<p>you were making.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you want to do a big, huge game, like, well, that&rsquo;s just too many disks.</p>
<p>So the CD-ROM became this jumping off point for the whole industry where, oh, it&rsquo;s unlimited</p>
<p>data.</p>
<p>By the way, I played Arena, so that was, of course, attained legally, as one does.</p>
<p>Alternate means?</p>
<p>By alternate means.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>On floppy disks.</p>
<p>And that was such an incredible, as you probably have seen, interacting with a large number</p>
<p>of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a world that you escape to in the way, like, your favorite book, like, Lord of the</p>
<p>Rings, it was just, it was unlike anything else.</p>
<p>It was incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably, I mean, of course, as people say, the first game you play is the one that</p>
<p>really sentimentally means the most to you.</p>
<p>I think the first role-playing game I played, and it was just, changed everything.</p>
<p>Was Arena?</p>
<p>It was Arena, yeah.</p>
<p>I think Daggerfall is what I really, kind of, really played, especially because, like</p>
<p>you said, the character development was really rich, but just, like, that you can be, feel</p>
<p>like you travel to this whole other world that&rsquo;s less about entertainment, like a shooting</p>
<p>game.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It felt like it&rsquo;s a world, like, you&rsquo;re literally there.</p>
<p>You can travel there.</p>
<p>You can live there.</p>
<p>You actually feel like that person versus, like, a Pac-Man, like an arcade, fun, entertaining</p>
<p>adventure game.</p>
<p>So you joined, you made it.</p>
<p>What did you work on first there?</p>
<p>I worked, well, everyone did a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>I worked on the basketball game, really just to get it out the door, and Terminator Future</p>
<p>Shock.</p>
<p>So we were doing Future Shock and Daggerfall at the same time.</p>
<p>They were developing a new engine, so it was one of the first 3D engines, the X-Engine.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of guys from Denmark, actually.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a big Danish demo scene in those days on the PC.</p>
<p>And so a bunch of the top programmers there, went, look, this is not big.</p>
<p>This is not a big company.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 20 people in development.</p>
<p>And we were doing both Daggerfall and the new Terminator.</p>
<p>And so Daggerfall was a bit more, again, behind the Terminator game.</p>
<p>So I was one of the main people on the Terminator team.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, things kind of worked out.</p>
<p>I very quickly, I don&rsquo;t know why, like, I quickly became the producer, and I was making</p>
<p>levels and doing all these things, and it was awesome.</p>
<p>And looking back now, I can understand it better, but at the time, I didn&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>it, which is no one quite owned the Terminator license.</p>
<p>It was in like this limbo, legally.</p>
<p>So there was no one to tell us what to, like, no, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>So we would pick apart the movies and, oh, how does he mention the gun he wants and the</p>
<p>wattage of the laser and all these things?</p>
<p>And so Future Shock is a game that I still love today.</p>
<p>It does a lot of things that, if you go back and look at it, we&rsquo;re frankly still doing.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a large, open world, post-apocalyptic, you know, landscape height map with instanced</p>
<p>objects all over it.</p>
<p>And that is still a lot of how we build our worlds.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an instanced object?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, some games, every, you know, wall or building is kind of unique in its</p>
<p>data, whereas we would just build, you know, these little husks of buildings and then place</p>
<p>them all over the place.</p>
<p>So the memory and the way you render it is much more optimal.</p>
<p>So that allows you to build a bigger world, a more open world.</p>
<p>It allows you to build a bigger world much faster and not, you know, not every single</p>
<p>version of that building is in its own unique architecture that is going to take up memory</p>
<p>and processing speed, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re there very much feeling the computational constraints of the system when you&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>these open worlds.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing then.</p>
<p>You see some of it now, but in those times I do feel like every year the technology moved.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s because, same thing, we&rsquo;re like that my age at that time, where every</p>
<p>year somebody was coming up with some new method or some new game system.</p>
<p>And it was every year that innovation, innovation, innovation, and then, you know, 3D acceleration</p>
<p>comes along and then these things come along and then HD comes along.</p>
<p>And it is true that as time goes on, there is visually a diminishing return in terms</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re able to do on the screen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of work that goes into it now because just rendering this cup to the perfect</p>
<p>shine and material and roughness and how does the global illumination off this wall, it</p>
<p>gets a ton of work.</p>
<p>But you can pretty much do what you want now if you want to put the time in.</p>
<p>Whereas then, okay, you can&rsquo;t do everything you want.</p>
<p>So pick your battles really carefully and technically you can do what you want, if that</p>
<p>makes sense.</p>
<p>How much trade-off is there now in how much effort you put into the realism of the graphics</p>
<p>versus the story?</p>
<p>And actually not even how much effort you put in, but is there a trade-off in the experience,</p>
<p>the feel of the game in terms of realism and story?</p>
<p>Usually we will start with let the player have as much agency and do as many things</p>
<p>as they can as possible.</p>
<p>And we will sacrifice some graphic fidelity for that, some speed for that.</p>
<p>We could make a game that, traditionally our games are, we&rsquo;re okay with 30 frames a second</p>
<p>as long as it looks really good and the simulation&rsquo;s running and all of those things.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll sacrifice some of that fidelity for the player experience and the kind of things</p>
<p>that I do.</p>
<p>From a manpower standpoint, the graphics programmers work on graphics, the artists work on art,</p>
<p>and we have an awesome team of artists and designers and writers and programmers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually where we find as time goes on, the amount of art time that it takes to create</p>
<p>a cup compared to what it used to be, that has increased.</p>
<p>So we do use, most people use art outsourcing as well so that we&rsquo;re not, we still relatively</p>
<p>compared to our industry and what we&rsquo;re doing, have smaller teams.</p>
<p>What about the experience of the beauty of the graphics?</p>
<p>So like one of the most amazing things about Skyrim, and maybe you could say that about</p>
<p>some of the other games, but for me Skyrim is the outdoor, when you step outside, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the outdoor scenery.</p>
<p>So what does it take to create the feeling, especially of that, being outdoors of nature</p>
<p>and just like lost in the beauty, whatever it is when you go hiking and you feel the</p>
<p>awe of it, how do you create that awe?</p>
<p>Is that graphics?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of graphics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of mood.</p>
<p>Let me just talk about it in terms of tone.</p>
<p>Those are, again, going back to my previous comment, the graphics are very, very important</p>
<p>to us because, and we always push them, because when you&rsquo;re doing the kind of things we do</p>
<p>where you step into a virtual world, it does have to have that moment of, wow, this is,</p>
<p>this feels real.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never experienced this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s okay, I think it&rsquo;s okay to let just like the time settle, meaning you step</p>
<p>out, how does the wind sound?</p>
<p>How are the trees moving?</p>
<p>How are the clouds moving?</p>
<p>I enjoy strolling and watching the sunset.</p>
<p>You know, how does it land over the water?</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like, hey, let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s finish a quest.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go kill things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s figure out the next step.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s level up.</p>
<p>Like I like the quiet moments a lot.</p>
<p>And I think when you play our games, you can tell we spend a lot of time on them.</p>
<p>And when you watch like the weather roll in, I think that&rsquo;s just part of being, being that</p>
<p>character, being that person in that space.</p>
<p>Yeah, the, I saw that there&rsquo;s a mod that removes all enemies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do that, to just do like a live stream where I for hours walk around</p>
<p>Skyrim just, and then answer questions and so on.</p>
<p>That just feels, that&rsquo;s a completely stress-free environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you are, just like you said, in this moment in time, and it&rsquo;s so incredible.</p>
<p>It feels as incredible as going hiking or something like that.</p>
<p>But in another totally different place, like Iceland or something like that, this whole</p>
<p>other surreal, ethereal place, it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s incredible how you kind of create that.</p>
<p>So graphics is a part of that, but also letting it, the temporal aspect of that, like the</p>
<p>wind, the rustling sound and look and all of that.</p>
<p>The soundscape is really, really important.</p>
<p>And the sky, we spend a lot of time on the sky because it&rsquo;s taking up much more of the</p>
<p>screen than a lot of people give credit for.</p>
<p>What about the rendering, the openness of it?</p>
<p>Like how do you, is that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of level of detail, streaming work, and, you know, nowadays it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>more common.</p>
<p>Frankly, the systems are built better for it.</p>
<p>Hard drive speed is really prioritized, like they&rsquo;re so blazing fast.</p>
<p>You take Skyrim and Oblivion and the fallouts of that 360 era, it&rsquo;s a, and it was a lot</p>
<p>of time spent on how do we get all this data streaming in as you move, and then levels</p>
<p>of detail so you can see all the way, but not, you know, crush the processor.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s even step back, because you mentioned tone, and you mentioned tone a lot.</p>
<p>What do you mean by tone?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of it together.</p>
<p>If you look at, I think you can flip through, let&rsquo;s just take fantasy.</p>
<p>You know, you can sort of look at a couple images or things and know how does Lord of</p>
<p>the Rings different from Game of Thrones that is different than, you know, a Thurian</p>
<p>like Excalibur, or your, you know, sci-fi channel, you know, series of the month kind</p>
<p>of thing.</p>
<p>And so finding that, what&rsquo;s going to make it kind of unique, and usually I lean on something</p>
<p>that is grounded in reality for what it is, and then have lesser kind of fantastical things,</p>
<p>at least at the start, and then they kind of build.</p>
<p>So even when we do Starfield, I mean, it&rsquo;s a science fiction game, there are laser guns</p>
<p>and spaceships that fly around and shoot each other and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s grounded, and you can look at it and say, okay, this is kind of an extension</p>
<p>of things as we view them today in space.</p>
<p>And we sort of take the same approach with Fallout, where admittedly, things can get</p>
<p>even a little bit crazier the longer you&rsquo;re developing Fallout content.</p>
<p>So just to linger on this, so tone starts at, or defining the tone starts at creating</p>
<p>a realistic experience, like you feel like I could walk into this, and this feels like</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their technology level, like even for a fantasy world, like is magic, how prevalent</p>
<p>is it, or are they making weapons and things and armor?</p>
<p>Is it for utility?</p>
<p>Is it for decoration?</p>
<p>How do they live their lives?</p>
<p>Does this feel like a place that you believe that has some grounding in our reality, whether</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s historical or near future, or that it&rsquo;s grounded in some semblance of the reality</p>
<p>that you and I understand so that it can feel, it&rsquo;s also making it feel a little bit welcoming,</p>
<p>like, okay, I understand this.</p>
<p>Is that art or science?</p>
<p>How do you know when it feels welcoming and everything fits and is grounded?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s personal taste.</p>
<p>Some people like things that are weirder, that have more fantastical from the get-go.</p>
<p>Even a game like Morrowind, where we get into some more fantastical things, it intentionally</p>
<p>starts a little more grounded.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a very classic medieval-looking town that you come into, but you look just</p>
<p>beyond it, and there are mushroom trees and giant insects and things like that.</p>
<p>So in Skyrim, when you put a dragon in it, what are your thoughts about dragons and tone?</p>
<p>How does that fit into tone?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ridiculous question, but yeah, I just love dragons, so I wanted to bring it up.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>These are the things that we debate with&hellip;</p>
<p>Do we include a dragon?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you include a dragon in Daggerfall?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I want to know.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s dragon&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s dragonlings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hard to do.</p>
<p>Dragons are hard to do.</p>
<p>So when you start Skyrim, say, hey, look, dragons are going to be a theme.</p>
<p>Start visually.</p>
<p>You can make the argument that dragons existed.</p>
<p>Okay, what would they look like?</p>
<p>How close to dinosaurs would they be?</p>
<p>And ours are less&hellip;</p>
<p>I believe they&rsquo;re less fantastical-looking in general.</p>
<p>They look like beasts that could exist in that world.</p>
<p>And then how we introduce them, it&rsquo;s kind of a little bit of a slow roll in Skyrim,</p>
<p>and that the people in the world are reacting to the dragons appearing.</p>
<p>And that somewhat mirrors&hellip;</p>
<p>You want something that mirrors the player experience as well.</p>
<p>It says back to you, like, hey, no, these are&hellip;</p>
<p>This is&hellip;</p>
<p>Have you heard this?</p>
<p>Someone saw a dragon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Daggerfall&hellip;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there mentions of dragons or something?</p>
<p>Because I remember being sure that there&rsquo;s dragons in Daggerfall as I&rsquo;m playing it and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m searching.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure&hellip;</p>
<p>Well&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there a dragon in Daggerfall?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s dragon wings in Daggerfall, to my memory.</p>
<p>Look, I guess someone will probably correct me, like, actually, there is a dragon here.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;re sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then a game I did, Redguard, which&hellip;</p>
<p>We bring back a dragon.</p>
<p>It takes place beforehand, so we have a dragon there in that game, and that was unique to</p>
<p>that at the time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just a brief tangent on that.</p>
<p>I thought Redguard was a really, really good game.</p>
<p>I played it as a&hellip;</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>You forget stuff.</p>
<p>But I remember getting&hellip;</p>
<p>I guess it was the first in the Elder Scrolls series to put it into that world, but it was</p>
<p>like an adventure game.</p>
<p>It reminded me of another game I really love, like Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>That was one of the inspirations.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia is one of my favorite games.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, I apologize if I&rsquo;m forgetting, but you can jump in buildings and stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a jump and there&rsquo;s a dynamic, airy nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a parkour type of situation.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was an incredible game.</p>
<p>Why do you think&hellip;</p>
<p>Let me ask sort of a dark question.</p>
<p>Why do you think that game was a flop?</p>
<p>One of the few&hellip;</p>
<p>Not a dark question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a game that I love and really got us going on a handcrafted world, so we&rsquo;re coming</p>
<p>off of Daggerfall.</p>
<p>Morrowind is sort of in design.</p>
<p>And then part of our development teams broke up to do different things.</p>
<p>The game that did Battlespire and Redguard was my game.</p>
<p>And I wanted to do something a little more Ultima feeling, handcrafted world.</p>
<p>I really like things that blend up genres, so I know it&rsquo;s in the adventure game category,</p>
<p>but it really does a lot of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a love letter to Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little Raiders of the Lost Ark in it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of Ultima in it.</p>
<p>And really see what we could do with the engine.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very much, I think, plays&hellip;</p>
<p>It would have had a much better home on, say, PlayStation or Xbox.</p>
<p>Though this predates Xbox, where it&rsquo;s much more constantly Tomb Raider had come out,</p>
<p>so you see those influences of Tomb Raider on that game.</p>
<p>And 3D effects cards had just come out, and so, okay, we can do&hellip;</p>
<p>And it was the last, I think it&rsquo;s one of the last DOS games in a Windows world.</p>
<p>So I think it missed kind of a technology window, as well as, ultimately, not what people</p>
<p>wanted from us, you know?</p>
<p>And I felt&hellip;</p>
<p>I was really kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>The company let me make that game, and it was a big flop.</p>
<p>Battlespire hadn&rsquo;t done well.</p>
<p>The company was in really bad shape, and I felt really personally responsible.</p>
<p>Like they let me do this creative thing.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t do what we needed it to do, and now we&rsquo;re in a very, very bad situation.</p>
<p>Company almost went out of business.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when it got reformed with ZeniMax Media, and Robert Altman came in, and we were</p>
<p>starting Morrowind.</p>
<p>We had just sort of started, and it was sort of that whole experience that made you sort</p>
<p>of realize&hellip;</p>
<p>Someone says to you, okay, you&rsquo;re going to get another shot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re like, okay, we&rsquo;re going to make Morrowind, and make the biggest</p>
<p>best RPG we can make.</p>
<p>We know what the audience wants from us.</p>
<p>We know what we could do building a world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s callbacks to how we built the world in Redguard.</p>
<p>Morrowind is a large-scale, handcrafted&hellip;</p>
<p>But if you were to put it pixel per pixel with Daggerfall, you wouldn&rsquo;t even see Morrowind,</p>
<p>because Daggerfall is so big.</p>
<p>But the impact of playing it, I think, is in many ways equal, but different.</p>
<p>Just you personally, psychologically, did you have doubt about yourself from the performance</p>
<p>of Redguard?</p>
<p>Do I even&hellip;</p>
<p>Do I know what it is?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Where do you get the&hellip;</p>
<p>How do you overcome that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would say this.</p>
<p>Honestly, I enjoy it so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so heads down, that becomes, for better or worse, my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something that I want to play so much, it becomes like there&rsquo;s a little bit&hellip;</p>
<p>You get a little obsessed with it.</p>
<p>No, but I mean, you love Redguard, right?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that mean, isn&rsquo;t there a self-doubt about, do I know what it takes to create a</p>
<p>great game?</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>I think Redguard&rsquo;s a great game.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So you were sure, even if it wasn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a debate like, do I like that game?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about finding an&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I love Redguard.</p>
<p>And the people who play it, it won a bunch of awards, and critically, it was a pretty</p>
<p>good game.</p>
<p>Did not sell.</p>
<p>And the reason for that, again, we probably made the wrong type of game, and we missed</p>
<p>the technology window.</p>
<p>We also thought it was very conservative.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do this.</p>
<p>So my main takeaway was, I&rsquo;m not going to be conservative again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to swing for the fences.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be some rough edges in swinging for the fences and shooting for the moon, but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d rather do that and land where we land than be very, very conservative in what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting out there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned, just referencing this game on Reddit AMA, that long time ago during Redguard,</p>
<p>the lead programmer made all the buildings hop up and down after you played for 10 minutes</p>
<p>just to mess with me.</p>
<p>Just a curious tangent, what&rsquo;s involved with programming an open world game?</p>
<p>So we talked about&hellip;</p>
<p>We will talk about design and so on, but specifically the programming, because I think this question</p>
<p>came from, what are some interesting sticky bugs that you&rsquo;ve encountered throughout your</p>
<p>life in creating these games?</p>
<p>And this is one of them that you mentioned.</p>
<p>So what are some of the challenges of programming these open world games?</p>
<p>I mean, there are different flavors of them, right?</p>
<p>Your GTAs will have different issues than the Ubisoft games versus our games.</p>
<p>I can sort of speak to ours, which is you want to build systems, right?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re going to play the game for a very long time as well, which we&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t go through and touch everything by hand per se.</p>
<p>So you have to rely on some systemic level of creation and a lot of systems that are</p>
<p>robust enough so that when they touch another one, things aren&rsquo;t breaking apart.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a&hellip;</p>
<p>What are the major systems?</p>
<p>Is there like the physics of the game?</p>
<p>The engine of how like stuff, yeah, like, yeah, the physics, the motion, and maybe how</p>
<p>light is rendered and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you have the rendering, right, of like, okay, this is how I&rsquo;m going to render the</p>
<p>data that I have.</p>
<p>So a lot of people confuse engines with rendering.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re combined, obviously, but there&rsquo;s the data you&rsquo;re going to give to a renderer,</p>
<p>which is the thing, you know, that draws the pixels on the screen.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Most of the engine is how are you going to bring in that data and give it to the renderer</p>
<p>to draw it?</p>
<p>So you have that whole system of walking through the world, feeding in the data and drawing</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>You then obviously have the physics and the interactivity.</p>
<p>What are the things that are there just to be drawn?</p>
<p>And what are the things there that are meant to be interacted with and touched?</p>
<p>We put a big premium on the ones that can be interacted with and touched, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>flowers, whether the trees move, whether you can sleep on the sofa, sit in this chair,</p>
<p>pick up all this stuff, bake bread, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>You then have the AI, which loops in the stuff we talked about earlier in terms of processing</p>
<p>everybody and combat systems, which is a lot of what people end up doing, combat systems</p>
<p>on top of that AI.</p>
<p>How do they react to those types of things?</p>
<p>And then how do they look at the things that can be interacted with?</p>
<p>One of my favorite things is when NPCs will go pick up weapons in the world, which you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see in other games.</p>
<p>And the first time you see it in one of ours, it&rsquo;s very unexpected.</p>
<p>You can drop a crazy weapon, be in a fight, and an NPC runs over, picks it up, and uses</p>
<p>it on you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you would expect, but I love that stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s integrated into a larger system, the ability to pick up a weapon, the NPC picking</p>
<p>up a weapon.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like a little quirk that&rsquo;s hard-coded in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a bigger system.</p>
<p>They have their own AI for scanning the environment, and that&rsquo;s one of the rules.</p>
<p>Hey, is there a weapon that is better than the one I have?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go get it.</p>
<p>Now we do lock off if it&rsquo;s in a chest, and that&rsquo;s treasure we left for the player.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in particular, because what you don&rsquo;t want, we actually had this problem, it started</p>
<p>in Oblivion, I believe, which is we set up a level, hey, let the enemies go pick up the</p>
<p>weapons if they&rsquo;re better.</p>
<p>So we make a level and go in, and all of the enemies are armed to the teeth, and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no treasure for the player because the enemies went and took all the good weapons.</p>
<p>Okay, they don&rsquo;t take those, they take the ones that are dropped by other NPCs or the</p>
<p>player.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a fascinating world of designing the experience for the NPC, because in part</p>
<p>that experience defines the experience of the player.</p>
<p>So how they interact with their environment defines how the player experiences their environment.</p>
<p>Is there room for further and further development of the AI that controls the NPC?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always iterating on it, and again, as we look in the future, it&rsquo;s more about us</p>
<p>finding those, more reactivity to the player, and also understanding their roles in the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not just there, they&rsquo;re not just there for the player as a signpost for the</p>
<p>player.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re reacting to the player.</p>
<p>But what about, you know, some of the richest experiences we have with people is like the</p>
<p>chaos of it, the push and pull, the unpredictability.</p>
<p>Is there something, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve been following, but the quick, amazing development</p>
<p>of language models, the neural network, natural language processing systems, dialogue systems,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s some possibility of using sort of these incredible neural nets that</p>
<p>can have open-ended dialogue, basically chat bots?</p>
<p>Yep, I&rsquo;ve seen some incredible demos.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little bit of a question, like, what&rsquo;s ready for real deployment and release</p>
<p>versus, hey, let&rsquo;s use that to generate some things that is then static that we&rsquo;re giving</p>
<p>to the players, versus it&rsquo;s generated on the fly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s definitely coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely coming.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;ll see it in the types of games that we do, it has great, you know,</p>
<p>application.</p>
<p>I love the idea that you&rsquo;ll be using that to design different NPCs and then testing</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re good enough.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re like, oh, too crazy, you don&rsquo;t want like the super-</p>
<p>Right, but if we go back to it being reactive, some of that bot stuff, you know, it&rsquo;s pretty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s then translating that into voice, and then is that being done by the client?</p>
<p>Is that being done on a server?</p>
<p>Is it baked into the game?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like different flavors of it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s still computational challenges, like how do you actually make that happen?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, what about, in terms of creating the feeling of an NPC, what&rsquo;s the role of voice</p>
<p>actors?</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We work with a ton of voice actors, and they bring so much to it, and that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>They, you know, we can write some stuff and the best ones get in there and make it so</p>
<p>much better, or even ad lib things.</p>
<p>And so we do a lot of voice recording, and we used to do it kind of like at the end of</p>
<p>the project, and now we do it throughout.</p>
<p>We start really early and we just start recording.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re recording for years and years, literally, probably three years, four years.</p>
<p>So part of the actual experience of the recording will help define the characters and the tone</p>
<p>of the game.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll go back sometimes and, hey, we really like this.</p>
<p>We want more of this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s write.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do another session.</p>
<p>Or, hey, we don&rsquo;t think this character&rsquo;s actually working.</p>
<p>We want you to do a different, you&rsquo;re going to be someone else now.</p>
<p>Sorry, that got cut.</p>
<p>Do you ever try to sort of imagine that people fall in love with the characters, with the</p>
<p>NPCs?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, do they get really attached to the&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve done it in games.</p>
<p>These are like close friends, right?</p>
<p>Like, you can, like, you miss them.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that part of the thing you miss?</p>
<p>I guess whenever I&rsquo;m playing a game and there is, you know, if there&rsquo;s like a friendship</p>
<p>option or make friends or a romance thing, I find those moments really, I enjoy them.</p>
<p>I find them pretty impactful emotionally to what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve done a little bit of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that we actually have pushed in Starfield.</p>
<p>So we have a number of companions, but for them, we go, you know, I won&rsquo;t say super complex</p>
<p>romantic, but more complex relationships than we&rsquo;ve had in terms of not just some, you know,</p>
<p>state of they like you or they don&rsquo;t like you, but they can be in love with you and</p>
<p>dislike something you did and be pissed at you temporarily and then come back to loving</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>So that relationship status, if it&rsquo;s complicated, that they&rsquo;re existing in that gray area, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>complicated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not dating, we&rsquo;re just&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s in a lot of games, you know, previous stuff, you just work your way up, they like</p>
<p>you more and more and more and more, and now you&rsquo;re in a relationship.</p>
<p>And when you make them upset, you drift out of like it never happened, you know, you drift</p>
<p>out of it.</p>
<p>Whereas we wanted one where, okay, we can be in a relationship and we&rsquo;ve committed to</p>
<p>each other in some way, but I just did something that really made you angry.</p>
<p>And as opposed to just drifting out of that status, you&rsquo;re in a temporary, I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>what you did state.</p>
<p>Wow, so some greater degree of complexity in the relationship with a companion.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to oversell that part, but my point is, I think those things where you meet</p>
<p>a character in a game and you do spend time with them, a companion in a game, and it leads</p>
<p>to romance, you know, myself and others, and I find a lot of players, those moments are</p>
<p>really, really impactful and special to them because they did put in the time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing that I always committed with, which is, I think people who don&rsquo;t play</p>
<p>video games, they sometimes think like, oh, that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s a waste of time</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s not real or that&rsquo;s not like, you&rsquo;re not getting a lot out of that.</p>
<p>Like, well, you haven&rsquo;t really experienced it in the way that you can, because these</p>
<p>moments that I spent in games, not the ones I made, other ones when I was growing up or</p>
<p>even now, that is important time to me.</p>
<p>Like I love those moments, I felt really like proud of what I accomplished.</p>
<p>And we want people to have that in our games, and the fact that they have had those experiences</p>
<p>and we hear from them and how important it is to them, it&rsquo;s like, no, this is really,</p>
<p>really special.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>I mean, from a game design perspective, I wonder if you can honor the time you spent</p>
<p>together with a game, because, you know, sometimes there&rsquo;s a heartbreak at the end of the game.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re, when you leave a game, there&rsquo;s a, yeah, it&rsquo;s a really complicated</p>
<p>relationship, actually, because when you leave a game, it&rsquo;s almost like leaving a romantic</p>
<p>partner, because it&rsquo;s like you spent so much meaningful time together, and there&rsquo;s a sense</p>
<p>in which it was, it was ephemeral, like you, this is not, this doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, it didn&rsquo;t really happen.</p>
<p>It was good.</p>
<p>It was like, you went to Vegas, you got drunk and stuff for like, and now life goes on.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way to sort of always carry that with you.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess with words, you can kind of share with others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, like, now that we&rsquo;re in the age where you have achievements and you can look at</p>
<p>your library and see your hours in games, like, that&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like a scrapbook</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>I wish, one of my wishes was like, I wish I had that achievement list for everything,</p>
<p>like back to the late 70s.</p>
<p>Like every game you played.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, you, I mean, that&rsquo;s one of the cool things with Xbox, like, we&rsquo;re moving towards</p>
<p>that direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be cool to be, from like childhood, the first time you play a video game, it will</p>
<p>actually tell you what is the first game you played.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Kids today, they will have that.</p>
<p>They will have that.</p>
<p>But you could look back and see, oh my God, I put a thousand hours in Daggerfall.</p>
<p>What is the first game?</p>
<p>And my last save was 1997.</p>
<p>Last save.</p>
<p>Man, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Golden Axe, maybe?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think, what was the first game I ever played?</p>
<p>No, it was probably Commodore 64 games.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, arcade games.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You mentioned Starfield.</p>
<p>What is Starfield?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the origin story of this game?</p>
<p>We had always wanted to do something where you explore space, you know, the explore space</p>
<p>role-playing game.</p>
<p>So, take the kind of games that we make and give it a little bit of a different spin.</p>
<p>And you know, the other games that I love, there was a pen and paper RPG I love, Traveler.</p>
<p>It was one of the first games I made for the Apple II.</p>
<p>I never finished it, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just doing it on my own.</p>
<p>I love this game.</p>
<p>Starflight was one.</p>
<p>Star Control 2 was a game that I loved.</p>
<p>Sun Dog was a big one in the Apple II days that a lot of people don&rsquo;t know that I loved.</p>
<p>And so, a lot of us in the studio felt it was time to do something new.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re going between Elder Scrolls and Fallout and going back and forth.</p>
<p>And I mean, we love that, but hey, we&rsquo;ve always wanted to do this explore the galaxy science</p>
<p>fiction game.</p>
<p>You know, now is the time to do that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a brave move.</p>
<p>So, Fallout is post-apocalyptic on a single planet.</p>
<p>You know, Elder Scrolls series is on a single planet.</p>
<p>So, this is going out into the open world of many star systems, many planets.</p>
<p>I saw that it&rsquo;s thinking about a hundred star systems and a thousand planets available</p>
<p>to explore.</p>
<p>What is that world of stars and planets like?</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned Daggerfall.</p>
<p>We go back to some of that.</p>
<p>Well, the first when we did it was, how are we going to render a planet, like pull it</p>
<p>off for the player?</p>
<p>Like, can we?</p>
<p>Or do we have to sort of do it where you can&rsquo;t land on all of them, where you&rsquo;re landing</p>
<p>in a very controlled, small world space that we, you know, kind of craft and you would</p>
<p>have a very limited set of those.</p>
<p>You go back to tone, like, well, that&rsquo;s probably the wrong tone.</p>
<p>And how can we say yes?</p>
<p>Like, I want to land on that ice ball.</p>
<p>So, it started, we started the game right after Fallout 4, so 2016.</p>
<p>And the first thing we did was, can, you know, how can we have a system to generate these</p>
<p>planets and make them look, you know, I&rsquo;ll say reasonable, as opposed to, you know, fractally</p>
<p>goop?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the technical definition of goop?</p>
<p>Fractally goop?</p>
<p>Fractally goop.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen a lot of, like, simulations, whether they&rsquo;re space things or landscape</p>
<p>things, where they&rsquo;re using fractals and just the landscape does not look real.</p>
<p>It just is like highs and lows and it&rsquo;s muddy.</p>
<p>And so, we did find a way.</p>
<p>We came up with a way, had prototyped of building tiles, like large tiles of landscape,</p>
<p>the way we would usually build them.</p>
<p>We kind of generate them offline, hand do some things, and end up with these very realistic</p>
<p>looking tiles of landscape.</p>
<p>And then built a system that wraps those around a planet and blends them all together.</p>
<p>And we had pretty successful results with that.</p>
<p>And so, we thought, yeah, we could do this.</p>
<p>And so, there was a big design kind of problem to solve in terms of, well, what&rsquo;s fun about</p>
<p>landing on a planet where there&rsquo;s potentially nothing?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lot of planets and moons, if you kind of, right, in reality that, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing on them except resources.</p>
<p>And so, we spent a lot of time figuring out, okay, let&rsquo;s just lean in on that can A, be</p>
<p>a lonely experience, as long as we tell the player, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s there, here are the</p>
<p>resources that are there, go find them.</p>
<p>But I equate it to that moment of, we said, about listening to the wind go and watching</p>
<p>the sunset.</p>
<p>And I do think there&rsquo;s a certain beauty to landing on a strange planet, being somewhat</p>
<p>the only person there, building an outpost.</p>
<p>And we are modeling all of the systems, because that&rsquo;s how we like to do things.</p>
<p>So, you can watch whatever that gas giant or moon, it will rotate and go and sunrise,</p>
<p>sunset and all of those things that you would expect, and it&rsquo;s all really happening.</p>
<p>And most people probably won&rsquo;t notice or appreciate all of that, but I think it gives them the</p>
<p>ability to say, I want to go do that and see that on that place, as long as we tell them,</p>
<p>hey, the quest leads over here, here&rsquo;s where the handcrafted content is that you would</p>
<p>expect, and then here&rsquo;s more of the open procedural planet experience.</p>
<p>Long answer, I don&rsquo;t know if I answered your question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, the questions are stupid and the answers are brilliant, so that&rsquo;s how this</p>
<p>works.</p>
<p>So, this is the world&rsquo;s most immense simulator of the human condition of loneliness.</p>
<p>Because I can&rsquo;t imagine a more lonely experience.</p>
<p>I mean, you put it that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that was the goal, but.</p>
<p>Just on a planet alone, that must be, I mean, a deep embodiment of what loneliness is like.</p>
<p>I mean, both on, like when you hike alone, there&rsquo;s a deep loneliness to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s humbling that this thing will last much longer than you, it&rsquo;s been here</p>
<p>way before you.</p>
<p>Is it the line from the moon landing, beautiful desolation, Buzz Aldrin, is it?</p>
<p>Beautiful desolation, is that what he said?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Beautiful desolation.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just words, there&rsquo;s a feeling to it, and you want that feeling to be real.</p>
<p>You just hear, there&rsquo;s some resources here, I just feel like it&rsquo;ll hit people at a certain</p>
<p>moment, like it does for me with Skyrim, like, holy shit, I&rsquo;m here alone.</p>
<p>Whatever cruel nature that&rsquo;s out there doesn&rsquo;t really care about me.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the experience, so you want to create the whole planet, and you want to have many</p>
<p>of them.</p>
<p>We have, we do have many.</p>
<p>But once you build that system, I think the numbers become, I mean, honestly, a little</p>
<p>bit, we wrap it in so we can name them all and have a finite set, even though it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very, very large number, but a set that we can, you know, validate and know about even</p>
<p>though it&rsquo;s a huge number.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re building a system that can build a planet, I mean, a planet is sort of</p>
<p>infinite space, we go back to the Daggerfall analogy, right?</p>
<p>If you have systems to build that much space, doing a hundred planets or a thousand or ten</p>
<p>thousand or a million planets is not, it&rsquo;s just, you just press, you just change the</p>
<p>number and press the button, but you can&rsquo;t name them all, you can&rsquo;t control, like, when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting in really big numbers, hey, what does this system way out here feel like</p>
<p>if you take your ship and jump that far?</p>
<p>We do level the systems, when you go to system, you&rsquo;ll see, oh, this is like a level 40 system,</p>
<p>and us being able to at least control that scale is how we kind of ended up with the</p>
<p>hundred-ish systems we have.</p>
<p>What are the, what are the levelings, what do you mean by level, with levels?</p>
<p>It would be like when you look at a map in a game, it says, this is the area for low-level</p>
<p>players, this is level one.</p>
<p>Oh, got it, got it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so we do that on a system basis.</p>
<p>Star system.</p>
<p>I read that space travel is considered dangerous in this game, can you explain?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more of, that goes back to a tone thing, right?</p>
<p>When you actually play the game, because it&rsquo;s a game, like, we don&rsquo;t really kill you when</p>
<p>you fly out in space, but it has a tone of, there&rsquo;s some effort involved, and we&rsquo;ve dialed</p>
<p>it back as we&rsquo;ve been making the game, whereas we used to run out of fuel, you&rsquo;d jump and</p>
<p>get stranded, which on paper was a great, like, it&rsquo;s a great moment when you get stranded</p>
<p>and you have to press this beacon, you don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s gonna come.</p>
<p>Turns out that&rsquo;s not, like, it just stops your game.</p>
<p>We found, you&rsquo;d be playing the game and I ran out of fuel, okay, I guess I&rsquo;ll just wander</p>
<p>these planets trying to mine for fuel so I can get back to what I was doing, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a fun killer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too realistic of a simulation of the human condition.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, the idea was, well, it&rsquo;s very, you know, games do that, if you had, like, a hardcore,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right, a hardcore survival mode, that&rsquo;s the kind of thing you would do, maybe we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do it in the future, but it&rsquo;s more of, like, a tone, how they build their ships, do they</p>
<p>have all the right things for safety.</p>
<p>We do get into environmental things on the planets, you know, in your space suit, obviously</p>
<p>there are a lot of different space suits and buffs for, you know, the gases, the toxicity</p>
<p>or the temperature on various planets.</p>
<p>Are there robots?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Those companions, are they robots by chance?</p>
<p>Can you say?</p>
<p>One of the companions is a robot, Vosko, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so they have a name and a personality and so on.</p>
<p>Vosko does, and then there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of, I call them generic robots.</p>
<p>We use them for utility, you know, okay, people, we actually dialed them back, because if you</p>
<p>think about, well, you know a lot about this more than me, in terms of&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m offended right now, you&rsquo;re calling robots generic and you don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re bad.</p>
<p>No, no, no, the ones we use, the ones we use, we made them more generic.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t say actually&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m very sensitive about this stuff.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>If you were to chart the future, you would say robots would have a much bigger role in</p>
<p>our future than we are presenting.</p>
<p>But that was a tone thing.</p>
<p>So we, most of our robots are there as utility robots and there are some combat ones as well</p>
<p>as enemies.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a deeply human world.</p>
<p>Very much, yes.</p>
<p>In terms of tone.</p>
<p>So have you talked to Elon about this, about this game?</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>How much of reality, like the work of SpaceX, is it an inspiration for the decisions made</p>
<p>in this game?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s for the decisions we made, but, you know, visiting SpaceX and walking</p>
<p>in there, it was&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Avengers meet NASA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the most amazing&hellip;</p>
<p>And here we&rsquo;re building the next gen, like, see the dragon stuff before it was, you know,</p>
<p>other people saw it.</p>
<p>It was just, I was really in awe.</p>
<p>You know, this giant machine that looks for imperfections on the surface of these giant,</p>
<p>you know, fuselage, just, you know, whenever&hellip;</p>
<p>And because, you know, we&rsquo;re in DC, go to the Air and Space Museum a lot, and so whenever</p>
<p>I look at those kind of things, or, you know, you&rsquo;ll visit the space shuttle, sort of overcome</p>
<p>with how big it is, and I go stand back by the engines and think about that thing leaving</p>
<p>orbit.</p>
<p>You know, and one of the things Elon really impresses, like, we&rsquo;re reaching the edge of</p>
<p>physics on a lot of this stuff where how hard it is to leave orbit, the gravitational pull.</p>
<p>And like, so, the engineering that has gone into that, our space program, what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>now, I just marvel at.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand, right, I&rsquo;m not at that level, but I marvel at the kind of human ingenuity</p>
<p>and scale.</p>
<p>I was on the Delaware coast last month, and I went outside.</p>
<p>I was outside for some reason, it was dark, and I saw this crazy light in the sky.</p>
<p>And I thought it was like a helicopter, and then it didn&rsquo;t go away, and I&rsquo;m like, someone,</p>
<p>what is that?</p>
<p>And I call my, we had some friends, hey, does everybody see this?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>And we just stood dumbfounded looking at this thing in the sky.</p>
<p>And like, that is a UFO, nobody takes their phone out.</p>
<p>Everyone, I&rsquo;m with like four people, everyone is too dumbstruck.</p>
<p>You would think, why don&rsquo;t you take a picture of this thing?</p>
<p>And the next day we found out, it was in the news, it was the SpaceX launch in Florida.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m seeing it from Delaware, Maryland area.</p>
<p>It was one of the most, it was incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, even just that, I am in complete awe of.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect of that that you can replicate, the majestic nature of that in</p>
<p>a video game?</p>
<p>I wish I had the answer to that, you know.</p>
<p>I think some of it we were doing when you&rsquo;re standing on a planet and you see the other</p>
<p>moons go by, and then you realize, I could get my ship blast off and land there and build</p>
<p>myself a home.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a minor thing we do, which is we have other ships come and go from the starports</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll be in a city and then you hear this, and you hear the engine, you look up</p>
<p>and a ship is taking off or coming, like, there&rsquo;s nothing for you to do, but I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So then that&rsquo;s all about creating the soundscape, the feel.</p>
<p>Seeing it and like, oh, that&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a ship that, or you jump into a system and you see these freighters and sometimes</p>
<p>they contact you, like, it&rsquo;s not all just like jump in and combat.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about the fact that science fiction seems to make, it has a way of creating</p>
<p>reality, not just kind of predicting it or imagining it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like the thing you put out there with a video game like this, like Starfield,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t anticipate.</p>
<p>It kind of fuels people&rsquo;s imagination, what is possible.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making me think now about other science fiction that, a movie I love, Minority Report,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of like a, not a space movie, but more like looking at the future.</p>
<p>If you look at a lot of the things in that movie, it&rsquo;s almost like, I think those are</p>
<p>coming true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, is that the one that you do interface this, like a&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the interfaces and then the, you know, the way he looks at his child&rsquo;s more like</p>
<p>a holographic, almost AR, VR kind of thing, or digital billboards, or trying to predict</p>
<p>human behavior.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a lot of future stuff in that movie.</p>
<p>As it comes to sci-fi, to your other question, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I think it does, and it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose you&rsquo;re trying to create the most realistic, sticking to the tone,</p>
<p>the most immersive, realistic world, and almost by accident, you create the thing that</p>
<p>is possible, because you want it to be realistic in some deep sense, so accidentally it can</p>
<p>become the possible, and then that places that idea in people&rsquo;s heads.</p>
<p>I mean, if humans are ever to become a multi-planetary species, we need to play games.</p>
<p>We need to read sci-fi to help imagine that that&rsquo;s possible, to look outside of Earth,</p>
<p>to look outside, look up on the stars, then we can actually travel out there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s power to sci-fi to do that.</p>
<p>I guess you shouldn&rsquo;t feel the pressure of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d make the leap now, that&rsquo;s all, that what we&rsquo;re doing might.</p>
<p>No, maybe, you know, hopefully it might inspire some young people who are headed in that direction</p>
<p>like, oh, I thought about getting into space and space exploration, and being an engineer,</p>
<p>doing these things, and I played this game, and it really sparked that interest in me,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to go take that as a field, and maybe that&rsquo;s the person who goes and does</p>
<p>some of these things.</p>
<p>Yeah, because in the next couple of decades, likely a human being will step foot on Mars,</p>
<p>which are the first steps towards us becoming multi-planetary.</p>
<p>And if you read some of the stuff they&rsquo;re doing with the James Webb telescope, and them</p>
<p>being able to look for signs of life on other planets, it&rsquo;s quite fascinating, and, you</p>
<p>know, recent stuff I read say they think in 20 years they will.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually quite encouraging to think, it&rsquo;s almost a dream of mine, like in our lifetimes</p>
<p>that we discover life on another planet.</p>
<p>Yeah, especially if it&rsquo;s intelligent life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking to a lot of biologists, and a lot of folks, I imagine there&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>everywhere out there.</p>
<p>The numbers would say so, yes.</p>
<p>The challenging question is what it looks like, and how much of it is intelligent.</p>
<p>So a lot of biologists tell me the big difficult leap is from the prokaryotes to the eukaryotes,</p>
<p>so like the complex life.</p>
<p>It could be that a lot of our universe is just filled with bacteria.</p>
<p>I believe, if I&rsquo;m understanding it right, that there&rsquo;s two ways they&rsquo;re going to look</p>
<p>at planets.</p>
<p>When they can look at, you know, they can read, hey, this planet has this kind of gas.</p>
<p>They can now look at the ones that are created by potential life forms, and then the ones</p>
<p>that are created, the byproducts of industry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only certain ones that are created if you have a society there, and that they</p>
<p>can start looking in these types of star systems and these planets.</p>
<p>But it takes a lot of time, because you have to book time on that telescope.</p>
<p>You have to like look at that planet over a long period of time.</p>
<p>But in theory, given enough time, given the amount of space out there, we would find one.</p>
<p>That would be a cool thing in this short life of ours to find out definitively that there</p>
<p>is an industrial intelligent civilization out there before you contact them.</p>
<p>So like die, end your life, not knowing the rest of the story, but just know that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>out there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cool&hellip;</p>
<p>And then if you have kids, be like, well, this one&rsquo;s on you.</p>
<p>F this, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by what it would do to the way, I think in a positive way, the way humanity</p>
<p>thinks about itself here.</p>
<p>Like no, there is definitively other life out there.</p>
<p>I mean, both things.</p>
<p>If there isn&rsquo;t life out there, that&rsquo;s also a huge responsibility.</p>
<p>Both are super exciting.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re alone, it&rsquo;s super exciting because there&rsquo;s a responsibility to preserve whatever</p>
<p>special thing we have going on here.</p>
<p>This, whether you call it the flame of consciousness or whether it&rsquo;s consciousness or intelligence,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a special thing.</p>
<p>Preserve it, have it expand.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s others out there, I mean, that like, that sparks that drive for exploration</p>
<p>of reaching out into the stars and meeting them.</p>
<p>Most of them probably want to kill us.</p>
<p>But luckily, we have the military industrial complex on Earth that builds bigger and better</p>
<p>weapons all the time.</p>
<p>We have Space Force.</p>
<p>Space Force.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It will both protect us and destroy all our enemies.</p>
<p>This is 100% a video game we&rsquo;re living in.</p>
<p>Okay, back to dragons.</p>
<p>So blink once if you know when Elder Scrolls VI is coming out, but are not going to tell</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>I have a vague idea.</p>
<p>Okay, vague idea.</p>
<p>So like, if you have the quantum mechanical interpretation that allows for multiple universes</p>
<p>in the universe where you didn&rsquo;t blink, what would that, Todd, tell me about the year it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming out?</p>
<p>Would it be 2025?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a trick question.</p>
<p>Or 26?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked that question many ways, but never like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought I would try to sneak it.</p>
<p>I mean, there is, of course, no answer, because&hellip;</p>
<p>I wish it was soon, you know, like we don&rsquo;t, we want them out too, you know, and I wish</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t take as long as they did, but they do.</p>
<p>And look, I mean, if I could go back in time, would never have been my plan to wait as long</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s taken for it.</p>
<p>So you love that world, the Elder Scrolls world?</p>
<p>Well, look, it&rsquo;s part of why I&rsquo;ve spent more time there than anything else in my life,</p>
<p>probably, right?</p>
<p>So I deeply love it.</p>
<p>We all do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a part of us.</p>
<p>And, you know, when you aren&rsquo;t doing it for a while, you really do miss it.</p>
<p>And when I look at what we&rsquo;re doing, have planned for that game, and I was in a meeting</p>
<p>yesterday, I was like, I just want to play all this right now.</p>
<p>But it, you know, we&rsquo;re going to make sure we do it right for everybody, and we do have</p>
<p>to approach it.</p>
<p>People are playing games for a long time, you know, Skyrim&rsquo;s 11 years old, still probably</p>
<p>our most played game, and so we don&rsquo;t see it slowing down.</p>
<p>And people will probably be playing it 10 years from now also.</p>
<p>So you have to think about, okay, people are going to play the next Elder Scrolls game</p>
<p>for a decade, two decades.</p>
<p>And that does change the way you think about how you architect it from the get-go.</p>
<p>What are some elements that changed the way, like, how do you make a game that&rsquo;s playable</p>
<p>for 20 years?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>But there are some elements, I should pause on that.</p>
<p>You know, pardon me, I&rsquo;m of course asking jokingly, I&rsquo;m excited for it, but I think</p>
<p>Skyrim is an amazing game still.</p>
<p>You know, I really enjoy it still.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know what?</p>
<p>The content, even if you think if you step away from it for a while, then play, what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put, say, the vanilla version without mods.</p>
<p>If you go and haven&rsquo;t played it in a while, there&rsquo;s always a new way to play it.</p>
<p>But then if you look at the mods and what creators are doing to it, we think that is</p>
<p>just awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;ve always supported.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to keep supporting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve hired a large number of modders that are now professionals.</p>
<p>We want to support the people who are doing it on their own so they can be professionals</p>
<p>on their own.</p>
<p>How do you create a world that&rsquo;s moddable?</p>
<p>So you think of designing the game from the start as that enables mods.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So it starts with us, like everything we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Okay, a modder, a content creator is going to have to do it, use our tools.</p>
<p>Now we do clean them up for release, because if you&rsquo;re like a developer in-house, you can</p>
<p>deal with some kludginess when you&rsquo;re putting stuff together.</p>
<p>When you put it out for people, we do clean a lot of it up, and there&rsquo;s still obviously</p>
<p>a learning curve there.</p>
<p>But look, we have people who have been doing it for 20 years with us.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s involved with modding?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually quite noobish at this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m almost afraid to ask, because now that you explained to me, I fear I will spend</p>
<p>a very large amount of time creating mods.</p>
<p>Well, we have an editor you can download on Steam, the creation kit for our games.</p>
<p>And then it loads up the world, and you could do something really, really small, like change</p>
<p>the color of the weather.</p>
<p>And it creates a little plugin file, we call it, a modification of the game.</p>
<p>And then you can run your game with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on console now, the mods, not the editing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just been incredible.</p>
<p>Our community there has been amazing what they do with the games.</p>
<p>So a lot of it is the visuals.</p>
<p>A lot of people do visual things, because it&rsquo;s the easiest thing to do first, or they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>build a new space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some great things with, like, I love the Khajiit follower mod for Skyrim.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>There have been quest lines.</p>
<p>Those things just take a really, really long time.</p>
<p>And so someone who&rsquo;s going to do that, that&rsquo;s almost like it takes them a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than a hobby.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re always looking at ways that we can make it like, hey, they can turn a career</p>
<p>into it, because it&rsquo;s just awesome.</p>
<p>What about, is there any possibility in doing a mod for some of the AI stuff?</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen some, but to really move it along, if they&rsquo;re using the tools that we</p>
<p>already put out there, so to really move the AI along, you&rsquo;d have to get in the code, which</p>
<p>some people have figured out ways to hack in and do things with script extenders.</p>
<p>But for the most part, like really pushing it, it does take us, which is why you see</p>
<p>when we have a new game come along, the palette that they have is there&rsquo;s so many more things</p>
<p>they can do.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve built bots that play the driving games.</p>
<p>But they do that by just taking, reading the screen and doing basic, not basic, it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>pretty complicated, but computer vision and doing the control, but you&rsquo;re basically simulating</p>
<p>the human player.</p>
<p>To do that for Skyrim or for some of the open world games, that&rsquo;s literally, you have to</p>
<p>create AGI to be able to play those open, well, maybe not.</p>
<p>Maybe you can create a super dumb, like just a two-handed sword and just keep swinging</p>
<p>until everybody&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s some bot stuff out there that does it.</p>
<p>We have some very, very dumb bots that we use to run through the world to test it, that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll deploy on a whole bunch of servers just to, you know, we do it every day.</p>
<p>We run through every space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing Starfield.</p>
<p>And then just running, they&rsquo;re all out there.</p>
<p>Well, it does it very quickly.</p>
<p>It loads up every place, every place in the game and runs around a little bit and then</p>
<p>loads the next place and runs around a little bit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just testing, like, did it crash?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the memory growth?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, get a report, here are all the places where the frame rate wasn&rsquo;t up to snuff.</p>
<p>And then we do have one that will play on its own, it&rsquo;s heavily scripted, but it lets</p>
<p>us test, you know, every time we make a build, there&rsquo;s a bot that runs through, like, the</p>
<p>first one or two main quests.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;ll just play it.</p>
<p>That way we know, did we break anything?</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t want to waste, like, QA&rsquo;s time, like, you guys broke it again within</p>
<p>five minutes.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s for, that&rsquo;s for, like, broken stuff.</p>
<p>I wonder if you can build a bot that estimates the quality of the experience.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Okay, can you do that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Which is, like, the number, like, how boring or not boring, the boring meter.</p>
<p>How many times you die.</p>
<p>How many times you die.</p>
<p>Is death boring or exciting?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, I feel like there&rsquo;s a balance to be struck there, because you always want</p>
<p>to be in fear of death.</p>
<p>Yeah, we always, we have this chart at work we use, which is, like, if you think about</p>
<p>any game that you&rsquo;ve played that you&rsquo;ve put down, it&rsquo;s either about a frustration slash</p>
<p>confusion or boredom.</p>
<p>You got to put the player right in the middle of that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve sometimes put down games from frustration only to return, again, stronger.</p>
<p>Dark Souls?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that, that&rsquo;s, I mean, the challenge, that&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, well, I don&rsquo;t know, actually, Skyrim, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m one of those, I mean, I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of humans that you&rsquo;ve interacted with about what they enjoy, but to me, I could</p>
<p>enjoy Skyrim on every, on any difficulty level.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, all of it, so it depends.</p>
<p>The open world nature of it is what&rsquo;s really compelling.</p>
<p>Not necessarily the challenge of the particular quest and so on, but I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the same experience for everybody.</p>
<p>Do you play the survival mode?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a survival mode in Skyrim.</p>
<p>It was a creation club thing.</p>
<p>It does, like, some hunger, it does hot and cold.</p>
<p>It does some other systems that make it, you know, in our minds, a little more believable.</p>
<p>It was actually a creation club thing made by an external creator who is now full-time</p>
<p>with us.</p>
<p>So, can we actually, thinking about Starfield, thinking about Elder Scrolls VI, go through</p>
<p>the full life of a video game you&rsquo;ve created?</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s it take to take a game from the idea to find the final product?</p>
<p>What are the different steps along the way?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>Well, usually it starts with, I mean, honestly, lunchtime conversations with a number of us.</p>
<p>Hey, we think we want to do this.</p>
<p>This is what it&rsquo;s going to be like.</p>
<p>I mean, look, with an Elder Scrolls, you know you&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of when.</p>
<p>So, okay, what&rsquo;s the tone we&rsquo;re going for, right?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s it set?</p>
<p>So, we usually start with the world.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re always overlapping.</p>
<p>So, while we&rsquo;re making one game, as we&rsquo;re, you know, getting in the throes of it or wrapping</p>
<p>it, you know, probably by the midpoint of one game, we&rsquo;ve had enough conversations to</p>
<p>understand what the next one&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>What are the big ticket, like, where&rsquo;s it set?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the tone?</p>
<p>Is there a big ticket feature or two that make it really unique?</p>
<p>And then when we&rsquo;re finishing one game, we start prototyping.</p>
<p>Sorry, before that, we start concepting.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll do concept art.</p>
<p>And for one reason or another, I usually have the beginning of the game worked out.</p>
<p>I like to think about, okay, how&rsquo;s the game start?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the player do first?</p>
<p>We do music early, you know.</p>
<p>So, take Elder Scrolls VI.</p>
<p>We figure out where it&rsquo;s set.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the tone?</p>
<p>What are the big features?</p>
<p>We discuss the beginning of the game, which we&rsquo;ve had for a very long time.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s it set again?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>In Tamriel.</p>
<p>Dammit.</p>
<p>Well, at least we know we narrowed it down that.</p>
<p>That would be epic if it was, like, a portal into another dimension.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Then I like to do music.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve already done a take on the music for Elder Scrolls VI.</p>
<p>So, you can sit there with, like, the concept art and the music and you can feel it.</p>
<p>No, the music, we put in the teaser for it.</p>
<p>This was 2018.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve taken that further, obviously.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;re working on the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re then doing concepting and design for the world.</p>
<p>And then once we&rsquo;re wrapping up one game, we can really start prototyping the new one.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re usually building kind of your initial spaces.</p>
<p>And so, we do like to do, like, a first playable.</p>
<p>A smaller section of the game that we can sort of prove out and show to people, hey,</p>
<p>this is how it feels different.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like.</p>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s unique about it.</p>
<p>Then we turn that into a larger chunk when more of the team comes on, when the other</p>
<p>game is done.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s still what we call a VS, vertical slice.</p>
<p>So, you still don&rsquo;t have the full team on it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a larger chunk of the game that you can play.</p>
<p>And then once you feel good about that, you&rsquo;re going to bring on the rest of the team.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re fortunate that the other games we&rsquo;ve done are popular enough that we can be doing</p>
<p>DLC and content and those kind of things while we&rsquo;re getting the one going.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re at full production, where we&rsquo;re sort of at maximum size.</p>
<p>We just call that production.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the full production period.</p>
<p>And that, depending on the game, can run a year, two years, maybe more.</p>
<p>And then you kind of have a finalizing final six months to a year on a game, which is,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;ve built everything now.</p>
<p>And usually it needs a lot of glue, where we have a lot of very different elements that</p>
<p>maybe aren&rsquo;t clicking together the way you want outside of the regular polish for levels</p>
<p>and features.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re shaving and gluing and sticking things together so that it&rsquo;s not this schizophrenic</p>
<p>game experience that things flow from one into another.</p>
<p>In terms of story, like on that level?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really&hellip;</p>
<p>No, usually the story, the designers have done a really good job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about game features, and then how they interact with the story, or, hey, I went</p>
<p>from this experience to this experience.</p>
<p>Or picking flowers in Alchemy feels like a different game than&hellip;</p>
<p>And then how is another character referencing that?</p>
<p>And how is that intersecting with the skill system and the interface?</p>
<p>The skill system and the interface is the party host.</p>
<p>If you think about a game, most games, particularly what I like to do, is that&rsquo;s your person that</p>
<p>says, welcome, do this, go here, check this out.</p>
<p>And the skill system and the way it reacts on the HUD, the interface of the game, is</p>
<p>leading you to the next thing.</p>
<p>And once you get that flow down, and the rate at which the game is giving you activities,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re in what we describe as a game flow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not until really that last year.</p>
<p>Before that, the game flow was just&hellip;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even exist in the way that you see it in the final game.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we were working on a lot that last year.</p>
<p>So at which point is the set of skills, the skill tree, the characteristics of the role</p>
<p>playing aspect of it, when is that set?</p>
<p>The ideas?</p>
<p>We usually have it in the beginning, but it&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>We know it won&rsquo;t be done until that last year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have one, but we know it&rsquo;s going to get honed.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not until you really see, okay, how impactful is that one?</p>
<p>How much are you doing it?</p>
<p>How much are you really&hellip;</p>
<p>And the main combat ones, they always win.</p>
<p>You always know the players will drift toward the combat type skills, because every character</p>
<p>needs some amount of that.</p>
<p>But okay, well, how important is cooking?</p>
<p>How important is alchemy?</p>
<p>How important is these other type of activities?</p>
<p>And then how do you balance them where when you load up the skill menu, it isn&rsquo;t automatically</p>
<p>give me plus 10 damage?</p>
<p>How do you get the&hellip;</p>
<p>What about the combat system?</p>
<p>That does seem to be an important part of a lot of games.</p>
<p>You start in the beginning, yeah, every time.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So usually when we&rsquo;re making that first playable, it&rsquo;s an area you can go through, some amount</p>
<p>of dialogue, some amount of combat.</p>
<p>How do you get the combat right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the secret to a great combat system?</p>
<p>Well, first on a control side, helping the player when they don&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tricks you can do with magnetism in terms of the controller and where the attacks</p>
<p>go.</p>
<p>So it has to feel, the minute to minute has to feel really good in your hand.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of animation time, right?</p>
<p>And changing animation so they&rsquo;re impactful and they happen at a rate that the player</p>
<p>feels like they&rsquo;re really doing it.</p>
<p>And then ultimately, it&rsquo;s the illusion that the enemies are smart, but they really are</p>
<p>there for you to kill them, right?</p>
<p>So they do a lot of things to just let themselves get killed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not as near as smart as we can make them, because it turns out that is not fun.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a balance, but that is, I guess, a kind of AI, and it&rsquo;s a very intimate interaction</p>
<p>with an AI, because there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just very kind of shallow like a dialogue or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a time critical nature of it.</p>
<p>A lot of stuff is happening.</p>
<p>And if anything feels off, it&rsquo;s going to feel wrong.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>All the games do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unique to what we do in terms of how they handle combat scenarios.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some games that just do it extremely well in terms of, even in multiplayer where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re playing bots and most people don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Or how a multiple enemy scenario is really, you know, they don&rsquo;t all shoot you.</p>
<p>They trade off.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to wait.</p>
<p>And I was like, all right, I&rsquo;ll just wait my turn, because we don&rsquo;t want to overwhelm</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>But you feel like you&rsquo;re overwhelmed when there&rsquo;s six enemies, but, you know, a good</p>
<p>game will&hellip;</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re going to take their time.</p>
<p>Is there a science to it?</p>
<p>Is it art?</p>
<p>Is it like&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like an iterative process where you try different things.</p>
<p>You have different ideas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of animation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of timing, animation work.</p>
<p>HUD work also.</p>
<p>How does the reticule change?</p>
<p>What are the little sound effects?</p>
<p>What about like the gamified, like that is fun?</p>
<p>Again, that goes back to the winning, you know.</p>
<p>So winning is fun.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Death is not.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let the Wookiee win.</p>
<p>I like how you have to dumb down the AI to make it fun for humans.</p>
<p>Because if you didn&rsquo;t, it would just be just slaughter nonstop for all humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>What about things like you said, cooking, like crafting, making potions and poisons and</p>
<p>smithing, weapons and armor, cooking.</p>
<p>How do you get that right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an interesting&hellip;</p>
<p>A lot of games don&rsquo;t have that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So what role does that play?</p>
<p>I think we really cracked it in a way I like with Fallout 4, actually, where when we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing Elder Scrolls, we have like the flowers and things and you have alchemy and we took</p>
<p>this to, okay, if it&rsquo;s post-apocalyptic, what if everything in the world was an alchemical</p>
<p>ingredient in some kind?</p>
<p>So breaking it down to their components.</p>
<p>So when you walk around a world like that, again, we like the simulation, we like the</p>
<p>forks and the spoons and the cups and all that.</p>
<p>Okay, how can I use those to create?</p>
<p>So I love how it starts working in Fallout 4 where, okay, all these things I find, they</p>
<p>have some value in creating or crafting outside of a cup is worth one gold piece or one cap.</p>
<p>By the way, to be honest, I haven&rsquo;t played Fallout 4, played Fallout 3,</p>
<p>thought that was a legendary game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, can you make a case for Fallout 4 that I should, or should I just wait till</p>
<p>Fallout 5 and when does that come back?</p>
<p>I think you should play Fallout 4.</p>
<p>Love to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different game.</p>
<p>Skyrim is too.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>We try to make them all different.</p>
<p>They all have-</p>
<p>They are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>They all have their own tone.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are intentionally a very different tone.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that world like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout?</p>
<p>If you can just briefly take a stroll into that world, tone-wise.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s, look, in entertainment, there&rsquo;s a lot of post-apocalyptic stuff.</p>
<p>And what makes Fallout tick is the world that was left behind, the world that blew itself up,</p>
<p>this utopian world of nuclear energy and it all goes wrong.</p>
<p>So I love the American dream of that, like how they visioned the future in the 50s and that</p>
<p>blowing itself up.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like a super interesting place to explore,</p>
<p>which is why we always wanted to play in that world.</p>
<p>And it does an amazing job of sort of weaving, you know, the drama and darkness of a</p>
<p>post-apocalyptic world with B-movie humor.</p>
<p>You know, it winks at the camera sometimes, often actually.</p>
<p>And that when you&rsquo;re in that world, it just has its own unique flow and vibe</p>
<p>outside of anything else kind of in that genre.</p>
<p>So Elder Scrolls has, or at least Skyrim has some humor.</p>
<p>Has a little bit.</p>
<p>But Fallout leans into it a little more.</p>
<p>A little bit more, a little bit more.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like ironic humor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the duck and cover.</p>
<p>So get under your desk if the bomb comes and everything will be fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that type of humor.</p>
<p>So the funny thing is, I do think Fallout 3 is one of the greatest games ever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that, quote, when we started Fallout 3 in 2004,</p>
<p>we obviously had big ideas of what we could do with it.</p>
<p>And I talked to a lot of people from ex-developers to press folks to fans.</p>
<p>What made it special?</p>
<p>What are the key things you&rsquo;d want out in a new one?</p>
<p>The opinions, and I&rsquo;ll put this mildly, varied a lot.</p>
<p>But they would all end the same, like a stern father pausing for effect.</p>
<p>But do not screw it up.</p>
<p>How do you not screw up a game?</p>
<p>You have not screwed up many games, yet.</p>
<p>I mean, back to the Fallout one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was, look, I remember that.</p>
<p>We were met with a lot of skepticism in terms of,</p>
<p>oh, what are they going to do with this?</p>
<p>It was a beloved kind of isometric, turn-based role-playing game.</p>
<p>You know, awesome for when it came out.</p>
<p>And actually, it was announced.</p>
<p>We had finished Morrowind, but not announced Oblivion.</p>
<p>But because we&rsquo;d acquired the rights, we had to announce it.</p>
<p>Because I think Interplay was a public company.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>I just remember we had to announce it, and we&rsquo;re thinking there,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re going to piss off all the Elder Scrolls fans,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re announcing a Fallout game.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably going to piss off the hardcore Fallout fans,</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t make the original,</p>
<p>and clearly we&rsquo;ll probably make a different kind of game.</p>
<p>So I do remember there was a lot of concern with all of our fans</p>
<p>and fans of Fallout at the time.</p>
<p>And so I think it was pretty rewarding for us</p>
<p>that that game found the audience and success that it did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my favorite projects that I&rsquo;ve ever worked on.</p>
<p>And because it was so fresh for us,</p>
<p>and we had a very clear, like, even before we had the rights,</p>
<p>like, this is the game we&rsquo;re going to make.</p>
<p>Like, this is the kind of thing we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>And we had done Morrowind, then we were working on Oblivion.</p>
<p>And it was kind of a breath of fresh air to do it.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s kind of remarkable is Fallout 3 comes out</p>
<p>just, you know, two and a half years after Oblivion.</p>
<p>And we did all this DLC for Oblivion.</p>
<p>So we were really, really kind of prolific in how our development,</p>
<p>how it was going.</p>
<p>So I just remember enjoying making that game so much,</p>
<p>because it was, everything we were doing was new.</p>
<p>Which as to the world creation,</p>
<p>was there some innovation, like, technically that was happening?</p>
<p>The world creation, like, it was, you know,</p>
<p>obviously a different look, even though some of us,</p>
<p>very few of us had worked on the Terminator things.</p>
<p>The VAT system, the skill system.</p>
<p>And we loved the original game so much.</p>
<p>So you felt this responsibility to bring it back in a big way</p>
<p>and reintroduce it in a way that, you know,</p>
<p>as much as we could, scratch the same itch</p>
<p>when you played the original game that had the same tone.</p>
<p>Are there some favorite things to you about that world</p>
<p>that just kind of connect you to the humor?</p>
<p>Fallout 3, I love, again, I usually start with the beginning.</p>
<p>I love the beginning.</p>
<p>I love the character generation.</p>
<p>If you go, if you played it a lot, or you&rsquo;re developing it,</p>
<p>it starts to feel really long.</p>
<p>But the first time you play it, or second,</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>And this idea, it&rsquo;s a hard thing to say,</p>
<p>okay, we want you to feel like your character on the screen.</p>
<p>Even when you play like a Skyrim,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what you were doing before that.</p>
<p>But Fallout 3, you were born in the vault,</p>
<p>and you raised in the vault, and you lived in the vault,</p>
<p>but you experienced a part of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very different, when you step out,</p>
<p>I think it really, I mean, the visuals are the visuals,</p>
<p>but the emotional moment of stepping out of the vault,</p>
<p>you feel like you lived your whole life in the vault.</p>
<p>And you feel like you have a sense of your past.</p>
<p>Right, and I need to find my father.</p>
<p>We should, isn&rsquo;t it possible to have that sense</p>
<p>with like Elder Scrolls, like a life story,</p>
<p>like childhood trauma and stuff?</p>
<p>Back to the human condition.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;d have to like, look,</p>
<p>you do some of that stuff, but they go through menus.</p>
<p>You know, pick your background.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing that in Starfield.</p>
<p>Hey, pick your background.</p>
<p>What were you doing before this moment?</p>
<p>Can you pick your traumas and stuff?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mod.</p>
<p>If you wanna make a mod, you wanna make a mod.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>You go for that.</p>
<p>And then also make a mod for like a therapist.</p>
<p>But a lot of it, you know, is in your head.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna do that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna pick this background,</p>
<p>and you do these things, and you&rsquo;re sort of like,</p>
<p>this is who I was.</p>
<p>And we intentionally with Elder Scrolls,</p>
<p>kind of make it as much of a blank slate.</p>
<p>You know, Elder Scrolls is a little bit more</p>
<p>of a blank slate game to who you are,</p>
<p>which has a lot of positives,</p>
<p>and Fallout for us has been more of a,</p>
<p>this was your life before.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s who you were.</p>
<p>Go be who you wanna be,</p>
<p>but this is the background.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little more strict.</p>
<p>Now, this might reveal something about me,</p>
<p>and speaking of childhood trauma,</p>
<p>but I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of the meaningful experience</p>
<p>of a role-playing game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the development of the character</p>
<p>throughout the game,</p>
<p>but the initial character creation, like you said.</p>
<p>Is there something to that process</p>
<p>that you found to be powerful?</p>
<p>Like the design of that process,</p>
<p>because you think so much about that beginning.</p>
<p>How much should be controlled?</p>
<p>How much should be defined?</p>
<p>The interface itself?</p>
<p>The visual appearance of the character too?</p>
<p>Because I feel like that you&rsquo;re loading in,</p>
<p>you start to load in the world that you&rsquo;re about to enter</p>
<p>by creating that character, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, we think about it a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really, really good comment and question,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more than,</p>
<p>it has to set the whole stage.</p>
<p>It has to like pique your interest</p>
<p>for the world you&rsquo;re gonna enter,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done it so many different ways</p>
<p>in terms of when you actually go to make your character,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re making the choice,</p>
<p>and one of the things over time</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve wanted to avoid is people starting over.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of intentionality</p>
<p>around the types of choices you have</p>
<p>that can be undone or not undone,</p>
<p>because what game players want to is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll play it and then I&rsquo;ll make a new character,</p>
<p>but sometimes they do that</p>
<p>because they realize they made the wrong type of character.</p>
<p>And as a designer, you don&rsquo;t want that to happen.</p>
<p>So some people, and we get this comment,</p>
<p>and Elder Scrolls is like, oh, you simplified it.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>We move those choices into the gameplay</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t make this character in the beginning</p>
<p>and then eight hours later realize</p>
<p>you make a horrible mistake.</p>
<p>And so, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna start out like that.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s a really, really bad idea.</p>
<p>That, to me, is a really, really bad experience.</p>
<p>Also like life itself, but yes, go ahead.</p>
<p>But like life, okay, so you can then-</p>
<p>Fix it in game.</p>
<p>Right, I wish I had learned archery.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m gonna start tomorrow.</p>
<p>So you can do that.</p>
<p>The Skyrim character system is really designed around that.</p>
<p>All you pick is what&rsquo;s your race,</p>
<p>and that gives you some things,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s nothing you can&rsquo;t get then on your own.</p>
<p>Mostly, it sounds weird,</p>
<p>but you mostly want that beginning character generation</p>
<p>to be visual, which you then can also change in the game,</p>
<p>and some starting skills</p>
<p>that get you off to the type of play that you want,</p>
<p>but if you discover you don&rsquo;t like that type of play</p>
<p>as you play, you can move your character along.</p>
<p>So we have moved away post-Oblivion to a classless,</p>
<p>meaning you don&rsquo;t have a strict character class,</p>
<p>warrior, mage, thief, whatever, in our games.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s continuing.</p>
<p>Are you thinking of Elder Scrolls VI?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already thinking about that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>So you think of early on, like you said,</p>
<p>the first few experiences in the game,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already thinking through them.</p>
<p>Yep, yeah.</p>
<p>We know what the first few hours are like.</p>
<p>We know what the character system is basically like.</p>
<p>So tonally, what&rsquo;s the difference to you</p>
<p>between Oblivion, Skyrim,</p>
<p>Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and Elder Scrolls VI?</p>
<p>To me, man, stuff blends together.</p>
<p>But Oblivion, that&rsquo;s when you could make spells and stuff.</p>
<p>You could, you could do it in Morrowind as well.</p>
<p>Oblivion has some more guardrails on it.</p>
<p>Morrowind&rsquo;s where you can really go.</p>
<p>And Daggerfall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember if you can make spells in Arena.</p>
<p>I think you can.</p>
<p>Someone will correct me.</p>
<p>You definitely can in Daggerfall, it gets crazy.</p>
<p>Morrowind, you can somewhat.</p>
<p>And then we start putting guardrails on it</p>
<p>because people started breaking the game in certain ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was about to break the game.</p>
<p>You always want it to be-</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s like one people love in Morrowind</p>
<p>where you can make these recall stones.</p>
<p>And you could teleport to different areas,</p>
<p>which is really neat in that game.</p>
<p>It breaks so many quests.</p>
<p>And so as we, any quests,</p>
<p>we would do this exercise of designing a quest.</p>
<p>And then someone would say, and then I recall away.</p>
<p>Okay, the quest is broken.</p>
<p>And then one day someone says,</p>
<p>can we just get rid of that spell effect?</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s like, yes, please.</p>
<p>And so it allowed us to make better content.</p>
<p>So the tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent,</p>
<p>how do you create a compelling quest?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s all kinds of personalities of humans</p>
<p>that play these games, right?</p>
<p>Because I like the grind.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s, look, there&rsquo;s multiple flavors</p>
<p>of a compelling quest.</p>
<p>You know, some of them have very good upfront storytelling.</p>
<p>You just like the story and the NPC</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s giving you this task.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll go through a more handcrafted experience</p>
<p>that the designers have done a really,</p>
<p>really good job on the space.</p>
<p>It has some twist or surprise in the middle.</p>
<p>And then the ending has some, you know,</p>
<p>multiple options that the player feels like</p>
<p>they had, they got to do something.</p>
<p>They made an interesting choice.</p>
<p>But the best ones for me are actually where</p>
<p>all of that was far more open-ended.</p>
<p>The how I am going to accomplish this task</p>
<p>is completely up to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to find some ingenious solution.</p>
<p>A silly, this sounds very basic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to sound quite cliche and silly.</p>
<p>Go find me five daedric hearts or whatever,</p>
<p>like find me X of something that&rsquo;s hard to get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very simple set.</p>
<p>You can give a simple story set up for that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not telling the player where to get those.</p>
<p>And I think, now, where could I get those?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve actually find those to be just as rewarding</p>
<p>as the really handcrafted, well-done,</p>
<p>little bit more linear with an interesting choice</p>
<p>at the end, if those objects are in the world</p>
<p>in some, you know, believable way</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s usually some challenge at getting them.</p>
<p>How do you place objects in a world in an interesting way?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a big part.</p>
<p>We have a level design, you cannot, people,</p>
<p>if they only knew how much we spend on,</p>
<p>we have a clutter group, a group of people who clutter.</p>
<p>Like we, like.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s clutter?</p>
<p>Clutter is all the stuff around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like interior decorators.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For treasure and stuff and trash.</p>
<p>And they go through every space and they clutter it.</p>
<p>Our level designers think about it a lot.</p>
<p>These also become landmarks for the player.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re walking through a space and,</p>
<p>oh, this is the place with this.</p>
<p>And there is a logic to making a good level.</p>
<p>As they say with, even if you walk by</p>
<p>like a little T intersection,</p>
<p>that becomes like a decision point in the player&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Like, oh, I didn&rsquo;t go down that way.</p>
<p>But the more you do that, it looks easy on paper.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re playing a game,</p>
<p>you actually kind of want to limit those</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s trying to keep track</p>
<p>of all these decision points, then they get lost.</p>
<p>And yes, we have maps, but anytime the player&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to check a map in a place like that,</p>
<p>I feel that it&rsquo;s more of like a backstop for certain players.</p>
<p>If we, if they need to check the map,</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;ve kind of failed.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a momentum to it.</p>
<p>Just pulls, pulls them in.</p>
<p>And you know, you played a lot of games.</p>
<p>You played a lot of levels where you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little confused or I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then you play other levels where like, man, I just,</p>
<p>I, yeah, it was great.</p>
<p>I went through it.</p>
<p>It was well-balanced.</p>
<p>I knew where I was going and it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to ever be mazy.</p>
<p>As long as you know where you&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>as long as you know, you made those choices,</p>
<p>then it feels fine.</p>
<p>But as far as the treasure and all of the loot,</p>
<p>it is really an art.</p>
<p>We will not do enough clutter.</p>
<p>And then we will over clutter.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s too much stuff everywhere.</p>
<p>And then we declutter every single game.</p>
<p>I wish we got better at it.</p>
<p>It would save us a lot of time.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re constantly going by feel like this is not,</p>
<p>this is too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Because the other thing is, look, it creates,</p>
<p>people want to pick everything up.</p>
<p>They want to click everything.</p>
<p>So if you have too many things of importance in a room,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it actually makes you feel tight as a player.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, well, I need, I&rsquo;m basically an idiot</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t pick all this stuff up.</p>
<p>You probably felt this way.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And like the moment where you decide that you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve clicked so many things in this room.</p>
<p>I actually am going to leave that ammo canister there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you feel like a dope.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably experienced it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But also you have a joy from if there&rsquo;s not many items</p>
<p>and you found the one and you got it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And you feel good.</p>
<p>I got it.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s finding like, oh, I stuck my head in this corner</p>
<p>and I picked this lock and I opened this locker</p>
<p>and oh, there was this thing I&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about like rare and rare items?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an art, even more so of an art.</p>
<p>I will say we have a ways to go there in terms of finding</p>
<p>the right drop rate for special items.</p>
<p>We call them your epic, rare, legendary.</p>
<p>You look at games like so many games do it.</p>
<p>And there are ones that you just play and love</p>
<p>because they have it down.</p>
<p>You know, Destiny, Destiny two is great at it.</p>
<p>Diablo, a series I love, you know,</p>
<p>famously Diablo three, which I think is great.</p>
<p>And they did an update.</p>
<p>It mostly just changed the loot drops.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like this whole new experience.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really, real art to it.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;re still learning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still learning a lot and we&rsquo;re trying to get better at it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one of those things where it drives you</p>
<p>through the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to get the treasure.</p>
<p>Diablo and Skyrim have this interesting quality</p>
<p>of being extremely popular.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lore around like rare items.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, it changes the dynamic of like,</p>
<p>you could afford to have really rare items.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then, and then somebody finds it</p>
<p>and that becomes like a thing.</p>
<p>I mean, as you release a game, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a, I mean,</p>
<p>a lot of people play and they start sharing stories</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting because that&rsquo;s part of the game experience</p>
<p>is the stories of others, right?</p>
<p>For us, a hundred percent, because we&rsquo;ve been classically</p>
<p>with most of our stuff, single player,</p>
<p>that that water cooler shared experience,</p>
<p>we would have a thing like, we call them,</p>
<p>did you know moments?</p>
<p>Like we got to have a bunch.</p>
<p>So you meet someone, they do, what are you doing?</p>
<p>And then they say, did you know?</p>
<p>If you go here and do this, what did you know?</p>
<p>And that to us is where a lot of our community</p>
<p>has been sharing their stories.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what you can do.</p>
<p>Has there ever been a temptation to create</p>
<p>not a single player game?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gigantic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s open world.</p>
<p>Well, we did Fallout 76.</p>
<p>We have Elder Scrolls Online, not a game I created,</p>
<p>but look, that started as more classic MMO.</p>
<p>Know the folks, they&rsquo;re part of our company</p>
<p>who made that game.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s insanely, insanely popular.</p>
<p>It is, okay.</p>
<p>So I should try it out.</p>
<p>They do some great storytelling quests.</p>
<p>Like the actual mechanics aren&rsquo;t the same as Skyrim,</p>
<p>but the world is awesome.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve just done an incredible job.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s about to be 10 years for that game as well.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, you know, great community around that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t played,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a mobile Fallout game, right?</p>
<p>I need to play that.</p>
<p>I was thinking of playing Diablo Mobile too.</p>
<p>I mean, you can debate the monetization,</p>
<p>but I would not, it&rsquo;s, I think they did a phenomenal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really fun.</p>
<p>On Fallout?</p>
<p>Diablo.</p>
<p>Oh, Diablo?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, Fallout, I definitely recommend that one.</p>
<p>Fallout Shelter, completely different game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Diablo Immortal is, I was very, very impressed with that.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>On the mobile?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the challenge of designing a game for mobile</p>
<p>versus the PC and console?</p>
<p>Well, obviously the screen size, right?</p>
<p>Is that what you feel first?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the fundamental change in the philosophy of design?</p>
<p>Does it constrain, does it change the tone of the game?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve done a few things,</p>
<p>and we have a new mobile game that we&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t announced yet that I&rsquo;m in love with.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that you approach on mobile.</p>
<p>Now, I can give you sort of the classic mobile gaming thing,</p>
<p>and then what we do.</p>
<p>You know, a classic mobile gaming</p>
<p>is really for short play sessions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because for the amount of people you&rsquo;re going to get,</p>
<p>the number that have the amount of time to sit there</p>
<p>for a long time and play it,</p>
<p>like a console game or a PC game is lower</p>
<p>because people are playing mobile games on the move or whatever.</p>
<p>And how it onboards you,</p>
<p>because obviously most of them are free.</p>
<p>So the tutorial, how the tutorial works,</p>
<p>how it gets you into the game,</p>
<p>because you haven&rsquo;t bought it,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t done this investment of buying it</p>
<p>and then saying, no, I&rsquo;m going to learn it.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>So really understanding how they get into the game.</p>
<p>Those two things are really the magic to mobile gaming.</p>
<p>We have found though with our games,</p>
<p>you know, particularly Fallout Shelter,</p>
<p>people will sit there for an hour or two.</p>
<p>Like they will just sit there and play it.</p>
<p>Like large numbers of people will play it for hours a day.</p>
<p>So there is a more, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>addicting element to the mobile.</p>
<p>Because I guess you can spend more time with it.</p>
<p>And if you look at, you know, if you look at kids these days,</p>
<p>they can stare at their phone for hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all they do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where they watch everything.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also like a demographic thing.</p>
<p>The younger audience,</p>
<p>they would rather sit and stare at their phone</p>
<p>than play it on a big screen.</p>
<p>I would just love to sort of list out</p>
<p>throughout human history,</p>
<p>the evolution of sentences that began with,</p>
<p>if you look at kids these days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>The kids, the kids of the kids these days</p>
<p>will probably be talking about,</p>
<p>be doing like virtual reality.</p>
<p>Like I love mobile games though.</p>
<p>I play a ton of them.</p>
<p>I am like the game,</p>
<p>my favorite game this year is Marvel Snap.</p>
<p>This card game from the folks who did Hearthstone.</p>
<p>You should really play it.</p>
<p>If you like, do you like card games?</p>
<p>I, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you like superheroes?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s genius.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like superheroes?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t like superheroes.</p>
<p>I never understood, listen, this never,</p>
<p>this is growing up in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>What, I don&rsquo;t understand the, all right.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t understand you&rsquo;re wearing a costume.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s silly to me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, so you have to suspend,</p>
<p>like you have to be able to immerse yourself.</p>
<p>And for some reason, there&rsquo;s something about costumes.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get me.</p>
<p>But then again, I&rsquo;m like into elves and dragons.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>I think I get it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the rest, at least the American,</p>
<p>the Western world disagrees with me.</p>
<p>So even Batman, you have like little ears,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Well, back to Elder Scrolls Starfield.</p>
<p>So one thing I didn&rsquo;t ask you about,</p>
<p>when you look at the timeline of five, six, seven, eight years,</p>
<p>whatever it is to create a game,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of the deadline internally,</p>
<p>not publicly announced?</p>
<p>Keeps you honest.</p>
<p>Do you try to keep in your own brain a deadline</p>
<p>for the team, a deadline?</p>
<p>Yeah, all the time.</p>
<p>And when you set that deadline early in the development,</p>
<p>do you try to set deadline,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s really tough to reach?</p>
<p>No, we try to make it like,</p>
<p>hey, this is our best guess.</p>
<p>If you make it tough to reach,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of, you know, you&rsquo;re going to miss it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arbitrary.</p>
<p>We really try to, you know, keep ourselves honest</p>
<p>because it will let you know where you&rsquo;re at, right?</p>
<p>When I first playable,</p>
<p>we want to be done with prototyping</p>
<p>or designed by this date.</p>
<p>We want to have a first playable this date.</p>
<p>We want to have this.</p>
<p>But look, you know, things happen.</p>
<p>Pandemic happens.</p>
<p>People go home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s throws everything off or, you know,</p>
<p>what you needed to do</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not just like making a game</p>
<p>and then moving everybody on, you know,</p>
<p>what you needed to do.</p>
<p>Like Skyrim was so popular.</p>
<p>We kept people on that game for longer.</p>
<p>So it delayed a little bit.</p>
<p>We were doing a Fallout 4 at the time</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>hey, we really shouldn&rsquo;t move the people</p>
<p>on the Fallout yet</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re doing these things in Skyrim and we should.</p>
<p>So it just sort of keeps you honest</p>
<p>for where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>Does it get super stressful as you get closer?</p>
<p>You try to avoid announcing anything?</p>
<p>Is there a temptation to announce?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve done it all ways, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve announced, you know, Starfield.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty, you know, loud with a release date</p>
<p>that we then had to delay.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Was that tough?</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>But it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>How do you know it&rsquo;s the right thing?</p>
<p>Like when you sat down and looked at it,</p>
<p>this is not ready?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an exact science,</p>
<p>but you can look at what needs to be done</p>
<p>and the amount of time you have.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;ve done it in the past</p>
<p>where we can get it done.</p>
<p>We believe we can.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re fighting that personal belief</p>
<p>that you can get something done.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of things that go into release date</p>
<p>with marketing and publishing.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;ve reached a point where on Starfield</p>
<p>where it was pretty clear to us</p>
<p>even though you want to say you can get it done,</p>
<p>that the risk involved with that to the fans,</p>
<p>to the game, to the team, to the company,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re part of Xbox now, to everybody,</p>
<p>was we should really move it</p>
<p>and give it the time it needs.</p>
<p>So you mentioned part of Xbox.</p>
<p>Microsoft bought Bethesda and ZeniMax</p>
<p>for $7.5 billion.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s it like joining the Xbox team?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, I think, written about it.</p>
<p>What are the exciting aspects of that?</p>
<p>You know, when your company goes through a change like that,</p>
<p>no matter what it is,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s somebody that you&rsquo;ve worked with for a long time,</p>
<p>you never know what you&rsquo;re in for.</p>
<p>You hope.</p>
<p>And I had worked with them for,</p>
<p>since we started doing console stuff with Morrowind was,</p>
<p>they came to us, came to me and,</p>
<p>hey, you should make this game for the Xbox.</p>
<p>And so when they were making that console,</p>
<p>had a great experience with them.</p>
<p>And then on the 360 with Oblivion.</p>
<p>And so I guess the point is,</p>
<p>we felt that we had a very good relationship</p>
<p>with everybody there</p>
<p>and we understood what their culture was,</p>
<p>but you never really know.</p>
<p>And I mean this honestly, it&rsquo;s been awesome</p>
<p>that the culture inside of Microsoft and Xbox</p>
<p>that people see from the outside is the culture inside,</p>
<p>the way they talk about players,</p>
<p>the way they&rsquo;ll invest in the players,</p>
<p>the risks they&rsquo;ll take,</p>
<p>the thoughtfulness from Phil Spencer on down</p>
<p>has been, you know, Phil really, really lucky.</p>
<p>And then a game like Starfield where,</p>
<p>look, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of success</p>
<p>with the games that you talked about,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve never been kind of the platform seller.</p>
<p>You know, the game for a platform for a period of time.</p>
<p>And so, you know, there is a lot of pressure there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of responsibility there</p>
<p>to make sure we deliver for everybody.</p>
<p>Is there a chance that Starfield is exclusive to Xbox?</p>
<p>It is, it is exclusive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s officially ready.</p>
<p>Yep, yes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, I get it.</p>
<p>So extra pressure also creating a new world.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s new, but keep in mind</p>
<p>for us that exclusivity is not unique,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;ve done PlayStation stuff.</p>
<p>And I think the PlayStation 5 is just an insane machine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done a great job</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had great success on PlayStation.</p>
<p>We were traditionally a PC developers in the beginning.</p>
<p>We transitioned to Xbox, became our lead platform.</p>
<p>Like Morrowind&rsquo;s basically exclusive to Xbox.</p>
<p>Oblivion was exclusive to Xbox for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Skyrim DLC was exclusive.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done a lot of like our initial stuff is all Xbox.</p>
<p>So we get into development and saying we&rsquo;re focused on Xbox</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not abnormal for us in any way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been kind of the norm.</p>
<p>And from a development side, I, you know,</p>
<p>I like the ability to focus.</p>
<p>So our ability to focus and say, and have help from them,</p>
<p>you know, the top engineers at Xbox to say,</p>
<p>we are going to make this look incredible</p>
<p>on the new systems is like, from my standpoint,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just awesome.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference in creating the console versus the PC?</p>
<p>I also have to admit, I&rsquo;ve never, is this shameful?</p>
<p>Actually, you should recommend to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never played Skyrim or any of the games</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve created on Xbox.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And on console, I played, I managed to play very little Xbox.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, look, there&rsquo;s the obvious interface part</p>
<p>between mouse and keyboard and then a controller.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re looking at hardware, PCs, it&rsquo;s tough, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re looking at, well, you know,</p>
<p>what are their driver versions?</p>
<p>What kind of monitor do they have?</p>
<p>What is the actual refresh rate of X, Y, and Z?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re used to it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But if, you know, anyone will tell you,</p>
<p>give me the hardware that I know I&rsquo;m writing it for.</p>
<p>You know this.</p>
<p>And the Series X is just a incredible machine.</p>
<p>And now-</p>
<p>You know what it is.</p>
<p>You know-</p>
<p>You know what it is.</p>
<p>And now that we&rsquo;re part of Xbox, getting, you know,</p>
<p>the people who built it to show you how to make it really,</p>
<p>really dance is just awesome.</p>
<p>Is there a case to be made?</p>
<p>Do you get people that enjoy, people that do both PC and Xbox,</p>
<p>that enjoy Xbox more?</p>
<p>Like if they have a choice, do they enjoy it?</p>
<p>I think that depends on&hellip;</p>
<p>And look, now that you can kind of cross,</p>
<p>you can take your save and go between and all those things.</p>
<p>You can?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Depends on if-</p>
<p>For which games?</p>
<p>So for Skyrim?</p>
<p>If you have the Game Pass PC version of it versus Steam.</p>
<p>Not via Steam right now.</p>
<p>Not via Steam.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s the Game Pass.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like learning about this.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a Microsoft game.</p>
<p>So this is gonna be on Game Pass.</p>
<p>And then you can, yeah, if you can take it from PC through Game Pass.</p>
<p>But I think it depends on like, for me, like what&rsquo;s my physical mood?</p>
<p>Do I want to lean back on a sofa?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like the actual physicality of it is what determines where I want to play.</p>
<p>Do I want to be two feet from a thing right now?</p>
<p>And sometimes I like that.</p>
<p>I am more of a console player just because I sit at my PC at work all day.</p>
<p>Like I play a lot of video games.</p>
<p>So when I get home and I want to play something,</p>
<p>I was like, I am a sofa screen controller person.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a ridiculous question.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve created some of the greatest games ever.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, the question would be, what&rsquo;s the best game of all time?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Just give me a second.</p>
<p>Tetris.</p>
<p>Tetris.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Have you read the book on Tetris?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You should read it.</p>
<p>Basically someone who grew up in Russia.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s an interesting story.</p>
<p>The fact that there&rsquo;s a book about Tetris is fascinating.</p>
<p>Is there a book about Mario?</p>
<p>I would love to find out more.</p>
<p>But I think I would put personally, I would put Skyrim.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take that.</p>
<p>Good answer.</p>
<p>At number one for me, which is tough.</p>
<p>However you put it, because you could also make the case out of the Elder Scrolls series.</p>
<p>Like, what do you actually value more?</p>
<p>If you put Tetris and Super Mario up there,</p>
<p>then like the credit goes to Morrowind maybe over Skyrim.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the biggest leaps are.</p>
<p>But overall, I think it&rsquo;s Skyrim.</p>
<p>But for you, if you&rsquo;re not allowed to pick any of the games you were involved with,</p>
<p>what are some interesting candidates for you that are just games that</p>
<p>inspired the world, impacted the world,</p>
<p>shook the world in terms of what video games are able to do?</p>
<p>Well, first, I&rsquo;m just sort of like hearing you say that you think Skyrim is the best game of all</p>
<p>time is quite like, thank you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an incredible thing to hear.</p>
<p>And when I think about, well, there&rsquo;s a couple of answers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s ones that are like personal to me.</p>
<p>Ultima 7 is probably my&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you talk about Ultima?</p>
<p>You said that as an inspiration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never crossed that world.</p>
<p>Well, it was&hellip;</p>
<p>What kind of game is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a role-playing game.</p>
<p>You know, circa 1992, 93, 94.</p>
<p>Ultima Online, first, you know, really visual online world in that way.</p>
<p>But for me, that was a virtual fantasy world where I had&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, you could bake bread.</p>
<p>You could pick all this stuff up.</p>
<p>I mean, anyone who&rsquo;s played Ultimas and plays our stuff can see the</p>
<p>kind of touchstones and callbacks to that or inspirations.</p>
<p>And the other thing that I loved about Ultima was&hellip;</p>
<p>They were all different.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That they iterated, and there weren&rsquo;t necessarily what I&rsquo;ll call a plus one sequel</p>
<p>outside of Ultima 7 Part 2, clearly a plus one sequel.</p>
<p>But they each had their own tone.</p>
<p>I love, like, the boxes.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s something that we get into as well.</p>
<p>I love this idea that a game also is this tangible thing.</p>
<p>Oh, when you buy it.</p>
<p>You buy, you know, the cardboard boxes and the way they were designed,</p>
<p>and Ultima 7 is black, and Ultima 8&rsquo;s the fiery gate.</p>
<p>The paintings on them, and I just, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Does that break your heart a little bit that that culture is a bit gone?</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also why I like&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, this goes to video gaming or any other digital things,</p>
<p>where digital ownership has great value to people.</p>
<p>So, I like looking at my collections of games, even digitally.</p>
<p>I want to see nice, you know, in the same way you want to see nice album art.</p>
<p>I want to see nice cover art for our games.</p>
<p>And we spend a lot of time in them.</p>
<p>So that, you know, take a look at Elder Scrolls and Morrowind Oblivion and Skyrim.</p>
<p>We want those boxes to look good next to each other.</p>
<p>Going back to the video games, you know, I always mention Tetris,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Obviously, I love virtual worlds and those kind of things.</p>
<p>But for the time and what an interactive, like, video game,</p>
<p>sort of the simplest form, I sort of think you can put Tetris in front of just about anybody,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll enjoy it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got some moment of challenge, and it&rsquo;s just so elegant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, to me, this very pure game that only works because it&rsquo;s a video game.</p>
<p>And I think mobile games figured out some of the magic of Tetris, the simple&hellip;</p>
<p>Some of them have, yeah.</p>
<p>But Tetris did it a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You can really create that immersive experience without&hellip;</p>
<p>But for me, you know, the ultimate civilization, as far as, you know, a grand strategy game.</p>
<p>Pac-Man, I mentioned, in terms of bringing games into the mainstream in a way that captured people</p>
<p>that nothing before it had.</p>
<p>Super Mario, Donkey Kong, everything.</p>
<p>Nintendo, probably the best game makers in the world still.</p>
<p>They know who they are.</p>
<p>They know what they want to do.</p>
<p>Always in awe of what they create.</p>
<p>I got to ask you about a game I haven&rsquo;t played, but people put up there</p>
<p>as one of the greats, Zelda Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>Have you gotten a chance to play it?</p>
<p>A lot of it, yes, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>What do you think about&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a very different experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played other Zeldas than the open worlds you&rsquo;ve created, but it is also an open world.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite Zelda, because I obviously like open world stuff.</p>
<p>And the one thing that they do really, really well is they don&rsquo;t constrain you.</p>
<p>Even some of the things we do constrain you a little bit more.</p>
<p>Zelda says, here&rsquo;s the whole thing.</p>
<p>And you are constrained by the actual player abilities you haven&rsquo;t earned yet,</p>
<p>not some arbitrary barriers.</p>
<p>And so I think they just did a phenomenal job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a magical game.</p>
<p>It really feels open.</p>
<p>Because it truly is, yes.</p>
<p>What about&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I just like asking about some open worlds.</p>
<p>A very different one is the world of either Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p>Both love.</p>
<p>I would put GTA 3, Grand Theft Auto 3 up there with the landmark, kind of,</p>
<p>usher in the open world.</p>
<p>When that comes out on the PlayStation 2, even though there was GTA 1 and 2,</p>
<p>this was an all new thing with the mobster storytelling.</p>
<p>Is that the first 3D version, I guess?</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>Then Vice City is kind of a fast follow, which could be my favorite one.</p>
<p>I loved all the Grand Theft Autos.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re really phenomenally well-made games.</p>
<p>Same with Red Dead.</p>
<p>I think Red Dead Redemption 1 could be my favorite story.</p>
<p>Like, highly recommend finishing that game.</p>
<p>So you like both the story.</p>
<p>You like the grittiness of that.</p>
<p>Because they have a bit of the&hellip;</p>
<p>I guess if you like the fallout, there&rsquo;s the humor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the lighthearted humor of it.</p>
<p>But also the brutality of human nature is in there too.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>And also some of the fun they create with the music when you drive and stuff like that.</p>
<p>They create a world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tone.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very strong tone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very strong tone.</p>
<p>You know, the satire on the world is just so well done.</p>
<p>The gameplay is great.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve just done a phenomenal job.</p>
<p>Is there any others that pop to mind?</p>
<p>Portal.</p>
<p>Portal, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another weird creation.</p>
<p>I could just sit here and list games forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying this.</p>
<p>Hearthstone&rsquo;s a game I love.</p>
<p>I love all types.</p>
<p>College football.</p>
<p>NCAA football was my favorite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I would say this is a great role-playing game.</p>
<p>Oh, you would actually keep getting role-playing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a role-playing game because I have all these characters.</p>
<p>I have like, you know, 60 characters and they&rsquo;re all leveling up.</p>
<p>And then I have to play them.</p>
<p>And then the college ones, I like college football.</p>
<p>They graduate, so you lose your players.</p>
<p>And then they stop making the series.</p>
<p>And I know the folks at EA and they will say, I have bugged them.</p>
<p>When is this coming?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing it, so it&rsquo;s finally coming back.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>What would you say is the greatest sports game of all time?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s NCAA football.</p>
<p>You have to pick the year.</p>
<p>NCAA versus Madden?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s more teams.</p>
<p>You get the college, you know, fight songs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more pageantry.</p>
<p>And the players turn over.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only there for four seasons.</p>
<p>So you have to&hellip;</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s more dynamic.</p>
<p>So you like variety versus&hellip;</p>
<p>So what was the last one?</p>
<p>2014, maybe it was?</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t like FIFA and&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, FIFA is incredible.</p>
<p>Just look, I&rsquo;m a college football fan.</p>
<p>They give you that fantasy.</p>
<p>If you like European football slash soccer, FIFA is incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that game too.</p>
<p>Have you been paying attention to the game design of that world, of those worlds?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the thing people, I think, with those kind of games, it is really like&hellip;</p>
<p>Or racing games.</p>
<p>Forza, put up there.</p>
<p>I love Forza.</p>
<p>Play them all.</p>
<p>When you have to recreate something that&rsquo;s real in the real world, say it&rsquo;s cars or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sports games, everybody knows how it should work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really difficult task when people know how it should work.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re going to balance it for single player.</p>
<p>The multiplayer parts of it get very, very competitive.</p>
<p>And, you know, in many respects, you&rsquo;re forced to put out a new version every year.</p>
<p>And I say forced in quotes because they&rsquo;re, you know, you count them as big updates.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very, it&rsquo;s a much more difficult development process than I think people understand</p>
<p>and how hard those teams work.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who do it, and I think they just do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed them all.</p>
<p>I buy Madden every year.</p>
<p>Yeah, every single year.</p>
<p>Yeah, they do refresh it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a feeling of freshness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, there have been years where it feels like less was done and more was done,</p>
<p>but I enjoy it every year.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>What does a perfectly productive day in the life of Todd Howard look like?</p>
<p>So maybe not perfectly, but just like a perfectly average productive day.</p>
<p>Are you a morning person, evening person?</p>
<p>Is it chaos?</p>
<p>Is it pretty regular schedule?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a good, I&rsquo;m in a good flow right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still doing a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s things I&rsquo;m like executive producing and then, you know, Starfield I&rsquo;m directing.</p>
<p>So I sort of view that as that&rsquo;s an everyday thing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I get to do a lot of stuff from look at the TV show we&rsquo;re making and this</p>
<p>Indiana Jones game that&rsquo;s being developed, the machine game.</p>
<p>So we have to look at that.</p>
<p>But, you know, the best really day or where I feel it&rsquo;s fulfilling is</p>
<p>get to play some of a game.</p>
<p>The game will say Starfield.</p>
<p>Get to play some of Starfield.</p>
<p>Look at the problem set of what it is doing and then get in a room with the other developers</p>
<p>that I work closely with and we solve that problem together.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the most rewarding thing when you can say, okay, what do we want this to do?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the real player experience we want?</p>
<p>What are all the pieces in front of us where you know the actual tangible pieces as opposed</p>
<p>to the beginning, the pie in the sky part is always fun, but it&rsquo;s like anything is possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun, but it&rsquo;s not rewarding in the same way because you haven&rsquo;t solved something.</p>
<p>Whereas these are the elements you have to play with.</p>
<p>How do we make this all work together?</p>
<p>And you come out of it at the end of the day like, now that feels great.</p>
<p>So brainstorming about specific big picture, both big picture and very specific detail</p>
<p>of a game that&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s not working, you want to fix it, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Because you feel like, okay, you&rsquo;ve made tangible progress on the actual build of the game.</p>
<p>Where something you played in the beginning of the day didn&rsquo;t feel great,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve figured out a solution with a group of people.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s always with a group.</p>
<p>And then the next day you&rsquo;re like, yeah, that worked out.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s on the team?</p>
<p>Is it designers, engineers?</p>
<p>All the above.</p>
<p>Artists, voice over folks?</p>
<p>So internal to the studio, it&rsquo;s a lot of programming, a lot of art.</p>
<p>You have design, which breaks into some quest design, writing, systems design,</p>
<p>who are like doing all the treasure and the loot and the skill systems.</p>
<p>And then level design is making the spaces like those that you&rsquo;ll play through.</p>
<p>Production is a big part of it.</p>
<p>The producers who organize everything.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if I mentioned art, a lot of artists.</p>
<p>QA staff as well.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hugely valuable in saying, hey, we broke your game in these magical ways.</p>
<p>What are you going to do about it?</p>
<p>Is the loot design team still hiring?</p>
<p>How do I apply?</p>
<p>That seems like the most fun job.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>I mean, all of this seems like a super fun job.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>Then you have audio, and it by far is the greatest job you could possibly have.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re into like technology, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into storytelling and creativity and art, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really the gaming, you know, the combination of that.</p>
<p>And like I mentioned to you offline, I think of video games,</p>
<p>I mean, to me, it&rsquo;s brought thousands of hours of happiness.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re designing the game, whatever you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you have a part to play in a thing that&rsquo;s going to bring</p>
<p>like millions, hundreds of millions of hours of happiness to people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy, right?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to play you saying that back to our team.</p>
<p>Because people forget.</p>
<p>Your head&rsquo;s down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to solve these problems.</p>
<p>And then you do forget how many people it touches.</p>
<p>Like even tiny decisions.</p>
<p>You make tiny little things.</p>
<p>You create.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I wish there was a way to like&hellip;</p>
<p>I would notice things in a video game and it&rsquo;s like, huh, okay.</p>
<p>Like it feels good, but you don&rsquo;t get that signal.</p>
<p>The creator doesn&rsquo;t get that signal.</p>
<p>I wish they did.</p>
<p>I guess you could get that signal by, you know,</p>
<p>why is Lux stuck in this room, like digging through the loot?</p>
<p>We do now get a lot of good data on what the players are doing.</p>
<p>Enjoying and not?</p>
<p>Well, we know where they&rsquo;ve been and where they&rsquo;ve died</p>
<p>and how long they play in certain sections.</p>
<p>And we can sort of tell outside of people</p>
<p>just telling us on forums or calling or other things.</p>
<p>We can tell for some data where people are dropping off or having a,</p>
<p>you know, we can tell if there&rsquo;s a key frustration point.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about making people feel like human feelings when they play?</p>
<p>Like designing, like make them feel fear or excitement, anger, longing, loneliness.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>The big one I like to say is the video games give you is pride outside of other,</p>
<p>you know, if you watch movies or things like that,</p>
<p>like, yeah, but you never think like, look what I did.</p>
<p>And that feeling of like accomplishment and pride in what you did</p>
<p>or you overcame, you talked about going back to a game that like,</p>
<p>those are real feelings of like accomplishment that I&rsquo;ve felt in games that I&rsquo;ve played.</p>
<p>And when we get to see a player feel that, it&rsquo;s really, really special.</p>
<p>The other one is there is a, you know, there is an escape</p>
<p>or to be someone else that&rsquo;s more powerful in our games that you aren&rsquo;t in real life</p>
<p>that gives you a confidence or a perspective.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing one next week, we&rsquo;ve done a number of make a wish visits,</p>
<p>kids who could wish for anything and they want to come and I want to see the next game</p>
<p>and meet the creators and see how you do it and they come with their family.</p>
<p>And it is like the greatest thing that we do and it reminds you of like how important it is.</p>
<p>And the other really awesome thing is that you can see like the family change by the end of the day,</p>
<p>like they don&rsquo;t, they didn&rsquo;t even realize what it meant to their child or what went into it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, that to me is like been involved with that foundation for a number of years</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been really good, you know, reminder of how lucky we are.</p>
<p>And in general, for young people, that sense of accomplishment is hard to find.</p>
<p>Yeah, where they don&rsquo;t, not everybody has it in the outlets that real life provides.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the thing, I mean, the world is cruel to when you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>Nobody takes you seriously, you don&rsquo;t get like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you, everybody always wants to grow up and get old as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the hardest, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And then video games allow you, I mean, to build that sense of confidence,</p>
<p>a sense of pride and something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when people talk down to video games, like it&rsquo;s a culture and so on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not, it misses out on that really deeply meaningful thing.</p>
<p>Especially with like single player, there&rsquo;s some darker aspects to multiplayer that people</p>
<p>create communities and, you know, it can go off the rails a bit, but the actual experience of the</p>
<p>game, especially one where you stick with for a while, that&rsquo;s really beautiful.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for those same young folks, given that your life is an interesting one,</p>
<p>given what kind of degree you got and being a legendary game designer,</p>
<p>do you have advice for young folks in high school, maybe college,</p>
<p>how to have a career or a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Well, you have to find something that you love so much that it&rsquo;s never going to feel like a job.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t do it for money, don&rsquo;t do it for, find something you love and</p>
<p>uh, the rest of it will come. It won&rsquo;t be a straight path. And do not ever underestimate</p>
<p>yourself. It&rsquo;s going to take hard work, but the worst thing that young people do is think they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t accomplish something or they underestimate themselves. And maybe those first few times</p>
<p>through where they do fail, if they love it enough, they&rsquo;re going to be resilient and push</p>
<p>past that. Anyone who&rsquo;s had success or gotten somewhere, it&rsquo;s been, they&rsquo;ve had those times,</p>
<p>right? And they&rsquo;ve stayed resilient because they love it so much that this is what they want to do.</p>
<p>When you do it for other reasons, I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to work out the same.</p>
<p>Did you have low points in your life, dark points where your mind went to a dark place,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s struggling to get a job at Bethesda Softworks or maybe with a Red Guard flop or</p>
<p>where you kind of started to doubt yourself or any of that?</p>
<p>Well, I think what&rsquo;s weird looking back, I was so, I was always so like in love with doing this</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t view them as like dark per se. Looking back, I was like, oh, that was,</p>
<p>I just wanted to, okay, let me find a way to make this work.</p>
<p>Even when it&rsquo;s hard and it&rsquo;s failing and all that kind of stuff, you just kind of like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a problem before you to solve.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, when I started at Bethesda, I don&rsquo;t know, my father had moved nearby to the</p>
<p>office. I was moving and, you know, I slept on a sofa. Like, I didn&rsquo;t care. Like, I don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>a bedroom. I&rsquo;ll just, I&rsquo;ll sleep on the sofa and work there. That&rsquo;s all I want to do. When the</p>
<p>company almost went out of business, it was, well, I hope it doesn&rsquo;t. I feel somewhat responsible,</p>
<p>but hey, let&rsquo;s, okay, that&rsquo;s a learning lesson. Let&rsquo;s go. I think I was pretty resilient to it</p>
<p>all. Fallout 76, like, really bad launch and okay, what did we do wrong? What can we learn?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go at it. Now it&rsquo;s a success. But those kind of ups and downs for the length of developments</p>
<p>that we have, you know, people don&rsquo;t see them, but we have them, you know, all the time. And so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that sort of belief that, you know, with the team having done it time and time again to know</p>
<p>that, nah, we&rsquo;re gonna make it as good as we possibly can. And whatever we&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>now, when we solve it and we get it out and, you know, we see the millions of people who love it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all worth it. And you&rsquo;re getting into new spaces. First of all, new worlds with Starfield,</p>
<p>but also new, I saw the TV show you&rsquo;re working on, on Fallout with Amazon. What&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>Worlds that you created in the digital realm becoming, going on the screen?</p>
<p>Yeah, people asked, you know, I can remember 10 years ago after Fallout 3 was a hit,</p>
<p>you know, the movie producers coming and, hey, we think this would make a great movie,</p>
<p>and taking a lot of meetings. And I think, you know, most people would jump at that,</p>
<p>like, sweet. And I sort of paused and like, I don&rsquo;t know, what is this gonna do?</p>
<p>I feel like they&rsquo;re gonna like synthesize. I met great people, like well-known creatives,</p>
<p>like, you know, it&rsquo;s gonna get synthesized into this two-hour, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>seeing the great thing here yet. So, you know, I think the advent of television</p>
<p>in terms of what it&rsquo;s become, you know, nowadays with big-budget TV series that kind of came up</p>
<p>again and met with people, and Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy who do Westworld, and</p>
<p>I always love the work he did writing Interstellar and the dark, like, movies I just love.</p>
<p>Wait, Jonathan Nolan is involved with this?</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s the EP and he&rsquo;s directed the first-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s epic. Westworld&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, this is awesome.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the EP, he&rsquo;s directed the first few episodes. And when I connected with him,</p>
<p>Jonah was like, hey, you know, you&rsquo;re the person I want to do this. So, I met with people,</p>
<p>kept saying like, you know, just let me see if he wants to do it. And to my joy, he was like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, Fallout 3 is one of my, yeah, sign me up. I was like, no, how do we get this done?</p>
<p>And at that time, he was sort of, he was at HBO, and it was, you know,</p>
<p>we were trying to figure out, put a little pause on it. And, you know, got to visit the sets,</p>
<p>reading scripts, and things like that. It&rsquo;s all new to me. But I, they&rsquo;re doing such an</p>
<p>incredible job. Like, I think if you like this world, you are going to be just blown away.</p>
<p>Some of the-</p>
<p>Keep in mind, I&rsquo;ve never made a TV show.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, those are all the best, you know, no one ever does it,</p>
<p>wanting it to not be great, but they&rsquo;ve just done their attention to detail, and obsessive,</p>
<p>just obsessive with what&rsquo;s on the screen, and the storytelling, and how it looks, the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think obsession is really a prerequisite for greatness. What they did,</p>
<p>HBO did with Chernobyl, like the attention to detail is just incredible.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s doing The Last of Us now.</p>
<p>That showrunner.</p>
<p>If you really care, and you really put a lot of effort into the details,</p>
<p>you can grace something truly special.</p>
<p>I was stunned. They, I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to spoil it, but when people see it,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ll just be like, wow. The other thing, we were approaching it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very different, where when it was, people would say, want to make a movie,</p>
<p>they wanted to, you know, tell the story of Fallout 3, or then tell the story of Fallout 4.</p>
<p>And for this, it was, hey, let&rsquo;s do something that exists in the world of Fallout.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not retelling a game story. It&rsquo;s basically, you know, an area of the map,</p>
<p>and like, let&rsquo;s tell a story here that fits in the world that we have built,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t, you know, break any of the rules, can reference things in the games,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t a retelling of the games that exists in the same world, but is its own unique thing.</p>
<p>So it adds to it, while also people who don&rsquo;t, haven&rsquo;t played the games, who can&rsquo;t experience</p>
<p>like how crazy cool Fallout is, can watch the series, and so.</p>
<p>Are there some similarities or interesting differences between the creation of a game</p>
<p>and a TV show that you noticed from the sort of story perspective?</p>
<p>Well, for them, you know, it&rsquo;s much more character-driven. Like, you can do all these</p>
<p>things with the world and stuff that we already have. It&rsquo;s the main characters, who they are,</p>
<p>what their motivations are, that really is the engine.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s no&hellip;</p>
<p>Finding the right actors to do those, yeah.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not, there&rsquo;s no interaction, there&rsquo;s no, you don&rsquo;t get to enter that world,</p>
<p>they have to do the work for you. The NPCs are on the show. Yeah, I can&rsquo;t wait to see how it</p>
<p>turns out. You also mentioned Indiana Jones. That&rsquo;s a weird, that&rsquo;s a different one. How do</p>
<p>you work with, like, with a famous protagonist? Like, when the character is known, how do you</p>
<p>work with that?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s different, it&rsquo;s different. Like, Indiana Jones is different where, like,</p>
<p>the name, it is the, like, it&rsquo;s Indiana Jones. Not a world, it&rsquo;s him, right? You can talk about</p>
<p>the world of Indiana Jones, but at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s about this character. And Raiders,</p>
<p>still my favorite movie of all time. No debate, it&rsquo;s the best movie ever.</p>
<p>Best movie ever.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>On a tangent, what do you love about it?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I saw it, obviously, when I was younger, and I believed it. I believe this</p>
<p>happened. And when they found the Ark, I literally, I could not believe that they found it.</p>
<p>So, and I have found over my life, it&rsquo;s still really watchable every time. I enjoy it every</p>
<p>single time. Love the character, love the story. The opening is the greatest movie opening ever.</p>
<p>And I just love everything, I love everything about it.</p>
<p>What was the opening? Is this when the&hellip;</p>
<p>What? It&rsquo;s the temple, and then the ball rolls and tries to crush him.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s the opening.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opening of Raiders, yeah, he steals the idol.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re deeply offended.</p>
<p>I was like, what&rsquo;s the opening of Raiders? So, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to, it&rsquo;s one of those things,</p>
<p>like, what&rsquo;s on your bucket list? Like, oh, I want to make an Indiana Jones game.</p>
<p>And I had pitched Lucas, I met some people there and pitched them back in 09,</p>
<p>this Indiana Jones game concept. And they wanted to publish, kind of the deal fell apart,</p>
<p>they wanted to publish it, and we were a publisher, and so we didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t really have the team to do it, I just was going to figure that out after we</p>
<p>agreed to a deal. And well, you know, we made Skyrim, so it worked out. And then, you know,</p>
<p>fast forward 10 years plus, and, you know, Lucas, now part of Disney, and they&rsquo;re doing a lot more</p>
<p>of licensing and working with people. And so, I knew some folks there and said, oh, I have this</p>
<p>idea that I pitched a long time ago. And they loved it. And again, the internal team that I had</p>
<p>not only didn&rsquo;t have the time, they probably weren&rsquo;t as good a fit as Machine Games, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>done the Wolfenstein series, who is the perfect fit for this game with storytelling and how they</p>
<p>record it. And they are, it&rsquo;s awesome. They&rsquo;re just doing an incredible job with that game.</p>
<p>People are going to be, if you like Indiana Jones, it is a definite love letter</p>
<p>to Indiana Jones and everything with it.</p>
<p>Can you say if it&rsquo;s more on the action adventure side, like the actual experience of the game?</p>
<p>I could go back. I would just say it is a mashup. It is a unique, it isn&rsquo;t one thing</p>
<p>intentionally. So, it does a lot of different things that, you know, we&rsquo;ve, myself and</p>
<p>J√∂rg and the folks at Machine Games have wanted to do in a game. So, it&rsquo;s a unique thing.</p>
<p>Before I forget, who do I, how many humans do I have to kill? I mean,</p>
<p>dragons do I have to kill to get myself somehow into Elder Scrolls VI? It&rsquo;s a mod. If anyone</p>
<p>wants to create mods of me, is that possible? Yeah, it&rsquo;s possible. While maintaining realism</p>
<p>somehow. You don&rsquo;t want a person in a suit and tie. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>You can put you in Fallout. You can wear that.</p>
<p>Please put me, so Fallout, there&rsquo;s also a culture of&hellip;</p>
<p>You do a mod where you replace the mysterious stranger.</p>
<p>There you go. That&rsquo;s a to-do task.</p>
<p>Top mod, right there.</p>
<p>And you will have my deep gratitude and more, dear stranger, for doing so.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the programming language for mods? Is it mostly&hellip;</p>
<p>They use our internal scripting language that&rsquo;s built into the tool.</p>
<p>Okay. I&rsquo;m almost afraid to explore that world because you will never, never, never turn back.</p>
<p>How long&hellip; You&rsquo;ve created so many incredible games. What does the future hold? Is there&hellip;</p>
<p>Going through this process, do you still have the energy, the passion, the drive to keep creating?</p>
<p>I do. I cannot imagine doing anything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to do it as long as possible. I will say, though, as I&rsquo;ve done it,</p>
<p>you know, soon it&rsquo;ll be 30 years at Bethesda. I&rsquo;ve learned that to appreciate the developments</p>
<p>a little bit more, you know, that the time it takes, I should prioritize all of us enjoying</p>
<p>the development process more than I did in the past. It was like, you know, just wanted to&hellip;</p>
<p>The end. That&rsquo;s all that mattered.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all that mattered. And the more you do it, you realize, no, I&rsquo;m spending the majority</p>
<p>of my life in Tamriel and The Wasteland and Fallout. So, you know, the moments that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all doing this together, we need to enjoy it. Like, it&rsquo;s a lot of work finishing Starfield, but</p>
<p>hey, we got to enjoy this. This is, like, incredible. We don&rsquo;t get that many shots.</p>
<p>So the actual process of creating the struggles along the way of stuff not working,</p>
<p>like you said, at this point of Starfield, probably creating some of the glue of how</p>
<p>stuff feels and going back again and again and again to try to make the beginning better,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I would say it for anybody&rsquo;s vocation, whatever you&rsquo;re doing. You know, whatever</p>
<p>people do, you&rsquo;re going to have harder times. And sometimes people, you know, you have to,</p>
<p>you know, maybe recalibrate yourself to like, okay, how can we make this more enjoyable for</p>
<p>all of us, no matter what you&rsquo;re doing? And rewarding.</p>
<p>So if life is a video game, which it most likely is, what do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>From having created so many games where the character has to try to figure out,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s bigger questions than just solving the quest. You&rsquo;re asking the big</p>
<p>questions of why am I here? I feel like that&rsquo;s good practice for answering</p>
<p>the same question for this video game we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life, Todd Howard?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very&hellip;</p>
<p>I can say what motivates me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good start.</p>
<p>Having a curiosity. You know, the ability to not assume a lot.</p>
<p>And be curious about the world around you. It&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s, you know, not the same as</p>
<p>just wanting to learn everything, but what makes other humans tick? How do they feel?</p>
<p>How do they love? It might be cliche to say the meaning of life is to love, right?</p>
<p>So that curiosity is just, is about noticing the world.</p>
<p>Noticing the world around you. You know, look, there&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s anecdote. Someone says,</p>
<p>everybody has two lives, and the second one starts when you realize there&rsquo;s only one.</p>
<p>And I think, I usually preach to my children and everything else, like, have a curiosity</p>
<p>to the world around you, and you&rsquo;ll have the most fulfilling days.</p>
<p>Are you able to be inside the worlds that you&rsquo;ve created and be able to notice them?</p>
<p>Like, really, like, really enjoy them?</p>
<p>It takes time. So, like, Skyrim had its 10th anniversary, and so when I went back into it,</p>
<p>I think I got to see it for what it is. My younger son got really into it, you know,</p>
<p>a few years back on the Switch. That&rsquo;s what we notice, people age up into it.</p>
<p>Right? So one of the reasons it&rsquo;s so popular is, you know, people come into, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re now becoming, you know, teenagers, and oh, okay, I&rsquo;ll finally play Skyrim.</p>
<p>And, you know, he got obsessed with it. And he wasn&rsquo;t, usually I&rsquo;d say, hey, check out my games,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, ah, shut up, dad, we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re playing this other stuff. And he got, like,</p>
<p>obsessed with Skyrim, like, we&rsquo;re having, like, deep Elder Scrolls lore conversations at dinner.</p>
<p>And, you know, I saw it through his eyes, and that was pretty special. And then the mods he</p>
<p>was downloading, and the YouTubers he was following, talking about stuff. So the people</p>
<p>who, like, the Elder Scrolls people don&rsquo;t realize how much of that I have watched with my son.</p>
<p>And then I kind of, when the 10th anniversary came out, like, oh, I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>check out a build, I have to check out the build out, but I hadn&rsquo;t played it in so long. And it was</p>
<p>like, it does, it has this flow. We&rsquo;re like, oh my god, I just played for four hours. I need to,</p>
<p>I need to turn it off.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s something about enjoying video games with the people you love, too.</p>
<p>Or the water cooler discussion, and with kids. So I actually, I would love to have kids,</p>
<p>and hopefully soon in the future. So I guess the thing I need your advice on is,</p>
<p>how do I time it in such a way when they&rsquo;re old enough, right at the age they&rsquo;re old enough,</p>
<p>like, I want to know when to have them so that when they&rsquo;re old enough, that&rsquo;s exactly when Elder</p>
<p>Scrolls VI comes out. So I want to, can you give me a hint when I should have kids? All right,</p>
<p>never mind.</p>
<p>You are a genius at how to ask that question.</p>
<p>The number of times. Yeah, you told the anecdote that your son asked you the same question.</p>
<p>But of course, it&rsquo;s all for good fun. Take as much time as is needed. Skyrim is still an</p>
<p>incredible game and has an impact on millions of people, as do all of your games. Thank you for</p>
<p>everything you&rsquo;ve done for the world. It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would talk with me.</p>
<p>This has been an honor. And, you know, it has to be said, look, I have a huge team of people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with for, some of them for 20 years, and it&rsquo;s really all of us together.</p>
<p>Keep doing a great job. Guys and gals, I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you create next. It really,</p>
<p>really does have an impact on silly kids like me, and millions of silly kids like me. So</p>
<p>I really appreciate everything.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks, Dan.</p>
