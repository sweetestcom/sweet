    <p>The following is a conversation with Magnus Carlsen,</p>
<p>the number one ranked chess player in the world</p>
<p>and widely considered to be one of,</p>
<p>if not the greatest chess player of all time.</p>
<p>The camera on Magnus died 20 minutes into the conversation.</p>
<p>Most folks still just listen to the audio</p>
<p>through a podcast player anyway,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re watching this on YouTube or Spotify,</p>
<p>we did our best to still make it interesting</p>
<p>by adding relevant image overlays.</p>
<p>I mess things up sometimes, like in this case,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m always working hard to improve.</p>
<p>I hope you understand.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and support along the way.</p>
<p>I love you all.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Magnus Carlsen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re considered by many to be one of the greatest,</p>
<p>if not the greatest chess players of all time,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also one of the best fantasy football,</p>
<p>AKA soccer, competitors in the world,</p>
<p>plus recently picking up poker</p>
<p>and competing at a world class level.</p>
<p>So before chess, let&rsquo;s talk football and greatness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a Real Madrid fan,</p>
<p>so let me ask you the ridiculous big question.</p>
<p>Who do you think is the greatest football,</p>
<p>AKA soccer player of all time?</p>
<p>Can you make the case for Messi?</p>
<p>Can you make the case for Cristiano Ronaldo, Pele,</p>
<p>Maradona, does anybody jump to mind?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty hard to make a case</p>
<p>for anybody else than Messi for his all around game.</p>
<p>And frankly, my Real Madrid fandom</p>
<p>sort of predates the Ronaldo era,</p>
<p>the second Ronaldo, not the first one.</p>
<p>So I always liked Ronaldo,</p>
<p>but I always kind of thought that Messi was better.</p>
<p>And I went to quite a number of Madrid games</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve always been super helpful to me down there.</p>
<p>The only thing is that, like they asked me,</p>
<p>they were gonna do an interview</p>
<p>and they were gonna ask me who my favorite player was.</p>
<p>And I said somebody else,</p>
<p>I think I said Isco at that point,</p>
<p>and I was like, okay, take two now you say Ronaldo.</p>
<p>So for them it was very important,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t that huge to me.</p>
<p>So Messi over Maradona.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think just like with chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to compare eras.</p>
<p>Obviously the improvements in football</p>
<p>have been like in technique and such</p>
<p>have been even greater than they have been in chess,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always a weird discussion to have.</p>
<p>But just as a fan,</p>
<p>what do you think is beautiful about the game?</p>
<p>What defines greatness?</p>
<p>Is it, you know, with Messi,</p>
<p>one, he&rsquo;s really good at finishing,</p>
<p>two, very good at assist,</p>
<p>like three, there&rsquo;s just magic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just beautiful to see the play.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about the finishing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, it&rsquo;s like Maradona&rsquo;s hand of God.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some creativity on the pitch.</p>
<p>Is that important or is it very important</p>
<p>to get the World Cups and the big championships</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I think the World Cup is pretty overrated,</p>
<p>seeing as it&rsquo;s such a small sample size.</p>
<p>So it sort of annoys me always when, you know,</p>
<p>titles are always appreciated so much,</p>
<p>even though that particular title can be a lot of luck</p>
<p>or at least some luck.</p>
<p>So I do appreciate the statistics a bit</p>
<p>and all the statistics say that Messi&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best finisher of all time,</p>
<p>which I think helps a lot.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the intangibles as well.</p>
<p>The flip side of that is the small sample size</p>
<p>is what really creates the magic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s just like the Olympics.</p>
<p>You basically train your whole life for this.</p>
<p>You live your whole life for this and it&rsquo;s a rare moment.</p>
<p>One mistake and it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, for some reason, a lot of people</p>
<p>either break under that pressure</p>
<p>or rise up under that pressure.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t admire the magic of that?</p>
<p>No, I do.</p>
<p>I just think that rising under pressure</p>
<p>and breaking under the pressure</p>
<p>is often a really oversimplified take</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do romanticize the game.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you another ridiculous question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also a fan of basketball.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let me ask the goat question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m biased because I went to high school in Chicago,</p>
<p>Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan era.</p>
<p>Let me ask the Jordan versus LeBron James question.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s continue on this thread of greatness.</p>
<p>Which one do you pick or somebody else?</p>
<p>Magic Johnson.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you a completely different answer.</p>
<p>Uh oh.</p>
<p>Depending on my mood and depending on whom I talk to,</p>
<p>I pick one of the two and then I try to argue for that.</p>
<p>With the quantum mechanical thing.</p>
<p>Well, can you, what, again, what would,</p>
<p>if you were to argue for either one,</p>
<p>statistically, I think LeBron James</p>
<p>is going to surpass Jordan.</p>
<p>Yeah, no doubt.</p>
<p>And so again, there&rsquo;s a debate between.</p>
<p>Unquantifiable greatness, no?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole, that&rsquo;s the whole debate.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, well, it&rsquo;s quantifiable versus unquantifiable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more important?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re depending on mood all over the place.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But what do you lean in general with these folks,</p>
<p>with soccer, with anything in life,</p>
<p>towards the unquantifiable more?</p>
<p>No, definitely towards the quantifiable.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re unsure, lean towards the numbers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But see, like, it&rsquo;s later generations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something, that&rsquo;s what people say about Maradona</p>
<p>is, you know, he took a arguably somewhat mediocre team</p>
<p>to a World Cup.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that also uplifting nature of the player</p>
<p>to be able to rise up, it is a team sport.</p>
<p>So are you gonna, like, are you gonna punish Messi</p>
<p>for taking a mediocre Argentine squad</p>
<p>to the final in 2014 and punish him</p>
<p>because they lost to a great team very narrowly</p>
<p>after they missed?</p>
<p>The internet does.</p>
<p>He set up, like, a great chance for Higuain</p>
<p>in the first half, which he, which he fluffed.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, eventually they lost the game.</p>
<p>Yeah, they do criticize Cristiano Ronaldo,</p>
<p>Messi for being on really strong squads</p>
<p>in terms of the club teams and saying,</p>
<p>yeah, okay, it&rsquo;s easy when you have like Ronaldinho</p>
<p>or whoever on your team.</p>
<p>It would be very interesting</p>
<p>just if the league could make a decision.</p>
<p>Yeah, just random, random allocation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And just every single game, just keep reallocating</p>
<p>or maybe once a season or every season you get random.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say every, every player,</p>
<p>if let&rsquo;s say they sign a five year contract for a team,</p>
<p>like one of them, you&rsquo;re gonna get randomly allocated</p>
<p>to, to let&rsquo;s say a bottom half team.</p>
<p>I bet you there&rsquo;s gonna be so much corruption around that.</p>
<p>It could be random.</p>
<p>Obviously it wouldn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t ever happen or work,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s interesting to think about.</p>
<p>So on chess, let&rsquo;s zoom out.</p>
<p>If you break down your approach to chess</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re at your best,</p>
<p>what do you think,</p>
<p>what do you think contributes to that approach?</p>
<p>Is it memory recall, specific lines and positions?</p>
<p>Is it intuition?</p>
<p>How much of it is intuition?</p>
<p>How much of it is pure calculation?</p>
<p>How much of it is messing with the strategy of the opponent?</p>
<p>So the game theory aspect in terms of what contributes</p>
<p>to the highest level of play that you do.</p>
<p>I think the answer differs a little bit now</p>
<p>from what it did eight years ago.</p>
<p>For instance, like I&rsquo;ve, I feel like I&rsquo;ve had like two peaks</p>
<p>and in my career in 2014,</p>
<p>well, 2013, 2014, and also in 2019.</p>
<p>And in those years, I was very different</p>
<p>in terms of, of my strength,</p>
<p>strength as specifically in 2019,</p>
<p>I benefited a lot from opening preparation</p>
<p>while in 2013, 2014,</p>
<p>I mostly tried to avoid my opponent&rsquo;s preparation</p>
<p>rather than that being a, being a strength.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m mentioning that also because it&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>something you didn&rsquo;t, didn&rsquo;t mention.</p>
<p>I think like my intuitive understanding of chess has</p>
<p>over those years always been a little bit better</p>
<p>than the others, even though it has evolved as well.</p>
<p>Certainly there are, there are things that I understand now</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t understand back then,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not only for me, that&rsquo;s for, for others as well.</p>
<p>I was younger back then.</p>
<p>So I played with more energy,</p>
<p>which meant that I could play better</p>
<p>in long drawn out games,</p>
<p>which was also a necessity for me</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t, I couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t beat people in the, in the openings.</p>
<p>But in terms of calculation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always been a weird issue for me.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve always been really, really bad</p>
<p>at solving exercises in chess.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s been like a blind spot for me.</p>
<p>First of all, I found it hard to concentrate on them</p>
<p>and to look, to look deep enough.</p>
<p>So this is like a puzzle, a position, mate in X.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing is mate, but find the best move.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s generally the exercise,</p>
<p>like find the best move, find the best line.</p>
<p>You, you just don&rsquo;t connect with it.</p>
<p>Usually like you have to, to look, look deep.</p>
<p>And then when I get these lines during the game,</p>
<p>I very often find the, the, the right solution,</p>
<p>even though, even though it&rsquo;s not still</p>
<p>the best part of my game to, to calculate very, very deeply.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t feel like calculation you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>in terms of.</p>
<p>And it does sometimes, but for me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like I&rsquo;m at the board trying to find,</p>
<p>trying to find the solution.</p>
<p>And I understand like the training at home</p>
<p>is like trying a little bit to, to replicate that.</p>
<p>Like you give somebody half an hour in a position,</p>
<p>like in this instance, you might&rsquo;ve thought</p>
<p>for half an hour if you play the game,</p>
<p>but I just, I just cannot do it.</p>
<p>One thing I know that I am good at though,</p>
<p>is calculating short lines because I calculate them,</p>
<p>them well, I&rsquo;m good at seeing little details</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m also much better than, than most at evaluating,</p>
<p>which I think is something that sets me,</p>
<p>sets me apart from, from others.</p>
<p>So evaluating specific position, if I,</p>
<p>if I make this move and the position changes in this way,</p>
<p>is this a step in the right direction?</p>
<p>Like in a big picture way?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you calculate a few moves ahead and then you evaluate</p>
<p>because a lot of, a lot of time, a lot of the times</p>
<p>you cannot, the branches become so big</p>
<p>that you cannot calculate everything.</p>
<p>So you have to, yeah.</p>
<p>So you have to, you have to make evaluations based on,</p>
<p>you know, based mostly on knowledge</p>
<p>and intuition and somehow I seem to do that pretty well.</p>
<p>When you say you&rsquo;re good at short lines,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that, what&rsquo;s, what&rsquo;s short?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually like lines of two to four moves each.</p>
<p>Okay, so that, that&rsquo;s directly applicable</p>
<p>to even faster games like blitz, chess and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, blitz is a lot about calculating forest lines.</p>
<p>So those, you can see pretty clearly that the players</p>
<p>who struggle at blitz who are great at classical</p>
<p>are those who rely on a deep calculating ability</p>
<p>because you simply don&rsquo;t have time for that in blitz.</p>
<p>You have to calculate quickly and rely a lot on intuition.</p>
<p>Can you try to, I know it&rsquo;s really difficult.</p>
<p>Can you try to talk through what&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>being visualized in your head?</p>
<p>Is there, is there a visual component?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I just visualized the board.</p>
<p>I mean, the board is in my head.</p>
<p>Two dimensional?</p>
<p>My interpretation is that it is two dimensional.</p>
<p>Like what color is, is it brown tinted?</p>
<p>Is it black?</p>
<p>Is it, like what&rsquo;s the theme?</p>
<p>Is it a big board, small board?</p>
<p>Are the, what do the pawns look like?</p>
<p>Or is it more in the space of concepts?</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>Yeah, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of colors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly, yeah.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>
<p>Queen&rsquo;s gambit on the ceiling, whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying now to imagine it.</p>
<p>What about when you do the branching,</p>
<p>when you have multiple boards and so on?</p>
<p>What, how does that look?</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s only one at a time.</p>
<p>So like.</p>
<p>One position at a time.</p>
<p>So then I go back and that&rsquo;s what, when,</p>
<p>when people play, or at least that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>When I play blindfold chess against several people,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s just always one board at a time.</p>
<p>And the rest are stored away somewhere.</p>
<p>But how do you store them away?</p>
<p>So like, you went down one branch.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, all right, that&rsquo;s, I got that.</p>
<p>I understand that there&rsquo;s some good there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some bad there.</p>
<p>Now let me go down another branch.</p>
<p>Like, how do you store away the information?</p>
<p>You just put it on a shelf, kind of?</p>
<p>I try and store it away.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have to sort of repeat it because I forget.</p>
<p>And it does happen frequently in games</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re thinking for,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re thinking for a long,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a half an hour,</p>
<p>or even more than that, that you play a move</p>
<p>and then your opponent plays a move,</p>
<p>then you play a move and they play a move again.</p>
<p>And you realize, oh, I actually calculated that.</p>
<p>I just forgot about it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s obviously what happens</p>
<p>when you store the information and you cannot retrieve it.</p>
<p>When you think about a move for 20, 30 minutes,</p>
<p>like how do you break that down?</p>
<p>Can you describe what,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s the algorithm here</p>
<p>that takes 30 minutes to run?</p>
<p>30 minutes is, at least for me, it&rsquo;s usually a waste.</p>
<p>30 minutes usually means that I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just running into the wall over and over.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m trying to find something that isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>I think 10 to 15 minutes things</p>
<p>in complicated positions can be really, really helpful.</p>
<p>Then you can spend your time pretty efficiently.</p>
<p>Just means that the branches are getting wide.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to run through,</p>
<p>both in terms of calculation</p>
<p>and lots you have to evaluate as well.</p>
<p>And then based on that 10 to 15 minute thing,</p>
<p>you have a pretty good idea what to do.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very rare that I would think for half an hour</p>
<p>and I would have a eureka moment during the game.</p>
<p>Like if I haven&rsquo;t seen it in 10 minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably not gonna see it at all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to different branches.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like after 15 minutes, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>But it mainly to the middle game,</p>
<p>because when you get to the end game,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually brute force calculation</p>
<p>that makes you spend so much time.</p>
<p>So middle game is normally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a complicated mix of brute force calculation</p>
<p>and like creativity and evaluation.</p>
<p>So end game, it&rsquo;s easier in that sense.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re good at every aspect of chess,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also your end game is legendary.</p>
<p>It baffles experts.</p>
<p>So can you linger on that then try to explain</p>
<p>what the heck is going on there?</p>
<p>Like if you look at game six</p>
<p>of the previous world championship,</p>
<p>the longest game ever played in chess,</p>
<p>it was I think his queen versus your rook knight in two pawns.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many options there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an interesting little dance</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of not obvious that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a draw.</p>
<p>So how do you escape it not being a draw</p>
<p>and you win that match?</p>
<p>No, I knew that for most of the time,</p>
<p>it was a theoretical draw</p>
<p>since chess with seven or less pieces on the board is solved.</p>
<p>So you can, like people watching online,</p>
<p>they can just check it.</p>
<p>They can check and they can check a so called table base</p>
<p>and they, it just gonna spit out win for white,</p>
<p>win for black or draw.</p>
<p>So, and also I knew that,</p>
<p>I knew that didn&rsquo;t know that position specifically,</p>
<p>but I knew that it had to be a draw.</p>
<p>So for me, it was about staying alert.</p>
<p>First of all, trying to look for the best way</p>
<p>to put my pieces, but yeah,</p>
<p>those end games are a bit, they&rsquo;re a bit unusual.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t happen too often.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m usually good at is I&rsquo;m using my strength</p>
<p>that I also use in middle games</p>
<p>is that I evaluate well</p>
<p>and I calculate short variations quite.</p>
<p>Even for the end game, short variations matter?</p>
<p>Yes, it does matter in some simpler end games.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also like there are these theoretical end games</p>
<p>with very few pieces like rook knights</p>
<p>and two pawns versus Queens,</p>
<p>but a lot of end games are simply defined</p>
<p>by the Queens being exchanged</p>
<p>and there are a lot of other pieces left</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s usually not brute force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually more of understanding and evaluation</p>
<p>and then I can use my strengths very well.</p>
<p>Why are you so damn good at the end game?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there a lot of moves from when the end game starts</p>
<p>to when the end game finishes and you have a few pieces</p>
<p>and you have to figure out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a sequence of little games that happens, right?</p>
<p>Like little pattern.</p>
<p>Like how does it being able to evaluate a single position</p>
<p>lead you to evaluate a long sequence of positions</p>
<p>that eventually lead to a checkmate?</p>
<p>Well, I think if you evaluate well at the start,</p>
<p>you know what plans to go for</p>
<p>and then usually the play from there</p>
<p>is often pretty simple.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you understand how to arrange your pieces</p>
<p>and often also how to arrange your pawns</p>
<p>early in the end game then that makes all the difference</p>
<p>and after that is like what we call technique very often</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s technique basically just means</p>
<p>that the moves are simple and these are moves</p>
<p>that a lot of players could make</p>
<p>not only the very strongest ones.</p>
<p>These are moves that are kind of understood</p>
<p>and known.</p>
<p>So with the evaluation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just constantly improving a little bit</p>
<p>and that just leads to suffocating the position</p>
<p>and then eventually to the win</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re doing the evaluation well,</p>
<p>one step at a time.</p>
<p>To some extent.</p>
<p>Also, yeah, I said like if you evaluate it better</p>
<p>and thus accumulated some small advantages</p>
<p>then you can often make your life pretty easy</p>
<p>towards the end of the end game.</p>
<p>So you said in 2019 sort of the second phase</p>
<p>of why you&rsquo;re so damn good.</p>
<p>You did a lot of opening preparation.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal for you of the opening game of chess?</p>
<p>Is it to throw the opponent off from any prepared lines?</p>
<p>Is there something you could put into words</p>
<p>about why you&rsquo;re so damn good at the openings?</p>
<p>Again, these things have changed a lot over time.</p>
<p>Back in Kasparov&rsquo;s days, for instance,</p>
<p>he very often got huge advantages</p>
<p>from the opening as white.</p>
<p>Can you explain why?</p>
<p>There were several reasons for that.</p>
<p>First of all, he worked harder.</p>
<p>He was more creative in finding ideas.</p>
<p>He was able to look places others didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Also, he had a very strong team of people</p>
<p>who had specific strengths in openings that he could use.</p>
<p>So they would come up with ideas</p>
<p>and he would integrate those ideas into&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, and he would also very often</p>
<p>come up with them himself.</p>
<p>Also, at the start, he had some of the first computer engines</p>
<p>to work for him to find his ideas,</p>
<p>to look deeper, to verify his ideas.</p>
<p>He was better at using them than a lot of others.</p>
<p>Now, I feel like the playing field is a lot more level.</p>
<p>There are both computer engines, neural networks,</p>
<p>and hybrid engines available to practically anybody.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s much harder to find ideas now</p>
<p>that actually give you an advantage</p>
<p>with the white pieces.</p>
<p>I mean, people don&rsquo;t expect to find those ideas anymore.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s all about finding ideas</p>
<p>that are missed by the engines.</p>
<p>Either they&rsquo;re missed entirely</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re missed at low depth</p>
<p>and using them to gain some advantage</p>
<p>in the sense that you have more knowledge.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also good to know that usually</p>
<p>these are not complete bluffs, these are like semi bluffs</p>
<p>so that you know that even if your opponent</p>
<p>makes all the right moves, you can still make a draw.</p>
<p>And also at the start of 2019,</p>
<p>neural networks had just started to be a thing in chess.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not entirely sure,</p>
<p>but there were at least some players</p>
<p>even in the top events who you could see did not use them</p>
<p>or did not use them in the right way.</p>
<p>And then you could gain a huge advantage</p>
<p>because a lot of positions,</p>
<p>they were being evaluated differently</p>
<p>by the neural networks than traditional chess engines</p>
<p>because they simply think about chess</p>
<p>in a very, very different way.</p>
<p>So short answer is these days,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about surprising your opponent</p>
<p>and taking it into positions where you have more knowledge.</p>
<p>So is there some sense in which it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>to make suboptimal quote unquote moves?</p>
<p>No, you have to.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to because the best moves</p>
<p>have been analyzed to death mostly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a kind of, when you say semi bluff,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a kind of sacrifice.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sacrificing the optimal move,</p>
<p>the optimal position so that you can take the opponent.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a game theoretic sense.</p>
<p>You take the opponent to something they didn&rsquo;t prepare well.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you could also look at it another way</p>
<p>that regardless, like if you turn on whatever engine</p>
<p>you turn on, like if you try to analyze</p>
<p>either from the starting position</p>
<p>or the starting position of some popular opening,</p>
<p>like if you analyze long enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always gonna end up in a draw.</p>
<p>So in that sense, you may not be going</p>
<p>for like the objective, the tries</p>
<p>that are objectively the most difficult to draw against,</p>
<p>but you are trying to look at least</p>
<p>at the less obvious paths.</p>
<p>How much do you use engines?</p>
<p>Do you use Leela, Stockfish in your preparations?</p>
<p>My team does.</p>
<p>Personally, I try not to use them too much</p>
<p>on my own because I know that when I play,</p>
<p>you obviously cannot have help from engines.</p>
<p>And often I feel like often having imperfect</p>
<p>or knowledge about a position or some engine knowledge</p>
<p>can be a lot worse than having no knowledge.</p>
<p>So I try to look at engines as little as possible.</p>
<p>So yeah, so your team uses them for research</p>
<p>for a generation of ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you are relying primarily on your human resources.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>You can evaluate well.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t lean.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can evaluate as a human.</p>
<p>I can know what they find unpleasant and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very often the case for me to some extent,</p>
<p>but a lot for others that you arrive in a position</p>
<p>and your opponent plays a move that you didn&rsquo;t expect</p>
<p>and if you didn&rsquo;t expect it,</p>
<p>you know that it&rsquo;s probably not a great move</p>
<p>since it hasn&rsquo;t been expected by the engine.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s not obvious why it&rsquo;s not a good move,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually very, very hard to figure it out.</p>
<p>And so then looking at the engines doesn&rsquo;t necessarily help</p>
<p>because at that point, like you&rsquo;re facing a human,</p>
<p>you have to sort of think as a human.</p>
<p>I was chatting with Demis Ashabis, CEO of DeepMind</p>
<p>a couple of days ago and he asked me to ask you</p>
<p>about what you first felt when you saw the play of AlphaZero.</p>
<p>Like interesting ideas in your creativity.</p>
<p>Did you feel fear that the machine is taking over?</p>
<p>Were you inspired?</p>
<p>And what was going on in your mind and heart?</p>
<p>Funny thing about Demis is he doesn&rsquo;t play chess at all</p>
<p>like an AI, he plays in a very, very human way.</p>
<p>No, I was hugely inspired when I saw the games at first.</p>
<p>And in terms of man versus machine,</p>
<p>I mean that battle was kind of lost for humans</p>
<p>even before I entered top level chess.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s never been an issue for me.</p>
<p>I never liked playing against computers much anyway.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s completely fine.</p>
<p>But it was amazing to see how they quote unquote</p>
<p>thought about chess in such a different way</p>
<p>and in a way that you could mistake for creativity.</p>
<p>Mistake for creativity, strong words.</p>
<p>Is it wild to you how many sacrifices it&rsquo;s willing to make</p>
<p>that like sacrifice pieces and then wait</p>
<p>for prolonged periods of time</p>
<p>before doing anything with that?</p>
<p>Is that weird to you that that&rsquo;s part of chess?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s one of the things that&rsquo;s hardest to replicate</p>
<p>as a human as well, or at least for my playing style</p>
<p>that usually when I sacrifice, I feel like I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do it unless I feel like I&rsquo;m getting something</p>
<p>like tangible in return and.</p>
<p>Like a few moves down the line.</p>
<p>A few moves down the line,</p>
<p>you can see that you can either retrieve the material</p>
<p>or you can put your opponent&rsquo;s king under pressure</p>
<p>or have some very like very concrete positional advantage</p>
<p>that sort of compensates for it.</p>
<p>For instance, in chess,</p>
<p>so bishops and knights are fairly equivalent.</p>
<p>We both give them three points,</p>
<p>but bishops are a little bit better.</p>
<p>And especially a bishop pair is a lot better</p>
<p>than a bishop and a knight.</p>
<p>So, or especially two knights depends on the position,</p>
<p>but like on average they are.</p>
<p>So like sacrificing a pawn in order to get a bishop pair,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the most common sacrifices in chess.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re okay making that sacrifice?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it depends on the situation,</p>
<p>but generally that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of openings that are based on that,</p>
<p>that you sacrifice a pawn for the bishop pair,</p>
<p>and then eventually it&rsquo;s some sort of positional equality.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But the way AlphaZero would sacrifice a knight</p>
<p>or sometimes two pawns, three pawns,</p>
<p>and you could see that it&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>for some sort of positional domination,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to understand.</p>
<p>And it was really fascinating to see.</p>
<p>Yeah, in 2019, I was sacrificing a lot of pawns,</p>
<p>especially, and it was a great joy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not so easy to continue to do that.</p>
<p>People have found more solid opening lines since</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t allow me to do that as often.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying both to get those positions</p>
<p>and still trying to learn the art of sacrificing pieces.</p>
<p>So Demis also made a comment that was interesting</p>
<p>to my new chess brain, which is one of the reasons</p>
<p>that chess is fun is because of the, quote,</p>
<p>creative tension between the bishop and the knight.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about this interesting difference</p>
<p>between the two pieces, that there&rsquo;s some kind of,</p>
<p>how would you convert that?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like a poetic statement about chess.</p>
<p>I think he said that, why has chess been played</p>
<p>for such a long time?</p>
<p>Why is it so fun to play at every level?</p>
<p>That if you can reduce it to one thing,</p>
<p>is it the bishop and the knight,</p>
<p>some kind of weird dynamics that they create in chess.</p>
<p>Is there any truth to that?</p>
<p>It sounds very good.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried a lot of other games,</p>
<p>but I tried to play a little bit of shogi.</p>
<p>And for my new shogi brain, comparing it to chess,</p>
<p>what annoyed me about that game is how much the pieces suck.</p>
<p>Basically, you have one rook and you have one bishop</p>
<p>that move like in chess.</p>
<p>And the rest of the pieces are really not very powerful.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s one of the attractions of chess,</p>
<p>like how powerful, especially the queen is, which.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I kind of think makes it a lot of fun.</p>
<p>So you think power is more fun than like variety?</p>
<p>No, there is a variety in chess as well, though.</p>
<p>But not much more so than like go or something.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, that&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p>So like knight, I mean, they all move in different ways.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all like weird.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just all these weird patterns and positions</p>
<p>that can emerge.</p>
<p>The difference in the pieces create</p>
<p>all kinds of interesting dynamics,</p>
<p>I guess is what I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I guess it is quite fascinating</p>
<p>that all those years ago,</p>
<p>they created the knight and the bishop</p>
<p>without probably realizing that they would be</p>
<p>almost equally strong with such different qualities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy that this, you know,</p>
<p>like when you design computer games,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an art form.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s science and an art to balance it.</p>
<p>You know, you talk about Starcraft and all those games,</p>
<p>like so that you can have competitive play</p>
<p>at the highest level with all those different units.</p>
<p>In the case of chess, it&rsquo;s different pieces.</p>
<p>And they somehow designed a game</p>
<p>that was super competitive.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s probably some kind of natural selection</p>
<p>that the chess just wouldn&rsquo;t last if it was designed poorly.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think the rules have changed over time</p>
<p>a little bit, but I would be,</p>
<p>I mean, speaking of games and all that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also interested to play other games like chess 960</p>
<p>or Fisher random, as they call it,</p>
<p>like that you have 960 maps instead of one.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a Fisher random chess, chess 960s.</p>
<p>Yeah, that basically just means</p>
<p>that the pawns are in the same way</p>
<p>and the major pieces are distributed randomly</p>
<p>on the last rank.</p>
<p>Only that there have to be obviously</p>
<p>bishops of opposite color</p>
<p>and the king has to be in between the rooks</p>
<p>so that you can castle both ways.</p>
<p>Oh, you can still castle in chess 960.</p>
<p>You can still castle, but it makes it interesting.</p>
<p>So you still have, it still castles in the same way.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say the king is like here.</p>
<p>Yeah, what happens in that case?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s say the king is in the corner.</p>
<p>So to castle this side,</p>
<p>you have to clear a whole lot of pieces.</p>
<p>Well, what would castling look like though?</p>
<p>No, the king would go here and the rook would go there.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s happened in my games as well.</p>
<p>Like I forgot about castling</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been like attacking a king over here</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden it escapes to the other side.</p>
<p>I think Fischer chess is good that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the maps will generally be worse than regular chess.</p>
<p>Like I think the starting position is as close to ideal</p>
<p>for creating a competitive game as possible,</p>
<p>but they will still be like interesting and diverse enough</p>
<p>that you can play very interesting games.</p>
<p>So when you say maps, there&rsquo;s 960 different options</p>
<p>and like what fraction of that creates interesting games</p>
<p>at the highest level?</p>
<p>This is something that a lot of people are curious about</p>
<p>because when you challenge a great chess player</p>
<p>like yourself to look at a random starting position</p>
<p>that feels like it pushes you to play pure chess</p>
<p>versus memorizing lines.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, for sure, for sure.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the whole idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>How hard is it to play?</p>
<p>I mean, can you talk about what it feels like to you</p>
<p>to play with a random starting position?</p>
<p>Is there some intuition you&rsquo;ve been building up?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very different.</p>
<p>And I mean, understandably engines have</p>
<p>an even greater advantage in 960</p>
<p>than they have in classical chess.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why also I really wish</p>
<p>that we played more classical chess,</p>
<p>like long games, four to seven hours</p>
<p>and in fish random chess, chess 960,</p>
<p>because then you really need that time,</p>
<p>even on the first moves.</p>
<p>What usually happens is that you get 15 minutes</p>
<p>before the game, you&rsquo;re getting told the position</p>
<p>15 minutes before the game,</p>
<p>and then you can think about it a little bit,</p>
<p>even, you know, check the computer,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s all the time you have,</p>
<p>but then you really need to figure it out.</p>
<p>And like some of the positions obviously</p>
<p>are a lot more interesting than the others.</p>
<p>In some of them, it appears that like,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t play symmetrically at the start,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re probably gonna be in a pretty bad position.</p>
<p>What do you mean with the pawns?</p>
<p>With the pawns, yeah.</p>
<p>Why does that make sense?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing about chess though.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say white opens with E4,</p>
<p>which is, which has always been the most played move.</p>
<p>There are many ways to meet that,</p>
<p>but the most solid ways of playing</p>
<p>has always been the symmetrical response.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With E5, and then there&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>through Lopez, there&rsquo;s the Petrov opening and so on.</p>
<p>And if you just banned symmetry on the first move in chess,</p>
<p>you would get more interesting games.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;d get more decisive, decisive games.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the good thing about chess</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;ve played it so long</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve actually devised non symmetrical openings</p>
<p>that are also fairly equal and.</p>
<p>But symmetry is a good default.</p>
<p>But yeah, symmetry is a good default.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a problem that by playing symmetrical</p>
<p>armed with good preparation in regular chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a little bit too easy to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit too dryish.</p>
<p>And I guess if you analyzed,</p>
<p>if you analyzed a lot in chess 960,</p>
<p>then the, a lot of the positions</p>
<p>would end up being pretty dryish as well.</p>
<p>Because the random starting points are so shitty,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forced to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually forced to play symmetrically.</p>
<p>Like you cannot actually try and play</p>
<p>in a more sort of interesting, interesting manner.</p>
<p>Is there any other kind of variations</p>
<p>that are interesting to you?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, there are, there are several.</p>
<p>So no castling chess has been,</p>
<p>has been promoted by former world champion,</p>
<p>Vladimir Kramnik.</p>
<p>There have been a few tournaments with that,</p>
<p>not any that I&rsquo;ve participated in though.</p>
<p>I kind of like it.</p>
<p>Also, my coach uses like non castling engines quite a bit</p>
<p>to analyze regular positions</p>
<p>to just to get a different, different perspective.</p>
<p>So castling is like a defensive thing.</p>
<p>So if you remove castling,</p>
<p>it forces you to be more offensive, is that why?</p>
<p>Yeah, it just, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>It seems like a tiny little difference.</p>
<p>No castling probably forces you</p>
<p>to be a little bit more defensive at the start,</p>
<p>or I would guess so,</p>
<p>because you cannot suddenly escape with the kings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to make the game a bit slower at the start,</p>
<p>but I feel like eventually it&rsquo;s going to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to make the more games more,</p>
<p>well, less droish for sure.</p>
<p>Then you have some weirder variants,</p>
<p>like where the pawns can move both diagonally and forward.</p>
<p>And also you have self capture chess,</p>
<p>which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>So that pawns can,</p>
<p>or pieces could commit suicide or what?</p>
<p>Yeah, people can.</p>
<p>Why would that be a good move?</p>
<p>No, sometimes one of your pieces occupy a square.</p>
<p>I mean, let me just set up a position.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it like this, for instance, like here.</p>
<p>I mean, there are a lot of ways to checkmate for white,</p>
<p>like this for instance, or there are several ways,</p>
<p>but like this would be a checkmate.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>For people who are just listening,</p>
<p>yeah, basically you&rsquo;re bringing in a knight close</p>
<p>to the whole, the king, the queen and so on,</p>
<p>and you replace the knight with a queen.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So you can have like a front of pieces,</p>
<p>and then you just replace them with the second piece.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that could be interesting.</p>
<p>I think also maybe sometimes it&rsquo;s just clearance,</p>
<p>basically it adds an extra element of clearance.</p>
<p>So I think there are many, many different variants.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of them are better than the one</p>
<p>that has been played for at least a thousand years,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s certainly interesting to see.</p>
<p>So one of your goals is to reach</p>
<p>the FIDEELO chess rating of 2900.</p>
<p>Maybe you can comment on how is this rating calculated</p>
<p>and what does it take to get there?</p>
<p>Is it possible for a human being to get there?</p>
<p>Basically you play with a factor of 10,</p>
<p>which means that if I were to play against an opponent</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s rated the same as me, I would be expected</p>
<p>to score 50%, obviously, and that means</p>
<p>that I would win five points with a win,</p>
<p>lose five points with a draw, and then equal if I draw.</p>
<p>If your opponent is 200 points lower rated,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re expected to score 75% and so on.</p>
<p>And you establish that rating by playing a lot of people,</p>
<p>and then it slowly converges towards an estimate</p>
<p>of how likely you are to win or lose against different people.</p>
<p>Yeah, and my rating is obviously carried</p>
<p>through thousands of games.</p>
<p>Right now, my rating is 2861, which is decent.</p>
<p>I think that pretty much corresponds</p>
<p>to the level I have at the moment,</p>
<p>which means in order to reach 2900,</p>
<p>I would have to either get better at chess,</p>
<p>which I think is fairly hard to do,</p>
<p>at least considerably better.</p>
<p>So what I would need to do is try and optimize</p>
<p>even more in terms of preparations, everything.</p>
<p>Not necessarily like selecting tournaments and so on,</p>
<p>but just optimizing in terms of preparation,</p>
<p>making sure I never have any bad days.</p>
<p>So you basically can&rsquo;t lose.</p>
<p>Yeah, I basically can&rsquo;t fuck up ever</p>
<p>if I wanna reach that goal.</p>
<p>And so I think reaching 2900 is pretty unlikely.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;ve set the goal is to have something</p>
<p>to play for, to have a motivation</p>
<p>to actually try and be at my best when I play.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, I&rsquo;m playing to some extent,</p>
<p>mostly for fun these days in that I love to play,</p>
<p>I love to try and win, but I don&rsquo;t have a lot to prove</p>
<p>or anything, but that gives me at least the motivation</p>
<p>to try and be at my best all the time,</p>
<p>which I think is something to aim for.</p>
<p>So at the moment, I&rsquo;m quite enjoying that process</p>
<p>of trying to, yeah, trying to optimize.</p>
<p>What would you say motivates you in this now</p>
<p>and in the years leading up to now?</p>
<p>The love of winning or the fear of losing?</p>
<p>So for the World Championship,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been fear of losing for sure.</p>
<p>Other tournaments, love of winning is a great, great factor</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I also get more joy</p>
<p>from winning most tournaments than I do</p>
<p>for winning the World Championship</p>
<p>because then it&rsquo;s mostly been a relief.</p>
<p>I also think I enjoy winning more now than I did before</p>
<p>because I feel like I&rsquo;m a little bit more relaxed now.</p>
<p>And I also know that it&rsquo;s not gonna last forever.</p>
<p>So every little win, I appreciate a lot more now.</p>
<p>And yeah, in terms of fear of losing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge reason why I&rsquo;m not gonna play</p>
<p>the World Championship</p>
<p>because it really didn&rsquo;t give me a lot of joy.</p>
<p>It really was all about avoiding losing.</p>
<p>Why is it that the World Championship</p>
<p>really makes you feel this way, the anxiety?</p>
<p>So when you say losing, do you mean not just the match</p>
<p>but every single position, like the fear of a blunder?</p>
<p>No, I mean, the blunder is okay.</p>
<p>Like when I sit down at the board,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s mostly been fine because then I&rsquo;m focused on.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m focused on the game</p>
<p>and then I know that I can play the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a time like in between, like knowing that,</p>
<p>you know, I feel like losing is not an option</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the World Championship</p>
<p>and because in a World Championship, there are two players.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a winner and a loser.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t win a random tournament that I play,</p>
<p>then, you know, I&rsquo;m usually, it depends on the tournament.</p>
<p>I might be disappointed for sure.</p>
<p>Might even be pretty pissed,</p>
<p>but ultimately, you know, you go on to the next one.</p>
<p>With the World Championship,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go on to the next one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it also has been like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a core part of my identity for a while now</p>
<p>that I am World Champion.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s not an option of losing that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re gonna have to,</p>
<p>at least for a couple of years,</p>
<p>carry the weight of having lost.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the former World Champion now,</p>
<p>if you lose versus the current World Champion.</p>
<p>There are certain sports that create that anxiety</p>
<p>and others that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For example, I think UFC, like mixed martial arts</p>
<p>are a little better with losing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understood, like everybody loses.</p>
<p>But then.</p>
<p>Not everybody though.</p>
<p>Not everybody.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Khabib entered the chat.</p>
<p>But in boxing, there is like that extra pressure</p>
<p>of like maintaining the championship.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe you could say the same thing</p>
<p>about the UFC as well.</p>
<p>So for you personally, for a person who loves chess,</p>
<p>the first time you won the World Championship,</p>
<p>that was the big, that was the thing that was fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then everything after is like stressful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Essentially.</p>
<p>There was certainly stress involved the first time as well.</p>
<p>But it was nothing compared to the others.</p>
<p>So the only World Championship after that</p>
<p>that I really enjoyed was the one in 2018</p>
<p>against the American Fabiano Caruana.</p>
<p>And what that made that different</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;d been kind of slumping for a bit</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d been on the rise.</p>
<p>So our ratings were very, very similar.</p>
<p>They were so close that if at any point during the match</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d lost the game,</p>
<p>he would have been ranked as number one in the world.</p>
<p>Like our ratings were so close that for each draw,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>And the game itself was close.</p>
<p>Yeah, the games themselves were very close.</p>
<p>I had a winning position in the first game</p>
<p>that I couldn&rsquo;t really get anywhere for a lot of games.</p>
<p>Then he had a couple of games</p>
<p>where he could potentially have won.</p>
<p>Then in the last game I was a little bit better.</p>
<p>And eventually they were all drawn.</p>
<p>But I felt like all the way</p>
<p>that this is an interesting match against an opponent</p>
<p>who is at this position at this point equal to me.</p>
<p>And so losing that would not have been this disaster.</p>
<p>Because in all the other matches,</p>
<p>I would know that I would have lost against somebody</p>
<p>who I know I&rsquo;m much better than.</p>
<p>And that would be a lot harder for me to take.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s fascinating and beautiful</p>
<p>that the stress isn&rsquo;t from losing.</p>
<p>Because you have fun.</p>
<p>You enjoy playing against somebody who&rsquo;s as good as you,</p>
<p>maybe better than you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exciting to you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s losing at this high stakes thing</p>
<p>that only happens rarely to a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s not as good as you.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s also been incredibly frustrating</p>
<p>in other matches, like when I know,</p>
<p>when we play draw after draw.</p>
<p>And I can just, I know that I&rsquo;m better.</p>
<p>I can sense during the game</p>
<p>that I understand it better than them.</p>
<p>But I cannot get over the hump.</p>
<p>So you are the best chess player in the world.</p>
<p>And you not playing the World Championship</p>
<p>really makes the World Championship not seem important.</p>
<p>Or I mean, there&rsquo;s an argument to be made for that.</p>
<p>Is there anything you would like to see</p>
<p>if you had a change about the World Championship</p>
<p>that would make it more fun for you?</p>
<p>And better for the game of chess period</p>
<p>for everybody involved?</p>
<p>So I think 12 games or now 14 games</p>
<p>that there is for the World Championship</p>
<p>is a fairly, fairly low sample size.</p>
<p>If you want to determine who the best player is,</p>
<p>or at least the best player in that particular matchup,</p>
<p>you need more games.</p>
<p>And I think to some extent,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna have a World Champion</p>
<p>and call them the best players,</p>
<p>best player, you gotta make sure</p>
<p>that the format increases the chance</p>
<p>of finding the best player.</p>
<p>So I think having more games,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re gonna have a lot more games,</p>
<p>then you need to decrease the time control a bit,</p>
<p>which in turn, I think is also a good thing</p>
<p>because in very long time controls with deep preparation,</p>
<p>you can sort of mask a lot of your deficiencies</p>
<p>as a chess player</p>
<p>because you have a lot of time to think and to defend.</p>
<p>And also, yeah, you have deep preparation.</p>
<p>So I think those would be, for me to play,</p>
<p>those would be the main things,</p>
<p>more games and less time.</p>
<p>So you want to see more games</p>
<p>and rules that emphasize pure chess?</p>
<p>Yeah, but already less time emphasizes pure chess</p>
<p>because defensive techniques are much harder</p>
<p>to execute with a little time.</p>
<p>What do you think, is there a sweet spot in terms of,</p>
<p>are we talking about Blitz?</p>
<p>Is it, how many minutes?</p>
<p>I think Blitz is a bit too fast.</p>
<p>To their credit, this was suggested by Fieda as well.</p>
<p>For a start to have two games per day,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say you have 45 minutes a game</p>
<p>plus 15 or 30 seconds per move,</p>
<p>that means that each sessions will probably be about,</p>
<p>or a little less than two hours.</p>
<p>That would be a start.</p>
<p>Also what we&rsquo;re playing in the tournament</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m playing here in Miami,</p>
<p>which is four games a day</p>
<p>with 15 minutes plus 10 seconds per move,</p>
<p>those four would be more interesting</p>
<p>than the one there is now.</p>
<p>And I understand that there are a lot of traditions.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to change the World Championship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all fine.</p>
<p>I just think that the World Championship</p>
<p>should do a better job of trying to reflect</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the best overall chess player.</p>
<p>So would you say like, if it&rsquo;s faster games,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably be able to get a sample size</p>
<p>of like over 20 games, 20, 30, 40.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s a number that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>over a long period of time?</p>
<p>Well, I would prefer as many as possible.</p>
<p>So like a hundred?</p>
<p>Yeah, but let&rsquo;s say you play 12 days, two games a day.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s 24.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s already quite a bit better.</p>
<p>You play like one black game, one white game each day.</p>
<p>Endurance wise, that&rsquo;s okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Like you will have free days as well.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that will be a problem.</p>
<p>And also you have to prepare two sets of openings</p>
<p>for each day, which makes it more difficult</p>
<p>for the teams preparing, which I think is also good.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a fun question.</p>
<p>If Hikaru Nakamura was one of the two people,</p>
<p>I guess, I apologize.</p>
<p>Yeah, he could have finished second.</p>
<p>So he lost the last round of the candidates.</p>
<p>Yeah, and maybe you can explain to me,</p>
<p>internet speed copium is something you tweeted.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But if he got second, would you just despite him</p>
<p>still play the world championship?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s internet question.</p>
<p>And when the internet asks, I must abide.</p>
<p>The dude abides.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Thank you, internet.</p>
<p>So after the last match, I did an interview</p>
<p>right after where I talked about the fact</p>
<p>that I was unlikely to play the next one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d spoken privately to both family, friends,</p>
<p>and of course also my chess team</p>
<p>that this was likely going to be the last match.</p>
<p>What happened was that right before</p>
<p>the world championship match,</p>
<p>there was this young player, Alireza Firouzsa.</p>
<p>He had a dramatic rise.</p>
<p>He rose to second in the world rankings.</p>
<p>He was 18 then, he&rsquo;s 19 now.</p>
<p>He qualified for the candidates.</p>
<p>And it felt like there was like at least</p>
<p>a half realistic possibility that he could be the challenger</p>
<p>for the next world championship.</p>
<p>And that sort of lit a fire under me.</p>
<p>Do you like that idea?</p>
<p>Yeah, I like that a lot.</p>
<p>I love the idea of playing him in the next world championship.</p>
<p>And originally, I was sure that I wanted to announce</p>
<p>right after the tournament, the match,</p>
<p>that this was it, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not playing the next one.</p>
<p>But this lit a fire under me.</p>
<p>So that made me think, this actually motivates me.</p>
<p>And I just wanted to get it out there for several reasons</p>
<p>to create more hype about the candidates,</p>
<p>to sort of motivate myself a little bit,</p>
<p>maybe motivate him.</p>
<p>Also, obviously I wanted to give people a heads up</p>
<p>for the candidates that you might be playing</p>
<p>for more than first place.</p>
<p>Normally, the candidates is first place or best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the world championship.</p>
<p>And then, so Nakamura was one of many people</p>
<p>who just didn&rsquo;t believe me, which is fair.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve talked before about not necessarily wanting</p>
<p>to defend again.</p>
<p>But I never talked as concretely or was as serious as this time.</p>
<p>So he simply didn&rsquo;t believe me.</p>
<p>And he was very vocal about that.</p>
<p>And he said, nobody believed me, no other players,</p>
<p>which may or may not have been true.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, he lost the last game.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t qualify.</p>
<p>But to answer the question, no, I&rsquo;d already at that point</p>
<p>decided that I wouldn&rsquo;t play.</p>
<p>I would have liked it less if he had not lost the last round.</p>
<p>But the decision was already made.</p>
<p>Does it break your heart a little bit</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re walking away from it?</p>
<p>In all the ways that you mentioned</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just not fun, there&rsquo;s a bunch of ways</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to bring out the best kind of chess.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t bring out the best out of you</p>
<p>in the particular opponents involved.</p>
<p>Does it just break your heart a little bit?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re walking away from something,</p>
<p>or maybe the entire chess community</p>
<p>is walking away from a kind of a historic event that</p>
<p>was so important in the 20th century at least?</p>
<p>So I won the championship in 2013.</p>
<p>I said no to the candidates in 2011.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t particularly like the format.</p>
<p>I also wasn&rsquo;t, I was just not in the mood.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want the pressure that was connected with the World</p>
<p>Championship.</p>
<p>And I was perfectly content at the time</p>
<p>to play the tournaments that I did play,</p>
<p>also to be ranked number one in the world.</p>
<p>I was comfortable with the fact that I knew that I was the best</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t need a title to show others.</p>
<p>And what happened later is I suddenly decided to play.</p>
<p>In 2013, they changed the format.</p>
<p>I liked it better.</p>
<p>I just decided, it could be interesting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try and get this.</p>
<p>There really wasn&rsquo;t more than that to it.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like fulfilling lifelong dream or anything.</p>
<p>I just thought, let&rsquo;s play.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a cool tournament, a good challenge.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a cool tournament, it&rsquo;s a good challenge.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that could be a motivation.</p>
<p>It motivated me to get in the best shape of my life</p>
<p>that I had been until then.</p>
<p>So it was a good thing.</p>
<p>And 2013 match brought me a lot of joy as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very, very happy that I did that.</p>
<p>But I never had any thoughts that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to keep the title for a long time.</p>
<p>Immediately after the match in 2013,</p>
<p>also before the match, I&rsquo;d spoken against the fact</p>
<p>that the champion is seeded into the final, which</p>
<p>I thought was unfair.</p>
<p>After the match, I made a proposal</p>
<p>that we have a different system where the champion doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have these privileges.</p>
<p>And people&rsquo;s reaction, both players and chess community,</p>
<p>was generally like, OK, we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>You keep your privileges.</p>
<p>And I was like, OK, whatever.</p>
<p>So you want to fight for it every time?</p>
<p>Yeah, I want that.</p>
<p>I have to ask, just in case you have an opinion,</p>
<p>if you can maybe from a fantasy chess perspective</p>
<p>analyze Ding versus Nepo, who wins?</p>
<p>The current, the two people that would</p>
<p>play if you&rsquo;re not playing.</p>
<p>Generally, I would consider that Ding has a slightly better</p>
<p>overall chess strength.</p>
<p>What are the strengths and weaknesses of each,</p>
<p>if you can summarize it?</p>
<p>So Nepo, he&rsquo;s even better at calculating short lines</p>
<p>than I am.</p>
<p>But he can sometimes lack a little bit of depth.</p>
<p>In short lines, he&rsquo;s an absolute calculation monster.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s extremely quick.</p>
<p>But he can sometimes lack a bit of depth.</p>
<p>Also recently, he&rsquo;s improved his openings quite a bit.</p>
<p>So now he has a lot of good ideas.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s very, very solid.</p>
<p>Ding is not quite as well prepared.</p>
<p>But he has an excellent understanding</p>
<p>of dynamics and imbalances in chess, I would say.</p>
<p>What do you mean by imbalances?</p>
<p>Imbalances like bishops against knights</p>
<p>and material imbalances.</p>
<p>He can take advantage of those.</p>
<p>Yes, I would say he&rsquo;s very, very good at that</p>
<p>and understanding the dynamic factors,</p>
<p>as we call them, like material versus time, especially.</p>
<p>I think Nepo got the better of him and the candidates.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your sense why Ding has</p>
<p>an edge in the championship?</p>
<p>I feel like individual past results hasn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>been a great indicator of world championship results.</p>
<p>I feel like overall chess strength is more important.</p>
<p>To be fair, I only think Ding has a very small edge.</p>
<p>Difference is not big at all.</p>
<p>But our individual head to head record</p>
<p>was probably the main reason that a lot of people</p>
<p>thought Nepo had a good chance against me as well.</p>
<p>It was like 4 to 1 in his favor before the match.</p>
<p>But that was just another example</p>
<p>of why that may not necessarily mean anything.</p>
<p>Also in our case, it was a very, very low sample size,</p>
<p>I think, about the size of the match in total, 14 games.</p>
<p>And that generally doesn&rsquo;t mean much.</p>
<p>How close were those games, would you say, in your mind</p>
<p>for the previous championship?</p>
<p>So that game six was a turning point where you won.</p>
<p>Was there any doubt in your mind that if you</p>
<p>do a much larger sample size that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get the better of Nepo?</p>
<p>No, no, larger sample size is always good for me.</p>
<p>So world championship, it&rsquo;s a great parallel to football</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a low scoring game.</p>
<p>And if the better player or the better team scores,</p>
<p>they win most of the time.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s generally for championships or in general?</p>
<p>Yeah, for championships.</p>
<p>They generally, generally win because the other slightly</p>
<p>weaker team, they&rsquo;re good enough to defend</p>
<p>to make it very, very difficult for the others.</p>
<p>But when they actually have to create the chances,</p>
<p>then they have no chance.</p>
<p>And then it very often ends with a blowout</p>
<p>as it did in our match.</p>
<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t won game six, it probably</p>
<p>would have been very, very close.</p>
<p>He might have edged it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously a bigger chance</p>
<p>that I would have edged it.</p>
<p>But this is just what happens a lot in chess,</p>
<p>but also in football that matches are close</p>
<p>and then they somebody scores, somebody scores</p>
<p>and then things change.</p>
<p>And this gives people the illusion</p>
<p>that the matchup was very close.</p>
<p>Well, actually, it just means that the nature of the game</p>
<p>makes the matches close very often.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s always much more likely that one of the teams</p>
<p>is going to or one of the players</p>
<p>is going to break away than the others.</p>
<p>And in other matches as well, even though a lot of people</p>
<p>before the match in 2016 against Karjakin,</p>
<p>there were people who thought before the match</p>
<p>that I was massively overrated as a favorite</p>
<p>and that essentially the match was pretty, pretty close,</p>
<p>like whatever, 60, 40, or some people even said like 55, 45.</p>
<p>And what I felt was that the match went very, very wrong</p>
<p>for me and I still won.</p>
<p>And some people saw that as an indication</p>
<p>that the pre match probabilities were probably</p>
<p>a bit closer than people thought.</p>
<p>Well, I would look at it in the way that everything went wrong</p>
<p>and I still won, which probably means</p>
<p>that I was a pretty big favorite to begin with.</p>
<p>I do have a question to you about that match, but first,</p>
<p>so Sergei Karjakin was originally a qualifier</p>
<p>for the candidate tournament, but was disqualified</p>
<p>for breaching the FIDE code of ethics</p>
<p>after publicly expressing approval</p>
<p>for the 2022 Russian invasion in Ukraine.</p>
<p>You look at the Cold War and some of the US</p>
<p>versus Russian games of the past,</p>
<p>does politics, does some of this geopolitics,</p>
<p>politics ever creep its way into the game?</p>
<p>Do you feel the pressure, the immensity of that</p>
<p>as it does sometimes for the Olympics,</p>
<p>these big nations playing each other,</p>
<p>competing against each other,</p>
<p>almost like fighting out in a friendly way,</p>
<p>the battles, the tensions that they have</p>
<p>in the space of geopolitics?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it still does.</p>
<p>So the president of the World Chess Federation</p>
<p>who was just reelected is a Russian.</p>
<p>Like I like him personally, for sure,</p>
<p>but he is quite connected to the Kremlin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s quite clear that the Kremlin</p>
<p>considers it at least a semi important goal</p>
<p>to bring the chess crown home to Russia.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still definitely a factor.</p>
<p>And I mean, I can answer for in the Karjakin case,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t have a strong opinion</p>
<p>on whether he should have been banned or not.</p>
<p>Obviously, I don&rsquo;t agree with anything</p>
<p>that he says.</p>
<p>But in principle, I think that you should ban</p>
<p>either no Russians or all Russians.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally not particularly against either,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t love banning wrong opinions,</p>
<p>even if they are as reprehensible as his have been.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something about the World Chess Championships</p>
<p>or the Olympics where it feels like banning</p>
<p>is counterproductive to the alleviating</p>
<p>some of the conflicts.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is the thing though.</p>
<p>We really don&rsquo;t know about the long term conflicts.</p>
<p>And a lot of people try to do the right thing in this sense,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t really blame at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I guess sometimes there are other ways</p>
<p>you wanna try and help as well.</p>
<p>See, like within the competition,</p>
<p>within some of those battles of US versus Russia</p>
<p>or so on of the past,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also between the individuals,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll disagree with this,</p>
<p>but from a spectator perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a camaraderie.</p>
<p>Like at the end of the day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thing that unites you,</p>
<p>which is this like appreciation</p>
<p>of the fight over the chessboard.</p>
<p>Even if you hate each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I think for every match that&rsquo;s been,</p>
<p>you would briefly discuss the game</p>
<p>with your opponent after the game,</p>
<p>no matter how much you hate each other.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s lovely.</p>
<p>And Kasparov, I mean, he was quoted,</p>
<p>like when somebody in his team asked him like,</p>
<p>why are you talking to Karpov after the game?</p>
<p>Like you hate that guy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s the only one who understands me.</p>
<p>Yeah, the only one who understands.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, no, I think that&rsquo;s really lovely.</p>
<p>And I would love to see that in other areas as well,</p>
<p>that you can, regardless of what happens,</p>
<p>you can have a good chat about the game.</p>
<p>You can just talk about the ideas</p>
<p>with people who understand what you understand.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not playing the world championships,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who are saying</p>
<p>that perhaps the world championships don&rsquo;t matter anymore.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s some truth to that?</p>
<p>I said that back a long time ago as well,</p>
<p>that for me, I don&rsquo;t know if it never happened.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened,</p>
<p>but I was thinking like the moment that I realized</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not the best player in the world,</p>
<p>like I felt like morally I have to renounce</p>
<p>the world championship title, you know,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not the best player.</p>
<p>So the ratings really tell a bigger, a clearer story.</p>
<p>I think so, at least over time.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a lot more proud of my streak</p>
<p>of being rated number one in the world,</p>
<p>which is now since I think the summer of 2011.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lot more proud of that than the world championships.</p>
<p>How much anxiety or even fear do you have</p>
<p>before making a difficult decision on the chessboard?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a high stakes game.</p>
<p>How nervous do you get?</p>
<p>How much anxiety do you have in all that calculations?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting there for 10, 15 minutes</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re in a fog.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a possibility of a blunder, of a mistake.</p>
<p>Are you anxious about it?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>Really depends.</p>
<p>I have been at times.</p>
<p>I think the most nervous I ever been was game 10</p>
<p>of the world championships in 2018.</p>
<p>I know that was just a thrilling game.</p>
<p>I was black.</p>
<p>I basically abandoned the queen side at some point</p>
<p>to attack him on the king side.</p>
<p>And I knew that my attack, if it doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lose, but I had so much adrenaline.</p>
<p>So that was fine.</p>
<p>I thought I was going to win.</p>
<p>Then at some point I realized that it&rsquo;s not so clear</p>
<p>and that my time was ticking and I was just getting</p>
<p>so nervous.</p>
<p>I still remember what happened.</p>
<p>Like we played this time trouble phase</p>
<p>where he had very little time, but I had even less.</p>
<p>And I just remember, I kind of remember much of it,</p>
<p>just that when it was over, I was just so relieved</p>
<p>because then it was clear that the position</p>
<p>was probably gonna be routed in a draw.</p>
<p>Otherwise I&rsquo;m often nervous before games,</p>
<p>but when I get there, it&rsquo;s all business.</p>
<p>And especially when I&rsquo;m playing well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never afraid of losing when I play</p>
<p>because I trust my instincts.</p>
<p>I trust my skills.</p>
<p>How much psychological intimidation is there</p>
<p>from you to the other person, from the other person to you?</p>
<p>I think people would play a lot better</p>
<p>if they played against an anonymous me.</p>
<p>I would love to have a tournament online</p>
<p>where let&rsquo;s say you play 10 of the best players in the world</p>
<p>and for each round you don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s these videos where people eat McDonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or Burger King or Diet Coke versus Diet Pepsi.</p>
<p>Would people be able to tell they&rsquo;re playing you</p>
<p>from the style of play, do you think?</p>
<p>Or from the strength of play?</p>
<p>If there was a decent sample size, sure.</p>
<p>And what about you?</p>
<p>Would you be able to tell others?</p>
<p>In just one game?</p>
<p>Very unlikely.</p>
<p>What sample size would you need to tell accurately?</p>
<p>I feel like this is science.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think 20 games would help a lot.</p>
<p>Per person?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I know that they&rsquo;ve already developed AI bots</p>
<p>that are pretty good at recognizing somebody&rsquo;s style.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Which is quite fascinating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;d be fascinating if those bots</p>
<p>were able to summarize the style somehow.</p>
<p>Maybe great attacking chess,</p>
<p>like some of the same characteristics</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been describing like great at short line calculations</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or did you just talk shit?</p>
<p>No, but really all the best chess players,</p>
<p>there are basically just two camps.</p>
<p>People who are good at longer lines or shorter lines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the hare and the tortoise, basically.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you know,</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m the closest you can get</p>
<p>to a high bridge of those.</p>
<p>Because you got both,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good in every position.</p>
<p>So the middle game and end game.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also I can think to some extent</p>
<p>both rapidly and deeply,</p>
<p>which a lot of people, they can&rsquo;t do both.</p>
<p>But I mean, to answer your question from before,</p>
<p>I think, yeah,</p>
<p>I sometimes can get a little bit intimidated</p>
<p>by my opponent,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mostly if there&rsquo;s something unknown.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly if it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t understand fully.</p>
<p>And I do think, especially when I&rsquo;m playing,</p>
<p>well, people, they just play more timidly against me</p>
<p>than they do against each other.</p>
<p>Sometimes without even realizing it.</p>
<p>And I certainly use that to my advantage.</p>
<p>If I sense that my opponent is apprehensive,</p>
<p>if I sense that they are not gonna necessarily</p>
<p>take all their chances,</p>
<p>it just means that I can take more risk.</p>
<p>And I always try and find that balance.</p>
<p>To shake them up a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been the toughest loss of your career</p>
<p>that you remember?</p>
<p>Would that be the World Championship match?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Game eight in 2016.</p>
<p>And who was it against?</p>
<p>Against Karjakin in New York.</p>
<p>Can you take it through the story of that game?</p>
<p>Where were you before that game</p>
<p>in terms of game one through seven?</p>
<p>Yeah, so game one and two, not much happened.</p>
<p>Game three and four, I was winning in both of them.</p>
<p>And normally, I should definitely have converted both.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t, partly due to good defense on his part,</p>
<p>but mostly because I just, I messed up.</p>
<p>And then after that, games five, six, and seven,</p>
<p>not much happened.</p>
<p>I was getting impatient at that point.</p>
<p>So for game eight, I was probably ready</p>
<p>to take a little bit more risks than I had</p>
<p>before, which I guess was insane</p>
<p>because I knew that he couldn&rsquo;t beat me</p>
<p>unless I beat myself.</p>
<p>Like he wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to outplay me.</p>
<p>And that was leading to impatience somehow?</p>
<p>And impatience.</p>
<p>No, because I knew that I was better.</p>
<p>I knew that I was better.</p>
<p>I knew that I just needed to win one game</p>
<p>and then the match is over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened in 2021 as well.</p>
<p>Like when I won the first game against Nebo,</p>
<p>I knew that the match was over</p>
<p>unless I like fuck up royally,</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;s not gonna be able to beat me.</p>
<p>So what happened was that I played</p>
<p>a kind of an innocuous opening as White,</p>
<p>just trying to get a game,</p>
<p>trying to get him out of book as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Then&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, can you elaborate?</p>
<p>Innocuous, get him out of the book.</p>
<p>No, basically I set up pretty defensively as White.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really crossing into his half at the start at all.</p>
<p>I was just, I played more like a system</p>
<p>more than like a concrete opening.</p>
<p>It was like, I&rsquo;m gonna set up my pieces this way.</p>
<p>You can set them up however you want.</p>
<p>And then later where sort of the armies are gonna meet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna try and bother you at the start.</p>
<p>And that means you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>with as many pieces as possible</p>
<p>kind of pure chess in the middle game</p>
<p>without any of the lines,</p>
<p>the standard lines in the opening.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so there was at some point</p>
<p>a couple of exchanges,</p>
<p>then some maneuvering, a little bit better.</p>
<p>Then he was sort of equalizing</p>
<p>and then I started to take too many risks.</p>
<p>And I was still sort of fine,</p>
<p>but then at some point I realized</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d gone a bit too far</p>
<p>and I had to be really careful.</p>
<p>Then I just froze.</p>
<p>I just completely froze.</p>
<p>Mentally?</p>
<p>Yeah, mentally.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>I realized that all the thoughts of I might lose this.</p>
<p>What have I done?</p>
<p>Why did I take so many risks?</p>
<p>I knew that I could have drawn at any moment.</p>
<p>Just be patient.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give him these opportunities.</p>
<p>What triggered that phase transition in your mind?</p>
<p>No, it was just a position on the board.</p>
<p>Realizing there was one particular move he played</p>
<p>that I missed.</p>
<p>And then I realized that this could potentially</p>
<p>not go my way.</p>
<p>So then I made another couple of mistakes</p>
<p>and he, to his credit,</p>
<p>once he realized he had the chance,</p>
<p>he knew that this was his one chance.</p>
<p>He had to take it.</p>
<p>And so he did.</p>
<p>And yeah, that&rsquo;s the worst I&rsquo;ve ever felt</p>
<p>after a chess game.</p>
<p>I realized that I&rsquo;m probably gonna lose my title</p>
<p>against somebody who&rsquo;s not even close to my level.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done it because of my own stupidity, most of all.</p>
<p>And that was really, really&hellip;</p>
<p>At the time, I was all in my own head.</p>
<p>That was hard to deal with.</p>
<p>And I felt like I didn&rsquo;t really recover too much</p>
<p>for the next game.</p>
<p>So what I did, there was a free day after the eighth game.</p>
<p>So I did something that I never did</p>
<p>at any other world championship.</p>
<p>Like after game eight, I just,</p>
<p>I got drunk with my team.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a standard procedure.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only time that&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>in the world championship during the match.</p>
<p>So yeah, I just tried to forget.</p>
<p>But still before game nine&hellip;</p>
<p>Game nine, I was a little bit more relaxed,</p>
<p>but I was still a bit nervous.</p>
<p>Then game nine, I almost lost as well.</p>
<p>Then only game 10.</p>
<p>Game 10, I was still, I wasn&rsquo;t in a great mood.</p>
<p>I was really, really tense.</p>
<p>The opening was good.</p>
<p>I had some advantage.</p>
<p>I was getting optimistic.</p>
<p>Then I made one mistake.</p>
<p>He could have forced a draw.</p>
<p>And then all the negativity came back.</p>
<p>Like, I was thinking during the game,</p>
<p>like how am I going to play for a win with Black</p>
<p>in the next game?</p>
<p>Like, what am I doing?</p>
<p>And then, you know, eventually it ended well.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t find the right line.</p>
<p>I ground him down.</p>
<p>Actually, I played at some point pretty well</p>
<p>in the end game.</p>
<p>And after that game, like there was such a weight.</p>
<p>Lifted? Lifted.</p>
<p>No, after that, there was like no thought</p>
<p>of losing the match whatsoever.</p>
<p>I knew that, okay, I&rsquo;d basically gotten away with,</p>
<p>not with murder, but gotten away with something.</p>
<p>What can you say about the after game eight?</p>
<p>Where are the places you&rsquo;ve gone in your mind?</p>
<p>Do you go to some dark places?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about like depression.</p>
<p>Do you think about quitting at that point?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think about quitting</p>
<p>every time I lose a classical game.</p>
<p>Or at least I used to.</p>
<p>Like, especially if it&rsquo;s in a stupid way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking like, okay, if I&rsquo;m gonna play like this,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m gonna do things that I know are wrong,</p>
<p>then, you know, I might as well quit.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s happened a bunch of times.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve definitely gotten a bit more carefree</p>
<p>about losing these days,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s not necessarily a good thing.</p>
<p>Like my hatred of losing led to me not losing a lot.</p>
<p>Losing a lot and it also lit the fire under me</p>
<p>that I think my performance after losses</p>
<p>in classical chess over the last 10 years</p>
<p>is like over 2,900.</p>
<p>Like I really play well after a loss,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s really, really unpleasant.</p>
<p>So apparently like I don&rsquo;t think the way</p>
<p>that I dealt with them is particularly healthy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s worked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worked so far.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;ve discovered now a love for winning</p>
<p>to where ultimately longevity wise creates more fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen</p>
<p>on a day of a big chess match?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be world championship,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s a chess match you care about,</p>
<p>what time do you wake up?</p>
<p>What do you eat?</p>
<p>Oh, it depends on when the game is,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say the game is at three,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably wake up pretty late at about 11.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll go for a walk,</p>
<p>might listen to some podcasts.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll spend a little bit of time</p>
<p>looking at some NBA game from last night or whatever.</p>
<p>So not chess related stuff?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll get back, I&rsquo;ll have a big lunch,</p>
<p>like usually like a big omelet</p>
<p>with a bunch of salad and stuff.</p>
<p>Then go to the game, win like a very nice clean game.</p>
<p>Perfect day.</p>
<p>Just go back after, relax.</p>
<p>Like the things that make me the happiest at tournaments</p>
<p>is just having a good routine and feeling well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it when too much is happening around me.</p>
<p>So the tournament that I came from now was</p>
<p>the Chess Olympiad, which is the team event.</p>
<p>So we were a team Norway.</p>
<p>We did horribly.</p>
<p>I did okay, but the team in general did horribly.</p>
<p>You won that Italy?</p>
<p>No, no, Italy beat us, but Uzbekistan won in the end.</p>
<p>They were this amazing team of young players.</p>
<p>It was really impressive.</p>
<p>But the thing is like we had a good comradery in the team.</p>
<p>We had our meals together.</p>
<p>We played a bit of football, went swimming,</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t understand why things went wrong.</p>
<p>And I still don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>But the thing is for me, it was all very nice,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m so happy to be on my own at a tournament</p>
<p>just to have my own routines, not see too many people.</p>
<p>Otherwise just have like a very small team of people</p>
<p>that I see.</p>
<p>You are a kind of celebrity now.</p>
<p>So people within the chess tournament and outside</p>
<p>would recognize you, want to socialize,</p>
<p>want to tell you about how much you mean to them,</p>
<p>how much you inspire them, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Does that get in the way for you</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re like trying to really focus on the match?</p>
<p>Are you able to block that?</p>
<p>Like are you able to enjoy those little interactions</p>
<p>and still keep your focus?</p>
<p>Yeah, most of the time that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s not too much.</p>
<p>But I have to admit, when I&rsquo;m at home in Norway,</p>
<p>I rarely go out without big headphones and something.</p>
<p>Oh, like a disguise?</p>
<p>No, not a disguise, just to block out the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Otherwise&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make eye contact?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, so the thing is people in general are nice.</p>
<p>I mean, people, they wish me well,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>Also, when I have the headphones on,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t notice as much people turning around and all of that</p>
<p>so I can be more of in my own world.</p>
<p>So I like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, what about in this perfect day after the game?</p>
<p>Do you try to analyze what happened?</p>
<p>Do you try to think through systematically</p>
<p>or do you just kind of loosely think about like&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I just loosely think about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been very structured in that sense.</p>
<p>I know that it was always recommended</p>
<p>that you analyze your own games,</p>
<p>but I generally felt that I mostly had a good idea</p>
<p>about that.</p>
<p>Like nowadays, I will loosely see what the engine says</p>
<p>at a certain point if I&rsquo;m curious about that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I usually move on to the next.</p>
<p>What about diet?</p>
<p>You said omelet and salad and so on.</p>
<p>I heard in your conversation with the other Magnus,</p>
<p>Magnus number two, about you had like this bet about meat.</p>
<p>One of you are gonna go vegan if you lose,</p>
<p>I forget which bet.</p>
<p>Vegetarian though.</p>
<p>Vegetarian, sorry.</p>
<p>And you both have an admiration for meat.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect about optimal performance</p>
<p>that you look for in food?</p>
<p>Like maybe eating only like once or twice a day</p>
<p>or a particular kind of food,</p>
<p>like meat heavy diet.</p>
<p>Is there anything like that?</p>
<p>Or are you just trying to have fun with the food?</p>
<p>I think whenever I&rsquo;m at tournaments,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s very natural to eat,</p>
<p>at least for me to eat only twice a day.</p>
<p>So usually I do that when I&rsquo;m at home as well.</p>
<p>So you do eat before the tournament though.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t play fasted.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>But I try not to eat too heavy before the game</p>
<p>or in general to avoid sugary stuff</p>
<p>to have a pretty stable blood sugar level.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s the easiest way to make mistake</p>
<p>that your energy levels just suddenly drop</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t necessarily need to be too high</p>
<p>as long as they&rsquo;re pretty stable, yeah.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried playing fasted,</p>
<p>like intermittent fasting?</p>
<p>So playing without having eaten.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason I ask, you know,</p>
<p>especially when you do a low carb diet,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve done a person at low carb diet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to fast for a long time,</p>
<p>like eat once a day, maybe twice a day.</p>
<p>But I just, the mind is most focused</p>
<p>on like really difficult thinking tasks when it&rsquo;s fasted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting,</p>
<p>and a lot of people kind of talk about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re able to kind of like zoom in</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re doing a low carb diet,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the energy stable.</p>
<p>You know, that is true.</p>
<p>Maybe that will be interesting to try.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happened for me,</p>
<p>I played a few tournaments where I&rsquo;ve had food poisoning</p>
<p>and then that generally means</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re both sleep deprived and you have no energy.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ve found is that it makes me,</p>
<p>it makes me very calm, of course,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have the energy</p>
<p>and it makes me super creative.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Sleep deprived probably I think in general</p>
<p>makes you creative.</p>
<p>Just the first thing that goes away</p>
<p>is the ability to do the simple things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it affects you the most.</p>
<p>Like you cannot be precise.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;m worried about.</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m fasted that I won&rsquo;t be precise when I play.</p>
<p>But you might be more creative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting trial.</p>
<p>Fasted, yeah, potentially.</p>
<p>What about you have been known to</p>
<p>on a rare occasion play drunk.</p>
<p>Is there a mathematical formula</p>
<p>for sort of on the X axis how many drinks you had</p>
<p>and on the Y axis your performance slash creativity?</p>
<p>Is there like an optimal for,</p>
<p>like one of the,</p>
<p>would you suggest for the FIDE World Championship</p>
<p>that people would be required to drink?</p>
<p>Would that change things in interesting ways?</p>
<p>Yeah, not at all.</p>
<p>Maybe for rapid, but for Blitz,</p>
<p>think if you&rsquo;re playing Blitz,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re mostly playing on short calculation and intuition.</p>
<p>And I think those are probably enhanced</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve had a little bit of, a little bit to drink.</p>
<p>Can you explain the physiology of why that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s enhanced or the?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re thinking less.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more confident.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s confidence.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just confidence.</p>
<p>I think also like a lot of people feel like they&rsquo;re better</p>
<p>at speaking languages, for instance,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;ve drunk a little bit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like removing these barriers.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s a little bit of the same in chess.</p>
<p>In 2012, I played the World Blitz Championship.</p>
<p>And then I was doing horribly for a long time.</p>
<p>I also had food poisoning there.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t play at all for three days.</p>
<p>So before the last break,</p>
<p>I was like in the middle of the pack, like in,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 20th place or something.</p>
<p>And so I decided like, as the last, last gasp,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go to the mini bar and just have a few drinks.</p>
<p>And what happened is that I came back</p>
<p>and I was suddenly relaxed and I was playing fast</p>
<p>and I was playing confidence.</p>
<p>And I thought I was playing so well.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t playing nearly as well as I thought,</p>
<p>but it still helped me.</p>
<p>Like I won my remaining eight games.</p>
<p>And if there had been one more round,</p>
<p>I probably would have won the whole thing.</p>
<p>But finally I was second.</p>
<p>So generally I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend that,</p>
<p>but maybe as the last resort sometimes,</p>
<p>like if you feel that you have the ability,</p>
<p>like obviously none of this is remotely relevant</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t feel like you have the ability to begin with.</p>
<p>But if you feel like you have the ability,</p>
<p>there are just factors that make it impossible</p>
<p>for you to show it.</p>
<p>Like numbing your mind a bit can probably be a good thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s interesting, especially during training,</p>
<p>you have all kinds of sports that have interacted</p>
<p>with a lot of athletes and grappling sports.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different when you train under extreme exhaustion.</p>
<p>For example, you start becoming,</p>
<p>you start to discover interesting things.</p>
<p>You start being more creative.</p>
<p>A lot of people, at least in Brazilian jiu jitsu,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll smoke weed.</p>
<p>It creates this kind of anxiety and relaxation</p>
<p>that kind of enables that creative aspect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting for training.</p>
<p>Of course you can&rsquo;t rely on any one of those things too much,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s cool to throw in like a few drinks</p>
<p>every once in a while to, yeah.</p>
<p>One, first of all, to relax and have fun.</p>
<p>And two, to kind of try things differently,</p>
<p>to unlock a different part of your brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>What about supplements?</p>
<p>Do you, are you a coffee guy?</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>I quite like the taste of coffee.</p>
<p>But the thing is I&rsquo;ve never had a job.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never needed to wake up early.</p>
<p>So my thought is basically that if I&rsquo;m tired, I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll, you know, then I&rsquo;ll work it out.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t wanna ever make my brain get used to coffee.</p>
<p>Like if you see me drinking coffee,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that probably means that I&rsquo;m massively,</p>
<p>massively hungover and I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I just want to try anything to make my brain work.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But for a lot of people, like you said, taste of coffee,</p>
<p>for a lot of people coffee is part</p>
<p>of a certain kind of ritual.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>That they enjoy, you know.</p>
<p>So, but you can have rituals without that.</p>
<p>I know that I would enjoy it a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, just you don&rsquo;t wanna rely on it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I also like the taste, so there&rsquo;s no problem there.</p>
<p>What about exercise?</p>
<p>So how does that, what like, what, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of people talk about the extreme</p>
<p>stress that chest puts in your body,</p>
<p>physically and mentally.</p>
<p>How do you prepare for that, to be physically and mentally?</p>
<p>Is it just through playing chess,</p>
<p>or do you do cardio and any of that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>This is kind of it up and down.</p>
<p>Like, as I said in 2013, I was in, I was in great shape.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, generally I was exercising,</p>
<p>doing sports every day, either playing football</p>
<p>or tennis or even other, other sports.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if I couldn&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>I would try and take my bike for a ride.</p>
<p>I had a few training camps and I played tennis</p>
<p>against one of my seconds.</p>
<p>Like, he&rsquo;s not a super fit guy,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s always been very good at tennis.</p>
<p>And I never like played in any organized way.</p>
<p>And that was like, that was the perfect exercise</p>
<p>because I was running around enough</p>
<p>to make the games pretty competitive.</p>
<p>And it meant that he had to run a bit less as well.</p>
<p>But he was just, he said like,</p>
<p>he was shocked that if we played like for two hours,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t flinch at all.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So like a combination of fun</p>
<p>and the differential between skill</p>
<p>result in good cardio.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s just that, so in those days I was pretty,</p>
<p>I was pretty fit in that sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always liked doing sports, but at times, you know,</p>
<p>I think in winter, especially,</p>
<p>like I never had like a schedule.</p>
<p>So at times I&rsquo;ll let myself go a little bit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always kind of done it more for fun</p>
<p>than like for a concrete benefit.</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m at least after the pandemic,</p>
<p>I was not in great shape.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m trying to get back, get better,</p>
<p>get better habits and so on.</p>
<p>But I feel like I&rsquo;ve always been the poster boy</p>
<p>for making being fit a big thing in chess.</p>
<p>And I always felt that it was not really a deserve</p>
<p>because I never liked doing weights much at all.</p>
<p>I run a bit at times, but I never liked it too much.</p>
<p>You just love playing sports.</p>
<p>I just love playing sports.</p>
<p>So that I think people confuse that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not like massively athletic,</p>
<p>but I do, I am decent at sports</p>
<p>and that sort of helped build that perception.</p>
<p>Even though others who are top level chess players,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more fit like Karana, for instance,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really, really, his body is really, really strong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He like goes to the gym and.</p>
<p>Yeah, if he doesn&rsquo;t play sports, that&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>And the thing about sports is also is just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an escape.</p>
<p>It helps you forget for a brief moment</p>
<p>about like the obsessions, the pursuits of the main thing,</p>
<p>which is chess.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s, it also helps your main pursuit</p>
<p>to feel that you&rsquo;re even if not mastering,</p>
<p>but like doing well in something, in something else.</p>
<p>Like I found that if I just juggle a ball,</p>
<p>that makes me feel better before a game.</p>
<p>So a skilled activity.</p>
<p>Juggle of football, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, skilled activity that you can improve on over time.</p>
<p>It like flexes the same kind of muscle,</p>
<p>but on the thing that you&rsquo;re much worse at.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It focuses you, relaxes you, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s training?</p>
<p>So like, what&rsquo;s a good training regimen</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, daily kind of training</p>
<p>that you have to put in across many days, months, and years</p>
<p>to just keep yourself sharp in terms of chess?</p>
<p>I would say when I&rsquo;m at home, I do very little</p>
<p>deliberate practice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been that guy at all.</p>
<p>Like I could never force myself to just sit down and work.</p>
<p>So deliberate practice, just so maybe you can educate me,</p>
<p>for some grandmasters, what would that look like?</p>
<p>Just doing puzzles kind of thing?</p>
<p>Or like?</p>
<p>Yeah, doing puzzles and opening analysis.</p>
<p>That would be the main things.</p>
<p>Studying games?</p>
<p>Just studying games, yeah, a little bit.</p>
<p>But I feel like that&rsquo;s something that I do.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not deliberate, it&rsquo;s like reading an article</p>
<p>or reading a book.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Like I love chess books, I&rsquo;ll read just anything</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll find something interesting.</p>
<p>So chess books that are like on openings</p>
<p>and stuff like that, or chess books</p>
<p>that go over different games?</p>
<p>Yeah, books on, so there are three main categories.</p>
<p>There are books on openings and there are books</p>
<p>on strategy and there are books on chess history</p>
<p>and I find all of them very, very interesting.</p>
<p>Like what fraction of the day would you say</p>
<p>you have a chess board floating somewhere in your head?</p>
<p>Meaning like you&rsquo;re thinking about it.</p>
<p>Probably be a better question to ask,</p>
<p>how many hours a day I don&rsquo;t have a chess board floating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean it could be just floating there and nothing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening, but like.</p>
<p>I often do it parallel to some other activity though.</p>
<p>And what does that look like?</p>
<p>Like are you daydreaming like different,</p>
<p>is it actual positions you&rsquo;re just fucking around with?</p>
<p>Like fumbling with different pieces in your head?</p>
<p>Often I&rsquo;ve looked at a random game on my phone for instance</p>
<p>or in a book and then my brain just keeps going</p>
<p>at the same position analyzing it and often it goes</p>
<p>all the way to the end game.</p>
<p>And those are actual games or you conjure up like fake games?</p>
<p>No, they were often based on real games</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m thinking like oh, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>more interesting if the pieces were a little bit different</p>
<p>and then often I play it out from there.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have, like you don&rsquo;t sit behind a computer</p>
<p>or a chess board and you lay out the pieces and then you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not at all a poster boy for deliberate practice.</p>
<p>I could never, I could never work that way.</p>
<p>My first coach, he gave me some exercises</p>
<p>that are at home sometimes, but he realized at some point</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t gonna work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I wouldn&rsquo;t do it really or enjoy it.</p>
<p>So what he would do instead is that at the school</p>
<p>where I had the trainings with him,</p>
<p>there was this massive chess library.</p>
<p>So he was just like yeah, pick out books.</p>
<p>You can have anything, you can have anything you want.</p>
<p>Just pick out books you like</p>
<p>and then you give it back the next time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did instead.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just absolutely raided the,</p>
<p>then my next tournament I will try out one of the openings</p>
<p>from that book if it was an opening book and so on.</p>
<p>Does it feel like a struggle, like challenging?</p>
<p>Like to be thinking those positions</p>
<p>or is it fun and relaxing?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s completely fine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s a difficult position to figure out,</p>
<p>you know, like to calculate.</p>
<p>Then I go on to something else.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like if I can&rsquo;t figure it out, then you know, I go on.</p>
<p>Change it so that it&rsquo;s easier to figure out.</p>
<p>There was a point in your life</p>
<p>where Kasparov was interested in being your coach</p>
<p>or at least training with you.</p>
<p>Why did you choose not to go with him?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty bold move.</p>
<p>Was there a good reason for this?</p>
<p>No, the first like homework exercise he gave me</p>
<p>was to analyze, like he picked out, I think,</p>
<p>three or four of my worst losses</p>
<p>and he wanted me to analyze them and give him my thoughts.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t that there were painful losses or anything</p>
<p>that that was a problem.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t really enjoy that.</p>
<p>Also, I felt that this whole structured approach</p>
<p>and everything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just felt like from the start, it was a hassle.</p>
<p>So I loved the idea of being able to pick his brain</p>
<p>but everything else, I just, you know,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t see myself, couldn&rsquo;t see myself enjoying.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I did then and always have played for fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always been the main reason, so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great that you had the confidence</p>
<p>to sort of basically turn down the approach</p>
<p>of one of the greatest chess players of all time.</p>
<p>At that time, probably the greatest chess player</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I thought of it that way.</p>
<p>I just thought this is not for me.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t try another way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I was particularly thinking</p>
<p>that this is my one opportunity or anything.</p>
<p>It was just, yeah, I don&rsquo;t enjoy this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try something else.</p>
<p>When you were 13, you faced Kasparov</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t able to beat you.</p>
<p>Can you go through that match?</p>
<p>What did that feel like?</p>
<p>How important was that?</p>
<p>Was that, how epic was that?</p>
<p>We played three games.</p>
<p>I lost two and I drew one.</p>
<p>Right, but one draw.</p>
<p>No, the one draw.</p>
<p>And but didn&rsquo;t you say</p>
<p>that you kind of had a better position in that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember that day very well.</p>
<p>There was a Blitz game.</p>
<p>This was a rapid tournament</p>
<p>and there was a Blitz tournament the day before</p>
<p>which determined the pairings for the rapid.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>super short games are called bullet.</p>
<p>Kind of short games are called Blitz.</p>
<p>Semi short games are called rapid.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And classic chess, I guess, is like very super long.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically, bullet is just never played</p>
<p>over the board.</p>
<p>So in terms of over the board chess,</p>
<p>Blitz is the shortest.</p>
<p>Rapid is like a hybrid between classical and Blitz.</p>
<p>You need to have the skills to both</p>
<p>and then classical is long.</p>
<p>The Blitz tournament, which didn&rsquo;t go so well.</p>
<p>Like I got a couple of wins,</p>
<p>but I was beaten badly in a lot of games,</p>
<p>including by Gary.</p>
<p>And so there was the pairing that I had to play him</p>
<p>which was pretty exciting.</p>
<p>So I remember I was so tired after the Blitz tournament.</p>
<p>Like I slept for 12 hours or something.</p>
<p>Then I woke up like,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ll turn on my computer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll search chess space for Kasparov</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll go from there.</p>
<p>So before that, I hadn&rsquo;t spent like a lot of time</p>
<p>specifically studying his games.</p>
<p>It was super intimidating</p>
<p>because a lot of these openings I knew.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, he was the first one to play that.</p>
<p>Oh, that was his idea.</p>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So I was a bit intimidated before we played.</p>
<p>Then of course the first game,</p>
<p>he arrived a bit late because they changed the time</p>
<p>from the first day to the other, which was a bit strange.</p>
<p>But everybody else had noticed it but him.</p>
<p>Then he tried to surprise me in the opening.</p>
<p>I think like psychologically,</p>
<p>the situation was not so easy for him.</p>
<p>Like clearly it would be embarrassing for him</p>
<p>if he didn&rsquo;t win both games against me.</p>
<p>Then like I was spending way too much time on my moves</p>
<p>because I was playing Kasparov.</p>
<p>I was double checking everything too much.</p>
<p>Like normally I would be playing pretty fast in those days.</p>
<p>And then at some point I calculated better than him.</p>
<p>He missed a crucial detail and had a much better position.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t convert it though.</p>
<p>I knew what line I had to go for</p>
<p>in order to have a chance to win.</p>
<p>But I thought like, I&rsquo;ll play a bit more carefully.</p>
<p>Maybe I can win still.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And then I lost the second game pretty badly,</p>
<p>which it wasn&rsquo;t majorly upsetting,</p>
<p>but I felt that I had two black games</p>
<p>against Kasparov both in the blitz and the rapid</p>
<p>and I lost both of them without any fight whatsoever.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t happy about that at all.</p>
<p>That was like less than I thought I could be able to do.</p>
<p>So to me, yeah, I was proud of that, but it was a gimmick.</p>
<p>That was like a very strong IAM that had GM strength.</p>
<p>I was like, it can happen that a player of that strength</p>
<p>makes a draw against Gary once in a while.</p>
<p>But I mean, I understand that I&rsquo;m 13,</p>
<p>but like still I felt a bit more gimmicky than anything.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s a good thing that made me noticed,</p>
<p>but apart from that, it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>IAM is international master and GM is grand master.</p>
<p>And you were just on the, I guess,</p>
<p>on the verge of becoming a youngest grand master ever.</p>
<p>I was the second youngest ever.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m like the seventh youngest now.</p>
<p>I mean, these kids these days.</p>
<p>Kids these days.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I was the youngest grand master at the time</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there is a, you say it&rsquo;s gimmicky,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a romantic notions,</p>
<p>especially as things have turned out, right?</p>
<p>No, for sure.</p>
<p>And have you talked to Gary since then about that?</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s immersed.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still bitter, you think?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s bitter,</p>
<p>but I think the game in itself was a bit embarrassing for him.</p>
<p>Even he can&rsquo;t see past like&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s completely fine with that.</p>
<p>I think like in retrospect, it&rsquo;s a good story.</p>
<p>He appreciates that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the problem,</p>
<p>but it never made sense for me to broach the subject with him.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny just having interacted with Gary,</p>
<p>now having talked to you,</p>
<p>there is a little thing you still hate losing.</p>
<p>No matter how beautiful like that moment is,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, in a way it&rsquo;s a passing of the baton</p>
<p>from like one great champion to another, right?</p>
<p>But you still just don&rsquo;t like the fact</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t play a good game from Gary&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>Like he still is just annoyed probably</p>
<p>that he could have played better.</p>
<p>And we did, so we did work together in 2009, quite a lot.</p>
<p>And that corporation ended early 2010,</p>
<p>but we did play a lot of training games in 2009,</p>
<p>which was interesting because he was still very, very strong.</p>
<p>And at that time it was fairly equal.</p>
<p>Like he was out playing me quite a bit,</p>
<p>but I was fighting well, so it was pretty even then.</p>
<p>So I mean, I appreciate those games a lot more</p>
<p>than some random game from when I was 13.</p>
<p>And maybe I just don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always found it, at least based on that game,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t tell that I was gonna take his,</p>
<p>that I was gonna take his spot.</p>
<p>Like I made a horrible blunder and lost to an Uzbek kid</p>
<p>in the World Rapid Championship in 2018.</p>
<p>And I mean, granted he was part of the team</p>
<p>that now won gold in the Chess Olympia,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t the crucial part.</p>
<p>He barely played any games.</p>
<p>Like it wasn&rsquo;t like I would think</p>
<p>that he would become world champion because he beat me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always skeptical of those who said</p>
<p>that they knew that I was gonna be world champion</p>
<p>after that game or at all at that time.</p>
<p>I mean, it was easy to see</p>
<p>that I would become a very, very strong player.</p>
<p>Everybody could see that,</p>
<p>but to be the best in the world or one of the best ever,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>It is hard to say, but I do remember seeing Messi</p>
<p>when he was 16 and 17.</p>
<p>But hasn&rsquo;t that happened with other players though?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I just had a personal experience.</p>
<p>He did look different than, there&rsquo;s like magic there.</p>
<p>Maybe you can&rsquo;t tell he would be one of the greatest ever,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still magic.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Most of the time we try to project,</p>
<p>we see a young kid being an older person</p>
<p>and you start to think,</p>
<p>okay, this could be the next great person.</p>
<p>Then we forget when they don&rsquo;t become that.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I think what happens.</p>
<p>But when it does become.</p>
<p>Or maybe some people are just so good</p>
<p>at seeing these patterns that they can actually see.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to do that kind of thing</p>
<p>with fantasy football, like see the long shot</p>
<p>and bet on them and then they turn out to be good?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>No, you make a lot of long shot bets</p>
<p>and then some of them come good.</p>
<p>And then people call you a genius for making the bet.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you the goat question again,</p>
<p>from fantasy perspective.</p>
<p>Can you make the case for the greatest chess player</p>
<p>of all time for each yourself, Magnus Carlsen,</p>
<p>for Garry Kasparov, I don&rsquo;t know who else,</p>
<p>Bobby Fischer, Mikhail Atal, anyone else,</p>
<p>for Hikaru Nakamura?</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I can make a case for myself,</p>
<p>for Garry and for Fischer.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll start with Fischer.</p>
<p>For him, it&rsquo;s very, very simple.</p>
<p>He was ahead of his time, but that&rsquo;s like intangible.</p>
<p>You can say that about a lot of people.</p>
<p>But he had a peak from 1970 to 72</p>
<p>when he was so much better than the others.</p>
<p>He won 20 games in a row.</p>
<p>Also the way that he played was so powerful</p>
<p>and with so few mistakes</p>
<p>that he just had no opposition there.</p>
<p>So he had just a peak that&rsquo;s been better than anybody.</p>
<p>The gap between first and second was the highest.</p>
<p>The gap between him and others was greater</p>
<p>than it&rsquo;s ever been in history at any other time.</p>
<p>And that would be the argument for him.</p>
<p>For Garry, he&rsquo;s played in a very competitive era</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s beaten several generations.</p>
<p>He was the best, well, he was the consensus best player,</p>
<p>I would say for almost 20 years,</p>
<p>which nobody else has done at least in recent time.</p>
<p>So the longevity.</p>
<p>The longevity for sure.</p>
<p>Also at his peak, he was not quite the level of Fisher</p>
<p>in terms of the gap, but it was similar to,</p>
<p>or I think even a little bit better than mine.</p>
<p>As for me, I&rsquo;m of course unbeaten</p>
<p>as a world champion in five tries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been world number one for 11 years straight</p>
<p>in an even more competitive era than Garry.</p>
<p>I have the highest chest rating of all time.</p>
<p>I have the longest streak ever without losing a game.</p>
<p>I think for me, the main argument would be about the era</p>
<p>where the engines have leveled the playing field so much</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s harder to dominate.</p>
<p>And still, I haven&rsquo;t always been a clear number one,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been number one for 11 years.</p>
<p>And for a lot of the time, the gap has been pretty big.</p>
<p>So I think there are decent arguments for all of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before, and I haven&rsquo;t changed my mind</p>
<p>that Garry generally edges it</p>
<p>because of the longevity in the competitive era,</p>
<p>but there are arguments.</p>
<p>But people also talk about you</p>
<p>in terms of the style of play.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about dominance or the height or the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like just the creative genius of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m not interested in that.</p>
<p>In terms of greatest of all time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in questions of style.</p>
<p>So for Messi, you don&rsquo;t give credit for the style,</p>
<p>for the stylistic.</p>
<p>I like, no, I like watching it, I just.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not gonna give points for the,</p>
<p>so Messi gets the best ever because of the finishing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the, no, it&rsquo;s not because of the finishing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of his overall impact on the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s higher than anybody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He contributes, he just contributes more to winning</p>
<p>than anybody else does.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, so you&rsquo;re somebody who was advocated for</p>
<p>and has done quite a bit of study of classic games.</p>
<p>What would you say is, I mean, maybe the number one</p>
<p>or maybe top three games of chess ever played?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t interest me at all.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think of them, that was very curious.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think of it.</p>
<p>I mean, I try to, I find the games interesting.</p>
<p>I try to learn from them, but like trying to rank them</p>
<p>has never interested me.</p>
<p>What games pop out to you as like super interesting then?</p>
<p>Is there things like where idea, like old school games</p>
<p>where there was like interesting ideas that you go back,</p>
<p>that you go back or like you find surprising</p>
<p>and pretty cool that those ideas are developed like that?</p>
<p>Is there something that jumps to mind?</p>
<p>Yeah, there are several games of young Kasparov,</p>
<p>like before he became world champion.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna ask for like my favorite player</p>
<p>or favorite style, that&rsquo;s probably.</p>
<p>Young Kasparov.</p>
<p>Can you describe stylistically or in any other way</p>
<p>what young Kasparov was like that you like?</p>
<p>It was just an overflow energy in his play.</p>
<p>So aggressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, extremely aggressive, dynamic chess.</p>
<p>It probably appeals to me a lot because these are the things</p>
<p>that I cannot do as well,</p>
<p>that it just feels very special to me.</p>
<p>But yeah, in terms of games,</p>
<p>I never thought about that too much.</p>
<p>Is there memories, big or small, weird, surprising,</p>
<p>just any kind of beautiful anecdote from your chess career?</p>
<p>Like stuff that pops out that people might not know about?</p>
<p>Just stuff when you look back, it just makes you smile.</p>
<p>No, so I&rsquo;ll tell you about the most satisfying</p>
<p>tournament victory of my career.</p>
<p>So that was the Norwegian championship under 11 in 2000.</p>
<p>Before that tournament, I was super anxious</p>
<p>because I started like kind of late at chess.</p>
<p>I played my first tournament when I was eight and a half.</p>
<p>And a lot of my competitors had already played</p>
<p>for a couple of years or even three, four years</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>And the first time I,</p>
<p>so I played the under 11 championship in 99.</p>
<p>I was like a little over the middle of the pack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never played against any of them before.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect at all.</p>
<p>And then over the next year,</p>
<p>I was just like edging a little bit closer.</p>
<p>In each tournament, I felt like I was getting</p>
<p>a little bit better.</p>
<p>And when we had the championship,</p>
<p>I knew that I was ready,</p>
<p>that I was now at the same level of the best players.</p>
<p>I was so anxious to show it.</p>
<p>I remember I was just,</p>
<p>the feeling of excitement and nervousness</p>
<p>before the tournament was incredible.</p>
<p>The tournament was weird because I started out,</p>
<p>I gave away a draw to a weaker player,</p>
<p>whom I shouldn&rsquo;t have drawn to.</p>
<p>And then I drew against the other guy</p>
<p>who was clearly like the best or second best.</p>
<p>And at that point, I thought it was over</p>
<p>because I thought he wouldn&rsquo;t give away points to others.</p>
<p>And then the very next day he lost to somebody.</p>
<p>So then the rest of the tournament,</p>
<p>it was just like,</p>
<p>I was always like playing my game and watching his.</p>
<p>And we both won the rest of our games,</p>
<p>but it meant that I was half a point ahead.</p>
<p>Like the feeling when I realized that I was gonna win,</p>
<p>that was just so amazing.</p>
<p>It was like the first time that I was the best at my age.</p>
<p>And at that point.</p>
<p>You were hooked.</p>
<p>Yeah, at that point I realized,</p>
<p>I could actually be very good at this.</p>
<p>So you kind of saw,</p>
<p>what did you think your ceiling would be?</p>
<p>Did you see that one day you could be the number one?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t think that was possible at all.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>When did you first?</p>
<p>I could be the best in Norway.</p>
<p>The best in Norway?</p>
<p>At that point.</p>
<p>When did you first?</p>
<p>Because like I started relatively late.</p>
<p>Right, so yeah.</p>
<p>And also like,</p>
<p>I knew that I studied a lot more than the others.</p>
<p>I knew that I had a passion that they didn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>They saw chess as something like,</p>
<p>it was a hobby.</p>
<p>It was like an activity.</p>
<p>It was like going to football practice</p>
<p>or any other sports.</p>
<p>Like you go,</p>
<p>you practice like once or twice a week,</p>
<p>and then you play a tournament at the weekend.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you did.</p>
<p>For me, it wasn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>Like I would go with my books and my board</p>
<p>every day after school.</p>
<p>And I would just constantly</p>
<p>be trying to learn new things.</p>
<p>I had like two hours of internet time</p>
<p>on the computer each week.</p>
<p>And I would always spend them on chess.</p>
<p>Like I think before I was 13 or 14,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never opened a browser</p>
<p>for any other reason than to play chess.</p>
<p>Would you describe that as love or as obsession</p>
<p>or something in between?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everything?</p>
<p>Yeah, everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, everything, so I mean,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t hard for me to tell at that point</p>
<p>that I had something that the other kids didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because I was never the one to grasp something</p>
<p>very, very quickly.</p>
<p>But once I started, I always got hooked</p>
<p>and then I never stopped learning.</p>
<p>What would you say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about the middle game</p>
<p>as a place where you can play pure chess.</p>
<p>What do you think is beautiful to you about chess?</p>
<p>Like the thing when you were 11.</p>
<p>What is beautiful to me is when your opponent</p>
<p>can predict every single one of your moves</p>
<p>and they still lose.</p>
<p>How does that happen?</p>
<p>No, like it means that at some point early,</p>
<p>your planning, your evaluation has been better.</p>
<p>So that you play just very simply, very clearly.</p>
<p>It looks like you did nothing special</p>
<p>and your opponent lost without a chance.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, how do you think about that?</p>
<p>By the way, are you basically narrowed down</p>
<p>this gigantic tree of options</p>
<p>to where your opponent has less and less and less options</p>
<p>to win, to escape, and then they&rsquo;re trapped.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Essentially.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect to the patterns themselves,</p>
<p>to the positions, to the elegance of like</p>
<p>the dynamics of the game that you just find beautiful</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t, that where you forget about the opponent?</p>
<p>General, I try and create harmony on the board.</p>
<p>Like what I would usually find harmonious is that</p>
<p>the pieces work together, that they protect each other</p>
<p>and that there are no pieces that are suboptimally placed.</p>
<p>Or if they are suboptimally placed,</p>
<p>they can be improved pretty easily.</p>
<p>Like I hate when I have one piece that I know</p>
<p>is badly placed and I can&rsquo;t improve it.</p>
<p>When, yeah, when you&rsquo;re thinking about the harmony</p>
<p>of the pieces, when you&rsquo;re looking at the position,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re evaluating it, are you looking at the whole board</p>
<p>or is it like a bunch of groupings of pieces overlapping?</p>
<p>I would like dancing together kind of thing.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s more of the latter</p>
<p>that would be more precise that you look.</p>
<p>I mean, I look mostly closer to the middle,</p>
<p>but then I would focus on one,</p>
<p>like there are usually like one grouping of pieces</p>
<p>on one side and then some more closer to the other side.</p>
<p>So I would think of it a little bit that way.</p>
<p>So, and everything&rsquo;s kind of gravitating to the middle.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going well, then yes.</p>
<p>And in harmony.</p>
<p>Yeah, in harmony.</p>
<p>Or like if you can control the middle,</p>
<p>you can more easily attack on both sides.</p>
<p>That applies to pretty much any game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>And like attacking on one side without control of the middle</p>
<p>would feel very nonharmonious for me.</p>
<p>Like I talked about the 10th game</p>
<p>in the World Championship.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the time I was the most nervous.</p>
<p>And it was because it was the kind of attack that I hate</p>
<p>where you just have to, you&rsquo;re abandoned one side</p>
<p>and the attack has to work.</p>
<p>There was one side and part of the middle as well,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t control at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the opposite of harmony for me.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to chess players</p>
<p>of different levels, how to improve in chess?</p>
<p>Very beginner, complete beginner.</p>
<p>I mean, at every level, is there something you can say?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for me to say.</p>
<p>Because I mean, the easiest way is like love chess,</p>
<p>be obsessed.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a really important statement.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t work for everybody.</p>
<p>So I feel like it can feel like a grind.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying the less it can feel like a grind,</p>
<p>the better, at least for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also very, very skeptical about giving advice</p>
<p>because I think, again, my way only works</p>
<p>if you have some combination of talent and obsession.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;d generally recommend it.</p>
<p>Like what I&rsquo;ve done doesn&rsquo;t go with</p>
<p>what most coaches suggest for their kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky that I&rsquo;ve had coaches from early on</p>
<p>that have been very, very hands off</p>
<p>and just allowed me to do my thing, basically.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot to be said</p>
<p>about cultivating the obsession.</p>
<p>Like really letting that flourish</p>
<p>to where you spend a lot of hours</p>
<p>like with the chessboard in your head</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a struggle.</p>
<p>No, so like just letting me do my thing.</p>
<p>Like if you give me a bunch of work,</p>
<p>it will probably feel like a chore.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t give me,</p>
<p>I will spend all of that time on my own</p>
<p>without thinking that it&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>or without thought that I&rsquo;m doing this to improve my chess.</p>
<p>Well, in terms of learning stuff, like books,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s relatively novel</p>
<p>from your perspective that people are starting now</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s YouTube.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of good YouTubers.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a part time YouTuber.</p>
<p>You have stuff on YouTube, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have, but if you&rsquo;ve seen my YouTube,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mostly like, it&rsquo;s carefree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally not high effort content.</p>
<p>Yeah, but do you like any particular YouTubers?</p>
<p>I could just recommend like stuff I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>So Aged Madar, Gotham Chess, Botez Live.</p>
<p>I really like St. Louis Chess Club,</p>
<p>Daniel Narodetsky, and John Bartholomew.</p>
<p>Those are good channels,</p>
<p>but is there something you can recommend?</p>
<p>No, all of them are good.</p>
<p>You know, the best recommendation I could give</p>
<p>is Aged Madar, purely.</p>
<p>How much did he pay you to say that?</p>
<p>No, so the thing about that is that I haven&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I have, so I can tell you I&rsquo;ve never watched</p>
<p>any of his videos from start to finish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like, I&rsquo;m not the target audience, obviously.</p>
<p>But I think the only chess YouTube video</p>
<p>that my dad has ever watched from start to finish</p>
<p>is Aged Madar, and he said, like,</p>
<p>I watched one of his videos,</p>
<p>I wanted to know what it was all about,</p>
<p>because I think Aged Madar is like the same strength</p>
<p>as my father, or maybe just a little bit weaker,</p>
<p>like 1900 or something.</p>
<p>My father is probably about 2000.</p>
<p>And my father has played chess his whole life.</p>
<p>He loves, he absolutely loves the game.</p>
<p>It was like, that&rsquo;s the only time he&rsquo;s actually sat through</p>
<p>one of those videos, and he said, like,</p>
<p>yeah, I get it, I enjoy it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the best recommendation I could give.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only channel that my father actually enjoys.</p>
<p>This is hilarious.</p>
<p>I talked to him before this to ask him</p>
<p>if he has any questions for you.</p>
<p>And he said, no, just do your thing, you know.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s so careful, he wouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>He did mention jokingly about Evan&rsquo;s Gambit, I think.</p>
<p>Is that a thing?</p>
<p>Evan&rsquo;s Gambit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some weird thing he made up.</p>
<p>It might be an inside joke.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but he asked me to.</p>
<p>Well, anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t even get the&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something he made up.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even realize that he plays the Evan&rsquo;s Gambit.</p>
<p>Like, he plays a lot of Gambits that are&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait, Evan&rsquo;s Gambit is a thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s an old opening from the 1800s.</p>
<p>Captain Evans apparently invented it.</p>
<p>Why would he mention that particular one?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is there something hilarious about that one?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever faced the Evan&rsquo;s Gambit in a game.</p>
<p>I feel like both of you are trolling me right now.</p>
<p>But I mean, he&rsquo;s played a lot of other Gambits.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the one he wanted to mention.</p>
<p>So this, maybe this is called the Evan&rsquo;s Gambit as well.</p>
<p>But I just know it as like the 2G4 Gambit.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the one.</p>
<p>Like this one, he has played a bunch.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been telling me a lot about his games</p>
<p>in this line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, but you&rsquo;re a pawn down.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I can sort of see it.</p>
<p>I can sort of understand it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s proud of the fact</p>
<p>that nobody like told him to play this line or anything.</p>
<p>He came up with it himself.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this, I&rsquo;ll tell you another story</p>
<p>about my father.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this line that I call,</p>
<p>that I called the Henry Carlson line.</p>
<p>So at some point, you know,</p>
<p>he never knew a lot of openings in chess,</p>
<p>but I taught him a couple of openings as black.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, it&rsquo;s the Sveshnikov&rsquo;s Sicilian</p>
<p>that I played a lot myself also</p>
<p>during the world championship in 2018.</p>
<p>I won a bunch of games in 2019 as well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one opening.</p>
<p>And I also taught him as black</p>
<p>to play the Rogozin defense.</p>
<p>And then, so the Rogozin defense goes like,</p>
<p>goes like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s characterized by this bishop move.</p>
<p>And so he would play those openings pretty,</p>
<p>pretty exclusively as black</p>
<p>in the tournaments that he did play.</p>
<p>And also the Sveshnikov Sicilian is like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only, two of my sisters play,</p>
<p>have played a bunch of chess tournaments as well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only opening they know as well.</p>
<p>So my family&rsquo;s portrait is very narrow.</p>
<p>So, so this is the, this is the system.</p>
<p>Black goes here and then we all from white takes the pawn</p>
<p>and black takes the pawn.</p>
<p>So at some point I was watching one of my,</p>
<p>my father&rsquo;s online blitz game, blitz game.</p>
<p>And as white, he played this, this.</p>
<p>So this is called the Karkhan defense.</p>
<p>He took the pawn.</p>
<p>It was taken back, then he went with the knight.</p>
<p>His opponent went here and then he played a bishop here.</p>
<p>So I, I&rsquo;d never seen this opening before.</p>
<p>And I was like, wow, how on earth did he come up with that?</p>
<p>And he said, no, I just played the Rogozin</p>
<p>with the different colors</p>
<p>because if the knight was here,</p>
<p>it would be the same position.</p>
<p>I was like, I never, I was like,</p>
<p>how, how am I like one of the best players in the world?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never thought about that.</p>
<p>So I actually started playing,</p>
<p>I started playing this line as white</p>
<p>with pretty decent result and then results.</p>
<p>And it actually became kind of popular</p>
<p>and everybody who asked about the line,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I would always tell them,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s the Henry Carlson.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily explain why it was called that.</p>
<p>I would just always call it that.</p>
<p>So I really hope at this point, at some point,</p>
<p>this line will be, will find its rightful name.</p>
<p>In the, yeah, finds its way into the history books.</p>
<p>Can you, what, what, what&rsquo;d you learn about life</p>
<p>from your dad?</p>
<p>What role has your dad played in your life?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s taught me a lot of things, but most of all,</p>
<p>as long as you win a chess, then everything else is fine.</p>
<p>I think my, especially my father,</p>
<p>but my parents in general, they,</p>
<p>they always wanted me to get a good education</p>
<p>and find a job and so on.</p>
<p>Even though my father loves chess</p>
<p>and he wanted me to play chess,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he had any plans for me to be professional.</p>
<p>I think things changed at some point.</p>
<p>Like I was less and less interested in school</p>
<p>and for a long time, we were kind of going back and forth,</p>
<p>fighting about that, especially my father,</p>
<p>but also my mother a little bit.</p>
<p>It was at times a little bit difficult.</p>
<p>They wanted you to go to school.</p>
<p>Yeah, they sort of wanted me to do more school</p>
<p>to have more options.</p>
<p>And then I think at some point,</p>
<p>they just gave up, but I think that sort of coincided</p>
<p>when I was actually starting to make real money</p>
<p>off tournaments.</p>
<p>And after that, you know, everything&rsquo;s been sort of easy</p>
<p>and like terms of the family,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ve never put any pressure on me</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ve never put any demands on me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just, yeah, my ass has to focus on chess.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Like, I think they taught me in general</p>
<p>to be curious about the world</p>
<p>and to get a decent general education,</p>
<p>not necessarily from school,</p>
<p>but like just knowing about the world around you</p>
<p>and knowing history and being, you know,</p>
<p>just being interested in society.</p>
<p>I think in that sense, they&rsquo;ve done well.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been with you throughout your chess career.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something to be said about just family,</p>
<p>support and love that you have that, you know,</p>
<p>this world is a lonely place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have people around you that are like,</p>
<p>yeah, they got your back kind of, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cliche, but I think to some extent,</p>
<p>all the people you surround yourself with,</p>
<p>they can help you a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only family that only has their own interests at heart.</p>
<p>And so for that reason, like my father&rsquo;s like the only one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been like constantly in the team</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s always been around.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s for that reason that I know he has my back,</p>
<p>no matter what.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a cliche question here,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s try to actually get to some deep truth perhaps.</p>
<p>But people who don&rsquo;t know much about chess</p>
<p>seem to like to use chess as a metaphor</p>
<p>for everything in life.</p>
<p>But there is some aspect to the decision making</p>
<p>to the kind of reasoning involved in chess</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s transferable to other things.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that in your own life and in general?</p>
<p>Like the kind of reasoning involved with chess,</p>
<p>how much does that transfer to life out there?</p>
<p>It just helps you make decisions.</p>
<p>Of all kinds.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be my main takeaway.</p>
<p>That you learn to make informed guesses</p>
<p>in a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>I mean, does it frustrate you when you have</p>
<p>geopolitical thinkers and leaders?</p>
<p>You know, Henry Kissinger will often talk about</p>
<p>geopolitics as a game of chess or 3D chess.</p>
<p>Is that too oversimplified of a projection?</p>
<p>Or do you think that the kind of deliberations</p>
<p>you have on the world stage is similar</p>
<p>to the kind of decision making you have on the chessboard?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m never trying to get reelected</p>
<p>when I play a game of chess.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no special interest, you have to get happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, that kind of helps.</p>
<p>No, I can understand that.</p>
<p>Obviously, for every action, there&rsquo;s a reaction</p>
<p>and you have to calculate far ahead.</p>
<p>It probably would be a good thing</p>
<p>if more big players on the international scene</p>
<p>thought a little bit more like a chess player in that sense,</p>
<p>like trying to make good decision</p>
<p>based on limited amount of data,</p>
<p>rather than thinking about other factors,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so tough.</p>
<p>But it does annoy me when people make moves</p>
<p>that they know are wrong for different reasons.</p>
<p>And they should know, if they did some calculation,</p>
<p>they should know they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, that they should know that are wrong.</p>
<p>And so much politics is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re often asked to do something</p>
<p>when it would be much better to do nothing.</p>
<p>Like, no, but that happens in chess all the time,</p>
<p>like you have a choice.</p>
<p>Like I often tell people that in certain situations,</p>
<p>you should not try and win,</p>
<p>you should just let your opponent lose.</p>
<p>And that happens in politics all the time.</p>
<p>But yeah, just let your opponents</p>
<p>continue whatever they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll win.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to do something just to do something.</p>
<p>Often, they say in chess that having a bad plan</p>
<p>is better than having no plan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>I forget what General said it,</p>
<p>but it was like, don&rsquo;t interrupt your enemy</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re making a mistake.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>Also, Petrosian, the former world champion said,</p>
<p>when your opponent wants to play Dutch defense,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t stop them.</p>
<p>I mean, chess players will know that it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>Actually, this reminds me,</p>
<p>is there something you found really impressive</p>
<p>about Queen&rsquo;s Gambit, the TV show?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s one of the things that really captivated</p>
<p>the public imagination about chess.</p>
<p>People who don&rsquo;t play chess became very curious</p>
<p>about the game, about the beauty of the game,</p>
<p>the drama of the game, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Is there, in terms of accuracy,</p>
<p>in terms of the actual games played,</p>
<p>that you found impressive?</p>
<p>First of all, they did the chess well,</p>
<p>they did it accurately.</p>
<p>And also, they found actual games and positions</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d never seen before.</p>
<p>And it really captivated me.</p>
<p>Like, I would not follow the story at times.</p>
<p>I was just trying to, wow,</p>
<p>where the hell did I find that game?</p>
<p>Just trying to solve the positions.</p>
<p>So, Beth Harmon, the main character,</p>
<p>were you impressed by the play she was doing in the,</p>
<p>like, was there a particular style</p>
<p>that they developed consistently?</p>
<p>She was just, at the end, she was just totally universal.</p>
<p>Like, at the start, she was probably a bit too aggressive,</p>
<p>but no, she was absolutely universal.</p>
<p>Wait, what adjective are you using?</p>
<p>Universal in the sense that she could play in any style.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>And was dominant in that way.</p>
<p>So, wow, there was a development in style too</p>
<p>throughout the show.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting they did that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it actually happened with me a bit as well.</p>
<p>Like, I started out really aggressive.</p>
<p>Then I became probably too technical at some point,</p>
<p>taking a little bit too few risks</p>
<p>and not playing dynamic enough.</p>
<p>And then I started to get a little bit better at dynamics</p>
<p>so that now I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>I would say definitely the most universal player</p>
<p>in terms of style.</p>
<p>Are there any skills in chess</p>
<p>that are transferable to poker?</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;re playing around with poker a little bit now,</p>
<p>how fundamentally different of a game is it?</p>
<p>What I find the most transferable probably is</p>
<p>not letting past decisions dictate future thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But in terms of the patterns in the betting strategies</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, what about bluffing?</p>
<p>I bluff way too much.</p>
<p>It does seem you enjoy bluffing</p>
<p>and Daniel Negrano was saying that you&rsquo;re quite good at it.</p>
<p>But yeah, it has very little material to go by.</p>
<p>Sample size is small.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I enjoy bluffing</p>
<p>for more of the gambling aspects, the thrill of.</p>
<p>So not the technical aspect of the bluffing</p>
<p>like you would on the chessboard?</p>
<p>Not bluffing in the same sense, but there is some element.</p>
<p>But I do enjoy it on the chessboard.</p>
<p>Like if I know that like,</p>
<p>oh, I successfully scared away my opponent</p>
<p>from making the best move, that&rsquo;s of course satisfying.</p>
<p>In that same way, it might be satisfying in poker, right?</p>
<p>That you represent something,</p>
<p>you scare away your opponent in the same kind of way.</p>
<p>And also like you tell a story,</p>
<p>you try and tell a story and then they believe it.</p>
<p>Yeah, tell a story with your betting,</p>
<p>with all the different other cues.</p>
<p>Do you like the money aspect, the betting strategies?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like another layer on top of it, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s the uncertainty in the cards,</p>
<p>but the betting, there&rsquo;s so much freedom to the betting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very good at that.</p>
<p>So I cannot say that I understand it completely.</p>
<p>You know, when it comes to different sizing and all that,</p>
<p>I just haven&rsquo;t studied it enough.</p>
<p>How much of luck is part of poker would you say</p>
<p>from what you&rsquo;ve seen versus skill?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so different in the sense that you can be</p>
<p>one of the best players in the world</p>
<p>and lose two, three years in a row</p>
<p>without that being like a massive outlier.</p>
<p>Okay, the thing that more than one person told me</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re very good at is trash talking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I am.</p>
<p>A lot of people who make those observations about me,</p>
<p>I think they just expect very, very little.</p>
<p>So they expect from the best chess player in the world,</p>
<p>that just anything that&rsquo;s non robotic is interesting.</p>
<p>Also, when it comes to trash talking,</p>
<p>like I have the biggest advantage in the world</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m the best at what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>So trash talking becomes very, very, very easy</p>
<p>because I can back it up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but a lot of people that are extremely good at stuff</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t trash talk and they&rsquo;re not good at it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m very good at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that I can back it up,</p>
<p>which makes it seem that I&rsquo;m better.</p>
<p>And also.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re even doing it now.</p>
<p>Also being non robotic or not completely robotic helps.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trash talking, you&rsquo;re just stating facts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered that there will be trash talking</p>
<p>and over the chess board and some of the big tournaments,</p>
<p>like adding that kind of component or even talking,</p>
<p>you know, would that completely distract</p>
<p>from the game of chess?</p>
<p>No, I think it could be fun in,</p>
<p>when people play off fan games,</p>
<p>when they play Blitz games,</p>
<p>like people trash talk all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a normal part of the game.</p>
<p>So you emphasize fun a lot.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re living inside of a simulation</p>
<p>that is trying to maximize fun?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only happened for the last 100 years or so.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s like the.</p>
<p>Fun has always been increasing, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been increasing,</p>
<p>but I feel like it&rsquo;s been increasing exponentially.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, or at least the importance of fun.</p>
<p>But I guess it depends on the society as well.</p>
<p>Like in the West, we&rsquo;ve had such a Christian influence.</p>
<p>And I mean, Christianity hasn&rsquo;t exactly embraced</p>
<p>the concept of fun over time.</p>
<p>Well, actually to push back,</p>
<p>I think forbidding certain things</p>
<p>kind of makes them more fun.</p>
<p>So sometimes I think you need to say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not allowed to do this.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people start doing it</p>
<p>and then they have fun doing that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s doing a thing</p>
<p>in the face of the resistance of the thing.</p>
<p>So whenever there&rsquo;s resistance,</p>
<p>that does somehow make it more fun.</p>
<p>Oppressive regimes has always kind of been</p>
<p>kind of good for comedy, no?</p>
<p>Like, no, but I heard.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Supposedly like in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about fun,</p>
<p>but supposedly comedy, like at least underground,</p>
<p>it thrived.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a, well, no, it permeates the entire culture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dark humor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That sort of the cruelty, the absurdity of life</p>
<p>really brings out the humor amongst the populace</p>
<p>plus vodka on top of that.</p>
<p>But this idea that, for example, Elon Musk has that</p>
<p>the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.</p>
<p>That it seems like the most absurd, silly, funny thing</p>
<p>seems to be the thing that.</p>
<p>So it happens more often than it should.</p>
<p>And it somehow becomes viral in our modern connected world.</p>
<p>And so the fun stuff, the memes spread,</p>
<p>and then we start to optimize for the fun meme</p>
<p>that seems to be a fundamental property</p>
<p>of the reality we live in.</p>
<p>And so emerges the fun maximizer in all walks of life,</p>
<p>like in chess, in poker, in everything.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not skeptical.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not skeptical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m just taking it all in.</p>
<p>But I find it interesting and not at all impossible.</p>
<p>Do you ever get lonely?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Like a chess player&rsquo;s life is by definition pretty lonely</p>
<p>because you have nobody else to blame but yourself</p>
<p>when you lose or you don&rsquo;t achieve the results</p>
<p>that you want to achieve.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult for you to find comfort elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in your own mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you versus yourself, really.</p>
<p>Yeah, really.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s part of the profession.</p>
<p>But I think any like sport or activity</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just you and your own mind</p>
<p>is just by definition lonely.</p>
<p>Are you worried that it destroys you?</p>
<p>Oh, not at all.</p>
<p>As long as I&rsquo;m aware of it, then it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think the inherent loneliness</p>
<p>of my profession really affects the rest of my life</p>
<p>in a major way.</p>
<p>What role does love play in the human condition</p>
<p>and in your lonely life of calculation?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I&rsquo;m like everybody else trying, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Trying to find love?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily like trying to find love.</p>
<p>Sometimes I am, sometimes I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to find my way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And my love for the game,</p>
<p>obviously it comes and goes a little bit,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s always at least some level of love.</p>
<p>So that doesn&rsquo;t go away.</p>
<p>But I think in other parts of life,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just about doing things that make you happy,</p>
<p>that give you joy,</p>
<p>that also makes you more receptive to love in general.</p>
<p>So that has been my approach to love now</p>
<p>for quite a while that I&rsquo;m just trying to live my best life</p>
<p>and then the love will come when it comes</p>
<p>and in terms of romantic love,</p>
<p>it has come and gone in my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not there now, but I&rsquo;m not worried about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more worried about, you know, not worried,</p>
<p>but more like trying to just be a good version of myself.</p>
<p>I cannot always be the best version of myself,</p>
<p>but at least try to be good.</p>
<p>Yeah, and keep your heart open.</p>
<p>What is this Daniel Johnson song?</p>
<p>True love will find you in the end.</p>
<p>No, it may or may not.</p>
<p>But it will only find you if,</p>
<p>oh fuck, how does it go?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking, so like you have to be open to it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It may or may not.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And no matter what, you&rsquo;re gonna lose it in the end</p>
<p>because it all ends, the whole thing ends.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think stressing over that,</p>
<p>like obviously it&rsquo;s so human</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t help it to some degree,</p>
<p>but I feel like stressing over love,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the blueprint for whether you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not looking or you&rsquo;re in a relationship</p>
<p>or married or anything,</p>
<p>like stressing over it is like the blueprint</p>
<p>for being unhappy.</p>
<p>Just to clarify confusion I have,</p>
<p>just a quick question.</p>
<p>How does the knight move?</p>
<p>Ha, so the knight moves in an L</p>
<p>and unlike in shogi it can move both forwards and backwards.</p>
<p>It is quite a nimble piece.</p>
<p>It can jump over everything,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s less happy in open position</p>
<p>where it has to move from side to side quickly.</p>
<p>I am generally more of a bishops guy myself</p>
<p>for the old debate.</p>
<p>I just prefer quality over the intangibles,</p>
<p>but I can appreciate a good knight once in a while.</p>
<p>Last simple question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life, Magnus Carlsen?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously no meaning to life.</p>
<p>Is that obvious?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re here by accident.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no meaning, it ends at some point,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still a great thing.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can still have fun even if there&rsquo;s no meaning.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can still have fun.</p>
<p>You can try and pursue your goals, whatever they may be,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s no special meaning</p>
<p>and trying to find it also doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>a whole lot of sense to me.</p>
<p>For me, life is both meaningless and meaningful</p>
<p>for just being here, trying to make,</p>
<p>not necessarily the most of it,</p>
<p>but the things that make you happy</p>
<p>both short term and also long term.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems to be full of cool stuff to enjoy.</p>
<p>It certainly does.</p>
<p>And one of those is having a conversation with you.</p>
<p>Magnus, it&rsquo;s a huge honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for spending this time with me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do in this world</p>
<p>and thank you for creating so much elegance and beauty</p>
<p>on the chessboard and beyond.</p>
<p>So thanks for talking today, brother.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>And I wanted to say this at the start,</p>
<p>but I never really got the chance.</p>
<p>I was always a bit apprehensive about doing this podcast</p>
<p>because you are a very smart guy</p>
<p>and your audience is very smart</p>
<p>and I always had a bit of imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you this now after the podcast.</p>
<p>So please do judge me, but I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a brilliant man.</p>
<p>And I love the fact that you have imposter syndrome</p>
<p>because a lot of us do.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s beautiful to see even at the very top,</p>
<p>but you still feel like an imposter.</p>
<p>Thank you, brother.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking today.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Magnus Carlsen.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Bobby Fischer.</p>
<p>Chess is a war over the board.</p>
<p>The object is to crush the opponent&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
