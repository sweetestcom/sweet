    <p>The following is a conversation with Andrew Ng,</p>
<p>one of the most impactful educators, researchers, innovators, and leaders</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence and technology space in general.</p>
<p>He cofounded Coursera and Google Brain,</p>
<p>launched Deep Learning AI, Landing AI, and the AI Fund,</p>
<p>and was the chief scientist at Baidu.</p>
<p>As a Stanford professor and with Coursera and Deep Learning AI,</p>
<p>he has helped educate and inspire millions of students, including me.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.</p>
<p>Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>a subsidiary of Square, a member SIPC.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>let me mention that cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money is fascinating.</p>
<p>I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.</p>
<p>Debits and credits on ledgers started over 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The US dollar was created over 200 years ago,</p>
<p>and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, released just over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use the code LEXPODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>one of my favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education</p>
<p>for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Andrew Ng.</p>
<p>The courses you taught on machine learning at Stanford</p>
<p>and later on Coursera that you cofounded have educated and inspired millions of people.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, what people or ideas inspired you</p>
<p>to get into computer science and machine learning when you were young?</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love with the field, is another way to put it.</p>
<p>Growing up in Hong Kong and Singapore, I started learning to code when I was five or six years old.</p>
<p>At that time, I was learning the basic programming language,</p>
<p>and they would take these books and they&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>type this program into your computer, so type that program to my computer.</p>
<p>And as a result of all that typing, I would get to play these very simple shoot them up games</p>
<p>that I had implemented on my little computer.</p>
<p>So I thought it was fascinating as a young kid that I could write this code.</p>
<p>I was really just copying code from a book into my computer</p>
<p>to then play these cool little video games.</p>
<p>Another moment for me was when I was a teenager and my father,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a doctor, was reading about expert systems and about neural networks.</p>
<p>So he got me to read some of these books, and I thought it was really cool.</p>
<p>You could write a computer that started to exhibit intelligence.</p>
<p>Then I remember doing an internship while I was in high school, this was in Singapore,</p>
<p>where I remember doing a lot of photocopying and as an office assistant.</p>
<p>And the highlight of my job was when I got to use the shredder.</p>
<p>So the teenager me, remote thinking, boy, this is a lot of photocopying.</p>
<p>If only we could write software, build a robot, something to automate this,</p>
<p>maybe I could do something else.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of my work since then has centered on the theme of automation.</p>
<p>Even the way I think about machine learning today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very good at writing learning algorithms that can automate things that people can do.</p>
<p>Or even launching the first MOOCs, Mass Open Online Courses, that later led to Coursera.</p>
<p>I was trying to automate what could be automatable in how I was teaching on campus.</p>
<p>Process of education, trying to automate parts of that to make it more,</p>
<p>sort of to have more impact from a single teacher, a single educator.</p>
<p>Yeah, I felt, you know, teaching at Stanford,</p>
<p>teaching machine learning to about 400 students a year at the time.</p>
<p>And I found myself filming the exact same video every year,</p>
<p>telling the same jokes in the same room.</p>
<p>And I thought, why am I doing this?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just take last year&rsquo;s video?</p>
<p>And then I can spend my time building a deeper relationship with students.</p>
<p>So that process of thinking through how to do that,</p>
<p>that led to the first MOOCs that we launched.</p>
<p>And then you have more time to write new jokes.</p>
<p>Are there favorite memories from your early days at Stanford,</p>
<p>teaching thousands of people in person and then millions of people online?</p>
<p>You know, teaching online, what not many people know was that a lot of those videos</p>
<p>were shot between the hours of 10 p.m. and 3 a.m.</p>
<p>A lot of times, we were launching the first MOOCs at Stanford.</p>
<p>We had already announced the course, about 100,000 people signed up.</p>
<p>We just started to write the code and we had not yet actually filmed the videos.</p>
<p>So a lot of pressure, 100,000 people waiting for us to produce the content.</p>
<p>So many Fridays, Saturdays, I would go out, have dinner with my friends,</p>
<p>and then I would think, OK, do you want to go home now?</p>
<p>Or do you want to go to the office to film videos?</p>
<p>And the thought of being able to help 100,000 people potentially learn machine learning,</p>
<p>fortunately, that made me think, OK, I want to go to my office,</p>
<p>go to my tiny little recording studio.</p>
<p>I would adjust my Logitech webcam, adjust my Wacom tablet,</p>
<p>make sure my lapel mic was on,</p>
<p>and then I would start recording often until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.</p>
<p>I think unfortunately, that doesn&rsquo;t show that it was recorded that late at night,</p>
<p>but it was really inspiring the thought that we could create content</p>
<p>to help so many people learn about machine learning.</p>
<p>How did that feel?</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;re probably somewhat alone,</p>
<p>maybe a couple of friends recording with a Logitech webcam</p>
<p>and kind of going home alone at 1 or 2 a.m. at night</p>
<p>and knowing that that&rsquo;s going to reach sort of thousands of people,</p>
<p>eventually millions of people, what&rsquo;s that feeling like?</p>
<p>I mean, is there a feeling of just satisfaction of pushing through?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s humbling.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about what I was feeling.</p>
<p>I think one thing that I&rsquo;m proud to say we got right from the early days</p>
<p>was I told my whole team back then that the number one priority</p>
<p>is to do what&rsquo;s best for learners, do what&rsquo;s best for students.</p>
<p>And so when I went to the recording studio,</p>
<p>the only thing on my mind was what can I say?</p>
<p>How can I design my slides?</p>
<p>What I need to draw right to make these concepts as clear as possible for learners?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve seen sometimes instructors is tempting to,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s talk about my work.</p>
<p>Maybe if I teach you about my research,</p>
<p>someone will cite my papers a couple more times.</p>
<p>And I think one of the things we got right,</p>
<p>launching the first few MOOCs and later building Coursera,</p>
<p>was putting in place that bedrock principle of</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just do what&rsquo;s best for learners and forget about everything else.</p>
<p>And I think that that is a guiding principle</p>
<p>turned out to be really important to the rise of the MOOC movement.</p>
<p>And the kind of learner you imagined in your mind</p>
<p>is as broad as possible, as global as possible.</p>
<p>So really try to reach as many people</p>
<p>interested in machine learning and AI as possible.</p>
<p>I really want to help anyone that had an interest in machine learning</p>
<p>to break into the field.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes I&rsquo;ve actually had people ask me,</p>
<p>hey, why are you spending so much time explaining gradient descent?</p>
<p>And my answer was, if I look at what I think the learner needs</p>
<p>and what benefit from, I felt that having that</p>
<p>a good understanding of the foundations coming back to the basics</p>
<p>would put them in a better stead to then build on a long term career.</p>
<p>So try to consistently make decisions on that principle.</p>
<p>So one of the things you actually revealed to the narrow AI community</p>
<p>at the time and to the world is that the amount of people</p>
<p>who are actually interested in AI is much larger than we imagined.</p>
<p>By you teaching the class and how popular it became,</p>
<p>it showed that, wow, this isn&rsquo;t just a small community</p>
<p>of sort of people who go to NeurIPS and it&rsquo;s much bigger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s developers, it&rsquo;s people from all over the world.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m Russian, so everybody in Russia is really interested.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge number of programmers who are interested in machine learning,</p>
<p>India, China, South America, everywhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just millions of people who are interested in machine learning.</p>
<p>So how big do you get a sense that the number of people</p>
<p>is that are interested from your perspective?</p>
<p>I think the number has grown over time.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s one of those things that maybe it feels like it came out of nowhere,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an insight that building it, it took years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those overnight successes that took years to get there.</p>
<p>My first foray into this type of online education</p>
<p>was when we were filming my Stanford class</p>
<p>and sticking the videos on YouTube and some other things.</p>
<p>We had uploaded the horrors and so on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically the one hour, 15 minute video that we put on YouTube.</p>
<p>And then we had four or five other versions of websites that I had built,</p>
<p>most of which you would never have heard of</p>
<p>because they reached small audiences,</p>
<p>but that allowed me to iterate,</p>
<p>allowed my team and me to iterate,</p>
<p>to learn what are the ideas that work and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For example, one of the features I was really excited about</p>
<p>and really proud of was build this website</p>
<p>where multiple people could be logged into the website at the same time.</p>
<p>So today, if you go to a website,</p>
<p>if you are logged in and then I want to log in,</p>
<p>you need to log out because it&rsquo;s the same browser, the same computer.</p>
<p>But I thought, well, what if two people say you and me</p>
<p>were watching a video together in front of a computer?</p>
<p>What if a website could have you type your name and password,</p>
<p>have me type my name and password,</p>
<p>and then now the computer knows both of us are watching together</p>
<p>and it gives both of us credit for anything we do as a group.</p>
<p>Influencers feature rolled it out in a high school in San Francisco.</p>
<p>We had about 20 something users.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the teacher there?</p>
<p>Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep, the teacher is great.</p>
<p>I mean, guess what?</p>
<p>Zero people use this feature.</p>
<p>It turns out people studying online,</p>
<p>they want to watch the videos by themselves.</p>
<p>So you can play back, pause at your own speed rather than in groups.</p>
<p>So that was one example of a tiny lesson learned out of many</p>
<p>that allowed us to hone into the set of features.</p>
<p>It sounds like a brilliant feature.</p>
<p>So I guess the lesson to take from that is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that looks amazing on paper and then nobody uses it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually have the impact that you think it might have.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I saw that you really went through a lot of different features</p>
<p>and a lot of ideas to arrive at Coursera,</p>
<p>the final kind of powerful thing that showed the world</p>
<p>that MOOCs can educate millions.</p>
<p>And I think with the whole machine learning movement as well,</p>
<p>I think it didn&rsquo;t come out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Instead, what happened was as more people learn about machine learning,</p>
<p>they will tell their friends and their friends will see</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s applicable to their work.</p>
<p>And then the community kept on growing.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re still growing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know in the future what percentage of all developers</p>
<p>will be AI developers.</p>
<p>I could easily see it being north of 50%, right?</p>
<p>Because so many AI developers broadly construed,</p>
<p>not just people doing the machine learning modeling,</p>
<p>but the people building infrastructure, data pipelines,</p>
<p>all the software surrounding the core machine learning model</p>
<p>maybe is even bigger.</p>
<p>I feel like today almost every software engineer</p>
<p>has some understanding of the cloud.</p>
<p>Not all, but maybe this is my microcontroller developer</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t need to deal with the cloud.</p>
<p>But I feel like the vast majority of software engineers today</p>
<p>are sort of having an appreciation of the cloud.</p>
<p>I think in the future, maybe we&rsquo;ll approach nearly 100% of all developers</p>
<p>being in some way an AI developer</p>
<p>or at least having an appreciation of machine learning.</p>
<p>And my hope is that there&rsquo;s this kind of effect</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s people who are not really interested in being a programmer</p>
<p>or being into software engineering, like biologists, chemists,</p>
<p>and physicists, even mechanical engineers,</p>
<p>all these disciplines that are now more and more sitting on large data sets.</p>
<p>And here they didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re interested in programming</p>
<p>until they have this data set and they realize</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this set of machine learning tools</p>
<p>that allow you to use the data set.</p>
<p>So they actually become, they learn to program</p>
<p>and they become new programmers.</p>
<p>So like the, not just because you&rsquo;ve mentioned</p>
<p>a larger percentage of developers become machine learning people.</p>
<p>So it seems like more and more the kinds of people</p>
<p>who are becoming developers is also growing significantly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think once upon a time,</p>
<p>only a small part of humanity was literate, could read and write.</p>
<p>And maybe you thought, maybe not everyone needs to learn to read and write.</p>
<p>You just go listen to a few monks read to you and maybe that was enough.</p>
<p>Or maybe you just need a few handful of authors to write the bestsellers</p>
<p>and no one else needs to write.</p>
<p>But what we found was that by giving as many people,</p>
<p>in some countries, almost everyone, basic literacy,</p>
<p>it dramatically enhanced human to human communications.</p>
<p>And we can now write for an audience of one,</p>
<p>such as if I send you an email or you send me an email.</p>
<p>I think in computing, we&rsquo;re still in that phase</p>
<p>where so few people know how to code</p>
<p>that the coders mostly have to code for relatively large audiences.</p>
<p>But if everyone, or most people became developers at some level,</p>
<p>similar to how most people in developed economies are somewhat literate,</p>
<p>I would love to see the owners of a mom and pop store</p>
<p>be able to write a little bit of code to customize the TV display</p>
<p>for their special this week.</p>
<p>And I think it will enhance human to computer communications,</p>
<p>which is becoming more and more important today as well.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s possible that machine learning</p>
<p>becomes kind of similar to literacy,</p>
<p>where like you said, the owners of a mom and pop shop,</p>
<p>is basically everybody in all walks of life</p>
<p>would have some degree of programming capability?</p>
<p>I could see society getting there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other interesting thing.</p>
<p>If I go talk to the mom and pop store,</p>
<p>if I talk to a lot of people in their daily professions,</p>
<p>I previously didn&rsquo;t have a good story for why they should learn to code.</p>
<p>We could give them some reasons.</p>
<p>But what I found with the rise of machine learning and data science is that</p>
<p>I think the number of people with a concrete use for data science</p>
<p>in their daily lives, in their jobs,</p>
<p>may be even larger than the number of people</p>
<p>who have concrete use for software engineering.</p>
<p>For example, if you run a small mom and pop store,</p>
<p>I think if you can analyze the data about your sales, your customers,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s actually real value there,</p>
<p>maybe even more than traditional software engineering.</p>
<p>So I find that for a lot of my friends in various professions,</p>
<p>be it recruiters or accountants or people that work in the factories,</p>
<p>which I deal with more and more these days,</p>
<p>I feel if they were data scientists at some level,</p>
<p>they could immediately use that in their work.</p>
<p>So I think that data science and machine learning</p>
<p>may be an even easier entree into the developer world</p>
<p>for a lot of people than the software engineering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And I agree with that, but that&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>But we live in a world where most courses and talks have slides,</p>
<p>PowerPoint, keynote,</p>
<p>and yet you famously often still use a marker and a whiteboard.</p>
<p>The simplicity of that is compelling,</p>
<p>and for me at least, fun to watch.</p>
<p>So let me ask, why do you like using a marker and whiteboard,</p>
<p>even on the biggest of stages?</p>
<p>I think it depends on the concepts you want to explain.</p>
<p>For mathematical concepts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice to build up the equation one piece at a time,</p>
<p>and the whiteboard marker or the pen and stylus</p>
<p>is a very easy way to build up the equation,</p>
<p>to build up a complex concept one piece at a time</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re talking about it,</p>
<p>and sometimes that enhances understandability.</p>
<p>The downside of writing is that it&rsquo;s slow,</p>
<p>and so if you want a long sentence, it&rsquo;s very hard to write that.</p>
<p>So I think there are pros and cons,</p>
<p>and sometimes I use slides,</p>
<p>and sometimes I use a whiteboard or a stylus.</p>
<p>The slowness of a whiteboard is also its upside,</p>
<p>because it forces you to reduce everything to the basics.</p>
<p>Some of your talks involve the whiteboard.</p>
<p>I mean, you go very slowly,</p>
<p>and you really focus on the most simple principles,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a beautiful,</p>
<p>that enforces a kind of a minimalism of ideas</p>
<p>that I think is surprising at least for me is great for education.</p>
<p>Like a great talk, I think, is not one that has a lot of content.</p>
<p>A great talk is one that just clearly says a few simple ideas,</p>
<p>and I think the whiteboard somehow enforces that.</p>
<p>Peter Abbeel, who&rsquo;s now one of the top roboticists</p>
<p>and reinforcement learning experts in the world,</p>
<p>was your first PhD student.</p>
<p>So I bring him up just because I kind of imagine</p>
<p>this must have been an interesting time in your life,</p>
<p>and do you have any favorite memories of working with Peter,</p>
<p>since you were your first student in those uncertain times,</p>
<p>especially before deep learning really sort of blew up?</p>
<p>Any favorite memories from those times?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was really fortunate to have had Peter Abbeel</p>
<p>as my first PhD student,</p>
<p>and I think even my long term professional success</p>
<p>builds on early foundations or early work</p>
<p>that Peter was so critical to.</p>
<p>So I was really grateful to him for working with me.</p>
<p>What not a lot of people know is just how hard research was,</p>
<p>and still is.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s PhD thesis was using reinforcement learning</p>
<p>to fly helicopters.</p>
<p>And so, even today, the website heli.stanford.edu,</p>
<p>heli.stanford.edu is still up.</p>
<p>You can watch videos of us using reinforcement learning</p>
<p>to make a helicopter fly upside down,</p>
<p>fly loose roses, so it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most incredible robotics videos ever,</p>
<p>so people should watch it.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inspiring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from like 2008 or seven or six, like that range.</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it was over 10 years old.</p>
<p>That was really inspiring to a lot of people, yeah.</p>
<p>What not many people see is how hard it was.</p>
<p>So Peter and Adam Coase and Morgan Quigley and I</p>
<p>were working on various versions of the helicopter,</p>
<p>and a lot of things did not work.</p>
<p>For example, it turns out one of the hardest problems we had</p>
<p>was when the helicopter&rsquo;s flying around upside down,</p>
<p>doing stunts, how do you figure out the position?</p>
<p>How do you localize the helicopter?</p>
<p>So we wanted to try all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Having one GPS unit doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re flying upside down,</p>
<p>the GPS unit&rsquo;s facing down, so you can&rsquo;t see the satellites.</p>
<p>So we experimented trying to have two GPS units,</p>
<p>one facing up, one facing down.</p>
<p>So if you flip over, that didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>because the downward facing one couldn&rsquo;t synchronize</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re flipping quickly.</p>
<p>Morgan Quigley was exploring this crazy,</p>
<p>complicated configuration of specialized hardware</p>
<p>to interpret GPS signals.</p>
<p>Looking at the FPG is completely insane.</p>
<p>Spent about a year working on that, didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So I remember Peter, great guy, him and me,</p>
<p>sitting down in my office looking at some of the latest things</p>
<p>we had tried that didn&rsquo;t work and saying,</p>
<p>done it, what now?</p>
<p>Because we tried so many things and it just didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>In the end, what we did, and Adam Coles was crucial to this,</p>
<p>was put cameras on the ground and use cameras on the ground</p>
<p>to localize the helicopter.</p>
<p>And that solved the localization problem</p>
<p>so that we could then focus on the reinforcement learning</p>
<p>and inverse reinforcement learning techniques</p>
<p>so it didn&rsquo;t actually make the helicopter fly.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m reminded, when I was doing this work at Stanford,</p>
<p>around that time, there was a lot of reinforcement learning</p>
<p>theoretical papers, but not a lot of practical applications.</p>
<p>So the autonomous helicopter work for flying helicopters</p>
<p>was one of the few practical applications</p>
<p>of reinforcement learning at the time,</p>
<p>which caused it to become pretty well known.</p>
<p>I feel like we might have almost come full circle with today.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much buzz, so much hype, so much excitement</p>
<p>about reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>But again, we&rsquo;re hunting for more applications</p>
<p>of all of these great ideas that David Kuhnke has come up with.</p>
<p>What was the drive sort of in the face of the fact</p>
<p>that most people are doing theoretical work?</p>
<p>What motivates you in the uncertainty and the challenges</p>
<p>to get the helicopter sort of to do the applied work,</p>
<p>to get the actual system to work?</p>
<p>Yeah, in the face of fear, uncertainty, sort of the setbacks</p>
<p>that you mentioned for localization.</p>
<p>I like stuff that works.</p>
<p>In the physical world.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s back to the shredder.</p>
<p>You know, I like theory, but when I work on theory myself,</p>
<p>and this is personal taste,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying anyone else should do what I do.</p>
<p>But when I work on theory, I personally enjoy it more</p>
<p>if I feel that the work I do will influence people,</p>
<p>have positive impact, or help someone.</p>
<p>I remember when many years ago,</p>
<p>I was speaking with a mathematics professor,</p>
<p>and it kind of just said, hey, why do you do what you do?</p>
<p>It kind of just said, hey, why do you do what you do?</p>
<p>And then he said, he had stars in his eyes when he answered.</p>
<p>And this mathematician, not from Stanford,</p>
<p>different university, he said, I do what I do</p>
<p>because it helps me to discover truth and beauty</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>He had stars in his eyes when he said that.</p>
<p>And I thought, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great that someone does that,</p>
<p>fully support the people that do it,</p>
<p>a lot of respect for people that do that.</p>
<p>But I am more motivated when I can see a line</p>
<p>to how the work that my teams and I are doing helps people.</p>
<p>The world needs all sorts of people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just one type.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think everyone should do things</p>
<p>the same way as I do.</p>
<p>But when I delve into either theory or practice,</p>
<p>if I personally have conviction that here&rsquo;s a pathway</p>
<p>to help people, I find that more satisfying</p>
<p>to have that conviction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your path.</p>
<p>You were a proponent of deep learning</p>
<p>before it gained widespread acceptance.</p>
<p>What did you see in this field that gave you confidence?</p>
<p>What was your thinking process like in that first decade</p>
<p>of the, I don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s called, 2000s, the aughts?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can tell you the thing we got wrong</p>
<p>and the thing we got right.</p>
<p>The thing we really got wrong was the importance of,</p>
<p>the early importance of unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>So early days of Google Brain,</p>
<p>we put a lot of effort into unsupervised learning</p>
<p>rather than supervised learning.</p>
<p>And there was this argument,</p>
<p>I think it was around 2005 after NeurIPS,</p>
<p>at that time called NIPS, but now NeurIPS had ended.</p>
<p>And Jeff Hinton and I were sitting in the cafeteria</p>
<p>outside the conference.</p>
<p>We had lunch, we were just chatting.</p>
<p>And Jeff pulled up this napkin.</p>
<p>He started sketching this argument on a napkin.</p>
<p>It was very compelling, as I&rsquo;ll repeat it.</p>
<p>Human brain has about a hundred trillion.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s 10 to the 14 synaptic connections.</p>
<p>You will live for about 10 to the nine seconds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 30 years.</p>
<p>You actually live for two by 10 to the nine,</p>
<p>maybe three by 10 to the nine seconds.</p>
<p>So just let&rsquo;s say 10 to the nine.</p>
<p>So if each synaptic connection,</p>
<p>each weight in your brain&rsquo;s neural network</p>
<p>has just a one bit parameter,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 10 to the 14 bits you need to learn</p>
<p>in up to 10 to the nine seconds.</p>
<p>10 to the nine seconds of your life.</p>
<p>So via this simple argument,</p>
<p>which is a lot of problems, it&rsquo;s very simplified.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 10 to the five bits per second</p>
<p>you need to learn in your life.</p>
<p>And I have a one year old daughter.</p>
<p>I am not pointing out 10 to five bits per second</p>
<p>of labels to her.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m a very loving parent,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just not gonna do that.</p>
<p>So from this very crude, definitely problematic argument,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no way that most of what we know</p>
<p>is through supervised learning.</p>
<p>But where you get so many bits of information</p>
<p>is from sucking in images, audio,</p>
<p>those experiences in the world.</p>
<p>And so that argument,</p>
<p>and there are a lot of known forces argument</p>
<p>you should go into,</p>
<p>really convinced me that there&rsquo;s a lot of power</p>
<p>to unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>So that was the part that we actually maybe got wrong.</p>
<p>I still think unsupervised learning is really important,</p>
<p>but in the early days, 10, 15 years ago,</p>
<p>a lot of us thought that was the path forward.</p>
<p>Oh, so you&rsquo;re saying that that perhaps</p>
<p>was the wrong intuition for the time.</p>
<p>For the time, that was the part we got wrong.</p>
<p>The part we got right was the importance of scale.</p>
<p>So Adam Coates, another wonderful person,</p>
<p>fortunate to have worked with him,</p>
<p>he was in my group at Stanford at the time</p>
<p>and Adam had run these experiments at Stanford</p>
<p>showing that the bigger we train a learning algorithm,</p>
<p>the better its performance.</p>
<p>And it was based on that.</p>
<p>There was a graph that Adam generated</p>
<p>where the X axis, Y axis lines going up into the right.</p>
<p>So the bigger you make this thing,</p>
<p>the better its performance accuracy is the vertical axis.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really based on that chart that Adam generated</p>
<p>that he gave me the conviction</p>
<p>that you could scale these models way bigger</p>
<p>than what we could on a few CPUs,</p>
<p>which is where we had at Stanford</p>
<p>that we could get even better results.</p>
<p>And it was really based on that one figure</p>
<p>that Adam generated</p>
<p>that gave me the conviction to go with Sebastian Thrun</p>
<p>to pitch starting a project at Google,</p>
<p>which became the Google Brain project.</p>
<p>The Brain, you go find a Google Brain.</p>
<p>And there the intuition was scale</p>
<p>will bring performance for the system.</p>
<p>So we should chase a larger and larger scale.</p>
<p>And I think people don&rsquo;t realize how groundbreaking of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple, but it&rsquo;s a groundbreaking idea</p>
<p>that bigger data sets will result in better performance.</p>
<p>It was controversial at the time.</p>
<p>Some of my well meaning friends,</p>
<p>senior people in the machine learning community,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t name, but some of whom we know,</p>
<p>my well meaning friends came</p>
<p>and were trying to give me friendly,</p>
<p>I was like, hey, Andrew, why are you doing this?</p>
<p>This is crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the near natural architecture.</p>
<p>Look at these architectures of building.</p>
<p>You just want to go for scale?</p>
<p>Like this is a bad career move.</p>
<p>So my well meaning friends,</p>
<p>some of them were trying to talk me out of it.</p>
<p>But I find that if you want to make a breakthrough,</p>
<p>you sometimes have to have conviction</p>
<p>and do something before it&rsquo;s popular,</p>
<p>since that lets you have a bigger impact.</p>
<p>Let me ask you just a small tangent on that topic.</p>
<p>I find myself arguing with people saying that greater scale,</p>
<p>especially in the context of active learning,</p>
<p>so very carefully selecting the data set,</p>
<p>but growing the scale of the data set</p>
<p>is going to lead to even further breakthroughs</p>
<p>in deep learning.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s currently pushback at that idea</p>
<p>that larger data sets are no longer,</p>
<p>so you want to increase the efficiency of learning.</p>
<p>You want to make better learning mechanisms.</p>
<p>And I personally believe that bigger data sets will still,</p>
<p>with the same learning methods we have now,</p>
<p>will result in better performance.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition at this time</p>
<p>on this dual side?</p>
<p>Do we need to come up with better architectures for learning</p>
<p>or can we just get bigger, better data sets</p>
<p>that will improve performance?</p>
<p>I think both are important and it&rsquo;s also problem dependent.</p>
<p>So for a few data sets,</p>
<p>we may be approaching a Bayes error rate</p>
<p>or approaching or surpassing human level performance</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s that theoretical ceiling</p>
<p>that we will never surpass,</p>
<p>so Bayes error rate.</p>
<p>But then I think there are plenty of problems</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re still quite far</p>
<p>from either human level performance</p>
<p>or from Bayes error rate</p>
<p>and bigger data sets with neural networks</p>
<p>without further algorithmic innovation</p>
<p>will be sufficient to take us further.</p>
<p>But on the flip side,</p>
<p>if we look at the recent breakthroughs</p>
<p>using transforming networks or language models,</p>
<p>it was a combination of novel architecture</p>
<p>but also scale had a lot to do with it.</p>
<p>If we look at what happened with GP2 and BERTZ,</p>
<p>I think scale was a large part of the story.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s not often talked about</p>
<p>is the scale of the data set it was trained on</p>
<p>and the quality of the data set</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>so it was like reddit threads that had,</p>
<p>they were operated highly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s already some weak supervision</p>
<p>on a very large data set</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t often talk about, right?</p>
<p>I find that today we have maturing processes</p>
<p>to managing code,</p>
<p>things like Git, right?</p>
<p>Version control.</p>
<p>It took us a long time to evolve the good processes.</p>
<p>I remember when my friends and I</p>
<p>were emailing each other C++ files in email,</p>
<p>but then we had,</p>
<p>was it CVS or version Git?</p>
<p>Maybe something else in the future.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very mature in terms of tools for managing data</p>
<p>and think about the clean data</p>
<p>and how to solve down very hot, messy data problems.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of innovation there</p>
<p>to be had still.</p>
<p>I love the idea that you were versioning through email.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one example.</p>
<p>When we work with manufacturing companies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not at all uncommon</p>
<p>for there to be multiple labels</p>
<p>that disagree with each other, right?</p>
<p>And so we would do the work in visual inspection.</p>
<p>We will take, say, a plastic part</p>
<p>and show it to one inspector</p>
<p>and the inspector, sometimes very opinionated,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll go, clearly, that&rsquo;s a defect.</p>
<p>This scratch, unacceptable.</p>
<p>Gotta reject this part.</p>
<p>Take the same part to different inspector,</p>
<p>different, very opinionated.</p>
<p>Clearly, the scratch is small.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t throw it away.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna make us, you know.</p>
<p>And then sometimes you take the same plastic part,</p>
<p>show it to the same inspector</p>
<p>in the afternoon, I suppose, in the morning,</p>
<p>and very opinionated go, in the morning,</p>
<p>they say, clearly, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, equally confident.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is a defect.</p>
<p>And so what is an AI team supposed to do</p>
<p>if sometimes even one person doesn&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>with himself or herself in the span of a day?</p>
<p>So I think these are the types of very practical,</p>
<p>very messy data problems that my teams wrestle with.</p>
<p>In the case of large consumer internet companies</p>
<p>where you have a billion users,</p>
<p>you have a lot of data.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Just take the average.</p>
<p>It kind of works.</p>
<p>But in a case of other industry settings,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have big data.</p>
<p>If just a small data, very small data sets,</p>
<p>maybe around 100 defective parts</p>
<p>or 100 examples of a defect.</p>
<p>If you have only 100 examples,</p>
<p>these little labeling errors,</p>
<p>if 10 of your 100 labels are wrong,</p>
<p>that actually is 10% of your data set has a big impact.</p>
<p>So how do you clean this up?</p>
<p>What are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>This is an example of the types of things</p>
<p>that my teams, this is a landing AI example,</p>
<p>are wrestling with to deal with small data,</p>
<p>which comes up all the time</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re outside consumer internet.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So then you invest more effort and time</p>
<p>in thinking about the actual labeling process.</p>
<p>What are the labels?</p>
<p>What are the how are disagreements resolved</p>
<p>and all those kinds of like pragmatic real world problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating space.</p>
<p>Yeah, I find that actually when I&rsquo;m teaching at Stanford,</p>
<p>I increasingly encourage students at Stanford</p>
<p>to try to find their own project</p>
<p>for the end of term project,</p>
<p>rather than just downloading someone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nicely clean data set.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually much harder if you need to go</p>
<p>and define your own problem and find your own data set,</p>
<p>rather than you go to one of the several good websites,</p>
<p>very good websites with clean scoped data sets</p>
<p>that you could just work on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now running three efforts,</p>
<p>the AI Fund, Landing AI, and deeplearning.ai.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve said, the AI Fund is involved</p>
<p>in creating new companies from scratch.</p>
<p>Landing AI is involved in helping</p>
<p>already established companies do AI</p>
<p>and deeplearning.ai is for education of everyone else</p>
<p>or of individuals interested in getting into the field</p>
<p>and excelling in it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s perhaps talk about each of these areas.</p>
<p>First, deeplearning.ai.</p>
<p>How, the basic question,</p>
<p>how does a person interested in deep learning</p>
<p>get started in the field?</p>
<p>Deep learning.ai is working to create courses</p>
<p>to help people break into AI.</p>
<p>So my machine learning course that I taught through Stanford</p>
<p>is one of the most popular courses on Coursera.</p>
<p>To this day, it&rsquo;s probably one of the courses,</p>
<p>sort of, if I asked somebody,</p>
<p>how did you get into machine learning</p>
<p>or how did you fall in love with machine learning</p>
<p>or would get you interested,</p>
<p>it always goes back to Andrew Ng at some point.</p>
<p>I see, yeah, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve influenced, the amount of people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve influenced is ridiculous.</p>
<p>So for that, I&rsquo;m sure I speak for a lot of people</p>
<p>say big thank you.</p>
<p>No, yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>I was once reading a news article,</p>
<p>I think it was tech review</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna mess up the statistic,</p>
<p>but I remember reading an article that said</p>
<p>something like one third of all programmers are self taught.</p>
<p>I may have the number one third,</p>
<p>around me was two thirds,</p>
<p>but when I read that article,</p>
<p>I thought this doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Everyone is self taught.</p>
<p>So, cause you teach yourself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t teach people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well put.</p>
<p>Yeah, so how does one get started in deep learning</p>
<p>and where does deeplearning.ai fit into that?</p>
<p>So the deep learning specialization offered by deeplearning.ai</p>
<p>is I think it was Coursera&rsquo;s top specialization.</p>
<p>It might still be.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very popular way for people</p>
<p>to take that specialization</p>
<p>to learn about everything from neural networks</p>
<p>to how to tune in your network</p>
<p>to what is a ConvNet to what is a RNN</p>
<p>or a sequence model or what is an attention model.</p>
<p>And so the deep learning specialization</p>
<p>steps everyone through those algorithms</p>
<p>so you deeply understand it</p>
<p>and can implement it and use it for whatever application.</p>
<p>From the very beginning.</p>
<p>So what would you say are the prerequisites</p>
<p>for somebody to take the deep learning specialization</p>
<p>in terms of maybe math or programming background?</p>
<p>Yeah, need to understand basic programming</p>
<p>since there are programming exercises in Python</p>
<p>and the math prereq is quite basic.</p>
<p>So no calculus is needed.</p>
<p>If you know calculus is great, you get better intuitions</p>
<p>but deliberately try to teach that specialization</p>
<p>without requiring calculus.</p>
<p>So I think high school math would be sufficient.</p>
<p>If you know how to multiply two matrices,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So a little basic linear algebra is great.</p>
<p>Basic linear algebra,</p>
<p>even very, very basic linear algebra in some programming.</p>
<p>I think that people that have done the machine learning course</p>
<p>will find a deep learning specialization a bit easier</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also possible to jump</p>
<p>into the deep learning specialization directly</p>
<p>but it will be a little bit harder</p>
<p>since we tend to go over faster concepts</p>
<p>like how does gradient descent work</p>
<p>and what is the objective function</p>
<p>which is covered more slowly in the machine learning course.</p>
<p>Could you briefly mention some of the key concepts</p>
<p>in deep learning that students should learn</p>
<p>that you envision them learning in the first few months</p>
<p>in the first year or so?</p>
<p>So if you take the deep learning specialization,</p>
<p>you learn the foundations of what is a neural network.</p>
<p>How do you build up a neural network</p>
<p>from a single logistic unit to a stack of layers</p>
<p>to different activation functions.</p>
<p>You learn how to train the neural networks.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m very proud of in that specialization</p>
<p>is we go through a lot of practical knowhow</p>
<p>of how to actually make these things work.</p>
<p>So what are the differences between different optimization algorithms?</p>
<p>What do you do if the algorithm overfits</p>
<p>or how do you tell if the algorithm is overfitting?</p>
<p>When do you collect more data?</p>
<p>When should you not bother to collect more data?</p>
<p>I find that even today, unfortunately,</p>
<p>there are engineers that will spend six months</p>
<p>trying to pursue a particular direction</p>
<p>such as collect more data</p>
<p>because we heard more data is valuable</p>
<p>but sometimes you could run some tests</p>
<p>and could have figured out six months earlier</p>
<p>that for this particular problem, collecting more data isn&rsquo;t going to cut it.</p>
<p>So just don&rsquo;t spend six months collecting more data.</p>
<p>Spend your time modifying the architecture or trying something else.</p>
<p>So go through a lot of the practical knowhow</p>
<p>so that when someone, when you take the deep learning specialization,</p>
<p>you have those skills to be very efficient</p>
<p>in how you build these networks.</p>
<p>So dive right in to play with the network, to train it,</p>
<p>to do the inference on a particular data set,</p>
<p>to build intuition about it without building it up too big</p>
<p>to where you spend, like you said, six months</p>
<p>learning, building up your big project</p>
<p>without building any intuition of a small aspect of the data</p>
<p>that could already tell you everything you need to know about that data.</p>
<p>Yes, and also the systematic frameworks of thinking</p>
<p>for how to go about building practical machine learning.</p>
<p>Maybe to make an analogy, when we learn to code,</p>
<p>we have to learn the syntax of some programming language, right?</p>
<p>Be it Python or C++ or Octave or whatever.</p>
<p>But the equally important or maybe even more important part of coding</p>
<p>is to understand how to string together these lines of code</p>
<p>into coherent things.</p>
<p>So when should you put something in a function column?</p>
<p>When should you not?</p>
<p>How do you think about abstraction?</p>
<p>So those frameworks are what makes a programmer efficient</p>
<p>even more than understanding the syntax.</p>
<p>I remember when I was an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon,</p>
<p>one of my friends would debug their code</p>
<p>by first trying to compile it, and then it was C++ code.</p>
<p>And then every line in the syntax error,</p>
<p>they want to get rid of the syntax errors as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>So how do you do that?</p>
<p>Well, they would delete every single line of code with a syntax error.</p>
<p>So really efficient for getting rid of syntax errors</p>
<p>for horrible debugging errors.</p>
<p>So I think we learn how to debug.</p>
<p>And I think in machine learning,</p>
<p>the way you debug a machine learning program</p>
<p>is very different than the way you do binary search or whatever,</p>
<p>or use a debugger, trace through the code</p>
<p>in traditional software engineering.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an evolving discipline,</p>
<p>but I find that the people that are really good</p>
<p>at debugging machine learning algorithms</p>
<p>are easily 10x, maybe 100x faster at getting something to work.</p>
<p>And the basic process of debugging is,</p>
<p>so the bug in this case,</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t this thing learning, improving,</p>
<p>sort of going into the questions of overfitting</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the logical space that the debugging is happening in</p>
<p>with neural networks.</p>
<p>Yeah, often the question is, why doesn&rsquo;t it work yet?</p>
<p>Or can I expect it to eventually work?</p>
<p>And what are the things I could try?</p>
<p>Change the architecture, more data, more regularization,</p>
<p>different optimization algorithm,</p>
<p>different types of data.</p>
<p>So to answer those questions systematically,</p>
<p>so that you don&rsquo;t spend six months hitting down the blind alley</p>
<p>before someone comes and says,</p>
<p>why did you spend six months doing this?</p>
<p>What concepts in deep learning</p>
<p>do you think students struggle the most with?</p>
<p>Or sort of is the biggest challenge for them</p>
<p>was to get over that hill.</p>
<p>It hooks them and it inspires them and they really get it.</p>
<p>Similar to learning mathematics,</p>
<p>I think one of the challenges of deep learning</p>
<p>is that there are a lot of concepts</p>
<p>that build on top of each other.</p>
<p>If you ask me what&rsquo;s hard about mathematics,</p>
<p>I have a hard time pinpointing one thing.</p>
<p>Is it addition, subtraction?</p>
<p>Is it a carry?</p>
<p>Is it multiplication?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>I think one of the challenges of learning math</p>
<p>and of learning certain technical fields</p>
<p>is that there are a lot of concepts</p>
<p>and if you miss a concept,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re kind of missing the prerequisite</p>
<p>for something that comes later.</p>
<p>So in the deep learning specialization,</p>
<p>try to break down the concepts</p>
<p>to maximize the odds of each component being understandable.</p>
<p>So when you move on to the more advanced thing,</p>
<p>we learn confidence,</p>
<p>hopefully you have enough intuitions</p>
<p>from the earlier sections</p>
<p>to then understand why we structure confidence</p>
<p>in a certain way</p>
<p>and then eventually why we built RNNs and LSTMs</p>
<p>or attention models in a certain way</p>
<p>building on top of the earlier concepts.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>you do a lot of teaching as well.</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite,</p>
<p>this is the hard concept moment in your teaching?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s ever turned the interview on me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you get first.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really hard to capture the moment</p>
<p>when they struggle.</p>
<p>I think you put it really eloquently.</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s moments</p>
<p>that are like aha moments</p>
<p>that really inspire people.</p>
<p>I think for some reason,</p>
<p>reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>especially deep reinforcement learning</p>
<p>is a really great way</p>
<p>to really inspire people</p>
<p>and get what the use of neural networks can do.</p>
<p>Even though neural networks</p>
<p>really are just a part of the deep RL framework,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really nice way</p>
<p>to paint the entirety of the picture</p>
<p>of a neural network</p>
<p>being able to learn from scratch,</p>
<p>knowing nothing and explore the world</p>
<p>and pick up lessons.</p>
<p>I find that a lot of the aha moments</p>
<p>happen when you use deep RL</p>
<p>to teach people about neural networks,</p>
<p>which is counterintuitive.</p>
<p>I find like a lot of the inspired sort of fire</p>
<p>in people&rsquo;s passion,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p>it comes from the RL world.</p>
<p>Do you find reinforcement learning</p>
<p>to be a useful part</p>
<p>of the teaching process or no?</p>
<p>I still teach reinforcement learning</p>
<p>in one of my Stanford classes</p>
<p>and my PhD thesis was on reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>So I clearly loved a few.</p>
<p>I find that if I&rsquo;m trying to teach</p>
<p>students the most useful techniques</p>
<p>for them to use today,</p>
<p>I end up shrinking the amount of time</p>
<p>I talk about reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s working today.</p>
<p>Now, our world changes so fast.</p>
<p>Maybe this will be totally different</p>
<p>in a couple of years.</p>
<p>But I think we need a couple more things</p>
<p>for reinforcement learning to get there.</p>
<p>One of my teams is looking</p>
<p>to reinforcement learning</p>
<p>for some robotic control tasks.</p>
<p>So I see the applications,</p>
<p>but if you look at it as a percentage</p>
<p>of all of the impact</p>
<p>of the types of things we do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at least today outside of</p>
<p>playing video games, right?</p>
<p>In a few of the games, the scope.</p>
<p>Actually, at NeurIPS,</p>
<p>a bunch of us were standing around</p>
<p>saying, hey, what&rsquo;s your best example</p>
<p>of an actual deploy reinforcement</p>
<p>learning application?</p>
<p>And among like</p>
<p>senior machine learning researchers, right?</p>
<p>And again, there are some emerging ones,</p>
<p>but there are not that many great examples.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>The sad thing is there hasn&rsquo;t been</p>
<p>a big impactful real world application</p>
<p>of reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>I think its biggest impact to me</p>
<p>has been in the toy domain,</p>
<p>in the game domain,</p>
<p>in the small example.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean for educational purpose.</p>
<p>It seems to be a fun thing to explore</p>
<p>in your networks with.</p>
<p>But I think from your perspective,</p>
<p>and I think that might be</p>
<p>the best perspective is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to educate</p>
<p>with a simple example</p>
<p>in order to illustrate</p>
<p>how this can actually be grown</p>
<p>to scale and have a real world impact,</p>
<p>then perhaps focusing on the fundamentals</p>
<p>of supervised learning</p>
<p>in the context of a simple data set,</p>
<p>even like an MNIST data set</p>
<p>is the right way,</p>
<p>is the right path to take.</p>
<p>The amount of fun I&rsquo;ve seen people</p>
<p>have with reinforcement learning</p>
<p>has been great,</p>
<p>but not in the applied impact</p>
<p>in the real world setting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a trade off,</p>
<p>how much impact you want to have</p>
<p>versus how much fun you want to have.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>And I feel like the world</p>
<p>actually needs all sorts.</p>
<p>Even within machine learning,</p>
<p>I feel like deep learning</p>
<p>is so exciting,</p>
<p>but the AI team</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t just use deep learning.</p>
<p>I find that my teams</p>
<p>use a portfolio of tools.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s not the exciting thing</p>
<p>to say, but some days</p>
<p>we use a neural net,</p>
<p>some days we use a PCA.</p>
<p>Actually, the other day,</p>
<p>I was sitting down with my team</p>
<p>looking at PCA residuals,</p>
<p>trying to figure out what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with PCA applied</p>
<p>to manufacturing problem.</p>
<p>And some days we use</p>
<p>a probabilistic graphical model,</p>
<p>some days we use a knowledge draft,</p>
<p>which is one of the things</p>
<p>that has tremendous industry impact.</p>
<p>But the amount of chatter</p>
<p>about knowledge drafts in academia</p>
<p>is really thin compared</p>
<p>to the actual real world impact.</p>
<p>So I think reinforcement learning</p>
<p>should be in that portfolio.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s about balancing</p>
<p>how much we teach all of these things.</p>
<p>And the world should have</p>
<p>diverse skills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be sad if everyone</p>
<p>just learned one narrow thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, the diverse skill</p>
<p>help you discover the right tool</p>
<p>for the job.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful,</p>
<p>surprising or inspiring idea</p>
<p>in deep learning to you?</p>
<p>Something that captivated</p>
<p>your imagination.</p>
<p>Is it the scale that could be,</p>
<p>the performance that could be</p>
<p>achieved with scale?</p>
<p>Or is there other ideas?</p>
<p>I think that if my only job</p>
<p>was being an academic researcher,</p>
<p>if an unlimited budget</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about short term impact</p>
<p>and only focus on long term impact,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably spend all my time</p>
<p>doing research on unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>I still think unsupervised learning</p>
<p>is a beautiful idea.</p>
<p>At both this past NeurIPS and ICML,</p>
<p>I was attending workshops</p>
<p>or listening to various talks</p>
<p>about self supervised learning,</p>
<p>which is one vertical segment</p>
<p>maybe of unsupervised learning</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m excited about.</p>
<p>Maybe just to summarize the idea,</p>
<p>I guess you know the idea</p>
<p>about describing fleet.</p>
<p>No, please.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the example</p>
<p>of self supervised learning.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we grab a lot</p>
<p>of unlabeled images off the internet.</p>
<p>So with infinite amounts</p>
<p>of this type of data,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take each image</p>
<p>and rotate it by a random</p>
<p>multiple of 90 degrees.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to train</p>
<p>a supervised neural network</p>
<p>to predict what was</p>
<p>the original orientation.</p>
<p>So it has to be rotated 90 degrees,</p>
<p>180 degrees, 270 degrees,</p>
<p>or zero degrees.</p>
<p>So you can generate</p>
<p>an infinite amounts of labeled data</p>
<p>because you rotated the image</p>
<p>so you know what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>ground truth label.</p>
<p>And so various researchers</p>
<p>have found that by taking</p>
<p>unlabeled data and making</p>
<p>up labeled data sets</p>
<p>and training a large neural network</p>
<p>on these tasks,</p>
<p>you can then take the hidden</p>
<p>layer representation and transfer</p>
<p>it to a different task</p>
<p>very powerfully.</p>
<p>Learning word embeddings</p>
<p>where we take a sentence,</p>
<p>delete a word,</p>
<p>predict the missing word,</p>
<p>which is how we learn.</p>
<p>One of the ways we learn</p>
<p>word embeddings</p>
<p>is another example.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>this portfolio of techniques</p>
<p>for generating these made up tasks.</p>
<p>Another one called jigsaw</p>
<p>would be if you take an image,</p>
<p>cut it up into a three by three grid,</p>
<p>so like a nine,</p>
<p>three by three puzzle piece,</p>
<p>jump up the nine pieces</p>
<p>and have a neural network predict</p>
<p>which of the nine factorial</p>
<p>possible permutations</p>
<p>it came from.</p>
<p>So many groups,</p>
<p>including OpenAI,</p>
<p>Peter B has been doing</p>
<p>some work on this too,</p>
<p>Facebook, Google Brain,</p>
<p>I think DeepMind,</p>
<p>oh actually,</p>
<p>Aaron van der Oort</p>
<p>has great work on the CPC objective.</p>
<p>So many teams are doing exciting work</p>
<p>and I think this is a way</p>
<p>to generate infinite label data</p>
<p>and I find this a very exciting</p>
<p>piece of unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>So long term you think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to unlock</p>
<p>a lot of power</p>
<p>in machine learning systems</p>
<p>is this kind of unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a whole enchilada,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just a piece of it</p>
<p>and I think this one piece</p>
<p>unsupervised,</p>
<p>self supervised learning</p>
<p>is starting to get traction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very close</p>
<p>to it being useful.</p>
<p>Well, word embedding</p>
<p>is really useful.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>closer and closer</p>
<p>to just having a significant</p>
<p>real world impact</p>
<p>maybe in computer vision and video</p>
<p>but I think this concept</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>other concepts around it.</p>
<p>You know, other unsupervised</p>
<p>learning things that I worked on</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been excited about.</p>
<p>I was really excited</p>
<p>about sparse coding</p>
<p>and ICA,</p>
<p>slow feature analysis.</p>
<p>I think all of these are ideas</p>
<p>that various of us</p>
<p>were working on</p>
<p>about a decade ago</p>
<p>before we all got distracted</p>
<p>by how well supervised</p>
<p>learning was doing.</p>
<p>So we would return</p>
<p>we would return to the fundamentals</p>
<p>of representation learning</p>
<p>that really started</p>
<p>this movement of deep learning.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot more work</p>
<p>that one could explore around</p>
<p>this theme of ideas</p>
<p>and other ideas</p>
<p>to come up with better algorithms.</p>
<p>So if we could return</p>
<p>to maybe talk quickly</p>
<p>about the specifics</p>
<p>of deep learning.ai</p>
<p>the deep learning specialization</p>
<p>perhaps how long does it take</p>
<p>to complete the course</p>
<p>would you say?</p>
<p>The official length</p>
<p>of the deep learning specialization</p>
<p>is I think 16 weeks</p>
<p>so about four months</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s go at your own pace.</p>
<p>So if you subscribe</p>
<p>to the deep learning specialization</p>
<p>there are people that finished it</p>
<p>in less than a month</p>
<p>by working more intensely</p>
<p>and studying more intensely</p>
<p>so it really depends on</p>
<p>on the individual.</p>
<p>When we created</p>
<p>the deep learning specialization</p>
<p>we wanted to make it</p>
<p>very accessible</p>
<p>and very affordable.</p>
<p>And with you know</p>
<p>Coursera and deep learning.ai</p>
<p>education mission</p>
<p>one of the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important to me</p>
<p>is that if there&rsquo;s someone</p>
<p>for whom paying anything</p>
<p>is a financial hardship</p>
<p>then just apply for financial aid</p>
<p>and get it for free.</p>
<p>If you were to recommend</p>
<p>a daily schedule for people</p>
<p>in learning whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>through the deep learning.ai</p>
<p>specialization or just learning</p>
<p>in the world of deep learning</p>
<p>what would you recommend?</p>
<p>How do they go about day to day</p>
<p>sort of specific advice</p>
<p>about learning</p>
<p>about their journey in the world</p>
<p>of deep learning machine learning?</p>
<p>I think getting the habit of learning</p>
<p>is key and that means regularity.</p>
<p>So for example</p>
<p>we send out a weekly newsletter</p>
<p>the batch every Wednesday</p>
<p>so people know it&rsquo;s coming Wednesday</p>
<p>you can spend a little bit of time</p>
<p>on Wednesday</p>
<p>catching up on the latest news</p>
<p>through the batch on Wednesday</p>
<p>and for myself</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve picked up a habit of spending</p>
<p>some time every Saturday</p>
<p>and every Sunday reading or studying</p>
<p>and so I don&rsquo;t wake up on the Saturday</p>
<p>and have to make a decision</p>
<p>do I feel like reading</p>
<p>or studying today or not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just what I do</p>
<p>and the fact is a habit</p>
<p>makes it easier.</p>
<p>So I think if someone can get into that habit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>just like we brush our teeth every morning</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think about it</p>
<p>if I thought about it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit annoying</p>
<p>to have to spend two minutes doing that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a habit that it takes</p>
<p>no cognitive load</p>
<p>but this would be so much harder</p>
<p>if we have to make a decision every morning</p>
<p>and actually that&rsquo;s the reason</p>
<p>why I wear the same thing every day as well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one less decision</p>
<p>I just get up and wear my blue shirt</p>
<p>so but I think if you can get that habit</p>
<p>that consistency of studying</p>
<p>then it actually feels easier.</p>
<p>So yeah it&rsquo;s kind of amazing</p>
<p>in my own life</p>
<p>like I play guitar every day for</p>
<p>I force myself to at least for five minutes</p>
<p>play guitar</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s a ridiculously short period of time</p>
<p>but because I&rsquo;ve gotten into that habit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible what you can accomplish</p>
<p>in a period of a year or two years</p>
<p>you can become</p>
<p>you know exceptionally good</p>
<p>at certain aspects of a thing</p>
<p>by just doing it every day</p>
<p>for a very short period of time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a miracle</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s how it works</p>
<p>it adds up over time.</p>
<p>Yeah and I think this is often</p>
<p>not about the bursts of sustained efforts</p>
<p>and the all nighters</p>
<p>because you could only do that</p>
<p>a limited number of times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the sustained effort over a long time</p>
<p>I think you know reading two research papers</p>
<p>is a nice thing to do</p>
<p>but the power is not reading two research papers</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reading two research papers a week</p>
<p>for a year</p>
<p>then you read a hundred papers</p>
<p>and you actually learn a lot</p>
<p>when you read a hundred papers.</p>
<p>So regularity and making learning a habit</p>
<p>do you have general other study tips</p>
<p>for particularly deep learning</p>
<p>that people should</p>
<p>in their process of learning</p>
<p>is there some kind of recommendations</p>
<p>or tips you have as they learn?</p>
<p>One thing I still do</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m trying to study something really deeply</p>
<p>is take handwritten notes</p>
<p>it varies</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of people</p>
<p>that take the deep learning courses</p>
<p>during a commute or something</p>
<p>where it may be more awkward to take notes</p>
<p>so I know it may not work for everyone</p>
<p>but when I&rsquo;m taking courses on Coursera</p>
<p>and I still take some every now and then</p>
<p>the most recent one I took</p>
<p>was a course on clinical trials</p>
<p>because I was interested about that</p>
<p>I got out my little Moleskine notebook</p>
<p>and what I was seeing on my desk</p>
<p>was just taking down notes</p>
<p>so what the instructor was saying</p>
<p>and that act we know that</p>
<p>that act of taking notes</p>
<p>preferably handwritten notes</p>
<p>increases retention.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;re sort of watching the video</p>
<p>just kind of pausing maybe</p>
<p>and then taking the basic insights down on paper.</p>
<p>Yeah so there have been a few studies</p>
<p>if you search online</p>
<p>you find some of these studies</p>
<p>that taking handwritten notes</p>
<p>because handwriting is slower</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re saying just now</p>
<p>it causes you to recode the knowledge</p>
<p>in your own words more</p>
<p>and that process of recoding</p>
<p>promotes long term retention</p>
<p>this is as opposed to typing</p>
<p>which is fine</p>
<p>again typing is better than nothing</p>
<p>or in taking a class</p>
<p>and not taking notes is better</p>
<p>than not taking any class at all</p>
<p>but comparing handwritten notes</p>
<p>and typing</p>
<p>you can usually type faster</p>
<p>for a lot of people</p>
<p>you can handwrite notes</p>
<p>and so when people type</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more likely to just transcribe</p>
<p>verbatim what they heard</p>
<p>and that reduces the amount of recoding</p>
<p>and that actually results</p>
<p>in less long term retention.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the psychological effect</p>
<p>there is but so true</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something fundamentally different</p>
<p>about writing hand handwriting</p>
<p>I wonder what that is</p>
<p>I wonder if it is as simple</p>
<p>as just the time it takes to write it slower</p>
<p>yeah and because you can&rsquo;t write</p>
<p>as many words</p>
<p>you have to take whatever they said</p>
<p>and summarize it into fewer words</p>
<p>and that summarization process</p>
<p>requires deeper processing of the meaning</p>
<p>which then results in better retention</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>oh and I think because of Coursera</p>
<p>I spent so much time studying pedagogy</p>
<p>this is actually one of my passions</p>
<p>I really love learning</p>
<p>how to more efficiently</p>
<p>help others learn</p>
<p>you know one of the things I do</p>
<p>both when creating videos</p>
<p>or when we write the batch is</p>
<p>I try to think is one minute spent of us</p>
<p>going to be a more efficient learning experience</p>
<p>than one minute spent anywhere else</p>
<p>and we really try to you know</p>
<p>make it time efficient for the learners</p>
<p>because you know everyone&rsquo;s busy</p>
<p>so when when we&rsquo;re editing</p>
<p>I often tell my teams</p>
<p>every word needs to fight for its life</p>
<p>and if you can delete a word</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just delete it and not wait</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not waste the learning time</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s so amazing</p>
<p>that you think that way</p>
<p>because there is millions of people</p>
<p>that are impacted by your teaching</p>
<p>and sort of that one minute spent</p>
<p>has a ripple effect right</p>
<p>through years of time</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s just fascinating to think about</p>
<p>how does one make a career</p>
<p>out of an interest in deep learning</p>
<p>do you have advice for people</p>
<p>we just talked about</p>
<p>sort of the beginning early steps</p>
<p>but if you want to make it</p>
<p>an entire life&rsquo;s journey</p>
<p>or at least a journey of a decade or two</p>
<p>how do you how do you do it</p>
<p>so most important thing is to get started</p>
<p>right and and I think in the early parts</p>
<p>of a career coursework</p>
<p>um like the deep learning specialization</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a very efficient way</p>
<p>to master this material</p>
<p>so because you know instructors</p>
<p>uh be it me or someone else</p>
<p>or you know Lawrence Maroney</p>
<p>teaches our TensorFlow specialization</p>
<p>or other things we&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>spend effort to try to make it time efficient</p>
<p>for you to learn a new concept</p>
<p>so coursework is actually a very efficient way</p>
<p>for people to learn concepts</p>
<p>and the beginning parts of breaking</p>
<p>into a new field</p>
<p>in fact one thing I see at Stanford</p>
<p>some of my PhD students want to jump</p>
<p>in the research right away</p>
<p>and I actually tend to say look</p>
<p>in your first couple years of PhD</p>
<p>and spend time taking courses</p>
<p>because it lays a foundation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine if you&rsquo;re less productive</p>
<p>in your first couple years</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be better off in the long term</p>
<p>beyond a certain point</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s materials that doesn&rsquo;t exist in courses</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too cutting edge</p>
<p>the course hasn&rsquo;t been created yet</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some practical experience</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not yet that good</p>
<p>as teaching in a course</p>
<p>and I think after exhausting</p>
<p>the efficient coursework</p>
<p>then most people need to go on</p>
<p>to either ideally work on projects</p>
<p>and then maybe also continue their learning</p>
<p>by reading blog posts and research papers</p>
<p>and things like that</p>
<p>doing projects is really important</p>
<p>and again I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to start small and just do something</p>
<p>today you read about deep learning</p>
<p>feels like oh all these people</p>
<p>doing such exciting things</p>
<p>what if I&rsquo;m not building a neural network</p>
<p>that changes the world</p>
<p>then what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>Well the point is sometimes building</p>
<p>that tiny neural network</p>
<p>you know be it MNIST or upgrade</p>
<p>to a fashion MNIST to whatever</p>
<p>so doing your own fun hobby project</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you gain the skills</p>
<p>to let you do bigger and bigger projects</p>
<p>I find this to be true at the individual level</p>
<p>and also at the organizational level</p>
<p>for a company to become good at machine learning</p>
<p>sometimes the right thing to do</p>
<p>is not to tackle the giant project</p>
<p>is instead to do the small project</p>
<p>that lets the organization learn</p>
<p>and then build out from there</p>
<p>but this is true both for individuals</p>
<p>and for companies</p>
<p>taking the first step</p>
<p>and then taking small steps is the key</p>
<p>should students pursue a PhD</p>
<p>do you think you can do so much</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the fascinating things</p>
<p>in machine learning</p>
<p>you can have so much impact</p>
<p>without ever getting a PhD</p>
<p>so what are your thoughts</p>
<p>should people go to grad school</p>
<p>should people get a PhD?</p>
<p>I think that there are multiple good options</p>
<p>of which doing a PhD could be one of them</p>
<p>I think that if someone&rsquo;s admitted</p>
<p>to a top PhD program</p>
<p>you know at MIT, Stanford, top schools</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very good experience</p>
<p>or if someone gets a job</p>
<p>at a top organization</p>
<p>at the top AI team</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s also a very good experience</p>
<p>there are some things you still need a PhD to do</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s aspiration is to be a professor</p>
<p>you know at the top academic university</p>
<p>you just need a PhD to do that</p>
<p>but if it goes to you know</p>
<p>start a company, build a company</p>
<p>do great technical work</p>
<p>I think a PhD is a good experience</p>
<p>but I would look at the different options</p>
<p>available to someone</p>
<p>you know where are the places</p>
<p>where you can get a job</p>
<p>where are the places to get a PhD program</p>
<p>and kind of weigh the pros and cons of those</p>
<p>So just to linger on that for a little bit longer</p>
<p>what final dreams and goals</p>
<p>do you think people should have</p>
<p>so what options should they explore</p>
<p>so you can work in industry</p>
<p>so for a large company</p>
<p>like Google, Facebook, Baidu</p>
<p>all these large sort of companies</p>
<p>that already have huge teams</p>
<p>of machine learning engineers</p>
<p>you can also do with an industry</p>
<p>sort of more research groups</p>
<p>that kind of like Google Research, Google Brain</p>
<p>then you can also do</p>
<p>like we said a professor in academia</p>
<p>and what else</p>
<p>oh you can build your own company</p>
<p>you can do a startup</p>
<p>is there anything that stands out</p>
<p>between those options</p>
<p>or are they all beautiful different journeys</p>
<p>that people should consider</p>
<p>I think the thing that affects your experience more</p>
<p>is less are you in this company</p>
<p>versus that company</p>
<p>or academia versus industry</p>
<p>I think the thing that affects your experience most</p>
<p>is who are the people you&rsquo;re interacting with</p>
<p>in a daily basis</p>
<p>so even if you look at some of the large companies</p>
<p>the experience of individuals</p>
<p>in different teams is very different</p>
<p>and what matters most is not the logo above the door</p>
<p>when you walk into the giant building every day</p>
<p>what matters the most is who are the 10 people</p>
<p>who are the 30 people you interact with every day</p>
<p>so I actually tend to advise people</p>
<p>if you get a job from a company</p>
<p>ask who is your manager</p>
<p>who are your peers</p>
<p>who are you actually going to talk to</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all social creatures</p>
<p>we tend to become more like the people around us</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re working with great people</p>
<p>you will learn faster</p>
<p>or if you get admitted</p>
<p>if you get a job at a great company</p>
<p>or a great university</p>
<p>maybe the logo you walk in is great</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re actually stuck on some team</p>
<p>doing really work that doesn&rsquo;t excite you</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s actually a really bad experience</p>
<p>so this is true both for universities</p>
<p>and for large companies</p>
<p>for small companies you can kind of figure out</p>
<p>who you&rsquo;ll be working with quite quickly</p>
<p>and I tend to advise people</p>
<p>if a company refuses to tell you</p>
<p>who you will work with</p>
<p>someone say oh join us</p>
<p>the rotation system will figure it out</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a worrying answer</p>
<p>because it because it means you may not get sent</p>
<p>to you may not actually get to a team</p>
<p>with great peers and great people to work with</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a really profound advice</p>
<p>that we kind of sometimes sweep</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t consider too rigorously or carefully</p>
<p>the people around you are really often</p>
<p>especially when you accomplish great things</p>
<p>it seems the great things are accomplished</p>
<p>because of the people around you</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s not about the the</p>
<p>where whether you learn this thing</p>
<p>or that thing or like you said</p>
<p>the logo that hangs up top</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the people that&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s such a hard search process</p>
<p>of finding just like finding the right friends</p>
<p>and somebody to get married with</p>
<p>and that kind of thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very hard search</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a people search problem</p>
<p>yeah but I think when someone interviews</p>
<p>you know at a university</p>
<p>or the research lab or the large corporation</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to insist on just asking</p>
<p>who are the people</p>
<p>who is my manager</p>
<p>and if you refuse to tell me</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna think well maybe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have a good answer</p>
<p>it may not be someone I like</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t particularly connect</p>
<p>if something feels off with the people</p>
<p>then don&rsquo;t stick to it</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a really important signal to consider</p>
<p>yeah yeah and actually I actually</p>
<p>in my standard class CS230</p>
<p>as well as an ACM talk</p>
<p>I think I gave like a hour long talk</p>
<p>on career advice</p>
<p>including on the job search process</p>
<p>and then some of these</p>
<p>so you can find those videos online</p>
<p>awesome and I&rsquo;ll point them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll point people to them</p>
<p>beautiful</p>
<p>so the AI fund helps AI startups</p>
<p>get off the ground</p>
<p>or perhaps you can elaborate</p>
<p>on all the fun things it&rsquo;s involved with</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your advice</p>
<p>and how does one build a successful AI startup</p>
<p>you know in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>a lot of startup failures</p>
<p>come from building other products</p>
<p>that no one wanted</p>
<p>so when you know cool technology</p>
<p>but who&rsquo;s going to use it</p>
<p>so I think I tend to be very outcome driven</p>
<p>and customer obsessed</p>
<p>ultimately we don&rsquo;t get to vote</p>
<p>if we succeed or fail</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only the customer</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re the only one</p>
<p>that gets a thumbs up or thumbs down vote</p>
<p>in the long term</p>
<p>in the short term</p>
<p>you know there are various people</p>
<p>that get various votes</p>
<p>but in the long term</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what really matters</p>
<p>so as you build the startup</p>
<p>you have to constantly ask the question</p>
<p>will the customer give a thumbs up on this</p>
<p>I think so</p>
<p>I think startups that are very customer focused</p>
<p>customer obsessed</p>
<p>deeply understand the customer</p>
<p>and are oriented to serve the customer</p>
<p>are more likely to succeed</p>
<p>with the provisional</p>
<p>I think all of us should only do things</p>
<p>that we think create social good</p>
<p>and moves the world forward</p>
<p>so I personally don&rsquo;t want to build</p>
<p>addictive digital products</p>
<p>just to sell a lot of ads</p>
<p>or you know there are things</p>
<p>that could be lucrative</p>
<p>that I won&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>but if we can find ways to serve people</p>
<p>in meaningful ways</p>
<p>I think those can be</p>
<p>great things to do</p>
<p>either in the academic setting</p>
<p>or in a corporate setting</p>
<p>or a startup setting</p>
<p>so can you give me the idea</p>
<p>of why you started the AI fund</p>
<p>I remember when I was leading</p>
<p>the AI group at Baidu</p>
<p>I had two jobs</p>
<p>two parts of my job</p>
<p>one was to build an AI engine</p>
<p>to support the existing businesses</p>
<p>and that was running</p>
<p>just ran</p>
<p>just performed by itself</p>
<p>there was a second part of my job at the time</p>
<p>which was to try to systematically initiate</p>
<p>new lines of businesses</p>
<p>using the company&rsquo;s AI capabilities</p>
<p>so you know the self driving car team</p>
<p>came out of my group</p>
<p>the smart speaker team</p>
<p>similar to what is Amazon Echo Alexa in the US</p>
<p>but we actually announced it</p>
<p>before Amazon did</p>
<p>so Baidu wasn&rsquo;t following Amazon</p>
<p>that came out of my group</p>
<p>and I found that to be</p>
<p>actually the most fun part of my job</p>
<p>so what I wanted to do was</p>
<p>to build AI fund as a startup studio</p>
<p>to systematically create new startups</p>
<p>from scratch</p>
<p>with all the things we can now do with AI</p>
<p>I think the ability to build new teams</p>
<p>to go after this rich space of opportunities</p>
<p>is a very important way</p>
<p>to very important mechanism</p>
<p>to get these projects done</p>
<p>that I think will move the world forward</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to build a few teams</p>
<p>that had a meaningful positive impact</p>
<p>and I felt that we might be able to do this</p>
<p>in a more systematic repeatable way</p>
<p>so a startup studio is a relatively new concept</p>
<p>there are maybe dozens of startup studios</p>
<p>you know right now</p>
<p>but I feel like all of us</p>
<p>many teams are still trying to figure out</p>
<p>how do you systematically build companies</p>
<p>with a high success rate</p>
<p>so I think even a lot of my you know</p>
<p>venture capital friends are</p>
<p>seem to be more and more building companies</p>
<p>rather than investing in companies</p>
<p>but I find a fascinating thing to do</p>
<p>to figure out the mechanisms</p>
<p>by which we could systematically build</p>
<p>successful teams, successful businesses</p>
<p>in areas that we find meaningful</p>
<p>so a startup studio is something</p>
<p>is a place and a mechanism</p>
<p>for startups to go from zero to success</p>
<p>to try to develop a blueprint</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a place for us</p>
<p>to build startups from scratch</p>
<p>so we often bring in founders</p>
<p>and work with them</p>
<p>or maybe even have existing ideas</p>
<p>that we match founders with</p>
<p>and then this launches</p>
<p>you know hopefully into successful companies</p>
<p>so how close are you to figuring out</p>
<p>a way to automate the process</p>
<p>of starting from scratch</p>
<p>and building a successful AI startup</p>
<p>yeah I think we&rsquo;ve been constantly</p>
<p>improving and iterating on our processes</p>
<p>how we do that</p>
<p>so things like you know</p>
<p>how many customer calls do we need to make</p>
<p>in order to get customer validation</p>
<p>how do we make sure this technology</p>
<p>can be built</p>
<p>quite a lot of our businesses</p>
<p>need cutting edge machine learning algorithms</p>
<p>so you know kind of algorithms</p>
<p>have developed in the last one or two years</p>
<p>and even if it works in a research paper</p>
<p>it turns out taking the production</p>
<p>is really hard</p>
<p>there are a lot of issues</p>
<p>for making these things work in the real life</p>
<p>that are not widely addressed in academia</p>
<p>so how do we validate</p>
<p>that this is actually doable</p>
<p>how do you build a team</p>
<p>get the specialized domain knowledge</p>
<p>be it in education or health care</p>
<p>whatever sector we&rsquo;re focusing on</p>
<p>so I think we&rsquo;ve actually getting</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been getting much better</p>
<p>at giving the entrepreneurs</p>
<p>a high success rate</p>
<p>but I think we&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>I think the whole world is still</p>
<p>in the early phases of figuring this out</p>
<p>but do you think there is some aspects</p>
<p>of that process that are transferable</p>
<p>from one startup to another</p>
<p>to another to another</p>
<p>yeah very much so</p>
<p>you know starting from scratch</p>
<p>you know starting a company</p>
<p>to most entrepreneurs</p>
<p>is a really lonely thing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen so many entrepreneurs</p>
<p>not know how to make certain decisions</p>
<p>like when do you need to</p>
<p>how do you do B2B sales right</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>or how do you market this efficiently</p>
<p>other than you know buying ads</p>
<p>which is really expensive</p>
<p>are there more efficient tactics for that</p>
<p>or for a machine learning project</p>
<p>you know basic decisions</p>
<p>can change the course of</p>
<p>whether machine learning product works or not</p>
<p>and so there are so many hundreds of decisions</p>
<p>that entrepreneurs need to make</p>
<p>and making a mistake</p>
<p>and a couple key decisions</p>
<p>can have a huge impact</p>
<p>on the fate of the company</p>
<p>so I think a startup studio</p>
<p>provides a support structure</p>
<p>that makes starting a company</p>
<p>much less of a lonely experience</p>
<p>and also when facing with these key decisions</p>
<p>like trying to hire your first</p>
<p>uh the VP of engineering</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a good selection criteria</p>
<p>how do you solve</p>
<p>should I hire this person or not</p>
<p>by helping by having a ecosystem</p>
<p>around the entrepreneurs</p>
<p>the founders to help</p>
<p>I think we help them at the key moments</p>
<p>and hopefully significantly</p>
<p>make them more enjoyable</p>
<p>and then higher success rate</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s somebody to brainstorm with</p>
<p>in these very difficult decision points</p>
<p>and also to help them recognize</p>
<p>what they may not even realize</p>
<p>is a key decision point</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>and probably the most important part</p>
<p>yeah actually I can say one other thing</p>
<p>um you know I think</p>
<p>building companies is one thing</p>
<p>but I feel like it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>that we build companies</p>
<p>that move the world forward</p>
<p>for example within the AI Fund team</p>
<p>there was once an idea</p>
<p>for a new company</p>
<p>that if it had succeeded</p>
<p>would have resulted in people</p>
<p>watching a lot more videos</p>
<p>in a certain narrow vertical type of video</p>
<p>um I looked at it</p>
<p>the business case was fine</p>
<p>the revenue case was fine</p>
<p>but I looked and just said</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to do this</p>
<p>like you know I don&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>just want to have a lot more people</p>
<p>watch this type of video</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t educational</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an educational baby</p>
<p>and so and so I I I I code the idea</p>
<p>on the basis that I didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>it would actually help people</p>
<p>so um whether building companies</p>
<p>or working enterprises</p>
<p>or doing personal projects</p>
<p>I think um it&rsquo;s up to each of us</p>
<p>to figure out what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>we want to make in the world</p>
<p>With landing AI</p>
<p>you help already established companies</p>
<p>grow their AI and machine learning efforts</p>
<p>how does a large company</p>
<p>integrate machine learning</p>
<p>into their efforts?</p>
<p>AI is a general purpose technology</p>
<p>and I think it will transform every industry</p>
<p>our community has already transformed</p>
<p>to a large extent</p>
<p>the software internet sector</p>
<p>most software internet companies</p>
<p>outside the top right</p>
<p>five or six or three or four</p>
<p>already have reasonable</p>
<p>machine learning capabilities</p>
<p>or or getting there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still room for improvement</p>
<p>but when I look outside</p>
<p>the software internet sector</p>
<p>everything from manufacturing</p>
<p>agriculture, healthcare</p>
<p>logistics transportation</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many opportunities</p>
<p>that very few people are working on</p>
<p>so I think the next wave of AI</p>
<p>is for us to also transform</p>
<p>all of those other industries</p>
<p>there was a McKinsey study</p>
<p>estimating 13 trillion dollars</p>
<p>of global economic growth</p>
<p>US GDP is 19 trillion dollars</p>
<p>so 13 trillion is a big number</p>
<p>or PwC estimates 16 trillion dollars</p>
<p>so whatever number is is large</p>
<p>but the interesting thing to me</p>
<p>was a lot of that impact</p>
<p>will be outside</p>
<p>the software internet sector</p>
<p>so we need more teams</p>
<p>to work with these companies</p>
<p>to help them adopt AI</p>
<p>and I think this is one thing</p>
<p>so make you know</p>
<p>help drive global economic growth</p>
<p>and make humanity more powerful</p>
<p>and like you said the impact is there</p>
<p>so what are the best industries</p>
<p>the biggest industries</p>
<p>where AI can help</p>
<p>perhaps outside the software tech sector</p>
<p>frankly I think it&rsquo;s all of them</p>
<p>some of the ones I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time on</p>
<p>are manufacturing agriculture</p>
<p>look into healthcare</p>
<p>for example in manufacturing</p>
<p>we do a lot of work in visual inspection</p>
<p>where today there are people standing around</p>
<p>using the eye human eye</p>
<p>to check if you know</p>
<p>this plastic part or the smartphone</p>
<p>or this thing has a scratch</p>
<p>or a dent or something in it</p>
<p>we can use a camera to take a picture</p>
<p>use a algorithm</p>
<p>deep learning and other things</p>
<p>to check if it&rsquo;s defective or not</p>
<p>and thus help factories improve yield</p>
<p>and improve quality</p>
<p>and improve throughput</p>
<p>it turns out the practical problems</p>
<p>we run into are very different</p>
<p>than the ones you might read about</p>
<p>in in most research papers</p>
<p>the data sets are really small</p>
<p>so we face small data problems</p>
<p>you know the factories</p>
<p>keep on changing the environment</p>
<p>so it works well on your test set</p>
<p>but guess what</p>
<p>something changes in the factory</p>
<p>the lights go on or off</p>
<p>recently there was a factory</p>
<p>in which a bird threw through the factory</p>
<p>and pooped on something</p>
<p>and so that changed stuff</p>
<p>and so increasing our algorithm</p>
<p>makes robustness</p>
<p>so all the changes happen in the factory</p>
<p>I find that we run a lot of practical problems</p>
<p>that are not as widely discussed</p>
<p>in academia</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really fun</p>
<p>kind of being on the cutting edge</p>
<p>solving these problems before</p>
<p>maybe before many people are even aware</p>
<p>that there is a problem there</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s such a fascinating space</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely right</p>
<p>but what is the first step</p>
<p>that a company should take</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just scary leap</p>
<p>into this new world of</p>
<p>going from the human eye</p>
<p>inspecting to digitizing that process</p>
<p>having a camera</p>
<p>having an algorithm</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the first step</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s the early journey</p>
<p>that you recommend</p>
<p>that you see these companies taking</p>
<p>I published a document</p>
<p>called the AI Transformation Playbook</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s online</p>
<p>and taught briefly in the AI for Everyone</p>
<p>course on Coursera</p>
<p>about the long term journey</p>
<p>that companies should take</p>
<p>but the first step</p>
<p>is actually to start small</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot more companies fail</p>
<p>by starting too big</p>
<p>than by starting too small</p>
<p>take even Google</p>
<p>you know most people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>how hard it was</p>
<p>and how controversial it was</p>
<p>in the early days</p>
<p>so when I started Google Brain</p>
<p>it was controversial</p>
<p>you know people thought</p>
<p>deep learning near nest</p>
<p>tried it didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>why would you want to do deep learning</p>
<p>so my first internal customer</p>
<p>within Google</p>
<p>was the Google speech team</p>
<p>which is not the most lucrative</p>
<p>project in Google</p>
<p>not the most important</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not web search or advertising</p>
<p>but by starting small</p>
<p>my team helped the speech team</p>
<p>build a more accurate speech recognition system</p>
<p>and this caused their peers</p>
<p>other teams to start</p>
<p>to have more faith in deep learning</p>
<p>my second internal customer</p>
<p>was the Google Maps team</p>
<p>where we used computer vision</p>
<p>to read house numbers</p>
<p>from basic street view images</p>
<p>to more accurately locate houses</p>
<p>within Google Maps</p>
<p>so improve the quality of geodata</p>
<p>and it was only after those two successes</p>
<p>that I then started</p>
<p>a more serious conversation</p>
<p>with the Google Ads team</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s a ripple effect</p>
<p>that you showed that it works</p>
<p>in these cases</p>
<p>and then it just propagates</p>
<p>through the entire company</p>
<p>that this thing has a lot of value</p>
<p>and use for us</p>
<p>I think the early small scale projects</p>
<p>it helps the teams gain faith</p>
<p>but also helps the teams learn</p>
<p>what these technologies do</p>
<p>I still remember when our first GPU server</p>
<p>it was a server under some guy&rsquo;s desk</p>
<p>and you know and then that taught us</p>
<p>early important lessons about</p>
<p>how do you have multiple users</p>
<p>share a set of GPUs</p>
<p>which is really not obvious at the time</p>
<p>but those early lessons were important</p>
<p>we learned a lot from that first GPU server</p>
<p>that later helped the teams think through</p>
<p>how to scale it up</p>
<p>to much larger deployments</p>
<p>Are there concrete challenges</p>
<p>that companies face</p>
<p>that you see is important for them to solve?</p>
<p>I think building and deploying</p>
<p>machine learning systems is hard</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge gulf between</p>
<p>something that works</p>
<p>in a jupyter notebook on your laptop</p>
<p>versus something that runs</p>
<p>their production deployment setting</p>
<p>in a factory or agriculture plant or whatever</p>
<p>so I see a lot of people</p>
<p>get something to work on your laptop</p>
<p>and say wow look what I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s great that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very important first step</p>
<p>but a lot of teams underestimate</p>
<p>the rest of the steps needed</p>
<p>so for example</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this exact same conversation</p>
<p>between a lot of machine learning people</p>
<p>and business people</p>
<p>the machine learning person says</p>
<p>look my algorithm does well on the test set</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a clean test set at the end of peak</p>
<p>and the machine and the business person says</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>but your algorithm sucks it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and the machine learning person says</p>
<p>no wait I did well on the test set</p>
<p>and I think there is a gulf between</p>
<p>what it takes to do well on the test set</p>
<p>on your hard drive</p>
<p>versus what it takes to work well</p>
<p>in a deployment setting</p>
<p>some common problems</p>
<p>robustness and generalization</p>
<p>you deploy something in the factory</p>
<p>maybe they chop down a tree outside the factory</p>
<p>so the tree no longer covers the window</p>
<p>and the lighting is different</p>
<p>so the test set changes</p>
<p>and in machine learning</p>
<p>and especially in academia</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know how to deal with test set distributions</p>
<p>that are dramatically different</p>
<p>than the training set distribution</p>
<p>you know that this research</p>
<p>the stuff like domain annotation</p>
<p>transfer learning</p>
<p>you know there are people working on it</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re really not good at this</p>
<p>so how do you actually get this to work</p>
<p>because your test set distribution</p>
<p>is going to change</p>
<p>and I think also if you look at the number of lines of code</p>
<p>in the software system</p>
<p>the machine learning model is maybe five percent</p>
<p>or even fewer</p>
<p>relative to the entire software system</p>
<p>you need to build</p>
<p>so how do you get all that work done</p>
<p>and make it reliable and systematic</p>
<p>so good software engineering work</p>
<p>is fundamental here</p>
<p>to building a successful small machine learning system</p>
<p>yes and the software system</p>
<p>needs to interface with the machine learning system</p>
<p>needs to interface with people&rsquo;s workloads</p>
<p>so machine learning is automation on steroids</p>
<p>if we take one task out of many tasks</p>
<p>that are done in the factory</p>
<p>so the factory does lots of things</p>
<p>one task is vision inspection</p>
<p>if we automate that one task</p>
<p>it can be really valuable</p>
<p>but you may need to redesign a lot of other tasks</p>
<p>around that one task</p>
<p>for example say the machine learning algorithm</p>
<p>says this is defective</p>
<p>what are you supposed to do</p>
<p>do you throw it away</p>
<p>do you get a human to double check</p>
<p>do you want to rework it or fix it</p>
<p>so you need to redesign a lot of tasks</p>
<p>around that thing you&rsquo;ve now automated</p>
<p>so planning for the change management</p>
<p>and making sure that the software you write</p>
<p>is consistent with the new workflow</p>
<p>and you take the time to explain to people</p>
<p>what needs to happen</p>
<p>so I think what landing AI has become good at</p>
<p>and then I think we learned by making the steps</p>
<p>and you know painful experiences</p>
<p>well my what would become good at is</p>
<p>working with our partners to think through</p>
<p>all the things beyond just the machine learning model</p>
<p>or running the jupyter notebook</p>
<p>but to build the entire system</p>
<p>manage the change process</p>
<p>and figure out how to deploy this in a way</p>
<p>that has an actual impact</p>
<p>the processes that the large software tech companies</p>
<p>use for deploying don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>for a lot of other scenarios</p>
<p>for example when I was leading large speech teams</p>
<p>if the speech recognition system goes down</p>
<p>what happens well alarms goes off</p>
<p>and then someone like me would say hey</p>
<p>you 20 engine environment</p>
<p>you 20 engineers please fix this</p>
<p>but if you have a system girl in the factory</p>
<p>there are not 20 machine learning engineers</p>
<p>sitting around you can page your duty</p>
<p>and have them fix it</p>
<p>so how do you deal with the maintenance</p>
<p>or the or the dev ops or the mo ops</p>
<p>or the other aspects of this</p>
<p>so these are concepts that I think landing AI</p>
<p>and a few other teams on the cutting edge</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t even have systematic terminology yet</p>
<p>to describe some of the stuff we do</p>
<p>because I think we&rsquo;re inventing it on the fly.</p>
<p>So you mentioned some people are interested</p>
<p>in discovering mathematical beauty</p>
<p>and truth in the universe</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re interested in having</p>
<p>a big positive impact in the world</p>
<p>so let me ask the two are not inconsistent</p>
<p>no they&rsquo;re all together</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only half joking</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re probably interested a little bit in both</p>
<p>but let me ask a romanticized question</p>
<p>so much of the work</p>
<p>your work and our discussion today</p>
<p>has been on applied AI</p>
<p>maybe you can even call narrow AI</p>
<p>where the goal is to create systems</p>
<p>that automate some specific process</p>
<p>that adds a lot of value to the world</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another branch of AI</p>
<p>starting with Alan Turing</p>
<p>that kind of dreams of creating human level</p>
<p>or superhuman level intelligence</p>
<p>is this something you dream of as well</p>
<p>do you think we human beings</p>
<p>will ever build a human level intelligence</p>
<p>or superhuman level intelligence system?</p>
<p>I would love to get to AGI</p>
<p>and I think humanity will</p>
<p>but whether it takes 100 years</p>
<p>or 500 or 5000</p>
<p>I find hard to estimate</p>
<p>do you have</p>
<p>some folks have worries</p>
<p>about the different trajectories</p>
<p>that path would take</p>
<p>even existential threats of an AGI system</p>
<p>do you have such concerns</p>
<p>whether in the short term or the long term?</p>
<p>I do worry about the long term fate of humanity</p>
<p>I do wonder as well</p>
<p>I do worry about overpopulation on the planet Mars</p>
<p>just not today</p>
<p>I think there will be a day</p>
<p>when maybe someday in the future</p>
<p>Mars will be polluted</p>
<p>there are all these children dying</p>
<p>and someone will look back at this video</p>
<p>and say Andrew how is Andrew so heartless?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t care about all these children</p>
<p>dying on the planet Mars</p>
<p>and I apologize to the future viewer</p>
<p>I do care about the children</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>productively work on that today</p>
<p>your picture will be in the dictionary</p>
<p>for the people who are ignorant</p>
<p>about the overpopulation on Mars</p>
<p>yes so it&rsquo;s a long term problem</p>
<p>is there something in the short term</p>
<p>we should be thinking about</p>
<p>in terms of aligning the values of our AI systems</p>
<p>with the values of us humans</p>
<p>sort of something that Stuart Russell</p>
<p>and other folks are thinking about</p>
<p>as this system develops more and more</p>
<p>we want to make sure that it represents</p>
<p>the better angels of our nature</p>
<p>the ethics the values of our society</p>
<p>you know if you take self driving cars</p>
<p>the biggest problem with self driving cars</p>
<p>is not that there&rsquo;s some trolley dilemma</p>
<p>and you teach this so you know</p>
<p>how many times when you are driving your car</p>
<p>did you face this moral dilemma</p>
<p>who do I crash into?</p>
<p>so I think self driving cars</p>
<p>will run into that problem roughly as often</p>
<p>as we do when we drive our cars</p>
<p>the biggest problem with self driving cars</p>
<p>is when there&rsquo;s a big white truck across the road</p>
<p>and what you should do is break</p>
<p>and not crash into it</p>
<p>and the self driving car fails</p>
<p>and it crashes into it</p>
<p>so I think we need to solve that problem first</p>
<p>I think the problem with some of these discussions</p>
<p>about AGI you know alignments</p>
<p>the paperclip problem</p>
<p>is that is a huge distraction</p>
<p>from the much harder problems</p>
<p>that we actually need to address today</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the hardest problems</p>
<p>we need to address today</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the hard problems</p>
<p>we need to address today</p>
<p>I think bias is a huge issue</p>
<p>I worry about wealth and equality</p>
<p>the AI and internet are causing</p>
<p>an acceleration of concentration of power</p>
<p>because we can now centralize data</p>
<p>use AI to process it</p>
<p>and so industry after industry</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve affected every industry</p>
<p>so the internet industry has a lot of</p>
<p>win and take most</p>
<p>or win and take all dynamics</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve infected all these other industries</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re also giving these other industries</p>
<p>most of them to take all flavors</p>
<p>so look at what Uber and Lyft</p>
<p>did to the taxi industry</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re doing this type of thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot and so this</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re creating tremendous wealth</p>
<p>but how do we make sure that the wealth</p>
<p>is fairly shared</p>
<p>I think that and then how do we help</p>
<p>people whose jobs are displaced</p>
<p>you know I think education is part of it</p>
<p>there may be even more</p>
<p>that we need to do than education</p>
<p>I think bias is a serious issue</p>
<p>there are adverse uses of AI</p>
<p>like deepfakes being used</p>
<p>for various and various purposes</p>
<p>so I worry about some teams</p>
<p>maybe accidentally</p>
<p>and I hope not deliberately</p>
<p>making a lot of noise about things</p>
<p>that problems in the distant future</p>
<p>rather than focusing on</p>
<p>some of the much harder problems</p>
<p>yeah the overshadow of the problems</p>
<p>that we have already today</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re exceptionally challenging</p>
<p>like those you said</p>
<p>and even the silly ones</p>
<p>but the ones that have a huge impact</p>
<p>huge impact</p>
<p>which is the lighting variation</p>
<p>outside of your factory window</p>
<p>that that ultimately is</p>
<p>what makes the difference</p>
<p>between like you said</p>
<p>the Jupiter notebook</p>
<p>and something that actually transforms</p>
<p>an entire industry potentially</p>
<p>yeah and I think</p>
<p>and then just to some companies</p>
<p>or a regulator comes to you</p>
<p>and says look your product</p>
<p>is messing things up</p>
<p>fixing it may have a revenue impact</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s much more fun to talk to them</p>
<p>about how you promise</p>
<p>not to wipe out humanity</p>
<p>and to face the actually really hard problems we face</p>
<p>so your life has been a great journey</p>
<p>from teaching to research</p>
<p>to entrepreneurship</p>
<p>two questions</p>
<p>one are there regrets</p>
<p>moments that if you went back</p>
<p>you would do differently</p>
<p>and two are there moments</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re especially proud of</p>
<p>moments that made you truly happy</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;ve made so many mistakes</p>
<p>it feels like every time</p>
<p>I discover something</p>
<p>I go why didn&rsquo;t I think of this</p>
<p>you know five years earlier</p>
<p>or even 10 years earlier</p>
<p>and as recently</p>
<p>and then sometimes I read a book</p>
<p>and I go I wish I read this book 10 years ago</p>
<p>my life would have been so different</p>
<p>although that happened recently</p>
<p>and then I was thinking</p>
<p>if only I read this book</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re starting up Coursera</p>
<p>I could have been so much better</p>
<p>but I discovered the book</p>
<p>had not yet been written</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting Coursera</p>
<p>so that made me feel better</p>
<p>but I find that the process of discovery</p>
<p>we keep on finding out things</p>
<p>that seem so obvious in hindsight</p>
<p>but it always takes us so much longer</p>
<p>than than I wish to to figure it out</p>
<p>so on the second question</p>
<p>are there moments in your life</p>
<p>that if you look back</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re especially proud of</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re especially happy</p>
<p>what would be the that filled you with happiness</p>
<p>and fulfillment</p>
<p>well two answers</p>
<p>one does my daughter know of her</p>
<p>yes of course</p>
<p>because I know how much time I spent with her</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t spend enough time with her</p>
<p>congratulations by the way</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>and then second is helping other people</p>
<p>I think to me</p>
<p>I think the meaning of life</p>
<p>is helping others achieve</p>
<p>whatever are their dreams</p>
<p>and then also to try to move the world forward</p>
<p>making humanity more powerful as a whole</p>
<p>so the times that I felt most happy</p>
<p>most proud was when I felt</p>
<p>someone else allowed me the good fortune</p>
<p>of helping them a little bit</p>
<p>on the path to their dreams</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no better way to end it</p>
<p>than talking about happiness</p>
<p>and the meaning of life</p>
<p>so Andrew it&rsquo;s a huge honor</p>
<p>me and millions of people</p>
