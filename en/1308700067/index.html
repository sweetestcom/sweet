    <p>Our card this week is K. Rue Lolo, the Queen of Hearts from Colorado.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve already noticed, this is the second episode we&rsquo;re releasing today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bonus mini episode, a little shorter than a normal one, because there isn&rsquo;t a ton</p>
<p>of information, but we knew that this was a case that still had to be told.</p>
<p>Cases like this are often hard for us to tell because there&rsquo;s not always a lot to the investigation</p>
<p>once police realize the victim wasn&rsquo;t the intended target.</p>
<p>But K. Rue deserves to have his story told just as much as any of the other cases that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve listened to me tell, because he was a kind-hearted, family-oriented 24-year-old</p>
<p>who was visiting relatives in Denver, Colorado, when he was brutally gunned down for seemingly</p>
<p>no reason.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, K. Rue&rsquo;s friends and family have waited in agony for answers,</p>
<p>and for justice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>Around 9 p.m. on October 16, 2009, Detective Mark Kreider with the Denver Police Department</p>
<p>was relaxing after a long week when he got a call that there had been a shooting at Garden</p>
<p>Court Apartments, a large apartment complex on Denver&rsquo;s east side.</p>
<p>A young man had been shot multiple times and was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced</p>
<p>dead.</p>
<p>Detective Kreider was told that the scene at the apartment complex was already swarming</p>
<p>with officers, paramedics, firefighters, and night shift detectives.</p>
<p>So as lead investigator, he decided his energy was best spent conducting interviews with</p>
<p>potential witnesses.</p>
<p>He responded to police headquarters, where 911 callers from the shooting were waiting</p>
<p>to be interviewed.</p>
<p>A few of them had just heard the shots ring out, and that was it.</p>
<p>But others had actually walked outside to see the young man lying in the courtyard,</p>
<p>bleeding out.</p>
<p>And one of the callers said a person visiting them actually ran out to the courtyard and</p>
<p>tried to administer first aid by covering his wounds.</p>
<p>But none of the callers had actually witnessed the shooting.</p>
<p>Detective Kreider knew that the lack of witnesses was going to hurt the investigation, but he</p>
<p>was hopeful that the night shift detectives were having better luck at the scene.</p>
<p>And they were.</p>
<p>Paramedics had cut the man&rsquo;s clothes off before rushing him to the hospital, and in</p>
<p>the pockets of his clothing, investigators found various items, one of which was immediately</p>
<p>helpful to the investigation.</p>
<p>It was a Minnesota State University ID card for their victim, K. Rue Lolo.</p>
<p>Detectives also recovered several items from the scene that were around the victim&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>Detective Kreider didn&rsquo;t want to say what those items were, but he said there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>way to know if they belonged to the shooter or shooters, or if they were there before</p>
<p>the attack.</p>
<p>These items, they weren&rsquo;t like items that were directly related to the shooting.</p>
<p>These were just personal items.</p>
<p>And I say personal items, it could be trash.</p>
<p>But why is it here?</p>
<p>Why is it next to K. Rue?</p>
<p>Did somebody drop it?</p>
<p>Did a resident drop it?</p>
<p>Did the shooter drop it?</p>
<p>Did a guy with the shooter drop it?</p>
<p>Just in case, investigators took those items into evidence.</p>
<p>After the crime scene was cleared and the 911 callers interviewed, investigators canvassed</p>
<p>the whole apartment complex, knocking on doors, showing anyone who answered a picture</p>
<p>of K. Rue to find out if they&rsquo;d seen something or if they knew him.</p>
<p>And several people said they did know K. Rue.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the people that they spoke with were actually related to him.</p>
<p>Police learned that K. Rue himself didn&rsquo;t live at the complex.</p>
<p>He lived on the other side of town, but several of his cousins and extended family members</p>
<p>did live there, like a dozen or more.</p>
<p>But it was one of them who told police that K. Rue was there visiting her that evening.</p>
<p>The two of them were waiting for another cousin to arrive when K. Rue told him that he was</p>
<p>going to step outside to make a call, but then K. Rue never returned.</p>
<p>Now his cousin didn&rsquo;t know why he never came back.</p>
<p>In fact, according to the Denver Post, none of them had realized that the young man killed</p>
<p>in the courtyard was one of their own until officers came knocking on their doors.</p>
<p>Police went on to talk with all of K. Rue&rsquo;s family at the complex, hoping to learn if</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d had any recent arguments or if there was anyone who would want to harm him.</p>
<p>And most of them said that, to their knowledge, he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t even lived in Denver that long, he had just moved there a few months ago.</p>
<p>They said he was a nice guy who got along with everyone.</p>
<p>But there was one of his relatives who said that there was something that happened recently</p>
<p>that stood out to him.</p>
<p>He thought he heard of an issue that K. Rue had at this convenience store where he worked.</p>
<p>Basically like a run-in with a customer that led to police being called.</p>
<p>But investigators couldn&rsquo;t find any record of any police responses to that convenience</p>
<p>store involving K. Rue.</p>
<p>But you know, just in case the report slipped through the cracks somehow, they actually</p>
<p>went to the store to see if anyone there knew about this supposed fight with a customer.</p>
<p>They talked with K. Rue&rsquo;s supervisor and one of his co-workers, and neither of them</p>
<p>knew about any incident involving K. Rue.</p>
<p>They said he didn&rsquo;t have a problem with anybody.</p>
<p>So investigators focused back on the scene at the apartment complex, looking for any</p>
<p>kind of evidence that would point to what happened to K. Rue and why.</p>
<p>We pulled some surveillance cameras and what we have are vehicles driving north and south</p>
<p>down on Syracuse Street, which is the road in front of the complex.</p>
<p>But in 2009, the quality was not very good.</p>
<p>We could just see vehicles.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even make out, you know, if it was a sedan or an SUV, we primarily see headlights.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t even know if they were involved.</p>
<p>Even early on, the police department&rsquo;s investigation hit a wall.</p>
<p>And while police were scrambling for leads, K. Rue&rsquo;s family was still processing the shock</p>
<p>of his murder.</p>
<p>I mean, of all people, why him, they kept asking.</p>
<p>He immigrated to the U.S. from Ethiopia over a decade prior and lived in Minnesota up until</p>
<p>four or five months ago.</p>
<p>He moved to Denver to be closer to his extended family, to get a job and fulfill his dream</p>
<p>of going back to school.</p>
<p>And he was working hard to make that dream a reality.</p>
<p>His family told the Denver Post that he registered for classes at the Community College of Aurora</p>
<p>shortly before his death.</p>
<p>Victimology in a homicide investigation is extremely important.</p>
<p>You really need to get to know your victim.</p>
<p>That can open up so many doors to an investigation.</p>
<p>With K. Rue&rsquo;s victimology, all we found was he was a good guy.</p>
<p>He was just a good guy.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have any vices.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t drink.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t smoke.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t involved in gangs.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t go to bars.</p>
<p>K. Rue was a good kid.</p>
<p>He was a good guy.</p>
<p>This was an innocent, innocent guy.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have an enemy in the world, as far as I know.</p>
<p>And this just shouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>As the days went by, and Detective Kreider learned more about K. Rue, he became more</p>
<p>and more convinced that it might have been a case of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>I mean, he couldn&rsquo;t find a soul in the world who wanted to harm K. Rue.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if K. Rue Lolo was the person they thought he was.</p>
<p>He was walking through the apartment complex at night with his hoodie on.</p>
<p>He was their dad.</p>
<p>But investigators didn&rsquo;t know who else the shooter or shooters might have been after.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t anyone obvious at the apartment complex that they may have wanted to target,</p>
<p>and there weren&rsquo;t any other fatal shootings in the area that detectives could link to</p>
<p>K. Rue&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>So, if it was a case of mistaken identity, the shooter had to be someone else.</p>
<p>But investigators didn&rsquo;t know who else the shooter or shooters might have been after.</p>
<p>So, if it was a case of mistaken identity, the shooter hadn&rsquo;t come back to kill again</p>
<p>after they realized that they&rsquo;d shot the wrong person.</p>
<p>Which meant finding the intended target would be difficult, maybe impossible,</p>
<p>if an intended target existed at all.</p>
<p>In the weeks following K. Rue&rsquo;s murder, his name started falling out of the headlines.</p>
<p>And Detective Kreider knew that keeping the public&rsquo;s eye on this case was the only way</p>
<p>it was going to get solved.</p>
<p>So, to get people talking, Detective Kreider and several of K. Rue&rsquo;s relatives gathered</p>
<p>at Garden Court Apartments and invited local media to attend.</p>
<p>They passed out flyers, the family talked to the media, they were doing anything they</p>
<p>could to keep the case relevant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing when you&rsquo;re working a murder, you really want to keep it, when you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have much to go on, you want to keep it in the public realm because you want people to</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we wanted, but like most homicides, this one may happen on Friday and you may</p>
<p>get two more on Saturday.</p>
<p>Not me as a detective, but in Denver.</p>
<p>And the media moves on, people move on, and we didn&rsquo;t want that to happen.</p>
<p>We wanted to keep this out front.</p>
<p>So, we had a meeting with K. Rue&rsquo;s family, and they said, you know, we&rsquo;re going to need</p>
<p>you to come back and we&rsquo;re going to need you to come back and we&rsquo;re going to need you to</p>
<p>We wanted to keep this out front.</p>
<p>The renewed media attention did draw out a few new tips from the public, most notably</p>
<p>a Crimestoppers tip.</p>
<p>They got a caller who said that they overheard someone they knew talking about the shooting.</p>
<p>The tipster didn&rsquo;t give much more information than that, but they did provide a nickname</p>
<p>for the person, which was enough for investigators to track him down.</p>
<p>But when detectives talked to this guy, he denied any involvement in the killing, or</p>
<p>knowing anything about it.</p>
<p>Investigators also talked to some of his friends and associates, and they agreed with what</p>
<p>the man said.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think he was involved.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know if the information the tipster provided was truthful.</p>
<p>Maybe they just want us to contact these folks.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Or whether the person was not being truthful.</p>
<p>But we have no reason to believe they were involved in it.</p>
<p>After that dead-end tip, the investigation lost momentum.</p>
<p>As the weeks crept by, Detective Kreider became more convinced of the mistaken identity</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>But the tips had stopped trickling in, and K. Roo&rsquo;s case went cold for years.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2012, the Ethiopian community in Denver had grown frustrated with the lack</p>
<p>of movement in the investigation.</p>
<p>So they kind of took matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>The community rallied together and used their own money to raise the reward in K. Roo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case from $2,000 to $10,000.</p>
<p>A billboard was put up a few blocks from the apartment complex where K. Roo was killed,</p>
<p>advertising the reward, and asking the question detectives, members of the community, and</p>
<p>K. Roo&rsquo;s friends and family had been pondering for the past three years.</p>
<p>Who killed K. Roo Lolo?</p>
<p>Everyone was hopeful that the billboard and the increased reward would encourage tips.</p>
<p>They just got radio silence in return.</p>
<p>Detective Kreider said no new leads were generated, despite their best efforts.</p>
<p>And sadly, that&rsquo;s where the case has stayed for the past decade.</p>
<p>These are the cases that you wake up at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning looking at your ceiling</p>
<p>thinking about.</p>
<p>Because again, K. Roo, he wasn&rsquo;t drug dealing.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t in a gang.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t doing robberies.</p>
<p>He was a 24-year-old kid that immigrated to this country for a better life.</p>
<p>And he gets killed at 1150 Syracuse in Denver.</p>
<p>Yeah, we owe it to him.</p>
<p>We owe it to his family.</p>
<p>We owe it to Denver.</p>
<p>K. Roo was in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s likely for that reason and nothing more that he lost his life.</p>
<p>But despite K. Roo&rsquo;s case remaining virtually motionless for the past 10 years, Detective</p>
<p>Kreider hasn&rsquo;t given up hope.</p>
<p>We need somebody to come forward.</p>
<p>There were too many people that called 911.</p>
<p>These apartments all have balconies.</p>
<p>It was a cool evening.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a cold evening.</p>
<p>You hear gunshots.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to look out your window.</p>
<p>All we&rsquo;re asking is just what you saw when you looked out your window.</p>
<p>And not just that.</p>
<p>People talk.</p>
<p>They tell friends.</p>
<p>They tell girlfriends, who now may be ex-girlfriends.</p>
<p>Anybody with any information on this, just call.</p>
<p>It can be anonymous.</p>
<p>Just give us the information.</p>
<p>This is an important case to us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important case to Denver.</p>
<p>It would be phenomenal.</p>
<p>It would be great to solve this case, obviously.</p>
<p>For K. Roo&rsquo;s family, for Ethiopian community, for the Denver community.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one phone call.</p>
<p>As an homicide detective, you love the phone call you get to make when you&rsquo;re first off</p>
<p>on murder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one phone call that I would really like to make.</p>
<p>You guys know that all of the cases I have covered on the deck have been heartbreaking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something particularly gut-wrenching about K. Roo&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>I mean, he wasn&rsquo;t bothering anyone.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t living a high-risk lifestyle, yet he was brutally gunned down, likely because</p>
<p>someone thought he was somebody else.</p>
<p>The person or people who killed K. Roo have enjoyed freedom for 13 years, not having to</p>
<p>face the consequences of stealing an innocent life.</p>
<p>K. Roo deserves justice, and his family deserves answers.</p>
<p>If you have any information about K. Roo Lolo&rsquo;s murder in 2009, call Crime Stoppers at 720-913-STOP.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 720-913-7867.</p>
<p>Callers can remain 100% anonymous, and there is currently a $10,000 reward being offered.</p>
