<p>It&rsquo;s hardcore history</p>
<p>Attention</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before that one of the wonderful side benefits of a gig like this is the chance to speak to people whose work</p>
<p>You really admire and talk to them about it. In this case. I have a guest on the program today who is a</p>
<p>Source somebody that we use in our work and when we did blueprint for Armageddon, he was sort of my</p>
<p>You know go-to guy in terms of somebody that I knew</p>
<p>Could add a different dimension to the storytelling by</p>
<p>having a letter or a document or a quote or something that was just</p>
<p>You know so visceral or perfect or emotional or that in one short little</p>
<p>Paragraph managed to capture such a poignant</p>
<p>You know point that just sort of made the whole, you know section of the piece. I mean Peter Hart&rsquo;s work is finding</p>
<p>Emotional nuggets that just knock you over and then incorporating them into the story in a way where they not</p>
<p>only have the most impact</p>
<p>But they manage to add a part of the story that often gets missed if you&rsquo;re telling for example a story on the First World</p>
<p>War which is Peter Hart&rsquo;s specialty</p>
<p>It is so easy to get yourself locked into the giant troop movements and the big decisions made at headquarters and all this</p>
<p>Sometimes you can go the total opposite extreme and it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the diary of this one</p>
<p>Soldier or this one nurse or something like that</p>
<p>But to be able to blend the two in a way that helps you understand for example</p>
<p>How the decisions made at headquarters with all those high muckety mucks thinking about things abstractly</p>
<p>How they you know influence and intersect with the lives of some poor guy</p>
<p>Mortally wounded in a shell hole writing his last letter back to his wife and family</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an art</p>
<p>And I think Peter Hart does it as well or better especially on the subject of the First World War than anyone I&rsquo;ve ever read</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you get to see me enjoying my</p>
<p>You know byproduct the best</p>
<p>Aspect of this gig the chance to talk to people whose work you admire people like Peter Hart</p>
<p>Who is amongst other things an oral historian by the way at the British Imperial War Museum</p>
<p>Which is every military history nuts dream gig</p>
<p>Love to go to work by a couple of giant 15-inch naval guns</p>
<p>Which one of those you know, they have several of these war museums, but the the main one in London has the big naval guns outside</p>
<p>You know, just take a picture. Here&rsquo;s where I work right eat your heart out</p>
<p>Anyway, one little note normally we have an in-house phone system we use when we do interviews</p>
<p>But normally we only use that for North American interviews when we&rsquo;re overseas</p>
<p>Calls we&rsquo;ve been using sort of an internet system and this time it let us down with some pretty serious glitches at times</p>
<p>Especially near the end of the interview not only my apologies to Peter Hart, but to you also</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating and there was no way for us to fix it</p>
<p>So I am going to put a couple of shall we call them end notes after the interview?</p>
<p>Where I both quote something that we we referenced in the show so that we include that</p>
<p>Explained something. Mr. Hart said at the end that the digital glitches did not make easy to understand</p>
<p>and also</p>
<p>Read a letter that we referenced in the story to something that Peter Hart</p>
<p>Uncovered for one of his books that we used in the blueprint for Armageddon series and reread that to just show you the man&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to</p>
<p>Demonstrate the ripples of pain</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something like this conflict</p>
<p>You know created in that era in those societies and drop you right into the middle of it for a minute</p>
<p>so without further ado the wonderful author and</p>
<p>Or a war historian may be a good way to put it the great Peter Hart</p>
<p>So the first thing I want to know because I&rsquo;m just curious as a person who is absolutely jealous of anyone who can find</p>
<p>Such a specialty to devote their lives to</p>
<p>How did it for you mostly become because you&rsquo;ve done other things but mostly become something about the first world war</p>
<p>What grabbed your interest about this and what is it that keeps you so interested in the subject?</p>
<p>Well, I think it I started when I was young and</p>
<p>There was a program called the Great War which was on telly in the 1960s</p>
<p>and it was gloomy and miserable and it seemed so awful that people suffered so much and</p>
<p>For me that it&rsquo;s always been that dichotomy. It&rsquo;s a dichotomy between the the people who suffered and</p>
<p>What the generals did and why they did that because you may or may not realize I quite support</p>
<p>The approach of the generals and it&rsquo;s the way that you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an entirely logical way of behaving</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s terrible for those that are involved and that has always</p>
<p>Informed or I hope has informed all the work I do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about for me now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been doing it long enough so that you&rsquo;ve been around to watch sort of how</p>
<p>Public perception over time on these events has changed because I remember I was born in</p>
<p>1965 and I remember in the United States growing up as a kid</p>
<p>There was a sense about the First World War that it was like the Second World War</p>
<p>But a little less in terms of the good and evil still the good and evil the Kaiser was evil, man</p>
<p>But not quite to Hitler&rsquo;s standards and then since I&rsquo;ve grown up that good evil aspect to the First World War has seemed to be</p>
<p>To fade over time quite a bit at least here in the United States</p>
<p>Have you noticed can you comment a little bit on the differences in the way, you know?</p>
<p>Barbara Tuchman writes a book years ago that that that Jack Kennedy reads that&rsquo;s really particularly hard on the Germans the stuff</p>
<p>I read today has a very different tone</p>
<p>What have you noticed in the change of if we were doing news?</p>
<p>We would say the coverage over the last say four decades of the First World War</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a fair amount of coverage</p>
<p>My perception has always been that in the end if there were baddies then it was the Germans</p>
<p>But that there were a lot of people doing things that were were difficult or wrong</p>
<p>There were four or five major</p>
<p>Empires that were struggling together trying to establish domination</p>
<p>a lot of them had agendas that we wouldn&rsquo;t particularly recognize as today as being</p>
<p>Pleasant or you know, the colonialism things like that</p>
<p>Their treatment of their colonies the way they generally behaved, you know through in everything and for me</p>
<p>We have now an acceptance that whilst the Germans</p>
<p>Pushed the war they were partly did that because they were being pushed by the the the Russians and the French and the French</p>
<p>Who had their own agendas and it&rsquo;s just become much more complicated</p>
<p>The thing is it&rsquo;s not easy. Is it you know, that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the problem with history</p>
<p>That when you add nuance things stop being good and evil start becoming just much more complex</p>
<p>Now one of the things you do so fantastically we try to do it here, too</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great if you can pull it off. It&rsquo;s a great way to do it</p>
<p>You pull it off all the time where you&rsquo;re able to take the reader from the macro, you know</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have us in the in the boardroom and you&rsquo;ll have quotes from assistants to the great</p>
<p>You know grand strategists who are deciding how to use troops on the battlefield and then all of a sudden you&rsquo;ll telescope down to some poor</p>
<p>combatant who&rsquo;s injured</p>
<p>Mortally in some shell hole who&rsquo;s writing a last letter to his wife and kids that he&rsquo;s gonna strap to his body</p>
<p>to find later</p>
<p>First of all, you know explain to the listener a little bit how you go about finding these materials</p>
<p>It would seem to me to be one of the luxuries of working in a you know, semi modern era</p>
<p>I mean the poor Roman historian has much less in the way of letters from combatants to go on but but you&rsquo;re able to mine</p>
<p>Emotionally mine this material out there. How do you find it?</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s as powerful as it is on the sterile text page as I&rsquo;m reading it</p>
<p>How much more powerful is it for you when you&rsquo;re holding the the actual stained letter in your hands?</p>
<p>well, I</p>
<p>That was in one of my books and I found a letter that was from a French soldier</p>
<p>Yeah that I used that but I am extremely lucky that I have been for the last 30 odd 35 years</p>
<p>The the oral historian at the Imperial War Museum</p>
<p>So I a did all the a lot not all at all</p>
<p>but I did a lot of the First World War interviews with veterans and that provided with a fantastic source which the war museums allowed</p>
<p>me to use and secondly, I have worked closely with the Department of Documents there and</p>
<p>Just opening the dusty old folders that they&rsquo;re all cataloged and preserved by the staff</p>
<p>But you know you open these and you no idea what you&rsquo;re going to find and sometimes it can be utterly tedious</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just letter after letter or boring, you know, no, no and then suddenly you get someone something</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really visceral that that tears you apart that you know</p>
<p>You just get letters that you realize these are the last letters</p>
<p>They that you know, you&rsquo;ve been reading this bloke&rsquo;s life and suddenly suddenly it&rsquo;s not his letter</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a letter from his commanding officer and you know, it it&rsquo;s amazing and I</p>
<p>Just think I&rsquo;m very lucky to work at the War Museum from that</p>
<p>I then look through lots of other sources. I go to other museums. I go to other places. And of course, I look at personal experience</p>
<p>books</p>
<p>mainly old ones</p>
<p>But like I use quite a few modern ones of the you know</p>
<p>Or regimental histories often have it buried inside them personal experience accounts, you know</p>
<p>the Americans are picked up a lot from the internet where the PDFs of</p>
<p>The books from 1920s are online and you can consult them it&rsquo;s fabulous and and that&rsquo;s where I get the material</p>
<p>And yes, it can be you know, the actual real letters that I see at the museum can be really painful</p>
<p>You know, obviously humans are humans at ground zero</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re reading and you focus mostly on on the British side of the experience, but you cover everything</p>
<p>Do you notice any broad broad differences in?</p>
<p>Say you&rsquo;re reading something from ground zero from a French soldier or some German soldier on the line versus some British or American</p>
<p>Soldier, are there any differences in terms of the way that their national characteristics sort of come through in the material or at ground zero?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re sitting in a trench with artillery falling all around you. Are we are we broadly the same? I</p>
<p>Very much go for broadly the same. I think I&rsquo;m not a great believer in national characteristics</p>
<p>Anyway, you know, it can help sometimes as a shorthand to explain certain things</p>
<p>But if you take it to literally it goes into dark alleys</p>
<p>What what I really think though is that underneath human beings when they&rsquo;re placed under real pressure</p>
<p>Tend to respond in it&rsquo;s in a similar sort of way and for me a French soldier that the accounts</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I have to translate which can be difficult. I&rsquo;m not great a</p>
<p>friend of mine translated the German ones for me because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know speak or read German and</p>
<p>Fundamentally, they&rsquo;re the same. They have slightly different ways of expressing themselves</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just cultural but underneath when the shells are falling when their friends are killed</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re given orders that could lead them to be killed</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same sort of people. They are us, you know</p>
<p>They are they&rsquo;re just ordinary people, you know</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s maybe one of the things that at least I mean I imagine touches many people once they start</p>
<p>You know reading about the war is these these incidents where you know</p>
<p>The comradeship may be the German soldiers would say but we&rsquo;re the soldiers of multiple sides who you know</p>
<p>More and more modern histories will talk about how prisoners would be killed sometimes and all the horrors of war and yet at the same time</p>
<p>You know the notions when these people end up having truces where they you know, share Christmas decorations or play</p>
<p>Football as you guys would call it soccer</p>
<p>We would call it or or any of the many many incidents like that getting stuck in a shell hole with someone from the other</p>
<p>side in your latest book</p>
<p>There was a a primary source quote where a British soldier had his arm really badly injured and goes marching to the back</p>
<p>With a bunch of German prisoners who start doctoring his wounds</p>
<p>Do you notice I mean I don&rsquo;t see as much of that and it might be part of the historiography or what-have-you part of</p>
<p>Myth-making but when I read stuff in the Second World War, I find a lot less of that than in the First World War</p>
<p>Anything in on the front of your mind that might account for the difference there or am I just imagining that there is one?</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re imagine it</p>
<p>there is</p>
<p>There was more hatred in the Second World War. I think and</p>
<p>We all it&rsquo;s only our opinions from the things we&rsquo;ve read and but I I&rsquo;ve interviewed an awful lot of second</p>
<p>More Second World War soldiers and first world war soldiers and there is more hatred there</p>
<p>Because of the nature of the regime they&rsquo;re fighting now</p>
<p>The communist regime was in Russia was pretty rough as well</p>
<p>But but there was a hatred of the Nazis, but very rarely in any war. There are not many soldiers</p>
<p>that that that that respond</p>
<p>With murder and torture and the rest of it most of them in my experience</p>
<p>main maintain a lid on their emotions and and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s there but there are a few who do respond with</p>
<p>acts of</p>
<p>Well, just murder, you know, or or panic often. It&rsquo;s panic that triggered triggers the murder</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>The First World War that that you mentioned it first up comradeship is the thing that binds the armies together</p>
<p>But most of all it binds it binds you to your fellow soldiers, that&rsquo;s what helps you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what lets you go over the top. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>King and country or president. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not religion what in the end when it all comes down to it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly the blokes you with your mates the men who you went through training with who faced death with you</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what helps you to get through it</p>
<p>you know, you mentioned something going over the top a minute ago such an iconic way of</p>
<p>Differentiating the at least Western Front experience of this war from all the others and you know</p>
<p>It occurs to me that because of sort of the nature of technology and the way things have gone</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ever going to get the same experience that those First World War soldiers went through</p>
<p>Ever again, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ever gonna have</p>
<p>Hundreds and hundreds or thousands of guns peppering a small space of territory anymore</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to because of the accuracy. You&rsquo;re never gonna mix them with gas the way you did</p>
<p>I mean if you think as I do that that would have been you know</p>
<p>Equal to the worst place a soldier could have ever been right front of the line about to go over the top Western Front</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ever going to get that experience again. You&rsquo;re never gonna have human beings</p>
<p>Watch I think I forgot the the author who had said one of the soldiers described watching a forest</p>
<p>Disappear in front of his eyes due to artillery</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a human experience that I don&rsquo;t think any human beings gonna ever see again in</p>
<p>The beginning of the Second World War Churchill&rsquo;s history of the war. He talked about what was in store in</p>
<p>1919 if the war hadn&rsquo;t ended in 1918 the various, you know</p>
<p>Horrible concoctions that the Allies had put together your latest book. The last battle is from that era</p>
<p>Can you talk a little bit about what?</p>
<p>1919 on the front might have looked like</p>
<p>The I mean the British had a the Germans had a blue cross gas</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work properly a mixture of a pernicious gas and a sort of particles</p>
<p>The particles made you vomit so you had to take your gas mask off and then the gas, you know</p>
<p>The poisonous gas got you now the German version didn&rsquo;t work properly</p>
<p>But the British had worked out and their allies by the way had worked out how to do it and they</p>
<p>Fully intended to poison most of the German army in this in 1919</p>
<p>It is a vicious war and and the practices in a way that was just one step forward</p>
<p>you know that the</p>
<p>Because we sort of moved on then it was mass barrages</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s no need for mass barrages now and although we did revert to it after El Alamein</p>
<p>For instance has one they have them on the in 1944 on the West on the in Europe</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s replaced by mass bombing, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>and then of course as a nuclear method and then it&rsquo;s accuracy and so technology moves on and</p>
<p>But the killing can still be on a mass scale for instance in the Iraq war</p>
<p>There was mass killing the Gulf War mass killing of and it needs to be remembered</p>
<p>What happens is the mass killing tends not to be on our side anymore, you know</p>
<p>So that that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Pretty well how I feel about it</p>
<p>Well, it is interesting too because when we were talking about the First World War in the series that we did on it</p>
<p>You know you you you almost want to overwhelm the listener with both the casualty</p>
<p>Statistics and then the the amounts I mean the sheer numbers of things like shells. I mean the numbers overwhelm you</p>
<p>You know, we a lot of Americans</p>
<p>For example, they like to tell jokes about the French and surrendering in the Second World War</p>
<p>And so you would like to point out. Hey, wait a minute, you know, when did our side ever take?</p>
<p>27,000 dead in a single day, you know, those kind of numbers are so overwhelming that in the United States, you know</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of memorials to the First World War and all this but you go to Europe and they are everywhere</p>
<p>Can you talk a little bit about sort of the lasting effect?</p>
<p>I mean the the the feeling of connection to the First World War never died down in Europe. Did it?</p>
<p>Not really. Well for the French and Germans, it was</p>
<p>Monstrously painful business. I mean their casualties are much higher than the British the French in particular. You&rsquo;re right. That&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in August</p>
<p>1914 the French lost</p>
<p>27,000 dead in a single day now the British whinge on about suffering. I think 600 dead</p>
<p>at Mons</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different scale and the French sack and the French then fought almost on their own</p>
<p>For two or three years people say the Americans took a long time to get into the war, you know from April 1917 to</p>
<p>to well properly June July</p>
<p>1918</p>
<p>1917 yes, or 1917 to 198 so a bit over a year</p>
<p>But the British took from August 1914 to the Somme July on the Somme before we were properly involved</p>
<p>You know that people often forget when they&rsquo;re throwing stones at other countries</p>
<p>They forget like we sometimes do it the Americans or the Americans or the French or the British or the French?</p>
<p>When you look at your own side, we often have the same sort of problems or the same</p>
<p>faults</p>
<p>And I find that but it&rsquo;s one of those interesting things</p>
<p>The American losses were dreadful in the the First World War war that they suffered a very high rate of losses</p>
<p>From when they fully joined the battle of the battle</p>
<p>In the are they are gone. The Mers Argonne region is murderous</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as murderous as any other battle in the First World War and</p>
<p>Considering that they only really fought full pelt for three months the American casualties are worth remembering</p>
<p>but but for one reason another</p>
<p>Possibly because they disengaged them from from Europe a bit in and in the interwar years. The Americans have never really</p>
<p>Remembered it in the same way as we do</p>
<p>Yes, I always try to imagine if the u.s. Had fought for two years at those kind of casualty rates</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;d have a few more war memorials around here. You certainly would you know, I think about</p>
<p>Context, you know if history teaches anything it helps us understand how things get to where they are and in this country once again</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ll try to use in political discussions the lessons of history, right?</p>
<p>We know from the 1938 appeasement stuff that you can&rsquo;t do this or that or the other thing</p>
<p>You know the classic misuse of the lessons of history</p>
<p>but I always try to and I&rsquo;m gonna ask you for your opinion on this because you&rsquo;ve read a lot of stuff the</p>
<p>Generation that gets accused of really doing anything they could to avoid another world war are the ones that lived through it as younger</p>
<p>People how did that scar the leadership on on you know?</p>
<p>Both sides really in the Second World War as they sort of maneuvered</p>
<p>Jockeyed</p>
<p>threatened tried to avoid via compromise a</p>
<p>Repetition of the worst thing any of them had ever lived through. I</p>
<p>Think there&rsquo;s some truth in now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on the interwar years, but certainly that there was peace movements in Britain and for the French</p>
<p>Were pretty broken by their awful experiences, you know</p>
<p>Petain is the one that gets most of the the blame for what happened</p>
<p>But he was responding to a popular element within the country. I cut that. They just were not willing to suffer it all again</p>
<p>I have so much sympathy for them less that the Germans of course also</p>
<p>But that that you just have less sympathy for them so man</p>
<p>That the British, you know, it took a while for us to get properly into the war</p>
<p>I mean even in the the Second World War</p>
<p>The the phony war and then you know that there&rsquo;s a people were trying to get that there was an appeasement movement in</p>
<p>Britain right until Churchill took over and Churchill for all his faults was the one that finally pinned the British</p>
<p>Into into opposing Nazi Germany in the long term</p>
<p>Because there were elements in British society that were perfectly happy to do a deal with Hitler</p>
<p>It</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a complex period which I am NOT an expert on at all</p>
<p>Your latest book called the last battle focuses on you know from a military history standpoint</p>
<p>I think one of the most fascinating periods in the First World War</p>
<p>But it seems to get lost in the Verdun&rsquo;s and the Psalms and the Passchendaele&rsquo;s and all that</p>
<p>Talk a little bit about that era where we go away from the iconic Western front of a stalemate on the front</p>
<p>to open movement again and something that looks like a you know prototype for</p>
<p>1939 warfare</p>
<p>It certainly is</p>
<p>It I mean everything changes with the it&rsquo;s the Allies come up with the all-arms battle, which is basically</p>
<p>Finding all the different weapons the artillery the gas the mass machine gun fire the tanks the airplanes</p>
<p>That the light machine guns that you know, the mortars everything together working together with</p>
<p>To overwhelm anything Germans could do to break through but also it&rsquo;s the different that not just attacking on one place</p>
<p>Like at the Somme or pressure but to attack four attacks four battles four days</p>
<p>the Americans go first that then the British and the Canadians then and then the French the Belgians and the British and then</p>
<p>Finally the British again and the French four battles four days</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pushing the Germans now the reason it&rsquo;s missed out and normally books finish round about the 8th of August my own book on</p>
<p>1918 a very British victory, which was a bit of a joke title. I have to admit I don&rsquo;t know why I did that</p>
<p>I I have got a sense of humor, which does come out at times</p>
<p>Possibly naughtily and the point was that</p>
<p>You sort of your publisher if they say right we&rsquo;ve had enough of them going over the top now</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you tend to miss out even that book by me, you know</p>
<p>Misses out the last six weeks of the war and I wanted to put that right with this because there are so many</p>
<p>Enormous battles open warfare comes and open warfare is worse. The casualty figures get higher</p>
<p>Much higher because because you&rsquo;re in the open if something goes wrong</p>
<p>You know Haig orders the British to go forward to push through in a very modern fashion push through ignore</p>
<p>Isolated pockets of resistance they&rsquo;ll be dealt with but if you&rsquo;re an infantry soldier and you go past an isolated pocket of resistance</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get killed and your mates will as well because they&rsquo;ll fire into your flanks as you go by so it&rsquo;s efficient</p>
<p>Militarily, but it leads to huge casualties</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a painful time for the British and for the Americans who are learning at the same time and</p>
<p>Anyone anyone who has insults the American?</p>
<p>The courage of the American troops</p>
<p>Only in the Argonne Mers battles is is mad</p>
<p>Because if you insult them you&rsquo;re insulting the British on the Somme and you&rsquo;re insulting the French in 1914</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re insulting basically armies that don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen to them</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t had chance to learn and that I think you don&rsquo;t learn this until you get right into the end of the war because</p>
<p>The Americans don&rsquo;t really get into the war until until September there about September 26</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when their war really starts when they attack, you know</p>
<p>The Argonne Forest what a place, you know, I&rsquo;ve been there. It&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>You know you mentioned earlier and you just sort of open the door to it again</p>
<p>One of the one of the aspects one of the opinions one of the points of views on this subject that you&rsquo;re kind of known</p>
<p>For you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d put you and I guess you would put yourself in the camp of those who look at for example the performance of the generals</p>
<p>Which of course famously some compared to you know, butchery to if I could I could sum it up maybe</p>
<p>Doing pretty well considering what a natural learning curve on on a big</p>
<p>Technological revolution in military affairs like this one might be</p>
<p>Is that fair to say that you think that they&rsquo;ve done a pretty good job all things considered?</p>
<p>spot-on</p>
<p>particularly some of the more advanced French and British general and I</p>
<p>Stand by Haig and I know it makes me unpopular in some places the thing about Haig was he was</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think of him as a general think of him as a chief executive of a massive American Corporation</p>
<p>someone who who provides</p>
<p>Direction someone who brings things together someone who enables and makes things happen</p>
<p>If you think of him that way you&rsquo;re getting a much better idea of what he was</p>
<p>He was a commander-in-chief of five armies. There is no such thing in</p>
<p>In in the Second World War, I mean, you know each I mean there was people who are supreme commanders</p>
<p>But they had people to deal with politicians people to deal with their allies. That doesn&rsquo;t happen in the First World War</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just Haig who has to deal with all of them and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works and they did come up and but when I it&rsquo;s not Haig comes up with it</p>
<p>But he enables the system which allows the all-arms battle to function and can I just what it&rsquo;s not a learning curve</p>
<p>What it is is two big dippers side-by-side</p>
<p>once the Allies or the British if you were to look at it narrowly British or Americans and then the other side is the</p>
<p>Germans and for every new attacking method you bring in the Germans bring in a defensive method</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a curve you go up and you go down and something that works on Tuesday</p>
<p>It might not work next Thursday because the Germans will have changed their tactics</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an analogy not an exact time frame obviously, but what I mean is it&rsquo;s constantly changing</p>
<p>So stay in 1915 one trench line, perhaps one and a half then later in that year</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three trench lines by the year afterwards. There&rsquo;s three trench systems and then redoubts soon after that</p>
<p>You start to get the pillboxes the underground block houses where the troops can be kept safe</p>
<p>You get different machine gun tactics</p>
<p>So the Germans are constantly changing now we change as well British bring in tanks. Are they great not first, but they&rsquo;re part of it</p>
<p>different tactics</p>
<p>Different infantry tactics. So both sides are changing and hence if you think of two big dippers</p>
<p>I think you call them something else in America, but you know</p>
<p>the little railway lines going up and down hills and running side by side and</p>
<p>You find out who&rsquo;s gonna win a battle by where you are in</p>
<p>Relation to the other side hence on the psalm first of the psalm first day of the psalm</p>
<p>1916 we&rsquo;re very low down there the Germans have got great trench systems great weapons of defense and we</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re inexperienced. We don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>But all told by the end of the war, we really have learnt and we&rsquo;re at a very high ebb</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking down on the Germans</p>
<p>But it is a complex system that the I think Gordon Corrigan a British historian once said it wasn&rsquo;t the generals</p>
<p>That killed our boys. It was the Germans and it&rsquo;s the same for your American lads. It&rsquo;s the Germans that did it and</p>
<p>When we try and blame just our generals or just our senior officers or blame our allies, you&rsquo;re not understanding what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re fighting a very complex war against the best army in the world</p>
<p>One of the biggest army in the world the Germans you wrote in your book that modern warfare was just so damn</p>
<p>complicated at every level</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about that for a minute because it seems to me and I and you know</p>
<p>Obviously there were there were earlier wars where these changes happened</p>
<p>But so slowly that they may not have been important</p>
<p>It seems to me that the First World War is the first one where we get that very modern</p>
<p>sort of sense where</p>
<p>Technology is changing so quickly</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re going to have to learn the lessons of this war and adapt for the next war</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to learn the lessons of today&rsquo;s air combat</p>
<p>For example so that in six months you have the newest discovery or the other side is going to shoot your people out of the air</p>
<p>Now in the Second World War you saw this this this dynamic going on all the time. What&rsquo;s the latest tank?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the latest version of the airplane?</p>
<p>But in the First World War it seems like that&rsquo;s the first time that that needing to learn on the fly and adapt during the conflict</p>
<p>Becomes while a war winning or a war losing potentially thing</p>
<p>Absolutely, and it&rsquo;s so quick</p>
<p>I mean the aircraft that took before the Battle of the Somme the aircraft that took that one control of the air over the Somme</p>
<p>were British and</p>
<p>there were things like the dh2 the</p>
<p>You know the the Fe to be the the stop with one half strut up by God</p>
<p>There were names to conjure with them</p>
<p>Campbell&rsquo;s</p>
<p>17 that&rsquo;s later, but they they took control</p>
<p>They they were outclassed totally by the Albatross just three months later three months now people like me</p>
<p>Still think that the you know, the Hawker Harrier is a decent aircraft</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 1950s technology that flew in the 60s 70s and 80s and has been outdated now for best part of 10 years</p>
<p>Then it was months just months and you could be flying an aircraft. That was great</p>
<p>And now is useless. In fact, it&rsquo;s a deathtrap when you meet something better and and I find and I think that</p>
<p>there is a</p>
<p>Warfare as a catalyst for change you get generals or people like generals who define a need and then you get</p>
<p>Scientists who who do the thinking who work out the theory of how to meet that need and then you have you know</p>
<p>You have the practical men now that they&rsquo;re engineers. They&rsquo;re practical soldiers and they work out how to actually do it</p>
<p>You know how to fix that camera to an airplane, you know how to you know</p>
<p>Somebody else works out the focal lengths and everything else</p>
<p>But you know someone has to work it out you get the theory of a synchronization machine</p>
<p>So you can shoot through the propeller or not through the propeller if you see what I mean that</p>
<p>The theory is very well and good, but you need practical men to make it work and warfare</p>
<p>Drives along technological change a bit like in the 60s if I might suggest</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s not my subject a bit like the Space Race did the same, you know driving along technological change</p>
<p>Because someone&rsquo;s defined a very real need</p>
<p>Well, and then to bowtie this with what we just talked about and then somebody from the military hierarchy has to figure out how it all</p>
<p>Fits together</p>
<p>Operationally and if you&rsquo;re the CEO like you said and a guy like Douglas Haig</p>
<p>You have to remember that it&rsquo;s a guy who has to factor in all this what we would call today high-tech stuff</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s a cavalry officer born in the mid 19th century?</p>
<p>Yep, he was but he learned he was known as the educated soldier. He was an in there</p>
<p>I mean you read it you can find a quote for everything if you look through things, so you&rsquo;ll find you know</p>
<p>But he was a an enthusiast from machine guns a in fact if Haig has a problem a problem</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s often too keen on new weapons</p>
<p>You know, he he</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t realize well not that he doesn&rsquo;t realize but sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t appreciate</p>
<p>That that that you have to bed them in there&rsquo;s no point building</p>
<p>300 tanks and sending them forward if you don&rsquo;t know how to drive them, which we didn&rsquo;t in 1916</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only 1917</p>
<p>We knew how they worked how that how to use them in action how to fit them in into the all-arms battle</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s going on is very like</p>
<p>It may be a British term or it may be an American term that we now use</p>
<p>But Haig would not have recognized this term, but best practice, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>All the time the British Army is engaging in something called best practice</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t know what that meant, but they they look at a battle what worked what didn&rsquo;t best practice</p>
<p>They then disseminate in a series of pamphlets called the SS unfortunately with our perspective but SS pamphlets</p>
<p>And those pamphlets how to do this how to use a tank in battle how to use a Lewis machine guns how to make an attack</p>
<p>How to do this how to do that and this this is just you know</p>
<p>This is just the stuff of modern warfare and it takes staff officers</p>
<p>It takes generals and it takes someone like Haig at the top to coordinate it. He&rsquo;s not a genius</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not Napoleon. He&rsquo;s probably not even Wellington</p>
<p>but what he is is a driven individual who whose mind for one reason or another is it&rsquo;s a perfect staff officer mind a</p>
<p>combination of detail drive and the the guts to set a direction, you know a</p>
<p>Direction which is painful to many of the men who served for him when you&rsquo;re reading the histories, too</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s so funny because and you know Churchill&rsquo;s a perfect example of someone who will push this but you mentioned it with Haig</p>
<p>too where you can see that the best way to use this new technology is to sort of surprise the other side with it and</p>
<p>Benefit from the shock value</p>
<p>But as you just pointed out</p>
<p>The problem is is that you don&rsquo;t know how to use it until you&rsquo;ve used it a few times and then by then of course</p>
<p>The Germans have started responding with countermeasures and whatnot</p>
<p>I mean remember was it Churchill talked about using the</p>
<p>Tanks when they first appeared in little pin pricks as opposed to some giant battle where a thousand of them overwhelmed the front</p>
<p>But as you pointed out if that was the first time you ever really employed them, would it have been effective at all?</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;d like to take. Yes. That&rsquo;s a great exam because the foot the 15th of September is the first tank attack</p>
<p>Three quarters and broke. I&rsquo;m rubbish at statistics. I&rsquo;m not that kind of history</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just take the broad brush three quarters of the war two-thirds of them broke down and never got to the front</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d left gaps in the barrage</p>
<p>The the creeping barrage which run forward in front of the infantry for the tanks when they weren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>The infantry didn&rsquo;t have any artillery support in front of them. They got lost they had at the</p>
<p>Wheels because they thought they needed wheels at the back to steer them</p>
<p>They had no idea how to communicate between themselves and the infantry when they go into action</p>
<p>To be absolutely honest. There are several several historians</p>
<p>Cynical historians who think the tanks probably killed more British troops and German troops that day now that is more</p>
<p>What we call an outlier, you know, it&rsquo;s more just a point rather than a serious remark, but the point</p>
<p>Is</p>
<p>What he had the slightest how to use the tanks in action and we didn&rsquo;t have until Combray</p>
<p>you know, which is which is</p>
<p>1978 in</p>
<p>1917 a year and a couple of months later</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;d sent a thousand tanks as they were on the 15th of September 1916 over the top it would have been a disaster</p>
<p>Sorry, no, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s okay and we&rsquo;re getting us some glitches on this end, which is not wonderful</p>
<p>Um, so talk to me talk to me a little bit if you could about the the difference that four years has made by the time</p>
<p>This book that you put out now the last battle is focusing on this the governments of all these countries are</p>
<p>Fundamentally transformed. I mean Russia Imperial Russia&rsquo;s gone by this time</p>
<p>Austria-Hungary is shattered and looking for a way out of the war behind the scenes</p>
<p>You know France has endured some serious troop morale problems in the not-too-distant past</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s traditionally like the finest army in the world and</p>
<p>Britain has gone from the greatest creditor nation to one that is transferring their debt to New York now</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between the armies of</p>
<p>1914 and the governments that support them versus these armies of early</p>
<p>1918 and the governments that support and direct them</p>
<p>Well, the 1914 armies would have been recognizable by Napoleon the tactics the way they were used</p>
<p>Would have been recognizable from Napoleon from a hundred years before</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got modern weapons, but they had no idea how to use them. The governments were old-fashioned governments</p>
<p>I mean, I know Britain best, but so I&rsquo;ll use him them as an example</p>
<p>Lloyd George is very very different from from from Asquith the</p>
<p>Who led the government Asquith is?</p>
<p>Not particularly competent. He&rsquo;s a polite old gentleman drinks far too much squiffy</p>
<p>Asquith Lloyd George has many many faults</p>
<p>in fact, I&rsquo;d need a few more many&rsquo;s to really encompasses many faults, but he is</p>
<p>Driven and you don&rsquo;t have to hate Lloyd George just because you like</p>
<p>Hey, they they were they they were chalk and cheese, but they both did their bit Lloyd George was a classic war leader</p>
<p>He provided civilian direction his idea of what to do with soldiers was madness</p>
<p>And he he did not help the direction of the war on a strategic level</p>
<p>But on a sort of global level he provided the drive but Britain was running out of money</p>
<p>It was running out of resources</p>
<p>It was running out of troops and and and it was running out of time the war had to be finished in</p>
<p>18 and that&rsquo;s one thing that Haig realized he was desperate to finish the war not to give the Germans another</p>
<p>You know chance to provide to dig another set of trench lines</p>
<p>shortened perhaps save from</p>
<p>MERS, that&rsquo;s what they really Hague and posh both feared that they had to get them the war finished</p>
<p>For</p>
<p>You they said it had a revolution we know there wasn&rsquo;t a revolution in France</p>
<p>We know there wasn&rsquo;t one in Britain, but they could have been and people were very aware of that</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Those governments that would have made it into</p>
<p>1919 if the war were continuing might have had problems on the Allied side to not just the the central powers</p>
<p>Absolutely</p>
<p>War weariness, I mean, it&rsquo;s just ink, you know, it was an incredible</p>
<p>There was no money. There&rsquo;s no men</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s depressed it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s just you know an awful thing to be involved in</p>
<p>and countries were struggling and we needed Lloyd George to provide the leadership at the center and and the</p>
<p>Determination to fight on to make sure that it would be beaten</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so easy just to give up to just say well, we&rsquo;ll come to some compromise</p>
<p>but leaders like Lloyd George would not accept that I</p>
<p>Think that&rsquo;s everything I mean did I is there something about the new book that I didn&rsquo;t ask you about</p>
<p>That that is worth pointing out. I mean I I&rsquo;m with you</p>
<p>I find it not just fascinating but it&rsquo;s a little like</p>
<p>Discovering that a band and you thought you&rsquo;d heard every song from them had a whole bunch of songs</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know about and they&rsquo;re bigger and more interesting than you ever knew</p>
<p>Other than not being able to pronounce all of the battlefields and the wonderful in that wonderful last push in France</p>
<p>What about that last book have we not talked about that you think is is especially compelling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what the the thing for me is it&rsquo;s an emotional response at which I think you&rsquo;ll appreciate it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the essence of the book if you&rsquo;ve been fighting for four years say you&rsquo;re a soldier in those trenches</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been fighting for four years and just as you start to think it&rsquo;s coming to an end</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming to then and then you you</p>
<p>Have to go forward you have to go into the attack and not everybody</p>
<p>Do what you recognize from second world war? It&rsquo;s called shell hole dropping. You can&rsquo;t all drop out, you know, you can&rsquo;t all</p>
<p>Fall back keep keep behind</p>
<p>You just have to keep going with your mates</p>
<p>And the temptation to shirk in those final attacks in the final days must have been enormous but somehow most</p>
<p>found from somewhere the inner resolve which which people like me just can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>Grasp or understand because it&rsquo;s beyond our experience to finish the job</p>
<p>Do you know it was the worst of all for that and i&rsquo;m not just saying this because you&rsquo;re american the world</p>
<p>Worst of all was they as pershing forced the final attacks on the then the night of the 10th 11th and even the morning</p>
<p>Uh of the 11th and and you know, the americans had nearly 3 000 casualties. I&rsquo;m rubbish</p>
<p>On that final 24 hours and just imagine what was going through their heads when they were told</p>
<p>I mean the marines that were told they had to cross the mers, you know</p>
<p>100 foot wide river with</p>
<p>Germans with machine guns on the other side and just I mean</p>
<p>What went through their heads and and that&rsquo;s the last thing i&rsquo;d like to say about just just put yourself there and think about it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like your book so much because you do such a great job of giving me the chance to do that</p>
<p>Listen, we&rsquo;ll try to sell you a few books this time</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll come on the next time you have one and I hope you&rsquo;ll write a bunch more</p>
<p>Thank you very much. I&rsquo;d love to i&rsquo;ve really enjoyed it. Thank you</p>
<p>I had a great time too. Like I said meeting heroes take care and thank you so much. Thank you</p>
<p>So again, my apologies for the digital glitches there. I will try to figure out a better method</p>
<p>I do want to encourage you if you are a fan or interested in the first world war to get mr</p>
<p>Hart&rsquo;s books. The great war is absolutely a classic</p>
<p>His one on the naval battle of jutland in 1916 follows the same pattern</p>
<p>with his um</p>
<p>Context punctuated by oral historian quotes. It works so well</p>
<p>Uh, he wrote one on passendale</p>
<p>Um, which is you know, as you know, probably awful muddy horrible bloody, um</p>
<p>symbolic of the whole war at that stage and then the new book, of course the last battle which focuses on the</p>
<p>less well-known</p>
<p>But murderous time period in the war the phase of the first world war where everyone got out of the trenches and started moving again</p>
<p>And began to take the kind of casualties that reminded them why they first dug into the ground in the first place</p>
<p>Now as an addendum</p>
<p>A couple of things worth noting first of all at the very end of the conversation with mr</p>
<p>Hart, he was talking about pershing and he was saying things like, you know on the 10th or even on the 11th</p>
<p>You know, he was launching these offensives</p>
<p>Just a little explanation</p>
<p>the 10th and the 11th or the november 10th and november 11th 1918 the day before and the day of the</p>
<p>End of the war the armistice taking effect. Everybody knew</p>
<p>That you know at this hour on this day, we&rsquo;re gonna stop shooting so everybody knew okay the war ends tomorrow or the war ends today</p>
<p>So how much does it bother you?</p>
<p>As a soldier in the trenches, well, maybe not even in the trenches at that point leaning up against a broken down</p>
<p>Old french brick house in a ruined french building behind a tank as you&rsquo;re prepared to move forward to find out</p>
<p>That your general wants to launch an offensive that&rsquo;s going to cost a lot of your lives in the last 24 hours of the war</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what he was talking about</p>
<p>You might think in your head of reasons why a general might want to do something like that and play with your own</p>
<p>motivations for a minute</p>
<p>Now the other thing I wanted to quote was we had mentioned</p>
<p>That in the beginning of his famous series on the second world war you can&rsquo;t even call it a history</p>
<p>You should call it almost like a personal account</p>
<p>from a participant</p>
<p>But churchill&rsquo;s history of the second world war has a wonderful start to it where he kind of talks about</p>
<p>He sort of picks up at the end of the first world war which when you think about it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bad way to write the histories and he talks about</p>
<p>You know the war ending when it did and what was going to happen if it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>right what what the plan was for</p>
<p>1919 and of course the war ends in 1918, right?</p>
<p>But but churchill says if 1919 happened, you know, it was going to unleash</p>
<p>terrors unlike you know any the world had ever seen</p>
<p>Churchill writes quote</p>
<p>But all that happened in the four years of the great war was only a prelude to what was preparing for the fifth year</p>
<p>The campaign of the year 1919 would have witnessed an immense accession to the powers of destruction</p>
<p>Had the germans retained the morale to make good their retreat to the rhine</p>
<p>They would have been assaulted in the summer of 1919</p>
<p>With forces and by methods incomparably more prodigious than any yet employed</p>
<p>Thousands of airplanes would have shattered their cities</p>
<p>Scores of thousands of cannon would have blasted their front arrangements were being made to carry simultaneously</p>
<p>a quarter of a million men together with all their requirements</p>
<p>Continuously forward across country in mechanical vehicles moving 10 or 15 miles each day</p>
<p>poison gases of incredible malignity</p>
<p>Against which only a secret mask which the germans could not obtain in time was proof</p>
<p>Would have stifled all resistance and paralyzed all life on the hostile front subjected to attack</p>
<p>No doubt the germans too had their plans</p>
<p>But the hour of wrath had passed the signal of relief was given and the horrors of</p>
<p>1919 remained buried in the archives of the great antagonists</p>
<p>end quote</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that even with the terrible and horrible destruction of the second world war</p>
<p>There were some of the horrors of the first that were not revisited</p>
<p>Which seems counterintuitive to human history, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>This idea that in total war</p>
<p>Human beings would use every single weapon at their disposal, you know to fend off total destruction</p>
<p>Yet those leaders in the second world war who themselves were younger people who fought in the first and who experienced that</p>
<p>Somehow managed to not use</p>
<p>poison gas again on a wide scale for example</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what conclusions you can draw from that, but it&rsquo;s an interesting variable to consider, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Finally we had mentioned a uh a note specifically that had stuck in my mind and it obviously stuck in um,</p>
<p>peter hart&rsquo;s mind too</p>
<p>From a soldier that was writing his uh turns out to be last note home to his family</p>
<p>And it it exemplifies the way hart tends to work where he will</p>
<p>Write a piece that sets up this emotional</p>
<p>exclamation point and then deliver it to you</p>
<p>And it just stayed we used it in blueprint for armageddon because it is so emotionally powerful</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what hart writes. He&rsquo;s talking about this battle at the psalm, which he referenced in the interview that terrible british</p>
<p>Day where they figured out. Oh my gosh, you know</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t working the way we thought meanwhile</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to figure it out in the open under machine gun fire behind a lot of barbed wire</p>
<p>And he says that the soldiers about to go on this attack</p>
<p>Would write these letters home to their families</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what he says and then he quotes the powerful letter</p>
<p>He says and this is from his book the great war by the way quote</p>
<p>The final reports from the front meaning of the psalm battle that filtered back to the british high command were generally positive in tone</p>
<p>Overall, the visual impression of the barrage proved far more devastating than the truth on the ground</p>
<p>British progress had been more than discounted by german improvements in their defenses</p>
<p>But that was not known at the time on the british side of the wire in any case</p>
<p>They had no choice. The offensive had to go ahead as the future of the alliance with france depended on it</p>
<p>In the last few hours as haig&rsquo;s men prepared for the ordeal many wrote their sad last letters home</p>
<p>One was so beautifully expressed that it exemplifies the feelings of men</p>
<p>Trapped and tormented by the conflicting calls of country and family now. He&rsquo;s quoting an original letter quote</p>
<p>I must not allow myself to dwell on the personal there&rsquo;s no room for it here. Also. It is demoralizing</p>
<p>But I do not want to die</p>
<p>Not that I mind for myself</p>
<p>If it be that I am to go I am ready</p>
<p>But the thought that I may never see you or our darling baby again turns my bowels to water</p>
<p>I cannot think of it with even the semblance of equanimity</p>
<p>My one consolation is the happiness that has been ours</p>
<p>Also, my conscience is clear that i&rsquo;ve always tried to make life a joy to you</p>
<p>I know at least that if I go you will not want that is something</p>
<p>But it is the thought that we may be cut off from one another which is so terrible</p>
<p>And that our babe may grow up without my knowing her and without her knowing me</p>
<p>It is difficult to face</p>
<p>And I know your life without me would be a dull blank yet. You must never let it become wholly so</p>
<p>For to you will be left the greatest charge in all the world the upbringing of our baby</p>
<p>God bless that child. She&rsquo;s the hope of life to me</p>
<p>My darling au revoir</p>
<p>It may be that you will only have to read these lines as one of passing interest on the other hand</p>
<p>They may well be my last message to you</p>
<p>If they are</p>
<p>Know through all your life that i&rsquo;ve loved you and baby with all my heart and soul</p>
<p>That you two sweet things were just all the world to me</p>
<p>I pray god that I may do my duty for I know</p>
<p>Whatever that may entail</p>
<p>You would not have it. Otherwise</p>

<p>My thanks to peter hart for talking with us today and listen down the road if we&rsquo;re lucky we&rsquo;ll get to do it again</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been telling you about audible for years obviously audiobooks and a whole lot more</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t discovered the joys of audiobooks, there&rsquo;s elements to it</p>
<p>That I think are going to develop that I already find fascinating take the element of whose voice it is</p>
<p>Reading to you. I mean it&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t consider when you think about getting a book is it?</p>
<p>I mean who&rsquo;s the narrator?</p>
<p>I mean, I imagine one day you&rsquo;re going to be able to customize this with some sort of button</p>
<p>You know with your favorite movie star. I want michael cain narrating today&rsquo;s book and you know, it&rsquo;ll all come out that way</p>
<p>But I was looking for recommendations for today&rsquo;s um particular</p>
<p>Little discussion and uh peter hart who we just talked to has a couple of books on audible</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re narrated by different people</p>
<p>And so i&rsquo;m sampling them going</p>
<p>Okay, do I want peter hart&rsquo;s book on the psalm in this voice or do I want peter hart&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Other book on the psalm in this other voice and it&rsquo;s interesting because it&rsquo;s an element. You don&rsquo;t think about there&rsquo;s a performance aspect to it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things to like about audiobooks is you get to kind of</p>
<p>You know have different people read to you in different voices decide what you like</p>
<p>And like I said someday I imagine this will be quite customizable</p>
<p>Audio books, of course been around a long time. So has audible we&rsquo;ve been telling you about them for years</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been supporting us</p>
<p>Um, and we&rsquo;ve watched as they have, you know, sort of rolled out more and more features to what they do</p>
<p>I mean one of the things we&rsquo;ve talked about that&rsquo;s great about audible, you know, you sign up to audible you get points</p>
<p>You get a book that&rsquo;s free every month</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one of those membership type services, but there&rsquo;s things that they just do, right?</p>
<p>I mean they roll over</p>
<p>You know your points kind of so if you don&rsquo;t get a book</p>
<p>This month while those points accrue so that you know, you have more next month you own the books, which I love</p>
<p>It is so weird to me to purchase something and then realize wait a minute</p>
<p>If you read the fine print, you don&rsquo;t actually own this you own these books</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>If i&rsquo;m going to buy something like this, I want to own it</p>
<p>I need a big selection too and audible&rsquo;s got one that carry titles in business the classics</p>
<p>fiction history romance mystery thrillers sci-fi fantasy self-development kids and you I mean, you know</p>
<p>Like a bookstore, right?</p>
<p>When I was younger if you liked audiobooks you got to go to the library and see what they had available on cassette tapes now</p>
<p>when a new book comes out and hits the</p>
<p>you know bookstores digital, uh, and</p>
<p>You know brick and mortar. Um audible usually has it too. That&rsquo;s a sign of the popularity of these things and why not?</p>
<p>It allows you to read a good book</p>
<p>To motivate yourself educate yourself entertain yourself make yourself more successful and inspired</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re doing some other chore that does not require your full attention. You got to mow the lawn</p>
<p>Well, maybe you can you know get one of those classic books read at the same time gotta iron some sheets</p>
<p>Well, why can&rsquo;t you be enjoying a romance novel at the same time you get where i&rsquo;m coming with this busy people</p>
<p>Are consuming books at rates that well when you consider how busy they are</p>
<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t be able to find the time to do that audio books fill a void and audible&rsquo;s the best place to get them</p>
<p>And if you sign up today, you can get a free audiobook with a 30-day trial membership</p>
<p>Go to audible.com forward slash carlin and browse the unmatched selection of audio programs. You can download a title start listening</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that easy</p>
<p>Go to audible.com forward slash carlin or text carlin to 500-500 and get started today</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what to get I recommend peter hart&rsquo;s two books on the psalm</p>
<p>The newer one probably has more updated information. The official title of that is the psalm the darkest hour on the western front</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s got an earlier book on the psalm also on audible narrated by an english gentleman. I believe his name is pronounced</p>
<p>Tim piggott smith and to me it sounds more like peter hart&rsquo;s actually reading me the book</p>
<p>So the newer book probably has the newer information</p>
<p>But if you really want to have somebody reading to you that sounds more like the author</p>
<p>Get the earlier book. The good news is they&rsquo;re both available on audible and if you can&rsquo;t decide feel free to buy them both</p>
<p>Sure, the older hardcore history shows can be a bit traumatic</p>
<p>With titles like death throes of the republic</p>
<p>judgment at nineveh and addicted to bondage</p>
<p>We just consider that truth in advertising. No pain. No gain is our motto pick up the entire catalog from dan carlin.com</p>
<p>Be sure to follow us on twitter. The address is at hardcore history</p>
