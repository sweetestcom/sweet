<p>visit parcast com</p>
<p>cults to pre order your copy of cults</p>
<p>inside the world&rsquo;s most notorious</p>
<p>groups and understanding the people who joined them</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d hate to call it a cliche</p>
<p>symbol but the crystal ball is the</p>
<p>image that you</p>
<p>think of when you hear fortune teller</p>
<p>or you want to predict the future it&rsquo;s just like a</p>
<p>classic image</p>
<p>can confirm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably one of the</p>
<p>first things i</p>
<p>think of when i</p>
<p>think fortune teller</p>
<p>well crystal balls actually</p>
<p>have a pretty deep history so no matter what you</p>
<p>think of them their</p>
<p>popularity has lasted for thousands of years so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go over why</p>
<p>in this episode</p>
<p>i wonder if someone thousands</p>
<p>of years ago looked into a crystal ball and knew</p>
<p>how popular they&rsquo;d say</p>
<p>i saw this very episode</p>
<p>oh god they were like oh</p>
<p>my gosh i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>so glad to be thousands of years before that</p>
<p>the future looks bleak</p>
<p>hi everyone and welcome</p>
<p>to rituals a spotify original from parcast</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m christine</p>
<p>schieffer and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>m schultz and</p>
<p>every week we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>explore the</p>
<p>evolution of</p>
<p>spiritualism and the occult through stories practices</p>
<p>and the impact on</p>
<p>modern culture</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk</p>
<p>about crystal balls</p>
<p>today something that i</p>
<p>i feel like we are on the periphery of knowing</p>
<p>about but don&rsquo;t really know that much about</p>
<p>i feel like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of embarrassing after</p>
<p>talking about this</p>
<p>stuff for so long that we know nothing</p>
<p>about crystal balls and i do feel like we say that</p>
<p>every episode</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s embarrassing how little we know</p>
<p>about this so</p>
<p>maybe we should just make that a</p>
<p>catch all for</p>
<p>every topic yeah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>sound like a broken record</p>
<p>but i also do</p>
<p>appreciate that that means</p>
<p>after all this time there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still so many</p>
<p>things to learn</p>
<p>about because i feel like</p>
<p>every time someone</p>
<p>directs us to a</p>
<p>topic we&rsquo;re like what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really true and</p>
<p>we have probably</p>
<p>years of content</p>
<p>speaking of crystals</p>
<p>obviously i couldn&rsquo;t do this without</p>
<p>letting us have</p>
<p>our crystal</p>
<p>you brought big girl</p>
<p>i brought big c i love her there she is</p>
<p>oh look she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so special i know no one else can see this but</p>
<p>we actually have a crystal ball that</p>
<p>travels with us on tour</p>
<p>her name&rsquo;s crystal obviously</p>
<p>we call her big crystal because she is</p>
<p>heavy as sin and she is the reason why our</p>
<p>luggage is always we always have to pay the premium on</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like 10</p>
<p>pounds she&rsquo;s like a kettle ball</p>
<p>or kettlebell</p>
<p>or whatever it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s hefty</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna say this next phrase in</p>
<p>front of her because i feel like this</p>
<p>might be hard for her to hear but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go covering her ears</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s crack into it</p>
<p>do you think crystal is a crystal</p>
<p>or is she made of glass</p>
<p>i think she&rsquo;s probably not actually a crystal</p>
<p>she was oddly cheap</p>
<p>oh well that</p>
<p>maybe explains it no offense crystal but</p>
<p>you are hefty</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s perfectly</p>
<p>polished i feel like a crystal ball i mean i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;ve never seen a crystal ball in real life and</p>
<p>everything has been</p>
<p>glass or fake or</p>
<p>maybe all real and crystal is much prettier that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>aware of much</p>
<p>less um in my mind a crystal ball</p>
<p>would have some sort of like imperfections to it but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not meant to i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re meant to be oh</p>
<p>yeah perfectly</p>
<p>clear so you can really</p>
<p>see the future well then</p>
<p>honestly i don&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;ll have to do like a dna a</p>
<p>23andme on crystal eventually oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cute send in her dna that&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>until then i would</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s safe to</p>
<p>bet that she&rsquo;s probably just glass</p>
<p>honestly i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna know because if she is crystal that means</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve just been lugging her around in the suitcase and</p>
<p>having them</p>
<p>throw her on the tarmac and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gone through a lot yeah yeah</p>
<p>but i do know enough</p>
<p>about crystal balls to know that</p>
<p>she probably would</p>
<p>still function</p>
<p>as a crystal ball</p>
<p>because i think you only need</p>
<p>reflective surfaces</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right yet to do some scrying she&rsquo;s got a lot of</p>
<p>those so we</p>
<p>could scry with her you know</p>
<p>do you know anything</p>
<p>about crystal ball gazing have you ever</p>
<p>you said you&rsquo;ve probably</p>
<p>never even seen</p>
<p>a real one have you ever had a reading i</p>
<p>guess not i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>i mean the only</p>
<p>thing i really know about</p>
<p>crystal balls is whatever</p>
<p>stereotypes have been</p>
<p>fit into my</p>
<p>brain so like</p>
<p>you know a fortune teller and</p>
<p>an offshoot room</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i know really anything</p>
<p>about crystal ball</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know how it works i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a certain crystal ball you need</p>
<p>i know reflective surfaces are kind of</p>
<p>the standard or they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>what you can practice on but i don&rsquo;t know anything else</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know honestly i don&rsquo;t know much</p>
<p>about it either i</p>
<p>agree that i</p>
<p>always kind of looked at it as like a cliche</p>
<p>and i may have seen one</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if that palm reader jessica</p>
<p>from one of our past episodes that i talked</p>
<p>about had one perhaps or</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s just my</p>
<p>my memory looking</p>
<p>back but i always kind of thought of them as</p>
<p>kind of cliche</p>
<p>and like maybe they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t work but that&rsquo;s my own bias i</p>
<p>think because i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how they work yeah i feel like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely a skeptical</p>
<p>part of me with crystal balls but i also think</p>
<p>first of all i don&rsquo;t know enough</p>
<p>about it to even have an opinion</p>
<p>but i jump immediately to having</p>
<p>some skeptical opinions because</p>
<p>i just feel like it&rsquo;s such an</p>
<p>easy thing to</p>
<p>trick people into</p>
<p>of like oh let me look into the crystal ball and</p>
<p>since you don&rsquo;t know how it works you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tell if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually doing anything or not</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>it could be a very easy</p>
<p>trick if someone wanted it to be</p>
<p>i agree i agree and i think</p>
<p>just saying you see something you</p>
<p>would be able to</p>
<p>just make that</p>
<p>claim without any sort of</p>
<p>basis yeah i</p>
<p>agree i also wonder if it does work</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still skeptical because</p>
<p>or if people</p>
<p>think they work if they</p>
<p>claim that they really are seeing</p>
<p>things in the crystal ball</p>
<p>part of me thinks it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>an illusion or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at something long enough that</p>
<p>your brain makes up</p>
<p>things kind</p>
<p>of like with bloody mary how like the troxler effect</p>
<p>i kind of wonder like</p>
<p>either it&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>trick and it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work or people are</p>
<p>truly convinced it works and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still an illusion i feel like i have a lot of</p>
<p>butts about it</p>
<p>yeah and i think that goes into a lot of the</p>
<p>kind of occult and spiritual practices</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like is this</p>
<p>coming from my mind is</p>
<p>this a trick of the mind</p>
<p>is this coming from a higher source is this coming from</p>
<p>my subconscious yeah i</p>
<p>agree i feel like that&rsquo;s very easy</p>
<p>question to fall into</p>
<p>and it basically all comes down to scrying</p>
<p>which i feel like we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about a little bit have we talked</p>
<p>about that on the</p>
<p>other podcast</p>
<p>maybe my first real</p>
<p>awareness of scrying was through charmed</p>
<p>which i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to take anything they offer me at face value</p>
<p>my stepmom who&rsquo;s wiccan</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been wiccan for like</p>
<p>40 years she loves scrying but i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never known</p>
<p>it as a crystal ball situation i always knew it as a</p>
<p>pendulum situation</p>
<p>oh cause i always knew it as a mirror hmm</p>
<p>interesting yeah</p>
<p>so let me tell you a little</p>
<p>about scrying</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m gonna just tell it up</p>
<p>front before we get into</p>
<p>the whole story because</p>
<p>it comes up a lot</p>
<p>so scrying is when you gaze into a</p>
<p>reflective surface in</p>
<p>order to get some prophetic insight so you</p>
<p>would stare</p>
<p>into a scrying mirror</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i know of you</p>
<p>would stare for example into a crystal to see</p>
<p>visions or messages i don&rsquo;t know about the</p>
<p>pendulum is that like you stare at the pendulum</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t totally</p>
<p>understand but i know she&rsquo;s got them all over</p>
<p>the house she</p>
<p>definitely explained it to me at some</p>
<p>point and just so many years have</p>
<p>passed i don&rsquo;t totally</p>
<p>know anymore</p>
<p>well maybe she can be a</p>
<p>guest star on the show someday</p>
<p>i was gonna say</p>
<p>maybe i certainly don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>the person who explains that and then</p>
<p>completely butchers it we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>phone a friend yeah</p>
<p>crystal balls have been used to</p>
<p>look into the future for thousands of years literally</p>
<p>before the industrial revolution the</p>
<p>pawnee the iroquois the incas the</p>
<p>egyptians the persians the chinese and the people</p>
<p>of yucatan were</p>
<p>known to crystal gaze</p>
<p>so this is a very popular</p>
<p>concept from all around the</p>
<p>world so it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like one you</p>
<p>know like a</p>
<p>tarot deck that was popularized in one</p>
<p>place and then</p>
<p>spread it was something that</p>
<p>many cultures did</p>
<p>which is kind of kind of cool</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s possible that</p>
<p>crystals being used for divination dates back to the</p>
<p>celtic druids who</p>
<p>according to julius</p>
<p>caesar and the</p>
<p>roman philosopher</p>
<p>pliny the elder</p>
<p>were known to perform</p>
<p>sacrificial magic</p>
<p>ceremonies in the woods ooh</p>
<p>spooky those</p>
<p>early crystal gazers were called speculari</p>
<p>and they generally used a sea</p>
<p>green mineral called beryl</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s b e r y</p>
<p>l and i googled this to see what a</p>
<p>crystal ball made of barrel looks like it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s gorgeous</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t seen it as a crystal ball but i have seen</p>
<p>just as like a</p>
<p>you know a rock just its own mineral yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the color is so pretty there&rsquo;s also red barrel</p>
<p>which is like a hot pink it&rsquo;s very pretty ooh</p>
<p>yeah i haven&rsquo;t seen that one</p>
<p>i looked it up one time i looked up barrel</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s supposed to</p>
<p>cure laziness</p>
<p>i read on one website and i was like oh sign me up</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s why your whole</p>
<p>shelf back there oh i&rsquo;m seeing it now it&rsquo;s just full</p>
<p>stockful well working no</p>
<p>maybe i got a</p>
<p>knockoff just like how our crystal ball is probably</p>
<p>solid glass i</p>
<p>think barrel is like a</p>
<p>chunk of an old like wine bottle or something</p>
<p>you just found some sea</p>
<p>glass i just</p>
<p>found some like</p>
<p>random bottle yeah</p>
<p>sea glass it&rsquo;s exactly what it looks like though</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>color yeah so</p>
<p>basically the barrel</p>
<p>would get polished and i want to be clear</p>
<p>again this is a barrel b e</p>
<p>r y l it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>a barrel full of bourbon</p>
<p>the barrel with the y</p>
<p>would get polished into</p>
<p>spheres to make the crystal more</p>
<p>reflective and that way you</p>
<p>could use it for scrying you</p>
<p>could also get a barrel of barrels</p>
<p>if you really wanted to now we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>now that is fun</p>
<p>so in addition to i</p>
<p>guess what m said</p>
<p>barrel being used</p>
<p>to cure laziness</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also believed to be much more magnetically</p>
<p>charged than</p>
<p>other minerals so theoretically this means that it</p>
<p>could connect with the</p>
<p>psychic energies of the moon better than other</p>
<p>minerals that&rsquo;s so cool</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it neat</p>
<p>i just thought that was so fascinating</p>
<p>because i know crystals get poo pooed a lot in</p>
<p>the mainstream</p>
<p>and you know i</p>
<p>understand the skepticism but i personally</p>
<p>love my crystal</p>
<p>collection it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting you call it mainstream because i feel like</p>
<p>crystals are</p>
<p>becoming more and more accepted in the mainstream</p>
<p>oh no they are but i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still a lot of like</p>
<p>kind of joke like</p>
<p>laughing about</p>
<p>it like granola hippie</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah just like oh that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>l you know i mean i</p>
<p>moved to kentucky from los angeles and i</p>
<p>think everyone is wondering how i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna fit my crystal</p>
<p>collection into my new home you know that kind of</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re totally</p>
<p>right i really forget that</p>
<p>compared to la</p>
<p>everywhere else</p>
<p>is probably just like a lawless land for crystals</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re definitely out of</p>
<p>place they&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna check in on them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing okay</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>right over there but they</p>
<p>definitely had to adjust to</p>
<p>their new home</p>
<p>kentucky&rsquo;s not the most</p>
<p>i totally forget i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>lucky that i totally forget that the rest of the</p>
<p>world is not los angeles so</p>
<p>yeah that must be nice in la</p>
<p>we freaking</p>
<p>love crystals we go goo goo gaga over that so oh yeah</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>wrong i mean our luggage coming from la</p>
<p>every time we&rsquo;re on tour has a</p>
<p>literal crystal ball in it so i</p>
<p>think i understand</p>
<p>why and people give us crystals and people i mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many crystals there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually a crystal shop opening up down the road</p>
<p>oh wonderful well</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s one opening up here too</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be mine it&rsquo;ll be my garage so it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>i was gonna say it&rsquo;ll be the</p>
<p>first ever kentucky&rsquo;s ever seen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>world i&rsquo;m spreading i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>spreading the la love</p>
<p>so anyway all i was saying is that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s interesting even though people</p>
<p>some people tend to be pretty skeptical</p>
<p>about crystals or</p>
<p>wonder what</p>
<p>their properties really are</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of cool that</p>
<p>theoretically</p>
<p>one crystal or one mineral</p>
<p>could have these properties that</p>
<p>could theoretically make it</p>
<p>more powerful to do sort of</p>
<p>otherworldly</p>
<p>stuff with so i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s kind of a cool fact</p>
<p>so after the druids and everyone else had been</p>
<p>doing some crystal ball gazing in the woods</p>
<p>it picked up</p>
<p>popularity in rome</p>
<p>and they were like have you</p>
<p>heard the stuff</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s doing it</p>
<p>get in on it get on the ground</p>
<p>floor on the ground</p>
<p>floor yeah i like to</p>
<p>think crystal balls</p>
<p>maybe started as like an</p>
<p>mlm of like hey girly</p>
<p>like i do have you</p>
<p>heard about what we&rsquo;re doing out in the woods it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy if you wanted to</p>
<p>start your own but it&rsquo;s the druids</p>
<p>the druids are like hey girly</p>
<p>come out to the woods with me one time</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>it went viral for</p>
<p>those early</p>
<p>roman days like oh</p>
<p>so and so had a crystal ball at school</p>
<p>i want my own</p>
<p>i feel like we keep finding ways to equate</p>
<p>this to today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>influencer world and</p>
<p>honestly it&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>things a lot more palatable</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m totally</p>
<p>understanding</p>
<p>the history of this a lot better by being like</p>
<p>so like the druids were like</p>
<p>the kooky crystal bulkheads and like</p>
<p>rome was like i</p>
<p>gotta get in on that i know people are kind of laughing</p>
<p>about it but</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re onto something rome was like burbank</p>
<p>california and was like</p>
<p>oh boy we could pick up on this</p>
<p>i see potential here</p>
<p>well this probably didn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>help or her i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t decide what</p>
<p>effect this had but i will add that the catholic church</p>
<p>was like oh no we do not</p>
<p>we do not like this the</p>
<p>bible forbids it</p>
<p>yeah well it makes</p>
<p>sense that they</p>
<p>would come suck the fun out of the room but okay</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t they why</p>
<p>do they do that anyway the book of deuteronomy to be</p>
<p>exact mentions</p>
<p>not to listen to fortune tellers</p>
<p>so of course</p>
<p>the catholics are all up in arms</p>
<p>about this and</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t decide if that helped or hurt</p>
<p>the crystal ball</p>
<p>cause cause i have a feeling some people</p>
<p>would be like ooh</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s more fun and some people</p>
<p>would be like oh</p>
<p>never mind that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you and me 100</p>
<p>would have said oh</p>
<p>the bible isn&rsquo;t into it i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>invested like</p>
<p>hey girly let&rsquo;s go to the woods</p>
<p>the church says i can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>yeah no i totally</p>
<p>know what you mean we&rsquo;re like i probably really like</p>
<p>empowered one half of the</p>
<p>some people yeah</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>other half was like oh now i&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>gonna steer from it so i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>probably balanced out</p>
<p>broke even yeah yeah i have a feeling</p>
<p>of course the catholic church had to have</p>
<p>their say either way</p>
<p>but the crystal ball was also</p>
<p>thought to be used during the medieval period by anglo</p>
<p>saxons as both</p>
<p>get this a source of</p>
<p>magic on one hand and</p>
<p>a flashy fashion accessory</p>
<p>i mean to this day i</p>
<p>think of them as flashy</p>
<p>fashion accessories really</p>
<p>yeah like i oh</p>
<p>not like that i think</p>
<p>the jenners and the</p>
<p>kardashians have</p>
<p>magic crystal balls or crystal balls at all in</p>
<p>their home but it&rsquo;s something that i notice</p>
<p>in every household i go to if they have a crystal ball</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s like i mean</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re talking more</p>
<p>about like apparel or something but in terms</p>
<p>of talking about like jewelry</p>
<p>oh cause i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking like in home decor</p>
<p>oh decor if</p>
<p>someone ever has a crystal ball in their home</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>first things i comment on</p>
<p>to me they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still very she she yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>that was part of it too but during the medieval period</p>
<p>as far as fashion goes</p>
<p>people wore crystal</p>
<p>spheres that were fastened to wire</p>
<p>as symbols of</p>
<p>power class</p>
<p>status and possibly as</p>
<p>magic charms to</p>
<p>ward off evil</p>
<p>so sort of like that</p>
<p>it is pretty badass</p>
<p>like i know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t usually</p>
<p>think of medieval fashion</p>
<p>as being pretty</p>
<p>modern but i feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very like i</p>
<p>could see that being a jewelry line today that</p>
<p>oh yeah are you</p>
<p>getting you know</p>
<p>hey let&rsquo;s do it tm tm tm</p>
<p>yeah nobody can take that because we&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>tm a bunch of times</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how that works yes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it works that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how it works i&rsquo;m totally into that i mean it makes</p>
<p>sense i feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of jewelry</p>
<p>places where like you pick your own</p>
<p>gemstone or you pick us</p>
<p>absolutely so i mean it&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s totally died out i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>super popular</p>
<p>yeah no that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>point i think</p>
<p>it would hit the right</p>
<p>market nowadays i</p>
<p>would think</p>
<p>and by the way you</p>
<p>could do dual purpose</p>
<p>be stuck in the doctor&rsquo;s waiting room</p>
<p>your jewel scrying</p>
<p>i love that</p>
<p>well also well</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m curious to see</p>
<p>i assume at some</p>
<p>point you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to explain how crystal balls work</p>
<p>because i wonder if</p>
<p>like are you able to scry</p>
<p>on your ring</p>
<p>cause that would be so convenient</p>
<p>to just always have a crystal ball with you</p>
<p>i imagine so as long as you can</p>
<p>see it properly</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>every time we talk</p>
<p>about something like this like with</p>
<p>tarot or love potions</p>
<p>i feel like i find out</p>
<p>that this practice is so much</p>
<p>more convenient or</p>
<p>so much more accessible</p>
<p>than i&rsquo;m aware of and i feel like with</p>
<p>crystal balls i always thought oh i have to get a big c</p>
<p>yeah i have to get a big</p>
<p>c i have to go find somebody who knows how to do this</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>if you have one on your hand at all times you</p>
<p>could just like</p>
<p>while waiting for your food at a restaurant do some</p>
<p>crystal ball gazing</p>
<p>but i mean you think</p>
<p>about it and you know scrying is</p>
<p>often done in</p>
<p>mirrors too so and</p>
<p>those are obviously</p>
<p>those abound</p>
<p>so you could do one in any</p>
<p>mirror can you</p>
<p>imagine you&rsquo;re in the elevator and just staring at the</p>
<p>mirror like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry i&rsquo;m scrying please don&rsquo;t technically then</p>
<p>black mirror</p>
<p>could you do it with your</p>
<p>phone if you just like turn it off for a second</p>
<p>could you just stare at your own</p>
<p>dead phone oh i</p>
<p>thought we were talking</p>
<p>about the tv show</p>
<p>like playing on your</p>
<p>phone you&rsquo;re talking like the actual true</p>
<p>black mirror your phone yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure i&rsquo;m sure you really</p>
<p>could that&rsquo;s so cool because</p>
<p>it just needs to be a</p>
<p>reflective surface</p>
<p>so yeah you&rsquo;d be able to do that</p>
<p>but i mean if you</p>
<p>think about it</p>
<p>too like if you have a lot of it is so subjective and</p>
<p>based on your own</p>
<p>so as far as</p>
<p>tarot if you have a deck yeah you</p>
<p>could probably use it even if you&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>super well trained</p>
<p>you can probably use it in your own way so</p>
<p>or pendulum or</p>
<p>dowsing rods so yeah i</p>
<p>guess it is pretty</p>
<p>accessible wow as long as you have the main ingredient</p>
<p>so in this case something</p>
<p>reflective oh my gosh</p>

<p>crystal balls</p>
<p>went from fashion accessories in the middle ages</p>
<p>back to fortune telling form</p>
<p>during the renaissance</p>
<p>so now they were being used not only</p>
<p>as a beautiful</p>
<p>piece of jewelry</p>
<p>but also as a very</p>
<p>powerful tool</p>
<p>okay this was helped by the</p>
<p>royal astrologer to</p>
<p>queen elizabeth i</p>
<p>so the royal astrologer to</p>
<p>queen elizabeth the</p>
<p>first was really into crystal balls for scrying</p>
<p>and believed he was communicating with</p>
<p>angels and demons through the crystal ball</p>
<p>and so he would talk to the queen</p>
<p>about it and this helped the crystal ball&rsquo;s</p>
<p>popularity kind of revive and it became popular again</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s very cool but two this is</p>
<p>i feel like we just keep hearing the same</p>
<p>story over and over that like political leaders are</p>
<p>inserting spirituality into</p>
<p>their leadership</p>
<p>like we have ouija</p>
<p>boards being</p>
<p>used by politicians lincoln was doing seances</p>
<p>i feel like we were spirit</p>
<p>photography</p>
<p>spirit photography</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>literally the</p>
<p>queen is using a crystal ball</p>
<p>well guess what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come up</p>
<p>again in a more</p>
<p>modern sense</p>
<p>a us political</p>
<p>sense you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have another one to add</p>
<p>to the list of presidents who&rsquo;ve been involved in this</p>
<p>i need to just keep a chart of all</p>
<p>world leaders and just start</p>
<p>knocking them off of like</p>
<p>which ones use spirituality and eventually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be all of them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>guess who game you know just</p>
<p>knock them off if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>did they do scrying</p>
<p>yeah does this one look like they</p>
<p>would secretly be into the spirituality</p>
<p>oh my god yes to all</p>
<p>once crystal gazing seemed more</p>
<p>legit the occult</p>
<p>used the works of indian and arabic writers as a way to</p>
<p>legitimize crystal</p>
<p>balls as tools for seeing into the future</p>
<p>and during the middle ages and renaissance so from</p>
<p>about the fifth to the 17th century</p>
<p>the romani and nomadic</p>
<p>group migrated to europe</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>known traditionally to use crystal balls in</p>
<p>their work but</p>
<p>since now the people of europe were really into them</p>
<p>they kind of incorporated them</p>
<p>to use them into</p>
<p>their own work more and people</p>
<p>began seeking out</p>
<p>their advice</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where you get that kind of</p>
<p>connection of like</p>
<p>romani fortune teller</p>
<p>crystal ball</p>
<p>i see okay i never</p>
<p>never knew that</p>
<p>i had neither i knew of the kind of</p>
<p>cliche connection there</p>
<p>but i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where it came from and makes a lot of</p>
<p>sense yeah i just always</p>
<p>knew it was kind of a stereotype and i had no idea</p>
<p>where it came from</p>
<p>wow yep well</p>
<p>fun fact just</p>
<p>gonna stick this</p>
<p>right in here the church is</p>
<p>still very opposed to this</p>
<p>whole ordeal</p>
<p>okay get back to me when they&rsquo;re cool with it how</p>
<p>about that i know</p>
<p>i know we&rsquo;re all surprised but</p>
<p>i just wanted to remind you thank you</p>
<p>then when we get to the victorian era</p>
<p>which is roughly the mid 1800s to the</p>
<p>early 1900s as you know</p>
<p>and as we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about the occult and spiritualism</p>
<p>get another big</p>
<p>boost in popularity</p>
<p>and along with that comes more crystal gazing</p>
<p>along with spirit</p>
<p>photography</p>
<p>seances all the good</p>
<p>stuff aha i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that makes sense to me i feel like</p>
<p>as a historian you know</p>
<p>as everyone&rsquo;s favorite historian yes</p>
<p>i feel like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one era of history</p>
<p>and time in general that i feel confident</p>
<p>giving my two cents on and it&rsquo;s usually</p>
<p>the era of spiritualism</p>
<p>this makes perfect</p>
<p>sense to me why the crystal ball</p>
<p>would just fit</p>
<p>right in and be like all the rage</p>
<p>you brought this up</p>
<p>earlier too of like it probably</p>
<p>would be an easy tool</p>
<p>if you were trying to</p>
<p>fool people or take advantage of people</p>
<p>you would be able to say you saw something</p>
<p>in it there&rsquo;s such a history of</p>
<p>fraudulent mediums</p>
<p>especially during that time yep</p>
<p>yep it would not be hard right</p>
<p>it was believed that when the sun was at a certain</p>
<p>point in the sky you</p>
<p>would look into the crystal ball and see a rising mist</p>
<p>and then step two</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d get a vision of the future</p>
<p>that hmm seems</p>
<p>fishy to me but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never seen</p>
<p>a rising mist</p>
<p>in our sweet crystal</p>
<p>but also maybe</p>
<p>cause she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>glass i also</p>
<p>cause she&rsquo;s in a suitcase 98</p>
<p>of the time fair enough i also feel like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>thing but i feel like</p>
<p>looking into a crystal ball</p>
<p>when the sun is at a certain</p>
<p>point in the sky</p>
<p>it sounds a lot like looking into a magnifying</p>
<p>glass through the sun and</p>
<p>burning your eyes out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many ants</p>
<p>dying i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what this means</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all fortune tellers</p>
<p>actually that&rsquo;s interesting science too like</p>
<p>should you be</p>
<p>using a crystal ball out in the sun or is there</p>
<p>a reason why it&rsquo;s always been like an off dark room</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t know that it meant like to do it</p>
<p>into the sun i</p>
<p>think it was just when</p>
<p>maybe it did</p>
<p>but i interpreted it as</p>
<p>when the sun hits a certain</p>
<p>point that&rsquo;s the moment that the crystal ball will</p>
<p>have a message for you i don&rsquo;t know that it was like</p>
<p>okay okay that makes no</p>
<p>sense maybe you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right maybe you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right maybe</p>
<p>it was that the sun was reflecting through i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think anyone&rsquo;s looking at</p>
<p>their ball like this through the sun like so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking you&rsquo;re really gonna get</p>
<p>above them and</p>
<p>using it as</p>
<p>glasses near</p>
<p>the sun&rsquo;s like burn your retinas like you said</p>
<p>but i do wonder like</p>
<p>could a crystal ball</p>
<p>be just think of the</p>
<p>ants do you think</p>
<p>if you were</p>
<p>crystal ball gazing on a</p>
<p>sunny day are</p>
<p>ants in danger</p>
<p>because the sun&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna hit it at a certain angle</p>
<p>anyway we&rsquo;re derailing i just donate to our new charity</p>
<p>save the ants</p>
<p>in the arms of</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s an epidemic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not talked</p>
<p>about enough i know an ant</p>
<p>culture i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if you know this but they probably talk</p>
<p>about like big</p>
<p>glass orbs just showing up and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eyeing</p>
<p>them their whole colony goes away oh</p>
<p>well this leads us indirectly</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>force it in anyway into how exactly crystal balls work</p>
<p>i know you want to know honestly</p>
<p>i do and that was</p>
<p>not forced at all because i am obviously getting off</p>
<p>track trying to figure out how this</p>
<p>thing goes so</p>
<p>perfect perfect segway oh good</p>
<p>well we&rsquo;ve mentioned who used crystal balls and when</p>
<p>and we did tell you what scrying was</p>
<p>earlier but so how</p>
<p>exactly does it all come together to predict the future</p>
<p>let me tell you</p>
<p>as i said you can practice scrying on any</p>
<p>reflective surface</p>
<p>but obviously crystal balls are kind of the</p>
<p>classic most common used for divination</p>
<p>and those crystal ball users</p>
<p>those early ones called speculari</p>
<p>this is how they</p>
<p>would do it</p>
<p>they would stare deeply into the</p>
<p>stone and go into a</p>
<p>meditative trance</p>
<p>so i don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>wanna get crystal b out and</p>
<p>give her a little stare</p>
<p>stare down i am doing it</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re saying this i know nothing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m not in the</p>
<p>right mind for it but i will be doing this</p>
<p>after we record</p>
<p>excellent i do</p>
<p>wanna know how this goes</p>
<p>yeah so you stare into it deeply you go into a</p>
<p>meditative trance</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>this actually</p>
<p>sorry i know i&rsquo;m interrupting your</p>
<p>trance but you know this</p>
<p>reminds me of</p>
<p>other forms of divination</p>
<p>like pendulums</p>
<p>like tarot just</p>
<p>even akashic record reading like what i do where</p>
<p>you really do kind of put yourself into the</p>
<p>right mental</p>
<p>state and that really helps and so</p>
<p>yeah i wonder</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the waiting room and you&rsquo;re gonna scry</p>
<p>you probably</p>
<p>need to work at being able to put yourself in that</p>
<p>place yeah you need to</p>
<p>be able to switch very quickly into different mindsets</p>
<p>yeah if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>planning on doing this out in public i imagine</p>
<p>anyway or even</p>
<p>what if you&rsquo;re so good at it you accidentally slip into</p>
<p>trances is that unfortunate that&rsquo;s unfortunate</p>
<p>like what if you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>ice cream and then you look at the</p>
<p>spoon and you&rsquo;re like uh oh like</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>trance my ice cream</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;re the only one in danger of this occurring</p>
<p>but let me know</p>
<p>what you see in our future if that happens again</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if i&rsquo;d call it a</p>
<p>trans but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>certainly much more open minded to all opportunity</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m having a spiritual</p>
<p>experience so</p>
<p>you are and you&rsquo;re easily manipulated</p>
<p>transcending you&rsquo;re transcendent</p>
<p>in that moment</p>
<p>easily manipulated</p>
<p>yeah i could</p>
<p>actually see this being a danger zone for you so i</p>
<p>would be really careful</p>
<p>well okay when i get real good at this</p>
<p>spoons out of the</p>
<p>picture plastic</p>
<p>spoons only exactly</p>
<p>so they go into this meditative</p>
<p>trance this is step one</p>
<p>this would then help them tap into</p>
<p>their subconscious and reveal</p>
<p>secrets of the past present or future hmm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really it that&rsquo;s the steps but</p>
<p>again like that just shows me how</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if sheltered&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>right word or how like</p>
<p>unaware i was of how accessible</p>
<p>these things were</p>
<p>in my mind every</p>
<p>topic we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>covered where like anyone</p>
<p>could practice it they all seem like</p>
<p>you have to go through all this</p>
<p>training and all this practice</p>
<p>and just to find out</p>
<p>every single time like</p>
<p>no you could have done it</p>
<p>all on your own this whole time</p>
<p>i feel like</p>
<p>with all this</p>
<p>stuff like you</p>
<p>can easily access it but then you need to really</p>
<p>train yourself to</p>
<p>be good at it so</p>
<p>what happens when you stare into a crystal ball and i</p>
<p>think this part&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because this is what different people say is happening</p>
<p>when you are staring in this</p>
<p>trance into a crystal ball</p>
<p>so some users say you&rsquo;ll receive</p>
<p>actual like</p>
<p>literal visions of the future or</p>
<p>secrets of the universe or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to communicate with unseen</p>
<p>realms not to be dramatic or anything but you know</p>
<p>but to be dramatic</p>
<p>as i wave my</p>
<p>flash my cape</p>
<p>not to be dramatic but yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna communicate with some unseen realms real quick</p>
<p>so some people believe that like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>literal interpretation</p>
<p>of you&rsquo;re seeing the future you&rsquo;re seeing a vision</p>
<p>in this surface and so that&rsquo;s one theory</p>
<p>another theory</p>
<p>is that it makes you more clairvoyant</p>
<p>so sort of i</p>
<p>think what you were saying of you can</p>
<p>kind of get yourself into a</p>
<p>state a mental</p>
<p>state where you&rsquo;re open to receiving information</p>
<p>so you could see either something that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in a different place</p>
<p>sounds almost like astral projecting to me a little bit</p>
<p>or you can access some</p>
<p>other information because you&rsquo;re in a more clairvoyant</p>
<p>state and there are some people who just say it</p>
<p>relaxes your mind and maybe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to i don&rsquo;t know if that means you&rsquo;re able to just</p>
<p>hear your own subconscious</p>
<p>i feel like that</p>
<p>would probably be the camp i fall into</p>
<p>first i think it</p>
<p>just being able to</p>
<p>relax your mind and be open</p>
<p>spiritually</p>
<p>does a lot more than we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>aware of yeah</p>
<p>from the skeptic</p>
<p>side though</p>
<p>i do wonder like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at something long enough of course your mind&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna wander and so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t totally</p>
<p>understand the science of it but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>very open to it and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>again can be related to so many of</p>
<p>these topics</p>
<p>with akashic record reading too there&rsquo;s no like</p>
<p>proof that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing anything but</p>
<p>talking in your own head you</p>
<p>know but you</p>
<p>just kind of have to either go with it and believe it</p>
<p>or be a skeptic and say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just my own</p>
<p>brain and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>again another mental hurdle but</p>
<p>yeah and you know have you ever i&rsquo;m sure you have</p>
<p>or i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>maybe i&rsquo;m just a weirdo but have you ever stared at a</p>
<p>mirror so long that like</p>
<p>distorts well that&rsquo;s the troxler</p>
<p>effect that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the bloody mary situation what is that called</p>
<p>the troxler</p>
<p>effect troxler</p>
<p>you just stare at something long enough that</p>
<p>things get distorted</p>
<p>or blurry or you just</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just an</p>
<p>effect of your mind that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a paranormal it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an optical illusion</p>
<p>yes yeah yeah and so i think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because your</p>
<p>brain starts filling in missing information</p>
<p>right yeah that</p>
<p>always kind of</p>
<p>throws me off a little bit</p>
<p>about this kind of</p>
<p>thing especially</p>
<p>if you are scrying in a</p>
<p>mirror yeah</p>
<p>oh yeah can you imagine if you&rsquo;re trying to scry</p>
<p>and see the future and then bloody mary shows up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like oh my god</p>
<p>girl i didn&rsquo;t ask for you to be here wrong game</p>
<p>yeah oh my gosh</p>
<p>yeah so i wonder that too</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure that</p>
<p>would have some sort of hallucinogenic</p>
<p>like effect</p>
<p>if you were staring into a</p>
<p>mirror for long</p>
<p>enough or a crystal ball for that matter</p>
<p>but if you do want to use a crystal ball effectively</p>
<p>i think we maybe</p>
<p>spoke too soon with our</p>
<p>have it on your ring</p>
<p>idea because you&rsquo;re supposed to use a ball that&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>least the size of an orange or a grapefruit</p>
<p>oh okay so i</p>
<p>think crystal b definitely</p>
<p>fits the bill here</p>
<p>mm hmm i would say she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hefty enough she&rsquo;s certainly the size of at</p>
<p>least a pamelo you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>am i wrong she&rsquo;s at least the size of my big</p>
<p>ol head so i think oh but yep i think that</p>
<p>checks the box so i think you&rsquo;re good to use crystal</p>
<p>i think so too</p>
<p>your crystal ball should be highly</p>
<p>reflective i would say she&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>reflective she&rsquo;s shiny as can be so she&rsquo;s polished</p>
<p>yeah you need to sit in a calm</p>
<p>quiet place your</p>
<p>girlfriends out of town you have the</p>
<p>place to yourself you could</p>
<p>do some scrying</p>
<p>i beg to differ there is construction abound</p>
<p>all over me so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right they are roofing at your house so maybe</p>
<p>maybe not maybe i&rsquo;ll go sit in my car and rock a little</p>
<p>and then maybe use the crystal ball</p>
<p>and you need to</p>
<p>allow your mind and eyes to relax so</p>
<p>again just kind of getting into that</p>
<p>right mental state</p>
<p>modern day scriers</p>
<p>say crystal balls may or may not give</p>
<p>you visions of the future or offer advice instead it</p>
<p>might reflect</p>
<p>symbols or direct you to make good</p>
<p>decisions for the future so this is more subjective</p>
<p>it reminds me</p>
<p>of taro a little bit like you make of it what you</p>
<p>think it is or what the symbol</p>
<p>speaks to you directly</p>
<p>well i also wonder again</p>
<p>i kind of said this</p>
<p>earlier but</p>
<p>the skeptical side of me</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s considered the skeptical side or just like</p>
<p>in agreement with what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>right now but</p>
<p>i feel like if you take away all distractions</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>alone with your mind</p>
<p>some pretty</p>
<p>obvious things come up that you usually</p>
<p>might be ignoring</p>
<p>like i feel like</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re ever</p>
<p>alone by yourself like</p>
<p>there have been times</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>using this example but like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve sat in</p>
<p>a hot tub by</p>
<p>myself and there&rsquo;s nothing to do but just sit there and</p>
<p>think and all of a</p>
<p>sudden i have</p>
<p>these realizations</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i feel like all i did was five</p>
<p>seconds of silence my brain</p>
<p>was banging</p>
<p>yeah your subconscious</p>
<p>was like banging on your</p>
<p>brain yeah so</p>
<p>they let me in</p>
<p>i feel like maybe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what crystal balls</p>
<p>allow you to do they give you an excuse to like</p>
<p>take away all distractions and then i wonder if</p>
<p>in a world of social</p>
<p>media where</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m used to</p>
<p>blocking my</p>
<p>brain from giving</p>
<p>me realizations</p>
<p>i wonder if</p>
<p>the more distracted we are as</p>
<p>humanity as a people</p>
<p>i wonder if the</p>
<p>second we let ourselves look into a crystal ball for</p>
<p>five minutes if we&rsquo;re gonna all</p>
<p>start having these</p>
<p>i wonder how</p>
<p>powerful people are gonna</p>
<p>think they are just because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking five minutes to themselves well that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>point and i</p>
<p>think the power of</p>
<p>meditation comes into play there too because</p>
<p>when you do</p>
<p>meditate and you</p>
<p>start to actually get pretty okay at it</p>
<p>which obviously it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>habit and it&rsquo;s hard to do but like</p>
<p>it is really really difficult to shut off your mind</p>
<p>and once you do you&rsquo;re like what on</p>
<p>earth is going on up there like it really</p>
<p>intends to surprise you talk</p>
<p>about a lawless land that&rsquo;s all up here</p>
<p>the outlaws are all coming to play</p>
<p>but i also think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right that a crystal ball if you&rsquo;re in a meditative</p>
<p>state it&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>least something to stare at to focus on</p>
<p>you know rather than just like</p>
<p>focus on a spot</p>
<p>on the wall</p>
<p>and then you can like kind of get distracted at</p>
<p>least a crystal ball is something like clear</p>
<p>that you can just stare at without</p>
<p>interaction</p>
<p>literally clear yeah so i don&rsquo;t know i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a really good</p>
<p>point and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s probably not even a skeptical point</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>kind of diving into how it</p>
<p>might work yeah</p>
<p>up next meet some of the most</p>
<p>famous crystal gazers in history and</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll reflect on our futures while we&rsquo;re at it a</p>
<p>also i don&rsquo;t reflect</p>
<p>i know right good one good one wink</p>
<p>well with any</p>
<p>area of spiritualism there are some people that made</p>
<p>a name for themselves</p>
<p>so the first person i want to tell you</p>
<p>about is american</p>
<p>claude conlan</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard of this person</p>
<p>but he performed as</p>
<p>alexander the man</p>
<p>who knows okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m am the person who naps</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m christine the person who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really know most of the time</p>
<p>and this was between 1915 and 1924</p>
<p>and i only know of this phrase because i&rsquo;ve gone gift</p>
<p>shopping and you and i have very different ways of</p>
<p>going or no not different but different</p>
<p>maybe from the rest of the planet ways of</p>
<p>we get really into gift giving and gift</p>
<p>shopping and</p>
<p>i have a couple times notated that there</p>
<p>are posters like old timey posters that say alexander</p>
<p>the man who knows and that&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s name and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve a couple times thought you know that</p>
<p>would be kind of a</p>
<p>fun gift idea if i</p>
<p>found like a vintage poster</p>
<p>especially because he loves to know he</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s his favorite</p>
<p>thing he loves to know</p>
<p>so that actually works really well for him it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>as his sibling my</p>
<p>least favorite thing but</p>
<p>it is one of</p>
<p>his favorite hobbies you know he loves his trivia</p>
<p>night he loves fun fact</p>
<p>he loves information</p>
<p>loves it loves the</p>
<p>stuff so i think that</p>
<p>could be a cool gift idea</p>
<p>there is a little bit of a problematic part of this</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;ll tell you in a moment but so</p>
<p>claude conlan</p>
<p>aka alexander the man who knows was a</p>
<p>stage mentalist</p>
<p>who used the crystal ball to</p>
<p>magically answer</p>
<p>sealed questions from audience members that was</p>
<p>his kind of</p>
<p>party trick</p>
<p>i love a good</p>
<p>mentalist i know it&rsquo;s probably all</p>
<p>stage illusions</p>
<p>but i can&rsquo;t figure it out and i&rsquo;m fascinated</p>
<p>every time i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming in this case it was probably</p>
<p>a plants from the audience</p>
<p>only alexander would know</p>
<p>only alexander</p>
<p>and he does</p>
<p>and he does so here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it becomes a little problematic so clawed</p>
<p>culturally appropriated sort of</p>
<p>recognizable eastern</p>
<p>cultural garments to</p>
<p>capitalize on</p>
<p>this stereotype that was common in the west</p>
<p>of like this mystical other</p>
<p>from different parts of the</p>
<p>world so he wore a turban</p>
<p>that kind of</p>
<p>thing and used that</p>
<p>as a sort of like</p>
<p>ooh i&rsquo;m this mysterious figure from the</p>
<p>east and obviously</p>
<p>we know now that is</p>
<p>wildly insensitive</p>
<p>and inappropriate</p>
<p>yeah alexander the man who exploits let&rsquo;s yes</p>
<p>ding ding ding yeah yeah yeah good one</p>
<p>m thank you</p>
<p>thank you unfortunately</p>
<p>but unsurprisingly he thrived as this character yeah</p>
<p>then this is more your</p>
<p>speed there&rsquo;s this woman</p>
<p>named jean dixon have you</p>
<p>heard of her</p>
<p>mm hmm okay you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna probably want to</p>
<p>cover her someday</p>
<p>because oh this is</p>
<p>pretty interesting she was a</p>
<p>psychic who used her crystal ball to make political</p>
<p>predictions during the 20th century</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>in 1956 she correctly predicted kennedy&rsquo;s assassination</p>
<p>whoa which by the way</p>
<p>seems like a dangerous</p>
<p>thing to be doing like</p>
<p>i feel like yeah</p>
<p>fbi or the cia</p>
<p>would be like</p>
<p>we have a few questions for you that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where like you say i knew</p>
<p>after the fact but like 20 years later</p>
<p>yeah you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give that out and then say see i told you yeah i i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>shocked that nobody</p>
<p>first of all nobody who</p>
<p>would have tried to save him</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>like why didn&rsquo;t you help us do that and prevent his</p>
<p>death but then</p>
<p>as the conspiracy goes</p>
<p>like why wouldn&rsquo;t any of</p>
<p>those people try to shut her up you know yep</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to say</p>
<p>but instead of shutting her up she actually</p>
<p>advised richard nixon</p>
<p>and also nancy reagan and so she became a political</p>
<p>advisor of sorts</p>
<p>oh my god what is with this</p>
<p>town loving</p>
<p>their spiritualists</p>
<p>but then also poo pooing on them but</p>
<p>with all that</p>
<p>swamp gas coming up from dc</p>
<p>swamps you know it&rsquo;s like what is</p>
<p>going on their</p>
<p>brains are getting</p>
<p>altered while the lizard people are</p>
<p>just down there just pulling the strings don&rsquo;t you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably it</p>
<p>so after jean dixon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death her crystal ball was auctioned off for 12 000</p>
<p>whoa that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of cash</p>
<p>a lot of cash and i wonder after our</p>
<p>death how much miss crystal will be auctioned off for</p>
<p>like she&rsquo;ll be on</p>
<p>clearance i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>40 cents at marshall&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>sorry crystal</p>
<p>you know we love you</p>
<p>right the day we both die crystal&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna explode into several shards and like</p>
<p>all the evil energy will finally be at peace</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;ll be released</p>
<p>upon the world</p>
<p>luckily we won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be here enough to deal with it yeah exactly</p>
<p>so speaking of crystal balls</p>
<p>in person if you want to see one like an actual one</p>
<p>the smithsonian institution owns the largest</p>
<p>flawless quartz crystal ball in the world</p>
<p>but almost there</p>
<p>but yeah so it was cut and polished in</p>
<p>china during the 1920s</p>
<p>and it weighs 106</p>
<p>75 pounds whoa</p>
<p>you know it</p>
<p>might not be as big as you</p>
<p>picture and i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s because i</p>
<p>kind of forget it&rsquo;s not just glass it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pure quartz</p>
<p>the fact that it has no imperfections makes it mmm</p>
<p>really rare</p>
<p>but it is i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you can see me it&rsquo;s sort of like</p>
<p>that big oh my god</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s like oh how</p>
<p>would you describe</p>
<p>the size of it to people who can&rsquo;t see you yeah i</p>
<p>guess doing it in the</p>
<p>video camera is not helpful to anybody um i</p>
<p>think they said it was probably</p>
<p>i would say like a foot wide i don&rsquo;t know okay</p>
<p>i mean like</p>
<p>like a globe</p>
<p>like globe size like a globe size</p>
<p>maybe let me see it would</p>
<p>shock me more if</p>
<p>that crystal ball had to be big to be</p>
<p>heavy i i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these things are</p>
<p>dead suckers</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>point so it&rsquo;s ten inches</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s not even a foot not</p>
<p>even a foot so i was overestimating</p>
<p>but yeah so it&rsquo;s pretty big but the fact</p>
<p>again that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pure quartz crystal and</p>
<p>has no imperfections and it really is just like fully</p>
<p>see through and it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>so yes she weighs</p>
<p>106 75 and you can look that up online there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>photo then the</p>
<p>university of pennsylvania&rsquo;s</p>
<p>museum of archaeology and anthropology owns the</p>
<p>third largest crystal ball in the world</p>
<p>which weighs 49</p>
<p>pounds and i can only assume we own the</p>
<p>second heaviest</p>
<p>because that one&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>listed that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking yeah</p>
<p>she certainly feels like a million</p>
<p>pounds so i feel like everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually coming in behind us but yeah</p>
<p>every time we pay that overweight luggage fee</p>
<p>i feel like it hurts a little but you know</p>
<p>all for this crystal ball to do nothing</p>
<p>except look pretty on stage</p>
<p>and boy does she do a good job of it by the</p>
<p>way she does a great job</p>
<p>many crystal</p>
<p>balls are important and valuable because of</p>
<p>their associations i mean this reminds me of</p>
<p>the sylvia plath</p>
<p>tarot cards for example</p>
<p>or the jean dixon</p>
<p>crystal ball that you know they</p>
<p>are valuable because of their</p>
<p>who they were associated with right so</p>
<p>the crystal ball used by the wicked</p>
<p>witch of the west in the wizard of</p>
<p>oz for example sold for</p>
<p>126 000 at an auction</p>
<p>in 2011 wow</p>
<p>yeah so i wonder</p>
<p>i wonder if that one was</p>
<p>glass or crystal</p>
<p>or green screen</p>
<p>or not real can you imagine you</p>
<p>bid 126 000</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like oh cgi sorry</p>
<p>and the official</p>
<p>scepter of scotland</p>
<p>includes a crystal ball</p>
<p>and this crystal ball is believed to have been owned by</p>
<p>ancient druids you know the ones who are in the woods</p>
<p>doing all their cool fashion alert</p>
<p>fashion alert</p>
<p>in a scepter</p>
<p>are you kidding me how badass is that can you imagine</p>
<p>first of all getting to</p>
<p>carry a scepter for your job but also a</p>
<p>druid owned crystal balls that&rsquo;s on top of it</p>
<p>how much money do you</p>
<p>think that thing costs</p>
<p>that is probably</p>
<p>priceless but</p>
<p>priceless i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>so do you feel like you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>try crystal</p>
<p>crystal b within</p>
<p>seconds of hanging up with you yeah</p>
<p>you are oh my gosh i can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very excited i</p>
<p>still wonder how much of it is</p>
<p>legit but i do</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s mainly mind over matter</p>
<p>which i feel like that&rsquo;s how i end a lot of these</p>
<p>i think intentions and</p>
<p>your mindset are just like</p>
<p>big parts to all of</p>
<p>these elements we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about i 100</p>
<p>agree yeah i do</p>
<p>wonder if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>maybe just a</p>
<p>great way to meditate</p>
<p>and if that&rsquo;s all that happens then</p>
<p>at least like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still getting some clarity on maybe</p>
<p>things you needed to let yourself sit down and think on</p>
<p>honestly it</p>
<p>might be just a really</p>
<p>good tool and i&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>knock it i&rsquo;m just saying i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>agreeing like</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s just a really good tool</p>
<p>to help get into that</p>
<p>kind of third eye</p>
<p>space and maybe</p>
<p>i should get my own crystal bee over here and practice</p>
<p>oh next time</p>
<p>we see each</p>
<p>other i&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>transfer her to you you can take care of her</p>
<p>until we go on</p>
<p>stage and then you can deal with her with the</p>
<p>tsa no if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ready for that kind of commitment</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>happy with you it seems</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having a</p>
<p>blast over here we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to have a</p>
<p>whole day together</p>
<p>after this how fun well i feel like we&rsquo;ve</p>
