    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>My stance really took over the comment board.</p>
<p>Yeah, Saks, how was your week off when you gave up on the pod for a week and then did</p>
<p>four media appearances for 90 minutes each on other pods? You did six hours of pod. You took</p>
<p>off from this pod to give your ratings to Megyn Kelly and Dave Rubin.</p>
<p>Yeah, I did a 45 minute hit with Dave Rubin on Ukraine. So be sure to check that out. And then</p>
<p>yeah, did I do? No, Megyn, Megyn Kelly, Freeberg and I did that the week before.</p>
<p>Was that this week? Okay.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, she didn&rsquo;t invite you back.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know what could have happened. It was so great. It was so great. That was</p>
<p>awesome. I love Megyn Kelly.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t she call you a prick?</p>
<p>Yeah, she did. She did. And she only knew me for 45 minutes. Usually that takes like</p>
<p>three or four days. She just got right to it.</p>
<p>Saks, we have not had such negative panning comments on YouTube since J. Cal got brigadooned</p>
<p>for his pro Ukraine rhetoric a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Not getting brigadooned for Saks not showing up. I get brigadooned for asking him a question.</p>
<p>Then I get brigadooned from him not showing up.</p>
<p>So maybe you&rsquo;re not getting brigadooned. I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe it&rsquo;s just honest commentary.</p>
<p>When will you guys realize that there are three to five million people a week that listen to</p>
<p>this podcast? 100 nitwits who comment on YouTube. They&rsquo;re neither right nor wrong.</p>
<p>They should just be completely ignored.</p>
<p>Turn the comments off.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters are the ratings if you care about that at all. And last week</p>
<p>was one of the best rated shows we&rsquo;ve ever done.</p>
<p>I think it was highest rated after Elon&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>It would have been even better with David. So we should brigadoon the brigadooners.</p>
<p>Those nitwits should be ignored.</p>
<p>I think this is a little bit like a band where you can&rsquo;t mess with the chemistry of the band.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the lesson.</p>
<p>Even though there&rsquo;s a lot of infighting in the band.</p>
<p>It just works.</p>
<p>It works. And so you don&rsquo;t want to second guess it too much.</p>
<p>And then if somebody from the band gets sick and somebody sits in,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s like you get some incredible guitar players sit in, people are like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the guitar player who I have the t-shirt of. I need my guitar player back.</p>
<p>All right. Anyway, well, I&rsquo;m just glad Ringo showed up 22 minutes late.</p>
<p>Welcome back, Freeberg. Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry. I don&rsquo;t mean to fuck with the band. I&rsquo;m not going to fuck with the band.</p>
<p>Ringo was an underrated drummer. Freeberg, you have a role here. That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re more like the drummer of J-Cal.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m the-</p>
<p>Freeberg, maybe bass, maybe bass player.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m John Lennon of this group.</p>
<p>George Harrison, George Harrison.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, George Harrison, very underrated, but I, you know, I&rsquo;m pretty clear.</p>
<p>Have you guys ever heard the version of Blackbird that Paul McCartney did,</p>
<p>just with a ukulele?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;d like to hear that.</p>
<p>Maybe one of the best songs ever recorded. One of the best records I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>All right, listen, there&rsquo;s so much to start with, but I think-</p>
<p>Blackbird swimming in the dead of night.</p>
<p>Take these broken wings and learn to fly.</p>
<p>All sax life.</p>
<p>Sax, were you at a building on Market Street yesterday by any chance?</p>
<p>No fly zone.</p>
<p>The homeless shelter?</p>
<p>Well, I think you&rsquo;re talking about abandoned homeless shelter.</p>
<p>Freeberg, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that there will be a lot of people</p>
<p>that we know that will go and help make Market Street better.</p>
<p>Make Market Street great again.</p>
<p>Make Market Street great again.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to some tofu salads and meditation.</p>
<p>Namaste.</p>
<p>Literally, I think 8,000 square feet is meditation rooms that haven&rsquo;t been used in five years.</p>
<p>Quite honestly, though, like on the other side of this, I would say Parag Agrawal</p>
<p>does deserve a statue for shareholder value creation.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>What 54.20 a share, which by the way, we said was going to happen and it did happen,</p>
<p>was ginormous in this market.</p>
<p>And I just want to see the look on that barista&rsquo;s face when they&rsquo;re warming up the oat milk.</p>
<p>Haha, when a band of very, very tough knuckled company builders walks through that door.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Oatly has left the building.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just leave it at that.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So I guess we can talk about it now.</p>
<p>Elon has closed the deal.</p>
<p>I guess we can talk about it now.</p>
<p>Well, no, I&rsquo;m just saying Saks and I could not talk about this because we had,</p>
<p>you know, we couldn&rsquo;t talk about it for legal reasons.</p>
<p>They deserve a statue in front of the bronze statue for shareholder value creation</p>
<p>in front of that Twitter building.</p>
<p>Best tech CEO of the year, Parag Agrawal.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>So your theory is that he did such a bad job in terms of suppressing viewpoints and censorship</p>
<p>that he actually induced Elon to want to buy the company so he could fix their censorship problem.</p>
<p>No, my theory, my theory is simpler than this, which is they got great representation</p>
<p>to do a very bulletproof deal.</p>
<p>And it turns out that contract law still matters in the United States.</p>
<p>And Elon did the right thing and just said, you know what, I&rsquo;m going to own this thing</p>
<p>and probably double or triple my money.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to go and do it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll do it for the benefit of everybody else.</p>
<p>But my point is more that they and the board had the wherewithal to fight because, you know,</p>
<p>that they could have easily gotten intimidated and capitulated.</p>
<p>And in doing that, whether they were right or wrong or good or bad is irrelevant to me.</p>
<p>They represented shareholder values well, and they got shareholders paid in a moment</p>
<p>where the stock market is still down 20, 30, 40%, where big tech is down 50%.</p>
<p>Some of these big tech companies are down 80%.</p>
<p>These guys sold the company at a premium.</p>
<p>And so that just, you know, we just have to acknowledge that that happened.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>I wanted to just give you a little bit of background on Twitter.</p>
<p>Historically, you know, in 2013, the stock was trading at $69.</p>
<p>And it got sold for 54.</p>
<p>Like this company has been sideways for a decade, essentially, in terms of its market</p>
<p>cap.</p>
<p>And so but there&rsquo;s no doubt that I think Elon can turn this around pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And to make it massively profitable, I think and clean up the bot problem.</p>
<p>Very quickly.</p>
<p>If you can land two rockets at a time, create self driving cars, I think you can figure</p>
<p>this out.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t rocket science.</p>
<p>And Elon&rsquo;s done rocket science.</p>
<p>So I think he&rsquo;s going to figure it out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, for what it&rsquo;s worth, I think Elon&rsquo;s really excited about it.</p>
<p>And there is tremendous potential at Twitter.</p>
<p>I mean, the company&rsquo;s been sideways because it hasn&rsquo;t done that much in 10 years.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so much you can do with that product.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, there&rsquo;s a ton of potential.</p>
<p>I think the best way to think about it is he bought a quarter of a billion mouths for</p>
<p>$44 billion.</p>
<p>And in the grand scheme of things, that is, I think going to turn out to be pretty reasonably</p>
<p>cheap, especially if he can layer in a few of his bigger ideas.</p>
<p>And and I think that those mouths, the value of those monthly active users could probably</p>
<p>double or triple pretty quickly, right?</p>
<p>I think that was the so I just sent you guys this link from this analyst.</p>
<p>And he said that Twitter was bought at $172 per monthly active user compared to $81 per</p>
<p>monthly active user at Meta, where they sit today.</p>
<p>So but that&rsquo;s but that&rsquo;s for a very different point, which we can double click into because</p>
<p>Meta is its own bag of, you know, it&rsquo;s a little bit of an unfortunately, you know, a bit of</p>
<p>attached to it.</p>
<p>Well, and I&rsquo;ll explain why because the Meta problem is, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a deep and a very dangerous</p>
<p>situation that they&rsquo;ve put themselves in, which is why their mal values are this low.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you had done this analysis a few years ago, the trade was looking at</p>
<p>Meta&rsquo;s mal values being so high, where you would have said, why isn&rsquo;t Twitter doing more?</p>
<p>So I know that this, this is a little bit, in my opinion, cherry picking.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think making everything verified in a path to verification, which Ilan has talked</p>
<p>about publicly many times and payments, you know, he&rsquo;s talked about publicly many times,</p>
<p>just those two things alone, could make the experience of being on Twitter.</p>
<p>Absolutely delightful.</p>
<p>If everybody could verify themselves, this thing could turn around so quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;ll say what you&rsquo;re saying in a slightly more I think the most powerful change</p>
<p>that Twitter could make today is there are two classes of users, people who are verified</p>
<p>real world identity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And people who want to stay anonymous.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>There is 100% distribution fire hose for people who are real.</p>
<p>And there is a fire hose for fake people or fake names that you need to pay to amplify.</p>
<p>Just that one simple change will cut through all the nonsense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because if you want to see where the money is being spent, you will be able to see very</p>
<p>quickly because otherwise, there&rsquo;ll be virtually no distribution for anonymous fake people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll force those people if they really want to be heard that and that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>valuable to say to spend against it.</p>
<p>This really is about the Brigadoons.</p>
<p>And Ilan&rsquo;s been very clear about this, you know, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to get rid of the bots.</p>
<p>And if people are opting in to putting themselves into the top class of verified users, well,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a revenue stream, right?</p>
<p>And so all of a sudden, you know, I don&rsquo;t know how many millions of people would instantly</p>
<p>say, I&rsquo;ll pay for this for five or 10 bucks a month to be verified.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And I think like what we want to do is like, you know, no offense to all the people out</p>
<p>there, although I don&rsquo;t really care, but no offense, but you cannot use Twitter as a coping</p>
<p>mechanism.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Like, I get that life is hard or that, you know, life hasn&rsquo;t lived out to your expectations</p>
<p>or, you know, there&rsquo;s envy and whatever of other people, but to go out there and spew</p>
<p>hate doesn&rsquo;t solve anything.</p>
<p>Are you talking about the Brigadoons?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also just a lot of people that are just in general.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, they&rsquo;re just mean.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you a perfect example.</p>
<p>There was a woman that I saw on TikTok, and she&rsquo;s like, you know, been married for 13</p>
<p>years, mother of two kids.</p>
<p>And she was, she had a thing that went viral where she was talking about who&rsquo;s in charge,</p>
<p>her or her husband.</p>
<p>And it was a very funny little thing.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve followed a couple of her videos just to see what else she had posted.</p>
<p>And one of the videos was how she has some complicated health issues, which she was very</p>
<p>public about PCOS and how it causes, you know, issues in losing weight.</p>
<p>And she posted a pre and post picture of her, which takes a lot of courage.</p>
<p>And she was like, Brigadoon.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what is wrong with these broken people that have to give this woman a hard</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>And it just it took so to me, these social media channels are not coping mechanisms,</p>
<p>they were never meant to be.</p>
<p>And so, you know, if they have to go to 4chan or 8chan or Reddit or whatever, better to</p>
<p>sort of create these honeypots of hatred than to have it spew everywhere, because it makes</p>
<p>for the rest of us these platforms to be unusable.</p>
<p>Well, Saks, you were the CEO of PayPal with Elon and Roloff and TL and everybody in that</p>
<p>crew over 20 years ago, and verified you understand pretty well, because you yourself have been</p>
<p>Brigadooned of late.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve experienced this firsthand, the psychological torture that made you take a</p>
<p>week off from the show, in fact, because you were so under duress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kidding, you had a planned week off, you&rsquo;re allowed to have a vacation.</p>
<p>Which of the two ideas is the bigger idea payments, making Twitter into PayPal, including</p>
<p>that x.com, which was the original name of that was Elon&rsquo;s payment company, and he owns</p>
<p>a domain x.com.</p>
<p>Which is a bigger idea, the payments, or the verification, which is the bigger idea for</p>
<p>increasing shareholder value, which would you do first?</p>
<p>I mean, payments is an entire roadmap, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot that could be done there.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s about, I mean, you could layer on a lot of services on top of that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like one feature.</p>
<p>Look, I think they&rsquo;re both compelling in terms of where they could lead.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s amazing about Elon as an entrepreneur is he always starts with a mission, and then</p>
<p>he figures out how to turn it into a great product and a great business.</p>
<p>So, for example, with SpaceX, the mission was to get to Mars to make life multi-planetary.</p>
<p>You would think that&rsquo;d be a spectacularly unprofitable business.</p>
<p>But in the course of pursuing that mission, he figured out the launch business.</p>
<p>And then the satellite business was Starlink.</p>
<p>And I think Starlink is going to be a phenomenal business.</p>
<p>Phenomenal.</p>
<p>And likewise with Tesla, he started with the mission of moving the world to sustainable</p>
<p>energy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And in the process of doing that, he created the world&rsquo;s best car, not just the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>best electric car, but I just think it&rsquo;s the best car in the world.</p>
<p>And Tesla is this amazing business today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so far ahead of every other car company.</p>
<p>So, look, I think what&rsquo;s cool about what Elon is doing is he&rsquo;s starting with this mission</p>
<p>of restoring Twitter to being a free speech platform, of being the town square it was</p>
<p>always meant to be.</p>
<p>And in the process of doing that, he&rsquo;s going to figure out how to make Twitter into an</p>
<p>even better product and into a great business, which it&rsquo;s not today.</p>
<p>I think Twitter is losing a few hundred million dollars a quarter.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s work to do on all those fronts.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s really impressive to see.</p>
<p>And, you know, he&rsquo;s still operating at the top of his game.</p>
<p>I mean, 20 years after PayPal, some of us are just doing a podcast, but he&rsquo;s still like</p>
<p>operating at the top of his game.</p>
<p>Some of us are exhausted.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re tired, but&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re tired and he&rsquo;s like working 16 hour days.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been leveling up for 20 years.</p>
<p>And at this point, he&rsquo;s like a level 99 mage or something.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s like a crazy&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to see.</p>
<p>Freeberg, the biggest issue I perceive in the short term for Twitter is going to be</p>
<p>what to do with people like Trump and Kanye West or Ye.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s all going to seem like Elon is making those decisions as an individual,</p>
<p>as opposed to for the platform, etc.</p>
<p>Should he let somebody like Kanye West, I&rsquo;m sorry, Ye, as he likes to call himself, who</p>
<p>was in the middle of an obvious manic episode back on the platform?</p>
<p>Should he let Trump back on the platform?</p>
<p>How do you think he should handle those two polarizing individuals specifically?</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I think this is what&rsquo;s going to be really interesting to watch, because</p>
<p>there have been very successful, very inspirational, very intelligent, very creative entrepreneurs</p>
<p>that have started and built generally kind of open platforms at the beginning, only to</p>
<p>over time be challenged with the content that doesn&rsquo;t feel appropriate.</p>
<p>And then they come back and they make the necessary kind of moderation guidelines and</p>
<p>they make the necessary edits to the way the platform operates.</p>
<p>This is how Google operated originally, you know, and then they ended up saying, you know</p>
<p>what, if we&rsquo;re going to be in China, we do have to create a censored version of the internet.</p>
<p>And they did that.</p>
<p>And that was controversial.</p>
<p>With YouTube, they&rsquo;ve got a lot of censoring.</p>
<p>And it was supposed to be just a generally open platform for anyone to use.</p>
<p>And they were even&hellip;</p>
<p>Larry and Sergey were kind of flouting DMCA at the beginning.</p>
<p>And they were like, it&rsquo;s not our job to monitor copyright.</p>
<p>You have to file a takedown notice.</p>
<p>And they kind of waved their hands in the air.</p>
<p>Over time, they realized that that could actually damage and completely ruin the platform.</p>
<p>And they had to go in and create guidelines and moderation systems.</p>
<p>And the same was true of Ev and Jack at Twitter.</p>
<p>The same was true of the founders at Reddit.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you guys, you know, remember that period of time when Ellen Pao was CEO of</p>
<p>Reddit, and she went in and cleaned up a lot of the bullying and harassment and nastiness that</p>
<p>was going on on Reddit.</p>
<p>And she got a lot of controversy for why are you closing it down?</p>
<p>Why are you censoring it?</p>
<p>Elon is a reasonable person.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s going to be faced with unreasonable people on this platform.</p>
<p>And when that happens, he&rsquo;s going to have very tough decisions to make about what kind</p>
<p>of platform he wants to have, what&rsquo;s the quality of that platform gonna need to look like.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, he&rsquo;s gonna have to look in the mirror and say, did I step</p>
<p>on the wrong side?</p>
<p>And, you know, he&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s idealistic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>And I hope that he&rsquo;s successful.</p>
<p>But to some degree, some amount of moderation is going to be necessary to create a high</p>
<p>quality product.</p>
<p>Would you allow?</p>
<p>Would you if you were in charge yourself?</p>
<p>Freeberg?</p>
<p>Would you put Trump back on the platform?</p>
<p>And under what circumstances?</p>
<p>And would you allow something like Kanye West back on the platform?</p>
<p>At some point?</p>
<p>Yeah, you personally?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, my content moderation guidelines, I, you know, it&rsquo;s, it gets very nuanced very</p>
<p>quick.</p>
<p>What do you allow people to say?</p>
<p>What do you not allow them to say?</p>
<p>And then if they violate them, is there the opportunity for a lifetime ban?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone should have a lifetime ban on these platforms.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m totally</p>
<p>Would you do that for Kanye West, who has been saying crazy anti semitic stuff, which</p>
<p>has real world danger, that&rsquo;s already started to spill over where people are putting up</p>
<p>banners like Kanye&rsquo;s what right about the Jews, and they&rsquo;re putting up banners like</p>
<p>over the, you know, 10 freeway, as you may have seen in Los Angeles, how would you deal</p>
<p>with Kanye specifically in a manic anti semitic episode that he&rsquo;s been?</p>
<p>Look, I think the question is anyone that&rsquo;s saying anything racist, or, you know, whatever</p>
<p>might be deemed kind of to fall in that category.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tagging mechanism, you have to figure out how to create the tagging mechanism.</p>
<p>Based on that tagging mechanism, the default is it&rsquo;s like when you go to Google, and you</p>
<p>search for stuff, they exclude porn.</p>
<p>So all porn content that&rsquo;s indexed on Google&rsquo;s index servers is indexes porn, and it&rsquo;s default</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a safe search thing, you got to turn, I think, off or something to access stuff</p>
<p>that Google deems inappropriate.</p>
<p>Sorry, how do you how do you how do you do that?</p>
<p>No, but I think, and by the way, I&rsquo;ll tell you, when I worked at Google, we used to have</p>
<p>pizza weekends, where you would go into the office on the weekends, they give you free</p>
<p>pizza, and everyone would tag, you&rsquo;d watch porn, and you would tag porn.</p>
<p>And so you basically go through the indexing servers, they show you images and Google images,</p>
<p>and you click porn or not porn.</p>
<p>And it was just like, hey, come and volunteer, come and help us do it.</p>
<p>And there was all these engineers sitting in the friggin cafeteria tagging porn.</p>
<p>But actually, you know, that happened to sacks.</p>
<p>And he saw Tucker Carlson.</p>
<p>And he said, Yeah, that&rsquo;s porn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, I think, for Yes, I think, I think, yes, I think the same mechanism is</p>
<p>needed on these social networks, which is that you have to figure out what you have</p>
<p>to figure out a way to use AI to tag content.</p>
<p>And think about them as cable.</p>
<p>Just let me finish for one second, you think about them as cable, cable stations on a cable</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re the cable company.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different stations.</p>
<p>And you as a user decide, what do you not want to opt into?</p>
<p>And what do you want to opt into?</p>
<p>What content do you want to exclude from your version and your experience of Twitter?</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re okay with the stuff Kanye says, you&rsquo;re okay with the stuff Trump says, you</p>
<p>can keep that stuff in.</p>
<p>If you want to exclude that type of content, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s excluded for you.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what Twitter ultimately has to become.</p>
<p>What do you think Chamath?</p>
<p>Would you put Trump back on the platform?</p>
<p>And seeing, you know, Kanye West having this manic episode and saying, you know, basically</p>
<p>participating in hate speech explicitly?</p>
<p>How would you handle those two specific instances in 2022 going into 2023?</p>
<p>I think that there has to be a way where nobody is banned forever.</p>
<p>Okay, I think that when somebody is banned temporarily, they can be banned for any reason</p>
<p>that violates a term of service that&rsquo;s well understood and uniformly enforced.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the right of a private company.</p>
<p>But there has to be a way to get back on.</p>
<p>In the case of both of these folks, there should be a way to basically, you know, have</p>
<p>because of the step, the quantity of their reach, some sort of almost like tribunal or,</p>
<p>you know, mediator that can understand what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Because if somebody is going through a manic episode, it&rsquo;s absolutely right to turn that</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>I mean, these guys should have turned him off much, much sooner.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re in the middle of a mania, and I said this last week, like, you know,</p>
<p>like, for example, like this, this relative of mine, when they&rsquo;re in a manic episode,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 60 7080 emails a day and text messages 100 texts that I get.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re, honestly, they&rsquo;re vile.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t even remember them half the time, they don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>And, and, you know, they go through paranoia, they go through mania, they go through these</p>
<p>periods where they think they&rsquo;re completely right.</p>
<p>They go through these periods where they look completely sane and normal.</p>
<p>So, so the most important thing, when you have a family member in mental health crisis</p>
<p>is to get the phone away from them.</p>
<p>That is a weapon that only continues the loop and to re regulate this person.</p>
<p>And then there should be a way to prove that you&rsquo;re back in a re regulated state</p>
<p>to get these tools back.</p>
<p>But I think that that needs to, we just need to acknowledge that there&rsquo;s just a lot of</p>
<p>people with mental health issues.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of social media, there&rsquo;s a lot of damage that can be done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to forgive these people.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s to explain that in moments, you got to shut these channels down, and then</p>
<p>give them a way to come back when they&rsquo;ve re regulated.</p>
<p>sacks, how do you think about it?</p>
<p>Well, with regard to Trump, I don&rsquo;t know what the continuing reason is for him not</p>
<p>being allowed on the platform.</p>
<p>Remember that when he was banned, it was considered to be a temporary measure, because</p>
<p>he was supposedly inciting a riot, right?</p>
<p>So I think incitement to violence is legitimate grounds for taking down speech.</p>
<p>But once that breach of the peace is over, I don&rsquo;t know why it would become a permanent</p>
<p>ban as opposed to a timeout.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t even know how the companies continue to justify the ban on Trump, except for the</p>
<p>fact that they just think that he&rsquo;s a threat to democracy.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s for social networks to determine is that who gets to</p>
<p>participate in our political process.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily the first thing I would do.</p>
<p>But do I think that Trump should be allowed back?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>With regard to Kanye, it&rsquo;s a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Because like you&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s hard to know whether he&rsquo;s having a manic episode,</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s just, you know, being Kanye, what he&rsquo;s saying right now is probably not in his</p>
<p>own interest, and probably it would be in his best interest to have a timeout.</p>
<p>But what I would look for guidance here is there is a Supreme Court decision.</p>
<p>And my general view on the content moderation is that these social networking companies</p>
<p>should be looking for inspiration to Supreme Court decisions, because the Supreme Court&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been wrestling with these issues for hundreds of years, whereas social networks are just</p>
<p>making it up as they go along.</p>
<p>And there are nine major categories of speech that the Supreme Court has said are not protected,</p>
<p>because they actually are dangerous speech.</p>
<p>So, for example, in this decision called Chaplinsky versus New Hampshire, which came</p>
<p>out in 1942, the Supreme Court held that so called fighting words were not protected.</p>
<p>And they define fighting words as speech that tends to incite an immediate breach of the</p>
<p>peace through the use of, quote, personally abusive language, that when addressed, the</p>
<p>ordinary citizen is as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke a</p>
<p>violent reaction.</p>
<p>So, you know, I would use that type of decision by the Supreme Court as inspiration to say</p>
<p>that racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and other racial and ethnic slurs shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>allowed on these networks, because it doesn&rsquo;t do anything to enhance the public debate.</p>
<p>Now, there is a question, like, could Kanye frame his arguments in a way that is still</p>
<p>incredibly offensive to us, but doesn&rsquo;t use slurs?</p>
<p>Yeah, for example, he could say, Hey, here are the top 10 media companies, here are the</p>
<p>executives, here&rsquo;s the percentage that are Jewish.</p>
<p>And this is, you know, my concern is that this is a, and here&rsquo;s the percentage people</p>
<p>are Jewish in the population, you could some bullshit like that.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, Okay, did he say something anti submitted, you know, and you&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of in this area.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s always going to be edge cases, and people are always going to be pushing</p>
<p>the envelope.</p>
<p>And so listen, just because we find it offensive, and you know, it&rsquo;s specifically offensive</p>
<p>to me, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it should automatically be banned.</p>
<p>So I think slurs, slurs, banned or out, but, but arguments, I don&rsquo;t know that we should</p>
<p>be banning entire categories of arguments.</p>
<p>And, and look, part of the problem here is that lots of people are hearing the arguments</p>
<p>that Ye is making, whether he&rsquo;s making them on Twitter or not.</p>
<p>And because he&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a total ban, people can&rsquo;t really engage with him on Twitter.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s not getting off ramped from this rabbit hole he&rsquo;s falling into.</p>
<p>And nobody else who might be a fan of his is hearing the other side of the argument.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s ultimately in the long term interest of the town square to be</p>
<p>banning, you know, the argument, the, you know, ACLU and other people have is like,</p>
<p>hey, you put a little sunlight on these bad opinions, at least everybody knows who has</p>
<p>the bad opinions, and you can fight them.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, while we&rsquo;re talking, I mean, do you really want these folks going to the</p>
<p>dark web? And, you know, being untraceable, there is some value in kind of knowing who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting radicalized, and hopefully, exposing them to other opinions in the same conversation</p>
<p>that can all frame them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, paradoxically, while we&rsquo;re talking, Elon just tweeted at 1118 am, Twitter will</p>
<p>be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints, no matter no major</p>
<p>content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s going to take the same approach that Facebook has, they have a council as well</p>
<p>that Zuckerberg tried to set up. So I think he realizes this should be a thoughtful discussion.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna be on that council?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>That sounds like a, the worst purgatory you could ever be in is to be the person who has</p>
<p>to make these decisions. Like, talk about a no win situation. I&rsquo;m curious, Chamath.</p>
<p>We talked last week about Kanye and then Lex Friedman dropped his episode, Lex came at it</p>
<p>with he pushed back on Kanye. I don&rsquo;t know if you watched some of the highlights. I saw</p>
<p>some of the highs he pushed back pretty hard.</p>
<p>I watched the whole thing.</p>
<p>Okay, so he pushed back really hard on the anti semitic stuff. And we had a discussion</p>
<p>last week, I said, Hey, you can&rsquo;t platform this guy. But it looks like Lex had a specific</p>
<p>point of view, which is he has a friendship with Kanye of some level. And he wanted to</p>
<p>try to convince him in this manicness that he&rsquo;s wrong about things did do you think Lex</p>
<p>succeeded? And he should have done it? I obviously we won&rsquo;t question Lex&rsquo;s intent.</p>
<p>I have had replaced Lex with me and Kanye with my relative wasn&rsquo;t on television or whatever,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve had these same kinds of, I&rsquo;ll call them interventions. And like I said,</p>
<p>this person goes through periods of lucidity, periods of mania, periods of paranoia,</p>
<p>periods of anger. And so that&rsquo;s all I saw when I was watching this thing is just what a lot</p>
<p>of people in the United States deal in the world deal with when they have relatives who are</p>
<p>suffering from one of these things. And you know, my relative has said the same thing. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing wrong with me. You know, I don&rsquo;t need medication. I&rsquo;m not on these meds, blah, blah,</p>
<p>blah. And I don&rsquo;t want to judge because I don&rsquo;t know him. But I&rsquo;ll tell you in my situation,</p>
<p>trying to like, you know, for example, like this person thinks that, you know,</p>
<p>myself and one other person, like we hacked into a computer system of the place that they worked</p>
<p>to manipulate the financial records, to point to this person as having committed a fraud,</p>
<p>and has and then thinks that people are now listening and bugging the phone. I mean,</p>
<p>all kinds of stuff over and over again. And then sometimes they don&rsquo;t think that and sometimes</p>
<p>they do. And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s maddening. What I&rsquo;m trying to tell you is like,</p>
<p>like, when you&rsquo;re not when you&rsquo;re in a normal state, regulated state, and you&rsquo;re talking to</p>
<p>somebody who&rsquo;s dysregulated, it&rsquo;s not too normal people having a conversation where you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to get them to see the logic of your ways. So again, I just think that it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>thing that should be litigated in the media. I think it is a thing that is where people that</p>
<p>care for this person need to surround them and get them with a doctor to help them rebalance</p>
<p>in the in the case of our family. What it turns out is that this person needs to constantly be</p>
<p>titrated the drugs for them to be regulated. That may be different for other people. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know Kanye situation. So anyways, I see all that and I and I and I go to my own family situation,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m which we actively deal with today. And I don&rsquo;t have much of an idea of what to do about</p>
<p>Kanye because it brings up too much stuff about what I&rsquo;m dealing with in real time with my own</p>
<p>family. I&rsquo;m sorry, going through that. And I, yeah, like I said, I mean, I think Lex had good</p>
<p>intent. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth doing. No, he&rsquo;s somebody he&rsquo;s incredible. You know, he&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>beautiful, empathetic person. Lex is in general. Yeah. So I think he tried to do the best job he</p>
<p>could. So I saw I saw part of the Lex interview, it was two and a half hours. And I wasn&rsquo;t gonna</p>
<p>sit through two and a half hours of it. You know, that&rsquo;s I went to the I went to the chapter titles</p>
<p>and I was in the middle is like Holocaust. Like, right. I was like, okay, let&rsquo;s just go right to</p>
<p>the train wreck. Yeah. So I skipped it to there. But anyway, I think the argument that that Lex</p>
<p>should have made or pointed out to Kanye is like, go see the new Elvis movie, which is all about</p>
<p>how an artist basically got taken advantage of by his business manager. And you&rsquo;ll see that this</p>
<p>idea is a very familiar trope in the music business. But that manager, Colonel Tom Parker,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t Jewish. He was a Dutch con man pretending to be a southern</p>
<p>hick. So this can happen. And it&rsquo;s a very common story. And it&rsquo;s got nothing to do</p>
<p>with the religion or race or whatever of the business people. So and in fact, the person</p>
<p>in that movie who has the best advice for Elvis is BB King, who says to Elvis at a very early</p>
<p>point in the movie, he says, if you don&rsquo;t do the business, the business will do you.</p>
<p>Hmm. And so, look, I think Kanye, again, if I was to sort of steel man and respond to it is,</p>
<p>listen, you know, what you&rsquo;re describing is a pretty common of artists being taken advantage</p>
<p>of is a common issue. It goes back a long time, and it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with religion. And</p>
<p>quite frankly, you know, there&rsquo;s probably a lot of other Jews in your life who&rsquo;ve helped you. I mean,</p>
<p>I wonder the last time you went to a doctor, did you notice whether they were Jewish or not,</p>
<p>you know, and so he&rsquo;s developed a little bit of a fixation here of noticing that some people</p>
<p>are Jewish, but probably he&rsquo;s not noticing when other people are Jewish, you&rsquo;ve probably helped</p>
<p>him. Yeah. So that&rsquo;s probably like the argument I would have made with him. You know, if I were</p>
<p>conducting that interview, and you make the argument to a person who&rsquo;s in a manic episode,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even realize what they&rsquo;re saying. They forget what they say when they get through</p>
<p>the manic episode. These paranoid these paranoias don&rsquo;t tend to come up when you&rsquo;re in a regulated</p>
<p>normal state. Exactly. All right, let&rsquo;s talk about meta. Brad Gerson was on last week,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had an ongoing discussion about big tech entitlement spending the number of employees</p>
<p>that these companies on Monday, Brad, I think, you know, got a little worked up on the last pod,</p>
<p>maybe, and dropped an open letter, some might say activist, he would say constructivist to</p>
<p>Zuckerberg and the team over there, hey, maybe pump the brakes on the capex, maybe do a riff,</p>
<p>maybe become profitable. Anyway, the revenue and the third quarter was a complete,</p>
<p>utter disaster for meta. And the stock has plummeted, and been under $100 a share.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who wants to start on this one. But okay, look, there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack here. So I</p>
<p>think we should take our time because I think one part of it is meta. Okay. But one part of it</p>
<p>is actually about what we talked about a few episodes ago, which is like this big tech put,</p>
<p>right, where they define the rules of the game on the field for every other startup.</p>
<p>And I think the third part is just about like the era of big tech being over and what it means for</p>
<p>the stock market. If I think if you section it out in those three ways, Jason, we can have a pretty</p>
<p>rich convo, I&rsquo;d love to tease some of the start. Okay, so let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s start with meta. So Nick,</p>
<p>can you please throw up Apple versus meta for a second. And let me just give you guys the</p>
<p>talk track. And then maybe we can go from there. So when you look at Apple versus meta,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this really interesting thing that comes up, which is in 2016. You know,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve said this before, you could not give Apple stock away. They were generating a ton of</p>
<p>cash, it was sitting on the balance sheet. In many ways, Facebook was doing the same thing.</p>
<p>And there was this famous dinner, I don&rsquo;t know if it was a dinner that ever happened. But that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>the the lore is told between Tim Cook, Carl Icahn, and I think Luca maestri, the CFO. And in it, what</p>
<p>Carl Icahn said is, listen, I have a below the line suggestion for Apple. And what does that</p>
<p>mean? If you look at a P&amp;L, you have your revenues, that&rsquo;s above the line, you have costs,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also above the line. And then you have your profits, and then it&rsquo;s what you do with</p>
<p>the profits. So what he was suggesting is below the line. After the fact, he had no suggestions</p>
<p>for how the business should be run. He just said, give us back the money, and we will reward you,</p>
<p>the stock price will go up. And what&rsquo;s interesting to note here is the black line is the performance</p>
<p>of Apple stock as as they&rsquo;ve given back. And they&rsquo;ve used a ton of their own balance sheet</p>
<p>cash to buy back the stock. Okay, so they&rsquo;ve spent $396 billion since 2016 to buy back stock in the</p>
<p>same time Facebook has spent almost 100 billion. Now, here he is, here&rsquo;s where you start to see</p>
<p>the divergence. So you would have said, well, shouldn&rsquo;t Facebook&rsquo;s stock have reacted in the</p>
<p>same way? And for a very long time, it actually looked like it was right until about September</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>And then obviously, this thing fell off a cliff. And the reason why it started to fall</li>
</ol>
<p>off a cliff was somebody started to notice that hold on a second. Even though you&rsquo;re buying back</p>
<p>all these shares, the bottom of the funnel, right, you&rsquo;re leaking all of these shares to all of these</p>
<p>new employees. Why are you hiring so many people? And this is when people started to uncover what</p>
<p>was happening above the line at Facebook and is what caused this massive dispersion. So,</p>
<p>Nick, if you go to the first chart, so what is actually been going on above the line?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on. If you look at the light purple bar, Facebook in the last two years have</p>
<p>spent $25 billion on reality dabs. And they said that they&rsquo;re going to spend, you know,</p>
<p>meaningfully more in 2023, and then sustain that investment for a while. So if you do a little bit</p>
<p>of math, if they spent, you know, they spend around 4 billion, a quarter right now, so 16</p>
<p>billion a year, that&rsquo;ll go to 25 billion in 2023. And then they&rsquo;ll sustain that. What that means</p>
<p>is that over this, you know, 12 or 13 year life of reality labs, as we&rsquo;ve seen it,</p>
<p>these guys will have spent a quarter of a trillion dollars. And what I did here was I just wanted to</p>
<p>understand there is I wanted to understand a quarter of a trillion dollars in the context of</p>
<p>other major leaps in humanity. So at the left is what Apple spent in its entirety. By the way,</p>
<p>these are all inflation adjusted dollars. For today, Apple spent $3.6 billion to create the</p>
<p>first iPhone. And what they did was they said every subsequent version of the iPhone would only</p>
<p>be funded from the cash flow and profits of the generation before it. Right. So they used consumer</p>
<p>demand as their guiding principle. So it was a very incremental approach, iPhone one, iPhone two,</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re at iPhone, you know, 14, or whatever 13. But the point is, it took 3.6 billion to get</p>
<p>that juggernaut off the ground. The Manhattan Project will cost 23 billion in today&rsquo;s dollars</p>
<p>to create the atomic bomb. Tesla in its entire life spent 25 billion to get free cash flow</p>
<p>profitability. And they took this incremental approach as well. We&rsquo;ll create the, you know,</p>
<p>the the coupe, the Roadster, then the Model S, then the Model X, they iterated their way,</p>
<p>they use customer demand, and all of that revenue to fund future growth. The cube spend on Tesla</p>
<p>was 25 billion. Boeing spent 32 Google and other bets has spent 40. The only thing that I could</p>
<p>find in history that is comparable to what meta has basically said they&rsquo;re going to spend is the</p>
<p>entire Apollo program, which cost in today&rsquo;s dollars, a quarter of a trillion as well. So</p>
<p>the problem is that below the line meta was doing the right things. Above the line, they&rsquo;ve created,</p>
<p>I think, an enormous set of pressures for themselves, which is, you know, if you think</p>
<p>about the Apollo program, this was 13 years of building rockets, getting to low Earth orbit,</p>
<p>then getting to be able to, you know, orbit the Earth, then eventually building an entire</p>
<p>infrastructure and capability to land on the moon and get back. So there was a lot of incremental</p>
<p>progress there. I think what people don&rsquo;t understand is where is this quarter of a trillion</p>
<p>dollars going? And is it going to be a leap in humanity at the scale of the Apollo program?</p>
<p>Because it now is becoming the single largest capital allocation program in capitalism history.</p>
<p>Nothing comes close. So I think that that is a really interesting maybe jumping off point to</p>
<p>talk about what&rsquo;s going on inside of this business. It&rsquo;s I think they&rsquo;re doing all the right things</p>
<p>below the line. But there&rsquo;s this one major big red flag above the line that has to be probably</p>
<p>better explained by them. If they want to have long term shareholders. And basically,</p>
<p>what happened was when people heard this, they said, this is a dumpster fire.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re out of here. Saks, what do you ask the question? What happened with the whole</p>
<p>Brad Gershner&rsquo;s proposal? Was that actually discussed on the call?</p>
<p>No earnings call? They, you know, they ignored?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t want to say it was totally ignored. Because I do think that they</p>
<p>should be given credit for a couple of things. I think that the core business</p>
<p>continues to march forward. And they basically said, look, we&rsquo;re going to slow headcount growth,</p>
<p>some teams will shrink. I think the problem is really in this reality labs,</p>
<p>the amount of investment that they&rsquo;re making is so outsized, and so abnormal,</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t compare to anything anybody&rsquo;s ever seen. I think everything else in the business</p>
<p>seems to be actually quite functional. So the problem is that this above the line thing,</p>
<p>though, has become so big. It could sink the business, you know, it&rsquo;s very, very hard to see</p>
<p>an investment case for a quarter of a trillion dollars of money in the door before you really</p>
<p>start to see something magical. Now, they may have something super magical that nobody knows about</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to unveil and say, ha, see told you. And maybe there should be a set of</p>
<p>outcomes where we plan for that. But the reality is, it&rsquo;s, you know, $25 billion a year for the</p>
<p>next umpteen years. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s 10 billion, where did the 25 billion come from? No, this</p>
<p>number, it&rsquo;s 4 billion, a quarter right now. So 16 billion a year. And they said that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to significantly increase it to 2023. So I just assumed it was a 50% increase, maybe</p>
<p>significant means 100. But 16 goes to 25. And they said they&rsquo;re gonna keep going at that pace.</p>
<p>And so if you run that out till 2030, that&rsquo;s how you get to $250 billion.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;s a business here in VR, AR,</p>
<p>sex? You think this will be the next platform? I guess that&rsquo;s a key question to ask here.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I like I actually like these Oculus products. I think it&rsquo;s a very cool product.</p>
<p>The question is really just about the magnitude of the investment level. But I think there is a</p>
<p>future in VR and AR. And it is a, you&rsquo;ve tried the Oculus headset before it is like a very</p>
<p>magical, you know, experience with software, one of the most magical that I&rsquo;ve had, the question</p>
<p>is just, we&rsquo;re talking about magnitude and timeframe. And use case, I think also comes</p>
<p>to mind for me, sex, I everybody seems to, you know, try and then say, Oh, my, and then say</p>
<p>goodbye to these headsets. Like people buy them, they try them. And they&rsquo;re like, this is incredible.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no use case for them. I see very few people just use them on a regular basis.</p>
<p>We just invested in a company that is creating professional flight simulators using VR as a</p>
<p>component. And education. Yeah, I think training is actually a huge use case. Huge, huge. And</p>
<p>by the way, these are not like video game flight simulator programs. These are actual,</p>
<p>they create physical cockpits with knobs and dials and stuff. It&rsquo;s just that the pilot is</p>
<p>using a professional grade VR headset. And so they&rsquo;re able to load, you know, a lot more</p>
<p>training programs and scenarios, and they&rsquo;re able to train on more planes, they can like change up</p>
<p>the cockpit. By the way, the cockpits on gyros, so it actually moves around.</p>
<p>Let me put it in a different way. I think that we should assume that VR and AR is going to be</p>
<p>a really important part of our existence. And I do think that as David said, many of these</p>
<p>experiences are magical. I think what investors reacted to was spending $25 billion a year</p>
<p>needs to be measurable somehow. And I think what they said is the things that we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily tell us that this bet is going to make any sense at that level of spend. So if</p>
<p>you were spending 2 billion a year, or 3 billion a year, I don&rsquo;t think people would have said</p>
<p>anything. It&rsquo;s just the magnitude relative to the progress that&rsquo;s being demonstrated publicly.</p>
<p>And and that&rsquo;s the thing that I think the Tesla program got right, the Apple phone program got</p>
<p>right, the Boeing program, even the Apollo 13 program for that quantum of spend. So it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>to say that you can&rsquo;t spend a quarter trillion dollars over the next decade, but you got to eat</p>
<p>what you kill, you have to be able to show progress in a way that says this this investment is tracking</p>
<p>freeberg. I think the biggest issue he&rsquo;s having is he&rsquo;s trying to build a moonshot that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>only get to see when I&rsquo;m done. It&rsquo;s like, hey, I&rsquo;m behind the curtain over here. I&rsquo;m Willy Wonka,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to come out with the most amazing chocolate bar in 10 years. And after I spend</p>
<p>100 billion dollars, but don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s going to be awesome. Trust me, shareholders, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be amazing. And with consumer products in particular, not guys, you keep saying 100. It&rsquo;s</p>
<ol start="250">
<li>Yeah, whatever it ends up being, in general, I think consumer products, you want to see them</li>
</ol>
<p>in the market. And you want to iterate to success. Tell me one consumer product that launched and</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t iterate after launch and didn&rsquo;t kind of evolve over time, in a way that responded to what</p>
<p>the market was telling the builder or that product, but freeberg, in fairness to them, they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that, too. It&rsquo;s just I think what people can&rsquo;t square is, we see the next gen oculuses. And then</p>
<p>we see the spend, and we think that they&rsquo;re upside down relative to what we&rsquo;re seeing in terms of</p>
<p>progress. I think that&rsquo;s what people are reacting. If he was spending 5 billion a year, this wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be an issue, Chamath, right? A nothing burger, nothing. People would say good idea, throw a</p>
<p>long ball. I think that there&rsquo;s two kind of ways to think about the distinct things that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>building. One is this hardware platform with Oculus and a better kind of experience for</p>
<p>immersive experiences, whether that&rsquo;s VR or AR. The second is what&rsquo;s all the software layer look</p>
<p>like and what goes on in that platform. That&rsquo;s where this thing seems to be pretty short and</p>
<p>where people seem to have a lack of confidence and conviction. The hardware seems super interesting.</p>
<p>But I got to tell you, Epic Games just raised money earlier this year at a $31 billion valuation.</p>
<p>If Zuck was a smart guy, he would go to Tencent and cut him a check and buy the whole thing for</p>
<p>50 billion and buy those guys. Because that&rsquo;s a platform that has a couple hundred million active</p>
<p>users, is making money, has a really deep, immersive, but two-dimensional experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not 3D. It&rsquo;s not on VR. And on top of Fortnite, and on top of their engine that they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>built, there are just countless experiences and worlds and interactions and models that exist</p>
<p>today that are already active, that are being iterated, that have been evolving for years.</p>
<p>And if you look at where Fortnite and some of the tools and experiences that have been built</p>
<p>into Fortnite over the past couple of years sit relative to when Fortnite was first launched,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Tim Sweeney and that team would have ever said,</p>
<p>hey, this is where we&rsquo;re going to be in a couple of years. This is what we&rsquo;re going to be doing.</p>
<p>It was part of an evolutionary experience of building a great platform and having an engaged</p>
<p>user base. And unfortunately, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a great engaged user base in the software</p>
<p>layer of what he&rsquo;s built here today, making it very difficult to track a path to get consumer</p>
<p>feedback and to identify where that goes over time. The hardware experience totally understand</p>
<p>that that takes time to build something incredible also should be in the market and getting iterative</p>
<p>feedback. But really, that software piece is what would feel short.</p>
<p>To your point, I think that that&rsquo;s another great example of a below the line decision that they</p>
<p>could have made with all of this money. You know, if you compare what Brad asked Facebook to do on</p>
<p>Monday versus what Icon asked Apple to do in 2016, you know, Icon basically said, just make this below</p>
<p>the line change and everybody will be happy. It&rsquo;s a do no harm solution. None of us are getting in</p>
<p>the way. We&rsquo;re not telling you how to run the business. The thing that I think that, you know,</p>
<p>what Facebook had to react to was Brad suggestions were fundamentally above the line. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, firing 20% of the people or 30% or changing the capital allocation would require</p>
<p>some changes to strategy. And I think this is a good moment to recognize it as as much clarity</p>
<p>as Brad&rsquo;s letter had and as much sense as it probably makes to outsiders looking in.</p>
<p>The minute you have to tell companies how to change above the line, it&rsquo;s just a good reminder</p>
<p>to me that no, it&rsquo;s not going to happen. Because these folks will not want to make those changes.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want saying Zuck won&rsquo;t make the changes. I think it&rsquo;s natural human psychology.</p>
<p>I think you want to make those changes yourself. You don&rsquo;t want to be told what to do.</p>
<p>Got it. Saks, what do you think this is going to do to governance in Silicon Valley writ large?</p>
<p>Probably nothing. Really? It&rsquo;s not going to change anything.</p>
<p>Well, it is it is interesting. If you look at Elon&rsquo;s Twitter deal, there is no dual class,</p>
<p>everybody has, this is one class of security. This is one type of stock. So it&rsquo;s simple</p>
<p>majority voting, Elon actually had the choice of doing dual class, and he decided not to.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty interesting. So if people want to follow Elon&rsquo;s example, then they would,</p>
<p>you know, not not necessarily go for Tesla doesn&rsquo;t have super shares either. And he said it many</p>
<p>times, if you want to vote me out, you can vote me out. Right? I mean, he&rsquo;s, so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>SpaceX either. Yeah, he&rsquo;s putting his neck on the line, right? I don&rsquo;t know. I</p>
<p>has a SpaceX shoulder. I have no idea. I have no idea. Yeah, I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>SpaceX isn&rsquo;t public yet. So maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Like they haven&rsquo;t reached that decision</p>
<p>point. Yeah, I will tell you, I just, I think Starlink has such a huge opportunity. I just</p>
<p>got Starlink for two locations as a backup, because you lose your internet a couple times</p>
<p>a year. And you can get these routers now that&rsquo;ll fail over. So since I&rsquo;m doing business,</p>
<p>like, I can&rsquo;t really lose the internet. So for 1000 bucks a year, I can have Starlink as a</p>
<p>backup, and I started using it. And the speed is getting pretty compelling already. Like zoom calls,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t tell the difference right now, most of the time, and certainly for web browsing or</p>
<p>watching a movie. You know, it just works. So I can see many companies putting in Starlink,</p>
<p>even if they have a fiber line or whatever, just as a backup, that business alone could be</p>
<p>just to provide both sides of the story here. I mean, the reason why dual class emerged and was</p>
<p>seen as viable is that if you look at the historic performance of internet companies,</p>
<p>the ones that have done the best perform the best are the ones where the founder stays involved for</p>
<p>a long time. And the ones where the founder checked out, like after a few years and hired</p>
<p>professional CEO, those are the ones that went off the rails, it happened again and again.</p>
<p>So there, there is an argument for dual class in the sense that you keep the founder involved,</p>
<p>and you avoid a power struggle. That&rsquo;s not what happened.</p>
<p>Well, but that was why it was considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Well, I think it was considered acceptable, because in the Google bake off, all these</p>
<p>banks were clamoring so hard. And, you know, there were two vectors of iteration. One vector</p>
<p>was on the way that, you know, Google wanted to do this IPO process, they pick Credit Suisse,</p>
<p>they did this Dutch auction. The other one was the bankers basically pitched them on a</p>
<p>dual class voting control structure. And Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley, and once Google got it,</p>
<p>everybody else was able to copy because all the bankers realized that if you want to win a bake</p>
<p>off, you&rsquo;re not trying to win over the CFO, you&rsquo;re actually trying to win over the CEO.</p>
<p>And giving that person control turned out to be an incredible commitment,</p>
<p>and a way to win the deal. And so I actually think it was never a governance issue or a reflection</p>
<p>of how value was created. It was just basically a feature that you that one banker used in an IPO</p>
<p>bake off to try to differentiate versus another. This is why, you know, like I said, like Elon has</p>
<p>never cared about that stuff, because it&rsquo;s like, if I&rsquo;m not doing well, vote me out,</p>
<p>which is so clarifying, because he realizes that that&rsquo;s actually the best check on him making bad</p>
<p>decisions. You know, and I think part of it is why he&rsquo;s done so well, you know, one class of stock,</p>
<p>he was able to negotiate an incredible compensation package. And it&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s he has</p>
<p>clarity on the few things of the business that matter. But I think he&rsquo;s also more compelling</p>
<p>than some of these other guys. And there may be some degree of feeling like this is a mechanism</p>
<p>that other people need that Elon has a degree of confidence and a degree of charisma and</p>
<p>salesmanship that gets him what he wants. I just want to read you guys the excerpt from Larry and</p>
<p>Sergei&rsquo;s founders letter from the IPO in 2004. As a private company, we&rsquo;ve concentrated on the</p>
<p>long term and this has served us well. As a public company, we will do the same. In our opinion,</p>
<p>outside pressures to often tempt companies to sacrifice long term opportunities to meet quarterly</p>
<p>market expectations. Sometimes this has caused opportunities to manipulate financial results</p>
<p>in order to make their quarter, and they go on and on and on. And they say, Look, you might ask us</p>
<p>how long is long term, usually we expect them in a couple of years, and they go on. Many companies</p>
<p>are under pressure to keep their earnings in line with analysts forecasts. Therefore, they often</p>
<p>accept smaller, predictable earnings, rather than larger and less predictable returns. Sergey and I</p>
<p>feel this is harmful. And we intend to steer in the opposite direction. I think that the statement</p>
<p>that they made really resonated in Silicon Valley at the time, particularly during this era of what</p>
<p>people were calling web two and the internet was being rebuilt. And all these businesses were</p>
<p>starting to thrive. And it was like, we have this massive road ahead of us this long road ahead of</p>
<p>us. And we can really change the world. But in order to do it, well, in order to do it effectively,</p>
<p>we have to as entrepreneurs as engineers, be able to have the freedom to operate for the long term,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it had anything to get stuck in the short term. But that had nothing to do with</p>
<p>anything that there was no pressure on them. It&rsquo;s not like they shied away. It&rsquo;s not like that super</p>
<p>voting control allowed them to make one seminal decision. There were quarters to moth where Google</p>
<p>was getting a lot of heat for the amount of money they were spending on capex because they were</p>
<p>building their own data centers. They were building their own servers, they were building their own,</p>
<p>eventually DRAM, they started to build their own switches. Every element of how Google build a</p>
<p>competitive advantage over time was difficult for analysts to understand. You&rsquo;re not saying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not saying the obvious thing. The reason why they were allowed to do it in the end was</p>
<p>because more and more users use their product because it was better and better. And they</p>
<p>consistently meet and beat every expectation. This is not I didn&rsquo;t need to use this option.</p>
<p>This was not a need to call this option. This is not a company that went back and forth between</p>
<p>meeting and missing expectations. Okay. They were up into the right. They were they were up into the</p>
<p>right is correct. That is the general principle. But the time to return the ROC the timeframe to</p>
<p>hit their ROC targets was long. And it was hard for people to get that when they not true. That</p>
<p>is not YouTube. They bought YouTube and they spent 10s of billions of dollars investing in YouTube</p>
<p>before generated cash. I think that that would Yeah, but you&rsquo;re not math. You&rsquo;re not what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying is not true. It is not mathematically true. What you&rsquo;re saying there was no 13 year</p>
<p>Roik play that they executed on not true. And you can just disagree. They put their own they put</p>
<p>their own fiber optic lines across the oceans. The capex I understand scrutinized and not well</p>
<p>understood. I get it. You can read but you&rsquo;re not you can read the analyst reports and see how</p>
<p>difficult this was. I&rsquo;m asking for you to do is look at they had voting shares is what gave them</p>
<p>the ability to do this bullshit. I think that if you look at their performance, their EBITDA margins</p>
<p>and their Roik was exceptional when they were making those investments. In fact, I would say</p>
<p>the opposite. I would say that they were surprised by high how by how high quality their business</p>
<p>model was. They were generating so much cash. What they were probably thinking back in the day</p>
<p>was oh my gosh, we need to make sure that we are actually making long term investments. And now we</p>
<p>have the ability to do it. Because we have all this cash we didn&rsquo;t expect. And we should probably</p>
<p>bleed off cash so that we don&rsquo;t show 50% gross margins to raise all of the attention of regulators</p>
<p>and everybody else. And so what do you think Zuck is doing? What&rsquo;s different today? I think that</p>
<p>they have an incredible core business because he&rsquo;s got good business, good EBITDA margins,</p>
<p>good revenue growth, what&rsquo;s different, they have an incredible core business. And they have decided</p>
<p>for whatever reason, to make an enormous bet. And that bet could be a very good bet. But the way</p>
<p>that you make a bet, and you said this, well, is you have to look at incremental progress.</p>
<p>And you have to demonstrate that all of these bets make sense. Because the problem is when you</p>
<p>could compared to the Tesla program, look, Tesla is reinventing an entire category trillions of</p>
<p>dollars of energy generation and transportation. But they did it on in one year of meta reality</p>
<p>lab spend. Apple reinvented an entire compute platform on one quarter of metas reality lab</p>
<p>spend. That&rsquo;s not a judgment. That&rsquo;s just a numerical observation. So if you want to get</p>
<p>people on your side, you just have to be able to double click into that in an elegant, articulate</p>
<p>way and say, here are all of these things that justify $25 billion a year. Hey, guys, let me</p>
<p>show you a chart. Here&rsquo;s a chart of alphabets, capital expenditures by quarter, and here is their</p>
<p>revenue. The blue line at $7 billion right now, this is my point. Yeah, they struggled.</p>
<p>They struggled. They struggled to find ways to spend money. Exactly. I mean, literally,</p>
<p>they, they created project loon. They were going to do balloons, guys, they wanted to build fiber.</p>
<p>They wanted to build, they wanted to build, they wanted to build at one point, a ladder to the</p>
<p>moon, a ladder. They thought they could build from Ted. It was an elevator, but yeah, whatever</p>
<p>an elevator is in that seven point to climb there. Right. The elevator was in the purple line.</p>
<p>Yeah. And somewhere in there, they spent a billion or whatever on maps, and it ended up</p>
<p>being a phenomenal asset when the whole world moved to mobile. I think we&rsquo;re not saying the</p>
<p>obvious thing. We spent a lot less than we&rsquo;re not, we&rsquo;re not, we&rsquo;re not saying the obvious thing,</p>
<p>which is great leaps of progress in humanity are not correlated to dollars all the time. In fact,</p>
<p>most examples are the exact opposite, which is it&rsquo;s more about small and extremely nimble and</p>
<p>talented management teams that generate human progress. And again, if you go back to that first</p>
<p>chart of Apple versus meta, you know, the fact that you&rsquo;ve hired so many people to work on a</p>
<p>category with so much money, it just violates a lot of pattern recognition that people have</p>
<p>historically seen. So all I&rsquo;m saying is, maybe this is a great bet. They just need to do a better</p>
<p>job of explaining this would have been so much easier if he had just put</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying this could be this could have been such a better transition. He should have put</p>
<p>Sheryl Sandberg, a CEO of the Facebook Corporation, he should have became CEO of meta.</p>
<p>And then he should have ran that other business to print even more profits. And then if you look</p>
<p>at some of their forays into building a super app, they added Facebook marketplace to Facebook,</p>
<p>and it was a huge hit. They started to pull the ecommerce string over at Instagram,</p>
<p>it started to work. There&rsquo;s just no focus on those products. If you look at the Facebook</p>
<p>collection of billions of users, what apps could you add to that? You know, whether it&rsquo;s payments,</p>
<p>they did the whole crypto thing, they gave up on that it seems like there&rsquo;s no leadership on</p>
<p>the Facebook side that actually wants to take swings over there. They just are obsessed with</p>
<p>this one thing. It makes no sense to me. I think that there&rsquo;s probably part of it,</p>
<p>which is that, you know, when you&rsquo;re working on a thing for a long time, there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>personality type that loves the mastery that comes from working on the thing for a long,</p>
<p>long time. Yep. And then there&rsquo;s a different personality type that likes more shiny new</p>
<p>things. Yeah. And you kind of have to have a balance of all of those different people.</p>
<p>And so maybe what we&rsquo;re seeing as well is that, you know, you&rsquo;re right, maybe the boring business</p>
<p>was just labeled too boring internally. And there wasn&rsquo;t enough heat around wanting to work on it</p>
<p>forever. Nobody wanted to keep grinding. So you wanted to throw these big hill Marys. All I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is you just need to explain the hill Mary. All right, let&rsquo;s look, by the way, let me just</p>
<p>ping you on this. So the meta spend in the quarter relative to the revenue, it&rsquo;s about 15</p>
<p>are the virtual reality stuff. It&rsquo;s about 15 billion 15%. Does that sound right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. But they said it was 4 billion this quarter.</p>
<p>Yeah, so 4 billion out of 27 of revenue. So it&rsquo;s about 15%. And alphabets last quarter revenue</p>
<p>was 70 billion. And they spent about a billion billion. Let me show you this actually actually</p>
<p>have this chart handy because I was talking about it on this, which is 1.4%. So on a relative basis,</p>
<p>alphabet is spending one 10th of what meta is per dollar earned, or top line revenue earned</p>
<p>on their other bets category. So tomorrow, do you think it&rsquo;s a relative spend problem that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re spending 10 times as much as a percent of revenue, that it&rsquo;s causing so much</p>
<p>heartache, even if it is directionally correct. If you want to see the capex versus revenue,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s that on the screen right now. No, we know, we know what we haven&rsquo;t shown. This is Google</p>
<p>and meta on the same chart, the blue line on the red on the bottom 9 billion in capex for Facebook</p>
<p>seven for Google. Is this your new like charting tool that you guys have built?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, we just do it on this weekend startups all the time.</p>
<p>What do you use? What is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, actually beep it out because I don&rsquo;t want to give them a free spot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not giving a free promo.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t let you invest.</p>
<p>Whatever. I mean,</p>
<p>the truth comes out. They didn&rsquo;t let him invest.</p>
<p>No, no, they&rsquo;ve been around forever. They&rsquo;ve been around for a good product. I&rsquo;ve used it</p>
<p>just to be a good product. Listen, we&rsquo;re gonna promo something&rsquo;s gonna be call in or</p>
<p>Nick, can you throw up the super got super got this is super got charts.</p>
<p>So look, this is a new charting feature on Colin.</p>
<p>I think the problem is, look, here&rsquo;s the problem. Let&rsquo;s just say that you&rsquo;re an analyst that works</p>
<p>at a large hedge fund or a mutual fund. And you woke up on Wednesday and you, you know,</p>
<p>had a decent day. And then you went into the earnings call, believing that, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a this is there&rsquo;s a value play here. And there&rsquo;s a lot of upside, which I think there is actually,</p>
<p>you know, this company can throw off an enormous amount of cash.</p>
<p>But then what you hear is, okay, we&rsquo;re spending 4 billion a quarter, that&rsquo;s going to go up</p>
<p>materially. And then we&rsquo;re going to keep 23 spending levels roughly the same in the to the</p>
<p>future. So then you have to go back and build a model, you&rsquo;re going to be hard pressed to not get</p>
<p>to this number, maybe you don&rsquo;t get to 250, maybe you get to 200. My point is, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>you have to go back into your, you know, portfolio manager and say, uh, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to spend all of this, you know, after tax cash flow on this stuff.</p>
<p>Or sorry, not after tax cash flow, but, you know, below the, you know, above the line spending on</p>
<p>this stuff, which won&rsquo;t come back to us as shareholders. And we&rsquo;re going to dilute the</p>
<p>stock two or 3% a year. So that&rsquo;s another 20% dilution. And it just becomes what I again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this before it, you move the stock into what&rsquo;s called the too hard bucket, you know,</p>
<p>from the it&rsquo;s obvious to wow, that&rsquo;s really tough. And I&rsquo;ll just take a wait and see approach.</p>
<p>You know, I think yesterday, there was a quarter of a I think a quarter billion shares that traded</p>
<p>hands of Facebook, just a ginormous number. And so you know, I think you think that&rsquo;s tax</p>
<p>loss harvesting to at the end of the year, maybe some people want to take the loss. So there&rsquo;s tax</p>
<p>loss harvesting for individuals, by the way, there was a couple comments, which we should talk about</p>
<p>and explain what tax loss harvesting is. But a bunch of these mutual funds year ends are actually</p>
<p>October 31. So to your point, Jason, you know, the stock basically gets decimated 20, you know,</p>
<p>25%. In a day, the T rose and the fidelities are like, alright, book the tax loss and be done.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll we look at it next year, quote, unquote, next year. So, you know, if you put on the spread</p>
<p>trade, so we talked about the spread trade, there was a big hedge fund manager that, you know,</p>
<p>November six, right, when we were basically calling the top of the market and told people to</p>
<p>sell. One of the trades that he put on, Nick, if you want to just throw it up was this long Google,</p>
<p>short meta spread trade, he called to tell me that, you know, he closed it out yesterday.</p>
<p>This is how that trade did. So yeah, there was just a lot of folks that just kind of like went</p>
<p>to the exits and said, you know what, we&rsquo;re kind of done for the short term, I just think that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a moment in time where those folks have to realize that they just have to explain a little</p>
<p>bit better how they want to spend the money and show a little bit more incremental progress that</p>
<p>justifies that level of spend. Otherwise, people will be a little skeptical, they&rsquo;ll build their</p>
<p>own histogram. And it&rsquo;ll violate too many rules. And so it goes into the too hard bucket.</p>
<p>Okay, we got macro, we got Ukraine. And I think I think that you should talk about big tech,</p>
<p>because Amazon puked as well, Jason, the Can you just throw up the big tech chart,</p>
<p>because I think like you guys should see this, because I think this is very important for</p>
<p>Silicon Valley. Amazon reported their q3 earnings yesterday, Thursday, total revenue 127 billion</p>
<p>of 15% year over year 5% quarter of a quarter net income was 2.9 billion. And they&rsquo;re predicting</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re giving slower guidance going forward. I mean, what&rsquo;s incredible on this chart is that,</p>
<p>you know, when when everybody talks about being along the S&amp;P 500, it was always really a proxy</p>
<p>for being long. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. And at the peak, you know,</p>
<p>in May of this year, it was still, you know, 25 cents of every single dollar of the S&amp;P 500 were</p>
<p>these five companies. And, you know, we always said the market bottom will be when the generals</p>
<p>quote unquote get shot, you know, to borrow a phrase from Gavin Baker. And it looks like the</p>
<p>generals have been shot. Yeah. And what&rsquo;s incredible is this week, every single one of</p>
<p>those companies, other than Apple really reported pretty crappy earnings. They got totally taken to</p>
<p>the woodshed. The percentage of the of these companies as a percentage of the S&amp;P is now you</p>
<p>know, off by 500 basis points, it&rsquo;s down to 20%. Yet the markets are ripping higher today. So I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s kind of what we talked about three weeks ago, like the bottom is kind of in for the</p>
<p>short term, you know, so it&rsquo;s really exciting, actually, to see, I think this is the point where</p>
<p>you have to now start to get pretty constructive about where things are going. Because if this</p>
<p>stuff could not bring the market down, it&rsquo;s hard to see something other than an exogenous event,</p>
<p>probably some Russia, Ukraine event really having a negative impact. So to me, I&rsquo;m kind of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it seems like pretty bullish for also GDP was 2.6%. So I mean, the this very weird</p>
<p>conflicting data, we had two negative quarters of growth, we&rsquo;re in a recession, then we have a</p>
<p>the third quarter is up 2.6%. So remember, Jason, I said that we were gonna have a double dip that</p>
<p>was I sure that was most likely thing. So we had this sort of mild technical recession based on</p>
<p>nominal GDP growth, not being bad, but simply not quite keeping up with the inflation rate.</p>
<p>Yeah, now things are a little bit better. But I still think the huge recession is to come next</p>
<p>year, because all the interest rate increases we&rsquo;ve seen. So the Fed is, you know, pedal to</p>
<p>the metal on interest rate increases, just like they were pedal to the metal on printing money.</p>
<p>And so first, they you know, they were too loose. And now they&rsquo;re probably being too tight too fast.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re headed for a huge recession next year. And I think you&rsquo;re seeing that in</p>
<p>the softness of all these forecasts. Yeah, look at the look at the look at the mortgage rates</p>
<p>right now, something like 7.1%. mortgage rates are crazy. They broke the backs of the housing</p>
<p>market that the inventory and prices inventory shot up, prices have shot up new mortgages have</p>
<p>gone down. And you know, we talked about job openings. Here&rsquo;s the the Fred chart for job</p>
<p>openings real quick. You can see the the peak we were talking about, we were wondering if that</p>
<p>would come plummeting down. Well, here it is, folks. Yeah, plummeting down from 11 million,</p>
<p>losing a million in a month. Yeah, job openings coming smashing down. There&rsquo;s the Fed fund rate.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a pretty high ramp. So you think double dip recession,</p>
<p>what do you think Freeberg Chamath in terms of what 2023 looks like? You&rsquo;re sort of saying</p>
<p>Chamath a bottom is forming. I kind of agree with that. I think the stock market is going up.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;ll go back down, because I think what David said is right. But for the short term,</p>
<p>this thing is going up, short term up. And, you know, we&rsquo;ve generally been positioned for it to</p>
<p>go up. And, and at some point, we will reverse and position for it to go back down. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going up sacks. It seems like you took a week off from the all in podcast and people stopped</p>
<p>talking about Ukraine. You want to give us an update? I mean, obviously, the war is not over,</p>
<p>but it does seem like it somehow has fallen out of the public&rsquo;s consciousness a bit. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if I go that far. There was the big event in the Ukraine war debate this week was that the</p>
<p>House Progressive Caucus put out a letter signed by 30 progressive members to merely suggest that</p>
<p>while we continue to fund Ukraine on a virtually unlimited basis, we also in parallel open up a</p>
<p>diplomatic track with Russia to mitigate against the threat of us being drawn into the war and</p>
<p>specifically a nuclear war. And just that very, I&rsquo;d say anodyne letter that very</p>
<p>tepid sentiment, really, they weren&rsquo;t questioning in any way, the providing again,</p>
<p>a virtually unlimited support to Ukraine, that met with such a fierce reaction on social media</p>
<p>and in the traditional media that I think all but one of the signatories recanted,</p>
<p>or walk back the letter and kudos to Representative Ro Khanna for not being one of the people who</p>
<p>recanted he so tall and gave an interview on CNN and MSNBC saying why has diplomacy become a dirty</p>
<p>word? I voted for every single appropriation to give aid and weapons to Ukraine. I&rsquo;ll continue</p>
<p>to do that. But I don&rsquo;t see a problem with us maintaining diplomatic relations, we might need</p>
<p>those to avoid an unwanted escalation. Well, and here we are, kudos to him for standing tall. But</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing to me that the Progressive Caucus, which used to be one of the groups in Congress</p>
<p>that questioned American involvement in foreign wars, like the Iraq War, they basically,</p>
<p>they have moved off that. And they threw in the towel so quickly on this, it was really kind of</p>
<p>pathetic to see. I mean, it really like this is back to Shakespeare,</p>
<p>like politics makes for strange bedfellows, you find yourself aligned with the most left part</p>
<p>of the Democratic Party in trying to just say, hey, maybe we should negotiate peace</p>
<p>a little more for us to pursue the right foreign policy. And I don&rsquo;t really care which</p>
<p>party has you would do would actually donate to anybody who is pushing for that. So did you</p>
<p>actually make any? I mean, I just happened, but I plan to donate to members of both party who push</p>
<p>for a correct foreign policy, which I believe needs to be a little bit more restrained a little</p>
<p>bit more questioning of what is in it for the United States. And we need to be careful about</p>
<p>overextending ourselves. And we need to ask what is in America&rsquo;s vital interest? And we can support</p>
<p>AOC be coming to the with a with AOC. Oh, she she&rsquo;s pro recanted. So she&rsquo;s one of the ones that</p>
<p>what do you think happens in a situation like that? Well, how do they get them to recant? Yeah,</p>
<p>like why? What is the point of recanting something that was so benign? It&rsquo;s not totally</p>
<p>no, but what do you think? Like what what&rsquo;s happening behind the scenes? Like why are people</p>
<p>so afraid to say that, you know, you can be in support of Ukraine, but also still try to find a</p>
<p>reason why was that turned into such a scarlet letter? It&rsquo;s a great point. And I think it just</p>
<p>shows the heat right now on the issue. Here&rsquo;s what I think does it does it do that? Or does it just</p>
<p>show the progressives as just kind of clown tones? I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s kind of sad. I mean,</p>
<p>Jayapal, who was sort of the leader who put out the letter through her own staff under the bus.</p>
<p>And I guess there was this snafu where the members all signed this letter in July and then</p>
<p>held it for a few months. And then they put it out two weeks before the election. I can see why</p>
<p>that timing didn&rsquo;t make sense. I don&rsquo;t know why, like they released it now, not two months ago,</p>
<p>not three weeks from now after the election. I can understand all those political considerations.</p>
<p>But once you put the letter out to stand by it, don&rsquo;t throw your own staff under the bus.</p>
<p>Because like you&rsquo;re saying, the letter was really a pretty anodyne statement of, hey, listen,</p>
<p>do you think we can just have diplomacy on a parallel track at the same time that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>arming Ukraine? I just don&rsquo;t see the downside. But look, here&rsquo;s why I think they took so much</p>
<p>heat is there&rsquo;s a lot of people on this issue who start with the end result of what they want.</p>
<p>And the end result that they want is that Putin and Russia leave Ukraine with their tail tucked</p>
<p>between their legs. And they basically don&rsquo;t get one square inch of Ukraine. They believe that is</p>
<p>the only acceptable moral outcome here. And they may be right about that. But then what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is they&rsquo;re kind of reverse engineering all the beliefs that they have based on that outcome,</p>
<p>that moral outcome they want to get to. So, for example, for the longest time,</p>
<p>you heard things like Putin is definitely bluffing about using nuclear weapons. Well,</p>
<p>how do they know that? They don&rsquo;t know that. They can&rsquo;t say that for sure. But it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they want to believe. Because if you believe that nuclear war is a possibility, you might not go</p>
<p>all the way for that maximalist position of the only acceptable outcome here is Russia leaving</p>
<p>with his tail tucked between his legs. And I think the same thing is happening here with</p>
<p>diplomacy is people who want a certain result in the war are afraid that diplomacy might result</p>
<p>in something less than that. That&rsquo;s not a reason not to engage in diplomacy. And it&rsquo;s not a reason</p>
<p>to deny the potential of this war to spin out of control, potentially into a nuclear war.</p>
<p>Saks is like a walking thesaurus. So J. Cal, for you, I looked up anodyne and it means</p>
<p>not likely to provoke dissent or offense inoffensive, often deliberately. So yeah,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s like, Oh, I know you were looking, you were looking at the screen, like a confused</p>
<p>little puppy when he said anodyne. Listen, I got a thesaurus over here. Also, I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what it meant. So thank you. But seriously, what is the I want to know the fallout from two things.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to do science corner. So number one, what is the I&rsquo;ve been getting a lot</p>
<p>of oat milk stands emailing me different brands of oat milk have been emailing me this week.</p>
<p>Just give us an update, generally speaking on the alt milk, milk crowd and your inbox tomorrow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to they&rsquo;re definitely trying to bring a doing me but what these people,</p>
<p>like, you know, what&rsquo;s so funny about these folks? They have no judgment clearly. Because they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even say, you know what, it actually tastes much crappier than these alternatives, but I</p>
<p>choose to for x, y, z reasons that I could respect. It&rsquo;s the Oh my god, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s so much better. You know, look at my little mustache.</p>
<p>Disgusting. It doesn&rsquo;t foam properly. It tastes like dishwater. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. And then sacks</p>
<p>disgusting, this horrific illustration of you in the new republic I saw look like Dolly broke and</p>
<p>they use Dolly to make that illustration. No offense to the illustrator got paid 1000 bucks.</p>
<p>It was like it was pre ozempic sacks. I thought it was Yeah, that&rsquo;s the problem. If you&rsquo;re chubby</p>
<p>sacks or chubby j cow. It sucks when people base an illustration on a previous one. But</p>
<p>I mean, you look like Alex Jones. Well, look, they got Elon and Peter up there too. It&rsquo;s such</p>
<p>a stupid hit piece. Elon looks like Hugh Grant. Peter Thiel looks like he&rsquo;s rolling on. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>one. He&rsquo;s got Molly jaw. And also he&rsquo;s a he you show a lot of stubble, which you also don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>But look how fat they make you look. Look at you. Look like</p>
<p>Jesus, my Lord. But what I mean, what&rsquo;s going on in terms of the general reaction to</p>
<p>the amount of attention you&rsquo;re getting for political commentary now,</p>
<p>sacks David sacks will be our next Secretary of State. Well, no, I&rsquo;m here for it. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go along. David sacks will be our Secretary of State within two or three presidents.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got to make a little more cash.</p>
<p>My views, my views are so out of step with the foreign policy establishment.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t feel that&rsquo;s why you that&rsquo;s why I wouldn&rsquo;t feel the need to be so out there on</p>
<p>this issue. If the foreign policy establishment was doing its job. If you actually had, you know,</p>
<p>people from the policy elite going out there saying sensible things about Ukraine, it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fall on me or other people like and China, like Elon basically posted that straw poll on Twitter,</p>
<p>which was totally reasonable, got condemned for it. And then Bill Ackman, actually,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been in Twitter spats with me before we&rsquo;ve been on opposite sides of issues,</p>
<p>actually came out and retweeted something I wrote as basically being supportive.</p>
<p>Because the weird thing was want this war to escalate out of control.</p>
<p>I think the weird thing is people are, there&rsquo;s a group in the in the media class,</p>
<p>other podcasters, other journalists, who are saying you have no right to talk about this topic.</p>
<p>And what I said is, you know, hey, listen, Saxon, I could disagree about things on the margin here</p>
<p>or there. But I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re having the discussion shouldn&rsquo;t all Americans be having a discussion</p>
<p>about our foreign policy and what our goals are. That&rsquo;s our civic duty is to have this discussion.</p>
<p>So whenever you hear the political class, the podcasting class, the coastal elites,</p>
<p>which we are part of, when they tell you, you can&rsquo;t participate, or this person can&rsquo;t participate</p>
<p>in the discussion, because they&rsquo;re successful in this other aspect of life. That&rsquo;s complete</p>
<p>bullshit. Everybody should talk about this and disagree or agree and try to work towards some</p>
<p>common understanding. You&rsquo;re right. So first of all, whenever they say, listen to the experts,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not an expert, first of all, they&rsquo;re expressing an opinion themselves. And they are</p>
<p>expressing equally passionate opinions on the other side about the sole Ukraine war. So first</p>
<p>of all, why are they allowed to have an opinion? So whenever somebody uses this, you&rsquo;re not allowed</p>
<p>to have an opinion argument, it&rsquo;s always very selective. And it&rsquo;s only applied to people they</p>
<p>disagree with, not to people who are equally inexpert on their side of the debate. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point number one. Hold on. Point number two is, I&rsquo;ve listened to plenty of experts, okay? I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>listened to the IR scholar, John Mearsheimer. I&rsquo;ve listened to the international development</p>
<p>economist, Jeffrey Sachs. I&rsquo;ve gone back and listened to our former ambassador to the Soviet</p>
<p>Union, Jack Matlock. I&rsquo;ve read George Kennan&rsquo;s interviews. I&rsquo;ve read Bill Burns, our current CIA</p>
<p>director on this matter. There are plenty of experts who warned that our policy of trying to</p>
<p>bring NATO right up to Russia&rsquo;s border would eventually blow up in our faces. It would poison</p>
<p>our relations with them and lead to conflict and this war. So there are plenty of authoritative</p>
<p>sources going back many years on this topic. And the problem is that the people on the other side</p>
<p>of this debate simply want to memory hole all of these warnings and deny that they that this war</p>
<p>was ever predicted. Because if this war was predicted, it means it could have been avoided.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t want to admit that this war could have been avoided.</p>
<p>Or how about this? How about war is messy, resolving things internationally with dictators</p>
<p>can be very hard. And nobody wins in some of these cases. No, there&rsquo;s no perfect outcome here.</p>
<p>And you could hold in your head two things. Number one, Putin&rsquo;s a dictator, we need to hold the line</p>
<p>and make sure it doesn&rsquo;t invade other countries. And number two, yeah, you probably want to keep</p>
<p>normal relations with these people and negotiate with them to resolve conflict. I&rsquo;m getting a</p>
<p>little concerned about the saber rattling on both sides in China. You know, we&rsquo;re escalating all this</p>
<p>chip stuff. We&rsquo;re escalating and Xi Jinping is taking complete control. I&rsquo;m wondering who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to meet with him? Who&rsquo;s going to talk to Xi Jinping about how we could collaborate together?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s left to talk to him? Tim cook? There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a bunch of unforced errors happening in</p>
<p>China. How do we de escalate? Well, there&rsquo;s a bunch of unforced errors that you have to let</p>
<p>play out because they have huge economic implications. So I don&rsquo;t think this I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think this is a time for again, I think David&rsquo;s generally right. We do not have time for</p>
<p>adventurism right now. Because even before we engage in some of these other places, there are</p>
<p>a lot of, you know, headwinds that are working against for so for example, in China, you have</p>
<p>these massive demographic headwinds that are just building, we have to see what the Chips Act does</p>
<p>in terms of follow through to China&rsquo;s ability to expand militarily or technologically. There are</p>
<p>all of these things that that you owe as a citizen of the United States to see some more data on the</p>
<p>ground in terms of its empirical impact before you re underwrite a different strategy right now,</p>
<p>the strategy is working. You know, we are observing this, you know, one China policy,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the right thing to do. And now let all of this other stuff play out.</p>
<p>Can I say one thing about this? So what the administration did in banning China from buying</p>
<p>from us or any of our allied countries, these advanced semiconductor chips, that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>did. They not only banned the sale of chips to China, they banned the sale of equipment that</p>
<p>can make the chips. And they even prohibited American citizens and companies from working</p>
<p>in China to basically help them set up their own foundries and chip fabrication. So they are</p>
<p>essentially cutting off China for advanced chips. That&rsquo;s the goal here. And you know, we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about on this pod before how chips are the new oil, right? These advanced semiconductors are</p>
<p>the new oil. So this is almost like an oil embargo of China. If you go back and look at it. Yeah,</p>
<p>if you go back and look at it, the reason why the reason why is they don&rsquo;t want these in weapons,</p>
<p>correct? That is the stated reason. That&rsquo;s the tip of the spear. But I think</p>
<p>the more impactful mechanism is to prevent an entire layer of infrastructure to be built in</p>
<p>China that allows them to advance all of these next generation cyber capabilities, including</p>
<p>a whole bunch of things in AI, that we want to make sure that as often and as often as possible</p>
<p>is, is for the United States and our allies as we choose. So all this next generation silicon will</p>
<p>do a lot more to push that forward. And so if you put that in the hands of Chinese technology</p>
<p>companies, or Chinese government, or the Chinese government in the parts that are actually</p>
<p>technological, you actually increase the surface area in which you compete. By preventing that</p>
<p>technology to go to them, you decrease the surface area in which you&rsquo;re competitive, and they are</p>
<p>one or two steps behind and have an are forced to build it themselves.</p>
<p>So Friedberg, if that happens, do you think that China escalates and says, Well,</p>
<p>why are we building iPhones here? No, I think China makes decisions a little differently</p>
<p>than perhaps US policymakers and foreign policy makers make decisions, they think forward and</p>
<p>calculate the series of events that will follow from that decision. Whereas we are typically</p>
<p>reacting to some event that&rsquo;s happened in the past, not necessarily always thinking through</p>
<p>the second and third or third order effects and consequences of our decisions. So the China</p>
<p>calculus would likely look something more like, if we were to say stop making iPhones here,</p>
<p>we would estimate that the US would do the following to retaliate back against us.</p>
<p>And as they do through that calculation, you end up realizing pretty quickly that there isn&rsquo;t as</p>
<p>much to gain as there is more to lose by doing that. That would be my guess. I&rsquo;m no China expert,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no foreign policy expert. But from my understanding of how Chinese policymakers</p>
<p>do think and do make decisions, it&rsquo;s much more about what&rsquo;s the rational calculated</p>
<p>set of outcomes that will emerge and evolve from this decision. And in my experience,</p>
<p>talking with people in the United States that are in various communities of influence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more about let&rsquo;s do what we consider to be the right or moral thing right now.</p>
<p>And in response and retaliation, and let&rsquo;s do an eye for an eye. So that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re likely to be the first step in an escalation escalatory ladder. There probably</p>
<p>be a few more series of provocations before that may happen, at which point it may need to be kind</p>
<p>of an inevitable step that they&rsquo;d have to take. But again, I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, so in terms of</p>
<p>the motivation for this, I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear, this is an attempt to hobble the Chinese economy,</p>
<p>not just that all their weapons programs, but their economy itself, and hold them back and</p>
<p>slow down their rise and their rapid growth. Now, is that a good idea? I mean, I think what this</p>
<p>shows is we&rsquo;ve moved from sort of economic logic, which is about finding trade surplus and win-win</p>
<p>scenarios to geopolitical logic, which is about balance of power. And this sort of ban on sales</p>
<p>of semiconductors to them, it&rsquo;s very much geopolitical, because it&rsquo;s hurting our companies,</p>
<p>but it hurts China more. And so it&rsquo;s about increasing our balance of power against them.</p>
<p>And now listen, I think you can make the argument that we were overdue to be thinking in terms of</p>
<p>great power competition and geopolitical rivalry. And this is an attempt now to correct the bad</p>
<p>decisions that were made 20 years ago in terms of how we fed the Chinese economy until it became</p>
<p>a pure competitor to the United States. So I think you can make those arguments.</p>
<p>The thing that concerns me most about it is, do our leaders really have the bandwidth to manage</p>
<p>a second front in the sort of great power competition right now, while we&rsquo;ve got Russia</p>
<p>and Ukraine going on? On the one hand, are they really ready to manage an escalation</p>
<p>of the competition with China? And to Freeburg&rsquo;s point, have they really thought through</p>
<p>all the second, third, fourth order consequences of this? Have they thought through the incentives</p>
<p>this may create on China, for example, to take Taiwan? I mean, if Taiwan is the place that makes</p>
<p>all these chips through TSMC, for example, and we have now cut them off, we&rsquo;ve now embargoed them</p>
<p>from these chips, does it strengthen China&rsquo;s incentive to go after Taiwan? Does it strengthen</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s incentives right now to help Russia in its war in Ukraine in retaliation, because they</p>
<p>want to see Russia decisively defeated, and then they will solely be in the gun sights of US hawks.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot of things that could go wrong here when the US is now escalating</p>
<p>geopolitical tensions and competition, not just on one front, but on two fronts. And</p>
<p>especially given how weak the US economy is, and that we&rsquo;re headed into a major recession next year,</p>
<p>it just feels to me like they are, you know, they are kind of putting their foot on the accelerator</p>
<p>in terms of geopolitical risk at a time when we&rsquo;re not really in a great spot to be taking those</p>
<p>risks. Also, on a foreign policy basis, is there no common ground? Are there no things we could</p>
<p>collaborate on and work on together? Right? And that&rsquo;s the thing that seems to be missing in the</p>
<p>foreign policy for the last couple of administrations is, are there things that we could</p>
<p>be building together? Are there things that we could be working on the environment, energy,</p>
<p>sustainability, education, I don&rsquo;t know what it is. But it felt like, you know, with China,</p>
<p>for a couple of decades, we felt like we were working in a very collaborative way. And now</p>
<p>it feels like every single instance is adversarial. Right? Because the problem is that those policies</p>
<p>of constructive engagement that you&rsquo;re talking about, fed the Chinese tiger until it became a</p>
<p>dragon. Yeah. Now it&rsquo;s the size of Vegard or something. And the US policy establishment in</p>
<p>the Pentagon look at the rise of China. And they&rsquo;re like, what have we done, we have created</p>
<p>a peer competitor to the United States, we need to stop their economic rise. And I think that,</p>
<p>again, I think there is a geopolitical logic and strategy to what the administration has done.</p>
<p>But I question the timing of doing it at the same time that we have this unresolved war in</p>
<p>Eastern Europe. Well, it is nice that we&rsquo;re seem to be getting some of this onshoring of chips,</p>
<p>and that money is actually starting to flow. It does seem like we&rsquo;re thinking a little bit</p>
<p>like in decades and strategies. The other part, I think Biden and Blinken have done a good job.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done a good job on this right now. They&rsquo;ve played it well. I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>Come on, first of all, horrible job. Hold on a second. Biden did a horrible job. The tiger</p>
<p>you poke the tiger. No, hold on. I&rsquo;ll tell you where they did a bad job is last year,</p>
<p>they had a whole year to negotiate to avoid this Ukraine war from happening. Biden even had a</p>
<p>summit with Putin on June 16. Last year, they never engaged in diplomacy. And now they have</p>
<p>stacked this geopolitical risk with China, on top of the risks they&rsquo;ve already created in Ukraine.</p>
<p>I, this policy may or may not ultimately turn out to be correct. I like I said, I can see the</p>
<p>strategy behind it. But I do not believe that Biden and Blinken have thought through the second,</p>
<p>third and fourth order consequences, just like freeberg said. So I think it&rsquo;s a little early</p>
<p>to be giving them credit on this. All right, Freiberg, you got anything in the science</p>
<p>corner? We gave we gave saxes red meat. And he ripped it to shreds. Now it&rsquo;s time to give you</p>
<p>your soy tofu. But I&rsquo;ll give you guys a quick, a quick science corner, please, please. So we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked in the past about the human gut biome, 10 trillion bacterial cells living in our gut biome.</p>
<p>And it turns out, and there has been this theory for many years, that a lot of human disease</p>
<p>actually originates in the gut. And there&rsquo;s increasingly evidence of how and why this</p>
<p>happens. So it turns out that your immune cells can sometimes see a protein on the outside of a</p>
<p>bacteria that sits in your gut, and it attacks that bacteria, and it tries to get rid of it.</p>
<p>That protein can look a little bit like a human protein at some cell in your body. And so that</p>
<p>then triggers an autoimmune reaction, meaning you are now making these antibodies to proteins</p>
<p>that look a lot like your proteins and other parts of your body. And then your cells start</p>
<p>to destroy yourself. And you end up having inflammation and disease. And they found</p>
<p>evidence of this across a lot of disease states. So just the other day published in the journal</p>
<p>science translational medicine was a really interesting paper by a team that identified</p>
<p>a very specific bacteria that we find in the gut that can actually trigger rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>And so you know, I think 2 million Americans have rheumatoid arthritis, it&rsquo;s a really debilitating</p>
<p>inflammatory disease. And we never understood where the inflammation comes from. Why is the</p>
<p>human immune cell creating antibodies to attack its own protein in the joints of the body. And</p>
<p>now it looks like that the protein that we find in the joints of the body has some overlap or</p>
<p>three dimensional structure that looks similar to the protein we&rsquo;ll find on this very specific gut</p>
<p>bacteria that they found, which creates obviously a path now for if we can stop that gut bacteria</p>
<p>from proliferating or, you know, existing in the gut over time, that can have a reduction,</p>
<p>but sorry, it&rsquo;s a rate of rheumatoid arthritis. Did they guess what the mechanism of action was?</p>
<p>So so this technology, so the mechanism of action is typically what&rsquo;s called generally speaking,</p>
<p>protein mimicry. And so protein mimicry means that there&rsquo;s some so think about a protein as</p>
<p>being like, you know, a clumpy rock. And there&rsquo;s some part of the clumpy rock that looks a little</p>
<p>bit like the part of another clumpy rock. And that&rsquo;s the protein, think about that as being</p>
<p>the protein on the bacterial cell, and the protein in your joint cells. And so your body makes an</p>
<p>antibody to that little part of the rock on the bacterial cell to get rid of it. And then it that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some overlap that looks a little bit like your own cell. And so that&rsquo;s called protein</p>
<p>mimicry. And because of the ability now to do DNA sequencing, and now with, you know, some of the</p>
<p>alpha fold technology, we can actually take the genome from that bacteria, predict the 3d structure</p>
<p>of the proteins created that by that bacteria, and then potentially identify that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>mimicry or an overlap between our own protein and ourselves and the protein of the bacteria,</p>
<p>which is why we&rsquo;re having auto immunity, which now our immune cells are not just attacking the</p>
<p>bacteria, we could solve arthritis, we saw for arthritis. And so there&rsquo;s a lot of disease states</p>
<p>that are starting to look like this. So the combination of DNA sequencing and our ability</p>
<p>to identify organisms in the gut biome, and by the way, so much of this goes back to the gut</p>
<p>biome, we&rsquo;re finding all these disease states from lupus to show grins to rheumatoid arthritis</p>
<p>that have some linkage back to some bacteria that shows up in your gut. And so now we can</p>
<p>be very targeted potentially about eradicating that bacteria from the gut, or, you know,</p>
<p>kind of changing our gut biome in a way that ultimately resolves to eliminating that disease</p>
<p>risk. And so it&rsquo;s really fascinating. Yeah.</p>
<p>Chamath, any thoughts on this gut biome?</p>
<p>I mean, I always knew the solution was either in Freeberg&rsquo;s gut, you know,</p>
<p>in his gut or on Uranus.</p>
<p>Do it again. The joke didn&rsquo;t land.</p>
<p>All right, here we go one more time. So Chamath, any, any feedback on this? It&rsquo;s pretty,</p>
<p>pretty great science going on here.</p>
<p>I mean, it was always 50 50 that the solution was either your guts or Uranus.</p>
<p>Okay, you can&rsquo;t laugh till after you land the joke. Come on, do it again.</p>
<p>I saw it coming. It was coming around the corner and</p>
<p>By the way, I think you guys should leave this all in.</p>
<p>I started peeking out of</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get this right for the fans.</p>
<p>Okay, here we go. Three, two. All right, Chamath, it seems like very interesting science.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming to the science corner.</p>
<p>50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, it&rsquo;s like the entire science corner is just here for us</p>
<p>to beat up the nerd and throw them in a locker.</p>
<p>My stomach is hurting.</p>
<p>You ever see Smokey and the Bandit where they have the reels at the end,</p>
<p>Saks, like Don DeLuise and Burrattles.</p>
<p>I just keep losing it. That&rsquo;s what this is.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to say science quarter and people are going to just start laughing</p>
<p>and thinking about Freeburg Zetas.</p>
<p>All right, listen.</p>
<p>Welcome home, Saks. We missed you for your week off.</p>
<p>And we missed you, David.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Thanks. And we&rsquo;ll see you over on Market Street.</p>
<p>No announcements right now. No testimonials, no announcements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you at yoga. We&rsquo;re going to do a doing a science.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you at the homeless shelter. We&rsquo;re volunteering today, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, volunteering. I&rsquo;ll see you over at the homeless shelter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pouring soup?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you could get me a tofu salad with extra tempeh before Freeburg eats it all.</p>
<p>Tempeh.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t go. Don&rsquo;t get me started on tempeh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go. I&rsquo;m going to pour all the oatmeal out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going right to the cafeteria. I&rsquo;m going right to the cafe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting all the oatmeal right down the drain.</p>
<p>Me and Saks are emptying the oatmeal.</p>
<p>There should be one non-lactose alternative and then one milk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called black coffee. It&rsquo;s called black coffee. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lactose intolerant, yeah, lactose intolerant milk.</p>
<p>No, have one thing without lactose.</p>
<p>Can we wrap the show now?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re having too much fun.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a what&rsquo;s a can you imagine?</p>
<p>Can you imagine the distribution of gluten-free snacks?</p>
<p>I mean, they should have a few, but you know, all kinds of different snacks.</p>
<p>And by the way, the keto snacks have horrendous amounts of chemicals in it.</p>
<p>The xylitol. What is xylitol?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s xylitol.</p>
<p>Well, screw up your stomach, man. Do not have that horrible flavor.</p>
<p>You want to tell everybody about xylitol and the impact it has on your anus?</p>
<p>No, it seriously does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I think xylitol is the thing that gives you a lot of gas.</p>
<p>You just keep ripping.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really bad for you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p>Way to go, Jay Cowell.</p>
<p>Yeah, now he&rsquo;s going to turn into a school shooter.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s your fault. You were mean to him.</p>
<p>You came up with the anus jokes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing that joke for five years with him.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>You bullied Freeberg off the show.</p>
<p>You brigaded him.</p>
<p>We brigaded him off the show.</p>
<p>We brigadooned him.</p>
<p>We brigadooned our bestie.</p>
<p>Sorry, bestie.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>For the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya going into sweater season,</p>
<p>I might note it&rsquo;s going to be a big, big Q4 for us.</p>
<p>Big Q4.</p>
<p>And the beep of the beep corporation, David Sachs.</p>
<p>Oh, if you mean the general partner of Kraft Ventures.</p>
<p>Yes, the general partner of Kraft Ventures.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And the queen of quinoa, the prince of panic attacks, the ambassador of Uranus,</p>
<p>David Freeberg.</p>
<p>We will see you next time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jay Cowell.</p>
<p>Love you, boys.</p>
<p>Greatest moderator.</p>
<p>I love you, bestie.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Your winner&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big Q, Georgie,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this, like, sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the bee.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bee.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bee.</p>
<p>Bee?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a bee.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
