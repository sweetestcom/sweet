    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Our card this week is Leah Ulbrich, the Three of Clubs from Connecticut.</p>
<p>For months now, I&rsquo;ve anticipated the release of this episode for a few reasons.</p>
<p>One is because the investigation is still very active and new discoveries were made</p>
<p>while our team was reporting on Leah&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Actual breakthroughs that could lead to her murder getting solved.</p>
<p>And the second reason is because Leah&rsquo;s family,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been waiting nearly 30 years for answers, talked to us for this episode.</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;re trying to tell someone&rsquo;s story and truly do it justice,</p>
<p>nothing compares to hearing from the people who love them the most.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On October 29th, 1995, Bill Fleming, a courier for the Hartford Courant in Connecticut,</p>
<p>was just finishing his Sunday morning delivery route for the day&rsquo;s newspaper.</p>
<p>It was just after 4.45 a.m. when he saw something that alarmed him.</p>
<p>As Bill was turning into the parking lot of the newspaper&rsquo;s distribution facility in</p>
<p>Hartford,</p>
<p>he saw what appeared to be a man and a woman inside a car having a fight.</p>
<p>When he did a double take,</p>
<p>he saw the man hitting the woman, and he could hear her screaming.</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s adrenaline kicked in, so he turned his car around, ready to intervene.</p>
<p>But as he approached, the car sped off,</p>
<p>and Bill could see what appeared to be the man in the driver&rsquo;s seat shoving the woman</p>
<p>out of the car as the car took off down the road with the passenger door still open.</p>
<p>But the woman hadn&rsquo;t fallen out.</p>
<p>She was dangling out of the side of the car.</p>
<p>It was still pretty dark outside before sunrise,</p>
<p>and Bill couldn&rsquo;t tell if the woman was, like, grasping onto something on the side</p>
<p>of the car,</p>
<p>or if she was actually caught and couldn&rsquo;t get loose.</p>
<p>But either way, the woman was clearly being dragged at a high speed down a busy Hartford</p>
<p>street.</p>
<p>Bill was still in his delivery box truck, and he tried to chase the car, but he couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep up.</p>
<p>According to a 1995 Hartford Courant article,</p>
<p>Bill later told reporters that the car, quote,</p>
<p>took off like a bat out of hell.</p>
<p>According to Hartford police detective Drew Jacobson, who&rsquo;s working the case today,</p>
<p>it was 4.49 a.m. when Bill radioed a Hartford Courant truck dispatcher who called police.</p>
<p>When the call came in, an officer named Martin Burke actually just happened to already be</p>
<p>patrolling in the area.</p>
<p>There was a patrolman that was driving northbound on Wethersfield Avenue,</p>
<p>kind of coming closer to that intersection as the 911 call came in.</p>
<p>And as he got up to the intersection, he drove through the intersection slowly and he saw</p>
<p>the car coming up.</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson said that the car was driving without headlights on, which got Officer Burke&rsquo;s</p>
<p>attention.</p>
<p>The dispatchers alerted him to the call they&rsquo;d just gotten, and that&rsquo;s when he noticed something</p>
<p>being dragged alongside the car.</p>
<p>So he made a U-turn and tried to pull the car over, which just made it drive faster.</p>
<p>The car left and went southbound on Wethersfield Avenue into Hartford to an adjoining city,</p>
<p>crossed over in the city&rsquo;s actually Wethersfield, Connecticut.</p>
<p>He headed then west on another road into that town.</p>
<p>Officer Burke then saw the car run a red light.</p>
<p>It took off at such a high rate of speed, it was so far away from him, he just, he could</p>
<p>never catch up.</p>
<p>After a couple miles of chasing, the suspect had gotten away.</p>
<p>So Officer Burke radioed out for other patrol cars to be on the lookout for the car, which</p>
<p>he thought looked like a brown sedan with a yellow temporary license plate in the back</p>
<p>windshield.</p>
<p>He also said over the radio that the car&rsquo;s passenger door was ajar and something, or</p>
<p>someone, was hanging out the side.</p>
<p>Officer Burke then slowed down and noticed the car had left something horrifying in its</p>
<p>path, a trail of skin and bodily fluids.</p>
<p>He followed the path, and a little further away, he saw what appeared to be a body on</p>
<p>the side of the road, so he pulled over.</p>
<p>Officer Burke went over to it, and he saw that it was a woman.</p>
<p>She was lying off the side of Ridge Road in Wethersfield.</p>
<p>You see, during the chase, Officer Burke had left the city of Hartford and crossed over</p>
<p>into the city of Wethersfield, which is about a 10-minute drive south of Hartford.</p>
<p>When he looked down at her, it was clear that she was in bad shape.</p>
<p>There were road rashes all over her body that were so gruesome and severe that she looked</p>
<p>like a burn victim.</p>
<p>Officer Burke notified his supervisor at the Hartford Police Department, who responded,</p>
<p>along with paramedics and Wethersfield Police.</p>
<p>When paramedics arrived, they checked the woman for any signs of life, but she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a pulse, and she was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>She also didn&rsquo;t have any ID on her, so they didn&rsquo;t know who she was, but they could</p>
<p>tell that she looked young, maybe early 20s, and she had dark hair.</p>
<p>First responders covered her up with a white cloth while they waited for a medical examiner</p>
<p>to get there, and police started taping off the scene and looking for evidence.</p>
<p>Hartford knew that they had their work cut out for them, not only because the suspect</p>
<p>car had gotten away, but the actual crime scene itself was huge.</p>
<p>Investigators today still believe it is the largest crime scene in Connecticut&rsquo;s history,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because the crime had started in Hartford and stretched over four miles.</p>
<p>But the good news was, police knew that that meant there was a good chance they&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>able to find other witnesses.</p>
<p>You see, between Hartford and Wethersfield is a metro area, so it is dense with industrial</p>
<p>and residential neighborhoods between the two cities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a busy area.</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s, where he was going down Wethersfield Avenue, there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>all over the place, even at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of people that live over in that area that are walking, and probably people</p>
<p>coming from Wethersfield, driving into the city to go to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the avenues, you know, if you don&rsquo;t want to go on the highway.</p>
<p>Police knew their first step would be to retrace the whole route to properly process</p>
<p>the entire scene.</p>
<p>So Hartford police went back to where it started, on the street near the newspaper&rsquo;s distribution</p>
<p>center.</p>
<p>There, they found the woman&rsquo;s pants, her shoes, and a power cord, like the kind that</p>
<p>you plug into a cigarette lighter, right where Bill Fleming said the car had been parked.</p>
<p>They also had some crime scene investigators examine a scene in Wethersfield where her</p>
<p>body was, and there they found a hair scrunchie, pieces of the woman&rsquo;s torn shirt, and some</p>
<p>other items that may or may not have been related, like a Snapple bottle and a pack</p>
<p>of cigarettes nearby.</p>
<p>And you might be thinking, like, of course they&rsquo;re related.</p>
<p>But you see, the area where Officer Burke found the woman&rsquo;s body was a construction</p>
<p>zone at the time, so there was some litter strewn about.</p>
<p>But they still photographed and collected everything they thought might be related to</p>
<p>the woman&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Police even took note of some drag marks just off the road.</p>
<p>It looks like maybe he tried to dislodge her from the car because there were tire marks</p>
<p>that went up onto the grass.</p>
<p>Later that morning, the medical examiner collected the woman&rsquo;s body from the scene to take her</p>
<p>for autopsy and identification.</p>
<p>While police waited to find out the woman&rsquo;s name, they went to interview witnesses.</p>
<p>The courier, Bill Fleming, told police what he&rsquo;d seen, and though he didn&rsquo;t get a great</p>
<p>look at the man, he thought that he was white, with dark hair combed back.</p>
<p>Bill also gave the same description of the car as Officer Burke, a brownish car with</p>
<p>a yellow maybe temporary tags in the back window, but neither of them were able to actually</p>
<p>read the paper license plate.</p>
<p>Police knew that if they were going to make any headway, they had to find more witnesses.</p>
<p>And they were hopeful that they could maybe even find someone who had gotten a better</p>
<p>look at the license plate, or even the driver, since the whole crime took place on a busy</p>
<p>street.</p>
<p>Initial canvassing was a bust.</p>
<p>When they knocked on the door of an apartment along the route where the woman had been dragged,</p>
<p>a lady answered the door and told officers that she had heard screaming around 5 a.m.,</p>
<p>but she said she didn&rsquo;t go outside.</p>
<p>In fact, she didn&rsquo;t even look outside to see what the commotion was because she said she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to get involved.</p>
<p>But a few hours later, around mid-morning that same day, a dispatcher relayed to Hartford</p>
<p>officers that at least one other witness had actually called in earlier that morning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a woman that I guess just says that sounds like she&rsquo;s out there and there&rsquo;s a woman being</p>
<p>dragged.</p>
<p>Dispatchers said that the woman wouldn&rsquo;t give them her name.</p>
<p>And when officers tried to track her call so they could try and interview her for more</p>
<p>details, nothing came up, which made them think that she might have called in from a</p>
<p>street payphone.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, the woman would have been really close to the suspect&rsquo;s car as it passed</p>
<p>by her.</p>
<p>But she may have gotten a better look at the man.</p>
<p>We were never able to identify who that is.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s calling from basically an anonymous call, so it&rsquo;s not coming back to her apartment</p>
<p>or anything.</p>
<p>That woman is still unidentified to this day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the things that police are hoping this episode can help with.</p>
<p>Someone out there knows who that woman is, or maybe that woman is listening to this right</p>
<p>now never knowing that police were looking for her.</p>
<p>Back then, officers were starting to get frustrated with how little information they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been able to uncover.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s when they got notice from the medical examiner.</p>
<p>They had determined the woman&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Her name was Leah Ulbrich.</p>
<p>They were able to identify 24-year-old Leah by a tattoo on the inside of her ankle that</p>
<p>read OZZY, O-Z-Z-Y in all caps.</p>
<p>When they ran that tattoo to see if it was in any prior criminal records, it actually</p>
<p>came back as a match to Leah.</p>
<p>Then her identity was officially confirmed by comparing her fingerprints to that same</p>
<p>record.</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson said that Leah&rsquo;s tattoos and fingerprints were in the system because</p>
<p>she had done jail time the year before on drug-related charges.</p>
<p>And anyone with a felony conviction gets fingerprints and body markings like tattoos noted in their</p>
<p>file.</p>
<p>Besides her name, the ME&rsquo;s report also gave them a cause and manner of death, though it</p>
<p>took a long time to complete the autopsy because over 80% of Leah&rsquo;s body had suffered severe</p>
<p>trauma from being dragged on pavement.</p>
<p>It took three hours and 15 minutes and the cause of death was certified as extensive</p>
<p>blunt trauma and the manner of death homicide.</p>
<p>We got a copy of the autopsy report and in it there is a sketch of a human figure with</p>
<p>darkened scribbles over the areas of Leah&rsquo;s body that suffered, quote, severe bruising</p>
<p>and trauma.</p>
<p>You can actually see it along with some other crime scene photos on thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>By the time investigators knew Leah&rsquo;s name, it was late afternoon, but now they could</p>
<p>track down her family members to not only notify them of Leah&rsquo;s death, but to see if</p>
<p>they could find out any important information, like if they knew whose car Leah had been</p>
<p>in at five o&rsquo;clock that morning.</p>
<p>Police found out Leah had an ex-husband named Bobby, who they tracked down and questioned</p>
<p>right away.</p>
<p>Bobby seemed shocked to hear what had happened to Leah and he told investigators that he</p>
<p>and Leah had gotten married in 1989 and had two kids, Ryan and Abby, but by 1991 they</p>
<p>had split up.</p>
<p>He said Leah had gotten out of drug rehab in the summer of 1995 and the last he&rsquo;d heard</p>
<p>she was doing well.</p>
<p>She was clean and even got to have a visit with her kids a few weeks before.</p>
<p>Now investigators knew that Bobby also had a history of drug use, so he said that his</p>
<p>parents and Leah&rsquo;s parents often helped care for their kids.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t say in the police reports exactly how Bobby was ruled out as a suspect</p>
<p>in Leah&rsquo;s murder, but police said that he provided a solid alibi.</p>
<p>So from there, officers contacted Leah and Bobby&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p>Leah&rsquo;s dad, Bob Baskin, was in Washington D.C. for work when his daughter died.</p>
<p>Bob talked to our team for this episode.</p>
<p>On a Sunday evening at 9.30 in the evening, our phone rang, which was a little unusual,</p>
<p>and I answered the phone and it was the state police informing me that Leah had been murdered.</p>
<p>I can tell you every minute about what those first 24 hours were like.</p>
<p>Bob said he hopped on the next flight from D.C. to LaGuardia and got a rental car to</p>
<p>drive up to Connecticut.</p>
<p>By this time, Leah&rsquo;s death was starting to hit the local news.</p>
<p>I turned on the news, the local news, because I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of details at that point</p>
<p>in time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably one of the toughest hours of my life because they were reporting how</p>
<p>she had been dragged for four and a half miles.</p>
<p>Bob was beside himself.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t met with any investigators yet, so up to that point, he didn&rsquo;t know exactly</p>
<p>how his daughter had died.</p>
<p>I mean, he was still processing the fact that his daughter had been murdered, and then to</p>
<p>learn she&rsquo;d been murdered in that way, it was overwhelming for him.</p>
<p>That anybody could do to her what was done is unconscionable to me.</p>
<p>Bob knew that he needed to talk to police and make funeral arrangements, and most importantly,</p>
<p>make sure Leah&rsquo;s kids, who were both under the age of six at the time, were taken care of.</p>
<p>If that trip from LaGuardia back up to Connecticut was one of the most difficult hours I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>the worst 10 minutes I&rsquo;ve ever had was having to tell Ryan and Abby that their mother was</p>
<p>not ever going to come back.</p>
<p>But I said to them that while physically their mother was not there, she was always going</p>
<p>to be there because a part of her is in them.</p>
<p>And I believe that to this day.</p>
<p>Bob said that next day, he got into survival mode.</p>
<p>And because he didn&rsquo;t like the way his daughter was being portrayed in the news, he called</p>
<p>the reporters himself and said that he would tell them about the real Leah.</p>
<p>Some people say, yeah, but she was a druggie and all of this stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, she was addicted to it with a disease.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t stop her from loving her children, and it didn&rsquo;t stop me from loving her.</p>
<p>Leah was a kid with so many attributes who made some wrong decisions and unfortunately</p>
<p>put herself in the wrong place at the wrong time and paid the price for it.</p>
<p>Hearing Bob talk about Leah just twisted me up inside, and it must have made an impact</p>
<p>with reporters, too, because headlines about Leah softened and the story started to feature</p>
<p>interviews with her parents and even her former in-laws, rather than just focusing on her</p>
<p>criminal record.</p>
<p>Articles shared stories about Leah&rsquo;s childhood achievements, like her artistic abilities,</p>
<p>her high IQ, and her natural beauty.</p>
<p>Accompanying details about Leah in those articles was a description of the suspect in his car,</p>
<p>and police and Leah&rsquo;s family waited and hoped that someone, somewhere, with information</p>
<p>would finally do the right thing and come forward.</p>
<p>And then, on November 3rd, just a few days after Leah&rsquo;s murder, Hartford police got</p>
<p>a strange phone call.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s hard to hear, so I&rsquo;m going to have voice actors summarize the call for you based</p>
<p>on a transcript that we got from Detective Jacobson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been edited and shortened a little for clarity.</p>
<p>Oh, because if we could use a witness, it would be nice.</p>
<p>Well, none of us are totally good men.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes, and eventually we pay for them.</p>
<p>What are they going to do when they find him?</p>
<p>Well, we have no idea where he is or who he is yet.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a clue?</p>
<p>Do you have anything whatsoever?</p>
<p>Oh, sure. They got some witnesses.</p>
<p>There are people who saw it.</p>
<p>A lady called who saw the guy, but we don&rsquo;t know her name.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to find her.</p>
<p>You know something?</p>
<p>I happen to think I know who that was.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>You think so, huh?</p>
<p>Are you there?</p>
<p>Police never could identify or track down this caller, and it&rsquo;s someone investigators</p>
<p>today remain suspicious of.</p>
<p>He calls and starts asking questions about what happened to her.</p>
<p>Do the cops have any leads?</p>
<p>Do they know what kind of car it is?</p>
<p>And then he starts, he says, I think it says three times in 12 minutes,</p>
<p>my guts really hurt.</p>
<p>My guts really hurt.</p>
<p>I feel terrible for Leah, but my guts don&rsquo;t hurt because I wasn&rsquo;t involved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to guess it&rsquo;s probably a little bit of a guilty conscious or something to that effect.</p>
<p>The dispatcher wrote up the details of the call in a police report in case an officer</p>
<p>could follow up on it later.</p>
<p>As days went by, police continued interviewing Leah&rsquo;s family and friends.</p>
<p>They learned about a loving mom who struggled with an addiction to crack cocaine.</p>
<p>Her stints of sobriety came and went between rehabilitation efforts.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s her dad, Bob, again.</p>
<p>She went through a whole series of different programs, not doing well particularly or completing</p>
<p>them in many, many cases.</p>
<p>But in 1995, she went to a program at the Elmcrest Hospital in Portland, Connecticut,</p>
<p>and she completed the course and came out of that really in what looked like so much</p>
<p>better shape than she had been in for a long time.</p>
<p>Bob said that the last time he saw his daughter was a few weeks before she died.</p>
<p>They met for lunch and she had completed the latest rehab program successfully.</p>
<p>She was struggling with transitioning back into a healthy daily routine, but there was</p>
<p>a lot of hope for the future.</p>
<p>But now, Leah&rsquo;s future had been taken away, and it seemed like the case was at a standstill.</p>
<p>That is, until about a week after Leah&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when someone accidentally came across some key evidence.</p>
<p>You ready for a crazy twist?</p>
<p>On November 6th, a postman on the north end of Hartford was on his usual route when he</p>
<p>noticed some vandals must have been out on Halloween night egging some mailboxes, like</p>
<p>they did every year, because there were broken shells and yolks on some of the U.S. Postal</p>
<p>Service mailboxes.</p>
<p>Then he got to the mailbox on Burton and Homestead Avenue.</p>
<p>And when he opens it up to get the mail out, there&rsquo;s like eggs and crap, somebody must</p>
<p>have thrown eggs in there.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s mail and in the bottom of it is Leah Albrecht&rsquo;s passport.</p>
<p>Also in the mailbox was a prescription drug card, also belonging to Leah.</p>
<p>The passport and the card stuck out among the white envelopes.</p>
<p>The postal worker had seen the news about Leah&rsquo;s murder, so when he saw her name on</p>
<p>the items, he called police right away.</p>
<p>Police seized Leah&rsquo;s passport and prescription card and added them to the growing list of</p>
<p>evidence.</p>
<p>At this point in the investigation, investigators had collected Leah&rsquo;s shoes, pants, parts</p>
<p>of her shirt, four metal earrings that were still in her ears when she was found, a pack</p>
<p>of cigarettes, that power cord, a hair scrunchie, her fingernail clippings from the autopsy,</p>
<p>and chunks of her hair that were found along the street between Hartford and Wethersfield.</p>
<p>Now they tried dusting the passport and the prescription card for fingerprints, but there</p>
<p>were egg yolks all over everything and testing turned up nothing.</p>
<p>When news hit about the postman&rsquo;s discovery, it prompted the first big break in the case.</p>
<p>A man called police and said that he worked at a place a few blocks away from the mailbox</p>
<p>where the passport was found, and he said that he worked with a man who might have killed</p>
<p>Leah Ulbrich.</p>
<p>He said, hey, listen, I got a co-worker that&rsquo;s kind of fitting the description of this white</p>
<p>male with pushback hair.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got this car.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little damage on the passenger side and that this man says when he approaches</p>
<p>the owner of the car, who&rsquo;s a co-worker, the co-worker gets pissed and he&rsquo;s irate.</p>
<p>You know, what the hell are you doing looking at my car?</p>
<p>And so he kind of gives the tip to the police department.</p>
<p>Hartford police did a little digging and found out that this guy&rsquo;s co-worker did fit the</p>
<p>description of their suspect, white, thin billed, dark pushback hair.</p>
<p>And like we said, he worked really close to the mailbox where Leah&rsquo;s stuff was dumped.</p>
<p>And on top of that, he had a dark colored car with some damage on the passenger side.</p>
<p>Is it coincidence that he owns the same kind of car?</p>
<p>It kind of looks like what the description is, and there&rsquo;s a little bit of damage on</p>
<p>the car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but it&rsquo;s really weird that her passport&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Officers back in 95 were like, this has got to be our guy.</p>
<p>They did a background check before calling him in for an interview.</p>
<p>And the man did have a criminal record, but nothing super serious or violent.</p>
<p>And he agreed to be questioned by police.</p>
<p>He provided no information, said he didn&rsquo;t know who the victim was.</p>
<p>He denied having anything to do with Leah&rsquo;s awful death.</p>
<p>And since police didn&rsquo;t have any concrete evidence tying him to Leah&rsquo;s murder, they</p>
<p>had to let him go.</p>
<p>Desperate to find any sort of concrete evidence, police tried to see if they could get any</p>
<p>information about cars with temporary license plates to see if they were registered to this</p>
<p>man or any other potential suspects.</p>
<p>The investigators back then actually did an incredible job and they got a copy of every</p>
<p>single temporary Connecticut plate in the state of Connecticut for a certain period</p>
<p>of time.</p>
<p>And I have those here.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve had them, I had an intern go through and categorize them by vehicle type.</p>
<p>The search came back with 50 cars that had temporary Connecticut tags on October 29th,</p>
<p>1995.</p>
<p>But somehow, none of them belonged to their person of interest.</p>
<p>A few days later, on November 9th, a $20,000 reward was announced for any information that</p>
<p>could lead police to Leah&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>Tips came in, but they ultimately led nowhere.</p>
<p>And despite there being so many possibilities, from evidence to witnesses, the case went</p>
<p>cold.</p>
<p>Barely any new leads were discovered over the next several years.</p>
<p>Then, in early 1999, an internal corruption probe at the Hartford Police Department revealed</p>
<p>at least four different officers had been forcing women to have sex with them while</p>
<p>on duty.</p>
<p>According to an April 1999 article on the front page of the Hartford Courant, the sex</p>
<p>assault investigation got underway when one of the victims came forward.</p>
<p>According to their reporting, four Hartford officers were charged in connection with assaulting</p>
<p>sex workers.</p>
<p>And I want to be clear, Leah Ulbrich did not have a known history of sex work.</p>
<p>No one knows what she was doing inside that car before she died.</p>
<p>But the area of town and the descriptions of the suspect, coupled with the police sex</p>
<p>assault scandal, led detectives to wonder if they should look inside their own ranks</p>
<p>for Leah&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>And so you can kind of see where investigators back then kind of started scratching their</p>
<p>head saying, well, I wonder if one of these guys got nervous.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a police officer.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t want to get caught, obviously.</p>
<p>Well, nobody wants to get caught, but definitely doesn&rsquo;t want to get caught and then took off.</p>
<p>If I ever got DNA, and the DNA never, I never got a CODIS hit, it would make sense.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re a police officer, my DNA certainly is not going to be a CODIS because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a convicted felon.</p>
<p>They probably looked at a list of people that were maybe under investigation or they thought</p>
<p>might have been involved, and then they tried to figure out which guys maybe fit the description.</p>
<p>And then who was working, who wasn&rsquo;t working, their locations at the time of the incident,</p>
<p>and then included or excluded people that way.</p>
<p>The possibility that a cop killed Leah has never truly been ruled out.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t turn my eyes to it and say, no, it didn&rsquo;t happen, or it&rsquo;s definitely not a cop.</p>
<p>Until I get a definitive answer, anything is a possibility.</p>
<p>In 2001, a joint investigation was initiated between the Hartford Police Department, the</p>
<p>Wethersfield Police Department, and the cold case unit of the Office of the Connecticut</p>
<p>Chief State&rsquo;s Attorney.</p>
<p>And the reward for information in Leah&rsquo;s case was up to $50,000.</p>
<p>The original person of interest, that co-worker guy from 1995, who we&rsquo;re going to call Max,</p>
<p>was re-interviewed by investigators in 2003 after his former co-worker called again asking</p>
<p>whatever happened to his original tip about the guy, and the tipster said he just knew</p>
<p>Max did it.</p>
<p>But Max still denied any involvement, and police were still lacking any evidence that</p>
<p>linked him to Leah&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Was he ever really ruled out or no?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m still interested in him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still more work to be done.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not at the, you know, we&rsquo;re not at the very, very end.</p>
<p>If we can get somebody to come forward and provide more, you know, more tips or if they</p>
<p>remember the incident, if they could call us even anonymously and provide a little bit</p>
<p>of information, at least kind of point us in the right direction, that would, that would</p>
<p>be a huge help. So we&rsquo;re not spinning our wheels going through mountains of paperwork</p>
<p>and endless leads that don&rsquo;t get us anywhere.</p>
<p>As detectives have worked over the years to solve Leah&rsquo;s murder, her kids, Ryan and</p>
<p>Abby, had to grow up without a mom and without a dad.</p>
<p>A few years after Leah died, their father Bobby also passed away, so they were taken</p>
<p>in by their grandparents.</p>
<p>We actually got to talk to Leah&rsquo;s daughter Abby.</p>
<p>In a strange turn of events, she happens to be a crime junkie, and after our first episode</p>
<p>of The Deck aired, she sent an email directly to me asking if we could cover her mom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>And what was wild was by the time she had reached out, our reporter Emily had already</p>
<p>done most of her reporting for this episode, and she was about to start writing.</p>
<p>Something about it seemed like fate to me, and maybe other people who&rsquo;ve dealt with</p>
<p>cases longer and are more cynical than me would say it&rsquo;s just a coincidence.</p>
<p>But to me, I don&rsquo;t know, there is something about Leah&rsquo;s case that makes me think answers</p>
<p>are just around the corner.</p>
<p>Emily was able to talk to Abby, who was just a toddler at the time of her mom&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>You know, going through the 20s and even turning 24, which was the age she was when she died,</p>
<p>was surreal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what her voice sounds like or what she smelled like or even what she</p>
<p>looks like except through pictures.</p>
<p>Abby said that her mother&rsquo;s death greatly affected her life.</p>
<p>She remembers being little and everyone around her just being sad all the time, and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>had periods of anxiety and depression that she&rsquo;s worked hard to overcome.</p>
<p>Just talking about it all the time, even though that&rsquo;s not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, it really</p>
<p>helps me just get it out and release it and feel better.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m able to talk about it without being so emotional.</p>
<p>It took a long time and a lot of sad nights.</p>
<p>When we were really young, when it first happened, my grandma obviously didn&rsquo;t tell us really</p>
<p>how, but we knew that somebody took her from us and we knew it was bad.</p>
<p>It was scary to think that somebody could do that to another human being.</p>
<p>And sometimes when I was younger, I thought, could that happen to me?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s all you know, and it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>Abby&rsquo;s relatives say that she reminds them of Leah in a lot of ways, which helps her</p>
<p>feel closer to her mom.</p>
<p>Everyone says that I look just like her, and I mean, from the pictures, yeah, I&rsquo;d say I</p>
<p>definitely do.</p>
<p>I was actually just talking to my aunt and she told me my voice is very similar to hers.</p>
<p>And from what I understand, my mom was extremely creative and that&rsquo;s definitely something that</p>
<p>I got.</p>
<p>I loved to knit and crochet like an old woman at 30 years old.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always loved that stuff.</p>
<p>So I definitely think that&rsquo;s from her.</p>
<p>After learning everything Abby and her brother Ryan had to overcome, they&rsquo;re both successful</p>
<p>adults today, and their grandparents know Leah would be so proud of them.</p>
<p>Abby herself became a mom last year, and she said it&rsquo;s made her realize even more just</p>
<p>how much she missed out on.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what it was like to even have a mom, that having a child, it&rsquo;s like, wow,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things that could have been different.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just sad.</p>
<p>Knowing that detectives are still working to solve her mom&rsquo;s case using modern technology</p>
<p>like DNA testing gives Leah&rsquo;s family hope that they might someday know who killed her.</p>
<p>It makes me cry to think about because that would just be the greatest thing, you know,</p>
<p>to finally have answers and have somebody, you know, held accountable for their actions</p>
<p>and just to be able to end that chapter that&rsquo;s been so hard for all of us would just be just</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson has been working Leah&rsquo;s case for a decade now, and he&rsquo;s submitted</p>
<p>old items of evidence for DNA testing as recently as fall of 2021.</p>
<p>None of those efforts have resulted in a match yet.</p>
<p>But every time he opens the case file, he finds new hope in old items that he hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sent in for testing yet.</p>
<p>And those could be the key.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t feeling great because I had submitted the clothing and the passports and the power</p>
<p>cord and I was getting essentially no DNA information at all, like nothing to compare</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>But I would say since our last conversation, I think I flipped through part of this once,</p>
<p>but you obviously forced me to kind of like read through stuff.</p>
<p>And so my opinion of it has changed because now there&rsquo;s a Snapple bottle, which should</p>
<p>be loaded with DNA.</p>
<p>I did notice that somebody collected cigarette butts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where those are, but I know that when I mentioned cigarette butts to a DNA</p>
<p>analyst, they get all crazy.</p>
<p>They love that because I guess it gets really loaded up.</p>
<p>Detective Jacobson said his motivation to solve Leah&rsquo;s case is twofold.</p>
<p>Thinking about the pain Leah suffered as she died and thinking about her family.</p>
<p>Leah&rsquo;s dad, Bob, is 80 years old, and while he doesn&rsquo;t hold a grudge against anyone,</p>
<p>not even his daughter&rsquo;s killer, he would love nothing more than to have answers.</p>
<p>What about the person who did this to her?</p>
<p>Do you ever think about that person or wonder how they&rsquo;ve lived with that guilt all these</p>
<p>years?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>I wish that somebody had, that he had more of a moral fiber to come forth even at this</p>
<p>late time.</p>
<p>He affected lots and lots of people, not just my daughter.</p>
<p>He affected a whole slew of family members and in particular her children, Ryan and Abby.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not right and it&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>But while I have forgiven him, I don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t get solved, which I really, I don&rsquo;t know, I have this like feeling.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get hopeful, but we all will be okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dealt with it for so long, but the thought of thinking that there could be some answers,</p>
<p>you know, she was on this earth for 24 years and she&rsquo;s been off this earth for 26.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy to think that she&rsquo;s been gone longer than she was here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just not fair.</p>
<p>And whoever did this needs to know that they&rsquo;ve destroyed a family and ruined the opportunity</p>
<p>for me to have known my mom.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s time somebody is held accountable for that.</p>
<p>If you witnessed the horrific murder of Leah Albrecht in Hartford, Connecticut in October</p>
<p>1995, it is time to speak up.</p>
<p>Or if you are the anonymous woman who called to report the crime, or if you know who that</p>
<p>was, it is time to tell police.</p>
<p>And if you have any information at all, call the Connecticut Cold Case Unit at 860-548-0606.</p>
