    <p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>So, I am a Dan Jones fan,</p>
<p>and many of you are, too, no doubt.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of our finest writers of history</p>
<p>for the period in the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>you know, the fall of Rome to the Renaissance.</p>
<p>A lot of stuff that made up</p>
<p>what a lot of us grew up with loving.</p>
<p>I mean, if you had&hellip;</p>
<p>Knights in shining armor, Crusades, Norman Saxons,</p>
<p>I mean, this is pretty par for the course</p>
<p>for a lot of history fans, and&hellip;</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s your jam,</p>
<p>then you need to pick up Dan Jones&rsquo; new book,</p>
<p>Powers and Thrones.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s with us today to talk about it.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve probably already read his stuff.</p>
<p>The Plantagenet&rsquo;s was great.</p>
<p>The Wars of the Roses, Crusaders,</p>
<p>the Templars, Magna Carta.</p>
<p>The book covers the entire period</p>
<p>from the fall of Rome to the Renaissance</p>
<p>in the European, Middle Eastern, North African sort of zone.</p>
<p>656 pages.</p>
<p>I looked it up, covering a thousand years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s audacious, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But just like there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting stuff</p>
<p>you can glean from a very narrowly focused,</p>
<p>you know, targeted work on a small chunk of history</p>
<p>so you can really delve into it,</p>
<p>turn over every stone,</p>
<p>examine it to the nth degree,</p>
<p>there are advantages to doing the opposite.</p>
<p>You get a much larger sense of how cultures</p>
<p>are working together and pinging off each other,</p>
<p>larger sense of trends impacting over time, right?</p>
<p>They all have their place.</p>
<p>And Jones&rsquo; book is one of those that,</p>
<p>um, if you actually retained what&rsquo;s in it,</p>
<p>it would fill in your foundational knowledge base</p>
<p>for a huge chunk of time</p>
<p>and a large, important region, geographically speaking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a page-turner.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of historical figures</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve all fallen in love with</p>
<p>that fall into a book like this.</p>
<p>What I love about it, though, is at the same time</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s comforting, if you&rsquo;ve always been interested</p>
<p>in this stuff to read this book, it&rsquo;s comforting for me anyway.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got all the new stuff, right?</p>
<p>All the new discoveries, all the clarifications,</p>
<p>all the overturned myths.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked before about how interesting it is now</p>
<p>that the area of historical knowledge</p>
<p>is aided not just by historians and archaeologists,</p>
<p>the people that have always sort of had that as their purview,</p>
<p>but tons of other scientific disciplines</p>
<p>that working with these people</p>
<p>are making the kinds of discoveries and datings possible</p>
<p>that we never could have imagined.</p>
<p>I mean, just the other day, there was a story,</p>
<p>and you may have seen it, confirming,</p>
<p>certainly, what many of us had already known,</p>
<p>that the Vikings had arrived in the Americas,</p>
<p>but coming up with a pretty solid date for it.</p>
<p>And they said, 1021, you know, 1021 ADCE.</p>
<p>And when you read the story of how they came up</p>
<p>with the date, the radiologists that are involved,</p>
<p>the climatologists that are involved,</p>
<p>I mean, it is so many experts from so many varied fields</p>
<p>working together to get us this information.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a part of what makes the modern historical study</p>
<p>so interesting to people, you know,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been reading the books forever,</p>
<p>but all of a sudden, you have new stuff on old stories, right?</p>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t love that?</p>
<p>And Powers and Thrones has a bunch of those,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re going, oh, really?</p>
<p>So this major invasion happened because of a climate change</p>
<p>that they can now prove was going on.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So I loved it. I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy it, too.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a Dan Jones fan, I don&rsquo;t have to tell you</p>
<p>what he writes are sort of page turners</p>
<p>in terms of being able to pick out really interesting things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fabulous, and so is he, and he&rsquo;s on the show today.</p>
<p>And so, without further ado, and I hope you like this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just sort of fanboying out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more for me than for you.</p>
<p>But, you know, you guys pay the bills around here,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll let you listen in.</p>
<p>Dan Jones, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>The first thing I want to say is that this book,</p>
<p>you know, I think I tried to describe it once</p>
<p>as comfort food for a history fan like yours, truly,</p>
<p>because I grew up reading stuff like this.</p>
<p>But what I love about your book is it incorporates</p>
<p>all these favorite topics of mine</p>
<p>with all the latest stuff, right?</p>
<p>The latest evidence and theories.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember, for example, when you got to the part</p>
<p>about the famous arrival of the Huns into the Roman world,</p>
<p>and you threw the climate element in there,</p>
<p>and talked about, is it called a Killian juniper plant</p>
<p>or whatever that they used for climate dating?</p>
<p>I was absolutely enthralled.</p>
<p>So, start off, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that think that history is sort of a set thing,</p>
<p>and because once you know what happens, nothing changes.</p>
<p>But talk to me about, you know, like I said,</p>
<p>a guy, yours truly, I was reading this stuff</p>
<p>at 14 years old, 13, 12, and there&rsquo;s so much new stuff</p>
<p>in a story that I thought I knew.</p>
<p>Um, that&rsquo;s pretty normal, though, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re always updating stuff, aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>Well, firstly, I mean, thank you for those kind comments.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad it did, like, the book reminded you</p>
<p>of those classic histories that you like to read,</p>
<p>because I like to read those histories, too.</p>
<p>And I wanted to create a book that had that feel</p>
<p>like you want to turn the pages, like I could give this</p>
<p>to an intelligent 13-year-old and get them, like,</p>
<p>buzzed on medieval history.</p>
<p>Um, but if we&rsquo;re talking about&hellip;</p>
<p>I suppose we&rsquo;re going pretty deep here early on,</p>
<p>like, what is history? And history&rsquo;s a dialogue,</p>
<p>I think, between the past and present.</p>
<p>Although, in a book like I&rsquo;ve just written,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s narrative, it&rsquo;s chronological,</p>
<p>it starts at the beginning of the Middle Ages</p>
<p>and follows the story through to the end.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always new research going on</p>
<p>in lots of different areas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always, and even more than that,</p>
<p>every generation has its own preoccupations,</p>
<p>which it seeks to somehow see reflected</p>
<p>or see the foundations of them in the past.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s why we can write new histories of,</p>
<p>be it the Tudor dynasty, the Plantagenet dynasty,</p>
<p>the Second World War, the, you know,</p>
<p>the Mongol conquest, or whatever, each generation.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s always new research to draw on,</p>
<p>but even more than that, there&rsquo;s new&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s new societal preoccupations to reflect.</p>
<p>You know what? So, one of those classic books</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve referenced, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I mean, tell me if you enjoyed this book as well</p>
<p>when you were growing up, was Barbara Tuchman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>-&ldquo;A Distant Mirror.&rdquo; Right? -&ldquo;Oh, sure, sure.</p>
<p>Have it up in the bookshelf. Yeah, I can see it from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a great book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a book that takes the calamitous 14th century,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s written in, I think, 1974,</p>
<p>and uses the 14th century as, as the title suggests,</p>
<p>a distant mirror on the 20th,</p>
<p>another time of war and instability in Europe</p>
<p>and plague and social turmoil.</p>
<p>And when I started writing Powers and Thrones,</p>
<p>I set out to write this history of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>I thought, how do we do that for the 21st century?</p>
<p>How do we look at the Middle Ages</p>
<p>with a sense of what matters to us today,</p>
<p>and thereby create a form of empathy</p>
<p>in the mind of the reader?</p>
<p>And so, when I tackled the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>I was looking for things that&hellip;</p>
<p>I actually had a list of things I thought</p>
<p>were going to be important, were already important,</p>
<p>were going to become more important</p>
<p>as the first half of the 21st century went on.</p>
<p>And that list was climate change, mass migration,</p>
<p>pandemic disease, technological change,</p>
<p>and global networks.</p>
<p>So, as I was putting together this new history</p>
<p>of the Middle Ages, I didn&rsquo;t seek to just</p>
<p>only look at those things, but I thought,</p>
<p>if we can lift those out of the research,</p>
<p>lift those out of the storytelling,</p>
<p>then this will make the Middle Ages</p>
<p>somehow seem approachable to this, you know,</p>
<p>be it an intelligent 13-year-old reading history</p>
<p>for the first time, or, you know,</p>
<p>someone of our kind of generation</p>
<p>reading history for the 15th time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big philosophy of what I&rsquo;ve been doing, anyway.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a line I like from an Ohio State</p>
<p>University historian named Robert C. Davis,</p>
<p>who says, history is, often is not,</p>
<p>our present politics projected onto the past.</p>
<p>And that makes it sound artificial,</p>
<p>but the way I look at it is like,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m reading your book and you&rsquo;re referencing</p>
<p>climate change, tipping off certain</p>
<p>major historical events, I recall that when I was younger,</p>
<p>they still talked about climate change doing this,</p>
<p>but because we understand and are living through</p>
<p>more climate change than we were when I was younger,</p>
<p>I think we get it better, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Look, you had talked about, like, globalized networks.</p>
<p>Well, you know, you understood that in 1982 also,</p>
<p>but boy, you understand it so much better now</p>
<p>when we live in it and it&rsquo;s so in your face.</p>
<p>So, I think that&rsquo;s just reflective of a better</p>
<p>understanding that we have of how those things go now</p>
<p>in our world, and then it&rsquo;s easier to imagine</p>
<p>how they might have impacted an earlier world.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that history, as you know well,</p>
<p>goes through, like, trends in terms of it&rsquo;s kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>-&hellip;scholarly concept. -&hellip;Fashion, yes.</p>
<p>And some fashions, right? And sometimes that&hellip;</p>
<p>Every so often, someone will come along and say,</p>
<p>you know what, history should be objective.</p>
<p>It should be about truth-seeking and truth alone</p>
<p>and the facts. Let&rsquo;s stick to the facts.</p>
<p>And that will be fashionable for a little while,</p>
<p>and then some bright spark will go, you know what?</p>
<p>That there is&hellip; You don&rsquo;t have to be a kind of</p>
<p>French relativist philosopher to realize</p>
<p>there is no objective truth. There&rsquo;s perspectives.</p>
<p>You know, relativity defines how we think about the world.</p>
<p>And so, as a historian, as I&rsquo;ve gotten older</p>
<p>and a bit more confident, I suppose,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve stopped trying to shy away from this feeling</p>
<p>that we&hellip; I&rsquo;ve tried to avoid this feeling</p>
<p>that we shouldn&rsquo;t project our own concerns</p>
<p>into the art study of the past.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, what&rsquo;s history for?</p>
<p>History&rsquo;s, like, about creating a context for the now.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s not just inevitable, it&rsquo;s natural,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s probably advisable that we take with us,</p>
<p>or as long as we acknowledge that we take with us</p>
<p>our preconceptions, our prejudices,</p>
<p>our concerns, our angst, our worries,</p>
<p>when we go looking at the past, right?</p>
<p>Otherwise, why are we bothering?</p>
<p>What are we gonna learn from it?</p>
<p>You know, if it&rsquo;s not there to give us context</p>
<p>in the now.</p>
<p>Well, and I think sometimes, if you&rsquo;re not looking</p>
<p>for something, you don&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you don&rsquo;t know you should be looking for it.</p>
<p>And I think certain things, like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just reference the climate again,</p>
<p>because to me, that was such an obvious&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I remember as a kid hearing about the collapse</p>
<p>of the Bronze Age, and climate was one of the things</p>
<p>that they threw out there.</p>
<p>Drought, starvation, all those things.</p>
<p>But I think when you look at our situation,</p>
<p>say, well, what&rsquo;s our situation gonna be like climate-wise</p>
<p>in 100 years, 200 years?</p>
<p>It helps sort of inform the listener to go back and go,</p>
<p>well, gee, how bad can it get?</p>
<p>And when was it bad? And how did they deal with it?</p>
<p>And how does an ancient society deal with some</p>
<p>of the problems we&rsquo;re looking at?</p>
<p>So, I mean, I find it, um, not&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, it&rsquo;s not just informative and useful</p>
<p>as a comparative tool to me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of something that&rsquo;s comforting.</p>
<p>I mean, um, you know, if you&rsquo;ve been through something before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little less scary, um, even if you&rsquo;ve never been</p>
<p>through it quite this way.</p>
<p>So, let me talk, because you have to frame something</p>
<p>like this, right? If you&rsquo;re gonna start a story</p>
<p>in the middle, as you do, right?</p>
<p>The Middle Ages start in the middle.</p>
<p>You have to have sort of a touchstone, right?</p>
<p>And the touchstone is the obvious one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Rome, right?</p>
<p>So, you have a civilization that starts as a city-state</p>
<p>around the time, you know, the Persians are invading Greece,</p>
<p>right? So, the 500s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really&hellip; And then it goes through the Republican period,</p>
<p>and then it goes through the Imperial period.</p>
<p>And by the time the Middle Ages start,</p>
<p>you have this ancient&hellip;</p>
<p>And I mean, I try to think about our modern world now,</p>
<p>which hasn&rsquo;t existed.</p>
<p>If you say the modern world starts in the Renaissance,</p>
<p>or, I mean, we haven&rsquo;t existed now,</p>
<p>as long as Rome was around as a civilization</p>
<p>that could trace its roots back to something real.</p>
<p>Um, explain a little bit on how this&hellip;</p>
<p>On what happens to a world when a touchstone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that concrete goes away?</p>
<p>I&hellip; Yeah, right. I&hellip; So&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re completely and utterly and 100% correct.</p>
<p>You know, the framing of the Middle Ages has to be Rome.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s&hellip; That&rsquo;s how&hellip;</p>
<p>When the Middle Ages first was conceived in the 16th century,</p>
<p>it was conceived as, by definition,</p>
<p>the bit between the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West,</p>
<p>and the Reformation, and the sort of the&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a Protestant idea,</p>
<p>but the scales falling away from the eyes</p>
<p>of the great enlightened, uh, new Christians</p>
<p>of the 16th century.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also absolutely right to say&hellip;</p>
<p>To point to this longevity of Rome,</p>
<p>as compared to the longevity of our, quote-unquote,</p>
<p>modern world, if we go back to the 16th century</p>
<p>to date the origins of that.</p>
<p>What happens when an empire like that falls to bits?</p>
<p>What happens when a Roman empire like that falls to bits?</p>
<p>I think&hellip; Is&hellip;</p>
<p>In one sense, the answer is not very much.</p>
<p>Because it happens relatively slowly.</p>
<p>Now, even though in the collapse of the Western Roman Empire,</p>
<p>there are cataclysmic events,</p>
<p>the sack of Rome by Alaric and the Goths in 410 A.D.</p>
<p>being the most obvious of them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like the Western Roman Empire</p>
<p>just falls to bits in one day.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s a not very encouraging dystopian read</p>
<p>on the 21st century, okay?</p>
<p>If we were to hypothesize,</p>
<p>and I personally hope this doesn&rsquo;t come to pass,</p>
<p>but if we were to hypothesize that we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>the end of the American&hellip;</p>
<p>The end of the United States as a superpower, right?</p>
<p>And with some future historians writing</p>
<p>from the 22nd century,</p>
<p>we might look back on, say, 9-11</p>
<p>as a spectacular assault on the heart of America</p>
<p>that wrought great chaos and tragic death</p>
<p>and was horrifying and shocking around the world.</p>
<p>But what we wouldn&rsquo;t say was&hellip;</p>
<p>And at that moment, America ceased to be a superpower.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d say, that was some crazy&hellip;</p>
<p>There were crazy repercussions to that one event.</p>
<p>But to everybody who lived in the 20 years subsequently,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t really look like America collapsed.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s hope that&rsquo;s a dystopian</p>
<p>sort of conjecture on my part,</p>
<p>but I think you see what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>So I think if we project that idea</p>
<p>back to the collapse of Rome,</p>
<p>there were big moments such as,</p>
<p>well, Rome&rsquo;s being sacked by Allochian and the Goths,</p>
<p>or, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m talking to you from the UK,</p>
<p>Britannia being sort of jettisoned,</p>
<p>like booted off into space from the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>These, in retrospect, look like huge moments.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I think if you were living through it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d just have been a time of rising instability</p>
<p>in different places and at different times,</p>
<p>which, over the course of several generations,</p>
<p>added up to the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>But, you know, even if we think about the distance in time</p>
<p>between 410 AD, sack of Rome, and 476,</p>
<p>you know, the last recognized Western Roman Empire,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 66 years.</p>
<p>Like, in terms of human lifespans of any age,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quite a long time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a, what am I looking,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the analogy I&rsquo;m looking for?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a boiling of the frog, I suppose.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>Crazy and abstract?</p>
<p>No, it makes sense.</p>
<p>I always describe it as, you know,</p>
<p>being cut off from the equivalent</p>
<p>of the global information superhighway,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re Britain, when Rome says you&rsquo;re on your own</p>
<p>and whatnot, but as many historians have pointed out,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re actually living in Italy at this time period,</p>
<p>closer to where the center of Roman activity was,</p>
<p>things continue differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the hinterlands that feel it first and most strongly</p>
<p>and recover the slowest.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk a little about the recovery,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s one of those periods</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think enough people, yours truly included,</p>
<p>know enough about, and that&rsquo;s the Carolingian,</p>
<p>the attempts to recreate something of Rome&rsquo;s grandeur</p>
<p>from the ashes a couple centuries later.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re connected to these people that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny, because the terminology will kill you</p>
<p>when you start using terms like Franks</p>
<p>to talk about a tribe that the Romans had dealt with,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still using Franks to describe Crusaders</p>
<p>in the 1100s.</p>
<p>Who, maybe talk about this, because it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>when you talk about the Roman ashes,</p>
<p>the entities that begin to arise from the ashes,</p>
<p>as you said, that you look at and say,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know then that they&rsquo;re gonna play a huge role,</p>
<p>but we, looking back on it now, realize these Franks</p>
<p>are gonna be an important entity.</p>
<p>Whatever those Franks are, who are the Franks?</p>
<p>Well, the Franks are one of, I mean, originally,</p>
<p>one of many tribes who move into the territories</p>
<p>that were ruled by the Western Roman Empire</p>
<p>and ceased to be ruled by the Western Roman Empire</p>
<p>as these barbarian tribes move in.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I mean, look, if we&rsquo;re placing bets in, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>the sixth or even the seventh century AD</p>
<p>as to who&rsquo;s gonna be around in a thousand years,</p>
<p>is it the Franks?</p>
<p>Is it the Burgundians?</p>
<p>Is it the Lombards?</p>
<p>Is it the Visigoths, the Ostrogoths,</p>
<p>the Vandals, the Swabians?</p>
<p>All of these different tribal groups moving around</p>
<p>what had been the Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And at different times,</p>
<p>a lot different of them were ascended.</p>
<p>But by the eighth, ninth century,</p>
<p>the Franks, who traced in their own mythology,</p>
<p>they said they&rsquo;d come a-wandering</p>
<p>from the Trojan Wars originally,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;d come a-wandering from Eastern Europe, probably.</p>
<p>Germany, Central and Eastern Europe,</p>
<p>across the Rhine into the, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>the area that we now call France.</p>
<p>And had over several generations coalesced into a kingdom.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a kingdom.</p>
<p>It was ruled by kings.</p>
<p>First, the Merovingians, the long-haired kings,</p>
<p>in which the king was connoted by his,</p>
<p>literally, by growing his hair very long</p>
<p>and could be deposed by having his hair cut off.</p>
<p>And by and by, the Merovingian dynasty</p>
<p>became less politically influential.</p>
<p>The Frankish territories were governed on their behalf</p>
<p>by mayors of the palace, by politicians.</p>
<p>And then they were done away with by a dynasty</p>
<p>who we now call the Carolingians,</p>
<p>named after Charles Martel,</p>
<p>but most famous for producing Charlemagne,</p>
<p>the king of the Franks who had himself crowned</p>
<p>in the year 800 as the first Roman emperor</p>
<p>of the reborn Western Roman Empire,</p>
<p>which came to be the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p>So we have a barbarian tribe which, over many generations,</p>
<p>becomes, collectively, a kingdom.</p>
<p>And then they become, for a time,</p>
<p>under Charlemagne and his descendants,</p>
<p>the preeminent force in Western Europe.</p>
<p>The way they sort of absconded</p>
<p>with the Roman reputation, title, and all that</p>
<p>reminds me of one of those companies</p>
<p>that has a great old lineage.</p>
<p>Like, in the United States, it might be AT&amp;T or something.</p>
<p>And then AT&amp;T goes out of business,</p>
<p>but somebody buys the name.</p>
<p>And then they get to be the new AT&amp;T,</p>
<p>and they get to inherit all that cachet,</p>
<p>even though they had nothing to do with the original entity.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, or maybe those in Germany</p>
<p>right now, the name for France and Germany</p>
<p>is still Frankreich, the Empire of the Franks.</p>
<p>I also like it, and I never made this connection</p>
<p>when I was reading the Crusades from the Middle Eastern</p>
<p>viewpoint, I forget what the book was called.</p>
<p>And they referred to the Crusaders from Europe</p>
<p>as the Frange.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, that&rsquo;s, yeah, it just turns</p>
<p>Frank into French right there.</p>
<p>And then you begin to see the connections,</p>
<p>because Frank doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to most people who</p>
<p>speak the English language, but French obviously does.</p>
<p>And when you see one word morph into the other,</p>
<p>the light bulb goes on in your head, and you go, oh, OK,</p>
<p>I see the connection.</p>
<p>So this is interesting, though, also,</p>
<p>because we did a show a long time ago</p>
<p>on that transition period, from Merovingians to Carolingians.</p>
<p>And when you read the accounts of what</p>
<p>these Merovingian Franks were like, they sound like Vikings.</p>
<p>When you look at pictures, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>contemporary type stuff, but they&rsquo;re sort of idea,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re idealized</p>
<p>or if we&rsquo;ve barbarized the Merovingians in their true cut,</p>
<p>but they all look so civilized and so King Arthur-like.</p>
<p>And they look clean and washed and well-dressed,</p>
<p>and they look like they&rsquo;re very, very civilized.</p>
<p>And then when you read the accounts of people like some</p>
<p>of these, some of the one, Charles Martel</p>
<p>is a perfect example, but some of the Merovingian kings,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the one who would have people bend over to bow for him</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;d split their skull with a battle axe?</p>
<p>I mean, they had all these wonderful.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, I guess what I&rsquo;m saying in my typically</p>
<p>long-winded question, I am getting to somewhere,</p>
<p>is that looking back on it with your eye, which</p>
<p>of those two impressions of the Merovingians,</p>
<p>the Franks before Charlemagne and Pepin, his father,</p>
<p>which of those two interpretations</p>
<p>seems more like to you?</p>
<p>Have we barbarized a bunch of people</p>
<p>that were more civilized than we thought?</p>
<p>Or have the chroniclers made a bunch of Viking types</p>
<p>look better than they actually were?</p>
<p>I think so much is what you want them to be.</p>
<p>And I think particularly in the early Middle Ages,</p>
<p>late antiquity, early Middle Ages,</p>
<p>the evidence is so scant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a late medievalist by inclination, by training.</p>
<p>So when I came to writing this new book,</p>
<p>a lot of the early Middle Ages was kind</p>
<p>of virgin territory for me.</p>
<p>And that was one of the reasons I enjoyed doing it.</p>
<p>Of course, as it always, you can be swayed very easily</p>
<p>at first by the account that you&rsquo;re reading.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if you&rsquo;re reading</p>
<p>accounts of Romans watching the barbarians swarm over</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s solid Roman territories, they are barbarians.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the sort of hideously uncivilized folk</p>
<p>who have no right being where they are.</p>
<p>But of course, as time goes by, and those hideously</p>
<p>uncivilized folk who have no right being where they are</p>
<p>become the ruling power, the chronicles</p>
<p>become somewhat more, somewhat kinder to them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for grave goods, Dan.</p>
<p>And so if you take someone like Childrik I,</p>
<p>probably the first Merovingian king</p>
<p>we know very much about at all.</p>
<p>You start finding all those bees in the grave goods,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>You find the gold bees.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re talking about a guy who</p>
<p>died at the end of the fifth century, probably in 481.</p>
<p>And yeah, in the scene, ornamental gold bees,</p>
<p>signet rings, spears, axes.</p>
<p>Lots of garnet.</p>
<p>Garnet everywhere, I love it.</p>
<p>Oh, garnet everywhere.</p>
<p>You know you&rsquo;ve made it when you&rsquo;ve got a bit of garnet</p>
<p>on you, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>So obviously, here is a society that</p>
<p>has a luxurious material culture accessible, at least,</p>
<p>to the people at the very, very top of it.</p>
<p>Here, probably, is also a society</p>
<p>that, like most societies in human history,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really offer very much for the ordinary Joe</p>
<p>at the bottom of it, just sort of subsisting as best he,</p>
<p>she, and family can do.</p>
<p>So I think, yeah, look, it&rsquo;s totally a question of who</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at and from what perspective.</p>
<p>Certainly, I think, as here&rsquo;s the thing about the Middle</p>
<p>Ages in general, to blow back into a big point,</p>
<p>as the Middle Ages wear on, the evidence becomes fuller</p>
<p>and the people start to seem a little bit more like us,</p>
<p>you know, recognizable to a modern eye</p>
<p>and somewhat more sympathetic.</p>
<p>So for example, it&rsquo;s much easier for us</p>
<p>to sympathize and empathize and feel</p>
<p>some kind of fraternity with Leonardo da Vinci</p>
<p>at the end of the Middle Ages, you know, the universal genius,</p>
<p>the man designing machines and dissecting bodies</p>
<p>and painting great paintings, than it is for us</p>
<p>even to put ourselves into the mind of Childrik I</p>
<p>with his lovely bees and garnets.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it just is easier because the time brings</p>
<p>us closer to those people.</p>
<p>So inevitably, I think when we look back very, very deep</p>
<p>into the early Middle Ages, we can be somewhat appalled</p>
<p>by the barbarity of the time.</p>
<p>You know, you make me think of something that I&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>been fascinated with and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be very interested maybe, maybe</p>
<p>this is a future book I need to work on or something,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m fascinated.</p>
<p>So like when we look back at Leonardo da Vinci,</p>
<p>like you just said, we understand</p>
<p>that there has been tremendous amount of change</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re comfortable with the idea</p>
<p>that Leonardo would have dressed differently,</p>
<p>looked differently, lived in a different sort of milieu</p>
<p>than what we do and that&rsquo;s understandable.</p>
<p>But when you look at, for example, a portrayal,</p>
<p>so you had mentioned the later Middle Ages</p>
<p>or the solid Middle Ages, let&rsquo;s just say the 14th century,</p>
<p>right, 1300s.</p>
<p>Somebody, you&rsquo;ll see manuscripts with them</p>
<p>portraying a much earlier historical event.</p>
<p>So maybe something from Rome or maybe something</p>
<p>from the Carolingians or what have you,</p>
<p>but they portray it in contemporary terms, right?</p>
<p>So the people will be wearing the same sort of armor</p>
<p>that they would be wearing in the 14th century</p>
<p>rather than armor that would have been, you know,</p>
<p>something more, in other words, we acknowledge</p>
<p>that the things in Leonardo&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>are not going to be like our own.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t necessarily do that in the artwork.</p>
<p>Did people, and this may not be a question</p>
<p>that Dan Jones is the right person to ask,</p>
<p>but do people back then, when they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about the kings of yore or whatever,</p>
<p>do they understand that they&rsquo;re going to be living</p>
<p>in a different sort of technological sort of situation</p>
<p>or is the assumption back then</p>
<p>that everything is as everything was?</p>
<p>Well, this is a really good example</p>
<p>because we do the same thing today.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take these, let&rsquo;s drill down</p>
<p>into the example you gave.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine a sort of 14th century French chronicle</p>
<p>depicting the Song of Rolands,</p>
<p>probably the most famous story told in the later Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Right, in Spain or southern France, right, right, right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, yeah, he&rsquo;s on his way back from northern Spain</p>
<p>fighting the Saracens in northern Spain</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s ambushed in Rocheval and blows the horn</p>
<p>to warn Charlemagne, you know, the great king of the Franks,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s trouble afoot.</p>
<p>And in blowing the horn, his temples burst</p>
<p>and he dies a hero&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Okay, the big story told in the 14th century</p>
<p>telling a heavily romanticized version</p>
<p>of a story set in the late 8th century.</p>
<p>So what is that?</p>
<p>Well, 14 minus eight, my maths isn&rsquo;t very good.</p>
<p>600 years previous.</p>
<p>I just watched, okay, and in that 14th century telling,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right, the drawings will have been 14th century armor</p>
<p>and the mores of all the characters</p>
<p>will essentially be 14th century.</p>
<p>These will be 14th century people</p>
<p>gadding about 600 years earlier.</p>
<p>Now, I just watched Ridley Scott&rsquo;s The Last Duel</p>
<p>about a 14th century duel between two dudes</p>
<p>over whether Adam Driver,</p>
<p>the Adam Driver character, Jacques Legree,</p>
<p>had raped the wife of Matt Damon,</p>
<p>Jean de Carouges.</p>
<p>And of course, in the hands of the writers,</p>
<p>Damon and Affleck and the director, Ridley Scott,</p>
<p>this has become a movie that is really about</p>
<p>Hollywood politics and American gender politics</p>
<p>in the 21st century.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just put into,</p>
<p>it just happens to be taking place in the 14th century.</p>
<p>Now the costume in that movie is the 14th century.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not all wandering about in skinny jeans</p>
<p>with iPhones.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll grant you that, we don&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p>But what is obvious throughout that entire movie</p>
<p>is that this is one big analogy for the modern world.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re doing exactly the same thing in the 21st century</p>
<p>as was being done in the 14th century.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re aware that we&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>Now, the big question is,</p>
<p>to what extent in the 14th century</p>
<p>are they aware that this is a sort of fabricated vision</p>
<p>of life or that maybe it wasn&rsquo;t quite like this</p>
<p>under Charlemagne?</p>
<p>This is only really speculation,</p>
<p>but I think that we must credit our historical forebears</p>
<p>with some intelligence and self-awareness.</p>
<p>I think we often write self-awareness,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t credit self-awareness</p>
<p>in historical figures enough.</p>
<p>I think people realize that this is not maybe quite how it was,</p>
<p>but this is also the best way to make this story</p>
<p>recognizable to a modern audience.</p>
<p>And so the attitudes between then and now,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think are that radically different,</p>
<p>just the technologies are.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a great answer.</p>
<p>And I think I should have made a distinction</p>
<p>between the highly educated members of society</p>
<p>and those who&rsquo;d never had any education at all</p>
<p>and that you were just pointing out</p>
<p>may not even know about these events.</p>
<p>So you have to make them relatable.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about, because when I was a kid</p>
<p>and I was so interested in European history,</p>
<p>you tend to forget all of the outward pressures</p>
<p>of the other civilizations that are impacting that history.</p>
<p>And you mentioned the Saracens</p>
<p>and the Song of Roland situation.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about that for a minute.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting and little known, I would think,</p>
<p>and something that we should study more here in the West</p>
<p>is the great original Muslim conquests of the Arab</p>
<p>and Byzantine and the other worlds.</p>
<p>Can we talk a little bit about this?</p>
<p>And can you, because I was trying to figure out</p>
<p>if there was anything I could think of,</p>
<p>historically speaking, from any era,</p>
<p>that was an analogy that made sense to that.</p>
<p>That to me seems a singular,</p>
<p>when you start looking at all the different angles,</p>
<p>a sort of a singular event.</p>
<p>Talk to me a little bit about the original Arab-Muslim conquest.</p>
<p>You know, when Islam first appeared on the stage</p>
<p>and rolled over several traditional superpowers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most extraordinary episodes</p>
<p>in the whole of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>I mean, arguably, in the whole of the last two thousand years.</p>
<p>I would say anything, anytime. Yeah, anytime.</p>
<p>I think maybe, so, the speed of conquest,</p>
<p>and this is something you&rsquo;ve obviously worked a lot on,</p>
<p>is comparable with Genghis Khan&rsquo;s conquests.</p>
<p>You know, that scale, that speed,</p>
<p>that rapidity of a sort of a new movement.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s different between the early Islamic conquests,</p>
<p>you know, out of Arabia, through half of Byzantium,</p>
<p>through the whole of North Africa, into Sicily,</p>
<p>into Spain, all the way up to the Pyrenees,</p>
<p>you know, in no time at all.</p>
<p>The edges of China. Think about, I mean, you know.</p>
<p>The edges of China. Right.</p>
<p>And leaving an imprint in all of those places,</p>
<p>from Transoxania to the Iberian Peninsula, you know.</p>
<p>Half the known world, that is in almost everywhere</p>
<p>that the first Arab caliphs, after Muhammad,</p>
<p>the rightly guided Rashidun caliphs,</p>
<p>Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali,</p>
<p>through to the, well, all the way to, say, 750.</p>
<p>The splitting point between the Umayyad caliphate</p>
<p>and the Abbasid.</p>
<p>Almost everywhere that was conquered by the Arabs,</p>
<p>by the Muslim Arabs in those first generations</p>
<p>of Islamic expansion remains Islamic today.</p>
<p>That imprint has lasted as long as all of the imprints</p>
<p>the Middle Ages have left in terms of, you know,</p>
<p>in the Western Christian world.</p>
<p>The rule of law, the cathedrals, the castles</p>
<p>that are all over, you know, Western Europe,</p>
<p>and England, Wales in particular.</p>
<p>The music, the art, the elements of the political thought.</p>
<p>Just as much in the Arabic and Persian worlds,</p>
<p>the first Islamic conquerors have left their mark.</p>
<p>However, there is a schism that exists in scholarship</p>
<p>between Christian, Western, Anglophone,</p>
<p>as well as French and German scholarship</p>
<p>and Islamic scholarship.</p>
<p>And there are very few writers.</p>
<p>You mentioned earlier on a book about the Crusades</p>
<p>from the Islamic perspective.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to place a small bet</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re thinking about Paul Cobb.</p>
<p>His book, The Crusades Through Arab Eyes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that book.</p>
<p>Fantastic book, but a very, very rare book.</p>
<p>Almost nobody on either side is doing that.</p>
<p>And so we still have this enormous historical schism.</p>
<p>When I wrote the chapter in Powers and Thrones</p>
<p>entitled Arabs, which narrates the story from Mohammed&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>all the way up to 750 and the end of the expansion,</p>
<p>I went into a totally new scholarship.</p>
<p>And I had to talk to completely new scholars.</p>
<p>I called up my friend Samir Rahim, who&rsquo;s a brilliant,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known for more than half my life, brilliant journalist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also a fantastic scholar of early Islam.</p>
<p>And I said, Samir, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to need a reading list here.</p>
<p>And he sent me a long reading list,</p>
<p>which I dug straight into.</p>
<p>But there was no crossover with anything else</p>
<p>that I was reading.</p>
<p>This was a scholarship that sat on its own,</p>
<p>away from the rest of what I was reading</p>
<p>for this history of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t tend to think about the early Islamic</p>
<p>caliphates as being part of, quote unquote, medieval history.</p>
<p>And yet they were.</p>
<p>Chris Wickham, brilliant scholar of the early Middle Ages,</p>
<p>wrote an amazing book called The Inheritance of Rome.</p>
<p>And it asked the question, after the fall of the Western Roman</p>
<p>Empire, what comes into that space?</p>
<p>And Wickham looks at the barbarian kingdoms.</p>
<p>He looks at Byzantium, and Easter, and Constantinople.</p>
<p>He looks at the Franks.</p>
<p>And he looks at, so he&rsquo;s one of the few scholars who</p>
<p>looks at the Islamic caliphates.</p>
<p>Now, when I think about the big question,</p>
<p>who has the best claim out of those groups</p>
<p>to really call themselves the heirs of Rome,</p>
<p>I would argue it&rsquo;s probably the early Islamic caliphs.</p>
<p>Because they put together the biggest empire on Rome&rsquo;s patch,</p>
<p>bonded by a single language, Arabic,</p>
<p>whereas Rome had Latin, bonded by something approaching</p>
<p>a common bureaucratic imperial culture that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all the way from Transoxania to Spain.</p>
<p>There is this sort of common feeling.</p>
<p>Bonded by a coinage, bonded by a faith above everything.</p>
<p>Capable, militarily fearsome, all of these.</p>
<p>Arguably, it&rsquo;s the Arabs who are the real heirs of Rome.</p>
<p>But I can almost feel people bristling</p>
<p>as they hear that, because we just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t connect these two things as being part</p>
<p>of the same historical story.</p>
<p>Well, and maybe forget that.</p>
<p>I mean, again, if we&rsquo;re looking at this</p>
<p>from a geopolitical standpoint, and you put a map down</p>
<p>from this era, you&rsquo;re going to see.</p>
<p>I mean, this is how American military planners</p>
<p>would look at it, right?</p>
<p>They would say, well, look, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>surrounded over here in Spain, which is Moorish.</p>
<p>North Africa&rsquo;s all Islamic.</p>
<p>The Middle East is Islamic.</p>
<p>The Byzantines are under siege.</p>
<p>And in the north, you have non-Christian people.</p>
<p>And this would have been where Christianity was considered</p>
<p>almost a power bloc, the way we saw communism</p>
<p>and the free world as power blocs.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not your power bloc in the north.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your power bloc in Spain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your power bloc in North Africa.</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;re looking at this</p>
<p>from a European point of view, you also have,</p>
<p>and I love these cultures, you also</p>
<p>have what you could call sort of the, what would you refer to?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d call it the Berlin Wall of Europe.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s what happens once you get to the plains of Hungary</p>
<p>and the more flat territory that becomes the Great Steppe.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve always had, I mean, Herodotus</p>
<p>is talking about Cimmerians and Scythians.</p>
<p>And the Romans would use those same terms</p>
<p>for much later peoples.</p>
<p>But you have, you know, we mentioned the Huns earlier.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got an area there that just not only keeps</p>
<p>the Europeans from expanding in that direction,</p>
<p>but is continually pressuring towards the European direction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one people&rsquo;s after another, after another,</p>
<p>you know, from Magyars and Huns and Avars and Seljuks.</p>
<p>And talk to me a little bit about this great wall</p>
<p>on the eastern side of European culture</p>
<p>that is the Steppe people, who also, of course,</p>
<p>you know, the other side of them is</p>
<p>watching Chinese civilization.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re acting as a conduit between the two worlds that</p>
<p>are not only not connected, but in a lot of cases</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know of each other&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>Right, and maybe the analogy is the way</p>
<p>we sometimes talk about bodies of water being either roads</p>
<p>or walls, right, you know, on a tiny scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the English Channel is either a barrier</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a bridge.</p>
<p>And the same is probably true of the Great Steppe that</p>
<p>conjoins Eastern Europe with northern China.</p>
<p>Now, I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>For the most part, that sort of keeps these big power</p>
<p>blocks, these different peoples apart.</p>
<p>However, when you come to a suddenly the Mongols appear</p>
<p>end of the 12th century, it becomes like a super highway.</p>
<p>And for the right military superpower,</p>
<p>as the Mongols turn out to be, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a road, that&rsquo;s a super highway for them to charge along.</p>
<p>I think if we&rsquo;re thinking about those big blocks that</p>
<p>emerge in the Middle Ages, and to connect this a little bit</p>
<p>with the role of Islam and the Arab-speaking and Persian</p>
<p>world, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>After the 8th century, roughly, those blocks</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really move very much.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only in, well, there&rsquo;s an expansion</p>
<p>of the Western Christian world.</p>
<p>In Spain and Portugal, something interesting happens.</p>
<p>The Reconquista is very, very unusual.</p>
<p>Unlike the Crusades to Egypt, unlike the Crusades</p>
<p>to the Middle East, you know, to the Near East,</p>
<p>Eastern Mediterranean, there&rsquo;s a permanent change</p>
<p>in the sort of faith groups which govern that territory.</p>
<p>We can look at Northern Europe, the Baltic, Scandinavia,</p>
<p>that too, there&rsquo;s a Christianizing process there,</p>
<p>a Christianizing process in Poland and Hungary and so on.</p>
<p>But it does, that remains the block.</p>
<p>Europe doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s not like the Crusaders go along</p>
<p>that step, you know, marauding their way all the way</p>
<p>to modern Beijing, is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, for the most part, I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think that that great steppeland is a barrier.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not, it doesn&rsquo;t become a conduit west to east.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only ever really east to west.</p>
<p>One of the really interesting periods of history,</p>
<p>I think, is the one where, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s analogous, I think, to the American so-called conquest</p>
<p>of the Old West, when the Russians begin to push,</p>
<p>you know, 16th century, 17th century,</p>
<p>they begin to push east going after the various steppe</p>
<p>tribes in that direction.</p>
<p>And the Chinese simultaneously are</p>
<p>pushing west.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only with the change in technology or whatever</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re able to master this weapon system that</p>
<p>had dominated that area and kept those powers out</p>
<p>for millennia.</p>
<p>Let me shift a little bit, because I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got another interesting people, and I really</p>
<p>want your take on it, because I&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>known how to classify them or put them</p>
<p>into the proper sort of place.</p>
<p>How do we classify Normans?</p>
<p>I mean, to me, this is one of the great, great, I mean,</p>
<p>for those who don&rsquo;t know, we have this group of people,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll let Dan explain the background or the fusion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always been, you know, blamed</p>
<p>for creating these people.</p>
<p>But they arrive on the world stage.</p>
<p>I mean, this is a giant play, right?</p>
<p>Human history is a giant play.</p>
<p>You have certain characters, you know,</p>
<p>we have American soap operas here in the United States</p>
<p>that have been on TV for like 50 years.</p>
<p>So we have this giant play, and there</p>
<p>are certain characters that are always there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always the Chinese.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always, you know, the Persians.</p>
<p>But then there are these characters that come in</p>
<p>and are really important to the story</p>
<p>for a short period of time, and then just sort of disappear.</p>
<p>Talk to me a little bit about the Normans</p>
<p>in that kind of a context.</p>
<p>Well, first, we&rsquo;ve got to think about what</p>
<p>the word actually means, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, don&rsquo;t we, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s connected with Northman.</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s connected with that</p>
<p>is because the Normans, you used the word fusion.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly the right word.</p>
<p>The Normans are a people who were</p>
<p>created in a sort of a process like nuclear fusion</p>
<p>between the Franks and the Vikings.</p>
<p>So the Franks under Charlemagne, around the turn</p>
<p>of the 8th into 9th centuries, had</p>
<p>begun expanding from a state that bridged</p>
<p>modern France and Germany.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the original European Union.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s France, Germany, Luxembourg, Austria,</p>
<p>Northern Italy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the 1950s version of an economically united Europe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the core of the Carolingian Frankish world.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s dual processes of expansion</p>
<p>of the Frankish world, south over the Pyrenees</p>
<p>into Muslim Iberia, and then north</p>
<p>into the pagan lands of Saxony, and up</p>
<p>towards what becomes a Danish march,</p>
<p>a sort of liminal zone between the Christian Frankish</p>
<p>people of the Carolingian Frankish world</p>
<p>and the Vikings, the Scandinavian pagan people</p>
<p>of the north.</p>
<p>Now, over time, those people start</p>
<p>to come into more and more regular contact</p>
<p>with one another.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m quite persuaded by the line of thought that</p>
<p>says the reason you start to see Viking raids in, you know,</p>
<p>the reason the Vikings set up at Lindisfarne</p>
<p>and in the mounds of rivers all down modern France</p>
<p>at the end of the 8th century is because the Franks are starting</p>
<p>to make themselves known, make themselves</p>
<p>known as a wealthy people who like to build monasteries,</p>
<p>i.e. undefended, wealthy places that are easy to raid.</p>
<p>So anyway, the bigger point is, little by little,</p>
<p>the Franks and the Vikings come into more and more</p>
<p>regular contact with one another,</p>
<p>so that by the end of the 9th century,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s constant Viking raiding into the Frankish world,</p>
<p>and a succession of Frankish kings</p>
<p>have to sort of scratch their heads</p>
<p>and wonder what on earth they&rsquo;re going to do about this.</p>
<p>This is sort of settled eventually</p>
<p>with the creation of Normandy.</p>
<p>With the award of land around the River Seine</p>
<p>and the city of, you know, the important city of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now Rouen, this is settled upon, effectively, a bunch of Vikings.</p>
<p>And the appeasement of the Vikings</p>
<p>is by giving them a little portion of the Frankish state</p>
<p>in which to live.</p>
<p>Now, their accommodation with the Frankish world</p>
<p>is most notably conversion to Christianity.</p>
<p>And then over a few generations, you know,</p>
<p>by the time we get to the middle of the 11th century,</p>
<p>you have a sort of quite unique people,</p>
<p>the people that produce, famously,</p>
<p>William the Conqueror, the bastard of Normandy</p>
<p>who invades England, or Robert Giscard and Count</p>
<p>Roger of Sicily, down in southern Italy and Sicily,</p>
<p>scourges of Byzantium and popes all at the same time.</p>
<p>But really, what are these Normans?</p>
<p>They are a hybrid of Franks, Christian,</p>
<p>but quite warlike Franks, and Vikings, you know,</p>
<p>out and out traveler, robber, pillager, trader.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some trader, of course.</p>
<p>You mustn&rsquo;t forget trader.</p>
<p>After they pillaged you, they&rsquo;ll trade with you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Wonderful news.</p>
<p>So these, but they&rsquo;re an extraordinary people.</p>
<p>Here in England, where I&rsquo;m sitting right now,</p>
<p>1066 is one of those turning point dates in history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the biggest dates in the whole of English history,</p>
<p>better known even than our loss of the American colonies.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re still much more hung up on the invasion</p>
<p>by William, Duke of Normandy, than we are by the sort of loss</p>
<p>of the colonies.</p>
<p>So the Normans get about.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just England.</p>
<p>Because as I&rsquo;ve just mentioned, it&rsquo;s also southern Italy.</p>
<p>And I think the arrival of the Normans in southern Italy</p>
<p>and the Norman conquest of Arab Sicily</p>
<p>is a judderingly important historical moment.</p>
<p>Because it becomes, those Norman territories</p>
<p>in southern Italy and Sicily become pivotal to the Crusades.</p>
<p>And I think the Crusades, 30 years on from the Norman</p>
<p>conquest, the first crusade, that really</p>
<p>is a historical turning point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that everybody in the whole</p>
<p>of the Western European world hears about.</p>
<p>1066 in England is not in that order of magnitude at all.</p>
<p>The fall of Jerusalem in 1099 to effrange, yes, the Franks,</p>
<p>but driven by the Normans, Beaumont and Crewe</p>
<p>at the heart of them.</p>
<p>I think the expansion, the creation of Normandy</p>
<p>and the expansion of the Normans into other parts of Europe,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really central part of the story of the High</p>
<p>Middle Ages.</p>
<p>There are some interesting historical ironies.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not, if I, see, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need, you want to mention</p>
<p>these historical ironies, but then you catch yourself</p>
<p>and say, OK, is this a real historical irony</p>
<p>or is this something that just appears that way,</p>
<p>you know, looking back from our modern eyes.</p>
<p>But for example, here you have these Frankish people</p>
<p>that are continually tying themselves</p>
<p>to ancient Roman sort of behavior.</p>
<p>The Franks themselves come into possession</p>
<p>of the territories they&rsquo;re in because</p>
<p>of Roman policies that brought barbarian people in</p>
<p>and made deals with them, right?</p>
<p>You defend this territory for the emperor</p>
<p>and you can have it.</p>
<p>Well, now you have the Franks who</p>
<p>are hundreds of years later essentially adopting</p>
<p>the same policy with these Viking peoples.</p>
<p>You can have a little of our Frankish territory, which</p>
<p>was originally given to us by the Romans</p>
<p>so we could defend it, so you can defend it.</p>
<p>And they just did what the Franks did too</p>
<p>and ended up creating their own empire based in Normandy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like the other empires.</p>
<p>So if you think about like a Frankish empire</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s now modern day France morphing into France,</p>
<p>if you think about what becomes the Holy Roman Empire morphing</p>
<p>into Germany, but the Normans are more like a free agent</p>
<p>people, if you will, like the first question someone</p>
<p>should have when you say the Normans in Sicily is you go,</p>
<p>wait a minute, how did the Normans</p>
<p>find themselves in Sicily?</p>
<p>And are these Norman soldiers or are these?</p>
<p>So in other words, trying to figure out and relate them</p>
<p>to peoples.</p>
<p>I mean, I was trying to figure out what the proper word</p>
<p>for Normans is.</p>
<p>Do you call Normans a tribe?</p>
<p>Do you call them a family?</p>
<p>Are they like proto-Hapsburgs?</p>
<p>They go around everywhere and rule multiple.</p>
<p>You had mentioned at one point that you</p>
<p>have Normans who are up at the wall between the Scottish</p>
<p>and English borders up at Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall</p>
<p>at the same time that they&rsquo;re all the way down at Sicily.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re moving towards the Middle East.</p>
<p>I mean, who are these guys?</p>
<p>And who makes up the soldiery?</p>
<p>I mean, is there a Norman ethnic group?</p>
<p>How does one put them in the normal boxes</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re used to working with?</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think part of this, I&rsquo;d be interested to know</p>
<p>what you think about this.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t part of it just the fact that by accident of history,</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t really Norman, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a sort of autonomous Normandy anymore?</p>
<p>Because we could say the same for the Burgundians.</p>
<p>You know, or maybe even the Gascons.</p>
<p>You know, these people from different regions</p>
<p>that have since been swallowed up.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you say they&rsquo;re absorbed maybe?</p>
<p>I mean, is that the way, or do they,</p>
<p>is absorbed or die out better?</p>
<p>I mean, how does one associate this?</p>
<p>They are, I mean, the history of Normandy,</p>
<p>Normandy&rsquo;s rolled into France, isn&rsquo;t it, after 1204.</p>
<p>Because the Normans become kings of England,</p>
<p>and then it splits up again.</p>
<p>But by and large, in the early Plantagenet era,</p>
<p>the Normans have become kings.</p>
<p>And so the Duchy of Normandy is no longer the grandest</p>
<p>of their possessions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also fused with the counts of,</p>
<p>you know, in the Plantagenets, you</p>
<p>have Dukes of Normandy, Counts of Anjou,</p>
<p>and then they peg on Aquitaine as well.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re ruling England, but France is the language,</p>
<p>French is the language they speak to each other, correct?</p>
<p>They speak in French, they&rsquo;re ruling England.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, but by this time, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not really talking about them in terms of a people or a tribe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not in that barbarian era anymore,</p>
<p>because really, we&rsquo;ve switched our thinking as historians</p>
<p>by this point, to thinking about ruling dynasties.</p>
<p>And so when we talk about the Normans in, you know,</p>
<p>in the early, in the late 12th century, early 13th century,</p>
<p>what we really mean is a very small aristocratic, you know,</p>
<p>a tiny royal family, a very small aristocratic group</p>
<p>connected to that family.</p>
<p>And really, you could be anybody,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re connected to the Duke of Normandy,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re, quote unquote, a Norman.</p>
<p>And similarly, in the south, you know,</p>
<p>Count Roger of Sicily, well, before he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Count Roger of Sicily, he&rsquo;s a Norman dude in southern Italy.</p>
<p>But once he becomes Count Roger of Sicily,</p>
<p>and then subsequently, you know, King Roger II of Sicily,</p>
<p>the fact of Norman-ness is now hidden</p>
<p>underneath the grander title of King of Sicily,</p>
<p>or, you know, whatever it happens to be.</p>
<p>And because we&rsquo;re not talking about tribal groups anymore,</p>
<p>because we can draw in much clearer detail as historians,</p>
<p>the pictures, the portraits, you know, the pen portraits,</p>
<p>I mean, of ruling individuals, we</p>
<p>stop really being concerned with peoples in general,</p>
<p>and start concentrating on people in specific.</p>
<p>Now, that ought to lead us to think, well,</p>
<p>hang on a second, then, when we&rsquo;re in the barbarian period,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about the Franks, the Burgundians,</p>
<p>the Visigoths, the Ostrogoths, are we really</p>
<p>talking about a people who are going around singing,</p>
<p>hey-ho, we&rsquo;re the Franks, hey-ho, we&rsquo;re the Visigoths,</p>
<p>watch out for us, mate?</p>
<p>Are these just historical terms we</p>
<p>have to use because of the paucity of evidence?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just aware that a group of people, a ruling group of people,</p>
<p>moved into a certain area?</p>
<p>This is a problem of wildly different evidence,</p>
<p>I think, between the early Middle Ages</p>
<p>and the high-slash-later Middle Ages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because when we think,</p>
<p>we had just mentioned the Arab conquests earlier,</p>
<p>and when you think about that in military terms,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a domino effect, where they&rsquo;ll conquer people,</p>
<p>and they become larger and larger, and more powerful,</p>
<p>and more capable.</p>
<p>But the Normans are kind of an opposite sort of thing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to figure out what</p>
<p>accounts for their success.</p>
<p>Like, over the eras, the viewpoint had changed.</p>
<p>I remember when we used to war game the Normans,</p>
<p>they always tried to figure out some sort of war gaming</p>
<p>advantage you can give them to try</p>
<p>to provide on the battlefield some semblance that</p>
<p>displayed the fact that these guys are doing amazing things.</p>
<p>I mean, if you read the Byzantine chroniclers,</p>
<p>for example, who thought all Franks were irresistible</p>
<p>chargers and whatnot, but even they</p>
<p>seem impressed by Normans and Norman leaders and whatnot.</p>
<p>Talk to me a little bit about what might explain</p>
<p>a relatively small number of people.</p>
<p>And the Normans are not some giant state.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not creating the same sort of domino effect</p>
<p>and absorbing other peoples as steppe peoples did,</p>
<p>as the Arabs did.</p>
<p>What the heck did these guys bring to the table?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s on a personal level, a personality level,</p>
<p>or a military level, that might account for this success.</p>
<p>Well, I think on a personal personality level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always tempting to see the kind of Viking outwardly</p>
<p>mobile mentality, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, describe what these guys looked like for a second.</p>
<p>Describe what the Byzantines were seeing when they ran</p>
<p>into Normans as people.</p>
<p>So the best images that we have, particularly</p>
<p>that you can tell a Norman by the sort of long teardrop</p>
<p>shaped shield.</p>
<p>But they look like Dolph Lundgren, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>The descriptions of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>Well, and Beaumont.</p>
<p>Anna Comneny writes about Beaumont.</p>
<p>Oh, Beaumont of Toronto.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent Normans</p>
<p>among the first Crusaders.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, she&rsquo;s so conflicted in her account of Beaumont.</p>
<p>Because on the one hand, he&rsquo;s a bastard.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, he&rsquo;s super handsome.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got a broad chest.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s really, really quite dishy.</p>
<p>And short blonde hair and clean shaven.</p>
<p>I mean, what the heck is that?</p>
<p>Come on, he&rsquo;s sort of a rock star.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a model.</p>
<p>But look, I think in your war game, or certainly in England.</p>
<p>Look at the Norman conquest in England.</p>
<p>In your war game, it&rsquo;s castles.</p>
<p>Norman&rsquo;s a great castle builder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their military, that&rsquo;s their super source, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>They come very well organized and very capable of building</p>
<p>these fortifications, which house bodies of knights</p>
<p>who are similar to Frankish knights.</p>
<p>The Frankish knight, as the Byzantine chronicles</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Make a hole through the walls of Babylon, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the line?</p>
<p>Hole through the walls of Babylon.</p>
<p>Yeah, that Frankish charge.</p>
<p>Couched lance charge, that&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a battlefield leveler against the traditional sort</p>
<p>of light cavalry mounted archers going to feign retreat</p>
<p>and then pepper you and come to chase it.</p>
<p>But I think the Normans in England, it&rsquo;s castle building.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their superpower, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>Well, I do, except you have a hard time sometimes trying</p>
<p>to put into perspective.</p>
<p>I mean, if a Norman, you know, this</p>
<p>is the kind of conversations you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have on a war gaming table.</p>
<p>I apologize to people.</p>
<p>But I mean, you would sit here and say something like, OK,</p>
<p>is a Norman just another knight?</p>
<p>And are knights the people that we consider to have this?</p>
<p>See, everything is rock, paper, scissors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to the audience now.</p>
<p>But everything is rock, paper, scissors</p>
<p>when it comes to this kind of warfare.</p>
<p>Because we can extol the value of a Western knight,</p>
<p>for example, in hand-to-hand combat</p>
<p>or charging through the walls of Babylon,</p>
<p>as the Byzantine chronicler said.</p>
<p>And yet, that&rsquo;s useless against a Magyar or an Avar or a Hun,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t catch them, or a Saracen in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>So everything is sort of the rock,</p>
<p>paper, scissors kind of thing.</p>
<p>What I can&rsquo;t figure out is, if a Norman knight is no better</p>
<p>than a Frankish knight, then how does one differentiate?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many more Frankish knights, right?</p>
<p>And they build castles, too.</p>
<p>And they all use the same weaponry.</p>
<p>So you try to figure out, see, in the old days,</p>
<p>when people would talk about different ethnic groups having</p>
<p>different tendencies, they would talk about, you know,</p>
<p>100 years ago, they would say the Normans were possessed</p>
<p>with the spirit of their Viking ancestors</p>
<p>and the same sort of, you know.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to explain what</p>
<p>accounts for this dominance.</p>
<p>15 years ago, they would have talked</p>
<p>about economic differences and savvy capitalist traders.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out</p>
<p>how you explain the rise of a people that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the traditional sorts of things</p>
<p>that one would look at, an economic base, a population</p>
<p>base, a religious explanation.</p>
<p>They seem like they shouldn&rsquo;t be where they are.</p>
<p>If that makes sense.</p>
<p>And yet they&rsquo;re, but then maybe, you know,</p>
<p>this has been super unfashionable for a long time.</p>
<p>But I just have a sense it might be coming back.</p>
<p>This great man theory of history,</p>
<p>which we will, great person theory of history,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been, we&rsquo;ve been, we had an almost beaten out of us,</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t we, Dan?</p>
<p>Yes, beaten out of us is a good way to put it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that, however, I have this little suspicion</p>
<p>that the next historical trends to come around,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve already discussed, and in a society</p>
<p>as we live in now, which is super, super, super</p>
<p>individualistic and completely focused on the individual</p>
<p>as being the most important thing,</p>
<p>and society as being really not very important at all,</p>
<p>unless it bends specifically to the will of the individual.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;re living politically</p>
<p>in an age of strongmen and would-be tyrants.</p>
<p>This, the influence of the sort of remarkable individual</p>
<p>might just be coming back into fashion and history.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s necessarily a bad thing,</p>
<p>because what are we really talking about</p>
<p>in terms of the Normans?</p>
<p>Who are the ones who, who is it that makes</p>
<p>these great plays, that puts them out there?</p>
<p>Well, in England, William the Conqueror.</p>
<p>I mean, all bets are off.</p>
<p>A Norman conquest of England without William the Conqueror,</p>
<p>I find very hard to imagine.</p>
<p>Not, you know, not, you know,</p>
<p>not, you know, not just the sort of military organization,</p>
<p>but then the, the vision to completely redesign England,</p>
<p>to move the bishoprics about, to bring across this new sort</p>
<p>of colonizing group.</p>
<p>That is the brainchild of one extraordinary leader.</p>
<p>And similarly, down in Sicily, we</p>
<p>are talking about a pair of brothers, Robert Giscard</p>
<p>and Roger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, too, because energy was the word I recall hearing</p>
<p>when I was young, energy, the Normans had such energy.</p>
<p>They had energy, but maybe just like a few of them</p>
<p>had some energy.</p>
<p>Guess what they went and did, right?</p>
<p>And, and after that, who knows?</p>
<p>It was, it&rsquo;s, uh, is it, as you were saying,</p>
<p>is it really the Normans at all?</p>
<p>I mean, certainly the Arab, well, again, as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>the Arabs couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference, could they?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>They say, well, they&rsquo;re all the Franks,</p>
<p>they all look the same to me.</p>
<p>They all look the same to me.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s talk for a minute because we had mentioned</p>
<p>earlier, um, uh, looking back and, and, and taking, you know,</p>
<p>what was the line from the Ohio state historian, right?</p>
<p>That, that history is the present politics</p>
<p>projected onto the past.</p>
<p>And we talked about climate change.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another one though, that I found, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny because we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>extensively about this too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny how on one level you can know about it</p>
<p>and on another level, not think about it.</p>
<p>But, um, I mean, you, you had gone into the Justinian plague</p>
<p>so well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk, everybody knows about the black death and,</p>
<p>and, but the Justinian plague is really,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that the black death part one, or, or if this,</p>
<p>if this is a movie trilogy, the black death is</p>
<p>the original godfather or exorcist or Jaws.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about that and maybe give us an idea</p>
<p>because these people in the time of the Justinian plague</p>
<p>are accustomed to disease being a terrible</p>
<p>and regular occurrence.</p>
<p>But how does something like that stand out in an era</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re accustomed to, to, uh, pandemics or,</p>
<p>or, or, or terrible disease outbreaks?</p>
<p>The Justinianic play in the sixth century,</p>
<p>unnamed for, uh, the, the great Byzantine emperor,</p>
<p>Justinian is a form of Yersinia pestis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s plague.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same as a black death.</p>
<p>And insofar as we can tell, because the evidence</p>
<p>is much scantier for the Justinianic plague</p>
<p>and is also back projected from the black death,</p>
<p>which is a problem we might get into in a minute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it seems to do a similar thing to what happens</p>
<p>in the 14th century, the black death,</p>
<p>which is it mutates and becomes very infectious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s just as, as COVID-19 is a coronavirus,</p>
<p>one of the group of viruses that became incredibly virulent</p>
<p>and incredibly infectious.</p>
<p>So you sometimes see with plague, it just mutates</p>
<p>and becomes super, super, super infectious.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you have in the sixth century</p>
<p>with the Justinianic plague.</p>
<p>And it seems to spread from may,</p>
<p>well, it finds its way into Egypt,</p>
<p>maybe from Zanzibar, maybe from East Africa.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very hard to know for sure.</p>
<p>And then it rips into the Byzantine,</p>
<p>the Eastern Roman empire.</p>
<p>And you have these accounts from Byzantine chroniclers</p>
<p>of lockdowns, of thousands of people dying each day,</p>
<p>of bodies piling up in the streets,</p>
<p>of everybody being completely terrified</p>
<p>of catching this disease.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re being, you know,</p>
<p>scarcely enough living to bury the dead.</p>
<p>There is, there&rsquo;s evidence that the disease found its way</p>
<p>as far afield, certainly as Germany, into Western Europe.</p>
<p>There is massive disparity in the estimates</p>
<p>of how many people died of the Justinianic plague,</p>
<p>which ranges from tens of millions to about 100,000.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The accounts give us the impression that this was,</p>
<p>just as the Black Death in the 14th century was,</p>
<p>which we do know killed up to 60% of populations</p>
<p>wherever it struck, this was pretty apocalyptic.</p>
<p>Traditionally, we&rsquo;ve been, you know,</p>
<p>I think that the historians have been on a journey</p>
<p>towards saying, well, maybe the Justinianic plague</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t as bad as we thought.</p>
<p>And these accounts of pandemic disease</p>
<p>do seem very overblown.</p>
<p>And I tell you what, you read them during a global pandemic</p>
<p>and suddenly, you know, you&rsquo;re back to thinking,</p>
<p>well, maybe actually these guys had a point, you know.</p>
<p>I found that certain writing about Justinianic plague</p>
<p>and the Black Death during a pandemic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible not to have your perspective</p>
<p>as a historian changed.</p>
<p>Let me give the listeners an example of your writing here</p>
<p>on the Justinianic plague.</p>
<p>This is a quote from Dan Jones&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>Quote, John of Ephesus was sent off by the emperor</p>
<p>to baptize pagans in Asia Minor,</p>
<p>but he found himself traveling through a death zone.</p>
<p>In town after town, the sick and suffering</p>
<p>staggered through the streets.</p>
<p>Their bellies swollen and mouths hanging open,</p>
<p>eyes bloodshot, pus leaking from their mouths.</p>
<p>Grand houses in which entire families</p>
<p>and their servants had died, stood silent.</p>
<p>Every room occupied by corpses.</p>
<p>Contorted bodies lay unburied,</p>
<p>their midriffs rotting and bursting</p>
<p>in the heat of the day.</p>
<p>The flesh half eaten by hungry dogs.</p>
<p>The roads and highways were empty.</p>
<p>The usual thrum of trade and traffic interrupted.</p>
<p>In desolate villages, no one was left</p>
<p>to harvest crops and fruit trees.</p>
<p>Animals were left unshepherded to roam the countryside</p>
<p>as they pleased.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s heavy duty stuff, and all of a sudden</p>
<p>makes you feel like the pandemic you&rsquo;re living in now,</p>
<p>you become very grateful</p>
<p>for modern medical technology, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, you sure do.</p>
<p>But look, let me tell you,</p>
<p>I mean, all of that passage that you quoted there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve drawn on, the reason John of Ephesus</p>
<p>is presented as the lead character</p>
<p>is that that&rsquo;s his account.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just my putting it into a sequence.</p>
<p>And so this isn&rsquo;t some sort of purple prose</p>
<p>flight of fantasy.</p>
<p>This is what your man saw and wrote down.</p>
<p>And as I was saying, I was writing that right at the&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I wrote that in March,</p>
<p>maybe April 2020.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s peak COVID terror.</p>
<p>Lockdown.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s impossible to write that without&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, during a pandemic,</p>
<p>without feeling a degree more sympathy</p>
<p>for John of Ephesus than one might have done</p>
<p>had I written it a year earlier.</p>
<p>When you begin, pandemic?</p>
<p>Oh, well, you know, really?</p>
<p>Can it be being quite so bad?</p>
<p>But this goes back to the beginning of our conversation,</p>
<p>which is what I don&rsquo;t do in that chapter</p>
<p>that you just quoted, is then really push the point</p>
<p>much harder and say,</p>
<p>see, see, this is just like COVID-19.</p>
<p>You just let that rise out of the text.</p>
<p>And I think anyone, well, I hope anyone reading that</p>
<p>in the next, say, five, ten years will go,</p>
<p>my God, yeah, that sounds really familiar.</p>
<p>Man, maybe I&rsquo;ve got a little more in common</p>
<p>with these medieval people than I thought I did.</p>
<p>I wrote a chapter in my book which came out</p>
<p>four months before the pandemic called</p>
<p>Pandemic Prologue, question mark.</p>
<p>And then in four months,</p>
<p>it was completely outdated and obsolete.</p>
<p>So I know exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>I would have loved the perspective of maybe being able</p>
<p>to look at our own time and draw some comparisons.</p>
<p>I probably would have done it in too heavy-handed a way.</p>
<p>So the way you did it is wonderful.</p>
<p>No, but I think you&rsquo;d have done it brilliantly</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a fantastically skilled historian.</p>
<p>But I think it is just&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, when I made that list I told you about,</p>
<p>climate change, mass migration, pandemic disease,</p>
<p>technological change, global networks,</p>
<p>pandemic disease was third on the list for a reason.</p>
<p>Like, this was before COVID.</p>
<p>And it was actually the thing I thought</p>
<p>might be hardest to sell.</p>
<p>Look, I knew I was going to have to write</p>
<p>about Justinianic plague.</p>
<p>I knew I was going to have to write about the Black Death.</p>
<p>But I was like, how am I going to sell this</p>
<p>to a 21st century audience as being something</p>
<p>that connects the modern to the medieval,</p>
<p>when the closest thing we&rsquo;ve had is SARS,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s 2004, and that&rsquo;s the Far East?</p>
<p>Like, is an American audience really going to buy</p>
<p>the danger of a pandemic in the 21st century?</p>
<p>Now, I was aware that actually clever people</p>
<p>in certainly the UK government,</p>
<p>and I think in the US government as well,</p>
<p>who were pulling risk assessments</p>
<p>for the biggest dangers of the present day</p>
<p>were putting pandemic disease right at the top.</p>
<p>But, dang, I mean, I didn&rsquo;t see one coming.</p>
<p>Did you?</p>
<p>No, well, I mean, you would hear people</p>
<p>like Bill Gates talking for a very long time,</p>
<p>talking about it&rsquo;s a law of averages thing, right?</p>
<p>Eventually, you&rsquo;re going to, it&rsquo;s going to turn,</p>
<p>the die roll is going to turn up wrong,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to get unlucky.</p>
<p>And then you hope that your ability</p>
<p>to pivot, medically speaking, can help you avoid</p>
<p>this sort of tragedy John of Ephesus was writing about.</p>
<p>So maybe now, because we&rsquo;ve dealt with a bunch</p>
<p>of different things, and I&rsquo;m jumping around,</p>
<p>but looking at my notes, there&rsquo;s one little jump</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to make, and it&rsquo;s a perspective question, right?</p>
<p>And maybe this is another one of those things</p>
<p>that let&rsquo;s hope not,</p>
<p>but that has some echoes in our own times.</p>
<p>I was curious about the way, and this is really how,</p>
<p>you know, your book starts with the Roman Empire</p>
<p>and then moves on from there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the way that the transition</p>
<p>from a Roman Republic, which, you know,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re looking at it from our perspective now,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the UK or the United States,</p>
<p>you would say, oh, a representative, you know,</p>
<p>these terms don&rsquo;t really apply to Rome,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll use them anyway.</p>
<p>A representative government is the superior form</p>
<p>of government to something like an autocracy</p>
<p>or a totalitarian state or an empire</p>
<p>or an imperial system that has an emperor</p>
<p>who has control of people.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not how someone like Augustus Caesar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>changing, you know, and, of course,</p>
<p>he had several successors afterwards</p>
<p>who helped codify these changes.</p>
<p>But, I mean, they didn&rsquo;t look at that</p>
<p>as a totalitarian ruler coming to power</p>
<p>on the ashes of a superior system, right?</p>
<p>A system of representation and wide distribution of power.</p>
<p>How come we don&rsquo;t look at someone like Augustus Caesar</p>
<p>as taking, I mean, if it happened in Germany in 1932,</p>
<p>we would say that a republic was destroyed</p>
<p>and on its back was a dictatorship,</p>
<p>but it would be seen completely different.</p>
<p>How come we view the Roman transition</p>
<p>from a republican form of government</p>
<p>to something else in a more positive light?</p>
<p>Is it because compared to what the republic was</p>
<p>at the very end, it was a more positive light?</p>
<p>Or is this more of us viewing it from, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose the British empire</p>
<p>in the late 19th century might have viewed it differently.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that you&rsquo;re celebrating something</p>
<p>that if it happened today, we would consider</p>
<p>to be a terrible thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think it&rsquo;s a special case, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good way to put it.</p>
<p>So the turn against empire as a historical trend</p>
<p>right now is profound, right?</p>
<p>And I mean, you&rsquo;ve got in London here,</p>
<p>people, you know, people defacing Churchill&rsquo;s statue.</p>
<p>You know, I talked to one of my kids about Churchill.</p>
<p>I was doing something to do with Churchill the other day,</p>
<p>TV-wise.</p>
<p>And I said, I mentioned Winston Churchill to one of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re ages 12 and nine, the oldest ones.</p>
<p>And the 12-year-old said, Churchill, Churchill.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I heard of that guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the racist guy, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wait, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on.</p>
<p>There are other things I might need to tell you</p>
<p>about Winston Churchill as well as that very salient fact.</p>
<p>You know, the turn against the British empire is,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s turned.</p>
<p>The turn against imperialism per se.</p>
<p>And yet we still remain sort of strangely sort of in love</p>
<p>with Rome, just as our medieval forebears were,</p>
<p>despite the fact this is one of the very few pure, true slave</p>
<p>states in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, yeah, but I mean,</p>
<p>the statues and the underfloor heating, man,</p>
<p>the underfloor heating.</p>
<p>Yeah, I challenge anybody to go to the ruins of a Roman villa,</p>
<p>probably built by slaves on wealth pillaged from people</p>
<p>the Romans considered inferior to themselves</p>
<p>on what we&rsquo;d now call eugenic basis.</p>
<p>And everyone would wander around going, shit, man,</p>
<p>the floor must have been super nice and warm.</p>
<p>But these people, they had it, you know, they had it right.</p>
<p>For some reason, we hive Rome off into a special case.</p>
<p>The turn from republic into empire wasn&rsquo;t a good thing.</p>
<p>I mean, actually, the best representation of this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever seen is in, oh, it&rsquo;s one of Robert Harris&rsquo;s novels,</p>
<p>in which he, through Cicero&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p>spells out pretty clearly what a corrupt stitch-up</p>
<p>this destruction of the republic and creation of the empire</p>
<p>really was.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re still not quite inclined to see it that way,</p>
<p>because just as our medieval forebears were,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still blindly in love with Rome.</p>
<p>You know, you bring up, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unfortunate, perhaps, that this late in the conversation,</p>
<p>you bring up something like this question of context</p>
<p>in the way we view the past now, because it&rsquo;s such a big thing</p>
<p>here in the States, for example.</p>
<p>And I know, you know, so this is it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s worth delving into it just a tad, I think,</p>
<p>because I have you here, and I&rsquo;m going to exploit the moment.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that if you&rsquo;re going to be fair,</p>
<p>it is wrong to hold people from, say, the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what your book is about,</p>
<p>to our modern standards of behavior, ethics, morals,</p>
<p>and those sorts of things.</p>
<p>And I think most people would agree with that.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to do that to people</p>
<p>from 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be some time period between those two</p>
<p>when all of a sudden, the forgiveness that comes</p>
<p>with living a very long time ago goes away,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re penalized for not jumping on board</p>
<p>the more, shall we say, modern ethical bandwagon when you did.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that a guy, you know, we do it with</p>
<p>the people, the so-called founding fathers here,</p>
<p>who were all born British citizens, let&rsquo;s remember,</p>
<p>people who look back on the Glorious Revolution</p>
<p>as one of their main influences,</p>
<p>that you look at those&hellip;</p>
<p>So Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s my favorite,</p>
<p>because to me, wrapped up in that figure</p>
<p>is all of the contradictions and hypocrisies</p>
<p>that are built into the American founding, right?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the guy who all by himself is respond&hellip;</p>
<p>almost all by himself, along with the earlier</p>
<p>Enlightenment thinkers who influenced him,</p>
<p>are responsible for the greatest marketing messages</p>
<p>to ever come out of this country, right?</p>
<p>Freedom, liberty, the rights of man, you know,</p>
<p>all men are created&hellip;</p>
<p>All the stuff that we emphasize in our own marketing campaigns</p>
<p>as a country.</p>
<p>And yet, obviously, the man owned slaves.</p>
<p>He was having, I&rsquo;m going to say, a relationship,</p>
<p>which is the really wrong word for this,</p>
<p>with his own slave.</p>
<p>I mean, you look at him and it&rsquo;s clear from his own view.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to eliminate slavery long term on one hand,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s doing nothing to eliminate it in his own life.</p>
<p>So you look at someone like that, you say,</p>
<p>okay, here&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s going to be trapped</p>
<p>because he doesn&rsquo;t come from 300 years earlier,</p>
<p>which probably would have exempted him</p>
<p>from modern moral questions.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t come from 200 years later,</p>
<p>which would have made it absolutely,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s no excuse for it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in that transition period where some people realize</p>
<p>that this practice is wrong,</p>
<p>so you need to jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>One can say the same thing about Churchill.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a guy born into a world where so many of his peers</p>
<p>and the way he was raised and everything</p>
<p>thought the way he did,</p>
<p>and then he lived to be 90-something, right?</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, you know, things changed</p>
<p>and he was left, you know, and I remember reading</p>
<p>in the 1920s and 1930s, they were already thinking of him</p>
<p>as an almost embarrassing political dinosaur</p>
<p>in some British circles.</p>
<p>How should we, and this may be something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not fair to even ask you,</p>
<p>but how should we roll with the punches here</p>
<p>in trying to figure, I mean, with Jefferson,</p>
<p>I always try to say, we&rsquo;ll laud him for the good stuff</p>
<p>and punish him for the bad stuff.</p>
<p>How should someone look at someone like Churchill</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s from, whose lifetime extends over a period</p>
<p>where the morality, even in his own world</p>
<p>and the circles he ran with, evolved past his opinion?</p>
<p>Well, look, Churchill was old-fashioned</p>
<p>even in his own time, and was a, you know,</p>
<p>made many, many, many, many, many, many mistakes,</p>
<p>was constantly behind the curve,</p>
<p>was in some ways living a sort of a strange,</p>
<p>slightly masochistic tribute act to his father.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Who nevertheless, in the 1930s,</p>
<p>or, you know, at the end of the 1930s into 1940,</p>
<p>at the point at which this person would,</p>
<p>in almost every other circumstances,</p>
<p>have just been written out of public life,</p>
<p>was there at the right moment,</p>
<p>and was exactly the right person for that role of leadership.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s the story of Churchill,</p>
<p>and the correct historical thing to do is say,</p>
<p>look, what were the moral standards,</p>
<p>ethics, and mores of the day?</p>
<p>Put aside whether you agree with them or not.</p>
<p>What were they in that day?</p>
<p>What was right in that day,</p>
<p>and what was considered wrong in that day?</p>
<p>And how did that person fit into that moral world?</p>
<p>Now, you do that with Churchill,</p>
<p>you still don&rsquo;t come out with super great guy.</p>
<p>You come out with a person who people thought was,</p>
<p>you know, many people had a problem with,</p>
<p>even in his own day,</p>
<p>who cometh the hour, cometh the man.</p>
<p>Everyone said, you know what,</p>
<p>actually, maybe this is the right person.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s the grown-up way of doing history,</p>
<p>but, oh, dear, I&rsquo;m going to sound like such an old man now.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re in such a sort of childish cultural space</p>
<p>at the moment, and such an individualistic space</p>
<p>at the moment that many historians</p>
<p>and many non-historians sort of dipping their toes</p>
<p>in the water think that history&rsquo;s all about them,</p>
<p>and that the practice of history is about going around,</p>
<p>telling people off for not having lived up</p>
<p>to an ideal moral standard,</p>
<p>and that that is really the most important thing</p>
<p>that a historian or someone engaging in history can do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pathetic.</p>
<p>But I think the point in general is that we are in this moment.</p>
<p>And what I also didn&rsquo;t mean to suggest with this</p>
<p>was a unique moment in human history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cycle, you know?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There was a book that was, oh, la, la, la.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book about that transition</p>
<p>from the Georgian to the Victorian</p>
<p>called The Age of Kant.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a similar sort of moralism</p>
<p>in its&hellip;</p>
<p>K-A-N-T, correct? K-A-N-T?</p>
<p>No, no, not the philosopher. C-A-N-T.</p>
<p>C-A-N-T. Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p>From Kant. So the&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by Vic Gattrall.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about this sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, the verb is this canting, pious rhetoric</p>
<p>which pervades public discourse</p>
<p>in which everyone is trying to say the most moral thing,</p>
<p>and that to slip up will be to invite ridicule, scorn,</p>
<p>and possibly, you know,</p>
<p>the disadvancement in one&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a similar sort of pious censoriousness</p>
<p>about public discourse now.</p>
<p>Now, I think it may be,</p>
<p>and I write about this in Powers and Thrones</p>
<p>at the end of the book,</p>
<p>I think it may be that it is connected</p>
<p>to new communications technology.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a good medieval example</p>
<p>of an age of Kant, C-A-N-T.</p>
<p>From printing, the printing press in the 1450s, right?</p>
<p>Comes along and makes it vastly easier to communicate,</p>
<p>to communicate en masse, to communicate at speed.</p>
<p>And what do you see happening in public discourse</p>
<p>in the decades afterwards?</p>
<p>It becomes incredibly moralistic,</p>
<p>incredibly censorious,</p>
<p>people attacking one another all over the place.</p>
<p>And you have a culture war that emerges,</p>
<p>which is what we call the Reformation.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s an analogy to be drawn there</p>
<p>with the age of the iPhone and social media,</p>
<p>the immediacy and the availability of publishing</p>
<p>and of publishing at scale.</p>
<p>And what do you see happening immediately</p>
<p>to human discourse?</p>
<p>It becomes very, very fractious</p>
<p>and very, very sort of pompous.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the moment we&rsquo;re living in at the moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the moment we&rsquo;re living in right now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s definitely not anything new</p>
<p>in terms of the long view of human history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, for me, as you can tell,</p>
<p>quite irritating to actually live through.</p>
<p>Well, let me validate what you said about cycles, too.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to blame the British for this</p>
<p>since I have one of them.</p>
<p>But I mean, in the early history of the Americas,</p>
<p>when you have Puritans and all this sort of thing,</p>
<p>we were shunning, we were shaming,</p>
<p>we were banishing from the public sphere.</p>
<p>I mean, this is how things were done.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;ve just taken that quintessentially</p>
<p>proto-American quality, added social media to it,</p>
<p>made sure that there is no&hellip;</p>
<p>See, at least the public shaming and all those things</p>
<p>that were going on in those Puritan communities,</p>
<p>there was one moral standard.</p>
<p>Now we have multiple moral standards,</p>
<p>and you can be shamed for any of them</p>
<p>by the groups that associate with those morals.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s public shaming on steroids with social media.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I feel like this is the same cycle</p>
<p>with some amplification involved.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll blame that on the British and call it good, right?</p>
<p>All right, okay. It feels like we&rsquo;re even.</p>
<p>You brought up Georgian stuff. I&rsquo;m just going a little earlier.</p>
<p>Listen, is there anything I didn&rsquo;t bring up that you want to&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, first of all, the book is wonderful.</p>
<p>It is one of those books,</p>
<p>and I can hear my mother&rsquo;s voice in my head,</p>
<p>who, if you read this book from cover to cover</p>
<p>and remembered it, you would have a giant chunk</p>
<p>of your Western historical knowledge completely filled in.</p>
<p>Is there anything, because it&rsquo;s a thousand pages,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I left out all the best parts.</p>
<p>What did I leave out that we should get into?</p>
<p>Oh, man. I mean, there&rsquo;s just so much.</p>
<p>I had such a blast writing it.</p>
<p>Look, I enjoyed&hellip; I&rsquo;ve written a lot of&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written dynastic history,</p>
<p>Plantagenet&rsquo;s Wars of the Roses before this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written religious military history</p>
<p>with Templars and Crusaders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done some constitutional history with Magna Carta.</p>
<p>I actually really enjoyed getting into the architectural,</p>
<p>the literary, the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, your stuff on the Carolingian script</p>
<p>was fascinating.</p>
<p>Ah, but even the sort of later stuff, you know,</p>
<p>I wrote&hellip; There&rsquo;s a chapter in the book called Builders,</p>
<p>which is about&hellip; It&rsquo;s sort of set in the 13th century,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about castle building,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;d, you know, made some TV shows</p>
<p>for Netflix about castles,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about Gothic architecture.</p>
<p>And I just got to pull into that all my experience.</p>
<p>I was running in lockdown, so I couldn&rsquo;t travel.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t travel a lot, but I got to pull in all my memories</p>
<p>and experiences and notes about&hellip;</p>
<p>about traveling to great Gothic cathedrals</p>
<p>in England and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And I&hellip; Man, I loved bringing in that aspect of it.</p>
<p>I loved doing the chapter called Renewers,</p>
<p>which is&hellip; goes from Petrarch and Dante and Tzatzarima</p>
<p>and this sort of new poetry of the 13th century</p>
<p>into&hellip; into the great painter van Eyck,</p>
<p>you know, moving oil painting somewhere it&rsquo;d never been before,</p>
<p>to da Vinci, you know, the universal genius.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ve said already, this figure who connects</p>
<p>the medieval and the modern so brilliantly.</p>
<p>And so what&hellip; I suppose&hellip; What am I trying to say?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to say that actually my takeaway</p>
<p>from the Middle Ages, or what I hope people will take away</p>
<p>from my book about the Middle Ages, is that there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a lot of dudes slaying each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a&hellip; that&rsquo;s a constant in history.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also, I hope more than any book I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>this sort of&hellip; a much richer texture</p>
<p>to life in the Middle Ages, and a greater sense</p>
<p>of the legacy, the visual, artistic, cultural legacy</p>
<p>that this extraordinary age brought to us.</p>
<p>But, I mean, we could be talking another two hours,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d still get nowhere near&hellip;</p>
<p>And Dan, let&rsquo;s not be surprised that you come on this show</p>
<p>and somehow artwork gets the short shrift.</p>
<p>It was just going to happen, okay?</p>
<p>You knew there was going to be charging</p>
<p>through the walls of Babylon and not enough Da Vinci.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just&hellip; That&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it goes. That&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<p>But look, I could talk to you all day,</p>
<p>because, you know, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of yours.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;ve done for history and the public&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, the way you&rsquo;ve fed the public appetite</p>
<p>for history in this medium and with your books</p>
<p>is&hellip; it&rsquo;s extraordinary, and you&rsquo;re doing a great thing.</p>
<p>And I know that, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, you know this, and I&rsquo;m just flattering you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s time for the show to end, Dan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s when we know it&rsquo;s time for the show to end.</p>
<p>Once we start complimenting the host, it&rsquo;s done, okay?</p>
<p>My friend, thank you so much. The book is fantastic.</p>
<p>Powers and Thrones. Everybody should get a copy.</p>
<p>I read the PDF.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to get a copy myself someday.</p>
<p>I will buy it. Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need any freebies around here.</p>
<p>It was worth it. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>And ladies and gentlemen, Dan Jones has been doing</p>
<p>good work for a while. This is&hellip;</p>
<p>I have to be honest, and maybe it&rsquo;s just because</p>
<p>the subject matter is so comprehensive.</p>
<p>It was&hellip; So far, it&rsquo;s my favorite book</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever written, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks, brother. That&rsquo;s super kind.</p>
<p>My thanks to Dan Jones for coming on the program.</p>
<p>That was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>His new book, Powers and Thrones,</p>
<p>A New History of the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>is scheduled to come out November 9th, 2021.</p>
<p>So may or may not yet be out by the time you get this show.</p>
<p>His other books, of course, currently available</p>
<p>and worth getting if you&rsquo;ve not been exposed to that.</p>
<p>The Plantagenets, Crusaders, The Templars, Magna Carta.</p>
<p>You know, if the Middle Ages and this region of the world</p>
<p>is something you really like or think you might,</p>
<p>Dan Jones is one of the really good people</p>
<p>to tell you all about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being strenuously reminded, because I am,</p>
<p>and there ought to be a registered trademark symbol</p>
<p>after this phrase, the worst marketer in the world,</p>
<p>that I should probably tell everyone or remind everyone</p>
<p>that as the holiday gift-giving season approaches,</p>
<p>you know, if you can&rsquo;t think of anything else out there,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve run out of time, or whatever it might be,</p>
<p>really hard, weird person to buy for, maybe,</p>
<p>that we do sell the archived Hardcore History shows,</p>
<p>either singly or in bunches, from the website.</p>
<p>I think we worked it out so that it&rsquo;s priced at, like,</p>
<p>if you buy the whole catalog, it&rsquo;s like a dollar an hour,</p>
<p>works out to you, content-wise, I hope that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>We also have some new merchandise on the way,</p>
<p>different design stuff, but I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s coming in, frankly.</p>
<p>Hope it makes it for the holidays, not sure yet.</p>
<p>We do have gift certificates available.</p>
<p>And we have another method we just hooked up recently</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying out to give another option</p>
<p>to people who buy, again, you know,</p>
<p>as the worst marketer in the world, I&rsquo;m told,</p>
<p>to make sure I explain this, but it involves another way</p>
<p>to get our premium feed, so that it works better</p>
<p>with, for example, people with certain kinds of pod catchers,</p>
<p>than our old system, or our current system on the website.</p>
<p>So, more options, we figure, is better for everyone.</p>
<p>So, check that out if that sounds good to you.</p>
<p>And for those who ask, because I know you always do,</p>
<p>we are currently working on the next big Hardcore History show.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when it&rsquo;s gonna be ready.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same old problem that it always is.</p>
<p>And I hope we can get these little, you know, appetizers out</p>
<p>to keep you from starving to death, you know,</p>
<p>between main courses.</p>
<p>But thank you for everything.</p>
<p>Everybody, as always, I&rsquo;m very grateful.</p>

<p>Thanks again for all your Bucca Show donations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the reason we&rsquo;re still here.</p>
<p>At the end of the last HHA show, we mentioned, uh,</p>
<p>the folks over at Battle Guide Virtual Tours.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna continue to do that for a little while,</p>
<p>because I think you, if you&rsquo;re interested in military history,</p>
<p>and not everyone is, so let&rsquo;s just say that right off the bat.</p>
<p>But if you are, you know how difficult it is sometimes</p>
<p>to get your mind around what&rsquo;s going on at some of these battles.</p>
<p>If you pull out a map, or you&rsquo;re reading a book,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re watching a documentary, or whatever it might be,</p>
<p>um, there&rsquo;s so much going on at so many different levels</p>
<p>that even if you are on the ground at, like, one of these tours</p>
<p>that you can go on, uh, there&rsquo;s still&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to get a sense through the fog of war</p>
<p>and the terrain, what&rsquo;s hidden from&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, battles are complicated things, right?</p>
<p>So, the&hellip; During the pandemic that happened,</p>
<p>I was in touch with a group called Battle Guide Virtual Tours,</p>
<p>who were people that did real tours.</p>
<p>And like so many businesses around the world,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to pivot</p>
<p>and keep some sort of a business going.</p>
<p>Uh, when no one knew when there were going to be any tourists</p>
<p>or anyone who wanted to visit battlefields</p>
<p>in person anymore, right?</p>
<p>But the way that they figured out how to do this,</p>
<p>and this is just my opinion, I mean, I&hellip;</p>
<p>They may have a different opinion,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s like the Hershey&rsquo;s Peanut Butter Cup commercial.</p>
<p>You got your chocolate in my peanut butter,</p>
<p>and oh, it&rsquo;s better than ever.</p>
<p>Um, I love what they did to create something</p>
<p>you could download at home.</p>
<p>And as I told them, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wonderful to be able to take one of those</p>
<p>once-in-a-lifetime trips to a battlefield somewhere</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve always wanted to go to,</p>
<p>but what if you want to go to another one</p>
<p>the week afterwards, or something like that?</p>
<p>I mean, this opens the door to people getting to see</p>
<p>lots of battlefields with this sort of approach.</p>
<p>And the approach is, you&rsquo;ll have to see it for yourself,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really here to tell you,</p>
<p>is that you can do that for free,</p>
<p>and just see if you like it, and then if you like it,</p>
<p>you know, you can take it from there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to convince you one way or the other.</p>
<p>I just wanted you to get an idea from a perspective</p>
<p>of somebody who&rsquo;s always trying to understand these things.</p>
<p>Without all these elements, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And the way that they&rsquo;ve put it together</p>
<p>is something I think is pretty cool.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re into military history,</p>
<p>and if you feel like I do, that you&rsquo;d really like</p>
<p>to better understand everything going on</p>
<p>at some of these battles, go see if you like</p>
<p>any of these battles that they offer.</p>
<p>Uh, go to battleguide.co.uk forward slash carlin,</p>
<p>battleguide.co.uk forward slash carlin,</p>
<p>and get one of the free shows that&rsquo;s put aside for you,</p>
<p>and just see what you think.</p>
