    <p>This is an All Ears English podcast, episode 1906.</p>
<p>Create your own playful adjectives in English.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All Ears English podcast, downloaded more than 200 million times.</p>
<p>Are you feeling stuck with your English? We&rsquo;ll show you how to become fearless and fluent by</p>
<p>focusing on connection, not perfection. With your American hosts, Lindsay McMahon, the English</p>
<p>adventurer, and Michelle Kaplan, the New York radio girl, coming to you from Colorado and New</p>
<p>York City, USA. And to get your transcripts delivered by email every week, go to allearsenglish.com</p>
<p>forward slash subscribe. Did you know that native speakers invent their own adjectives when they</p>
<p>want to be a little fun and less direct? Today, find out exactly how to do this in English and</p>
<p>when you should use it and when to avoid it. Hey, Michelle, what&rsquo;s shaking? Hey, Lindsay,</p>
<p>not too much. How are you? I&rsquo;m feeling great. I&rsquo;m feeling great. What are we talking about today</p>
<p>for listeners? Well, this is going to be a fun one. So recently we did an episode where we were</p>
<p>talking about the expression your neck of the woods. I believe it was 1900. Guys, go listen</p>
<p>to that one. Yes. And you said, I think it was because we were talking about, like, if you say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m where you live or like, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. You were</p>
<p>talking about, oh, I&rsquo;m going to be in your neighborhood. And I said, that sounds a little</p>
<p>stalkery. Stalkery. Yeah. And then you were saying, and rightfully so, that that would be</p>
<p>great for a future episode. So I wanted to just snatch it up right away, because why wait?</p>
<p>Oh, this is great. This is so native and natural. And I have a feeling</p>
<p>our listeners have never learned this. This is not going to be taught in any textbook,</p>
<p>guys. So listen in today. This is good stuff. Absolutely. So, I mean, what does that mean to</p>
<p>say something sounds stalkery? Yeah. So what we&rsquo;re doing here is we&rsquo;re taking the word</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re adding Y, which sounds like E. Right. So we&rsquo;re saying stalkery. If you guys</p>
<p>have the transcripts on the iOS or Android app, you&rsquo;ll see this. It means something is</p>
<p>like a stalker or someone is like a stalker. Stalkery. What is a stalker?</p>
<p>A stalker is, yeah, someone who, well, often men following women, to be honest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually how it happens. Just someone who crosses boundaries and in a creepy way,</p>
<p>in a way that feels like dangerous to the woman, follows her and keeps an eye on her.</p>
<p>And sometimes she has to get a restraining order in that case. Right. That kind of thing.</p>
<p>Right. Sometimes it happens. There&rsquo;s celebrity stalkers. Oh, yeah. Right. So that could be,</p>
<p>that might be, yeah, not a gender specific. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it&rsquo;s not always meant to</p>
<p>women or meant to men. It&rsquo;s just, yeah, if someone&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like usually obsessive.</p>
<p>Obsessive. Yeah. And I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, sometimes we could do a whole episode on this.</p>
<p>But like, sometimes we use it like more as a joke. And sometimes it&rsquo;s serious.</p>
<p>It kind of makes me think a little bit of those, you know, those tours you take in Hollywood,</p>
<p>like the Hollywood Hills tours. I feel a little weird sometimes. I&rsquo;ve been on that tour once or</p>
<p>twice because you&rsquo;re literally in a van. Luckily, you&rsquo;re visiting like 25 different Hollywood</p>
<p>stars homes. So it&rsquo;s not just one person, which would be weird. But you&rsquo;re in a van sitting out</p>
<p>there looking at the front of their house. It&rsquo;s weird and strange, you know?</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s true. Anyway, but yeah, you could have just said, oh, that sounds</p>
<p>like a stalker or that sounds like something like a stalker, like a stalker would say. Right. But</p>
<p>you said stalkery. So why didn&rsquo;t you just say like, oh, that sounds like a stalker, right?</p>
<p>Oh, because it&rsquo;s more fun. It&rsquo;s fun. What we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re using art. We&rsquo;re creating art here with our</p>
<p>language, guys. You know, we are, we&rsquo;re inventing a word. I mean, this is a word. I&rsquo;ve heard people</p>
<p>say it. But in that instance, I kind of invented it. Right. A little bit. Yeah. Right. Having fun</p>
<p>with language. Right. Exactly. Exactly. So this is just a very common way to express yourself</p>
<p>with some personality. And Lindsay, like you said, it&rsquo;s an art. I mean, I mean, so but what</p>
<p>does it convey if you do that? It conveys that I&rsquo;m not afraid to break the rules. Right. Because</p>
<p>this is not really something you&rsquo;re going to find in a grammar textbook as a rule, guys.</p>
<p>Right. This is not like conventional English grammar. This is slang, urban dictionary type</p>
<p>stuff, I guess. It conveys that I&rsquo;m just I&rsquo;ve got a great noun. And instead of finding an adjective,</p>
<p>a totally different word, I&rsquo;m going to put a Y at the end because I want to use that noun</p>
<p>to describe to make it an adjective. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. I like it. Yeah. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of what I&rsquo;m doing. Yeah. And it&rsquo;s fun. Like like it. It made me laugh, I think, in the episode.</p>
<p>Right. Like it kind of it was kind of humorous that you said stalkery. Yeah, it&rsquo;s fun. So I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s fun because it&rsquo;s spontaneous. Like that&rsquo;s that couldn&rsquo;t have been in really a script.</p>
<p>It was something personal to me that I came up with. Right. That&rsquo;s fun. Right. Yeah. I love that.</p>
<p>OK, so guys, so the format is noun plus Y. Right. So. Yeah. Yeah. E. E. Stalker E. And</p>
<p>be careful because if you&rsquo;re seeing this in writing, you might think it&rsquo;s stalkery</p>
<p>because often the I the Y is put. Right. Isn&rsquo;t it? Yeah. Sometimes it could be. But it&rsquo;s E. So</p>
<p>just be careful there, guys. Right. Right. Right. Right. So really. So it really kind of changes</p>
<p>it to an adjective, really. Yeah. So, yeah, we&rsquo;re going to talk more about this today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more of like this, like the idea of like a person or a thing into an adjective.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s do nouns into adjectives now with E. So let&rsquo;s do some examples.</p>
<p>OK, here we go. Oh, wow. Look at you. You&rsquo;re so parenty. So responsible.</p>
<p>Right. So you&rsquo;re just like being funny there. Parenty. Right.</p>
<p>Yeah. And again, it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s fun because maybe you and I are like meeting for lunch and you have</p>
<p>your two kids and all the stroller, all the things that you have as a mom, you know now. Right. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no better word in that moment than just you&rsquo;re so parenty. Right. Right. It&rsquo;s fine. Like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just embracing you and just putting a word on it. Right. Yeah. Right. It&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another one. She gives off very teachery vibes. So I&rsquo;m not surprised she&rsquo;s a teacher.</p>
<p>There really are people like this, especially for teachers that teach younger kids. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a certain tone of voice that I&rsquo;m often like, oh, I&rsquo;m not surprised that person&rsquo;s a teacher.</p>
<p>Right. They just have a certain nature to them. Playful, sweet. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Right. Right. Right. Exactly. All right. What&rsquo;s another one? Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>OK. It was a good show. It was kind of high school music musically. Right. So I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>let me say that again. It was a good show. It was kind of high school musically. Interesting.</p>
<p>That one. Wow. Musically. Again, spontaneous. You can put this on the end of any now.</p>
<p>Literally. There&rsquo;s no rules here. Right. Right. Yeah. So.</p>
<p>Yeah. So it&rsquo;s just like there it&rsquo;s like saying maybe, oh, like it was good, but maybe it was</p>
<p>like maybe like I mean, high school musicals can be very good. OK. I didn&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>were referring to a particular the actual. Oh, yeah. Then there&rsquo;s high school. Yes,</p>
<p>there is high school musical. Right. OK. OK. Good. I don&rsquo;t know. Well, either one.</p>
<p>That could work, too. Right. So if I was saying this seemed like that movie,</p>
<p>like it reminded me of that movie, I could say it was very high school musically. Right. Right.</p>
<p>Right. That&rsquo;s tough to say. Yeah, I brought that. It&rsquo;s hard to say. It&rsquo;s hard to say. Yeah.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, so. Right. We talked about parenting and then teachery, you know,</p>
<p>so we kind of went through these. Sometimes we use this to clue at something else,</p>
<p>but not exactly say it to hint at something else. That&rsquo;s what I should say.</p>
<p>Right. Like, oh, like, you know, oh, it&rsquo;s very high school musically. Right. Like,</p>
<p>maybe you have this and maybe you have this feeling like that. I mean, it&rsquo;s funny. I shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like I was in high school musical. So but like, you know, just I don&rsquo;t know, maybe that&rsquo;s a way</p>
<p>to say it&rsquo;s like very maybe a little amateur, you know, like something like that. I feel bad</p>
<p>insulting high school music. Yeah. No, no. Like, for example, I&rsquo;m thinking like I&rsquo;m thinking about</p>
<p>banana bread because I bought this great loaf of bread at Whole Foods last week. It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got dates and nuts in it. But maybe someone you caught someone invite you to their house.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so excited. They made their signature banana bread. But let&rsquo;s say, you know, they put</p>
<p>too many bananas in their banana bread and you go, oh, it&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s really banana. Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a perfect example. That&rsquo;s a perfect example. Right. So, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to offend them or even tell them that there&rsquo;s too many bananas. You&rsquo;re just saying</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of bananas in here and maybe they&rsquo;re trying to do it that way. I mean, that&rsquo;s me, but</p>
<p>right. Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah. All right. I love it. So what else, Michelle? This is fun.</p>
<p>This is so fun. I mean, you can also say like something is like alcoholy. Right. Like I like</p>
<p>to I mean, to be honest, I don&rsquo;t love the taste of alcohol. Right. So I might say like if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ordering a drink, I might I mean, and I have in the past said something like, oh, does it taste</p>
<p>very like alcoholy? Like, yeah. Yeah. That would be a common one that I&rsquo;m sure bartenders get a lot.</p>
<p>Right. Don&rsquo;t you think? Right. I would think. Right. Like it&rsquo;s just like more fun, kind of</p>
<p>cutesy than saying like, oh, does it have a strong alcohol taste? Right. Like what&rsquo;s the alcohol</p>
<p>content or what? Yeah. Right. I&rsquo;ve run into that. Alcoholy. Yeah. I wonder if there would</p>
<p>ever be a time, Michelle, that it would sound weird to add E. I mean, I think the musically</p>
<p>was hard to say. I would say that like the high school musical. Yeah. Yeah. So even though that</p>
<p>was my example. Sorry. But like I but it&rsquo;s true. It wasn&rsquo;t hard to say. I think sometimes sometimes</p>
<p>if you have like a word that already ends with E, it might be a little awkward. Oh, gosh. Like,</p>
<p>oh, like, oh, he&rsquo;s very attorney. Like that&rsquo;s right. Right. Or like she&rsquo;s a secret. He&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very secretary. Even though I have heard people do this and I&rsquo;ve done it, it&rsquo;s just hard to say</p>
<p>you have to make sure the person knows exactly what you&rsquo;re saying and what you&rsquo;re going for.</p>
<p>Right. Right. I would agree with that. Yeah. Yeah. So. All right. Well, let&rsquo;s do a role play with</p>
<p>with with another one. All right. Here we go. Well, here we&rsquo;re talking about people that we</p>
<p>met at a party. So here we go. Oh, Pete was really nice. Really? I thought he was a little</p>
<p>librarian. What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean? I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe a little dry.</p>
<p>Well, my mom is a librarian. Oh, my gosh. I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>But librarians are cool now, right? It&rsquo;s cool. It&rsquo;s kind of nerdy. Nerds are cool. I mean,</p>
<p>Michelle, things have changed. Exactly. Exactly. So I shouldn&rsquo;t make fun of that.</p>
<p>So you said I said Pete was really nice and you said, really? I thought he was a little librarian.</p>
<p>Right. Librarian. Yeah. Right. So I&rsquo;m hinting here like like I didn&rsquo;t want to say what I</p>
<p>thought, but then you went for it because you&rsquo;re like, well, what do you mean? Like,</p>
<p>yeah. So I was kind of then like, oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Like I was hoping you would like you did</p>
<p>understand what I was saying. But and that&rsquo;s why you kind of got a little defensive. Right?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. I mean, and what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re kind of trying to mask what you</p>
<p>really think, which is maybe you think he&rsquo;s kind of boring or like kind of quiet or just</p>
<p>not dynamic or something. Right. So you&rsquo;re kind of using this E word to have fun and</p>
<p>describe something that you don&rsquo;t want to say directly. Exactly. I&rsquo;m hinting at something,</p>
<p>but you picked right up on it and you did not like it. I&rsquo;m pretty quick, Michelle. You are.</p>
<p>And I mean, so that is like I wanted to do that example not to insult librarians. Guys,</p>
<p>librarians are very cool and very important. But I wanted to do that to show you that like</p>
<p>sometimes this can be like used to stereotype and you know, so in that kind of context,</p>
<p>you do want to be careful because then you can end up putting your foot in your mouth,</p>
<p>which what does that mean? Oh, my gosh. Yes. Do really regret what you&rsquo;ve just said,</p>
<p>because then my mom&rsquo;s a librarian. Right. It turns out. Right. So, yeah, you have to be careful</p>
<p>what you say and how you kind of can. Yeah. So be careful with this. Have fun with it. But just</p>
<p>be careful. Be careful. Right. Right. Right. Exactly. Like so here I was kind of like</p>
<p>offensive things to say about librarians that I believe in real life. But just for the example.</p>
<p>But yeah. And you caught me and I realized like, oh, no. Yeah. I&rsquo;ve said that. I love it. So good.</p>
<p>I think this is a great episode. It&rsquo;s how you guys can be creative with your language and not have to</p>
<p>say the straightforward words that I think as human beings, for some reason, we just don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to say because they don&rsquo;t help connection. Right. That&rsquo;s true. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. No, this was</p>
<p>fun. This was a great idea, Lindsay. I&rsquo;m glad that like you that you said stalkery and the other</p>
<p>episode. But yeah, guys, try it. Try this out. I mean, this is one to have fun with, to be playful</p>
<p>with. I gave you some like actual, you know, like real concrete examples that you can use. Right.</p>
<p>That like, you know, try try going to if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re old enough and you are ordering</p>
<p>a drink and, you know, ask, oh, is it very alcoholic? Right. Like that&rsquo;s totally normal.</p>
<p>You can definitely use. Yes. You know, and then other ones, you know, try and see how this could</p>
<p>this could like kind of apply to the conversations you have instead of saying, oh, does this have a</p>
<p>lot of alcohol in it? Right. Just like different examples of, you know, try and try and think it</p>
<p>over in your head of like, is there is there a moment when I could try this out? What would I do?</p>
<p>I love that idea. And also, now that you guys know that native speakers create this weird way of</p>
<p>inventing words, you&rsquo;re going to hear this. And whereas before listening to today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you may have just totally misunderstood what they were saying or just gotten lost in a little bit</p>
<p>distressed. Now you&rsquo;re going to get it. You&rsquo;re going to I know what you&rsquo;re doing right. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing right. You&rsquo;re making up a fun little adjective. Right. Right. Keep your ears open</p>
<p>for that one. And, you know, also, I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m really curious, you know, let us know. Are there you know,</p>
<p>is there something similar in your first language or another language that you speak</p>
<p>or this kind of these playful things kind of happen where you hint at something by making</p>
<p>up a word? Right. As I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun right now, Michelle, prepping for my trip to Argentina.</p>
<p>We are recording this in advance, but I&rsquo;m going to Argentina in a week and a half and I&rsquo;m learning</p>
<p>the Argentine slang. Right. It is so fun. And just the rhythm, the tone of voice,</p>
<p>the accent is so unique and beautiful. I&rsquo;m super excited. So I&rsquo;ll come back with some</p>
<p>stories for sure. That&rsquo;s great. Can&rsquo;t wait. All right, Lindsay. Well, thanks for this idea.</p>
<p>All right. Thanks for hanging out, Michelle. I&rsquo;ll talk to you very soon. Have a good one.</p>
