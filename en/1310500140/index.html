    <p>The following is a conversation with Alex Filipenko, an astrophysicist and professor</p>
<p>of astronomy from Berkeley.</p>
<p>He was a member of both the Supernova Cosmology Project and the HiZ Supernova Search Team</p>
<p>which used observations of the extragalactic supernova to discover that the universe is</p>
<p>accelerating and that this implies the existence of dark energy.</p>
<p>This discovery resulted in the 2011 NOVA Prize for Physics.</p>
<p>Outside of his groundbreaking research, he is a great science communicator and is one</p>
<p>of the most widely admired educators in the world.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this conversation and am sure Alex will be back again in the future.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that as we talk about in this conversation, the objects that</p>
<p>populate the universe are both awe inspiring and terrifying in their capacity to create</p>
<p>and to destroy us.</p>
<p>Solar flares and asteroids lurking in the darkness of space threaten our humble, fragile</p>
<p>existence here on Earth.</p>
<p>In the chaos, tension, conflict, and social division of 2020, it&rsquo;s easy to forget just</p>
<p>how lucky we humans are to be here, and with a bit of hard work, maybe one day, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>venture out towards the stars.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Alex Filipenko.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by talking about the biggest possible thing, the universe.</p>
<p>Will the universe expand forever or collapse on itself?</p>
<p>Well, you know, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the big questions of cosmology, and of course, we have evidence that the matter</p>
<p>density is sufficiently low that the universe will expand forever.</p>
<p>But not only that, there&rsquo;s this weird repulsive effect, we call it dark energy for want of</p>
<p>a better term, and it appears to be accelerating the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>So if that continues, the universe will expand forever, but it need not necessarily continue.</p>
<p>It could reverse sign, in which case the universe could, in principle, collapse at some point</p>
<p>in the far, far future.</p>
<p>So in terms of investment advice, if you were to give me and then to bet all my money on</p>
<p>one or the other, where does your intuition currently lie?</p>
<p>Well, right now, I would say that it would expand forever because I think that the dark</p>
<p>energy is likely to be just quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.</p>
<p>The vacuum zero energy state is not a state of zero energy.</p>
<p>That is, the ground state is a state of some elevated energy which has a repulsive effect</p>
<p>to it.</p>
<p>And that will never go away because it&rsquo;s not something that changes with time.</p>
<p>So if the universe is accelerating now, it will forever continue to do so.</p>
<p>And yet, I mean, you so effortlessly mentioned dark energy.</p>
<p>Do we have any understanding of what the heck that thing is?</p>
<p>Well, not really.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re getting progressively better observational constraints.</p>
<p>So different theories of what it might be predict different sorts of behavior for the</p>
<p>evolution of the universe.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been measuring the evolution of the universe now.</p>
<p>And the data appear to agree with the predictions of a constant density vacuum energy, a zero</p>
<p>point energy.</p>
<p>But one can&rsquo;t prove that that&rsquo;s what it is because one would have to show that the measured</p>
<p>numbers agree with the predictions to an arbitrary number of decimal places.</p>
<p>And of course, even if you&rsquo;ve got 8, 9, 10, 12 decimal places, what if in the 13th one,</p>
<p>the measurements significantly differ from the prediction?</p>
<p>Then the dark energy isn&rsquo;t this vacuum state, ground state energy of the vacuum.</p>
<p>And so then it could be some sort of a field, some sort of a new energy, a little bit like</p>
<p>light, like electromagnetism, but very different from light, that fills space.</p>
<p>And that type of energy could in principle change in the distant future.</p>
<p>It could become gravitationally attractive for all we know.</p>
<p>There is a historical precedent to that, and that is that the inflation with which the</p>
<p>universe began when the universe was just a tiny blink of an eye old, a trillionth of</p>
<p>a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, the universe went whoosh, it exponentially</p>
<p>expanded.</p>
<p>That dark energy like substance, we call it the inflaton, that which inflated the universe,</p>
<p>later decayed into more or less normal gravitationally attractive matter.</p>
<p>So the exponential early expansion of the universe did transition to a deceleration,</p>
<p>which then dominated the universe for about nine billion years.</p>
<p>And now this small amount of dark energy started causing an acceleration about five billion</p>
<p>years ago.</p>
<p>And whether that will continue or not is something that we&rsquo;d like to answer, but I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that we will anytime soon.</p>
<p>So there could be this interesting field that we don&rsquo;t yet understand that&rsquo;s morphing over</p>
<p>time, that&rsquo;s changing the way the universe is expanding.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s funny that you were thinking through this rigorously like an experimentalist.</p>
<p>But what about like the fundamental physics of dark energy?</p>
<p>Is there any understanding of what the heck it is, or is this the kind of the god of the</p>
<p>gaps or the field of the gaps?</p>
<p>So like there must be something there because of what we&rsquo;re observing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much a person who believes that there&rsquo;s always a cause, you know, there are no miracles</p>
<p>of a supernatural nature, okay?</p>
<p>So I mean, there are two broad categories, either it&rsquo;s the vacuum zero point energy,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s some sort of a new energy field that pervades the universe.</p>
<p>The latter could change with time, the former, the vacuum energy cannot.</p>
<p>So if it turns out that it&rsquo;s one of these new fields, and there are many, many possibilities,</p>
<p>they go by the name of quintessence and things like that, but there are many categories of</p>
<p>those sorts of fields, we try with data to rule them out by comparing the actual measurements</p>
<p>with the predictions.</p>
<p>And some have been ruled out, but many, many others remain to be tested.</p>
<p>And the data just have to become a lot better before we can rule out most of them and become</p>
<p>reasonably convinced that this is a vacuum energy.</p>
<p>So there is hypotheses for different fields, like with names and stuff like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, generically quintessence, like the Aristotelian fifth essence, but there</p>
<p>are many, many versions of quintessence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s K essence, there&rsquo;s even ideas that, you know, this isn&rsquo;t something from within</p>
<p>this dark energy, but rather, there are a bunch of, say, bubble universes surrounding</p>
<p>our universe, and this whole idea of the multiverse is not some crazy madman type idea anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, real card carrying physicists are seriously considering this possibility</p>
<p>of a multiverse.</p>
<p>And some types of multiverses could have, you know, a bunch of bubbles on the outside,</p>
<p>which gravitationally act outward on our bubble because gravity or gravitons, the quantum</p>
<p>particle that is thought to carry gravity, is thought to traverse the bulk, the space</p>
<p>between these different little bubble membranes and stuff.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s conceivable that these other universes are pulling outward on us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a favored explanation right now, but really, nothing has been ruled out.</p>
<p>No class of models has been ruled out completely.</p>
<p>Certain examples within classes of models have been ruled out.</p>
<p>But in general, I think we still have really a lot to learn about what&rsquo;s causing this</p>
<p>observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe, be it dark energy or some forces</p>
<p>from the outside, or perhaps, you know, I guess it&rsquo;s conceivable that, and sometimes</p>
<p>I wake up in the middle of the night screaming, that dark energy, that which causes the acceleration,</p>
<p>and dark matter, that which causes galaxies and clusters of galaxies to be bound gravitationally</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s not enough visible matter to do so.</p>
<p>Maybe these are our 20th and 21st century Ptolemaic epicycles.</p>
<p>So Ptolemy had a geocentric and Aristotelian view of the world.</p>
<p>Everything goes around Earth.</p>
<p>But in order to explain the backward motion of planets among the stars that happens every</p>
<p>year or two, or sometimes several times a year for Mercury and Venus, you needed the</p>
<p>planets to go around in little circles called epicycles, which themselves then went around</p>
<p>Earth.</p>
<p>And in this part of the epicycle where the planet is going in the direction opposite</p>
<p>to the direction of the overall epicycle, it can appear in projection to be going backward</p>
<p>among the stars, so called retrograde motion.</p>
<p>And it was a brilliant mathematical scheme.</p>
<p>In fact, he could have added epicycles on top of epicycles and reproduced the observed</p>
<p>positions of planets to arbitrary accuracy.</p>
<p>And this is really the beginning of what we now call Fourier analysis, right?</p>
<p>Any periodic function can be represented by a sum of sines and cosines of different periods,</p>
<p>amplitudes, and phases.</p>
<p>So it could have worked arbitrarily well.</p>
<p>But other data show that, in fact, Earth is going around the sun.</p>
<p>So our dark energy and dark matter, just these band aids that we now have to try to explain</p>
<p>the data, but they&rsquo;re just completely wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a possibility as well.</p>
<p>And as a scientist, I have to be open to that possibility as an open minded scientist.</p>
<p>How do you put yourself in the mindset of somebody that, or majority of the scientific</p>
<p>community or majority of people believe that the Earth, everything rotates around Earth?</p>
<p>How do you put yourself in that mindset and then take a leap to propose a model that the</p>
<p>sun is, in fact, at the center of the solar system?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, so that puts us back in the shoes of Copernicus, right, 500 years ago, where</p>
<p>he had this philosophical preference for the sun being the dominant body in what we now</p>
<p>call the solar system.</p>
<p>The observational evidence in terms of the measured positions of planets was not better</p>
<p>explained by the heliocentric, sun centered system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Copernicus saw that the sun is the source of all our light and heat, and</p>
<p>he knew from other studies that it&rsquo;s far away.</p>
<p>So the fact that it appears as big as the moon means it&rsquo;s actually way, way bigger because</p>
<p>even at that time, it was known that the sun is much farther away than the moon.</p>
<p>So he just felt, wow, it&rsquo;s big, it&rsquo;s bright.</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s the central thing?</p>
<p>But the observed positions of planets at the time in the early to mid 16th century under</p>
<p>the heliocentric system was not a better match, at least not a significantly better match</p>
<p>than Ptolemy&rsquo;s system, which was quite accurate and lasted 1500 years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so fascinating to think that the philosophical predispositions that you bring to the table</p>
<p>are essential.</p>
<p>So like you have to have a young person come along that has a weird infatuation with the</p>
<p>sun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That like almost philosophically is like however their upbringing is, they&rsquo;re more ready for</p>
<p>whatever the more the simpler answer is.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad from an individual descendant of eight perspective because then that means</p>
<p>like me, you as a scientist, you&rsquo;re stuck with whatever the heck philosophies you brought</p>
<p>to the table and you might be almost completely unable to think outside this particular box</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m saying that, you know, as an objective scientist, one needs to have</p>
<p>an open mind to crazy sounding new ideas.</p>
<p>And even Copernicus was very much a man of his time and dedicated his work to the Pope.</p>
<p>He still used circular orbits.</p>
<p>The sun was a little bit off center, it turns out, and a slightly off center circle looks</p>
<p>like a slightly eccentric elliptical orbit.</p>
<p>So then when Kepler, in fact, showed that the orbits are actually in general ellipses,</p>
<p>not circles, the reason that he needed Tuco Brahe&rsquo;s really great data to show that distinction</p>
<p>was that a slightly off center circle is not much different from a slightly eccentric ellipse.</p>
<p>And so there wasn&rsquo;t much difference between Kepler&rsquo;s view and Copernicus&rsquo;s view and Kepler</p>
<p>needed the better data, Tuco Brahe&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, again, a great example of science and observations and experiments working together</p>
<p>with hypotheses and they kind of bounce off each other.</p>
<p>They play off of each other and you continually need more observations.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until Galileo&rsquo;s work around 1610 that actual evidence for the heliocentric</p>
<p>hypothesis emerged.</p>
<p>It came in the form of Venus, the planet Venus, going through all of the possible phases from</p>
<p>new to crescent to quarter to gibbous to full to waning gibbous, third quarter waning crescent,</p>
<p>and then new again.</p>
<p>It turns out in the Ptolemaic system with Venus between Earth and the sun, but always</p>
<p>roughly in the direction of the sun, you could only get the new and crescent phases of Venus.</p>
<p>But the observations showed a full set of phases.</p>
<p>And moreover, when Venus was gibbous or full, that meant it was on the far side of the sun.</p>
<p>That meant it was farther from Earth than when it&rsquo;s crescent, so it should appear smaller</p>
<p>and indeed it did.</p>
<p>So that was the nail in the coffin in a sense.</p>
<p>And then Galileo&rsquo;s other great observation was that Jupiter has moons going around it,</p>
<p>the four Galilean satellites.</p>
<p>And even though Jupiter moves through space, so too do the moons go with it.</p>
<p>So first of all, Earth is not the only thing that has other things going around it.</p>
<p>And secondly, Earth could be moving as Jupiter does and things would move with it.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t fly off the surface and our moon wouldn&rsquo;t be left behind and all this kind</p>
<p>of stuff.</p>
<p>So that was a big breakthrough as well, but it wasn&rsquo;t as definitive in my opinion as</p>
<p>the phases of Venus.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m revealing my ignorance, but I didn&rsquo;t realize how much data they were working</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t Einstein or Freud thinking in theories.</p>
<p>It was a lot of data and you&rsquo;re playing with it and seeing how to make sense of it.</p>
<p>So it isn&rsquo;t just coming up with completely abstract thought experiments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s looking at the data.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And you look at Newton&rsquo;s great work, right?</p>
<p>The Principia, it was based in part on Galileo&rsquo;s observations of balls rolling down inclined</p>
<p>planes, supposedly falling off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but that&rsquo;s probably apocryphal.</p>
<p>In any case, the Roman Catholic Church did history a favor, not that I&rsquo;m condoning them,</p>
<p>but they placed Galileo under house arrest and that gave Galileo time to publish, to</p>
<p>assemble and publish the results of his experiments that he had done decades earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear he would have had time to do that, had he not been under house arrest.</p>
<p>And so Newton, of course, very much used Galileo&rsquo;s observations.</p>
<p>Let me ask the old Russian overly philosophical question about death.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking about the expanding universe.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>How do you think human civilization will come to an end if we avoid the near term issues</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having?</p>
<p>Will it be our sun burning out?</p>
<p>Will it be comets?</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Will it be, what is it?</p>
<p>Do you think we have a shot at reaching the heat death of the universe?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to leave out the anthropogenic causes of our potential destruction, which</p>
<p>I actually think are greater than the celestial causes.</p>
<p>So if we get lucky and intelligent, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So no way will we as humans reach the heat death of the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceivable that machines, which I think will be our evolutionary descendants, might</p>
<p>reach that, although even they will have less and less energy with which to work as time</p>
<p>progresses because eventually even the lowest mass stars burn out, although it takes them</p>
<p>trillions of years to do so.</p>
<p>So the point is that certainly on Earth, there are other celestial threats, existential threats,</p>
<p>comets, exploding stars, the sun burning out.</p>
<p>So we will definitely need to move away from our solar system to other solar systems.</p>
<p>And then the question is, can they keep on propagating to other planetary systems sufficiently</p>
<p>long?</p>
<p>In our own solar system, the sun burning out is not the immediate existential threat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll happen in about five billion years when it becomes a red giant, although I should</p>
<p>hasten to add that within the next one or two billion years, the sun will have brightened</p>
<p>enough that unless there are compensatory atmospheric changes, the oceans will evaporate</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to need much less carbon dioxide for the temperatures to be maintained roughly</p>
<p>at their present temperature, and plants wouldn&rsquo;t like that very much.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t lower the carbon dioxide content too much.</p>
<p>So within one or two billion years, probably the oceans will evaporate away.</p>
<p>But on a sooner time scale than that, I would say an asteroid collision leading to a potential</p>
<p>mass extinction, or at least an extinction of complex beings such as ourselves that require</p>
<p>quite special conditions unlike cockroaches and amoebas to survive, one of these civilization</p>
<p>changing asteroids is only one kilometer or so in diameter and bigger, and a true mass</p>
<p>extinction event is 10 kilometers or larger.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s true that we can find and track the orbits of asteroids that might be headed toward</p>
<p>Earth, and if we find them 50 or 100 years before they impact us, then clever applied</p>
<p>physicists and engineers can figure out ways to deflect them.</p>
<p>But at some point, some comet will come in from the deep freeze of the solar system,</p>
<p>and there we have very little warning, months to a year.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the deep freeze, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>The deep freeze is sort of out beyond Neptune.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this thing called the Kuiper Belt, and it consists of a bunch of dirty ice balls</p>
<p>or icy dirt balls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the source of the comets that occasionally come close to the Sun.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s an even bigger area called the Scattered Disk, which is sort of a big</p>
<p>doughnut surrounding the solar system way out there from which other comets come.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the Oort Cloud, W O O R T after Jan Oort, a Dutch astrophysicist, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the better part of a light year away from the Sun, so a good fraction of the distance</p>
<p>to the nearest star, but that&rsquo;s like a trillion or 10 trillion comet like objects that occasionally</p>
<p>get disturbed by a passing star or whatever, and most of them go flying out of the solar</p>
<p>system, but some go toward the Sun, and they come in with little warning.</p>
<p>By the time we can see them, they&rsquo;re only a year or two away from us.</p>
<p>And moreover, not only is it hard to determine their trajectories sufficiently accurately</p>
<p>to know whether they&rsquo;ll hit a tiny thing like Earth, but outgassing from the comet of gases</p>
<p>when the ices sublimate, that outgassing can change the trajectory just because of conservation</p>
<p>of momentum, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the rocket effect.</p>
<p>Gases go out in one direction, the object moves in the other direction.</p>
<p>And so since we can&rsquo;t predict how much outgassing there will be and in exactly what direction</p>
<p>because these things are tumbling and rotating and stuff, it&rsquo;s hard to predict the trajectory</p>
<p>with sufficient accuracy to know that it will hit.</p>
<p>And you certainly don&rsquo;t want to deflect a comet that would have missed but you thought</p>
<p>it was going to hit and end up having it hit.</p>
<p>That would be like the ultimate Charlie Brown goat instead of trying to be the hero, right?</p>
<p>He ended up being the goat.</p>
<p>What would you do if it seemed like in a matter of months that there is some nonzero probability,</p>
<p>maybe a high probability that there will be a collision?</p>
<p>So from a scientific perspective, from an engineering perspective, I imagine you would</p>
<p>actually be in the room of people deciding what to do.</p>
<p>What uh, philosophically too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough one, right?</p>
<p>Because if you only have a few months, that&rsquo;s not much time in which to deflect it.</p>
<p>Early detection and early action are key because when it&rsquo;s far away, you only have to deflect</p>
<p>it by a tiny little angle.</p>
<p>And then by the time it reaches us, the perpendicular motion is big enough to miss Earth.</p>
<p>All you need is one radius or one diameter of the Earth, right?</p>
<p>That actually means that all you would need to do is slow it down so it arrives four minutes</p>
<p>later or speed it up so it arrives four minutes earlier and Earth will have moved through</p>
<p>one radius in that time.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t take much.</p>
<p>But you can imagine if a thing is about to hit you, you have to deflect it 90 degrees</p>
<p>or more, right?</p>
<p>You know, and you don&rsquo;t have much time to do so and you have to slow it down or speed</p>
<p>it up a lot if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to do to it.</p>
<p>And so decades is sufficient time, but months is not sufficient time.</p>
<p>So at that point, I would think the name of the game would be to try to predict where</p>
<p>it would hit.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s in a heavily populated region, try to start an orderly evacuation perhaps.</p>
<p>But you know, that might cause just so much panic that I&rsquo;m, how would you do with New</p>
<p>York City or Los Angeles or something like that, right?</p>
<p>I might have a different opinion a year ago, I&rsquo;m a bit disheartened by, you know, in the</p>
<p>movies, there&rsquo;s always extreme competence from the government.</p>
<p>Competence, yeah.</p>
<p>But we expect extreme incompetence, if anything, right?</p>
<p>Yes, no.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m quite disappointed.</p>
<p>But sort of from a medical perspective, I think you&rsquo;re saying there, and a scientific</p>
<p>one, it&rsquo;s almost better to get better and better, maybe telescopes and data collection</p>
<p>to be able to predict the movement of these things, or like come up with totally new technologies</p>
<p>that you can imagine actually sending out, like probes out there to be able to sort of</p>
<p>almost have little finger sensors throughout our solar system to be able to detect stuff.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, monitoring the asteroid belt is very important and 99% of the so called near earth</p>
<p>objects ultimately come from the asteroid belt.</p>
<p>And so there we can track the trajectories and even if there&rsquo;s a close encounter between</p>
<p>two asteroids which deflects one of them toward earth, it&rsquo;s unlikely to be on a collision</p>
<p>course with earth in the immediate future, it&rsquo;s more like tens of years, so that gives</p>
<p>us time.</p>
<p>But we would need to improve our ability to detect the objects that come in from a great</p>
<p>distance.</p>
<p>And those are much rarer, the comets come in, 1% of the collisions perhaps are with</p>
<p>comets that come in without any warning hardly.</p>
<p>So that might be more like a billion or two billion years before one of those hits us.</p>
<p>So maybe we have to worry about the sun getting brighter on that time scale.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s the possibility that a star will explode near us in the next couple of</p>
<p>billion years.</p>
<p>But over the course of the history of life on earth, the estimates are that maybe only</p>
<p>one of the mass extinctions was caused by a star blowing up in particular, a special</p>
<p>kind called a gamma ray burst, and I think it&rsquo;s the Ordovician‚ÄìSilurian extinction</p>
<p>420 or so, 440 million years ago that is speculated to have come from one of these particular</p>
<p>types of exploding stars called gamma ray bursts.</p>
<p>But even there, the evidence is circumstantial.</p>
<p>So those kinds of existential threats are reasonably rare.</p>
<p>The greater danger I think is civilization changing events where it&rsquo;s a much smaller</p>
<p>asteroid, which those are harder to detect, or a giant solar flare that shorts out the</p>
<p>grid in all of North America, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Now, astronomers are monitoring the sun 24 seven with various satellites and we can tell</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a flare or a coronal mass ejection and we can tell that in a day or two, a giant</p>
<p>bundle of energetic particles will arrive and twang the magnetic field of earth and</p>
<p>send all kinds of currents through long distance power lines and that&rsquo;s what shorts out the</p>
<p>transformers and transformers are expensive and hard to replace and hard to transport</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So if we can warn the power companies and they can shut down the grid before the big</p>
<p>bundle of particle hits, then we will have mitigated much of this.</p>
<p>Now for a big enough bundle of particles, you can get short circuits even over small</p>
<p>distance scales, so not everything will be saved, but at least the whole grid might not</p>
<p>go out.</p>
<p>So again, astronomers, I like to say, support your local astronomer, they may help someday</p>
<p>save humanity by telling the power companies to shut down the grid, finding the asteroid</p>
<p>50 or 100 years before it hits, then having clever physicists and engineers deflect it.</p>
<p>So many of these cosmic threats, cosmic existential threats, we can actually predict and do something</p>
<p>about or observe before they hit and do something about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s terrifying to think that people would listen to this conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you listen to Bill Gates talk about pandemics in his Ted talk a few years</p>
<p>ago and realizing we should have supported our local astronomer more.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s more because as I said, I actually think human induced</p>
<p>threats or things that occur naturally on earth, either a natural pandemic or perhaps</p>
<p>a bioengineering type pandemic or something like a super volcano.</p>
<p>There was one event towed by I think it was 70 plus thousand years ago that caused a gigantic</p>
<p>decrease in temperatures on earth because it sent up so much soot that it blocked the</p>
<p>sun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the nuclear winter type disaster scenario that some people including Carl Sagan talked</p>
<p>about decades ago.</p>
<p>What we can see in the history of volcanic eruptions even more recently in the 19th century,</p>
<p>Tambora and other ones, you look at the record and you see rather large dips in temperature</p>
<p>associated with massive volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>Well these super volcanoes, one of which by the way exists under Yellowstone in the central</p>
<p>US, it&rsquo;s not just one or two states, it&rsquo;s a gigantic region and there&rsquo;s controversy</p>
<p>as to whether it&rsquo;s likely to blow anytime in the next 100,000 years or so.</p>
<p>But that would be perhaps not a mass extinction or perhaps not a complete existential threat</p>
<p>because you have to get rid of the very last humans for that, but at least getting rid</p>
<p>of killing off so many humans, truly billions and billions of humans.</p>
<p>There have been ones tens of thousands of years ago including this one, Toba I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called, where it&rsquo;s estimated that the human population was down to 10,000 or 5,000</p>
<p>individuals, something like that.</p>
<p>If you have a 15 degree drop in temperature over quite a short time, it&rsquo;s not clear that</p>
<p>even with today&rsquo;s advanced technology, we would be able to adequately respond at least</p>
<p>for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>Maybe some would be in these underground caves where you&rsquo;d keep the president and a bunch</p>
<p>of other important people, but the typical person is not going to be protected when all</p>
<p>of agriculture is cut off.</p>
<p>It could be hundreds of millions or billions of people starving to death.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t all die immediately, but they use up their supplies or again, this electrical</p>
<p>grid.</p>
<p>First of toilet paper.</p>
<p>Dash that toilet paper or the electrical grid.</p>
<p>Imagine North America without power for a year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve become so dependent, we&rsquo;re no longer the cave people.</p>
<p>They would do just fine.</p>
<p>What do they care about the electrical grid?</p>
<p>What do they care about agriculture, their hunters and gatherers?</p>
<p>But we now have become so used to our way of life that the only real survivors would</p>
<p>be those rugged individualists who live somewhere out in the forest or in a cave somewhere,</p>
<p>completely independent of anyone else.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Recently I recommended, it&rsquo;s totally new to me, this kind of survivalist folks, but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a few shows.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of shows of those, but I saw one on Netflix and I started watching them</p>
<p>and they make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>They reveal to you how dependent we are on all aspects of this beautiful systems we human</p>
<p>have built and how fragile they are.</p>
<p>Incredibly fragile.</p>
<p>And this whole conversation is making me realize how lucky we are.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re incredibly lucky, but we&rsquo;ve set ourselves up to be very, very fragile and</p>
<p>we are intrinsically complex biological creatures that except for the fact that we have brains</p>
<p>and minds with which we can try to prevent some of these things or respond to them.</p>
<p>We as a living organism require quite a narrow set of conditions in order to survive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not cockroaches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to survive a nuclear war.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re kind of this beautiful dance between, we&rsquo;ve been talking about astronomy, that astronomy,</p>
<p>the stars like inspires everybody and at the same time, there&rsquo;s this pragmatic aspect that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And so I see space exploration as the same kind of way that it&rsquo;s reaching out to other</p>
<p>planets, reaching out to the stars, this really beautiful idea.</p>
<p>But if you listen to somebody like Elon Musk, he talks about space exploration as very pragmatic.</p>
<p>Like we have to be, he has this ridiculous way of sounding like an engineer about it,</p>
<p>which is like, it&rsquo;s obvious we need to become a multi planetary species if we were to survive</p>
<p>long term.</p>
<p>So maybe both philosophically in terms of beauty and in terms of practical, what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>thoughts on space exploration, on the challenges of it, on how much we should be investing</p>
<p>in it and on a personal level, like how excited you are by the possibility of going to Mars,</p>
<p>colonizing Mars and maybe going outside the solar system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, great question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack there of course.</p>
<p>Humans are by their very nature explorers, pioneers.</p>
<p>They want to go out, climb the next mountain, see what&rsquo;s behind it, explore the option depths,</p>
<p>explore space.</p>
<p>This is our destiny to go out there.</p>
<p>And of course, from a pragmatic perspective, yes, we need to plant our seeds elsewhere</p>
<p>really because things could go wrong here on Earth.</p>
<p>Now some people say that&rsquo;s an excuse to not take care of our planet.</p>
<p>Well, we say we&rsquo;re elsewhere and so we don&rsquo;t have to take good care of our planet.</p>
<p>No, we should take the best possible care of our planet.</p>
<p>We should be cognizant of the potential impact of what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s prudent to have us be elsewhere as well.</p>
<p>So in that regard, I actually agree with Elon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be good to be on Mars.</p>
<p>That would be yet another place for us from which to explore further.</p>
<p>Would that be a good next step?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a good next step.</p>
<p>I happen to disagree with him as to how quickly it will happen.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s very optimistic.</p>
<p>Now you need visionary people like Elon to get people going and to inspire them.</p>
<p>I mean, look at the success he&rsquo;s had with multiple companies.</p>
<p>So maybe he gives this very optimistic timeline in order to be inspirational to those who</p>
<p>are going out there.</p>
<p>And certainly his success with the rocket that is reusable because it landed upright</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a game changer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like every time you flew from San Francisco to Los Angeles, you discard</p>
<p>the airplane, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s crazy, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a game changer.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, the timescale over which he thinks that there could be a real thriving</p>
<p>colony on Mars, I think is far too optimistic.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the biggest challenges to you?</p>
<p>One is just getting rockets, not rockets, but people out there and two is the colonization.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts about this, the challenges of this kind of prospect?</p>
<p>Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t thought about it in great detail other than recognizing that Mars is</p>
<p>a harsh environment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have much of an atmosphere there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got less than a percent of Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d need to build some sort of a dome right away, right?</p>
<p>And that would take time.</p>
<p>You need to melt the water that&rsquo;s in the permafrost or have canals dug from which you transport</p>
<p>it from the polar ice caps.</p>
<p>You know, I was reading recently in terms of like, what&rsquo;s the most efficient source</p>
<p>of nutrition for humans that were to live on Mars?</p>
<p>And people should look into this, but it turns out to be insects.</p>
<p>Insects.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you want, you want to build giant colonies of insects and just be eating them.</p>
<p>Yeah, insects have a lot of protein.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of protein.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re easy to grow.</p>
<p>Like you can think of them as farming.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not going to be as easy as growing a whole plot of potatoes like in the movie</p>
<p>The Martian, you know, or something, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be that easy.</p>
<p>But you know, so there&rsquo;s this thin atmosphere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got the wrong composition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>There are these violent dust storms.</p>
<p>The temperatures are generally cold.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;d need to do a lot of things.</p>
<p>You need to terraform it basically in order to make it nicely livable without some dome</p>
<p>surrounding you.</p>
<p>And if you, and if you insist on a dome, well, that&rsquo;s not going to house that many people,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You know, so let&rsquo;s look, let&rsquo;s look briefly then, you know, we&rsquo;re looking for a new apartment</p>
<p>to move into.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look outside the solar system.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve spoken about exoplanets as well?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s possible homes out there for us outside of our solar system?</p>
<p>There are lots and lots of homes.</p>
<p>Possible homes.</p>
<p>There are, there&rsquo;s a planetary system around nearly every star you see in the sky.</p>
<p>And one in five of those is thought to have a roughly Earth like planet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a relatively new discovery.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new discovery.</p>
<p>I mean, the Kepler satellite, which was flying around above Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere was able to</p>
<p>monitor the brightness of stars with exquisite detail.</p>
<p>And they could detect planets crossing the line of sight between us and the star, thereby</p>
<p>dimming its light for a short time ever so slightly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So there are now thousands and thousands of these exoplanet candidates of which something</p>
<p>like 90% are probably genuine exoplanets.</p>
<p>And you have to remember that only about 1% of stars have their planetary system oriented</p>
<p>edge on to your line of sight, which is what you need for this transit method to work,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Your planetary angle won&rsquo;t work and certainly perpendicular to your line of sight.</p>
<p>That is in the plane of the sky won&rsquo;t work because the planet is orbiting the star and</p>
<p>never crossing your line of sight.</p>
<p>So the fact that they found planets orbiting about 1% of the stars that they looked at</p>
<p>in this field of 150 plus thousand stars, they found planets around 1%.</p>
<p>You then multiply by the inverse of 1%, which is 1% is about what the fraction of the stars</p>
<p>that have their planetary system oriented the right way.</p>
<p>And that already back of the envelope calculation tells you that of order 50 to 100% of all</p>
<p>stars have planets.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ve been finding these Earth like planets, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there are many potential homes.</p>
<p>The problem is getting there.</p>
<p>So then a typical bright star, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, maybe not a typical</p>
<p>bright star, but it&rsquo;s 8.7 light years away.</p>
<p>So that means the light took 8.7 years to reach us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing it as it was about nine years ago.</p>
<p>So then you ask how long would a rocket take to get there at Earth&rsquo;s escape speed, which</p>
<p>is 11 kilometers per second.</p>
<p>And it turns out it&rsquo;s about a quarter of a million years.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s 10,000 generations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a generation of humans is 25 years.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d need this colony of people that is able to sustain itself, all their food, all</p>
<p>their waste disposal, all their water, all the recycling of everything.</p>
<p>For 10,000 generations, they have to commit themselves to living on this vehicle.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see it happening.</p>
<p>What I see potentially happening, if we avoid self destruction, intentional or unintentional</p>
<p>here on Earth, is that machines will do it, robots that can essentially hibernate.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to do much of anything for a long, long time as they&rsquo;re traveling.</p>
<p>And moreover, if some energetic charged particle, some cosmic ray, hits the circuitry, it fixes</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>Machines can do this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>You just tell the thing, fix yourself basically.</p>
<p>And then when you land on the planet, start producing copies of yourself, initially from</p>
<p>materials that were perhaps sent, or you just have a bunch of copies there.</p>
<p>And then they set up factories with which to do this.</p>
<p>This is very, very futuristic, but it&rsquo;s much more feasible, I think, than sending flesh</p>
<p>and blood over interstellar distances, a quarter of a million years to even the nearest stars.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re subject to all kinds of charged particles and radiation.</p>
<p>You have to shield yourself really well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s by the way, one of the problems of going to Mars is that it&rsquo;s not a three day</p>
<p>journey like going to the moon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re out there for the better part of a year or two, and you&rsquo;re exposed to lots of</p>
<p>radiation, which typically doesn&rsquo;t do well with living tissue, or living tissue doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do well with the radiation.</p>
<p>And the hope is that the robots, the AI systems might be able to carry the fire of consciousness,</p>
<p>whatever makes us humans, like a little drop of whatever makes us humans so special, not</p>
<p>to be too poetic about it.</p>
<p>No, but I like being poetic about it because it&rsquo;s an amazing question.</p>
<p>Is there something beyond just the bits, the ones and zeros to us?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I like to think that there isn&rsquo;t anything, and that how beautiful it is that our thoughts,</p>
<p>our emotions, our feelings, our compassion all come from these ones and zeros, right?</p>
<p>That to me actually is a beautiful thought.</p>
<p>And the idea that machines, silicon based life effectively, could be our natural evolutionary</p>
<p>descendants, not from a DNA perspective, but they are our creations and they then carry</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>That to me is a beautiful thought in some ways, but others find it to be a horrific</p>
<p>thought.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s exciting to you.</p>
<p>It is exciting to me as well because to me, from a purely an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s impossible to create, like whatever systems we create that take over</p>
<p>the world, it&rsquo;s impossible for me to imagine that those systems will not carry some aspect</p>
<p>of what makes humans beautiful.</p>
<p>So like a lot of people have these kind of paperclip ideas that we&rsquo;ll build machines</p>
<p>that are cold inside or philosophers call them zombies.</p>
<p>That naturally the systems that will out compete us on this earth will be cold and non conscious,</p>
<p>not capable of all the human emotions and empathy and compassion and love and hate,</p>
<p>the beautiful mix of what makes us human.</p>
<p>But to me, intelligence requires all of that.</p>
<p>So in order to out compete humans, you better be good at the full picture.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So artificial general intelligence, in my view, encompasses a lot of these attributes</p>
<p>that you just talked about, curiosity, inquisitiveness, you know, right?</p>
<p>It might look very different than us humans, but it will have some of the magic.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll also be much more able to survive the onslaught of existential threats that</p>
<p>either we bring upon ourselves or don&rsquo;t anticipate here on earth, or that occasionally come from</p>
<p>beyond and there&rsquo;s nothing much we can do about a supernova explosion that just suddenly</p>
<p>goes off.</p>
<p>And really, if we want to move to other planets outside our solar system, I think realistically</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a much better option than thinking that humans will actually make these gigantic</p>
<p>journeys.</p>
<p>And, you know, then I do this calculation for my class, you know, Einstein&rsquo;s special</p>
<p>theory of relativity says that you can do it in a short amount of time in your own frame</p>
<p>of reference if you go close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>But then you bring in E equals MC squared and you figure out how much energy it takes</p>
<p>to get you accelerated to close enough to the speed of light to make the time scales</p>
<p>short in your own frame of reference.</p>
<p>And the amount of energy is just unfathomable, right?</p>
<p>We can do it at the Large Hadron Collider with protons, you know, we can accelerate</p>
<p>them to 99.9999% of the speed of light, but that&rsquo;s just a proton.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gazillions of protons, okay?</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t even count the rocket that would carry us, the payload.</p>
<p>And you would need to either store the fuel in the rocket, which then requires even more</p>
<p>mass for the rocket or collect fuel along the way, which, you know, is difficult.</p>
<p>And so getting close to the speed of light, I think, is not an option either other than</p>
<p>for a little tiny thing like, you know, Yuri Milner and others are thinking about this,</p>
<p>the Starshot project where they&rsquo;ll send a little tiny camera to Alpha Centauri 4.2 light</p>
<p>years away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll zip past it, take a picture of the exoplanets that we know, orbit that three</p>
<p>or more star system and say hello real quick.</p>
<p>Say hello real quickly and then send the images back to us, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a tiny little thing, right?</p>
<p>Maybe you can accelerate that to, they&rsquo;re hoping, 20% of the speed of light with a whole</p>
<p>bunch of high powered lasers aimed at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear that other countries will allow us to do that, by the way, but that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>forward looking thought.</p>
<p>I mean, I very much support the idea, but there&rsquo;s a big difference between sending a</p>
<p>little tiny camera and sending a payload of people with equipment that could then mine</p>
<p>the resources on the exoplanet that they reach and then go forth and multiply, right?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about the big galactic things and how we might be able to leverage them</p>
<p>to travel fast.</p>
<p>I know this is a little bit science fiction, but, you know, ideas of wormholes and ideas</p>
<p>at the edge of black holes that reveal to us that this fabric of space time could be</p>
<p>messed with, perhaps.</p>
<p>Is that at all an interesting thing for you?</p>
<p>I mean, in looking out at the universe and studying it as you have, is that also a possible,</p>
<p>like a dream for you that we might be able to find clues how we can actually use it to</p>
<p>improve our transportation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thought.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly excited by the potential physics that suggests this kind of faster than light</p>
<p>travel effectively or, you know, cutting the distance to make it very, very short through</p>
<p>a wormhole or something like that.</p>
<p>Possible?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Well, you know, call me not very imaginative, but based on today&rsquo;s knowledge of physics,</p>
<p>which I realize, you know, people have gone down that rabbit hole and, you know, a century</p>
<p>ago, Lord Kelvin, one of the greatest physicists of all time, said that all of fundamental</p>
<p>physics is done, the rest is just engineering, and guess what?</p>
<p>Then came special relativity, quantum physics, general relativity, how wrong he was.</p>
<p>So let me not be another Lord Kelvin.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think we know a lot more now about what we know and what we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and what the physical limitations are.</p>
<p>And to me, most of these schemes, if not all of them, seem very farfetched, if not impossible.</p>
<p>So travel through wormholes, for example, you know, it appears that for a non rotating</p>
<p>black hole, that&rsquo;s just a complete no go because the singularity is a point like singularity</p>
<p>and you have to reach it to traverse the wormhole and you get squished by the singularity, okay?</p>
<p>Now for a rotating black hole, it turns out there is a way to pass through the event horizon,</p>
<p>the boundary of the black hole, and avoid the singularity and go out the other side</p>
<p>or even traverse the donut hole like singularity.</p>
<p>In the case of a rotating black hole, it&rsquo;s a ring singularity.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s actually two theoretical ways you could get through a rotating black hole or</p>
<p>a charged black hole, not that we expect charged black holes to exist in nature because they</p>
<p>would quickly bring in the opposite charge so as to neutralize themselves.</p>
<p>But rotating black holes, definitely a reality.</p>
<p>We now have good evidence for them.</p>
<p>Do they have traversable wormholes?</p>
<p>Probably not because it&rsquo;s still the case that when you go in, you go in with so much energy</p>
<p>that it either squeezes the wormhole shut or you encounter a whole bunch of incoming</p>
<p>and outgoing energy that vaporizes you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the mass inflation instability, and it just sort of vaporizes you.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you could imagine, well, you&rsquo;re in some vapor form, but if you make it through,</p>
<p>maybe you could reform or something.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still information.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s still information.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scrambled information, but there&rsquo;s a way maybe of bringing it back, right?</p>
<p>But then the thing that really bothers me is that as soon as you have this possibility</p>
<p>of traversal of a wormhole, you have to come to grips with a fundamental problem, and that</p>
<p>is that you could come back to your universe at a time prior to your leaving, and you could</p>
<p>essentially prevent your grandparents from ever meeting.</p>
<p>This is called the grandfather paradox, right?</p>
<p>And if they never met, and if your parents were never born, and if you were never born,</p>
<p>how would you have made the journey to prevent the history from allowing you to exist, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a violation of causality, of cause and effect.</p>
<p>Now physicists such as myself take causality violation very, very seriously.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never seen it.</p>
<p>You took a stand.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s one of these back to the future type movies, right?</p>
<p>And you have to work things out in such a way that you don&rsquo;t mess things up, right?</p>
<p>Some people say that, well, you come back to the universe, but you come back in such</p>
<p>a way that you cannot affect your journey.</p>
<p>But then that seems kind of contrived to me.</p>
<p>Or some say that you end up in a different universe, and this also goes into the many</p>
<p>different types of the multiverse hypothesis and the many worlds interpretation and all</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s not the universe from which you left, right?</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t come back to the universe from which you left.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re not really going back in time to the same universe, and you&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>going forward in time necessarily then to the same universe, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ending up in some other universe.</p>
<p>So what have you achieved, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve traveled.</p>
<p>You ended up in a different place than you started in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this idea, the Alcubierre drive, where you warp space time in front</p>
<p>of you so as to greatly reduce the distance, and you can expand the space time behind you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re sort of riding a wave through space time.</p>
<p>But the problem I see with that, beyond the practical difficulties and the energy requirements,</p>
<p>and by the way, how do you get out of this bubble through which you&rsquo;re riding this wave</p>
<p>of space time?</p>
<p>And Miguel Alcubierre acknowledged all these things.</p>
<p>He said this is purely theoretical, fanciful, and all that.</p>
<p>But a fundamental problem I see is that you&rsquo;d have to get to those places in front of you</p>
<p>so as to change the shape of space time so as to make the journey quickly.</p>
<p>But to get there, you got there in the normal way at a speed considerably less than that</p>
<p>of light.</p>
<p>So in a sense, you haven&rsquo;t saved any time, right?</p>
<p>You might as well have just taken that journey and gotten to where you were going, right?</p>
<p>What have you done?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you snap your fingers and say, okay, let that space there be compressed,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll make it over to Alpha Centauri in the next month.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t snap your fingers and do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, we&rsquo;re sort of assuming that we can fix all the biological stuff that requires</p>
<p>for humans to persist through that whole process, because ultimately, it might go down to just</p>
<p>extending the life of the human in some form, whether it&rsquo;s through the robot, through the</p>
<p>digital form, or actually just figuring out genetically how to live forever, because that</p>
<p>journey that you mentioned, the long journey, might be different if somehow our understanding</p>
<p>of genetics, of our understanding of our own biology, all that kind of stuff, that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>trajectory that possibly&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, right.</p>
<p>If you could put us into some sort of suspended animation, hibernation or something, and greatly</p>
<p>increase the lifetime, and so these 10,000 generations I talked about, what do they care?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one generation, and they&rsquo;re asleep, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long nap.</p>
<p>So then you can do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still not easy, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve got some big old huge colony, and that just through E equals MC squared,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of mass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to accelerate.</p>
<p>The Newtonian kinetic energy is gigantic, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re still not home free, but at least you&rsquo;re not trying to do it in a short amount</p>
<p>of clock time, right?</p>
<p>Which if you look at E equals MC squared, requires truly unfathomable amounts of energy,</p>
<p>because the energy is your rest mass, M naught C squared, divided by the square root of one</p>
<p>minus V squared over C squared.</p>
<p>And if your listeners want to just sort of stick into their pocket calculator, as V over</p>
<p>C approaches one, that one over the square root of one minus V squared over C squared</p>
<p>approaches infinity.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to do it in zero time, you&rsquo;d need an infinite amount of energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically why you can&rsquo;t reach, let alone exceed the speed of light, for a particle</p>
<p>moving through a preexisting space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that it takes an infinite amount of energy to do so.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s talking about us going somewhere.</p>
<p>What about, one of the things that inspires a lot of folks, including myself, is the possibility</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s other, that this conversation is happening on another planet in different</p>
<p>forms with intelligent life forms.</p>
<p>So first we could start, as a cosmologist, what&rsquo;s your intuition about whether there</p>
<p>is or isn&rsquo;t intelligent life out there?</p>
<p>Outside of our own?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say I&rsquo;m one of the pessimists in that I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the only ones in the observable universe, which goes out, you know, roughly 14 billion</p>
<p>years in light travel time and more like, you know, 46 billion years when you take into</p>
<p>account the expansion of space.</p>
<p>So the diameter of our observable universe is something like, you know, 90, 92 billion</p>
<p>light years.</p>
<p>That encompasses, you know, a hundred billion to a trillion galaxies with, you know, a hundred</p>
<p>billion stars each.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re talking about something like 10 to the 22nd, 10 to the 23rd power stars</p>
<p>and roughly an equal number of Earth like planets and so on.</p>
<p>So there may well be other intelligent life.</p>
<p>But your sense is our galaxy is not teeming with life.</p>
<p>Yeah, our galaxy, our Milky Way galaxy with several hundred billion stars and potentially</p>
<p>habitable planets is not teeming with intelligent life.</p>
<p>Intelligent.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t, well, I&rsquo;ll get to the primitive life, the bacteria in a moment, but, you know,</p>
<p>we may well be the only ones in our Milky Way galaxy, at most a handful, I&rsquo;d say, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably side with the school of thought that suggests we&rsquo;re the only ones in our own</p>
<p>galaxy, just because I don&rsquo;t see human intelligence as being a natural evolutionary path for life.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a number of arguments.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s been more than 10 billion species of life on Earth in its history.</p>
<p>Everything has approached our level of intelligence and mechanical ability and curiosity.</p>
<p>You know, whales and dolphins appear to be reasonably intelligent, but there&rsquo;s no evidence</p>
<p>that they can think abstract thoughts that they&rsquo;re curious about the world.</p>
<p>They certainly can&rsquo;t build machines with which to study the world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one argument.</p>
<p>Secondly, we came about as early hominids only four or five million years ago and as</p>
<p>homo sapiens only about a quarter of a million years ago.</p>
<p>So for the vast majority of the history of life on Earth, an intelligent alien zipping</p>
<p>by Earth would have said there&rsquo;s nothing particularly intelligent or mechanically able on Earth.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it&rsquo;s not clear that our intelligence is a long term evolutionary advantage.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s clear that in the last 100 years, 200 years, we&rsquo;ve improved the lives of hundreds</p>
<p>of millions of people, but at the risk of potentially destroying ourselves either intentionally</p>
<p>or unintentionally or through neglect, as we discussed before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting point, which is it&rsquo;s possible that they&rsquo;re a huge amount of</p>
<p>intelligent civilizations have been born even through our galaxy, but they live very briefly</p>
<p>and they die.</p>
<p>Flash bulbs in the night.</p>
<p>That brings me to the fourth issue and that is the Fermi paradox.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re common, where the hell are they?</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the various UFO reports in Roswell and all that, they just don&rsquo;t meet</p>
<p>the bar.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t clear the bar of scientific evidence in my opinion.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no clear evidence that they&rsquo;ve ever visited us on Earth here.</p>
<p>And SETI has been now, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has been scanning the skies and</p>
<p>true, we&rsquo;ve only looked a couple of hundred light years out and that&rsquo;s a tiny fraction</p>
<p>of the whole galaxy, a tiny fraction of these hundred billion plus stars.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if the galaxy were teaming with life, especially intelligent life, you&rsquo;d expect</p>
<p>some of it to have been far more advanced than ours.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing special about when the industrial revolution started on Earth.</p>
<p>The chemical evolution of our galaxy was such that billions of years ago, nuclear processing</p>
<p>and stars had built up clouds of gas after their explosion that were rich enough in heavy</p>
<p>elements to have formed Earth like planets, even billions of years ago.</p>
<p>So there could be civilizations that are billions of years ahead of ours.</p>
<p>And if you look at the exponential growth of technology among Homo sapiens in the last</p>
<p>couple of hundred years and you just project that forward, I mean, there&rsquo;s no telling what</p>
<p>they could have achieved even in 1000 or 10,000 years, let alone a million or 10 million or</p>
<p>a billion years.</p>
<p>And if they reach this capability of interstellar travel and colonization, then you can show</p>
<p>that within 10 million years or certainly a hundred million years, you can populate</p>
<p>the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>So then you don&rsquo;t have to have tried to detect them beyond a hundred or a thousand light</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>They would already be here.</p>
<p>Do you think as a thought experiment, do you think it&rsquo;s possible that they are already</p>
<p>here, but we humans are so human centric that we&rsquo;re just not like our conception of what</p>
<p>intelligent life looks like is, we don&rsquo;t want to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Like what if trees?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, I guess the, in the form of a question, do you think we&rsquo;ll actually detect intelligent</p>
<p>life if it came to visit us?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, you know, you&rsquo;re an ant crawling around on a sidewalk somewhere and</p>
<p>do you notice the humans wandering around and the empire state building and you know,</p>
<p>rocket ships flying to the moon and all that kind of stuff, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceivable that we haven&rsquo;t detected it and that we&rsquo;re so primitive compared to</p>
<p>them that we&rsquo;re just not able to do so.</p>
<p>Like if you look at dark energy, maybe we call it as a field.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that my own feeling is that in science now through observations and experiments,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve measured so many things and basically we understand a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Fabric of reality.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The fabric of reality, we understand quite well.</p>
<p>And there are a few little things like dark matter and dark energy that may be some sign</p>
<p>of some super intelligence, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know, why would some super intelligence be holding clusters of galaxies together?</p>
<p>Why would they be responsible for accelerating the expansion of the universe?</p>
<p>So the point is, is that through science and applied science and engineering, we understand</p>
<p>so much now that I&rsquo;m not saying we know everything, but we know a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not like there are lots of mysteries flying around there that are</p>
<p>completely outside our level of exploration or understanding.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From a, I would say from, from a mystery perspective, it seems like the mystery of our own like</p>
<p>cognition and consciousness is much grander than like the degrees of freedom of possible</p>
<p>explanations for what the heck is going on is much greater there than in the, in the</p>
<p>physics of the observed.</p>
<p>How the brain works.</p>
<p>How did life arise?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s big, big questions.</p>
<p>But they, to me, don&rsquo;t indicate the existence of, of, of an alien or something.</p>
<p>I mean, unless we are the aliens, you know, we could have been contamination from some</p>
<p>rocket ship that, that hit here a long, long time ago and all evidence of it has been destroyed.</p>
<p>But again, that alien would have started out somewhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not here watching us right now, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not among us.</p>
<p>And so though there are expert potential explanations for the Fermi paradox, and one of them that</p>
<p>I kind of like is that the truly intelligent creatures are those that decided not to colonize</p>
<p>the whole galaxy because they&rsquo;d quickly run out of room there because it&rsquo;s exponential,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You send a probe to a planet, it makes two copies, they go out, they make two copies</p>
<p>each and it&rsquo;s an exponential, right?</p>
<p>They quickly colonize the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>But then the distance to the next galaxy, the next big one like Andromeda, that&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>and a half million light years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a much grander scale now, right?</p>
<p>And so it also could be that the reason they survived this long is that they got over this</p>
<p>tendency that may well exist among sufficiently intelligent creatures, this tendency for aggression</p>
<p>and self destruction, right?</p>
<p>If they bypass that, and that may be one of the great filters if there are more than one,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Then they may not be a type of creature that feels the need to go and say, oh, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a nice looking planet and there&rsquo;s a bunch of ants on it, let&rsquo;s go squish them and colonize</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>No, it could even be the kind of Star Trek like prime directive where you go and explore</p>
<p>worlds, but you don&rsquo;t interfere in any way, right?</p>
<p>And also we call it exploration is beautiful and everything, but there is underlying this</p>
<p>desire to explore is a desire to conquer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if we&rsquo;re just being really honest right now for us, it is right.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s possible to separate, but I would venture to say that you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that those are coupled.</p>
<p>So I could, I could imagine a civilization that lives on for billions of years that just</p>
<p>stays on, it&rsquo;s like figures out the minimal effort way of just peacefully existing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a monastery.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it limits itself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It limits itself.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s planted its seeds in a number of places.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not vulnerable to a single point failure, right?</p>
<p>Supernova going off near one of these stars or something, or an asteroid or a comet coming</p>
<p>in from the Oort cloud equivalent of that planetary system and without warning, you</p>
<p>know, thrashing them to bits.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got their seeds in a bunch of places, but they chose not to colonize, colonize the</p>
<p>galaxy.</p>
<p>And they also choose not to interfere with this incredibly prevalent, primitive organism</p>
<p>homo sapiens, right?</p>
<p>Or they, uh, this is like a, they enjoy, this is like a TV show for them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It could be like a TV show.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So they just tuned in.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There are no other possible explanations yet.</p>
<p>I think that to me, the most likely explanation for the peri me paradox is that they really</p>
<p>are very, very rare.</p>
<p>And you know, Carl Sagan estimated a hundred thousand of them.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s that many, some of them would have been way ahead of us and, and I think we would</p>
<p>have seen them by now.</p>
<p>If there are a handful, maybe they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>But at that point, you&rsquo;re right on this dividing line between being a pessimist and an optimist.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what are the odds for that?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What are the things that had to go right for us?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then, you know, getting back to something you said earlier, let&rsquo;s discuss, you know,</p>
<p>primitive life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That could be the thing that&rsquo;s difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Just getting the random molecules together to a point where they start self replicating</p>
<p>and evolving and becoming better and all that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an inordinately difficult thing, I think, though I&rsquo;m not, you know, some molecular</p>
<p>or cell biologist, but just it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the usual argument.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re wandering around in the Sahara desert and you stumble across a watch.</p>
<p>Is your, is your initial response, oh, you know, a bunch of sand grains just came together</p>
<p>randomly and formed this watch.</p>
<p>No, you, you think that something formed it or it came from some simpler structure that</p>
<p>then became, you know, more complex.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t just form.</p>
<p>Well, even the simplest life is, is a very, very complex structure.</p>
<p>Even the, even the simplest prokaryotic cells, not to mention eukaryotic cells, although</p>
<p>that transition may have been the so called great filter as well.</p>
<p>Maybe the cells without a nucleus are relatively easy to form.</p>
<p>And then the big next step is where you have a nucleus, which then provides a lot of energy,</p>
<p>which allows the cell to become much, much more complex and so on.</p>
<p>Interestingly, going from eukaryotic cells, single cells to multicellular organisms does</p>
<p>not appear to be, at least on earth, one of these great filters because there&rsquo;s evidence</p>
<p>that it happened dozens of times independently on earth.</p>
<p>So by, by a really great filter, something that happens very, very rarely, I mean that</p>
<p>we had to get through an obstacle that is just incredibly rare to get through.</p>
<p>And one of the really exciting scientific things is that that particular point is something</p>
<p>that we might be able to discover, even in our lifetimes that find life elsewhere like</p>
<p>Europa or be able to see that would be bad news, right?</p>
<p>Because if we find lots of pretty advanced life, yeah, that would suggest, and especially</p>
<p>if we found some, you know, defunct, you know, fossilized civilization or something somewhere</p>
<p>else that would be bacteria, you mean, defunct civilization of like, oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, I switched</p>
<p>gears there.</p>
<p>If we, if we found some intelligent or even trilobites right and stuff, you know, elsewhere,</p>
<p>that would be bad news for us because that would mean that the great filter is ahead</p>
<p>of us, you know, right, because it would mean that lots of, lots of things have gotten roughly</p>
<p>to our level.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But, but given the Fermi paradox, if you accept that the Fermi paradox means that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no one else out there, you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to accept that, but if you accept that</p>
<p>it means that no one else is out there and yet there are lots of things we found that</p>
<p>are at or roughly at our level, that means that the great filter is ahead of us and that</p>
<p>bodes poorly for our longterm future, you know, it&rsquo;s funny you said, uh, you started by saying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a little bit on the pessimistic side, but it&rsquo;s funny because we&rsquo;re doing this kind</p>
<p>of dance between pessimism and optimism because I&rsquo;m not sure if us being alone in the observable</p>
<p>universe as intelligent beings is pessimistic, well, it&rsquo;s good news in a sense for us because</p>
<p>it means that we made it through, see, if we&rsquo;re the only ones and there are such great</p>
<p>filters, maybe more than one formation of life might be one of them formation of eukaryotic</p>
<p>that is with the nucleus cells being another development of human like intelligence might</p>
<p>be another, right?</p>
<p>There might be several such filters and we were the lucky ones.</p>
<p>And you know, then people say, well then that means you&rsquo;re putting yourself into a special</p>
<p>perspective and every time we&rsquo;ve done that we&rsquo;ve been wrong and yeah, yeah, I know all</p>
<p>those arguments, but it still could be the case that there&rsquo;s one of us at least per galaxy</p>
<p>or pretend or a hundred or a thousand galaxies and we&rsquo;re sitting here having this conversation</p>
<p>because we exist.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s an observational selection effect there, right?</p>
<p>Just because we&rsquo;re special doesn&rsquo;t mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t have these conversations about</p>
<p>whether or not we&rsquo;re special, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s so exciting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s optimistic.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s the optimistic part that if we don&rsquo;t find other intelligent life</p>
<p>there, it might mean that we&rsquo;re the ones that made it.</p>
<p>And in general, outside the great filter and so on, you know, it&rsquo;s not obvious that the</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking thing, which is, it&rsquo;s not obvious that life out there is going to be kind to</p>
<p>us.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, I knew Hawking and I greatly respect his, his scientific work and in particular</p>
<p>the early work on the unification of general theory of relativity and quantum physics to</p>
<p>two great pillars in modern physics, you know, Hawking radiation and all that fantastic work.</p>
<p>You know, if you were alive, you should have been a recipient of this year&rsquo;s physics Nobel</p>
<p>prize, which was for the discovery of black holes and also by Roger Penrose for the theoretical</p>
<p>work showing that given a star that&rsquo;s massive enough, you basically can&rsquo;t avoid having a</p>
<p>black hole.</p>
<p>Anyway, Hawking, fantastic.</p>
<p>I, I tip my hat to him.</p>
<p>May he rest in peace.</p>
<p>That would have been a heck of a Nobel prize, black holes, heck of a good group.</p>
<p>But, but, but going back to what he said that we shouldn&rsquo;t be broadcasting our presence</p>
<p>to others there, I actually disagree with him respectfully because first of all, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been unintentionally broadcasting our presence for a hundred years since the development</p>
<p>of radio and TV.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Secondly, any alien that has the capability of coming here and squashing us either already</p>
<p>knows about us and you know, doesn&rsquo;t care because we&rsquo;re just like little ants.</p>
<p>And when there are ants in your kitchen, you tend to squash them.</p>
<p>But if there are ants on the sidewalk and you&rsquo;re walking by, do you feel some great</p>
<p>conviction that you have to squash any of them?</p>
<p>No, you generally don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re irrelevant to them.</p>
<p>All they need to do is keep an eye on us to see whether we&rsquo;re approaching the kind of</p>
<p>technological capability and know about them and have intentions of attacking them.</p>
<p>And then they can squash us, right?</p>
<p>Um, you know, they, they could have done it long ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll do it if they want to, whether we advertise our presence or not is, is irrelevant.</p>
<p>So I really think that that&rsquo;s not a huge existential threat.</p>
<p>So this is a good place to bring up a difficult topic.</p>
<p>You mentioned, um, they might, they would be paying attention to us to see if we come</p>
<p>up with any crazy technology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s folks who have reported UFO sightings.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually, I&rsquo;ve recently found out there&rsquo;s a websites that track this, the data,</p>
<p>the data of these reportings, and there&rsquo;s millions of them in the past, uh, several</p>
<p>decades.</p>
<p>So seven decades and so on that they&rsquo;ve been recorded and the ufologist community, as they</p>
<p>refer to themselves, you know, one of the ideas that I find compelling from an alien</p>
<p>perspective that they kind of started showing up ever since we figured out how to build</p>
<p>nuclear weapons that we should, uh, so I mean, you know, if I was an LA and I would start</p>
<p>showing up then as well, just, well, why not just observe us from afar?</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I would figure out, but that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m always, uh, keeping a distance and staying blurry,</p>
<p>but very pixelated, very pixelated, you know, that there is a something in the human condition</p>
<p>that a cognition that wants to see, wants to believe beautiful things and, uh, some</p>
<p>are terrifying, some are exciting, uh, goats, Bigfoot is a big fascination for folks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, uh, UFO sightings, I think falls into that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people that look at lights in the night sky and I mean, there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>a downer to think in a skeptical sense, to think that that&rsquo;s just a light.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want to feel like there&rsquo;s something magical there.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Uh, I mean, I felt that first when my dad, my dad&rsquo;s a physicist, when he first told me</p>
<p>about ball lightning when I was like a little kid, very weird, very like weird physical</p>
<p>phenomenon.</p>
<p>And he said, his intuition was telling me this as a little kid, uh, like, I really like</p>
<p>math.</p>
<p>His intuition was whoever figures out ball lightning, we&rsquo;ll get a Nobel prize.</p>
<p>Like he, I think that was a side comment he gave me and I decided there when I was like</p>
<p>five years old or whatever, I&rsquo;m going to win a Nobel prize for figuring out ball lightning.</p>
<p>That was like one of the first sort of sparks of the scientific mindset.</p>
<p>Those mysteries, they capture your imagination.</p>
<p>I think when I speak to people that report UFOs, that&rsquo;s that fire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I see.</p>
<p>That excitement.</p>
<p>And I understand that.</p>
<p>But what, what do we do with that?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s hundreds of thousands, if not millions, and then the scientific community,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like the perfect person.</p>
<p>You have an awesome Einstein shirt.</p>
<p>What, what do we do with those reports?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, most of the scientific community kind of rolls their eyes and dismisses it.</p>
<p>Is it possible that a tiny percent of those folks saw something that&rsquo;s worth deeply investigating?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>We should investigate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of these things where, you know, they&rsquo;ve not brought us a hunk of kryptonite</p>
<p>or something like that, right?</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t brought us actual tangible physical evidence with which experiments can be done</p>
<p>in laboratories.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>The photographs are, in some cases, in most cases, I would say quite ambiguous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to think about.</p>
<p>So David Faber is the first person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Navy pilot, commander, and there&rsquo;s a bunch of them, but he&rsquo;s sort of one of the</p>
<p>most legit pilots and people I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>The fact that he saw something weird, he doesn&rsquo;t know what the heck it is, but he saw something</p>
<p>weird.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that.</p>
<p>And one on the psychological side, so I&rsquo;m pretty confident he saw what he says he saw,</p>
<p>which he&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s something weird.</p>
<p>One of the interesting psychological things that worries me is that everybody in the Navy,</p>
<p>everybody in the US government, everybody in the scientific community, just kind of</p>
<p>like pretended that nothing happened.</p>
<p>That kind of instinct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes me believe if aliens show up, we would all like just ignore their presence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what bothered me that you don&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t investigate it more carefully and use</p>
<p>this opportunity to inspire the world.</p>
<p>So in terms of kryptonite, I think the conspiracy theory folks say that whenever there is some</p>
<p>good hard evidence that scientists would be excited about, there&rsquo;s this kind of conspiracy</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t like because it&rsquo;s ultimately negative that the US government will somehow</p>
<p>hide the good evidence to protect it.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s some legitimacy to it because you want to protect military secrets, all</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know what to do with this beautiful mess because I think millions of people are</p>
<p>inspired by UFOs and it feels like an opportunity to inspire people about science.</p>
<p>So I would say, as Carl Sagan used to say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary</p>
<p>evidence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve quoted him a number of times.</p>
<p>We would welcome such evidence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a lot of the things that are seen or perhaps even hidden from us, you</p>
<p>could imagine for military purposes, surveillance purposes, the US government doesn&rsquo;t want us</p>
<p>to know.</p>
<p>Or maybe some of these pilots saw Soviet or Israeli or whatever satellites or some of</p>
<p>the crashes that have occurred were later found to be weather balloons or whatever.</p>
<p>When there are more conventional explanations, science tends to stay away from the sensational</p>
<p>ones.</p>
<p>And so it may be that someone else&rsquo;s calling in life is to investigate these phenomena.</p>
<p>And I welcome that as a scientist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t categorically actually deny the possibility that ships of some sort could have visited</p>
<p>us because, as I said earlier, at slow speeds, there&rsquo;s no problem in reaching other stars.</p>
<p>In fact, our Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft in a few million years are going to be in</p>
<p>the vicinity of different stars.</p>
<p>We can even calculate which ones they&rsquo;re going to be in the vicinity of, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s nothing that breaks any laws of physics if you do it slowly.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s different, just having Voyager or Pioneer fly by some star, that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>from having active aliens altering the trajectory of their vehicle in real time, spying on us,</p>
<p>and then either zipping back to their home planet or sending signals that tell them about</p>
<p>us because they are likely many light years away, and they&rsquo;re not going to have broken</p>
<p>that barrier as well, okay?</p>
<p>So I just, you know, go ahead, study them.</p>
<p>For some young kid who wants to do it, it might be their calling, and that&rsquo;s how they</p>
<p>might find meaning in their lives, is to be the scientist who really explores these things.</p>
<p>I chose not to because at a very young age, I found the evidence, to the degree that I</p>
<p>investigated it, to be really quite unconvincing, and I had other things that I wanted to do.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t categorically deny the possibility, and I think it should be investigated.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is one of those phenomena that 99.9% of people are almost definitely,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s conventional explanations, and then there&rsquo;s like mysterious things that probably</p>
<p>have explanations that are a little bit more complicated, but there&rsquo;s not enough to work</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that if aliens showed up, there will be plenty of evidence for scientists</p>
<p>to study.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And exactly as you said, avoid your type of spacecraft that could see sort of some kind</p>
<p>of, kind of a dumb thing, almost like a sensor that&rsquo;s like probing, like statistically speaking.</p>
<p>Flying by.</p>
<p>Flying by, maybe lands, maybe there&rsquo;s some kind of robot type of thingies that just like</p>
<p>move around and so on, like in ways that we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>But I feel like, well, I feel like there&rsquo;ll be plenty of hard, hard to dismiss evidence.</p>
<p>And I also, especially this year, believe that the US government is not sufficiently</p>
<p>competent given the huge amount of evidence that will be revealed from this kind of thing</p>
<p>to conceal all of it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>At least in modern times, you can say maybe decades ago, but in modern times.</p>
<p>Right, you know, the people I speak to and the reason I bring it up is because so many</p>
<p>people write to me, they&rsquo;re inspired by it.</p>
<p>By the way, I wanted to comment on something you said earlier on, yeah, I had said that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of a pessimist in that I think there are very few other intelligent, mechanically</p>
<p>able creatures out there.</p>
<p>But then I said, yes, in a sense, I&rsquo;m an optimist, as you pointed out, because it means</p>
<p>that we made it through the great filter.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I meant originally that I&rsquo;m a pessimist in that I&rsquo;m pessimistic about the possibility</p>
<p>that there are many, many of us out there, you know, mathematically speaking in the Drake</p>
<p>equation.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it may mean a good thing for our ultimate survival.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad you caught me on that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely agree with you.</p>
<p>It is ultimately an optimistic statement.</p>
<p>But anyway, I think, you know, UFO research is interesting.</p>
<p>And I guess one of the reasons I&rsquo;ve not been terribly convinced is that I think there are</p>
<p>some scientists who are investigating this and they&rsquo;ve not found any clear evidence.</p>
<p>Now, I must admit, I have not looked through the literature to convince myself that there</p>
<p>are many scientists doing systematic studies of these various reports.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say for sure that there&rsquo;s a critical mass of them, but it&rsquo;s just that you never</p>
<p>get these reports from hardcore scientists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>And astronomers, you know, what do we do?</p>
<p>We spend our time studying the heavens and you&rsquo;d think we&rsquo;d be the ones that are most</p>
<p>likely aside from pilots, perhaps, at seeing weird things in the sky.</p>
<p>And we just never do of the unexplained UFO type nature.</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely, I try to keep an open mind, but for people who listen, it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>really difficult for scientists.</p>
<p>Like I get probably like this year, I&rsquo;ve probably gotten over probably maybe over a thousand</p>
<p>emails on the topic of AGI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to, you know, people write to me, it&rsquo;s like, how can you ignore this</p>
<p>in AGI side?</p>
<p>Like this model, this is obviously the model that&rsquo;s going to achieve general intelligence.</p>
<p>How can you ignore it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving you the answer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my document.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re always just these large write ups.</p>
<p>The problem is it&rsquo;s very difficult to weed through a bunch of BS.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that you had actually saw the UFO, but you have to acknowledge that</p>
<p>by UFO, I mean, an extraterrestrial life, you have to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of people who are a little bit, if not a lot full of BS.</p>
<p>And from a scientist perspective, it&rsquo;s really hard work and it&rsquo;s when there&rsquo;s amazing stuff</p>
<p>out there, it&rsquo;s like, why invest in Bigfoot when evolution in all of its richness is beautiful?</p>
<p>Who cares about a monkey that walks on two feet or eight or whatever?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a zillion decoys at observatories.</p>
<p>True fact.</p>
<p>We get lots and lots of phone calls when Venus, the evening star, but just really a bright</p>
<p>planet happens to be close to the crescent moon because it&rsquo;s such a striking pair.</p>
<p>This happens once in a while.</p>
<p>And we get these phone calls, oh, there&rsquo;s a UFO next to the moon.</p>
<p>And no, it&rsquo;s Venus.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re just and I&rsquo;m not saying the best UFO reports are of that nature.</p>
<p>No, there are some much more convincing cases.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen some of the footage and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s so many decoys, right?</p>
<p>So much so much noise that you have to filter out.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only so many scientists.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so much time as well.</p>
<p>And you have to choose what problems you work on.</p>
<p>You know, this might be a fun question to ask to kind of explore the idea of the expanding</p>
<p>universe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the the radius of the observable universe is 45.7 billion light years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s less than the radius of the universe.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that possible?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So I meant to bring a little a little prop I have with ping pong balls on a rubber hose,</p>
<p>a rubber band.</p>
<p>I use it in many of the lectures that one can find of me online.</p>
<p>But you have in an expanding universe, the space itself between galaxies or more correctly,</p>
<p>clusters of galaxies expanding.</p>
<p>So imagine light going from one cluster to another.</p>
<p>It traverses some distance and then while it&rsquo;s traversing the rest, that part that it</p>
<p>already traveled through continues to expand.</p>
<p>Now 13.7 billion years might have gone by since the light that we are seeing from the</p>
<p>early stages, the so called cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the afterglow</p>
<p>of the Big Bang or the echo of the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Yeah, 13.7 billion years have gone by.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how long it&rsquo;s taken that light to reach us.</p>
<p>But while it&rsquo;s been traveling that distance, the parts that it already traveled continue</p>
<p>to expand.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re walking on at an airport, you know, on one of these walkways and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>walking along because you&rsquo;re trying to get to your terminal.</p>
<p>But the walkway is continuing as well.</p>
<p>You end up traveling a greater distance or the same distance faster is another way of</p>
<p>putting it, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you get on one of these traveling walkways.</p>
<p>So you get roughly a factor of pi, you know, but it&rsquo;s more like 3.2, I think.</p>
<p>But when you work it all out, you multiply the number of years the universe has been</p>
<p>in existence by, you know, three and a quarter or so.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you get this 46 billion light year radius.</p>
<p>But how is that, let me ask some nice dumb questions, how is that not traveling faster</p>
<p>than the speed of light?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not traveling faster than the speed of light because locally at any point, if</p>
<p>you were to measure the light, the photons zipping past, it would not be exceeding the</p>
<p>speed of light.</p>
<p>The speed of light is a locally measured quantity.</p>
<p>After light has traversed some distance, if the rubber band keeps on stretching, then</p>
<p>yes, it looks like the light traveled a greater distance than it would have had the space</p>
<p>not been expanding.</p>
<p>But locally, it never was exceeding the speed of light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that the distance through which it already traveled then went off and expanded</p>
<p>on its own some more.</p>
<p>And if you give the light credit, so to speak, for having traversed that distance, well,</p>
<p>then it looks like it&rsquo;s going faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not how speed works.</p>
<p>And in relativity, also, the other thing that is interesting is that if you take two ping</p>
<p>pong balls that are sufficiently far apart, especially in an accelerating universe, you</p>
<p>can easily have them moving apart from one another faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>So take two ping pong balls that were originally 400,000 kilometers from each other and let</p>
<p>every centimeter in your rubber band expand to two in one second.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, this 400,000 kilometer distance is 800,000 kilometers.</p>
<p>It went out by 400,000 kilometers in one second.</p>
<p>That exceeds the 300,000 kilometer per second speed of light.</p>
<p>But that light limit, that particle limit in special relativity, applies to objects</p>
<p>moving through a preexisting space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in either special or general relativity that prevents space itself from</p>
<p>expanding faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>Einstein wouldn&rsquo;t have had a problem with a universe as observed now by cosmologists.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m yet ready to deal emotionally with expanding space.</p>
<p>That to me is one of the most awe inspiring things, starting from the Big Bang.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely abstract.</p>
<p>Space itself is expanding.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Could you, can we talk about the Big Bang a little bit?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>What, so like the entirety of it, the universe, was very small.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it was not a point.</p>
<p>It was not a point.</p>
<p>Because if we live in what&rsquo;s called a closed universe now, a sphere or the three dimensional</p>
<p>version of that would be a hypersphere, then regardless of how far back in time you go,</p>
<p>it was always that topological shape.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t turn a point suddenly into a shell, okay?</p>
<p>It always had to be a shell.</p>
<p>So when people say, well, the universe started out as a point, that&rsquo;s being kind of flippant,</p>
<p>kind of glib.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>It just started out at a very high density.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know actually whether it was finite or infinite, I think personally that</p>
<p>it was finite at the time, but it expanded very, very quickly.</p>
<p>Indeed, if it exponentiated and continued in some places to exponentiate, then it could</p>
<p>in fact be infinite right now.</p>
<p>And most cosmologists think that it is infinite.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>What infinite, which dimension, mass, size?</p>
<p>Infinite in space.</p>
<p>And by that I mean that if you were trying to measure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no boundary.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no light to measure its size.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d never be able to measure its size because it would always be bigger than the distance</p>
<p>light can travel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you get in a universe that&rsquo;s accelerating in its expansion.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But if a thing was a hypersphere, it&rsquo;s very small, not a point, how can that thing be</p>
<p>infinite?</p>
<p>Well, it expands exponentially.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the inflation theory is all about.</p>
<p>Indeed, at your home institution, Alan Guth is one of the originators of the whole inflationary</p>
<p>universe idea, along with Andre Linde at Stanford University here in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>And others, Alexei Starobinsky and others had similar sorts of ideas.</p>
<p>But in an exponentially expanding universe, if you actually try to make this measurement,</p>
<p>you send light out to try to see it curve back around and hit you in the back of the</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>But in an exponentially expanding universe, the amount of space remaining to be traversed</p>
<p>is always a bigger and bigger quantity.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll never get there from here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never reach the back of your head.</p>
<p>So observationally or operationally, it can be thought of as being infinite.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the best definitions of infinity, by the way.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the best sort of physical manifestations of infinity.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because you have to ask, how would you actually measure it?</p>
<p>Now, I sometimes say to my cosmology theoretical friends, well, if I were God and I were outside</p>
<p>this whole thing and I took a godlike slice in time, wouldn&rsquo;t it be finite no matter how</p>
<p>big it is?</p>
<p>And they object and they say, Alex, you can&rsquo;t be outside and take a godlike slice of time,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s nothing outside.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not, you know, or also, you know, what slice of time you&rsquo;re taking depends on</p>
<p>your motion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true even in special relativity that slices of time get tilted, in a sense,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re moving quickly, the axes, x and t actually become tilted, not perpendicular</p>
<p>to one another.</p>
<p>And you can look at Brian Greene&rsquo;s books and lectures and other things where he imagines</p>
<p>taking a loaf of bread and slicing it in units of time as you progress forward.</p>
<p>But then if you&rsquo;re zipping along relative to that loaf of bread, the slices of time</p>
<p>actually become tilted.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not even clear what slices of time mean.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m an observational astronomer, I know which end of the telescope to look through.</p>
<p>And the way I understand the infinity is, as I just told you, that operationally or</p>
<p>observationally, there&rsquo;d be no way of seeing that it&rsquo;s a finite universe, of measuring</p>
<p>a finite universe.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, it&rsquo;s infinite, even if it started out as a finite little dot.</p>
<p>Not a dot, I&rsquo;m sorry, a finite little hypersphere.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t really start out there because what happened before that?</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So this is where it gets into a lot of speculation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Okay, sure.</p>
<p>So, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>The idea of what happened before t equals zero and whether there are other universes</p>
<p>out there, I like to say that these are sort of on the boundaries of science.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just ideas that we wake up at three in the morning to go to the bathroom</p>
<p>and say, oh, well, let&rsquo;s think about what happened before the Big Bang or let there</p>
<p>be a multiplicity of universes.</p>
<p>In other words, we have real testable physics that we can use to draw certain conclusions</p>
<p>that are plausibility arguments based on what we know.</p>
<p>Now, admittedly, there are not really direct tests of these hypotheses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I call them hypotheses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really elevated to a theory because a theory in science is really something that</p>
<p>has a lot of experimental or observational support behind it.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re hypotheses, but they&rsquo;re not unreasonable hypotheses based on what we know about general</p>
<p>relativity and quantum physics.</p>
<p>And they may have indirect tests in that if you adopt this hypothesis, then there might</p>
<p>be a bunch of things you expect of the universe, and lo and behold, that&rsquo;s what we measure.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not actually measuring anything at t less than zero, or we&rsquo;re not actually</p>
<p>measuring the presence of another universe in this multiverse, and yet there are these</p>
<p>indirect ideas that stem forth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to prove uniqueness, and it&rsquo;s hard to completely convince oneself that a</p>
<p>certain hypothesis must be true.</p>
<p>But the more and more tests you have that it satisfies, let&rsquo;s say there are 50 predictions</p>
<p>it makes, and 49 of them are things that you can measure.</p>
<p>And then the 50th one is the one where you want to measure the actual existence of that</p>
<p>other universe, or what happened before t equals zero, and you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve satisfied 49 of the other testable predictions, and so that&rsquo;s science, right?</p>
<p>Now a conventional condensed matter physicist or someone who deals with real data in the</p>
<p>laboratory might say, oh, you cosmologists, that&rsquo;s not really science because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>directly testable, but I would say it&rsquo;s sort of testable.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not completely testable, and so it&rsquo;s at the boundary, but it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re coming</p>
<p>up with these crazy ideas, among them quantum fluctuations out of nothing, and then inflating</p>
<p>into a universe with, you might say, well, you created a giant amount of energy.</p>
<p>But in fact, this quantum fluctuation out of nothing in a quantum way violates the conservation</p>
<p>of energy.</p>
<p>But who cares?</p>
<p>That was a classical law anyway.</p>
<p>And then an inflating universe maintains whatever energy it had, be it zero or some infinitesimal</p>
<p>amount.</p>
<p>In a sense, the stuff of the universe has a positive energy, but there&rsquo;s a negative</p>
<p>gravitational energy associated with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I drop an apple.</p>
<p>I got kinetic energy, energy of motion out of that, but I did work on it to bring it</p>
<p>to that height.</p>
<p>So by going down and gaining energy of motion, positive one, two, three, four, five units</p>
<p>of kinetic energy, it&rsquo;s also gaining or losing, depending on how you want to think of it,</p>
<p>negative one, two, three, four, five units of potential energy, so the total energy remains</p>
<p>the same.</p>
<p>An inflating universe can do that, or other physicists say that energy isn&rsquo;t conserved</p>
<p>in general relativity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another way out of creating a universe out of nothing.</p>
<p>But the point is that this is all based on reasonably well tested physics, and although</p>
<p>these extrapolations seem kind of outrageous at first, they&rsquo;re not completely outrageous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re within the realm of what we call science already.</p>
<p>And maybe some young whippersnapper will be able to figure out a way to directly test</p>
<p>what happened before T equals zero or to test for the presence of these other universes,</p>
<p>but right now we don&rsquo;t have a way of doing that.</p>
<p>So speaking of young whippersnappers, Roger Penrose.</p>
<p>So he kind of has a, you know, idea that we, there may be some information that travels</p>
<p>from whatever the heck happened before the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>I kind of doubt it.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s possible to detect something, like actually experimentally be able to detect</p>
<p>some, I don&rsquo;t know what it is, radiation, some sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, and the cosmic microwave background radiation, there may be ways of doing that.</p>
<p>But is it, is it philosophically or practically possible to detect signs that this was before</p>
<p>the Big Bang or is it, or is it what you said, which is like everything we observe will,</p>
<p>as we currently understand, will have to be a creation of this particular observable universe?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, if you, it&rsquo;s very difficult to answer right now because we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a single verified, fully self consistent, experimentally tested quantum theory of gravity.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And of course the beginning of the universe is a large amount of stuff in a very small</p>
<p>space.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you need both quantum mechanics and general relativity.</p>
<p>Same thing if our universe re collapses and then bounces back to another Big Bang.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s also ideas there that some of the information leaks through or survives.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that we can answer that question right now because we don&rsquo;t have a quantum</p>
<p>theory of gravity that most physicists believe in.</p>
<p>And belief is perhaps the wrong word that most physicists trust because the experimental</p>
<p>evidence favors it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There are various forms of string theory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quantum loop gravity.</p>
<p>There are various ideas, but which, if any, will be the one that survives the test of</p>
<p>time and more importantly, within that, the test of experiment and observation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So my own feeling is probably these things don&rsquo;t survive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve seen any evidence in the cosmic microwave background radiation</p>
<p>of information leaking through.</p>
<p>Similarly, the one way or one of the few ways in which we might test for the presence of</p>
<p>other universes is if they were to collide with ours, that would leave a pattern, a temperature</p>
<p>signature in the cosmic microwave background radiation.</p>
<p>Some astrophysicists claim to have found it, but in my opinion, it&rsquo;s not statistically</p>
<p>significant to the level that would be necessary to have such an amazing claim, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a 5% chance that the microwave background had that distribution just by chance.</p>
<p>5% isn&rsquo;t very long odds if you&rsquo;re claiming that instead that you&rsquo;re finding evidence</p>
<p>from another universe.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like if the Large Hadron Collider people had claimed after gathering enough</p>
<p>data to show the Higgs particle when there was a 5% chance it could be just a statistical</p>
<p>fluctuation in their data.</p>
<p>No, they required 5 sigma, 5 standard deviations, which is roughly one chance in 2 million that</p>
<p>this is a statistical fluctuation of no physical greater significance.</p>
<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>It all boils down to that.</p>
<p>And the greater your claim, the greater is the evidence that is needed and the more evidence</p>
<p>you need from independent ways of measuring or of coming to that deduction.</p>
<p>A good example was the accelerating universe.</p>
<p>When we found evidence for it in 1998 with supernovae with exploding stars, it was great</p>
<p>that there were two teams that lent some credibility to the discovery.</p>
<p>But it was not until other astrophysicists used not only that technique, but more importantly,</p>
<p>other independent techniques that had their own potential sources of systematic error</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>But they all came to the same conclusion and that started giving a much more complete picture</p>
<p>of what was going on and a picture in which most astrophysicists quickly gained confidence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why that idea caught on so quickly is that there were other physicists and astronomers</p>
<p>doing observations completely independent of supernovae that seemed to indicate the</p>
<p>same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That period of your life that work with an incredible team of people that won the Nobel</p>
<p>Prize is just fascinating work.</p>
<p>Oh gosh.</p>
<p>Never in my wildest dreams as a kid did I think that I would be involved, much less</p>
<p>so heavily involved, in a discovery that&rsquo;s so revolutionary.</p>
<p>As a kid, as a scientist, if you&rsquo;re realistic, once you learn a little bit more about how</p>
<p>science is done and you&rsquo;re not going to win a Nobel Prize and be the next Newton or Einstein</p>
<p>or whatever, you just hope that you&rsquo;ll contribute something to humankind&rsquo;s understanding of</p>
<p>how nature works and you&rsquo;ll be satisfied with that.</p>
<p>But here I was in the right place at the right time, a lot of luck, a lot of hard work, and</p>
<p>there it was.</p>
<p>We discovered something that was really amazing and that was the greatest thrill, right?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for anything more than being involved in that discovery.</p>
<p>So the couple of teams, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the HiZ Supernova Search Team,</p>
<p>what was the Nobel Prize given for?</p>
<p>It was given for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe, not for the elucidation</p>
<p>of what dark energy is or what causes that expansion, that acceleration, be it universes</p>
<p>on the outside or whatever, it was only for the observational fact.</p>
<p>So first of all, what is the accelerating universe?</p>
<p>So the accelerating universe is simply that if we look at the galaxies moving away from</p>
<p>us right now, we would expect them to be moving away more slowly than they were billions of</p>
<p>years ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because galaxies have visible matter, which is gravitationally attractive, and dark</p>
<p>matter of an unknown sort that holds galaxies together and holds clusters of galaxies together.</p>
<p>And of course, they then pull on one another and they would tend to retard the expansion</p>
<p>of the universe.</p>
<p>Just as when I toss an apple up, even ignoring air resistance, the mutual gravitational attraction</p>
<p>between Earth and the apple slows the apple down.</p>
<p>If that attraction is great enough, then the apple will someday stop and even come back.</p>
<p>The Big Crunch, you could call it, or the Gnab Gibb, which is Big Bang backwards, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what could have happened to the universe.</p>
<p>But even if the universe&rsquo;s original expansion energy was so great that it avoids the Big</p>
<p>Crunch, that&rsquo;s like an apple thrown at Earth&rsquo;s escape speed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the rockets that go to Mars someday, right, with people.</p>
<p>Even then, you&rsquo;d expect the universe to be slowing down with time.</p>
<p>But we looked back through the history of the universe by looking at progressively more</p>
<p>distant galaxies and by seeing that the evolution of this expansion rate is that in the first</p>
<p>nine billion years, yeah, it was slowing down.</p>
<p>But in the last five billion years, it&rsquo;s been speeding up.</p>
<p>So who asked for that, right, you know?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting to talk about a little bit of the human story of the Nobel Prize,</p>
<p>which is, I mean, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really, first of all, the prize itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating on the psychological level that prizes, I know we kind of think</p>
<p>that prizes don&rsquo;t matter, but somehow they kind of focus the mind about some of the most</p>
<p>special things we&rsquo;ve accomplished.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the recognition, the funding, you know.</p>
<p>And also inspiration for, like I said, when I was a little kid, thinking about the Nobel</p>
<p>Prize, like I didn&rsquo;t, you know, it inspires millions of young scientists.</p>
<p>At the same time, there&rsquo;s a sadness to it a little bit that, especially in the field,</p>
<p>like depending on the field, but experimental fields that involve teams of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>sometimes hundreds of brilliant people, the Nobel Prize is only given to just a handful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Is it maxed at three?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not even written in Alfred Nobel&rsquo;s will, it turns out.</p>
<p>One of our teammates looked into it in a museum in Stockholm when we went there for Nobel</p>
<p>Week in 2011.</p>
<p>The leaders who got the prize formally knew that without the rest of us working hard in</p>
<p>the trenches, the result would not have been discovered.</p>
<p>So they invited us to participate in Nobel Week.</p>
<p>And so one of the team members looked in the will and it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just tradition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s archaic, you know, that&rsquo;s the way science used to be done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the way a lot of science is done now.</p>
<p>And you look at gravitational wave discovery, which was, you know, recognized with the Nobel</p>
<p>Prize in 2017, Ray Weiss at MIT got it and Kip Thorne and Barry Barish at Caltech.</p>
<p>And Ron Drever, one of the masterminds, had passed away earlier in the year.</p>
<p>So again, one of the rules of Nobel is that it&rsquo;s not given posthumously, or at least the</p>
<p>one exception might be if they&rsquo;ve made their decision and they&rsquo;re busy making their press</p>
<p>releases right before October, the first week in October or whatever, and then the person</p>
<p>passes away.</p>
<p>I think they don&rsquo;t change their minds then.</p>
<p>But yeah, you know, it doesn&rsquo;t square with today&rsquo;s reality that a lot of science is done</p>
<p>by big teams, in that case, a team of a thousand people.</p>
<p>In our case, it was two teams consisting of about 50 people.</p>
<p>And we used techniques that were arguably developed in part by people who, astrophysicists</p>
<p>who weren&rsquo;t even on those two papers, I mean, some of them were, but other papers were written</p>
<p>by other people, you know, and so it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>And none of those people was officially recognized.</p>
<p>And to me, it was okay.</p>
<p>You know, again, it was the thrill of doing the work and ultimately the work, the discovery</p>
<p>was recognized with the prize.</p>
<p>And you know, we got to participate in Nobel week and, you know, it&rsquo;s okay with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known other physicists whose lives were ruined because they did not get the Nobel</p>
<p>prize and they felt strongly that they should have.</p>
<p>Ralph Alpher of the Alpher beta gamma paper predicting the microwave background radiation,</p>
<p>we should have gotten it.</p>
<p>His advisor Gamoff was dead by that point.</p>
<p>But you know, Penzias and Wilson got it for the discovery and an Alpher, apparently from</p>
<p>colleagues who knew him well, I&rsquo;ve talked to them.</p>
<p>His life was ruined by this.</p>
<p>He just, it just not at his innards so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that in a small handful of people, even three, that you would be one</p>
<p>of the Nobel, one of the winners of the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t weigh heavy on you.</p>
<p>Well, you know, there were the two team leaders, Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt.</p>
<p>And usually there&rsquo;s the team leaders that are recognized.</p>
<p>And then Adam Rees was my postdoc.</p>
<p>First author, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>First author.</p>
<p>I was second author of that paper.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I was his direct mentor at the time.</p>
<p>Although he was, you know, one of these people who just, you know, runs with things.</p>
<p>He was an MIT undergraduate by the way, Harvard graduate student, and then a postdoc as a</p>
<p>so called Miller fellow for basic research and science at Berkeley, something that I</p>
<p>was back in 84 to 86.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re, you know, you&rsquo;re largely a free agent, but he worked quite closely with me</p>
<p>and he came to Berkeley to work with me and on Schmidt&rsquo;s team, he was charged with analyzing</p>
<p>the data and he measured the brightnesses of these distant supernovae showing that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fainter and thus more distant than anticipated.</p>
<p>And that led to this conclusion that the universe had to have accelerated in order to push them</p>
<p>out to such great distances.</p>
<p>And I was shocked when he showed me the data, the results of his calculations and measurements.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very, you know, so he deserved it.</p>
<p>And on Sol&rsquo;s team, Gerson Goldhaber deserved it.</p>
<p>But he died, I think a year earlier in 2010, but that would have been four.</p>
<p>And so, and me, well, I was on both teams, but, you know, was I number four, five, six,</p>
<p>seven?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very, so if I were to, it&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;re, I mean, I can make a very good</p>
<p>case for urine in the three.</p>
<p>And does that, is that psychologically, I mean, listen, it weighs on me a little bit</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that.</p>
<p>Perhaps it should motivate the rethinking, like Time magazine started doing like, you</p>
<p>know, person of the year and like they would start doing like concepts and almost like</p>
<p>the black hole gets the Nobel prize or the universe gets the Nobel prize and here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>list of people.</p>
<p>So like, or like the Oscar that you could say, because it&rsquo;s a team effort now and it</p>
<p>should be redone.</p>
<p>And the breakthrough prize in fundamental physics, which was started by Yuri Milner</p>
<p>and Zuckerberg is involved in others as well, you know, uh, they recognize the larger team.</p>
<p>Yeah, they, they recognize teams.</p>
<p>And so in fact, both teams in the accelerating universe were recognized with the breakthrough</p>
<p>prize in 2015.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the same three people, Reese Perlmutter and Schmidt got the red carpet</p>
<p>rolled out for them and were at the big ceremony and shared half of the prize money.</p>
<p>And the rest of us, roughly 50 shared the other half and didn&rsquo;t get to go to the ceremony.</p>
<p>So, but I, I feel for them, I mean, for the gravitational waves, it was a thousand people.</p>
<p>What are they going to do?</p>
<p>Invite everyone for the Higgs particle.</p>
<p>It was six to 8,000 physicists and engineers.</p>
<p>In fact, because of the whole issue of who gets it experimentally, that discovery still</p>
<p>has not been recognized, right?</p>
<p>The theoretical work by Peter Higgs and, uh, Anglaire got recognized, but there was a troika</p>
<p>of other people who perhaps wrote the most complete paper and they were, they were left</p>
<p>out and, um, another guy died, you know, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of his heartbreak.</p>
<p>And some people argue that the Nobel prize has been diluted too, because if you look</p>
<p>at Roger Penrose, you can make an argument that he should get the prize by himself.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just separate those, like he could have and should have, perhaps he should have</p>
<p>perhaps gotten it with Hawking before Hawking&rsquo;s death, right?</p>
<p>The problem was Hawking radiation had not been detected, but you could argue that Hawking</p>
<p>made enough other fundamental contributions to the theoretical study of black holes and</p>
<p>the observed data were already good enough at the time of before Hawking&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, the latest results by Reinhard Genzel&rsquo;s group is that they see the time dilation effect</p>
<p>of a star that&rsquo;s passing very close to the black hole in the middle of our galaxy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool, but, and it adds additional evidence, but hardly anyone doubted the existence of</p>
<p>the supermassive black hole and Andrea Gaz&rsquo;s group, I believe hadn&rsquo;t yet shown that relativistic</p>
<p>effect and yet she got part of the prize as well.</p>
<p>So clearly it was given for the, the original evidence that was really good.</p>
<p>And that evidence is at least a decade old, you know, so one could make the case for,</p>
<p>for Hawking, one could make the case that in 2016, when Mayor and Caloz won the Nobel</p>
<p>Prize for the discovery of the first exoplanet, 51B Pegasi, well, there was a fellow at Penn</p>
<p>State, Alex Wolszczan, who in 1992, three years preceding 1995, found a planet orbiting</p>
<p>a pulsar, a very weird kind of star, a neutron star, and that wouldn&rsquo;t have been a normal</p>
<p>planet.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And so the Nobel committee, you know, they gave it for the discovery of planets around</p>
<p>normal sun like stars, but, but hell, you know, Wolszczan found a planet so they could</p>
<p>have given it to him as the third person instead of to Jim Peebles for the development of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called physical cosmology.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at Princeton, he deserved it, but they could have given Nobel for the development</p>
<p>of physical cosmology to Peebles and I would claim some other people were pretty important</p>
<p>in that development as well.</p>
<p>You know, and they could have given it some other year.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy.</p>
<p>I try not to dwell on it.</p>
<p>Was I number three?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>You know, Adam Riess did the work.</p>
<p>You know, I helped bounce ideas off of him, but we wouldn&rsquo;t have had the result without</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I was on both teams for reasons, I mean, you know, I, the style of the first team,</p>
<p>the supernova cosmology project didn&rsquo;t match mine.</p>
<p>They came largely from experimental high energy particle physics, physics where there&rsquo;s these</p>
<p>hierarchical teams and stuff and it&rsquo;s hard for the little guy to have a say, at least</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I kind of thought.</p>
<p>Whereas the team of astronomers led by Brian Schmidt was first of all, a bunch of my friends</p>
<p>and they grew up as astronomers making contributions on little teams and we decided to band together,</p>
<p>but all of us had our voices heard.</p>
<p>So it was sort of a culture, a style that I preferred really.</p>
<p>But let me tell you a story at the Nobel banquet, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting there between two physicists who are members of the committee of the Swedish</p>
<p>National Academy of Sciences, you know, and I strategically kept, you know, offering them</p>
<p>wine and stuff during this long drawn out Nobel ceremony, right?</p>
<p>And I got them to be pretty talkative and then in a polite diplomatic way, I started</p>
<p>asking them pointed questions and basically they admitted that if there are four or more</p>
<p>people equally deserving, they wait for one of them to die or they just don&rsquo;t give the</p>
<p>prize at all when it&rsquo;s unclear who the three are, at least unclear to them.</p>
<p>But unclear to them, they&rsquo;re not even right part of the time.</p>
<p>I mean, Jocelyn Bell discovered pulsars with a radio antenna, a set of radio antennas that</p>
<p>her advisor Anthony Hewish conceived and built, so he deserves some credit, but he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>discover the pulsar.</p>
<p>She did.</p>
<p>And his initial reaction to the data that she showed him was a condescending rubbish,</p>
<p>my dear.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>
<p>Now, I know Jocelyn Bell and she did not let this destroy her life.</p>
<p>She won every other prize under the sun, okay?</p>
<p>Vera Rubin, arguably one of the discoverers of dark matter, although there, if you look</p>
<p>at the history, there were a number of people and that was the issue, I think there were</p>
<p>a number of people, four or more who had similar data and similar ideas at about the same time.</p>
<p>Rubin won every prize under the sun, the new big large scale survey telescope being built</p>
<p>in Chile is being renamed the Vera Rubin Telescope because she passed away in December of 2015,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;ll conduct this survey, large scale survey with the Rubin Telescope.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s been recognized, but never with the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>And I would say that to her credit, she did not let that consume her life either.</p>
<p>And perhaps it was a bit easier because there had been no Nobel given for the discovery</p>
<p>of dark matter, whereas in the case of pulsars and Jocelyn Bell, there was a prize given</p>
<p>for the discovery of the freaking pulsars and she didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, what a travesty of justice.</p>
<p>So I also think as a fan of fiction, as a fan of stories that the travesty and the tragedy</p>
<p>and the unfairness and the tension of it is what makes the prize and similar prizes beautiful.</p>
<p>The decisions of other humans that result in dreams being broken and, you know, like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we love the Olympics as so many, you know, people, athletes give their whole</p>
<p>life for this particular moment and then there&rsquo;s referee decisions and like little slips of</p>
<p>here and there, like the little misfortunes that destroy entire dreams.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s weird to say, but it feels like that makes the entirety of it even</p>
<p>more special.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If it was perfect, it wouldn&rsquo;t be interesting.</p>
<p>Humans like competition and they like heroes and unfortunately it gives the impression</p>
<p>to youngsters today that science is still done by white men with gray beards wearing</p>
<p>white lab coats.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very pleased to see that this year, you know, Andrea Ghez, the fourth woman in</p>
<p>the history of the physics prize to have received it.</p>
<p>And then two women, one at Berkeley, one elsewhere won the Nobel prize in chemistry without any</p>
<p>male co recipient.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sending a message I think to girls that they can do science and they have</p>
<p>role models.</p>
<p>I think the breakthrough prize and other such prizes show that teams get recognized as well.</p>
<p>And if you pay attention to the newspapers, you know, most of the good authors like, you</p>
<p>know, Dennis Overby of the New York Times and others said that these were teams of people</p>
<p>and they, they emphasize that and, you know, they all played a role.</p>
<p>And you know, maybe if some grad student hadn&rsquo;t soldered some circuit, maybe the whole thing</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have worked, you know.</p>
<p>But still, you know, Ray Weiss and Kip Thorne was the theoretical, you know, impetus for</p>
<p>the whole search for gravitational waves, Barry Barish brought the MIT and Caltech teams</p>
<p>together to get them to cooperate at a time when the project was nearly dead from what</p>
<p>I understand and contributed greatly to the experimental setup as well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a great experimental physicist, but he was really good at bringing these two teams</p>
<p>together instead of having them duke it out in blows and leaving both of them bleeding</p>
<p>and dying.</p>
<p>You know, the National Science Foundation was going to cut the funding from what I understand,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>So, so there&rsquo;s human drama involved in this whole thing.</p>
<p>And the Olympics, yeah, you know, a runner, a swimmer, a runner, runner, you know, they</p>
<p>slip just at the moment that they were taking off from the first thing and that costs them</p>
<p>some fraction of a second and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t win, you know.</p>
<p>And in that case, I mean, the coaches, the families, which I met a lot of Olympic athletes</p>
<p>and the coaches and the families of the athletes are really the winners of the medals.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t get the medal and it&rsquo;s, you know, credit assignment is a fascinating thing.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the full human story we have.</p>
<p>And outside of prizes, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, just to be in the middle of it for artificial intelligence, there&rsquo;s a field of</p>
<p>deep learning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>And people have been, there&rsquo;s yet another award, the touring awards given for deep learning</p>
<p>to three folks who are very much responsible for the field, but so are a lot of others.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few, there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a fellow by the name of Schmidt Huber who sort of symbolizes</p>
<p>the, the forgotten folks in the deep learning community.</p>
<p>But you know, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the unfortunate sad thing where you remember, remember Isaac</p>
<p>Newton or remember these, these, these special figures and the ones that flew close to them,</p>
<p>we forget.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And you know, often the breakthroughs are made based on the body of knowledge that had</p>
<p>been assimilated prior to that.</p>
<p>But you know, again, people like to worship heroes.</p>
<p>You mentioned the Oscars earlier and you know, you look at the direct, I mean, well, I mean,</p>
<p>okay, directors and stuff sometimes get awards and stuff, but you know, you look at even</p>
<p>something like, I don&rsquo;t know, songwriters, musicians, Elton John or something, right?</p>
<p>Bernie Taupin, right?</p>
<p>Wrote many of the words or he&rsquo;s not as well known or the Beatles or something like that.</p>
<p>I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis didn&rsquo;t write most of the songs.</p>
<p>Yeah, Elvis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>But he was the king, right?</p>
<p>And he had such a personality and it was such a performer, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the unsung heroes in many cases.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So maybe taking a step back, we talked about the Nobel prize of the accelerating universe,</p>
<p>but your work and the ideas around supernova were important in detecting this accelerating</p>
<p>universe.</p>
<p>Can we go to the very basics of what is this beautiful, mysterious object of a supernova?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So a supernova is an exploding star.</p>
<p>Most stars die a relatively quiet death, our own sun, well, despite the fact that it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>become a red giant and incinerate earth, it&rsquo;ll do that reasonably slowly.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a small minority of stars that end their lives in a Titanic explosion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not only exciting to watch from afar, but it&rsquo;s critical to our existence because</p>
<p>it is in these explosions that the heavy elements synthesize through nuclear reactions during</p>
<p>the normal course of the star&rsquo;s evolution and during the explosion itself, get injected</p>
<p>into the cosmos, making them available as raw material for new stars, planets, and ultimately</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a great story, the best in some ways.</p>
<p>So we like to study these things and our origins, but it turns out these are incredibly useful</p>
<p>beacons as well, because if you know how powerful an exploding star really is by measuring the</p>
<p>apparent brightness at its peak in galaxies whose distances we already know through having</p>
<p>made other measurements, and you can thus calibrate how powerful the thing really is,</p>
<p>and then you find ones that are much more distant, then you can use their observed brightness</p>
<p>compared with their true intrinsic power or luminosity to judge their distance and hence</p>
<p>the distance of the galaxy in which they&rsquo;re located.</p>
<p>Let me just give this one analogy.</p>
<p>You judge the distance of an oncoming car at night by looking at how bright its headlights</p>
<p>appear to be, and you&rsquo;ve calibrated how bright the headlights are of a car that&rsquo;s two or</p>
<p>three meters away of known distance, and you go, oh, that&rsquo;s a faint headlight, and so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty far away.</p>
<p>You also use the apparent angular separation between the two headlights as a consistency</p>
<p>check in your brain, but that&rsquo;s what your brain is doing.</p>
<p>So we can do that for cars, we can do that for stars.</p>
<p>Nice, I like that.</p>
<p>But you know, with cars, the headlights are all, there&rsquo;s some variation, but they&rsquo;re somewhat</p>
<p>similar so you can make those kinds of conclusions.</p>
<p>How much variation is there between supernova that you can detect them?</p>
<p>Right, so first of all, there are several different ways that stars can explode, and</p>
<p>it depends on their mass and whether they&rsquo;re in a binary system and things like that.</p>
<p>And the ones that we used for these cosmological purposes, studying the expansion of the history</p>
<p>of the universe, are the so called type Roman numeral I, lowercase a, type Ia supernovae.</p>
<p>They come from a weird type of a star called a white dwarf.</p>
<p>Our own sun will turn into a white dwarf in about seven billion years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll have about half its present mass compressed into a volume just the size of Earth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an inordinate density, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly dense.</p>
<p>And the matter is what&rsquo;s called by quantum physicists degenerate matter, not because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s morally reprehensible or anything like that, but this is just the name that quantum</p>
<p>physicists give to electrons that are squeezed into a very tight space.</p>
<p>The electrons take on a motion due to Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainty principle, and also due to the</p>
<p>Pauli exclusion principle that electrons don&rsquo;t like to be in the same place, they like to</p>
<p>avoid each other.</p>
<p>And those two things mean that a lot of electrons are moving very rapidly, which gives the star</p>
<p>an extra pressure far above the thermal pressure associated with just the random motions of</p>
<p>particles inside the star.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a weird type of star, but normally it wouldn&rsquo;t explode and our sun won&rsquo;t explode,</p>
<p>except that if such a white dwarf is in a pair with another more or less normal star,</p>
<p>it can steal material from that normal star until it gets to an unstable limit, roughly</p>
<p>one and a half times the mass of our sun, 1.4 or so.</p>
<p>This is known as the Chandrasekhar limit after Subramanian Chandrasekhar, an Indian astrophysicist</p>
<p>who figured this out when he was about 20 years old on a voyage from India to England</p>
<p>where he was to be educated.</p>
<p>And then he did this and then 50 years later he won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1984</p>
<p>largely for this work that he did as a youngster who was on his way to be educated.</p>
<p>And his advisor, the great Arthur Eddington in England, who had done a lot of great things</p>
<p>and was a great astrophysicist, nevertheless, he too was human and had his faults.</p>
<p>He ridiculed Chandra&rsquo;s scientific work at a conference in England and most of us, if</p>
<p>we had been Chandra, would have just given up astrophysics at that time when the great</p>
<p>Arthur Eddington ridicules our work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another inspirational story for the youngster.</p>
<p>Just keep going.</p>
<p>But anyway, no matter what your advisor says or don&rsquo;t always pay attention to your advisor.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lose hope if you really think you&rsquo;re onto something.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean never listen to your advisor.</p>
<p>They may have sage advice as well.</p>
<p>But anyway, when a white dwarf grows to a certain mass, it becomes unstable.</p>
<p>And one of the ways it can end its life is to go through a thermonuclear runaway.</p>
<p>So basically, the carbon nuclei inside the white dwarf start fusing together to form</p>
<p>heavier nuclei.</p>
<p>And the energy that those fusion reactions emit doesn&rsquo;t go into being dissipated out</p>
<p>of the star or expanding it the way if you take a blowtorch to the middle of the Sun,</p>
<p>you heat up its gases, the gases would expand and cool.</p>
<p>But this degenerate star can&rsquo;t expand and cool.</p>
<p>And so the energy pumped in through these fusion reactions goes into making the nuclei</p>
<p>move faster.</p>
<p>And that gets more of them sufficiently close together that they can undergo nuclear fusion,</p>
<p>thereby releasing more energy that goes into speeding up more nuclei.</p>
<p>And thus you have a runaway, a bomb, an uncontrolled fusion reactor instead of the controlled fusion,</p>
<p>which is what our Sun does.</p>
<p>Our Sun is a marvelous controlled fusion reactor.</p>
<p>This is what we need here on Earth, fusion energy to solve our energy crisis, right?</p>
<p>But the Sun holds the stuff in through gravity and you need a big mass to do that.</p>
<p>So this uncontrolled fusion reaction blows up a star that&rsquo;s pretty much the same in</p>
<p>all cases.</p>
<p>And you measure it to be almost the same in all cases.</p>
<p>But the devil is in the details, and in fact, we observe them to not be all the same.</p>
<p>And theoretically, they might not be all the same because the rate of the fusion reactions</p>
<p>might depend on the amount of trace heavier elements in the white dwarf.</p>
<p>And that could depend on how old it is, whether it was born billions of years ago when there</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t many heavier elements or whether it&rsquo;s a relatively young white dwarf and all</p>
<p>kinds of other things.</p>
<p>And part of my work was to show that indeed, not all the Type Ia&rsquo;s are the same.</p>
<p>You have to be careful when you use them.</p>
<p>You have to calibrate them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not standard candles the way it just, if all headlights or all candles were the</p>
<p>same lumens or whatever, you&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re standard and then it would be relative.</p>
<p>Standard candles is an awesome term, okay.</p>
<p>Standard candles is what astronomers like to say, but I don&rsquo;t like that term because</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t any standard candles, but there are standardizable candles.</p>
<p>And by looking at these type Ia&rsquo;s, you look at enough of them in nearby galaxies whose</p>
<p>distances you know independently.</p>
<p>And what you can tell is that, you know, this is something that a colleague of mine, Mark</p>
<p>Phillips did who was on Schmidt&rsquo;s team and arguably was one of the people who deserved</p>
<p>the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>He showed that the intrinsically more powerful Type Ia&rsquo;s decline in brightness, and it turns</p>
<p>out rise in brightness as well, more slowly than the less luminous Ia&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And so if you calibrate this by measuring a whole bunch of nearby ones and then you</p>
<p>look at a distant one, instead of saying, well, it&rsquo;s a 100 watt Type Ia supernova, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>much more powerful than that by the way, plus or minus 50, you can say, no, it&rsquo;s a hundred</p>
<p>and 12 plus or minus 15, or it&rsquo;s 84 plus or minus 17.</p>
<p>It tells you where it is in the power scale and it greatly decreases the uncertainties.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes these things cosmologically useful.</p>
<p>I showed that if you spread the light out into a spectrum, you can tell spectroscopically</p>
<p>that these things are different as well.</p>
<p>And in 1991, I happened to study two of the extreme peculiar ones, the low luminosity</p>
<p>ones and the high luminosity ones, 1991BG and 1991T.</p>
<p>This showed that not all the Ia&rsquo;s are the same.</p>
<p>And indeed, at the time of 1991, I was a little bit skeptical that we could use Type Ia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because of this diversity that I was observing.</p>
<p>But in 1993, Mark Phillips wrote a paper that showed this correlation between the light</p>
<p>curve, the brightness versus time and the peak luminosity.</p>
<p>Which gives you enough information to calibrate.</p>
<p>Then they become calibratable and that was a game changer.</p>
<p>How many Type Ia&rsquo;s are out there to use for data?</p>
<p>Now there are thousands of them, but at the time, the high Z team had 16 and the supernova</p>
<p>cosmology project had 40.</p>
<p>But the 16 were better measured than the 40.</p>
<p>And so our statistical uncertainties were comparable if you look at the two papers that</p>
<p>were published.</p>
<p>How does that make you feel that there&rsquo;s these gigantic explosions just sprinkled out there?</p>
<p>Well, I certainly don&rsquo;t want one to be very nearby and it would have to be within something</p>
<p>like 10 light years to be an existential threat.</p>
<p>So they can happen in our galaxy?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So they would be okay?</p>
<p>In most cases we&rsquo;d be okay because our galaxy is 100,000 light years across.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d need one of these things to be within about 10 light years to be an existential</p>
<p>threat.</p>
<p>And it gives birth to a bunch of other stars, I guess?</p>
<p>Yeah, it gives birth to expanding gases that are chemically enriched and those expanding</p>
<p>gases mixed with other chemically enriched expanding gases or primordial clouds of hydrogen</p>
<p>and helium.</p>
<p>I mean, this is in a sense the greatest story ever told, right?</p>
<p>I teach this introductory astronomy course at Berkeley and I tell them there&rsquo;s only five</p>
<p>or six things that I want them to really understand and remember and I&rsquo;m going to come to their</p>
<p>deathbed and I&rsquo;m going to ask them about this and if they get it wrong, I will retroactively</p>
<p>fail and their whole career will have been shot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a student&rsquo;s worst nightmare.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t know and observe a total solar eclipse and yet they had the opportunity to</p>
<p>do so, I will retroactively fail them.</p>
<p>But one of them is, where did we come from?</p>
<p>Where did the elements in our DNA come from?</p>
<p>The carbon in our cells, the oxygen that we breathe, the calcium in our bones, the iron</p>
<p>in our red blood cells.</p>
<p>Those elements, the phosphorus in our DNA, they all came from stars, from nuclear reactions</p>
<p>in stars and they were ejected into the cosmos and in some cases, like iron, made during</p>
<p>the explosions and those gases drifted out, mixed with other clouds, made a new star or</p>
<p>a star cluster, some of whose members then evolved and exploded, thus enriching the gases</p>
<p>in the galaxy progressively more with time until finally, four and a half billion years</p>
<p>ago from one of these chemically enriched clouds, our solar system formed with a rocky</p>
<p>earthlike planet and somewhere, somehow, these self replicating, evolving molecules, bacteria</p>
<p>formed and evolved through paramecia and amoebas and slugs and apes and us.</p>
<p>And here we are, sentient beings that can ask these questions about our very origins</p>
<p>and with our intellect and with the machines we make, come to a reasonable understanding</p>
<p>of our origins.</p>
<p>What a beautiful story.</p>
<p>I mean, if that does not put you at least in awe, if not in love with science and its</p>
<p>power of deduction, I don&rsquo;t know what will, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the greatest stories, if not the greatest story.</p>
<p>Obviously, that&rsquo;s personality dependent and all that, it&rsquo;s a subjective opinion, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>perhaps the greatest story ever told.</p>
<p>I mean, you could link it to the Big Bang and go even farther, right, to make an even</p>
<p>more complete story, but as a subset, that&rsquo;s even in some ways a greater story than even</p>
<p>the existence of the universe in some ways, because you could just imagine some really</p>
<p>boring universe that never leads to sentient creatures such as ourselves.</p>
<p>And is a supernova usually the introduction to that story?</p>
<p>So are they usually the thing that launches the, is there other engines of creation?</p>
<p>Well, the supernova is the one, I mean, I touch upon the subject earlier in my course,</p>
<p>in fact, right about now in my lectures, because I talk about how our sun right now is fusing</p>
<p>hydrogen to form helium nuclei and later it&rsquo;ll form carbon and oxygen nuclei, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the process will stop for our sun, it&rsquo;s not massive enough, some stars that are more</p>
<p>massive can go somewhat beyond that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the beginning of this idea of the birth of the heavy elements, since they couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have been born at the time of the Big Bang, conditions of temperature and pressure weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sufficient to make any significant quantities of the heavier elements.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the beginning, but then you need some of these stars to explode, right?</p>
<p>Because if those heavy elements remained forever trapped in the cores of stars, then they would</p>
<p>not be available for the production of new stars, planets, and ultimately life.</p>
<p>So indeed the supernova, my main area of interest, plays a leading role in this whole story.</p>
<p>I saw that you got a chance to call Richard Feynman a mentor of yours when you were at</p>
<p>Caltech.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you have any fond memories of Feynman, any lessons that stick with you?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, he was quite a character and one of the deepest thinkers of all time probably,</p>
<p>and at least in my life, the physicist who had the single most intuitive understanding</p>
<p>of how nature works of anyone I&rsquo;ve met.</p>
<p>I learned a number of things from him, he was not my thesis advisor, I worked with Wallace</p>
<p>Sargent at Caltech on what are called active galaxies, big black holes in the centers of</p>
<p>galaxies that are accreting or swallowing material, a little bit like the stuff of this</p>
<p>year&rsquo;s Nobel Prize in Physics 2020.</p>
<p>But Feynman I had for two courses, one was general theory of relativity at the graduate</p>
<p>level and one was applications of quantum physics to all kinds of interesting things.</p>
<p>And he had this very intuitive way of looking at things that he tried to bring to his students</p>
<p>and he felt that if you can&rsquo;t explain something in a reasonably simple way to a non scientist</p>
<p>or at least someone who is versed a little bit with science but is not a professional</p>
<p>scientist then you probably don&rsquo;t understand it very well yourself very thoroughly.</p>
<p>So that in me made a desire to be able to explain science to the general public and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often found that in explaining things, yeah, there&rsquo;s a certain part that I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really understand myself, that&rsquo;s one reason I like to teach the introductory courses to</p>
<p>the lay public is that I sometimes find that my explanations are lacking in my own mind.</p>
<p>So he did that for me.</p>
<p>Is there a, if I could just pause for a second, you said he had one of the most intuitive</p>
<p>understanding of nature.</p>
<p>What if you could break apart what intuitive means, like is that on the philosophical level?</p>
<p>No, sort of physical.</p>
<p>How do you draw a mental picture or a picture on paper of what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s perhaps most famous in this regard for his Feynman diagrams, which in what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called quantum electrodynamics, a quantum field theory of electricity and magnetism.</p>
<p>What you have are actually an exchange of photons between charged particles and they</p>
<p>might even be virtual photons if the particles are at rest relative to one another.</p>
<p>And there are ways of doing calculations that are brute force that take pages on pages and</p>
<p>pages of calculations.</p>
<p>And Julian Schwinger developed some of the mathematics for that and won the Nobel prize</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>But Feynman had these diagrams that he made and he had a set of rules of what to do at</p>
<p>the vertex.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have two particles coming together and then a particle going out and then two particles</p>
<p>coming out again.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d have these rules associated when there were vertices and when there were particles</p>
<p>splitting off from one another and all that.</p>
<p>And it looked a little bit like a bunch of a hodgepodge at first.</p>
<p>But to those who learned the rules and understood them, they saw that you could do these complex</p>
<p>calculations in a much simpler way.</p>
<p>And indeed, in some ways, Freeman Dyson had an even better knack for explaining really</p>
<p>what quantum electrodynamics actually was.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t know Freeman Dyson.</p>
<p>I knew Feynman.</p>
<p>Maybe he did have a more intuitive view of the world than Feynman did.</p>
<p>But of the people I knew, Feynman was the most intuitive, most sort of, is there a picture?</p>
<p>Is there a simple way you can understand this?</p>
<p>In the path that a particle follows even, you can get the classical path, at least for</p>
<p>a baseball or something like that, by using quantum physics if you want.</p>
<p>But in a sense, the baseball sniffs out all possible paths.</p>
<p>It goes out to the Andromeda galaxy and then goes to the batter.</p>
<p>But the probability of doing that is very, very small because tiny little paths next</p>
<p>door to any given path cancel out that path.</p>
<p>And the ones that all add together, they&rsquo;re the ones that are more likely to be followed.</p>
<p>And this actually ties in with Fermat&rsquo;s principle of least action and there are ideas in optics</p>
<p>that go into this as well and just sort of beautifully brings everything together.</p>
<p>But the particle sniffs out all possible paths.</p>
<p>What a crazy idea.</p>
<p>But if you do the mathematics associated with that, it ends up being actually useful, a</p>
<p>useful way of looking at the world.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re also, I mean, you&rsquo;re widely acknowledged as, I mean, outside of your science work as</p>
<p>being one of the greatest educators in the world.</p>
<p>And Feynman is famous for being that.</p>
<p>Is there something about being a teacher that you&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s very, very rewarding when you have students who are really into it.</p>
<p>You know, going back to Feynman, at Caltech, I was taking these graduate courses and there</p>
<p>were two of us, myself and Jeff Richmond, who&rsquo;s now a professor of physics at University</p>
<p>of California, Santa Barbara, who asked lots of questions.</p>
<p>And a lot of the Caltech students are nervous about asking questions.</p>
<p>They want to save face.</p>
<p>They seem to think that if they ask a question, their peers might think it&rsquo;s a stupid question.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t really care what people thought and Jeff Richmond didn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<p>We asked all these questions and in fact, in many cases, they were quite good questions</p>
<p>and Feynman said, well, the rest of you should be having questions like this.</p>
<p>And I remember one time in particular when he said to the rest of the class, why is it</p>
<p>always these two?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t the rest of you curious about what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Do you really understand it all that well?</p>
<p>If so, why aren&rsquo;t you asking the next most logical question?</p>
<p>No, you guys are too scared to ask these questions that these two are asking.</p>
<p>So he actually invited us to lunch a couple of times where just the three of us sat and</p>
<p>had lunch with one of the greatest thinkers of 20th century physics.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, he rubbed off on me and, you know, you encourage questions as well, encourage</p>
<p>questions, you know, and yeah, you know, definitely, I mean, you know, I encourage questions.</p>
<p>I like it when students ask questions.</p>
<p>I tell them that they shouldn&rsquo;t feel shy about asking a question.</p>
<p>Probably half the students in the class would have that same question if they even understood</p>
<p>the material enough to ask that question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Curiosity is the first step of seeing the beauty of something.</p>
<p>So yeah, and the question is the ultimate form of curiosity.</p>
<p>Let me ask, what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>The meaning of life, you know, from a cosmologist&rsquo;s perspective or from a human perspective, personal,</p>
<p>you know, life is what you make of it, really, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s each of us has to have our own meaning and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be.</p>
<p>Well, I think that in many cases, meaning is to some degree associated with goals.</p>
<p>You set some goals or expectations for yourself, things you want to accomplish, things you</p>
<p>want to do, things you want to experience, and to the degree that you experience those</p>
<p>and do those things, it can give you meaning.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to change the world the way Newton or Michelangelo or da Vinci did.</p>
<p>I mean, people often say, you changed the world, but look, come on, there&rsquo;s seven and</p>
<p>a half, close to eight billion of us now.</p>
<p>Most of us are not going to change the world and does that mean that most of us are leading</p>
<p>meaningful lives?</p>
<p>No, it just has to be something that gives you meaning, that gives you satisfaction,</p>
<p>that gives you a good feeling about what you did.</p>
<p>And often, based on human nature, which can be very good and also very bad, but often</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the things that help others that give us meaning and a feeling of satisfaction.</p>
<p>You taught someone to read, you cared for someone who was terminally ill, you brought</p>
<p>up a nice family, you brought up your kids, you did a good job, you put your heart and</p>
<p>soul into it, you read a lot of books if that&rsquo;s what you wanted to do, had a lot of perspectives</p>
<p>on life, you traveled the world if that&rsquo;s what you wanted to do.</p>
<p>But if some of these things are not within reach, you&rsquo;re in a socioeconomic position</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t travel the world or whatever, you find other forms of meaning.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be some profound, I&rsquo;m going to change the world, I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>the one who everyone remembers type thing, right?</p>
<p>In the context of the greatest story ever told, like the fact that we came from stars</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re two apes asking about the meaning of life, how does that fit together?</p>
<p>How does that make any sense?</p>
<p>It does, it does, and this is sort of what I was referring to, that it&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>universe that allows us to come into creation, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way that the universe found of knowing, of understanding itself, because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that inanimate rocks and stars and black holes and things have any real capability</p>
<p>of abstract thoughts and of learning about the rest of the universe or even their origins.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re just a pile of atoms that has no conscience, has no ability to think,</p>
<p>has no ability to explore, and we do.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying we&rsquo;re the epitome of all life forever, but at least for life on Earth</p>
<p>so far the evidence suggests that we are the epitome in terms of the richness of our thoughts,</p>
<p>the degree to which we can explore the universe, do experiments, build machines, understand</p>
<p>our origins.</p>
<p>And I just hope that we use science for good, not evil, and that we don&rsquo;t end up destroying</p>
<p>ourselves.</p>
<p>I mean, the whales and dolphins are plenty intelligent.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t ask abstract questions, they don&rsquo;t read books, but on the other hand, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not in any danger of destroying themselves and everything else as well.</p>
<p>And so maybe that&rsquo;s a better form of intelligence, but at least in terms of our ability to explore</p>
<p>and make use of our minds, I mean, to me, it&rsquo;s this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this that gives me the potential for meaning, right?</p>
<p>The fact that I can understand and explore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to think that the universe created us and eventually we&rsquo;ve built</p>
<p>telescopes to look back at it, to look back at its origins and to wonder how the heck</p>
<p>the thing works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s magnificent.</p>
<p>It needn&rsquo;t have been that way, right?</p>
<p>And this is one of the, you know, the multiverse sort of things.</p>
<p>You know, you can alter the laws of physics or even the constants of nature, seemingly</p>
<p>inconsequential things like the mass ratio of the proton and the neutron, you know, wake</p>
<p>me up when it&rsquo;s over, right?</p>
<p>What could be more boring?</p>
<p>But it turns out you play with things a little bit like the ratio of the mass of the neutron</p>
<p>to the proton and you generally get boring universes, only hydrogen or only helium or</p>
<p>only iron.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even get the rich periodic table, let alone bacteria, paramecia, slugs and humans,</p>
<p>okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even anthropocentrizing this to the degree that I could.</p>
<p>Even a rich periodic table wouldn&rsquo;t be possible if certain constants weren&rsquo;t this way, but</p>
<p>they are.</p>
<p>And that to me leads to the idea of a multiverse that, you know, the dice were thrown many,</p>
<p>many times and there&rsquo;s this cosmic archipelago where most of the universes are boring and</p>
<p>some might be more interesting.</p>
<p>But we are in the rare breed that&rsquo;s really quite darn interesting.</p>
<p>And if there were only one and maybe there is only one, well then that&rsquo;s truly amazing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>But I actually think there are lots and lots, just like there are lots of planets.</p>
<p>Earth isn&rsquo;t special for any particular reason.</p>
<p>There are lots of planets in our solar system and especially around other stars.</p>
<p>And occasionally there are going to be ones that are conducive to the development of complexity</p>
<p>culminating in life as we know it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a beautiful story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it.</p>
