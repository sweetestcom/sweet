<p>that&rsquo;s better okay so question I had a</p>
<p>question was does tryptophan in the</p>
<p>turkey make us tired that is actually a</p>
<p>myth</p>
<p>let me explain tryptophan tryptophan is</p>
<p>an amino acid and tryptophan is one of</p>
<p>the largest amino acids compared to</p>
<p>other amino acids so it&rsquo;s really only</p>
<p>absorbed an empty stomach so because it</p>
<p>is combined with other protein it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never going to work so the real reason</p>
<p>why people get</p>
<p>tired after the Thanksgiving meal is</p>
<p>because the starches combine with the</p>
<p>sugar combined with a massive amount of</p>
<p>protein that people have it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>spike insulin</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s gonna be falling asleep you</p>
<p>know taking their nap and that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s behind the sleepiness is not the</p>
<p>tryptophan in fact you really you know</p>
<p>what we did last yesterday was we</p>
<p>basically didn&rsquo;t have any sugar</p>
<p>we had the protein as far as our</p>
<p>starches instead of mashed potatoes we</p>
<p>did cauliflower mashed potatoes it was</p>
<p>incredible</p>
<p>Karen is an awesome cook and no sugar so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way to go and I think we got</p>
<p>cut off from the other question so you</p>
<p>can call back on that one</p>
<p>so Arlene you had a question</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Delaware go ahead good how</p>
<p>are you a problem sometimes one but this</p>
<p>is how I do it I eat bacon and eggs in</p>
<p>the morning maybe around one o&rsquo;clock and</p>
<p>then maybe around six o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>my last meal which meant which will be a</p>
<p>meeting vegetables but I&rsquo;m dealing with</p>
<p>not being able to move my bowels like I</p>
<p>like my body feels it should and when</p>
<p>when should I be able to put in my</p>
<p>regular vegetables like lettuce and you</p>
<p>know stuff like that cuz I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what my body is lacking how should I add</p>
<p>that into my diet okay good question</p>
<p>Arlene the the whole key point on this</p>
<p>program is to have unlimited vegetables</p>
<p>and salad so you need to be putting that</p>
<p>back in immediately what happens when</p>
<p>you do the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>one of the biggest missing links or</p>
<p>things that people emit is enough</p>
<p>vegetables to get the potassium to keep</p>
<p>the bowels going usually if you increase</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to start going on a</p>
<p>regular basis so it&rsquo;s going to be very</p>
<p>simple add more vegetables into your</p>
<p>diet lots of them like said at least 7</p>
<p>cups up to 10</p>
<p>and you should be going on a regular</p>
<p>basis because think about it the fiber</p>
<p>in the vegetable feeds the microbe</p>
<p>microbes do not consume or eat</p>
<p>probiotics probiotics are the microbes</p>
<p>so the probiotics and friendly flora and</p>
<p>your gut those guys that they eat the</p>
<p>fiber and then they make a certain type</p>
<p>of nutrient that actually feeds your</p>
<p>colon cells but they need the vegetable</p>
<p>to be able to work correctly all right</p>
<p>versus the grain fiber which I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with but that was a really good</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>so Karen let&rsquo;s take a question from</p>
<p>Facebook do you have any any questions</p>
<p>coming up here yes as usual I have a lot</p>
<p>just sort of hello to everybody just</p>
<p>getting oriented here so I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>ask you to take one call ok good</p>
<p>so hey Jack you&rsquo;re on the air you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>from Alberta Canada</p>
<p>you had a question hi dr. Berg first</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;d like to wish you a Happy</p>
<p>Thanksgiving</p>
<p>thank you for all of your advice and</p>
<p>information and the past five months</p>
<p>doing here oh and IFS been able to lose</p>
<p>70 pounds luckily was able to fit into</p>
<p>my wedding tuxedo wow that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>though yes it has been a great help so</p>
<p>my question is on you know sort of</p>
<p>macros and intermittent fasting where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing the one meal a day for</p>
<p>like about five months now with amazing</p>
<p>results obviously but my question comes</p>
<p>down to thinking where I know generally</p>
<p>you recommend 0.4 grams per you know</p>
<p>pound of bodyweight or not you know very</p>
<p>moderate amount and but when I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>around the 220 pound mark that still</p>
<p>leaves me at about 80 to 100 grams of</p>
<p>protein a day okay so if I&rsquo;m eating only</p>
<p>one meal a day right and we know that</p>
<p>excessive amounts of protein in one meal</p>
<p>is getting converted to glucose anyway</p>
<p>what do you recommend in that type of</p>
<p>situation should I just kind of forget</p>
<p>about it and just focus mostly on the</p>
<p>vegetables and fat or do they try to</p>
<p>still try to get as much protein as they</p>
<p>can good question</p>
<p>all right what</p>
<ul>
<li>with city are you in Calgary</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m an Edmonton Edmonton they look quite</p>
<p>a larger lorry</p>
<p>have you ever been to that mall they do</p>
<p>yes I&rsquo;m actually just leaving that mall</p>
<p>right now in college I drove through</p>
<p>that and I&rsquo;m Canada we went to that mall</p>
<p>it was the most amazing things I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the largest mall in the world isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it yeah wow that probably takes the</p>
<p>whole week to get through them all so</p>
<p>alright let&rsquo;s get back to the question</p>
<p>hi I&rsquo;m the bunny okay so so Jack here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing when you&rsquo;re doing one meal a</p>
<p>day there&rsquo;s always this I always talk</p>
<p>about you know you have to get your</p>
<p>nutrients and kind of cram that in there</p>
<p>but if you were if you were to take</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say six ounces of that protein and</p>
<p>times three and that&rsquo;s a lot of protein</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s a huge amount of protein</p>
<p>and so here&rsquo;s the catch-22 your body</p>
<p>could really only absorb about 35 to 45</p>
<p>grams of protein per meal okay that</p>
<p>comes out to about six to seven ounces</p>
<p>to maybe eight ounces let&rsquo;s say six to</p>
<p>eight ounces</p>
<p>okay so anything extra is going to turn</p>
<p>the glucose now when you&rsquo;re doing in a</p>
<p>minute fasting something happens in your</p>
<p>body that&rsquo;s different than if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing several meals a day one is that</p>
<p>your body starts conserving protein it</p>
<p>starts to save protein just it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break them down as much so your protein</p>
<p>metabolism becomes very very efficient</p>
<p>so really you don&rsquo;t need as much protein</p>
<p>because your body is in a toff adji</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s recycling the protein more</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not wasting the protein so Tata G</p>
<p>is just basically the body&rsquo;s ability to</p>
<p>recycle proteins and other other things</p>
<p>so you really don&rsquo;t have to stuff</p>
<p>yourself too much with that protein</p>
<p>maybe you do eight ounces and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good and just focus on the nutrients and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about trying to get massive</p>
<p>amounts of protein in that one sitting</p>
<p>but that was a good question okay I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ready all right Karen go ahead okay</p>
<p>so I get to ask a couple questions now</p>
<p>because it took a second to ramp up but</p>
<p>one question is what to do for acne okay</p>
<p>all right then come back okay so is it</p>
<p>cystic acne or is just regular acne</p>
<p>Karen doesn&rsquo;t okay I don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>everyone with acne knows all right so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a type of acne which is really</p>
<p>painful you get on your shoulders and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it forms a cyst that comes</p>
<p>when you have something called PCOS</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome okay what is</p>
<p>that that that&rsquo;s a condition with</p>
<p>females they have these little extra</p>
<p>things growing on the ovaries and you</p>
<p>have high levels of androgens it&rsquo;s male</p>
<p>hormones and you get facial hair you</p>
<p>lose your hair you get a deeper voice</p>
<p>and you get acne other than that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>perfectly fine but that really comes</p>
<p>from the same condition that causes</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome which is</p>
<p>high insulin so if you want to fix</p>
<p>insulin resistance all you have to do is</p>
<p>lower your insulin so the program that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m recommending over and over and over</p>
<p>and over on facebooking and YouTube and</p>
<p>the book on my website and right now is</p>
<p>in a minute fasting and keep ptosis</p>
<p>those two together will help the cystic</p>
<p>acne so the the main thing it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>just the insulin dropping the insulin</p>
<p>and then if you do this and you still</p>
<p>have problems then you really need to</p>
<p>add more B vitamins because if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient and B vitamins you have all</p>
<p>sorts of skin issues vitamin A is</p>
<p>another factor that&rsquo;s why accutane which</p>
<p>is a synthetic vitamin A works but it</p>
<p>actually comes with the package creates</p>
<p>a lot of side effects I don&rsquo;t recommend</p>
<p>it but vitamin A was a beet would be</p>
<p>like cod liver oil and butter and things</p>
<p>like that so just I would just focus on</p>
<p>dropping insulin all right next question</p>
<p>Karen okay good so the next question is</p>
<p>technical but I&rsquo;m going to ask a</p>
<p>question here because I don&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>everybody watching knows this a lot of</p>
<p>conversation about macros asking</p>
<p>questions about the macros what is that</p>
<p>necro macros has to do with basically</p>
<p>the bigger categories of like proteins</p>
<p>carbohydrates</p>
<p>and fats as far as percentages or grams</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s macros and then</p>
<p>micronutrients would be like vitamins</p>
<p>minerals trace minerals essential fatty</p>
<p>acids amino acids so I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>macros are talking about like how many</p>
<p>carbohydrates how many how much protein</p>
<p>how much fat yeah okay so so do you want</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>do you want to know what the macros are</p>
<p>for the ketogenic diet or do you just</p>
<p>want to know that what that means</p>
<p>oh sure why don&rsquo;t you do that now</p>
<p>because now people will ask if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say that okay so in a ketogenic diet the</p>
<p>macros as far as a percentage goes you</p>
<p>want to keep your carbohydrates like 5%</p>
<p>of the whole calorie per day 5% that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty low that&rsquo;s like 20 to 50 grams</p>
<p>okay then the fat macros should be 75%</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot but just realize</p>
<p>percentage-wise it&rsquo;s a lot but fat is</p>
<p>more than double the calories so in</p>
<p>other words it&rsquo;s not as much as you</p>
<p>think and again a lot of this is kind of</p>
<p>you might need to get my just my booklet</p>
<p>to read up on more of it but the protein</p>
<p>should be 20% it&rsquo;s a moderate amount of</p>
<p>protein of the whole day so those are</p>
<p>the macro percentages all right Karen</p>
<p>okay good</p>
<p>what do I get another one you think you</p>
<p>answered your - I&rsquo;m gonna go to share we</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Indiana go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question yeah I was wondering um thanks</p>
<p>again for taking the time out to talk to</p>
<p>us but I was wondering I I have</p>
<p>generally eaten pretty healthy and</p>
<p>always have tried to keep meats to a</p>
<p>minimum I love bacon I you know I love</p>
<p>adding that to my dad you know it&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>of the the ketogenic diet but I was</p>
<p>wondering do you have any other</p>
<p>suggestions on how to keep you know I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to keep eating pork but do</p>
<p>you have any other suggestions on how to</p>
<p>maintain that ketogenic level and I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>simple eater - I don&rsquo;t like to cook a</p>
<p>lot okay the simpler the better how do</p>
<p>you do so you know right I know you also</p>
<p>are you willing to consume like eggs</p>
<p>things like that yes yes I am okay</p>
<p>let me give you some tips one of the</p>
<p>best protein so you can get as eggs I</p>
<p>had a lot of eggs don&rsquo;t I Karen yes</p>
<p>couple dozen a week yeah we I mean this</p>
<p>is the prod every time I go to a grocery</p>
<p>store people freak out they&rsquo;re like what</p>
<p>are you guys doing with all those eggs</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking like buy seven dozen eggs we</p>
<p>go through a week of course we have</p>
<p>twelve kids but now we only two are</p>
<p>living at home but the point is we need</p>
<p>a lot of eggs egg is the perfect protein</p>
<p>recently we went to a bed-and-breakfast</p>
<p>out in the Percival Percival Virginia</p>
<p>and they had a whole like these chickens</p>
<p>grass you know fed on the grass and they</p>
<p>were like natural grains it was freaking</p>
<p>amazing I mean we bought pretty much</p>
<p>every egg that they had duck eggs try to</p>
<p>crack those things they&rsquo;re like hard as</p>
<p>rocks very healthy I love those eggs but</p>
<p>the point is the egg is a really good</p>
<p>protein source you can do fish seafood</p>
<p>like in calamari or shrimp that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally fine crab that&rsquo;s totally fine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an unhealthy thing like people</p>
<p>think even though it&rsquo;s high in</p>
<p>cholesterol so you don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>actual you know you don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>turkey you don&rsquo;t do pork you don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>beef you can do eggs and you know what</p>
<p>another thing that&rsquo;s really good is</p>
<p>cheese has a lot of protein and very</p>
<p>little carb so if you do a grass-fed</p>
<p>cheese you can do that as well so the</p>
<p>problem becomes when you want to do</p>
<p>completely vegetarian proteins because</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s hard to find a high protein</p>
<p>source for that without getting the</p>
<p>carbs all right good question hey Debbie</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna take a question from you</p>
<p>before we go to Karen you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Tennessee go ahead hi first I want to</p>
<p>say how lucky Karen is to have such a</p>
<p>compassionate husband like you McNiel</p>
<p>care my question is first on 58 and for</p>
<p>years I&rsquo;ve done acting&rsquo;s diet when I</p>
<p>would gain weight but I haven&rsquo;t done it</p>
<p>and at least 15 years I had gastric</p>
<p>bypass which was the worst thing</p>
<p>ever did in my life that caused the bow</p>
<p>blockage which almost killed me and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had to have other surgeries which caused</p>
<p>problems which I&rsquo;ll mention in a minute</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m doing the keto I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>dinner I&rsquo;m new to your program I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>reading watching every video you have</p>
<p>but it first of all is Adkins close</p>
<p>enough to the ketogenic diet okay good</p>
<p>question all right so let me just answer</p>
<p>that the booklet that you need to you</p>
<p>should get you probably already have the</p>
<p>book but there&rsquo;s a booklet that comes</p>
<p>with it if you get on the website or you</p>
<p>can get it separately on a Kindle on</p>
<p>Amazon but the booklet that comes with</p>
<p>it is called it&rsquo;s not lose weight to get</p>
<p>healthy it&rsquo;s get healthy to lose away</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a condensed version that shows you</p>
<p>all the basics the difference between</p>
<p>actions and what I&rsquo;m recommending</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some key differences number one</p>
<p>Atkins</p>
<p>goes too high on the proteins so they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t restrict the proteins and because</p>
<p>protein can trigger insulin so I like to</p>
<p>keep the proteins between 3 to 6 ounces</p>
<p>the other thing that the Atkins diet</p>
<p>does not emphasize enough is the</p>
<p>vegetable amounts they kind of say keep</p>
<p>your carbs down including vegetables I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you unlimited vegetables ok</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you that&rsquo;s the two</p>
<p>differences that I would recommend and</p>
<p>then of course there are there avoiding</p>
<p>you know refined sugars and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>consuming fats and all that is fine so</p>
<p>that would be the tweaks that I would</p>
<p>recommend all right</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re going to write the Karen do you</p>
<p>have any questions coming up Karen first</p>
<p>of all people love you okay well I love</p>
<p>them are telling me repeatedly now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a pretty common question coming</p>
<p>up it comes up all the time people have</p>
<p>attention on calories and want to know</p>
<p>how many calories a day yeah so this</p>
<p>whole calorie thing is a bit of a less</p>
<p>important thing because it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the problem we&rsquo;ve already tested</p>
<p>this low-calorie thing for yours we know</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been proven it doesn&rsquo;t work talk to</p>
<p>anyone who&rsquo;s done low calorie diets</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna slow your metabolism</p>
<p>however that being said if you keep your</p>
<p>vegetables very very high and forget</p>
<p>about the calories and you keep your</p>
<p>proteins three to six ounces then we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>only left with one last topic and that</p>
<p>would be the fat and the fat calories so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just bring this up as you reminded</p>
<p>me Karen let&rsquo;s talk about this because</p>
<p>this is where the confusion comes in</p>
<p>this is like the wild variable that</p>
<p>people like don&rsquo;t know what should i do</p>
<p>how many fat calories when I say 75% of</p>
<p>your diet should be college like oh my</p>
<p>god that&rsquo;s like huge chunks of lard</p>
<p>right no it&rsquo;s actually not that much in</p>
<p>the booklet I show pictures so I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really show you pictures right here but</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s a couple tips on that</p>
<p>if you start out doing this and you do</p>
<p>too much protein you&rsquo;re gonna get right</p>
<p>shoulder pain and headaches because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna overload your gallbladder you can</p>
<p>feel bloated it&rsquo;s gonna hit a nerve and</p>
<p>go right through the right shoulder area</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you know you have too</p>
<p>much if you don&rsquo;t have enough fat you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to be able to make it from one</p>
<p>meal to the next because you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be starving if you specially have low</p>
<p>blood sugars so you need to kind of</p>
<p>adjust that back and forth so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different for everyone in the beginning</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need more fat then later on</p>
<p>as your body adapts to ketosis and your</p>
<p>body is burning fat you want your body</p>
<p>to burn your own fat not necessarily the</p>
<p>diet fat that you&rsquo;re consuming so those</p>
<p>are some real key principles to focus on</p>
<p>because just go gradual and see what</p>
<p>your sweet spot is I mean I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>care if it&rsquo;s a lot of fat in the</p>
<p>beginning because we&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>your body to adapt as long as it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>too much and it&rsquo;s gonna overload your</p>
<p>ability to digest the fat that&rsquo;s the key</p>
<p>Keith&rsquo;s point and I just wanted to take</p>
<p>a side note here to let everyone know</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s been a lot of questions</p>
<p>the last couple of days will we be doing</p>
<p>a Black Friday special yes we are if you</p>
<p>go to the site it&rsquo;s Black Friday 20% off</p>
<p>all the supplements and books go to dr.</p>
<p>Byrd calm but here&rsquo;s what you have to do</p>
<p>you have to type in the secret code</p>
<p>which is dr. Burke once you check out Dr</p>
<p>BER</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s DRB ERG there&rsquo;s a couple new</p>
<p>products one is this really cool one</p>
<p>right here this is the electrolytes in a</p>
<p>little box this is kind of a grab-and-go</p>
<p>they come in little packets so you can</p>
<p>you know just go ahead and stick this in</p>
<p>your water because a lot of people</p>
<p>wanted to carry it around so this is</p>
<p>really cool</p>
<p>this one you may have known about this</p>
<p>is the nutritional yeast product I</p>
<p>really like this because this is a non</p>
<p>fortified nutritional yeast you take it</p>
<p>as a tablet</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no synthetics and it has b12</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s natural one little thing the</p>
<p>pills are a little bit bigger but you</p>
<p>can cut them in half and swallow them</p>
<p>but especially like b1 this is really</p>
<p>will help you for your stress and also</p>
<p>to do the key to adaptation do you like</p>
<p>these kind I love them I love them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really good so those and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also we have a keto kit we&rsquo;re just put</p>
<p>together you can check that on the site</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s only for today so you can check</p>
<p>it out all right</p>
<p>this sales only for today yes it is no</p>
<p>this is only good for today no I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>kidding</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only selling it then we&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>it off forever okay pick me okay Karen</p>
<p>you have a question</p>
<p>okay yes explain how keto diet or</p>
<p>whatever your recommendation is for</p>
<p>allergies and asthma okay well first of</p>
<p>all if we let&rsquo;s just take asthma for</p>
<p>example okay</p>
<p>asthma is kids that go out in the Sun in</p>
<p>the summer all of a sudden they&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>that have asthma all of a sudden their</p>
<p>symptoms go away and that&rsquo;s because the</p>
<p>vitamin D vitamin D is great for the</p>
<p>immune system and so a lot of times</p>
<p>asthma will be helped by vitamin D but</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s underneath that is an adrenal</p>
<p>issue that is setting the person up for</p>
<p>a long issues because what is the</p>
<p>treatment for allergies I&rsquo;m sorry asthma</p>
<p>that most people have to take it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Branko steroid and Hallam&rsquo;s right Karen</p>
<p>prednisone right so what happens is that</p>
<p>what is that that&rsquo;s adrenal hormone so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking adrenal hormones because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re running out of adrenal hormones</p>
<p>so if they support the adrenal you can</p>
<p>actually improve</p>
<p>asthma now as far as allergies that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>adrenal issue as well I should do a</p>
<p>video on specifically this topic because</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the treatment for a lot of even</p>
<p>like really severe allergies they you</p>
<p>get an EpiPen epinephrine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>adrenaline that&rsquo;s an adrenal hormone</p>
<p>again adrenal so there&rsquo;s a connection</p>
<p>there but when you do the Kido in a</p>
<p>minute fasting it starts to clean up the</p>
<p>the microbes the the fungus the mold the</p>
<p>bacterias that shouldn&rsquo;t be there</p>
<p>infected cells so it&rsquo;s really really</p>
<p>really good for the immune system and</p>
<p>one last thing Karen 80% of your immune</p>
<p>system is in your GI system so when you</p>
<p>do in a minute fasting my GI your</p>
<p>gastrointestinal your gut okay sorry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrible I think it&rsquo;s in your 80%</p>
<p>of your immune system is in our</p>
<p>digestive system so when you do in a</p>
<p>minute fasting you actually greatly take</p>
<p>the stress off here immune system</p>
<p>indirectly and you improve those</p>
<p>conditions so yes I would reckon that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the long version to tell you yes to help</p>
<p>yourself</p>
<p>go in go in those two actions all right</p>
<p>now Debbie you&rsquo;re from Tennessee I think</p>
<p>I just answered your question but I</p>
<p>wanted to make sure if you&rsquo;re okay on</p>
<p>that so I&rsquo;m gonna go to Meghan from</p>
<p>Georgia you had a question about liver</p>
<p>body type go ahead yes I am 37 and have</p>
<p>been kind of trying to figure out my</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with my blood sugar and</p>
<p>body gut and all that for years and I</p>
<p>found you so I&rsquo;m very thankful to</p>
<p>started learning from you and I took the</p>
<p>assessment and I&rsquo;m a primary liver type</p>
<p>but I am I&rsquo;m not needing to lose weight</p>
<p>and have been thin my whole life kind of</p>
<p>an anomaly to the endocrinologist and</p>
<p>having high high blood sugar a 1c about</p>
<p>6.4 and thyroid low thyroid</p>
<p>so as I looked at your program and it</p>
<p>says for the liver body type to kind of</p>
<p>hold back a little bit on the fats</p>
<p>I wondered can I go into ketosis have</p>
<p>holding back on the fats when I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>to go into ketosis before I&rsquo;ve had pain</p>
<p>in the right side and issues with the</p>
<p>liver although I was not doing all the</p>
<p>greens that you recommend okay</p>
<p>good question very good question so this</p>
<p>brings up a really good point people</p>
<p>assume that if you&rsquo;re skinny all your</p>
<p>blood sugar levels and you&rsquo;re inside of</p>
<p>your body is all healthy not necessarily</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s just as many thin people that</p>
<p>have internal stuff that&rsquo;s not right as</p>
<p>well as overweight people so this is a</p>
<p>good example where you have your a1c a1c</p>
<p>is an average of blood sugars for three</p>
<p>months so it kind of gives you what your</p>
<p>normal is six point four is a bit on the</p>
<p>high side it should be like five I think</p>
<p>the normal cutoff would be like five</p>
<p>point four so it&rsquo;s a little too high so</p>
<p>we have a blood sugar problem adrenal</p>
<p>body types can&rsquo;t tolerate as much fat</p>
<p>because the gall bladders involved right</p>
<p>so here you are trying to do this and</p>
<p>you get this full sensation on the right</p>
<p>side and you might have a gallbladder</p>
<p>issue so what I&rsquo;m gonna recommend is</p>
<p>that you have the vegetables in there to</p>
<p>offset the heavy protein and the fat</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s all you really need to do</p>
<p>and maybe adjust the fat so your fat is</p>
<p>not like crazy high and you can digest</p>
<p>it because the heavy fats tend to Oh</p>
<p>Karen wait what you doing over there</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just eating some pie middle okay</p>
<p>and by the way that&rsquo;s a sugar-free pie</p>
<p>right okay she&rsquo;s okay okay so the point</p>
<p>is that you can do fats but just offset</p>
<p>it with the vegetables and you should be</p>
<p>fine but you might have to work up to</p>
<p>that to strengthen it and you that way</p>
<p>your blood sugar values will come right</p>
<p>down to a normal level and you&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>really happy okay good question so Karen</p>
<p>did you enjoy that little treat there</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>no sugar and I think we have some</p>
<p>recipes on their site for these pies and</p>
<p>pecan what did you make yesterday</p>
<p>yesterday for dessert yeah - pecan pies</p>
<p>a cheesecake a pumpkin pie and a</p>
<p>strawberry pie a strawberry pie come on</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible so the crust was made</p>
<p>from almond flour right yeah that was</p>
<p>amazing</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s go right to Chris you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>New Jersey you had a question about</p>
<p>nosebleeds go ahead</p>
<p>yes um hi dr. Berg thank you so much for</p>
<p>all that you do I really appreciate it</p>
<p>and um I&rsquo;ve been following you for a</p>
<p>long time I&rsquo;m sorry Oh awesome my</p>
<p>pleasure I have your book I just</p>
<p>recently received it and I haven&rsquo;t had a</p>
<p>chance to you know get into it because I</p>
<p>just had my dad move in with us it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bit crazy right now but my</p>
<p>question is I started keto in June cuz</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a teacher and by the and I was</p>
<p>feeling great losing weight not feeling</p>
<p>hungry doing as much salad as possible</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a big salad eater low</p>
<p>sweet tooth my whole life and then right</p>
<p>before school started I went to visit a</p>
<p>colleague of mine who just had a baby</p>
<p>and I was sitting in her living room and</p>
<p>I was like you know how you feel like</p>
<p>you knows he&rsquo;s just gonna run and I put</p>
<p>my hand up to my face and I I had a</p>
<p>nosebleed and I never in my whole life</p>
<p>even as a child never had a nosebleed so</p>
<p>I got a little worried and I started to</p>
<p>think where did this come from because</p>
<p>it was the only thing I was doing</p>
<p>differently was following this diet so I</p>
<p>googled it and there was something out</p>
<p>there so I immediately threw a carbon to</p>
<p>my diet a doughnut cuz I got i got</p>
<p>fearful but I only had the nosebleed two</p>
<p>days like at night and then the next</p>
<p>morning my mistake was I got little</p>
<p>worried and upset and I took two</p>
<p>excedrin the night before so needless to</p>
<p>say the nosebleed the next day was like</p>
<p>almost like a hemorrhage because my</p>
<p>blood was so thin from the excedrin yeah</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was related and I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had one since but I did go back</p>
<p>on keto so I&rsquo;m presently back doing it</p>
<p>because I felt great okay let me ask you</p>
<p>some questions about</p>
<p>do you have a history of any sinus</p>
<p>issues well yeah I kind of have like</p>
<p>post nasal drip</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t yeah I don&rsquo;t have that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>only thing I know that I have I mean I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have any problems that&rsquo;s right I</p>
<p>need to be treated for I&rsquo;m not taking</p>
<p>any medication before before you did the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet were you on any</p>
<p>medications no I&rsquo;m on none I&rsquo;m 54 and</p>
<p>pretty okay okay with blood pressure you</p>
<p>know every keep up to date with all my</p>
<p>doctor appointments and so blood sugar</p>
<p>is always good okay well let me just</p>
<p>kind of give you the three top things</p>
<p>that would cause a nosebleed just so</p>
<p>this is an interesting point low vitamin</p>
<p>D levels would do this so I&rsquo;m glad that</p>
<p>it cleared up and it should be fine but</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re low on vitamin D and the best</p>
<p>source of vitamin D is virgin cod liver</p>
<p>oil it&rsquo;s awesome and the Sun okay so</p>
<p>those two are the best sources of</p>
<p>vitamin D the other cause of those</p>
<p>blades would be low vitamin C levels</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t sound like that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>problem if you&rsquo;re low in vitamin C</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not having that</p>
<p>vegetables that could cause it because</p>
<p>if you think about the symptom from</p>
<p>vitamin C a mild version of scurvy which</p>
<p>is like bleeding gums because it affects</p>
<p>the capillaries in the collagen can</p>
<p>happen in the nose it&rsquo;s rare but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one thing especially people that do</p>
<p>synthetic vitamin C or they do know</p>
<p>vegetables so that&rsquo;s a common thing also</p>
<p>insulin resistance will cause an ability</p>
<p>to absorb vitamin C so that could be</p>
<p>another situation but typically the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet should not create any</p>
<p>deficiencies that cause this it should</p>
<p>improve it over time the last thing I</p>
<p>would say if someone was on a blood</p>
<p>thinner of course that would do it or if</p>
<p>they have a sinus issue and it got</p>
<p>irritated and then that can cause the</p>
<p>bleeding but I think you&rsquo;re fine now but</p>
<p>those are some points that I would</p>
<p>recommend so but that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>interesting question I&rsquo;m gonna take a</p>
<p>question from Davion from Arizona go</p>
<p>honey</p>
<p>yummy then you can ask a question are</p>
<p>you there I&rsquo;m a burger yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here good it&rsquo;s actually Java and</p>
<p>Abhiyan that&rsquo;s my name Davian</p>
<p>okay alright well so I&rsquo;m so here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve done keto three times</p>
<p>and what I mean by three times I mean I</p>
<p>failed three times</p>
<p>mm-hmm so the first time I did it was</p>
<p>about six months ago and I did it for</p>
<p>six days and what what killed me was my</p>
<p>sugar cravings that got me out of it the</p>
<p>first time second time was hungry so I</p>
<p>was able to because I was doing it was</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and I actually</p>
<p>worked my way up to like maybe 16 hours</p>
<p>fasting him feeling like feeling fine</p>
<p>but when it was time to eat it just</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>and I would break it then the last time</p>
<p>which was a couple about a couple weeks</p>
<p>ago I I worked my way up to about 20 22</p>
<p>hours fasting comfortably and I just I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know it just the same thing hunger</p>
<p>I just I just couldn&rsquo;t stay consistent</p>
<p>you know okay and so I yeah I do I did</p>
<p>it for two weeks so I work my weights</p>
<p>for two weeks but I just need help</p>
<p>trying to yeah I find a fuel plant so I</p>
<p>could officiate you alright let me just</p>
<p>tell you what what I would do if I were</p>
<p>you I think that you&rsquo;re going into this</p>
<p>a little bit too fast I think I would</p>
<p>gradually work into it to go that many</p>
<p>hours without eating especially if you</p>
<p>probably have a hypoglycemic or low</p>
<p>blood sugar issue you&rsquo;re gonna like oh</p>
<p>my gosh I&rsquo;m starving you should do this</p>
<p>so gradual so it&rsquo;s really really</p>
<p>comfortable and what I mean by that is</p>
<p>you start with three meals a day and</p>
<p>these graduates start pushing up your</p>
<p>breakfast an hour an hour an hour until</p>
<p>you get to two meals a day okay and then</p>
<p>you can start to push up these meals</p>
<p>closer and closer together by adding</p>
<p>more fat at the meal if you are craving</p>
<p>sweets when you&rsquo;re doing this all this</p>
<p>means is you haven&rsquo;t adapted yet and you</p>
<p>have to give it more time if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hungry between the meals what that means</p>
<p>is you haven&rsquo;t adapted and you just have</p>
<p>to go more gradually and back down but</p>
<p>if done correctly hunger and cravings</p>
<p>will completely go away to the point</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>completely handled and so the other</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s missing is the amount of</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not doing the vegetables</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna find it might not work</p>
<p>because you need the potassium to help</p>
<p>this all magically work out nicely</p>
<p>alright so those are the points that I</p>
<p>would recommend I think and then it will</p>
<p>work for you all right Karen over to you</p>
<p>okay I have the best job in the world</p>
<p>because I get to see all these people</p>
<p>communicating to us all the time it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hysterical and we love you guys too</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s a lot of questions on on</p>
<p>different social media platforms about</p>
<p>headaches and migraines and there are a</p>
<p>variety of questions but I&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>that one as my first but I reserve the</p>
<p>right to have another question all right</p>
<p>you get two questions every five minutes</p>
<p>all right so now the pedak Sande</p>
<p>migraines then the number one cause for</p>
<p>headaches and migraines is related to</p>
<p>the gallbladder so let&rsquo;s talk about that</p>
<p>first</p>
<p>if the gallbladder is sluggish or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lacking bile or it&rsquo;s irritated because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing to me to the wrong foods</p>
<p>especially you know it&rsquo;s the really the</p>
<p>carbs and the junk food that destroy the</p>
<p>gallbladder more than the fat fat will</p>
<p>do it too but not if you don&rsquo;t consume</p>
<p>all that other stuff with it but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an herb that&rsquo;s connected underneath the</p>
<p>right side on the diaphragm that when</p>
<p>the gallbladder swells up it puts</p>
<p>pressure on the nerve and it goes to the</p>
<p>right side it goes all up to your head</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s on the right side of</p>
<p>the head the way that you would know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s the gallbladder and here you</p>
<p>are with a headache just press on the</p>
<p>gallbladder for a minute and see if it</p>
<p>gives you relief and all of a sudden wow</p>
<p>my headaches gone then we know it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>the other cause of headaches is he it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a subclinical blood sugar issue it&rsquo;s low</p>
<p>blood sugar it&rsquo;s called hypoglycemia</p>
<p>because your brain one of the fuels that</p>
<p>it runs on if you&rsquo;re not in ketosis is</p>
<p>glucose it loves glucose so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>low on glucose because you have insulin</p>
<p>resistance which is pre-diabetes and you</p>
<p>can have normal blood sugars and have</p>
<p>this by the way that&rsquo;s why you have to</p>
<p>check your fasting insulin level if you</p>
<p>really want to figure this out</p>
<p>but if the brain doesn&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>glucose it will start creating all sorts</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>in the vascular system and cause</p>
<p>headaches and migraines so if you were</p>
<p>to fix the blood sugar problem insulin</p>
<p>resistance and do what I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>the headaches should go away another</p>
<p>cause of headaches which is more rare is</p>
<p>sinus stuff and then the other one would</p>
<p>be an old head injury and I did a video</p>
<p>on headaches and you can actually type</p>
<p>on Google headaches or migraines and dr.</p>
<p>Berg and find it and I even show you the</p>
<p>technique on how to improve damage from</p>
<p>a head injury with acupressure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty cool so check it out</p>
<p>all right question I mean Karen next</p>
<p>question Gary misses question more</p>
<p>question Matt wants to know if he can</p>
<p>marry me Matt we you can&rsquo;t marry her but</p>
<p>you can rent her out occasionally no I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just kidding now you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>was just teasing my dry sense of humor</p>
<p>so no Matt sorry okay she&rsquo;s taking okay</p>
<p>a lot of questions it might you might</p>
<p>want to say something on the keto course</p>
<p>okay so questions on the keto course no</p>
<p>asking about it how to get it oh if you</p>
<p>are on Facebook all you have to do go to</p>
<p>messenger and swipe up and type under</p>
<p>keto course or just keto I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>key to of course and then you should get</p>
<p>the course that will explain how to do</p>
<p>this if you&rsquo;re on youtube what you do is</p>
<p>go down in the script description</p>
<p>underneath the video and there should be</p>
<p>a button there that you can go to</p>
<p>Facebook and also type the keto course</p>
<p>because that way you can take the course</p>
<p>and I just want to mention this one</p>
<p>thing there&rsquo;s a lot of extra cool stuff</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m Instagram right now releasing</p>
<p>videos and there&rsquo;s short ones they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like 15-second tips so you if you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>YouTube or Facebook definitely go there</p>
<p>and sign up and then also if you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>youtube go to Facebook I have additional</p>
<p>stuff on there that you might not see in</p>
<p>YouTube and if you&rsquo;re on Facebook go to</p>
<p>YouTube because I have additional videos</p>
<p>on there so I have a lot of different</p>
<p>content I just want to encourage you to</p>
<p>share</p>
<p>also with your friends and family</p>
<p>because if you like helping people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you want to do because I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>give a lot of great content and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s all about alright question yep</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>can you think of a condition that keto</p>
<p>would not be good for that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good question like the contraindications</p>
<p>dakedo and that was my question actually</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any condition in fact</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good if someone has kidney</p>
<p>problems if someone has liver damage if</p>
<p>someone has cancer it&rsquo;s good if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>even breastfeeding or if you&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>the point I will mention Karen is in a</p>
<p>minute fasting might not be good if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pregnant because you may need a</p>
<p>little bit more food to kind of just</p>
<p>handle that so it&rsquo;s a little tricky when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pregnant or even breastfeeding so</p>
<p>those are the two things I would say</p>
<p>like kind of watch out for and then also</p>
<p>one last thing Karen if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>hypoglycemic it is the absolute best</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>except you want to do it gradually the</p>
<p>number one recommendation for</p>
<p>hypoglycemia or low blood sugar out</p>
<p>there is kind of like everyone is</p>
<p>agreeing with is eat frequent meals a</p>
<p>day and eat sugar if your blood sugar</p>
<p>drops that is the worst advice you could</p>
<p>ever get you want to gradually go into</p>
<p>this do ketta in a minute fasting so you</p>
<p>can correct hypoglycemia which is very</p>
<p>very common okay alright so now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna take a question from Neela from</p>
<p>California go ahead you were on the air</p>
<p>hi dr. Berg thank you so much hi I I</p>
<p>really appreciate all the information</p>
<p>you make it so easy to understand I</p>
<p>first based on your advice work on just</p>
<p>being healthy I need to lose maybe 20</p>
<p>pounds maybe 25 but I&rsquo;m focusing and</p>
<p>getting healthy and since I have started</p>
<p>following your advice</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Kido and even trying intermittent</p>
<p>fasting my headaches went away my brain</p>
<p>fog went away well and my main thing was</p>
<p>stress and anxiety I&rsquo;m worried you know</p>
<p>business and work so I am taking you a</p>
<p>general support formula and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>great so thank you so much my question</p>
<p>oh thank you my question is when I do</p>
<p>smoothie with greens I do eat a lot of</p>
<p>greens or all greens just solids</p>
<p>vegetables and I just blend them that</p>
<p>fiber retain its quality for the gut or</p>
<p>just solid the better like should you</p>
<p>would is there a difference between</p>
<p>blending it or eating it is that what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying yeah yeah good question</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re obviously the ideal scene</p>
<p>would be to chew it and consume that 10</p>
<p>cups of salad some people might need to</p>
<p>blend it it&rsquo;s a lot easier you it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of actually it&rsquo;s a minor point</p>
<p>really sometimes I&rsquo;ll do the blending</p>
<p>sometimes I&rsquo;ll do the chewing some</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t used to doing that much</p>
<p>vegetation so I would blend it whatever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more convenient you&rsquo;re still gonna</p>
<p>get the fiber it&rsquo;s still gonna be fine</p>
<p>but when you chew it you just get a</p>
<p>little bit more breakdown and for</p>
<p>certain people that have maybe weakness</p>
<p>within the stomach or the digestive</p>
<p>tract maybe they should stick with</p>
<p>chewing it but I&rsquo;ve not seen a big</p>
<p>problem with that but that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>and I just wanted to mention next week</p>
<p>you from now on and fridays we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>be doing this show at 11 o&rsquo;clock in the</p>
<p>morning a.m. Eastern Standard Time</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of people from</p>
<p>California but don&rsquo;t get up until later</p>
<p>so that way we can actually make it</p>
<p>available for everyone ok so that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a side point I will send you a video on</p>
<p>that so Karen do you have a quick</p>
<p>question yes I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>go away yeah take another cup okay</p>
<p>Nina you&rsquo;re from Maryland you had a</p>
<p>question hi dr. Berg I really thank you</p>
<p>for everything that you do</p>
<p>I started your program since July and so</p>
<p>far I lost 23 pounds and I was pretty</p>
<p>good and I take all the supplements that</p>
<p>you suggest that for the adrenals like</p>
<p>fatigue and gall bladder formula because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t moved my gallbladder</p>
<p>and I also take the white I mean K and</p>
<p>d3 from you and her loss you know</p>
<p>formula from your line my year cousins I</p>
<p>have a history of osteoporosis severe</p>
<p>osteoporosis my latest bone density scan</p>
<p>was minus four point six and I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>on a reclassed shot for you know every</p>
<p>other years and every two years for the</p>
<p>past six years and of course it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work Nadia she wants to put me my doctor</p>
<p>wants to put me in another injection</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s every six months that I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I should go for it or not but</p>
<p>recently I heard something from one of</p>
<p>my family that he&rsquo;s a chiropractor as</p>
<p>well that he told me being in a Cheeto</p>
<p>is not good for us to process the Cheeto</p>
<p>stage make let me let me explain because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really important point okay let</p>
<p>me just can explain it there&rsquo;s some data</p>
<p>on Quito that it you lose calcium</p>
<p>through the urine so that oh my gosh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get osteoporosis let me</p>
<p>tell you something the amount of calcium</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna lose it&rsquo;s so minor its</p>
<p>insignificant the benefit of doing keto</p>
<p>and in a minute a saying is it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>fix insulin resistance and that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>allow your cells to a finally absorbing</p>
<p>the minerals that you need not just</p>
<p>potassium but calcium as well and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going and even the fat type of vitamins</p>
<p>that you need and the protein because a</p>
<p>lot of your bone is made out of protein</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>no acids so it&rsquo;s absolutely the best</p>
<p>thing to do but I don&rsquo;t recommend</p>
<p>calcium to a lot of people but if they</p>
<p>have osteopenia or osteoporosis that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one exception that you probably get</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need some high-quality food</p>
<p>based calcium on a regular basis and to</p>
<p>actually improve osteoporosis what you</p>
<p>have to realize it&rsquo;s a pretty serious</p>
<p>situation where your your bones are</p>
<p>losing a lot of stuff and the point I</p>
<p>want to bring up is that it just takes a</p>
<p>long time it&rsquo;s going to take you 6 plus</p>
<p>years to really start building that back</p>
<p>up so don&rsquo;t give up stay consistent keep</p>
<p>doing what you&rsquo;re doing and over time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll get better and better and better</p>
<p>and probably whatever I&rsquo;m recommending</p>
<p>for vitamin k2 double that vitamin k2 is</p>
<p>the key vitamin that makes your bones</p>
<p>really really strong but you want to</p>
<p>take that in the morning with fat so you</p>
<p>want a little add a little oil or fat to</p>
<p>it because it&rsquo;ll of starve absorbing a</p>
<p>lot better ok alright so now I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>give Karen a chance to ask a question</p>
<p>give me a chance okay so we have a bunch</p>
<p>of questions about sleeping not sleeping</p>
<p>waking up several times in the middle of</p>
<p>the night what can be done about that</p>
<p>okay so the the sleeping usually one</p>
<p>really quick tip is to get the filters</p>
<p>in the light because on your on your I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry your computer because the computer</p>
<p>gives off a kind of a blue light which</p>
<p>is very irritating to the eye so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the computer a lot that will</p>
<p>canna keep you awake so there&rsquo;s a filter</p>
<p>that you can and I did a video on this</p>
<p>LED computer screen and sleeping you can</p>
<p>get a free filter and then tone it down</p>
<p>to more of a yellow light it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>candle light and it&rsquo;s really good for</p>
<p>the eyes and that will help your sleep</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing with sleep sleep</p>
<p>usually comes from something could be a</p>
<p>bladder issue it could be a digestive</p>
<p>issue or it could be a stress issue so I</p>
<p>would focus on reducing stress I have a</p>
<p>sleep formula that it targets the stress</p>
<p>point you probably want to do that</p>
<p>before bed but the point is that you</p>
<p>want to go for long walks and I have</p>
<p>videos on how to do acupressure to your</p>
<p>adrenals to help you calm down before</p>
<p>sleep I do that every</p>
<p>before I go to sleep so that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>would focus on is something that comes</p>
<p>underneath the sleep which is usually</p>
<p>stress an adrenal Drina type fatigue</p>
<p>all right so because we have a lot of</p>
<p>questions that&rsquo;s all I wanted to point</p>
<p>out in that okay I get another one</p>
<p>yeah so here&rsquo;s an interesting myth you</p>
<p>can address quickly I&rsquo;ve heard if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat many times during the day when</p>
<p>you do it your body will store</p>
<p>everything into fat making you gain</p>
<p>weight how does intermittent fasting</p>
<p>help you lose weight okay well this is</p>
<p>the thing where people think that</p>
<p>anything anything more than the calories</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re burning is going to be</p>
<p>converted into fat well you not</p>
<p>necessarily it really depends on the</p>
<p>type of karbala the type of calorie that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with the main thing you</p>
<p>need to know and what&rsquo;s omitted in even</p>
<p>in even pre med school or actually</p>
<p>medical school is this relationship</p>
<p>between the insulin factor the hormone</p>
<p>factor and how it relates to calories if</p>
<p>you focus on keep your insulin as low as</p>
<p>possible to normal</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re gonna burn more fat and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna prevent gaining more</p>
<p>converting these calories into fat so I</p>
<p>would not again have this idea this</p>
<p>fixed idea that everything is converted</p>
<p>to fat I would look at the type of</p>
<p>calories and relationship to the</p>
<p>hormones so I answered half of the</p>
<p>question what was the other half care</p>
<p>was it on memory what was it what was</p>
<p>that I did no it wasn&rsquo;t a two-part</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>yeah it was you said you said with the</p>
<p>calories and then there was one last</p>
<p>part after that I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m reading</p>
<p>like 47 other questions right now really</p>
<p>bad dr. Berg you it was a really good</p>
<p>question you should write it down in</p>
<p>your notebook Oh in a minute fasting how</p>
<p>does in a minute fasting see I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>that every minute fasting</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s all the same question in a minute</p>
<p>fasting does something a little bit cool</p>
<p>I mean a little bit different what it</p>
<p>does is it causes it first of all it</p>
<p>takes the stress off your digestive</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>it takes the stress off the gallbladder</p>
<p>it puts your body into a state where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re preserving proteins and but the</p>
<p>main thing it does is it lowers insulin</p>
<p>because every time you eat you stimulate</p>
<p>insulin so anything that you could do</p>
<p>the lower insulin and heal insulin</p>
<p>resistance you&rsquo;re gonna do very well</p>
<p>especially for if you&rsquo;re pre-diabetic or</p>
<p>a diabetic or you want to lose weight so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really important it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not about the calorie cutting that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>secondary okay good I have another</p>
<p>question now a lot of people saying</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting hungry</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t I can&rsquo;t wait that long in</p>
<p>between meals and getting hungry yeah</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re gonna get</p>
<p>hungry if you eat every time you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get hungry so and I&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>kind of give you an example let&rsquo;s say in</p>
<p>the morning like right now it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>949 I didn&rsquo;t eat anything I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>tiny hungry but it&rsquo;ll go away within you</p>
<p>know now we&rsquo;re just kind of like I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>terrible hugging but yeah you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>go through a little bit of that maybe</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden like I&rsquo;m fat</p>
<p>burning again so it kind of goes in</p>
<p>waves especially in the morning because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s higher level of cortisol and</p>
<p>adrenaline going on that might be kind</p>
<p>of affecting your blood Sugar&rsquo;s but then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna adapt right in the fat burn</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re not gonna be hungry the</p>
<p>point you have to realize is that you</p>
<p>have to consume more fat at the meal and</p>
<p>healthy foods like vegetables to be able</p>
<p>to fix insulin resistance convert your</p>
<p>body to fat-burning to the point where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not hungry</p>
<p>and then you want to do that</p>
<p>consistently and not cheat because as</p>
<p>soon as you add a meal in there all of a</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re gonna spike in so a little</p>
<p>bit it&rsquo;s going to drop down and now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really hungry so it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really gonna have to be</p>
<p>discipline over a period of time to</p>
<p>really fix especially around the</p>
<p>holidays so you might be hungry right</p>
<p>now because you just had Thanksgiving</p>
<p>okay I have another question yeah this</p>
<p>is the third one I know I know but okay</p>
<p>go ahead okay so I&rsquo;ve got a ghulam this</p>
<p>into one question and then you can</p>
<p>handle it however things that grow</p>
<p>polyps cysts tumors skin tags things</p>
<p>like this there&rsquo;s a lot of questions on</p>
<p>this kind of stuff can keto help yeah</p>
<p>okay next question</p>
<p>ya know it does help because</p>
<p>Kito actually reduces insulin insulin is</p>
<p>the hormone that makes things grow and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why like Baker cysts for example</p>
<p>or polyps that&rsquo;s really high levels of</p>
<p>insulin insulin is the type of hormone</p>
<p>called anabolic where it&rsquo;s a builds up</p>
<p>tissue so by doing that and also in</p>
<p>combination with vitamin b1 from</p>
<p>nutritional yeast because b1</p>
<p>deficiencies can also exaggerate the</p>
<p>growth of cysts so if you have cysts and</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>take the b1 or nutritional yeast and</p>
<p>that will actually help you and also</p>
<p>estrogen dominance will do it too so</p>
<p>these are all things that are important</p>
<p>but the most important thing is to drop</p>
<p>insulin by doing Aikido in a minute</p>
<p>fasting to really correct that imbalance</p>
<p>and for those of you that are just kind</p>
<p>of coming on I want to just kind of give</p>
<p>you another little reminder that today</p>
<p>is Black Friday and we are doing a huge</p>
<p>huge special on our website dr. Berger</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s a no brainer it&rsquo;s awesome you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna learn a lot and I&rsquo;m giving a lot</p>
<p>of free information away on that ok so</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m gonna go to the next caller</p>
<p>which cool what&rsquo;s cool is I just</p>
<p>realized that I can see a timer who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been on hold the longest so now I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>able to do this correctly so Reggie</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Indiana you had a question</p>
<p>yes oh hi dr. Berg love my videos Thanks</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing intermittent fasting for</p>
<p>about six months now and I&rsquo;ve lost 80</p>
<p>pounds and I really really loved it one</p>
<p>mill of day my question is I saw</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>deals about dry fastening and this is</p>
<p>possibly be great so what do you thought</p>
<p>about doing it dry fast now are you</p>
<p>talking about just reducing your liquids</p>
<p>or explain dry fast to me oh no no</p>
<p>liquid no food</p>
<p>they used a lot of benefits and I was</p>
<p>wondering about that it&rsquo;s the best path</p>
<p>to do it&rsquo;s like three days faster no</p>
<p>food and no water and opposed to very</p>
<p>beneficial for your body okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really good question I&rsquo;m not opposed</p>
<p>to doing that as long as when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating you&rsquo;re getting all the nutrients</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re gonna do something</p>
<p>long-term and you start skipping like</p>
<p>three days and you go to a day the only</p>
<p>thing you have to watch out for is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to greatly enhance</p>
<p>your diet with supplements because the</p>
<p>food nowadays just doesn&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>nutrients and so you may end up with</p>
<p>kind of some hair loss and you know your</p>
<p>teeth might fall out things like that</p>
<p>other than that you&rsquo;d be fine but if you</p>
<p>do this consistently where you just do</p>
<p>one meal it might be a little bit better</p>
<p>but the advantage of doing a couple days</p>
<p>without eating or even drinking it</p>
<p>really puts your body into some serious</p>
<p>etaf adji and again I&rsquo;m not promoting</p>
<p>this I&rsquo;m just telling you I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>against it because of the principle of</p>
<p>our how our bodies were designed</p>
<p>yeah at Apogee is a is an amazing</p>
<p>anti-aging condition where you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not eating and you are stimulating a</p>
<p>recycling effect of all the old infected</p>
<p>damaged parts of your cells you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>clearing up and recycling and making new</p>
<p>proteins in the cell it&rsquo;s kind of like a</p>
<p>recycling cleaning out the junk getting</p>
<p>rid of the bacteria fungus mold and</p>
<p>yeast and Candida out of the cells so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the benefit of it your skin will</p>
<p>be amazing and if you look at in ancient</p>
<p>times I mean man has developed not</p>
<p>eating three meals a day they&rsquo;d be lucky</p>
<p>one time they get a meal and the next</p>
<p>time maybe a couple days later they get</p>
<p>a couple meals so our bodies are</p>
<p>designed for that and it&rsquo;s a it almost</p>
<p>makes sense that that&rsquo;s kind of what we</p>
<p>need I think it&rsquo;s hard to do but</p>
<p>as far as liquids and things I mean you</p>
<p>really can&rsquo;t survive more than several</p>
<p>days without liquid so I wouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>restrict your water I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help you but as far as food I</p>
<p>mean if you can do it it takes a lot of</p>
<p>discipline it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not opposed</p>
<p>to it all right William you are from</p>
<p>Miami you had a question about the Quito</p>
<p>yes sir first of all I want to thank you</p>
<p>man I started cute kiddo because of you</p>
<p>and I have lost 25 pounds I still want</p>
<p>to look ten more my question is what</p>
<p>started taking CLA and we&rsquo;re working out</p>
<p>a lot okay</p>
<p>good question so si CLA is a type of fat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really good for a fat burning you</p>
<p>can even get get it from doing meats and</p>
<p>things like that</p>
<p>make sure it&rsquo;s grass-fed if you take as</p>
<p>a supplement</p>
<p>I have heard some mixed reviews</p>
<p>sometimes it makes a big difference</p>
<p>sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not opposed to</p>
<p>taking it but it&rsquo;s a healthy fat that</p>
<p>you also get from food so it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>these things that I&rsquo;ve just run going to</p>
<p>try it and see if it helps you it may or</p>
<p>may not help you but one last point</p>
<p>about that about fats in general one of</p>
<p>the missing links that people need to</p>
<p>know about is the point on having enough</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids and not as many</p>
<p>omega-6 fatty acids if we look at over</p>
<p>the period when obesity started it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>date coincidence when we went we started</p>
<p>a low-fat diet but in fact what happened</p>
<p>is we cut out the saturated fats a</p>
<p>little bit but the vegetable oils like</p>
<p>corn canola soy went skyrocketed and so</p>
<p>did the sugar so I bet you that create a</p>
<p>lot of problem for people because when</p>
<p>you have that many that much fat which</p>
<p>is omega-6 fatty acids which is not what</p>
<p>you want especially in GMO it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>create a lot of inflammatory conditions</p>
<p>so if you do some grass-fed healthy fats</p>
<p>and omega-3 which</p>
<p>flax oil fish oils things like that I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s would be very very</p>
<p>beneficial for for just about anything</p>
<p>okay Karen you had I&rsquo;m gonna give you</p>
<p>another question if you wanted to ask</p>
<p>one so I just want to say this this is</p>
<p>the prop today and one of the reasons</p>
<p>that I brought it awesome what is it oh</p>
<p>this is the pecan pie pecan pie now how</p>
<p>did you get away with with the I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no there&rsquo;s hardly any carbs in</p>
<p>there is there no I mean this is why I</p>
<p>brought it because a lot of people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you hold up so people can see it and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a recipe online for this</p>
<p>you can search it out just type dr. Berg</p>
<p>and keto now it&rsquo;s called a pecan pie</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right get the recipe kanpai yeah</p>
<p>you can get in their website or you can</p>
<p>get it on YouTube right so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>advocating that you have pie for</p>
<p>breakfast or anything like that but the</p>
<p>point is like a lot of people refer to</p>
<p>keto or intermittent fasting as a diet</p>
<p>really trying the diet and you know we</p>
<p>have a lot of recipes on because it</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t a diet it&rsquo;s just a way of eating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the concept we&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>that concept of sacrifice and letting go</p>
<p>of all of who you used to love to eat</p>
<p>out the window yeah yeah this makes it</p>
<p>easy and one point we we have an amazing</p>
<p>full-time chef that&rsquo;s helping us also</p>
<p>create the recipes no in our house dr.</p>
<p>Berg calm no but they but she&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>these recipes on dr. Berg calm that you</p>
<p>have to check out I mean there&rsquo;s tons of</p>
<p>them and we&rsquo;re adding them every single</p>
<p>day and the point I want to bring about</p>
<p>that is that if you have questions about</p>
<p>how to make something we&rsquo;re gonna pretty</p>
<p>much make every single recipe you can</p>
<p>even envision from different alternative</p>
<p>bread solutions to pasta solutions to</p>
<p>simple meals and they&rsquo;re really really</p>
<p>good and easy and so those are on the</p>
<p>website under recipes and also if you</p>
<p>subscribe we&rsquo;ll send you a new one each</p>
<p>day I mean it&rsquo;s pretty awesome so this</p>
<p>will give you the exact</p>
<p>carb protein fat ratios - so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to really worry about that</p>
<p>let me ask let me just answer a question</p>
<p>from Tamara from Aruba go ahead you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on the air hi hi have you waiting so</p>
<p>long thank you for waiting okay so yes I</p>
<p>have a lot of questions but I&rsquo;m yeah</p>
<p>just quickly because yeah I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>worry about some of my international and</p>
<p>sometimes I have a lot of questions that</p>
<p>I want to ask you but I know your time</p>
<p>is very limited</p>
<p>do we have another way that people still</p>
<p>good actually quite normally I can give</p>
<p>you the speed dial give everyone my cell</p>
<p>phone number so you can call me anytime</p>
<p>24/7 just kidding no go ahead you you</p>
<p>can also call my office I have kind of</p>
<p>health coaches there that can answer</p>
<p>questions if you have a okay okay</p>
<p>let me ask just quickly yeah I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>on the keto diet it&rsquo;s been great from</p>
<p>April 2000 this year</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost my weight but now I&rsquo;ve noticed</p>
<p>that when I started I was I had good</p>
<p>energy and now my ad you gone back down</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s one okay and also I have six</p>
<p>kids and I&rsquo;m trying to get my kids on</p>
<p>the keto diet I did get him finally and</p>
<p>like some of them thought they have like</p>
<p>headaches and they&rsquo;re feeling fatigued</p>
<p>okay good so these two questions the</p>
<p>first question I&rsquo;m gonna ask is how do</p>
<p>you get the energy back this is a very</p>
<p>simple thing you need the B vitamins you</p>
<p>may want to try this right here</p>
<p>nutritional yeast or you just get enough</p>
<p>powder what you&rsquo;re missing is just more</p>
<p>B&rsquo;s start adding more B&rsquo;s until the</p>
<p>energy comes back vitamin b-complex is</p>
<p>all about helper compounds that help</p>
<p>generate energy especially in the</p>
<p>mitochondria which i&rsquo;ve just been</p>
<p>studying you need to generate energy</p>
<p>from the food but you need these B</p>
<p>vitamins especially when you dookied o</p>
<p>to be able to make it all happen so I</p>
<p>would do that and that should bring up</p>
<p>the energy now for your kids for some of</p>
<p>the symptoms it sounds like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through some</p>
<p>the key to adaptation symptoms and what</p>
<p>they need is more B vitamins - and</p>
<p>potassium so you might want to get</p>
<p>electrolyte blend with a lot of</p>
<p>potassium or a lot of vegetables that</p>
<p>should get rid of the headaches and any</p>
<p>side effects that they&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>and then the other thing is just to beef</p>
<p>up the fat if they are having problems</p>
<p>with them headaches especially between</p>
<p>the meal because there could be a blood</p>
<p>sugar issue but I appreciate you waiting</p>
<p>that long and I hope I answer the</p>
<p>question but you can call us anytime but</p>
<p>we have health coaches to help you I</p>
<p>have a question go ahead yes 10:03 but</p>
<p>this is from Judy</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s watching anyway she wants to know</p>
<p>about bullet coffee and keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting can she do bullet</p>
<p>coffee yeah the bullet coffee is</p>
<p>basically where you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re blending</p>
<p>in either a coconut oil or butter into</p>
<p>your coffee and it makes it really fatty</p>
<p>it makes it easier to go to the next</p>
<p>meal I think that&rsquo;s a really good thing</p>
<p>to do especially when you&rsquo;re starting</p>
<p>out because it makes it easy to do this</p>
<p>and because it gives you a fat in the</p>
<p>morning as you start doing this and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have more weight to go and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not you&rsquo;re not getting there what</p>
<p>you can do is mix the butter keep doing</p>
<p>the coffee if you want and just one in</p>
<p>the morning because now what happens now</p>
<p>you have nothing at all in your stomach</p>
<p>in the morning other than a liquid that</p>
<p>will cause no need to increase insulin</p>
<p>so we keep because every time you eat it</p>
<p>stimulates certain things - to increase</p>
<p>insulin a little bit especially I mean</p>
<p>like anything no matter what to some</p>
<p>degree so if you were to gradually go</p>
<p>into a state where you didn&rsquo;t need that</p>
<p>fat you could just burn a little bit</p>
<p>more fats if you&rsquo;re doing in a minute</p>
<p>fasting however that being said the</p>
<p>majority of people that do the the</p>
<p>bulletproof coffee tend to do fine and</p>
<p>they lose weight and it works for them</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m only bringing it up because some</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t lose that a little bit of</p>
<p>extra alright now the question from that</p>
<p>last question is from the Philippines</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pronounced halo go ahead you had a</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>oh yeah my question is I didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>feature for two months now and I was I</p>
<p>was trying to get us to gain lean muscle</p>
<p>and I tried people for me to to lose and</p>
<p>to heal my insulin resistance and now my</p>
<p>problem is I don&rsquo;t know how to gain</p>
<p>weight properly building keto and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking my thank-you biotics</p>
<p>in my heart because I have a heart</p>
<p>disease I have an arch RHD and a Michael</p>
<p>Bob blow up okay so you want to gain</p>
<p>weight now okay so let&rsquo;s say you lost</p>
<p>all the weight now of a sudden you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>too skinny and when a gain weight it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>better problem to have and this is kind</p>
<p>of an interesting point because you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to do it unhealthily I mean</p>
<p>if you want to gain weight you just have</p>
<p>to you know add potatoes in there but</p>
<p>then that knocks you completely out of</p>
<p>fat-burning and then it creates other</p>
<p>other issues so what I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>recommend is you start adding more</p>
<p>exercise into the mix and probably don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do maybe add another meal to it so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re doing instead of one meal to</p>
<p>two meals if you did instead of two</p>
<p>meals do three males and I would stick</p>
<p>with that if you want to gain a little</p>
<p>bit more weight and then add the</p>
<p>exercise and other than that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really no other tricks to that because</p>
<p>you want to build muscle but if you</p>
<p>wanted to gain more fat all you have to</p>
<p>do is put back in the carbs do the</p>
<p>breads pastas and cereal and starches</p>
<p>and you will boom and have six meals a</p>
<p>day alright hey guys thank you so much</p>
<p>for coming and tuning in next week we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>Eastern Standard Time thank you Karen</p>
<p>for helping out on these questions a lot</p>
<p>of good questions and watch the videos</p>
<p>stay tuned for more okay guys have a</p>
<p>good one</p>
<p>you</p>
