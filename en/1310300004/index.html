<p>Hey Aubrey, what&rsquo;s shaking? Hi, Lindsey. I have a question for you. Okay, I&rsquo;m ready to go to read your news</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, so I actually being a podcaster, of course, I listen to my news</p>
<p>So in the morning, I listen to up first by I think that&rsquo;s an NPR own channel</p>
<p>and then in the evening</p>
<p>I listen to the daily from the New York Times and the</p>
<p>Journal from the Wall Street Journal and then I read the New York Times when I&rsquo;m having lunch at my desk</p>
<p>Just pull up the New York Times read the headlines</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started listening to news in slow Spanish and news in slow French</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fantastic. I slow it down a little so I can understand really well and they&rsquo;re sort of quick snippets</p>
<p>I love it. Good idea. That is so good</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready for a trip to Argentina actually by the time this trip comes out</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll already have gone to Argentina, but I need to listen to more Argentine Spanish, you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very different pronunciation side point for today. But what are we getting into?</p>
<p>Interesting we had a great question about bias in the news. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to know where you find your news</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to answer this listeners question and dive into this because it&rsquo;s a very fascinating topic</p>
<p>It actually came up recently in one of the live group classes</p>
<p>I was teaching here at all</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s English was a fascinating discussion and I&rsquo;m curious how this is all over the world</p>
<p>So come to YouTube find this podcast episode and let us know how this is in your culture in your country</p>
<p>I really want to know</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think sadly this is more of an issue now than it was five years ago and more than it was</p>
<p>30 years ago, right? So this is becoming more and more important. So here&rsquo;s the question from our listener. Here we go</p>
<p>Dear Lindsay, first of all, I really want to thank you for doing all those English podcasts</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite English podcast and it helps me a lot with my learning. I really hope you guys can keep doing it</p>
<p>Awesome. Aubrey great review. I</p>
<p>Would like to bring up my question. I want to read news in English and study</p>
<p>The vocabulary and expressions that are used when it comes to formal occasions that will improve my academic writing</p>
<p>I know there are so many news agencies reporting news in English that it&rsquo;s hard to make a choice</p>
<p>So, which ones do you recommend?</p>
<p>Okay, you definitely got our recommendations right there at the top of the podcast for the ones we actually listen to every day</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s really valuable to think about which news sources do have some bias and which try to be more</p>
<p>Unbiased so that you can try to get the facts. Yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna go into it today</p>
<p>I mean the first thing I just want to insert this right away</p>
<p>I think the first problem of why news has become so much more bias is money, right?</p>
<p>If you you know, if you look at things like public radio PRX NPR</p>
<p>Those tend to be a little more trustworthy just because it&rsquo;s publicly funded not saying they&rsquo;re not biased</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re even in these podcasts right podcasts have advertisers and you know, then they&rsquo;re making money</p>
<p>They want to get downloads. I mean, that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a business in the end</p>
<p>So when you mix news with business is kind of where you get in trouble</p>
<p>I think it really reminds me of the HBO show succession. Have you seen that Lindsay? I haven&rsquo;t seen it</p>
<p>But now I&rsquo;m gonna go watch it this weekend. Yes, I highly recommend it</p>
<p>It is about a family that owns a media company in the United States and how they try at least to exert influence</p>
<p>Over the news over politicians. It is fascinating</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s maybe based on a real family in the United States</p>
<p>But either way, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see the kind of power struggle how money affects it and is involved and how it affects</p>
<p>This family and their relationships. It&rsquo;s fascinating. Yeah, it comes down to money. It really does</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s all about. So we&rsquo;re gonna try to answer this question for our listener today</p>
<p>What is the first kind of phrase we want to define and talk about? Yeah, so just to define the word bias</p>
<p>this is a spin toward a political stance or to benefit the owners of a news outlet when we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>The news you can have bias about anything, right?</p>
<p>If your opinion is a little slanted one way or another you are biased. We talked about this a lot in the news</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>I would just start by saying I think we all have bias in everything like there&rsquo;s no way that the way you see the world</p>
<p>Is the same as the way I do there&rsquo;s no way any situation you and I are gonna see differently</p>
<p>right, but good news good reporting like professionals professionals high standard reporting is trying to</p>
<p>Reduce bias or take it out as much as possible. Just report on what&rsquo;s actually happening. But as human beings</p>
<p>That is actually really really hard because there&rsquo;s so many things that influence the way we see the world our past</p>
<p>Who we&rsquo;ve spent time around there&rsquo;s so much right Aubrey, but when it comes to the news, we have these built-in structures</p>
<p>We have editorials. We have opinion articles and that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going to share your bias, right?</p>
<p>That should be there</p>
<p>Totally actual news that&rsquo;s a claiming to be facts needs to as much as possible</p>
<p>eliminate that bias and I think there might be an issue with education too because I think nowadays a lot of people will read an</p>
<p>Opinion column in the New York Times and pass it off as news, you know, and that&rsquo;s not even misinformation</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just opinion right like right if you get your news on Facebook like a lot of that might be editorial</p>
<p>It might be someone&rsquo;s opinion and you may not know that because maybe you didn&rsquo;t learn about that in college or in</p>
<p>Graduate school or whatever in high school. So what&rsquo;s what the most in your opinion Aubrey?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably in my opinion to definitely what is the most biased TV news station you can think of?</p>
<p>Yeah, so CNN is very much has a strong bias toward the left as far as American</p>
<p>You know politics in the United States and Fox News has a very strong bias toward the right and this</p>
<p>To me, it just seems like fact because a lot of the political pundits that come on we know their political leanings</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very much sharing their opinions and there&rsquo;s a sort of not a balance on which types of opinions</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re bringing on so you can just sort of see it there. You know, it&rsquo;s tricky</p>
<p>I heard somewhere that these news stations as they&rsquo;re coming down to their budgets and their money and their advertising</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re spending less money on investigative journalism and more money on putting pundits in a room and</p>
<p>Sitting around a table and that&rsquo;s where I think you get in trouble</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you layer so much bias on top of the news because they&rsquo;re getting paid to</p>
<p>Entertain at this point news has become like entertainment on both CNN and Fox News. That&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>We had more investigative journalists out there trying to really figure out what the heck is going on with issues in our country in the world</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;d have less of this. Yes. Oh, I agree so much</p>
<p>so I think it would be really helpful for us to share the top or</p>
<p>News resources that at least try to be unbiased</p>
<p>They have you know</p>
<p>Their goals as a company is to try to share the facts and eliminate bias and you can research all of these</p>
<p>Recently sources, but they at least have a very good reputation for being unbiased and that means unbiased news just means</p>
<p>Presenting a news story without any bias or at least kind of reporting facts, right? I mean there may be some spin on it</p>
<p>But like, you know, I think</p>
<p>Attempting. Yeah, so let&rsquo;s go through them. Let&rsquo;s go there. What&rsquo;s the first one Aubrey? Yeah, so the first one is the Associated Press</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very old. It was founded in</p>
<p>1846 and it&rsquo;s very renowned as we would say right it has a really good reputation as a global news organization</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually received 53 Pulitzer Prizes. So that&rsquo;s very impressive</p>
<p>Yeah, and it is as we said, it&rsquo;s kind of it&rsquo;s like a feeder for others</p>
<p>So I think other news magazines and newspapers grab their news from the Associated Press right Aubrey</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a supplier of news in a way. I don&rsquo;t know a lot about how that works. Oh, yeah, exactly, right?</p>
<p>I worked for a newspaper during high school and we whenever we wanted to write an article</p>
<p>We would always go to the Associated Press to get a lot of our facts a lot of our details</p>
<p>We know they have done the real work the research and then we would just credit the source</p>
<p>You know or say from Associated Press and we were just sort of compiling</p>
<p>Interesting. Okay, so that that&rsquo;s a good one. And can we go to actually I don&rsquo;t even know this</p>
<p>Is there an actual like Associated Press newspaper or is it really just a supplier of news to the papers?</p>
<p>Like is there a place we can go to read the Associated Press and what&rsquo;s the website? There is a there is a website</p>
<p>I am you&rsquo;d have to Google it. Yeah, I find out while we&rsquo;re chatting. They don&rsquo;t do a print publication as far as I know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they ever did but maybe at one at one time, but</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the website is AP news</p>
<p>Calm, okay, and you can get all of their top stories there and it&rsquo;s possible. They did at one time do a print news publication</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about that. Yeah, this is good. So I love this episode</p>
<p>So Wall Street Journal being the second one and hmm, I&rsquo;m glad this is here</p>
<p>But at the same time, I also feel like Wall Street Journal is I mean they they do present</p>
<p>They present the fact like it&rsquo;s a high quality journalism, but it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>conservative leaning</p>
<p>Because it is the perspective of the investor</p>
<p>Business perspective. So I think there is some angle would you would you agree or I honestly don&rsquo;t read the Wall Street Journal that often</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m not into stocks. I&rsquo;m not into finances and it definitely has a reputation for being a little more about that</p>
<p>So that makes sense that you know often at least in the United States</p>
<p>Those with a lot of money who want to avoid taxes on that. Yes often do sort of lean to the right because</p>
<p>Conservative politics help them protect that money</p>
<p>So that is possible that the Wall Street Journal has a little bit of bias a lot of what we&rsquo;re sharing, too</p>
<p>We were kind of looking at an article on makeuseof.com</p>
<p>That was called the top unbiased news sources and a lot of it really made sense to me</p>
<p>But it could be that that this the Wall Street Journal does lean a little bit to the right</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>I think maybe less so than a New York Times at least based on the podcast that I listen to the two shows the</p>
<p>Journal tends to be more straightforward</p>
<p>Around their tagline is about money business and power, right? So they&rsquo;re talking about these issues. Whereas the daily</p>
<p>Feels a little more</p>
<p>Liberal leaning to me, but you know, our listeners should listen to these podcasts read these newspapers and see for yourself</p>
<p>How how biased are these right? I mean, yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, so third is Reuters, which I would say this is a lot more like the Associated Press, right?</p>
<p>It is well respected and has a reputation as an unbiased news outlet</p>
<p>They really do try to focus on accurate reporting of the facts without the editorialism nice. I love it</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience with Reuters Reuters. So we&rsquo;ll leave that with that one and</p>
<p>How do you even say I thought it was Reuters, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know to be honest</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I think the word neuter neuter is spelled the same you</p>
<p>So I assume it&rsquo;s pronounced like neuter Reuters, but I don&rsquo;t know. Have I heard anyone say Reuters?</p>
<p>Maybe Reuters Reuters multiple pronunciations. Here&rsquo;s your adventure guys. Choose your adventure and in just a minute</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about one other news source</p>
<p>Okay, this one&rsquo;s good. What is the next one Aubrey and the BBC so often?</p>
<p>United States citizens will look to international</p>
<p>News outlets for their news because they recognize that anything within the United States might be a little biased to one side or the other</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>So we often feel like the BBC it has a really good reputation as the world&rsquo;s oldest</p>
<p>National broadcasting service one of the largest news services in the world and a good reputation for trying at least to be unbiased</p>
<p>Yeah, and I know the BBC even has a podcast for learning English right the BBC learning English</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that in the podcast</p>
<p>I record with Neil Neil here on the podcast. So go back and check that out from BBC learning English</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a great podcast. That was a really fun interview with him good style. We love the BBC. I love it</p>
<p>So were there any others listed that we should know about?</p>
<p>Yeah, there were definitely quite a few recommended by this article and I agree with these C-SPAN Pew Research Economist</p>
<p>Yeah, these are all again. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re making an attempt to be unbiased and just share the facts</p>
<p>So there are lots of options. I would just sort of avoid those, you know ABC CBS NBC</p>
<p>I mean sometimes it&rsquo;s fine, but lots of times you&rsquo;re going to have yeah someone on there an expert who is very much sharing their opinion</p>
<p>Yeah last night I had CNN on I will admit I do put it on sometimes just to kind of like have noise in the</p>
<p>background and there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>Republican that I only ever see on CNN. I never see any Republican politicians on CNN</p>
<p>Maybe they won&rsquo;t go on there, but there was this one guy on there last night</p>
<p>I thought I saw you on here six months ago, and I haven&rsquo;t seen any other Republicans since then on CNN</p>
<p>Fascinating it is really interesting how if someone is very right-leaning</p>
<p>I know I personally known quite a few people who will only watch Fox News</p>
<p>Because they think everything else is fake news</p>
<p>Everything else is they&rsquo;re lying and then I know a lot of people leaning very far to the left who would only watch</p>
<p>Only watch CNN, right, you know, maybe they try to watch other stuff, but that speaks to them, right?</p>
<p>Most of what they&rsquo;re hearing there makes sense to them. And I think I would definitely recommend you guys to be more open-minded</p>
<p>Yes, you I&rsquo;m a moderate</p>
<p>Honestly, I think it&rsquo;s so important to see both sides to see the value to be able to have an open conversation</p>
<p>100% being so focused on what you believe. I just think once you get closed-minded it&rsquo;s dangerous. I 100% agree</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaning more moderate these days too because I&rsquo;m getting older. I&rsquo;m reading more</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to understand things a little bit more and I can&rsquo;t be locked in one direction or the other extremes extremes are scary</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be a fiscal conservative in a social liberal like it is possible. Oh, I</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough. It&rsquo;s really tough out there. I would say one thing about Pew Research</p>
<p>So if I think if we want to make sure we get a hundred percent on bias</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not gonna be a newspaper</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be something like the Pew Research assuming they have high quality standards and how they gather just reading the research</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the data say and then you interpret that data in the way you want because journalism is always</p>
<p>Some kind of narrative interpreted on top of research. So the Pew is a really trustworthy name</p>
<p>So you can go to their website and look up studies</p>
<p>Studies on demographics everything going on in the United States in the world. So yeah</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s tricky is, you know</p>
<p>do we have time to read the Pew Research about it like I want to be able to trust a</p>
<p>Journalist to research and share it in a way that I can understand very quick way, but it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t trust that. It doesn&rsquo;t have a little bit of bias</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>and the other piece that matters here is the last thing I would say is the is the way that local news sadly is</p>
<p>Declining in the u.s. So a lot of local newspapers are getting shut down and that is dangerous for democracy</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s worrisome, right? It&rsquo;s more and more</p>
<p>I think everyone finds their news on Facebook and so there&rsquo;s not the funding for all of these other sources and that is troublesome</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s worrisome. I think we do need to support the you know</p>
<p>Funds being still given to the attempt to get accurate news to everyone. I think that&rsquo;s really vital</p>
<p>Yeah, so news is kind of becoming entertainment and what other than you know</p>
<p>Some of the ones we mentioned which are less biased news, you know big stations Fox CNN</p>
<p>New York Times sound kind of becoming more entertainment in a way</p>
<p>Scary. Yeah, kind of scary. Yep. So what&rsquo;s the takeaway for our listeners today?</p>
<p>I feel like we could talk about this for a long time, but what an interesting question</p>
<p>Thank you for sending it and I think it is so important to recognize</p>
<p>bias in the news to attempt to read news that reports facts accurately without political slant or spin without that bias and</p>
<p>I think we have some good recommendations here</p>
<p>But definitely take the time to research find what you like, but make sure that it&rsquo;s not just telling you what you already think</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. All right, really really good stuff guys</p>
<p>Let us know if you have a follow-up question from today&rsquo;s episode right to Aubrey at all ears English calm</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d be happy to feature a follow-up question</p>
<p>I want to come back to this topic because it is so important right now in 2022</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to go into the well by the time this is out. The midterm elections will be done</p>
<p>Politics matter news matters. Okay, definitely. Awesome. Lindsay. Thanks for having this great discussion. I really loved it. Good stuff. Aubrey. Talk to you soon. Bye</p>
