<p>hey everyone welcome back we&rsquo;re here for</p>
<p>another q a anything that I say is</p>
<p>definitely not meant to cure any medical</p>
<p>conditions check with your doc before</p>

<p>scorpions they have coyotes she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting used to all this but very few</p>
<p>house cats because I think the coyotes</p>

<p>people bring them in think they can run</p>
<p>around anyway so we&rsquo;re excited to get</p>
<p>into all that why don&rsquo;t we mix it up</p>
<p>this week and we&rsquo;ll go straight to our</p>
<p>first quiz question audience which we</p>
<p>all love and we all learn from and here</p>
<p>it is</p>
<p>all right first question</p>
<p>what is the number one most common sign</p>
<p>of gallstones</p>
<p>All Right audience</p>
<p>jump onto that just bring that out okay</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll go uh because we love them</p>
<p>all straight to social media</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see kindness is the per</p>
<p>kindness is great is this person&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>from YouTube I&rsquo;m all about trying your</p>
<p>gallbladder formula but I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>learning about dementia and wondering if</p>
<p>autophagy would help with plaquing of</p>
<p>the brain no family history of dementia</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the topic of Interest boy aren&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>all nervous about that</p>
<p>yeah so so they want to know about</p>
<p>autophagy I I think so and how it</p>
<p>relates to uh the onset or controlling</p>
<p>dementia she&rsquo;s just learning about it no</p>
<p>one seems to have it yet but they want</p>
<p>to know about autophagy and warding off</p>
<p>dementia is my guess</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>dementia is a is a problem within the</p>
<p>neurons in the mitochondria and the</p>
<p>neurons there&rsquo;s damage in the</p>
<p>mitochondria uh and so</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s something called mitophy</p>
<p>which is the cleaning up of old damaged</p>
<p>mitochondria within neurons and so um</p>
<p>if you were to stimulate autophagy that</p>
<p>would greatly help those symptoms and</p>
<p>that would be one very important action</p>
<p>and the best way to do it is through</p>
<p>prolonged fasting uh it actually will</p>
<p>give you new brain cells when you fast</p>
<p>you become smarter I mean I can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>you how many times uh when I do these</p>
<p>videos</p>
<p>um if I had eaten and then I do the</p>
<p>videos huge difference in my ability</p>
<p>just to kind of recall and just</p>
<p>sharpness versus if I don&rsquo;t eat it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like way sharper so when you eat it kind</p>
<p>of plugs up the pathways within the</p>
<p>neurons because you&rsquo;re uh you just ate</p>
<p>so fasting uh improves the cognitive</p>
<p>function of the cells in your brain and</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>so autophagy is and you can also</p>
<p>stimulate topology with exercise as well</p>
<p>and certain phytonutrients um</p>
<p>so I have videos on that but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely</p>
<p>you know you got to look at the whole</p>
<p>package because it&rsquo;s not just one thing</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go to Malcolm</p>
<p>X from YouTube how many hours of sleep</p>
<p>does the average adult need I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>you say get about six or seven is that</p>
<p>enough for Optimal Health</p>
<p>I would say seven to seven and a half</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say seven to eight</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>some people very rarely can get by with</p>
<p>six</p>
<p>um but when you start going below six it</p>
<p>really affects your health uh long term</p>
<p>uh increasing your risk for heart</p>
<p>attacks and stuff like that so you have</p>
<p>people that can feel refreshed and just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need enough sleep and those guys</p>
<p>those people are the lucky ones but then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other people that needs eight uh</p>
<p>eight plus even nine hours</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t get enough sleep one thing</p>
<p>you can do is you can take naps</p>
<p>um but there&rsquo;s a lot of videos I have on</p>
<p>how to enhance your sleep</p>
<p>um to try to get that that seven hours</p>
<p>but things can be</p>
<p>you know blockages for that whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sleep apnea whether it&rsquo;s um some back</p>
<p>pain or even um urinating through the</p>
<p>night so watch those videos to try to</p>
<p>enhance your sleep but to get at least</p>
<p>seven to seven and a half all right now</p>
<p>the obvious question is here uh Dr Berg</p>
<p>and I know in the audience can certainly</p>
<p>imagine you&rsquo;re the busiest guy I&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>met now are you actually able with all</p>
<p>the things you do to pull off the</p>
<p>numbers like that</p>
<p>I um I needed less sleep than my wife</p>
<p>Karen uh for sure I can get by with uh</p>
<p>about seven hours and do fine but um</p>
<p>sometimes um you know I got I just wake</p>
<p>up early but I go to bed early and ever</p>
<p>since I got through basic training</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when my sleep has been</p>
<p>interrupted so I have a tendency to get</p>
<p>up at four but what I&rsquo;ll do is I&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>back to bed I&rsquo;ll just lay there for a</p>
<p>bit and then go back to bed and get</p>
<p>another hour or so but</p>
<p>if I don&rsquo;t because I have things to do I</p>
<p>will take a nap I always take a nap to</p>
<p>get that seven hours at least seven</p>
<p>hours so to catch up because um</p>
<p>you know I you&rsquo;re right I do have a busy</p>
<p>schedule indeed okay and other people</p>
<p>around the world are busy watching us</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s uh Gander at who they are</p>
<p>good morning to excuse me all of our</p>
<p>viewers from the UK Canada Mexico Jordan</p>
<p>Greece Kurdistan Colombia Hong Kong</p>
<p>Estonia Romania Jamaica Somalia Bahrain</p>
<p>uh Kenya uh</p>
<p>has made it hasna excuse me I hope I</p>
<p>said that right um Terry he&rsquo;s our</p>

<p>Austria Kashmir India Singapore Chile</p>
<p>Malta Kenya Oman South Africa and all</p>
<p>across these United States including</p>
<p>Arizona with the Scorpions and so on so</p>
<p>thanks everybody for tuning in and the</p>
<p>audience is indeed tuning in because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already come up with an answer</p>
<p>for the first question which asked the</p>
<p>number one sign of gallstones is is</p>
<p>and I think that was my little typo</p>
<p>there where I left the ti forgive me</p>
<p>audience and Dr Berg hasn&rsquo;t admonished</p>
<p>me yet 78 of them say it&rsquo;s pain in the</p>
<p>upper abdomen or on the right side and</p>
<p>22 percent say it&rsquo;s nausea</p>
<p>okay well good good uh attempt down</p>
<p>there and um 80 of the time this is the</p>
<p>sign and the sign is asymptomatic now if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what that means it means</p>
<p>no symptoms oh it&rsquo;s kind of a trick</p>
<p>question but there&rsquo;s absolutely no</p>
<p>indications of your gallstones but</p>
<p>indirectly you can detect if you have</p>
<p>gallstones</p>
<p>um but you&rsquo;re right if you have pain</p>
<p>underneath the right rib cage that could</p>
<p>definitely be a situation or sludge in</p>
<p>the Ducks themselves</p>
<p>um but and it can refer to the right</p>
<p>shoulder blade and you can also have um</p>
<p>nauseousness for sure and even vomiting</p>
<p>that would be that would definitely be</p>
<p>an indication it also could be a kidney</p>
<p>stone too</p>
<p>um because there&rsquo;s a little muscle the</p>
<p>tubes called ducts have they&rsquo;re muscular</p>
<p>and so when you have a distension</p>
<p>because a visceral sensation whether it</p>
<p>is a burning pain but also nauseousness</p>
<p>and um even if the cause of vomiting too</p>
<p>so um yeah these are all common things</p>
<p>and even if the stool is light colored</p>
<p>chances are you don&rsquo;t have enough bile</p>
<p>and that is really the real underlying</p>
<p>reason why people get gallstones is a</p>
<p>lack of bile or um they might have um</p>
<p>also itchiness</p>
<p>um so there&rsquo;s stay tuned for a video on</p>
<p>this because I want to um really get</p>
<p>people to understand these little Clues</p>
<p>so you can read your body versus ignore</p>
<p>it or not understand what it really</p>
<p>means so I&rsquo;m working on a book to um</p>
<p>two books one is to simplify like all</p>
<p>these little red flags so you can kind</p>
<p>of know what your body is telling you</p>
<p>and then another book on simple tests</p>
<p>that you can do to figure things out so</p>
<p>rather than do some expensive</p>
<p>blood test or something like that or</p>
<p>x-ray or CAT scan</p>
<p>why not use some of these tests that you</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t need to have any equipment</p>
<p>at all but you can pick up information</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m going to share that with you</p>
<p>even like a blood pressure you check if</p>
<p>you lie down and stand up you check your</p>
<p>blood pressure and you look at the top</p>
<p>number which is the systolic number</p>
<p>normally your body should adapt through</p>
<p>this stress and increase that top number</p>
<p>by six to ten points if everything is</p>
<p>normal from line to standing but what if</p>
<p>it drops down or it goes too high what</p>
<p>does that actually mean well it means</p>
<p>that the adrenal gland is malfunctioning</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a real simple thing all you</p>
<p>need is a blood pressure cuff and if you</p>
<p>understand all these tests you can just</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>you know understand the body a lot more</p>
<p>than</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>just sometimes go go and give it some</p>
<p>static test it doesn&rsquo;t really tell you</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in a functional State</p>
<p>and this is the problem with uh medicine</p>
<p>they just look at static stuff but the</p>
<p>body is functional it&rsquo;s Dynamic it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things are moving</p>
<p>um you can do a stress test but again</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh more invasive so there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>sorts of tests that you can do learn and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be teaching people that</p>
<p>through some books</p>
<p>my goodness well here we go again with</p>
<p>Dr Bergen in between all the stuff he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>writing two books my wife Lori has me</p>
<p>empty the trash regularly and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>periodic vacuumings which I think steals</p>
<p>any time for me to do any</p>
<p>extracurricular stuff so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how you pull it off but isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>amazing and I&rsquo;m also taking doing those</p>
<p>chores too so see so I got no excuse but</p>
<p>anyway we&rsquo;re all the great benefactors</p>
<p>for that and speaking of gallbladder</p>
<p>stuff</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Jill from YouTube please discuss when we</p>
<p>should take bile salts if we have no</p>
<p>gallbladder before or after a meal or</p>
<p>some other time</p>
<p>after because the pH of bile bile salts</p>
<p>is alkaline so if you took it right</p>
<p>before a meal it probably wouldn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>as good because you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>neutralize some of the stomach acid</p>
<p>involved to help you digest some of the</p>
<p>protein so it&rsquo;s always best to take it</p>
<p>right after the meal so it follows the</p>
<p>meal that will work a little bit better</p>
<p>all right very good well I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>bragging about</p>
<p>my new friend Karen from Arizona so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>high time to find out if she has been</p>
<p>yet consumed by any of the creatures she</p>
<p>described and more importantly to come</p>
<p>on the air and discuss with you what the</p>
<p>issue is care and you&rsquo;re on the air with</p>
<p>Dr Burr</p>
<p>good morning Dr Berg I guess well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>morning here for me</p>
<p>good morning</p>
<p>good morning okay so good morning</p>
<p>so should I just fire away or are you</p>
<p>going to ask me a question no you fire</p>
<p>away what&rsquo;s your question</p>
<p>okay so I have a history I went through</p>
<p>a very traumatic event in 2006. my</p>
<p>husband was tragically murdered while I</p>
<p>was with him so I witnessed it I went</p>
<p>through the whole thing and as a result</p>
<p>of it I believe that about I I got</p>
<p>gastritis in my</p>
<p>I got gastritis and then two years after</p>
<p>that I got eczema and I have been</p>
<p>struggling with the eczema and the</p>
<p>gastritis pretty much ever since ever</p>
<p>since that horrific event so</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m trying to get rid of the</p>
<p>gastritis and I did watch your video</p>
<p>some months back on getting</p>
<p>those those various remedies and I used</p>
<p>all the remedies until the end but I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see any change so I stopped</p>
<p>taking them so my question is how do I</p>
<p>if as well as I just had in my A1C done</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t believe that my uh my A1C</p>
<p>was at 6.0 now I&rsquo;m 127 pounds I I&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>personal trainer I&rsquo;m Into Fitness I work</p>
<p>out every day I was a vegetarian for 20</p>
<p>years I just started eating meat a</p>
<p>little over a year now I was low on</p>
<p>vitamin D vitamin B12 I mean I&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>been a runaway train wreck and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to get in front of the bus I just</p>
<p>feel like we&rsquo;re the train I just feel</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know what to do and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trust regular medicine regular doctors I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to do prescriptions I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like any of that I don&rsquo;t like that model</p>
<p>at all</p>
<p>hey you um you I totally hear you on</p>
<p>that because uh uh we&rsquo;re in the same</p>
<p>same viewpoint on that for sure and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really really really sorry for your loss</p>
<p>um devastating terrible</p>
<p>um so it doesn&rsquo;t sound like this is uh</p>
<p>diet related this is a stress related</p>
<p>thing and that&rsquo;s I do I did have a video</p>
<p>on this I I may have released it but</p>
<p>um you can literally cause gastritis and</p>
<p>ulcers</p>
<p>and autoimmune diseases from stress</p>
<p>events losses shocks to the system</p>
<p>um so you then you go on the normal</p>
<p>remedies and</p>
<p>try to cope with that but I think</p>
<p>um probably a better solution for you</p>
<p>would be to</p>
<p>um kind of focus more on the nutrition</p>
<p>for the adrenal glands</p>
<p>the support for the adrenal glands I</p>
<p>have a lot of data you probably already</p>
<p>are implementing some of the stuff where</p>
<p>the like the Deep acupressure around the</p>
<p>adrenal glands um and you&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>doing the exercise which is awesome but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the adrenal gland is uh there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>parts the outside and the inside and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hundred percent sympathetic</p>
<p>nervous system on that inside there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>parasympathetic it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no off</p>
<p>switch on the adrenals so it just turns</p>
<p>that thing on and it just creates a lot</p>
<p>of problems in fact probably and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just guessing the A1C being high is not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not eating a lot of</p>
<p>sugar is that correct</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>I think part of Shakeology</p>
<p>but I was doing a lot of Shakeology and</p>
<p>then I was adding fruit on top of that</p>
<p>and I did that for almost two years and</p>
<p>uh like I said I just couldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>how high my A1C went up so I stopped I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do any more Shakeology because I</p>
<p>found my son kept telling me Mom it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too much sugar it&rsquo;s too much sugar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good I don&rsquo;t know why they put</p>
<p>all the sugar in there so okay so now it</p>
<p>changes my answer because</p>
<p>um you know we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re told hey eat</p>
<p>your fruits and vegetables right they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re healthy</p>
<p>um unfortunately these fruits are not</p>
<p>seasonal and the sugar content is way</p>
<p>higher than they were way back in the</p>
<p>day and um they&rsquo;ve been bred for</p>
<p>you know sweetness and things like that</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of</p>
<p>fructose which can easily raise your A1C</p>
<p>on top of the stress which turns your</p>
<p>body protein into glucose as a stress</p>
<p>response which can also</p>
<p>um elevate your blood sugars and even</p>
<p>create a pre-diabetic situation if</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s under a lot of stress</p>
<p>but I think um I think you probably</p>
<p>might have already tried the remedy zinc</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>um carnocyte uh</p>
<p>that would actually be good for</p>
<p>gastritis</p>
<p>um but I think we&rsquo;re dealing with maybe</p>
<p>an adrenal program that involves</p>
<p>adaptogens</p>
<p>not just regular stress but physical</p>
<p>work around the house believe it or not</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s one of the best things for</p>
<p>mental just mental stress to keep your</p>
<p>mind off things and go for long walks</p>
<p>hiking I think that&rsquo;s going to be your</p>
<p>Focus this next</p>
<p>months of just really doing</p>
<p>um an adrenal Rejuvenation let&rsquo;s see you</p>
<p>do that right and</p>
<p>it still doesn&rsquo;t handle it there&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>then you need to find a good</p>
<p>doctor that specializes in something</p>
<p>called metabolomic testing that really</p>
<p>is try to find someone good I will be</p>
<p>posting some stuff on my website soon</p>
<p>about that probably at the end of the</p>
<p>summer because I&rsquo;m doing a deep dive in</p>
<p>this topic which will evaluate the</p>
<p>biochemistry a lot deeper than typical</p>
<p>functional medicine or nutritional</p>
<p>doctors and then that way we can</p>
<p>go deeper and see what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>biochemical Pathways and that&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>new great exciting field that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>up that that can help</p>
<p>figure out problems that nothing else</p>
<p>has been effective so</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what I would focus on for</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>um but yeah this is a stress event</p>
<p>caused problem and then I&rsquo;m glad that</p>
<p>you stopped the fructose because that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably notice within give it a</p>
<p>little bit more time but your A1C should</p>
<p>come down and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to improve things greatly</p>
<p>because ketones are antioxidants and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing all the fruit and stuff you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the benefit the ketones so</p>
<p>that could be huge in your recovery</p>
<p>cycle but there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack but I</p>
<p>hope I gave you a couple of little tips</p>
<p>to at least get you by until we can</p>
<p>you know get you through this</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m going to be one of your keto</p>
<p>coaches I&rsquo;m about 70 something percent</p>
<p>through the program oh correct the</p>
<p>content is great</p>
<p>it is great I just love it the content</p>
<p>is wonderful so I feel like that would</p>
<p>be a really good addition to um to what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently doing</p>
<p>wow so yeah you&rsquo;re right because you um</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>um an athlete so just having all that</p>
<p>extra information you&rsquo;re already helping</p>
<p>people so this will give you some</p>
<p>additional tools this is great I&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>that you are doing that training because</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s kind of what my thought is</p>
<p>like the more knowledge you can have</p>
<p>about this technology the more you can</p>
<p>help yourself as well then that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>the solution is to be fully trained in</p>
<p>something so now you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>bulletproofing yourself really because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find out what you need</p>
<p>to focus more on and be sure of it</p>
<p>so if I get the adrenals under control</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of this eczema</p>
<p>um now and I also set up an appointment</p>
<p>to meet with a naturopathic doctor in a</p>
<p>couple of weeks as well</p>
<p>yeah so so</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know I think uh if we take a look at</p>
<p>skin disorders whether it&rsquo;s eczema or</p>
<p>psoriasis</p>
<p>potentially it could be more of a gut</p>
<p>issue which aligns with that gastritis</p>
<p>right so I think um both of those</p>
<p>um are could be related</p>
<p>um but and also that you have the</p>
<p>microbiome as well so that could be a</p>
<p>problem there let&rsquo;s see what they find</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but uh yeah the skin problems</p>
<p>um are a reflection of what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>internally with the GI system and um the</p>
<p>uh the last thing I would say as a</p>
<p>remedy for Eczema is um a lot of vitamin</p>
<p>D so do higher levels of vitamin D I</p>
<p>would say probably maybe 30 000 I use</p>
<p>and see if that doesn&rsquo;t go away there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also some very cool</p>
<p>um new things related to using UVB</p>
<p>um light therapy on your skin</p>
<p>so um I didn&rsquo;t do a video on that but I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding a lot of people benefiting</p>
<p>from light therapy for their skin if if</p>
<p>we need to go if we need to do that but</p>
<p>maybe we won&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>handle your internal gut issues</p>
<p>okay well Karen listen I&rsquo;m afraid we</p>
<p>have run out about time for this segment</p>
<p>but I can tell you that the entire</p>

<p>thank you back and let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go to quiz question</p>
<p>uh number</p>
<p>two and there it is Doctor</p>
<p>okay good true or false</p>
<p>lower cholesterol can double your risk</p>
<p>of cancer</p>
<p>certain types of cancer</p>
<p>All Right audience as soon as I know you</p>
<p>will</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media they may be feeling a little</p>
<p>neglected we&rsquo;re going to take care of</p>
<p>that right now Wilma from Facebook what</p>
<p>are your thoughts on going on a</p>
<p>completely raw food diet</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s my thoughts</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it really depends on what is raw</p>
<p>are you talking like we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>vegetables or raw meat like raw chicken</p>
<p>meat like for all this I there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of benefits in doing raw however</p>
<p>believe it or not even some of the</p>
<p>phytonutrients are enhanced when you</p>
<p>kind of cook certain</p>
<p>types of vegetables like the cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables like steamed</p>
<p>uh versus Raw there&rsquo;s more uh</p>
<p>availability I think a combination would</p>
<p>be good but I do like</p>
<p>consuming at least 50 raw especially</p>
<p>your a lot of these salads and things</p>
<p>like that</p>
<p>because when you overcook it you destroy</p>
<p>a lot of the things that the certain</p>
<p>nutrients are heat sensitive</p>
<p>but certain phytonutrients actually are</p>
<p>released with heat so it really depends</p>
<p>on what you&rsquo;re talking about but um</p>
<p>uh definitely if you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>also like like beef being more rare than</p>
<p>overcooked that&rsquo;s of course a lot</p>
<p>healthier</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my answer all right very good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see now I want to go back to</p>
<p>uh Arna I&rsquo;m going to have you and lovely</p>
<p>Liliana get set for the camera uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an adorable a girl and her mom</p>
<p>on I don&rsquo;t know what the nature of their</p>
<p>question is but the little girl has been</p>
<p>so patient that I want to bring her on</p>
<p>right now yeah yeah welcome back yeah we</p>
<p>we know each other oh good how wonderful</p>
<p>well please uh Arna if you would go</p>
<p>ahead and unmute yourself and let us</p>
<p>know what your question is for Dr Berg</p>
<p>with regard to Liliana Etc</p>
<p>go ahead well hi good afternoon</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;re so glad to be here</p>
<p>um so uh liliana&rsquo;s A1C you remember that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s type 1 diabetic from last time I</p>
<p>talked to you</p>
<p>um her A1C has come down to 5.6 and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>remained there for like nine I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember whether it&rsquo;s nine months or a</p>
<p>whole year</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s been doing your program for</p>
<p>three years now she&rsquo;s six years old</p>
<p>and um she&rsquo;s doing great uh really</p>
<p>learning and she can read beautifully uh</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the first thing I wanted to</p>
<p>tell you and let that be an</p>
<p>encouragement to all you parents out</p>
<p>there it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>we eat our vegetables</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing low carb only</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>gorgeous</p>
<p>grass-fed organic all that yes so</p>
<p>incredible</p>
<p>um my question</p>
<p>today for you is uh</p>
<p>what do you think about night terrors</p>
<p>because this is something I talked to</p>
<p>our uh chiropractor about it and he said</p>
<p>he thinks it&rsquo;s like sympathetic and</p>
<p>parasympathetic off balance because of</p>
<p>the type 1 diabetes</p>
<p>but this is happening almost every night</p>
<p>at this point and I&rsquo;m not sure what to</p>
<p>do about it</p>
<p>um I mentioned that we&rsquo;re already doing</p>
<p>organic uh you know I&rsquo;ve tried to cut</p>
<p>out as many pesticides as possible</p>
<p>um oh she does wear a um Bluetooth</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>pump system so I kind of wondered if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any EMF</p>
<p>stuff like going on</p>
<p>uh I just I I want to know all your</p>
<p>thoughts</p>
<p>okay so the thing that pops up initially</p>
<p>is a B1 deficiency will cause nightmares</p>
<p>or even night terrors so</p>
<p>um now why would she have a B1</p>
<p>deficiency just because the being a</p>
<p>diabetic in general type one uh the need</p>
<p>for B1 goes way up but</p>
<p>if you take the what no normal water</p>
<p>soluble B vitamins it might not</p>
<p>penetrate the central nervous system</p>
<p>like we want now I have mentioned</p>
<p>benphotamine in the past but</p>
<p>benphotamine is good for peripheral</p>
<p>nerves uh especially from diabetics on</p>
<p>your feet and your hands but not the</p>
<p>central nervous system in the brain so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called Uh</p>
<p>thiamine elephiamine is a natural</p>
<p>lipotrophic B1 it&rsquo;s from garlic and um</p>
<p>so you need a natural B1</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and I have information on my website</p>
<p>about that but that&rsquo;s one I would</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>um and then what you do</p>
<p>is just take one before bed and then you</p>
<p>keep increasing one additional each each</p>
<p>night until those go away and you might</p>
<p>need four of those before it goes away</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I think it is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I think we have a delay I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry I don&rsquo;t mean to interrupt you at</p>
<p>all um she is on one of your pills of B1</p>
<p>I used to be doing the benfotamine but</p>
<p>then when you put out the information</p>
<p>out there about it not going through the</p>
<p>brain barrier</p>
<p>um we switch to your natural B1 but she</p>
<p>only takes one pill</p>
<p>because of her age and her weight though</p>
<p>I mean is there any uh danger of</p>
<p>toxicity or just she would she would</p>
<p>have to take a lot of it but I would go</p>
<p>up to at least four</p>
<p>um at the very most but I think uh okay</p>
<p>I bet you that will create a big change</p>
<p>and if some weird reason it does not</p>
<p>within like a week</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would to suspect that EMF because the</p>
<p>EMF is right on her on close to her</p>
<p>brain correct is it in the ear or is it</p>
<p>where is it</p>
<p>no no not in the ear she wears a CGM on</p>
<p>her arm on the other arm over here</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s connected to her pump</p>
<p>which is around the waist yeah</p>
<p>so so I don&rsquo;t know if you have any in</p>
<p>EMF tester but you could see how far it</p>
<p>travels but I will say there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely</p>
<p>that connection that um well I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>some really wild things especially if</p>
<p>someone is sensitive to it and uh you</p>
<p>know what that would be the next thing I</p>
<p>would evaluate and look at is and see if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you know see if you can maybe try</p>
<p>another way of testing for a while until</p>
<p>you can isolate it that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I would do that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like the uh the stuff I would focus</p>
<p>on first</p>
<p>um and then you have you have access to</p>
<p>to find out</p>
<p>um just to give me feedback and so I can</p>
<p>kind of coach you through this as as we</p>
<p>try different things because we</p>
<p>definitely have to figure that out and</p>
<p>she just looks gorgeous oh my gosh</p>
<p>completely</p>
<p>super healthy look at the skin the bone</p>
<p>structure everything yeah</p>
<p>extremely cute</p>
<p>that is so great your keto diet yes yeah</p>
<p>well and Liliana you are a great example</p>
<p>to all the other little girls and boys</p>
<p>out there because it&rsquo;s difficult</p>
<p>sometimes to get away from the junk food</p>
<p>that we all eat so we&rsquo;re very proud of</p>
<p>you and you&rsquo;re our official mascot for</p>
<p>healthy eating especially with type oh</p>
<p>wait a minute there&rsquo;s some evidence of</p>
<p>why she&rsquo;s feeling better and there is</p>
<p>that nutritional yeast or what is that</p>
<p>stuff there we go it&rsquo;s the kids vitamins</p>
<p>oh kids vitamins there you go well yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously working almost every</p>
<p>morning she loves them good well it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working very well in uh Liliana thanks</p>
<p>for being such a great example for all</p>
<p>of our future kids and and ultimately</p>
<p>world leaders so please do check back</p>
<p>yes sir Steve I mean like um an average</p>
<p>child is on what&rsquo;s called not just</p>
<p>processed foods but they call it Ultra</p>
<p>processed foods so you can imagine the</p>
<p>amount of uh</p>
<p>um they don&rsquo;t even need ever eat</p>
<p>vegetables at all and so it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>chicken fingers</p>
<p>soda candy I mean it&rsquo;s just so bad I</p>
<p>just I just cringed and then people</p>
<p>unfortunately try to change the diet</p>
<p>when the kids become teenagers and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really easy right Steve yeah</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m glad that she started really</p>
<p>young and uh</p>
<p>you know a lot of people I think change</p>
<p>like this when they have some event like</p>
<p>diabetes and things like that or some</p>
<p>other health event and but don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wait for that problem to occur you know</p>
<p>learn from the experience of others like</p>
<p>just prevent is the key so well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific</p>
<p>lastly of course we&rsquo;ll say uh go moms to</p>
<p>Arna she certainly has kept with the</p>
<p>program and her beautiful daughter is</p>
<p>the Grateful recipient of that I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll look forward to you getting</p>
<p>back with us again Arna and Liliana with</p>
<p>your great progress and travel through</p>
<p>life now we have uh the second quiz</p>
<p>question of the day which is a true</p>
<p>falser and wanted to lower cholesterol</p>
<p>can double your risk of cancer and</p>
<p>Terry where did that go there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>information coming by okay 52 percent of</p>
<p>our respondents say it&rsquo;s true 48 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s actually actually true and I I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing the Deep dive into</p>
<p>um statins which basically blocked the</p>
<p>production of cholesterol and uh you</p>
<p>know uh you see these incredible numbers</p>
<p>once you know take statins and reduce</p>
<p>your risk Heart Attack by 50</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m gonna release a video on</p>
<p>what that actually means because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of manipulating</p>
<p>the risk factors and using something</p>
<p>called um relative risk reduction versus</p>
<p>absolute risk reduction I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>explain the Simplicity to what that</p>
<p>means so how you can turn like a one</p>
<p>percent decrease rate into a 50 decrease</p>
<p>rate and get away with it</p>
<p>um and then also looking at the side</p>
<p>effects of that go up by five five</p>
<p>percent which is if you compare one</p>
<p>percent to five percent it&rsquo;s a big it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>5x increase so hey you decrease your</p>
<p>risk of heart attack by one percent but</p>
<p>then increase your risk of uh cancer you</p>
<p>know and things like that so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some faceted information on</p>
<p>uh what happens with you know statins as</p>
<p>well as just cutting out your</p>
<p>cholesterol and having very very low</p>
<p>cholesterol it&rsquo;s not good for the immune</p>
<p>system it&rsquo;s not good for certain things</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to share that data coming</p>
<p>up real soon all right terrific let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>march on with the next question here it</p>
<p>is Dr Berg</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>what is the most potent anti-placking</p>
<p>natural remedy available on the market</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll give you a hint</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been around for</p>
<p>2 000 years and it has virtually no</p>
<p>side effects</p>
<p>all right Jump On It audience Andrew</p>
<p>from YouTube what is the best food</p>
<p>source for taurine taurine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the problem with food source with</p>
<p>taurine is that you never find a food</p>
<p>source just with one amino acid</p>
<p>and a lot of times they compete with</p>
<p>each other</p>
<p>so like taurine is in a lot of different</p>
<p>foods you know meats and things like</p>
<p>that but if you&rsquo;re trying to increase it</p>
<p>you should probably just take it as a</p>
<p>standalone because it has certain</p>
<p>effects</p>
<p>and taken an empty stomach because</p>
<p>adding another protein can interfere</p>
<p>with it</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a tough one El Mondo from YouTube</p>
<p>what do you recommend for someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>had an ileostomy which I guess helps you</p>
<p>remove waste straight from the body or</p>
<p>out the stomach</p>
<p>yeah that is uh that&rsquo;s uh do you have an</p>
<p>hour it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s gonna take um</p>
<p>you know a bit more because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealing with uh part of the</p>
<p>intestine that&rsquo;s removed and so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>half having to</p>
<p>deal with all sorts of problems with uh</p>
<p>digestion and uh good diarrhea and</p>
<p>all sorts of things so I I think what I</p>
<p>would do is I would Implement</p>
<p>immediately regular intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and and improve the foods</p>
<p>digestibility by consuming</p>
<p>either steamed vegetables and Foods as</p>
<p>well as fermented especially fermented</p>
<p>but you got to be careful not to overeat</p>
<p>and then you also have to be careful</p>
<p>about uh creating vitamin deficiencies</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um just regular food is not going to cut</p>
<p>it you&rsquo;re going to have to enhance</p>
<p>certain nutrients because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing a certain part of the digestive</p>
<p>system so there&rsquo;s a lot to talk about</p>
<p>but I think I have a video on this</p>
<p>um you can look that up</p>
<p>um with more details</p>
<p>all right very good uh continuing on</p>
<p>this is Eva from Facebook how can I</p>
<p>reduce my high levels of ferritin</p>
<p>that doc</p>
<p>well I think what I would do is I would</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>avoid red meat uh beef liver I would</p>
<p>avoid</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>any type of iron supplements</p>
<p>um I would um</p>
<p>make sure you avoid any food that has</p>
<p>enriched or fortified</p>
<p>with iron that would be like all the</p>
<p>grains and things like that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then you could also uh</p>
<p>start drinking distilled water</p>
<p>um and that will that will actually help</p>
<p>reduce some of the</p>
<p>um the iron and put your body in a</p>
<p>better better place and that way you can</p>
<p>take the minerals that you really need</p>
<p>usually women who are menstruating they</p>
<p>can get rid of some design but iron has</p>
<p>a is difficult to get rid of especially</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a genetic problem with on top</p>
<p>of it it&rsquo;s easy to become</p>
<p>have iron overload which affects</p>
<p>um more men than women because women do</p>
<p>menstruate up to a certain point</p>
<p>okay very good listen we&rsquo;re going to try</p>
<p>to get through everybody in fact we are</p>
<p>going to get through everybody in the</p>
<p>green room but we&rsquo;d like your</p>
<p>participation we&rsquo;re running back on time</p>
<p>a little bit so Carrie I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>bring you on the air with Dr Berg and if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d really stick to our one question</p>
<p>in 30 seconds make sure we can get to</p>
<p>all our stuff welcome to show Carrie</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>thank you I&rsquo;m so excited I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>following you for a long time I have</p>
<p>Auto I have a rheumatoid arthritis and I</p>
<p>heard your interview with the Hungarian</p>
<p>doctor I forget her name and that uh</p>
<p>turned me on to checking out the</p>
<p>carnivore diet so I&rsquo;ve now been doing</p>
<p>the carnivore diet for a year and four</p>
<p>months and it&rsquo;s made a major difference</p>
<p>in pain just I really don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>pain I have lack of function still and a</p>
<p>bizarre deformity because I haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taken hardly any medication</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been trying to deal with it</p>
<p>naturally</p>
<p>but uh being on the carnivore diet has</p>
<p>been so helpful and the your</p>
<p>intermittent fasting advice oh my God</p>
<p>that was made a huge difference as well</p>
<p>so thank you thank you so much</p>
<p>my question is about organ Meats uh I I</p>
<p>read somewhere online a couple of places</p>
<p>some some people advising not to eat</p>
<p>them too often and I probably have them</p>
<p>three times a week because I get this</p>
<p>hamburger that already has heart and</p>
<p>kidney mixed in with it and and I have</p>
<p>a brown schweiger you know like</p>
<p>different things in head cheese I eat</p>
<p>different things to make sure I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting the organs and then I read read</p>
<p>that and so now I think oh am I having</p>
<p>it too often with three times a week be</p>
<p>too often to have that mixed in</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so because uh um unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having polar bear liver which</p>
<p>says super high levels of vitamin A that</p>
<p>can be very toxic chances are you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably going to be okay but you know</p>
<p>you just have to be aware of certain</p>
<p>things like um Iron vitamin A retinol</p>
<p>um could could potentially create some</p>
<p>toxicity but if you just understand</p>
<p>about the symptoms you can quickly</p>
<p>identify that and taking less but I</p>
<p>think the benefits of organ Meats far</p>
<p>outweigh any risk for toxicity if you</p>
<p>look at what what&rsquo;s in them the other</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;m going to mention which I</p>
<p>you know I keep running into this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m probably looking for it but</p>
<p>the quality of</p>
<p>the food especially if you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>carnival really counts as well I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>you just</p>
<p>one piece of information that I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>do a video on because I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating this is based on like when I</p>
<p>entered</p>
<p>I entered into a study where I sent my</p>
<p>beef for my cattle on my property and um</p>
<p>what was unique about</p>
<p>our beef is that there was three times</p>
<p>the level of any other farmer out there</p>
<p>that have phytonutrients</p>
<p>phytochemicals like these are plant</p>
<p>chemicals</p>
<p>like polyphenols and carotenoids and all</p>
<p>these plants</p>
<p>nutrients in cattle meat like what even</p>
<p>some are even more than even in</p>
<p>vegetables now that&rsquo;s pretty bizarre to</p>
<p>get your to get your phytonutrients from</p>
<p>animal products so it&rsquo;s like you eat</p>
<p>animals that have high phytonutrients</p>
<p>they become more bioavailable</p>
<p>um you don&rsquo;t have to deal with the</p>
<p>anti-nutrients that happens with plants</p>
<p>so some people that are on Carnivore</p>
<p>this is oh yeah you don&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>benefits on the phytonutrients that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not true unless you&rsquo;re doing like the</p>
<p>you know the typical</p>
<p>conventional grain-fed animal products</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>I personally think if you can find um</p>
<p>some some some of these meats and organ</p>
<p>Meats from a farmer&rsquo;s market or a farm</p>
<p>that you know about or you know</p>
<p>grass-fed grass finish or even like U.S</p>
<p>Wellness Meats order online you could</p>
<p>actually um</p>
<p>be so far ahead of everyone else</p>
<p>especially even with the races of Omega</p>
<p>3 to omega-6 and and all these other</p>
<p>biomarkers so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I just want to point that out because</p>
<p>you can get so many things from</p>
<p>for meats and organ meats that</p>
<p>um are almost to the equivalent of just</p>
<p>vegetables as well and a much more</p>
<p>bioavailable form</p>
<p>um as far as rheumatoid arthritis goes</p>
<p>uh if you benefited from that that tells</p>
<p>us exactly where your problem probably</p>
<p>started which is in the gut</p>
<p>so that being said you might also want</p>
<p>to um</p>
<p>take more vitamin D</p>
<p>uh just to kind of bring inflammation</p>
<p>down more which you might already be</p>
<p>doing and then also the other thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important is a lot more</p>
<p>potassium potassium tends to help</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis more than other</p>
<p>minerals so you might want to experiment</p>
<p>with that as well</p>
<p>thank you yes I just started doing that</p>
<p>too I added more potassium I had it in</p>
<p>the electrolytes I thought maybe that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not enough so I added some more and that</p>
<p>that has been wonderful</p>
<p>yes great that&rsquo;s so awesome I&rsquo;m so glad</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing better that&rsquo;s terrific well</p>
<p>listen thank you for a great phone call</p>
<p>Carrie and uh please get back with us as</p>
<p>you continue really a miraculous uh you</p>
<p>know emergence from the horrible pain</p>
<p>that usually accompanies rheumatoid</p>
<p>arthritis so more great news for</p>
<p>audience and all those sufferers around</p>
<p>the world okay let&rsquo;s go back to our uh</p>
<p>number three</p>
<p>and here it is and what it asked of the</p>
<p>audience is what is the most potent</p>
<p>anti-placking natural remedy available</p>
<p>drum roll please and 60 of a respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s vinegar 30 say it&rsquo;s olive oil</p>
<p>and 10 say it&rsquo;s garlic</p>
<p>okay so you might if you maybe you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard of this because it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>NATO kinase NATO kinase it comes from</p>
<p>NATO which is fermented soybeans uh</p>
<p>which is um a very popular addition to</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>um and uh now what&rsquo;s interesting about</p>
<p>this is that I&rsquo;ve talked about NATO</p>
<p>having vitamin K2 which greatly reduces</p>
<p>the calcium in the arteries and pushes</p>
<p>it back in the bone but NATO kindness</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an extract it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>largest or the most prevalent uh</p>
<p>ingredient in this NATO which has some</p>
<p>fascinating properties because it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>enzyme okay it&rsquo;s an enzyme that potently</p>
<p>dissolves</p>
<p>fibrogen</p>
<p>or fibrin and um</p>
<p>and what happens is that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>clotting mechanism so it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>anticoagulation</p>
<p>anti-fibrin effects so it dissolves in</p>
<p>one city it dissolves</p>
<p>clots I think 88 in six hours</p>
<p>so we have the clotting Factor we have</p>
<p>also it inhibits</p>
<p>um the thickness of the wall of the</p>
<p>arteries it&rsquo;s a very potent anti-um</p>
<p>LDL as far as the oxidative LDL</p>
<p>it also</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s an ant um it it makes the cell</p>
<p>walls thinner so it&rsquo;s not so thick and</p>
<p>rigid I mean across the board it is one</p>
<p>of the most amazing antidose for</p>
<p>plaquing it you can even once said I</p>
<p>found it it can shrink plaquing in the</p>
<p>aorta</p>
<p>in animal studies of course like at a</p>
<p>rabbits so if you have any pet rabbits</p>
<p>with uh plaquing you can definitely put</p>
<p>them on this as well and then also</p>
<p>um it helps the thickness of the</p>
<p>carotenoids which is in these arteries</p>
<p>in your neck</p>
<p>and uh amazing amazing research I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t people know about this this is</p>
<p>incredible incredible for any type of</p>
<p>plaquing But realize plaquing is just uh</p>
<p>is a Band-Aid</p>
<p>you know people have this idea that</p>
<p>clogged arteries come from dietary</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>but what is a plaque</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s part cholesterol there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>calcium and protein so should we now</p>
<p>also avoid calcium and protein</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now that cholesterol is there because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being attracted by the inflammation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in the artery so the body is</p>
<p>trying to heal it as a Band-Aid so um</p>
<p>but this remedy is a fascinating if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re concerned about plaquing I think</p>
<p>that would be something I would put at</p>
<p>the top of the list because it handles</p>
<p>so many different aspects of</p>
<p>artery issues and um</p>
<p>and heart issues and since heart disease</p>
<p>and heart deaths from heart disease is</p>
<p>sort of at the top of the list as far as</p>
<p>the reason why people die it might be um</p>
<p>a good valid therapy for people to at</p>
<p>least consider in research okay quiz</p>
<p>question number four for the day</p>
<p>what common spice has the greatest</p>
<p>effect on stopping menstrual cramping</p>
<p>okay listen up Terry There&rsquo;s Hope</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s move on here back to social</p>
<p>media</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>did you get that doc</p>
<p>you know I I didn&rsquo;t hear you can you</p>
<p>repeat that please with great pleasure</p>
<p>Akil from YouTube please talk about how</p>
<p>to manage our weight after gallbladder</p>
<p>removal I&rsquo;m now gaining weight since my</p>
<p>procedure hell</p>
<p>well I think you need to have ADD what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>missing which is the bile I think I</p>
<p>would start adding a bile of supplement</p>
<p>after the meal maybe like two after the</p>
<p>meal</p>
<p>um because now you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>concentration of bile to help really</p>
<p>metabolize this fat so you want to</p>
<p>increase the bile so you with the meal</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s kind of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing and um I mean</p>
<p>probably are just deficient in bile and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re having the problem</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see uh BJ from</p>
<p>YouTube My fasting glucose is 106. what</p>
<p>can I do to bring it down</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>perfectly right</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re on the Keto Plan that I</p>
<p>recommend and if you have high blood</p>
<p>pressure a blood blood sugar like that</p>
<p>which is just it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not not</p>
<p>major but it&rsquo;s still a little high it</p>
<p>could be from another thing which is um</p>
<p>called gluconeogenesis like your liver</p>
<p>is making new sugar because you have</p>
<p>insulin resistance</p>
<p>common problem</p>
<p>um in which case um you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to keep working at it uh keep doing the</p>
<p>keto give it more time and then add</p>
<p>exercise to burn off this extra sugar</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>if you have no sugar and your blood</p>
<p>sugars go high that means your liver is</p>
<p>is basically making the sugar from other</p>
<p>things like proteins so that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>um but</p>
<p>if I had a chance to interview you and</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re eating Donuts on the side I</p>
<p>would say eliminated Donuts so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>Steve like when people eat</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of sugar and you</p>
<p>checked their blood sugars many times</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>because the body is reducing a spiking</p>
<p>insulin so high to remove that sugar</p>
<p>to keeping because the body has this one</p>
<p>thing where like it has to keep normal</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>how could you eat</p>
<p>you know massive sugar and have normal</p>
<p>blood sugars because the insulin is in</p>
<p>the background working really hard and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s never tested</p>
<p>So eventually though it catches up with</p>
<p>you about 10 to 15 years now that</p>
<p>insulin becomes exhausted now the blood</p>
<p>sugars start going up</p>
<p>so again you have to you can&rsquo;t just go</p>
<p>by your blood sugars because it does</p>
<p>take time for the develop development of</p>
<p>that but I will say that um</p>
<p>insulin is is should be tested and the</p>
<p>test that you&rsquo;d want to do is called</p>
<p>Homa IR Homa Dash IR</p>
<p>if your doctor won&rsquo;t do it there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another test you can do which is um</p>
<p>you can uh look this up and do it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>simple it&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>waist to height ratio</p>
<p>and if I&rsquo;m not mistaken that ratio</p>
<p>should be less than uh 50 percent</p>
<p>it should be left less than 50 percent</p>
<p>um and if it&rsquo;s greater than 50 now we</p>
<p>have a problem because it&rsquo;s is your</p>
<p>waist gets bigger</p>
<p>um your your what that means is you have</p>
<p>more insulin resistance it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>little simple test to figure that figure</p>
<p>out your insulin resistance without even</p>
<p>doing a blood test</p>
<p>all right very good now Dr Berg there</p>
<p>was a report that my volume had gone low</p>
<p>can you hear me now</p>
<p>I can hear you perfectly now all right</p>
<p>terrific thanks audience for the tips</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to quiz</p>
<p>question number four which asked of the</p>
<p>audience which common spice has the</p>
<p>greatest effect on stop stopping</p>
<p>menstrual cramping and the audience</p>
<p>jumped on it with a 75 percent of</p>
<p>responding saying it&rsquo;s turmeric 20 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Ginger and five percent say it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cimum among</p>
<p>cinnamon cinnamon is correct wow now</p>
<p>yeah cinnamon normally um is great on</p>
<p>toast with a little sugar right and</p>
<p>butter I&rsquo;m being sarcastic but cinnamon</p>
<p>is good for your blood sugars but it</p>
<p>also has this fascinating potent effect</p>
<p>even more than vitamin D and calcium for</p>
<p>cramping on menstrual cramps very</p>
<p>interesting so if you have the heavy</p>
<p>periods you know cinnamon is what you</p>
<p>need to do but I would I wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hesitate also taking like a calcium</p>
<p>magnesium with vitamin D because</p>
<p>um that will stop a crank up as well</p>
<p>all right very good how wonderful final</p>
<p>question for the day we&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>to all of them today and here it is</p>
<p>all right which Trace mineral protects</p>
<p>your body against the effects of Mercury</p>
<p>as a heavy metal all right Dr Berger are</p>
<p>we still exposed to a lot of that in the</p>
<p>modern day or do they clean that up a</p>
<p>little bit</p>
<p>yeah they they have cleaned it up so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to worry about anymore I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>being very sarcastic now it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>environment</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the environment</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and of course I&rsquo;ve done a video that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to be released on these heavy</p>
<p>metals so you can get more information</p>
<p>but yeah it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>um this new video is going to talk about</p>
<p>what are the skin changes that occur</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re you have exposure to too</p>
<p>much mercury or cadmium or lead</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so stay tuned for that but uh yeah</p>
<p>unfortunately we do live in a toxic</p>
<p>environment Steve I&rsquo;m sorry to break it</p>
<p>to you yeah</p>
<p>all right so let&rsquo;s see uh you&rsquo;re enough</p>
<p>is the person&rsquo;s handle from YouTube is</p>
<p>it possible that methylene blue can</p>
<p>reverse menopause since taking it I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had night sweats in a month and</p>
<p>my cycle has come back what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>that is</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know I would look</p>
<p>at the research methylene blue is is</p>
<p>actually the first drug</p>
<p>that they use way back</p>
<p>over 100 years ago and um it&rsquo;s been so</p>
<p>researched</p>
<p>but it cleans up</p>
<p>um kind of a leaky mitochondria that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>leaking out all these electrons</p>
<p>fascinating research I I did a deep dive</p>
<p>into it I like taking it and um take 20</p>
<p>drops in some water with electrolytes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty good but it does so many</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>um I notice way more energy</p>
<p>but typically it creates some really</p>
<p>interesting effects with a lot of other</p>
<p>things as well I mean almost every</p>
<p>symptom you could imagine but again do</p>
<p>your research look at it and um</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t take high amounts just take</p>
<p>you know 20 drops it&rsquo;s a very small</p>
<p>amount and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fascinating what it does</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a pigment it&rsquo;s a blue</p>
<p>pigment which is bizarre but um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh I have no idea about the</p>
<p>menstrual menstrual cycle though you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have to</p>
<p>see it there&rsquo;s research on that topic</p>
<p>all right very good but it sounds</p>
<p>exciting some of these things are</p>
<p>working let&rsquo;s see Maria from Facebook</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking your sleep aid and it</p>
<p>helps so much except during my period is</p>
<p>it okay to take more than recommended</p>
<p>dose during those time</p>
<p>I would I would take more I would take</p>
<p>more and I would also take some cinnamon</p>
<p>with um also some calcium magnesium and</p>
<p>vitamin D but yeah you can take more</p>
<p>um sometimes I&rsquo;ll take like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take like four at a time</p>
<p>and that just really works works great</p>
<p>but typically I just need one</p>
<p>but I kind of go in Cycles because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know if I do a lot of physical work</p>
<p>around the house</p>
<p>um boy I sleep so much better so those</p>
<p>days I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t take anything</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s remind the</p>
<p>audience again about the swell free app</p>
<p>that Dr Berger&rsquo;s work tirelessly on</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s available on both uh Apple uh OS</p>
<p>and also for Android and so on so get</p>
<p>that and have a virtual uh library of</p>
<p>healthy approaches to life at your</p>
<p>fingertips and let&rsquo;s see quiz question</p>
<p>number five yay audience thank you for</p>
<p>helping me do all of our homework and</p>
<p>this last question asks which Trace</p>
<p>mineral protects your body from the</p>
<p>effects of mercury and 68 of our</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s zinc 20 say</p>
<p>selenium and 12 say it&rsquo;s chromium but</p>
<p>colonate</p>
<p>how do we do</p>
<p>okay so here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>everyone is</p>
<p>partially correct but selenium is is</p>
<p>more protective than zinc but zinc also</p>
<p>still and chromium does protect December</p>
<p>gray for sure so everyone is correct but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the the the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh selenium is has most impact to</p>
<p>preventing this because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s involved in this uh</p>
<p>enzyme that helps bind with the Mercury</p>
<p>and locks it up so it becomes less toxic</p>
<p>on your cells also realize that selenium</p>
<p>is part of</p>
<p>uh glutathione which is another</p>
<p>antioxidant that&rsquo;s very important in our</p>
<p>livers and other places in our body</p>
<p>so the question now is where do you get</p>
<p>selenium</p>
<p>well it just happens to come in the um</p>
<p>the fish that you eat with the Mercury</p>
<p>so um I did a video on what fish has the</p>
<p>most selenium as long as your slinging</p>
<p>is greater than the Mercury you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be okay but also selenium could be</p>
<p>received from just one Brazil nut could</p>
<p>give you enough selenium</p>
<p>again just because a little is good a</p>
<p>lot doesn&rsquo;t make it a lot better so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t start going crazy with the amount</p>
<p>of selenium but we definitely need</p>
<p>selenium and selenium is also very</p>
<p>important Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a thyroid issue</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>and you can also get it from oysters in</p>
<p>other types of shellfish</p>
<p>sounds terrific one of our respondents</p>
<p>was listening and dropped in the Brazil</p>
<p>nuts are a great source of selenium even</p>
<p>before you said it so they&rsquo;re out there</p>
<p>learning and watching they know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on solar X Storm from YouTube</p>
<p>fasting detoxes uh we&rsquo;re doing them like</p>
<p>crazy but it makes it hard for me to</p>
<p>sleep what can I do to address this</p>
<p>issue</p>
<p>well first of all you need to get with</p>
<p>your parents that named you that name</p>
<p>you know you need to no wonder he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nervous and Restless</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>so um yeah when you do fasting sometimes</p>
<p>uh you really uh change your chemistry</p>
<p>and your mitochondria start to grow and</p>
<p>you develop more energy so what I</p>
<p>recommend to do which is the same advice</p>
<p>I would give for someone who&rsquo;s a past</p>
<p>athlete that has developed larger</p>
<p>mitochondria you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>go right to bed without</p>
<p>using up that energy</p>
<p>so both athletes and people that do</p>
<p>fasting just need to exercise a lot more</p>
<p>to be able to kind of drain all this</p>
<p>extra energy versus just going to bed</p>
<p>and trying to go to sleep because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just like laying there with lots of</p>
<p>energy uh it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a big problem</p>
<p>Steve when you have too much energy</p>
<p>um you have to kind of use it up before</p>
<p>you go to sleep sometimes but that being</p>
<p>said</p>
<p>it does take energy to go to sleep and</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re too exhausted they can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sleep huh so it can go both ways all</p>
<p>right I&rsquo;m too tired to sleep yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting I&rsquo;ve been there a couple</p>
<p>times I think uh or especially when you</p>
<p>have two hours before you go back to</p>
<p>work and you&rsquo;ve been out on the town all</p>
<p>night what&rsquo;s the point just go in and</p>
<p>suffer Jimmy from Facebook what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your opinion on putting baking</p>
<p>soda in my coffee to lower the acid</p>
<p>no I don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>first of all it&rsquo;s going to destroy the</p>
<p>taste of it secondly it&rsquo;s just um</p>
<p>why do you want to um</p>
<p>why do you want to take the acid out of</p>
<p>it um you have apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>you have only of nucleic acids you have</p>
<p>fatty acids you have all these acids</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about trying to change</p>
<p>your pH to go one way or the other by</p>
<p>with just a certain type of a remedy I</p>
<p>would just eat healthy and your pH will</p>
<p>go within whatever range it needs to be</p>
<p>in because let&rsquo;s just take for example</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to take this</p>
<p>baking soda and you put in your coffee</p>
<p>to try to consume something alkaline</p>
<p>well guess what your stomach you know</p>
<p>what your pH your stomach is</p>
<p>I mean neutral is seven right your</p>
<p>stomach page is between one and three</p>
<p>that is like battery acid</p>
<p>what about that should we get rid of</p>
<p>that no because you need that acid to</p>
<p>digest the protein</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming in your digestive system</p>
<p>so you start doing the baking soda and</p>
<p>you can alter the um</p>
<p>the stomach pH and now we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the acidity to kill microbes off so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to get sibo small</p>
<p>intestinal bacterial overgrowth</p>
<p>indigestion</p>
<p>you know gas</p>
<p>so this pH in your stomach is really</p>
<p>important and the only time I would</p>
<p>recommend taking baking soda</p>
<p>would be if you had gastritis</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say you had um</p>
<p>an ulcer</p>
<p>and like it&rsquo;s creating a problem</p>
<p>okay go ahead and take it temporarily as</p>
<p>you heal the ulcer but typically</p>
<p>um you got to be careful about messing</p>
<p>with that stomach pH that being said I</p>
<p>think baking soda is definitely better</p>
<p>than</p>
<p>antacids than some of the other things</p>
<p>on that note thank you so much for</p>
<p>listening uh next week we won&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>show because I&rsquo;m going to do my stem</p>
<p>cell stuff I&rsquo;ll let you know what</p>
<p>happens so have a wonderful weekend and</p>
<p>I will see you uh tomorrow and when I</p>
<p>release the video</p>
