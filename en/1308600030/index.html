    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Lex Friedman</p>
<p>as our guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>Dr. Friedman is a researcher at MIT</p>
<p>specializing in machine learning, artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>and human-robot interactions.</p>
<p>I must say that the conversation with Lex</p>
<p>was, without question,</p>
<p>one of the most fascinating conversations</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever had,</p>
<p>not just in my career, but in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I knew that Lex worked on these topics,</p>
<p>and I think many of you are probably familiar with Lex</p>
<p>and his interest in these topics</p>
<p>from his incredible podcast, the Lex Friedman Podcast.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already watching that podcast,</p>
<p>please subscribe to it.</p>
<p>It is absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>But in holding this conversation with Lex,</p>
<p>I realized something far more important.</p>
<p>He revealed to us a bit of his dream,</p>
<p>his dream about humans and robots,</p>
<p>about humans and machines,</p>
<p>and about how those interactions</p>
<p>can change the way that we perceive ourselves</p>
<p>and that we interact with the world.</p>
<p>We discuss relationships of all kinds,</p>
<p>relationships with animals,</p>
<p>relationships with friends,</p>
<p>relationships with family,</p>
<p>and romantic relationships.</p>
<p>And we discuss relationships with machines,</p>
<p>machines that move and machines that don&rsquo;t move,</p>
<p>and machines that come to understand us</p>
<p>in ways that we could never understand for ourselves,</p>
<p>and how those machines can educate us about ourselves.</p>
<p>Before this conversation,</p>
<p>I had no concept of the ways in which machines</p>
<p>could inform me or anyone about themselves.</p>
<p>By the end, I was absolutely taken with the idea,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still taken with the idea</p>
<p>that interactions with machines of a very particular kind,</p>
<p>a kind that Lex understands and wants to bring to the world,</p>
<p>can not only transform the self,</p>
<p>but may very well transform humanity.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with Dr. Lex Friedman or not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;re going to learn a tremendous amount</p>
<p>from him during the course of our discussion,</p>
<p>and that it will transform the way you think</p>
<p>about yourself and about the world.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I want to mention that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system relevant</p>
<p>to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single-ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now my conversation with Dr. Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>We meet again.</p>
<p>We meet again.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for sitting down with me.</p>
<p>I have a question that I think</p>
<p>is on a lot of people&rsquo;s minds,</p>
<p>or ought to be on a lot of people&rsquo;s minds,</p>
<p>because we hear these terms a lot these days,</p>
<p>but I think most people, including most scientists,</p>
<p>and including me, don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>really what is artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>and how is it different from things</p>
<p>like machine learning and robotics.</p>
<p>So if you would be so kind as to explain to us</p>
<p>what is artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>and what is machine learning?</p>
<p>Well, I think that question is as complicated</p>
<p>and as fascinating as the question of what is intelligence.</p>
<p>So I think of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>first as a big philosophical thing.</p>
<p>Pamela McCordick said AI was,</p>
<p>AI was the ancient wish to forge the gods,</p>
<p>or was born as an ancient wish to forge the gods.</p>
<p>So I think at the big philosophical level,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our longing to create other intelligent systems,</p>
<p>perhaps systems more powerful than us.</p>
<p>At the more narrow level,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also a set of tools</p>
<p>that are computational mathematical tools</p>
<p>to automate different tasks.</p>
<p>And then also it&rsquo;s our attempt to understand our own mind.</p>
<p>So build systems that exhibit some intelligent behavior</p>
<p>in order to understand what is intelligence</p>
<p>in our own selves.</p>
<p>So all of those things are true.</p>
<p>Of course, what AI really means is a community</p>
<p>as a set of researchers and engineers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a set of tools, a set of computational techniques</p>
<p>that allow you to solve various problems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long history that approaches the problem</p>
<p>from different perspectives.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s always been throughout one of the threads,</p>
<p>one of the communities,</p>
<p>goes under the flag of machine learning,</p>
<p>which is emphasizing in the AI space,</p>
<p>the task of learning.</p>
<p>How do you make a machine</p>
<p>that knows very little in the beginning,</p>
<p>follow some kind of process</p>
<p>and learns to become better and better at a particular task?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been most very effective in the recent,</p>
<p>about 15 years, is a set of techniques</p>
<p>that fall under the flag of deep learning</p>
<p>that utilize neural networks.</p>
<p>What neural networks are,</p>
<p>are these fascinating things inspired</p>
<p>by the structure of the human brain very loosely,</p>
<p>but they have, it&rsquo;s a network</p>
<p>of these little basic computational units called neurons,</p>
<p>artificial neurons.</p>
<p>And they have, these architectures have an input and output.</p>
<p>They know nothing in the beginning</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re tasked with learning something interesting.</p>
<p>What that something interesting is,</p>
<p>usually involves a particular task.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ways to talk about this and break this down.</p>
<p>Like one of them is how much human supervision</p>
<p>is required to teach this thing.</p>
<p>So supervised learning, this broad category,</p>
<p>is the neural network knows nothing in the beginning.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s given a bunch of examples</p>
<p>in computer vision that will be examples of cats,</p>
<p>dogs, cars, traffic signs.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re given the image</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re given the ground truth of what&rsquo;s in that image.</p>
<p>And when you get a large database of such image examples</p>
<p>where you know the truth,</p>
<p>the neural network is able to learn by example.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called supervised learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating questions within that,</p>
<p>which is how do you provide the truth?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re given an image of a cat,</p>
<p>how do you provide to the computer</p>
<p>that this image contains a cat?</p>
<p>Do you just say the entire image is a picture of a cat?</p>
<p>Do you do what&rsquo;s very commonly been done,</p>
<p>which is a bounding box?</p>
<p>You have a very crude box around the cat&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>saying this is a cat.</p>
<p>Do you do semantic segmentation?</p>
<p>Mind you, this is a 2D image of a cat.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a,</p>
<p>the computer knows nothing about our three-dimensional world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just looking at a set of pixels.</p>
<p>So semantic segmentation is drawing a nice,</p>
<p>very crisp outline around the cat</p>
<p>and saying that&rsquo;s a cat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really difficult to provide that truth.</p>
<p>And one of the fundamental open questions</p>
<p>in computer vision is,</p>
<p>is that even a good representation of the truth?</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s another contrasting set of ideas</p>
<p>that are attention, they&rsquo;re overlapping,</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s used to be called unsupervised learning,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s commonly now called self-supervised learning,</p>
<p>which is trying to get less and less</p>
<p>and less human supervision into the task.</p>
<p>So self-supervised learning is more,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been very successful in the domain of language models,</p>
<p>natural language processing,</p>
<p>and now more and more it&rsquo;s being successful</p>
<p>in computer vision tasks.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the idea there is,</p>
<p>let the machine without any ground truth annotation,</p>
<p>just look at pictures on the internet</p>
<p>or look at texts on the internet</p>
<p>and try to learn something generalizable</p>
<p>about the ideas that are at the core of language</p>
<p>or at the core of vision.</p>
<p>And based on that, we humans at its best</p>
<p>like to call that common sense.</p>
<p>So we have this giant base of knowledge</p>
<p>on top of which we build more sophisticated knowledge,</p>
<p>but we have this kind of common sense knowledge.</p>
<p>And so the idea with self-supervised learning</p>
<p>is to build this common sense knowledge</p>
<p>about what are the fundamental visual ideas</p>
<p>that make up a cat and a dog and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>without ever having human supervision.</p>
<p>The dream there is you just let an AI system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s self-supervised run around the internet for a while,</p>
<p>watch YouTube videos for millions and millions of hours</p>
<p>and without any supervision be primed</p>
<p>and ready to actually learn with very few examples</p>
<p>once the human is able to show up.</p>
<p>We think of children in this way, human children,</p>
<p>is your parents only give one or two examples</p>
<p>to teach a concept.</p>
<p>The dream with self-supervised learning</p>
<p>is that would be the same with machines,</p>
<p>that they would watch millions of hours of YouTube videos</p>
<p>and then come to a human and be able to understand</p>
<p>when the human shows them, this is a cat.</p>
<p>Like, remember, this is a cat.</p>
<p>They will understand that a cat</p>
<p>is not just a thing with pointy ears</p>
<p>or a cat is a thing that&rsquo;s orange or is furry.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll see something more fundamental</p>
<p>that we humans might not actually be able to introspect</p>
<p>and understand.</p>
<p>Like, if I asked you what makes a cat versus a dog,</p>
<p>you would probably not be able to answer that.</p>
<p>But if I showed you, brought to you a cat and a dog,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>What are the ideas that your brain uses</p>
<p>to make that difference?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole dream with self-supervised learning</p>
<p>is it would be able to learn that on its own,</p>
<p>that set of common sense knowledge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to tell the difference.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like a lot of incredible uses</p>
<p>of self-supervised learning,</p>
<p>very weirdly called self-play mechanism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the mechanism behind</p>
<p>the reinforcement learning successes of the systems</p>
<p>that wanted to go at AlphaZero, that wanted chess.</p>
<p>Oh, I see, that play games.</p>
<p>That play games.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So the idea of self-play,</p>
<p>this probably applies to other domains than just games,</p>
<p>is a system that just plays against itself.</p>
<p>And this is fascinating in all kinds of domains,</p>
<p>but it knows nothing in the beginning.</p>
<p>And the whole idea is it creates a bunch of mutations</p>
<p>of itself and plays against those versions of itself.</p>
<p>And the fascinating thing is when you play against systems</p>
<p>that are a little bit better than you,</p>
<p>you start to get better yourself.</p>
<p>Like learning, that&rsquo;s how learning happens.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for martial arts,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true in a lot of cases,</p>
<p>where you want to be interacting with systems</p>
<p>that are just a little better than you.</p>
<p>And then through this process of interacting with systems</p>
<p>just a little better than you,</p>
<p>you start following this process</p>
<p>where everybody starts getting better and better</p>
<p>and better and better</p>
<p>until you are several orders of magnitude better</p>
<p>than the world champion in chess, for example.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating because it&rsquo;s like a runaway system.</p>
<p>One of the most terrifying and exciting things</p>
<p>that David Silver, the creator of AlphaGo and AlphaZero,</p>
<p>one of the leaders of the team said to me,</p>
<p>is they haven&rsquo;t found the ceiling for AlphaZero,</p>
<p>meaning it could just arbitrarily keep improving.</p>
<p>Now in the realm of chess, that doesn&rsquo;t matter to us,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like, it just ran away with the game of chess.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just so much better than humans.</p>
<p>But the question is, if you can create that in the realm</p>
<p>that does have a bigger, deeper effect on human beings,</p>
<p>on societies, that can be a terrifying process.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s an exciting process</p>
<p>if you supervise it correctly.</p>
<p>If you inject what&rsquo;s called value alignment,</p>
<p>you make sure that the goals that the AI is optimizing</p>
<p>is aligned with human beings and human societies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fascinating things to talk about</p>
<p>within the specifics of neural networks</p>
<p>and all the problems that people are working on.</p>
<p>But I would say the really big exciting one</p>
<p>is self-supervised learning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to get less and less human supervision,</p>
<p>less and less human supervision of neural networks.</p>
<p>Just a comment, and I&rsquo;ll shut up.</p>
<p>No, please keep going.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning.</p>
<p>I have questions, but I&rsquo;m learning, so please keep going.</p>
<p>So to me, what&rsquo;s exciting is not the theory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the application.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting applications</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>specifically neural networks and machine learning,</p>
<p>is Tesla autopilot.</p>
<p>So these are systems that are working in the real world.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an academic exercise.</p>
<p>This is human lives at stake.</p>
<p>This is safety critical.</p>
<p>These are automated vehicles, autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Semi-autonomous, we&rsquo;ve gone through wars on these topics.</p>
<p>Semi-autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Semi-autonomous.</p>
<p>So even though it&rsquo;s called FSD, full self-driving,</p>
<p>it is currently not fully autonomous,</p>
<p>meaning human supervision is required.</p>
<p>So human is tasked with overseeing the systems.</p>
<p>In fact, liability-wise, the human is always responsible.</p>
<p>This is a human factor psychology question,</p>
<p>which is fascinating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the whole space,</p>
<p>which is a whole nother space, of human-robot interaction.</p>
<p>When AI systems and humans work together</p>
<p>to accomplish tasks.</p>
<p>That dance to me is one of the smaller communities,</p>
<p>but I think it will be one of the most important</p>
<p>open problems once they&rsquo;re solved,</p>
<p>is how do humans and robots dance together?</p>
<p>To me, semi-autonomous driving is one of those spaces.</p>
<p>So for Elon, for example, he doesn&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p>He sees semi-autonomous driving as a stepping stone</p>
<p>towards fully autonomous driving.</p>
<p>Like humans and robots can&rsquo;t dance well together.</p>
<p>Like humans and humans dance and robots and robots dance.</p>
<p>Like we need to, this is an engineering problem.</p>
<p>We need to design a perfect robot that solves this problem.</p>
<p>To me forever, maybe this is not the case with driving,</p>
<p>but the world is going to be full of problems</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s always humans and robots have to interact.</p>
<p>Because I think robots will always be flawed,</p>
<p>just like humans are going to be flawed, are flawed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes life beautiful, that they&rsquo;re flawed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where learning happens</p>
<p>at the edge of your capabilities.</p>
<p>So you always have to figure out</p>
<p>how can flawed robots and flawed humans interact together</p>
<p>such that the sum is bigger than the whole,</p>
<p>as opposed to focusing on just building the perfect robot.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the most exciting applications,</p>
<p>I would say of artificial intelligence to me</p>
<p>is autonomous driving and semi-autonomous driving.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really good example of machine learning</p>
<p>because those systems are constantly learning.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a process there that maybe I can comment on,</p>
<p>the Andrej Karpathy, who&rsquo;s the head of Autopilot,</p>
<p>calls it the data engine.</p>
<p>And this process applies for a lot of machine learning,</p>
<p>which is you build a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty good at doing stuff.</p>
<p>You send it out into the real world,</p>
<p>it starts doing the stuff,</p>
<p>and then it runs into what are called edge cases,</p>
<p>like failure cases, where it screws up.</p>
<p>You know, we do this as kids, that, you know,</p>
<p>you have-</p>
<p>We do this as adults.</p>
<p>We do this as adults, exactly.</p>
<p>But we learn really quickly.</p>
<p>But the whole point,</p>
<p>and this is the fascinating thing about driving,</p>
<p>is you realize there&rsquo;s millions of edge cases.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just like weird situations that you did not expect.</p>
<p>And so the data engine process is,</p>
<p>you collect those edge cases,</p>
<p>and then you go back to the drawing board</p>
<p>and learn from them.</p>
<p>And so you have to create this data pipeline</p>
<p>where all these cars,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of cars are driving around,</p>
<p>and something weird happens.</p>
<p>And so whenever this weird detector fires,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another important concept,</p>
<p>that piece of data goes back to the mothership</p>
<p>for the training, for the retraining of the system.</p>
<p>And through this data engine process,</p>
<p>it keeps improving</p>
<p>and getting better and better and better and better.</p>
<p>So basically, you send out a pretty clever AI systems</p>
<p>out into the world</p>
<p>and let it find the edge cases.</p>
<p>Let it screw up just enough</p>
<p>to figure out where the edge cases are,</p>
<p>and then go back and learn from them,</p>
<p>and then send out that new version</p>
<p>and keep updating that version.</p>
<p>Is the updating done by humans?</p>
<p>The annotation is done by humans.</p>
<p>So you have to,</p>
<p>the weird examples come back, the edge cases,</p>
<p>and you have to label what actually happened in there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some mechanisms for automatically labeling,</p>
<p>but mostly I think you always have to rely on humans</p>
<p>to improve, to understand what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the weird cases.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a lot of debate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the other thing,</p>
<p>what is artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>Which is a bunch of smart people</p>
<p>having very different opinions about what is intelligence.</p>
<p>So AI is basically a community of people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t agree on anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, that seems to be the case.</p>
<p>And first of all,</p>
<p>this is a beautiful description of terms</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve heard many times</p>
<p>among my colleagues at Stanford,</p>
<p>at meetings in the outside world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many fascinating things.</p>
<p>I have so many questions,</p>
<p>but I do want to ask one question about the culture of AI,</p>
<p>because it does seem to be a community where,</p>
<p>at least as an outsider,</p>
<p>where it seems like there&rsquo;s very little consensus</p>
<p>about what the terms</p>
<p>and the operational definitions even mean.</p>
<p>And there seems to be a lot of splitting happening now</p>
<p>of not just supervised and unsupervised learning,</p>
<p>but these sort of intermediate conditions</p>
<p>where machines are autonomous,</p>
<p>but then go back for more instruction.</p>
<p>Like kids go home from college during the summer</p>
<p>and get a little, you know, mom still feeds them.</p>
<p>Then eventually they leave the nest kind of thing.</p>
<p>Is there something in particular about engineers</p>
<p>or about people in this realm of engineering</p>
<p>that you think lends itself to disagreement?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think,</p>
<p>so first of all,</p>
<p>the more specific you get,</p>
<p>the less disagreement there is.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of disagreement</p>
<p>about what is artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s less disagreement</p>
<p>about what is machine learning.</p>
<p>And even less when you talk about active learning</p>
<p>or machine teaching or self-supervised learning.</p>
<p>And then when you get into like NLP language models</p>
<p>or transformers,</p>
<p>when you get into specific neural network architectures,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s less and less and less disagreement</p>
<p>about those terms.</p>
<p>So you might be hearing the disagreement</p>
<p>from the high level terms.</p>
<p>And that has to do with the fact that engineering,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re talking about intelligent systems,</p>
<p>is a little bit of an art and a science.</p>
<p>So the art part is the thing that creates disagreements</p>
<p>because then you start having disagreements</p>
<p>about how easy or difficult a particular problem is.</p>
<p>For example, a lot of people disagree with Elon,</p>
<p>how difficult the problem of autonomous driving is.</p>
<p>But nobody knows.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of disagreement</p>
<p>about what are the limits of these techniques.</p>
<p>And through that,</p>
<p>the terminology also contains within it the disagreements.</p>
<p>But overall, I think it&rsquo;s also a young science</p>
<p>that also has to do with that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just engineering,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that artificial intelligence truly</p>
<p>as a large-scale discipline</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s thousands, tens of thousands,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of people working on it,</p>
<p>huge amounts of money being made.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very recent thing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to figure out those terms.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s egos and personalities</p>
<p>and a lot of fame to be made.</p>
<p>Like the term deep learning, for example.</p>
<p>Neural networks have been around for many, many decades,</p>
<p>since the 60s, you can argue since the 40s.</p>
<p>So there was a rebranding of neural networks</p>
<p>into the word deep learning, term deep learning,</p>
<p>that was part of the reinvigoration of the field.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really the same exact thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>I mean, I grew up in the age of neuroscience</p>
<p>when neural networks were discussed.</p>
<p>Computational neuroscience and theoretical neuroscience,</p>
<p>they had their own journals.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t actually taken terribly seriously</p>
<p>by experimentalists until a few years ago.</p>
<p>I would say about five to seven years ago,</p>
<p>excellent theoretical neuroscientists like Larry Abbott</p>
<p>and other colleagues, certainly at Stanford as well,</p>
<p>that people started paying attention</p>
<p>to computational methods.</p>
<p>But these terms, neural networks, computational methods,</p>
<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t know that neural networks</p>
<p>and deep learning, those have now become kind of synonymous.</p>
<p>No, they were always the same thing.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a neuroscientist and I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So, well, because neural networks</p>
<p>probably means something else in neuroscience.</p>
<p>Not something else, but a little different flavor,</p>
<p>depending on the field.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fascinating too, because neuroscience and AI,</p>
<p>people have started working together and dancing a lot more</p>
<p>in the recent, I would say probably decade.</p>
<p>Oh, machines are going into the brain.</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions,</p>
<p>but one thing that I&rsquo;m sort of fixated on</p>
<p>that I find incredibly interesting</p>
<p>is this example you gave of playing a game</p>
<p>with a mutated version of yourself as a competitor.</p>
<p>I find that incredibly interesting</p>
<p>as a kind of a parallel or a mirror</p>
<p>for what happens when we try and learn as humans,</p>
<p>which is we generate repetitions</p>
<p>of whatever it is we&rsquo;re trying to learn,</p>
<p>and we make errors.</p>
<p>Occasionally we succeed.</p>
<p>In a simple example, for instance,</p>
<p>of trying to throw bullseyes on a dartboard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have errors, errors, errors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably miss the dartboard</p>
<p>and maybe occasionally hit a bullseye.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I just did, right?</p>
<p>But then let&rsquo;s say I was playing darts</p>
<p>against a version of myself</p>
<p>where I was wearing a visual prism,</p>
<p>like I had a visual defect.</p>
<p>You learn certain things in that mode as well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that a machine can sort of mutate itself.</p>
<p>Does the mutation always cause a deficiency</p>
<p>that it needs to overcome?</p>
<p>Because mutations in biology</p>
<p>sometimes give us superpowers, right?</p>
<p>Occasionally you&rsquo;ll get somebody</p>
<p>who has better than 20-20 vision,</p>
<p>and they can see better than 99.9% of people out there.</p>
<p>So when you talk about a machine playing a game</p>
<p>against a mutated version of itself,</p>
<p>is the mutation always what we would call</p>
<p>a negative mutation or an adaptive</p>
<p>or a maladaptive mutation?</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t know until you get,</p>
<p>so you mutate first and then figure out</p>
<p>and they compete against each other.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re evolving,</p>
<p>the machine gets to evolve itself in real time.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think of it,</p>
<p>which would be exciting if you could actually do with humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, so usually you freeze a version</p>
<p>of the system.</p>
<p>So really you take an Andrew of yesterday</p>
<p>and you make 10 clones of them.</p>
<p>And then maybe you mutate, maybe not.</p>
<p>And then you do a bunch of competitions</p>
<p>of the Andrew of today.</p>
<p>Like you fight to the death, who wins last?</p>
<p>So I love that idea of like creating a bunch of clones</p>
<p>of myself from each of the day for the past year</p>
<p>and just seeing who&rsquo;s going to be better</p>
<p>at like podcasting or science or picking up chicks at a bar</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, or competing in jujitsu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one way to do it.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of Lexus would have to die for that process,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s essentially what happens</p>
<p>is in reinforcement learning</p>
<p>through the self-play mechanisms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a graveyard of systems that didn&rsquo;t do that well.</p>
<p>And the surviving, the good ones survive.</p>
<p>Do you think that, I mean, Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution</p>
<p>might have worked in some sense in this way,</p>
<p>but at the population level?</p>
<p>I mean, you get a bunch of birds with different shaped beaks</p>
<p>and some birds have the shaped beak</p>
<p>that allows them to get the seeds.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a trivially simple example</p>
<p>of Darwinian evolution, but I think it&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>if not, even though it&rsquo;s not exhaustive.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re referring to?</p>
<p>You essentially that normally this is done</p>
<p>between members of a different species,</p>
<p>lots of different members of species</p>
<p>have different traits and some get selected for,</p>
<p>but you could actually create multiple versions of yourself</p>
<p>with different traits.</p>
<p>So with, I should probably have said this,</p>
<p>but perhaps it&rsquo;s implied with machine learning</p>
<p>or the reinforcement learning through these processes,</p>
<p>one of the big requirements</p>
<p>is to have an objective function, a loss function,</p>
<p>a utility function,</p>
<p>those are all different terms for the same thing,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s like an equation that says what&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re trying to optimize that equation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a clear goal for these systems.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a game, like with chess, there&rsquo;s a goal.</p>
<p>But for anything, anything you want machine learning</p>
<p>to solve, there needs to be an objective function.</p>
<p>In machine learning, it&rsquo;s usually called loss function</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re optimizing.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about evolution,</p>
<p>complicated of course,</p>
<p>but the goal also seems to be evolving.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a, I guess,</p>
<p>adaptation to the environment is the goal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s unclear you can convert that always.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like survival of the fittest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear what the fittest is.</p>
<p>In machine learning, the starting point,</p>
<p>and this is like what human ingenuity provides,</p>
<p>is that fitness function of what&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>which it lets you know which of the systems</p>
<p>is going to win.</p>
<p>So you need to have a equation like that.</p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about humans</p>
<p>is we figure out objective functions for ourselves.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Like why the hell are we here?</p>
<p>And a machine currently has to have</p>
<p>a hard-coded statement about why.</p>
<p>It has to have a meaning of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>based life.</p>
<p>Right, it can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting explorations</p>
<p>about that function being more about curiosity,</p>
<p>about learning new things and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still hard-coded.</p>
<p>If you want a machine to be able to be good at stuff,</p>
<p>it has to be given very clear statements</p>
<p>of what good at stuff means.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the challenges of artificial intelligence</p>
<p>is you have to formalize the,</p>
<p>in order to solve a problem, you have to formalize it,</p>
<p>and you have to provide both like</p>
<p>the full sensory information,</p>
<p>you have to be very clear about</p>
<p>what is the data that&rsquo;s being collected,</p>
<p>and you have to also be clear about the objective function.</p>
<p>What is the goal that you&rsquo;re trying to reach?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very difficult thing</p>
<p>for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I love that you mentioned curiosity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this definition falls short in many ways,</p>
<p>but I define curiosity as a strong interest</p>
<p>in knowing something,</p>
<p>but without an attachment to the outcome.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s sort of a,</p>
<p>it could be a random search,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not really an emotional attachment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just a desire to discover</p>
<p>and unveil what&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>without hoping it&rsquo;s a gold coin under a rock.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just looking under rocks.</p>
<p>Is that more or less how the machine,</p>
<p>you know, within machine learning,</p>
<p>it sounds like there are elements of reward prediction</p>
<p>and, you know, rewards the machine has to know</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s done the right thing.</p>
<p>So can you make machines that are curious</p>
<p>or are the sorts of machines that you are describing</p>
<p>curious by design?</p>
<p>Yeah, curiosity is a kind of a symptom,</p>
<p>not the goal.</p>
<p>So what happens is one of the big trade-offs</p>
<p>in reinforcement learning</p>
<p>is this exploration versus exploitation.</p>
<p>So when you know very little,</p>
<p>it pays off to explore a lot,</p>
<p>even suboptimal, like even trajectories</p>
<p>that seem like they&rsquo;re not going to lead anywhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called exploration.</p>
<p>The smarter and smarter and smarter you get,</p>
<p>the more emphasis you put on exploitation,</p>
<p>meaning you take the best solution.</p>
<p>You take the best path.</p>
<p>Now, through that process,</p>
<p>the exploration can look like curiosity by us humans,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really just trying to get out of the local optimal</p>
<p>of the thing that&rsquo;s already discovered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from an AI perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always looking to optimize the objective function.</p>
<p>It derives, and we could talk about this a lot more,</p>
<p>but in terms of the tools of machine learning today,</p>
<p>it derives no pleasure from just the curiosity of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, discovery.</p>
<p>That moment.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no dopamine for a machine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no dopamine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reward system, chemical,</p>
<p>or I guess electronic reward system.</p>
<p>That said, if you look at machine learning literature</p>
<p>and reinforcement learning literature,</p>
<p>they will use like deep mind,</p>
<p>will use terms like dopamine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re constantly trying to use the human brain</p>
<p>to inspire totally new solutions to these problems.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll think like,</p>
<p>how does dopamine function in the human brain?</p>
<p>And how can that lead to more interesting ways</p>
<p>to discover optimal solutions?</p>
<p>But ultimately, currently,</p>
<p>there has to be a formal objective function.</p>
<p>Now you could argue that humans also has a set</p>
<p>of objective functions we&rsquo;re trying to optimize.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just not able to introspect them.</p>
<p>Yeah, we don&rsquo;t actually know what we&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>and seeking and doing.</p>
<p>Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett,</p>
<p>who you&rsquo;ve spoken with at least on Instagram,</p>
<p>I hope you get-</p>
<p>I met her through you, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hope you actually have her on this podcast.</p>
<p>That would be terrific.</p>
<p>So she has a very,</p>
<p>it has to do with homeostasis,</p>
<p>like that basically there&rsquo;s a very dumb objective function</p>
<p>that the brain is trying to optimize,</p>
<p>like to keep like body temperature the same.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a very dumb kind</p>
<p>of optimization function happening.</p>
<p>And then what we humans do with our fancy consciousness</p>
<p>and cognitive abilities is we tell stories to ourselves</p>
<p>so we can have nice podcasts,</p>
<p>but really it&rsquo;s the brain trying to maintain</p>
<p>just like healthy state, I guess.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I also see the human brain</p>
<p>and I hope artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>as not just systems that solve problems or optimize a goal,</p>
<p>but also storytellers.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a power to telling stories.</p>
<p>We tell stories to each other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what communication is.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re alone, that&rsquo;s when you solve problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it makes sense to talk about solving problems.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re a community,</p>
<p>the capability to communicate, tell stories,</p>
<p>share ideas in such a way that those ideas are stable</p>
<p>over a long period of time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s being a charismatic storyteller.</p>
<p>And I think both humans are very good at this,</p>
<p>I would argue that&rsquo;s why we are who we are</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re great storytellers.</p>
<p>And AI, I hope will also become that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about being able to solve problems</p>
<p>with a clear objective function,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s afterwards be able to tell like a way better,</p>
<p>like make up a way better story</p>
<p>about why you did something or why you failed.</p>
<p>So you think that robots and or machines of some sort</p>
<p>are going to start telling humans stories?</p>
<p>Well, definitely.</p>
<p>So the technical field for that is called explainable AI,</p>
<p>explainable artificial intelligence</p>
<p>is trying to figure out how you get the AI system</p>
<p>to explain to us humans why the hell it failed</p>
<p>or why it succeeded.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a lot of different sort of versions of this</p>
<p>or to visualize how it understands the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really difficult problem,</p>
<p>especially when neural networks that are famously opaque,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand in many cases</p>
<p>why a particular neural network does what it does so well.</p>
<p>And to try to figure out where it&rsquo;s going to fail,</p>
<p>that requires the AI to explain itself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge amount of money,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a huge amount of money in this,</p>
<p>especially from government funding and so on.</p>
<p>Because if you wanna deploy AI systems in the real world,</p>
<p>we humans at least wanna ask it a question like,</p>
<p>why the hell did you do that?</p>
<p>Like in a dark way, why did you just kill that person?</p>
<p>Right, like if a car ran over a person,</p>
<p>we want to understand why that happened.</p>
<p>And now again, we&rsquo;re sometimes very unfair to AI systems</p>
<p>because we humans can often not explain why very well.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the field of explainable AI.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very, people are very interested in</p>
<p>because the more and more we rely on AI systems,</p>
<p>like the Twitter recommender system, that AI algorithm,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, I would say, impacting elections,</p>
<p>perhaps starting wars or at least military conflict.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that algorithm, we wanna ask that algorithm,</p>
<p>first of all, do you know what the hell you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Do you know, do you understand</p>
<p>the society level effects you&rsquo;re having?</p>
<p>And can you explain the possible other trajectories?</p>
<p>Like we would have that kind of conversation with a human,</p>
<p>we wanna be able to do that with an AI.</p>
<p>And in my own personal level,</p>
<p>I think it would be nice to talk to AI systems</p>
<p>for stupid stuff, like robots, when they fail to-</p>
<p>Why do you fall down the stairs?</p>
<p>Yeah, but not an engineering question,</p>
<p>but almost like endearing question.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m looking for, if I fell</p>
<p>and you and I were hanging out,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need an explanation</p>
<p>exactly what were the dynamic,</p>
<p>like what was the underactuated system problem here?</p>
<p>Like what was the texture of the floor or so on?</p>
<p>Or like, what was the-</p>
<p>No, I wanna know what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>That, or you might joke about like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re drunk again, go home or something.</p>
<p>Like there could be humor in it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an opportunity, like storytelling</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just explanation of what happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that makes people laugh,</p>
<p>makes people fall in love, makes people dream</p>
<p>and understand things in a way</p>
<p>that poetry makes people understand things</p>
<p>as opposed to a rigorous log of where every sensor was,</p>
<p>where every actuator was.</p>
<p>I mean, I find this incredible because,</p>
<p>one of the hallmarks of severe autism spectrum disorders</p>
<p>is a report of experience from the autistic person</p>
<p>that is very much a catalog of action steps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how do you feel today?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, well, I got up and I did this</p>
<p>and then I did this and I did this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not at all the way that a person</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have autism spectrum disorder would respond.</p>
<p>And the way you describe these machines</p>
<p>has so much humanism or so much of a human</p>
<p>and biological element.</p>
<p>But I realized that we were talking about machines.</p>
<p>I wanna make sure that I understand</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a distinction between a machine</p>
<p>that learns, a machine with artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and a robot.</p>
<p>At what point does a machine become a robot?</p>
<p>So if I have a ballpoint pen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming I wouldn&rsquo;t call that a robot.</p>
<p>But if my ballpoint pen can come to me</p>
<p>when I move to the opposite side of the table,</p>
<p>if it moves by whatever mechanism,</p>
<p>at that point, does it become a robot?</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a million ways to explore this question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating one.</p>
<p>So first of all, there&rsquo;s a question of what is life?</p>
<p>Like, how do you know something is a living form and not?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s similar to the question of when does sort of</p>
<p>maybe a cold computational system becomes a&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re already loading these words</p>
<p>with a lot of meaning, robot and machine.</p>
<p>But so one, I think movement is important,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of a boring idea</p>
<p>that a robot is just a machine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to act in the world.</p>
<p>So one, artificial intelligence could be</p>
<p>both just the thinking thing,</p>
<p>which I think is what machine learning is,</p>
<p>and also the acting thing,</p>
<p>which is what we usually think about robots.</p>
<p>So robots are the things that have a perception system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to take in the world,</p>
<p>however you define the world,</p>
<p>is able to think and learn</p>
<p>and do whatever the hell it does inside</p>
<p>and then act on the world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the difference between</p>
<p>maybe an AI system or a machine and a robot.</p>
<p>A robot is something that&rsquo;s able to perceive the world</p>
<p>and act in the world.</p>
<p>So it could be through language or sound,</p>
<p>or it could be through movement or both.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think it could also be in the digital space</p>
<p>as long as there&rsquo;s a aspect of entity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s inside the machine</p>
<p>and a world that&rsquo;s outside the machine.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sense in which the machine</p>
<p>is sensing that world and acting in it.</p>
<p>So we could, for instance,</p>
<p>there could be a version of a robot,</p>
<p>according to the definition that I think you&rsquo;re providing,</p>
<p>where the robot, where I go to sleep at night</p>
<p>and this robot goes and forges for information</p>
<p>that it thinks I want to see</p>
<p>loaded onto my desktop in the morning.</p>
<p>There was no movement of that machine.</p>
<p>There was no language,</p>
<p>but it essentially has movement in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a distinction that I think is important</p>
<p>in that there&rsquo;s an element of it being an entity,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in the digital or the physical space.</p>
<p>So when you have something like Alexa in your home,</p>
<p>most of the speech recognition,</p>
<p>most of what Alexa is doing</p>
<p>is constantly being sent back to the mothership.</p>
<p>When Alexa is there on its own,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s to me a robot.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s there interacting with the world,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s simply a finger of the main mothership,</p>
<p>then Alexa is not a robot.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s just an interaction device.</p>
<p>Then maybe the main Amazon Alexa AI big, big system</p>
<p>is the robot.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s important because there&rsquo;s some element</p>
<p>to us humans, I think,</p>
<p>where we want there to be an entity,</p>
<p>whether in the digital or the physical space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where ideas of consciousness come in</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>that we project our understanding</p>
<p>what it means to be a being.</p>
<p>And so to take that further,</p>
<p>when does a machine become a robot?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a special moment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a special moment in a person&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>in a robot&rsquo;s life where it surprises you.</p>
<p>I think surprise is a really powerful thing</p>
<p>where you know how the thing works</p>
<p>and yet it surprises you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a magical moment for us humans.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s a chess playing program</p>
<p>that does something that you haven&rsquo;t seen before</p>
<p>that makes people smile, like, huh.</p>
<p>Those moments happen with AlphaZero</p>
<p>for the first time in chess playing</p>
<p>where grandmasters were really surprised by a move.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t understand the move</p>
<p>and then they studied and studied</p>
<p>and then they understood it.</p>
<p>But that moment of surprise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for grandmasters in chess.</p>
<p>I find that moment of surprise really powerful,</p>
<p>really magical in just everyday life.</p>
<p>Because it supersedes the human brain in that moment?</p>
<p>Not, so it&rsquo;s not supersedes like outperforms</p>
<p>but surprises you in a positive sense.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t think you could do that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think that you had that in you.</p>
<p>And I think that moment is a big transition for a robot</p>
<p>from a moment of being a servant</p>
<p>that accomplishes a particular task</p>
<p>with some level of accuracy,</p>
<p>with some rate of failure to an entity,</p>
<p>a being that&rsquo;s struggling just like you are in this world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really important moment</p>
<p>that I think you&rsquo;re not gonna find many people</p>
<p>in the AI community that talk like I just did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not speaking like some philosopher or some hippie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking from purely engineering perspective.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important for robots to become entities</p>
<p>and explore that as a real engineering problem.</p>
<p>As opposed to, everybody treats robots</p>
<p>in the robotics community.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even call them a he or she.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t give them, try to avoid giving them names.</p>
<p>They really want to see it like a system, like a servant.</p>
<p>They see it as a servant that&rsquo;s trying to accomplish a task.</p>
<p>To me, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m just romanticizing the notion.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently perhaps a dumb being,</p>
<p>but in the long arc of history,</p>
<p>humans are pretty dumb beings too.</p>
<p>I would agree with that statement.</p>
<p>So I tend to really want to explore this,</p>
<p>treating robots really as entities.</p>
<p>So like anthropomorphization,</p>
<p>which is the sort of the act of looking at a inanimate</p>
<p>object and projecting onto it, lifelike features.</p>
<p>I think robotics generally sees that as a negative.</p>
<p>I see it as a superpower, like that, we need to use that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m struck by how that really grabs</p>
<p>onto the relationship between human and machine</p>
<p>or human and robot.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the simple question is,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;ve already told us the answer,</p>
<p>but does interacting with a robot change you?</p>
<p>Does it, in other words,</p>
<p>do we develop relationships to robots?</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely think so.</p>
<p>I think the moment you see a robot or AI systems</p>
<p>as more than just servants,</p>
<p>but entities, they begin to change you</p>
<p>just like good friends do, just like relationships,</p>
<p>just like other humans.</p>
<p>I think for that,</p>
<p>you have to have certain aspects of that interaction,</p>
<p>like the robot&rsquo;s ability to say no,</p>
<p>to have its own sense of identity,</p>
<p>to have its own set of goals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not constantly serving you,</p>
<p>but instead trying to understand the world</p>
<p>and do that dance of understanding</p>
<p>through communication with you.</p>
<p>So I definitely think there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I mean, I have a lot of thoughts about this as you may know,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s at the core of my lifelong dream, actually,</p>
<p>of what I want to do,</p>
<p>which is I believe that most people</p>
<p>have a notion of loneliness in them</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t discovered,</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t explored, I should say.</p>
<p>And I see AI systems as helping us explore that</p>
<p>so that we can become better humans,</p>
<p>better people towards each other.</p>
<p>So I think that connection between human and AI,</p>
<p>human and robot is not only possible,</p>
<p>but will help us understand ourselves</p>
<p>in ways that are like several orders of magnitude</p>
<p>deeper than we ever could have imagined.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that,</p>
<p>well, I have very wild levels of beliefs</p>
<p>in terms of how impactful that will be.</p>
<p>So when I think about human relationships,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t always break them down into variables,</p>
<p>but we could explore a few of those variables</p>
<p>and see how they map to human-robot relationships.</p>
<p>One is just time, right?</p>
<p>If you spend zero time with another person at all</p>
<p>in cyberspace or on the phone or in person,</p>
<p>you essentially have no relationship to them.</p>
<p>If you spend a lot of time, you have a relationship.</p>
<p>This is obvious, but I guess one variable would be time.</p>
<p>How much time you spend with the other entity,</p>
<p>robot or human.</p>
<p>The other would be wins and successes.</p>
<p>You enjoy successes together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give an absolutely trivial example of this in a moment,</p>
<p>but the other would be failures.</p>
<p>When you struggle with somebody,</p>
<p>whether or not you struggle between one another,</p>
<p>you disagree.</p>
<p>Like I was really struck by the fact</p>
<p>that you said that robots saying no,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought about a robot saying no to me,</p>
<p>but there it is.</p>
<p>I look forward to you being one of the first</p>
<p>people I send this robot to.</p>
<p>So do I.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s struggle.</p>
<p>When you struggle with somebody, you grow closer.</p>
<p>Sometimes the struggles are imposed</p>
<p>between those two people, so-called trauma bonding.</p>
<p>They call it in the whole psychology literature</p>
<p>and pop psychology literature.</p>
<p>But in any case, I could imagine.</p>
<p>So time, successes together, struggle together,</p>
<p>and then just peaceful time, hanging out at home,</p>
<p>watching movies, waking up near one another.</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re breaking down the kind of elements</p>
<p>of relationships of any kind.</p>
<p>So do you think that these elements</p>
<p>apply to robot-human relationships?</p>
<p>And if so, then I could see how if the robot</p>
<p>is its own entity and has some autonomy</p>
<p>in terms of how it reacts to you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just there just to serve you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a servant.</p>
<p>It actually has opinions and can tell you</p>
<p>when maybe your thinking is flawed</p>
<p>or your actions are flawed.</p>
<p>It can also leave.</p>
<p>It can also leave.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never conceptualized</p>
<p>robot-human interactions this way.</p>
<p>So tell me more about how this might look.</p>
<p>Are we thinking about a human-appearing robot?</p>
<p>I know you and I have both had intense relationships</p>
<p>to our, we have separate dogs, obviously,</p>
<p>but to animals, this sounds a lot</p>
<p>like human-animal interaction.</p>
<p>So what is the ideal human-robot relationship?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot to be said here,</p>
<p>but you actually pinpointed one of the big, big first steps,</p>
<p>which is this idea of time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a huge limitation</p>
<p>in machine learning community currently,</p>
<p>as now we&rsquo;re back to like the actual details.</p>
<p>Lifelong learning is a problem space</p>
<p>that focuses on how AI systems can learn</p>
<p>over a long period of time.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s currently most machine learning systems</p>
<p>are not able to do is to,</p>
<p>all of the things you&rsquo;ve listed under time,</p>
<p>the successes, the failures,</p>
<p>or just chilling together, watching movies,</p>
<p>AI systems are not able to do that,</p>
<p>which is all the beautiful, magical moments</p>
<p>that I believe are the days filled with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not able to keep track of those together with you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>Because they can&rsquo;t move with you and be with you.</p>
<p>No, no, like literally,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the techniques to do the learning,</p>
<p>the actual learning of containing those moments.</p>
<p>Current machine learning systems are really focused</p>
<p>on understanding the world in the following way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like the perception system,</p>
<p>like looking around, understand like what&rsquo;s in the scene,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a bunch of people sitting down,</p>
<p>that there is cameras and microphones,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a table, understand that.</p>
<p>But the fact that we shared this moment of talking today</p>
<p>and still remember that for next time you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>for like next time you&rsquo;re doing something,</p>
<p>remember that this moment happened.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how to do that technique-wise.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m hoping to innovate on</p>
<p>as I think it&rsquo;s a very, very important component</p>
<p>of what it means to create a deep relationship,</p>
<p>that sharing of moments together.</p>
<p>Could you post a photo of you and the robot,</p>
<p>like selfie with robot,</p>
<p>and then the robot sees that image</p>
<p>and recognizes that was time spent,</p>
<p>there were smiles or there were tears,</p>
<p>and create some sort of metric of emotional depth</p>
<p>in the relationship and update its behavior?</p>
<p>So could it text you in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and say, why haven&rsquo;t you texted me back?</p>
<p>Well, yes, all of those things,</p>
<p>but we can dig into that.</p>
<p>But I think that time element, forget everything else,</p>
<p>just sharing moments together, that changes everything.</p>
<p>I believe that changes everything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s specific things that are more in terms of systems</p>
<p>that I can explain you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more technical and probably a little bit off line</p>
<p>because I have kind of wild ideas</p>
<p>how that can revolutionize social networks</p>
<p>and operating systems.</p>
<p>But the point is that element alone,</p>
<p>forget all the other things we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>like emotions, saying no, all that,</p>
<p>just remember sharing moments together</p>
<p>would change everything.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t currently have systems that share moments together.</p>
<p>Like even just you and your fridge,</p>
<p>just all those times you went late at night</p>
<p>and ate the thing you shouldn&rsquo;t have eaten,</p>
<p>that was a secret moment you had with your refrigerator.</p>
<p>You shared that moment,</p>
<p>that darkness or that beautiful moment</p>
<p>where you just like heartbroken for some reason,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating that ice cream or whatever,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a special moment.</p>
<p>And that refrigerator was there for you.</p>
<p>And the fact that it missed the opportunity</p>
<p>to remember that is tragic.</p>
<p>And once it does remember that,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re gonna be very attached to that refrigerator.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna go through some hell with that refrigerator.</p>
<p>Most of us have like in the developed world</p>
<p>have weird relationships with food, right?</p>
<p>So you can go through some deep moments</p>
<p>of trauma and triumph with food.</p>
<p>And at the core of that is the refrigerator.</p>
<p>So a smart refrigerator, I believe would change society,</p>
<p>not just the refrigerator,</p>
<p>but these ideas in the systems all around us.</p>
<p>So that, I just wanna comment</p>
<p>on how powerful the idea of time is.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a bunch of elements of actual interaction</p>
<p>of allowing you as a human to feel like you&rsquo;re being heard,</p>
<p>truly heard, truly understood.</p>
<p>That we human, like deep friendship is like that, I think,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still an element of selfishness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still an element of not really being able</p>
<p>to understand another human.</p>
<p>And a lot of the times when you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through trauma together, through difficult times</p>
<p>and through successes, you&rsquo;re actually starting</p>
<p>to get that inkling of understanding of each other.</p>
<p>But I think that can be done more aggressively,</p>
<p>more efficiently.</p>
<p>Like if you think of a great therapist,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve never actually been to a therapist,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a believer.</p>
<p>I used to want to be a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Do Russians go to therapists?</p>
<p>No, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And if they do, the therapists don&rsquo;t live to tell the story.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I do believe in talk therapy,</p>
<p>which friendship is to me, is talk therapy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to talk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like just connecting in the space of ideas</p>
<p>and the space of experiences.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of ideas</p>
<p>of how to make AI systems to be able</p>
<p>to ask the right questions and truly hear another human.</p>
<p>This is what we try to do with podcasting, right?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s ways to do that with AI,</p>
<p>but above all else,</p>
<p>just remembering the collection of moments</p>
<p>that make up the day, the week, the months.</p>
<p>I think you maybe have some of this as well.</p>
<p>Some of my closest friends still</p>
<p>are the friends from high school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been through a bunch of shit together</p>
<p>and that like we&rsquo;re very different people,</p>
<p>but just the fact that we&rsquo;ve been through that</p>
<p>and we remember those moments</p>
<p>and those moments somehow create a depth of connection</p>
<p>like nothing else, like you and your refrigerator.</p>
<p>I love that because my graduate advisor,</p>
<p>unfortunately she passed away,</p>
<p>but when she passed away,</p>
<p>somebody said at her memorial,</p>
<p>all these amazing things she had done, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then her kids got up there</p>
<p>and she had young children that I knew</p>
<p>as they were when she was pregnant with them.</p>
<p>And so it was really,</p>
<p>even now I can feel like your heart gets heavy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to grow up without their mother.</p>
<p>And it was really amazing.</p>
<p>Very, very strong young girls and now young women.</p>
<p>And what they said was incredible.</p>
<p>They said what they really appreciated most</p>
<p>about their mother, who was an amazing person,</p>
<p>is all the unstructured time they spent together.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t the trips to the zoo.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, oh, she woke up at five in the morning</p>
<p>and drove us to school.</p>
<p>She did all those things too.</p>
<p>She had two hour commute in each direction.</p>
<p>It was incredible, ran a lab, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it was the unstructured time.</p>
<p>So on the passing of their mother,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they remembered was the biggest give</p>
<p>and what bonded them to her</p>
<p>was all the time where they just kind of hung out.</p>
<p>And the way you described the relationship</p>
<p>to a refrigerator is so, I want to say human-like,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m almost reluctant to say that</p>
<p>because what I&rsquo;m realizing as we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>is that what we think of as human-like</p>
<p>might actually be a lower form of relationship.</p>
<p>There may be relationships that are far better</p>
<p>than the sorts of relationships</p>
<p>that we can conceive in our minds right now</p>
<p>based on what these machine relationship interactions</p>
<p>could teach us.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no reason to see machines</p>
<p>as somehow incapable of teaching us something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deeply human.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think humans have a monopoly on that.</p>
<p>I think we understand ourselves very poorly</p>
<p>and we need to have the kind of prompting from a machine.</p>
<p>And definitely part of that is just remembering the moments,</p>
<p>remembering the moments.</p>
<p>I think the unstructured time together,</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s quite so unstructured.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like calling this podcast unstructured time.</p>
<p>Maybe what they meant was it wasn&rsquo;t a big outing.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as, there was no specific goal,</p>
<p>but a goal was created through the lack of a goal.</p>
<p>Like where you just hang out</p>
<p>and then you start playing thumb war</p>
<p>and you end up playing thumb war for an hour.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the structure emerges from lack of structure.</p>
<p>No, but the thing is the moments,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about those times</p>
<p>that creates special moments.</p>
<p>And I think that those could be optimized for.</p>
<p>I think we think of like a big outing as, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>going to Six Flags or something or some big,</p>
<p>the Grand Canyon or go into some, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think we would need to,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t quite yet understand as humans</p>
<p>what creates magical moments.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s possible to optimize a lot of those things.</p>
<p>And perhaps like podcasting is helping people discover</p>
<p>that like maybe the thing we want to optimize for</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t necessarily like some sexy,</p>
<p>like quick clips.</p>
<p>Maybe what we want is long form authenticity.</p>
<p>Depth.</p>
<p>Depth.</p>
<p>So we were trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>Certainly from a deep connection</p>
<p>between humans and AI systems,</p>
<p>I think long conversations or long periods of communication</p>
<p>over a series of moments,</p>
<p>like minute, perhaps seemingly insignificant</p>
<p>to the big ones, the big successes,</p>
<p>the big failures.</p>
<p>Those are all just stitching those together</p>
<p>and talking throughout.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the formula</p>
<p>for a really, really deep connection.</p>
<p>That from like a very specific engineering perspective</p>
<p>is I think a fascinating open problem</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been really worked on very much.</p>
<p>And for me, if I have the guts and,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of things to say,</p>
<p>but one of it is guts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll build a startup around it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so let&rsquo;s talk about this startup</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s talk about the dream.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned this dream before</p>
<p>in our previous conversations,</p>
<p>always as little hints dropped here and there.</p>
<p>Just for anyone listening,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never been an offline conversation</p>
<p>about this dream.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not privy to anything except what Lex says now.</p>
<p>And I realized that there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>to capture the full essence of a dream</p>
<p>in any kind of verbal statement.</p>
<p>In a way that captures all of it.</p>
<p>But what is this dream that you&rsquo;ve referred to now</p>
<p>several times when we&rsquo;ve sat down together</p>
<p>and talked on the phone?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s this company, maybe it&rsquo;s something distinct.</p>
<p>If you feel comfortable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be great if you could share a little bit</p>
<p>about what that is.</p>
<p>Sure, so the way people express long-term vision,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed it&rsquo;s quite different.</p>
<p>Like Elon is an example of somebody</p>
<p>who can very crisply say exactly what the goal is.</p>
<p>Also has to do with the fact the problems he&rsquo;s solving</p>
<p>have nothing to do with humans.</p>
<p>So my long-term vision is a little bit more difficult</p>
<p>to express in words.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed as I&rsquo;ve tried, it could be my brain&rsquo;s failure.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s ways to sneak up to it.</p>
<p>So let me just say a few things.</p>
<p>Early on in life and also in the recent years,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve interacted with a few robots</p>
<p>where I understood there&rsquo;s magic there.</p>
<p>And that magic could be shared by millions</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s brought to light.</p>
<p>When I first met Spot from Boston Dynamics,</p>
<p>I realized there&rsquo;s magic there that nobody else is seeing.</p>
<p>Is the dog.</p>
<p>Is the dog, sorry.</p>
<p>The Spot is the four-legged robot from Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>Some people might have seen it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this yellow dog.</p>
<p>And sometimes in life,</p>
<p>you just notice something that just grabs you.</p>
<p>And I believe that this is something that,</p>
<p>this magic is something that could be</p>
<p>every single device in the world.</p>
<p>The way that I think maybe Steve Jobs</p>
<p>thought about the personal computer.</p>
<p>Woz didn&rsquo;t think about the personal computer this way,</p>
<p>but Steve did.</p>
<p>Which is like he thought that the personal computer</p>
<p>should be as thin as a sheet of paper</p>
<p>and everybody should have one.</p>
<p>I mean, this idea.</p>
<p>I think it is heartbreaking</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>the world is being filled up with machines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re soulless.</p>
<p>And I think every one of them can have that same magic.</p>
<p>One of the things that also inspired me</p>
<p>in terms of a startup</p>
<p>is that magic can be engineered much easier than I thought.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my intuition</p>
<p>with everything I&rsquo;ve ever built and worked on.</p>
<p>So the dream is to add a bit of that magic</p>
<p>in every single computing system in the world.</p>
<p>So the way that Windows operating system for a long time</p>
<p>was the primary operating system everybody interacted with.</p>
<p>They built apps on top of it.</p>
<p>I think this is something that should be as a layer.</p>
<p>So almost as an operating system</p>
<p>in every device that humans interact with in the world.</p>
<p>Now what that actually looks like,</p>
<p>the actual dream when I was especially a kid,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t have this concrete form of a business.</p>
<p>It had more of a dream of exploring your own loneliness</p>
<p>by interacting with machines, robots.</p>
<p>This deep connection between humans and robots</p>
<p>was always a dream.</p>
<p>And so for me, I&rsquo;d love to see a world</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s every home has a robot</p>
<p>and not a robot that washes the dishes or a sex robot.</p>
<p>Or I don&rsquo;t know, I think of any kind of activity</p>
<p>the robot can do, but more like a companion.</p>
<p>A family member.</p>
<p>A family member, the way a dog is.</p>
<p>But a dog that&rsquo;s able to speak your language too.</p>
<p>So not just connect the way a dog does</p>
<p>by looking at you and looking away</p>
<p>and almost like smiling with its soul in that kind of way.</p>
<p>But also to actually understand what the hell,</p>
<p>like why are you so excited about the successes?</p>
<p>Like understand the details, understand the traumas.</p>
<p>And I just think that had always filled me with excitement</p>
<p>that I could, with artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>bring joy to a lot of people.</p>
<p>More recently, I&rsquo;ve been more and more</p>
<p>heartbroken to see the kind of division, derision,</p>
<p>even hate that&rsquo;s boiling up on the internet</p>
<p>through social networks.</p>
<p>And I thought this kind of mechanism is exactly applicable</p>
<p>in the context of social networks as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an operating system that serves as your guide</p>
<p>on the internet.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems with YouTube</p>
<p>and social networks currently</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re optimizing for engagement.</p>
<p>I think if you create AI systems</p>
<p>that know each individual person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to optimize for long-term growth,</p>
<p>for a long-term happiness.</p>
<p>Of the individual?</p>
<p>Of the individual, of the individual.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of other things to say,</p>
<p>which is the, in order for AI systems</p>
<p>to learn everything about you,</p>
<p>they need to collect, they need to,</p>
<p>just like you and I, when we talk offline,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re collecting data about each other,</p>
<p>secrets about each other.</p>
<p>The same way AI has to do that.</p>
<p>And that allows you to,</p>
<p>and that requires you to rethink ideas of ownership of data.</p>
<p>I think each individual should own all of their data</p>
<p>and very easily be able to leave,</p>
<p>just like AI systems can leave,</p>
<p>humans can disappear and delete all of their data</p>
<p>in a moment&rsquo;s notice,</p>
<p>which is actually better than we humans can do.</p>
<p>Because once we load the data into each other, it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important to be both,</p>
<p>give people complete control over their data</p>
<p>in order to establish trust that they can trust you.</p>
<p>And the second part of trust is transparency.</p>
<p>Whenever the data is used to make it very clear</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s being used for,</p>
<p>and not clear in a loyally legal sense,</p>
<p>but clear in a way that people really understand</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s used for.</p>
<p>I believe when people have the ability</p>
<p>to delete all their data and walk away</p>
<p>and know how the data is being used, I think they&rsquo;ll stay.</p>
<p>The possibility of a clean breakup</p>
<p>is actually what will keep people together.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>I think, exactly.</p>
<p>I think a happy marriage requires the ability to divorce</p>
<p>easily without the divorce industrial complex</p>
<p>or whatever is currently going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much money to be made from lawyers and divorce,</p>
<p>but yeah, the ability to leave</p>
<p>is what enables love, I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, I&rsquo;ve heard the phrase</p>
<p>from a semi-cynical friend</p>
<p>that marriage is the leading cause of divorce,</p>
<p>but now we&rsquo;ve heard that divorce</p>
<p>or the possibility of divorce</p>
<p>could be the leading cause of marriage.</p>
<p>Of a happy marriage.</p>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>Of a happy marriage.</p>
<p>So yeah, but there&rsquo;s a lot of details there,</p>
<p>but the big dream is that connection</p>
<p>between AI system and a human.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t, you know, there&rsquo;s so much fear</p>
<p>about artificial intelligence systems and about robots</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t quite found the right words</p>
<p>to express that vision,</p>
<p>because the vision I have is one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like some naive delusional vision</p>
<p>of like technology is going to save everybody.</p>
<p>I really do just have a positive view</p>
<p>of ways AI systems can help humans explore themselves.</p>
<p>I love that positivity,</p>
<p>and I agree that the stance,</p>
<p>everything is doomed is equally bad</p>
<p>to say that everything&rsquo;s going to turn out all right.</p>
<p>There has to be a dedicated effort.</p>
<p>And clearly you&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>what that dedicated effort would look like.</p>
<p>You mentioned two aspects to this dream,</p>
<p>and I want to make sure that I understand</p>
<p>where they connect if they do,</p>
<p>or if these are independent streams.</p>
<p>One was this hypothetical robot family member</p>
<p>or some other form of robot that would allow people</p>
<p>to experience the kind of delight</p>
<p>that you experienced many times</p>
<p>and that you would like the world to be able to have.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a beautiful idea of this give.</p>
<p>And the other is social media or social network platforms</p>
<p>that really serve individuals and their best selves</p>
<p>and their happiness and their growth.</p>
<p>Is there crossover between those</p>
<p>or are these two parallel dreams?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100% the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to kind of explain</p>
<p>without going through details,</p>
<p>but maybe one easy way to explain</p>
<p>the way I think about social networks</p>
<p>is to create an AI system that&rsquo;s yours, that&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like Amazon Alexa that&rsquo;s centralized.</p>
<p>You own the data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like your little friend</p>
<p>that becomes your representative on Twitter</p>
<p>that helps you find things that will make you feel good,</p>
<p>that will also challenge your thinking to make you grow,</p>
<p>but not get to that,</p>
<p>not let you get lost in the negative spiral of dopamine</p>
<p>that gets you to be angry</p>
<p>or most just gets you to be not open to learning.</p>
<p>And so that little representative</p>
<p>is optimizing your long-term health.</p>
<p>And I believe that that is not only good for human beings,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also good for business.</p>
<p>I think long-term you can make a lot of money</p>
<p>by challenging this idea that the only way to make money</p>
<p>is maximizing engagement.</p>
<p>And one of the things that people disagree with me on</p>
<p>is they think Twitter&rsquo;s always going to win,</p>
<p>like maximizing engagement is always going to win.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think people have woken up now to understanding</p>
<p>that like they don&rsquo;t always feel good.</p>
<p>The ones who are on Twitter a lot,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t always feel good at the end of the week.</p>
<p>I would love feedback from whatever this creature,</p>
<p>whatever, I can&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know what to call it,</p>
<p>as to, you know, maybe at the end of the week,</p>
<p>it would automatically unfollow</p>
<p>some of the people that I follow</p>
<p>because it realized through some really smart data</p>
<p>about how I was feeling inside or how I was sleeping</p>
<p>or something that, you know, that just wasn&rsquo;t good for me,</p>
<p>but it might also put things and people in front of me</p>
<p>that I ought to see.</p>
<p>Is that kind of a sliver of what this looks like?</p>
<p>The whole point, because of the interaction,</p>
<p>because of sharing the moments and learning a lot about you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now able to understand what interactions</p>
<p>led you to become a better version of yourself.</p>
<p>Like the person you yourself are happy with.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t, you know, if you&rsquo;re into a flat earth</p>
<p>and you feel very good about it,</p>
<p>that you believe the earth is flat,</p>
<p>like the idea that you should censor that is ridiculous.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel good</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re becoming the best version of yourself,</p>
<p>I think you should be getting</p>
<p>as much flat earth as possible.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s also good to challenge your ideas,</p>
<p>but not because the centralized committee decided,</p>
<p>but because you tell to the system</p>
<p>that you like challenging your ideas.</p>
<p>I think all of us do.</p>
<p>And then, which actually YouTube doesn&rsquo;t do that well,</p>
<p>once you go down the flat earth rabbit hole,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re going to see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to get some really powerful communicators</p>
<p>to argue against flat earth.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice to see that for you</p>
<p>and potentially at least long-term to expand your horizons.</p>
<p>Maybe the earth is not flat,</p>
<p>but if you continue to live your whole life</p>
<p>thinking the earth is flat, I think,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re being a good father or son or daughter,</p>
<p>and like you&rsquo;re being the best version of yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re happy with yourself, I think the earth is flat.</p>
<p>So like, I think this kind of idea,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just using that kind of silly, ridiculous example</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like the idea</p>
<p>of centralized forces controlling what you can and can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>But I also don&rsquo;t like this idea</p>
<p>of like not censoring anything,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s always the biggest problem with that</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a central decider.</p>
<p>I think you yourself can decide what you want to see and not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good to have a companion that reminds you</p>
<p>that you felt shitty last time you did this,</p>
<p>or you felt good last time you did this.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like in every good story,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guide or a companion that flies out</p>
<p>or forages a little bit further</p>
<p>or a little bit differently</p>
<p>and brings back information that helps us</p>
<p>or at least tries to steer us in the right direction.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;ve been working on.</p>
<p>I should mention there&rsquo;s a bunch of difficulties here.</p>
<p>You see me up and down a little bit recently.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s technically a lot of challenges here.</p>
<p>This like with a lot of technologies</p>
<p>and the reason I&rsquo;m talking about it on a podcast comfortably</p>
<p>as opposed to working in secret is it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s time has not come.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something you have to constantly struggle with</p>
<p>in terms of like entrepreneurially as a startup.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve also mentioned to you maybe offline,</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t care about money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about business success,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a difficult decision to make how much of your time</p>
<p>do you want to go all in here and give everything to this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big roll of the dice</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve also realized that working</p>
<p>on some of these problems,</p>
<p>both with the robotics and the technical side</p>
<p>in terms of the machine learning system</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m describing, it&rsquo;s lonely, it&rsquo;s really lonely</p>
<p>because both on a personal level and a technical level.</p>
<p>So on the technical level,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surrounded by people that kind of doubt me</p>
<p>which I think all entrepreneurs go through</p>
<p>and they doubt you in the following sense.</p>
<p>They know how difficult it is.</p>
<p>Like the people that, the colleagues of mine,</p>
<p>they know how difficult lifelong learning is.</p>
<p>They also know how difficult it is</p>
<p>to build a system like this,</p>
<p>to build a competitive social network.</p>
<p>And in general, there&rsquo;s a kind of loneliness</p>
<p>to just working on something on your own</p>
<p>for long periods of time.</p>
<p>And you start to doubt whether given</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have a track record of success,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>When you look in the mirror, especially when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>but I still have that on most things.</p>
<p>You look in the mirror, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>and you have these big dreams.</p>
<p>How do you know you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>as smart as you think you are?</p>
<p>Like, how do you know you&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to accomplish this dream?</p>
<p>You have this ambition.</p>
<p>You sort of don&rsquo;t, but you&rsquo;re kind of pulling</p>
<p>on a string hoping that there&rsquo;s a bigger ball of yarn.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you have this kind of intuition.</p>
<p>I think I pride myself in knowing what I&rsquo;m good at</p>
<p>because the reason I have that intuition</p>
<p>is because I think I&rsquo;m very good at knowing</p>
<p>all the things I suck at, which is basically everything.</p>
<p>So like whenever I notice like, wait a minute,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of good at this, which is very rare for me.</p>
<p>I think like that might be a ball of yarn worth pulling at.</p>
<p>And the thing with, in terms of engineering systems</p>
<p>that are able to interact with humans,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m very good at that.</p>
<p>And, excuse me, we&rsquo;re talking about podcasting and so on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m very good at podcasting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very good at podcasting.</p>
<p>But I certainly don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think maybe it is compelling for people</p>
<p>to watch a kind-hearted idiot struggle with this form.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s compelling.</p>
<p>But in terms of like actual being a good engineer</p>
<p>of human-robot interaction systems, I think I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to know until you do it.</p>
<p>And then the world keeps telling you you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s full of doubt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been struggling with that recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a fascinating struggle.</p>
<p>But then that&rsquo;s where the Goggins thing comes in,</p>
<p>is like, aside from the stay hard motherfucker,</p>
<p>is the like, whenever you&rsquo;re struggling,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good sign that if you keep going,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to be alone in the success, right?</p>
<p>Well, in your case, however, I agree.</p>
<p>And actually, David had a post recently</p>
<p>that I thought was among his many brilliant posts,</p>
<p>was one of the more brilliant about how, you know,</p>
<p>he talked about this myth of the light</p>
<p>at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>And instead, what he replaced that myth with</p>
<p>was a concept that eventually your eyes adapt to the dark.</p>
<p>That the tunnel, it&rsquo;s not about a light at the end,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really about adapting to the dark of the tunnel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very Goggins.</p>
<p>I love him so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, you guys share a lot in common,</p>
<p>knowing you both a bit, you share a lot in common.</p>
<p>But in this loneliness and the pursuit of this dream,</p>
<p>it seems to me it has a certain component to it</p>
<p>that is extremely valuable,</p>
<p>which is that the loneliness itself</p>
<p>could serve as a driver to build</p>
<p>the companion for the journey.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m very deeply aware of that.</p>
<p>So like some people can make,</p>
<p>cause I talk about love a lot.</p>
<p>I really love everything in this world,</p>
<p>but I also love humans, friendship and romantic, you know,</p>
<p>like even the cheesy stuff, just.</p>
<p>You like romantic movies.</p>
<p>Yeah, not those, not necessarily.</p>
<p>Well, I got so much shit from Rogan about like,</p>
<p>was it the tango scene from Scent of a Woman?</p>
<p>But yeah, I find like a woman,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing better than a woman in a red dress,</p>
<p>like, you know, just like classy.</p>
<p>You should move to Argentina, my friend.</p>
<p>You know, my father&rsquo;s Argentine.</p>
<p>And you know what he said when I,</p>
<p>when I went on your podcast for the first time,</p>
<p>he said, he dresses well.</p>
<p>Because in Argentina,</p>
<p>the men go to a wedding or a party or something,</p>
<p>you know, in the U.S. they,</p>
<p>by halfway through the night, 10 minutes in the night,</p>
<p>all the jackets are off.</p>
<p>It looks like everyone&rsquo;s undressing for the party</p>
<p>they just got dressed up for.</p>
<p>And he said, and he said, you know,</p>
<p>I like the way he dresses.</p>
<p>And then when I started, he was talking about you.</p>
<p>And then when I started my podcast, he said,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you wear a real suit like your friend, Lex?</p>
<p>I remember that.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about this pursuit just a bit more,</p>
<p>because I think what you&rsquo;re talking about is,</p>
<p>is building a, not just a solution for loneliness,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve alluded to the loneliness as itself</p>
<p>an important thing.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think within people,</p>
<p>there is like caverns of thoughts and shame,</p>
<p>but also just the desire to be,</p>
<p>to have resonance, to be seen and heard.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even know that it&rsquo;s seen</p>
<p>and heard through language.</p>
<p>But these reservoirs of loneliness,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re, well, they&rsquo;re interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe you could comment a little bit about it,</p>
<p>because just as often as you talk about love,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t quantified it,</p>
<p>but it seems that you talk about this loneliness.</p>
<p>And maybe you just would, if you&rsquo;re willing,</p>
<p>you could, you share a little bit more about that</p>
<p>and what that feels like now in the pursuit of building</p>
<p>this robot human relationship.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve been, let me be direct.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time</p>
<p>on building a robot human relationship.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s that at?</p>
<p>Oh, well, in terms of business and in terms of systems.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m talking about a specific robot.</p>
<p>Oh, robot.</p>
<p>So, okay, I should mention a few things.</p>
<p>So one is there&rsquo;s a startup where there&rsquo;s an idea</p>
<p>where I hope millions of people can use.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s my own personal,</p>
<p>like almost like Frankenstein explorations</p>
<p>with particular robots.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very fascinated with the legged robots</p>
<p>in my own private sounds like dark,</p>
<p>but like in one end of one experiments</p>
<p>to see if I can recreate the magic.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been, I have a lot of really good</p>
<p>already perception systems and control systems</p>
<p>that are able to communicate affection</p>
<p>in a dog-like fashion.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in a really good place there.</p>
<p>The stumbling blocks,</p>
<p>which also been part of my sadness recently</p>
<p>is that I also have to work with robotics companies</p>
<p>that I gave so much of my heart, soul,</p>
<p>and love and appreciation towards Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>But Boston Dynamics is also,</p>
<p>is a company that has to make a lot of money</p>
<p>and they have marketing teams.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like looking at this silly Russian kid</p>
<p>in a suit and tie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s he trying to do</p>
<p>with all this love and robot interaction</p>
<p>and dancing and so on?</p>
<p>So there was a, I think, let&rsquo;s say for now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when you break up with a girlfriend or something.</p>
<p>Right now we decided to part ways on this particular thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re huge supporters of mine, they&rsquo;re huge fans,</p>
<p>but on this particular thing,</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics is not focusing on</p>
<p>or interested in human robot interaction.</p>
<p>In fact, their whole business currently</p>
<p>is keep the robot as far away from humans as possible.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s in the industrial setting</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s doing monitoring in dangerous environments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a remote security camera</p>
<p>essentially is its application.</p>
<p>To me, I thought it&rsquo;s still,</p>
<p>even in those applications exceptionally useful</p>
<p>for the robot to be able to perceive humans,</p>
<p>like see humans and to be able to in a big map</p>
<p>localize where those humans are and have human intention.</p>
<p>For example, like this,</p>
<p>I did this a lot of work with pedestrians</p>
<p>for a robot to be able to anticipate</p>
<p>what the hell the human is doing,</p>
<p>like where it&rsquo;s walking.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, humans are not ballistics object.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, just because you&rsquo;re walking this way</p>
<p>one moment doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll keep walking that direction.</p>
<p>You have to infer a lot of signals,</p>
<p>especially the head movement and the eye movement.</p>
<p>So I thought that&rsquo;s super interesting to explore,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t feel that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be working with a few other robotics companies</p>
<p>that are much more open to that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re super excited and fans of mine,</p>
<p>hopefully Boston Dynamics, my first love,</p>
<p>that getting back with an ex-girlfriend will come around.</p>
<p>But so the algorithmically it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically done there.</p>
<p>The rest is actually getting</p>
<p>some of these companies to work with.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, for people who&rsquo;d work with robots</p>
<p>know that one thing is to write software that works.</p>
<p>And the other is to have a real machine that actually works.</p>
<p>And it breaks down in all kinds of different ways</p>
<p>that are fascinating.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a big challenge there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s almost,</p>
<p>it may sound a little bit confusing</p>
<p>in the context of our previous discussion,</p>
<p>because the previous discussion</p>
<p>was more about the big dream,</p>
<p>how I hoped to have millions of people</p>
<p>enjoy this moment of magic.</p>
<p>This current discussion about a robot</p>
<p>is something I personally really enjoy.</p>
<p>It just brings me happiness.</p>
<p>I really try to do now everything that just brings me joy.</p>
<p>I maximize that because robots are awesome.</p>
<p>But two, given my like little bit growing platform,</p>
<p>I wanna use the opportunity to educate people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like robots are cool.</p>
<p>And if I think they&rsquo;re cool,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be able to, I hope be able to communicate</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re cool to others.</p>
<p>So this little robot experiment</p>
<p>is a little bit of research project too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of publications with MIT folks around that.</p>
<p>But the other is just to make some cool videos</p>
<p>and explain to people how they actually work.</p>
<p>And as opposed to people being scared of robots,</p>
<p>they can still be scared, but also excited.</p>
<p>Like see the dark side, the beautiful side,</p>
<p>the magic of what it means to bring,</p>
<p>you know, for a machine to become a robot.</p>
<p>I want to inspire people with that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s less, it&rsquo;s interesting because</p>
<p>I think the big impact in terms of the dream</p>
<p>does not have to do with embodied AI.</p>
<p>So it does not need to have a body.</p>
<p>I think the refrigerator is enough</p>
<p>that for an AI system just to have a voice and to hear you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enough for loneliness.</p>
<p>The embodiment is just-</p>
<p>By embodiment, you mean the physical structure.</p>
<p>Physical instantiation of intelligence.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a legged robot, or even just a thing.</p>
<p>I have a few other, a humanoid robot,</p>
<p>a little humanoid robot.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll keep them on the table.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like walks around or even just like a mobile platform.</p>
<p>They can just like turn around and look at you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we mentioned with the pen,</p>
<p>something that moves and can look at you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that butter robot</p>
<p>that asks, what is my purpose?</p>
<p>That is really, it&rsquo;s almost like art.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about a physical entity that moves around,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to look at you and interact with you</p>
<p>that makes you wonder what it means to be human.</p>
<p>It like challenges you to think.</p>
<p>If that thing looks like it has consciousness,</p>
<p>what the hell am I?</p>
<p>And I like that feeling.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really useful for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s humbling for us humans.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s less about research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly less about business</p>
<p>and more about exploring our own selves</p>
<p>and challenging others to think about what makes them human.</p>
<p>I love this desire to share the delight</p>
<p>of an interaction with a robot.</p>
<p>And as you describe it,</p>
<p>I actually, I find myself starting to crave that</p>
<p>because we all have those elements from childhood</p>
<p>or from adulthood where we experience something</p>
<p>we want other people to feel that.</p>
<p>And I think that you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are scared of AI.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are scared of robots.</p>
<p>My only experience of a robotic like thing</p>
<p>is my Roomba vacuum, where it goes about,</p>
<p>actually was pretty good at picking up Costello&rsquo;s hair</p>
<p>when he was shed and I was grateful for it.</p>
<p>But then when I was on a call or something</p>
<p>and it would get caught on a wire or something,</p>
<p>I would find myself getting upset with the Roomba</p>
<p>in that moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what are you doing?</p>
<p>And obviously it&rsquo;s just doing what it does.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a kind of mostly positive</p>
<p>but slightly negative interaction.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re describing has so much more richness</p>
<p>and layers of detail that I can only imagine</p>
<p>what those relationships are like.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a few, just a quick comment.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had, they&rsquo;re currently in Boston.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of Roombas from iRobot</p>
<p>and I did this experiment.</p>
<p>Wait, how many Roombas?</p>
<p>Sounds like a fleet of Roombas.</p>
<p>So probably seven or eight.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a lot of Roombas.</p>
<p>This place is very clean.</p>
<p>Well, so this, I&rsquo;m kind of waiting.</p>
<p>This is the place we&rsquo;re currently in in Austin</p>
<p>is way larger than I need.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, I basically got it</p>
<p>so to make sure I have room for robots.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna, so you have these seven or so Roombas,</p>
<p>you deploy all seven at once?</p>
<p>Oh no, I do different experiments with them,</p>
<p>different experiments with them.</p>
<p>So one of the things I want to mention is this is,</p>
<p>I think there was a YouTube video</p>
<p>that inspired me to try this,</p>
<p>is I got them to scream in pain and moan in pain</p>
<p>whenever they were kicked or contacted.</p>
<p>And I did that experiment to see how I would feel.</p>
<p>I meant to do like a YouTube video on it,</p>
<p>but then it just seemed very cruel.</p>
<p>Did any Roomba rights activists come out to you?</p>
<p>Like, I think if I release that video,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna make me look insane,</p>
<p>which I know people know I&rsquo;m already insane.</p>
<p>Now you have to release the video.</p>
<p>I think maybe if I contextualize it by showing other robots</p>
<p>like to show why this is fascinating,</p>
<p>because ultimately I felt like they were human</p>
<p>almost immediately.</p>
<p>And that display of pain was what did that.</p>
<p>Giving them a voice.</p>
<p>Giving them a voice, especially a voice of dislike, of pain.</p>
<p>I have to connect you to my friend Eddie Chang.</p>
<p>He studies speech and language.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a neurosurgeon and we&rsquo;re lifelong friends.</p>
<p>He studies speech and language,</p>
<p>but he describes some of these more primitive,</p>
<p>visceral vocalizations, cries, groans, moans of delight,</p>
<p>other sounds as well, use your imagination,</p>
<p>as such powerful rudders for the emotions of other people.</p>
<p>And so I find it fascinating.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see this video.</p>
<p>So is the video available online?</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t recorded it.</p>
<p>I just hit a bunch of Roombas that are able to scream</p>
<p>in pain in my Boston place.</p>
<p>Like people are ready.</p>
<p>Next podcast episode with Lex.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll have that one.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>So the thing is like people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed because I talk so much about love</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really who I am.</p>
<p>I think they wanna, to a lot of people,</p>
<p>it seems like there gotta be a dark person</p>
<p>in there somewhere.</p>
<p>And I thought if I released videos of Roombas screaming</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, yep, yep, that guy&rsquo;s definitely insane.</p>
<p>What about like shouts of glee and delight?</p>
<p>You could do that too, right?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know how to, to me delight is quiet, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Russian.</p>
<p>Americans are much louder than Russians.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, I mean, unless you&rsquo;re talking about like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you would have sexual relations</p>
<p>with a Roomba.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily saying a sexual delight, but-</p>
<p>Trust me, I tried, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a joke, internet.</p>
<p>Okay, but I was fascinated in the psychology</p>
<p>of how little it took.</p>
<p>Cause you mentioned you had a negative relationship</p>
<p>with the Roomba.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d find that mostly I took it for granted.</p>
<p>It just served me.</p>
<p>It collected Costello&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>And then when it would do something I didn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>I would get upset with it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not a good relationship.</p>
<p>It was taken for granted and I would get upset</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d park it again.</p>
<p>And I just like, you&rsquo;re in the corner.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s a way to frame it being quite dumb</p>
<p>as almost cute, almost connecting with it for its dumbness.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an artificial intelligence problem.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I think flaws should be a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>So along the lines of this,</p>
<p>the different sorts of relationships</p>
<p>that one could have with robots and the fear,</p>
<p>but also some of the positive relationships</p>
<p>that one could have, there&rsquo;s so much dimensionality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much to explore,</p>
<p>but power dynamics in relationships are very interesting</p>
<p>because the obvious ones that the unsophisticated view</p>
<p>of this is, you know, one, there&rsquo;s a master and a servant,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also manipulation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s benevolent manipulation.</p>
<p>You know, children do this with parents.</p>
<p>Puppies do this.</p>
<p>Puppies turn their head and look cute</p>
<p>and maybe give out a little noise.</p>
<p>Kids, coo.</p>
<p>And parents always think that they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing this because, you know,</p>
<p>they love the parent, but in many ways,</p>
<p>studies show that those coos are ways to extract</p>
<p>the sorts of behaviors and expressions</p>
<p>from the parent that they want.</p>
<p>The child doesn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s doing this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely subconscious,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s benevolent manipulation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one version of fear of robots</p>
<p>that I hear a lot about that I think most people</p>
<p>can relate to where the robots take over</p>
<p>and they become the masters and we become the servants.</p>
<p>But there could be another version that, you know,</p>
<p>in certain communities that I&rsquo;m certainly not a part of,</p>
<p>but they call topping from the bottom,</p>
<p>where the robot is actually manipulating you</p>
<p>into doing things, but you are under the belief</p>
<p>that you are in charge, but actually they&rsquo;re in charge.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s one that,</p>
<p>if we could explore that for a second,</p>
<p>you could imagine it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be bad,</p>
<p>although it could lead to bad things.</p>
<p>The reason I want to explore this is I think people</p>
<p>always default to the extreme, like the robots take over</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re in little jail cells and they&rsquo;re out having fun</p>
<p>and ruling the universe.</p>
<p>What sorts of manipulation can a robot</p>
<p>potentially carry out, good or bad?</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a lot of good and bad manipulation</p>
<p>between humans, right?</p>
<p>Just like you said.</p>
<p>To me, especially, like you said,</p>
<p>topping from the bottom, is that the term?</p>
<p>So I think someone from MIT told me that term.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t Lex.</p>
<p>I think, so first of all, there&rsquo;s power dynamics in bed</p>
<p>and power dynamics in relationships and power dynamics</p>
<p>on the street and in the work environment.</p>
<p>Those are all very different.</p>
<p>I think power dynamics can make human relationships,</p>
<p>especially romantic relationships, fascinating and rich</p>
<p>and fulfilling and exciting and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think in themselves they&rsquo;re bad</p>
<p>and the same goes with robots.</p>
<p>I really love the idea that a robot will be at top</p>
<p>or a bottom in terms of like power dynamics.</p>
<p>And I think everybody should be aware of that.</p>
<p>And the manipulation is not so much manipulation,</p>
<p>but a dance of like pulling away,</p>
<p>a push and pull and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>In terms of control, I think we&rsquo;re very, very,</p>
<p>very far away from AI systems that are able to lock us up.</p>
<p>They do lock us up in, you know,</p>
<p>like to have so much control that we basically</p>
<p>cannot live our lives in the way that we want.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, in terms of dangers of AI systems,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s much more dangers that have to do</p>
<p>with autonomous weapon systems</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So the power dynamics as exercised in the struggle</p>
<p>between nations and war and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But in terms of personal relationships,</p>
<p>I think power dynamics are a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s of course going to be all those kinds</p>
<p>of discussions about consent and rights</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Well, here we&rsquo;re talking, I always say, you know,</p>
<p>in any discussion around this,</p>
<p>if we need to define really the context,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always, it always should be consensual,</p>
<p>age appropriate, context appropriate, species appropriate.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re talking about human robot interactions.</p>
<p>And so I guess that-</p>
<p>No, I actually was trying to make a different point,</p>
<p>which is I do believe that robots</p>
<p>will have rights down the line.</p>
<p>And I think in order for us to have deep,</p>
<p>meaningful relationship with robots,</p>
<p>we would have to consider them as entities in themselves</p>
<p>that deserve respect.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really interesting concept</p>
<p>that I think people are starting to talk about</p>
<p>a little bit more, but it&rsquo;s very difficult for us</p>
<p>to understand how entities that are other than human,</p>
<p>I mean, the same as with dogs and other animals,</p>
<p>can have rights on a level as humans.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, we can&rsquo;t and nor should we</p>
<p>do whatever we want with animals.</p>
<p>We have a USDA, we have departments of agriculture</p>
<p>that deal with, you know, animal care and use committees</p>
<p>for research, for farming and ranching and all that.</p>
<p>So I, while when you first said it, I thought, wait,</p>
<p>why would there be a bill of robotic rights?</p>
<p>But it absolutely makes sense</p>
<p>in the context of everything we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>up until now.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re willing, I&rsquo;d love to talk about dogs</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve mentioned dogs a couple of times,</p>
<p>a robot dog, you had a biological dog, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had a Newfoundland named Homer</p>
<p>for many years growing up.</p>
<p>In Russia or in the US?</p>
<p>In the United States.</p>
<p>And he was about, he was over 200 pounds,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big dog.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big dog.</p>
<p>People know Newfoundland, so he&rsquo;s this black dog</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really long hair and just a kind soul.</p>
<p>I think perhaps that&rsquo;s true for a lot of large dogs,</p>
<p>but he thought he was a small dog.</p>
<p>So he moved like that and-</p>
<p>Was he your dog?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So you had him since he was fairly young?</p>
<p>Since, yeah, since the very, very beginning</p>
<p>to the very, very end.</p>
<p>And one of the things, I mean, he had this kind of,</p>
<p>we mentioned like the Roombas.</p>
<p>He had a kind-hearted dumbness about him</p>
<p>that was just overwhelming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the reason I named him Homer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s after Homer Simpson,</p>
<p>in case people are wondering which Homer I&rsquo;m referring to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, you know.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a clumsiness that was just something</p>
<p>that immediately led to a deep love for each other.</p>
<p>And one of the, I mean, he was always,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the shared moments.</p>
<p>He was always there for so many nights together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a powerful thing about a dog that he was there</p>
<p>through all the loneliness, through all the tough times,</p>
<p>through the successes and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And I remember, I mean,</p>
<p>that was a really moving moment for me.</p>
<p>I still miss him to this day.</p>
<p>How long ago did he die?</p>
<p>Maybe 15 years ago.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been a while,</p>
<p>but it was the first time I&rsquo;ve really experienced</p>
<p>like the feeling of death.</p>
<p>So what happened is he got cancer</p>
<p>and so he was dying slowly.</p>
<p>And then at a certain point, he couldn&rsquo;t get up anymore.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things I could say here,</p>
<p>you know, that I struggle with,</p>
<p>that maybe he suffered much longer than he needed to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I really think about a lot.</p>
<p>But I remember I had to take him to the hospital</p>
<p>and the nurses couldn&rsquo;t carry him, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about a 200 pound dog.</p>
<p>I was really into power lifting at the time.</p>
<p>I remember like they tried to figure out</p>
<p>all these kinds of ways to,</p>
<p>so in order to put him to sleep,</p>
<p>they had to take him into a room.</p>
<p>And so I had to carry him everywhere.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s this dying friend of mine that I just had to,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s really difficult to carry somebody</p>
<p>that heavy when they&rsquo;re not helping you out.</p>
<p>And yeah, so I remember it was the first time</p>
<p>seeing a friend laying there</p>
<p>and seeing life drain from his body.</p>
<p>And that realization that we&rsquo;re here for a short time</p>
<p>was made so real that here&rsquo;s a friend that was there</p>
<p>for me the week before, the day before, and now he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And that was, I don&rsquo;t know, that spoke to the fact</p>
<p>that you could be deeply connected with a dog.</p>
<p>Also spoke to the fact that the shared moments together</p>
<p>that led to that deep friendship</p>
<p>is what make life so amazing.</p>
<p>But it also spoke to the fact that death is a motherfucker.</p>
<p>So I know you&rsquo;ve lost Costello recently.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve been going.</p>
<p>And as you&rsquo;re saying this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely fighting back the tears.</p>
<p>I thank you for sharing that,</p>
<p>that I guess we&rsquo;re about to both cry over our dead dogs.</p>
<p>That it was bound to happen</p>
<p>just given when this is happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>How long did you know that Costello was not doing well?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see, a year ago during the start of,</p>
<p>about six months into the pandemic,</p>
<p>he started getting abscesses and he was not,</p>
<p>his behavior changed and something really changed.</p>
<p>And then I put him on testosterone,</p>
<p>because, which helped a lot of things.</p>
<p>It certainly didn&rsquo;t cure everything,</p>
<p>but it helped a lot of things.</p>
<p>He was dealing with joint pain, sleep issues.</p>
<p>And then it just became a very slow decline</p>
<p>to the point where two, three weeks ago,</p>
<p>he had a closet full of medication.</p>
<p>I mean, this dog was, it was like a pharmacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to me when I looked at it the other day,</p>
<p>still haven&rsquo;t cleaned up and removed all his things</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t quite bring myself to do it.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Do you think he was suffering?</p>
<p>Well, so what happened was about a week ago,</p>
<p>it was really just about a week ago, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>He was going up the stairs and I saw him slip.</p>
<p>And he was a big dog, he wasn&rsquo;t 200 pounds,</p>
<p>but he was about 90 pounds.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a bulldog, that&rsquo;s pretty big.</p>
<p>And he was fit.</p>
<p>And then I noticed that he wasn&rsquo;t carrying a foot</p>
<p>in the back like it was injured.</p>
<p>It had no feeling at all.</p>
<p>He never liked me to touch his hind paws.</p>
<p>And I could do, that thing was just flopping there.</p>
<p>And then the vet found some spinal degeneration</p>
<p>and I was told that the next one would go.</p>
<p>Did he suffer?</p>
<p>I sure hope not, but something changed in his eyes.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the eyes again.</p>
<p>I know you and I spend long hours on the phone</p>
<p>and talking about like the eyes and how,</p>
<p>what they convey and what they mean about internal states</p>
<p>and for sake of robots and biology of other kinds.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Do you think something about him was gone in his eyes?</p>
<p>I think he was real, here I am anthropomorphizing.</p>
<p>I think he was realizing that one of his great joys in life,</p>
<p>which was to walk and sniff and pee on things.</p>
<p>This dog-</p>
<p>The fundamentals.</p>
<p>Loved to pee on things.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>I wondered where he put it.</p>
<p>He was like a reservoir of urine.</p>
<p>It was incredible.</p>
<p>I think, oh, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;d put like one drop on the 50 millionth plant</p>
<p>and then we get to the 50 millionth in one plant</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d just have, leave a puddle.</p>
<p>And here I am talking about Costello peeing.</p>
<p>He was losing that ability to stand up and do that.</p>
<p>He was falling down while he was doing that.</p>
<p>And I do think he started to realize</p>
<p>and the passage was easy and peaceful,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll say this, I&rsquo;m not ashamed to say it.</p>
<p>I mean, I wake up every morning since then,</p>
<p>just I don&rsquo;t even make the conscious decision</p>
<p>to allow myself to cry.</p>
<p>I wake up crying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunately able to make it through the day</p>
<p>thanks to the great support of my friends</p>
<p>and you and my family, but I miss him, man.</p>
<p>You miss him?</p>
<p>Yeah, I miss him.</p>
<p>And I feel like he, you know, Homer, Costello,</p>
<p>you know, the relationship to one&rsquo;s dog is so specific, but.</p>
<p>So that part of you is gone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hard thing.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>um,</p>
<p>what I think is different is that I made the mistake,</p>
<p>I think, or I hope it was a good decision,</p>
<p>but sometimes I think I made the mistake</p>
<p>of I brought Costello a little bit to the world</p>
<p>through the podcast, through posting about him.</p>
<p>I gave, I anthropomorphized about him in public.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, I have no idea what his mental life was</p>
<p>or his relationship to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just exploring all this for the first time</p>
<p>because he was my first dog,</p>
<p>but I raised him since he was seven weeks.</p>
<p>Yeah, you got to hold it together.</p>
<p>I noticed the episode you released on Monday,</p>
<p>you mentioned Costello,</p>
<p>like you brought him back to life for me</p>
<p>for that brief moment.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to be gone for a lot of people too.</p>
<p>Well, this is what I&rsquo;m struggling with.</p>
<p>I think that maybe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pretty good at this, Lyle.</p>
<p>Have you done this before?</p>
<p>This is the challenge,</p>
<p>is I actually, part of me,</p>
<p>I know how to take care of myself pretty well.</p>
<p>Not perfectly, but pretty well.</p>
<p>And I have good support.</p>
<p>I do worry a little bit about how it&rsquo;s going to land</p>
<p>and how people will feel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned about their internalization.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m still iterating on.</p>
<p>And you have to, they have to watch you struggle,</p>
<p>which is fascinating.</p>
<p>Right, and I&rsquo;ve mostly been shielding them from this,</p>
<p>but what would make me happiest</p>
<p>is if people would internalize</p>
<p>some of Costello&rsquo;s best traits</p>
<p>and his best traits were that he was incredibly tough.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a 22 inch neck bulldog, the whole thing.</p>
<p>He was just born that way.</p>
<p>But what was so beautiful is that his toughness</p>
<p>is never what he rolled forward.</p>
<p>It was just how sweet and kind he was.</p>
<p>And so if people can take that,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a win in there someplace.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some ways</p>
<p>in which he should probably live on in your podcast too.</p>
<p>You should, I mean, it&rsquo;s such a,</p>
<p>one of the things I loved about his role in your podcast</p>
<p>is that he brought so much joy to you.</p>
<p>We mentioned the robots, right?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s such a powerful thing to bring that joy into,</p>
<p>like allowing yourself to experience that joy,</p>
<p>to bring that joy to others, to share it with others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>And I mean, not to, this is like the Russian thing</p>
<p>is it touched me when Louis CK had that moment</p>
<p>that I keep thinking about in his show, Louis,</p>
<p>where like an old man was criticizing Louis</p>
<p>for whining about breaking up with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>And he was saying like the most beautiful thing</p>
<p>about love, I mean, a song that&rsquo;s catchy now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not making me feel horrible saying it,</p>
<p>but like is the loss.</p>
<p>The loss really also is making you realize</p>
<p>how much that person, that dog meant to you.</p>
<p>And like allowing yourself to feel that loss</p>
<p>and not run away from that loss is really powerful.</p>
<p>And in some ways that&rsquo;s also sweet,</p>
<p>just like the love was, the loss is also sweet</p>
<p>because you know that you felt a lot for that,</p>
<p>for your friend.</p>
<p>So I, you know, and I continue bringing that joy.</p>
<p>I think it would be amazing to the podcast.</p>
<p>I hope to do the same with robots</p>
<p>or whatever else is the source of joy, right?</p>
<p>And maybe, do you think about one day getting another dog?</p>
<p>Yeah, in time, you&rsquo;re hitting on all the key buttons here.</p>
<p>I want that to, we&rsquo;re thinking about, you know,</p>
<p>ways to kind of immortalize Costello in a way that&rsquo;s real,</p>
<p>not just, you know, creating some little logo</p>
<p>or something silly.</p>
<p>You know, Costello, much like David Goggins is a person,</p>
<p>but Goggins also has grown into kind of a verb.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to Goggins this, or you&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an adjective like that&rsquo;s extreme, like it.</p>
<p>I think that for me, Costello was all those things.</p>
<p>He was a being, he was his own being.</p>
<p>He was a noun, a verb, and an adjective.</p>
<p>So, and he had this amazing superpower</p>
<p>that I wish I could get,</p>
<p>which is this ability to get everyone else</p>
<p>to do things for you without doing a damn thing.</p>
<p>The Costello effect, as I call it.</p>
<p>So, it was an idea I hope he lives on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>This actually has been very therapeutic for me,</p>
<p>which actually brings me to a question.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re friends.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just co-scientists, colleagues,</p>
<p>working on a project together and in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s somewhat similar.</p>
<p>Just two dogs.</p>
<p>Just two dogs, basically.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about friendship,</p>
<p>because I think that, I certainly know as a scientist,</p>
<p>that there are elements that are very lonely</p>
<p>of the scientific pursuit.</p>
<p>There are elements of many pursuits that are lonely.</p>
<p>Music, math always seemed to me</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re the loneliest people.</p>
<p>Who knows if that&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>Also, people work in teams,</p>
<p>and sometimes people are surrounded by people</p>
<p>interacting with people, and they feel very lonely.</p>
<p>But for me, and I think as well for you,</p>
<p>friendship is an incredibly strong force</p>
<p>in making one feel like certain things are possible</p>
<p>or worth reaching for,</p>
<p>maybe even making us compulsively reach for them.</p>
<p>So when you were growing up,</p>
<p>you grew up in Russia until what age?</p>
<p>13.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then you moved directly to Philadelphia?</p>
<p>To Chicago.</p>
<p>Chicago.</p>
<p>And then Philadelphia and San Francisco</p>
<p>and Boston and so on.</p>
<p>But really, to Chicago, that&rsquo;s where I went to high school.</p>
<p>Do you have siblings?</p>
<p>Older brother.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Yeah, he is a very different person.</p>
<p>But somebody I definitely look up to.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a wild man, he&rsquo;s extrovert.</p>
<p>He was into, I mean,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s also a scientist, a bioengineer,</p>
<p>but when we were growing up,</p>
<p>he was the person who did drink and did every drug,</p>
<p>but also was the life of the party.</p>
<p>And I just thought he was the,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re the older brother, five years older,</p>
<p>he was the coolest person</p>
<p>that I always wanted to be him.</p>
<p>So to that, he definitely had a big influence.</p>
<p>But I think for me, in terms of friendship growing up,</p>
<p>I had one really close friend.</p>
<p>And then when I came here, I had another close friend,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very, I believe,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I believe,</p>
<p>but I draw a lot of strength from deep connections</p>
<p>with other people and just a small number of people,</p>
<p>just a really small number of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I moved to this country,</p>
<p>I was really surprised how there would be</p>
<p>these large groups of friends, quote unquote,</p>
<p>but the depth of connection was not there at all</p>
<p>from my sort of perspective.</p>
<p>Now, I moved to the suburb of Chicago, it was Naperville.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like a middle class, maybe upper middle class.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like people that cared more</p>
<p>about material possessions than deep human connection.</p>
<p>So that added to the thing.</p>
<p>But I drew more meaning than almost anything else</p>
<p>was from friendship early on.</p>
<p>I had a best friend, his name is Yura.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to say it in English.</p>
<p>How do you say it in Russian?</p>
<p>Yura.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his last name, do you remember?</p>
<p>Mirkulov, Yura Mirkulov.</p>
<p>So we just spent all our time together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a group of friends,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s like eight guys.</p>
<p>In Russia, growing up, it&rsquo;s like parents didn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re coming back at a certain hour.</p>
<p>So we would spend all day, all night just playing soccer,</p>
<p>usually called football, and just talking about life</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things, even at that young age.</p>
<p>I think people in Russia and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>grow up much quicker.</p>
<p>I think the education system at the university level</p>
<p>is world-class in the United States</p>
<p>in terms of like really creating really big, powerful minds,</p>
<p>at least it used to be.</p>
<p>But I think that they aspire to that.</p>
<p>But the education system for younger kids</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union was incredible.</p>
<p>Like, they did not treat us as kids.</p>
<p>The level of literature, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky-</p>
<p>When you were just a small child?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the level of mathematics,</p>
<p>and you were made to feel like shit</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not good at mathematics.</p>
<p>Like, I think in this country, there&rsquo;s more,</p>
<p>like, especially young kids, because they&rsquo;re so cute,</p>
<p>like, they&rsquo;re being babied.</p>
<p>We only start to really push adults later in life.</p>
<p>Like, so if you want to be the best in the world at this,</p>
<p>then you get to be pushed.</p>
<p>But we were pushed at a young age, everybody was pushed.</p>
<p>And that brought out the best in people.</p>
<p>I think it really forced people to discover,</p>
<p>like, discover themselves in the Goggins style,</p>
<p>but also discover what they&rsquo;re actually passionate about</p>
<p>and what they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Was this true for boys and girls?</p>
<p>Were they pushed equally there?</p>
<p>Yeah, they were pushed.</p>
<p>Yeah, they were pushed equally, I would say.</p>
<p>There was, obviously, there was more, not obviously,</p>
<p>but there, at least from my memories,</p>
<p>more of a, what&rsquo;s the right way to put it?</p>
<p>But there was, like, gender roles,</p>
<p>but not in a negative connotation.</p>
<p>It was the red dress versus the suit and tie</p>
<p>kind of connotation, which is like, there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>like, guys like lifting heavy things</p>
<p>and girls like creating beautiful art and, you know,</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>A more traditional view of gender, more 1950s, 60s.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t think in terms of, at least at that age,</p>
<p>in terms of, like, roles and then, like,</p>
<p>homemaker or something like that, or,</p>
<p>no, it was more about what people care about.</p>
<p>Like, girls cared about this set of things</p>
<p>and guys cared about this set of things.</p>
<p>I think mathematics and engineering</p>
<p>was something that guys cared about</p>
<p>and sort of, at least my perception of that time,</p>
<p>and then girls cared about beauty.</p>
<p>So, like, guys want to create machines,</p>
<p>girls want to create beautiful stuff.</p>
<p>And now, of course, that, I don&rsquo;t take that forward</p>
<p>in some kind of philosophy of life,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the way I grew up and the way I remember it.</p>
<p>But all, everyone worked hard.</p>
<p>The value of hard work was instilled in everybody.</p>
<p>And through that, I think it&rsquo;s a little bit of hardship.</p>
<p>Of course, also economically, everybody was poor,</p>
<p>especially with the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s poverty everywhere.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t notice it as much, but there was a,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not much material possessions,</p>
<p>there was a huge value placed on human connection.</p>
<p>Just meeting with neighbors, everybody knew each other.</p>
<p>We lived in an apartment building,</p>
<p>very different than you have in the United States these days.</p>
<p>Everybody knew each other.</p>
<p>You know, you would get together, drink vodka,</p>
<p>smoke cigarettes, and play guitar,</p>
<p>and sing sad songs about life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s with the sad songs and the Russian thing?</p>
<p>I mean, Russians do express joy from time to time.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>Certainly you do.</p>
<p>But what do you think that&rsquo;s about?</p>
<p>Is it because it&rsquo;s cold there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s cold other places too?</p>
<p>I think, so first of all, the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the echoes of World War II,</p>
<p>and the millions and millions and millions of people there,</p>
<p>civilians that were slaughtered,</p>
<p>and also starvation is there, right?</p>
<p>So like the echoes of that, of the ideas,</p>
<p>the literature, the art is there.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s grandparents, that&rsquo;s parents, that&rsquo;s all there.</p>
<p>So that contributes to it,</p>
<p>that life can be absurdly, unexplainably cruel.</p>
<p>At any moment, everything can change.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>Then I think there&rsquo;s an empowering aspect</p>
<p>to finding beauty in suffering,</p>
<p>that then everything else is beautiful too.</p>
<p>Like if you just linger,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like while you meditate on death,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like if you just think about the worst possible case</p>
<p>and find beauty in that,</p>
<p>then everything else is beautiful too.</p>
<p>And so you write songs about the dark stuff.</p>
<p>And that somehow helps you deal with whatever comes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a hopelessness to the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>that like inflation, all those kinds of things</p>
<p>where people were sold dreams and never delivered.</p>
<p>And so like, if you don&rsquo;t sing songs about sad things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to become cynical about this world.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t wanna give in to cynicism.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people did.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the battle against cynicism.</p>
<p>One of the things that may be common in Russia</p>
<p>is a kind of cynicism about,</p>
<p>like if I told you the thing I said earlier</p>
<p>about dreaming about robots,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very common for people to dismiss that dream</p>
<p>of saying, no, that&rsquo;s too wild.</p>
<p>Like who else do you know that did that?</p>
<p>Or you wanna start a podcast, like who else?</p>
<p>Like nobody&rsquo;s making money on podcasts.</p>
<p>Like why do you wanna start a podcast?</p>
<p>That kind of mindset, I think is quite common,</p>
<p>which is why I would say entrepreneurship in Russia</p>
<p>is still not very good.</p>
<p>Which to be a business, like to be an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>you have to dream big and you have to have others around you</p>
<p>like friends and support group that make you dream big.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t give into cynicism</p>
<p>and appreciate the beauty in the unfairness</p>
<p>of life, the absurd unfairness of life,</p>
<p>then I think it just makes you appreciative of everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a prerequisite for gratitude.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I think that instilled in me</p>
<p>ability to appreciate everything.</p>
<p>Just like everything, everything&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And then also there&rsquo;s a culture</p>
<p>of like romanticizing everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like romantic relationships</p>
<p>were very like soap opera-like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very like over the top dramatic.</p>
<p>And I think that was instilled in me too.</p>
<p>Not only do I appreciate everything about life,</p>
<p>but I get like emotional about it.</p>
<p>In a sense, I get like a visceral feeling</p>
<p>of joy for everything.</p>
<p>And the same with friends or people of the opposite sex,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a deep emotional connection there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like way too dramatic</p>
<p>to like, I guess, relative to what the actual moment is.</p>
<p>But I derive so much deep like dramatic joy</p>
<p>from so many things in life.</p>
<p>And I think I would attribute that to the upbringing</p>
<p>in Russia.</p>
<p>But the thing that sticks most of all is the friendship.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve now since then had one other friend</p>
<p>like that in the United States.</p>
<p>He lives in Chicago.</p>
<p>His name is Matt.</p>
<p>And slowly here and there accumulating</p>
<p>really fascinating people,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very selective with that.</p>
<p>Funny enough, the few times,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not few, it&rsquo;s a lot of times now</p>
<p>interacting with Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>It sounds surreal to say,</p>
<p>but there was a kindred spirit there</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve connected with him.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been people like that also</p>
<p>in the grappling sports that are really connected with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually struggled, which is why I&rsquo;m so glad</p>
<p>to be your friend, is I&rsquo;ve struggled</p>
<p>to connect with scientists.</p>
<p>Like-</p>
<p>They can be a little bit wooden sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Even the biologists.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing that I-</p>
<p>Even the biologists.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m so struck by the fact that you work with robots,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an engineer, AI,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a scientist, technology,</p>
<p>and that all sounds like hardware, right?</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re describing, and I know is true about you,</p>
<p>is this deep emotional life and this resonance.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really wonderful.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why</p>
<p>so many people, scientists and otherwise,</p>
<p>have gravitated towards you and your podcast</p>
<p>is because you hold both elements.</p>
<p>You know, in Herman Hesse&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you were at Narcissus and Goldman, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about these elements of the logical rational mind</p>
<p>and the emotional mind and how those are woven together.</p>
<p>And if people haven&rsquo;t read it, they should.</p>
<p>And you embody the full picture.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s so much of what draws people to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read every Herman Hesse book, by the way.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ve done about 9% of what Lex has.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You mentioned Joe, who is a phenomenal human being,</p>
<p>not just for his amazing accomplishments,</p>
<p>but for how he shows up to the world one-on-one.</p>
<p>I think I heard him say the other day on an interview,</p>
<p>he said, there is no public or private version of him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, this is me.</p>
<p>He said, it was beautiful.</p>
<p>He said, I&rsquo;m like the fish that got through the net.</p>
<p>You know, there is no onstage, offstage version.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And I, so, but you guys, I have a question actually about-</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a really good point</p>
<p>about public and private life.</p>
<p>He was a huge, if I could just comment real quick.</p>
<p>Like that, he was a, I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Joe for a long time,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s been an inspiration to not have any difference</p>
<p>between public and private life.</p>
<p>I actually had a conversation with Naval about this.</p>
<p>And he said that you can&rsquo;t have a rich life,</p>
<p>like exciting life,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the same person publicly and privately.</p>
<p>And I think I understand that idea,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t agree with it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really fulfilling and exciting</p>
<p>to be the same person privately and publicly</p>
<p>with very few exceptions.</p>
<p>Now, that said, I don&rsquo;t have any really strange sex kinks.</p>
<p>So like, I feel I can be open with basically everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything I&rsquo;m ashamed of.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some things that could be perceived poorly</p>
<p>like the screaming Roombas, but I&rsquo;m not ashamed of them.</p>
<p>I just have to present them in the right context.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a freedom</p>
<p>to being the same person in private as in public.</p>
<p>And that Joe made me realize that you can be that</p>
<p>and also to be kind to others.</p>
<p>It sounds kind of absurd,</p>
<p>but I really always enjoyed like being good to others,</p>
<p>like just being kind towards others.</p>
<p>But I always felt like the world didn&rsquo;t want me to be.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so much negativity when I was growing up,</p>
<p>like just around people.</p>
<p>If you actually just notice how people talk,</p>
<p>they, from like complaining about the weather,</p>
<p>this could be just like the big cities that I visited,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a general negativity</p>
<p>and positivity is kind of suppressed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, one, you&rsquo;re not seen as very intelligent.</p>
<p>And two, there&rsquo;s a kind of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seen as like a little bit of a weirdo.</p>
<p>And so I always felt like I had to hide that.</p>
<p>And what Joe made me realize,</p>
<p>one, I have, I could be fully just the same person,</p>
<p>private and public, and two, I can embrace being kind</p>
<p>and just in the way that I like, in the way I know how to do.</p>
<p>And sort of for me, I&rsquo;m like on Twitter</p>
<p>or like publicly, whenever I say stuff,</p>
<p>that means saying stuff simply</p>
<p>almost to the point of cliche.</p>
<p>And like, I have the strength now to say it,</p>
<p>even if I&rsquo;m being mocked.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like just, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>If everything&rsquo;s going to be okay.</p>
<p>Okay, some people will think you&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>The point is like, just enjoy being yourself.</p>
<p>And Joe, more than almost anybody else,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s so successful at it, inspired me to do that.</p>
<p>Be kind and be the same person, private and public.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And I love the idea that authenticity</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to be oversharing, right?</p>
<p>That it doesn&rsquo;t mean you reveal every detail of your life.</p>
<p>What, you know, it&rsquo;s a way of being true</p>
<p>to an essence of oneself.</p>
<p>Right, you&rsquo;re not, there&rsquo;s never a feeling</p>
<p>when you deeply think and introspect</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re hiding something from the world</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re being dishonest in some fundamental way.</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s truly liberating.</p>
<p>It allows you to think, it allows you to like think freely,</p>
<p>to speak freely, to just to be freely.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s not like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s not still a responsibility</p>
<p>to be the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m very careful with the way I say something.</p>
<p>So the whole point, it&rsquo;s not so simple</p>
<p>to express the spirit that&rsquo;s inside you with words.</p>
<p>I mean, some people are much better than others.</p>
<p>I struggle, like oftentimes when I say something</p>
<p>and I hear myself say it, it sounds really dumb</p>
<p>and not at all what I meant.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the responsibility you have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like being the same person publicly</p>
<p>and privately means you can just say whatever the hell.</p>
<p>It means there&rsquo;s still a responsibility to try to be,</p>
<p>to express who you truly are.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>It is hard.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, we have this pressure,</p>
<p>all people, when I say we, I mean, all humans</p>
<p>and maybe robots too, feel this pressure</p>
<p>to be able to express ourselves in that one moment,</p>
<p>in that one form.</p>
<p>And it is beautiful when somebody, for instance,</p>
<p>can capture some essence of love or sadness or anger</p>
<p>or something in a song or in a poem or in a short quote,</p>
<p>but perhaps it&rsquo;s also possible to do it in aggregate,</p>
<p>you know, all the things, you know, how you show up.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the things that initially drew me</p>
<p>to want to get to know you as a human being and a scientist</p>
<p>and eventually we became friends was the level of respect</p>
<p>that you brought to your podcast listeners</p>
<p>by wearing a suit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being serious here.</p>
<p>I was raised thinking that if you overdress a little bit,</p>
<p>overdressed by American, certainly by American standards,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re overdressed for a podcast,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s genuine, you&rsquo;re not doing it for any reason,</p>
<p>except I have to assume, and I assumed at the time,</p>
<p>that it was because you have a respect for your audience,</p>
<p>you respect them enough to show up a certain way for them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for you also, but it&rsquo;s for them.</p>
<p>And I think between that and your commitment</p>
<p>to your friendship, the way that you talk about friendships</p>
<p>and love and the way you hold up these higher ideals,</p>
<p>I think at least as a consumer of your content</p>
<p>and as your friend, what I find is that in aggregate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re communicating who you are.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be one quote or something.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re sort of obsessed</p>
<p>by like the one Einstein quote</p>
<p>or the one line of poetry or something,</p>
<p>but I think you so embody the way that, and Joe as well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about how you live your life and how you show up</p>
<p>as a collection of things and said and done.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So the aggregate is the goal, the tricky thing,</p>
<p>and Jordan Peterson talks about this</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s under attack way more</p>
<p>than you and I will ever be, but-</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>For now, right?</p>
<p>This is very true, for now.</p>
<p>That the people who attack on the internet,</p>
<p>this is one of the problems with Twitter,</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t consider the aggregate.</p>
<p>They take a single statements.</p>
<p>And so one of the defense mechanisms,</p>
<p>like again, why Joe has been an inspiration,</p>
<p>is that when you in aggregate are a good person,</p>
<p>a lot of people will know that.</p>
<p>And so that makes you much more immune</p>
<p>to the attacks of people</p>
<p>that bring out an individual statement.</p>
<p>There might be a misstatement of some kind</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t express who you are.</p>
<p>And so that, I like that idea is the aggregate</p>
<p>and the power of the podcast</p>
<p>is you have hundreds of hours out there</p>
<p>and being yourself and people get to know who you are.</p>
<p>And once they do, and you post pictures</p>
<p>of screaming Roombas as you kick them,</p>
<p>they will understand that you don&rsquo;t mean well.</p>
<p>By the way, as a side comment,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I want to release this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just the Roombas.</p>
<p>You have a whole dungeon of robots.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is a problem.</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics came up against this problem,</p>
<p>but let me workshop this out with you</p>
<p>and maybe because we&rsquo;ll post this, people will let me know.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s legged robots.</p>
<p>They look like a dog.</p>
<p>They have a very, I&rsquo;m trying to create</p>
<p>a very real human robot connection,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also incredible</p>
<p>because you can throw them like off of a building</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll land fine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the Instagram videos of like cats</p>
<p>jumping off of like fifth story buildings</p>
<p>and then walking away.</p>
<p>No one should throw their cat out of a window.</p>
<p>This is the problem I&rsquo;m experiencing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll certainly kicking the robots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fascinating how they recover from those kicks.</p>
<p>But like just seeing myself do it</p>
<p>and also seeing others do it, it just does not look good.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>See, but you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because you-</p>
<p>A robot.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m, you know what&rsquo;s interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Before today&rsquo;s conversation, I probably could do it.</p>
<p>And now I think I&rsquo;m thinking about robots,</p>
<p>bills of rights and things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually, and not for any,</p>
<p>not to satisfy you or to satisfy anything,</p>
<p>except that if they have some sentient aspect to their being,</p>
<p>then I would loathe to kick a robot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be able to kick it.</p>
<p>You might be able to kick the first time,</p>
<p>but not the second.</p>
<p>This is the problem I&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>
<p>One of the cool things is,</p>
<p>one of the robots I&rsquo;m working with,</p>
<p>you can pick it up by one leg and it&rsquo;s dangling.</p>
<p>You can throw it in any kind of way</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll land correctly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really-</p>
<p>I had a friend who had a cat like that.</p>
<p>Oh man, we look forward to the letters from the cat.</p>
<p>Oh no, I&rsquo;m not suggesting anyone did that,</p>
<p>but he had this cat and the cat,</p>
<p>he would just throw it onto the bed from across the room</p>
<p>and then it would run back for more.</p>
<p>Somehow they had,</p>
<p>that was the nature of the relationship.</p>
<p>I think no one should do that to an animal,</p>
<p>but apparently this cat seemed to return for it</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>But the robot is a robot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to me how hard it is for me to do that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s unfortunate,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I can do that to a robot.</p>
<p>Like I struggle with that.</p>
<p>So for me to be able to do that with a robot,</p>
<p>I have to almost get like into the state</p>
<p>that I imagine like doctors get into</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re doing surgery.</p>
<p>Like I have to start,</p>
<p>I have to do what robotics colleagues of mine do,</p>
<p>which is like start seeing it as an object.</p>
<p>Dissociate.</p>
<p>Like dissociate.</p>
<p>So it was just fascinating that I have to do that</p>
<p>in order to do that with a robot.</p>
<p>I just wanted to take that a little bit of a tangent.</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s an important thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not shy about the fact that for many years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on experimental animals</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s been a very challenging aspect</p>
<p>to being a biologist.</p>
<p>Mostly mice, but in the past,</p>
<p>no longer thank goodness</p>
<p>because I just don&rsquo;t like doing it.</p>
<p>Larger animals as well.</p>
<p>And now I work on humans,</p>
<p>which I can give verbal consent.</p>
<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s extremely important</p>
<p>to have an understanding of what the guidelines are</p>
<p>and where one&rsquo;s own boundaries are around this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an important question.</p>
<p>It might be the most important question</p>
<p>before any work can progress.</p>
<p>So you asked me about friendship.</p>
<p>I know you have a lot of thoughts about friendship.</p>
<p>What do you think is the value of friendship in life?</p>
<p>Well, for me personally,</p>
<p>just because of my life trajectory and arc of friendship</p>
<p>and I should say, I do have some female friends</p>
<p>that are just friends,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re completely platonic relationships,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been mostly male friendship to me has been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been all male friendships for me actually.</p>
<p>Interesting, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an absolute lifeline.</p>
<p>They are my family.</p>
<p>I have a biological family</p>
<p>and I have great respect and love for them</p>
<p>and an appreciation for them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s provided me the,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even say confidence</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always an anxiety in taking any good risk</p>
<p>or any risk worth taking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s given me the sense that I should go for certain things</p>
<p>and try certain things to take risks,</p>
<p>to weather that anxiety.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t consider myself</p>
<p>a particularly competitive person,</p>
<p>but I would sooner die than disappoint</p>
<p>or let down one of my friends.</p>
<p>I can think of nothing worse actually</p>
<p>than disappointing one of my friends.</p>
<p>Everything else is secondary to me.</p>
<p>Well, disappointment.</p>
<p>Disappointing meaning not,</p>
<p>I mean, certainly I strive always to show up</p>
<p>as best I can for the friendship</p>
<p>and that can be in small ways.</p>
<p>That can mean making sure the phone is away.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m terrible with punctuality because I&rsquo;m an academic</p>
<p>and so I just get lost in time</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean anything by it,</p>
<p>but striving to listen, to enjoy good times</p>
<p>and to make time,</p>
<p>it kind of goes back to this first variable we talked about</p>
<p>to make sure that I spend time</p>
<p>and to get time in person and check in.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s so many ways</p>
<p>in which friendship is vital to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually to me what makes life worth living.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I am surprised like with the high school friends</p>
<p>how we don&rsquo;t actually talk that often these days</p>
<p>in terms of time,</p>
<p>but every time we see each other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s immediately right back to where we started.</p>
<p>So I struggle with that,</p>
<p>how much time you really allocate</p>
<p>for the friendship to be deeply meaningful</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re always there with me,</p>
<p>even if we don&rsquo;t talk often.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a kind of loyalty.</p>
<p>I think maybe it&rsquo;s a different style,</p>
<p>but I think to me,</p>
<p>friendship is being there in the hard times, I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more reliable when you&rsquo;re going through shit</p>
<p>than like-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pretty reliable anyway.</p>
<p>No, but if you&rsquo;re like a wedding or something like that,</p>
<p>or like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like you want an award of some kind,</p>
<p>yeah, I&rsquo;ll congratulate the shit out of you,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not, and I&rsquo;ll be there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not as important to me as being there</p>
<p>when nobody else is.</p>
<p>Just being there when shit hits the fan</p>
<p>or something stuff where the world turns their back on you,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That to me, that&rsquo;s where friendship is meaningful.</p>
<p>Well, I know that to be true about you,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a felt thing and a real thing with you.</p>
<p>Let me ask one more thing about that actually,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not a practitioner of jujitsu.</p>
<p>I know you are, Joe is,</p>
<p>but years ago I read a book that I really enjoyed,</p>
<p>which is Sam Sheridan&rsquo;s book, A Fighter&rsquo;s Heart.</p>
<p>He talks about all these different forms of martial arts,</p>
<p>and maybe it was in the book,</p>
<p>maybe it was in an interview,</p>
<p>but he said that fighting or being in physical battle</p>
<p>with somebody, jujitsu, boxing,</p>
<p>or some other form of direct physical contact</p>
<p>between two individuals creates this bond unlike any other,</p>
<p>because he said, it&rsquo;s like a one night stand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sharing bodily fluids with somebody</p>
<p>that you barely know.</p>
<p>And I chuckled about it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of funny and kind of tongue in cheek.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>I think this is a fundamental way</p>
<p>in which members of a species bond</p>
<p>is through physical contact.</p>
<p>And certainly there are other forms,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s cuddling and there&rsquo;s hand holding,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s sexual intercourse,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s all sorts of things.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s cuddling?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard of it.</p>
<p>I heard this recently, I didn&rsquo;t know this term,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a term,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve turned the noun cupcake into a verb.</p>
<p>Cupcaking, it turns out, I just learned about this.</p>
<p>Cupcaking is when you spend time just cuddling.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know about this.</p>
<p>You heard it here first,</p>
<p>although I heard it first just the other day.</p>
<p>Cupcaking is actually a verb.</p>
<p>Cuddling is everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like, is it in bed or is it on the couch?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s cuddling?</p>
<p>I need to look up what cuddling is.</p>
<p>We need to look at this stuff</p>
<p>and we need to define the variables.</p>
<p>I think it definitely has to do with physical contact,</p>
<p>I am told.</p>
<p>But in terms of battle, competition,</p>
<p>and the Sheridan quote, I&rsquo;m just curious.</p>
<p>So do you get close or feel a bond with people that,</p>
<p>for instance, you roll jiu-jitsu with,</p>
<p>or even though you don&rsquo;t know anything else about them,</p>
<p>was he right about this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, on many levels.</p>
<p>He also has the book,</p>
<p>What a Fighter&rsquo;s Mind and First Art.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was just the second one.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually an excellent writer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about him, just briefly about Sheridan,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know him, but I did a little bit of research.</p>
<p>He went to Harvard.</p>
<p>He was an art major at Harvard.</p>
<p>He claims all he did was smoke cigarettes</p>
<p>and do art.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if his art was any good.</p>
<p>And I think his father was in the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>And then when he got out of Harvard, graduated,</p>
<p>he took off around the world,</p>
<p>learning all the forms of martial arts</p>
<p>and was early to the kind of ultimate fighting</p>
<p>to kind of mix martial arts and things.</p>
<p>Great, great book.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually remember it, but I read it.</p>
<p>I remember thinking there was an amazing encapsulation</p>
<p>of what makes fighting the art,</p>
<p>like what makes it compelling.</p>
<p>I would say that there&rsquo;s so many ways</p>
<p>that jiu-jitsu, grappling, wrestling,</p>
<p>combat sports in general</p>
<p>is like one of the most intimate things you can do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I would describe it</p>
<p>in terms of bodily liquids and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think he was more or less joking, but.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a few ways that it does that.</p>
<p>So one, because you&rsquo;re so vulnerable.</p>
<p>So that the honesty of stepping on the mat</p>
<p>and often all of us have ego thinking</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re better than we are at this particular art.</p>
<p>And then the honesty of being submitted</p>
<p>or being worse than you thought you are</p>
<p>and just sitting with that knowledge,</p>
<p>that kind of honesty,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t get to experience it in most of daily life.</p>
<p>We can continue living somewhat of an illusion</p>
<p>of our conceptions of ourselves</p>
<p>because people are not going to hit us with the reality.</p>
<p>The mat speaks only the truth</p>
<p>that the reality just hits you.</p>
<p>And that vulnerability is the same</p>
<p>as like the loss of a loved one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the loss of a reality that you knew before.</p>
<p>You now have to deal with this new reality.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re sitting there in that vulnerability</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s these other people</p>
<p>that are also sitting in that vulnerability,</p>
<p>you get to really connect like, fuck,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as special as I thought I was.</p>
<p>And life is like not,</p>
<p>life is harsher than I thought I was.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just sitting there with that reality.</p>
<p>Some of us can put words to them, some we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I think that definitely is a thing</p>
<p>that leads to intimacy.</p>
<p>The other thing is the human contact.</p>
<p>There is something about, I mean, like a big hug.</p>
<p>Like during COVID, very few people hug me.</p>
<p>And I hugged them.</p>
<p>And I always felt good when they did.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re all tested.</p>
<p>And especially now we&rsquo;re vaccinated,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still people, this is true of San Francisco.</p>
<p>This is true in Boston.</p>
<p>They wanna keep not only six feet away,</p>
<p>but stay at home and never touch you.</p>
<p>That was, that loss of basic humanity is the opposite</p>
<p>of what I feel in jujitsu, where it was like that contact</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t give a shit</p>
<p>about whatever rules we&rsquo;re supposed to have</p>
<p>in society where you&rsquo;re not, you have to keep a distance</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Just the hug, like that, the intimacy of a hug</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a good bear hug.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like just controlling another person.</p>
<p>And also there is some kind of love communicating</p>
<p>through just trying to break each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t exactly understand why violence</p>
<p>is such a close neighbor to love, but it is.</p>
<p>Well, in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>the neurons that control sexual behavior,</p>
<p>but also non-sexual contact are not just nearby</p>
<p>the neurons that control aggression and fighting.</p>
<p>They are salt and pepper with those neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting, and it almost sounds kind of risque</p>
<p>and controversial and stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not anthropomorphizing about what this means,</p>
<p>but in the brain, those structures are interdigitated.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t separate them except at a very fine level.</p>
<p>And here, the way you describe it is the same</p>
<p>as a real thing.</p>
<p>I do want to make an interesting comment.</p>
<p>Again, these are the things that could be taken</p>
<p>out of context, but one of the amazing things</p>
<p>about jujitsu is both guys and girls train it.</p>
<p>And I was surprised.</p>
<p>So like, I&rsquo;m a big fan of yoga pants,</p>
<p>at the gym kind of thing.</p>
<p>It reveals the beauty of the female form.</p>
<p>But the thing is, girls are dressed in skintight clothes</p>
<p>in jujitsu often, and I found myself not at all</p>
<p>thinking like that at all when training with girls.</p>
<p>Well, the context is very non-sexual.</p>
<p>But I was surprised to learn that.</p>
<p>When I first started jujitsu, I thought,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t that be kind of weird to train</p>
<p>with the opposites in something so intimate?</p>
<p>Boys and girls, men and women,</p>
<p>they roll jujitsu together completely.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And the only times girls kind of try to stay away from guys,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s two contexts.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s always going to be creeps in this world.</p>
<p>So everyone knows who kind of to stay away from.</p>
<p>And the other is like, there&rsquo;s a size disparity.</p>
<p>So girls will often try to roll with people</p>
<p>a little bit closer weight-wise.</p>
<p>But no, that&rsquo;s one of the things that are empowering</p>
<p>to women, that&rsquo;s what they fall in love with</p>
<p>when they start doing jujitsu is,</p>
<p>first of all, they gain an awareness</p>
<p>and a pride over their body, which is great.</p>
<p>And then second, they get to, especially later on,</p>
<p>start submitting big dudes,</p>
<p>like these like bros that come in who are all shredded</p>
<p>and like muscular, and they get to technique</p>
<p>to exercise dominance over them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a powerful feeling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen women force a larger guy to tap</p>
<p>or even choke him out.</p>
<p>Well, I was deadlifting for,</p>
<p>oh boy, I think it&rsquo;s 495.</p>
<p>So I was really into powerlifting when I started jujitsu.</p>
<p>And I remember being submitted by,</p>
<p>I thought I walked in feeling like I&rsquo;m going to be,</p>
<p>if not the greatest fighter ever, at least top three.</p>
<p>And so as a white belt, you roll in like all happy.</p>
<p>And then you realize that as long as you&rsquo;re not applying</p>
<p>too much force, that you&rsquo;re having,</p>
<p>I remember being submitted many times</p>
<p>by like 130, 120 pound girls</p>
<p>at balance studios in Philadelphia</p>
<p>that a lot of incredible female jujitsu players.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really humbling too,</p>
<p>that technique can overpower in combat pure strength.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the other thing,</p>
<p>that there is something about combat that&rsquo;s primal.</p>
<p>Like it just feels,</p>
<p>it feels like we were born to do this.</p>
<p>We have circuits in our brain</p>
<p>that are dedicated to this kind of interaction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it felt like.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;m learning a new skill.</p>
<p>It was like somehow I am remembering echoes</p>
<p>of something I&rsquo;ve learned in the past.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like hitting puberty.</p>
<p>A child before puberty has no concept of boys and girls</p>
<p>having this attraction,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re attracted to boys or girls.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>At some point, most people, not all, but certainly,</p>
<p>but most people, when they hit puberty,</p>
<p>suddenly people appear differently.</p>
<p>And certain people take on a romantic or sexual interest</p>
<p>for the very first time.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s revealing a circuitry in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they learn that, it&rsquo;s innate.</p>
<p>And I think when I hear the way you describe jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>and rolling jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>it reminds me a little bit,</p>
<p>Joe was telling me recently</p>
<p>about the first time he went hunting</p>
<p>and he felt like it revealed a circuit</p>
<p>that was in him all along,</p>
<p>but he hadn&rsquo;t experienced before.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s definitely there.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s the physical activity.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things about jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s one of the really strenuous exercises</p>
<p>that you can do late into your adult life,</p>
<p>into your 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s.</p>
<p>When I came up, there&rsquo;s a few people in their 80s</p>
<p>that were training.</p>
<p>And as long as you&rsquo;re smart,</p>
<p>as long as you practice techniques</p>
<p>and pick your partners correctly,</p>
<p>you can do that kind of art.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s late into life and so you&rsquo;re getting exercise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many activities, I find,</p>
<p>that are amenable to that.</p>
<p>So because it&rsquo;s such a thinking game,</p>
<p>the jiu-jitsu in particular is an art</p>
<p>where technique pays off a lot.</p>
<p>So you can still maintain, first of all,</p>
<p>remain injury free if you use good technique</p>
<p>and also through good technique,</p>
<p>be able to go, be active with people</p>
<p>that are much, much younger.</p>
<p>And so that was to me,</p>
<p>that and running are the two activities</p>
<p>you can kind of do late in life</p>
<p>because to me, a healthy life has exercises</p>
<p>as the piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>No, absolutely.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad that we&rsquo;re on the physical component</p>
<p>because I know that there&rsquo;s, for you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked before about the crossover</p>
<p>between the physical and the intellectual and the mental.</p>
<p>Are you still running at ridiculous hours of the night</p>
<p>for ridiculously long?</p>
<p>Yeah, so definitely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been running late at night here in Austin.</p>
<p>People tell me, the area we&rsquo;re in now,</p>
<p>people say is a dangerous area,</p>
<p>which I find laughable coming from the bigger cities.</p>
<p>No, I run late at night.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>if you see a guy running through Austin at 2 a.m.</p>
<p>in a suit and tie, it&rsquo;s probably.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, I do think about that</p>
<p>because I get recognized more and more in Austin.</p>
<p>I worry that, not really,</p>
<p>that I get recognized late at night, you know.</p>
<p>But there is something about the night</p>
<p>that brings out those deep philosophical thoughts</p>
<p>and self-reflection that I really enjoy.</p>
<p>But recently, I started getting back to the grind.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to be competing,</p>
<p>or hoping to be compete in September and October.</p>
<p>In Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
<p>In Jiu-Jitsu, yeah, to get back to competition.</p>
<p>And so that requires getting back into great cardio shape.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting running as part of my daily routine.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Well, I always know I can reach you,</p>
<p>regardless of time zone, in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>wherever that happens.</p>
<p>Well, part of that has to be just being single</p>
<p>and being a programmer.</p>
<p>Those two things just don&rsquo;t work well</p>
<p>in terms of a steady sleep schedule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not banker&rsquo;s hours kind of work.</p>
<p>No. Nine to five.</p>
<p>I want to, you mentioned single.</p>
<p>I want to ask you a little bit</p>
<p>about the other form of relationship,</p>
<p>which is romantic love.</p>
<p>So your parents are still married?</p>
<p>Still married, still happily married.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A rare thing nowadays.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I grew up with that example.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess that&rsquo;s a powerful thing, right?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s an example that I think can work.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t have that in my own family,</p>
<p>but when I see it, it&rsquo;s inspiring and it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>The fact that they have that,</p>
<p>and that was the norm for you, I think is really wonderful.</p>
<p>It was, in the case of my parents,</p>
<p>it was interesting to watch</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s obviously tension.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;ll be times where they fought</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>They obviously get frustrated with each other,</p>
<p>and they like, but they find mechanisms</p>
<p>how to communicate that to each other,</p>
<p>like to make fun of each other a little bit,</p>
<p>like to tease, to get some of that frustration out,</p>
<p>and then ultimately to reunite</p>
<p>and find their joyful moments and be that the energy.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s clear,</p>
<p>because I got together in their, I think early twenties,</p>
<p>like very, very young.</p>
<p>I think you grow together as people.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re still in the critical period</p>
<p>of brain plasticity.</p>
<p>And also, I mean, it&rsquo;s just like divorce</p>
<p>was so frowned upon that you stick it out.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of couples,</p>
<p>especially from that time in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably applies to a lot of cultures.</p>
<p>You stick it out and you put in the work,</p>
<p>you learn how to put in the work.</p>
<p>And once you do, you start to get</p>
<p>to some of those rewarding aspects of being like,</p>
<p>through time, sharing so many moments together.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s definitely something</p>
<p>that was an inspiration to me,</p>
<p>but maybe that&rsquo;s where I have,</p>
<p>so I have a similar kind of longing</p>
<p>to have a lifelong partner,</p>
<p>like that have that kind of view,</p>
<p>where same with friendship,</p>
<p>lifelong friendship is the most meaningful kind,</p>
<p>that there is something with that time</p>
<p>of sharing all that time together,</p>
<p>like till death do us part as a powerful thing,</p>
<p>not by force, not because the religion said it</p>
<p>or the government said it or your culture said it,</p>
<p>but because you want to.</p>
<p>Do you want children?</p>
<p>Definitely, yeah.</p>
<p>Definitely want children.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s common.</p>
<p>How many Roombas do you have?</p>
<p>Oh, I thought-</p>
<p>You should, no, no.</p>
<p>Oh, human children.</p>
<p>No, human children.</p>
<p>Because I already have the children.</p>
<p>Exactly, well, I was saying,</p>
<p>you probably need at least as many human children</p>
<p>as you do Roombas, big family, small family.</p>
<p>So in your mind&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>is there a bunch of little freedmen&rsquo;s running around?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you, like realistically,</p>
<p>I can explain exactly my thinking.</p>
<p>And this is similar to the robotics work,</p>
<p>is if I&rsquo;m like purely logical right now,</p>
<p>my answer would be, I don&rsquo;t want kids</p>
<p>because I just don&rsquo;t have enough time.</p>
<p>I have so much going on.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m using the same kind of vision I use</p>
<p>for the robots is,</p>
<p>I know my life will be transformed with the first.</p>
<p>Like I know I would love being a father.</p>
<p>And so the question of how many,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the other side of that hill.</p>
<p>It could be some ridiculous number.</p>
<p>So I just know that-</p>
<p>I have a feeling and I could be,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I see an upwards of certainly three or more comes to mind.</p>
<p>So much of that has to do with the partner you&rsquo;re with too.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s such an open question,</p>
<p>especially in this society,</p>
<p>of what the right partnership is.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m deeply empathetic.</p>
<p>I want to see, like to me,</p>
<p>what I look for in a relationship is for me</p>
<p>to be really excited about the passions of another person,</p>
<p>like whatever they&rsquo;re into.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a career success,</p>
<p>any kind of success, just to be excited for them</p>
<p>and for them to be excited for me.</p>
<p>And they can share in that excitement</p>
<p>and build and build and build.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also practical aspects of like,</p>
<p>what kind of shit do you enjoy doing together?</p>
<p>And I think family is a real serious undertaking.</p>
<p>Oh, it certainly is.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that I have a friend who said it,</p>
<p>I think best, which is that you first have,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in a very successful relationship and has a family.</p>
<p>And he said, you first have to define the role</p>
<p>and then you have to cast the right person for the role.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, there&rsquo;s some deep aspects of that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also an aspect to which you&rsquo;re not smart enough</p>
<p>from this side of it to define the right,</p>
<p>to define the role.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s part of it that has to be a leap</p>
<p>that you have to take.</p>
<p>And I see having kids that way.</p>
<p>You just have to go with it and figure it out also,</p>
<p>as long as there&rsquo;s love there.</p>
<p>Like what the hell is life for even?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so many incredibly successful people that I know,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve gotten to know that all have kids</p>
<p>and the presence of kids for the most part</p>
<p>has only been something that energized them,</p>
<p>something that gave them meaning,</p>
<p>something that made them the best versions of themselves,</p>
<p>like made them more productive, not less,</p>
<p>which is fascinating to me.</p>
<p>It is fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, you can imagine if the way that you felt about Homer,</p>
<p>the way that I feel and felt about Costello</p>
<p>is at all a glimpse of what that must be like, then-</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The downside, the thing I worry more about</p>
<p>is the partner side of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the kids are almost universally</p>
<p>a source of increased productivity and joy and happiness.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, they&rsquo;re a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>Yeah, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>People like to complain about kids,</p>
<p>but when you actually look past</p>
<p>that little shallow layer of complaint, kids are great.</p>
<p>The source of pain for a lot of people</p>
<p>is when the relationship doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m very kind of concerned about,</p>
<p>dating is very difficult and I&rsquo;m a complicated person.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been very difficult</p>
<p>to find the right kind of person.</p>
<p>But that statement doesn&rsquo;t even make sense</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not on dating apps.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like the first person I saw in a while.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you, Michael Malice, and like Joe.</p>
<p>So like, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen like a female,</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>An element of the female species in quite a while.</p>
<p>So I think you have to put yourself out there.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Daniel Johnston says, true love will find you,</p>
<p>but only if you&rsquo;re looking.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some element of really taking the leap</p>
<p>and putting yourself out there</p>
<p>in kind of different situations.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to do that</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re behind a computer all the time.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re a builder and you&rsquo;re a problem solver</p>
<p>and you find solutions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m confident the solution is out there.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re implying that I&rsquo;m going to build</p>
<p>the girlfriend, which I think-</p>
<p>Or that you, well,</p>
<p>and maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t separate this friendship,</p>
<p>the notion of friendship and community.</p>
<p>And if we go back to this concept of the aggregate,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll meet this woman through a friend</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>So one of the things, I don&rsquo;t know if you feel the same way.</p>
<p>I definitely, one of those people that just falls in love</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m like that.</p>
<p>With Costello, it was instantaneous.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It really was.</p>
<p>I mean, I know it&rsquo;s not romantic love,</p>
<p>but it was instantaneous.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>And I think that if you know, you know,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a good thing that you have that.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m very careful with that</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t want to fall in love with the wrong person.</p>
<p>So I try to be very kind of careful with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this because I fall in love with everything,</p>
<p>like this mug, everything.</p>
<p>I fall in love with things in this world.</p>
<p>So like, you have to be really careful</p>
<p>because a girl comes up to you and says,</p>
<p>she loves Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you need to marry her tonight.</p>
<p>Yes, and I liked the way you said that out loud</p>
<p>so that you heard it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to marry her tonight.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I mean, but people are amazing</p>
<p>and people are beautiful and that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m fully embraced that,</p>
<p>but I also have to be careful with relationships.</p>
<p>And at the same time, like I mentioned to you offline,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s something about me that appreciates</p>
<p>swinging for the fences and not dating,</p>
<p>like doing serial dating or dating around.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a one guy, one girl kind of guy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tricky because you want to be careful</p>
<p>with that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Especially now there&rsquo;s a growing platform</p>
<p>that have a ridiculous amount of female interest</p>
<p>of a certain kind, but I&rsquo;m looking for deep connection</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m looking by sitting home alone.</p>
<p>And every once in a while talking to Stanford professors.</p>
<p>Perfect solution.</p>
<p>On a podcast.</p>
<p>Perfect solution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to work out great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well incorporated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of, that constitutes machine learning of sorts.</p>
<p>Yeah, of sorts.</p>
<p>I would do, you mentioned what has now become</p>
<p>a quite extensive and expansive public platform,</p>
<p>which is incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, the number of people out,</p>
<p>first time I saw your podcast, I noticed the suit.</p>
<p>I was like, he respects his audience, which was great.</p>
<p>But I also thought, this is amazing.</p>
<p>People are showing up for science and engineering</p>
<p>and technology information and those discussions</p>
<p>and other sorts of discussions now.</p>
<p>I do want to talk for a moment about the podcast.</p>
<p>So my two questions about the podcast are,</p>
<p>when you started it, did you have a plan?</p>
<p>And regardless of what that answer is,</p>
<p>do you know where you&rsquo;re taking it?</p>
<p>Or would you like to leave us?</p>
<p>I do believe in an element of surprise is always fun.</p>
<p>But what about the podcast?</p>
<p>Do you enjoy the podcast?</p>
<p>I mean, your audience certainly includes me,</p>
<p>really enjoys the podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>So I love talking to people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about microphones</p>
<p>that really bring out the best in people.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t get a chance to talk like this.</p>
<p>If you and I were just hanging out,</p>
<p>we would have a very different conversation</p>
<p>in the amount of focus we allocate to each other.</p>
<p>We would be having fun talking about other stuff</p>
<p>and doing other things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be a lot of distraction.</p>
<p>There would be some phone use and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But here we&rsquo;re 100% focused on each other</p>
<p>and focused on the idea.</p>
<p>And like sometimes playing with ideas</p>
<p>that we both don&rsquo;t know like the answer to,</p>
<p>like a question we don&rsquo;t know the answer to.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both like fumbling with it, trying to figure out,</p>
<p>trying to get some insights</p>
<p>at something we haven&rsquo;t really figured out before</p>
<p>and together arriving at that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s magical.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why we need microphones for that,</p>
<p>but we somehow do.</p>
<p>Feels like doing science.</p>
<p>It feels like doing science for me, definitely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really glad you said that</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t actually often say this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s exactly what I felt like.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk to friends and colleagues at MIT</p>
<p>to do real science together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I felt about it.</p>
<p>Like to really talk through problems</p>
<p>that are actually interesting</p>
<p>as opposed to like incremental work</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re currently working for a particular conference.</p>
<p>So really asking questions like, what are we doing?</p>
<p>Like, where&rsquo;s this headed to?</p>
<p>Like, what are the big,</p>
<p>is this really going to help us solve,</p>
<p>in the case of AI, solve intelligence?</p>
<p>Like, is this even working on intelligence?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain sense,</p>
<p>which is why I initially called it artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>is like most of us are not working</p>
<p>on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working on some very specific problem</p>
<p>and a set of techniques.</p>
<p>At the time, it&rsquo;s machine learning</p>
<p>to solve this particular problem.</p>
<p>This is not going to take us to a system</p>
<p>that is anywhere close to the generalizability</p>
<p>of the human mind.</p>
<p>Like the kind of stuff the human mind can do</p>
<p>in terms of memory, in terms of cognition,</p>
<p>in terms of reasoning, common sense reasoning.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t seem to take us there.</p>
<p>So the initial impulse was,</p>
<p>can I talk to these folks,</p>
<p>do science together through conversation?</p>
<p>And I also thought that there was not enough,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think there was enough good conversations</p>
<p>with world-class minds that I got to meet,</p>
<p>and not the ones with a book,</p>
<p>or this was the thing,</p>
<p>oftentimes you go on this tour when you have a book,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of minds that don&rsquo;t write books.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>And the books constrain the conversation too,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re talking about this thing, this book.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve noticed that</p>
<p>with people that haven&rsquo;t written a book, who are brilliant,</p>
<p>we get to talk about ideas in a new way.</p>
<p>We both haven&rsquo;t actually,</p>
<p>when we raise a question, we don&rsquo;t know the answer to it,</p>
<p>once the question is raised,</p>
<p>and we try to arrive there.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, I remember asking questions</p>
<p>of world-class researchers in deep learning</p>
<p>of why do neural networks work as well as they do?</p>
<p>That question is often loosely asked,</p>
<p>but like, when you have microphones,</p>
<p>and you have to think through it,</p>
<p>and you have 30 minutes to an hour</p>
<p>to think through it together,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s science.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>So that was the one goal.</p>
<p>The other one is,</p>
<p>I, again, don&rsquo;t usually talk about this,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some sense in which</p>
<p>I wanted to have dangerous conversations.</p>
<p>Part of the reasons I wanted to wear a suit</p>
<p>is like, I wanted to be fearless.</p>
<p>The reason I don&rsquo;t usually talk about it</p>
<p>is because I feel like I&rsquo;m not good at conversation.</p>
<p>So it looks like it doesn&rsquo;t match the current skill level,</p>
<p>but I wanted to have really dangerous conversations</p>
<p>that I uniquely would be able to do.</p>
<p>Not completely uniquely,</p>
<p>but like, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>and I had to ask myself,</p>
<p>what conversations can I do that Joe Rogan can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>For me, I know I bring this up,</p>
<p>but for me, that person I thought about</p>
<p>at the time was Putin.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s why I bring him up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, just like with Costello, he&rsquo;s not just a person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also an idea to me for what I strive for,</p>
<p>just to have those dangerous conversations.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m uniquely qualified is both the Russian,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;s the judo and the martial arts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of elements that make me have a conversation</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t had before.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few other people that I kept in mind,</p>
<p>like Don Knuth, he&rsquo;s a computer scientist from Stanford,</p>
<p>that I thought is one of the most beautiful minds ever.</p>
<p>And nobody really talked to him, like really talked to him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s did a few lectures, which people love,</p>
<p>but really just have a conversation with him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few people like that.</p>
<p>One of them passed away, John Conway,</p>
<p>that never got, we agreed to talk,</p>
<p>but he died before we did.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few people like that,</p>
<p>that I thought like, it&rsquo;s such a crime</p>
<p>to not hear those folks.</p>
<p>And I have the unique ability to know how to purchase</p>
<p>a microphone on Amazon and plug it into a device</p>
<p>that records audio and then publish it,</p>
<p>which seems relatively unique.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s not easy in the scientific community,</p>
<p>people knowing how to plug in a microphone.</p>
<p>No, they can build Faraday cages and two photon microscopes</p>
<p>and bioengineer all sorts of things.</p>
<p>But the idea that you could take ideas</p>
<p>and export them into a structure or a pseudostructure</p>
<p>that people would benefit from,</p>
<p>seems like a cosmic achievement to them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a fear or just basically</p>
<p>they haven&rsquo;t tried it,</p>
<p>so they haven&rsquo;t learned the skill level.</p>
<p>But I think they&rsquo;re not trained.</p>
<p>I mean, we could riff on this for a while,</p>
<p>but I think that, but it&rsquo;s important and maybe we should,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re not trained to do it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trained to think in specific aims</p>
<p>and specific hypotheses,</p>
<p>and many of them don&rsquo;t care to, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, they became scientists</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where they felt safe.</p>
<p>And so why would they leave that haven of safety?</p>
<p>Well, they also don&rsquo;t necessarily always see the value in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re all together learning.</p>
<p>You and I are learning the value of this.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re probably,</p>
<p>you have an exceptionally successful and amazing podcast</p>
<p>that you started just recently.</p>
<p>Thanks to your encouragement.</p>
<p>Well, but there&rsquo;s a raw skill there</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re definitely an inspiration to me</p>
<p>in how you do the podcast,</p>
<p>in the level of excellence you reach.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s also an impactful way to do science,</p>
<p>that podcast.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of scientists have not yet discovered that,</p>
<p>that this is, if they apply the same kind of rigor</p>
<p>as they do to academic publication</p>
<p>or to even conference presentations,</p>
<p>and they do that rigor and effort to podcast,</p>
<p>whatever that is, that could be a five-minute podcast,</p>
<p>a two-hour podcast, it could be conversational,</p>
<p>or it can be more like lecture-like.</p>
<p>If they apply that effort,</p>
<p>you have the potential to reach,</p>
<p>over time, tens of thousands,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands, millions of people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really, really powerful.</p>
<p>But yeah, for me,</p>
<p>giving a platform to a few of those folks,</p>
<p>especially for me personally,</p>
<p>so maybe you can speak to what fields you&rsquo;re drawn to,</p>
<p>but I thought computer scientists</p>
<p>were especially bad at this.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s brilliant computer scientists</p>
<p>that I thought would be amazing to explore their mind,</p>
<p>explore their thinking.</p>
<p>And so I took that almost on as an effort.</p>
<p>And at the same time, I had other guests in mind</p>
<p>or people that connect to my own interests.</p>
<p>So the wrestling,</p>
<p>wrestling, music, football,</p>
<p>both American football and soccer.</p>
<p>I have a few particular people that I&rsquo;m really interested in.</p>
<p>Bovai Tsar, Satyavs, the Satyav brothers,</p>
<p>even Khabib for wrestling, just to talk to them.</p>
<p>Because-</p>
<p>Oh, because you guys can communicate.</p>
<p>In Russian and in wrestling.</p>
<p>As wrestlers and as Russians.</p>
<p>And so that little,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an opportunity to explore a mind</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m able to bring to the world.</p>
<p>And also, I feel like it makes me a better person</p>
<p>just that being that vulnerable</p>
<p>and exploring ideas together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like good conversation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how often</p>
<p>you have really good conversation with friends,</p>
<p>but like podcasts are like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s deeply moving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best, you know?</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;ve brought through,</p>
<p>I mean, when I saw you sit down with Penrose,</p>
<p>you know, Nobel prize-winning physicist</p>
<p>and these other folks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just because he has a Nobel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what comes out of his mouth is incredible.</p>
<p>And what you were able to hold in that conversation</p>
<p>was so much better.</p>
<p>Light years beyond what he had any other interviewer,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to even call you an interviewer</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really about conversation,</p>
<p>light years beyond what anyone else had been able</p>
<p>to engage with him was such a beacon of what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And I know that, I think that&rsquo;s what people are drawn to.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain intimacy</p>
<p>that certainly if two people are friends as we are</p>
<p>and they know each other, that there&rsquo;s more of that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an intimacy</p>
<p>in those kinds of private conversations</p>
<p>that are made public and-</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the, with you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably starting to realize,</p>
<p>and Costello, it&rsquo;s like part of it,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re authentic</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting yourself out there completely,</p>
<p>people are almost not just consuming the words you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>they also enjoy watching you, Andrew,</p>
<p>struggle with these ideas</p>
<p>or try to communicate these ideas.</p>
<p>They like the flaws, they like a human being-</p>
<p>Oh good, they like flaws?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s good because I got plenty of those.</p>
<p>Well, they like the self-critical aspects</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re very self-critical about your flaws.</p>
<p>I mean, in that same way, it&rsquo;s interesting, I think,</p>
<p>for people to watch me talk to Penrose,</p>
<p>not just because Penrose is communicating ideas,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s this silly kid trying to explore ideas.</p>
<p>They know this kid,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a human connection that is really powerful.</p>
<p>Same, I think, with Putin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a good interview with Putin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also here&rsquo;s this kid struggling</p>
<p>to talk with one of the most powerful,</p>
<p>and some would argue, dangerous people in the world.</p>
<p>They love that, the authenticity that led up to that.</p>
<p>And in return, I get to connect everybody I run to</p>
<p>in the street and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a depth of connection there</p>
<p>almost within a minute or two that&rsquo;s unlike any other.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an intimacy that you&rsquo;ve formed with them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been on this journey together.</p>
<p>I mean, I have the same thing with Joe Rogan</p>
<p>before I ever met him, right?</p>
<p>Because I was a fan of Joe for so many years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of friendship,</p>
<p>as absurd as it might be to say, in podcasting,</p>
<p>in listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe it fills in a little bit of that,</p>
<p>or solves a little bit of that loneliness</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Until the robots are here.</p>
<p>I have just a couple more questions,</p>
<p>but one of them is on behalf of your audience,</p>
<p>which is, I&rsquo;m not going to ask you</p>
<p>the meaning of the hedgehog,</p>
<p>but I just want to know, does it have a name?</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to tell us the name,</p>
<p>but just does it have a name, yes or no?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a name he likes to be referred to as,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a private name</p>
<p>in the privacy-owned company that we call each other.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not that insane.</p>
<p>No, his name is Hedgy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a hedgehog.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like stuffed animals,</p>
<p>but his story is one of minimalism.</p>
<p>So I gave away everything I own,</p>
<p>now three times in my life.</p>
<p>By everything, I mean, almost everything.</p>
<p>Kept jeans and shirt and a laptop.</p>
<p>And recently it&rsquo;s also been guitar, things like that.</p>
<p>But he survived because he was always in the,</p>
<p>at least in the first two times, was in the laptop bag</p>
<p>and he just got lucky.</p>
<p>And so I just like the perseverance of that.</p>
<p>And I first saw him in the,</p>
<p>the reason I got a stuffed animal</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have other stuffed animals</p>
<p>is it was in a thrift store</p>
<p>in this like giant pile of stuffed animals.</p>
<p>And he jumped out at me because unlike all the rest of them,</p>
<p>he has this intense, mean look about him.</p>
<p>That he&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s upset at life,</p>
<p>at the cruelty of life.</p>
<p>And just, especially in the contrast</p>
<p>of the other stuffed animals,</p>
<p>they have this dumb smile on their face.</p>
<p>If you look at most stuffed animals,</p>
<p>they have this dumb look on their face.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just happy, it&rsquo;s like Pleasantville.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we say in neuroscience,</p>
<p>they have a smooth cortex, not many fold.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And this, like Hedgy like saw through all of it.</p>
<p>He was like Dostoevsky&rsquo;s man from underground.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a sense that he saw</p>
<p>the darkness of the world and persevered.</p>
<p>So like, and there&rsquo;s also a famous Russian cartoon,</p>
<p>Hedgehog in the Fog, that I grew up with,</p>
<p>I connected with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who know of that cartoon,</p>
<p>you can see it on YouTube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Hedgehog in the Fog?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just as you would expect,</p>
<p>especially from like early Soviet cartoons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hedgehog, like sad, walking through the fog,</p>
<p>exploring like loneliness and sadness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, but it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a piece of art.</p>
<p>People should, even if you don&rsquo;t speak Russian,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see, you&rsquo;ll understand.</p>
<p>Oh, the moment you said that, I was going to ask,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s in Russian, but of course it&rsquo;s in Russian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in Russian, but it&rsquo;s more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little speaking in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, there&rsquo;s an interesting exploration</p>
<p>of how you make sense of the world</p>
<p>when you see it only vaguely through the fog.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s trying to understand the world.</p>
<p>Here we have Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We have Bugs Bunny.</p>
<p>We have all these crazy animals</p>
<p>and you have the hedgehog in the fog.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain period, and this is again,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to attribute it to,</p>
<p>but it was really powerful,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s a period in Soviet history,</p>
<p>I think probably 70s and 80s where like,</p>
<p>especially kids were treated very seriously.</p>
<p>Like they were treated like they&rsquo;re able to deal</p>
<p>with the weightiness of life.</p>
<p>And that was reflected in the cartoons.</p>
<p>And it was allowed to have like really artistic content,</p>
<p>not like dumb cartoons that are trying to get you</p>
<p>to be like smile and run around, but like create art,</p>
<p>like stuff that, you know how like short cartoons</p>
<p>or short films can win Oscars?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re swinging for.</p>
<p>So what strikes me about this is a little bit</p>
<p>how we were talking about the suit earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like they treat kids with respect.</p>
<p>Like that they have an intelligence</p>
<p>and they honor that intelligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re really just adult in a small body.</p>
<p>Like you want to protect them</p>
<p>from the true cruelty of the world.</p>
<p>But in terms of their intellectual capacity</p>
<p>or like philosophical capacity,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re right there with you.</p>
<p>And so the cartoons reflected that,</p>
<p>the art that they consumed, education reflected that.</p>
<p>So he represents that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a sense of, because he survived so long</p>
<p>and because I don&rsquo;t like stuffed animals,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;ve been through all of this together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same, sharing the moments together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the friendship.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sense in which, you know,</p>
<p>if all the world turns on you and goes to hell,</p>
<p>at least we got each other.</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t die because he&rsquo;s an inanimate object.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Until you animate him.</p>
<p>Until you animate him.</p>
<p>And then I probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to know</p>
<p>what he was thinking about this whole time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably really into Taylor Swift or something like that</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t even want to know.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Well, I now feel a connection to Hedgy the Hedgehog</p>
<p>that I certainly didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>And I think that encapsulates the kind of possibility</p>
<p>of connection that is possible between human</p>
<p>and other object and through robotics, certainly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a saying that I heard when I was a graduate student</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just been ringing in my mind</p>
<p>throughout this conversation in such a,</p>
<p>I think, appropriate way, which is that, Lex,</p>
<p>you are in a minority of one.</p>
<p>You are truly extraordinary in your ability</p>
<p>to encapsulate so many aspects of science, engineering,</p>
<p>public communication about so many topics,</p>
<p>martial arts, and the emotional depth that you bring to it.</p>
<p>And just the purposefulness.</p>
<p>And I think if it&rsquo;s not clear to people,</p>
<p>it absolutely should be stated,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s abundantly clear that just the amount</p>
<p>of time and thinking that you put into things</p>
<p>is it is the ultimate mark of respect.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just extraordinarily grateful for your friendship</p>
<p>and for this conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to be your friend.</p>
<p>And I just wish you showed me the same kind of respect</p>
<p>by wearing a suit and make your father proud</p>
<p>maybe next time.</p>
<p>Next time, indeed.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, my friend.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
