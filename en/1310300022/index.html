<p>Are you visiting a window display or holiday market in New York City, Seoul, South Korea,</p>
<p>or another major world capital?</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s episode, find out how we celebrate the holidays here in the US and three English</p>
<p>phrases you can use to express how these events make you feel.</p>
<p>Hello Aubrey.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it going today?</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m great.</p>
<p>Lindsey.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for the holidays.</p>
<p>This is my favorite time of year.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>This is such an exciting time of year.</p>
<p>We are like a week away from many of the holidays.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re right in the middle of the holiday season.</p>
<p>New Year&rsquo;s is coming.</p>
<p>Christmas is coming.</p>
<p>Hanukkah happened in December.</p>
<p>So we are super excited to be in this moment.</p>
<p>What comes to mind when you think about the holiday season, especially in New York City,</p>
<p>Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Where you and I both lived in New York, there is something very magical about Christmas</p>
<p>in New York, the holiday season in New York that doesn&rsquo;t really exist here in Arizona.</p>
<p>Yes, we&rsquo;re celebrating the holidays, but in New York, there&rsquo;s just a different feeling</p>
<p>that like envelops the whole city with the giant tree in Rockefeller Center and the windows</p>
<p>at Macy&rsquo;s, right?</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>I loved being there with my family during this time of year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really amazing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think part of it is because there are so many movies that are based in New York</p>
<p>City at the holiday season, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been part of it, you know, songs, movies, music, all these things.</p>
<p>The F.A.O.</p>
<p>Schwartz department store, which is so famous from the movie Big, right?</p>
<p>Do you remember Tom Hanks?</p>
<p>The giant piano, which they still have upstairs there.</p>
<p>My kids played the piano jumping around on it.</p>
<p>So fun.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Did you go to the Rockettes when you were in New York?</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We went and saw the Rockettes with our kids.</p>
<p>They loved it.</p>
<p>Like stars in their eyes during the whole show.</p>
<p>So fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to replicate a New York holiday season in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>But what do you do at home?</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t quite have, you know, all of the settings in Arizona, but you guys must</p>
<p>have your own little traditions.</p>
<p>We do for sure.</p>
<p>We like to make, we&rsquo;ll get cocoa and we all have our cocoa and then we drive around to</p>
<p>see everyone&rsquo;s Christmas lights because a lot of people put holiday lights on their</p>
<p>homes and some of them will have like a big display set to music, almost like what you</p>
<p>see at Rockefeller center, of course, on a much bigger scale, but you know, at their</p>
<p>home and they&rsquo;ll have like a radio station.</p>
<p>You set it to, our kids love that.</p>
<p>They look forward to it.</p>
<p>We do an advent calendar where every day they get a little toy or a little chocolate, like</p>
<p>counting down the days till Christmas.</p>
<p>Do you do an advent calendar?</p>
<p>Very cute.</p>
<p>No, I think we didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>But we did have that tradition when I was a kid where we would drive around and go look</p>
<p>at everyone&rsquo;s light display, lighting display, especially in the nineties.</p>
<p>That was hot because you know, everyone was like, let&rsquo;s just blast this place out with</p>
<p>so many lights.</p>
<p>The more the better.</p>
<p>And we do put up a tree, right?</p>
<p>We have all of our ornaments.</p>
<p>We have collected ornaments from every trip we take vacation.</p>
<p>So we have ornaments from all over the world, right?</p>
<p>A little sombrero from Mexico and an Eiffel tower from France and a few from New York.</p>
<p>So we kind of love to just like look at our Christmas tree with all of the ornaments from</p>
<p>all over the world.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It sounds like you and I have a lot of similar traditions and some different ones and you</p>
<p>know, city life also brings up this concept of window shopping and seeing those window</p>
<p>displays as we mentioned earlier, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Now in Arizona, do the big department stores set up these window displays for the holiday</p>
<p>season?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely not the same as in New York.</p>
<p>We went to like Macy&rsquo;s and you know, down, um, where all of those beautiful windows,</p>
<p>the detail was so amazing.</p>
<p>We went every year and there would be throngs of people just lined up to see the displays</p>
<p>in the windows with all, it was fantastic for kids and adults.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really have that in Arizona because we don&rsquo;t have foot traffic in the same way.</p>
<p>Like you drive to a mall and you go in and sure they have like the newest fashions in</p>
<p>the windows, but they do nothing like those New York windows with all of the detail.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s never the same.</p>
<p>And I love the expression to use the throngs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bonus for our listeners today listening to this episode, throngs of people.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>I love that word.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like a very dense crowd of people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost hard to see what&rsquo;s in the window because of all the people trying to see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re in a big crowd, I think of the Thanksgiving Macy&rsquo;s Day parade.</p>
<p>We went and saw that once and we were definitely in a throng of people where everyone&rsquo;s packed</p>
<p>in so tight.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Well, this concept, this trend, while it doesn&rsquo;t really work in suburban USA, it definitely</p>
<p>works in a place like New York City.</p>
<p>The trend of the super detailed, beautiful holiday window displays and the trend is spreading</p>
<p>all over the world, right?</p>
<p>Specifically, I know that there&rsquo;s a famous department store that we&rsquo;re going to touch</p>
<p>on in South Korea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to touch on that in just a minute and pull in our listeners and ask our listeners,</p>
<p>you know, is this happening in their countries too?</p>
<p>But first I want to take a minute to call out our listeners from South Korea just to</p>
<p>say thank you.</p>
<p>Who reviewed us in South Korea, Aubrey?</p>
<p>What are these names?</p>
<p>Can you go ahead and call them out for us?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We have Jinok Song who said they listen to Allure&rsquo;s English when they work out.</p>
<p>I love that so much.</p>
<p>I love that too.</p>
<p>Hoho said listens every day.</p>
<p>Olivia listens while putting on makeup in the morning and wants to push her level up</p>
<p>to advanced.</p>
<p>I think this is so smart to multitask while you listen.</p>
<p>So smart.</p>
<p>So smart.</p>
<p>And then we have Siegfried73 who is a police detective from South Korea living in New York</p>
<p>City.</p>
<p>I love that we have all these listeners from South Korea around the world and you&rsquo;re finding</p>
<p>time to improve your English with us.</p>
<p>Yes, I love it.</p>
<p>So thank you to our listeners from South Korea for reviewing Allure&rsquo;s English.</p>
<p>And if you haven&rsquo;t left a review yet, go ahead and do that now.</p>
<p>So in general, Aubrey, are you a big window shopper outside of the holiday season?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not at all.</p>
<p>I have never&hellip;</p>
<p>I did love looking at the windows in New York, but I would never see something in a window</p>
<p>and impulsively go in and buy it.</p>
<p>I want to research and get the best deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more likely to buy something cheap online or that&rsquo;s on sale somewhere rather</p>
<p>than spending because often the things we see in these windows are extremely expensive.</p>
<p>Expensive.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>I remember when I was teaching English in Japan, I was surprised to see that when I</p>
<p>asked my adult students, I&rsquo;d say, hey, what are you doing this weekend, this coming weekend?</p>
<p>And one of the top three responses I would get would be window shopping.</p>
<p>And I was surprised too because I&rsquo;m really not into it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not into window shopping.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not part of my personal culture.</p>
<p>I mean, I love looking at these holiday displays.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wander in New York City and look at those, but to me, window shopping all year long is</p>
<p>quite different.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree, right?</p>
<p>And in the malls, like even just the smaller sort of retail department stores, I often</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even look at what&rsquo;s in the window.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to look in the window and say, what&rsquo;s the newest, latest?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going straight to the clearance rack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going straight to the sales like, okay, this was in the window last year, maybe six</p>
<p>months ago, and now I&rsquo;m going to get a good deal on it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have your priorities straight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bargain shopper.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re a bargain shopper.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Well, just in general, shopping is a big lift.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a heavy lift, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Getting in the car, driving across town and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But of course, at Christmas time, it becomes more of an event, a chance to socialize with</p>
<p>whoever has invited you to this place, this Christmas market, this window display, this</p>
<p>tree lighting.</p>
<p>These are all potential moments of connection.</p>
<p>So we have an article, which we&rsquo;ll link to if this is a blog post, in Time Out New York,</p>
<p>which lists the hottest window displays in New York City.</p>
<p>So what are those displays?</p>
<p>Who is still doing these really, really sophisticated window displays, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re visiting New York, you can still see these.</p>
<p>Bergdorf Goodman is the first one, Macy&rsquo;s, definitely, Bloomingdale&rsquo;s, and Saks Fifth</p>
<p>Avenue.</p>
<p>In fact, Sir Elton John helped unveil the new display at Windows, November 22nd, with</p>
<p>a performance of his new song, Your Song.</p>
<p>I wish I could have been there for that.</p>
<p>I would have loved that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one of his older songs.</p>
<p>You remember that song?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sing it because I don&rsquo;t want to impede on anyone&rsquo;s copyright, but yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s like a new relief.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>That is an older song.</p>
<p>I do know that song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful song.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they made a whole event around it.</p>
<p>The culture of window displays is still somewhat alive and well in New York, but it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a few of the big, big, big stores.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of the small mom and pop shops are really doing it, but we are seeing</p>
<p>this trend spread around the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a department store in Seoul, South Korea called Shunsegae that I heard about</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re taking it to another level.</p>
<p>I watched a video last night about this.</p>
<p>The entire front of the building is a movie and lights display where you have the nutcracker,</p>
<p>you see Christmas trees.</p>
<p>It is beautiful when you step back and look at it.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I wish I could be there this time of year.</p>
<p>So lucky everyone listening who&rsquo;s in South Korea and has seen it or can go.</p>
<p>Those of you who might go to South Korea, I&rsquo;m so glad that we&rsquo;re sharing that you could</p>
<p>potentially see this because that sounds amazing.</p>
<p>I would love to see it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And in just a minute, we&rsquo;re going to talk about how our listeners can take advantage</p>
<p>of this moment where you are with someone and how can you comment on what you are seeing.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re going to get to that in just a second.</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey, so do you think that this tradition though, you know, we&rsquo;ve just named five department</p>
<p>stores that are doing it and we&rsquo;ve said that in New York City, in the US, the mom and pop</p>
<p>shops are not really doing this anymore.</p>
<p>So do you think this tradition of window displays at the holiday season is dying?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my worry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to shop online.</p>
<p>Almost all of my Christmas shopping arrives on my porch via Amazon, you know, not going</p>
<p>to lie.</p>
<p>And so I think the reason, the stores are willing to put in the expense to do this because</p>
<p>those windows draw customers who then come inside and make purchases.</p>
<p>And the worry is if they see their business dropping, if they don&rsquo;t see the income from</p>
<p>that, they may have to stop doing it.</p>
<p>So as long as there&rsquo;s still foot traffic in a city where people come see the windows and</p>
<p>go in and make purchases, then it&rsquo;s justified for companies to, for these stores to continue</p>
<p>doing it.</p>
<p>But if shopping continues to go online at the rate it is, I worry that it will die out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It makes me think of, you know, how cities are changing, or I guess it&rsquo;s too soon after</p>
<p>the pandemic to really know, you know, how are cities changing.</p>
<p>But I know there is less foot traffic in New York City now than there was pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>Definitely right.</p>
<p>A lot of people are avoiding crowds even now, and that&rsquo;s the thing about New York.</p>
<p>Every time there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really a draw, like this, the windows, Rockefeller</p>
<p>Center, ice skating there, all the really fun things are also a draw for tourists.</p>
<p>So as a local, if you want to avoid crowds, you&rsquo;re not going to feel comfortable going</p>
<p>to any of those things, especially during the holidays.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>But really what I want all of our listeners to get from today&rsquo;s episode is some new vocabulary,</p>
<p>Aubrey.</p>
<p>This is going to be fantastic because it&rsquo;s not just the window displays at Bergdorf Goodman</p>
<p>or this department store in Korea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Christmas markets.</p>
<p>Last Christmas, I was in Germany and visited some of the holiday markets, and they were</p>
<p>beautiful, beautiful displays, amazing food.</p>
<p>What can we say when we&rsquo;re wandering, we&rsquo;re taking an evening out with our friends, native</p>
<p>speaker friend, what can we say about how this makes us feel?</p>
<p>This experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you guys three phrases because this is always going to happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be interesting things to see, especially around the holidays, and</p>
<p>we always go out with our friends, family.</p>
<p>This is such a fun thing to meet up with someone, and you want the vocabulary to be able to</p>
<p>comment on it in order to make that connection, right?</p>
<p>So our first phrase, I love this one, is to say, it brings me right back to, and then</p>
<p>you could maybe say, Christmas when I was a kid, or when I was young, celebrating the</p>
<p>holidays with my families.</p>
<p>I love that phrase.</p>
<p>It brings me right back to.</p>
<p>So guys, again, if you are in your home country, if you&rsquo;re in Korea, Japan, Germany, and you</p>
<p>were walking around and you go to this department store or this market, holiday market, you</p>
<p>can say this in English.</p>
<p>And what I like about this phrase is that it&rsquo;s kind of intimate, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sharing something of where your mind is going due to the details that you&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>a smell, a song that you&rsquo;re hearing in the window display.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very intimate to say this because it shows the person you&rsquo;re with what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on in your head.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about nostalgia, right?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re willing to share that something&rsquo;s giving you that feeling of nostalgia, reminding</p>
<p>you of good memories in your past, that&rsquo;s always going to be a bonding moment, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sharing with this person that you care enough about them to bring them into your</p>
<p>past and your happy memories.</p>
<p>Whenever someone does that for me, I feel closer to them.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I think this could also be a great way to build a business relationship potentially</p>
<p>by inviting someone out for an evening wandering a holiday market or looking at window displays</p>
<p>in downtown, you know, Seoul or in Tokyo or in New York City.</p>
<p>What do you think Aubrey?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Or if I know a lot of people still travel for work, if you&rsquo;re in sales at lots of different</p>
<p>companies and you&rsquo;re looking for something to do in the evening with coworkers, this</p>
<p>is perfect, right?</p>
<p>All of these different experiences, things to do.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll want that language to be able to talk about the things you&rsquo;re seeing in a very</p>
<p>native way.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>So we have two more phrases for our listeners.</p>
<p>What would be the next thing that we could say in English?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is blank is remarkable, that very interesting adjective.</p>
<p>So for example, the attention to detail in this window is remarkable.</p>
<p>And that just means it&rsquo;s excellent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very impressive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or the costumes are remarkable, right?</p>
<p>Or the characters are remarkable.</p>
<p>The music is&hellip; so remarkable is a more interesting word, right?</p>
<p>We like to use not common words in English.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of slang things you can say that, you know, like, oh, it&rsquo;s very cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re with coworkers, I love this word remarkable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little classier, a little more professional sounding.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>We should talk more on this podcast about elevated words, right?</p>
<p>What are the, you know, what is the word in everyday slang?</p>
<p>And then how can you elevate that when you&rsquo;re around a business audience?</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always an option that makes you sound more intelligent or professional.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s number three.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s number three.</p>
<p>It really puts me in the holiday spirit.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So another great way to share how you&rsquo;re feeling, how an experience alongside your native speaking</p>
<p>friend is transforming your mind.</p>
<p>Where is it bringing you?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is such a native expression to talk about the holiday spirit.</p>
<p>Something puts you in the holiday spirit, meaning it gives you that good feeling we</p>
<p>all experience around the holidays where we start thinking about giving gifts and serving</p>
<p>and helping others and anything we see, which might, you know, maybe just the lights or</p>
<p>the anything can put us in the holiday spirit.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So Aubrey, what&rsquo;s the takeaway for today?</p>
<p>I feel like this is such a good episode for, in a practical sense, for words and phrases</p>
<p>that our listeners can use.</p>
<p>But what else?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want, I think you guys should really be thinking about if something reminds you of</p>
<p>your childhood, gives you that feeling of nostalgia or puts you in the holiday spirit,</p>
<p>that is a moment of connection.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And I love how, you know, we&rsquo;re seeing all over the world in South Korea, in Japan, in</p>
<p>New York City, even in Germany around holiday events and displays and attention to detail.</p>
<p>But the thing that brings us together as a world community and lets us connect is English,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>We can, and the more detailed we can get and the more advanced in how we describe what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing, the better that connection can be, Aubrey.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Wherever you&rsquo;re traveling, English is your way to connect with others.</p>
<p>You might not speak the language everywhere you go, but more and more, you&rsquo;re likely to</p>
<p>find someone who speaks English.</p>
<p>I was grateful for this when I was in Scandinavia, traveling in Denmark, Finland, I was always</p>
<p>able to find someone who could speak English to me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t speak Swedish and Finnish and Danish, luckily, so we were still able to meet and</p>
<p>connect and I was grateful for that.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
