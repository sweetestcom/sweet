    <p>The following is a conversation with Rajat Manga.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an engineer and director of Google,</p>
<p>leading the TensorFlow team.</p>
<p>TensorFlow is an open source library</p>
<p>at the center of much of the work going on in the world</p>
<p>in deep learning, both the cutting edge research</p>
<p>and the large scale application of learning based approaches.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s quickly becoming much more than a software library.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now an ecosystem of tools for the deployment of machine</p>
<p>learning in the cloud, on the phone, in the browser,</p>
<p>on both generic and specialized hardware.</p>
<p>TPU, GPU, and so on.</p>
<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s a big emphasis on growing a passionate community</p>
<p>of developers.</p>
<p>Rajat, Jeff Dean, and a large team of engineers at Google</p>
<p>Brain are working to define the future of machine</p>
<p>learning with TensorFlow 2.0, which is now in alpha.</p>
<p>I think the decision to open source TensorFlow</p>
<p>is a definitive moment in the tech industry.</p>
<p>It showed that open innovation can be successful</p>
<p>and inspire many companies to open source their code,</p>
<p>to publish, and in general engage</p>
<p>in the open exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>This conversation is part of the Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>spelled F R I D.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Rajat Manga.</p>
<p>You were involved with Google Brain since its start in 2011</p>
<p>with Jeff Dean.</p>
<p>It started with this belief, the proprietary machine learning</p>
<p>library, and turned into TensorFlow in 2014,</p>
<p>the open source library.</p>
<p>So what were the early days of Google Brain like?</p>
<p>What were the goals, the missions?</p>
<p>How do you even proceed forward once there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much possibilities before you?</p>
<p>It was interesting back then when I started,</p>
<p>or when you were even just talking about it,</p>
<p>the idea of deep learning was interesting and intriguing</p>
<p>in some ways.</p>
<p>It hadn&rsquo;t yet taken off, but it held some promise.</p>
<p>It had shown some very promising and early results.</p>
<p>I think the idea where Andrew and Jeff had started</p>
<p>was, what if we can take this work people are doing</p>
<p>in research and scale it to what Google has</p>
<p>in terms of the compute power, and also</p>
<p>put that kind of data together?</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>And so far, the results had been, if you scale the compute,</p>
<p>scale the data, it does better.</p>
<p>And would that work?</p>
<p>And so that was the first year or two, can we prove that out?</p>
<p>And with this belief, when we started the first year,</p>
<p>we got some early wins, which is always great.</p>
<p>What were the wins like?</p>
<p>What was the wins where you were,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some problems to this, this is going to be good?</p>
<p>I think there are two early wins where one was speech,</p>
<p>that we collaborated very closely with the speech research</p>
<p>team, who was also getting interested in this.</p>
<p>And the other one was on images, where the cat paper,</p>
<p>as we call it, that was covered by a lot of folks.</p>
<p>And the birth of Google Brain was around neural networks.</p>
<p>So it was deep learning from the very beginning.</p>
<p>That was the whole mission.</p>
<p>So what would, in terms of scale,</p>
<p>what was the sort of dream of what this could become?</p>
<p>Were there echoes of this open source TensorFlow community</p>
<p>that might be brought in?</p>
<p>Was there a sense of TPUs?</p>
<p>Was there a sense of machine learning is now going to be</p>
<p>at the core of the entire company,</p>
<p>is going to grow into that direction?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, so that was interesting.</p>
<p>And if I think back to 2012 or 2011,</p>
<p>and first was can we scale it in the year or so,</p>
<p>we had started scaling it to hundreds and thousands</p>
<p>of machines.</p>
<p>In fact, we had some runs even going to 10,000 machines.</p>
<p>And all of those shows great promise.</p>
<p>In terms of machine learning at Google,</p>
<p>the good thing was Google&rsquo;s been doing machine learning</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>Deep learning was new, but as we scaled this up,</p>
<p>we showed that, yes, that was possible.</p>
<p>And it was going to impact lots of things.</p>
<p>Like we started seeing real products wanting to use this.</p>
<p>Again, speech was the first, there were image things</p>
<p>that photos came out of and then many other products as well.</p>
<p>So that was exciting.</p>
<p>As we went into that a couple of years,</p>
<p>externally also academia started to,</p>
<p>there was lots of push on, okay,</p>
<p>deep learning is interesting,</p>
<p>we should be doing more and so on.</p>
<p>And so by 2014, we were looking at, okay,</p>
<p>this is a big thing, it&rsquo;s going to grow.</p>
<p>And not just internally, externally as well.</p>
<p>Yes, maybe Google&rsquo;s ahead of where everybody is,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot to do.</p>
<p>So a lot of this started to make sense and come together.</p>
<p>So the decision to open source,</p>
<p>I was just chatting with Chris Glatner about this.</p>
<p>The decision to go open source with TensorFlow,</p>
<p>I would say sort of for me personally,</p>
<p>seems to be one of the big seminal moments</p>
<p>in all of software engineering ever.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s when a large company like Google</p>
<p>decides to take a large project that many lawyers</p>
<p>might argue has a lot of IP,</p>
<p>just decide to go open source with it,</p>
<p>and in so doing lead the entire world</p>
<p>and saying, you know what, open innovation</p>
<p>is a pretty powerful thing, and it&rsquo;s okay to do.</p>
<p>That was, I mean, that&rsquo;s an incredible moment in time.</p>
<p>So do you remember those discussions happening?</p>
<p>Whether open source should be happening?</p>
<p>What was that like?</p>
<p>I would say, I think, so the initial idea came from Jeff,</p>
<p>who was a big proponent of this.</p>
<p>I think it came off of two big things.</p>
<p>One was research wise, we were a research group.</p>
<p>We were putting all our research out there.</p>
<p>If you wanted to, we were building on others research</p>
<p>and we wanted to push the state of the art forward.</p>
<p>And part of that was to share the research.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I think deep learning and machine learning</p>
<p>has really grown so fast.</p>
<p>So the next step was, okay, now,</p>
<p>would software help with that?</p>
<p>And it seemed like they were existing</p>
<p>a few libraries out there, Tiano being one,</p>
<p>Torch being another, and a few others,</p>
<p>but they were all done by academia</p>
<p>and so the level was significantly different.</p>
<p>The other one was from a software perspective,</p>
<p>Google had done lots of software</p>
<p>or that we used internally, you know,</p>
<p>and we published papers.</p>
<p>Often there was an open source project</p>
<p>that came out of that that somebody else</p>
<p>picked up that paper and implemented</p>
<p>and they were very successful.</p>
<p>Back then it was like, okay, there&rsquo;s Hadoop,</p>
<p>which has come off of tech that we&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>We know the tech we&rsquo;ve built is way better</p>
<p>for a number of different reasons.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve invested a lot of effort in that.</p>
<p>And turns out we have Google Cloud</p>
<p>and we are now not really providing our tech,</p>
<p>but we are saying, okay, we have Bigtable,</p>
<p>which is the original thing.</p>
<p>We are going to now provide H base APIs</p>
<p>on top of that, which isn&rsquo;t as good,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what everybody&rsquo;s used to.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like, can we make something</p>
<p>that is better and really just provide,</p>
<p>helps the community in lots of ways,</p>
<p>but also helps push a good standard forward.</p>
<p>So how does Cloud fit into that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a TensorFlow open source library</p>
<p>and how does the fact that you can</p>
<p>use so many of the resources that Google provides</p>
<p>and the Cloud fit into that strategy?</p>
<p>So TensorFlow itself is open</p>
<p>and you can use it anywhere, right?</p>
<p>And we want to make sure that continues to be the case.</p>
<p>On Google Cloud, we do make sure</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s lots of integrations with everything else</p>
<p>and we want to make sure</p>
<p>that it works really, really well there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re leading the TensorFlow effort.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the history</p>
<p>and the timeline of TensorFlow project</p>
<p>in terms of major design decisions,</p>
<p>so like the open source decision,</p>
<p>but really what to include and not?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this incredible ecosystem</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to talk about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these parts,</p>
<p>but what if just some sample moments</p>
<p>that defined what TensorFlow eventually became</p>
<p>through its, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re allowed to say history</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s just, but in deep learning,</p>
<p>everything moves so fast</p>
<p>and just a few years is already history.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, so looking back, we were building TensorFlow.</p>
<p>I guess we open sourced it in 2015, November 2015.</p>
<p>We started on it in summer of 2014, I guess.</p>
<p>And somewhere like three to six, late 2014,</p>
<p>by then we had decided that, okay,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a high likelihood we&rsquo;ll open source it.</p>
<p>So we started thinking about that</p>
<p>and making sure we&rsquo;re heading down that path.</p>
<p>At that point, by that point,</p>
<p>we had seen a few, lots of different use cases at Google.</p>
<p>So there were things like, okay,</p>
<p>yes, you wanna run it at large scale in the data center.</p>
<p>Yes, we need to support different kind of hardware.</p>
<p>We had GPUs at that point.</p>
<p>We had our first GPU at that point</p>
<p>or was about to come out roughly around that time.</p>
<p>So the design sort of included those.</p>
<p>We had started to push on mobile.</p>
<p>So we were running models on mobile.</p>
<p>At that point, people were customizing code.</p>
<p>So we wanted to make sure TensorFlow</p>
<p>could support that as well.</p>
<p>So that sort of became part of that overall design.</p>
<p>When you say mobile,</p>
<p>you mean like a pretty complicated algorithms</p>
<p>running on the phone?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>So when you have a model that you deploy on the phone</p>
<p>and run it there, right?</p>
<p>So already at that time,</p>
<p>there was ideas of running machine learning on the phone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>We already had a couple of products</p>
<p>that were doing that by then.</p>
<p>And in those cases,</p>
<p>we had basically customized handcrafted code</p>
<p>or some internal libraries that we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>So I was actually at Google during this time</p>
<p>in a parallel, I guess, universe,</p>
<p>but we were using Theano and Caffe.</p>
<p>Was there some degree to which you were bouncing,</p>
<p>like trying to see what Caffe was offering people,</p>
<p>trying to see what Theano was offering</p>
<p>that you want to make sure you&rsquo;re delivering</p>
<p>on whatever that is?</p>
<p>Perhaps the Python part of thing,</p>
<p>maybe did that influence any design decisions?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So when we built this belief</p>
<p>and some of that was in parallel</p>
<p>with some of these libraries coming up,</p>
<p>I mean, Theano itself is older,</p>
<p>but we were building this belief</p>
<p>focused on our internal thing</p>
<p>because our systems were very different.</p>
<p>By the time we got to this,</p>
<p>we looked at a number of libraries that were out there.</p>
<p>Theano, there were folks in the group</p>
<p>who had experience with Torch, with Lua.</p>
<p>There were folks here who had seen Caffe.</p>
<p>I mean, actually, Yang Jing was here as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s what other libraries?</p>
<p>I think we looked at a number of things.</p>
<p>Might even have looked at JNR back then.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember if it was there.</p>
<p>In fact, yeah, we did discuss ideas around,</p>
<p>okay, should we have a graph or not?</p>
<p>So putting all these together was definitely,</p>
<p>they were key decisions that we wanted.</p>
<p>We had seen limitations in our prior disbelief things.</p>
<p>A few of them were just in terms of research</p>
<p>was moving so fast, we wanted the flexibility.</p>
<p>The hardware was changing fast.</p>
<p>We expected to change that</p>
<p>so that those probably were two things.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think the flexibility</p>
<p>in terms of being able to express</p>
<p>all kinds of crazy things was definitely a big one then.</p>
<p>So what, the graph decisions though,</p>
<p>with moving towards TensorFlow 2.0,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more, by default, there&rsquo;ll be eager execution.</p>
<p>So sort of hiding the graph a little bit</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s less intuitive</p>
<p>in terms of the way people develop and so on.</p>
<p>What was that discussion like in terms of using graphs?</p>
<p>It seemed, it&rsquo;s kind of the Theano way.</p>
<p>Did it seem the obvious choice?</p>
<p>So I think where it came from was our disbelief</p>
<p>had a graph like thing as well.</p>
<p>A much more simple, it wasn&rsquo;t a general graph,</p>
<p>it was more like a straight line thing.</p>
<p>More like what you might think of cafe,</p>
<p>I guess in that sense.</p>
<p>But the graph was,</p>
<p>and we always cared about the production stuff.</p>
<p>Like even with disbelief,</p>
<p>we were deploying a whole bunch of stuff in production.</p>
<p>So graph did come from that when we thought of,</p>
<p>okay, should we do that in Python?</p>
<p>And we experimented with some ideas</p>
<p>where it looked a lot simpler to use,</p>
<p>but not having a graph meant,</p>
<p>okay, how do you deploy now?</p>
<p>So that was probably what tilted the balance for us</p>
<p>and eventually we ended up with a graph.</p>
<p>And I guess the question there is, did you,</p>
<p>I mean, so production seems to be</p>
<p>the really good thing to focus on,</p>
<p>but did you even anticipate the other side of it</p>
<p>where there could be, what is it?</p>
<p>What are the numbers?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been crazy, 41 million downloads.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I mean, was that even like a possibility in your mind</p>
<p>that it would be as popular as it became?</p>
<p>So I think we did see a need for this</p>
<p>a lot from the research perspective</p>
<p>and like early days of deep learning in some ways.</p>
<p>41 million, no, I don&rsquo;t think I imagined this number.</p>
<p>Then it seemed like there&rsquo;s a potential future</p>
<p>where lots more people would be doing this</p>
<p>and how do we enable that?</p>
<p>I would say this kind of growth,</p>
<p>I probably started seeing somewhat after the open sourcing</p>
<p>where it was like, okay,</p>
<p>deep learning is actually growing way faster</p>
<p>for a lot of different reasons.</p>
<p>And we are in just the right place to push on that</p>
<p>and leverage that and deliver on lots of things</p>
<p>that people want.</p>
<p>So what changed once you open sourced?</p>
<p>Like how this incredible amount of attention</p>
<p>from a global population of developers,</p>
<p>how did the project start changing?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even actually remember during those times.</p>
<p>I know looking now, there&rsquo;s really good documentation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an ecosystem of tools,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a community, there&rsquo;s a blog,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a YouTube channel now, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very community driven.</p>
<p>Back then, I guess 0.1 version,</p>
<p>is that the version?</p>
<p>I think we call it 0.6 or five,</p>
<p>something like that, I forget.</p>
<p>What changed leading into 1.0?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve gone through a few things there.</p>
<p>When we started out, when we first came out,</p>
<p>people loved the documentation we have</p>
<p>because it was just a huge step up from everything else</p>
<p>because all of those were academic projects,</p>
<p>people doing, who don&rsquo;t think about documentation.</p>
<p>I think what that changed was,</p>
<p>instead of deep learning being a research thing,</p>
<p>some people who were just developers</p>
<p>could now suddenly take this out</p>
<p>and do some interesting things with it, right?</p>
<p>Who had no clue what machine learning was before then.</p>
<p>And that I think really changed</p>
<p>how things started to scale up in some ways</p>
<p>and pushed on it.</p>
<p>Over the next few months as we looked at</p>
<p>how do we stabilize things,</p>
<p>as we look at not just researchers,</p>
<p>now we want stability, people want to deploy things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we started planning for 1.0</p>
<p>and there are certain needs for that perspective.</p>
<p>And so again, documentation comes up,</p>
<p>designs, more kinds of things to put that together.</p>
<p>And so that was exciting to get that to a stage</p>
<p>where more and more enterprises wanted to buy in</p>
<p>and really get behind that.</p>
<p>And I think post 1.0 and over the next few releases,</p>
<p>that enterprise adoption also started to take off.</p>
<p>I would say between the initial release and 1.0,</p>
<p>it was, okay, researchers of course,</p>
<p>then a lot of hobbies and early interest,</p>
<p>people excited about this who started to get on board</p>
<p>and then over the 1.x thing, lots of enterprises.</p>
<p>I imagine anything that&rsquo;s below 1.0</p>
<p>gives pressure to be,</p>
<p>the enterprise probably wants something that&rsquo;s stable.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And do you have a sense now that TensorFlow is stable?</p>
<p>Like it feels like deep learning in general</p>
<p>is extremely dynamic field, so much is changing.</p>
<p>And TensorFlow has been growing incredibly.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of stability at the helm of it?</p>
<p>I mean, I know you&rsquo;re in the midst of it, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think in the midst of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often easy to forget what an enterprise wants</p>
<p>and what some of the people on that side want.</p>
<p>There are still people running models</p>
<p>that are three years old, four years old.</p>
<p>So Inception is still used by tons of people.</p>
<p>Even ResNet 50 is what, couple of years old now or more,</p>
<p>but there are tons of people who use that and they&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need the last couple of bits of performance</p>
<p>or quality, they want some stability</p>
<p>in things that just work.</p>
<p>And so there is value in providing that</p>
<p>with that kind of stability and making it really simpler</p>
<p>because that allows a lot more people to access it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the research crowd which wants,</p>
<p>okay, they wanna do these crazy things</p>
<p>exactly like you&rsquo;re saying, right?</p>
<p>Not just deep learning in the straight up models</p>
<p>that used to be there, they want RNNs</p>
<p>and even RNNs are maybe old, they are transformers now.</p>
<p>And now it needs to combine with RL and GANs and so on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely that area that like the boundary</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s shifting and pushing the state of the art.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s more and more of the past</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more stable and even stuff</p>
<p>that was two, three years old is very, very usable</p>
<p>by lots of people.</p>
<p>So that part makes it a lot easier.</p>
<p>So I imagine, maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>one of the biggest use cases is essentially</p>
<p>taking something like ResNet 50</p>
<p>and doing some kind of transfer learning</p>
<p>on a very particular problem that you have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically probably what majority of the world does.</p>
<p>And you wanna make that as easy as possible.</p>
<p>So I would say for the hobbyist perspective,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most common case, right?</p>
<p>In fact, the apps and phones and stuff that you&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>the early ones, that&rsquo;s the most common case.</p>
<p>I would say there are a couple of reasons for that.</p>
<p>One is that everybody talks about that.</p>
<p>It looks great on slides.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a presentation, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>What enterprises want is that is part of it,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the big thing.</p>
<p>Enterprises really have data</p>
<p>that they wanna make predictions on.</p>
<p>This is often what they used to do</p>
<p>with the people who were doing ML</p>
<p>was just regression models,</p>
<p>linear regression, logistic regression, linear models,</p>
<p>or maybe gradient booster trees and so on.</p>
<p>Some of them still benefit from deep learning,</p>
<p>but they want that&rsquo;s the bread and butter,</p>
<p>or like the structured data and so on.</p>
<p>So depending on the audience you look at,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a little bit different.</p>
<p>And they just have, I mean, the best of enterprise</p>
<p>probably just has a very large data set,</p>
<p>or deep learning can probably shine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And then I think the other pieces that they wanted,</p>
<p>again, with 2.0, the developer summit we put together</p>
<p>is the whole TensorFlow Extended piece,</p>
<p>which is the entire pipeline.</p>
<p>They care about stability across doing their entire thing.</p>
<p>They want simplicity across the entire thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to just train a model.</p>
<p>I need to do that every day again, over and over again.</p>
<p>I wonder to which degree you have a role in,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, so I teach a course on deep learning.</p>
<p>I have people like lawyers come up to me and say,</p>
<p>when is machine learning gonna enter legal,</p>
<p>the legal realm?</p>
<p>The same thing in all kinds of disciplines,</p>
<p>immigration, insurance, often when I see</p>
<p>what it boils down to is these companies</p>
<p>are often a little bit old school</p>
<p>in the way they organize the data.</p>
<p>So the data is just not ready yet, it&rsquo;s not digitized.</p>
<p>Do you also find yourself being in the role</p>
<p>of an evangelist for like, let&rsquo;s get,</p>
<p>organize your data, folks, and then you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>the big benefit of TensorFlow.</p>
<p>Do you get those, have those conversations?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you know, I get all kinds of questions there</p>
<p>from, okay, what do I need to make this work, right?</p>
<p>Do we really need deep learning?</p>
<p>I mean, there are all these things,</p>
<p>I already use this linear model, why would this help?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough data, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>or I wanna use machine learning,</p>
<p>but I have no clue where to start.</p>
<p>So it varies, that to all the way to the experts</p>
<p>to why support very specific things, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Is there a good answer?</p>
<p>It boils down to oftentimes digitizing data.</p>
<p>So whatever you want automated,</p>
<p>whatever data you want to make prediction based on,</p>
<p>you have to make sure that it&rsquo;s in an organized form.</p>
<p>Like within the TensorFlow ecosystem,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s now, you&rsquo;re providing more and more data sets</p>
<p>and more and more pre trained models.</p>
<p>Are you finding yourself also the organizer of data sets?</p>
<p>Yes, I think the TensorFlow data sets</p>
<p>that we just released, that&rsquo;s definitely come up</p>
<p>where people want these data sets,</p>
<p>can we organize them and can we make that easier?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s definitely one important thing.</p>
<p>The other related thing I would say is I often tell people,</p>
<p>you know what, don&rsquo;t think of the most fanciest thing</p>
<p>that the newest model that you see,</p>
<p>make something very basic work and then you can improve it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just lots of things you can do with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, start with the basics, true.</p>
<p>One of the big things that makes TensorFlow</p>
<p>even more accessible was the appearance</p>
<p>whenever that happened of Keras,</p>
<p>the Keras standard sort of outside of TensorFlow.</p>
<p>I think it was Keras on top of Tiano at first only</p>
<p>and then Keras became on top of TensorFlow.</p>
<p>Do you know when Keras chose to also add TensorFlow</p>
<p>as a backend, who was the,</p>
<p>was it just the community that drove that initially?</p>
<p>Do you know if there was discussions, conversations?</p>
<p>Yeah, so Francois started the Keras project</p>
<p>before he was at Google and the first thing was Tiano.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember if that was</p>
<p>after TensorFlow was created or way before.</p>
<p>And then at some point,</p>
<p>when TensorFlow started becoming popular,</p>
<p>there were enough similarities</p>
<p>that he decided to create this interface</p>
<p>and put TensorFlow as a backend.</p>
<p>I believe that might still have been</p>
<p>before he joined Google.</p>
<p>So we weren&rsquo;t really talking about that.</p>
<p>He decided on his own and thought that was interesting</p>
<p>and relevant to the community.</p>
<p>In fact, I didn&rsquo;t find out about him being at Google</p>
<p>until a few months after he was here.</p>
<p>He was working on some research ideas</p>
<p>and doing Keras on his nights and weekends project.</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t like part of the TensorFlow.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t join initially.</p>
<p>He joined research and he was doing some amazing research.</p>
<p>He has some papers on that and research,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s a great researcher as well.</p>
<p>And at some point we realized,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s doing this good stuff.</p>
<p>People seem to like the API and he&rsquo;s right here.</p>
<p>So we talked to him and he said,</p>
<p>okay, why don&rsquo;t I come over to your team</p>
<p>and work with you for a quarter</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s make that integration happen.</p>
<p>And we talked to his manager and he said,</p>
<p>sure, quarter&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And that quarter&rsquo;s been something like two years now.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s fully on this.</p>
<p>So Keras got integrated into TensorFlow in a deep way.</p>
<p>And now with 2.0, TensorFlow 2.0,</p>
<p>sort of Keras is kind of the recommended way</p>
<p>for a beginner to interact with TensorFlow.</p>
<p>Which makes that initial sort of transfer learning</p>
<p>or the basic use cases, even for an enterprise,</p>
<p>super simple, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So what was that decision like?</p>
<p>That seems like it&rsquo;s kind of a bold decision as well.</p>
<p>We did spend a lot of time thinking about that one.</p>
<p>We had a bunch of APIs, some built by us.</p>
<p>There was a parallel layers API that we were building.</p>
<p>And when we decided to do Keras in parallel,</p>
<p>so there were like, okay, two things that we are looking at.</p>
<p>And the first thing we was trying to do</p>
<p>is just have them look similar,</p>
<p>like be as integrated as possible,</p>
<p>share all of that stuff.</p>
<p>There were also like three other APIs</p>
<p>that others had built over time</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t have a standard one.</p>
<p>But one of the messages that we kept hearing</p>
<p>from the community, okay, which one do we use?</p>
<p>And they kept seeing like, okay,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a model in this one and here&rsquo;s a model in this one,</p>
<p>which should I pick?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of like, okay,</p>
<p>we had to address that straight on with 2.0.</p>
<p>The whole idea was we need to simplify.</p>
<p>We had to pick one.</p>
<p>Based on where we were, we were like,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s see what are the people like?</p>
<p>And Keras was clearly one that lots of people loved.</p>
<p>There were lots of great things about it.</p>
<p>So we settled on that.</p>
<p>Organically, that&rsquo;s kind of the best way to do it.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>It was surprising, nevertheless,</p>
<p>to sort of bring in an outside.</p>
<p>I mean, there was a feeling like Keras</p>
<p>might be almost like a competitor</p>
<p>in a certain kind of, to TensorFlow.</p>
<p>And in a sense, it became an empowering element</p>
<p>of TensorFlow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting how you can put two things together,</p>
<p>which can align.</p>
<p>In this case, I think Francois, the team,</p>
<p>and a bunch of us have chatted,</p>
<p>and I think we all want to see the same kind of things.</p>
<p>We all care about making it easier</p>
<p>for the huge set of developers out there,</p>
<p>and that makes a difference.</p>
<p>So Python has Guido van Rossum,</p>
<p>who until recently held the position</p>
<p>of benevolent dictator for life.</p>
<p>All right, so there&rsquo;s a huge successful open source project</p>
<p>like TensorFlow need one person who makes a final decision.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve did a pretty successful TensorFlow Dev Summit</p>
<p>just now, last couple of days.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clearly a lot of different new features</p>
<p>being incorporated, an amazing ecosystem, so on.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s, how are those design decisions made?</p>
<p>Is there a BDFL in TensorFlow,</p>
<p>or is it more distributed and organic?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s somewhat different, I would say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been involved in the key design directions,</p>
<p>but there are lots of things that are distributed</p>
<p>where there are a number of people, Martin Wick being one,</p>
<p>who has really driven a lot of our open source stuff,</p>
<p>a lot of the APIs,</p>
<p>and there are a number of other people who&rsquo;ve been,</p>
<p>you know, pushed and been responsible</p>
<p>for different parts of it.</p>
<p>We do have regular design reviews.</p>
<p>Over the last year, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve really spent a lot of time opening up to the community</p>
<p>and adding transparency.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re setting more processes in place,</p>
<p>so RFCs, special interest groups,</p>
<p>to really grow that community and scale that.</p>
<p>I think the kind of scale that ecosystem is in,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we could scale with having me</p>
<p>as the lone point of decision maker.</p>
<p>I got it. So, yeah, the growth of that ecosystem,</p>
<p>maybe you can talk about it a little bit.</p>
<p>First of all, it started with Andrej Karpathy</p>
<p>when he first did ComNetJS.</p>
<p>The fact that you can train and you&rsquo;ll network</p>
<p>in the browser was, in JavaScript, was incredible.</p>
<p>So now TensorFlow.js is really making that</p>
<p>a serious, like a legit thing,</p>
<p>a way to operate, whether it&rsquo;s in the backend</p>
<p>or the front end.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the TensorFlow Extended, like you mentioned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s TensorFlow Lite for mobile.</p>
<p>And all of it, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really converging towards being able to</p>
<p>save models in the same kind of way.</p>
<p>You can move around, you can train on the desktop</p>
<p>and then move it to mobile and so on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that cohesiveness.</p>
<p>So can you maybe give me, whatever I missed,</p>
<p>a bigger overview of the mission of the ecosystem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to be built and where is it moving forward?</p>
<p>Yeah. So in short, the way I like to think of this is</p>
<p>our goals to enable machine learning.</p>
<p>And in a couple of ways, you know, one is</p>
<p>we have lots of exciting things going on in ML today.</p>
<p>We started with deep learning,</p>
<p>but we now support a bunch of other algorithms too.</p>
<p>So one is to, on the research side,</p>
<p>keep pushing on the state of the art.</p>
<p>Can we, you know, how do we enable researchers</p>
<p>to build the next amazing thing?</p>
<p>So BERT came out recently, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great that people are able to do new kinds of research.</p>
<p>And there are lots of amazing research</p>
<p>that happens across the world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one direction.</p>
<p>The other is how do you take that across</p>
<p>all the people outside who want to take that research</p>
<p>and do some great things with it</p>
<p>and integrate it to build real products,</p>
<p>to have a real impact on people.</p>
<p>And so if that&rsquo;s the other axes in some ways,</p>
<p>you know, at a high level, one way I think about it is</p>
<p>there are a crazy number of compute devices</p>
<p>across the world.</p>
<p>And we often used to think of ML and training</p>
<p>and all of this as, okay, something you do</p>
<p>either in the workstation or the data center or cloud.</p>
<p>But we see things running on the phones.</p>
<p>We see things running on really tiny chips.</p>
<p>I mean, we had some demos at the developer summit.</p>
<p>And so the way I think about this ecosystem is</p>
<p>how do we help get machine learning on every device</p>
<p>that has a compute capability?</p>
<p>And that continues to grow and so in some ways</p>
<p>this ecosystem is looked at, you know,</p>
<p>various aspects of that and grown over time</p>
<p>to cover more of those.</p>
<p>And we continue to push the boundaries.</p>
<p>In some areas we&rsquo;ve built more tooling</p>
<p>and things around that to help you.</p>
<p>I mean, the first tool we started was TensorBoard.</p>
<p>You wanted to learn just the training piece,</p>
<p>the effects or TensorFlow extended</p>
<p>to really do your entire ML pipelines.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, you know, care about all that production stuff,</p>
<p>but then going to the edge,</p>
<p>going to different kinds of things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just us now.</p>
<p>We are a place where there are lots of libraries</p>
<p>being built on top.</p>
<p>So there are some for research,</p>
<p>maybe things like TensorFlow agents</p>
<p>or TensorFlow probability that started as research things</p>
<p>or for researchers for focusing</p>
<p>on certain kinds of algorithms,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also being deployed</p>
<p>or used by, you know, production folks.</p>
<p>And some have come from within Google,</p>
<p>just teams across Google</p>
<p>who wanted to build these things.</p>
<p>Others have come from just the community</p>
<p>because there are different pieces</p>
<p>that different parts of the community care about.</p>
<p>And I see our goal as enabling even that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, we cannot and won&rsquo;t build every single thing.</p>
<p>That just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>But if we can enable others to build the things</p>
<p>that they care about, and there&rsquo;s a broader community</p>
<p>that cares about that, and we can help encourage that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>That really helps the entire ecosystem, not just those.</p>
<p>One of the big things about 2.0 that we&rsquo;re pushing on is,</p>
<p>okay, we have these so many different pieces, right?</p>
<p>How do we help make all of them work well together?</p>
<p>So there are a few key pieces there that we&rsquo;re pushing on,</p>
<p>one being the core format in there</p>
<p>and how we share the models themselves</p>
<p>through save model and TensorFlow hub and so on.</p>
<p>And a few of the pieces that we really put this together.</p>
<p>I was very skeptical that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, when TensorFlow.js came out,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t seem, or deep learning JS as it was earlier.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was the first.</p>
<p>It seems like technically very difficult project.</p>
<p>As a standalone, it&rsquo;s not as difficult,</p>
<p>but as a thing that integrates into the ecosystem,</p>
<p>it seems very difficult.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of aspects of this</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making look easy, but,</p>
<p>and the technical side,</p>
<p>how many challenges have to be overcome here?</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>And still have to be overcome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question here too.</p>
<p>There are lots of steps to it, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve iterated over the last few years,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a lot we&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>I, yeah, and often when things come together well,</p>
<p>things look easy and that&rsquo;s exactly the point.</p>
<p>It should be easy for the end user,</p>
<p>but there are lots of things that go behind that.</p>
<p>If I think about still challenges ahead,</p>
<p>there are,</p>
<p>you know, we have a lot more devices coming on board,</p>
<p>for example, from the hardware perspective.</p>
<p>How do we make it really easy for these vendors</p>
<p>to integrate with something like TensorFlow, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of compiler stuff</p>
<p>that others are working on.</p>
<p>There are things we can do in terms of our APIs</p>
<p>and so on that we can do.</p>
<p>As we, you know,</p>
<p>TensorFlow started as a very monolithic system</p>
<p>and to some extent it still is.</p>
<p>There are less, lots of tools around it,</p>
<p>but the core is still pretty large and monolithic.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges for us to scale that out</p>
<p>is how do we break that apart with clearer interfaces?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, in some ways it&rsquo;s software engineering 101,</p>
<p>but for a system that&rsquo;s now four years old, I guess,</p>
<p>or more, and that&rsquo;s still rapidly evolving</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re not slowing down with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to change and modify and really break apart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like, as people say, right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like changing the engine with a car running</p>
<p>or trying to fix that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a challenge here</p>
<p>because the downside of so many people</p>
<p>being excited about TensorFlow</p>
<p>and coming to rely on it in many of their applications</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re kind of responsible,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s the technical debt.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responsible for previous versions</p>
<p>to some degree still working.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re trying to innovate,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s probably easier</p>
<p>to just start from scratch every few months.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So do you feel the pain of that?</p>
<p>2.0 does break some back compatibility,</p>
<p>but not too much.</p>
<p>It seems like the conversion is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s still important</p>
<p>given how quickly deep learning is changing?</p>
<p>Can you just, the things that you&rsquo;ve learned,</p>
<p>can you just start over or is there pressure to not?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky balance.</p>
<p>So if it was just a researcher writing a paper</p>
<p>who a year later will not look at that code again,</p>
<p>sure, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>There are a lot of production systems</p>
<p>that rely on TensorFlow,</p>
<p>both at Google and across the world.</p>
<p>And people worry about this.</p>
<p>I mean, these systems run for a long time.</p>
<p>So it is important to keep that compatibility and so on.</p>
<p>And yes, it does come with a huge cost.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, we have to think about a lot of things</p>
<p>as we do new things and make new changes.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a trade off, right?</p>
<p>You can, you might slow certain kinds of things down,</p>
<p>but the overall value you&rsquo;re bringing</p>
<p>because of that is much bigger</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just about breaking the person yesterday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about telling the person tomorrow</p>
<p>that, you know what, this is how we do things.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna break you when you come on board</p>
<p>because there are lots of new people</p>
<p>who are also gonna come on board.</p>
<p>And, you know, one way I like to think about this,</p>
<p>and I always push the team to think about it as well,</p>
<p>when you wanna do new things,</p>
<p>you wanna start with a clean slate.</p>
<p>Design with a clean slate in mind,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll figure out</p>
<p>how to make sure all the other things work.</p>
<p>And yes, we do make compromises occasionally,</p>
<p>but unless you design with the clean slate</p>
<p>and not worry about that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never get to a good place.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s brilliant, so even if you are responsible</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the idea stage,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking of new,</p>
<p>just put all that behind you.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s really, really well put.</p>
<p>So I have to ask this</p>
<p>because a lot of students, developers ask me</p>
<p>how I feel about PyTorch versus TensorFlow.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve recently completely switched</p>
<p>my research group to TensorFlow.</p>
<p>I wish everybody would just use the same thing,</p>
<p>and TensorFlow is as close to that, I believe, as we have.</p>
<p>But do you enjoy competition?</p>
<p>So TensorFlow is leading in many ways,</p>
<p>on many dimensions in terms of ecosystem,</p>
<p>in terms of number of users,</p>
<p>momentum, power, production levels, so on,</p>
<p>but a lot of researchers are now also using PyTorch.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy that kind of competition</p>
<p>or do you just ignore it</p>
<p>and focus on making TensorFlow the best that it can be?</p>
<p>So just like research or anything people are doing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great to get different kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>And when we started with TensorFlow,</p>
<p>like I was saying earlier,</p>
<p>one, it was very important</p>
<p>for us to also have production in mind.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t want just research, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we chose certain things.</p>
<p>Now PyTorch came along and said,</p>
<p>you know what, I only care about research.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m trying to do.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best thing I can do for this?</p>
<p>And it started iterating and said,</p>
<p>okay, I don&rsquo;t need to worry about graphs.</p>
<p>Let me just run things.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s not as fast as it can be,</p>
<p>but let me just make this part easy.</p>
<p>And there are things you can learn from that, right?</p>
<p>They, again, had the benefit of seeing what had come before,</p>
<p>but also exploring certain different kinds of spaces.</p>
<p>And they had some good things there,</p>
<p>building on say things like JNR and so on before that.</p>
<p>So competition is definitely interesting.</p>
<p>It made us, you know,</p>
<p>this is an area that we had thought about,</p>
<p>like I said, way early on.</p>
<p>Over time we had revisited this a couple of times,</p>
<p>should we add this again?</p>
<p>At some point we said, you know what,</p>
<p>it seems like this can be done well,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s try it again.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we started pushing on eager execution.</p>
<p>How do we combine those two together?</p>
<p>Which has finally come very well together in 2.0,</p>
<p>but it took us a while to get all the things together</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So let me ask, put another way,</p>
<p>I think eager execution is a really powerful thing</p>
<p>that was added.</p>
<p>Do you think it wouldn&rsquo;t have been,</p>
<p>you know, Muhammad Ali versus Frasier, right?</p>
<p>Do you think it wouldn&rsquo;t have been added as quickly</p>
<p>if PyTorch wasn&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p>It might have taken longer.</p>
<p>No longer?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was, I mean,</p>
<p>we had tried some variants of that before,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m sure it would have happened,</p>
<p>but it might have taken longer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful that TensorFlow is finally</p>
<p>in the way they did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s doing some incredible work last couple years.</p>
<p>What other things that we didn&rsquo;t talk about</p>
<p>are you looking forward in 2.0?</p>
<p>That comes to mind.</p>
<p>So we talked about some of the ecosystem stuff,</p>
<p>making it easily accessible to Keras,</p>
<p>eager execution.</p>
<p>Is there other things that we missed?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I would say one is just where 2.0 is,</p>
<p>and you know, with all the things that we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>I think as we think beyond that,</p>
<p>there are lots of other things that it enables us to do</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re excited about.</p>
<p>So what it&rsquo;s setting us up for,</p>
<p>okay, here are these really clean APIs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve cleaned up the surface for what the users want.</p>
<p>What it also allows us to do a whole bunch of stuff</p>
<p>behind the scenes once we are ready with 2.0.</p>
<p>So for example, in TensorFlow with graphs</p>
<p>and all the things you could do,</p>
<p>you could always get a lot of good performance</p>
<p>if you spent the time to tune it, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve clearly shown that, lots of people do that.</p>
<p>With 2.0, with these APIs, where we are,</p>
<p>we can give you a lot of performance</p>
<p>just with whatever you do.</p>
<p>You know, because we see these, it&rsquo;s much cleaner.</p>
<p>We know most people are gonna do things this way.</p>
<p>We can really optimize for that</p>
<p>and get a lot of those things out of the box.</p>
<p>And it really allows us, you know,</p>
<p>both for single machine and distributed and so on,</p>
<p>to really explore other spaces behind the scenes</p>
<p>after 2.0 in the future versions as well.</p>
<p>So right now the team&rsquo;s really excited about that,</p>
<p>that over time I think we&rsquo;ll see that.</p>
<p>The other piece that I was talking about</p>
<p>in terms of just restructuring the monolithic thing</p>
<p>into more pieces and making it more modular,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s gonna be really important</p>
<p>for a lot of the other people in the ecosystem,</p>
<p>other organizations and so on that wanted to build things.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate a little bit what you mean</p>
<p>by making TensorFlow ecosystem more modular?</p>
<p>So the way it&rsquo;s organized today is there&rsquo;s one,</p>
<p>there are lots of repositories</p>
<p>in the TensorFlow organization at GitHub.</p>
<p>The core one where we have TensorFlow,</p>
<p>it has the execution engine,</p>
<p>it has the key backends for CPUs and GPUs,</p>
<p>it has the work to do distributed stuff.</p>
<p>And all of these just work together</p>
<p>in a single library or binary.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to split them apart easily.</p>
<p>I mean, there are some interfaces,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not very clean.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, you would have clean interfaces where,</p>
<p>okay, I wanna run it on my fancy cluster</p>
<p>with some custom networking,</p>
<p>just implement this and do that.</p>
<p>I mean, we kind of support that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard for people today.</p>
<p>I think as we are starting to see more interesting things</p>
<p>in some of these spaces,</p>
<p>having that clean separation will really start to help.</p>
<p>And again, going to the large size of the ecosystem</p>
<p>and the different groups involved there,</p>
<p>enabling people to evolve</p>
<p>and push on things more independently</p>
<p>just allows it to scale better.</p>
<p>And by people, you mean individual developers and?</p>
<p>And organizations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So the hope is that everybody sort of major,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Pepsi or something uses,</p>
<p>like major corporations go to TensorFlow to this kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you look at enterprises like Pepsi or these,</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of them are already using TensorFlow.</p>
<p>They are not the ones that do the development</p>
<p>or changes in the core.</p>
<p>Some of them do, but a lot of them don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, they touch small pieces.</p>
<p>There are lots of these,</p>
<p>some of them being, let&rsquo;s say, hardware vendors</p>
<p>who are building their custom hardware</p>
<p>and they want their own pieces.</p>
<p>Or some of them being bigger companies, say, IBM.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re involved in some of our</p>
<p>special interest groups,</p>
<p>and they see a lot of users</p>
<p>who want certain things and they want to optimize for that.</p>
<p>So folks like that often.</p>
<p>Autonomous vehicle companies, perhaps.</p>
<p>Exactly, yes.</p>
<p>So, yeah, like I mentioned,</p>
<p>TensorFlow has been downloaded 41 million times,</p>
<p>50,000 commits, almost 10,000 pull requests,</p>
<p>and 1,800 contributors.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure if you can explain it,</p>
<p>but what does it take to build a community like that?</p>
<p>In retrospect, what do you think,</p>
<p>what is the critical thing that allowed</p>
<p>for this growth to happen,</p>
<p>and how does that growth continue?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I wish I had all the answers there, I guess,</p>
<p>so you could replicate it.</p>
<p>I think there are a number of things</p>
<p>that need to come together, right?</p>
<p>One, just like any new thing,</p>
<p>it is about, there&rsquo;s a sweet spot of timing,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s needed, does it grow with,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s needed, so in this case, for example,</p>
<p>TensorFlow&rsquo;s not just grown because it was a good tool,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also grown with the growth of deep learning itself.</p>
<p>So those factors come into play.</p>
<p>Other than that, though,</p>
<p>I think just hearing, listening to the community,</p>
<p>what they do, what they need,</p>
<p>being open to, like in terms of external contributions,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time in making sure</p>
<p>we can accept those contributions well,</p>
<p>we can help the contributors in adding those,</p>
<p>putting the right process in place,</p>
<p>getting the right kind of community,</p>
<p>welcoming them and so on.</p>
<p>Like over the last year, we&rsquo;ve really pushed on transparency,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important for an open source project.</p>
<p>People wanna know where things are going,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like, okay, here&rsquo;s a process</p>
<p>where you can do that, here are our RFCs and so on.</p>
<p>So thinking through, there are lots of community aspects</p>
<p>that come into that you can really work on.</p>
<p>As a small project, it&rsquo;s maybe easy to do</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like two developers and you can do those.</p>
<p>As you grow, putting more of these processes in place,</p>
<p>thinking about the documentation,</p>
<p>thinking about what two developers care about,</p>
<p>what kind of tools would they want to use,</p>
<p>all of these come into play, I think.</p>
<p>So one of the big things I think</p>
<p>that feeds the TensorFlow fire</p>
<p>is people building something on TensorFlow,</p>
<p>and implement a particular architecture</p>
<p>that does something cool and useful,</p>
<p>and they put that on GitHub.</p>
<p>And so it just feeds this growth.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense that with 2.0 and 1.0</p>
<p>that there may be a little bit of a partitioning</p>
<p>like there is with Python 2 and 3,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;ll be a code base</p>
<p>and in the older versions of TensorFlow,</p>
<p>they will not be as compatible easily?</p>
<p>Or are you pretty confident that this kind of conversion</p>
<p>is pretty natural and easy to do?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re definitely working hard</p>
<p>to make that very easy to do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of tooling that we talked about</p>
<p>at the developer summit this week,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll continue to invest in that tooling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, when you think</p>
<p>of these significant version changes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always a risk,</p>
<p>and we are really pushing hard</p>
<p>to make that transition very, very smooth.</p>
<p>So I think, so at some level,</p>
<p>people wanna move and they see the value in the new thing.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t wanna move just because it&rsquo;s a new thing,</p>
<p>and some people do,</p>
<p>but most people want a really good thing.</p>
<p>And I think over the next few months,</p>
<p>as people start to see the value,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll definitely see that shift happening.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty excited and confident</p>
<p>that we will see people moving.</p>
<p>As you said earlier, this field is also moving rapidly,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;ll help because we can do more things</p>
<p>and all the new things will clearly happen in 2.x,</p>
<p>so people will have lots of good reasons to move.</p>
<p>So what do you think TensorFlow 3.0 looks like?</p>
<p>Is there, are things happening so crazily</p>
<p>that even at the end of this year</p>
<p>seems impossible to plan for?</p>
<p>Or is it possible to plan for the next five years?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>There are some things that we can expect</p>
<p>in terms of, okay, change, yes, change is gonna happen.</p>
<p>Are there some things gonna stick around</p>
<p>and some things not gonna stick around?</p>
<p>I would say the basics of deep learning,</p>
<p>the, you know, say convolution models</p>
<p>or the basic kind of things,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll probably be around in some form still in five years.</p>
<p>Will RL and GAN stay?</p>
<p>Very likely, based on where they are.</p>
<p>Will we have new things?</p>
<p>Probably, but those are hard to predict.</p>
<p>And some directionally, some things that we can see is,</p>
<p>you know, in things that we&rsquo;re starting to do, right,</p>
<p>with some of our projects right now</p>
<p>is just 2.0 combining eager execution and graphs</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re starting to make it more like</p>
<p>just your natural programming language.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to program something else.</p>
<p>Similarly, with Swift for TensorFlow,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re taking that approach.</p>
<p>Can you do something ground up, right?</p>
<p>So some of those ideas seem like, okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the right direction.</p>
<p>In five years, we expect to see more in that area.</p>
<p>Other things we don&rsquo;t know is,</p>
<p>will hardware accelerators be the same?</p>
<p>Will we be able to train with four bits</p>
<p>instead of 32 bits?</p>
<p>And I think the TPU side of things is exploring that.</p>
<p>I mean, TPU is already on version three.</p>
<p>It seems that the evolution of TPU and TensorFlow</p>
<p>are sort of, they&rsquo;re coevolving almost in terms of</p>
<p>both are learning from each other and from the community</p>
<p>and from the applications</p>
<p>where the biggest benefit is achieved.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been trying to sort of, with Eager, with Keras,</p>
<p>to make TensorFlow as accessible</p>
<p>and easy to use as possible.</p>
<p>What do you think, for beginners,</p>
<p>is the biggest thing they struggle with?</p>
<p>Have you encountered that?</p>
<p>Or is basically what Keras is solving is that Eager,</p>
<p>like we talked about?</p>
<p>Yeah, for some of them, like you said, right,</p>
<p>the beginners want to just be able to take</p>
<p>some image model,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s Inception or ResNet</p>
<p>or something else,</p>
<p>and do some training or transfer learning</p>
<p>on their kind of model.</p>
<p>Being able to make that easy is important.</p>
<p>So in some ways,</p>
<p>if you do that by providing them simple models</p>
<p>with say, in hub or so on,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care about what&rsquo;s inside that box,</p>
<p>but they want to be able to use it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re pushing on, I think, different levels.</p>
<p>If you look at just a component that you get,</p>
<p>which has the layers already smooshed in,</p>
<p>the beginners probably just want that.</p>
<p>Then the next step is, okay,</p>
<p>look at building layers with Keras.</p>
<p>If you go out to research,</p>
<p>then they are probably writing custom layers themselves</p>
<p>or doing their own loops.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole spectrum there.</p>
<p>And then providing the pre trained models</p>
<p>seems to really decrease the time from you trying to start.</p>
<p>You could basically in a Colab notebook</p>
<p>achieve what you need.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m basically answering my own question</p>
<p>because I think what TensorFlow delivered on recently</p>
<p>is trivial for beginners.</p>
<p>So I was just wondering if there was other pain points</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to ease,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure there would.</p>
<p>No, those are probably the big ones.</p>
<p>I see high schoolers doing a whole bunch of things now,</p>
<p>which is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both amazing and terrifying.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In a sense that when they grow up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some incredible ideas will be coming from them.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certainly a technical aspect to your work,</p>
<p>but you also have a management aspect to your role</p>
<p>with TensorFlow leading the project,</p>
<p>a large number of developers and people.</p>
<p>So what do you look for in a good team?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Google has been at the forefront of exploring</p>
<p>what it takes to build a good team</p>
<p>and TensorFlow is one of the most cutting edge technologies</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>So in this context, what do you think makes for a good team?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely something I think a favorite about.</p>
<p>I think in terms of the team being able</p>
<p>to deliver something well,</p>
<p>one of the things that&rsquo;s important is a cohesion</p>
<p>across the team.</p>
<p>So being able to execute together in doing things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an end, like at this scale,</p>
<p>an individual engineer can only do so much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more that they can do together,</p>
<p>even though we have some amazing superstars across Google</p>
<p>and in the team, but there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>often the way I see it as the product</p>
<p>of what the team generates is way larger</p>
<p>than the whole or the individual put together.</p>
<p>And so how do we have all of them work together,</p>
<p>the culture of the team itself,</p>
<p>hiring good people is important.</p>
<p>But part of that is it&rsquo;s not just that,</p>
<p>okay, we hire a bunch of smart people</p>
<p>and throw them together and let them do things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also people have to care about what they&rsquo;re building,</p>
<p>people have to be motivated for the right kind of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s often an important factor.</p>
<p>And, you know, finally, how do you put that together</p>
<p>with a somewhat unified vision of where we wanna go?</p>
<p>So are we all looking in the same direction</p>
<p>or each of us going all over?</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s a mix.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s a very bottom up organization in some sense,</p>
<p>also research even more so, and that&rsquo;s how we started.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ve become this larger product and ecosystem,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also important to combine that well</p>
<p>with a mix of, okay, here&rsquo;s the direction we wanna go in.</p>
<p>There is exploration we&rsquo;ll do around that,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s keep staying in that direction,</p>
<p>not just all over the place.</p>
<p>And is there a way you monitor the health of the team?</p>
<p>Sort of like, is there a way you know you did a good job?</p>
<p>The team is good?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, you&rsquo;re sort of, you&rsquo;re saying nice things,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to determine how aligned.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not binary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s tensions and complexities and so on.</p>
<p>And the other element of the mission of superstars,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much, even at Google,</p>
<p>such a large percentage of work</p>
<p>is done by individual superstars too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, and sometimes those superstars</p>
<p>can be against the dynamic of a team and those tensions.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure in TensorFlow it might be</p>
<p>a little bit easier because the mission of the project</p>
<p>is so sort of beautiful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at the cutting edge, so it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>But have you had struggle with that?</p>
<p>Has there been challenges?</p>
<p>There are always people challenges</p>
<p>in different kinds of ways.</p>
<p>That said, I think we&rsquo;ve been what&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>about getting people who care and are, you know,</p>
<p>have the same kind of culture,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s Google in general to a large extent.</p>
<p>But also, like you said, given that the project</p>
<p>has had so many exciting things to do,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been room for lots of people</p>
<p>to do different kinds of things and grow,</p>
<p>which does make the problem a bit easier, I guess.</p>
<p>And it allows people, depending on what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s room around them, then that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But yes, we do care about whether a superstar or not,</p>
<p>that they need to work well with the team across Google.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting to hear.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like superstar or not,</p>
<p>the productivity broadly is about the team.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, they might add a lot of value,</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;re hurting the team, then that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>So in hiring engineers, it&rsquo;s so interesting, right,</p>
<p>the hiring process.</p>
<p>What do you look for?</p>
<p>How do you determine a good developer</p>
<p>or a good member of a team</p>
<p>from just a few minutes or hours together?</p>
<p>Again, no magic answers, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Google has a hiring process</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve refined over the last 20 years, I guess,</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ve probably heard and seen a lot about.</p>
<p>So we do work with the same hiring process</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really helped.</p>
<p>For me in particular, I would say,</p>
<p>in addition to the core technical skills,</p>
<p>what does matter is their motivation</p>
<p>in what they wanna do.</p>
<p>Because if that doesn&rsquo;t align well</p>
<p>with where we wanna go,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna lead to long term success</p>
<p>for either them or the team.</p>
<p>And I think that becomes more important</p>
<p>the more senior the person is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important at every level.</p>
<p>Like even the junior most engineer,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not motivated to do well</p>
<p>at what they&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>however smart they are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be hard for them to succeed.</p>
<p>Does the Google hiring process touch on that passion?</p>
<p>So like trying to determine,</p>
<p>because I think as far as I understand,</p>
<p>maybe you can speak to it,</p>
<p>that the Google hiring process sort of helps</p>
<p>in the initial like determines the skill set there,</p>
<p>is your puzzle solving ability,</p>
<p>problem solving ability good?</p>
<p>But like, I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>but it seems that the determining</p>
<p>whether the person is like fire inside them,</p>
<p>that burns to do anything really,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just some cool stuff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it.</p>
<p>Is that something that ultimately ends up</p>
<p>when they have a conversation with you</p>
<p>or once it gets closer to the team?</p>
<p>So one of the things we do have as part of the process</p>
<p>is just a culture fit,</p>
<p>like part of the interview process itself,</p>
<p>in addition to just the technical skills</p>
<p>and each engineer or whoever the interviewer is,</p>
<p>is supposed to rate the person on the culture</p>
<p>and the culture fit with Google and so on.</p>
<p>So that is definitely part of the process.</p>
<p>Now, there are various kinds of projects</p>
<p>and different kinds of things.</p>
<p>So there might be variants</p>
<p>and of the kind of culture you want there and so on.</p>
<p>And yes, that does vary.</p>
<p>So for example,</p>
<p>TensorFlow has always been a fast moving project</p>
<p>and we want people who are comfortable with that.</p>
<p>But at the same time now, for example,</p>
<p>we are at a place where we are also very full fledged product</p>
<p>and we wanna make sure things that work</p>
<p>really, really work, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t cut corners all the time.</p>
<p>So balancing that out and finding the people</p>
<p>who are the right fit for those is important.</p>
<p>And I think those kinds of things do vary a bit</p>
<p>across projects and teams and product areas across Google.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll see some differences there</p>
<p>in the final checklist.</p>
<p>But a lot of the core culture,</p>
<p>it comes along with just the engineering excellence</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>What is the hardest part of your job?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take your pick, I guess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun, I would say, right?</p>
<p>Hard, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, lots of things at different times.</p>
<p>I think that does vary.</p>
<p>So let me clarify that difficult things are fun</p>
<p>when you solve them, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fun in that sense.</p>
<p>I think the key to a successful thing across the board</p>
<p>and in this case, it&rsquo;s a large ecosystem now,</p>
<p>but even a small product,</p>
<p>is striking that fine balance</p>
<p>across different aspects of it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s how fast do you go</p>
<p>versus how perfect it is.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s how do you involve this huge community?</p>
<p>Who do you involve or do you decide,</p>
<p>okay, now is not a good time to involve them</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not the right fit.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s saying no to certain kinds of things.</p>
<p>Those are often the hard decisions.</p>
<p>Some of them you make quickly</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have the time.</p>
<p>Some of them you get time to think about them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re always hard.</p>
<p>So both choices are pretty good, those decisions.</p>
<p>What about deadlines?</p>
<p>Is this, do you find TensorFlow,</p>
<p>to be driven by deadlines</p>
<p>to a degree that a product might?</p>
<p>Or is there still a balance to where it&rsquo;s less deadline?</p>
<p>You had the Dev Summit today</p>
<p>that came together incredibly.</p>
<p>Looked like there&rsquo;s a lot of moving pieces and so on.</p>
<p>So did that deadline make people rise to the occasion</p>
<p>releasing TensorFlow 2.0 alpha?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that was done last minute as well.</p>
<p>I mean, up to the last point.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>that you need to strike the good balance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some value that deadlines bring</p>
<p>that does bring a sense of urgency</p>
<p>to get the right things together.</p>
<p>Instead of getting the perfect thing out,</p>
<p>you need something that&rsquo;s good and works well.</p>
<p>And the team definitely did a great job</p>
<p>in putting that together.</p>
<p>So I was very amazed and excited</p>
<p>by everything how that came together.</p>
<p>That said, across the year,</p>
<p>we try not to put out official deadlines.</p>
<p>We focus on key things that are important,</p>
<p>figure out how much of it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And we are developing in the open,</p>
<p>both internally and externally,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s available to everybody.</p>
<p>So you can pick and look at where things are.</p>
<p>We do releases at a regular cadence.</p>
<p>So fine, if something doesn&rsquo;t necessarily end up</p>
<p>this month, it&rsquo;ll end up in the next release</p>
<p>in a month or two.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay, but we want to keep moving</p>
<p>as fast as we can in these different areas.</p>
<p>Because we can iterate and improve on things,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s okay to put things out</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t fully ready.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make sure it&rsquo;s clear that okay,</p>
<p>this is experimental, but it&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>if you want to try and give feedback.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very, very useful.</p>
<p>I think that quick cycle and quick iteration is important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we often focus on rather than</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a deadline where you get everything else.</p>
<p>Is 2.0, is there pressure to make that stable?</p>
<p>Or like, for example, WordPress 5.0 just came out</p>
<p>and there was no pressure to,</p>
<p>it was a lot of build updates delivered way too late,</p>
<p>but, and they said, okay, well,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna release a lot of updates</p>
<p>really quickly to improve it.</p>
<p>Do you see TensorFlow 2.0 in that same kind of way</p>
<p>or is there this pressure to once it hits 2.0,</p>
<p>once you get to the release candidate</p>
<p>and then you get to the final,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be the stable thing?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be stable in,</p>
<p>just like when NodeX was where every API that&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>is gonna remain in work.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t change things under the covers.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t add things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s still a lot more for us to do</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll continue to have more releases.</p>
<p>So in that sense, there&rsquo;s still,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be done in like two months</p>
<p>when we release this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can say, but is there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not external deadlines for TensorFlow 2.0,</p>
<p>but is there internal deadlines,</p>
<p>the artificial or otherwise,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to set for yourself</p>
<p>or is it whenever it&rsquo;s ready?</p>
<p>So we want it to be a great product, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big important piece for us.</p>
<p>TensorFlow&rsquo;s already out there.</p>
<p>We have 41 million downloads for 1.0 X.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like we have to have this.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like, a lot of the features</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve really polishing</p>
<p>and putting them together are there.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to rush that just because.</p>
<p>So in that sense, we wanna get it right</p>
<p>and really focus on that.</p>
<p>That said, we have said that we are looking</p>
<p>to get this out in the next few months,</p>
<p>in the next quarter.</p>
<p>And as far as possible,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll definitely try to make that happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, my favorite line was, spring is a relative concept.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Spoken like a true developer.</p>
<p>So something I&rsquo;m really interested in</p>
<p>and your previous line of work is,</p>
<p>before TensorFlow, you led a team at Google on search ads.</p>
<p>I think this is a very interesting topic</p>
<p>on every level, on a technical level,</p>
<p>because at their best, ads connect people</p>
<p>to the things they want and need.</p>
<p>So, and at their worst, they&rsquo;re just these things</p>
<p>that annoy the heck out of you</p>
<p>to the point of ruining the entire user experience</p>
<p>of whatever you&rsquo;re actually doing.</p>
<p>So they have a bad rep, I guess.</p>
<p>And on the other end, so that this connecting users</p>
<p>to the thing they need and want</p>
<p>is a beautiful opportunity for machine learning to shine.</p>
<p>Like huge amounts of data that&rsquo;s personalized</p>
<p>and you kind of map to the thing</p>
<p>they actually want won&rsquo;t get annoyed.</p>
<p>So what have you learned from this,</p>
<p>Google that&rsquo;s leading the world in this aspect,</p>
<p>what have you learned from that experience</p>
<p>and what do you think is the future of ads?</p>
<p>Take you back to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes, it&rsquo;s been a while,</p>
<p>but I totally agree with what you said.</p>
<p>I think the search ads, the way it was always looked at</p>
<p>and I believe it still is,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s an extension of what search is trying to do.</p>
<p>And the goal is to make the information</p>
<p>and make the world&rsquo;s information accessible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not just information,</p>
<p>but maybe products or other things that people care about.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really important for them to align</p>
<p>with what the users need.</p>
<p>And in search ads, there&rsquo;s a minimum quality level</p>
<p>before that ad would be shown.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an ad that hits that quality,</p>
<p>but it will not be shown even if we have it</p>
<p>and okay, maybe we lose some money there, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That is really, really important.</p>
<p>And I think that that is something I really liked</p>
<p>about being there.</p>
<p>Advertising is a key part.</p>
<p>I mean, as a model, it&rsquo;s been around for ages, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a new model, it&rsquo;s been adapted to the web</p>
<p>and became a core part of search</p>
<p>and many other search engines across the world.</p>
<p>And I do hope, like you said,</p>
<p>there are aspects of ads that are annoying</p>
<p>and I go to a website and if it just keeps popping</p>
<p>an ad in my face not to let me read,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be annoying clearly.</p>
<p>So I hope we can strike that balance</p>
<p>between showing a good ad where it&rsquo;s valuable to the user</p>
<p>and provides the monetization to the service.</p>
<p>And this might be search, this might be a website,</p>
<p>all of these, they do need the monetization</p>
<p>for them to provide that service.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s done in a good balance between</p>
<p>showing just some random stuff that&rsquo;s distracting</p>
<p>versus showing something that&rsquo;s actually valuable.</p>
<p>So do you see it moving forward as to continue</p>
<p>being a model that funds businesses like Google,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a significant revenue stream?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s one of the most exciting things</p>
<p>but also limiting things in the internet</p>
<p>is nobody wants to pay for anything.</p>
<p>And advertisements, again, coupled at their best,</p>
<p>are actually really useful and not annoying.</p>
<p>Do you see that continuing and growing and improving</p>
<p>or is there, do you see sort of more Netflix type models</p>
<p>where you have to start to pay for content?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a mix.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna take a long while for everything</p>
<p>to be paid on the internet, if at all, probably not.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s always gonna be things</p>
<p>that are sort of monetized with things like ads.</p>
<p>But over the last few years, I would say</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve definitely seen that transition towards</p>
<p>more paid services across the web</p>
<p>and people are willing to pay for them</p>
<p>because they do see the value.</p>
<p>I mean, Netflix is a great example.</p>
<p>I mean, we have YouTube doing things.</p>
<p>People pay for the apps they buy.</p>
<p>More people I find are willing to pay for newspaper content</p>
<p>for the good news websites across the web.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the case a few years,</p>
<p>even a few years ago, I would say.</p>
<p>And I just see that change in myself as well</p>
<p>and just lots of people around me.</p>
<p>So definitely hopeful that we&rsquo;ll transition</p>
<p>to that mix model where maybe you get</p>
<p>to try something out for free, maybe with ads,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s a more clear revenue model</p>
<p>that sort of helps go beyond that.</p>
<p>So speaking of revenue, how is it that a person</p>
<p>can use the TPU in a Google call app for free?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the, I guess the question is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the future of TensorFlow in terms of empowering,</p>
<p>say, a class of 300 students?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m asked by MIT, what is going to be the future</p>
<p>of them being able to do their homework in TensorFlow?</p>
<p>Like, where are they going to train these networks, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that future look like with TPUs,</p>
<p>with cloud services, and so on?</p>
<p>I think a number of things there.</p>
<p>I mean, any TensorFlow open source,</p>
<p>you can run it wherever, you can run it on your desktop</p>
<p>and your desktops always keep getting more powerful,</p>
<p>so maybe you can do more.</p>
<p>My phone is like, I don&rsquo;t know how many times</p>
<p>more powerful than my first desktop.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably train it on your phone though,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Right, so in that sense, the power you have</p>
<p>in your hands is a lot more.</p>
<p>Clouds are actually very interesting from, say,</p>
<p>students or courses perspective,</p>
<p>because they make it very easy to get started.</p>
<p>I mean, Colab, the great thing about it is,</p>
<p>go to a website and it just works.</p>
<p>No installation needed, nothing to,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just there and things are working.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really the power of cloud as well.</p>
<p>And so I do expect that to grow.</p>
<p>Again, Colab is a free service.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to get started, to play with things,</p>
<p>to explore things.</p>
<p>That said, with free, you can only get so much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be, yeah.</p>
<p>So just like we were talking about,</p>
<p>free versus paid, yeah, there are services</p>
<p>you can pay for and get a lot more.</p>
<p>Great, so if I&rsquo;m a complete beginner</p>
<p>interested in machine learning and TensorFlow,</p>
<p>what should I do?</p>
<p>Probably start with going to our website</p>
<p>and playing there.</p>
<p>So just go to TensorFlow.org and start clicking on things.</p>
<p>Yep, check out tutorials and guides.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff you can just click there</p>
<p>and go to a Colab and do things.</p>
<p>No installation needed, you can get started right there.</p>
<p>Okay, awesome, Rajit, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex, it was great.</p>
