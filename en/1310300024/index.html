<p>What are your hopes and dreams? What do you hope to leave behind when you&rsquo;re gone?</p>
<p>These are big questions and you need the skills to talk about them</p>
<p>Listen in to get three grammar structures for using hope in English</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on Aubrey? What&rsquo;s shaking?</p>
<p>Oh, I have a question for you Lindsay. This is a good one. I can&rsquo;t wait to hear your answer. Ready?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;m ready. What do you hope will change about American culture in the next few years?</p>
<p>Well, usually when I get a question like this, it&rsquo;s about what I&rsquo;ve most recently thought about or consumed</p>
<p>So I just listened to an episode today of the daily about single-family homes and how expensive it is</p>
<p>How hard it is to buy a home now in the US right and how that&rsquo;s changed since the 50s the 60s the 70s</p>
<p>So I hope in our culture we find a way to make it again accessible for people average people like middle income people to own a home</p>
<p>Oh, I agree so much. I have friends that are in that mostly the children of my friends but are right there where they would love to buy a home</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely cannot get approved for the type of law. It&rsquo;s just so expensive for even small homes</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s crazy. We have a whole debate going on</p>
<p>We have this term NIMBY right that I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about this term then the not in my backyard crowd</p>
<p>The crowd that doesn&rsquo;t want more housing built. They don&rsquo;t want multifamily housing units built</p>
<p>And then we have the side where people want we need more supply where we don&rsquo;t have enough housing supply in our culture</p>
<p>But when we add more supply the value of all of our homes those of us who have bought homes obviously goes down</p>
<p>So I hope this issue gets resolved in our country and that&rsquo;s new for me this acronym NIMBY</p>
<p>It is glad you brought that up. Yes. I heard that before and I&rsquo;m all over the news these days</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t watch the news all that often</p>
<p>It makes me upset and I&rsquo;m so busy</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s all over like news commentary like podcast and the Wall Street Journal like yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>So guys follow this debate about housing in the US because honestly, we don&rsquo;t solve this we have big problems</p>
<p>So yeah, and so you guys noticed the question I asked Lindsay, I was asking her what she hopes will change</p>
<p>And we very recently got a very thoughtful question that we covered in a previous episode</p>
<p>1891 because the question was about want need and hope and we shared want a need the grammar we use lots of examples</p>
<p>So check out 1891 if you missed it, make sure to follow the podcast so you don&rsquo;t miss any of our amazing of course</p>
<p>But we promised a deep dive into hope because the grammar is a little different when you talk about what you hope for</p>
<p>Or what you hope to do. So today we&rsquo;re going to share that we&rsquo;re going to talk about hope</p>
<p>Yeah, and guys, this is a key connection skill with your your co-workers your colleagues your friends your neighbors</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s energizing to talk about the things that you hope for because it actually points to the next generation</p>
<p>Your relative your children their children, right? We can make some big statements here when we use the word hope</p>
<p>So we want by the time we finish today</p>
<p>We want you to be able to do that make some big exciting statements about what you hope for</p>
<p>Yes, or what you hope to accomplish because this is different from what you want to do or need to do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bigger it&rsquo;s a big about what you hope to do. It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s more overarching and I agree Lindsay</p>
<p>This is one of the best ways to get deeper with your connections in English with friends co-workers</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m excited for you guys to have this vocabulary so you can do that</p>
<p>Yeah, and I also think to live a better life guys. We have to live in this place. Not all the time</p>
<p>Right. We have things I things I have to do. I have to take the garbage out</p>
<p>Yes, but I should spend some time thinking about what I hope for in my life</p>
<p>And otherwise I could get to the end of my life and I haven&rsquo;t done those things that matter. Okay, actually</p>
<p>All right. So let&rsquo;s dive into the grammar here because this is a little tricky</p>
<p>There are three different grammar structures when we use the this verb hope</p>
<p>So first of all, of course, it&rsquo;s also a noun, right? I have hope right?</p>
<p>This is a sort of abstract idea, but we&rsquo;re talking about the verb to hope for something</p>
<p>So the first grammar structure is with an infinitive, right?</p>
<p>Yes, we say what I hope is and then you have to have an infinitive which in English is to and the verb</p>
<p>So like what I hope is to leave behind a legacy</p>
<p>Yeah, your infinitive is to leave and Aubrey to you when someone says that does that mean?</p>
<p>Leave behind money like in a state or does that mean leave behind an idea or leave behind something you&rsquo;ve built?</p>
<p>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it means you&rsquo;re more like your reputation like okay people think about you how they feel about you</p>
<p>What you have accomplished that is all your legacy. I don&rsquo;t think money</p>
<p>I think honestly I think about the movie or the play Hamilton because there&rsquo;s a big number where he talks about his legacy</p>
<p>And what is a legacy? What does it mean to leave behind a legacy?</p>
<p>Interesting really big deal for him and he wrote all of these essays</p>
<p>He has a big legacy, but also anyway long story short</p>
<p>His legacy is actually not very impressive because he died in a duel that was very foolish in my opinion</p>
<p>Anyway, so it is interesting to think about what&rsquo;s your legacy? What will you leave behind?</p>
<p>Oh, that is so this is a big I love these big questions or I ask yourself this guys when you finish today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>What do you want your legacy to be right? That&rsquo;s big</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another phrase. What I hope is to earn a million dollars and actually, you know a million dollars is not that much money these days, right?</p>
<p>We we talk about a mile in the US just to make sure that we keep ourselves in check here</p>
<p>But a lot of times when a typical American thinks about retirement</p>
<p>They think about reaching that that point of having a million dollars in the bank</p>
<p>And I think by the time we retire, it&rsquo;s not going to be a ton of money with inflation, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that much anymore? Not that much and imagine someone saying this sentence maybe not so much like what I hope to accomplish and I&rsquo;ll be all more like okay, I&rsquo;m starting this small business and maybe by the end of the year</p>
<p>What I hope is to earn a million dollars</p>
<p>Yes, it says when we use hope this way with an infinitive it is smaller that you know what I mean? We&rsquo;re not talking about big open schemes, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little smaller, right? Exactly</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a common benchmark right that people might say love it totally</p>
<p>Okay, is there another structure here Aubrey where we could use hope? What is it?</p>
<p>So the second one is where we say what I hope is that followed by subject verb</p>
<p>So for example, what I hope is that she will be kind, right?</p>
<p>So we have that whole chunk what I hope is that and that&rsquo;s always followed immediately by the subject and the verb</p>
<p>Yes, I love it. And then another example guys, make sure you&rsquo;re writing this down</p>
<p>Okay, what I hope is that everyone will get along what kind of context Aubrey would we say this in like when what kind of situation?</p>
<p>I think I just said this yesterday because I took my kids to another friend&rsquo;s house and she had all of her kids plus some cousins</p>
<p>So there were a whole bunch of kids new kids and I I&rsquo;m pretty sure I said what I hope is that everyone will get along</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come pick up my kids</p>
<p>You sound a little like concerned there like what I hope</p>
<p>Is that was there a troublemaker in the group that you were worried about?</p>
<p>My sweet little son Will is sometimes a troublemaker has ADHD and he&rsquo;s just sort of easily distracted and all over the place and full of energy very hyper</p>
<p>So sometimes he can be a little tough</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny. I love that</p>
<p>Okay, so we have a third way that we throw this in with some grammar. What is it Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes, the third grammar structure we use for hope the verb hope is what I hope for is and then that is immediately followed by a noun</p>
<p>For example, what I hope for is world peace</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, or what I hope for is to get this job</p>
<p>Right what I hope for is to get the it seems wordy for is to oh my gosh</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more natural just to say I hope I get this job</p>
<p>Yeah, right the what I hope for is very formal. Yeah, you are we don&rsquo;t speak this formally usually at work or with friends</p>
<p>This is the grammar, but we often will shorten it and just say ooh, hope I get this job</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it. You know when I think about this concept of hope I think of Obama&rsquo;s campaign</p>
<p>I think that Obama ran on just that was his slogan just hope or something, right? It was yeah</p>
<p>The big colorful posters and hope in giant block letters. Yes those posters so much so powerful</p>
<p>I remember just I think we all just cried when he got elected</p>
<p>I know I did that that you know the when he was first elected that was was that 2008?</p>
<p>I want to say yes 2008 because I had just moved to New York City or maybe 2010</p>
<p>I was in New York at the time too. Yeah, exactly</p>
<p>So such a powerful concept right when especially when you&rsquo;re speaking to different cultures who need to be represented</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate hope right? Yes, definitely</p>
<p>Right, and it was very related to voting because so many minorities weren&rsquo;t voting at the time because they felt like their voice wouldn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>Their one vote wouldn&rsquo;t matter. Yeah, Obama really got the message out that yes your vote matters your voice matters</p>
<p>And I think people really rallied. I think there were record turnouts at the polls. Absolutely. Absolutely good stuff</p>
<p>Okay, Aubrey&rsquo;s or anything else our listeners need to know about there&rsquo;s one other sort of chunk that we want to share</p>
<p>Which is all I hope for you&rsquo;re going to hear this. It&rsquo;s the exact same grammar structure for what I hope for</p>
<p>But the meaning is slightly different. It&rsquo;s bigger, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna say like all I hope for is to get this job. It&rsquo;s not big enough</p>
<p>You might say all I hope for is that my family knows I love them something big and overarching</p>
<p>Or all I hope for is equality, right? Yeah, I love that. Yeah</p>
<p>So I feel like what you know, these are things people might say at the end of their lives, right?</p>
<p>They might ask you to write that in their eulogy or something</p>
<p>You could definitely say right all I hope for is that I&rsquo;ve left a legacy</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;ve hoped for is my children will remember me, you know, in a positive light</p>
<p>Exactly. I love it. I love it. This is so important because we&rsquo;re giving our listeners</p>
<p>Guys, you now have the tools to talk about the big things in life that really matter</p>
<p>You know, what should we leave our listeners with today Aubrey?</p>
<p>Yes, I agree so much with what you said Lindsay that talking about what you hope to accomplish</p>
<p>And what you hope for is such a powerful way to build deep connections</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the grammar is tricky. So I&rsquo;m glad we were able to share these grammar structures</p>
<p>So you can break it down and make sure that you&rsquo;re as much as possible trying to, you know, say it with proper grammar</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t let the grammar worrying about this keep you from having these conversations</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay if you make little mistakes here and there</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really important is that you do talk about this with people in English</p>
<p>People that matter. Yeah, exactly. So do you do any vision boarding, Aubrey?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. I know you and I have talked about this. You do. I really should though</p>
<p>I feel like it would be very helpful for me</p>
<p>They work. I&rsquo;m telling you. It&rsquo;s so magical. They somehow they work</p>
<p>Especially if you put your vision board right in front of you where you see it every day in your office</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about that. I don&rsquo;t know if I believe in manifesting in those words</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s kind of strange, but there is something about knowing what you want in your life</p>
<p>Saying what you hope for putting it on paper</p>
<p>It does end up eventually happening because you create the conditions</p>
<p>I do think I manifested something recently. I&rsquo;ll just share very quickly</p>
<p>I was wanting to try stand-up comedy and I just went to an open mic stand-up show</p>
<p>But what I did was I created a little fake poster that was like me as the headliner</p>
<p>With the time for just this open mic show</p>
<p>And I sent it to all my friends to sort of invite them</p>
<p>And it looked like a real comedy show with me headlining just to be funny</p>
<p>And then I went into the open mic. Lots of friends came. It was fun</p>
<p>And at the end, a lady who books for real comedy shows booked me for like a paid comedy gig</p>
<p>So by making that fake poster, I manifested that happening</p>
<p>There is something to that. There is something to that, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re spending that brain energy thinking about it happening, imagining it</p>
<p>And then you set up the conditions, you get the people around you and it does happen</p>
<p>And it did make me work harder, right? I like put way more effort into it because of this joke</p>
<p>Where I was like, oh, this is going to be a legit comedy show</p>
<p>There is something to that. You set the bar higher for yourself and then you put in more effort</p>
<p>I love it. So that was kind of your vision board, right?</p>
<p>That was sort of your vision board. So good, so good</p>
<p>So guys, what&rsquo;s on your vision board, right?</p>
<p>Have this thought as you finish today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>What are you envisioning for your future?</p>
<p>What do you hope for? So good</p>
<p>Love that. I&rsquo;m going to go think about that right now</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. Awesome, guys</p>
<p>And let us know on social media. This will be on YouTube</p>
<p>Come and comment on YouTube</p>
<p>Let us know what is your vision? What do you hope for?</p>
<p>What do you hope to accomplish?</p>
<p>Because we want to hear it</p>
<p>Love it. So good, Aubrey. I&rsquo;ll see you in the next one</p>
<p>Take care. Bye</p>
