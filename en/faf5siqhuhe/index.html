<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>Ôªøwelcome to the webinar everyone so in</p>
<p>this webinar we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>anti-aging I want to teach you so great</p>
<p>things if to actually reverse aging</p>
<p>process is it possible I think it is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with a lot of people</p>
<p>over the years and I found that they do</p>
<p>get younger as they get healthier so the</p>
<p>goal is to make you younger every year</p>
<p>that you age so that would be cool um so</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m gonna just go to some slides</p>
<p>right now um let me just share my screen</p>
<p>here make sure you can see everything ok</p>
<p>so so here&rsquo;s the thing when we talk</p>
<p>about anti-aging you know if you do</p>
<p>research on the internet you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>see there&rsquo;s a lot of information about</p>
<p>just skin creams taking vitamins looking</p>
<p>good on the outside using different</p>
<p>facial scrubs in that type of thing but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more to anti-aging than</p>
<p>just a superficial putting a cream on</p>
<p>your face try to get rid of wrinkles so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about two things one</p>
<p>is how to look youthful as you get older</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also going to talk about you</p>
<p>know the heart of anti aging which is to</p>
<p>postpone your life to prevent dying in</p>
<p>early age</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to talk about that because</p>
<p>it makes no sense to you know try to</p>
<p>look young why you get cancer and</p>
<p>dropped it a heart attack so I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to cover both things today and I wanted</p>
<p>to mention that one of the things that</p>
<p>really emphasized is to increase a</p>
<p>health reserve to build up kind of a</p>
<p>health insurance reserve and there is a</p>
<p>test that can be measured to look at the</p>
<p>internal health reserve and I have one</p>
<p>of my patients that we just today we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>evaluating we&rsquo;re looking at her health</p>
<p>reserve and trying to build that up and</p>
<p>I just want to kind of show you this</p>
<p>little graph here you can see there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this taller dial in a small dial</p>
<p>the tall dial should be straight up and</p>
<p>down and the small dial should be all</p>
<p>the way to the right so if the small</p>
<p>dial goes to the left that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>indication that the person is losing</p>
<p>their their kind of their recovery</p>
<p>Reserve and I look at that as kind of</p>
<p>like that the deeper health reserve this</p>
<p>test just to keep it really simple</p>
<p>without giving you a lot of big words is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called heart rate variability it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a test that measures the data in between</p>
<p>the heartbeats it measures how elastic</p>
<p>the heart is it measures how the</p>
<p>heartbeat varies from one beat to</p>
<p>another and it&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>indicators of overall mortality from</p>
<p>heart attacks so I don&rsquo;t use it for that</p>
<p>but it will give a prediction on how</p>
<p>healthy you are overall but also for the</p>
<p>heart the reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up is</p>
<p>because it probably taken 10,000 of</p>
<p>these graphs and there was only been one</p>
<p>person that has ever had a perfect graph</p>
<p>and he was 80 years old yeah and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like who is this guy he was walking down</p>
<p>the street with his dog he falls in a</p>
<p>hole hit knocks himself out he lays</p>
<p>there for three hours knocked out</p>
<p>unconscious wakes up his head&rsquo;s bleeding</p>
<p>goes back home he has a stiff neck he</p>
<p>sees me three days later his wounds are</p>
<p>almost healed um he has a slight</p>
<p>stiffness in his neck so he had a</p>
<p>perfect perfect graph and I&rsquo;m like who</p>
<p>the heck is this guy so apparently when</p>
<p>he was younger he took the Olympics in</p>
<p>water polo and he&rsquo;s maintained his</p>
<p>health</p>
<p>ever since that so he could basically</p>
<p>hold his breath three and a half minutes</p>
<p>underwater at this point so out of all</p>
<p>the things all the workouts all the</p>
<p>sports events I would say that water</p>
<p>polo is probably the most incredibly</p>
<p>difficult I almost drowned right up</p>
<p>through the sport in college with my</p>
<p>roommate was into water polo he would</p>
<p>just hold me underneath water until I</p>
<p>let go of the ball he would anchor his</p>
<p>foot into the drain pipe until I you</p>
<p>know cooperated so it&rsquo;s an intense</p>
<p>workout so in other words I&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>just let you know that it is</p>
<p>possible to measure your health reserve</p>
<p>and it is possible to improve it so let</p>
<p>me go to the next slide here so I think</p>
<p>we should probably start this whole</p>
<p>webinar by isolating what are the top</p>
<p>causes of death if you look it up this</p>
<p>is ill they&rsquo;ll go ahead and tell young</p>
<p>WebMD it&rsquo;s the heart disease cancer</p>
<p>chronic respiratory accident stroke</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s diabetes influenza pneumonia</p>
<p>nephritis that&rsquo;s kidney problems and</p>
<p>then suicide so those are the top causes</p>
<p>of death but they forgot to mention one</p>
<p>big cause of death and that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>the number one it is not probably it is</p>
<p>the number one cause of death and that</p>
<p>is conventional medicine now in the next</p>
<p>slide you can look at the links because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send everyone needs a these PDF</p>
<p>files but the point is that seven</p>
<p>hundred seven hundred thousand people a</p>
<p>year die of reactions to prescription</p>
<p>drugs and necessary antibiotics</p>
<p>unnecessary medical procedures</p>
<p>hospitalizations so that actually ranks</p>
<p>number one so I guess the therapy the</p>
<p>best therapy is to avoid doctors if you</p>
<p>want to live longer probably you know</p>
<p>the question is how many people actually</p>
<p>die the vitamins in 2010 not one person</p>
<p>in 2004 there&rsquo;s three people who died of</p>
<p>mega doses of vitamin D and vitamin E</p>
<p>but I would in their synthetic and of</p>
<p>course the one person died as a result</p>
<p>of overdose with iron and fluoride but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t consider fluoride a nutrient so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a huge push you know by</p>
<p>certain people to pretty much make</p>
<p>alternative care dangerous you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quackery it&rsquo;s scams but I personally</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just a way to camouflage just</p>
<p>like their own secrets or skeletons</p>
<p>because the amount of medication</p>
<p>Pumped in young children nowadays even</p>
<p>psych drugs that are pushing and the</p>
<p>soldiers there&rsquo;s 23 suicides every</p>
<p>single day in the military and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from the side effects and psychiatric</p>
<p>medication so I wanted to just share a</p>
<p>story by a client she told me today she</p>
<p>can you tell us what happened you you</p>
<p>basically went to the doctor and you</p>
<p>wanted some help and you started to you</p>
<p>had a whole list of problems because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working with you but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other issues that you wanted to kind of</p>
<p>evaluate can you just tell us a little</p>
<p>bit about you walked in there and you</p>
<p>saw the nurse and what what was the</p>
<p>first thing that she said well um first</p>
<p>I she asked me what I was there for so I</p>
<p>said well I have a list of things and I</p>
<p>had had some symptoms going on so I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been keeping track of them and writing</p>
<p>them all down and I started list listing</p>
<p>them off to her and she looked at me</p>
<p>like I was crazy and she said ma&rsquo;am</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need to pick the top two</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s not going to have time to</p>
<p>to deal with all of those issues look</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little shocked like it&rsquo;s like when</p>
<p>you go to a doctor you have a list of</p>
<p>problems all those are connected yes</p>
<p>suffer problems yes yes and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I tried to tell her I said no the</p>
<p>doctors going to need to listen to me</p>
<p>because these are all connected and I</p>
<p>need her to to help me figure out what</p>
<p>is going on so she left the room sort of</p>
<p>hurriedly acting very like almost rude</p>
<p>but when the doctor came in I did make</p>
<p>her sit there and listen to me with</p>
<p>every single one of my symptoms because</p>
<p>they are all connected like you and I</p>
<p>spoke today yeah and so so one of the</p>
<p>things that what&rsquo;s lacking in in health</p>
<p>care I mean look at this you got the top</p>
<p>cause of death is over medicated</p>
<p>patients unnecessary procedures with</p>
<p>everything has become so specialized</p>
<p>into</p>
<p>um if you have a digestive problem you</p>
<p>go to this doctor and er come problem</p>
<p>you go over here but they&rsquo;re not looking</p>
<p>at the whole picture I think even with</p>
<p>you you had I think you had some history</p>
<p>of panic attacks or something right yeah</p>
<p>and they bet what do they what do they</p>
<p>say about that um so I talked to her</p>
<p>about that and told her that I have been</p>
<p>having some panic attacks he basically</p>
<p>said okay so here&rsquo;s a script for you to</p>
<p>go to the psychiatrist and I didn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>to the psychiatrist and they said okay</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s some lorazepam or I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember what it was and you know um</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t any let&rsquo;s talk about why</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having panic attacks or what</p>
<p>might be going on it was well here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this medicine go ahead and take it so it</p>
<p>was very disheartening and frustrating</p>
<p>yeah yeah I know it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s you want</p>
<p>someone to listen to you to a by way to</p>
<p>come up with some solutions</p>
<p>um and then I think you eventually saw</p>
<p>the doctor okay</p>
<p>did he really what did he do did he say</p>
<p>none okay so so as I went through my</p>
<p>list of symptoms he she it was a woman</p>
<p>she says okay so you&rsquo;re having um some</p>
<p>panic attacks and and feeling like this</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s your referral to go to the see</p>
<p>the psychiatrist and oh you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>hot flashes okay here&rsquo;s your referral to</p>
<p>go to the gynecologist and oh you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having some joint pain here&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>referral to oh in your hip and in your</p>
<p>back so here&rsquo;s your referral to go get</p>
<p>some x-rays done oh you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>constipation so take some fiber thing</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m it just she was</p>
<p>treating each one of the things as as a</p>
<p>symptom as opposed to as opposed to</p>
<p>looking at everything that was going on</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on with me as a whole that</p>
<p>there might be something happen</p>
<p>um she just singled each of them out and</p>
<p>sent me to other places and tried to</p>
<p>treat each symptom individually yeah and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I wanted to do this webinar</p>
<p>just to give you guys some real basic</p>
<p>things I mean even one thing with you</p>
<p>with your hip</p>
<p>I did some muscle testing I found out I</p>
<p>asked you a question I said do you cross</p>
<p>your leg a lot on one side and yes you</p>
<p>do yeah I mean you constitute and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the muscle that is weak because</p>
<p>you keep crossing it and throws off the</p>
<p>pelvis so um the some of these things</p>
<p>are really really really um &lsquo;is obvious</p>
<p>but the problem is those are the</p>
<p>sometimes hardest to identify so I</p>
<p>wanted to get through so I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>come back to that point but I want to</p>
<p>just go through a couple things about</p>
<p>the third leading cause of death since</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to live longer because I I</p>
<p>kind of protest getting old I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to get old</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s inevitable but I want to</p>
<p>slow it down but it&rsquo;s important to kind</p>
<p>of know what people die of that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>losing leading cause of death after</p>
<p>heart disease and cancer is psychiatric</p>
<p>medications I didn&rsquo;t even know that I</p>
<p>looked that up and this is um in the</p>
<p>cancer in USA and Europe over a half a</p>
<p>million people die of either suicide or</p>
<p>psychiatric medication that reactions to</p>
<p>that I think that&rsquo;s why the drug</p>
<p>companies are being sued by the billions</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a lot of corruption going on</p>
<p>with psychiatric drugs in the military</p>
<p>all over the place and then you have</p>
<p>this guy Stephen Barret Beret whatever</p>
<p>his name is in quack watch which</p>
<p>basically says he says most diseases</p>
<p>have a little of nothing to do with diet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not um and he goes into saying that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s most things are placebo you know</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take vitamins</p>
<p>you know alternative practitioners</p>
<p>oversimplify he says when they say that</p>
<p>milling that&rsquo;s like rindy grain removes</p>
<p>the B vitamins they don&rsquo;t bother to tell</p>
<p>you the enrichment</p>
<p>and back so you can see that here is a</p>
<p>person who is very anti natural vitamins</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a psychiatrist which causes the</p>
<p>third leading cause of death there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a joke so the philosophy that</p>
<p>I wanted to teach you guys today is</p>
<p>really going beyond the outside in and</p>
<p>going the inside out working on the</p>
<p>inside of your body if you want this the</p>
<p>entire body to look youthful I think</p>
<p>probably the one of the biggest in your</p>
<p>seat industries out there is skincare</p>
<p>and makeup and hair care and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>just superficial you&rsquo;re just dealing</p>
<p>with a layer of a very tiny layer on the</p>
<p>outside of your body</p>
<p>there is much better things to do to get</p>
<p>the skin youthful prevent wrinkles and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to cover what you need to do a</p>
<p>better strategy would be to just really</p>
<p>look at the quality of materials that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re putting in your mouth and your</p>
<p>digesting I will say that certain parts</p>
<p>of your body are replaced at different</p>
<p>rates for example like your your skin</p>
<p>cells sometimes you replace every four</p>
<p>days the liver is replaced every three</p>
<p>years so the red blood cells are</p>
<p>replaced every four months the colon</p>
<p>cells are replaced every three days so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly replacing your cells</p>
<p>and the question is what are you</p>
<p>replacing them with I&rsquo;m going to show</p>
<p>you the best material to replace them</p>
<p>with but there&rsquo;s one thing that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>rejuvenate or doesn&rsquo;t replace itself and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the brain so once you kill off</p>
<p>your brain cells you don&rsquo;t replace them</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t come back so what I want to</p>
<p>do is I want to ask everyone who&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>the webinar um a question what food and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just make this what is the</p>
<p>food that gives us the highest nutrient</p>
<p>value okay it&rsquo;s a category of foods and</p>
<p>I want you to go ahead and I&rsquo;m looking</p>
<p>at your answers right now</p>
<p>want you to take a well guess what</p>
<p>category of food gives you the highest</p>
<p>amount of nutrition out of all food</p>
<p>categories I&rsquo;m going to give you a</p>
<p>second to answer that okay kale leafy</p>
<p>greens vegetables kale veggies plants</p>
<p>protein fats veggies protein okay well</p>
<p>this is interesting because this is</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s kind of unknown um yeah</p>
<p>berries no I always like that when you</p>
<p>ask a column in I&rsquo;ll ask a question I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>say um okay does anyone know this and</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re not going to know it so</p>
<p>you just know that&rsquo;s not right so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wrong you&rsquo;re wrong you&rsquo;re wrong so um</p>
<p>what about you you have any idea what</p>
<p>Leslie would what the highest nutrient</p>
<p>food is on the planet that you can get</p>
<p>all of your nutrition I should know this</p>
<p>ah I&rsquo;m thinking um I&rsquo;m thinking yeah I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why but I could be wrong all</p>
<p>right let me I mean I&rsquo;m eating all the</p>
<p>things on the side everybody&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>good stuff yeah oh sure the one that one</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;m not sure what the one thing</p>
<p>with me um okay so now I&rsquo;m going to tell</p>
<p>you um it is I thought I had slide on it</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t organ meats oregon means up</p>
<p>then yeah liver heart brains kidneys for</p>
<p>it personally um I can&rsquo;t eat those foods</p>
<p>I just I just can&rsquo;t eat them I think I</p>
<p>was as a child that was forced to eat</p>
<p>liver and I just can&rsquo;t eat it I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I have a hard time eating brains</p>
<p>and kidneys but I&rsquo;m just letting you</p>
<p>know those foods I know a lot of them</p>
<p>are toxic because of the animal feeds</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just telling you as far as the</p>
<p>nutrients that are in those foods like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really hard to find one food</p>
<p>that has all the nutrients but there is</p>
<p>one food that has all the</p>
<p>and that would be the organ meats so if</p>
<p>you like liver and you have an organic</p>
<p>or free-range you know animal and you</p>
<p>consume that it&rsquo;s not you will get a lot</p>
<p>of nutrition especially like iron and</p>
<p>there is one type of nutrient types of</p>
<p>vitamin e treants that are better for</p>
<p>looking young young than others and that</p>
<p>would be the fat soluble vitamins and</p>
<p>that would be like vitamin A D e K those</p>
<p>vitamins yes they&rsquo;re in vegetables but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually in vegetables they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pre vitamins so in other words they have</p>
<p>to convert into the active form and you</p>
<p>have to have a good digestive system to</p>
<p>consume that so you may if you&rsquo;re lucky</p>
<p>convert about 5% of those true fats and</p>
<p>vitamins to help division to the skin</p>
<p>even vitamin A for your skin if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have vitamin A you actually dry</p>
<p>out your skin you and you actually look</p>
<p>older going on a low-fat diet is very</p>
<p>very bad for anti-aging so let&rsquo;s go into</p>
<p>some of the the foods or the nutrients</p>
<p>that will help you stay younger or look</p>
<p>younger the first thing I want to talk</p>
<p>about is foods for college and support</p>
<p>whisk collagen collagen is like the glue</p>
<p>that holds the body together it&rsquo;s the UM</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the joints it&rsquo;s in the skin if</p>
<p>you lose collagen your skin gets thin</p>
<p>and it sags and you get wrinkles and you</p>
<p>look older so you can consume the</p>
<p>collagen itself or bone broth or</p>
<p>grass-fed animal products but you also</p>
<p>need trace minerals to actually utilize</p>
<p>that collagen you also need vitamin C to</p>
<p>use the collagen so I wanted to show you</p>
<p>something this is a grass-fed collagen</p>
<p>that I got online Great Lakes gelatin I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s good if you have like a</p>
<p>lot of joint problems arthritis and you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t consume</p>
<p>a lot of animal products especially</p>
<p>grass-fed that would be something you</p>
<p>can try and but I found that most people</p>
<p>are not really deficient in collagen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not something that are not eating</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not why they&rsquo;re losing your</p>
<p>collagen I&rsquo;ll get to the why but the</p>
<p>point is that it&rsquo;s not a bad supplement</p>
<p>to take but just by taking this doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>is does not mean your skin&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>look youthful you need several things to</p>
<p>to make that work um the big thing is</p>
<p>trace minerals as trace minerals are not</p>
<p>in the soils I&rsquo;ve done seminars on trace</p>
<p>minerals use a version I use trace</p>
<p>minerals it&rsquo;s a plant-based it&rsquo;s not sea</p>
<p>salt plant-based minerals have our fifty</p>
<p>fifteen thousand times smaller than</p>
<p>regular minerals so they it go in like a</p>
<p>rocket ship so you need the minerals you</p>
<p>also need the vitamin C complexes and I</p>
<p>I wanted to show you a food that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>high in vitamin C but I want to first</p>
<p>find out I&rsquo;m going to ask you what foods</p>
<p>are high in vitamin C what are the top</p>
<p>three foods that are the highest in</p>
<p>vitamin C let&rsquo;s see who can get that one</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>okay people are saying camu camu yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great citrus carrots broccoli</p>
<p>kale spinach so you guys you you guys</p>
<p>are doing pretty good on that one</p>
<p>so I think you got that one down there</p>
<p>the three foods at the highest in</p>
<p>vitamin C which would be number one up</p>
<p>ayah number two Kiwi and number three</p>
<p>peppers now these are not from the</p>
<p>grocery store these are from the farmers</p>
<p>market</p>
<p>these are freaking amazing peppers</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re crunchy there&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re loaded</p>
<p>with vitamin C and vitamin C you got to</p>
<p>be careful about vitamin C because most</p>
<p>of it is synthetic and I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>ascorbic acid if you buy Ottoman C and</p>
<p>it has over 100 milligrams of ascorbic</p>
<p>acid it&rsquo;s just synthetic they make</p>
<p>ascorbic acid from corn starch which has</p>
<p>no vitamin C in sulfuric acid and you</p>
<p>take this stuff you&rsquo;re not getting any /</p>
<p>C complex it&rsquo;s not going to help your</p>
<p>collagen if you do something like this</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get the complete complex</p>
<p>because in the complete version of</p>
<p>vitamin C you have enzymes a copper</p>
<p>enzyme called tyrosinase you have the J</p>
<p>factor the bioflavonoids</p>
<p>the route ins all the different great</p>
<p>complexes provided and C to help build</p>
<p>collagen and organic copper it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>mineral in that thing and so it&rsquo;s and by</p>
<p>the way a lot of the drought the vitamin</p>
<p>C is stored in your adrenal glands so</p>
<p>the dream glands are tired you won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough vitamin C to use that and</p>
<p>the other thing is that when you take</p>
<p>vitamin C in high dosages and synthetic</p>
<p>versions it will create deficiencies of</p>
<p>the other factors about and C causing</p>
<p>spider veins and I&rsquo;m going to talk more</p>
<p>about this in the next seminar but Linus</p>
<p>Pauling recommend large dose of vitamin</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>notice he has these spider veins around</p>
<p>his nose that&rsquo;s a vitamin C deficiency</p>
<p>because one of the side effects of</p>
<p>scurvy is micro hemorrhaging of the</p>
<p>capillary blood beds and so the scoop</p>
<p>the bleeding gums the spongy gums that</p>
<p>you have when you brush your teeth</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a vitamin C deficiency so and</p>
<p>also fatigue is a vitamin C deficiency</p>
<p>but also the arteries the arteries can</p>
<p>in high-pressure areas have a micro</p>
<p>hemorrhage hemorrhage and so the body</p>
<p>puts a bandaid on it called cholesterol</p>
<p>and calcium plaquing and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>makes the clogged artery but the first</p>
<p>thing that happens is the micro damaged</p>
<p>hemorrhage from the vitamin-c complex</p>
<p>deficiency so those are some vitamin C</p>
<p>things that you can look at and</p>
<p>especially for your skin I mean you need</p>
<p>that collagen so now I&rsquo;m going to go</p>
<p>back to my slide if I can do a screen</p>
<p>share let me see here okay so we have</p>
<p>collagen bone broth if you took an org</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say some bones from and um let&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cow or something and it was grass-fed</p>
<p>and you were to cook it over a day or</p>
<p>two and make some bone broth and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a great recipe that would not be a bad</p>
<p>idea to drink that stuff it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good for collagen especially if you want</p>
<p>really strong nails and hair um I can</p>
<p>actually if I can either use trace</p>
<p>minerals to make hair stop falling out</p>
<p>or sometimes collagen or the combination</p>
<p>of both but because trace minerals also</p>
<p>help the collagen form correctly so the</p>
<p>combination is very very important</p>
<p>especially for a hair loss so the most</p>
<p>important thing to do is to make sure</p>
<p>that your animal meats are grass-fed and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you I use them like</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an example I do a lot of beef</p>
<p>myself this is grass-fed um and the</p>
<p>reason why I do</p>
<p>grass-fed is because it has loaded with</p>
<p>vitamin k2 if you&rsquo;ve seen any of my</p>
<p>videos you basically know about k2 it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be the next super vitamin it</p>
<p>improves elasticity of the arteries it</p>
<p>decreases blood pressure it gets calcium</p>
<p>out of the joints it&rsquo;s quite amazing and</p>
<p>of course we have the grass-fed</p>
<p>Kerrygold butter that&rsquo;s vitamin K it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>loaded with vitamin A and of course I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>showing all my food here um these are my</p>
<p>eggs from the farmers market from a</p>
<p>farmer that basically I have a video I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to put a video of this farmer</p>
<p>because he has these cages in the grass</p>
<p>field in the clover fields and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like the human lawn mower they will eat</p>
<p>all this grass and then he rotates them</p>
<p>I mean talk about a pasture raised</p>
<p>grass-fed chicken I mean those things</p>
<p>are those eggs it&rsquo;s hard to even break</p>
<p>the shell it&rsquo;s silt loaded with calcium</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s quite amazing um there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple questions I want to just go right</p>
<p>to the questions um said the webinar</p>
<p>keeps cutting out nope no worries I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to record this and I&rsquo;ll send you</p>
<p>the link right when I get done what</p>
<p>about fermented cabbage I love it I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a great idea and vitamin I</p>
<p>mean cabbage is is really huge in</p>
<p>vitamin C and it has a complete complex</p>
<p>can spider veins be repaired by taking</p>
<p>proper amounts of vitamin C well I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t worry about the amounts I would</p>
<p>worry about the type of vitamin C that</p>
<p>you consume and yes it can be reversed</p>
<p>if you have the whole complex just make</p>
<p>sure you do not consume ascorbic acid um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see what else grapefruit has some</p>
<p>vitamin C but it&rsquo;s a bit too sweet if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight I always</p>
<p>have to talk about that because fruit</p>
<p>tends to slow down weight loss okay good</p>
<p>what what if you have autoimmune and</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do nitrates well then you can use</p>
<p>the you know there&rsquo;s camu camu is a</p>
<p>great vitamin c complex you can do that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of other things that you</p>
<p>can do other than nitrates not a problem</p>
<p>okay so there&rsquo;s three things for</p>
<p>collagen support</p>
<p>one is you need you possibly might need</p>
<p>collagen you might need trace minerals</p>
<p>and you you might need to support your</p>
<p>your stomach because if your stomach has</p>
<p>um if you have like acid reflux or you</p>
<p>have bloating or burping and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough acid that could be the</p>
<p>reason why you can&rsquo;t digest protein and</p>
<p>collagen is your stomach has to be</p>
<p>really really acid to to trigger those</p>
<p>enzymes in the stomach to break down</p>
<p>collagen so as you get older especially</p>
<p>during menopause you lose your stomach</p>
<p>acids so if I were trying to improve my</p>
<p>collagen and I was female and I was</p>
<p>menopausal the first thing I would do</p>
<p>before anything is I would make sure</p>
<p>that I correct on that digestive stomach</p>
<p>pH so if I had like indigestion or s</p>
<p>reflux or heartburn that means that I</p>
<p>would have to add more acid to that</p>
<p>stomach to correct it so the valve gets</p>
<p>closed called betaine hydrochloride so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listening now and you have any</p>
<p>digestive issues at all</p>
<p>take some betaine hydrochloride maybe</p>
<p>three with a meal get it from the help</p>
<p>of store and then within a week or two</p>
<p>watch what happens to your hair nails</p>
<p>and skin it will improve because you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start absorbing more of the collagen</p>
<p>from the food you&rsquo;re already eating so</p>
<p>we just have to look at those factors</p>
<p>the next thing I want to talk about is</p>
<p>very important and this is for those</p>
<p>people that want to change the not just</p>
<p>their health but the looking youthful</p>
<p>and that would be the fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins and all the oils you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to go crazy you have to be able to</p>
<p>digest them</p>
<p>you need to have a good gallbladder to</p>
<p>digest them but the point is that when</p>
<p>people are pushing the low fat stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you start looking older you</p>
<p>want to look at the shelf and get whole</p>
<p>fat not low fat anything so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do some yogurt you know make</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s whole fat of course you go</p>
<p>watch out for the sugars and yogurt</p>
<p>nowadays um so there&rsquo;s not a problem</p>
<p>using the butter it&rsquo;s good for the skin</p>
<p>because it contains vitamin A so the</p>
<p>first item I&rsquo;m going to talk about is</p>
<p>vitamin A and that is in egg yolks</p>
<p>grass-fed butter shrimp cheese sardines</p>
<p>to nuts and fish it&rsquo;s in all the fatty</p>
<p>stuff I&rsquo;ll show you something here um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show oh yeah cheese I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>from Wisconsin</p>
<p>so I love cheese and of course Kerrygold</p>
<p>here we go Kerry gold butter Kerry gold</p>
<p>cheese this is my favorite cheese right</p>
<p>here it&rsquo;s at BJ&rsquo;s in Costco now I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe it it&rsquo;s all grass-fed here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another grass-fed cheese from Trader</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s I do a lot of cheese that has the</p>
<p>vitamin K it has a vitamin A even even</p>
<p>some vitamin D those are fat soluble</p>
<p>vitamins that you need for your skin for</p>
<p>your hair to prevent wrinkles so those</p>
<p>are things that will really really help</p>
<p>you and take them from the inside don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>rub the butter on the outside of your</p>
<p>skin that&rsquo;s not going to do it I used to</p>
<p>crave butter as a kid I used to eat it</p>
<p>of course I had no idea why now I know</p>
<p>why I was deficient in vitamin A hmm so</p>
<p>so vitamin A it&rsquo;s in these fattier type</p>
<p>things that you were told to avoid</p>
<p>mm-hmm so the other thing you can do is</p>
<p>up coconut oil you can cook with it you</p>
<p>can eat it fish oils</p>
<p>the best fish oil that you can have is</p>
<p>either krill or cod liver oil yes</p>
<p>your grandmother was correct cod liver</p>
<p>oil has a wonderful blend of vitamin A</p>
<p>and vitamin D so don&rsquo;t I mean just I</p>
<p>would start consuming just you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need a lot of it you just need a little</p>
<p>bit of it okay</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s talk about vitamin E why is</p>
<p>vitamin E important you&rsquo;ve heard vitamin</p>
<p>E for scarring for skin health for sex</p>
<p>hormones vitamin E is a precursor for</p>
<p>hormones and it&rsquo;s stored in the</p>
<p>pituitary when women go through</p>
<p>menopause they don&rsquo;t use their ovaries</p>
<p>very much anymore so they&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to baby so what happens is that that</p>
<p>dynamic that pituitary release every</p>
<p>month is no longer it no longer has to</p>
<p>work as hard so the vitamin E reserve</p>
<p>tends to dry up in a lot of women and I</p>
<p>find they end up with a vitamin E</p>
<p>deficiency and they start getting</p>
<p>unnecessary wrinkles so I fire you what</p>
<p>I would do is I would don&rsquo;t be afraid to</p>
<p>start consuming some of these fats but</p>
<p>the foods that are highest in vitamin E</p>
<p>are almonds other nuts sunflower seeds</p>
<p>very high but they have to be raw</p>
<p>sunflower seeds because when you cook</p>
<p>them and you roast them you destroy the</p>
<p>vitamin E because vitamin E is very</p>
<p>sensitive to oxygen and heat okay fatty</p>
<p>your fish like halibut salmon shrimp</p>
<p>sardines lobster um and it&rsquo;s also in the</p>
<p>leafy greens the spinach chard kale some</p>
<p>eggs it&rsquo;s an avocado so it&rsquo;s an olives</p>
<p>so those are just some some common</p>
<p>things course vitamin D is the Sun fish</p>
<p>oils eggs cheese um but other than that</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re not eating any</p>
<p>officials or eggs or cheese because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a low-fat diet you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>much Sun and you&rsquo;re going to low vitamin</p>
<p>D levels vitamin D is necessary for the</p>
<p>aging anti-aging</p>
<p>process okay so what I&rsquo;m going to do now</p>
<p>is I just want to double check just to</p>
<p>make sure that there&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m answering any</p>
<p>questions so someone says they love</p>
<p>sardines cow&rsquo;s milk allergy well if you</p>
<p>have if you&rsquo;re allergic to you know milk</p>
<p>not a problem I&rsquo;ve given you a list of</p>
<p>other things you consume as well</p>
<p>dandelion greens for vitamin A yeah well</p>
<p>the the problem is the plant sources</p>
<p>provide them an a they&rsquo;re all pre</p>
<p>vitamin A so you&rsquo;re only going to absorb</p>
<p>five percent and that is the challenge</p>
<p>that we do if now I consume a lot of yes</p>
<p>kale okay I eat kale I cut it chop it up</p>
<p>my salad so that&rsquo;s loaded with vitamin</p>
<p>pre vitamin A but it&rsquo;s C the cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables have other nutrients we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get into that but the point is that you</p>
<p>need to be eating them but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be getting the majority of your</p>
<p>vitamin A from leafy greens because you</p>
<p>only absorb 5% yeah I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>okay let me just check these questions</p>
<p>right here</p>
<p>um you say BJ&rsquo;s has good caracal yes</p>
<p>BJ&rsquo;s does carry the Kerrygold in bulk so</p>
<p>yes tuna is is fine I know there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>problems with mercury um but I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain time I&rsquo;m actually going</p>
<p>to do a video on tuna because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain types of tuna that are actually</p>
<p>good and some tuna that it&rsquo;s not good</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a complete video because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into a side thing on</p>
<p>that right now</p>
<p>fermented cod liver oil is the best and</p>
<p>you can get that online you can get it</p>
<p>from Amazon I do take that it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>good um I was given cod liver oil when I</p>
<p>was a kid</p>
<p>lasted until Easter yeah it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>good stuff um</p>
<p>I found I sweat really bad with out my</p>
<p>vitamin D interesting graying of the</p>
<p>hair mostly after exercise well that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>stress see one of the things that we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get into next is stress so I&rsquo;ll talk</p>
<p>about that then can you get enough</p>
<p>vitamin D from foods you need supplement</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very good question I think you</p>
<p>can maintain your body with just with</p>
<p>vitamin k2 foods but if you have high</p>
<p>blood pressure stiffness you have tartar</p>
<p>on the teeth soft tissue calcium you</p>
<p>have arthritis or types of joint</p>
<p>problems then you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>take extra and then once you get rid of</p>
<p>that you can then maintain it after that</p>
<p>so it is possible but not as a maintain</p>
<p>maintaining thing okay now I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>show you something</p>
<p>see if I can pop back over here now the</p>
<p>accelerated aging of cortisol the</p>
<p>hormone cortisol here&rsquo;s a new word that</p>
<p>I want to teach you is called catabolism</p>
<p>catabolism what does that mean</p>
<p>catabolism catabolism is a breakdown of</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s something that breaks down</p>
<p>in the body your body naturally uses the</p>
<p>hormone cortisol to break down tissue</p>
<p>but with the adrenal stress hormone</p>
<p>being activated what happens is you get</p>
<p>too much breakdown and not enough build</p>
<p>up so you get this overall catabolic</p>
<p>effect that means a breakdown effect on</p>
<p>the on the muscles specifically your</p>
<p>thigh muscles in the quad group so when</p>
<p>you get up from a seated position or</p>
<p>from a chair it might be difficult to</p>
<p>mount this time to get up also the skin</p>
<p>is very thin and almost paper like and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see that with people I&rsquo;ll look at</p>
<p>their skin you can just see it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>very very very thin that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem of excessive cortisol with</p>
<p>stress and you&rsquo;re losing your collagen</p>
<p>you also have a disappearance of the</p>
<p>elastic fibers and that&rsquo;s why your</p>
<p>joints it&rsquo;s so brittle all the time as</p>
<p>you age and that&rsquo;s just one of the</p>
<p>effects of of course</p>
<p>now I did a whole seminar on cortisol</p>
<p>that was the last seminar I did and I</p>
<p>talked about stress and if you did not</p>
<p>see that webinar go ahead and watch it</p>
<p>but I will give you some tips on stress</p>
<p>right now because I would say one of the</p>
<p>biggest things that ages people is</p>
<p>stress specifically losses loss of a</p>
<p>person loved one loss of a job loss of a</p>
<p>marriage threat of loss financial threat</p>
<p>of loss bad economy all that will add</p>
<p>stress and so you do have to constantly</p>
<p>work on reducing corners so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple nutritional things that I</p>
<p>recommend for cortisol I do recommend</p>
<p>the adrenal day formula because it has a</p>
<p>natural b1 and there that does not it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from nutritional use but it doesn&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>you a yeast infection like some of the</p>
<p>nutritional yeast out there and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>synthetic like a lot of the nutritional</p>
<p>yeast are enriched with synthetic so if</p>
<p>you did um a that product and you take</p>
<p>the that natural b1 with all the other</p>
<p>things in it it&rsquo;ll tend to pull a lot of</p>
<p>stress out your body you feel very very</p>
<p>calm and chilled out so b1 is necessary</p>
<p>to rid stress from your body and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>feel a difference how do you know if you</p>
<p>have a b1 deficiency there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>ways number one you feel a lot of</p>
<p>nervous tension in your body you just</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t relax you have a low</p>
<p>tolerance to stress you have a Deema and</p>
<p>swelling yes a demon swelling is that b1</p>
<p>deficiency many times as well you have</p>
<p>nightmares where very vivid dreams so if</p>
<p>you have any of those we know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a b1 deficiency and stress will</p>
<p>cause that another thing you can do is</p>
<p>get space go up for long walks because</p>
<p>stress tends to inhibit your space and</p>
<p>you get it&rsquo;s like you need to get</p>
<p>outside and just get some space because</p>
<p>that calms the adrenal gland down you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just a picture of how proteins and</p>
<p>different things can break down fat can</p>
<p>break down sugars can break down call it</p>
<p>catabolism and just a breakdown</p>
<p>okay we&rsquo;re shifting gears now to cancer</p>
<p>control because one of the things that</p>
<p>um which is a process is dying early</p>
<p>from cancer I mean there are people all</p>
<p>around me that are dropping dead with</p>
<p>cancer patients patients relatives</p>
<p>family members so it is a problem and</p>
<p>there are things that we can do to</p>
<p>reduce the risk of cancer and I want to</p>
<p>talk about that um let&rsquo;s first define</p>
<p>what cancer is cancer is a cell that is</p>
<p>out of control it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s duplicating at</p>
<p>a very fast rate and the question is why</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a mechanism a machine in your</p>
<p>body that is constantly keeping these</p>
<p>extra cells that are radically growing</p>
<p>out of proportion in check so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another word I&rsquo;m going to teach</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s called apoptosis apoptosis and</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s basically controlled cell</p>
<p>death your body is killing between 50</p>
<p>and 70 billion cells every single day</p>
<p>which they need to do that because they</p>
<p>need to clean out all these you know</p>
<p>mutated cells the cells that we need to</p>
<p>get rid of so we can replace with the</p>
<p>new cells so for an average trial</p>
<p>between the ages of 8 and 14 about 20</p>
<p>billion to 30 billion cells die a day so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called apoptosis so now if we</p>
<p>have if we&rsquo;re getting cancer we want</p>
<p>apoptosis to work correctly to kill that</p>
<p>cancer so apoptosis is a mechanism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an important defense against</p>
<p>cancer okay so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the foundation I want to talk about so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain things that dis destroy</p>
<p>this mechanism in block the your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to kill off these cells and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain things that do it and</p>
<p>this slide is out of order</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called endocrine disruptors so I</p>
<p>want to just touch on this for a second</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s an endocrine disruptor an</p>
<p>endocrine disruptor is any chemical in</p>
<p>the body pesticide herbicides fungicides</p>
<p>insecticides heavy metals</p>
<p>country-and-western just wanna see if</p>
<p>you guys are awake</p>
<p>that was a joke that was a dry sense of</p>
<p>humor heavy metals country-western was a</p>
<p>bad joke okay so endocrine disruptors</p>
<p>are any chemicals in environment that</p>
<p>alter your genes and cause disease</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these I have this book it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about three inches thick it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>modern text toxicology&rsquo;s the basically</p>
<p>the textbook of poisons okay the study</p>
<p>of poisons and what poisons do with it</p>
<p>to the body</p>
<p>we are bathed in so many chemicals it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s insane from walking out in the yard</p>
<p>to our food to the air we&rsquo;re just bathed</p>
<p>in all these chemicals I mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>over four billion pounds of toxic</p>
<p>chemicals releasing into our environment</p>
<p>every single year that&rsquo;s 72 million</p>
<p>pounds of recognized carcinogens which</p>
<p>actually cause cancer so our bodies are</p>
<p>constantly hit with these endocrine</p>
<p>disruptors okay well guess what these</p>
<p>endocrine disruptors mess up the normal</p>
<p>process of your body controlling cancer</p>
<p>so you may have known that already but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just refreshing your your mind I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just touching right now I want to see if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any questions real fast because</p>
<p>oh yeah someone mentioned des</p>
<p>diethylstilbestrol here&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tongue twister diethylstilbestrol was</p>
<p>used in the 50s from</p>
<p>morning sickness I think over like</p>
<p>millions of women were exposed to it and</p>
<p>it caused problems not just in the</p>
<p>offspring but in the third generation it</p>
<p>it really destroyed our bodies and they</p>
<p>did not test the long-term effects of</p>
<p>that very very similarly to what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing now with the GMO foods so they</p>
<p>made a lot of money and then now they</p>
<p>banned it</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s des so des is called</p>
<p>endocrine disruptor destroys your how</p>
<p>your hormones okay so now this really</p>
<p>amazing car called the cytochrome p450</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m just this is another bad joke</p>
<p>but it sounds like a car doesn&rsquo;t at p450</p>
<p>now a cytochrome p450 is an enzyme that</p>
<p>has incredible capacities to turn those</p>
<p>endocrine disrupters those poisons into</p>
<p>harmless particles yeah so cytochrome</p>
<p>p450 enzymes are these special enzymes</p>
<p>in your liver and they&rsquo;re in different</p>
<p>cells in your body that can break down</p>
<p>thousands of chemicals toxins drugs and</p>
<p>poisons and they basically just turn</p>
<p>them into water-soluble particles that</p>
<p>can go through the urine and it just so</p>
<p>happens that the cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>increase your livers ability to make</p>
<p>this enzyme that&rsquo;s really cool so here</p>
<p>it is right here insecticides pesticides</p>
<p>going to the liver and your liver if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating the right foods will</p>
<p>basically dismantle those chemicals so</p>
<p>your liver is like robust but if you</p>
<p>have a fatty liver or it&rsquo;s a liver</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a bad liver from some type of</p>
<p>virus or something then what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>happen is that you&rsquo;re not going to get</p>
<p>that breakdown how do you know if you</p>
<p>have a fatty liver um a lot of people</p>
<p>have it and they don&rsquo;t know it one of</p>
<p>the biggest clues is your stomach being</p>
<p>too big and that&rsquo;s causing visceral fat</p>
<p>around the organs and especially the</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>I sent five of my patients to the</p>
<p>radiologist to get an ultrasound of the</p>
<p>liver and they all have guts in five</p>
<p>hundred a fatty liver so when you lose</p>
<p>the capacity for liver</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t detoxify as well and you get a</p>
<p>lot more toxicity and what do you have</p>
<p>to do if you have that condition you</p>
<p>have to basically start consuming a lot</p>
<p>of cruciferous and avoid the junk you</p>
<p>need to get the junk out of the trunk</p>
<p>all right so if someone check the</p>
<p>questions here dr. Berg isn&rsquo;t it more of</p>
<p>a function of minerals actually being in</p>
<p>the soil before you can assume that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re part of the plant in a plant or</p>
<p>an animal that is eat it yes well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I really want to consume grass-fed</p>
<p>animal products because our soils are so</p>
<p>bad now that we need to and that you</p>
<p>feed these animals corn and soy they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting a nutrition from that at all</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all genetically modified so at</p>
<p>least if it&rsquo;s grass it doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>genetically modified if you have a lot</p>
<p>more nutrition in the grass especially</p>
<p>like clover okay okay let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>the slides here okay at the liver very</p>
<p>important with with your skin if you</p>
<p>really work on your liver and you start</p>
<p>consuming a lot more of these</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables your skin will</p>
<p>start to change and you&rsquo;ll start looking</p>
<p>better and better and better especially</p>
<p>with acne and dry skin and youthful skin</p>
<p>I mean the liver is really the hub of</p>
<p>all the digestion of of your amino acids</p>
<p>your proteins so we&rsquo;re going to talk</p>
<p>about cruciferous for a second let me</p>
<p>just fix the slide here cruciferous what</p>
<p>does this moot word mean Chris crus</p>
<p>which means cross it&rsquo;s basically certain</p>
<p>plants that have these little crosses in</p>
<p>them okay and here&rsquo;s some examples of</p>
<p>cruciferous radishes Brussels sprouts</p>
<p>kale cabbage bok choy and Swiss chard</p>
<p>mustard greens arugula now I have some</p>
<p>other vegetables in here too but I</p>
<p>wanted just to mention the cruciferous</p>
<p>family and this is this brings me to the</p>
<p>next topic which is going to call um</p>
<p>which is a different type of nutrient we</p>
<p>talked about the fat soluble vitamins</p>
<p>but we now we need to talk about the</p>
<p>other nutrient that will not just help</p>
<p>your skin and all that but it will help</p>
<p>postpone your life cruciferous was</p>
<p>studied by the World Health Organization</p>
<p>and it was found to create some serious</p>
<p>anti-aging effects and anti-cancer</p>
<p>effects on your body each type of food</p>
<p>is thoroughly tested to decrease the</p>
<p>risk factors of many different types of</p>
<p>cancer so one type of cruciferous will</p>
<p>maybe handle like several type of</p>
<p>cancers another one will handle a</p>
<p>different other ones garlic is probably</p>
<p>the top of the list that probably will</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the most anti-cancer</p>
<p>properties these are two different types</p>
<p>of kale tumeric is a an amazing final</p>
<p>nutrient it has phytonutrients I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>turmeric is kind of a root that has</p>
<p>phytonutrients so the category of</p>
<p>nutrients that we want to talk about</p>
<p>next is called phytonutrients plant</p>
<p>chemicals these are different than</p>
<p>vitamins and minerals and amino acids</p>
<p>they basically are natural plant</p>
<p>chemicals that have extra health factors</p>
<p>or properties so they&rsquo;re there like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll actually help with macular</p>
<p>degeneration prostate cancer many</p>
<p>disease states and so the question is</p>
<p>why are not what why are we eating these</p>
<p>foods I mean very few people consume</p>
<p>these foods here&rsquo;s some good ones</p>
<p>parsley cabbage and seek help seek help</p>
<p>is great for minerals and iodine um but</p>
<p>these are the foods that I consume on a</p>
<p>regular</p>
<p>basses if you don&rsquo;t consume them you</p>
<p>need to start doing it for your liver</p>
<p>and your skin will start to change as</p>
<p>well even though these do not contain a</p>
<p>lot of the fat soluble vitamins they do</p>
<p>contain a lot of the phytonutrients</p>
<p>which there are anti-cancer and again</p>
<p>the GMO foods genetically modified foods</p>
<p>are basically spreading all over the</p>
<p>world right now and the two big ones are</p>
<p>corn and soy and the animals that are</p>
<p>consuming these are getting all sorts of</p>
<p>inflammatory conditions and even the the</p>
<p>pets that you have like even the dogs</p>
<p>and the cats if you talk to a vet on</p>
<p>these animals that come in with</p>
<p>arthritis heart disease diabetes and</p>
<p>inflammation in the gut it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re consuming GMO food when you just</p>
<p>simply change the food not on GMO these</p>
<p>things clear up but 90% of all the GMO</p>
<p>corn and soy go to animal feeds that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty sad so in the grocery store that</p>
<p>so-called natural chicken that you have</p>
<p>from Purdue it&rsquo;s all GML unless it says</p>
<p>organic it&rsquo;s GML now what does GMO GMO</p>
<p>is genetically modified organisms and</p>
<p>what they do is they they actually have</p>
<p>them resistant to the herbicide called</p>
<p>Roundup Ready and so you can spray more</p>
<p>the Roundup Ready on these crops and so</p>
<p>you bet they do that and it&rsquo;s around</p>
<p>already the chemical name is called</p>
<p>glyphosate and glyphosate is um pretty</p>
<p>nasty stuff but of course they say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>safe so I think it might be okay um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this French researcher by the</p>
<p>way that was just a sarcasm um sometimes</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t get my dry humor I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re safe but there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>French researcher who did studies animal</p>
<p>studies and glyphosate and he found some</p>
<p>serious problems with glyphosate and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>on a semi I&rsquo;m going to send you the link</p>
<p>to it says that GMO and glyphosate</p>
<p>causes tumors liver and</p>
<p>any damage and rats within a week a</p>
<p>smear campaign was mounted by the</p>
<p>biotechnology industry with scientists</p>
<p>primarily plant biologists and not</p>
<p>toxicologists and they basically forced</p>
<p>this study to be extracted from some of</p>
<p>these journals so here the study comes</p>
<p>out saying that GMO is bad and then it</p>
<p>instantly was retracted not because they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t find a cancer link but their</p>
<p>reasoning was it was inconclusive</p>
<p>because the type of rats used were prone</p>
<p>to tumors so now here&rsquo;s the thing if</p>
<p>they can do that you know that how</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so powerful they are so powerful</p>
<p>so um I mean you can this is totally</p>
<p>political so the point is that you know</p>
<p>the GMO food is pretty bad if you look</p>
<p>at from 1990 to 2012 you can see how</p>
<p>many millions of pounds of glyphosate is</p>
<p>being put or GMO plants are being</p>
<p>created and you can see corns going up</p>
<p>soybeans is going up wheat actually some</p>
<p>of the wheat is genetically modified</p>
<p>cotton uh certain vegetables and fruit</p>
<p>rice grapes</p>
<p>alfalfa pasture and hay other crops oh</p>
<p>my gosh it&rsquo;s just kind of going up it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just crazy</p>
<p>so what happens is these chemicals GMO</p>
<p>foods herbicides they can mimic hormones</p>
<p>and they go into your glands that die</p>
<p>right the ovary and it can go into the</p>
<p>breasts the uterus and cause cancer so</p>
<p>if you take a look at like they always</p>
<p>say that disease is so mysterious and it</p>
<p>no one knows what causes this take a</p>
<p>look at any of the toxicology books they</p>
<p>will list all the diseases and tell you</p>
<p>what pesticide or chemical causes this</p>
<p>illness or this cancer and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really like you said Leslie they they do</p>
<p>not connect the dots they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Connect toxicology with cancer and</p>
<p>natural things everything is like their</p>
<p>own Island and so it&rsquo;s very obvious to</p>
<p>me that all these things that are</p>
<p>related to the toxins and we we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually we&rsquo;re not making the connection</p>
<p>there of course we have psychiatrists</p>
<p>like Stephen Barret without beret</p>
<p>whatever his name is pushing out there</p>
<p>that oh no that&rsquo;s fine just keep eating</p>
<p>the stuff I was a released a video I was</p>
<p>on sports talk live and I had a</p>
<p>dietitian and her husband was an MD get</p>
<p>on the air and give me a hard time about</p>
<p>the whole water meth so you can watch it</p>
<p>on my website but um it was ridiculous</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like oh yeah the tap water&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine it has minerals to keep drinking it</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s dehydrated I&rsquo;m like yeah okay</p>
<p>alright so you just see the next slag</p>
<p>here okay be the hormones like estrogen</p>
<p>from the environment and all these</p>
<p>endocrine disrupters act like estrogen</p>
<p>in the environment they actually block</p>
<p>the thyroid function so endocrine</p>
<p>disrupters basically are chemicals that</p>
<p>mimic estrogen and that&rsquo;s why females it</p>
<p>way way too many cancers in the in the</p>
<p>areas that they have receptors for</p>
<p>estrogen which are breast uterus and</p>
<p>even the thyroid african-american women</p>
<p>have a lot more receptors for estrogen</p>
<p>which gives them a different shape and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why even</p>
<p>African American women are getting more</p>
<p>cancers than other cultures because of</p>
<p>the estrogen so you really need to</p>
<p>increase your cruciferous make sure you</p>
<p>do consume things that are you know make</p>
<p>sure they&rsquo;re organic hormone-free</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to create a problem</p>
<p>sooner or later so I just wanted to put</p>
<p>this slide up I had it created you can</p>
<p>see if you go down the grocery store you</p>
<p>see these incredible I</p>
<p>delicious cookies and doughnuts and</p>
<p>breads it&rsquo;s all the same ingredients I</p>
<p>purchased corn syrup hydrogenated oils</p>
<p>chemicals high-fructose corn syrup</p>
<p>artificial flavoring it&rsquo;s all the same</p>
<p>thing pretty sad</p>
<p>so phytonutrients those are plant-based</p>
<p>chemicals that have all these really</p>
<p>amazing properties and all these</p>
<p>different plant chemicals that do many</p>
<p>things like even vitamin A for example</p>
<p>vitamin A is not a single vitamin it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>whole bunch of complexes like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>over 600 parts of vitamin A so if you</p>
<p>take a synthetic vitamin A you are not</p>
<p>even getting close to what you should</p>
<p>get that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m very much against</p>
<p>synthetics so cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>help protect the cells from DNA damage</p>
<p>they help inactivate carcinogens they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>antiviral antibacterial</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory I mean they create all</p>
<p>these wonderful benefits now I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to check check the questions here what</p>
<p>do you think of wild yam well if you um</p>
<p>have a problem with hot flashes with</p>
<p>menopause I think that would be</p>
<p>something you should take because that</p>
<p>will it&rsquo;s a natural source of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called phyto estrogens which are</p>
<p>actually will help you there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other ones to call the clover leaf</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually very good as well um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see okay how much difference will</p>
<p>it take to take a cruciferous supplement</p>
<p>um here&rsquo;s the thing it&rsquo;s always best to</p>
<p>consume the food but it is hard to get</p>
<p>that so what I&rsquo;m going to show you is a</p>
<p>the cruciferous product that a lot of</p>
<p>you are already taking right now and of</p>
<p>course you probably have not been taking</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been out of it since March</p>
<p>but I wanted to explain kind of a</p>
<p>combination of</p>
<p>ingredients that I&rsquo;m not even I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not even showing this image here</p>
<p>okay so you can see right here there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>product that I I created it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>Creuset organic cruciferous food and it</p>
<p>has organic beetroot Brussels sprouts</p>
<p>collard green organic asparagus organic</p>
<p>kale organic parsley and parsley is</p>
<p>probably even has more vitamin of</p>
<p>vitamins and kale and then we have</p>
<p>organic red radish cabbage garlic and</p>
<p>tamarick so those are all the things</p>
<p>that I personally think are the the</p>
<p>superfoods and I put them in in one</p>
<p>combination was 250 tablets in this and</p>
<p>this is something that is convenient if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have all the different variety</p>
<p>of nutrients because it is hard to get</p>
<p>all these nutrients so like it has all</p>
<p>these these products in there has seek</p>
<p>help because some people we go because</p>
<p>oh my gosh is there&rsquo;s cruciferous it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to cause a deficiency of iodine</p>
<p>for my thyroid I&rsquo;m gonna get a quarter</p>
<p>no you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>I put the sea kelp in there so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really awesome product and and in these</p>
<p>webinars I always get people at discount</p>
<p>if you wanted to get some cruciferous um</p>
<p>the bottle is 250 capsules and here&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>have some good news and some bad news</p>
<p>what do you want to hear at first the</p>
<p>bad news or the good news let me see</p>
<p>what you guys say there&rsquo;s a delay in</p>
<p>this thing okay Leslie us you want the</p>
<p>good news or the bad news</p>
<p>um bad news look at good news</p>
<p>okay good the good news is that I&rsquo;m</p>

<p>that it&rsquo;s fun it&rsquo;s almost in</p>
<p>News is not in yet it&rsquo;s in tomorrow</p>
<p>morning&rsquo;s coming tomorrow morning so but</p>
<p>the good news it&rsquo;s almost in and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had people wait since March for this</p>
<p>product because because here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem I ran into um it is almost</p>
<p>impossible to find a local farmer or</p>
<p>something United States that has the</p>
<p>soils that I want to get these products</p>
<p>unless you go to China or you go to some</p>
<p>other country I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t do that so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s taken us forever and so what will</p>
<p>happen this is March March March April</p>
<p>May June July August is it August or</p>
<p>September September ok that&rsquo;s seven</p>
<p>months I haven&rsquo;t had this product I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting it tomorrow morning it&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>tomorrow morning Percy so what happened</p>
<p>is I would get it would have like one</p>
<p>ingredient tested would be it would have</p>
<p>too much lead in it and like I can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that and next one I have like too much I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know another mineral that we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want in there that&rsquo;s toxic or something</p>
<p>like that so we had the thoroughly test</p>
<p>every single ingredient and make sure</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s all really really high quality</p>
<p>from the exact farms that I wanted it</p>
<p>from so it&rsquo;s finally done so the good</p>
<p>news it&rsquo;s almost here the bad news is</p>
<p>not quite here and so um there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>more bad news which I&rsquo;m going to tell</p>
<p>you right now the other bad news is that</p>
<p>um the cost of this product went up</p>
<p>severely so I have to increase it a</p>
<p>little bit more so that going to be five</p>
<p>dollars more but the good news is if you</p>
<p>wanted to get the product at the lowest</p>
<p>fee you can actually buy as many of</p>
<p>these as you want with on this on this</p>
<p>webinar so that&rsquo;s the good news so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to pay the big raphy if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want so you can get some reserve</p>
<p>if you want the only catch-22 is that I</p>
<p>only want you to order this tomorrow</p>
<p>morning not tonight because I do not</p>
<p>want to sell you</p>
<p>is product unless I am 100 percent sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s available yeah even though I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>tracking I&rsquo;m tracking the guy who&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>pulling up in my offices I know what</p>
<p>state he&rsquo;s in he&rsquo;s going to be showing</p>
<p>it tomorrow but until it shows up I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to take I&rsquo;m not going to take</p>
<p>the block off my website so no there was</p>
<p>no one can really buy it until I</p>
<p>actually have it in hand so if you</p>
<p>wanted to check in early the morning in</p>
<p>an infant actually everything works then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in if it doesn&rsquo;t work then you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in yet so I just want to let</p>
<p>you know that I&rsquo;ve been really behind</p>
<p>the scenes trying to get this thing out</p>
<p>for a long time so so the good news is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have it in tomorrow is a 99.99%</p>
<p>chance and the bad news is it&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>bit more expensive but the good news is</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to pay that because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>giving you a discount so anyway this is</p>
<p>a good product to take for your liver</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best anti-aging because it</p>
<p>fortifies the inside of the body and it</p>
<p>also protects against a lot of different</p>
<p>types of conditions that people are at</p>
<p>risk just from the pollution in the</p>
<p>environment so so now what I want to do</p>
<p>is I want to give you a link and a code</p>
<p>coupon code you can just highlight that</p>
<p>coupon code and just yeah just save it</p>
<p>for tomorrow and you can go to my</p>
<p>website and get a discount you get as</p>
<p>many as you want</p>
<p>I I will be increasing lean the prices</p>
<p>already increase but if you use that</p>
<p>discount which is going to be good for</p>
<p>the next three days I know it says the</p>
<p>offer ends in one hour but that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>true because I don&rsquo;t even have the</p>
<p>product in so no worries on that okay</p>
<p>now if you are watching this as a</p>
<p>webinar replay just realize I already</p>
<p>have it in okay because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have it in by tomorrow for sure</p>
<p>um someone says can I piggyback on</p>
<p>auto-ship order with my wheatgrass juice</p>
<p>yes I think you could do that but you</p>
<p>may want to call my office with that</p>
<p>how long is to keep an offer for the</p>
<p>next three days how long is the</p>
<p>shelf-life</p>
<p>the shelf-life is is good for a year but</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually longer than that</p>
<p>but we we tell people a year at the</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re being very conservative</p>
<p>mm-hmm someone says don&rsquo;t go to</p>
<p>commercial I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>commercial don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m just good</p>
<p>people asking me I&rsquo;m giving them a</p>
<p>discount um can you provide the price of</p>
<p>the hoaxers food yeah</p>
<p>the price was thirty thirty 4.95 now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 39.95 but there&rsquo;s two hundred and</p>
<p>fifty capsules in there um but the</p>
<p>problem is that the the price trying to</p>
<p>get these ingredients is off the charts</p>
<p>even if you go look for a cruciferous</p>
<p>product it&rsquo;s hard to find um all these</p>
<p>cruciferous and you may find them like</p>
<p>in like broccoli or something like that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s only like 90 pills and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably it&rsquo;s going to be the same it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like thirty dollars it&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s it is a good a good program with</p>
<p>with the quantity that you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>into quality as well if you shift</p>
<p>candidate yes do they lose any vitamins</p>
<p>when they are processed um well you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to lose that much with the</p>
<p>processing but if you keep them in the</p>
<p>heat they keep it open you may even want</p>
<p>to keep in the fridge to have them last</p>
<p>a lot longer</p>
<p>what is the dosage how many pills per</p>
<p>day it depends if you want to make</p>
<p>maintenance dose I would take three but</p>
<p>if you want to correct something you</p>
<p>want to take six personally this is just</p>
<p>my own opinion if I had cancer I would</p>
<p>take 15 a day</p>
<p>Wow I&rsquo;ve had a lot of people that just</p>
<p>take them for weight loss but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just because it improves the</p>
<p>the the fat release on the liver and it</p>
<p>allows the liver to function better</p>
<p>which is really connected to actually a</p>
<p>thyroid being working better but so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t actually burn fat by itself um</p>
<p>what if you have a thyroid problem well</p>
<p>we have seek help in there so you have</p>
<p>the I then that&rsquo;s not going to be a</p>
<p>problem is it safe to take if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pregnant absolutely because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing else but those</p>
<p>ingredients can I give it to my toddler</p>
<p>depends if he&rsquo;s like 1 or older just</p>
<p>give them maybe one a day but of course</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a baby you&rsquo;re not going to give</p>
<p>him that unless he can swallow capsules</p>
<p>yeah so so anyway I covered a lot of</p>
<p>data a lot of information I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>send everyone a link to all these slides</p>
<p>because I have a lot of references that</p>
<p>you can see and I will send it out</p>
<p>probably a little bit later on probably</p>
<p>in the middle of a night you&rsquo;ll go go to</p>
<p>you and that way you can see the webinar</p>
<p>I mean all the slides and I&rsquo;ll send you</p>
<p>the webinar replay too if you want that</p>
<p>but I want you to apply some of the</p>
<p>information that I shared tonight and I</p>
<p>want to thank Leslie for being onto</p>
<p>sharing her story of the wonderful</p>
<p>example of trying to get some help of</p>
<p>treating one person at our once</p>
<p>condition and time so thank thank you</p>

<p>another seminar and this one&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be on energy and it&rsquo;s going to be really</p>
<p>awesome I&rsquo;m going to cover the topic on</p>
