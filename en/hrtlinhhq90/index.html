<p>﻿hey everyone welcome back i have a a guest 
that i&rsquo;m gonna interview today special guest  </p>
<p>actually she works for me and christie is here 
hi christy hi hey listen the reason i&rsquo;m bringing  </p>
<p>you up is because um you had or you may still 
have uh diabetes type one and i wanna know a  </p>
<p>little bit about your story so tell us about your 
story okay uh so i have was i led a normal life  </p>
<p>most of my life you know up until my second 
child my daughter uh during that pregnancy  </p>
<p>i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and um i 
was immediately put on insulin because managing it  </p>
<p>was very difficult with diet it was unmanageable 
with diet so they put me on insulin very quickly  </p>
<p>and then they gave me the typical you 
know reduce your carbs but i was still  </p>
<p>recommended to eat like 20 to 30 grams 
of carbs a meal um so that really wasn&rsquo;t  </p>
<p>working i was using a lot of insulin and 
then i had my daughter teagan and they just  </p>
<p>assumed i went back to normal and of course 
like i wanted to go back to normal so i just  </p>
<p>said okay i&rsquo;m normal and i went back to 
doing everything that i was doing before  </p>
<p>i stopped the medication and stuff and then um 
about a year after i had her i started to notice  </p>
<p>symptoms like i was losing a lot of weight i 
wasn&rsquo;t really like watching my diet either so that  </p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really make sense for me and i was very 
tired i was urinating frequently so i just decided  </p>
<p>one day to check my blood sugars because i had 
the stuff from when i was pregnant and uh when i  </p>
<p>checked i was like 450 or something like crazy oh 
my god so um i immediately knew i was a diabetic  </p>
<p>and i just assumed that i was a type 2 because 
i didn&rsquo;t know anything about diabetes so when  </p>
<p>i went to the doctor they also assumed that 
because my mom and my dad and in my family  </p>
<p>so um that&rsquo;s what they diagnosed me with with type 
2 diabetes and they gave me metformin and told me  </p>
<p>to lower my diet which um i did i was very strict 
low carb the way i thought i should be doing it um  </p>
<p>and nothing was you know i was still high and 
then you know fast forward a couple months we go  </p>
<p>off the grid so we&rsquo;re traveling in our rv it&rsquo;s 
very hard to keep fresh fruits and vegetables  </p>
<p>so um i kind of just started not caring i i was 
like well my mom and my grandma are still alive so  </p>
<p>who cares you know i didn&rsquo;t i didn&rsquo;t really think 
so i just stopped managing it basically i would  </p>
<p>every once in a while check my blood sugars and 
i was high and i would treat it with some insulin  </p>
<p>it was just a very dangerous you know thing that i 
was doing and then um we settled down in missouri  </p>
<p>and i started noticing like the frequent urination 
the um i was always tired i was also starting to  </p>
<p>not be able to feel my feet and my hand 
my tongue i was having spots in my eyes so  </p>
<p>i realized it was really important to get serious 
about it and i started doing some research  </p>
<p>and um i found keto as a way to reverse the type 
2. so i thought about it but i didn&rsquo;t do it you  </p>
<p>know and then i went to the doctor they said 
your a1c is 10 and a half you need to start using  </p>
<p>insulin and that&rsquo;s when i left that appointment i 
was like i knew insulin makes you gain weight and  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always been something i&rsquo;ve been concerned 
about so at that point i said i&rsquo;m going to  </p>
<p>do something different and i found like so 
you your a1c was 10 10 point something okay  </p>
<p>yeah okay because normal edge should be like five 
point five yeah okay right right it was very very  </p>
<p>high and uh that&rsquo;s when they were like we&rsquo;ve got 
to do meal time insulin and all of this and i was  </p>
<p>like no no you know i&rsquo;m too young i don&rsquo;t want to 
do that so i started to do the healthy keto and  </p>
<p>doing more research i found doctors like dr you 
dr berg and then dr fung on the type 2 and how  </p>
<p>if you change what you&rsquo;re eating and intermittent 
fast you can reduce that so i was super excited  </p>
<p>i was ready to do it my husband got on board 
with me and um then i stopped doing the insulin  </p>
<p>because i thought i checked with my doctor they 
said you are definitely a type 2 so go ahead and  </p>
<p>give it a try so i did that and um then i 
also cheated a little bit so i got really  </p>
<p>into ketosis and then i did i went and saw 
some friends in st louis and started to  </p>
<p>i for that one meal i just went overboard so i was 
like in the 500s after that meal and i never came  </p>
<p>back down and i ended up going into dka because 
i was in st louis without my insulin and dka  </p>
<p>oh is diabetic ketoacidosis yeah so that&rsquo;s a 
situation where you have this very very high  </p>
<p>blood sugar and very low insulin because you&rsquo;re 
not taking it and your ph becomes very acidic it  </p>
<p>can be very dangerous and that never occurs 
unless you&rsquo;re you have type one or you have  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not you&rsquo;re not controlling your blood 
sugars but go ahead right and my i did end up um  </p>
<p>i went to the emergency room because i went a few 
days thinking i had the flu and then i got to the  </p>
<p>point where i was unable to breathe and and that&rsquo;s 
when i went to the emergency room and they uh  </p>
<p>in the hospital they put me in the icu and in the 
hospital they were trying to give me insulin and  </p>
<p>i was like no i don&rsquo;t want that stuff like i 
don&rsquo;t need it i&rsquo;m a type 2. and they were like  </p>
<p>looking at me i&rsquo;m 91 pounds and they&rsquo;re like no 
like your blood sugars are way too high for you  </p>
<p>being in a fasting state you need insulin and they 
came and they told me you&rsquo;re a type 1 diabetic  </p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to do all the tests to confirm 
that but that&rsquo;s our belief so that was like  </p>
<p>a really hard thing to process um and then 
when i i left the hospital i still knew  </p>
<p>i was going to do low carb because i didn&rsquo;t want 
to be doing a lot of insulin and um so that&rsquo;s just  </p>
<p>what i&rsquo;ve been doing so within it within six 
months my a1c went from 10 and a half to 6.3  </p>
<p>and then uh by the year i was at 5.5 and i 
think when i go i&rsquo;m gonna go in february again  </p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll probably be a little higher because like 
some things have happened stress i did like fall  </p>
<p>off a little bit and i allow things in you know 
sometimes when i shouldn&rsquo;t so i do think my a1c  </p>
<p>is probably closer to six now um but i&rsquo;m jumping 
back in i you know things have settled down with  </p>
<p>the stress actually just a you know the stress 
is my my mom uh she&rsquo;s a type two uh but we think  </p>
<p>maybe she might be a type one but we you know but 
she&rsquo;s a type two and not managing her blood sugar  </p>
<p>so she actually was found unconscious in a coma 
and she was in that state for quite some time  </p>
<p>so that really like at that moment stressed me 
out and i did some cheating but now it&rsquo;s kind  </p>
<p>of really like seeing her recovery how slow it is 
she&rsquo;s needing a lot of assistance a lot of therapy  </p>
<p>and she needs people to care for her she&rsquo;s been 
stuck in the hospital where they&rsquo;re not managing  </p>
<p>her diabetes well at all which is making it 
worse and it just reminded me like why i&rsquo;m  </p>
<p>doing what i&rsquo;m doing i don&rsquo;t want to do that 
to my family i don&rsquo;t want to do that to myself  </p>
<p>so when i&rsquo;m doing low carb i get to 
use such little amounts of insulin that  </p>
<p>concern is really not present you know if i do go 
low it&rsquo;s very easily corrected so um that&rsquo;s you  </p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s kind of my story and why i&rsquo;m doing it 
i started an instagram page and then just finding  </p>
<p>this job because you know nobody wants to hear you 
talk about keto but i get to do it all day long  </p>
<p>you know so i just feel so blessed because you did 
that&rsquo;s the other part my kidneys were failing and  </p>
<p>they wanted to put me on medication and i knew 
based on like the videos i&rsquo;d watched from you  </p>
<p>you know making sure i have plenty of potassium 
in my diet that i would be able to protect my  </p>
<p>kidneys and reverse it and i and now my kidney 
function is completely normal wow i&rsquo;m happy with  </p>
<p>this and i don&rsquo;t have anything that is so awesome 
so uh what christy does uh she&rsquo;s actually one of  </p>
<p>my keto consultants so she helps people on the 
phone she answer questions and you have a lot of  </p>
<p>personal experience so that is so valuable 
question i have a couple questions number one  </p>
<p>when you are pregnant did you just have regular 
carbo meals what did you eat while you&rsquo;re pregnant  </p>
<p>with the trigger of this 
whole in the beginning i just  </p>
<p>yeah in the beginning i was just eating normal 
what was that like carbo food i mean fast food  </p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t a big cooker i and i was very tired with 
that pregnancy so and i think that might have been  </p>
<p>because also i got diagnosed during that pregnancy 
with hypothyroidism or the hashimoto&rsquo;s so um i was  </p>
<p>really tired and then i got really sick too so 
i was very lazy i you know it was frozen pizzas  </p>
<p>taco bell you know fast food it was not healthy at 
all but then when they told me about the diabetes  </p>
<p>i did try very hard but i was doing things like 
toast and peanut butter thinking that was good for  </p>
<p>me and it wasn&rsquo;t wow this this is what so so i&rsquo;m 
so interested in creating more videos on what to  </p>
<p>eat while you&rsquo;re pregnant because so many women 
they don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a big deal but oh my gosh  </p>
<p>it can be a huge deal um not just for yourself but 
you know you&rsquo;re carrying a baby um so so presently  </p>
<p>right now um you still have to take insulin 
but you&rsquo;re not taking as much to control things  </p>
<p>oh my gosh it&rsquo;s so little yes i mean i do and when 
i&rsquo;m really getting into it and i&rsquo;m adding workouts  </p>
<p>i get down to i mean total and this is long 
lasting and meal time insulin i&rsquo;m doing like  </p>
<p>at max six units a day so um that&rsquo;s like so little 
yeah and when you think about all the money that  </p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saving you know and the you&rsquo;re also saving 
yourself from further health complications because  </p>
<p>you know industrial size doses of insulin are 
not good for our bodies whether you&rsquo;re a type one  </p>
<p>or not you know we we may need it but we 
don&rsquo;t need that much though right and so  </p>
<p>this is another good point i want to mention is 
the um the complications of high blood glucose  </p>
<p>are kind of similar to the complications of high 
levels of insulin so and the more carbs you have  </p>
<p>the more insulin you have to take so why even go 
that direction because the high insulin is going  </p>
<p>to create some problems too and and also where 
is the carbs going when you take insulin are they  </p>
<p>just evaporating now they&rsquo;re actually being shoved 
in different places in your body and converted to  </p>
<p>different things um what what would you say that 
a normal type 1 diabetic how much insulin are they  </p>
<p>taking per day do you have any idea so i would um 
yeah because i follow some people on instagram and  </p>
<p>i i mean and just going from what i was taking 
before i changed my diet and then even currently  </p>
<p>if i do have a pizza pizza um you know i have to 
take 20 units of mealtime insulin and that still  </p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cover it or it it&rsquo;s too much and then i 
have a low that&rsquo;s scary you know so um i would  </p>
<p>say like they would be doing 50 plus units a day 
and it probably just increases over time because  </p>
<p>uh you know the insulin resistance is taking 
place you know and then it&rsquo;s funny because my  </p>
<p>doc one of my the nutritionist uh at my doctor&rsquo;s 
office when i went i was like well my a1c is 5.5  </p>
<p>because she was trying to you know fix my diet and 
i was like i got it you know i know what to eat  </p>
<p>and i was like my a1c is 5.5 and she was like oh 
well that will probably creep up over time because  </p>
<p>your pancreas is gonna stop working even more and 
i&rsquo;m like no it&rsquo;s pretty much done working you know  </p>
<p>like this is this is if it goes up it&rsquo;s because 
of my diet and i know i&rsquo;m ready for it i&rsquo;m gonna  </p>
<p>be disappointed in myself but i know it&rsquo;s gone 
up a little bit because of that period of time  </p>
<p>and i just want to add the reason not cheating 
is is so important it&rsquo;s not just that like okay  </p>
<p>yes in a moment my blood sugar was 300. it was 
hard to undo that cheat you know i i did it in one  </p>
<p>moment thinking oh i&rsquo;m just gonna eat whatever i 
want right now because i&rsquo;m so stressed and then i  </p>
<p>wanted to do it the next day and then i wanted to 
do it the next day and it&rsquo;s so hard to break that  </p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like once you get that momentum i was 
at 5.5 like i i don&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;ll go back again  </p>
<p>regardless of my stress because it&rsquo;s not worth it 
like it just takes so long and like you said the  </p>
<p>sugar doesn&rsquo;t just evaporate it gets put places 
and it takes me like a week to see that completely  </p>
<p>out of my body even when i&rsquo;m eating healthy my 
blood sugars are higher because i&rsquo;m getting rid of  </p>
<p>all the other the sugar that i ate you know that 
it stuffed in my liver and so yeah you know that&rsquo;s  </p>
<p>why i always i always tell people it&rsquo;s actually 
good to go off the program just just to experience  </p>
<p>this because that way you know you can actually 
have judgment so no one&rsquo;s like telling you you  </p>
<p>have to do this but you you know how your 
body works you know if i actually go off  </p>
<p>the program it&rsquo;s not going to be off for a couple 
hours you&rsquo;re talking about days yeah just a little  </p>
<p>bit and this is also for the average person 
that&rsquo;s trying to lose weight so i think for  </p>
<p>me i was a junk food junkie in my 20s i&rsquo;m 30 now 
so that good that&rsquo;s good so what happened is um i  </p>
<p>uh i was so bad but it took me it took me years to 
change my ways because i had to keep experiencing  </p>
<p>this painful side effects and consequences to 
finally says okay that&rsquo;s it i&rsquo;m going to actually  </p>
<p>have discipline now but i think some some people 
you know they have to learn on their own and  </p>
<p>then they have this shift of like you know what 
okay i&rsquo;m going to do it now for real so and you  </p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really tell people that you can encourage 
them but they have to kind of go through this  </p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;m like okay go off the program see how you 
do and then exactly why is it taking so long to  </p>
<p>get back on the track well yeah it&rsquo;s an addiction 
it really is an addiction and and it like pops in  </p>
<p>your head you know like you have it one day and 
the next day now you&rsquo;re like oh i want that again  </p>
<p>and i want to win you know and it really is 
it&rsquo;s a addiction so i&rsquo;m i think like just  </p>
<p>seeing everything that&rsquo;s going on with my mom like 
firsthand i&rsquo;ve heard you know i&rsquo;ve heard people  </p>
<p>experience that but dealing with it myself and 
seeing how frustrating it is right when i was in  </p>
<p>dka i had the ability to tell them what i wanted 
but she can&rsquo;t you know she&rsquo;s unable to communicate  </p>
<p>how to manage her diabetes not that she was doing 
it great you know obviously right but um you know  </p>
<p>now that i&rsquo;m involved i&rsquo;m gonna try to help 
her and i just feel like i got there too late  </p>
<p>but this is where we are and it really hasn&rsquo;t 
opened my eyes to say okay the cheats are not  </p>
<p>good anymore like i&rsquo;m done i don&rsquo;t want to do 
it anymore i don&rsquo;t and and i&rsquo;ve been feeling  </p>
<p>great so i&rsquo;m gonna i&rsquo;m seeing the course so i&rsquo;m 
curious um when i broke my elbow demolished it  </p>
<p>shattered it i had to go to the hospital 
to get surgery so uh so i get in there and  </p>
<p>then i&rsquo;m like wait a second i didn&rsquo;t bring my 
food with me and of course they i wake up and  </p>
<p>they have crackers jello pudding and i&rsquo;m asking 
for some protein or something and they&rsquo;re like  </p>
<p>looking at me strange now i&rsquo;m curious if 
you&rsquo;re a diabetic and you&rsquo;re in the hospital  </p>
<p>um is there any any shift of anything other than 
the same thing it&rsquo;s so bad dr berg okay because  </p>
<p>for the diabetic diet right they knew i was 
a diabetic they brought me biscuits and gravy  </p>
<p>and i was i said to the guy when he was handing 
it to me i said this is not low carb and i was  </p>
<p>like i just want eggs with cheese and bacon like 
that&rsquo;s all i want i don&rsquo;t want the biscuits in the  </p>
<p>gravy and he&rsquo;s like oh well the biscuits see and 
they&rsquo;re only three grams of carb i was like what  </p>
<p>world are you living in right now you know like 
no just i don&rsquo;t know who typed this sticker up  </p>
<p>but no i&rsquo;m going to tell you right now doctor like 
this is not three grams of carbs this is like 50  </p>
<p>or 60 grams of carbs and it&rsquo;s gonna spike me i&rsquo;m 
not eating it and um i had to tell them but still  </p>
<p>with my mom she was unconscious they were just 
giving her this feeding tube which you know that  </p>
<p>stuff is terrible and then when she did start 
eating they were giving her pancakes spaghetti  </p>
<p>toast bagels and no matter what i said to them on 
the phone they just kept doing it and she ended up  </p>
<p>with serious lows in the hospital going low with 
in the hospital&rsquo;s hair how is that even possible  </p>
<p>and i know and they&rsquo;re also dosing her after 
her meal so they&rsquo;re chasing the high which is  </p>
<p>very dangerous because the blood sugar will 
lower on its own you know after it raises so  </p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a very d it seems so contradictory 
you&rsquo;re supposed to be there and they&rsquo;re supposed  </p>
<p>to care for you and you can&rsquo;t trust that anymore 
you have to be able to advocate for yourself</p>
<p>incredible so um anyway i wanted to say one last 
thing um and for those of you that are watching  </p>
<p>you definitely need to um we can actually give 
you the right eating plan so i&rsquo;ll put a link  </p>
<p>down below and um so this is what i wanted to 
tell you i stumbled on your blog which is a  </p>
<p>fascinating blog it&rsquo;s actually off it&rsquo;s called 
off the grid what off the grid street and uh  </p>
<p>so you basically you have you do videos of like 
you guys are living i guess it&rsquo;s a farm isn&rsquo;t it  </p>
<p>well we&rsquo;re trying to start it you know we&rsquo;re 
trying it&rsquo;s very slow going again this job has  </p>
<p>been such a blessing for our family because i 
don&rsquo;t have to leave the home to do my job so  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s helping a lot with the progress so right 
now we&rsquo;re focusing on building our tiny house  </p>
<p>um we will get some more chickens and we do want 
our own farm we want to be able to make our own  </p>
<p>food and um be self-sustainable that&rsquo;s our goal 
so it&rsquo;s been slow going sometimes it gets a little  </p>
<p>you know defeating so but we&rsquo;re still pushing 
forward and i&rsquo;m so excited that you saw our video  </p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so cool oh yeah i was watching all sorts
