    <p>Our card this week is Katie Memory Jones, the five of clubs from North Carolina.</p>
<p>In 2016, Katie was walking home from a night out with friends enjoying one of the last</p>
<p>warm nights of the year when something bad happened that has haunted her friends and</p>
<p>family for years and has left investigators puzzled to this day.</p>
<p>Now law enforcement is providing new details about Katie&rsquo;s case, hoping that someone</p>
<p>with information will come forward and justice can finally be served.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was October 15th, 2016, about 2.40 in the morning in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
<p>A man who we&rsquo;ll call Joe was still awake watching TV in his living room when all of</p>
<p>a sudden he heard some loud noises outside.</p>
<p>They were either gunshots or fireworks, Joe wasn&rsquo;t sure.</p>
<p>But then a loud alarm started going off, and the alarm was too loud and too close for</p>
<p>Joe to ignore, so he went outside to see what was going on.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Joe, as he was walking toward the sound of the blaring alarm to investigate,</p>
<p>other worried neighbors who&rsquo;d also heard those concerning noises were alerting police.</p>
<p>Charlotte, max number 9-1-1, do you need police, fire, or medic?</p>
<p>Police?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not at our home.</p>
<p>We can hear it from our home.</p>
<p>I just heard a gunshot, voices, and an alarm going off, and a scream.</p>
<p>You said an alarm?</p>
<p>An alarm, a gunshot, voices, a scream.</p>
<p>As that 9-1-1 call was being placed, Joe was walking up on a scene that he would never</p>
<p>forget.</p>
<p>He had followed the alarm sound to Berry Hill Realty, which housed its office in a former</p>
<p>home in Joe&rsquo;s neighborhood.</p>
<p>His heart started to race when he spotted a young 20-something woman on the ground.</p>
<p>At first, he thought maybe the woman had been drunk and just passed out in the driveway</p>
<p>of the business.</p>
<p>I mean, after all, it was 2.40 in the morning, and it wasn&rsquo;t totally uncommon in Charlotte&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Plaza Midwood neighborhood because it&rsquo;s within walking distance of some late-night bars.</p>
<p>But then, Joe saw a pool of blood on the sidewalk, so that&rsquo;s when he called 9-1-1.</p>
<p>Charlotte, max number 9-1-1, do you need police, fire, or medic?</p>
<p>Police and medic.</p>
<p>Somebody is laid out here.</p>
<p>There is blood.</p>
<p>I have not checked her yet, but I heard a loud noise.</p>
<p>I came outside of 2-0-21.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an alarm going off at this real estate agent in the corner, and she is laid out in</p>
<p>the parking lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to move her, but she is face down, and there is blood.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s name is redacted from the report, so Joe is a pseudonym.</p>
<p>Within two minutes of that 9-1-1 call, first responders started to show up.</p>
<p>The first responders immediately noticed the woman had been shot in the chest, and she</p>
<p>was bleeding out.</p>
<p>They also noticed some superficial injuries, scratches on her cheek, her elbow, her hip,</p>
<p>and one of her fingers.</p>
<p>Immediately, officers wondered if the injuries were from the woman fighting off her attacker,</p>
<p>or if she&rsquo;d hurt herself in the fall after she was shot.</p>
<p>Now, the woman was still alive, but barely.</p>
<p>And though she was rushed to a hospital, she was pronounced dead not long after she arrived.</p>
<p>Officers that stayed behind at the scene called crime scene investigators to come process</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But there wasn&rsquo;t much evidence to collect.</p>
<p>One of the only items left behind was a crossbody purse the woman had been wearing when she</p>
<p>had been shot.</p>
<p>Inside was $300 cash, some business cards for a nearby restaurant, a bottle of pink</p>
<p>pepper spray, a deck of cards, and the woman&rsquo;s ID, which read Katie Memory Jones, date of</p>
<p>birth December 19, 1989.</p>
<p>She was 26.</p>
<p>Since there was no mystery around who the woman was, police got to work right away trying</p>
<p>to talk to Katie&rsquo;s friends and family members.</p>
<p>Not only did they need to break the horrible news that Katie had been murdered, but they</p>
<p>needed help piecing together what she had been up to before she was killed, and if anyone</p>
<p>knew who could have done it.</p>
<p>So they headed to the address that was listed on Katie&rsquo;s ID, which was not even a mile</p>
<p>from where she&rsquo;d been murdered.</p>
<p>It was around 7.30 in the morning on Saturday when they got to her house.</p>
<p>Police knocked on the door a few times, but there was no answer.</p>
<p>Now police later learned that Katie did have a male roommate who friends say she was acquaintances</p>
<p>with, but he didn&rsquo;t come to the door.</p>
<p>Since police weren&rsquo;t able to make contact with anyone at Katie&rsquo;s house or gain entry</p>
<p>to look around inside, they went to the restaurant listed on the business cards that were found</p>
<p>in her purse, Midwood Smokehouse, which was just right around the corner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Katie worked, and some of her co-workers confirmed that she had worked that</p>
<p>Friday night.</p>
<p>They said that she worked her full shift, nothing weird happened, and after work Katie</p>
<p>met up with some friends at a dive bar called Midwood Country Club, also in the Plaza Midwood</p>
<p>neighborhood.</p>
<p>So detectives decided to track down some of Katie&rsquo;s friends who all knew each other</p>
<p>by working in the service industry.</p>
<p>There was a group of about six or seven of them who regularly met up for a drink after</p>
<p>their shifts ended.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Matt Hefner with the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department, who our reporters</p>
<p>interviewed for this episode.</p>
<p>Is working the case today?</p>
<p>Katie was popular.</p>
<p>She had lots of friends.</p>
<p>She knew folks from work and hung out with folks from work and folks that she had formerly</p>
<p>worked with.</p>
<p>Just a kind of a happy-go-lucky personality.</p>
<p>Katie&rsquo;s friends were shocked by the news of her murder.</p>
<p>They said the night before they had all been out and had a good time at Midwood Country</p>
<p>Club.</p>
<p>They said Katie had nursed one cocktail the whole night, and they all stayed until the</p>
<p>bartender closed up well after 2 a.m.</p>
<p>By the time the group of friends was in the parking lot saying their goodbyes and popping</p>
<p>into their cars, it was about 2.30 in the morning.</p>
<p>Midwood Country Club was just a mile away from the house Katie was renting at the time,</p>
<p>so she said she was just going to walk home.</p>
<p>She loved walking, and she loved doing it no matter what time of day or night it was.</p>
<p>Now friends did offer to give Katie a ride.</p>
<p>In a report done by Charlotte Magazine in 2017, one of Katie&rsquo;s friends who was there</p>
<p>that night was quoted, saying that they would offer Katie a ride home as a courtesy even</p>
<p>though they knew that their offer would be declined.</p>
<p>The friend said, quote,</p>
<p>We always offered.</p>
<p>She never wanted a ride.</p>
<p>She loved to walk the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Any of us wouldn&rsquo;t have thought twice about walking before all this happened.</p>
<p>Up until her, there was no reason not to walk home.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Everyone said she would have felt safe.</p>
<p>This was something she regularly walked.</p>
<p>This was not the first time she&rsquo;d been at Midwood Country Club and not the first time</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d walked home from Midwood Country Club.</p>
<p>The Plaza-Midwood area was an up-and-coming, artsy sort of neighborhood where you could</p>
<p>work, live, and play all within a one or two mile radius.</p>
<p>But despite this general feeling of safety, Katie wasn&rsquo;t naive.</p>
<p>Friends said that she always carried with her a pink bottle of pepper spray in case</p>
<p>anything were to ever happen.</p>
<p>It was the same pink bottle of pepper spray found in her purse at the crime scene.</p>
<p>As the investigation was starting out, detectives were considering all types of theories.</p>
<p>Someone could have been laying in wait for Katie.</p>
<p>Did she have enemies, any vengeful ex-boyfriends, or could it have been an attempted robbery</p>
<p>that turned fatal?</p>
<p>That theory perplexed officers, though, since Katie had cash in her purse when she was found.</p>
<p>Whatever the motive may have been, detectives knew that what had happened to Katie happened</p>
<p>on that walk home.</p>
<p>So they began gathering surveillance footage from the area.</p>
<p>They recovered footage of nearly every step of Katie&rsquo;s walk that night, but unfortunately</p>
<p>none of the footage showed the actual murder take place.</p>
<p>The videos show Katie dancing along the sidewalks, enjoying some cool late-night air.</p>
<p>She was even messaging a group of friends during her walk, sending them pictures of</p>
<p>things that she passed along her route.</p>
<p>According to police, Katie made it about halfway home before she was shot and killed.</p>
<p>And even though detectives couldn&rsquo;t find footage of her actual murder, some surveillance</p>
<p>video from across the street where Katie was killed does show something else.</p>
<p>Something that could help lead police to a suspect.</p>
<p>Video surveillance shows a car pull up and stop right beside where Katie&rsquo;s body was</p>
<p>found, in front of Berry Hill Realty.</p>
<p>Detectives have reviewed this footage of what they believe is the killer&rsquo;s car hundreds</p>
<p>of times since her death in 2016.</p>
<p>It looks like a car is kind of riding up to the area Katie walked into.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see Katie, but you can see the headlights.</p>
<p>And then you can see those headlights appear to reverse and go backwards a little bit.</p>
<p>The headlights go off.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see the car.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see Katie.</p>
<p>Detective Heffner gave us a copy of the surveillance footage, which you can see on thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>The video is 30 minutes long and at about the 16-minute mark, when the time stamp hits</p>
<p>2.46 a.m., Katie walks into frame.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a little hard to see.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s all the way at the other side of the road.</p>
<p>And the only thing you can really tell is that she&rsquo;s walking at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>She walks to the corner of the Plaza and Hamorton Place, hangs a left on Hamorton, and then</p>
<p>disappears into the night.</p>
<p>Like Detective Heffner said, after a few seconds, headlights come into frame for a moment when</p>
<p>the time stamp is at 2.47.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on Hamorton Place, right next to the area Katie&rsquo;s body was found.</p>
<p>After sitting there for a moment, the car appears to reverse.</p>
<p>And by the time the clock hits 2.48, the headlights can no longer be seen.</p>
<p>So this car appears and then disappears, all within a span of about 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Detective Heffner said that the time stamps on the video were actually a few minutes off.</p>
<p>So instead of all this happening between 2.47 and 2.48 a.m., as the video indicates, it</p>
<p>actually took place around 2.42 and 2.43, and it was 2.44 a.m. when the first 911 call</p>
<p>came in about the alarm going off and a possible gunshot.</p>
<p>So detectives were sure that Katie had to have been shot within a few seconds of when</p>
<p>those headlights were seen on the surveillance footage.</p>
<p>Then a little more than 30 seconds after the headlights disappear on the video, you can</p>
<p>see a car speed away from the area.</p>
<p>The car fails to stop at the intersection and continues out of frame.</p>
<p>Now this is where some people have differing opinions.</p>
<p>Some internet sleuths and YouTubers who&rsquo;ve examined the case, including popular YouTuber</p>
<p>John Lorden, believe that the headlights seen in the video and the car driving away 30 seconds</p>
<p>later are different vehicles.</p>
<p>After all, the headlights do disappear for a few moments, and the surveillance footage</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t definitively prove that it&rsquo;s the same car.</p>
<p>But for detectives, there is little question about this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re confident that the headlights seen in the surveillance video and the car driving</p>
<p>away a few seconds later are one in the same, and it&rsquo;s because of the car&rsquo;s behavior as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s driving away from the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>Again the car failed to stop at the stop sign as it came to the intersection.</p>
<p>And listen, you might be thinking like, big deal, it&rsquo;s super early in the morning and</p>
<p>there probably aren&rsquo;t a lot of cars out.</p>
<p>But Detective Heffner said that that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>He said that this intersection is a busy one, even at 2.40 in the morning, and not one where</p>
<p>you would want to run a stop sign, unless of course you were fleeing the scene of a crime.</p>
<p>But despite having what&rsquo;s believed to be the suspect&rsquo;s car on video, police haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been able to determine what kind of car it is.</p>
<p>The footage isn&rsquo;t the highest quality, and the view of the car is obscured by trees and posts.</p>
<p>Detectives know that it was a tan or silver sedan, but unfortunately it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>to determine the car&rsquo;s maker model.</p>
<p>After Katie&rsquo;s murder hit the news on Sunday, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department</p>
<p>received several tips that seemed promising.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for detectives to learn that Katie had pepper sprayed a man on Central</p>
<p>Avenue just a few weeks before she was murdered.</p>
<p>After learning about this, they actually tracked the man down for questioning, but the only</p>
<p>thing Detective Heffner would tell our team about the interview was that he was ruled</p>
<p>out as a suspect in Katie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>And in fact, the more police learned, the less likely it seemed that she&rsquo;d ever encountered</p>
<p>her killer before.</p>
<p>The theory that this might have been a random robbery attempt was looking more and more</p>
<p>likely because they couldn&rsquo;t find one person who disliked Katie at all or had any beef</p>
<p>with her.</p>
<p>Katie was from North Carolina.</p>
<p>She was born in Asheville.</p>
<p>And according to an article in Charlotte Magazine, Katie&rsquo;s father died when she was a child.</p>
<p>After that, her family moved around a bit and eventually landed in Charlotte.</p>
<p>After Katie graduated high school in 2008, she moved to New York City to attend Marymount</p>
<p>Manhattan College, where she studied theater design.</p>
<p>But with the high cost of living and tuition, Katie ran out of funds after three semesters</p>
<p>and returned to Charlotte in 2010.</p>
<p>And in 2012, she made the move to the Plaza Midwood neighborhood.</p>
<p>Her friends say that she loved living in an area of town where everything was within walking</p>
<p>distance.</p>
<p>She was drawn to the artsy, offbeat aura of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>It was a place that Katie felt like she could just be herself and that she wouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>judged for what she wore or how she acted or whatever vibrant color she would dye her</p>
<p>hair next.</p>
<p>In a report done by the Charlotte Observer in 2016, Katie&rsquo;s mother, Javonna Livingston,</p>
<p>spoke about the kind of person her daughter was.</p>
<p>She said, quote, from the very moment she was born, she burst into the world ready to</p>
<p>live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>She naturally brought laughter and smiles to everyone, end quote.</p>
<p>Detective Heffner described Katie as a free spirit.</p>
<p>She loved people and loved animals.</p>
<p>Katie had two dogs and two cats and loved taking in strays.</p>
<p>Her friends said that back in high school, she even took in an injured squirrel and brought</p>
<p>it with her to school.</p>
<p>Katie&rsquo;s Facebook profile is still up.</p>
<p>And just by looking through her posts, it&rsquo;s easy to see what a fun loving, spunky and</p>
<p>kind hearted person she was.</p>
<p>Scrolling through her pictures, her love for animals is obvious.</p>
<p>She posted so many photos of dogs and cats, but she posted even more pictures of her friends.</p>
<p>Dozens of images of her friends camping, eating and just hanging out fill her Facebook photos.</p>
<p>In most murders, everybody&rsquo;s got a mama, everybody&rsquo;s got a brother, a dad, a family that cares.</p>
<p>But sometimes you run into an issue where beyond that, you don&rsquo;t have a lot of people</p>
<p>who are really involved.</p>
<p>In this case, the family&rsquo;s really involved.</p>
<p>All the friends are really involved.</p>
<p>The business was really involved.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to help.</p>
<p>Detective Heffner said that in most investigations, detectives quickly start hitting roadblocks.</p>
<p>People who won&rsquo;t cooperate.</p>
<p>But with Katie&rsquo;s murder, everyone investigators could track down just wanted to help.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what made this case such a big newsworthy case, is you have so many people</p>
<p>who cared about Katie, who liked Katie, who wanted to solve this crime.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not always that way in a murder.</p>
<p>Despite Katie&rsquo;s friends, family and co-workers trying to help in any way they could, the</p>
<p>Investigation was going nowhere just a few weeks after her murder.</p>
<p>Police had no eyewitnesses and very little physical evidence.</p>
<p>All they really had to work with was some low quality surveillance footage and a community</p>
<p>that was longing to see Katie&rsquo;s murderer brought to justice.</p>
<p>Days turned into weeks, weeks to months, and there was little movement in her case.</p>
<p>Police continued to investigate, but they didn&rsquo;t even know if they were looking for</p>
<p>one assailant or two.</p>
<p>I mean, there could have been a driver and a separate shooter.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of evidence, detectives did their best to keep the case moving.</p>
<p>They continued looking at the surveillance footage, trying to piece it all together to</p>
<p>see if they could perhaps get a better angle of the car from maybe another camera.</p>
<p>And for months, the footage was really the only evidence they had.</p>
<p>That is until 2017, when police caught a major break in the case.</p>
<p>And this is a development that police haven&rsquo;t shared with the public at all.</p>
<p>That is until now.</p>
<p>In May of 2017, roughly seven months after Katie&rsquo;s murder, police conducted an unrelated</p>
<p>traffic stop in Charlotte.</p>
<p>While searching the suspect&rsquo;s car, police made an alarming discovery.</p>
<p>In the trunk of the car was a handgun.</p>
<p>After bringing it into evidence and doing ballistics testing, police realized that this</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t just any gun.</p>
<p>It was the gun used to kill Katie Jones in October of 2016.</p>
<p>And I know what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got the killer now.</p>
<p>I mean, if the murder weapon was found in a person&rsquo;s car, doesn&rsquo;t that person automatically</p>
<p>become the prime suspect?</p>
<p>Well, in this case, the truth isn&rsquo;t as clear cut as that.</p>
<p>According to Detective Hefner, this gun had been stolen in July of 2016 during a car break-in.</p>
<p>That was three months before Katie was killed.</p>
<p>From that point on, it was used as a street gun or a quote-unquote dirty gun, meaning</p>
<p>that it was passed around from person to person.</p>
<p>What this means for investigators is that it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to determine the</p>
<p>whereabouts of the gun from the time it was taken until the time it was recovered.</p>
<p>Putting that gun in someone&rsquo;s hands thus far has not been possible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve not been able to figure out whose hands it was in at the time Katie was killed.</p>
<p>To further frustrate the investigation, since the gun had been passed around so many times,</p>
<p>getting any fingerprints or DNA off the weapon was beyond the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>Now, it might sound like this was a dead end since they couldn&rsquo;t prove who had possession</p>
<p>of the gun at the time of the murder.</p>
<p>But this discovery actually proved to be a valuable clue.</p>
<p>The fact that the murder weapon was a street gun agreed with the narrative that this was</p>
<p>an attempted robbery gone wrong.</p>
<p>This gun told police that Katie&rsquo;s killer likely was not someone who wanted her dead.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t someone who may have had an axe to grind with her and happened to know her</p>
<p>route that she was taking home every day.</p>
<p>Although recovering the murder weapon certainly gave police a clearer vision of the motive</p>
<p>behind Katie&rsquo;s murder, Detective Hefner said this simply wasn&rsquo;t the piece of the puzzle</p>
<p>that they needed to solve the case.</p>
<p>Right now, if you&rsquo;ve ever put together a big jigsaw puzzle, you always want the edge pieces.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an edge piece.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t giving me much more.</p>
<p>This is a big, solid area in the middle of the puzzle, but this is not the edges.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get the crime to connect right now.</p>
<p>After the gun was found in 2017, things slowed down with the investigation.</p>
<p>Tips slowly stopped coming in, and investigators still had very little to work with.</p>
<p>As time dragged on, investigators continued exploring every avenue they could to get more</p>
<p>evidence.</p>
<p>But with every passing day that no new witnesses came forward and no new evidence came in,</p>
<p>the case kept getting colder, and it went on like this for two years.</p>
<p>By December 12th of 2019, the murder of Katie Jones officially became a cold case, and it</p>
<p>was passed from CMPD&rsquo;s homicide squad to the cold case unit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when cold case detectives decided to explore an avenue that they hadn&rsquo;t looked</p>
<p>at yet.</p>
<p>They began the process of obtaining cell phone location records.</p>
<p>Not Katie&rsquo;s cell phone records.</p>
<p>Police wanted to get records for everyone who was in a one block radius of Katie&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>on October 15th, 2016, within a 30 minute time block of when she was killed.</p>
<p>They thought that maybe if they could find out what cell phones were being used at the</p>
<p>crime scene when Katie was shot, then it might lead them to her killer.</p>
<p>But Detective Hefner said that records like that are not an easy thing to get a hold of.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s one thing to obtain that kind of data for one person, but to get that information</p>
<p>for an entire block of people was going to be a challenge and potentially controversial.</p>
<p>Detective Hefner explained that obtaining cell phone location records is a big privacy</p>
<p>issue, and judges are often hesitant about greenlighting a search like that that infringes</p>
<p>on people&rsquo;s privacy expectations.</p>
<p>Regardless, investigators petitioned the court to grant a search warrant, and eventually</p>
<p>the judge did just that.</p>
<p>Detective Hefner said that to keep people&rsquo;s privacy in mind, they just asked for the hard</p>
<p>data, basically just phone numbers that were active in that area during the murder.</p>
<p>No names.</p>
<p>And the judge granted the search warrants for police to obtain the app data from various</p>
<p>providers for that timeframe within the one block radius.</p>
<p>This was huge for investigators, and it gave detectives a lot of hope that they could be</p>
<p>one step closer to solving Katie&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>This data would show police anyone who was in the area of Katie&rsquo;s murder who was using</p>
<p>their phone at the time she was killed.</p>
<p>So after requesting the app data from the providers, investigators eagerly awaited the</p>
<p>results.</p>
<p>But their hopefulness was short-lived.</p>
<p>Police received the data of the people who were in the area and accessing their phones</p>
<p>at the time of the murder, but it didn&rsquo;t show the results they were anticipating.</p>
<p>It came back zero.</p>
<p>Goose egg.</p>
<p>We had no one.</p>
<p>Does it mean no one was there?</p>
<p>No, it means no one was accessing this app data, like using their Google Maps or getting</p>
<p>on Facebook or getting into Google Chat or whatever was out there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not using their device during that time.</p>
<p>So we hit dead ends and we kind of tucked our tail and left it alone.</p>
<p>Investigators were discouraged.</p>
<p>Here, they had a cold case that was recent enough to use modern technology to aid in</p>
<p>the investigation, and they were still coming up short.</p>
<p>So they went back to square one.</p>
<p>They decided to re-examine the surveillance footage from the area where Katie was killed.</p>
<p>Investigators took the videos that they had in their possession and lined up the footage</p>
<p>based on the time codes.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that the footage didn&rsquo;t quite line up with real time.</p>
<p>The traffic driving through each shot didn&rsquo;t match up from camera to camera, which meant</p>
<p>that the time codes on some of the cameras were off, not by much, maybe a couple of minutes,</p>
<p>but certainly enough to make a difference in the investigation.</p>
<p>After this discovery, detectives slowly and painstakingly went through all of the footage</p>
<p>they had and lined it all up, tracking cars through the videos to line up the videos perfectly</p>
<p>instead of relying solely on the time codes.</p>
<p>Now once they had all this footage lined up, they saw something that they hadn&rsquo;t seen</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>Throughout these videos, they kept seeing the same car over and over again.</p>
<p>It almost seemed like the car was driving in circles, but this wasn&rsquo;t just any car.</p>
<p>It appeared to be the suspect&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Police think they know why that sedan was driving around in circles that night in the</p>
<p>Plaza Midwood neighborhood, and it wasn&rsquo;t because the driver was lost.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got people leaving bars, leaving restaurants, cash in their pocket, intoxicated, not in</p>
<p>position to defend themselves well.</p>
<p>Our gut feeling is that this is someone looking for a victim to rob.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what our gut feeling is.</p>
<p>Detective Hefner thinks that the driver was out looking for a victim, but he said that</p>
<p>robberies turned murders are extremely uncommon.</p>
<p>A robbery murder, and when I say that I mean a true victim robbery murder, meaning a victim</p>
<p>doing nothing wrong, not participating in any illegal activity, and getting robbed while</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out minding their own business is very rare.</p>
<p>It happens, but it is rare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even more rare in Charlotte, where the homicide rate is notably lower than cities</p>
<p>of comparable sizes.</p>
<p>In fact, murder of any kind is almost unheard of in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood.</p>
<p>Sure, there were robberies, car break-ins, and criminal activity of that nature, but</p>
<p>according to a 2016 article in the Charlotte Observer, the last homicide in that neighborhood</p>
<p>had happened in 2013.</p>
<p>There are some doubters of the theory that Katie&rsquo;s murder was an attempted robbery.</p>
<p>I mean, if someone had intended to rob Katie, why didn&rsquo;t they end up taking anything?</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Katie did have $300 cash in her purse that her attacker just left</p>
<p>there, but Detective Hefner said that this is something he&rsquo;s seen before.</p>
<p>I would tell you there&rsquo;s been other cases I&rsquo;ve worked where the full intent was to rob</p>
<p>someone and a gunshot went off or there was a shooting that occurred and they actually</p>
<p>took nothing.</p>
<p>The suspect took nothing from the victim because of that.</p>
<p>Now the police had the surveillance footage lined up, they decided to take another stab</p>
<p>in the dark.</p>
<p>They used the footage they had strung together of the suspect car and put together a narrative.</p>
<p>Using this, they asked the court to grant another search warrant for more cell phone</p>
<p>This time covering a larger area in a smaller timeframe.</p>
<p>A judge granted the order for police to obtain the location data for a 10-minute period in</p>
<p>a three-block radius of where Katie was killed.</p>
<p>Hopeful once again, detectives requested location data from the providers.</p>
<p>Once they served the warrant, police had to wait and wait.</p>
<p>This data search was also completely anonymized, Detective Hefner said, meaning that the information</p>
<p>detectives received didn&rsquo;t say the names of who owned the devices.</p>
<p>It just said where the devices were within that three-block radius, how many times they</p>
<p>were being accessed, and if they were moving around.</p>
<p>And Detective Hefner said that this data is extremely accurate.</p>
<p>The location data is so precise that it can reliably pinpoint whether a person is inside</p>
<p>of a building or if they&rsquo;re on the street just outside of the building.</p>
<p>Once investigators received the data they requested, they saw several devices in the</p>
<p>area within that 10-minute window.</p>
<p>And knowing what they knew about the suspect&rsquo;s car driving around in circles before the murder,</p>
<p>detectives were able to eliminate any devices that were stagnant during those few minutes.</p>
<p>They were looking for devices that were on the move.</p>
<p>This narrowed down their suspect numbers to a very small list.</p>
<p>The next step was for detectives to request location data for those devices for an hour</p>
<p>before the murder and an hour after.</p>
<p>But just when things were looking up, their hopes were dashed again.</p>
<p>Once they received that information, investigators were able to eliminate every one of those</p>
<p>devices based on what they knew about the whereabouts of the suspect&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>It was another dead end.</p>
<p>So what do we have at the end of it?</p>
<p>Whoever was in this car, all it tells us is either they didn&rsquo;t have a phone that was on,</p>
<p>or they didn&rsquo;t have a phone that was a smartphone, or they didn&rsquo;t have a smartphone that was</p>
<p>using these particular apps that we were asking for.</p>
<p>Is it, is that something we usually hit a home run with?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We just didn&rsquo;t on this one.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tough because that was our, that was our big hope.</p>
<p>And with that, police seem to have exhausted all leads that they thought could potentially</p>
<p>lead them to Katie&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>Since 2021, there&rsquo;s been very little movement in Katie&rsquo;s case, but Detective Heffner has</p>
<p>yet to give up hope.</p>
<p>He thinks it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the truth comes out.</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s going to get hemmed up in a crime eventually, and they&rsquo;re going to need some</p>
<p>relief.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to need some help.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to reach out to us looking for their information, their knowledge of</p>
<p>this case or this gun to help them out of the problem they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we count on.</p>
<p>Detective Heffner said Katie Jones&rsquo;s case is one investigators lose sleep over.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve done everything they know to find answers and get to the bottom of her murder,</p>
<p>but they keep coming up empty.</p>
<p>To clear this case would be huge.</p>
<p>To clear this case would be huge, particularly because we have done everything that we know</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>You know, you make a list in your mind of all the possible things you can do to clear</p>
<p>a case and you hope that you clear it on the number two thing on the list or the number</p>
<p>three thing on the list.</p>
<p>But when you go through the long list of items and you run out of items and there&rsquo;s nothing,</p>
<p>no closure in the case, you know, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be really huge to clear this.</p>
<p>In an interview with True Crying Daily, Katie&rsquo;s mom said that she longs for justice for her</p>
<p>daughter.</p>
<p>She said, quote, I want answers.</p>
<p>I want justice for her.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t deserve to go into death not being known what happened to her.</p>
<p>Her story is not finished.</p>
<p>It needs to be finished.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Katie&rsquo;s friends and family have grieved long enough.</p>
<p>If you know who killed Katie Jones or you think you might have any kind of information</p>
<p>about her murder or the suspect&rsquo;s car, you&rsquo;re asked to call the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police</p>
<p>Department at 704-336-7600.</p>
<p>The Deck is an AudioChuck production with theme music by Ryan Lewis.</p>
