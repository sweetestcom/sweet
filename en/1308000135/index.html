    <p>What are you eating Freeberg? Is that buffalo jerky? What is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a red pepper.</p>
<p>It is not the bulltongue.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have time for lunch. I got pistachios and I got a red pepper.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, wait, look at this.</p>
<p>Is that our branded pistachios?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t these the best pistachios?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p>You got salt and vinegar, yeah?</p>
<p>Salt and vinegar, yeah, yeah, they&rsquo;re the best.</p>
<p>Are those unpeeled pistachios?</p>
<p>These guys are so rich, people peel their nuts.</p>
<p>People have been peeling my nuts since the Facebook IPO.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Sachs.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, welcome to episode 121 of the World&rsquo;s Greatest Podcast, the all-in podcast</p>
<p>with me again, of course, the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, the sultan of science,</p>
<p>David Friedberg, and the rain man himself.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>David Sachs.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, how are we doing?</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s greatest genuflector.</p>
<p>Strike, strike, strike.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s greatest moderator is here.</p>
<p>Oh, this, you guys, I got to tell you something, the grift is on.</p>
<p>A lot of corporate gigs for me to moderate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even have to prepare.</p>
<p>I just show up and moderate.</p>
<p>So great.</p>
<p>What is an example of such a gig?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of corporations and conferences that pay a pretty penny to have the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>greatest moderator come and interview people.</p>
<p>This is like the used car parts association of America having a convention.</p>
<p>I did one with like 1000 litigators at an attorney conference for like the SaaS software</p>
<p>they all use.</p>
<p>And it was a wonderful far side.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just great.</p>
<p>This is like the grift is on.</p>
<p>Do you have to fly commercial?</p>
<p>Or do they fly private?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s commercial at this point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is your, what does your rider say?</p>
<p>Do you ask for spice, salted macadamia nuts?</p>
<p>What do you ask for?</p>
<p>I do not have them peel my nuts.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What I do is I blend the travel costs into the speaking fee.</p>
<p>And then nobody knows when I&rsquo;m in or out, what hotel I&rsquo;m staying at or whatever.</p>
<p>But basically, I&rsquo;m back on the road, folks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back on the road.</p>
<p>Do you get like a trailer?</p>
<p>Or do you get, you know?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>What he&rsquo;s saying is, no, what he&rsquo;s saying is he gets a $2,500 travel budget.</p>
<p>And instead, he comes the day of and leaves the day of</p>
<p>saving and netting himself an extra $2,500.</p>
<p>Well, you know, you can optimize if you&rsquo;re saying optimize.</p>
<p>I did use, I had, you know, during COVID, I racked up a million and a half,</p>
<p>two million of these United Points.</p>
<p>And I have just been grinding those United Points down.</p>
<p>So shout out to United and the pandemic.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of news.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right, Jamal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s charging them for travel expenses when he&rsquo;s not even paying anything.</p>
<p>Maybe Jason&rsquo;s part of the grifters using the cash app to commit fraud and murder.</p>
<p>Lord, I mean, that Hindenburg report is, I mean, it&rsquo;s a work of art,</p>
<p>but we got to start with the Fed hiking rates by 25 basis points.</p>
<p>And the general feeling in the country that maybe the Fed doesn&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s time for regime change.</p>
<p>The Fed increased rates by 25 basis points yesterday,</p>
<p>Wednesday.</p>
<p>So the Fed has increased the federal funds rate from nearly zero in March of 2022,</p>
<p>to now the range of 4.75 to 5% fastest rate hike since the 70s.</p>
<p>Speculation, the Fed might pause rate hikes or even cut.</p>
<p>Do the recent banking failures didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>So if you bet that they were going to pause, you were wrong.</p>
<p>And if you bet they were going to cut, you were also wrong.</p>
<p>But the market has ripped a bit a day after,</p>
<p>which people are trying to figure out in the group chats doesn&rsquo;t seem like anybody has</p>
<p>a theory here.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s start with sacks, maybe an explainer a little bit on how the Fed works.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a board there, people serve a 14 year term.</p>
<p>I guess they replace somebody every two years.</p>
<p>And Jerome Powell was placed in 2018 by Trump.</p>
<p>And I guess there&rsquo;s a lot of hand wringing now that they were late on</p>
<p>inflation, obviously.</p>
<p>And then they went too fast.</p>
<p>And maybe now they&rsquo;re not slowing down enough.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your take on it objectively sex, putting aside partisanship and,</p>
<p>you know, for this administration versus that administration, just objectively,</p>
<p>do they know what they&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>And how could they do a better job?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think they know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They clearly reacted way too late to the inflation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</p>
<p>We had that surprise inflation print in the summer of 2021 5.1%.</p>
<p>They said it was transitory.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t react until November, they continued QE for another six months.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve suddenly got hawkish November of 2021.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t even start the first rate increase until March of 2022.</p>
<p>So they were really asleep at the wheel and late to react to the inflation by about nine</p>
<p>months.</p>
<p>Now I think they&rsquo;re potentially making the opposite decision, which is they are late</p>
<p>to recognize what stress and distress the economy is under right now.</p>
<p>And Powell had there was three choices they could have made at this meeting.</p>
<p>They could have raised rates, which is what they did.</p>
<p>They could have cut rates, which they didn&rsquo;t, or they could have done nothing, basically</p>
<p>held pat.</p>
<p>And the argument for raising rates is just that while we have this inflation problem,</p>
<p>we need to keep raising interest rates until the rates are above inflation.</p>
<p>And that will bring inflation down, then you can start to lower rates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of the conventional view.</p>
<p>I think the problem with that view is it ignores that we&rsquo;ve just seen a run of bank failures.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s tremendous stress building up in the banking system from unrealized losses</p>
<p>on long dated bonds, also unrealized losses on commercial real estate loans.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface of seeing that problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, the next shoe to drop in this whole thing.</p>
<p>So I think that the right decision here was to either cut rates or to stand pat.</p>
<p>You may have seen that Elon said, listen, we should be cutting rates here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s way too much latency in this inflation data.</p>
<p>The economy is seizing up and we don&rsquo;t need to be raising rates right now.</p>
<p>We actually need to be cutting them.</p>
<p>I think that probably if it were me looking at the upside downside of these decisions,</p>
<p>I probably would have just stood pat because, again, we&rsquo;ve just seen this banking crisis.</p>
<p>Why won&rsquo;t you just wait one month to see?</p>
<p>Maybe there is latency in the inflation data.</p>
<p>Maybe the banking crisis is not over.</p>
<p>Why won&rsquo;t you just stand pat for one month?</p>
<p>You can always raise rates in a month.</p>
<p>I think that this move here could, in hindsight,</p>
<p>be seen as the straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Chamath, would you have paused and waited to see another card</p>
<p>and then watch the hand developed?</p>
<p>Or do you think they&rsquo;re doing the right thing by raising?</p>
<p>Or should they have cut?</p>
<p>I think they did the worst thing possible, which is they took the middle path.</p>
<p>If you think about what the Fed has the ability to do,</p>
<p>they obviously have the ability to raise and lower interest rates.</p>
<p>But what we don&rsquo;t talk about is they have a balance sheet that can absorb assets.</p>
<p>For the last 10 or 15 years, we&rsquo;ve had a phenomenon called quantitative easing.</p>
<p>And for folks that don&rsquo;t understand what that means, that is essentially</p>
<p>the Federal Reserve buying assets out of the market and giving people money for it</p>
<p>so that people can then go and buy other things with that money.</p>
<p>Last June, they started what&rsquo;s called quantitative tightening,</p>
<p>which is essentially reversing that policy and restricting the liquidity in the system.</p>
<p>So if you look at those tools and you sort of play a game tree on what the Fed could have done,</p>
<p>I think that you have two choices.</p>
<p>One is you massively let inflation run amok, where you have no tools to fix.</p>
<p>Or you have massive illiquidity in the financial system.</p>
<p>But you actually do have tools to fix that, which is through some combination of quantitative</p>
<p>easing and tightening, depending on how much liquidity you want in the system.</p>
<p>So I think, actually, I disagree with Sachs.</p>
<p>I think they should have done the opposite.</p>
<p>They should have raised 50 bips.</p>
<p>It would have created a little bit more chaos in the short term,</p>
<p>but it would have set us up to understand what was fundamentally broken</p>
<p>and still give the Federal Reserve the ability to use their balance sheet</p>
<p>and use liquidity in the future to solve the problem.</p>
<p>They took the worst option, which is neither did they cut nor did they raise enough.</p>
<p>And so this problem that Sachs represents actually is the fundamental problem now,</p>
<p>which is you won&rsquo;t have enough clarity and signal</p>
<p>to really know whether this 25 basis point enough.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ve maintained now for nine months that rates are going to be</p>
<p>higher than we like and longer than we want.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s high time that we acknowledge that we have a sticky inflation problem</p>
<p>whose back we have to break.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve known since Volcker era what we need to do to do that,</p>
<p>which is you need to get interest rates to be greater than terminal inflation,</p>
<p>which means that a 5% Fed funds rate is insufficient.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to need to see a print of five and a half, 5.75%.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re going to have enough contraction.</p>
<p>And then the Fed can come back with liquidity.</p>
<p>But if they don&rsquo;t take these steps, we&rsquo;re going to be in this very choppy,</p>
<p>neither here, neither there situation.</p>
<p>And I think that is what causes the real damage,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the corrosive effects of uncertainty and what that does</p>
<p>to lending to risk taking.</p>
<p>And I think is really bad for the economy.</p>
<p>Freiburg, where do you land?</p>
<p>We have Sachs saying they should have stood pat,</p>
<p>which not saying either go hard, take the medicine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like an economist on judging the balance that they&rsquo;re trying to weigh right now.</p>
<p>I think everyone&rsquo;s got a different you can hear a cacophony of opinions on this one.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m more interested in is,</p>
<p>you know, we talk a lot about the banking crisis underway.</p>
<p>And I know we&rsquo;re going to talk about this</p>
<p>question on commercial real estate in a minute.</p>
<p>But if you look at the yield on the 10 year Treasury, I think,</p>
<p>coming out of this past two weeks,</p>
<p>you know, the yield on the 10 year Treasury dropped from 4.1% down to looks like it closed</p>
<p>at 3.4% today, nearly a point 7% decline in the past two and a half, three weeks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also off of 3.8% since the start of the year.</p>
<p>And remember, when we talked about the impact on asset values of banks, I think,</p>
<p>if you look holistically at the roughly $7 trillion of assets held</p>
<p>at banks, some, you know, whatever the set of banks that are that we looked at,</p>
<p>the average kind of equity ratio is about 15%.</p>
<p>So, you know, a 2% or sorry, a 3% adjustment over 10 years on the Treasury impacts the value</p>
<p>of a chunk of that portfolio down 25%, which starts to put you into dangerous territory.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s obviously a distribution of what that does to certain banks that are overweight,</p>
<p>you know, 10 year bonds, whether they&rsquo;re loan obligations on mortgages or Treasuries,</p>
<p>or corporate bonds or real estate bonds, a real estate debt.</p>
<p>And so the more encouraging point that I think we should pay attention to is,</p>
<p>does the market tell us that these short term rate actions are driving down the long the medium</p>
<p>and longer term rates in a way that will improve the balance sheets of all these institutions</p>
<p>that own a lot of this debt, particularly the banks and funds and so on.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ll do the math here real quick. But just in the last two weeks,</p>
<p>the impact on the 10 year Treasury has probably had a pretty sizable impact,</p>
<p>you know, we talked about unrealized losses, it&rsquo;s reduced those unrealized losses,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s improved them. So I think that that&rsquo;s like the more important metric to be tracking is,</p>
<p>you know, if you look at all the assets that we&rsquo;re all worried about right now,</p>
<p>are they going up in value or down in value in a way that introduces more stability</p>
<p>into these kind of banking systems that we care about? And I think right now, it looks like maybe</p>
<p>things are improving. And that might be part of the optimism around, you know, equity markets</p>
<p>and folks buying and so on. Yeah. And so this is, I guess, where people have started to talk</p>
<p>about the next shoe to drop, we obviously had this time based liquidity issues with Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Bank. Now, the Wall Street Journal is talking about commercial real estate and how much debt</p>
<p>there is. Since COVID, obviously, people are doing more remote work, a lot of the skyscrapers,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just San Francisco, but in many locations remain empty or underutilized,</p>
<p>people are now having their leases come up. Every year, more and more of these leases will</p>
<p>become vacant. And then we&rsquo;ll see if these buildings are worth what people paid for them</p>
<p>smaller banks hold around 2.3 trillion in commercial and real estate debt, including</p>
<p>rental apartment mortgages. Almost 80% of commercial mortgages are held by banks,</p>
<p>according to this Wall Street Journal story, sacks, you are an owner of some commercial real</p>
<p>estate. And you play in the space, you have a lot of firsthand knowledge. What what is your</p>
<p>putting aside your personal holdings or exposure? What is your take on what you&rsquo;re seeing? What is</p>
<p>the game on the field right now in terms of commercial real estate in San Francisco and</p>
<p>beyond? Well, if you talk to the commercial real estate guys, they&rsquo;ll tell you that the situation</p>
<p>is dire, dire, there&rsquo;s two problems. First, there&rsquo;s a credit crunch going on. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just no credit available. If you&rsquo;re a commercial real estate developer, and you have a building</p>
<p>and you want to refinance your construction loan, or put long term debt on a building,</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t do it. I mean, the banks are not open for business, they literally don&rsquo;t want the</p>
<p>business. And I think that comes back to the fact that banks right now are hunkered down</p>
<p>in a defensive posture. They&rsquo;re seeing deposits flee from their banks, unless of course, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>one of the top four is that does that freeze on the banks predate the Silicon Valley bank crisis,</p>
<p>and it was exacerbated? Were people having a hard time getting loans before that?</p>
<p>It predates it, but definitely what you&rsquo;re seeing what you saw with SVB and these other banks,</p>
<p>including Credit Suisse, is that banks now are getting much more paranoid. And that&rsquo;s why you saw</p>
<p>that if you look at the discount window, which is when the banks go to the Fed as lender of</p>
<p>last resorts, and basically post collateral to get liquidity, we had the biggest spike</p>
<p>in discount window borrowing since the 2008 financial crisis. Yeah, that line on the right</p>
<p>side, that is that is a spike in one week&rsquo;s borrowing, this exceeds anything that happened</p>
<p>in 2008. The warning sign should be flashing red over something like this. Now, to bring it back</p>
<p>and be clear, that&rsquo;s banks who have real estate exposure, going to the Fed going to the government</p>
<p>saying, Hey, can we get some money to cover these? It&rsquo;s not specifically about real estate is more</p>
<p>about bank liquidity. The banks are saying we don&rsquo;t have enough liquidity right now to cover</p>
<p>our needs, which are highly volatile right now, because basically, depositors are moving out of</p>
<p>community and regional and small banks into the big four, so called systemically important or</p>
<p>SIB banks. So what&rsquo;s happening is that again, banks are hunkering down, they&rsquo;re getting very</p>
<p>defensive, they do not want to make new loans, because they can&rsquo;t tie up assets, they are trying</p>
<p>to stay liquid themselves. So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening now in sort of with respect to new</p>
<p>lending. And then on the other side of it, you have existing loan portfolios, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>like $20 trillion of commercial real estate debt. And most commercial real estate lending is done by</p>
<p>small banks by community banks. So they are sitting on these huge CRE loan portfolios. And I think</p>
<p>something like 300 billion needs to be refinanced or is coming due in the next year. Normally,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s rolled over and refinanced. There was separately, there was a study showing that</p>
<p>unrealized losses these loan portfolios in the banking system may be around $2 trillion. It was</p>
<p>a study that was reported on by the Wall Street Journal. So in the same way that we had huge</p>
<p>unrealized losses in these long dated bonds, I think we also have</p>
<p>at Silicon Valley Bank specifically, that&rsquo;s where we</p>
<p>were the worst offender, but it&rsquo;s a systemic problem. I think similarly, we have huge unrealized</p>
<p>losses in commercial real estate loan portfolios. And this is, I think, even a more subtle and</p>
<p>pernicious problem. Because with securities like T-bills or mortgage bonds, it&rsquo;s very easy to know</p>
<p>what the unrealized losses are. The reason why they hadn&rsquo;t realized losses was not because they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know what they were, it was because of a stupid accounting rule that said they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to realize the losses if they were quote unquote, holding them to maturity.</p>
<p>With these loan portfolios, we don&rsquo;t know how big the exposure is. And we won&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>until you start seeing some defaults and repricings of assets.</p>
<p>Commercial real estate is a much more dynamic market, right? You have to have a buyer there,</p>
<p>you have leases, you have leases coming off at different times, you have sub leases occurring.</p>
<p>And you have the owners of them flipping them right and refinancing them constantly to buy</p>
<p>new buildings. And so and those loans aren&rsquo;t as liquid, right? With a mortgage bond,</p>
<p>those are basically a bunch of loans, mortgage home mortgages, typically that have been packaged</p>
<p>up and turned into a security and there&rsquo;s liquid marketplace to trade them. In the case of these</p>
<p>loan portfolios, there may not be a liquid marketplace. So you don&rsquo;t really know how</p>
<p>impaired that loan portfolio is until you actually get to a place where</p>
<p>when will we know what because that&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m wondering, we I saw a lot of headlines,</p>
<p>you know, Pinterest bought themselves out of their new headquarters in the Bay Area,</p>
<p>San Francisco, I believe, specifically, I heard Facebook got rid of a couple billion dollars and</p>
<p>wrote down some expansion. Amazon is selling buildings, they had gotten a ton of buildings.</p>
<p>And we saw last week, they got rid of another 9000. They&rsquo;re planning another 9000. And they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get people to come back to the office. So how bad is the overbill? I guess is the question,</p>
<p>because that will be the driver of the value of these buildings. Because if there&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>supply, then what are these buildings actually worth? Are they worth $90 a square foot? What</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no what if Amazon doesn&rsquo;t want more space, you can see it in the credit default</p>
<p>spreads of these banks, it&rsquo;s in the water table already. So you can Nick, you can just throw it</p>
<p>up. If you look at any bank that&rsquo;s lending, and that has a portfolio, this is Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, euro denominated CDS. But it&rsquo;s the same for Barclays, it&rsquo;s the same for sock gen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same for a bunch of American banks, there is a risk in the system that sacks articulated</p>
<p>that is now getting priced in, there are all kinds of loans whose payments, which the banks need,</p>
<p>cannot necessarily be insured, which means that then there could be illiquidity there,</p>
<p>there could be a flow of deposits out from those banks, which would then make their ability to pay</p>
<p>their debt holders lower. You also have this complicated issue already, where it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>like the first time in a long, long, long time where debt holders actually got wiped out in the</p>
<p>credit suisse debacle before the equity holders did. And that&rsquo;s created all kinds of ripple effects.</p>
<p>So this credit bubble is here, and it&rsquo;s being manifested right now in these very sophisticated</p>
<p>parts of the market. And eventually, they&rsquo;ll ripple to the broader economy at large, but</p>
<p>how a person feels this is, they&rsquo;re not going to be able to get a car loan or a mortgage or</p>
<p>the interest rates they pay will go up. And then how bondholders will react to all of this stuff</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ll just start to find different assets, probably the front end of the curve money market</p>
<p>cash, gold, and they&rsquo;ll just abandon all these assets. And then the other problem</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s just really, really bad for risk assets. So the things that we</p>
<p>invest in startups, technology companies, either in a world of inflation run amok,</p>
<p>because the Fed isn&rsquo;t hiking fast enough, which just destroys future cash flows,</p>
<p>or in a world where the Fed pivots in a moment like this, and Nick, you can show the second chart,</p>
<p>both result in the same outcome, which is that you just see these massive drawdowns</p>
<p>in the value of risk assets. So we&rsquo;re in a really complicated moment.</p>
<p>And this is why I think, again, the Fed needed to take leadership this past week,</p>
<p>and actually do the hard work of either cutting 50 bps, or raising 50 bps. And this middle path</p>
<p>is the absolute worst path because trying to thread a needle in this complicated economy,</p>
<p>I think is just going to be impossible. And then what happens is then the markets move around them.</p>
<p>Right? The markets have completely said, we now discredit what you did. And they&rsquo;re basically</p>
<p>banking that the Fed will be forced to cut rates massively in short course, because the crisis</p>
<p>will be so severe that it&rsquo;ll outweigh the risk of inflation. Think about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so all this real estate comes on the market. There&rsquo;s no buyers for it. The mortgages are due.</p>
<p>Does that mean a commercial real estate owner just basically gets foreclosed on and they hand</p>
<p>the keys back to the bank or the banks, as this Wall Street Journal story was sort of alluding to</p>
<p>that the Fed will say, you know what, we&rsquo;ll just extend will backstop this real estate,</p>
<p>which happened in the last bubble. And we hope that over time, it works itself out and demand</p>
<p>returns. Now, of course, that&rsquo;s different than a post COVID world. So this time could be different.</p>
<p>What happens in the case of 2024 2025? All of these office spaces are returned and the keys</p>
<p>are handed back? Yeah, so okay. So Jason, you asked a question like, how does this problem</p>
<p>manifest? Let me describe from the point of view of that real estate owner. There&rsquo;s basically two</p>
<p>problems. One is that you have a tenant who&rsquo;s in a long term lease 5, 7, 10 years,</p>
<p>that lease rolls, so that that lease comes due. Now they don&rsquo;t need the space anymore. You know,</p>
<p>we know that take San Francisco, which has got to be the worst market for Siri in the country right</p>
<p>now. That&rsquo;s something like 30 to 40% of the space is vacant. So that&rsquo;s either space for rent or</p>
<p>space for sublease because no one&rsquo;s using it. So they put it back on the market. Well,</p>
<p>all those subleases, they&rsquo;re still paying rent because they have a contract.</p>
<p>So what happens is as those leases roll, and all of a sudden, you don&rsquo;t pay rent anymore,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to stop or if you still need the space, you&rsquo;re going to negotiate</p>
<p>a much, much lower rent. So now all of a sudden, the real estate owner can&rsquo;t make their debt</p>
<p>service covenant ratios, the income from the building is just substantially less,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t make their debts on that and explain that ratio to folks, you have a certain amount</p>
<p>of debt you own, let&rsquo;s say Salesforce tower. In Salesforce&rsquo;s case, they&rsquo;re subleasing 125,000</p>
<p>square feet. Let&rsquo;s say they were into that for 500 million. What is this debt service ratio?</p>
<p>Explain that to the audience when the bank underwrites the loan, they just figure out</p>
<p>the interest that you got to pay on the loan relative to the value of the building or the</p>
<p>income that is generating. But all those ratios are upside down now because the value of the</p>
<p>buildings, the rent has gone down so much because there&rsquo;s so much vacancy. I mean, when these loans</p>
<p>were underwritten, San Francisco had like a 5% vacancy rate. And now it&rsquo;s like 30 to 40%.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no tenants. And then in parallel with that, Jason, you&rsquo;ve got all these cases where</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t only have tenants or leases rolling, you have loans rolling. Again, if the owner of</p>
<p>the building has either a construction loan or like a long-term debt, and that needs to roll,</p>
<p>they have to refinance it. And if they can even get credit, which they may not be able to because</p>
<p>of this crunch, they&rsquo;re going to be paying a lot more for it. So now all of a sudden,</p>
<p>the income statement for that building doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Think about it, your borrowing costs</p>
<p>are higher and your revenue is lower. So now all of a sudden the building&rsquo;s underwater.</p>
<p>So where does that end up? Well, they default on the debt and the bank ends up owning the building.</p>
<p>So then what happens is you end up with all of downtown San Francisco owned by a bunch of banks.</p>
<p>What are they going to do with it? They don&rsquo;t want to be in the real estate business. So they</p>
<p>have to fire sale those buildings in a bunch of auctions at rock bottom prices. Because by the</p>
<p>way, there&rsquo;s no cash or liquidity out there. So who are the buyers going to be? Who&rsquo;s the buyer?</p>
<p>There are no buyers. We have a 30% vacancy rate. There&rsquo;s no renters.</p>
<p>So what happens? Detroit, is it just like a dead city?</p>
<p>And then the tax base collapses the city because so much of the tax base is dependent on real</p>
<p>estate. So listen, I think they&rsquo;re going to have to work this out. I don&rsquo;t think they can just let</p>
<p>the free market take its course here because you&rsquo;re going to end up with a scenario I just</p>
<p>painted. So I think what hopefully would happen maybe is that the banks do some sort of deal with</p>
<p>the real estate owners that they blend and extend or whatever. But in order to do that,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to need to be backstopped by somebody. And that&rsquo;s the Fed.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what are your thoughts just writ large as it were on the commercial real estate space?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s $90, it was $90 a square foot, right? For class A sacks in the city?</p>
<p>Is that the price? What&rsquo;s that going to be?</p>
<p>60, 70, 80, 90 bucks a foot, depending on what kind of building you&rsquo;re talking about. I mean,</p>
<p>you have all these empty office towers. So look, I never invest in office towers. I do</p>
<p>small boutique kind of brick and timber spaces in Jackson Square, we&rsquo;re doing okay, because people</p>
<p>still want to be in those spaces. But these office towers on Market Street, or in Soma,</p>
<p>I mean, which is where all the investment went during the boom. Nobody wants to be in those</p>
<p>buildings anymore. And it doesn&rsquo;t help that the city has allowed this giant, you know,</p>
<p>open air drug market to metastasize right outside their door.</p>
<p>Freeberg?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s inevitable we&rsquo;ll have probably two to $3 trillion of federal money</p>
<p>you know, spent to backstop and support the asset. I mean, that&rsquo;s the general theme here in</p>
<p>case everyone isn&rsquo;t paying attention at home is that the Fed, the US government will continue to</p>
<p>print money and create programs to effectively support asset values such that there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a crippling economic ripple effect. And this is the danger of debt spiral of debt. And it&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I always talk about how concerned I am about global debt levels, and particularly debt levels</p>
<p>in the US, but really global debt levels. I&rsquo;ll say the statistic again, and over and over again,</p>
<p>360% global debt to global GDP. But, you know, even within some of these asset classes,</p>
<p>a significant amount of debt has been used to fuel asset prices and to fuel equity value.</p>
<p>And then that equity value gets levered and reinvested. And so the rippling effect in the</p>
<p>economy of declining asset value can be magnified through leverage. And unfortunately, debt in</p>
<p>general forces growth, without growth, debt fails. And so when we&rsquo;ve used debt to demand growth,</p>
<p>on a macro perspective, it causes, you know, significant stress and strain on the system</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going through periods of like we are right now, what should be natural recessionary</p>
<p>effects from COVID and shutting down the economy, or natural asset price declines because of that.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t let it happen. Because if it were to happen, the rippling effect would be crippling.</p>
<p>So this is a good example, you&rsquo;ll probably I don&rsquo;t know what the facility will look like.</p>
<p>Maybe the government passes some congressional bill that says, Hey, guys, here&rsquo;s $3 trillion</p>
<p>to support, you know, all this real estate is another, you know, 2 trillion to support banks</p>
<p>and, you know, giving them liquidity. Because the other problem, as you guys know, is most people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>most of the population in the US has most of their assets, their asset value, their equity value in</p>
<p>their home. And those home prices are supported by residential loan programs. And, you know,</p>
<p>if you actually have a massive write down of the value of that asset class, that&rsquo;s when, you know,</p>
<p>everything kind of falls apart. So you know, we will continue to be buoyed by that, that that kind</p>
<p>of inflationary behavior, unfortunately, biology, I think, has it right, we&rsquo;ll talk about it in a</p>
<p>minute, that there has to be money printing to get out of this hole. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>necessarily in this moment, hyper inflationary, as he predicts, you know, he uses the Deutsche</p>
<p>Mark and the Weimar Republic as this kind of storyline that this is what&rsquo;s about to happen in</p>
<p>the US. The truth is, it looks a little bit more like the pound sterling at the end of the British</p>
<p>Empire, where you know, there&rsquo;s certainly an inflationary and devaluation effect that arises,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not it is the reserve currency of the world today. Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s really hard to kind</p>
<p>of just say, hey, it&rsquo;s going to be hyper inflationary, and the value is going to go to</p>
<p>zero, it&rsquo;s just not going to happen. So that seems to be the dollar of the dollar. Yeah.</p>
<p>So that seems to be the bet now chum off that some folks are predicting catastrophizing, hey,</p>
<p>this is the end of US supremacy, the end of the dollar, of course, modern monetary theory</p>
<p>seems to stay, you can just keep printing dollars and make a couple trillion dollar</p>
<p>coins and backstop it. And by the way, TARP was profitable modestly for the United States,</p>
<p>and the backstop of real estate totally work. So where do you land on this? Do you think these</p>
<p>backstops and modern monetary theory stating that you can just print money you own your</p>
<p>own fiat currency is going to work? Or as we pivot to the billion dollar? I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>the million dollar biology Bitcoin bet that this is the end of days.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not the end of days. But I think you&rsquo;re conflating a bunch of things together. So</p>
<p>look, MMT. Yes, I am. Yes. Was, in hindsight, idiotic. In the moment, it never quite made sense.</p>
<p>But in hindsight, it&rsquo;s clearly idiotic. And I think that we can properly dispense with that.</p>
<p>But the reason that we print so much money is sort of what freebrook says, which is that we</p>
<p>just want a well functioning society. And the simplest and shortest way to do that</p>
<p>is to make sure that there aren&rsquo;t any winners and losers anymore. And the most effective way to do</p>
<p>that in the markets is with money, print a bunch of money, and there are no more winners and losers.</p>
<p>And so everybody can kind of win. Some people may may win more, but nobody really ever loses.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the mo that we&rsquo;re operating under.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>something unhealthy to that, Chamath, you&rsquo;re sort of alluded to no losers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a more philosophical and a commentary on capitalism and a bunch of other things. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right, I don&rsquo;t think it makes sense. I do think you need winners and losers</p>
<p>to really make society function well. But the other part of it is like, does it reinforce,</p>
<p>or does it decay, US dollar hegemony, and I think it actually reinforces it. And the reason is just</p>
<p>very practically speaking, when you look at how dependent other people other countries are on the</p>
<p>US dollar in times of stress, they actually become more dependent. And that has a lot to</p>
<p>do with their boring patterns, the amount of dollars central banks need outside the United</p>
<p>States. And so what did you see in a moment of stress, actually, the Fed opened up swap lines</p>
<p>to all the central banks that they work with their most important operating partners, so Europe,</p>
<p>Canada, Japan, etc, Switzerland, and they move the liquidity window from weekly to daily, and</p>
<p>they pounded the swap lines. So I don&rsquo;t know, I think that most people that that kind of like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a boy crying wolf, maybe at some point, somebody will be right, but you&rsquo;re going to lose</p>
<p>so much money trying to take a point of view around this topic that it&rsquo;s more practical to</p>
<p>just look at dollar flows. And dollar flows go up in moments of stress not go down. And they go up</p>
<p>in a distributed manner across the monetary plumbing of the world. Right. So let&rsquo;s explain</p>
<p>the biology bat since that trended, and he is the boy who, as you&rsquo;re saying, cried wolf this past</p>
<p>week, cry Bitcoin. Yeah, the boy. So a friend of the pod apology, on March 17, predicted that</p>
<p>Bitcoin will reach $1 million in 90 days, due to us hyperinflation. hyperinflation is defined as</p>
<p>prices going up 50% month over month, just so we&rsquo;re clear on exactly how dramatic that is. He</p>
<p>made the bet on March 17, against a pseudo anonymous Twitter user, James Medlock, who said</p>
<p>they would bet 1 million that the US would not experience hyperinflation. So biology sort of</p>
<p>inserted Bitcoin into that bet. It wasn&rsquo;t a Bitcoin bet that and I think he&rsquo;s done two of these bets.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s betting 2 million in total on Bitcoin hitting 1 million by June 17, which there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably no chance of that happening or a very tiny chance I&rsquo;ll ask the panel in a second.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was trading at 25 26,000 at the time, it&rsquo;s now trading at over 28,000. And Balaji has</p>
<p>been on every podcast known to man in the last 72 hours talking about this. I&rsquo;ve watched one or two</p>
<p>of them. And it&rsquo;s a pretty out there argument, I think. You can just type in biology on YouTube</p>
<p>and watch any of the 20 he&rsquo;s done. He believes regional banks are insolvent. He thinks the feds</p>
<p>need to is going to need to print a massive amount of money. Like we&rsquo;ve said here, do more QE and</p>
<p>then cut rates all seems reasonable, but that that will lead to hyperinflation. It&rsquo;s not reasonable.</p>
<p>Wow. No, no, it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s reasonable. We just print we just printed that they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>cut rates, we just discussed they&rsquo;re going to eventually cut rates, and there&rsquo;ll be more QE.</p>
<p>So that part is reasonable. I&rsquo;m just that one little piece. But then he believes is the part</p>
<p>that is kind of out there, that hyperinflation is going to devalue the dollar and this is the time</p>
<p>he does not and I made a bunch of I asked him a bunch of times and he would not be honest about it</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t want to answer my question. I said, Hey, what percentage are you in Bitcoin?</p>
<p>Somebody says he&rsquo;s 99% in Bitcoin, he will not confirm. And so I was like, well,</p>
<p>if you want 1000 bitcoins, if this goes up, you know, a very small amount,</p>
<p>four or 5%, you&rsquo;re going to pay for the bets. And are you talking your own book here or not?</p>
<p>sacks? What do you think of this overall bet? Is it a stunt? Yeah. He&rsquo;s saying like,</p>
<p>this is the lifeboats moment. And just to add to it, he says, you have to leave the United States</p>
<p>and get to Singapore, or a place or if you&rsquo;re going to stay in the United States,</p>
<p>you need to get to Wyoming or Texas or somewhere that explicitly allows Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Because the closer you are to the United States banking system, what happened to Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Bank on that fateful weekend where people couldn&rsquo;t get their cash and we&rsquo;re going to have to,</p>
<p>you know, miss payroll. He says that&rsquo;s the dry run for the entire US banking system,</p>
<p>sacks. So first of all, I don&rsquo;t think you can disparage Balaji because someone who cries wolf</p>
<p>says this repeatedly, and it makes a dire prediction repeatedly and is wrong. And we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t say yet that Balaji is wrong. Do I think that we&rsquo;re gonna have a million dollar Bitcoin</p>
<p>in 90 days? I personally find that very unlikely, but you can&rsquo;t say yet. He stuck his neck out</p>
<p>making a prediction that will be easily falsified if he&rsquo;s wrong. Second, the last time that Balaji</p>
<p>made a dire prediction was COVID. And he was right about that one. So you can&rsquo;t say that this</p>
<p>is just like a doomer who throws out crazy predictions and is always wrong. He&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>pretty selective about his predictions. Yeah, there was a tweet from January 30th of 2020,</p>
<p>in which he basically predicted a pandemic based on a coronavirus and laid out a whole</p>
<p>bunch of consequences that mostly came true. Which is why we&rsquo;re talking about this. This is not just</p>
<p>some like random person, like he actually has a pedigree and a track record. But here&rsquo;s my view</p>
<p>on it is doom and gloom. Yes, him and Nassim Taleb, the two of our opening speakers at All</p>
<p>in Summit 2023. Those will be our bookhead speakers. Book them now. Anyway, so, so look,</p>
<p>now, what do I think about it? I, I posted my own theory today, which I would call sort of</p>
<p>Balaji light. Which is, okay, look, if you if you think about the spiking interest rates that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had, and that Chamath thinks will actually continue quite a bit longer, there are three</p>
<p>main effects that it indisputably has. Number one, undercuts the value of long dated bonds.</p>
<p>Number two, it&rsquo;s made lending much more expensive, particularly for big purchases,</p>
<p>like real estate. Number three, it&rsquo;s increased government lending costs. Okay, now, play that</p>
<p>through the financial system. What does that mean? Well, if the value of long dated bonds</p>
<p>has sharply decreased, well, that&rsquo;s led to this banking crisis with the unrealized losses. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>already happened. Number two, it&rsquo;s made lending more expensive, the credit crunch and CRE,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re beginning to see that. And I believe that&rsquo;s going to play out as the second crisis</p>
<p>of this larger financial crisis. And then number three is the increase in government borrowing</p>
<p>costs that will eventually play out in terms of being a government debt crisis of some kind.</p>
<p>And I think it will involve, you know, a spike in borrowing costs at the federal level and involve</p>
<p>sovereign debt issues internationally, I think it will involve budget deficits at states and</p>
<p>cities. So I think there&rsquo;s three phases to this financial crisis. We&rsquo;re in phase one,</p>
<p>and I think CRE and government debt are the next two phases. And I think a lot of that lines up</p>
<p>with what Balaji thinks, where I disagree with him as I don&rsquo;t think we can know what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to happen in 90 days. I think that the CRE crisis is highly deflationary, it&rsquo;s going to create</p>
<p>distress everywhere in the economy, that is going to lead to a massive reduction in liquidity.</p>
<p>I think that the government debt crisis, assuming the government wants to inflate and monetize the</p>
<p>debt as a way to solve that problem, that will be highly inflationary. But when these things play</p>
<p>out, we can&rsquo;t know. I think that&rsquo;s what makes this really hard is I think jumping all the way to the</p>
<p>sort of finish line and saying we&rsquo;re gonna have a million dollar Bitcoin in 90 days because the</p>
<p>US dollar is worthless. I think that&rsquo;s premature. I think this could play out over the next couple</p>
<p>of years. We have a real problem if Bitcoin is the exit ramp for an inflationary crisis because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not accessible enough. It&rsquo;s not easily transactable for folks. I&rsquo;m sorry to be</p>
<p>negative to the Bitcoin maximalists. I&rsquo;m generally in favor of this kind of independent</p>
<p>storage system that&rsquo;s outside of government and state control. I think there&rsquo;s just this</p>
<p>unfortunate reality. I mean, we saw at the Wells notice to Coinbase today. They just arrested that</p>
<p>that crypto guy don&rsquo;t Kwan was arrested in Montenegro of all great country cracking won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let you wire money in or out as of I think Monday or Tuesday. And so you know, it&rsquo;s clearly becoming</p>
<p>kind of a less accessible system of storage. So what&rsquo;s more accessible? Well, I do think that one</p>
<p>of the reasons we&rsquo;re seeing the market move the way it does is because folks are shifting their</p>
<p>risk assets around quite a bit right now to figure out where is a good place to put money.</p>
<p>I was talking with a asset manager, you know, this morning, and you know, they had a very strong</p>
<p>point of view folks are are moving capital away from what they think are going to be most impacted</p>
<p>by the risk of this kind of massive inflationary event that may arise or this massive banking</p>
<p>crisis that may arise, or this massive real estate crisis that may arise. And there are other places</p>
<p>to then put your capital. That&rsquo;s not just Bitcoin. And sure, maybe some of these things are</p>
<p>dollar denominated. But for example, there are many businesses that sell products in non dollar</p>
<p>denominated currencies globally. And while they report and trade on US stock exchanges, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>buying a security interest in a business that generates most of its income, you&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>many different companies. And so there are many companies that get the bulk of their revenue,</p>
<p>the bulk of their sales. Internationally, there are also many companies that will benefit in an</p>
<p>inflationary environment businesses that are tied to other types of real estate businesses that are</p>
<p>tied to certain capital equipment where consumption will not go down, unless there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>significant, massive, you know, global socioeconomic shock. And so I think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a lot of what&rsquo;s going on right now. It&rsquo;s less about, hey, Bitcoin is the only place to go</p>
<p>and be safe. And it&rsquo;s more about let me reallocate my risk assets a little bit, you know, to places</p>
<p>that may be benefit benefit may benefit from, or may be better guarded from a massive kind of</p>
<p>inflationary shock. And let me just say, let me say one more thing. I think one of the biggest</p>
<p>risks that is not being talked about is the debt ceiling vote that&rsquo;s due in June. In June, Congress</p>
<p>needs to pass an increase in the debt ceiling, because the amount of debt that the US that the</p>
<p>federal government is going to have to take on in order to meet our budget deficit and refinance our</p>
<p>debt and pay our obligations, historically, means that we&rsquo;re going to have to have more than what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re, you know, we&rsquo;ve approved to date in terms of the total amount of debt. Now, this has</p>
<p>historically been a last minute vote, you know, crazy dramatic thing that drives markets nuts.</p>
<p>The Hill had a public opinion piece from Peter work and Mary space, but I think they make a good</p>
<p>point. You know, I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of folks who are call it in the fixed income market, but also</p>
<p>folks are in the equities markets publicly who are pretty nervous about this debt ceiling vote.</p>
<p>And if it does look like the Republican Party takes a very hard line, and says, because this</p>
<p>is the current party line, if you don&rsquo;t agree to massive deficit cuts or spending cuts,</p>
<p>austerity, and really commit to that, in a bill that we can pass, that Ben also approves the</p>
<p>increase in the debt limit, we are not going to approve increasing the debt limit. And you know,</p>
<p>what this opinion piece argues, I think is a very good middle of the line solution,</p>
<p>which is, you know, come up with points of view, and actually document those points of view,</p>
<p>on making sure that government spending is effectively accountable, that there&rsquo;s no more</p>
<p>wasteful spending, and that there are certain programs that both parties can very quickly agree</p>
<p>to as being, you know, very wasteful. And if you start there, you maybe get enough across the line,</p>
<p>that both parties kind of say this makes sense, let&rsquo;s do this. And then we can kind of increase</p>
<p>the debt limit. Because in the absence of that, the US will have to default on debt, this is always</p>
<p>the big threats never happened. And if that happens, or there is the looming threat of that</p>
<p>happening, combined with the banking crisis combined with you know, the liquidity crisis</p>
<p>combined with the real estate crisis that may be emerging here. Let me ask you a question that you</p>
<p>can have things really meltdown. So look, because I think this is the biggest like black swan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a black swan. But this is the biggest kind of elephant in the room right now is and</p>
<p>sorry, I think if people in DC could get together today, and if you could, instead of doing the</p>
<p>typical last minute 24 hour vote, a day before the debt ceiling needs to be increased, be thoughtful</p>
<p>and do it. If this could be addressed today, it could start to put in some of the layers of back</p>
<p>stop and coverage and protection and safety that the markets I think really need to manage some of</p>
<p>the trepidation in the in the weeks and months ahead. I want to jump to the crypto crackdown</p>
<p>and get your opinion on that sex first, but I want to do a clarifying point here with Freiburg,</p>
<p>you have been in the Ray Dalio end of empires, empires collapse, and that hey, maybe the US</p>
<p>is winding down its supremacy and apology was pretty much saying, Yep, this is the moment.</p>
<p>Where is there any light between your position of like, Hey, Dalio is correct. This is the end</p>
<p>of the empire and apologies, like, it&rsquo;s the end of the empire right now. Where do you stand on that?</p>
<p>Preburn? So I mean, I&rsquo;ve always I&rsquo;ve been concerned. I&rsquo;ve told you guys this for like</p>
<p>three years, and I&rsquo;ve obviously promoted this book for two and a half years.</p>
<p>When Dalio&rsquo;s points of view, with lots of kind of empirical wisdom behind it,</p>
<p>I think, indicate that the US is on a path and the way we spend and the way we behave,</p>
<p>and the way markets are reacting, I think, indicates that a lot of what has happened</p>
<p>historically is happening now in the US. Now, it doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>overnight, that that&rsquo;s where I would have light with biology. Okay, the notion of kind of hyper</p>
<p>inflation, again, I think, means that, so think about all the US dollar holders around the world,</p>
<p>it would be a shock for the collective system, it would require the collective system to</p>
<p>collectively agree to get off the dollar very quickly for that to really happen. Yeah, in the</p>
<p>meantime, I do think there will be inflationary effects, I do think there will be massive kind</p>
<p>of asset value shocks. But I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s going to be this kind of like Weimar Republic,</p>
<p>Deutsche Mark, I got your hyperinflation thing, because it is the reserve currency,</p>
<p>and it is so widely held by everyone, it would require collective giving up. It also seems</p>
<p>like there may be, you know, we talked a lot about the petro yuan trade, which I think is</p>
<p>critical to see that actually happen. I think that&rsquo;s going to be the linchpin. Got it. Maybe</p>
<p>that catalyzes us. And that seems to be a little bit tightrope right now, too. It doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>super definitive that Saudis are embracing China, there&rsquo;s obviously this behavior with</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not as definitive right now. I think that that needs to happen</p>
<p>to kind of really catalyze that let&rsquo;s get our tinfoil hats on here for a second.</p>
<p>In relation to the biology bet, there has been a lot of action against crypto.</p>
<p>Obviously, authoritarian countries took control of crypto long ago, China, banning it, etc. North</p>
<p>Korea, other other authoritarian places kind of tighten their grip on it. Now here in the United</p>
<p>States, Coinbase got a Wells notice. That is a warning basically, and giving you a last chance</p>
<p>to kind of respond to the SEC. And this was based on their loaning programs. And on top of that,</p>
<p>a number of other crypto crackdowns have occurred, we saw celebrities getting smacked down,</p>
<p>and getting fines and doing settlements. This has led sacks to a theory that the United States</p>
<p>government wants to break the back of crypto crypto has done a great job of breaking their</p>
<p>own back with plenty of crypto grifts insider trading and all kinds of shenanigans with FTX</p>
<p>and front running and painting the tape any grift or criminal activity possible seems to have been</p>
<p>exploited. Do you think that these two things are in some way coordinated, or there&rsquo;s a coordinated</p>
<p>effort by the US government to destroy and kill crypto as an off ramp for the US dollar,</p>
<p>while the US dollar is dealing with these crises?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a really interesting article that was just published on substack by Nick Carter,</p>
<p>who I guess a guest writer on Mike Solana&rsquo;s substack called pirate wires. This is a follow</p>
<p>up piece to an article he wrote six weeks ago, where he laid out the an operation by the Biden</p>
<p>administration called Operation choke point, which made the case that the Biden administration was</p>
<p>quietly attempting to ban crypto. And now, you know, a month later, there&rsquo;s all these things</p>
<p>that are all these steps that the administration is taking to go after crypto and he you know,</p>
<p>he lays out a bunch in a bullet point list. So the SEC announced a lawsuit against crypto</p>
<p>infrastructure company Paxos, crypto exchange Kraken settled with the SEC.</p>
<p>SEC Chair Gensler openly labeled every crypto asset other than Bitcoin to security.</p>
<p>Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing land basing Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Biden administration proposed a bill that singles out crypto miners for owners tax treatment.</p>
<p>New York Attorney General declared Ethereum, which is the second largest crypto asset of security.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge change, by the way. Yep. SEC continues to anti consumer protection efforts</p>
<p>by doubling down their attempt to block a spot Bitcoin ETF. OCC led crypto bank protegos</p>
<p>application for a natural national trust charter expire. And then the SEC just sent Coinbase a</p>
<p>Wells notice. So I think it&rsquo;s hard to argue that there isn&rsquo;t a concerted effort now to crack down</p>
<p>on crypto by a wide variety of government agencies and authorities, starting with Gensler at the SEC</p>
<p>who seems incredibly hostile to crypto. So now the only question is, is this correlated</p>
<p>with the stress that the banking system is under? Or is it just a coincidence?</p>
<p>And that I don&rsquo;t know. But I think the argument biology would make is that</p>
<p>at the same time, they&rsquo;re going to deflate the dollar, they&rsquo;re going to make it harder for you</p>
<p>to find an off ramp. And he actually brought up a historical example that I wasn&rsquo;t aware of,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called executive order 6201, which is FDR, way back in the 1930s, actually had an</p>
<p>executive order that confiscated all the gold private gold bullion in the country. And they</p>
<p>seized the gold bullion, making the accusation that private citizens were hoarding too much gold.</p>
<p>So in any event, this is the theory, I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s true or not,</p>
<p>it could be a coincidence.</p>
<p>Chamath, you think that this is correlated in any way with</p>
<p>the crisis, or is just the fact that FTX blew up and all these other things blew up,</p>
<p>and the public is really upset that they lost a lot of money on this and the SEC has got to cover</p>
<p>and be a little bit more active instead of reactive when it comes to dealing with the</p>
<p>crypto losses that consumers had. That&rsquo;s the latter. I mean, I think</p>
<p>that there is a rumor going around. I don&rsquo;t know how true it is that FTX was days away</p>
<p>from getting a critical approval by the SEC to actually even further legitimize their US exchange</p>
<p>before they went out of business. So I think Gensler had to pivot very hard from at a minimum</p>
<p>being very pro FTX, and there&rsquo;s all kinds of stories about his interrelatedness with Sam and</p>
<p>his family to very anti bit or anti crypto in general, that&rsquo;s clearly happened. But look,</p>
<p>I think that this is like a lot of tin hatting, which I don&rsquo;t think is very productive. If you</p>
<p>look at the total number of non zero Bitcoin wallet addresses in the world, and let&rsquo;s be</p>
<p>extremely generous and say it&rsquo;s 100 million, there&rsquo;s still 7 billion people in the world.</p>
<p>And so I just think everybody that tries to speak about the fragility of the US and worldwide</p>
<p>banking system is right. But and that part I think is quite lucid and unemotional. But every time</p>
<p>they try to connect it to Bitcoin, they sound like a crazy person because they&rsquo;re just talking</p>
<p>their book. And that is exactly the case, by the way, with this kid, Nick Carter.</p>
<p>And the best example to demonstrate this is in all of this chaos,</p>
<p>if Bitcoin or crypto assets in general were truly a legitimate off ramp, and</p>
<p>salvation from US dollar hegemony and all of this stuff. Why isn&rsquo;t Bitcoin at least at 35,000</p>
<p>a coin right now, it&rsquo;s barely above 28,000. It really hasn&rsquo;t moved that much. And I think the</p>
<p>real answer is that most people in Bitcoin are not trying to hedge their existing fiat currency</p>
<p>exposure. They&rsquo;re just picking off people in retail. They&rsquo;re just trading this thing. I mean,</p>
<p>how else do you explain an asset that is not absolutely ripped in the face of all of this</p>
<p>terrible news about the financial system? And I think the answer is because it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>a cul-de-sac of users. It&rsquo;s not broadly available, not broadly adoptable, not broadly used.</p>
<p>I still believe that it&rsquo;s valuable. I was the earliest proponent of Bitcoin, 2011, 2012. So</p>
<p>I believe that there&rsquo;s a place for it in one&rsquo;s portfolio. But I just think connecting these dots</p>
<p>misses the point. And I think the point is much, much bigger than a crypto off ramp. The point is</p>
<p>that we have a lot of systemic shocks that are building up in the system. We have broken a ton</p>
<p>of the systems that cause the financial infrastructure in the world to work properly.</p>
<p>And we are just starting to uncover how they&rsquo;re broken. So I think we need to focus our energy on</p>
<p>that and dial down a little bit of the Bitcoin maxi stuff because it distracts from a really</p>
<p>important set of topics that are more inclusive and actually touch 7 billion people. We have to</p>
<p>do the cleanup work. And just to be perfectly clear here, Nick Carter is a career crypto,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on his third fund, his $250 million third fund, according to a quick Google search,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a partner at Castle Island Ventures. And I believe Balaji believes what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>And at the same time, is massively in Bitcoin and the $2 million he&rsquo;ll obviously lose in this</p>
<p>bet or the 99.9% chance and he said that already. I think he believes he&rsquo;s doing a service just like</p>
<p>he did believe he was doing a service with COVID. So I do not doubt his intent. But I believe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>his book is based on this and the $2 million will be he&rsquo;s a very smart, he&rsquo;s a very smart and good</p>
<p>guy. My point is put this in the who cares bucket and get back to the facts. Friedberg mentioned it,</p>
<p>we have a debt ceiling problem that&rsquo;s in the offing. Saks mentioned it, we have a commercial</p>
<p>real estate crisis. We just talked about the fact that he didn&rsquo;t raise rates enough, nor did he cut</p>
<p>enough. So we&rsquo;re in this weird middle path that Jay Powell we&rsquo;re talking about. So those are the</p>
<p>facts on the ground that I think we should focus on because those will have implications to how</p>
<p>people can borrow, start businesses, capitalized risk assets. That&rsquo;s a big problem. I guess the</p>
<p>moral hazard comes up sacks. And the critique, I think that people have had of you, you know,</p>
<p>focusing on bank bailouts, etc. has been, you have been anti bailout. And now hey, maybe backstopping</p>
<p>the deposits, not backstopping the bank, the shareholders loss, you&rsquo;re very clear about that.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about moral hazard here for a minute. Are we sort of getting enough for bail?</p>
<p>When did I say I was either?</p>
<p>I just clearly stated you&rsquo;re not I just clearly say you&rsquo;re not I&rsquo;m saying this is the critique</p>
<p>that people have had of you. So I&rsquo;m giving you a chance to address</p>
<p>Why? Why are you giving him people&rsquo;s critiques of him?</p>
<p>When nobody because I want him to talk about the future moral hazard.</p>
<p>People more than seven, six, five, four, two on Twitter.</p>
<p>Okay, I was also thinking about the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and everything.</p>
<p>Let me jump in and just clarify, I was really clear that SVB shareholders should be wiped out,</p>
<p>their bondholders should be wiped out their management, stock options should be wiped out.</p>
<p>In fact, if it turns out that they should have known the thing was about to go under,</p>
<p>I think their stock sales should be clawed back. So I&rsquo;m not in favor of bailing out SVB.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about SVB.</p>
<p>Yes, of course. Now let&rsquo;s do that for commercial real estate.</p>
<p>No, the question is what you do with deposits and depositors.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>I think there is a real debate about how you treat depositors in a banking crisis.</p>
<p>And I think there are two views on that. There&rsquo;s kind of an old fashioned view.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s kind of a more modern regulatory view. The old fashioned view</p>
<p>is that if your money is in a bank, and that bank goes under, and you know, you&rsquo;re over the FDIC</p>
<p>amount, you lose your money. And we need people in the system to lose their money, because that</p>
<p>creates discipline on the banks, it&rsquo;ll make those depositors do a better job shopping for the right</p>
<p>bank. That&rsquo;s kind of what I would call the old fashioned hardline view. There&rsquo;s a more modern</p>
<p>regulatory view, which is that, listen, the typical depositor, even a fairly sophisticated</p>
<p>depositor, like a small business, or even a high net worth individual, they&rsquo;re not in a position</p>
<p>to evaluate the balance sheet of these banks. How are they going to figure out if there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>toxic assets that are hidden on the balance sheet of these banks?</p>
<p>Regulators didn&rsquo;t see it with Silicon Valley Bank and a lot of these banks.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really get that much more moral hazard by putting the depositor on the hook for that.</p>
<p>Remember, the management of the bank already is penalized severely by losing all their stock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get to before Chamath interrupted me, I&rsquo;m trying to get to the bigger moral hazard</p>
<p>picture here, which is Jason, fuck you before you interrupt me. But the point, eat your nuts for a</p>
<p>second. The point I&rsquo;m trying to get to is should commercial real estate? Should that be bailed out?</p>
<p>How should society look at that next card that you are saying is going to tip over?</p>
<p>How would you handle that piece? Should they?</p>
<p>Okay, well, let me just finish on depositors. So the modern regulatory view is that when you</p>
<p>open a bank account, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to think about the bank&rsquo;s balance sheet. You just want it</p>
<p>to be safe. You don&rsquo;t want all the brain damage. And, and look, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of merit to</p>
<p>that argument. As it turns out, I&rsquo;ve been trying to look into this, how much would it cost the</p>
<p>system to just fully ensure depositors, it turns out that we have about 17 and a half trillion in</p>
<p>deposits in the US almost 818 trillion. And one of the misnomers you&rsquo;ll hear as well, it would</p>
<p>cost us 18 trillion to basically ensure all the depositors. That&rsquo;s not true. Because first of all,</p>
<p>10 trillion people don&rsquo;t even know already insured under FDIC. It&rsquo;s only about seven and a half to</p>
<p>eight trillion. That&rsquo;s less than half is left. Okay. That&rsquo;s right. Exactly. It&rsquo;s about it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>around 8 trillion. So isn&rsquo;t it shocking the innumeracy of people that make these claims?</p>
<p>This is why the podcast is top 20 or top 10 in the world, because we&rsquo;re actually breaking down</p>
<p>the numbers. Right. So the leading proponent of this theory that we should just basically</p>
<p>not bail out, but backstop the deposits is Bill Ackman. And he&rsquo;s been making, I think,</p>
<p>a pretty compelling case that if you don&rsquo;t protect deposits at small banks, all the money is going</p>
<p>to flow to the top four banks. That&rsquo;s already happening. Yeah, we&rsquo;re watching it happen,</p>
<p>right. So I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out how much it would actually cost us to do that.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;ve realized is that it&rsquo;s not 18 trillion, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s 8 trillion. But by the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the amount of deposits, that&rsquo;s not the risk premium. So if you look at FDIC, at the end of</p>
<p>last year, there was about 130 billion that have been paid into the FDIC fund by premiums paid by</p>
<p>these banks. So in other words, the insurance premium paid by banks was about 1.3%. So if you</p>
<p>were to now additionally cover the whole thing, all the deposits, it would be another roughly</p>
<p>100 billion of premiums paid by these banks. That seems very manageable to me, actually,</p>
<p>the question is, is the FDIC fund adequate? And I think we&rsquo;re about to find out it may be the</p>
<p>case that a 1.3% insurance premium, grossly, you know, understated the true risk of putting</p>
<p>your deposit in a bank. And we&rsquo;re about to find out that the FDIC is inadequate. I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the answer to that question. I think this boils down to the profitability that an equity shareholder</p>
<p>of a bank expects of them. And to your point, is it viable for large GSIBs to</p>
<p>guarantee 100% of their deposits? Absolutely. The implication of that will be an enormous</p>
<p>hit to their short term profitability and their return on invested capital,</p>
<p>it would just take a massive hit. And so as a result, the stocks of those banks would fall</p>
<p>pretty precipitously, which would have a real negative impact on the executives and the CEOs</p>
<p>of those banks and the shareholders that own those bank equities. So I think, ultimately,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll come down to that decision, which is that if you do want to protect the depositor</p>
<p>in the American banking system, 100% for every dollar, and do it in a simple way,</p>
<p>it will come at the sake of the equity holders of the banks. And if you&rsquo;re willing to make that</p>
<p>trade off, then you can guarantee 100% of the deposits. If you do not want to make that trade</p>
<p>off, then the equity holders will still retain more value than they would otherwise.</p>
<p>And Freeberg, we&rsquo;ve seen a couple of examples of the market, the free market,</p>
<p>looking at the situation and making new products and services. Wealthfront, Mercury Bank, both</p>
<p>talked about load balancing across 12 accounts, $3 million. So that would make some people who</p>
<p>had over 250k just instantly be back stopped and insured. And then where, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>discussion of which I talked about last week, hey, why don&rsquo;t you just have a vault where you pay a</p>
<p>bank to hold your money safely? I got a ton of responses from all in fans, pointing out multiple</p>
<p>banks and services that have been trying to do this, and also crypto solution. So is there going</p>
<p>to be a free market solution, you think, or when we&rsquo;re starting to see them emerge, that maybe</p>
<p>covers this gap a little bit freeberg. And then what are your thoughts just generally on should</p>
<p>we backstop the banks and the deposit? I&rsquo;m sorry, the banks, the depositors, to be clear.</p>
<p>So if we just quickly analyze the function of a bank, they loan money to either residential real</p>
<p>estate buyers, like homeowners, or commercial real estate buyers or businesses that need it,</p>
<p>I think the majority of the capital goes to residential real estate. And if they can&rsquo;t loan</p>
<p>enough money, they typically buy bonds, right, they buy other people&rsquo;s loans, in the form of</p>
<p>bond securities, like treasuries, or asset backed securities, or other things like that,</p>
<p>or mortgage backed securities. So they use the cash to make those investments to make those</p>
<p>loans, and then they obviously earn a return on that. You know, I think we&rsquo;ve talked about this</p>
<p>in the past, the thing that biology, I think, has misstated, and it would be good to have a</p>
<p>conversation with him about this publicly, because I have listened to some of his interviews in the</p>
<p>last couple days. He says the banks are they don&rsquo;t have the money that you the depositor</p>
<p>thinks that you have. And so what he&rsquo;s saying kind of implies that there is no money that there is no</p>
<p>asset value there at all. He uses Sam bankman freed and FTX as an example, that the money that</p>
<p>was given to Sam bankman freed, you know, exchange fund was used to buy assets that then very quickly</p>
<p>declined in value by 99%. But he held them on the book at 100%. And then he reinvested the money and</p>
<p>all sorts of other different stuff. And in the case of the loans made by banks, and the assets</p>
<p>that they as a result hold, the value may have dropped by 25%, in kind of the worst case, which</p>
<p>is, you know, the Silicon Valley bank tenure, Treasury bond scenario, where they bought, you</p>
<p>know, all $20 billion worth of Treasury bonds. And, you know, they took a big hit on that. But</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s no asset value, it means that the value has declined. And typically,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a buffer between the asset value that the banks are meant to hold, and the deposits that they</p>
<p>owe back to their customers. And if that buffer gets exceeded, then the bank is technically has</p>
<p>negative equity. And if all the, you know, depositors said, I want my money back, and they</p>
<p>went and sold those bonds into the market, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make the depositors whole.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t mean that depositors end up with zero, it means instead of getting 100 cents on</p>
<p>the dollar, they get 93 cents on the dollar 88 cents on the dollar. And it would require an</p>
<p>orderly dissolution of the bank&rsquo;s assets selling those bonds into the market to generate the cash</p>
<p>to pay back the depositors. So the reason we&rsquo;ve seen this kind of this Fed vertical spike number</p>
<p>is because assets are moving so quickly, depositors are moving their value so quickly</p>
<p>from one bank to another, that in order for the banks to make the cash available to those</p>
<p>depositors, they&rsquo;ve had to borrow from the Fed. And then they&rsquo;re going into the market and doing</p>
<p>this kind of, they should be doing this orderly asset sale of the bonds to generate the cash</p>
<p>to pay back the Fed, which is musical chairs, money, causing these problems as musical chairs.</p>
<p>And if the musical chair stop, then we don&rsquo;t have this problem, correct.</p>
<p>So if people stopped moving deposits around, then you&rsquo;re right, the banks wouldn&rsquo;t need to borrow</p>
<p>money to give depositors their money and then go do the work of selling the bonds in the market</p>
<p>people free moving their money around because of the</p>
<p>so here we go. So you just ensure it and this whole thing stops. So nothing to just say that</p>
<p>right? Yeah. So here&rsquo;s the thing, Jacob, you mentioned this case that you hear a lot of</p>
<p>people saying, Well, why don&rsquo;t you just take your two and a half million dollars and break it up</p>
<p>into 10 accounts, which is what people are doing? Yeah, yeah. Well, look, it&rsquo;s not feasible when</p>
<p>you need to run a big payroll at the end of the month, and you got payables, it&rsquo;s administratively</p>
<p>too complicated. And by the way, what have you accomplished doing that? You haven&rsquo;t solved</p>
<p>anything. So who hasn&rsquo;t accomplished for the startup? It has given that prediction system?</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t you just raise FDIC to two and a half million or have FDIC be based on the number</p>
<p>of employees in your company or allow a higher class a business class of FDIC that goes up to</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. There&rsquo;s 10 million and in exchange, the quid pro quo has to be that the bank can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>put that money in risky assets. Why is this not this is so obvious.</p>
<p>The reason I walked through that whole explanation, because I want to answer your</p>
<p>question. I&rsquo;m sorry, it took so long. But like, I want to highlight that because that is what</p>
<p>an insurance underwriter put aside the FDIC and put aside banks and put aside the government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>role. Yes, that&rsquo;s what an insurance underwriters job would be, they would look at the volatility</p>
<p>and the pricing on the bonds that the bank holds. And they would determine ultimately two things,</p>
<p>probability of loss and severity of loss. And the probability is how likely is it that you end up in</p>
<p>negative equity, and that you have people requesting money, and you have to sell those</p>
<p>bonds at a loss very quickly. And then the severity is how much would you actually lose?</p>
<p>So if, if you know, the Fed raises rates by 3%, and your entire book is tied up in 10 year bonds,</p>
<p>you see a 25% decline in the value of your bond portfolio. That&rsquo;s as bad as it gets. If you start</p>
<p>with a 10% buffer. Now, you only have 85% of the money you owe the depositors. So your loss is 15</p>
<p>cents on the dollar. So the insurance company would say, what&rsquo;s the probability of that event</p>
<p>happening? How much should we underwrite it for? What should we charge as a premium to do that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s ultimately how the rates would get set. Now, the problem with most insurance</p>
<p>models around this sort of a problem set is that these are the extreme tail events that have never</p>
<p>happened. And so the insurance to Sachs&rsquo;s point is super cheap, leading up to the extreme tail event.</p>
<p>And then everyone&rsquo;s like, Oh, my gosh, we underpaid for so many years, we didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>how severe the losses could have been, we didn&rsquo;t realize how significant this was going to be.</p>
<p>And as a result, you now see this kind of multiplying effect, because people are like,</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh, if it happened to them, it could happen to me, let&rsquo;s all sell and it gets worse</p>
<p>and worse and worse. And so you know, the real rate for the insurance going forward will now</p>
<p>have to take into account this massive risk. But the game theory problem is as taxes point out,</p>
<p>if you just ensure everyone, the cost of the insurance actually goes way, way, way, way down,</p>
<p>because now you don&rsquo;t have this money movement problem. And so you know, the point is, the more</p>
<p>you ensure at this point, the cheaper the insurance will actually be. If you&rsquo;re an actuarial or free</p>
<p>market underwriter, you know, free market kind of, you know, underwriting process on this thing,</p>
<p>because now the probability of having this bank run goes way, way down. And therefore,</p>
<p>the cost of the insurance should go way down. And so the irony is, if you actually did,</p>
<p>and this is getting super technical. But if you actually looked at the statistical model and said,</p>
<p>how much is this going to cost to ensure every deposit, it gets much, much cheaper,</p>
<p>the higher the the deposits that you&rsquo;re willing to ensure would be, that&rsquo;s my sense of what the</p>
<p>free market would do here. And it&rsquo;s certainly what I think the federal government should probably</p>
<p>think about doing if they&rsquo;re going to continue to play a role in backstopping banks, the net net</p>
<p>is people. startups right now are doing five to 10 banks, I&rsquo;m watching it happen. They&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>all these sweep accounts, they&rsquo;re doing multiple accounts. So the government, if it doesn&rsquo;t raise</p>
<p>the FDIC limit is basically just creating extra work for everybody, and it&rsquo;s going to be the same</p>
<p>outcome. So this people are going to the street will find its own use for technology and how to</p>
<p>hack this. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening with these services. Yeah, time just to steal man, the the</p>
<p>old fashioned view or the traditional view of this, they would say that, well, you want those startups</p>
<p>being paranoid, you want those startups doing the work of disciplining these banks by moving their</p>
<p>money elsewhere, if they detect a problem. However, the problem with that is you get these bank runs,</p>
<p>that is what a bank run is, in parts, is people moving their money, because they&rsquo;re fearing</p>
<p>that the bank is not doing a good job with their loan portfolio. So this is why in the let&rsquo;s call</p>
<p>it the olden days before FDIC, we had bank runs and panics all the time. And that&rsquo;s why FDIC</p>
<p>was invented. So there&rsquo;s a hugely destructive problem that comes along with placing the</p>
<p>depositor in charge of disciplining the banks. And I would argue that the depositor is not the</p>
<p>best person to do it, it&rsquo;s the regulator, just to kind of layer on what what Friberg was saying.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like a fundamental market failure with banking, in the sense that the depositor,</p>
<p>or the consumer and the bank think they&rsquo;re getting two completely different things.</p>
<p>When you open a bank account or a checking account, you think you&rsquo;re getting a checkbook,</p>
<p>an ATM card, a place to do payroll run, you know, and it&rsquo;s a service, it&rsquo;s a service,</p>
<p>and maybe you make a little bit of interest, but it&rsquo;s not even your main motivation. Okay,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you think you&rsquo;re getting your money, most of all is safe. Because you&rsquo;re not signing</p>
<p>up with a service provider to have any chance of losing your money. You&rsquo;re not gambling, right?</p>
<p>But now what does the bank think it&rsquo;s getting? You know what the bank thinks it&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>an unsecured loan, that they can then turn around and invest in whatever they want,</p>
<p>or whatever the law. So there&rsquo;s a disconnect between the parties and the transaction.</p>
<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s a total disconnect. And moreover, the way the management of the bank is compensated,</p>
<p>is that they only have to pay back your loan, your deposit, basically, is their loan at par.</p>
<p>And anything they make on a bet that they make with that money, they get to keep,</p>
<p>they get to keep all the upside, their stockholders and management get to keep that.</p>
<p>And those incentives are what are driving this. And that&rsquo;s what drove the risk in all</p>
<p>likelihood at Silicon Valley Bank, they were getting $200 billion, whatever percentage point</p>
<p>they got from off. Somehow, the executive team was</p>
<p>their incentive. It&rsquo;s not just them, but the whole banking system creates the incentive,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re highly leveraged. The deposits from their standpoint, are leveraged, they&rsquo;re leveraged 10 to</p>
<p>one. So their incentive is to go to the casino and gamble it because they get to keep all the upside.</p>
<p>And if they lose it, it&rsquo;s basically someone else on the final word.</p>
<p>In early May, the Fed will release their investigation into Signature Bank and SVB.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Powell said that this week. I think it&rsquo;ll be really interesting to see how much honesty they</p>
<p>both put into the report, and then whether the entirety of that report is made available to</p>
<p>the rest of us to read. But I think Sachs has very elegantly summarized what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out that this doesn&rsquo;t make sense. So the question is,</p>
<p>what is the tolerance that we have for changing something that clearly is mischaracterized?</p>
<p>What consumers think they&rsquo;re getting and what banks are then doing are two totally different</p>
<p>things. And if the Fed actually is really, really honest, and really lays bare everything that</p>
<p>happened, it&rsquo;ll be very hard to not legislate changes based on it.</p>
<p>And this your best swing at a legislative change would be watch him off. What is the</p>
<p>what is the low hanging fruit? What&rsquo;s the layup here?</p>
<p>Well, I think we&rsquo;ve seen this happening in other markets for a while, which is that</p>
<p>banks have become in fairness to them, much, much better at risk management post Dodd-Frank post</p>
<p>great financial crisis. And the result of that is that there&rsquo;s been a lot of emerging</p>
<p>private credit markets because most the bank is about lending, right? They&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>buying equities, they&rsquo;re lending money. They&rsquo;re a debtor in possession of something, right. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a just a massive explosion of private credit. And it started in the most</p>
<p>obvious areas. It started in things like CLOs, it started in asset backed securities,</p>
<p>solar car loans, credit cards, mortgages, private equity backed deals.</p>
<p>So I think the rational answer is that banks need to protect 100% of deposits.</p>
<p>And that if they want to have extracurricular activities, if you will,</p>
<p>they need to be able to raise money from investors, put that to work in a really fair</p>
<p>and transparent way. And then share in the profits between all of the related parties</p>
<p>that are involved in that transaction, no different than any other risk taking organization.</p>
<p>And I think that this is now what we&rsquo;ve probably shined a light on</p>
<p>is in really odd loophole that just needs to get closed in 2023.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such easy, easy, hygienic changes here.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s put it a different way. If you raised money for a liquid hedge fund that</p>
<p>had quarterly redemptions, and then violated the LPA and stuffed it into private companies</p>
<p>that had 10 year illiquidity, there would be hell to pay. And vice versa. If you raise money on 10</p>
<p>year illiquid locked up capital on the presumption you were going to invest in startups, and then</p>
<p>instead put it in the stock market thinking that you could flip it and make some money,</p>
<p>you would have violated the LPA and there&rsquo;d be hell to pay. Similarly, I think what Sachs is</p>
<p>stating is that there is a mismatch of what the depositor in this case, the investor expects,</p>
<p>and what the risk manager is doing. And I think that you have to correct that one way or the</p>
<p>other, make it abundantly clear that we&rsquo;re never going to ensure 100% and deal with that risk.</p>
<p>Or make it 100% and deal with the fallout, which is largely about wiping out a lot of</p>
<p>equity value in banks. LPA equals limited partnership agreement.</p>
<p>Just to clarify one thing, I&rsquo;m not saying that these bank managers are all going to the casino</p>
<p>and gambling the money. I think that they are generally more responsible than that. What I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying is that the incentives created by this crazy system we call banking, create a weird</p>
<p>incentive for them to gamble because they&rsquo;re so highly levered. From their standpoint,</p>
<p>your deposits are their leverage. Everybody but the GSIBs because I think the GSIBs there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much scrutiny. If you look at how well run Citi, B of A, Wells and JPM are relative and contrast</p>
<p>them to the sub GSIBs. It&rsquo;s like night and day. And so the other thing that I think we&rsquo;ve realized</p>
<p>is who thought it was a good idea to raise the bar on eligibility from 50 billion of assets to 200.</p>
<p>Clearly now that made no sense. It makes more sense to actually categorize every bank</p>
<p>as systemically important, maybe not globally, but at a minimum to the US economy,</p>
<p>because these people play a vital function in society. And they were allowed to take a</p>
<p>much more aggressive risk posture because they were able to lobby the government to change the</p>
<p>rules. The CEO of TikTok, which claims to be an American company now, or an international company</p>
<p>was in front of Congress today. His name is show chew. This is the first time he&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>I think, spoken publicly in an extended period, four and a half hours, he was grilled.</p>
<p>And it was absolutely brutal. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen a congressional hearing that was</p>
<p>bipartisan in a long time. And he said that, quote, the bottom line is, this is an American</p>
<p>date. This is American data on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel,</p>
<p>and then was immediately squirrely when asked if Chinese employees, including engineers have</p>
<p>access to this US data. And he said, this is a complex subject, over and over again, he was</p>
<p>evasive. And this did not look good for TikTok. Well, I think now becomes does it become divested</p>
<p>and go public? Or does it get shut down? sex? I think his goose was cooked as soon as they asked</p>
<p>him the question. In preparation for this hearing, did you consult with any member of the CCP?</p>
<p>And he could not just outright say no. Nope. So that&rsquo;s his goose was cooked as soon as he</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t just say no. What do you think about the bipartisan nature of this? And what do you</p>
<p>think the outcome is sex? Well, this is one of the rare things where it is bipartisan. I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so much outrage and anger at this. I think that they should let the company divest it.</p>
<p>I think it is divestiture or shutdown for TikTok. Since we&rsquo;re not communist here,</p>
<p>I think they should be given the chance to fully divest to an American owned company.</p>
<p>But look, I just wish that there was as much bipartisan consensus and outrage directed not</p>
<p>just at Chinese spying of Americans, but on the American deep state spying on Americans, because</p>
<p>we just had hearings showing that the American government conducts elaborate spying operations,</p>
<p>surveillance of Americans on social media, this was all revealed in the Twitter files.</p>
<p>And we got certainly no bipartisan consensus on that Republicans were outraged, but</p>
<p>Democrats tried to portray it as some sort of spat between Trump and Chrissy Teigen. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all they wanted to talk about. So I would like to see this problem comprehensively addressed.</p>
<p>And that means I think, TikTok going into the hands of an American company, but I also</p>
<p>would like more assurances that American companies will not be working with the deep state to spy on</p>
<p>us and infringe on Chrissy Teigen and Donald Trump, who are two people you&rsquo;d never invite to</p>
<p>a dinner party. Freeberg, what are your thoughts? Is it going to divest? Should it be forced to</p>
<p>divest? being intellectually honest about it? What are your thoughts on TikTok in America?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ve shared this in the past, I think they&rsquo;re probably going to have to</p>
<p>spin this thing out. And if they hold any equity, if the Chinese parent company holds</p>
<p>any equity interest, it&rsquo;ll probably be non voting shares. And there&rsquo;ll be a mandate that the</p>
<p>majority of the shares and some degree of oversight. I believe that&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>From a national security issue for America to force them to do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, from a national security point of view, I really don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t have an opinion</p>
<p>on national security and TikTok. I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve always thought that TikTok was a really,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right word? Like, it&rsquo;s like a firefly for, you know, Chinese invasion. And it feels</p>
<p>like, you know, it&rsquo;s a very easy kind of target for I think, what is generally a big kind of</p>
<p>social consciousness right now. So, you know, whether or not there&rsquo;s actually like, some</p>
<p>national security points, if there were, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that national security person would</p>
<p>have stood up and said, we need to stop this thing. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve heard that publicly.</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>But I will say like, my point of view from like, just seeing the political behavior is that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re probably going to mandate that these guys spin this thing out to us investors and,</p>
<p>and that they, you know, don&rsquo;t own any that the Chinese don&rsquo;t have any equity or management</p>
<p>oversight or interest in it.</p>
<p>Chamath in China itself, the Chinese government does not allow kids to play video games during</p>
<p>the week and only three hours on the weekend. They&rsquo;re using apps like WeChat to dictate</p>
<p>social score and social behavior, whether it&rsquo;s smoking on a train or not paying your bills.</p>
<p>And they are saying they will not divest. But any buddy who is an investor in a company that</p>
<p>had a chance to go public for 10s of billions of dollars and eventually take on and people</p>
<p>believe that this is a viable competitor to Facebook and Instagram, this could be a company</p>
<p>worth ultimately hundreds of billions of dollars. If you were an investor in China, you would want</p>
<p>to IPO, you would want to get liquidity. So if they are refusing to sell, what does that tell</p>
<p>you as a market participated in participant in somebody who&rsquo;s been a capital allocator for over</p>
<p>a decade, there&rsquo;s bigger problems in China than even tick tock us represents for them.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably what it means. So it&rsquo;s a pretty bad tell.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think divestiture is a real option. Because when you think about the details of that,</p>
<p>how will the government be satisfied that the code base was separated elegantly,</p>
<p>that there was no malware surreptitiously planted? How will you actually prove all of this</p>
<p>to a degree that satisfies a legislator? So I think the pound of flesh that they want,</p>
<p>is more easily and more salaciously satisfied by shutting the thing down.</p>
<p>So if I had to bet on what happens, I bet more on that. I didn&rsquo;t think tick tock did a very good</p>
<p>job. And I think that there are some, they were terrible today. And I think that there are some</p>
<p>real issues around how much control does actually flow back. I don&rsquo;t think that it was definitive,</p>
<p>he needed to be much clearer and adamant that this was an independent business that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have backdoors to China and the CCP to appease Congress. He didn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>No, he was like, I have to check in on that. I&rsquo;m not sure. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it was a little bit of the exact opposite. Actually, sax is right. Like that first question</p>
<p>was just the death blow right from the beginning. It&rsquo;s like, oh, this is not going to go in a good</p>
<p>place. Because they should have been able to see that that question was going to get asked.</p>
<p>And you need to have that asked and answered philosophy where the only answer is no.</p>
<p>The only answer you could have given is no. And the fact that he wasn&rsquo;t able to say that.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a fact that complete as soon as soon as that was in my mind, I was like,</p>
<p>this thing is getting shut down. Because I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a shutdown. Yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no divestiture plan that can be technically audited in a short amount of time</p>
<p>to appease these folks. They want a pound of flesh. And then separately, the bigger issue that I think</p>
<p>you have to deal with is, what does that mean for how other governments may be pressured to act,</p>
<p>who want to be on the pro US camp? And I think that that&rsquo;s a question because</p>
<p>bike dance and Tick Tock have presence beyond just China and the US. A third question is,</p>
<p>how does the golden vote get used on the bike dance board? And what do they do? And do they</p>
<p>even want this thing public explain golden vote, essentially, they&rsquo;ll decide what happens to that</p>
<p>company. And they have that in Alibaba, they have that I think, a 10 cent, I think they have that</p>
<p>at bike dance. So the Chinese government has a very strong hand in the direction of these</p>
<p>business. And then the final point is that there&rsquo;s a secondary app that Tick Tock has called CapCut,</p>
<p>which also is enormously popular in the United States, which is yet another potential backdoor</p>
<p>for privacy or spying violations, whatever the US Congress wants to pin on them. So</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very complicated moment for that business and their US asset</p>
<p>sacks. It&rsquo;s pretty clear the CCP is making this decision. If they decide, let it burn,</p>
<p>let it get kicked out of the United States. What does that do in terms of game theory between the</p>
<p>two countries? And going forward, because obviously, they don&rsquo;t reciprocate, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>allowed to have Google, Twitter, Instagram, whatever in China. So is this just, you know,</p>
<p>what? What decision you&rsquo;re saying the CCP is making? Well, the CCP has the golden vote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their decision to divest or not divest. Chamath believes they will not divest.</p>
<p>I believe they will not.</p>
<p>Chamath is saying that is they&rsquo;re not going to have the choice. I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t see what</p>
<p>decision the CCP has in this. It&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t divest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. They&rsquo;re there. It&rsquo;s not a divest or don&rsquo;t divest. I think it&rsquo;ll be shut down.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re getting kicked out of the United States.</p>
<p>Okay, do you but you believe they&rsquo;re going to divest sacks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that that&rsquo;s what I would support. Just to give them the chance.</p>
<p>So what do you think is going to happen?</p>
<p>Chamath may be right. I&rsquo;m not sure. But I think they should be given the chance. And if you truly</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t move the servers to the United States and vet the code base, I feel like you could,</p>
<p>I think you could have an acquire or figure it out, you know, vet the code base, move the data</p>
<p>centers, make sure there&rsquo;s no back doors. I think it&rsquo;s not impossible, hard, but not impossible.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s go with the scenario that it gets kicked out of the United States is shut down.</p>
<p>Are there any second or third order impacts?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s it ratchets up the tension between the US and China, but we&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already there. Yeah, we&rsquo;re already there.</p>
<p>No change. All right. Listen, this has been an amazing episode. Oh, Chamath. Did your 3d</p>
<p>rocket company make it to space? I saw they had a nice little liftoff there.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jason. I just wanted to give a shout out this is like,</p>
<p>while all this chaos is happening in the world, it&rsquo;s amazing to see</p>
<p>pretty incredible engineering. So last night, we did have a successful launch.</p>
<p>So relativity has a 85% 3d printed rocket, which over time, we want to try to get to</p>
<p>95%. But it&rsquo;s the fuselage, it&rsquo;s the engines.</p>
<p>It brings the cost of spaceflight down by an order of magnitude. It is a hugely disruptive</p>
<p>idea. And so what they tried to prove was that they could get this thing into space.</p>
<p>And they accomplished a lot of goals, they got past Max Q, which is sort of the point at which</p>
<p>the atmospheric pressure is the strongest on the fuselage. So we proved structural integrity,</p>
<p>we got to main engine cutoff, we had stage two separation.</p>
<p>So a lot of really important technical milestones were achieved, it allows them now to unlock</p>
<p>a bunch of contracts that allow us frankly, just to keep going and building, there&rsquo;s still a lot</p>
<p>of work to do from here, we&rsquo;re building now the next generation rocket, which is called Terran R,</p>
<p>and rocket engines, which can take instead of 1500 kilograms, about 20,000 kilos. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m enormously proud to have been around this journey. My partner Jay has been really</p>
<p>the key person on it. But I just wanted to give a huge shout out to Tim Ellis and the team at</p>
<p>Relativity. It&rsquo;s super, super, super cool what they pulled off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just amazing how access to space is being democratized and the prices are being lowered</p>
<p>so dramatically. What&rsquo;s the impact that&rsquo;s going to have ultimately, Friedberg, you think,</p>
<p>on humanity? I mean, obviously, going to Mars is this incredible feat, technologically and</p>
<p>just mind blowing. But what do you think the net result of all this space activity is going to be</p>
<p>for the human condition and the species?</p>
<p>I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a vibrant community of startups and money coming into this space right</p>
<p>now. I do think all these guys are going to have to in order to gain wider spread capital markets</p>
<p>attention, like Elon has had to do with SpaceX, they&rsquo;re going to have to find business models</p>
<p>that have kind of near term viability that don&rsquo;t depend on government contracts.</p>
<p>Like Starlink.</p>
<p>Like Starlink. Yeah. And so I think that&rsquo;s the key question. And obviously,</p>
<p>these are very capital intensive businesses, they have very long horizons</p>
<p>to hit their milestones. So there&rsquo;s certainly capital available in the early stages</p>
<p>to make bets on whether or not they can get these milestones. But But, you know,</p>
<p>the broader kind of attention and capital markets is going to come from these things</p>
<p>building real kind of businesses that generate value for consumers and markets.</p>
<p>You know, one of the things that I think can unlock</p>
<p>opportunity for this market overall, is low cost energy. You know, if we can get below, call it</p>
<p>$0.01 to $0.03 kilowatt hour of power, call it $0.01 kilowatt hour power, I forgot the exact</p>
<p>relationship, you can get very cheap, you know, hydrogen and oxygen fuel sources. And so you know,</p>
<p>the it&rsquo;s funny, if you actually play out the scale factor for space, for the space industry,</p>
<p>much of it at scale will get driven by the cost of electricity. So it&rsquo;s another reason why there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be, I think, a pretty tight coupling between the cost of power and ultimately,</p>
<p>the vibrancy of this market. You mentioned something important. The other key thing</p>
<p>that we proved was that this is a pure methylox engine, so CH four and liquid oxygen. And it was</p>
<p>not just stage one, but also stage two, which is unique. The only other folks that have tried to</p>
<p>prove that you could have multi stage methylox is China and their most recent launch failed,</p>
<p>but it highly simplifies the engineering problem at hand.</p>
<p>Especially the ground operations and whatnot, and sort of like filling these rockets and making</p>
<p>them viable. So that was another really big milestone, which is the producing of that fuel</p>
<p>Friedberg requires energy. If that energy was cheap, it would be cheaper to make and process</p>
<p>that fuel. That&rsquo;s right. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a pretty, pretty direct tie in particularly with scale</p>
<p>manufacturing on fuel that would be used in these rocket systems and, and power prices here on</p>
<p>earth. So if and as we get power prices down, either through scaled renewables, or ideally</p>
<p>fusion or some other kind of new technology, or nuclear fission or something, then the cost of,</p>
<p>you know, fuel and the cost of these space programs goes down. And that ultimately, I think</p>
<p>the real question everyone asks is how do you get away from it just being government services</p>
<p>businesses, which, you know, have a low multiple in markets, and obviously, you know, high</p>
<p>dependency on one or two key customers? And how do you actually get private markets, private</p>
<p>market products moving? So tourism obviously makes a lot of sense. Travel, you know, around</p>
<p>the earth in 20 minutes or something, or, you know, some people have talked about mining or</p>
<p>colonies, and you know, who would fund that real estate, it&rsquo;s unclear right now what the</p>
<p>traveling is a wild one. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve talked to you on about that. But the idea that you could</p>
<p>have a rocket ship take off from Texas, and then be in Tokyo, you know, like half an hour minutes</p>
<p>later is I can only speak for myself, but I would really like to visit Uranus Reaper.</p>
<p>All right, everybody. Look at the player here. He&rsquo;s got layers are for players. Sexy. Look at</p>
<p>this. He is he is two layers. And can you get an ascot? It&rsquo;s subtle, isn&rsquo;t it? He&rsquo;s pulling a Steve</p>
<p>Bannon. You got to get more disheveled. He needs the six pens in the color pens. No shave. Can you</p>
<p>tell us? Do you have a stylist, an actual person you pay to the rescue? Nick, can you please put</p>
<p>the picture of Steve Bannon where he wears the multiple? I&rsquo;m gonna do this again. I need to stop</p>
<p>attacking me. It&rsquo;s really weird. Oh, yeah. Bannon. He thinks you&rsquo;re a venture</p>
<p>vulture capitalist or something. He&rsquo;s been attacking you.</p>
<p>Bannon was attacking me on Twitter. I think on his podcasts. I think Yeah,</p>
<p>you seem to have made a lot of a lot of new friends on Twitter lately,</p>
<p>when you pass around half a million followers. Basically, what happens is you become a</p>
<p>politician, you will know there will always be a fringe element of people who need to manage</p>
<p>their anxiety by venting. And that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re feeling. You will live that now at million use,</p>
<p>you know, followers, 2 million, 10 million, whatever, there&rsquo;s always going to be a small</p>
<p>percentage. J. Cal doesn&rsquo;t know this, because he has mostly bots that are his followers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true. Real when you have real people, this is what it is, you&rsquo;ll get this 1% or less than 1%.</p>
<p>And just the number goes up. So I would ignore it. Don&rsquo;t care. Don&rsquo;t worry about what user 747</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feed the brigadoons don&rsquo;t care what seven user 74786 has to say. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Yeah,</p>
<p>absolutely. I love you. All right. And I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing you on Thursday.</p>
<p>For the rain man himself, David sacks, the sultan of science and principanic attacks</p>
<p>our pal David Friedberg and the host with the most going to make me what about me? What about</p>
<p>me? I&rsquo;m going them calling you the host with the most I&rsquo;m adding something the host with the most</p>
<p>is making me the she so leaf tempura with Hokkaido. And you are the world&rsquo;s best genuflector.</p>
<p>I am the world&rsquo;s greatest guest, greatest houseguest. If you need a houseguest to look</p>
<p>at your house, Italy, Tokyo, Niseko, wherever you need a houseguest, I&rsquo;m ready to come and make</p>
<p>it a good time. You&rsquo;re the modern Kato Kaelin. You&rsquo;re horrible. Absolutely the best. You keep</p>
<p>inviting me every week. You are enjoyable, though. Love you, boys. Let&rsquo;s have fun. Bye,</p>
