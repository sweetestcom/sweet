    <p>It wasn&rsquo;t just a one on one.</p>
<p>It could be Steve against the team going,</p>
<p>we need glass instead of plastic</p>
<p>on the front face of the iPhone.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to do this.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, God, you know, and so we did it.</p>
<p>And he pushed us because he didn&rsquo;t know all the details,</p>
<p>but he could see in our minds that we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,</p>
<p>but man, it&rsquo;s really putting us in risk.</p>
<p>And we laid out the risks for him.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m willing to take those risks.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Tony Fadell,</p>
<p>engineer and designer, co creator of the iPod,</p>
<p>the iPhone and the Nest Thermostat.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the author of the new book, Build,</p>
<p>an unorthodox guide to making things worth making.</p>
<p>More than almost any human ever,</p>
<p>he knows what it takes to create technology ideas,</p>
<p>designs, products and companies that revolutionize life</p>
<p>for huge numbers of people in the world.</p>
<p>So it truly is an honor and pleasure</p>
<p>to sit down with Tony for a time</p>
<p>and look back at one heck of an amazing life.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Readman podcast.</p>

<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Tony Fadell.</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love with computers?</p>
<p>Or let&rsquo;s say computer engineering and design?</p>
<p>I first fell in love with computers and programming.</p>
<p>Was it a summer school class in fifth grade</p>
<p>in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan?</p>
<p>It was a simple basic programming class,</p>
<p>but the basic programming class</p>
<p>was not like you might think it was.</p>
<p>It was bubble cards.</p>
<p>So literally it was the cards, the stack of cards,</p>
<p>and you would use a number two pencil and you would put in</p>
<p>your program line by line,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d have to make sure it was perfectly stacked</p>
<p>and no errors and what have you.</p>
<p>And you would take that set of cards</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d put it on this reader and it would zzzt, zzzt, zzzt.</p>
<p>And it would go off to an IBM microcomputer</p>
<p>somewhere in the, back then the cloud.</p>
<p>And then you would sit on a Texas Instruments paper terminal.</p>
<p>And it would just, literally I was just,</p>
<p>I could write things and it would,</p>
<p>I could program this machine to do stuff.</p>
<p>And it was, you know, it was nowhere near sexy.</p>
<p>There was no graphics, right?</p>
<p>Oregon Trail was all in text, right?</p>
<p>The cards were so cumbersome that if you got one thing wrong</p>
<p>or out of order, or a disaster, or you dropped one card,</p>
<p>it would all fall apart.</p>
<p>So just doing that, you know, print f,</p>
<p>or what was it?</p>
<p>I can only remember what it was.</p>
<p>It was, you know, what the basic commands were, but.</p>
<p>Oh, so when you say basic, you mean basic programming?</p>
<p>Programming language.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Basic programming.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re writing basic programming language on paper.</p>
<p>On paper.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re calling it programming though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called programming.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re programming this computer in, you know,</p>
<p>in a remote location and it came back.</p>
<p>So it was truly cloud computing in a way.</p>
<p>So it was really terminal based computing.</p>
<p>And the input and the program are separate.</p>
<p>So the input to the program, or they could go together.</p>
<p>Like, or there&rsquo;s no input to the program.</p>
<p>It just runs and it gives you output.</p>
<p>Yeah, it goes in and it says ready,</p>
<p>and then you can say run, and then it would run.</p>
<p>But to program it, you didn&rsquo;t type it</p>
<p>because it was a printer terminal.</p>
<p>You would make the stack of cards</p>
<p>and that would get it into the computer&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>Okay, so where was the magic?</p>
<p>The magic was that you could create, you had a language</p>
<p>and you could create what you wanted to create, right?</p>
<p>You could create a world or what have you</p>
<p>and have this interaction.</p>
<p>And you could compute things, you could, you know,</p>
<p>do numbers, you could, I was playing Oregon Trail, right?</p>
<p>So you were less like.</p>
<p>So you can play video games.</p>
<p>Well, video.</p>
<p>Right, without the video.</p>
<p>You could play text games</p>
<p>and then imagine them in your brain, right?</p>
<p>Oregon Trail, there&rsquo;s this meme I saw recently.</p>
<p>If you wanna feel bad about yourself as a programmer,</p>
<p>realize that one person wrote Railroad Tycoon.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the name of the game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this cool little builder game.</p>
<p>One person wrote it in assembly.</p>
<p>So like from scratch and for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it kind of looks like a Sim City type game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a city builder, but obviously centered on railroads.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a nice graphics, it&rsquo;s three dimensional,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>All the things, all the rich colorful things</p>
<p>you would imagine for a three dimensional video game,</p>
<p>all written in assembly,</p>
<p>meaning the lowest level code next to binary,</p>
<p>which is fascinating.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the, you had to notice the magic</p>
<p>at that low level at that time.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have all the graphics.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have all the like APIs and all the sample codes,</p>
<p>no stack overflow, no internet, none of that.</p>
<p>You just had, you had to know registers.</p>
<p>You know, had to know the op codes</p>
<p>and you had to imagine the world in your brain</p>
<p>and the memory structures and everything else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no visualization.</p>
<p>You visualized it all yourself, right?</p>
<p>And so that was magic.</p>
<p>But then the next part of the magic</p>
<p>of where I got hooked even further</p>
<p>was like I&rsquo;m doing these little things.</p>
<p>And then Electronic Arts came out for the Apple II.</p>
<p>So I got an Apple II and Electronic Arts came out</p>
<p>and I was programming and doing basic</p>
<p>and making my own games.</p>
<p>But then there were two games that really blew my mind.</p>
<p>One was pinball construction set.</p>
<p>And the other one was music construction set.</p>
<p>And these were both places where I could create pinball games</p>
<p>and I could create musical scores</p>
<p>because I love music and I could then play them, right?</p>
<p>And so when you had that, you were like,</p>
<p>oh, this is something very different.</p>
<p>So I could create myself,</p>
<p>but then there was others that create tools</p>
<p>so you could create at a visual level.</p>
<p>And then you would read the backstories</p>
<p>because Electronics Arts back in the day,</p>
<p>it was one programmer who would program those games</p>
<p>program those things, each of those things.</p>
<p>And you could read their backstories.</p>
<p>It was literally like a musician or someone else.</p>
<p>Like you could read Rick Rubens, like here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>They tell you all of that stuff.</p>
<p>And there was one guy who wrote music construction set.</p>
<p>He wrote it all in assembly and he was 16 years old.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And I was probably 12 or 13 at the time.</p>
<p>And I went, oh my, if he was able to do this</p>
<p>and had published, right, and this amazing tool was created,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what could I do?</p>
<p>And so then it just kept building off of that.</p>
<p>But really it was those seminal things.</p>
<p>First, the introduction and then the power</p>
<p>through programming and turning these things</p>
<p>into what you wanted to turn it into.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t have to be 40, 50 years old</p>
<p>and have PhDs.</p>
<p>And then I was like, okay, this is really cool.</p>
<p>I wish we did that with programmers</p>
<p>where we treated them like artists.</p>
<p>We would know the backstory these days today.</p>
<p>Or not just programmers, engineers.</p>
<p>Engineers, designers.</p>
<p>Yeah, like all the things about a product</p>
<p>that I think we love are the little details.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably a human being</p>
<p>behind each of those details</p>
<p>that had their little inkling of genius that they put in.</p>
<p>I wish we knew those stories.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always sad to me when I,</p>
<p>because obviously I love engineering</p>
<p>and I interact with companies</p>
<p>and they, you know, autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;m really interested about.</p>
<p>And I see that companies generally,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll probably talk about this,</p>
<p>but they seem to want to hide their engineers.</p>
<p>Like engineers hold the secrets.</p>
<p>Like the great secret,</p>
<p>we did not speak of the great secret.</p>
<p>But then the result of that is you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>to hear their stories.</p>
<p>The passion that is there behind the engineers.</p>
<p>Like, and also the genius, the little,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference between the stuff that&rsquo;s patented,</p>
<p>like the kernel of the idea</p>
<p>and the beautiful sort of side effects of the idea.</p>
<p>And I wish companies revealed the beautiful side effects</p>
<p>a little bit more, but sorry for the distraction.</p>
<p>So what, you mentioned Apple II.</p>
<p>What was the first computer you fell in love with?</p>
<p>Like the product, the thing before you</p>
<p>that was a personal computer?</p>
<p>It was the Apple II.</p>
<p>So the Apple II was something I was just lusting over.</p>
<p>You know, it was, I think it was at the time,</p>
<p>it was the, you know, the person of the year.</p>
<p>Maybe it was that year.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what, but.</p>
<p>Well, Apple II was the person of the year?</p>
<p>Yeah, for my magazine back in, I don&rsquo;t remember when,</p>
<p>but it was around that same time.</p>
<p>I was so young, but I had, there was the Apple II</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know what it was, but I knew about tools</p>
<p>because my grandfather taught me about tools</p>
<p>and creating things, right?</p>
<p>And I saw this thing and I had the, you know,</p>
<p>that IBM experience, that terminal experience.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, I could have that at home, right?</p>
<p>And so I need to have that at home.</p>
<p>And the only thing that was really talked about</p>
<p>in our circles was the Apple II.</p>
<p>And I was just like, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So I went, jumped up and down.</p>
<p>It was very expensive.</p>
<p>I have to have this.</p>
<p>My parents were like, what?</p>
<p>You know, it was $2,500 back then in the 1981.</p>
<p>It was like crazy, right?</p>
<p>So I was like, I&rsquo;m gonna make as much money</p>
<p>as I can this summer.</p>
<p>And my grandfather said,</p>
<p>cause he helped me learn all about tools</p>
<p>and build things together.</p>
<p>I will match whatever you make</p>
<p>so you can get this computer.</p>
<p>So I worked very, very hard as a caddy, golf caddy.</p>
<p>Caddying actually for the, you know,</p>
<p>the families in, you know, at the country clubs</p>
<p>in the town where we lived.</p>
<p>And did whatever I could.</p>
<p>And that end of that summer, we got my Apple II.</p>
<p>And you couldn&rsquo;t tear it away from me.</p>
<p>It was my friend.</p>
<p>It was everything.</p>
<p>From a product perspective,</p>
<p>what do you remember that was brilliant?</p>
<p>The design choices, the ideas behind it,</p>
<p>or is it just that it exists?</p>
<p>Or the very idea of a personal computer</p>
<p>is the brilliant design choice.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was that I could actually have this kind of tool</p>
<p>in my house and I could use it anytime I wanted.</p>
<p>I could program it anyways.</p>
<p>There was no, you know, there was no internet connection.</p>
<p>There was no, it was all just you.</p>
<p>You either loaded software that you got from someone, right?</p>
<p>Or you created it yourself.</p>
<p>And then there was the whole other thing</p>
<p>which was started happening, which we were doing.</p>
<p>And this was kind of like MP3 and stuff.</p>
<p>We were sharing software, right?</p>
<p>So you built this community of sharing software.</p>
<p>You would go and pirate.</p>
<p>That was what it called, pirate all this software.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d never use it all, but it was just that fun thing</p>
<p>of like, I&rsquo;m gonna get all this other stuff</p>
<p>and then tear it apart and do disassembly on it</p>
<p>and see behind the scenes.</p>
<p>So you really had a sense this was your world</p>
<p>and you owned it, right?</p>
<p>And you could like literally go into every register.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have all those security layers.</p>
<p>Like we do not like,</p>
<p>you could really touch bits and you could poke bits</p>
<p>and you can make this light turn on.</p>
<p>And the geek assignment just lit up.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s so abstract.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t even understand.</p>
<p>Like usually some programs don&rsquo;t even understand memory.</p>
<p>They just think it&rsquo;s unlimited, right?</p>
<p>And security, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s all this security you should have,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like the adults all showed up to the party</p>
<p>and now you can&rsquo;t have all the fun, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, no.</p>
<p>This was the thing where if you, if the power went out,</p>
<p>you lost your whole program,</p>
<p>you might&rsquo;ve worked a whole day on it.</p>
<p>And if you didn&rsquo;t press save at every other line</p>
<p>and you were to save, save, save,</p>
<p>and it would like, the disk drive or the tape drive.</p>
<p>Like every single step was contemplated</p>
<p>because if you didn&rsquo;t, you lost maybe a ton of work.</p>
<p>So a lot of the magic was in the software.</p>
<p>The fact that you could have software,</p>
<p>the fact that you could share software,</p>
<p>the community around the software,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the hardware.</p>
<p>Well, that was the first step.</p>
<p>The second step around the hardware</p>
<p>was I got things like the mocking board,</p>
<p>which the mocking board</p>
<p>paired with the music construction set,</p>
<p>you could now generate all kinds of tones and notes</p>
<p>and it was a synthesizer in the Apple II.</p>
<p>So you would plug in this card and you go,</p>
<p>oh my God, look at this.</p>
<p>And it would, you know,</p>
<p>you could start generating cool sounds.</p>
<p>You know, like it was a Moog, you know,</p>
<p>like a Moog in a way, early Moog.</p>
<p>What year are we talking about?</p>
<p>This is 82, I think, 81, 82.</p>
<p>And I bet you can make all the kind of synthetic sounds</p>
<p>that are very cool in the 80s.</p>
<p>Yeah, the 8 bit, you know, chip tunes, right?</p>
<p>Chip tune, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</p>
<p>And then, you know, when you wanted to add a joystick,</p>
<p>you had to pull a chip out</p>
<p>and you had to like plug in a dip socket</p>
<p>to put in a joystick.</p>
<p>And then I was like, oh,</p>
<p>and then I had to get more memory.</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>And now I wanted to speed up progress.</p>
<p>So then that turned into a company actually from that,</p>
<p>but it was, and a hardware software went at that.</p>
<p>But it was all about, you know,</p>
<p>modifying this thing in every way, first with software.</p>
<p>And then you started gaining confidence.</p>
<p>And then I got a little bit more money and stuff.</p>
<p>And then you could get into the hardware</p>
<p>and, you know, wire things.</p>
<p>And then the Apple II came with all the schematics, right?</p>
<p>So in the back, in the early Apple IIs,</p>
<p>you could open up and all the schematics were there.</p>
<p>So you purchased the Apple II and the schematics come with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it came with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting choice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting choice from a company perspective.</p>
<p>Right, it was like a real maker kind of thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Ah, I wonder what they, so that was intentional.</p>
<p>Like this is. Absolutely intentional.</p>
<p>This is for the cutting edge folks too,</p>
<p>or especially for the cutting edge.</p>
<p>It was only the cutting edge.</p>
<p>It was geeks for geeks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we were like, oh, how did they make it?</p>
<p>And then we got to learn through that.</p>
<p>Apple I did the same thing, right?</p>
<p>It just Apple II became more packaged up</p>
<p>and had, you know, a little bit better software, right?</p>
<p>Came with basic and then, you know,</p>
<p>so it was really, it was what we might think of</p>
<p>as a raspberry pie today or something like that,</p>
<p>but not with so much software.</p>
<p>It was literally, and all the chips were out there</p>
<p>so you could inspect the buses and the, right?</p>
<p>Cause everything was just broken out.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s the idea behind stable big projects</p>
<p>and open source, like on GitHub,</p>
<p>that you have the schematics there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of a product,</p>
<p>but I wonder why more companies don&rsquo;t do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re going to release this to a small set of people,</p>
<p>self selected, perhaps that are kind of the makers,</p>
<p>the cutting edge folks, the builders,</p>
<p>the at home engineers, like in some way,</p>
<p>what Tesla is doing with the beta for the full self driving</p>
<p>is kind of like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like selecting a group of people,</p>
<p>but that has to do more with you,</p>
<p>how safe of a driver you are</p>
<p>versus how much of a tinkerer you are</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t get to tinker.</p>
<p>I wonder, is that a crazy idea to do</p>
<p>for really cutting edge technologies,</p>
<p>especially you&rsquo;re interested in like hardware stuff.</p>
<p>Is that crazy?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t more companies do that kind of thing, you think?</p>
<p>I think back then it was about a community</p>
<p>and serving that community of builders.</p>
<p>Now this is about people who want to take,</p>
<p>get the experience and want it really simple and easy.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, and so there&rsquo;s the audience</p>
<p>or they believe the audience is small</p>
<p>who would value those other things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just talking about.</p>
<p>But if we look at things like Raspberry Pi</p>
<p>and all of these other little boards, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole world more than I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s amazing what you can do now</p>
<p>with these little kits and the software that&rsquo;s created.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a whole nother,</p>
<p>I think another batch of makers and builders</p>
<p>that are coming up through the ranks.</p>
<p>And if you, we look at YouTube channels and stuff, right?</p>
<p>They take these little boards, they hack them,</p>
<p>then they print out parts on their 3D printer,</p>
<p>assemble them and they create robots and what have you.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not as, you know, as,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not as, I guess, raw as it used to be,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s there and it&rsquo;s really expanding around the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really nice to see</p>
<p>cause you know, it&rsquo;s a whole new generation</p>
<p>who can, who are empowered.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a semi dormant genius amongst millions.</p>
<p>So like Raspberry Pi is revealing that a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s several million Raspberry Pis</p>
<p>that have been sold.</p>
<p>I think more than that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of this quiet storm of genius,</p>
<p>brewing of engineers who don&rsquo;t get to hear</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not organized.</p>
<p>I mean, we get to hear their inklings here and there.</p>
<p>Like I said, YouTube, there&rsquo;s little communities</p>
<p>that are local and so on.</p>
<p>But if they were organized,</p>
<p>if a leader would emerge, no.</p>
<p>Okay, so when did you first start to dream</p>
<p>about building your own things,</p>
<p>designing your own products,</p>
<p>designing your own systems and software and hardware?</p>
<p>Well, in high school, there was a company</p>
<p>that a friend of mine founded</p>
<p>and I was the second employee,</p>
<p>it was called Quality Computers.</p>
<p>And it was a mail order,</p>
<p>mail order cause there&rsquo;s no eCommerce then,</p>
<p>there was no internet again.</p>
<p>You either mailed in your little coupon</p>
<p>and you said, this is what I wanted to order</p>
<p>or you wrote in to get a catalog and delivered to you.</p>
<p>Turn around time and this stuff was like,</p>
<p>from the time you wanted, the time you bought it</p>
<p>was maybe eight to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>That was just the normal way of getting things.</p>
<p>So Quality Computers was a mail order for Apple too</p>
<p>and it was software and all kinds of accessories.</p>
<p>So hardware accessories, so hardware,</p>
<p>plug in cards, joysticks, all this stuff.</p>
<p>And what we noticed was there were accelerators</p>
<p>or memory cards.</p>
<p>And to be able to use those cards,</p>
<p>you had to actually go and change the software you use</p>
<p>to access this new memory.</p>
<p>So you literally had to go and you took the program</p>
<p>that you had, let&rsquo;s say it was Apple works,</p>
<p>which was like an early Microsoft office</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And you had to literally change the code</p>
<p>and you would install all these patches</p>
<p>to then take advantage of the hardware.</p>
<p>So what we started creating was software on top of it</p>
<p>to do the automatic installation of all of these patches.</p>
<p>So we made it much easier to take new hardware</p>
<p>and the existing software you have</p>
<p>and expand it into this new world.</p>
<p>So it was creating tools</p>
<p>and the really great customer support.</p>
<p>And we started getting a lot of orders</p>
<p>because we had the software make it easier to install,</p>
<p>to give them the superpower.</p>
<p>And at the same time, they would be able</p>
<p>to change their software and have a new world</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t existing from the companies</p>
<p>that were creating the initial products.</p>
<p>And so it was more of that.</p>
<p>And then that happened with hard drives.</p>
<p>So I wrote a hard drive optimizer for the Apple II</p>
<p>to like read, because you could get really fragmented.</p>
<p>So I wrote that piece of software</p>
<p>and we sold that through the company</p>
<p>along with the hard drives that we sold from third parties.</p>
<p>So that all happened in 12th grade,</p>
<p>freshman year of college.</p>
<p>You wrote a hard drive optimizer in 12th grade</p>
<p>for the Apple II.</p>
<p>Between 12th and freshman year.</p>
<p>What programming language do you remember?</p>
<p>Is it assemblies?</p>
<p>There were certain inner loops were assembly</p>
<p>and other loops actually there were really early Pascal,</p>
<p>no C compilers.</p>
<p>What was the motivation behind these?</p>
<p>Is it to make people&rsquo;s lives easier?</p>
<p>Is it to create a thing experience</p>
<p>that is simpler and simpler and simpler,</p>
<p>thereby more accessible to a larger number of people?</p>
<p>Or did you just like to tinker?</p>
<p>No, no, no, it was two things really.</p>
<p>Cause one, we wanted to sell more hardware and software.</p>
<p>So it was like, oh, make it easier for the user.</p>
<p>And then the other thing was,</p>
<p>because I was also manning the customer support line,</p>
<p>people would call in and go, this doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, I gotta go fix the hardware and software.</p>
<p>Or I gotta fix the software to make the hardware</p>
<p>and the installation process better.</p>
<p>So my whole world was out of box experience</p>
<p>from when I was in high school.</p>
<p>Cause I had to man the customer support line,</p>
<p>pack the boxes and write some of the code</p>
<p>while we were doing, while Joe, Joe Gleason,</p>
<p>who was the founder of Quality Computers,</p>
<p>he was off doing the mark, the ads,</p>
<p>placing the ads for the mail order,</p>
<p>making sure we were running the credit cards, right?</p>
<p>It was two of us.</p>
<p>And then it turned into a third,</p>
<p>and then we hired another person from high school</p>
<p>to like pack boxes so I could stay</p>
<p>on the customer support line or doing the software, right?</p>
<p>And it was all in his parents basement, right?</p>
<p>As you were scaling exponentially.</p>
<p>Scaling, right, exactly, bootstrapping.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll jump around a little bit,</p>
<p>but what were the, you said you love music.</p>
<p>What were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod</p>
<p>if we jump forward and how far back do those ideas stretch?</p>
<p>If you look at the history of technology,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, I mean, not just the product,</p>
<p>but the idea is truly revolutionary.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s time has come,</p>
<p>but just if you look at the arc of history,</p>
<p>sort of music is so fundamental to who we are as a humanity.</p>
<p>And to be able to put that in your pocket,</p>
<p>make it truly portable is fascinating</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s truly portable.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s digital as opposed to sort of like a Walkman</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So what were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod?</p>
<p>You know, I was in love with music since I was a kid.</p>
<p>Just loved music from, I think, second grade</p>
<p>when I got my first albums and stuff like that.</p>
<p>What kind of music are we talking about?</p>
<p>So this was Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>This was the Stones, Hendrix, Aerosmith,</p>
<p>Cheap Trick, Stix, Ted Nugent,</p>
<p>just the real American and British rock and roll, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of people listening right now.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Led Zeppelin?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Is that some kind?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>It drove my parents crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You just blasted loud.</p>
<p>Loud, just brr.</p>
<p>And this was second, third grade, fourth grade.</p>
<p>I just fell in love.</p>
<p>And then we moved back to Detroit</p>
<p>and I loved listening to the radio station</p>
<p>because there was all kinds of crazy music</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d have an amalgam of rock and then funk</p>
<p>and R&amp;B and I loved to listen at night.</p>
<p>So I had a clock radio.</p>
<p>But if I had the clock radio on,</p>
<p>everyone, parents would go, go to sleep.</p>
<p>Stop that.</p>
<p>Turn that stuff off.</p>
<p>So I hacked the clock radio and put a headphone jack in it.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So I said, oh, they&rsquo;re like, okay.</p>
<p>And then I could listen to it all night</p>
<p>and no one could hear me, right?</p>
<p>And I could just sit there and, you know.</p>
<p>Just huddling around the radio.</p>
<p>Groove out.</p>
<p>Just listening to Zeppelin.</p>
<p>Stairway to Heaven, what would you say</p>
<p>is the greatest classic rock song of all time?</p>
<p>Greatest classic rock song of all time?</p>
<p>What pops into mind?</p>
<p>Well, no, you know what?</p>
<p>I mean, this has to be objectively number one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really hard, dude.</p>
<p>This is so hard.</p>
<p>No, you have to.</p>
<p>This is a serious journalistic interview.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to back down from these kinds of questions.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What a challenge.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard to pick.</p>
<p>But to me, Stairway to Heaven is a safe fall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s so often considered</p>
<p>to be one of the greatest songs of all time</p>
<p>that you almost don&rsquo;t want to pick it.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve returned to it time and time again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, this is something pretty special.</p>
<p>This is a rock opera of sorts.</p>
<p>Well, the rock opera that really blew me away</p>
<p>and still continues to blow me away</p>
<p>is all of Dark Side of the Moon.</p>
<p>Like that, I love Zeppelin.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say which one&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>But Dark Side of the Moon for me was,</p>
<p>it was a, you know, audio experience, right?</p>
<p>The whole thing from soup to nuts,</p>
<p>plus all the synthesizers, all of those things.</p>
<p>Okay, so back to the iPod.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, from the early age, you loved music.</p>
<p>Loved it.</p>
<p>Absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>And, you know, always was just around it</p>
<p>and always, I just, it was always playing, you know.</p>
<p>I played it so loud that I actually hurt the earring</p>
<p>in my right ear.</p>
<p>And I still suffer from that today.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>No regrets.</p>
<p>No regrets whatsoever.</p>
<p>Going to concerts in downtown Detroit</p>
<p>and all the crazy stuff.</p>
<p>So moving forward.</p>
<p>So in college, I was a DJ.</p>
<p>So I would DJ and hang out and play all the tunes I love</p>
<p>and whatever for the crowd.</p>
<p>And then I continued to do that in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>when I moved right after school.</p>
<p>And so I was be lugging all of these CDs around with me.</p>
<p>A thousand CDs to, right?</p>
<p>And at the same time, and so those were heavy.</p>
<p>And at the same time I was doing the Philips Nino and Velo.</p>
<p>Those were Windows CE based mobile computing products.</p>
<p>Nino was the first device</p>
<p>to actually put Audible books on tape.</p>
<p>So I worked with Audible.</p>
<p>We met in a conference and they were like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to do hardware.</p>
<p>We just want to do content.</p>
<p>I was like, well, we have this device.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get it together.</p>
<p>And we got Audible on that.</p>
<p>And this was in 96 or seven, first Audible books.</p>
<p>And it, you know, I was like, oh my God, that&rsquo;s audio.</p>
<p>Well, what if we put music on it, right?</p>
<p>And so I, and the memory was very small at the time, right?</p>
<p>There was almost no flash.</p>
<p>It was all DRAM.</p>
<p>When you did Audible, you stored it in DRAM, right?</p>
<p>Which was okay probably</p>
<p>because how much books do you need is the idea.</p>
<p>By the way, brilliant, I mean, just putting books.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s probably not the sexiest of things,</p>
<p>but putting books on a mobile device is a brilliant step.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sometimes can&rsquo;t measure how much human progress occurred</p>
<p>because of an invention.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s the sexy big products, but you never know.</p>
<p>Like, like Wikipedia is one of those things</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t get enough, I think, credit</p>
<p>for the transformational effects it has.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not seen as the sexiest of products, but maybe it is.</p>
<p>When you look at human history, Wikipedia arguably</p>
<p>is one of the big things</p>
<p>that basically unlocked human knowledge.</p>
<p>Human knowledge and human editing and human, you know,</p>
<p>just the human nature of building something together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can&rsquo;t measure those things,</p>
<p>maybe until many, many decades later.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry.</p>
<p>So that was, that was, you know, that was, so that was there.</p>
<p>And then there was Audible,</p>
<p>that you put books, why not put music?</p>
<p>Music, and I&rsquo;m carrying around the music for the DJ gigs.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, wait a second, two and two together, right?</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s get rid of this.</p>
<p>And so, and then MP3 show up.</p>
<p>The actual, like in COVID?</p>
<p>The format, the format, MP3 showed up around 97, 98.</p>
<p>So MP3 is compressed so you can have,</p>
<p>like the storage is reduced significantly.</p>
<p>Right, so you could go from a, you know,</p>
<p>a large full lossless, you know,</p>
<p>digital track into something that can be stored</p>
<p>in four to eight megabytes,</p>
<p>something like that for the audio.</p>
<p>Now, you know, that&rsquo;s a reduced quality,</p>
<p>but you could get it down there and you&rsquo;re like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>And now if we have enough flash or DRAM,</p>
<p>we can put 10, 15, what have you all in that same memory.</p>
<p>And it starts to replicate a CD.</p>
<p>And then ultimately, if you put it on a hard drive,</p>
<p>you could start to put, you know, thousands of songs.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s also another brilliant invention.</p>
<p>But like, people don&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>I think people would be surprised how big</p>
<p>in terms of storage raw audio is.</p>
<p>And the fact that you can compress it,</p>
<p>like, I don&rsquo;t know what the compression is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like 10X, it&rsquo;s very significant compression.</p>
<p>And still it sounds almost lossless.</p>
<p>Much to the chagrin of Neil Young,</p>
<p>who does not like that.</p>
<p>But even Neil Young, even the stuff he talks about</p>
<p>is still tiny files relative to the raw.</p>
<p>So he wants us to increase it just a little bit more,</p>
<p>a little bit more.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still, that&rsquo;s an invention.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a thing that unlocks your ability</p>
<p>to carry around a device like a Nino and listen to music.</p>
<p>Because without that, there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>you can carry on a gigantic hard drive.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And so then that, so it was MP3s, the Nino,</p>
<p>and my, you know, my hatred of carrying around</p>
<p>all this heavy stuff that then spawned, you know,</p>
<p>fuse and then ultimately, you know,</p>
<p>became a lot of that, the ideas and things of that nature</p>
<p>were, and my passions were born into then the iPod.</p>
<p>You know, it was too, Apple needed something</p>
<p>and I wanted to fix something and it all kind of,</p>
<p>you know, came together at the right place, right time,</p>
<p>plus the right technology came at this.</p>
<p>It was just like the stars aligned.</p>
<p>So how did it come to life?</p>
<p>The details of the stars aligning, but the actual design,</p>
<p>the actual engineering of getting a device to be small,</p>
<p>the storage of the, you know, the interface, how it looks,</p>
<p>the storage, the details of the software,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What are some interesting memories from that design process?</p>
<p>What are some wisdoms you can impart from that process?</p>
<p>Okay, well, you know, how long do you want to go?</p>
<p>Cause I have, I can go deep.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s go at least 20 hours.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, this is one of the lengthy documentaries.</p>
<p>Are you going to turn it into episodic binge listening?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just start with, you know,</p>
<p>after I was asked to be a consultant</p>
<p>to put this thing together.</p>
<p>So I already had knowledge of, you know,</p>
<p>the space and the technology and all that stuff,</p>
<p>but I had to very quickly, and a lot of the suppliers,</p>
<p>because of what I was doing at Fuse,</p>
<p>trying to create that thing.</p>
<p>So as a contractor, I was like, okay,</p>
<p>what is the first thing they need to do?</p>
<p>So after I showed a, you know, different architectures</p>
<p>and what three different products could be to Steve</p>
<p>about options for storage options, battery options,</p>
<p>form factor options, there was three options.</p>
<p>And as I was told, given very good advice,</p>
<p>give the two options you really do not like,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re options, and give the best option last,</p>
<p>because Steve will shoot all those down</p>
<p>and give the best option last,</p>
<p>and then you could talk about that.</p>
<p>And so that was the one that had a 1.8 inch hard drive</p>
<p>and a small screen, like the screen, you know it,</p>
<p>and the original iPod, classic iPod.</p>
<p>And then I had enough of the idea of the three</p>
<p>or three or four different CPUs and processor suppliers</p>
<p>and kind of systems that were out there</p>
<p>that I had gone and found and put together on power supplies,</p>
<p>you know, disk drive interfaces,</p>
<p>firewire interface, all that stuff.</p>
<p>So I put together all of those schematics</p>
<p>or, you know, block diagrams.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t schematics yet, because it was just me.</p>
<p>And coming up with a bill of materials,</p>
<p>coming up with what it could look like,</p>
<p>what would be the input, output,</p>
<p>how we could make a better headphone jack.</p>
<p>That was also on there.</p>
<p>Screen suppliers, tearing apart calculators.</p>
<p>So got all calculators and all kinds of electronics</p>
<p>to get the right size, different sizes of small LCDs.</p>
<p>So I got all kinds of different battery types.</p>
<p>I got different types of, you know,</p>
<p>in different battery sizes, double A&rsquo;s, triple A&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>working through all the different,</p>
<p>and there was lithium ion, nickel metal hydride.</p>
<p>So I took all the battery types.</p>
<p>I took all of the memory types, processing types,</p>
<p>LCD types, and connectivity and all that stuff,</p>
<p>not wireless, but wired,</p>
<p>and laid out these things as Lego blocks.</p>
<p>So literally had all of these things as just,</p>
<p>and so it made them so I could like, you know,</p>
<p>put them together and figure out</p>
<p>what the compact form factor would be.</p>
<p>Oh, like how do we shove them together?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the smallest possible box you can get?</p>
<p>So the questions was on storage, so the hard drive,</p>
<p>batteries, double A, triple A, screens.</p>
<p>So screen size, and then for that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re tearing apart calculators.</p>
<p>Calculators, digital cameras, whatever,</p>
<p>and getting little things, right?</p>
<p>So you can make it physical, right?</p>
<p>If you can make the intangible tangible,</p>
<p>like, and so I can say, look, we can make this,</p>
<p>and I brought this whole bag of goods,</p>
<p>and it was like, right?</p>
<p>And like, here&rsquo;s this, here&rsquo;s this,</p>
<p>this is why double A&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>and because it makes it too fat and everything.</p>
<p>So just educate everybody through,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the parts that we can use.</p>
<p>You should not sheet of paper, it&rsquo;s physical.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re playing in the physical space.</p>
<p>Oh, I would go back and forth.</p>
<p>So truth be told,</p>
<p>because there weren&rsquo;t a good enough graphical tools</p>
<p>on the Mac, I was using a PC with Visio and some 3D tools,</p>
<p>and I was doing 3D design at the same time</p>
<p>I was taking all these physical parts and going,</p>
<p>okay, what feels right?</p>
<p>Because you have to go from, you know,</p>
<p>the details and then the rough,</p>
<p>and you go back and forth and you iterate, right?</p>
<p>And so it was just a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And then it ultimately ended up with a styrofoam model</p>
<p>and printouts that came from Visio</p>
<p>that I glued together and put my grandfather&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fishing weights in,</p>
<p>because I also modeled the weights, right?</p>
<p>So I said, oh, this is this many ounces,</p>
<p>this is this many ounces and grams.</p>
<p>And then I went and got all that</p>
<p>and made the, weighted these styrofoam models</p>
<p>to then match that.</p>
<p>So when you picked it up,</p>
<p>it felt more or less form factor, right?</p>
<p>And it also, you felt how much, you know,</p>
<p>was it gonna be dense enough?</p>
<p>Is it gonna feel solid and rigid in your hand, right?</p>
<p>Why does it need to feel rigid?</p>
<p>Because it has to feel substantial.</p>
<p>It has to feel like I have like a,</p>
<p>like a bar of gold in my hand, right?</p>
<p>You know, maybe you know this,</p>
<p>when you open and close a car door,</p>
<p>you know that thunk and you go, bam,</p>
<p>and you go, that feels solid, that feels real.</p>
<p>And then you get this tinny car that&rsquo;s like ding,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, does this feel safe?</p>
<p>Does this feel like a value?</p>
<p>And so you, when you have a device like that,</p>
<p>and you wanna make sure that there&rsquo;s not too much air in it,</p>
<p>that you distributed the density of the masses</p>
<p>in the right way.</p>
<p>So it feels like it&rsquo;s the right thing.</p>
<p>So you have to model battery life, costs,</p>
<p>you know, mass, sizes of different things.</p>
<p>And then you have to also think about</p>
<p>what the UI is gonna look like, right?</p>
<p>You have all of these constraints you&rsquo;re working,</p>
<p>variables you&rsquo;re working with,</p>
<p>and you have to kind of, you know,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get the perfect of everything.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best, you know, local maximum</p>
<p>of all of these components that come together</p>
<p>to provide an experience?</p>
<p>Local maximum, it&rsquo;s always trade offs.</p>
<p>What about buttons?</p>
<p>Buttons, well, there was also the buttons too, right?</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, a lot of these battles</p>
<p>fought inside your mind, or is it with other people?</p>
<p>Is it with Steve, is it lower, like what?</p>
<p>This was all independent.</p>
<p>This was me before being able to present to Steve,</p>
<p>because I had to feel really confident</p>
<p>that if I was gonna put this in front of him,</p>
<p>that it could be made, right?</p>
<p>So I had to convince myself</p>
<p>and go work through all the details,</p>
<p>through like the very, very rough mechanical design,</p>
<p>electrical design, software things,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t wanna present something</p>
<p>that was gonna be fictional, right?</p>
<p>My credibility would be like trashed, right?</p>
<p>So you mentioned convince yourself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re painting this beautiful picture</p>
<p>of a driven engineer, designer, futurist.</p>
<p>How much doubt were you plagued by through that?</p>
<p>Like this is even doable,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not obvious that this is even doable.</p>
<p>Like to do this at scale, to do this kind of thing,</p>
<p>to make it sexy, to shovel the screen,</p>
<p>the batteries, the storage, to make the interface,</p>
<p>the hardware and the software interface work, all of that.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would be overwhelmed by the doubt of that,</p>
<p>because so many things have to work, plus the supply chain.</p>
<p>Like at that point,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t getting into any of those details or anything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the basic stuff that you have to put together.</p>
<p>And then you have to,</p>
<p>through my learnings at General Magic</p>
<p>and my learnings at Phillips</p>
<p>and delivering multiple large scale programs</p>
<p>and manufacturing, you kind of get a rule of thumb</p>
<p>and you know what to focus on at the beginning</p>
<p>and what not to worry about over time.</p>
<p>Like when I was early in my career,</p>
<p>I worried about everything on the engineering details</p>
<p>so much so that I would be a nervous wreck.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, you learn how to filter out</p>
<p>and figure out what to prioritize.</p>
<p>And so 10 years later,</p>
<p>I was able to do a much better job</p>
<p>of filtering out the things of like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get to that in weeks to come.</p>
<p>But right now we gotta solve the very important things,</p>
<p>which is could this actually be something real</p>
<p>and that you could deliver enough battery life, right?</p>
<p>Enough of an interface of the right cost, right?</p>
<p>And the right price point.</p>
<p>So you were sitting on a track record</p>
<p>of successes and failures in your own mind</p>
<p>where you had sort of already a confidence,</p>
<p>a calmness, but still,</p>
<p>was there a doubt that you can get this done?</p>
<p>Always, always.</p>
<p>How hard is it to achieve a sort of a confidence</p>
<p>to a level where you could present it to Steve</p>
<p>and actually believe that this is doable?</p>
<p>Like what, do you remember when you felt?</p>
<p>Yeah, that moment?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think it was after I triple checked my,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t bring anyone in, right?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t let anyone in on this.</p>
<p>So it was just me.</p>
<p>Are they gonna trample on it, that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Why? No, no, no, no,</p>
<p>because I couldn&rsquo;t bring any,</p>
<p>when I mean bring anyone in on this,</p>
<p>one, it was a highly confidential program inside Apple.</p>
<p>There was like four people who knew about it, right?</p>
<p>And so I couldn&rsquo;t bring anyone from Apple</p>
<p>because I was a contractor.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t bring anyone else from the outside world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working for Apple and I&rsquo;m under this crazy NDA, right?</p>
<p>In this contract.</p>
<p>So it was just, so I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>Oh, and at the same time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also buying every competitive product, MP3 player</p>
<p>and tearing them all apart, right?</p>
<p>Tore them all apart and looking at them</p>
<p>and trying to learn from those as well.</p>
<p>So it was all of this stuff in six weeks.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t sleep, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I was like, because I was trying to make this,</p>
<p>I was envisioning this since the Nino, right?</p>
<p>And I was like, oh my God, right?</p>
<p>But there was another doubt that I had</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t just, could you make the product?</p>
<p>But could Apple actually have the balls to make it?</p>
<p>Because Apple was not the same company</p>
<p>that you know it today in 2001.</p>
<p>Really, it was cautious, conservative, careful?</p>
<p>No, no, it was barely break even.</p>
<p>It was a four or $5 billion company.</p>
<p>So the guts required there is not necessarily</p>
<p>in the innovation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is gonna cost a lot of money</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna potentially lose all of it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll be a flop.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s not just that, but there was only the Mac.</p>
<p>And the Mac wasn&rsquo;t doing very well.</p>
<p>There was less, it was about a 1%</p>
<p>only in the US market share for the Mac, right?</p>
<p>The company was in debt.</p>
<p>Bill Gates had to give him a loan, right?</p>
<p>Michael Dell at the time was saying,</p>
<p>shut down the company and give the money back</p>
<p>to the shareholders.</p>
<p>So this is not the company that people,</p>
<p>oh my God, the iPhone came out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very different level of confidence</p>
<p>and financial situation that the company was in</p>
<p>versus the iPod.</p>
<p>So given that, what was the conversation</p>
<p>when you finally presented to Steve?</p>
<p>Steve, what was that conversation like?</p>
<p>The conversation was, well, we went through it,</p>
<p>the presentation and all that stuff happened.</p>
<p>And he was just like, and he never,</p>
<p>he would flip through it real quick,</p>
<p>throw the presentation aside and said,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s talk about this, right?</p>
<p>And so we went through it all.</p>
<p>And one was a big conversation about Sony.</p>
<p>And Sony was the number one in all audio categories,</p>
<p>home, portable, whatever, in the world, okay?</p>
<p>I had been already gone through 10 years of failure.</p>
<p>And I was like, wait a second,</p>
<p>how are we gonna compete with Sony?</p>
<p>And I was always worried that Sony</p>
<p>was gonna come out with whatever it was</p>
<p>that they were gonna come out with, their MP3 player.</p>
<p>And that was it, game over, right?</p>
<p>And so I was like, Steve,</p>
<p>Steve, and this is why it took me four weeks</p>
<p>to finally sign on to join Apple</p>
<p>after he green lighted the iPod program in that meeting,</p>
<p>was because I had built other things in the past</p>
<p>at Phillips, the Nino and Velo,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t know how to sell it or market it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know how to retail it, right?</p>
<p>So I was like, we could build this.</p>
<p>And I was like, Steve, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can build this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this before, but how are we gonna sell it?</p>
<p>You have all your marketing dollars on the Mac.</p>
<p>And he looked at me and he goes, you build this</p>
<p>with, you know, a team and our team and Apple</p>
<p>and this and this and the me, right?</p>
<p>And I dedicate that we will make sure</p>
<p>that at least two quarters of all marketing dollars</p>
<p>will only go to this product and nothing else.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Right, Mac was the lifeblood of all revenue of the company.</p>
<p>So Steve saw something special here.</p>
<p>Exactly, and he said, I&rsquo;m going to commit</p>
<p>all the marketing dollars if you can deliver</p>
<p>the experience that we&rsquo;re all talking about,</p>
<p>if we can do that, and that was Jeff Robin as well,</p>
<p>because iPod would have never happened without iTunes.</p>
<p>You know, people don&rsquo;t understand that was a bundle.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t do one without the other and vice versa.</p>
<p>So Jeff and I were, you know, if Jeff and you can present</p>
<p>and bring that experience to life,</p>
<p>I will put all the marketing dollars behind it.</p>
<p>When did the marriage of iPod and iTunes sort of,</p>
<p>what was that birth of ideas that made up iTunes?</p>
<p>iTunes existed before the iPod, okay?</p>
<p>And so Jeff Robin had his company,</p>
<p>oh man, I can&rsquo;t remember the name, but it was bought.</p>
<p>He was making a MP3 player app for the Mac.</p>
<p>Steve saw it because there was MP3 player apps</p>
<p>like Winamp and other things that were on the PC,</p>
<p>real player, and Steve saw that going on</p>
<p>and saw that Jeff and his small team had this,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember, sound something.</p>
<p>Anyways, he bought that and that became the basis of iTunes</p>
<p>and then Jeff ran all of iTunes.</p>
<p>And so what happened specifically there was</p>
<p>they were starting to hook up</p>
<p>to all these third party MP3 players</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of Korean, the MP man,</p>
<p>like Walkman, but MP man, all these,</p>
<p>and they were trying to hook them up</p>
<p>and they were like, these are horrible experiences.</p>
<p>And through that, and they said,</p>
<p>iTunes was something that was gonna help grow the Mac base</p>
<p>because we were trying to get more on the Mac.</p>
<p>So this program would be a great new thing</p>
<p>you could add to the Mac.</p>
<p>And there was also internet connectivity at the time</p>
<p>for the iMac.</p>
<p>And so they did that</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re trying to do these hookups.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t going well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when they said, we need to build our own.</p>
<p>Or Steve said, we need to build our own</p>
<p>since these are such horrible experiences.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t wanna just burn CDs from iTunes.</p>
<p>We need to get that music on the go,</p>
<p>but in an Apple fashion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I was called to come in to do that,</p>
<p>the iPod thing after the six weeks.</p>
<p>Then he already envisioned, I&rsquo;m sure he had it envisioned</p>
<p>because they were trying to do this thing.</p>
<p>Okay, now that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>iTunes, it wasn&rsquo;t called iPod yet.</p>
<p>What would become the iPod?</p>
<p>That is gonna be the thing that then propels Apple</p>
<p>into this new thing</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna bring all these music lovers in</p>
<p>that are gonna need their next generation</p>
<p>or Sony Walkman version 2.0.</p>
<p>So when you look at, again, apologies to linger on iPod,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of the great inventions in tech history.</p>
<p>What wisdom do you draw from that whole process</p>
<p>about spotting an idea?</p>
<p>This is something you talk about in your book, Build.</p>
<p>How do you know that an idea is brilliant?</p>
<p>At which stage?</p>
<p>When did you know it was a good idea?</p>
<p>And maybe is there like some phase shifts?</p>
<p>First you complete out, then maybe,</p>
<p>and then maybe it becomes more than a hmm</p>
<p>and becomes like a little more confidence,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And also wisdom about who to talk to</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t trample the idea in their early stages,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Any thoughts about this?</p>
<p>We could go on again.</p>
<p>How long do you wanna go?</p>
<p>20, this is a Netflix series, I told you.</p>
<p>Multi season.</p>
<p>So a lot of lessons learned over those years of failure</p>
<p>and success, but the first thing it starts with,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole chapter called Great Ideas Chase You.</p>
<p>And so it kind of goes into in Build</p>
<p>and it goes through kind of chapter and verse</p>
<p>about all of those, how Nest became into being.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about it specifically for iPod, right?</p>
<p>So for me, I always had pain,</p>
<p>the pain of carrying these CDs everywhere, right?</p>
<p>And I had the joy of music, right?</p>
<p>If you could say, all of a sudden I could get</p>
<p>the music I love all the time in a portable package</p>
<p>and I can have all the music I love all the time,</p>
<p>I was solving a pain, which was,</p>
<p>for me it was thousands of CDs,</p>
<p>other people might be 10 or 15 CDs, right?</p>
<p>And then I can have the joy of all this music uninterrupted.</p>
<p>That was taking the pain, making a painkiller for it.</p>
<p>And then at the end was a superpower,</p>
<p>an emotional superpower that said,</p>
<p>oh my, this is something different.</p>
<p>So when you can actually focus on a pain,</p>
<p>not and get a painkiller for it, not a vitamin.</p>
<p>So the difference between a painkiller</p>
<p>and a vitamin is very clear.</p>
<p>One, you need, I gotta get rid of this pain.</p>
<p>A vitamin, maybe it works, maybe it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>maybe somebody needs it, maybe not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all marketing story, right?</p>
<p>So you start with the pain, give them a painkiller,</p>
<p>and hopefully if you can do it in the right way,</p>
<p>you give them a superpower, an emotional superpower.</p>
<p>That is always, and that&rsquo;s the way to know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re hitting on something that&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>The pain and the joy, are you always aware of the pain?</p>
<p>So it seems like a lot of great products,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we do a lot of painful things</p>
<p>and we just kind of assume that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to be, like with autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll all assume we&rsquo;re supposed to be driving.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t think of it as a pain.</p>
<p>Right, well, you&rsquo;ve habituated it away.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve habituated it away.</p>
<p>For me, when I go to other places,</p>
<p>living in Bali or living in Paris or whatever,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not driving, I&rsquo;m walking or I&rsquo;m using a scooter</p>
<p>or what have you, different thing,</p>
<p>and you go, oh my God, when you left that environment,</p>
<p>because everyone else is driving all the time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>And you find out there&rsquo;s other ways of living</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s freedom when you get rid of that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh my God, I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that this was so much better.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something in the book that&rsquo;s called out</p>
<p>and I deemed it the virus of doubt.</p>
<p>And what the virus of doubt is, is when there&rsquo;s pain</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been habituated away,</p>
<p>you use the right marketing messages</p>
<p>to bring people back to that initial experience they had</p>
<p>or the initial experience that they had of that pain.</p>
<p>Do you remember when the first time you did blah</p>
<p>and it felt like this, right?</p>
<p>And then you reawaken that habituated pain</p>
<p>and people, and it becomes visceral</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re like, oh, yes, I hate that.</p>
<p>And then you go, now I have the painkiller</p>
<p>and the joy for you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it all comes together and it goes.</p>
<p>Let me, on this, on the pain and the joy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s brilliantly put, you mentioned selling</p>
<p>and marketing, right?</p>
<p>Marketing dollars.</p>
<p>I have a love, hate relationship with marketing,</p>
<p>like with a lot of things that require artistic genius.</p>
<p>To me, the best marketing, I suppose,</p>
<p>is the product itself and then word of mouth.</p>
<p>So like create a thing that people love.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, that&rsquo;s fundamental.</p>
<p>Yeah, so any other marketing requires genius</p>
<p>to be any extra thing.</p>
<p>Because to me, I don&rsquo;t, yeah, maybe you can,</p>
<p>by way of question, I&rsquo;m just speaking off the top</p>
<p>of my head as a consumer, what is great marketing?</p>
<p>What does it take to reveal the pain</p>
<p>and the joy of a thing?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It all starts at the beginning.</p>
<p>And let me give you, I&rsquo;m gonna give you a couple</p>
<p>of different ways of looking at it, okay?</p>
<p>And again, we might go a little long here.</p>
<p>So just stay tuned in.</p>
<p>So the first thing is.</p>
<p>Start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>In the early part of my career, like General Magic</p>
<p>and Philips and what have you,</p>
<p>and especially when I was a teenager,</p>
<p>when I was making my own chips and stuff like that,</p>
<p>I really worried about just putting cool things together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like that, when I put those two cool things together</p>
<p>as an engineer, you go, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>And then I would talk to the other friends</p>
<p>who might be geeks too, and they go, yeah, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Because we knew the bits, so we put them together</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a new way of doing it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, wow, that&rsquo;s all what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not why?</p>
<p>Why are you doing this?</p>
<p>We know what we&rsquo;re doing, but we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why we&rsquo;re doing it, because we&rsquo;re not articulating it</p>
<p>for ourselves, because it&rsquo;s just something</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like putting it together and like, yeah, that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>because we think we&rsquo;re solving some problem we have,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not really articulating it.</p>
<p>So what normally happens, and this happens</p>
<p>because we invest in so many companies around the world,</p>
<p>you have these brilliant engineers, designers,</p>
<p>scientists, researchers, they put together these what&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And then they develop it, develop it, develop it.</p>
<p>And then at the end, they call in marketing</p>
<p>and say, now tell a story about this</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s get it out to the world, okay?</p>
<p>What happens then is marketing is like,</p>
<p>well, why do people need this?</p>
<p>Tell us why people need it.</p>
<p>And so they create a story around this product,</p>
<p>but the product was born out of what&rsquo;s, not why&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And so they start telling, marketing starts telling a story</p>
<p>and it turns out to be a fictional story usually.</p>
<p>They say, oh, this is going to do these things.</p>
<p>The product comes in as delivered.</p>
<p>And it falls flat on its face</p>
<p>because the marketing doesn&rsquo;t match the product</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t both created</p>
<p>at the beginning together, right?</p>
<p>There are what&rsquo;s when you create a product,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot more why&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and the why&rsquo;s help inform the what&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And the why&rsquo;s also inform the marketing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you mean deeply</p>
<p>at we should start at the beginning.</p>
<p>So the designer should be also the marketer.</p>
<p>The engineer should be the marketer.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Stop impressing the geek next to you.</p>
<p>What is the superpower you&rsquo;re bringing</p>
<p>or the pain you&rsquo;re killing for the end customer, right?</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s contrast that.</p>
<p>Think about a movie.</p>
<p>A movie starts with a treatment.</p>
<p>It has an audience.</p>
<p>This has the audience.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the characters.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the storyline, the plot.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the arc of the story, right?</p>
<p>It pulls that all out.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a script that&rsquo;s written.</p>
<p>And that script is then produced.</p>
<p>And then you add all the flourishes</p>
<p>and what have you music and graphics</p>
<p>and what have you, right?</p>
<p>And then it comes out</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the marketing of the movie.</p>
<p>And that story was created at the beginning.</p>
<p>What you need to do if you&rsquo;re gonna do a great product</p>
<p>is create that treatment for your product.</p>
<p>And I call that the press release.</p>
<p>Do the press release like the treatment.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the audience?</p>
<p>What features do you have?</p>
<p>What pains are you solving for people?</p>
<p>Have the virus of doubt there to remind them</p>
<p>what pains they have and why you&rsquo;re solving them.</p>
<p>The price, all of those things.</p>
<p>And you use that as the bar, the measuring stick</p>
<p>for what you do during development.</p>
<p>Because what happens that along the route, you know this.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re not gonna be able</p>
<p>to get that feature done on time.</p>
<p>Throw that one overboard.</p>
<p>We gotta hit the, we have to hit the date.</p>
<p>Oh, we&rsquo;re not sure this product&rsquo;s right yet.</p>
<p>Add another feature.</p>
<p>Add another feature creep, right?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have that story</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;re gonna tell at the beginning,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have that bar, right?</p>
<p>And then at the end, you don&rsquo;t know when you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have that story.</p>
<p>So you can actually look at that press release.</p>
<p>You know, you change it over time, that draft.</p>
<p>But then when you&rsquo;re done, you know the what&rsquo;s and the whys.</p>
<p>You have all the things, the audience and everything.</p>
<p>And then you can give that to marketing and say,</p>
<p>well, and marketing has been along the way, let&rsquo;s be clear.</p>
<p>But then everybody&rsquo;s in sync.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you can tell a cohesive,</p>
<p>non fictional story about,</p>
<p>and the product delivers on that story</p>
<p>or hopefully over delivers on that story.</p>
<p>So in the drafting from the beginning</p>
<p>to the end of the press release,</p>
<p>what does a successful team look like?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s part of the draft?</p>
<p>Is it engineers, designers?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose of a marketing department</p>
<p>in a company, small, let&rsquo;s say small company,</p>
<p>but more than two people?</p>
<p>So from where does the why come from?</p>
<p>Should it always come from the designer</p>
<p>or should there be a marketing person</p>
<p>that yeah, steps in and ask the question.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just keep asking random questions.</p>
<p>No, these are great questions.</p>
<p>So, cause you&rsquo;re just like, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to tell you the answer.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in the book as well,</p>
<p>but you have to separate out</p>
<p>the various functions of marketing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought, I was like,</p>
<p>marketing&rsquo;s marketing, and it&rsquo;s really not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many disciplines,</p>
<p>just like in engineering, mechanical, electrical, software,</p>
<p>and even software, it&rsquo;s cloud services,</p>
<p>firmware applications,</p>
<p>marketing has that much diversity as well.</p>
<p>Okay, and you have to honor that.</p>
<p>And so there is marketing communications like PR, press,</p>
<p>there is social marketing,</p>
<p>there is a marketing creative, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s marketing activation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another thing that also comes out</p>
<p>and people confuse it with marketing,</p>
<p>which is called product marketing or product management.</p>
<p>And product management or product marketing</p>
<p>is the voice of the customer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the person who sits there and listens</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s going on in the competition, in the marketplace,</p>
<p>understanding the needs and those pains of the customer,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re representing them in every single meeting</p>
<p>so things don&rsquo;t get off track, right?</p>
<p>So that, and they&rsquo;re creating the messages,</p>
<p>not the marketing.</p>
<p>What happens is there&rsquo;s messages</p>
<p>that product marketing creates,</p>
<p>like those are the deep messages,</p>
<p>like we need to save 20% of energy, let&rsquo;s say, right?</p>
<p>And then marketing turns that into something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s with creative and everything</p>
<p>and brings that message across.</p>
<p>Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t say that,</p>
<p>but it comes maybe visually or some other way.</p>
<p>So product management does that</p>
<p>and holds that press release along the route</p>
<p>and making sure that we&rsquo;re tracking.</p>
<p>And then also marketing is tracking with that press release</p>
<p>to make sure they&rsquo;re not telling a fictional story, right?</p>
<p>Because they can also add extra adjectives or something,</p>
<p>and then the product can&rsquo;t deliver that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Keeps everybody in check.</p>
<p>It has to be grounded to the press release, to the raws.</p>
<p>Right, to the customer needs, right?</p>
<p>Cause they&rsquo;re always representing the customer.</p>
<p>So you have to have a product manager.</p>
<p>Typically that&rsquo;s the founder, right?</p>
<p>In the beginning.</p>
<p>And then over time you hire a product management team</p>
<p>to then really watch over this the whole way.</p>
<p>And they are talking to customer support.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking to engineering, they&rsquo;re talking to design,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking to sales and marketing.</p>
<p>And they are always in the mix.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the hardest thing to hire for.</p>
<p>Ooh, yeah.</p>
<p>So they have this very important job</p>
<p>of developing and maintaining the why.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Why is it the hardest to hire for?</p>
<p>Because you have to understand,</p>
<p>first, nobody reports to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re alone.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re alone and you have to build great ties</p>
<p>with all of these different functions.</p>
<p>You have to understand what they do,</p>
<p>be empathetic with what they do.</p>
<p>And you have to project the customer&rsquo;s empathy</p>
<p>or empathy for the customer to them and tell them why</p>
<p>and why this customer needs this, why this doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And so that they learn more.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just doing,</p>
<p>but they learn about the customer&rsquo;s point of view</p>
<p>and sit in there and stand in their shoes</p>
<p>to be able to then make better decisions</p>
<p>on the engineering details or the operational details,</p>
<p>customer support details.</p>
<p>So they understand that if they&rsquo;re not the customer</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s intended for,</p>
<p>they start to live through their eyes</p>
<p>and see through their eyes of that customer</p>
<p>so they make better decisions.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably fascinating, beautiful tensions</p>
<p>between that and sort of the engineers.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Sort of the developing the what.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Which makes it an extra hard job, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Can I ask a sort of a little bit of a personal question</p>
<p>on the one subfield of marketing you mentioned,</p>
<p>comms and PR.</p>
<p>How do I ask this?</p>
<p>I can hear your struggle in your sigh.</p>
<p>Why or do the comms and PR folks sometimes</p>
<p>kill the heart and soul of the magic</p>
<p>that makes a company or is that wrong to say?</p>
<p>Give me an example.</p>
<p>I will say the spirit of the example,</p>
<p>which is it feels like often the jobs of communications</p>
<p>is to provide caution.</p>
<p>It almost works together with legal to say.</p>
<p>A shield.</p>
<p>Yeah, we probably should not say this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be careful, let&rsquo;s be careful.</p>
<p>Now, that makes sense except in this modern world,</p>
<p>authenticity is extremely valuable</p>
<p>and revealing the beauty that is in the engineering,</p>
<p>the beauty of the ideas, the chaos of the ideas,</p>
<p>I think requires throwing caution to the wind to some degree.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And I just find that, boy, to push back on myself,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an extremely difficult job</p>
<p>because people hold you responsible</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re doing communications when you take risks.</p>
<p>And especially when they fail.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a difficult job,</p>
<p>so I understand why people become cautious,</p>
<p>but to me, communications is about taking big risks</p>
<p>and throwing caution to the wind at its best</p>
<p>because your job is to communicate in the long term,</p>
<p>communicate the genius, the joy,</p>
<p>the genius of the product.</p>
<p>And that sometimes is a tension with caution.</p>
<p>Sorry, so because I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance</p>
<p>to meet a lot of very interesting people</p>
<p>and interesting engineering teams and so on,</p>
<p>I look at what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and I look at what&rsquo;s being communicated</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s a mismatch</p>
<p>because the communication is a lot more boring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s something very like,</p>
<p>just straight up boring</p>
<p>about the way they&rsquo;re communicating because of caution.</p>
<p>Okay, you have just teed me up for another diatribe, okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get on my podium here.</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, it all comes out of the leader.</p>
<p>If the leader doesn&rsquo;t know how to storytell</p>
<p>or the leader doesn&rsquo;t know how to do bold storytelling,</p>
<p>then you get even more conservatism</p>
<p>from the PR and communications folks</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re always,</p>
<p>so if you have a, not a bold leader,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always going to be a filter, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always gonna try to smooth things out</p>
<p>and take off the rough edges and try,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re gonna be even more,</p>
<p>if you have a conservative messaging leader,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have an even more</p>
<p>conservative communications department.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they wanna keep their jobs.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s really simple.</p>
<p>They gotta keep their jobs.</p>
<p>If they say one wrong thing, it could be the end of it.</p>
<p>So if you have very conservative leader,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be even more conservative.</p>
<p>If you have a bold leader,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll always take a little more conservative bent,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still gonna have bold communications.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Okay, so it starts with the leader.</p>
<p>Now, that said,</p>
<p>when you think about the messages</p>
<p>and the joy and revealing things, right?</p>
<p>Many of these leaders don&rsquo;t tell great stories.</p>
<p>So what we do at FutureShape, our investment firm,</p>
<p>is we take those scientists all of,</p>
<p>and the great minds and everything,</p>
<p>and what do we surround them with?</p>
<p>Marketing and communication people</p>
<p>and storytellers to give them the confidence</p>
<p>to tell a much broader story</p>
<p>about the impacts of what they&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>and how big the global change can be</p>
<p>with those technologies.</p>
<p>Because usually they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>those leaders who created those technologies,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really know how to communicate really well</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t feel very comfortable in how they speak.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because stories, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of stories.</p>
<p>Have you ever read the book, Story?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>By Robert McKee?</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>You should read this.</p>
<p>And this is what I read when I was 26.</p>
<p>Story by Robert McKee,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a book all about the ways to do script writing,</p>
<p>the prototypical types of scripts, drama, comedy,</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s been shown over millennia,</p>
<p>how these stories are done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating thing</p>
<p>and it gives you an insight to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s written for obviously Hollywood</p>
<p>and movies and things like that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s incredibly useful for what we do</p>
<p>as designers and engineers and technology leaders.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect in this modern day</p>
<p>where this podcast and so on,</p>
<p>what I love is the humans behind the story too.</p>
<p>So some part of the story is the human beings.</p>
<p>So humor, drama,</p>
<p>heartbreak, hope.</p>
<p>Emotions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not just about painting a beautiful story</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s flawless, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Vulnerability.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being a dreamer, like overpromising,</p>
<p>and then failing, so changing your mind,</p>
<p>realizing sort of just the whole of it.</p>
<p>And then also being like,</p>
<p>depending of course where your personality is,</p>
<p>embracing the full richness and the complexity</p>
<p>of the personality of the leader</p>
<p>or the different people involved.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s all part of it.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t just present this beautiful,</p>
<p>always pleasant view of a product.</p>
<p>There has to be this humanity that&rsquo;s part of it,</p>
<p>the full roller coaster of the humanity,</p>
<p>which I think has been very difficult for companies</p>
<p>to embrace, I&rsquo;m not sure why.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just an old school way of doing things</p>
<p>that people think that we present a facade</p>
<p>and we generate the story and we tell the story</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, we learn, especially in the technical world,</p>
<p>we present the story as it&rsquo;s faster, it&rsquo;s smaller,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s longer battery life, it&rsquo;s bits and numbers</p>
<p>and metrics, that resonates sure with other geeks.</p>
<p>What resonates with the planet?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all emotions, right?</p>
<p>And if you can bring a great emotional story,</p>
<p>but with a great rational story at the same time,</p>
<p>why you should do this, and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh my God, you bring that superpower, that joy,</p>
<p>then it all hangs.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s personal drama too, like the human.</p>
<p>Right, here&rsquo;s the pain I had, remember that thing.</p>
<p>And I mean, you&rsquo;re obviously this extremely well known</p>
<p>human being that&rsquo;s behind a lot of these great inventions</p>
<p>of the technology world, but you&rsquo;re also just</p>
<p>a human being, you have clearly a distinct personality</p>
<p>that comes through, like your eyes light up,</p>
<p>just the way you communicate, it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>Some people are more stoic, some people are,</p>
<p>like Elon is all over the place, the chaos.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to put into words,</p>
<p>I can be poetic and so on, but there&rsquo;s a very distinct,</p>
<p>comes on stage, you know, that personality is right there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not just the product, that&rsquo;s something else too.</p>
<p>And like, you have to reveal that a little bit,</p>
<p>and allow people to reveal that a little bit,</p>
<p>and just let them be themselves.</p>
<p>Well, look, why do I think your podcast is so amazing?</p>
<p>Because you are yourself.</p>
<p>You talk about yourself, you bring your emotions into it,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t modulate it, you&rsquo;re you, right?</p>
<p>It comes through, it&rsquo;s true, it feels right.</p>
<p>You are you, you dress the way you wanna dress,</p>
<p>you say this is me, and this is all of me,</p>
<p>and you become vulnerable, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to do a podcast like that</p>
<p>than run a very large company,</p>
<p>where a lot of people would feel the pain if you make,</p>
<p>if you say something stupid.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s much more easy to be afraid and be careful.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, the same applies.</p>
<p>Authenticity and risk taking is the only way, unfortunately,</p>
<p>to be successful in the long term.</p>
<p>Let me, just because we&rsquo;re jumping all over the place,</p>
<p>just link on the iPod.</p>
<p>One of the great designs, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>in the word design of all time,</p>
<p>what does it take to design a great product?</p>
<p>If you look, we can jump around, we can look at Nest,</p>
<p>we can look at iPod, we can look at iPhone,</p>
<p>and many of the great things you design,</p>
<p>but just looking at that one transformational thing,</p>
<p>what can you say about what it takes to do a great design?</p>
<p>Or maybe what makes a great design?</p>
<p>Well, we talked about a painkiller,</p>
<p>and we talked about the,</p>
<p>we talked about that joy that comes from it.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the behind the scenes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the team, there&rsquo;s everyone who brings it to life,</p>
<p>brings that story to life.</p>
<p>If you have a great story, and you know the why,</p>
<p>then you can communicate it</p>
<p>to those people who are working on it.</p>
<p>And then they bring their own thing into it, right?</p>
<p>It becomes emotional for them too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a job, it&rsquo;s a mission.</p>
<p>And so many of the details that are born</p>
<p>out of these early prototypes,</p>
<p>these things that you still haven&rsquo;t given full form to,</p>
<p>there may be 80% done, or maybe even 60% done,</p>
<p>but you can see enough in there.</p>
<p>Then you take those great ideas,</p>
<p>and you give the whys to the team.</p>
<p>And so that they feel it, they can understand it,</p>
<p>then they bring their best and their ideas to the table,</p>
<p>and then you can select from those,</p>
<p>and you can then start to, you know,</p>
<p>it could be just a pixel change.</p>
<p>It could be a slight change on how you do the audio</p>
<p>for the feedback, or maybe a curve on the mechanics,</p>
<p>or something like that, of how it feels.</p>
<p>Because everybody brings themselves</p>
<p>trying to feel this thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just doing something</p>
<p>that someone told them to do.</p>
<p>If you can instill that mission and that why into that team,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be big, you get, I feel, a 10X.</p>
<p>Everyone comes together in a special way,</p>
<p>and the magic is created.</p>
<p>You put the love into it,</p>
<p>the customer feels the love on the other side.</p>
<p>So the, making the team,</p>
<p>like taking them in onto the vision, onto the why,</p>
<p>now they feel, all the little details we think of,</p>
<p>the original iPod, and all the many generations after,</p>
<p>all those little details are,</p>
<p>in them is the emotion of the engineers and the designers,</p>
<p>that working nights, struggling, this isn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>Like you said, changing little pixels here and there,</p>
<p>changing the shape of things, changing the feel of things,</p>
<p>like the materials, the, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>just everything on the software part of the packaging.</p>
<p>Then the words on the packaging.</p>
<p>Just everything.</p>
<p>The words on the website.</p>
<p>And always jumping from the very specific detail problem</p>
<p>to the big picture, how the thing feels, the overall.</p>
<p>Always jumping back and forth.</p>
<p>What does it look like to the customer?</p>
<p>How are we gonna implement it in the most efficient way?</p>
<p>Because a lot of the stuff you don&rsquo;t know is,</p>
<p>some of that stuff is hacked in, maybe hacked in at the end.</p>
<p>It may not be the most beautiful architecture</p>
<p>that a geek would look at and go, oh my God,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so beautiful, because we can look at it</p>
<p>and visualize this incredible software stack</p>
<p>or hardware stack.</p>
<p>Some of it could just be hacked in.</p>
<p>You make it better over time,</p>
<p>but it was that brilliant thing and we gotta get that in,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the way you do it now,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll make it more efficient later.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a good moment to draw a distinction</p>
<p>between design and engineering,</p>
<p>and does such a distinction even exist?</p>
<p>Are these distinct disciplines or no?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re distinct.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re different types of design.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s always this idea of this,</p>
<p>oh, on the mount, designer, and it all comes down</p>
<p>and it all flows down like some magic.</p>
<p>There are electrical designers, there&rsquo;s AI designers,</p>
<p>there is data scientist designers.</p>
<p>Everybody has design, and there&rsquo;s a chapter in the book</p>
<p>all about that, actually.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s not just you go to the mount</p>
<p>and it comes down and you&rsquo;re enlightened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s each person brings their form of design</p>
<p>and their craft, because if they&rsquo;re really good,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re artists in their own right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just engineers, they&rsquo;re not just designers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re artists, they&rsquo;re empathetic,</p>
<p>they really wanna bring their best.</p>
<p>A lot of the best engineers I have</p>
<p>are not the technical, or that I&rsquo;ve worked with,</p>
<p>are not the technical gotta get it exactly right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the artists, they came from music</p>
<p>or they came from other things, and they see that.</p>
<p>When you work with very rigid engineers,</p>
<p>this is the way, the only way, la la la,</p>
<p>those are not the engineers I wanna work with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all like a bit artists at heart.</p>
<p>Right, they understand the practicalness.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to have the rigidity of,</p>
<p>this is the way it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Like, mm mm.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building something new,</p>
<p>all new and revolutionary, none of us are experts at it.</p>
<p>And if you come with that expert mindset, just tell me,</p>
<p>and I can give you a story,</p>
<p>I should probably give you that story,</p>
<p>about that if you come with the expert and I&rsquo;m the expert,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing something no one&rsquo;s ever done before,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you on the team.</p>
<p>Because we all are learning about something</p>
<p>that has never been in existence before.</p>
<p>And we have to bring that level of vulnerability</p>
<p>and openness to new ideas and new ways of doing things</p>
<p>throughout the team.</p>
<p>So you want people that are able to have like</p>
<p>beginner&rsquo;s mind or whatever, like don&rsquo;t come in as an expert.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story?</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s the story.</p>
<p>No, I can tell it for sure.</p>
<p>So, you know, you asked what were these risks,</p>
<p>you know, like on the early iPod,</p>
<p>and there was a few big risks.</p>
<p>Like one, and this doesn&rsquo;t go in the story,</p>
<p>but like putting rotating media in your pocket</p>
<p>and it could drop at any time,</p>
<p>what happens there?</p>
<p>And like you can damage,</p>
<p>because the heads and the hard drive media are so close,</p>
<p>it smacks, it&rsquo;s dead, right?</p>
<p>So that was one big one, like, holy shit, right?</p>
<p>So that was something we,</p>
<p>and we had to design special tests and everything</p>
<p>and special software on that.</p>
<p>But then there was another one,</p>
<p>which was at the early days,</p>
<p>the way the first generations of iPods,</p>
<p>I had to hack the IDE interface to the hard drives.</p>
<p>So I was like, okay, what we&rsquo;re gonna use</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re gonna use this chip for hard drive,</p>
<p>hard drive, to make a hard drive,</p>
<p>you had to have a chip that did FireWire to a hard drive.</p>
<p>Okay, and then that would become a portable hard drive.</p>
<p>Well, then we had the MP3 player</p>
<p>and the user interface and everything.</p>
<p>So there was times when it was just this hard drive</p>
<p>and there was times when it was a MP3 player</p>
<p>and I had to hot switch between</p>
<p>what the hard drive thinks it was talking to, right?</p>
<p>So designed this thing, tore it apart,</p>
<p>did all this stuff.</p>
<p>And I was like, you know,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m gonna screw up IDE and there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some holes I&rsquo;m gonna see.</p>
<p>So I go, who&rsquo;s the expert at Apple</p>
<p>who understands IDE and everything?</p>
<p>So this person comes over,</p>
<p>the mass storage specialist comes over</p>
<p>and I put on the whiteboard and say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re gonna do this thing</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the commands and da da,</p>
<p>and this is how it hot switches and everything.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s never gonna work.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I was like, what?</p>
<p>It was never gonna work.</p>
<p>I said, well, let me go over here</p>
<p>and show you this right here.</p>
<p>I have it prototyped and it&rsquo;s been working for days.</p>
<p>I just wanna see if you&rsquo;re gonna have it,</p>
<p>find any holes in the thing.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t even, and he just stormed out of the room</p>
<p>and never even, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of experience like this with experts.</p>
<p>Like for example, this ridiculous room.</p>
<p>I had a person and there&rsquo;s many people like this</p>
<p>that I showed them, here&rsquo;s the situation, you know.</p>
<p>For acoustics or something?</p>
<p>For acoustics, yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, no, no, no, no, this is horrible.</p>
<p>This is not, this is not gonna work.</p>
<p>The reflection, the curtains are not gonna stop.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of terminology they&rsquo;re telling me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a similar kind of situation as the ID,</p>
<p>which I was like, no, listen,</p>
<p>I just need to see is there major issues</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like a low hanging fruit that are fixable</p>
<p>and major holes I should be aware of.</p>
<p>Not like, let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>$100,000 to upgrade.</p>
<p>To upgrade for what exact purpose?</p>
<p>What, not why?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>The why, the focusing on the story, on the content,</p>
<p>on the, the why, the why, the why.</p>
<p>And that actually I&rsquo;ve experienced that unfortunately</p>
<p>in the artistic realms too, which is like photography</p>
<p>and videography, cinematography.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, I talk to photographers</p>
<p>that are quote unquote experts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always about so much of the focus</p>
<p>is on the equipment.</p>
<p>The equipment behind the sensors and the lighting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, all right, all right.</p>
<p>But what about, what about the feeling</p>
<p>of the story you create visually?</p>
<p>The difference between a movie that&rsquo;s really well told</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t have all the effects and everything</p>
<p>versus maybe some of the superhero movies</p>
<p>we see all the time, which is good luck if there&rsquo;s a story</p>
<p>but man, there&rsquo;s a lot of action and CGI, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also value to those, right?</p>
<p>CGI, superhero.</p>
<p>Can tell a better story</p>
<p>but you have to have a good story to begin with.</p>
<p>Sure, exactly.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re focused on the story,</p>
<p>I guess you need to start with a story.</p>
<p>You need to start with a story.</p>
<p>And if you bring in experts,</p>
<p>they can often be detrimental, I guess, to the why.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too good at doing the what.</p>
<p>Well, you can bring in experts for why.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of experts for why.</p>
<p>Too many times we get experts for what.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then they only focus on the what.</p>
<p>And so they come with the specs and feeds</p>
<p>and the numbers and all the other stuff.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re really asking for is I need somebody</p>
<p>about the why and understanding</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re trying to get done here</p>
<p>and fitting the what&rsquo;s into that why, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I do think that one of the qualities</p>
<p>that I really enjoy for people to work with</p>
<p>is like humility for a particular problem</p>
<p>when you approach it.</p>
<p>Basically, I don&rsquo;t know how to solve this</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re going to figure it out.</p>
<p>As opposed to, oh, I&rsquo;ve solved this thing many, many times</p>
<p>before I know exactly what to do.</p>
<p>Humility before the chaos.</p>
<p>So having an open mind that this is going to require</p>
<p>a totally new way of doing things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really nice quality to see.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the fascinating humans</p>
<p>in the history of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Steve is another one of those.</p>
<p>So those two humans came together for a time</p>
<p>to work together.</p>
<p>What was it like working with Steve Jobs?</p>
<p>What aspect of his behavior and personality,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, brought out the best in you?</p>
<p>Pushing you, really pushing you,</p>
<p>relentless on the details,</p>
<p>challenging you for the right reasons.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t bullying, it wasn&rsquo;t demeaning.</p>
<p>He would critique the work, not judge the person,</p>
<p>at least not in front of them.</p>
<p>Or inside of a, you know, in front of a group</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>I know it was really that attention to detail.</p>
<p>And he, when he would make a decision, you know,</p>
<p>there are, when you make the first version of anything,</p>
<p>something revolutionary,</p>
<p>there are a lot of opinion based decisions.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only one or two people, three people</p>
<p>who hold those opinion based decisions</p>
<p>and what they should be.</p>
<p>And when you have those opinions</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to work with the team</p>
<p>to implement those decisions,</p>
<p>you have to really tell the why of those decisions.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t go do it, but why it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So you can feel part of that decision.</p>
<p>You can understand what were the trade offs</p>
<p>of the different other answers to that opinion, right?</p>
<p>And say, this is the reason why we picked the route we picked</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s this for the customer</p>
<p>or this for the whole world story, what have you.</p>
<p>So that you felt really good</p>
<p>because a lot of times most people</p>
<p>want a data driven decision,</p>
<p>but with the ones you don&rsquo;t get data, right?</p>
<p>Maybe in a B2B, you could a little bit</p>
<p>cause you can talk to customers,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t do that with a consumer product.</p>
<p>V1, version one, B2B, business to business</p>
<p>versus what&rsquo;s the alternative?</p>
<p>Business to consumer, V1.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re just defining some terms.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re absolutely.</p>
<p>And when you say data driven decisions versus what?</p>
<p>Opinion based decisions.</p>
<p>So like gut, you have to use, you don&rsquo;t have any.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t fall back on any data or any previous history</p>
<p>to kind of inform you of what&rsquo;s going on, right?</p>
<p>And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed</p>
<p>and cannot make new innovations and new products,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re trying to turn,</p>
<p>and this is what I saw at Phillips,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to turn opinion based decisions</p>
<p>into data driven decisions so they don&rsquo;t lose their jobs.</p>
<p>So if you look at management consulting,</p>
<p>management consulting is all about</p>
<p>taking those opinion based decisions,</p>
<p>giving them to someone else to turn into data</p>
<p>that comes back to them and says,</p>
<p>they can blame the management consultants</p>
<p>when something goes wrong,</p>
<p>as opposed to it wasn&rsquo;t me, right?</p>
<p>When you need to have to tell that story,</p>
<p>you have to understand that, especially V1,</p>
<p>you need to be able to articulate</p>
<p>those opinion based decisions and you need to own them.</p>
<p>And if you fail with some of them, you didn&rsquo;t get it right,</p>
<p>you then own them and fix them and move on, right?</p>
<p>Version one of the iPod wasn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>Version one of the iPhone wasn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>We got a lot of opinion based decisions wrong.</p>
<p>But as you go through that, because you got more data,</p>
<p>because V2, you had data on those original opinions</p>
<p>and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll still have new opinions</p>
<p>because those are differentiators</p>
<p>that we call differentiators,</p>
<p>the things that move the product forward in its evolution.</p>
<p>But at the revolution stage,</p>
<p>opinions, opinions, opinions, no data.</p>
<p>And so you have this discussion, you and Steve</p>
<p>in the stage and the whole team with opinions.</p>
<p>And there you have to be harsh.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t say harsh,</p>
<p>but you have to be very determined, right?</p>
<p>You know, there are two real opinion based decisions</p>
<p>that happened on the iPhone.</p>
<p>One was the keyboard.</p>
<p>Should we have a hardboard keyboard</p>
<p>or should we have a virtual keyboard?</p>
<p>The Blackberry was the number one</p>
<p>productivity messaging device of its time.</p>
<p>It was called a Crackberry for a reason</p>
<p>because people loved it because it was easy to type</p>
<p>and they could get their work done.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;re gonna move from that,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s talking about that in the market</p>
<p>and you say we&rsquo;re gonna move to a virtual keyboard</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna work as well as the hardware keyboard,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an opinion based decision, right?</p>
<p>Because the data is telling you</p>
<p>all the best sales are over here.</p>
<p>God, that takes guts.</p>
<p>It takes guts, but you have to look at it</p>
<p>from a different point of view.</p>
<p>And this is how I learned to come to understand this</p>
<p>because I had been building virtual keyboards before</p>
<p>and I knew the goodness and the badness in them, right?</p>
<p>But he was like, look, those are productivity devices.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making it, ours is born out of an entertainment device</p>
<p>and productivity, right?</p>
<p>We need to show full screen videos.</p>
<p>We are gonna have apps, not apps, but our apps,</p>
<p>the Apple apps, cause there were no app store yet,</p>
<p>are gonna take over the whole screen.</p>
<p>You want a full screen web browser.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want one that&rsquo;s like half of the device</p>
<p>is just a keyboard.</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t need that keyboard in every instance.</p>
<p>So we want that part of the screen to change</p>
<p>based on the tool you may need at the time.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s just full view, right?</p>
<p>So you have to go and understand</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a different type of device,</p>
<p>just cause that&rsquo;s that and it&rsquo;s successful for that reason,</p>
<p>the crackberry for the keyboard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the only thing you&rsquo;re gonna do with this device</p>
<p>cause people only did messaging</p>
<p>and maybe a few phone calls, right?</p>
<p>This was gonna be so much more.</p>
<p>It was gonna be an entertainment web browsing device.</p>
<p>So you wanted those tools to go away,</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t be as good as the hardware keyboard.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an opinion.</p>
<p>But let me give you another opinion based decision</p>
<p>that got turned around before it shipped.</p>
<p>Steve said, no SIM slot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any slots.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna make it very pure.</p>
<p>Johnny was like, of course, no slots.</p>
<p>Johnny, hi.</p>
<p>And we all looked around and go, that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Well, why does Varite?</p>
<p>And then he would always, and this was the magic of Steve,</p>
<p>like when you said, no, that doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d go, well, why does Verizon not have any SIM slots?</p>
<p>They showed that you can do a mobile phone</p>
<p>with no SIM slots.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, okay, here we go.</p>
<p>And so a few days later, we come back with,</p>
<p>so product marketing, voice of the customer, engineering,</p>
<p>we all come back with all the data</p>
<p>showing how many data networks and mobile networks</p>
<p>required SIM cards versus did not and what the trends were.</p>
<p>And so we showed the data and that killed the,</p>
<p>or excuse me, brought back the SIM slot</p>
<p>on the original iPhone.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re like, because he was just like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna tell AT&amp;T to not use a SIM, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna just tell them to do it differently, right?</p>
<p>But we were like,</p>
<p>if we want this thing to go anywhere around the world,</p>
<p>you wanna put that friction in.</p>
<p>People are gonna move from place to place.</p>
<p>They have different SIMs</p>
<p>because of the prices and all that stuff.</p>
<p>We had to show all of that data.</p>
<p>And then that opinion based decision got turned</p>
<p>into a data driven decision.</p>
<p>And the SIM slot obviously showed up.</p>
<p>So those are two very, at the very same time, right?</p>
<p>Opinion can hold and so can data overrule opinion</p>
<p>when data does exist for a V1.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is.</p>
<p>So doing no SIM card slot</p>
<p>may have been the right decision.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Because maybe if that was the decision,</p>
<p>then like many times throughout Apple&rsquo;s history,</p>
<p>you basically changed the tide of how technology is done.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you never know.</p>
<p>Apple started WiFi.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t understand WiFi came out of there.</p>
<p>There was no WiFi in 2001.</p>
<p>Apple started WiFi.</p>
<p>And then everyone else got on board.</p>
<p>If you look at now where we&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to phones without SIM slots.</p>
<p>Cause we have eSIMs, right?</p>
<p>And now the SIM slots becoming legacy, legacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a legacy port.</p>
<p>That legacy port will probably be gone</p>
<p>by six, maybe 10 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure of that.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so much easier for carriers.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to have physical things to go out and right.</p>
<p>So right now it&rsquo;s just the early days,</p>
<p>but it will happen and it will go its way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll fall away, but it will take time.</p>
<p>You just couldn&rsquo;t do it back then.</p>
<p>So timing is essential here, but at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s opinions and that&rsquo;s where the genius is.</p>
<p>Sometimes the data tells you one thing,</p>
<p>but the data at the end of the day does represent the past.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And the future may be different than the past.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s wisdom in the past</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s actually representative</p>
<p>of something that should be overcome</p>
<p>and progress looks like leaving that stuff behind.</p>
<p>Like the headphone jack.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean that when different folks were getting rid</p>
<p>of the headphone jack, boy, I would love to be a fly</p>
<p>in the wall of those discussions.</p>
<p>We had that, oh, that was a discussion</p>
<p>that happened almost every year.</p>
<p>That was an every year,</p>
<p>should we get rid of headphone jacks on the iPod, right?</p>
<p>When are wireless headsets gonna happen, right?</p>
<p>And it took years to build all the right protocols,</p>
<p>the chips, all those things to make the experience</p>
<p>that is the iPods today, right?</p>
<p>To say, have the confidence,</p>
<p>cause Bluetooth was good, but it wasn&rsquo;t Apple like.</p>
<p>So that is like, we gotta make our own chips,</p>
<p>we gotta make our own software stacks.</p>
<p>Now we have the confidence to remove the headphone jack</p>
<p>and actually make you pay $200 more for your iPhone</p>
<p>that you were just paying because of the headphone jack.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve grown our revenue,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve given a new experience to the user, right?</p>
<p>And ta da, you know, and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>And now the world&rsquo;s transformed to everyone,</p>
<p>you know, moving to that, right?</p>
<p>But it took years to understand the problem,</p>
<p>develop the technology and not just rush it to market</p>
<p>to get a half experience, but to get it right</p>
<p>and refine it, then ship it.</p>
<p>And only then after it was probably four</p>
<p>or five years in development,</p>
<p>just like the M1 processor, right?</p>
<p>That was a work from 2008, right?</p>
<p>Grinding away, grinding away, grinding away,</p>
<p>then saying, okay, now we have the confidence</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing our own silicon for all the iPhones</p>
<p>and iPads and such.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna turn to the Mac</p>
<p>and make sure we have the best processor, right?</p>
<p>Not just that we have the best integrated design team.</p>
<p>And then saying we&rsquo;re gonna, you know,</p>
<p>and then besting everyone, making sure the softwares</p>
<p>and the hardware is designed at the same time,</p>
<p>making sure the kernels, all those things</p>
<p>are gonna use the best efficiency and then popping it out.</p>
<p>And then it feels seamless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>There were no, as far as I could tell,</p>
<p>unless you were in real esoteric drivers</p>
<p>or something like that, it just worked.</p>
<p>It was magic.</p>
<p>Like the transition, it was not even a speed bump.</p>
<p>It was not even a crack in the road.</p>
<p>So perhaps famously Steve had a bit of a temper.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, would you say his particular personality</p>
<p>in this aspect was constructive or destructive</p>
<p>in the process of shaping these opinion based ideas?</p>
<p>So in Build, I write a chapter called Assholes.</p>
<p>Yes, and you lay out beautifully the types of assholes</p>
<p>and maybe you could speak to the constructive</p>
<p>and the destructive types of assholes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s really two delineations that I&rsquo;ve found</p>
<p>of real fundamental ones.</p>
<p>And that is again, the why.</p>
<p>Why do I feel this person is an asshole?</p>
<p>They might not be.</p>
<p>I feel this is a person who&rsquo;s an asshole.</p>
<p>Are they motivated by their ego</p>
<p>or are they motivated by their mission?</p>
<p>Something they&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>and doing in service of something else, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes those lines can be blurry,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s usually pretty clear.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s ego motivated, it&rsquo;s clear they&rsquo;re just trying</p>
<p>to get up in the ranks, push people down,</p>
<p>shove people aside.</p>
<p>I think we saw a president do that on a stage once.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m me and I&rsquo;m the guy, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna prove it by pushing everyone away</p>
<p>and being nefarious or what have you.</p>
<p>Either passively aggressive or aggressively aggressive,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re doing about themselves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another one, which is someone who&rsquo;s so attentive</p>
<p>to detail and unrelenting that they&rsquo;re trying to get</p>
<p>the right things for the country.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to get the right things for the customer</p>
<p>or in service of their mission.</p>
<p>And they wanna make sure we fulfill those things, right?</p>
<p>And they really care.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t micromanage all the details,</p>
<p>but they micromanage the details where the customer,</p>
<p>it touches the customer in some way.</p>
<p>People who work with those types of people</p>
<p>who are unrelenting and push you and might make you upset.</p>
<p>A lot of times it&rsquo;s a knee jerk reaction to go,</p>
<p>they are an asshole.</p>
<p>Get off my back, you&rsquo;re an ass, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Right, and you&rsquo;re protecting your ego</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s happening is that person</p>
<p>is usually pushing you beyond your boundaries.</p>
<p>They see something that we can do or you can do</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just either not wanting to do</p>
<p>for whatever reason, you&rsquo;re not confident in that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t wanna take the extra time</p>
<p>and saying, no, we need to get that done and pushing you.</p>
<p>Okay, and so when we came to those areas,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just a one on one,</p>
<p>it could be Steve against the team going,</p>
<p>we need glass instead of plastic</p>
<p>on the front face of the iPhone,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to do this.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, God, you know, and so we did it.</p>
<p>And he pushed us because he didn&rsquo;t know all the details,</p>
<p>but he could see in our minds that we&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,</p>
<p>but man, it&rsquo;s really putting us in risk.</p>
<p>And we laid out the risks for him.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m willing to take those risks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, we might be three months late.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, this is so important.</p>
<p>We need to stay on time.</p>
<p>You know, but it would be all the time, push, push, push.</p>
<p>It reminds me of like kids growing up and me as growing up,</p>
<p>you know, when your parents push you</p>
<p>to make you grow beyond your boundaries,</p>
<p>your personal boundaries.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, God damn it, I&rsquo;m so, you know,</p>
<p>but they do it for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s see, it&rsquo;s not bullying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about bullying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about demeaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about either pushing you to another part of the mission</p>
<p>that needs to get done, or it&rsquo;s about critiquing your work,</p>
<p>but not judging you.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot to say there.</p>
<p>So one, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It really is fascinating.</p>
<p>And you laid out a very nice picture,</p>
<p>but it does feel like there&rsquo;s sometimes gray areas,</p>
<p>which is why it makes all of this very complicated.</p>
<p>So one question I have for you</p>
<p>in terms of glass on the iPhone.</p>
<p>How important is it that like Steve in that case is right?</p>
<p>Because I could argue each side.</p>
<p>It seems like in one sense,</p>
<p>just having a strong vision and opinion</p>
<p>is already going to make everybody grow,</p>
<p>even if it turns out to be the wrong.</p>
<p>As long as you are sort of standing your ground,</p>
<p>you know, Napoleon invading Russia or something</p>
<p>in the winter, like it&rsquo;s just not gonna be a good idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good idea, but I&rsquo;m gonna hold to that.</p>
<p>And then once you decide, you go all in.</p>
<p>And then from that, even if the whole team knows</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the wrong decision, just sticking by it,</p>
<p>powering through, you will learn through the pain of it.</p>
<p>Like everybody will learn.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one side.</p>
<p>The other is maybe the asshole, the vision driven asshole</p>
<p>gets to be more and more of an asshole</p>
<p>if they have a track record of through that process,</p>
<p>having built people up, having made the correct decisions.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re not allowed to be an asshole.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in rare air and no one can challenge them.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Steve was never that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the great thing.</p>
<p>He was never unchallengeable.</p>
<p>You could challenge him.</p>
<p>Now the plastic to glass story is a perfect example of this.</p>
<p>So at the beginning of the project,</p>
<p>well before we were going,</p>
<p>we had always had these things about plastic front iPods,</p>
<p>these kinds of things, scratches and all that stuff.</p>
<p>So we said, oh, we&rsquo;re gonna have a glass or a plastic,</p>
<p>a cover for the display.</p>
<p>Cause the display was glass underneath it.</p>
<p>We argued back and forth about glass versus plastic.</p>
<p>And then we all landed together on plastic.</p>
<p>Okay, the original decision was plastic.</p>
<p>And the reasons were, okay, we don&rsquo;t wanna make a mistake.</p>
<p>Glass can break, you know,</p>
<p>people drop them all the time.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t wanna have a fragile device</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna be using even more</p>
<p>than a music player, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna be holding your head</p>
<p>and putting it in your pocket and misses and all that stuff.</p>
<p>So we went down the road with plastic.</p>
<p>When it was shown, when the product was shown</p>
<p>at Mac World in 2007, the first time, that was plastic.</p>
<p>We had just enough of them in the field at the time.</p>
<p>We started to start seeing light scratches on the plastic.</p>
<p>Reviewers who didn&rsquo;t have the device yet,</p>
<p>cause it was behind glass.</p>
<p>If you remember 2007, the Jesus phone comes up</p>
<p>and no one could even touch them.</p>
<p>You could just look at it</p>
<p>in this beautiful museum quality box.</p>
<p>Like it came from the future or whatever, the past.</p>
<p>And it was just plastic.</p>
<p>And it was like, oh, and you just looked</p>
<p>and that was all you got.</p>
<p>But then people said, well, what screen is,</p>
<p>what covers on that, you know, reviewers who knew better,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s plastic.</p>
<p>And they were like, really?</p>
<p>And so there was enough of a doubt there.</p>
<p>And then when we started to do it,</p>
<p>and then Steve changed the frame of reference</p>
<p>of the question or of the result</p>
<p>of what the customer would think.</p>
<p>And he was like, if we designed it with plastic,</p>
<p>with plastic and it&rsquo;s in their pocket all the time</p>
<p>and it gets scratched by coins, slightly scratched</p>
<p>or by keys or something like that.</p>
<p>That is a design problem.</p>
<p>We need to fix the problem.</p>
<p>That was our bad.</p>
<p>If they go off and drop it or even slightly drop it</p>
<p>and it cracks, it&rsquo;s the customer&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>And they have much lower,</p>
<p>they have less likelihood to complain.</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;ll complain,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re part of that, of that failure.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s truth to that.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Because then they were part of why it failed.</p>
<p>Whereas the design, they didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.</p>
<p>It was just sitting in their pocket and it&rsquo;s scratching</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s normal use.</p>
<p>Abnormal use has been dropped.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, oh, now we get it.</p>
<p>And so we all moved to that mindset</p>
<p>when you framed the problem and the solution in that way</p>
<p>versus the original framing</p>
<p>where we all landed on plastic.</p>
<p>So, and then he was unrelenting on that,</p>
<p>but we all had moved and we had moved mindset</p>
<p>and we understood the why and we marshaled together.</p>
<p>And then by the end of June, and it was crazy,</p>
<p>the mechanical product design teams sourcing,</p>
<p>all of us, the partner Corning pulled together</p>
<p>to make that happen because it was the right reason.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So this, you look at these stories</p>
<p>and you hear just the top line rumors of the takeaways,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not usually how it all happened</p>
<p>of like one leader was, that&rsquo;s not how Steve was.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve seen leaders who are just pounding</p>
<p>and just had no real empathy for the team</p>
<p>and understanding the why.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it is the way I want it, right?</p>
<p>I am the supreme leader.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t like that when.</p>
<p>He just had a very strong opinion.</p>
<p>Very strong opinion.</p>
<p>But it was challengeable.</p>
<p>It was challengeable and if you came with the right thing,</p>
<p>you know, it was, you could modulate that,</p>
<p>but you had to come with a team.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t just be you.</p>
<p>It had to become a team and data and to overcome</p>
<p>because it was a very strong opinion.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s personal quirks of character, like you said.</p>
<p>Bad days and good days.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also the three options you said.</p>
<p>You noticed that the third option is always going</p>
<p>to be the one that&rsquo;s picked.</p>
<p>Those kinds of.</p>
<p>Idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>And that, so that brings up another thing.</p>
<p>You said challenge the idea, not the person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody who has a, you know, I have a temper.</p>
<p>I use colorful language and so on.</p>
<p>On teams I work.</p>
<p>In my private life I&rsquo;m much calmer and so on.</p>
<p>But I get, when I get really passionate</p>
<p>with engineering teams.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been called an asshole.</p>
<p>And you get, I mean, I am distinctly aware</p>
<p>that you cross lines often.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like levels, right?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You know, you could, it has to do with language</p>
<p>and how language is heard.</p>
<p>So for example, you could say a lot of stuff to me.</p>
<p>You could swear.</p>
<p>You could say stuff that sounds, like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Lex, sometimes I think you&rsquo;re the dumbest human</p>
<p>on the face of the earth or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That sounds very personal, right?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not gonna take that personally.</p>
<p>I understand what&rsquo;s being said.</p>
<p>And then I also notice that there&rsquo;s other people</p>
<p>that take stuff more personally.</p>
<p>This has to do with teams and figuring out like,</p>
<p>okay, who&rsquo;s going to take certain words personally</p>
<p>and not, and you have to know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes a great coach, a great leader,</p>
<p>a mentor, you have to like factor all that in.</p>
<p>But it just, there&rsquo;s something about just being an asshole</p>
<p>and being passionate and really driven</p>
<p>that sometimes you do cross lines.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that</p>
<p>because it feels like it comes with the territory.</p>
<p>Like you have, it seems like you can&rsquo;t just have</p>
<p>a perfectly optimized.</p>
<p>No, no, absolutely not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re humans.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re humans, we don&rsquo;t have a program.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s programmed the same way to react the same way</p>
<p>to given stimulus, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, you said, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if this was a real example, but you said,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re the dumbest human on earth or whatever.</p>
<p>I would never say that.</p>
<p>Absolutely never.</p>
<p>And if someone said that to me or I saw someone else say</p>
<p>that to another person on the team, absolutely not.</p>
<p>That is not allowed because that&rsquo;s judging someone.</p>
<p>You may be heated and you can get heated</p>
<p>and you can say it in your intonation,</p>
<p>but to then try to put a label on it</p>
<p>and put a label on a person, that is not allowed.</p>
<p>So if you let that kind of culture happen</p>
<p>and it becomes somewhat, you know, sometimes it&rsquo;s ingest,</p>
<p>you know, it has to be very much ingest</p>
<p>and those two people have to have</p>
<p>a really good working relationship.</p>
<p>But other than that, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot more, you could say a septic</p>
<p>in that way that you&rsquo;re not gonna add that stuff in,</p>
<p>but you can do it with all other types of ways</p>
<p>without saying that because then people who do react</p>
<p>to that kind of language and don&rsquo;t have those shields</p>
<p>because they might not have that stream confidence level</p>
<p>that you do and you can just brush it off,</p>
<p>that can be very cancerous in a team</p>
<p>because people then mean that and then they see,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s the right way to be.</p>
<p>You gotta snuff that out and you gotta be that,</p>
<p>you gotta be that change or that model</p>
<p>that you wanna show the team.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s too, even if it doesn&rsquo;t affect me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to affect a significant enough fraction</p>
<p>of brilliant people where that shouldn&rsquo;t be part</p>
<p>of the culture.</p>
<p>Exactly, and other people see that happen</p>
<p>and then, oh, I guess that&rsquo;s acceptable, right?</p>
<p>Just like politics in the workplace,</p>
<p>is that acceptable or not?</p>
<p>I call it out exactly when I see it in front of everyone,</p>
<p>right, because it&rsquo;s just another ego driven thing.</p>
<p>You have to set the tone as a leader</p>
<p>for what you want your organization to be</p>
<p>and how it gets reflected in the world</p>
<p>and you have to uphold that and you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>sure, you can have an excursion outside of that,</p>
<p>but you have to go back and say, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You have to go and apologize, heal and said,</p>
<p>I was not the person I wanted to be that day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is, and even in front of the team</p>
<p>and have that humility and say, we&rsquo;re all human here</p>
<p>and just cause I&rsquo;m the leader</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t make mistakes.</p>
<p>So have the self awareness, apologize.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also part of the culture.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>How are you different from Steve as a leader and designer?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve spoken about sort of what made you strong,</p>
<p>which is he was able to challenge,</p>
<p>he was able to push you to bring out the best.</p>
<p>Well, I come from the technical angle, right?</p>
<p>Deep technology, software, hardware, systems thinking,</p>
<p>implementation, all that stuff.</p>
<p>So I have a different bent.</p>
<p>He wanted to be an engineer, started,</p>
<p>but really he was much better at all the other things,</p>
<p>the storytelling, the interfacing</p>
<p>and being the voice of the customer</p>
<p>and being that product marketer in a way, right?</p>
<p>That we talked about.</p>
<p>I grew into being the product marketing, then marketing.</p>
<p>He came really out the other way, right?</p>
<p>And never got really deep technically.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s two different mindsets.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s not better or worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, that&rsquo;s how it is.</p>
<p>And it takes all kinds and all kinds can do great designs.</p>
<p>Did it manifest itself differently?</p>
<p>Just the fact that you came from those different places.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Like what, so like the discussion about glass on the iPhone</p>
<p>was probably had a different flavor to it.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>When you started getting into the technical details,</p>
<p>enough so you&rsquo;re getting the third order technical details</p>
<p>and he can&rsquo;t argue with that anymore.</p>
<p>Then with somebody he&rsquo;s like, okay.</p>
<p>At some point he&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t win this war.</p>
<p>And he learned that very early on</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t like the way the look of the Macintosh</p>
<p>board, the PCB was laid out.</p>
<p>He wanted it to be beautiful on the outside</p>
<p>and on the inside.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, why are all these wires running this way?</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t it have all this symmetry?</p>
<p>And we have to make it beautiful on the inside.</p>
<p>And even the traces on the boards</p>
<p>have to look a certain way.</p>
<p>So the teams made the board they knew that would work.</p>
<p>And then they made the board that the way Steve wanted it.</p>
<p>And that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And then Steve instantly figured out like at some point</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t micromanage every single detail.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some things he doesn&rsquo;t know enough about.</p>
<p>And so he would get out of that.</p>
<p>But that was one of those instances</p>
<p>where he pushed really hard and that&rsquo;s his opinion.</p>
<p>So they said, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna make it</p>
<p>a data driven decision and we&rsquo;re gonna make both.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna show you the results, right?</p>
<p>And then from there, he didn&rsquo;t get into those details.</p>
<p>So from that, you could have a great challenge, right?</p>
<p>Cause then you could get those data and say,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And let me show you why, or we can do that.</p>
<p>And then Steve would go, you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, oh, we can do that.</p>
<p>Let me show you, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certain times when you were like</p>
<p>bringing something to reality</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t think could exist, right?</p>
<p>So it was always that creative tension,</p>
<p>that interaction that was so successful, right?</p>
<p>I think, but there was one other fundamental thing</p>
<p>that was different and that it graded on the team</p>
<p>and that I made sure and I learned from to not do.</p>
<p>And I maybe overdue now in the opposite direction,</p>
<p>which is when there&rsquo;s a great idea that comes from the team,</p>
<p>acknowledge that person and go, that is a great idea.</p>
<p>As the leader, the opinion driven, that&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build on that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if that can do that.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s a great idea, but not for now, put it aside.</p>
<p>But call out when people have great ideas</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s infectious.</p>
<p>And that means maybe not ideas that come bubble up</p>
<p>to the customer level, but inside the organization.</p>
<p>People like they get rewarded for their ideas</p>
<p>and say, that&rsquo;s a great one.</p>
<p>Steve was always like, you give an idea</p>
<p>and he would go, okay, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The next day, 24 hours later,</p>
<p>it would come back with slight modifications.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this genius idea, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sooner or later we&rsquo;d look around the table</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d like roll our eyes and go, here we go again.</p>
<p>So it demotivates you from generating ideas a little bit.</p>
<p>Well, we got used to it,</p>
<p>but later on in the team, it was just not,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t want to bring the best, right?</p>
<p>Cause if you&rsquo;re always like, the reaction is never,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a genius idea.</p>
<p>It was always like, it was either negative or neutral.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Then it doesn&rsquo;t have that same emotional effect</p>
<p>that you want you to bring your best.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes it&rsquo;s fun when people get excited</p>
<p>by just, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You kind of build on top excitement.</p>
<p>It could be, but coupled with sort of harshness</p>
<p>when the idea is bad and you call out the bad ideas too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the good and the bad.</p>
<p>Oh, you could say, you don&rsquo;t have to say bad idea.</p>
<p>You say, maybe not now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s table that for later.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss it or say, that&rsquo;s a decent idea.</p>
<p>But did you think about that idea this way?</p>
<p>Not just no or yes,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about why that might not be applicable</p>
<p>in this case so that they can learn.</p>
<p>So the next time they bring the next idea,</p>
<p>they can modulate and understand</p>
<p>to start seeing through the opinion based decision makers</p>
<p>or the databases to bring it</p>
<p>and bring better formatted arguments or ideas</p>
<p>so that you have better chance of success the next time.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right?</p>
<p>You got to train through those moments.</p>
<p>You got to teach, those are teaching moments.</p>
<p>Teaching moments.</p>
<p>I aspire to be that kind of person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll usually just say that idea is shit.</p>
<p>That is the like, and then you,</p>
<p>I remember that this brilliant person</p>
<p>just gave that really shitty idea.</p>
<p>So I remember to make sure the next time</p>
<p>they give a good idea, I really compliment that good idea.</p>
<p>But I personally, I mean, it&rsquo;s emotion,</p>
<p>but I call out the really shitty ideas.</p>
<p>But you should call it the really great ones.</p>
<p>If you let the pendulum swing both ways,</p>
<p>then everybody goes, he&rsquo;s balanced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always one way.</p>
<p>Why bring any idea?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all about the pendulum.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You got to have both, the joy and the pain.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you give me pain all the time.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the glass and the iPhone.</p>
<p>So you wanted to, not just the iPod, not just Nest.</p>
<p>You were one of the key figures</p>
<p>in the creation of the iPhone.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the interesting aspects?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the good, the bad, and the ugly</p>
<p>of the origin story of the iPhone?</p>
<p>Again, this is a Netflix series</p>
<p>that spans multiple seasons.</p>
<p>Change my flight, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, what was the, what interesting memories</p>
<p>you have from the finding?</p>
<p>So the pain and the joy that was foundational</p>
<p>to the iPod, all the CDs you had to lug around.</p>
<p>What was the pain and the joy and the vision</p>
<p>of the iPhone in your mind, in the mind of the team,</p>
<p>in Steve&rsquo;s mind, and so on?</p>
<p>Well, you know, there&rsquo;s multiple pains.</p>
<p>You have to also look, there&rsquo;s not just customer pain,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s business pain, okay?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about the, so Apple now is getting out</p>
<p>of that place where it was in 2001.</p>
<p>Now people are starting to pay attention.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s starting to get in the culture again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming relevant.</p>
<p>Cash is starting to flow.</p>
<p>iPod is 60% of that, of the revenue,</p>
<p>total revenue of Apple doing an 85% market share.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to get a wind at your back.</p>
<p>You got confidence.</p>
<p>Like Apple had been beaten down since probably</p>
<p>the first time the Mac was, since the Mac,</p>
<p>it was a beaten company ever since the Mac.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re talking 15 years at that point, right?</p>
<p>This is the first time you&rsquo;re seeing like,</p>
<p>and Steve would proudly came in front of us and said,</p>
<p>today I can tell you all of the employees,</p>
<p>we are now out of debt.</p>
<p>We paid off our debt.</p>
<p>It was a joyous moment for him, right?</p>
<p>And then ultimately for our team</p>
<p>because no more debt, wonderful, right?</p>
<p>So now what you have is you have this successful thing</p>
<p>changing the face of Apple and you hear these</p>
<p>heavy stomping footsteps of the mobile phone industry.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the feature phones at that time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re adding cameras.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re adding color displays.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re seeing the success of the iPod and going,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just music, we have some storage.</p>
<p>We can load music on our phones</p>
<p>and we can do what the iPod does plus more.</p>
<p>Boom, boom, boom, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, and how many hundreds of millions</p>
<p>of them are being sold at that point?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t billions yet, but it was still,</p>
<p>a hundred million, 200 million a year.</p>
<p>iPod hadn&rsquo;t gotten there.</p>
<p>It was for 20, 40, 50 million, something like that.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re like, okay,</p>
<p>what are we gonna do about this Goliath</p>
<p>who wants to take our lunch, right?</p>
<p>The schoolyard bully.</p>
<p>And so there was one, let&rsquo;s partner with them.</p>
<p>So iTunes music store was there.</p>
<p>All of these phones are gonna need music</p>
<p>so they can come to the iTunes music store</p>
<p>and get that music for those phones</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t just about the hardware player</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>It was about the software that you need on the desktop</p>
<p>and the content that you needed to download.</p>
<p>So now Apple had multiple legs of the stool</p>
<p>as Steve would always refer to it.</p>
<p>So now the mobile phone industry,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re gonna work with them.</p>
<p>They are going to make an iPod shuffle basically</p>
<p>inside of a phone, can have 99 songs total.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna come to our store and you&rsquo;re gonna,</p>
<p>I was like, okay, great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all gonna be well and good.</p>
<p>And that became the Motorola rocker project.</p>
<p>It was Apple and Motorola getting together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be software on this smartphone</p>
<p>or not smartphone, but feature phone</p>
<p>to hook to iTunes to get your music.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even downloadable over a cloud or anything</p>
<p>because that wasn&rsquo;t available yet.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t data networks yet.</p>
<p>It was a disaster from the beginning.</p>
<p>Two different cultures,</p>
<p>two different types of leadership styles,</p>
<p>not necessarily the most competent engineers</p>
<p>on the other side.</p>
<p>And it turned out to be an absolute horrible disaster.</p>
<p>I watched the pains,</p>
<p>cause luckily I didn&rsquo;t have to be part of it.</p>
<p>I watched the pains on Jeff Robbins face</p>
<p>each time we would meet.</p>
<p>And he would be like, these guys are just like, really?</p>
<p>Do we have to do this, Steve?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re contractually obligated.</p>
<p>And when it came out on stage and Steve showed it,</p>
<p>it was maybe a one minute,</p>
<p>Steve loves those extended, like drawn up.</p>
<p>It might&rsquo;ve been a one minute, two minute kind of thing.</p>
<p>And he literally threw that phone out of his hand</p>
<p>as fast as he could, right?</p>
<p>Cause it was horrible.</p>
<p>So there was the pain of we&rsquo;re not gonna partner.</p>
<p>So if we can&rsquo;t partner with these guys,</p>
<p>we have to become one of them to actually compete,</p>
<p>to save the thing that is bringing Apple</p>
<p>from that 15 years of malaise, right?</p>
<p>So then from that, we were made a prototype</p>
<p>of an iPod plus phone, a classic with it was an iPod,</p>
<p>but it had a phone inside with all the music</p>
<p>and all the other stuff.</p>
<p>And you use your headset,</p>
<p>wired headset to do the audio, right?</p>
<p>There was another project at the same time</p>
<p>cause we were doing videos in the iTunes music store,</p>
<p>iTunes video store for music videos and movies.</p>
<p>And it would be a full screen iPod.</p>
<p>So instead of the classic, the way you know it,</p>
<p>but it would be full screen</p>
<p>and it would have a virtual click wheel.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have a virtual, like single touch touchscreen</p>
<p>that you could scroll, right?</p>
<p>Think of maybe an iPhone, like you knew it, right?</p>
<p>And then there was a third project going on,</p>
<p>not in, those two were going on in my team,</p>
<p>but the third project going on</p>
<p>was the multi touchscreen technology</p>
<p>to drive a Mac tablet.</p>
<p>And so that Mac tablet, that touchscreen technology,</p>
<p>there was just way too much you had to change</p>
<p>on the software and everything</p>
<p>to be able to use a tablet, right?</p>
<p>We see this all the time.</p>
<p>Like people are like, there&rsquo;s not enough tablet apps today</p>
<p>that are modified for tablet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just phone apps that are grown up, right?</p>
<p>So then they would just be Mac touch stuff.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have to have a whole developer community.</p>
<p>That probably wasn&rsquo;t the best place</p>
<p>to take that technology first.</p>
<p>So you take that technology,</p>
<p>marry it with the full screen,</p>
<p>that technology, marry it with the full screen iPod</p>
<p>and the phone stuff we were working</p>
<p>because the iPod phone with a rotary dial</p>
<p>was just like a rotary phone.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t make that interface work well for data input.</p>
<p>You put those three together.</p>
<p>And now is where those three things</p>
<p>that then created the form or the technology</p>
<p>and the form inside what would become the iPhone,</p>
<p>married with a bunch of low level software</p>
<p>from the iPod and manufacturing software</p>
<p>and drivers and communication stuff,</p>
<p>combined with a very reduced Frankenstein Mac OS.</p>
<p>And I mean that in the best way.</p>
<p>It means it wasn&rsquo;t Mac OS just changed a little.</p>
<p>It was totally, things were hacked out and changed</p>
<p>and new code was inserted.</p>
<p>And it really was a whole set of things</p>
<p>from all different places to make that first iPhone OS.</p>
<p>And then there was another team working on the apps</p>
<p>and then another team working on the design</p>
<p>of how it looked overall between all that stuff.</p>
<p>So all of those things came together</p>
<p>to create what we know as the first generation iPhone.</p>
<p>And those are all probably fascinating</p>
<p>engineering challenges.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And great teams like creating the Frankenstein OS.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating because you&rsquo;re simplifying and simplifying</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re just pulling different stuff from,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re basically inventing,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re probably not thinking of it that way,</p>
<p>but a new era of computing, a new kind of computer.</p>
<p>It really is Frankenstein.</p>
<p>Right, and you didn&rsquo;t have to run Mac software.</p>
<p>If you look at some of the other smartphones of the time,</p>
<p>like Windows and stuff, they were like,</p>
<p>we need to make sure it runs Excel</p>
<p>and it runs Word or something like that</p>
<p>in some reduced thing.</p>
<p>This was like, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>This was born out of entertainment.</p>
<p>So we didn&rsquo;t have to go and take all the same application,</p>
<p>you know, all those other ones was about compatibility.</p>
<p>This was about a whole new way of being.</p>
<p>What did you think about the Steve Jobs presentation</p>
<p>of the iPhone, the sort of, the first iPhone, you know.</p>
<p>Phone, internet communicator, and the iPod in your pocket.</p>
<p>Yeah, that you&rsquo;re going to sort of present,</p>
<p>announcing three new products kind of thing</p>
<p>and then saying that it&rsquo;s all in one.</p>
<p>Just, this is a good example,</p>
<p>one of the sort of historic presentations of a product.</p>
<p>Clearly there&rsquo;s like some showmanship that works,</p>
<p>some reason it works.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always work, it often doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>but it did in this case, it often did for Steve.</p>
<p>What, like, how did that feel?</p>
<p>What part of the actually the design process</p>
<p>was that presentation?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>In the early, because you said,</p>
<p>should consider the why, the press release</p>
<p>at the very beginning.</p>
<p>Steve was doing that the entire time.</p>
<p>He was working on that story from day one.</p>
<p>He was pitching us this, this, this, and then this.</p>
<p>And then he would look at our faces</p>
<p>because you wouldn&rsquo;t, most people wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>at least if you&rsquo;re working for him,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t tell him what you really thought</p>
<p>of what he was saying, but he would look at your faces.</p>
<p>And then he would talk to a few real trusted confidence</p>
<p>outside of the organization.</p>
<p>And see what they thought, right?</p>
<p>And they could give him feedback on it</p>
<p>and they could really challenge him,</p>
<p>but he would also look at their faces and go, hmm.</p>
<p>And so when you see that, hmm,</p>
<p>then he would modulate it and change it slightly</p>
<p>and change it.</p>
<p>So he was working during all of that time</p>
<p>on the story and the storytelling, right?</p>
<p>And the whys, while we&rsquo;re working on that</p>
<p>and helping us refine it,</p>
<p>just like the switch from plastic to glass, right?</p>
<p>All the time working on that.</p>
<p>So when he comes out on stage,</p>
<p>he does something that every marketer is told not to do.</p>
<p>Say these three things are now combined in one.</p>
<p>That is like the, they say that that is the laziest form</p>
<p>of storytelling possible for marketing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Right?</p>
<p>But it was the best one because it was all those pains.</p>
<p>It was like, I want my iPod, but I want my communications</p>
<p>and I want my internet browsing because I want it on the go</p>
<p>so I can look up things because it was information.</p>
<p>And when you were on the road, you had a laptop,</p>
<p>you had an iPod and you had a phone that,</p>
<p>and you had to carry all of these things with you at once.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna solve that pain for you</p>
<p>and put it all together.</p>
<p>So he was just showing you the pain</p>
<p>and beating that virus of doubt and going,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now in this one magical thing.</p>
<p>And he could come up and masterfully tell that story</p>
<p>because he told it almost every day</p>
<p>to all of these people inside very quietly.</p>
<p>And then it was just, right?</p>
<p>It was like a Tony award winning play</p>
<p>that had been worked on for 10 years.</p>
<p>But also the human came through, the timing.</p>
<p>It was all that, it was all of it.</p>
<p>And of course he was dramatic at certain points</p>
<p>and he would raise his voice and a wry smile</p>
<p>or whatever it was.</p>
<p>Right, that wry smile was magic.</p>
<p>It was all those touches.</p>
<p>He was an actor as well as a storyteller.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it was the truth, right?</p>
<p>The truth came through.</p>
<p>It was a nonfiction story.</p>
<p>And then he added those personal flourishes on top of it</p>
<p>for dramatic effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a designer you mentioned, Johnny Ave.</p>
<p>You both are brilliant designers, great human beings.</p>
<p>There were some battles fought in the distant past</p>
<p>between the two of you.</p>
<p>Looking back, what is the positive characteristics</p>
<p>of Johnny that made you a better person and designer</p>
<p>having worked with him?</p>
<p>Watching the process that the design team that Johnny led.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where, cause that was over years.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see all of those things.</p>
<p>But watching the design process of really,</p>
<p>cause it was really a team that was about materials.</p>
<p>It was about form.</p>
<p>It was about colors.</p>
<p>It was about these physical characteristics.</p>
<p>When we talked about this earlier was design.</p>
<p>What is design?</p>
<p>Design&rsquo;s everywhere, okay?</p>
<p>So what they were really focused on was form,</p>
<p>how the feel was, how it looked, the aesthetics,</p>
<p>the physical aesthetics.</p>
<p>And watching, going through that process,</p>
<p>I learned so much in that process about how to do colors,</p>
<p>how to do materials, how to think deeply about curves,</p>
<p>and shadows, and how it would look, not just in your hand,</p>
<p>but how it would look in the photograph</p>
<p>you were gonna take for marketing, right?</p>
<p>So how it would look, how you would feel, all of it.</p>
<p>It was all of those physical things around that</p>
<p>and watching the process to get there,</p>
<p>that was enlightening for me, right?</p>
<p>It opened my mind to go, oh, okay.</p>
<p>Just like there&rsquo;s a process for all these other things,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t just magic and you say,</p>
<p>ha, ha, ha, there it is.</p>
<p>It was really a process of refinement,</p>
<p>you know, of opening the funnel at the beginning</p>
<p>and refining down over time to get to that final,</p>
<p>the final and selecting and doing the selection.</p>
<p>And certain types you could,</p>
<p>certain times there were opinion based design details.</p>
<p>But a lot of data, a lot of data driven designs</p>
<p>of what can we deliver in volume?</p>
<p>What can we do different things?</p>
<p>So you always had these constraints</p>
<p>that you had to work with under.</p>
<p>And sometimes they, and the team,</p>
<p>not just I, would say, we need this.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, we can&rsquo;t deliver that.</p>
<p>But maybe we were able to work together</p>
<p>to find different design characteristics</p>
<p>and different implementation characteristics</p>
<p>that could get to that point</p>
<p>without what they were describing.</p>
<p>And instead of yes, yes, yes, no, no, no,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s find some other way to solve the problem together.</p>
<p>Yeah, is, and I&rsquo;ve seen this in several companies</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve more closely interacted with, like Tesla is an example.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you know, talking about curves,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s very painful on the engineering side</p>
<p>to deliver a very specific kind of thing.</p>
<p>And one question that comes up in my mind is like,</p>
<p>well, how far should we go to try to deliver</p>
<p>a tiny adjustment in a curve, in the curvature,</p>
<p>or in like whatever the form factor is,</p>
<p>or the color of the material,</p>
<p>when the cost is like 10X to deliver,</p>
<p>not financially, but just like in effort,</p>
<p>like how many problems to have to solve.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can say any wisdom to that,</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re thinking about curves,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re designing in the space of ideas,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like platonic forms kind of thing,</p>
<p>not always grounded to like how much this is,</p>
<p>how much pain is gonna be involved in delivering this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s as you should perhaps,</p>
<p>because then if you&rsquo;re always thinking about the pain</p>
<p>required to deliver this thing, you&rsquo;ll be too conservative,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t do the wild ideas.</p>
<p>Right, exactly, but you have to understand again</p>
<p>the why behind it.</p>
<p>And at Nest, when we had limited resources,</p>
<p>you know, putting a screwdriver in the box,</p>
<p>a custom designed screwdriver in the box,</p>
<p>was born out of those experiences I had at Apple,</p>
<p>and seeing how you can create something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s emotional, it&rsquo;s part of marketing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s part of the product experience overall,</p>
<p>even though it seems extraneous.</p>
<p>I went back and made the design team,</p>
<p>and the mechanical team change some curves</p>
<p>on the Nest Protect, the smoke and CO detector</p>
<p>we did at Nest, after they had already tooled it.</p>
<p>And I said, they&rsquo;re saying these cost more,</p>
<p>I said, it doesn&rsquo;t look right.</p>
<p>There is a, but they&rsquo;re like, oh, well we had,</p>
<p>I said, no, you&rsquo;re gonna go back,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna make that change,</p>
<p>I told you we needed to do it,</p>
<p>we had a better looking model, that is gonna get done,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s gonna be a terrible cost to you,</p>
<p>but we already had this discussion,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s gonna have to be,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sorry, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>And you know, because it&rsquo;s better for the customer,</p>
<p>and it looks better in the pictures,</p>
<p>and all the other stuff.</p>
<p>And then we did it, and it was great,</p>
<p>and everyone agreed it was great at the end,</p>
<p>but it was pain to get there.</p>
<p>Those are where, those little details</p>
<p>are where the magic comes out, right?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t do, if you don&rsquo;t take those pains</p>
<p>and put in the love, the customer&rsquo;s gonna feel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna, they&rsquo;re either gonna feel the pain,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re gonna feel the love,</p>
<p>if you put it in, right?</p>
<p>So it depends on how much time and effort</p>
<p>you wanna put into something,</p>
<p>and what really matters to you,</p>
<p>and so how you communicate what you do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re human beings after all,</p>
<p>is there something you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>from sort of the tensions that are natural,</p>
<p>or that happen in teams when they&rsquo;re passionate,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re trying to solve these problems?</p>
<p>Is that the way of life?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the human drama.</p>
<p>Is that just, is that always going,</p>
<p>is that, it is what it is?</p>
<p>Is that make you better?</p>
<p>Actually, the drama, the tension between personalities,</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Look, a rollercoaster ride without ups and downs</p>
<p>is no fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the journey, it&rsquo;s the journey that brings,</p>
<p>it brings out the best in everyone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re forged, we&rsquo;re tempered by those experiences,</p>
<p>not all the ups, but also the downs,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you get the humanity and the connection,</p>
<p>and we can tell these stories till we&rsquo;re blue in the face,</p>
<p>and smile every time, because we did something together</p>
<p>that each of us couldn&rsquo;t do apart,</p>
<p>but when it comes together,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where all the emotions happen,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where, if it&rsquo;s born out of the right reasons,</p>
<p>and the right story, and the right way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the magic happens,</p>
<p>not just for the customer,</p>
<p>but for how it transforms each person</p>
<p>who is working on it,</p>
<p>and they will never forget those experiences in their life,</p>
<p>positively and negatively, that happened at the time,</p>
<p>but they look back, and it&rsquo;s only positive,</p>
<p>because they did something that mattered.</p>
<p>Yet another brilliant idea that you brought to life</p>
<p>is Nest, Nest thermostats, and the big umbrella of Nest.</p>
<p>Again, as part of this Netflix series, season three,</p>
<p>what was the most memorable, the most painful,</p>
<p>the most insight leading challenge</p>
<p>you had to overcome to bring Nest to life?</p>
<p>Well, the first thing for me was making someone care</p>
<p>about their thermostat.</p>
<p>No one considers it.</p>
<p>They never had any customer choice.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t install it.</p>
<p>They usually don&rsquo;t even use it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so complicated, or what have you,</p>
<p>they just, they bitch at it, they hide it in the corner,</p>
<p>and then they just pay the bill, right,</p>
<p>of whatever it is, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally unloved, unconsidered, right?</p>
<p>So how do you wake up, like I said, the virus of doubt,</p>
<p>how do you wake that up and get people going,</p>
<p>remember every day when you go in and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just frustrated, and then you get the bill</p>
<p>and you pay the bill, so you have to do that.</p>
<p>So that was one thing.</p>
<p>I think the other big one was not delivering,</p>
<p>all of it was hard, right?</p>
<p>It was constrained, we had only so much stuff,</p>
<p>we were bootstrapped, we didn&rsquo;t have massive funding,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t get hundreds of millions of dollars,</p>
<p>but we did it for the right reasons.</p>
<p>But I think the other big part of it was</p>
<p>not just building a disruptive product,</p>
<p>because a lot of the people on the team had done that,</p>
<p>we knew what we were doing, and that was,</p>
<p>if we got the design right, we could deliver it</p>
<p>with enough time.</p>
<p>It was getting the disruptive go to market,</p>
<p>in other words, how to take that product</p>
<p>from the end of the production line</p>
<p>and get it into the customer&rsquo;s hands,</p>
<p>because there was no retail or customer choice</p>
<p>in thermostats.</p>
<p>No one even, it was never considered purchase.</p>
<p>They never thought they had choice.</p>
<p>Some guy, usually in suspenders and a butt crack,</p>
<p>told them, looked around, looked at their house</p>
<p>and said, this looks like somebody who&rsquo;s got,</p>
<p>is well to do.</p>
<p>This thermostat is now gonna cost you $350,</p>
<p>thank you very much.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;ll take whatever you give me, right?</p>
<p>And then it goes into another house,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth $100, it was the same damn thing, right?</p>
<p>So there was no price transparency,</p>
<p>there was no choice, you just got what you were given.</p>
<p>So how do you go, and this was an entrenched industry,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why there was no innovation in it,</p>
<p>because it was doing just fine</p>
<p>because every house needed them.</p>
<p>All the installers were programmed by the product deliverers,</p>
<p>by bonuses to say, you&rsquo;re gonna only carry our product,</p>
<p>and if you sell this many,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get a free trip to Hawaii, right?</p>
<p>And for these guys who install,</p>
<p>I get a free trip to Hawaii, that&rsquo;s dream for them, right?</p>
<p>So this whole channel was fully controlled</p>
<p>by the product guys,</p>
<p>and it was almost monopolistic in a way.</p>
<p>So how do you go around that?</p>
<p>So creating a disruptive go to market channel,</p>
<p>one was direct to consumer, right?</p>
<p>And all the marketing that was necessary</p>
<p>to get that message across.</p>
<p>Another one was getting the installation right.</p>
<p>No one was self installing thermostats.</p>
<p>So how do we get enough people who are early adopters</p>
<p>to be able to self install them confidently?</p>
<p>So they didn&rsquo;t still have to call the guy</p>
<p>to come and install it,</p>
<p>because then he would say, this is a crap product.</p>
<p>No, I got the most better product, right?</p>
<p>So you had to get rid of that friction.</p>
<p>And then ultimately, how do you get the people</p>
<p>who were not just early adopters,</p>
<p>but people who needed to see it</p>
<p>and touch it before they bought it?</p>
<p>How do you get that into retail</p>
<p>when the large brands of the time of thermostats</p>
<p>and Home Depot and Lowe&rsquo;s had contracts</p>
<p>that they couldn&rsquo;t bring in any other brands?</p>
<p>They were owning the channel all the way</p>
<p>to where there was any sort of slight customer choice.</p>
<p>And it was really contractor choice</p>
<p>more than it was in consumer choice.</p>
<p>So all of that had to be innovated along with the product.</p>
<p>And so to me, that was a huge challenge</p>
<p>and something I had never done,</p>
<p>most of us had never done.</p>
<p>And we had to create, that was as much as a project</p>
<p>as actually delivering the product itself.</p>
<p>So it turned out to be a giant hit.</p>
<p>And it was acquired by Google for $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>$3.2 billion.</p>
<p>As a founder and leader, just out of curiosity,</p>
<p>in these cases of acquisition, is it always a good thing?</p>
<p>Is there any part of you and the team</p>
<p>that considered saying no?</p>
<p>Oh, we considered saying no</p>
<p>all the way along the process, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d all been in big companies before.</p>
<p>We knew what it was like and the politics</p>
<p>and all the other stuff and what I came to learn,</p>
<p>especially from Phillips,</p>
<p>because Phillips was a very, it was 375,000 people.</p>
<p>It was a big, it was massive company, right?</p>
<p>And tons of politics.</p>
<p>And I was like, do we wanna go back into that world?</p>
<p>Because I had so many negative experiences from that.</p>
<p>But then going to Apple, which was not big,</p>
<p>but it was big enough that it could have all these dynamics.</p>
<p>But then when you saw a leader rise up</p>
<p>and get rid of those dynamics or not,</p>
<p>allow many of them to flourish,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re like, oh, with the right leadership,</p>
<p>this can be a beautiful marriage, right?</p>
<p>And so for four months, we were working together with them,</p>
<p>with Google, to make sure that we had the right leadership</p>
<p>and we were gonna be in the right environment</p>
<p>that it felt right.</p>
<p>So that happened.</p>
<p>It absolutely happened.</p>
<p>We worked on all the details.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even talk about price.</p>
<p>We were talking about how&rsquo;s the brand gonna work?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the team gonna work with?</p>
<p>How are we gonna get IP?</p>
<p>How are we gonna do exchanges?</p>
<p>How are we gonna get budgets and all that stuff done?</p>
<p>So we worked through all of that</p>
<p>before we actually sealed any kind of deal</p>
<p>because they were already an investor in the company.</p>
<p>So we already knew,</p>
<p>they knew relatively where the end point was for the price.</p>
<p>So working through all of those prerequisites,</p>
<p>I knew that as a individual product company</p>
<p>that was trying to create a platform,</p>
<p>no investors were gonna invest in a platform</p>
<p>that could take three, four years</p>
<p>and many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to build</p>
<p>without all kinds of new products at the same time.</p>
<p>And products that we were having, which were successes,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t even break even yet, right?</p>
<p>We were still developing them.</p>
<p>So how are we gonna get more people to fund</p>
<p>all of these things and this platform</p>
<p>that I really wanna create?</p>
<p>Because my worry, and I had seen this many times</p>
<p>in Silicon Valley, is these small startups have bravado</p>
<p>and they said, I&rsquo;m gonna take on the big guys, right?</p>
<p>With a platform.</p>
<p>But when those platform guys show up</p>
<p>and Apple says they&rsquo;re gonna get in the,</p>
<p>at the time, nobody cared.</p>
<p>They were curious, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>But Apple wasn&rsquo;t in the market,</p>
<p>Google wasn&rsquo;t in the market yet,</p>
<p>Amazon wasn&rsquo;t there, Microsoft, Samsung,</p>
<p>they were all just, that&rsquo;s curious, right?</p>
<p>And I had watched, if you said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go challenge them</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna build a platform,</p>
<p>and then they all of a sudden one by one go,</p>
<p>oh, well, we&rsquo;re building a platform now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re building a platform.</p>
<p>They flooded you to death, fear, uncertainty, doubt,</p>
<p>and the developers run away</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t make that platform.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, before the landscape gets changed on us,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve tracked so much attention,</p>
<p>they announced something,</p>
<p>we need to change the landscape on them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the best place</p>
<p>where we can build out the platform,</p>
<p>have the right leadership behind us</p>
<p>to help us grow this thing into what the vision it should be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we believed we were doing</p>
<p>with the Google acquisition.</p>
<p>Is it possible to take on the platforms?</p>
<p>So you said there&rsquo;s a lot of startups</p>
<p>with bravado and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean, James Joyce, when he was 20,</p>
<p>he said, I&rsquo;m gonna be the greatest writer</p>
<p>of the 20th century before he wrote anything of value.</p>
<p>One of them might be actually right.</p>
<p>Yeah, in this modern world,</p>
<p>when you, so first of all, people should definitely</p>
<p>get your book built as just this giant number of advice</p>
<p>on this exact question of how to build cool things,</p>
<p>how to build a startup,</p>
<p>how to all the different stages of that team and hiring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly human nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not technical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly human nature behind it.</p>
<p>And it turns out it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>turtles all the way down this human at the bottom.</p>
<p>Yes, so is it possible to build startups</p>
<p>that take on the big guys,</p>
<p>whatever that is of the modern era?</p>
<p>So for now, it&rsquo;s these platforms of Apple, Google, Twitter,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know, Meta I guess called now.</p>
<p>Is it possible to take them on?</p>
<p>Absolutely, but you don&rsquo;t take them on on their same turf.</p>
<p>You take them on on the turf</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna want to have in the future, right?</p>
<p>Spotify is a platform.</p>
<p>It started as an application, is now a platform, right?</p>
<p>Think of WeChat.</p>
<p>Think of all the super apps out there</p>
<p>that are now wallets and delivery services</p>
<p>and travel services and transportation services</p>
<p>all within an app.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve innovated in a different level,</p>
<p>in a different space that the platform companies weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Google was an app company.</p>
<p>It was solving search.</p>
<p>And then it became a platform company.</p>
<p>Apple was solving personal computing.</p>
<p>And then iPhone was solving internet browsing,</p>
<p>all that stuff.</p>
<p>And then it became a platform company</p>
<p>when the app store was at it.</p>
<p>If you look at it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no such thing as building a platform company.</p>
<p>You build a great app first,</p>
<p>and then you can expand it</p>
<p>and have the right to become a platform.</p>
<p>Your whole book is just a bunch of advice for young people.</p>
<p>But let me ask.</p>
<p>And older people.</p>
<p>And old, well, everyone is young at heart.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not, you should be.</p>
<p>So what, in terms of picking a career,</p>
<p>you have advice on this point.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a person</p>
<p>on how to pick a career?</p>
<p>What is it you want to learn?</p>
<p>And who is it you want to learn from?</p>
<p>Just like you pick a university.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I wanna go here for this expertise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about these programs, especially graduate,</p>
<p>graduate studies, you go for a certain program</p>
<p>with a certain set of people.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you do that when it comes to a job?</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t go, or in a career,</p>
<p>you just don&rsquo;t go and say,</p>
<p>I just wanna go work at Google,</p>
<p>or I just wanna work at Apple.</p>
<p>You wanna go to a certain team</p>
<p>with a certain set of people</p>
<p>and work with them on something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really curious about</p>
<p>and you wanna learn about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such, I just wanted to comment that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s such a, it&rsquo;s a subtle but a brilliant framing</p>
<p>of just ask the question, what do I want to learn?</p>
<p>And then see what career path is going to maximize that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first question I ask anyone who interviews with me.</p>
<p>When I say I&rsquo;m gonna bring somebody on the team,</p>
<p>first question is, what do you wanna learn?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the expert, like we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>says, I&rsquo;m the expert in this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna hire me as the expert.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing something new.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not an expert,</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;re not an expert either.</p>
<p>What is it you wanna learn?</p>
<p>And on the topic of learning,</p>
<p>what is the best way to learn?</p>
<p>What, starting, you go into this new place,</p>
<p>into this new world, into maybe V1,</p>
<p>you said you&rsquo;re building V1.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole world is late, is full of V1s</p>
<p>or V0s waiting for the V1 to come along.</p>
<p>Zero to one.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process of that look like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process of learning?</p>
<p>How do you learn?</p>
<p>Well, let me put a framing</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll talk about that last piece.</p>
<p>I have now looking back, especially writing this book,</p>
<p>I have a version one of myself, a version two,</p>
<p>a version three, a version four.</p>
<p>I had a lot of opinions about myself</p>
<p>and what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes those opinions for certain people,</p>
<p>those opinions are formed</p>
<p>and they get the data from their parents</p>
<p>and they go do what their parents told them to do</p>
<p>or their surroundings.</p>
<p>My opinions was like, I wanna go and learn this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about that.</p>
<p>I made the zero to one move.</p>
<p>And then over time by doing,</p>
<p>I was refining those things</p>
<p>and learning what I was really curious about</p>
<p>and what I was really good about</p>
<p>because I was getting data.</p>
<p>And then I was like, then I had another set of opinions</p>
<p>to create version two of me.</p>
<p>And then I would go and do it.</p>
<p>So I was learning by doing,</p>
<p>starting with the opinion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get any facts.</p>
<p>Most people are like,</p>
<p>where do I make the most money for my position?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to start with data.</p>
<p>Start with the why, what&rsquo;s your curiosity?</p>
<p>What do you wanna learn?</p>
<p>And then follow that.</p>
<p>I took the lowest job on the totem pole at General Magic</p>
<p>because I wanted to get in there</p>
<p>to work with the right team.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know what they were doing, right?</p>
<p>But I thought that it felt right, right?</p>
<p>I was barely living above the poverty line working there,</p>
<p>working 80 hours a week</p>
<p>because it was so amazing to learn</p>
<p>just like a college student, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was doing.</p>
<p>And then I learned more from that</p>
<p>and then changed those opinions into data.</p>
<p>And then I found other opinions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same thing, but it was by doing, right?</p>
<p>The way you find out what you wanna do in life</p>
<p>is by figuring out what you don&rsquo;t wanna do.</p>
<p>And the only way you find that out</p>
<p>is by doing a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>Doing a bunch of stuff and refining it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So in terms of the career path</p>
<p>of leaping into the startup world and launching a startup,</p>
<p>what does it take to successfully found a startup,</p>
<p>to have a chance to succeed?</p>
<p>And maybe how do you decide to take that leap?</p>
<p>Is there sort of having founded,</p>
<p>having been part of many V1s,</p>
<p>many of some of the most successful V1s ever,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it take to take that leap?</p>
<p>Maybe leave your job, cushy job at a company</p>
<p>and do the startup.</p>
<p>What does it take?</p>
<p>It takes belief in yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>Belief that you can do it.</p>
<p>Not, but hopefully with mirrors or mentors around you</p>
<p>or coaches around you to make sure you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not crazy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crazy smart idea, but you&rsquo;re not crazy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just working on something</p>
<p>as like a lone mad man or woman.</p>
<p>You have a great idea.</p>
<p>And like I said, great ideas chase you.</p>
<p>In this world, there are so many people who have more ideas</p>
<p>than they have time to implement.</p>
<p>I used to be like that.</p>
<p>I would like, oh my God, if this idea, this idea,</p>
<p>and you try to do all of them,</p>
<p>but the best ideas are the ones that you can really focus on</p>
<p>and you shut out all those other things</p>
<p>and you bring them other ideas</p>
<p>into the thing you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>So I try to run away from a great idea</p>
<p>and then it stalks me.</p>
<p>It hunts you down because you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>ah, that&rsquo;s gonna have this problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put it aside.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, you know, a few days later,</p>
<p>oh, I think I know how to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Or I talk to somebody and you&rsquo;re just always kind of</p>
<p>niggling around the edges of it.</p>
<p>And then at some point it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it just becomes like this black hole</p>
<p>that just sucks you in and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think about anything else but this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a relationship in the world, right?</p>
<p>You know, when you have it with a, you find your partner.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re like, mm, mm, wait, mm, something.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re trying to like,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden it just,</p>
<p>it comes together, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like that.</p>
<p>Ultimately achieved focus.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m different.</p>
<p>I just dive right in.</p>
<p>I used to do that too.</p>
<p>I used to dive right in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I learned that you&rsquo;d need time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more effective to run away from it.</p>
<p>Run away from it.</p>
<p>And so it chases you because it makes you think harder</p>
<p>about that story.</p>
<p>This is not dating advice.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about stardom.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But ultimately, so you have achieved a focus on it.</p>
<p>But you also said to believe in yourself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily even the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the human that believe in the human being.</p>
<p>You have to believe in yourself and the idea that you have.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t have that belief,</p>
<p>then you can&rsquo;t project that to other people</p>
<p>to say, join the team.</p>
<p>Let me ask you on, because you mentioned mentors</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve talked about having had incredible mentors</p>
<p>in your life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also a mentor to a very large number of people.</p>
<p>What does it take to find a mentor?</p>
<p>How do you find a great mentor?</p>
<p>Usually they also find you.</p>
<p>Is it like with the ideas?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, what happens is you&rsquo;re in the right,</p>
<p>you have a community around you, okay?</p>
<p>And because you&rsquo;ve been building a network,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t do it alone.</p>
<p>So you have to create this network around you</p>
<p>of relationships, not transactions,</p>
<p>but relationships over time that you really cherish</p>
<p>and people you talk to, okay?</p>
<p>And you share vulnerable or nascent ideas with</p>
<p>or crazy opinions with, and then you argue them through.</p>
<p>But you start to see resonate, and it&rsquo;s not about age.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about this connection, right?</p>
<p>I have mentors.</p>
<p>Obviously when I was young, all my mentors were older.</p>
<p>And as I get older, I have mentors who are younger than me</p>
<p>or the same age, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not all just older, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s about that connection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about being on that same wavelength,</p>
<p>but they also, they can counterbalance you.</p>
<p>They compliment you in some way.</p>
<p>Like my best mentors had nothing to do with technology.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know anything about technology, right?</p>
<p>The way we know it.</p>
<p>They were all about human nature and they could reflect that</p>
<p>and help me get more human focused and more empathetic</p>
<p>because I was so detailed in the technology.</p>
<p>I needed to see from other perspectives,</p>
<p>but then they wanted to learn more about the technology,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Or they thought that this idea was so great</p>
<p>that it should exist.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s work together on that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really, they have to find you</p>
<p>and you have to find them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s by sharing.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t go and look it up on the internet</p>
<p>and say, who are the best mentors in the world?</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>So form a network of people and see where,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like finding relationships, finding love,</p>
<p>all that kind of friendship.</p>
<p>Human nature.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists, money.</p>
<p>Do VCs help or hurt a business in general?</p>
<p>So like in those early stages in the chase</p>
<p>of developing a V1, just what&rsquo;s the constructive</p>
<p>and destructive power of money</p>
<p>in the development of a brilliant idea</p>
<p>and the deployment of a brilliant idea?</p>
<p>I have seen brilliant venture capitalists.</p>
<p>I have seen horrible ones.</p>
<p>Ones that care about their LPs more</p>
<p>than they care about the entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone&rsquo;s in it, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>especially venture capital, they have to give a return</p>
<p>to their limited partners, the people who invest in money</p>
<p>that they have to shepherd that money</p>
<p>and make sure it&rsquo;s watched over properly.</p>
<p>But when there&rsquo;s not a balance, a pushback</p>
<p>in a venture capitalist between what the LPs</p>
<p>needs and what the entrepreneur needs,</p>
<p>and that the entrepreneur might be trying really hard,</p>
<p>but if they don&rsquo;t see, the VC doesn&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>the exit&rsquo;s gonna happen in two years</p>
<p>and they just leave them hanging,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s no, the value exchange is only money</p>
<p>and not mentorship or ideas or other things,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s not a relationship, but really a transaction,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when money is toxic.</p>
<p>Because you can get money everywhere.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a little harder today,</p>
<p>over the last month, but you can still find people</p>
<p>with money who are on that, who wanna enable your mission</p>
<p>and can be mentors, not always, not all of them,</p>
<p>but some of them can be mentors, but they&rsquo;re on your side,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s incredibly powerful</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just one plus one equals two, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something bigger than that</p>
<p>because then they can bring their networks of people</p>
<p>and their networks of companies</p>
<p>and other people they worked with</p>
<p>that might wanna join your mission, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of venture capitalist</p>
<p>and smart money that&rsquo;s out there, right?</p>
<p>But you have to build a relationship.</p>
<p>People go, oh, look at that valuation.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s the brand name of the VC that&rsquo;s investing me.</p>
<p>No, it boils down to who&rsquo;s that partner</p>
<p>and how experienced are they?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just give me the brand, give me the person</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the person I&rsquo;m gonna be interacting with.</p>
<p>I have to, there&rsquo;s a million questions I wanna ask you,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re on season five already.</p>
<p>But let me ask you, it seems like</p>
<p>out of all the brilliant things you write about,</p>
<p>it seems like not an important question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a fascinating one to me as lawyers.</p>
<p>You write about this.</p>
<p>So does the company need lawyers and why?</p>
<p>And what kind?</p>
<p>So you write about sort of the value of this game, I guess.</p>
<p>Right, the legal game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Why do we need lawyers?</p>
<p>You sound exasperated by lawyers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a good question, I guess.</p>
<p>Well, because&hellip;</p>
<p>The why of lawyers is what you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>The why of lawyers, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Okay, the why of lawyers.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You even do the question.</p>
<p>We just have to put why in front of everything you ask</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll be there.</p>
<p>Lawyers, why, why?</p>
<p>Even mafiosos had lawyers.</p>
<p>Okay, you know, Tony Soprano, you know, Scarface,</p>
<p>all of them had lawyers, right?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because there are things in this world</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t always consider in the government,</p>
<p>in laws, in competitors,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so focused on what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>they have to watch out for you, right?</p>
<p>Now, the best kind of lawyers are the ones</p>
<p>who try to work with you to enable what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and see gray areas.</p>
<p>Law is not black or white, it&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s interpreted, right?</p>
<p>And so they can help interpret things a certain way</p>
<p>or help push on things a certain way</p>
<p>to get change to happen or allow change to happen.</p>
<p>Because if you have lawyers who are always,</p>
<p>just like you were talking about PR people,</p>
<p>if you have lawyers who are always saying no to everything,</p>
<p>because their job is to really say no or maybe,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll never say yes.</p>
<p>And you also say their job is to say no</p>
<p>and bill you by the hour.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Depressing.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t wanna know, don&rsquo;t ask them,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna get a no,</p>
<p>maybe a maybe.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll get charged for it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll get charged for it anyways, right?</p>
<p>So to have a partner, to have them on your team,</p>
<p>to help you see maybe some of the things you don&rsquo;t see,</p>
<p>some consequences, they help to rein that in</p>
<p>or change your language.</p>
<p>Like, are you gonna get sued for this ad?</p>
<p>Just change this one word and it helps.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So you need to have a partner.</p>
<p>Most of the times, especially engineers or designers,</p>
<p>they see lawyers as only stifling.</p>
<p>Lawyers can actually, if you do it right</p>
<p>and you have the right type,</p>
<p>they can actually open up a whole new world for you</p>
<p>because of the interpretation</p>
<p>and how we go about doing things.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And they help you not get bogged down</p>
<p>in the pain of little mistakes that didn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p>
<p>Exactly, you shot yourself in the foot</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t even know it.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t even know you were carrying the gun.</p>
<p>Just to jump around, Charles Bukowski once wrote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Find what you love and let it kill you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the question is about work life balance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like finding an idea and let it chase you.</p>
<p>Yes, but a little more aggressive.</p>
<p>So what does work life balance look like</p>
<p>that maximizes success and or happiness?</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as work life balance?</p>
<p>Is, can you speak to this?</p>
<p>When your work is your life,</p>
<p>and I mean that in the positive sense.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on a mission that really matters</p>
<p>and you know that you can really affect,</p>
<p>not just yourself, but other people&rsquo;s lives,</p>
<p>and then that is very rewarding, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, like I said, a mission, right?</p>
<p>You adopt that.</p>
<p>But that said, you still need to have boundaries yourself.</p>
<p>At General Magic, wonderful documentary,</p>
<p>if no one&rsquo;s seen it, you gotta see that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I was physically and mentally unhealthy,</p>
<p>socially unhealthy as well,</p>
<p>because I put every waking minute into this thing,</p>
<p>every ounce of me into it.</p>
<p>And when it was a spectacular disaster,</p>
<p>we were making the iPhone 15 years too early,</p>
<p>the bottom fell out.</p>
<p>I had nothing left.</p>
<p>I had to get healthy socially, emotionally, physically</p>
<p>after that, that trauma.</p>
<p>I let everything go.</p>
<p>I learned from that that you have to,</p>
<p>even though you might put everything into your work,</p>
<p>you need to find balance outside of it.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re always,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s three days a week working</p>
<p>and four days a week or whatever it was.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still working as hard as ever,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re making sure</p>
<p>when your thinking time is during work,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not ruminating at three in the morning.</p>
<p>You use the tools that you have to put those ideas</p>
<p>into databases or on pages or somewhere else</p>
<p>so you can go back and look at them.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not always having to remember,</p>
<p>because what happens is most people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t write this stuff down.</p>
<p>So they just sit here and got to remember this,</p>
<p>I got to remember this, I got to remember this.</p>
<p>If you just put it into the tools</p>
<p>and you can come back to it, you can come back fresh.</p>
<p>A lot of the time is about ruminating</p>
<p>about what I need to get done and remembering everything</p>
<p>instead of doing the work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So if you just put it down on paper,</p>
<p>you can actually escape it.</p>
<p>Escape it for a time, to have peace for a time.</p>
<p>You mentioned General Magic.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the Russian question.</p>
<p>The Russian question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been the darkest moments of your life?</p>
<p>Where are some of the darkest places</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got in your mind?</p>
<p>You talked about if you&rsquo;re doing these kinds of things</p>
<p>with startups, you&rsquo;re gonna have to face a crisis.</p>
<p>Right, absolutely.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing it right, you&rsquo;re gonna face it.</p>
<p>So for you personally, where were some</p>
<p>of the tougher moments in your life?</p>
<p>Growing up, I went to 12 schools in 15 years.</p>
<p>I was always the new kid.</p>
<p>Put yourself in those shoes, right?</p>
<p>You picked on, what were you picked on?</p>
<p>Well, absolutely, but even more so,</p>
<p>I was the geek with the computer.</p>
<p>Remember the nerds in the 80s?</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t know this, but believe me,</p>
<p>we were made fun of.</p>
<p>What were these computers?</p>
<p>What were these things?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re off in a cold.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all off partying or going, whatever it was,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sitting there like,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, this guy is just this alien, right?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s this new guy who just showed up and,</p>
<p>and then you would ask the smart questions</p>
<p>and you couldn&rsquo;t be the smartest in the,</p>
<p>because then you get picked on too.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re the new kid.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in this environment that&rsquo;s ever changing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t fit in and you are just asking questions</p>
<p>because you think they&rsquo;re the right questions to answer,</p>
<p>but then they like, you&rsquo;re making us look bad.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask these smart questions</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna make us do more work.</p>
<p>So right there, it&rsquo;s pretty tough.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m moving cities, right?</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have the internet</p>
<p>to stay connected to people.</p>
<p>There was no internet.</p>
<p>Phone calls were $2 a minute.</p>
<p>So it was lonely too.</p>
<p>It was lonely, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I was a latchkey kid, right?</p>
<p>I had my brother, but he was a skateboarder</p>
<p>and he had a different social way of working.</p>
<p>He loved to do that stuff and be outside.</p>
<p>I loved the computer.</p>
<p>So even in the computer, you were alone in the family.</p>
<p>With the computer in the family, you were alone.</p>
<p>I was absolutely alone.</p>
<p>That was just me.</p>
<p>But then, then you could find the other geeks, right?</p>
<p>But there were just a few of us</p>
<p>and we made this little thing.</p>
<p>But then when you moved away,</p>
<p>you know, then I had to use a BBS</p>
<p>and a bulletin board system and a dial up modem.</p>
<p>And then I started hacking the phone system</p>
<p>to get free codes on MCI and Sprint back in the day</p>
<p>to get long distance, to get free codes to call my friends,</p>
<p>the geeks on the other side, right?</p>
<p>Or to dial into a BBS cheaply</p>
<p>that was in another part of the world.</p>
<p>So this was this subculture</p>
<p>and that was not accepted in any way.</p>
<p>And not the heroes that you see today</p>
<p>that are on the richest people in the world and everything.</p>
<p>So that was the first set of trauma.</p>
<p>And then the next one really was general magic.</p>
<p>You know, the end of that, like I described before.</p>
<p>And pulling yourself out and going just,</p>
<p>cause I got so insular in that world</p>
<p>of geeking out and building stuff</p>
<p>that I just tore all the social ties, right?</p>
<p>Because it was just, it was a drug.</p>
<p>I was hooked on that.</p>
<p>I was a junkie.</p>
<p>I had to get clean.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that made you who you are.</p>
<p>Tempered, tempered.</p>
<p>So Steve Jobs is no longer with us.</p>
<p>One day you also will no longer be with us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing about this life, it ends.</p>
<p>So no matter how many incredible things</p>
<p>you brought to this world,</p>
<p>no matter how many inventions you built,</p>
<p>you too shall perish.</p>
<p>Do you think about this?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of your death?</p>
<p>I am not afraid of my death.</p>
<p>I am an atheist.</p>
<p>And I think about the soul.</p>
<p>Because I do, even though I&rsquo;m an atheist,</p>
<p>I think about the soul.</p>
<p>And the soul is the thing that you instill in others</p>
<p>when you go that lives on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not this thing that&rsquo;s magically in space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that you&rsquo;ve imparted onto people</p>
<p>that you worked with and those relationships you&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>And that soul lives on in the stories that they tell, right?</p>
<p>And through Build, I&rsquo;m hopeful that those stories</p>
<p>stay relevant because they&rsquo;re human nature.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not about who knows what the next iPhone thing is</p>
<p>or the next iPod thing is.</p>
<p>The stuff that I have been able, the privilege to make</p>
<p>and work with people, those are all ephemeral.</p>
<p>The iPod&rsquo;s gone now, right?</p>
<p>This week, it was announced iPod&rsquo;s dead after 21 years.</p>
<p>It is those human connections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that growth that you&rsquo;ve helped someone</p>
<p>just like they helped me.</p>
<p>Just like Bill Campbell or Steve Jobs is gone,</p>
<p>but they made me be better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the soul that I believe in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating that you say that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so many of these products,</p>
<p>I mean, to push back a little bit,</p>
<p>so even though the iPod is an end of an era.</p>
<p>Using it every day.</p>
<p>I think that, I mean, the number of people that impacted</p>
<p>is just, so I suppose the soul is carried by the people.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Sometimes the products you create</p>
<p>is the sort of the transport mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the vessel.</p>
<p>They felt the love, and they felt that love,</p>
<p>and it transformed them,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t have the vessel anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in that way, the soul lives on.</p>
<p>Just like the body is the vessel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>Why do you think we&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life, Tony?</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And death, man.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going all around.</p>
<p>Meaning of life?</p>
<p>Why, why?</p>
<p>Because you said it&rsquo;s important to have a press release.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If humanity, if life on earth,</p>
<p>if this thing, the consciousness,</p>
<p>the falling in love, and building bridges,</p>
<p>and iPods, and rockets,</p>
<p>and trying to extend out into the cosmos, why?</p>
<p>Why do you think we&rsquo;re doing it?</p>
<p>Is there any meaning to it?</p>
<p>We are naturally curious.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, we are naturally curious individuals.</p>
<p>And we are always looking for meaning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always trying to ascribe meaning to something,</p>
<p>or understanding of something, right?</p>
<p>And through that, it&rsquo;s just like evolution, right?</p>
<p>And Darwinism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that thing that&rsquo;s baked into our being</p>
<p>at the most fundamental level.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re creating some pretty cool things along the way.</p>
<p>Tony, you, and speaking of cool things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve created some of the coolest things ever.</p>
<p>And on top of that, you&rsquo;re just an amazing human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor that you&rsquo;ll sit and talk to me today.</p>
<p>This is fun.</p>
<p>Lex, this is great.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know where I was going,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m, let&rsquo;s talk, I&rsquo;m looking for season.</p>
<p>I would love to.</p>
<p>Seven, eight, nine.</p>
<p>Six, seven, yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go hang out and have dinner,</p>
<p>and just rap about all kinds of crazy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to continue this.</p>
<p>I would too.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Tony.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tony Fadal.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Tony Fadal himself.</p>
<p>The most wonderful part of building something together</p>
<p>with a team is that you&rsquo;re walking side by side</p>
<p>with other people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re all looking at your feet</p>
<p>and scanning the horizon at the same time.</p>
<p>Some people will see things you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and you will see things that are invisible to everyone else.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t think doing the work just means</p>
<p>locking yourself into a room.</p>
<p>A huge part of it is walking with your team.</p>
<p>The work is reaching your destination together</p>
<p>or finding a new destination</p>
<p>and bringing the team with you.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
