    <p>We&rsquo;re really excited to have Claire with us. Come on up Claire. Are you here?</p>
<p>Right. What are we&hellip; Welcome Claire. What will we be talking about today?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be talking about China, you know, just as everything has been all spicy.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, well, just again, we&rsquo;re trying to make today about just easy, breezy topics that,</p>
<p>you know, the most easiest things to manage. So we&hellip; armaments, Ukraine. Let&rsquo;s go to China. Sure.</p>
<p>Please welcome Claire.</p>
<p>We are going to actually keep this pretty apolitical today and maybe talk a bit about</p>
<p>the parts about China that are less discussed in the headlines. And, you know, Jason reached out</p>
<p>and he said he wanted to really understand what were some problems. And I wanted to see solved,</p>
<p>that we wanted to see solved. So I&rsquo;m a property developer. I run Greater China for Heinz. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the largest private real estate firm in the world. And we have an incredible Greater China team. I</p>
<p>know I see this folks in the front. They&rsquo;re like, where is she? I can&rsquo;t possibly spot her in there.</p>
<p>So we have a team that is working across Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Hong Kong. And</p>
<p>we get to work really across the real estate spectrum. So we built the greenest skyscraper</p>
<p>in China. We built some of the first international service departments</p>
<p>in the country, and are doing some really interesting innovative projects. Like in Hong Kong,</p>
<p>we bought a distressed hotel that we&rsquo;re turning into really a new kind of living, collaborative</p>
<p>living that&rsquo;s super technology enabled for a young population there, where the average white</p>
<p>collar young person, it takes them 20 years of salary to be able to buy an apartment. So we get</p>
<p>to approach these problems that are not unique to our part of the world, but often the solution is a</p>
<p>combination of east meets west. So back to kind of what&rsquo;s the problem? Well, you know, we&rsquo;re sitting</p>
<p>right now in Miami, a place that is super exciting, thanks to a lot of the things that are happening</p>
<p>right here that have been hyped by a pretty awesome mayor, right? What did he do? He got on</p>
<p>Twitter and he talked to all of us about what this city had to offer. It had key ingredients, it had</p>
<p>universities, it had an upward trajectory, it had young people looking to collaborate. And at the</p>
<p>end of the day, that&rsquo;s where we want to be, right? We want to be sitting together in awesome spaces like this,</p>
<p>exchanging ideas with other interesting people. That&rsquo;s how you do cool stuff. And so as property</p>
<p>developers, we think, you know, how do you create spaces where people want to be their best, right?</p>
<p>Collaborate with others and build a better future. So that&rsquo;s a lot of jargon, but what does that</p>
<p>actually mean? Back to the problem. Well, first, these ingredients are pretty clear. I teach a</p>
<p>class at Stanford on this called Who Owns Your City? And the students usually pick it up in the</p>
<p>first 10 minutes. It&rsquo;s a place that has pretty good infrastructure. Can I get a job? Can I afford</p>
<p>to live here? And is there cool cultural stuff that keeps it from being too bland? But then,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;d say, okay, well, cities can learn from each other, right? You can just take those</p>
<p>ingredients and apply it. And that&rsquo;s what Suarez did a great job of here. But we are living in a</p>
<p>time where the East and West have never been more divided, right? And building a city, building</p>
<p>buildings is really hard. It&rsquo;s like the most extreme version of hardware. So as a property</p>
<p>developer, we spend our time really thinking about what are the big macro trends? What are</p>
<p>startups focused on? Where do they want to be? Because our spaces need to be relevant for 50,</p>
<p>70, 100 years, and we can&rsquo;t pick up our building and move it somewhere else. And so you try to</p>
<p>take the arbitrage of what&rsquo;s working in one part of the world and try to apply that to another and</p>
<p>solve problems. And that&rsquo;s where you find great returns, but it&rsquo;s also where you build places</p>
<p>that are going to be relevant for folks. And so, you know, just a couple of examples up here</p>
<p>behind me. So, you know, we talked about the living challenges. So for folks to be able to afford a</p>
<p>place to buy, but the concept of rental apartments, so like multifamily, if anyone lives in a</p>
<p>multifamily building with one landlord, that isn&rsquo;t totally a thing in greater China. Often people are</p>
<p>left to rent from an individual landlord, pay a deposit that&rsquo;s enormous, cost prohibitive, and</p>
<p>get quality of product that really is not up to what they would expect. And so taking a very,</p>
<p>in some ways, kind of Western concept and applying it in a place that technologically is probably</p>
<p>about 10 to 15 years ahead in terms of what that average user is used to, okay? They&rsquo;re used to</p>
<p>unlocking a door with their phone. Their WeChat is their ID. It&rsquo;s the way they meet new people. They</p>
<p>can physically shake hands on WeChat to introduce themselves to a friend. It&rsquo;s where they keep their</p>
<p>coupons. It&rsquo;s how they pay their rent. It&rsquo;s how they pay their taxes in some regards, right? We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have that in America, but if you&rsquo;re like me and you live in greater China, you do. And so how do</p>
<p>you combine those things together to create something that doesn&rsquo;t exist? You see up behind</p>
<p>me a logistics building, but it&rsquo;s actually six stories high. Something we&rsquo;re developing that is</p>
<p>a giant, almost like a refrigerator, but a high-rise, super tech enabled. And that&rsquo;s because,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;ve got a lot of people. That building will be sitting within a 45-minute</p>
<p>driving radius to 45 million people. And yet China only has a quarter of the cold storage capacity</p>
<p>per capita that the U.S. does, okay? It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to see that this trajectory is, you know,</p>
<p>lower left to upper right. And so again, you&rsquo;re taking this concept of east meets west.</p>
<p>Building up here, just behind me, is in Shanghai. It&rsquo;s about a million foot tower. You have a lot of</p>
<p>those here in the United States. Big fancy office buildings, you know, where people used to go to sit</p>
<p>at their computers and do work. But this one is very different from one that you may have</p>
<p>walked into earlier this week. This entire building is on WeChat. You can interact with</p>
<p>the building on WeChat. You can interact with the landlord. You can interact with your other tenants.</p>
<p>You can have chance encounters or organize a yoga trip in the afternoon with the people,</p>
<p>with the space, using this digital interface. So in a way, it&rsquo;s really combining the way we</p>
<p>live right now. We live in a physical world, but so much of our idea sharing, our collaboration,</p>
<p>is happening in the air, right? In a digital experience that we can&rsquo;t see. And so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another combination of this east meets west. And so what becomes a problem and an opportunity,</p>
<p>the problem, when you sit in the middle of this world, like my team has the honor to do,</p>
<p>is you see that there are all of these opportunities for us to be able to share this,</p>
<p>really the best of what the west has to offer with the innovation that&rsquo;s happening on the ground</p>
<p>in China, but it is so hard to talk about in this very divided world. And so we like to take the</p>
<p>positive side and say, you know, we&rsquo;re living in this world of like magic and Larry, and how can</p>
<p>we make each other better? So I thought I&rsquo;d use just a few minutes and then we&rsquo;ll hang out with</p>
<p>the besties to maybe share a story that maybe y&rsquo;all haven&rsquo;t read so much about so that you get</p>
<p>the benefit of knowing a little bit about what&rsquo;s happening over there. And you can see an example</p>
<p>of where sort of east meets west and that collaboration can make us all better. So up</p>
<p>here is a gentleman you all will probably recognize. This is Deng Xiaoping, famous for</p>
<p>really the opening up of China. And he was an experimenter. You know, he had this vision of what</p>
<p>China could be, and he saw what the importance of the physical world, the physical infrastructure,</p>
<p>what a role that could play to enable the economy to jump further. And so the picture to the other</p>
<p>side is Shenzhen, which in 1980 was barely a fishing village. It had about 58,000 people, very</p>
<p>few paved roads, and Deng Xiaoping, he was from Sichuan, so he really understood what it was like</p>
<p>to not be from the big city. And so he declared it a special economic zone, special economic zone,</p>
<p>and that meant that it would be this place to experiment with bits of capitalism, free trade,</p>
<p>etc. So what is it today? Well, first, there&rsquo;s that same road along progression just a few years</p>
<p>after it was declared a zone. And then up here behind me is what it looks like now. Shenzhen</p>
<p>is over 12 million people. The average age is 29. It&rsquo;s really the tech hub of China. So companies</p>
<p>like DJI, which makes 70% of the world&rsquo;s drones, they call this area home. And just within this</p>
<p>area, if you were to go shortly from where this picture is taken, you&rsquo;ll have two of the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>five biggest ports by tonnage. So how do you take that head start and turn it into something</p>
<p>further? Well, they took a lesson out of the Book of the West, and they created something called</p>
<p>the Greater Bay Area. Okay, you guys get it. And so what is the Greater Bay Area? Well, it is a</p>
<p>collection of nine cities on the mainland side, some of which may be familiar to you guys. So</p>
<p>Shenzhen, as mentioned, and Guangzhou. Guangzhou is about 18 million people. Places like Zhuhai,</p>
<p>do y&rsquo;all remember, you know, several years ago, there was this thing about China building the</p>
<p>longest bridge in the world. Everyone&rsquo;s like, where is that? Okay, it was in Zhuhai. And then</p>
<p>so nine cities on the China side, and then Hong Kong, and Macau. And together, this this area,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the size of called West Virginia, today, has a GDP that&rsquo;s sitting right around</p>
<p>Canada and South Korea. Okay, about 1.7 trillion. In 2017, they declared this great Greater Bay Area</p>
<p>name and, and it was there to really back up a lot of the investment, frankly, that had already</p>
<p>started to join these cities together to create a super region. So within that super region,</p>
<p>they spent about 300 billion to build infrastructure to further connect it. So within just four years,</p>
<p>they built 2000 miles of speed rail, like high speed trains. Here we have like a little, you</p>
<p>know, one from here that goes to Fort Lauderdale, you know, Texas is going to get one in the year</p>
<ol start="2090">
<li>So what does that mean? That means that I can walk out of my office with my teammates</li>
</ol>
<p>in Hong Kong, which is right next to that big Ferris wheel thing that everybody recognizes.</p>
<p>I can take one stop onto Metro in 13 minutes on a speed train, I could be in Shenzhen, or I could</p>
<p>keep on going. And I could access about 23,000 miles of high speed trains and get to Beijing,</p>
<p>get to, you know, further than Guangzhou, get to Western China. It is amazing. And it is happening</p>
<p>so quickly. And that number will soon be 40,000 as they continue to build. But it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>speed trains. These are interconnected nodes with further Metro, right? With transit oriented</p>
<p>development on top of the meetings of these trains. So back to the so what. So we know that</p>
<p>if you take cool people, put them in cool places, and you give them an opportunity to interact,</p>
<p>well, what can you do? So this area, again, the size of West Virginia now with 70 million people</p>
<p>who are all quite young. And again, back to the ingredients. We talked about what sort of fosters</p>
<p>innovation. Well, they&rsquo;ve incentivized universities to put additional campuses here. And these are the</p>
<p>best universities in China. So Tsinghua, Fudan, etc. They funded further life science. They funded</p>
<p>further tax increment zones to encourage businesses to come and set up nodes of activity focused on</p>
<p>areas of excellence. So remember, we talked earlier about in 1980, there were 58,000 people</p>
<p>in all of Shenzhen. So just between 2010 and 2020, in one small neighborhood on the western side of</p>
<p>Shenzhen, they filed 58,000 patents. It&rsquo;s pretty amazing. And that shouldn&rsquo;t be scary. That should</p>
<p>be exciting, guys. This is where we get innovation. This is how we get better. Back to the magic</p>
<p>and Larry, right? Thank you. Yes, you can clap for that. You can clap for that.</p>
<p>So what does that mean for us? What does that mean for folks who are sort of getting to work</p>
<p>in this interstitial space in between getting to live within it? You know, up here, you know,</p>
<p>behind me, I have, I&rsquo;ll clear the visual for you. It&rsquo;s further disconnecting, showing these</p>
<p>metro lanes, these trams, buses, etc., leading to these speed trains. Back down here, that&rsquo;s Hong</p>
<p>Kong Island. And then this takes you through a bit of the Bay Area before you get out to the rest of</p>
<p>China. Well, why does it matter? It&rsquo;s because these things layer together. Okay, so China&rsquo;s</p>
<p>e-commerce percentage is about 25% of their overall retail. Here, it&rsquo;s about 14%. Again,</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all are smart. We can see where this is going. So you can take some notes on the preview and see</p>
<p>what things and trends may be coming here. In China, about 85-ish percent of their transactions</p>
<p>are mobile. Here, that&rsquo;s barely 30%. Where is that going? How does that work? And you can see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening. Another is you can look at trends that are just part of the world there that haven&rsquo;t made</p>
<p>it here. And you sit there and you&rsquo;re like, wow, what a chance to iterate. So the example there,</p>
<p>again, we&rsquo;ll stick with shopping and retail, is social shopping. So this idea of streaming while</p>
<p>shopping that&rsquo;s layered with a full experience and imagine what it can do. Again, if you layer that</p>
<p>on top of this WeChat platform we were just talking about, a place where I can go and I</p>
<p>could make a new friend right now, you, by looking at you, showing my phone to you,</p>
<p>putting them together so we can introduce a product, introduce a lecture, a concept together.</p>
<p>Imagine what we can do. Elon likes WeChat. He was just talking about it yesterday.</p>
<p>So the point is that we all have this opportunity to really, again, the headlines can be exciting,</p>
<p>they can be crispy, but to look beneath them and to take an opportunity to further connect</p>
<p>with the people because, again, those folks who are hopping on these trains for probably the</p>
<p>equivalent of about 45 cents to get on the public transit here, going around and exchanging ideas,</p>
<p>these people, most of them are not politicians. Most of them are not big world global leaders.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re folks who are trying to create something for themselves, to create something for their</p>
<p>children, to build a better world. So we&rsquo;re really all on the same team. So with that,</p>
<p>bring the besties out, I guess. Try not to get too spicy.</p>
<p>All right. Center stage for you. Right here. Right there in the middle seat.</p>
<p>Oh, baby. Well done. Well done. Be nice, guys. Be nice. Of course. Well,</p>
<p>sax is in here, so of course we&rsquo;ll be nice. That&rsquo;s kind of by default. And meet our</p>
<p>Ryan Peterson from Flexport. Claire, maybe you guys, Ryan, Claire, Ryan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m introducing you two guys, Claire, Ryan, Ryan, Claire.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll switch over. You guys met?</p>
<p>We follow each other. So what do we as Americans</p>
<p>not understand about our rival? And what does our rival most not understand about us,</p>
<p>in your estimation, having operated in both countries for so long?</p>
<p>You know, the term rival is an interesting one. Obviously, I love</p>
<p>sports analogies and came from the track and field world myself.</p>
<p>Claire was in the Olympics, guys. Claire was injured.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, how do you still go running sometimes?</p>
<p>Kind of fast. At the Olympics.</p>
<p>But, you know, your job in the sport is to find the person who is better than you in some ways,</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re strong where you&rsquo;re weak. You&rsquo;re weak where they&rsquo;re strong.</p>
<p>You find each other and you shore up together. And I think that is what becomes so clear when you,</p>
<p>you know, live there, when you live on the other side of the world. But maybe we&rsquo;re born here,</p>
<p>or, you know, I&rsquo;m a minority, so I&rsquo;ve maybe always lived in that interstitial</p>
<p>space personally. Or even our team. Our team is very representative of modern China.</p>
<p>We have people from nearly every province. They&rsquo;re really across the education bracket,</p>
<p>highly trained engineers, but who might be quite young, to folks in their 60s who have really seen</p>
<p>China evolve. And so I do think the thing that can get missed is almost that concept like we</p>
<p>talked about that as, quote, rivals, you know, they&rsquo;re not monoliths. Just as America is not</p>
<p>a monolith, right? And we can take the best of each other. So we&rsquo;re best of rivals in a way.</p>
<p>There we go. Is there a model for the century for cooperation between the two nations that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enhancing to both? I think it&rsquo;s happening in enterprise. I really think it is. So when I</p>
<p>look at, again, younger people, the products that they use or the things that the young tech,</p>
<p>you know, entrepreneurs in China are working on versus here, they&rsquo;re approaching a lot of</p>
<p>the same problems, right? So on the social side, you know, looking at Douyin and what made it so</p>
<p>catchy, right? Explain what it is for us. It&rsquo;s TikTok. It&rsquo;s TikTok. And back to that one about,</p>
<p>you know, cheat codes and a preview. You know, Douyin was popular years ago. And so, you know,</p>
<p>I remember first looking at the app and being like, wow, this is very catchy. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>effectively no difference between Douyin and TikTok. Do you read and write Mandarin fluently</p>
<p>as well as speak it? Well, you will never confuse me for a fukou. But, you know, enough to get by.</p>
<p>And so when you do business in China, do you conduct it in English or do you conduct it</p>
<p>in Mandarin? Yes. So with the team, we work fully across what&rsquo;s appropriate because we also work in</p>
<p>Hong Kong where it&rsquo;s Cantonese. But all of my communications that go out to my full team,</p>
<p>everything in full team is in Mandarin. We do have a large part of our team that only functions</p>
<p>within Mandarin. So when you&rsquo;re, for example, like, you know, you showed some of these buildings,</p>
<p>and the idea that came to me is, this is a massive coordination problem that&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>impossible in the United States, which is if you have this idea of like this living, breathing,</p>
<p>monolithic building that is connected via the Internet, it probably would be 50 organizations</p>
<p>in the United States that would have to have a say or want to say. The perception that we get</p>
<p>is there is a individual that can effectively make that right decision in China, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at the city level or at the state level. Is that how it&rsquo;s really like? Like when you guys have</p>
<p>super ambitious ideas, is there one place you go to and then it just kind of all gets decided?</p>
<p>Or is it just like here where it&rsquo;s messy? So it&rsquo;s kind of neither, actually. And this is where I</p>
<p>think it takes the best of both, which is at a local level. So you have, you know, a local, we</p>
<p>have a party secretary, you have a block leader, and ultimately, it goes all the way up to, you</p>
<p>know, the big guy. But China does this amazing thing. They have a five-year plan. They call it</p>
<p>the five-year plan. Last year was the 14th five-year plan, and it sets KPIs and areas of focus for</p>
<p>the entire country. And those are things around carbon neutrality, education, care for seniors,</p>
<p>agriculture, industry. And it&rsquo;s a lot like, you know, for you guys who are running companies,</p>
<p>setting goals and how are you going to get there? What&rsquo;s the roadmap? But that filters all the way</p>
<p>down. And so at a local level, those KPIs for the local leader are, you know, how did you make your</p>
<p>district greener? How did you increase revenue from higher quality services and technologically</p>
<p>advanced companies? What happens if you don&rsquo;t achieve it? You get fired, you get kicked out</p>
<p>of the party. Like, what is the mechanism of reward? Yeah. Well, it&rsquo;s quite high accountability.</p>
<p>And so if you perform very well within that system as a leader, then you can move to higher and more</p>
<p>advanced posts to a bigger city. Right. So, yeah. So from a block to a bigger city to a higher,</p>
<p>you know, up to a sort of higher&hellip; Your political career stalls out if you don&rsquo;t hit them,</p>
<p>but it gets accelerated if you exceed them. Right. And so that creates a very interesting set of</p>
<p>opportunities. And so to put it to maybe a tangible example is so for the things that, you know, are</p>
<p>really great for communities like park space or building a building that&rsquo;s green. The last</p>
<p>building that I showed up there is right, sits right on top of a metro and is next to a natural</p>
<p>history museum. And we needed to work with the local government to ensure that we were relating</p>
<p>to the area properly, creating, like leaving it better than we found it. You know, we look at</p>
<p>projects where you can&rsquo;t do the project unless you show that it&rsquo;s going to be green and additive</p>
<p>or restore historic buildings in the area. There&rsquo;s a real handshake there that I firmly</p>
<p>believe creates better outcomes. I know our team would say the same thing.</p>
<p>Claire, what&rsquo;s going to happen with the capital markets for your business with Evergrande and like</p>
<p>some of these big kind of property developers that have had major debt problems? Have you seen</p>
<p>that already flowing over? And you understand the market very well, you probably are able to</p>
<p>navigate this, but the foreign capital and other investors like might group everybody into the same</p>
<p>block and get scared off. Sure, sure. So certainly we get a lot of questions, but it&rsquo;s another one</p>
<p>where the headlines out versus inside the country. Certainly the built environment,</p>
<p>the construction and the real estate industries, if you combine that all together, you&rsquo;ve got about</p>
<p>27% of the economy. If you include the full integrated stack, one of the things in five-year</p>
<p>plan is to diversify away from that in a way. But is Evergrande and the other developers,</p>
<p>the real focus at the local and the higher level is to help the regular people</p>
<p>get good on their deposits and ultimately get the homes that they were promised.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very interesting for developers like us and acquisitions people as for some of those</p>
<p>smaller developers who got into trouble. Has there been a bailout? Is that the wrong word,</p>
<p>the way that it&rsquo;s been characterized in the U.S. media that the Chinese government had to step in,</p>
<p>shore up the balance sheet, make sure Evergrande wouldn&rsquo;t default on some of their loans?</p>
<p>I think there was a concern that there would be an entire meltdown of the full Chinese economy,</p>
<p>which is not what we feel on the ground. And I think if anything, it&rsquo;s created a set of</p>
<p>opportunities to really level set, especially on the living sector. It&rsquo;s really accelerated</p>
<p>some policies to make it easier to build and to create rental housing, which creates more access,</p>
<p>which therefore maybe takes away some of the pressure on the condominium system.</p>
<p>You know, for the debt markets to create a space that is maybe taking on projects that are</p>
<p>appropriate for the system, a little bit, again, more diversification and development in the right</p>
<p>places in the right markets. When we look at the relationship between the United States and China,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had three, four, 500 million people come out of abject poverty on the planet because of this</p>
<p>great engagement. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a term, but I&rsquo;ll call it the great engagement.</p>
<p>We started using their factories. We started making iPhones there. This has created, despite</p>
<p>all of the hand-wringing about the relationship and all the various issues on both sides,</p>
<p>a lot less suffering in the world. Absolutely. And so there is something that I think we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recognize sometimes is that people who are living for under a dollar a day, three or four,</p>
<p>500 million of them are now gone. And that leaves some areas in Africa and Southeast Asia</p>
<p>that we still need to do that work, which paradoxically or ironically, it seems like</p>
<p>China is doing in Africa. What I&rsquo;m curious about is what you&rsquo;re seeing on the ground</p>
<p>with their middle class, which to me seems analogous to what we went through in the 30s,</p>
<p>40s, and 50s, this establishment of a middle class, which then established education and</p>
<p>prosperity for the decades to come, and specifically for the boomers and Gen X.</p>
<p>So tell us about that middle class that&rsquo;s emerging. We hear about it.</p>
<p>How many of them are there? And qualitatively, what do they want from life?</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, Jason, in a word, it&rsquo;s incredible. Again, I talk about infrastructure so much</p>
<p>because you see it up there, right? China&rsquo;s only as urbanized as the U.S. was in about 1950.</p>
<p>So we read a lot about these- Today.</p>
<p>Today. Today. So we read a lot about these-</p>
<p>Bullet trains. Right. And so that leads to this</p>
<p>incredible consolidation of people to cities and younger people to cities. It&rsquo;s a demographic</p>
<p>spark that maybe gets talked about a little bit less. But also, if you look at the change</p>
<p>that that person you&rsquo;re talking about has seen in their lifetime. So they went from a rural</p>
<p>lifestyle, frankly, most of them, and something of a village setting that had not changed in decades</p>
<p>to this future world that in many ways can only be imagined in movies. And so I think, I sort of</p>
<p>struggle to put it into terms because you asked, what do they want? What are they looking towards?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, to use a personal example, right? I&rsquo;m the luckiest girl in the world. I get to live</p>
<p>in this amazing place and work with this incredible team. And yet, my parents graduated in a fully</p>
<p>segregated world. The elder people, when they were growing up, were not just slaves. They were</p>
<p>the slaves that we talk about on Juneteenth. The ones in Galveston who walked across the bridge</p>
<p>and followed railroad tracks to Houston, Texas. That&rsquo;s amazing. That is amazing. And so I think</p>
<p>when a generation or a collection of generations sees that amount of change, what they want is,</p>
<p>first of all, they&rsquo;re grateful. But what do they want? They want to be able to build and create</p>
<p>and be people themselves. Yeah. I have a question. Japan in the 80s had a moment where everything</p>
<p>came together for that country. Great population growth, great economic growth, great systems like</p>
<p>Kaizen and all of this other stuff that they would export. And the headlines in the 80s was Japan was</p>
<p>taking over the United States or Japan was going to lap the United States. But really, one of the</p>
<p>biggest things that it had working against it was a demographic wave, right? And you had massive</p>
<p>negative birth rate that has really compounded Japan&rsquo;s stagnation. China is on the precipice</p>
<p>of this because of this one China policy. I think the stat that I saw, which is stunning, is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 1.2 billion people in China, 1.4. By 2100, it&rsquo;s going to be around 600 million.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s true, the point is just that there&rsquo;s a real issue. Yeah. Is there something in these</p>
<p>five-year plans around how to become sort of more culturally integrated with the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Meaning, how do you use immigration as an example to subsidize some of the negative birth rate?</p>
<p>Do you teach English more so that you&rsquo;re more integrated into the world economy?</p>
<p>All of these things. Can you just talk about that?</p>
<p>So first, I think the urbanization trend of folks consolidating to the cities really can&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>overstated, just in the way that it shifts sort of how the country will work and what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>on the ground. It&rsquo;s still relatively early days, but when we look at things like Belt and Road,</p>
<p>as I walk around Beijing and I compare it to when we first started there or when we were</p>
<p>working with capital partners there, I see a lot more brown faces going to the universities around</p>
<p>Beijing. Explain what Belt and Road is for folks who maybe haven&rsquo;t heard the term.</p>
<p>Yeah. So many places you guys can read about it. And before I forget,</p>
<p>talking about sort of just, I know everybody loves recommendations here. So if you haven&rsquo;t read</p>
<p>Dahlia&rsquo;s latest book on changing world order, or there&rsquo;s actually a great&hellip; You read it.</p>
<p>Freeberg made us all read it.</p>
<p>She read it. I see.</p>
<p>Freeberg made us read it.</p>
<p>Freeberg talked about it every podcast for the last 20, as you know.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to read it. Listen to your besties. There&rsquo;s also a very good</p>
<p>video.</p>
<p>A very good illustration of it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Sunrises and sunsets.</p>
<p>That you guys have talked about.</p>
<p>But do read that because China has been a major participant in the global south. So the short</p>
<p>version of Belt and Road is working really across a set of countries around Southeast Asia and</p>
<p>Africa, bringing in infrastructure and kind of what it sounds like, roads, ports, airports,</p>
<p>et cetera, really building out this network for that part of the world.</p>
<p>But I think what gets sort of bumped over on that is, again, things like this. So folks coming to</p>
<p>China to be educated, the number of folks on the African continent now learning Chinese. And again,</p>
<p>I think this is something that is exciting at the end of the day. The opportunity to further</p>
<p>exchange, to lift more people out of poverty, to create further infrastructure.</p>
<p>Claire, I was hoping you would stay with us and be a bestie</p>
<p>for Ryan, who&rsquo;s the next speaker. Would you be willing to help us interview Ryan?</p>
<p>I would be honored.</p>
<p>You want to switch seats?</p>
<p>No, no. There we are. Oh, yes. Switch seats.</p>
<p>Switch seats. Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;d be better.</p>
<p>Switch seats.</p>
<p>Get in. I warmed it up for you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re the guestie. I like it. I like it.</p>
<p>So give it up for Claire. Now, Ryan, congratulations. CNBC does their top</p>
<p>innovator of private company awards every year. And you made it to the top 50 list today.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t check which ranking you got, but being on the list in and of itself is a big win.</p>
<p>What do they call it? Disruptor&rsquo;s list?</p>
<p>Disruptor 50. And my view of these lists is you should never share any list about</p>
<p>your company unless you&rsquo;re number one. And we were number one this morning.</p>
<p>All right. Well done.</p>
<p>You truly helped us navigate, I think, the challenge of us as besties and the audience</p>
<p>understanding supply chain. We appreciate that. You&rsquo;ve been on the show twice, I think, or?</p>
<p>Just once so far.</p>
<p>Just once so far. And then here. This is your second time on the show.</p>
<p>Apologies. I was filming the interview for that during Palmer&rsquo;s talk this morning.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t miss anything.</p>
<p>You missed nothing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I missed.</p>
<p>Nothing much happened.</p>
<p>But when Palmer and I woke up this morning, we were writing our speeches together and</p>
<p>deciding what we were going to say.</p>
<p>Oh, do you have some feelings you&rsquo;d like to share with the class?</p>
<p>No, no. I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Seems to be a theme. I mean, this is turning into therapy.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t have any enemies.</p>
<p>I have some emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad. I got COVID.</p>
<p>You just have nice things about people, J.K.</p>
<p>I got COVID. I couldn&rsquo;t think of a single person. Who do I want to give this to?</p>
<p>I was like, I like everybody. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So tell us.</p>
<p>He was going to do a talk, right? Are you doing a talk for a couple of minutes?</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s going to talk from there.</p>
<p>Let me share a little bit about what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>So first off, what Flexport is, is we&rsquo;re a global logistics platform.</p>
<p>We help businesses of all sizes ship products all over the world,</p>
<p>from anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>We do a lot of business in China.</p>
<p>Probably about half of all of our volumes come out of China.</p>
<p>I know a landlord if you&rsquo;re looking for one.</p>
<p>Ryan, just put it out there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do some business after this.</p>
<p>And so we see a lot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sort of like a front row backstage pass to the world economy.</p>
<p>Of what&rsquo;s really happening and unfolding.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a crazy few years.</p>
<p>To give you context, so Flexport started in 2013.</p>
<p>First revenue was in 2014.</p>
<p>We did $2 million in revenue that year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on track this year to do $5 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>So very exhausting.</p>
<p>And this time period is, I assume it&rsquo;s always like this in this industry.</p>
<p>I have only been in the business for about 8 or 10 years here.</p>
<p>But just to take you through that timeline.</p>
<p>In 2015, there was a port strike on the west coast.</p>
<p>And you couldn&rsquo;t import anything into the United States for like three months.</p>
<p>Total pandemonium.</p>
<p>By the way, that might happen again July 1st.</p>
<p>Their contract that they negotiated back then is up for renewal on July 1st.</p>
<p>So we might talk about that.</p>
<p>2016, there was so much excess capacity of ocean shipping.</p>
<p>So many extra ships were purchased.</p>
<p>That the price of ocean freight hit the lowest in all of human history.</p>
<p>$600 to ship a container this past year was $20,000 in 2016.</p>
<p>So we go through these boom and bust cycles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an asset business.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>2017, 18, and 19, our president would launch a new tariff war every couple of months.</p>
<p>And you couldn&rsquo;t predict anything.</p>
<p>2020, a pandemic hits.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t ship anything for a couple of months out of China.</p>
<p>Where they were really hard.</p>
<p>Zero COVID.</p>
<p>Shut down factories.</p>
<p>Shut down all the purchase orders.</p>
<p>Everyone thought the Great Depression was coming.</p>
<p>Cancelled all the purchase orders.</p>
<p>Then it turned out the opposite happened.</p>
<p>It was this crazy boom.</p>
<p>And you couldn&rsquo;t import anything because the ports were overcrowded.</p>
<p>It went from 2019, it took about 50 days to ship a container.</p>
<p>From when the goods are ready.</p>
<p>When the factory raises their hand and says, hey, come and pick up these goods.</p>
<p>To right now, it&rsquo;s about 120 days.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doubling or more than doubling the transit time.</p>
<p>And it is just incredibly hard to operate in this environment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to run a business.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve had to learn how to navigate through chaos as Flexport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we kind of welcome it at this point.</p>
<p>We found that it might actually be good for our business.</p>
<p>We try not to talk about that because it&rsquo;s so bad for our customers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been hard to fulfill the customer promises.</p>
<p>But if you put yourself in the shoes of those customers.</p>
<p>So like a direct-to-consumer e-commerce business.</p>
<p>And we ship for probably 80 or 90% of the hot new DTC brands.</p>
<p>A lot of IPOs recently.</p>
<p>A lot of really cool, hot new brands.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going through almost a perfect storm right now.</p>
<p>In like a really, really bad way.</p>
<p>Like the movie, The Perfect Storm.</p>
<p>Because ocean freight rates are sky high.</p>
<p>Mention this, $10,000, $20,000 to ship a container.</p>
<p>Rule of thumb, long term is like two grand.</p>
<p>So really, really elevated costs.</p>
<p>Walmart announced really high costs this morning.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not just small companies.</p>
<p>But Walmart announced their costs were through the roof from supply chain.</p>
<p>And their stock fell 10% today.</p>
<p>Wiping off $40 billion of market cap this morning.</p>
<p>So it hits companies of all sizes.</p>
<p>But these DTC brands got a double whammy.</p>
<p>Because Apple, I think it was last year when they changed their privacy rules.</p>
<p>And their customer acquisition models are on Instagram, Facebook.</p>
<p>All these things stopped working.</p>
<p>And so at the same moment you&rsquo;re cacked, it stops working.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t acquire customers.</p>
<p>Your supply chain costs are through the roof.</p>
<p>And then add to that, the consumers are now starting to come back to conferences like this.</p>
<p>Go back to the restaurants and the clubs and doing the travel.</p>
<p>And during the pandemic, everybody just bought stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to get your dopamine from somewhere.</p>
<p>And everybody was just buying goods.</p>
<p>So that is like a triple whammy for these companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly worried about the whole DTC brand, the whole DTC space.</p>
<p>The DTC space, just anyone in physical goods.</p>
<p>You saw it in like the, I think it was Thrashio that just announced</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re laying off 25% of their employees.</p>
<p>Thrashio was buying a collection of those Amazon DTC brands,</p>
<p>putting them together and trying to have some economies of scale.</p>
<p>But when your supply and your demand both get 10x&rsquo;ed in the wrong direction, it&rsquo;s game over.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s game over, but it definitely changes the rules of the game.</p>
<p>The reality is, look, people are still going to buy stuff.</p>
<p>There are going to be successful.</p>
<p>There are going to be some winners.</p>
<p>There are going to be brands that survive.</p>
<p>At what price though?</p>
<p>At what price?</p>
<p>Well, so you&rsquo;re saying that your thesis that you&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>the statement that you&rsquo;re making today is,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re seeing real significant risk to DTC companies</p>
<p>because of this confluence of issues right now.</p>
<p>And this could be a big threat to a lot of businesses,</p>
<p>particularly in an environment where venture funding is.</p>
<p>I think again, venture funding.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, it&rsquo;s a triple storm.</p>
<p>The capital markets are dry.</p>
<p>Capital markets, public and private.</p>
<p>Investors are like, you all will look at this and go,</p>
<p>hey, maybe I put more into SaaS or something.</p>
<p>Like Keith said, it&rsquo;s just easier to not do anything.</p>
<p>It might be easier to not do anything.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>How do you manage this?</p>
<p>And fundamentally, one of the problems that comes about in all supply chains,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been written about the famous PhD paper from like the 60s</p>
<p>or something called the bullwhip effect.</p>
<p>And a bullwhip, if you like crack a whip,</p>
<p>the end of that whip is moving incredibly fast.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a bit like that in supply chains</p>
<p>because you have imperfect information.</p>
<p>And so the people doing demand planning are living in one system.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re selling goods.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at this data set.</p>
<p>The people producing stuff, it&rsquo;s on a different system.</p>
<p>How long is it taking to produce things?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s getting longer.</p>
<p>The transit time is getting longer.</p>
<p>This data is living across all these different domains</p>
<p>and becoming very, very hard for a brand to make a decision.</p>
<p>How many goods should we buy?</p>
<p>When should we buy them?</p>
<p>So how much do we want to have in stock?</p>
<p>How do we avoid being way over stock?</p>
<p>And then what we&rsquo;re seeing right now is these warehouses are overflowing</p>
<p>and people can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So what changes that?</p>
<p>Like what breaks it open?</p>
<p>So, you know, like in China, Pinduoduo didn&rsquo;t exist in 2015.</p>
<p>Now 800 million plus, right, users.</p>
<p>But it was technology that broke it open.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the breakout moment to solve this exact problem you&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>I mean, actually, China&rsquo;s got one of the companies to watch is</p>
<p>Shane, S-H-E-I-N.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this Chinese, kind of like the new Zara that is taking over the world.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re going to do $20 billion in revenue this year.</p>
<p>Fast fashion?</p>
<p>Fast fashion.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re launching a thousand SKUs a day.</p>
<p>A thousand new SKUs a day.</p>
<p>All like AI generated.</p>
<p>And then if people are ordering up, they produce it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like really incredible.</p>
<p>Wait, you&rsquo;re saying a robot says, make these SKUs.</p>
<p>This is where this shirt is from, actually.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a shirt designer.</p>
<p>I kid you not.</p>
<p>Yeah, see?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, yeah, I did that shirt.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s going to be a million of them going to be ordered after this.</p>
<p>Hold on, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Tell us, so wait, sorry.</p>
<p>This shirt you bought.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s literally a shirt from Shein.</p>
<p>But yes, so if Zara is seeing something on a runway, determining that that trend will hit,</p>
<p>and then they can have it in stores, I think, within like eight or nine days, something pretty</p>
<p>wild, Shein&rsquo;s about as close to instantaneous as you can get.</p>
<p>So very fast moving SKUs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of hyper speed fashion.</p>
<p>So they can have things almost on the same day.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they&rsquo;re kind of like pre-cons, you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Like for minority, but they&rsquo;re predicting that this puffy shirt is going to be like,</p>
<p>women are going to want to go for pirates.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a fly shirt.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And I think one of the key things here is that transit time of how long does it take you from</p>
<p>when the thing is made to when it gets to the customer?</p>
<p>Because if it stretches out the way it has right now, an ocean freight market,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s taking forever, if that takes three months, four months, five months.</p>
<p>Might not be flying no more.</p>
<p>Six months, all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve placed these orders.</p>
<p>And then the demand went away because people started going to nightclubs instead of buying</p>
<p>their gardening equipment.</p>
<p>And so the tighter you can make that, and it does speak to spending a little bit more</p>
<p>on logistics, where traditional procurement person in logistics only thinks about like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to buy the cheapest freight I can ever buy.</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t understand that your goods in transit are just money that&rsquo;s taken a different</p>
<p>form for a period of time.</p>
<p>And money has a cost to it.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re sitting there on six months, that&rsquo;s already expensive because you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>to pay interest on that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s opportunity cost.</p>
<p>What else could you do with the money?</p>
<p>But now that cost has gotten much worse because by the time the goods arrive,</p>
<p>maybe nobody wants them.</p>
<p>You saw that with Christmas where, you know, you import Christmas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the classic that you import Christmas stuff.</p>
<p>And in January, it&rsquo;s worthless.</p>
<p>At what price do people just find alternate ways, whether it&rsquo;s you establish domestic</p>
<p>3D printing, or you buy a fleet of planes, or like, there&rsquo;s got to be a work.</p>
<p>Because like I saw this image, I think maybe you tweeted it, of this entire massive traffic</p>
<p>jam, basically trying to get the ships even into China because the COVID-19 lockdowns</p>
<p>are so strict, that that&rsquo;s also exacerbated all of this.</p>
<p>And last year, Walmart, didn&rsquo;t they announce they&rsquo;re spending $10 billion verticalizing</p>
<p>their supply chain and building out their own infrastructure for moving goods?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen a lot of companies do this.</p>
<p>Much easier said than done.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen at least a few of the big box retailers, Walmart, I want to say Home Depot,</p>
<p>Costco, a number of these guys have said, hey, we&rsquo;re going to charter our own ships.</p>
<p>Target was the other one.</p>
<p>Maybe Target, Amazon, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Go charter their own ships, go solve the problem their own way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to do, run these things at scale and operate it.</p>
<p>It looks good at the PowerPoint slide.</p>
<p>When you have to get down to it, it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>So is there a big CapEx play here, Ryan, for the next decade?</p>
<p>I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Like a big capital equipment, hard asset play?</p>
<p>So the world&rsquo;s ocean carriers, that&rsquo;s what we call the people that own the ships, have</p>
<p>actually ordered 25% more ships, increased the fleet by 25% over the next three years.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So it could be ugly the other way real quick.</p>
<p>You have too many ships and nobody, you know, the ship owners can&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a similar sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>But anyway.</p>
<p>Ryan said it best.</p>
<p>The problem is you can&rsquo;t forecast demand accurately for these long leap time categories that are</p>
<p>highly CapEx intensive.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s mining or whether it&rsquo;s chipping, how do you make a $500 million CapEx decision</p>
<p>for a business demand cycle that&rsquo;s five years into the future?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re all taking profit hits and saying, we have to make this investment because we</p>
<p>need the security, we need the redundancy.</p>
<p>I mean, Walmart did it, right?</p>
<p>They were optimized to a T.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden it&rsquo;s like, hey, that optimized system doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Look, the way that mining, for example, deals with this, which is really interesting, is</p>
<p>they get these companies to sign up what&rsquo;s called take or pay agreements, right?</p>
<p>And so they can actually smooth out the demand curve five or six in the future.</p>
<p>Take or pay means I&rsquo;ll do a deal that says, okay, I&rsquo;m going to rip the lithium out of</p>
<p>the ground.</p>
<p>You take it or you pay for it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what you do, but I&rsquo;m going to get the revenue assurance I need to go to</p>
<p>Wall Street to get the money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve started to see those signs for the first time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve signed three-year contracts.</p>
<p>Flexport was the first ever to sign a multi-year contract where we commit we will pay for this</p>
<p>freight whether or not we ship anything.</p>
<p>Take or pay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to pay up front.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, take or pay.</p>
<p>And you asked a little bit, air freight, what&rsquo;s going to happen there?</p>
<p>Well, remember, 50% of all the world&rsquo;s air freight flies in the belly of passenger planes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s way less people traveling to and from Asia than there were.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, 50% of the world&rsquo;s air freight, which is a little scary when you think about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>under the belly of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, is that getting scanned?</p>
<p>It is, it is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good controls on that, but you never know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a little nerve-wracking.</p>
<p>He seemed to be not so sure.</p>
<p>You work in any industry long enough, you start to question whether everything&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve actually got 10 passenger planes that we&rsquo;ve leased, and we&rsquo;ll keep doing more,</p>
<p>that are not flying any passengers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just filling them with freight.</p>
<p>We started doing this in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Are there seats in them?</p>
<p>Flying masks.</p>
<p>Are there seats at the top?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still seats in some of them.</p>
<p>Some we&rsquo;ve ripped out the seats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like castaway.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the big plane, basically just holding stuff.</p>
<p>If you want to go to Asia, I&rsquo;ve got a 787.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody on there.</p>
<p>It could be a private flight, just you.</p>
<p>But exactly, this is why you&rsquo;ve seen the rise of logistics real estate as a deeply</p>
<p>institutional asset class, because that math that you talk about, the algorithms of determining</p>
<p>what is ordered, how long will it sit, and how fast do people want it?</p>
<p>That takes infrastructure on land to be able to get it to people as well.</p>
<p>Coming back to the question about assets, is there a play here?</p>
<p>Probably, yes, because most of Wall Street has been trained.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gone to all the same business schools, and everybody&rsquo;s been trained that assets are</p>
<p>terrible.</p>
<p>Get them off your books.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t carry them.</p>
<p>This is what happened with oil and gas going into last year.</p>
<p>And everyone missed it.</p>
<p>You want to be asset light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still the trend, and almost everywhere, until somebody like TSMC comes along and says,</p>
<p>you know what?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want assets?</p>
<p>Intel, fine, we&rsquo;ll build the fabs.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re a $400 billion company, because they&rsquo;re willing to have assets on the books.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a different investor position.</p>
<p>Now they have power in the equation, and they can get a better share of value.</p>
<p>The hardest question for me to answer, and I know that there&rsquo;s some entrepreneurs out</p>
<p>there who have the same question.</p>
<p>Anytime someone asks me, is Flexport a software company or a logistics company?</p>
<p>Are you going to own assets or not own assets?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I think the correct answer is to ask the investor which one they&rsquo;ll give you a higher</p>
<p>multiple for, and then just say that.</p>
<p>Try to figure out who you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>But it is, on some level, maybe another answer is kind of Buddhist dualism.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do logistics without the tech.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do the tech without the logistics.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re bringing up something, which is that today, the problem with the capital</p>
<p>markets is actually that it is very balkanized.</p>
<p>So meaning, let&rsquo;s just say you take a company public like yours.</p>
<p>The problem that you&rsquo;ll have in the public markets is that there are folks that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go to in that room that understand SaaS software, understand margin structure of a software</p>
<p>business, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s folks over here who run the industrials business and folks over here</p>
<p>who run consumer.</p>
<p>The problem is those three folks don&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>They have three completely different conceptions of what a good business is.</p>
<p>And the problem for you will be, and I&rsquo;m not forecasting this for you to be a problem,</p>
<p>is that you can get orphaned in any one of these groups.</p>
<p>And now, all of a sudden, the capital markets could be totally shut for you.</p>
<p>This is a very important point that you&rsquo;re bringing up.</p>
<p>The thing that I think we need to change is the capital people that control the money</p>
<p>flows do need to have a little bit more of an open mind.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s true that you&rsquo;d love a 90% gross margin business.</p>
<p>But it is also true, in the TSMC case, you&rsquo;d rather have a business doing 20% on $500 billion.</p>
<p>Well, and if we look, Chamath, we also have some examples of Amazon.</p>
<p>The market seems to have worked out this business that&rsquo;s very factory and asset heavy in delivering</p>
<p>goods to us and the cloud business.</p>
<p>Even Amazon.</p>
<p>Look, Amazon got escape velocity on less than a billion dollars of invested capital.</p>
<p>The problem is, if Ryan, for example, decides,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m going to go and actually vertically integrate and buy an entire fleet of ships,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably a $10 to $20 billion capex cycle over 10 years.</p>
<p>And you think about replacement costs, it may make a ton of sense, actually.</p>
<p>I wonder when Amazon&rsquo;s cap expenses for those servers started to hit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s thinking about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to buy a fleet of ships.</p>
<p>But do you think the capital markets will show up?</p>
<p>The little boy in me definitely wants to do that.</p>
<p>You want to own a fleet of ships?</p>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t want to own a fleet of ships?</p>
<p>But no, we&rsquo;re not going to do that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two plays.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, your bullwhip effect means the data can&rsquo;t flow.</p>
<p>And people can&rsquo;t make decisions optimally because the data is trapped in multiple places.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how to run an efficient supply chain because you don&rsquo;t know how many trucks</p>
<p>do I need when the ship arrives.</p>
<p>Actually, not even long-term demand forecasting how many ships,</p>
<p>but literally, that ship is going to arrive.</p>
<p>How many trucks should I dispatch?</p>
<p>When should I dispatch them?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways to solve this problem.</p>
<p>One is to own the asset.</p>
<p>And the other is to create a data network effect such that the asset owner benefits</p>
<p>enough from putting it on your platform.</p>
<p>Your machine learning, your algorithms are helping them make more money from their asset.</p>
<p>They want to tell you what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And both of these are potential plays.</p>
<p>One of them is a lot, hopefully, simpler and don&rsquo;t need to manage as many people.</p>
<p>Life is easier if you can solve the data machine learning problem.</p>
<p>But you look at Alibaba and Alibaba investing down into China.</p>
<p>There is a middle road of being able to go to China.</p>
<p>So logistics, warehouse.</p>
<p>As stupid as it sounds, you having purchased a shipping company and putting it over here,</p>
<p>to your point, Clara, and saying, here&rsquo;s the little thing we bought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bunch of ships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s its own balance sheet.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s the really great business.</p>
<p>But we have this little subsidiary over here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a potential middle ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what makes Flexport fun business.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a million strategies and ways to play out.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not a big believer in predicting the future.</p>
<p>And you want to have a vision and know where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>But I think be sort of flexible.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s in the name.</p>
<p>We talk about our culture a lot.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the goal of a company&rsquo;s culture?</p>
<p>And Elon talks about the goal of a company.</p>
<p>The purpose is like, hey, we&rsquo;ve got to create valuable products and services for fellow</p>
<p>humans, right?</p>
<p>But the goal of your culture is how do you maximize your velocity in that direction?</p>
<p>And velocity is a really important word, because we forget, like normal people forget</p>
<p>that velocity is different from speed.</p>
<p>If you remember your physics, velocity has a direction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to know where you&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>And sometimes going really, really fast is actually negative velocity, because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going the wrong way.</p>
<p>And so how do you stay agile?</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s going to throw all kinds of chaos at you.</p>
<p>Be nimble.</p>
<p>Be able to change.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly the strategy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have everything mapped out.</p>
<p>As we wrap here, a question for both you and Claire, which is China has big assets.</p>
<p>Before you do your wrap question, can I just, can I ask him to, can you tell us the audience</p>
<p>about what you did during the UK crisis?</p>
<p>Oh, this is beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like 30 seconds about, you know.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go there like Antonio, the crazy man.</p>
<p>But what, so we started this group in 2017 called Flexport.org to do humanitarian relief</p>
<p>shipping.</p>
<p>Really, at that time, the crisis was Syria and trying to help refugees.</p>
<p>It was really a simple idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, look, we got all this stuff here.</p>
<p>We know they need stuff at the refugee camps.</p>
<p>What if we shipped it there?</p>
<p>Seemed like a radical idea.</p>
<p>We maintain a database of partners.</p>
<p>So we have agents that can operate on behalf of Flexport in over 120 countries.</p>
<p>And at that time, I simply emailed our Syria partner, who&rsquo;s literally based in Aleppo,</p>
<p>where a lot of this destruction was happening.</p>
<p>And I emailed, I said, hey, we&rsquo;d like to ship a container to this refugee camp down there.</p>
<p>And he was like, sure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the address?</p>
<p>Where do you want to ship it?</p>
<p>And I was like, wait, is that easy?</p>
<p>Like, I thought this was like, and I realized you could do that.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t ship into Syria because we didn&rsquo;t know who was going to end up in.</p>
<p>So we shipped to refugee camps in Turkey and Jordan.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been doing this now for five years, shipping to over 50 different countries,</p>
<p>any time there&rsquo;s a hurricane, earthquakes, or a war.</p>
<p>And so when we saw this happening in Ukraine, we immediately kicked into high gear.</p>
<p>The Flexport.org team has about 12 full-time people.</p>
<p>And then we have a model where employees at Flexport can surge onto that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had about 60 people working on this.</p>
<p>In this case, usually we offer pro bono shipping because shipping is expensive.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just eat the full cost.</p>
<p>We are profitable, but not enough to really solve the world&rsquo;s problems all by ourself.</p>
<p>So we created a GoFundMe campaign, partnered with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.</p>
<p>Ashton&rsquo;s an early investor in Flexport.</p>
<p>And we raised $25 million to pay for shipping to deliver goods.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>And make sure Ashton and all of our investors, a lot of great people stepped up.</p>
<p>You emailed the besties and said, hey, it&rsquo;s $4,400 a container.</p>
<p>Was that the number, $4,200 or $4,400?</p>
<p>It depends on where it&rsquo;s coming from.</p>
<p>For Ukraine, specifically.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, we shipped nine ambulances from Gibraltar into Ukraine.</p>
<p>I thought we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to ship into Ukraine because it&rsquo;s a war zone.</p>
<p>It turns out most, I don&rsquo;t know if most,</p>
<p>but a huge percentage of European truck drivers are Ukrainian.</p>
<p>And they were just like stoked to go and do this.</p>
<p>So we delivered nine ambulances.</p>
<p>That cost like around $10,000.</p>
<p>Yeah, so punchline, I replied back to him and I said, no problem.</p>
<p>And he said, hey, mention on the podcast.</p>
<p>I said, no problem.</p>
<p>And I donated a $4,400 container.</p>
<p>And then Chamath said, oh, I donated the plane that 12 containers went on.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>So it was a flex on a flex for Flexport.</p>
<p>It was like a multi-layer flex.</p>
<p>So and then it just snowballed.</p>
<p>And this hasn&rsquo;t gotten much attention, but Yuri Milner,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an early Flexport investor, just donated $100 million.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really putting pressure on their side of the stage.</p>
<p>It was a flex on a flex.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t hear the last part.</p>
<p>Anyway, keep going.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the, well, let me wrap up.</p>
<p>Everybody does what they can.</p>
<p>And it is an amazing model where, but by the way,</p>
<p>over 60,000 people donated a little bit.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m almost as just as proud of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people are getting involved, stepping up.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, hey, you can do something.</p>
<p>Flexport.org.</p>
<p>Flexport.org.</p>
<p>People go there and support causes.</p>
<p>Flexport.org.</p>
<p>Final question for you two.</p>
<p>We had this great moment where we engaged China.</p>
<p>We built a bunch of iPhones, Amazon Basics, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Nike shoes.</p>
<p>And it raised the standard of living for a lot of people.</p>
<p>We understand China is doing this now.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing it in Africa and some other places.</p>
<p>What are you seeing in terms of that relationship?</p>
<p>How China is looking towards other countries to become</p>
<p>producers of goods.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re kind of now becoming incredibly influential.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their intent?</p>
<p>And how is that going?</p>
<p>Claire, maybe you could start.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big question.</p>
<p>But I think this is a long-term play.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all in this for a long-term play.</p>
<p>And whether you take maybe the spicier view around resources</p>
<p>and protectionism versus one that&rsquo;s more just around progress.</p>
<p>And as we may have an increasingly balkanizing East</p>
<p>and West, the ability for there to control the bigger piece</p>
<p>of their own supply chain.</p>
<p>But the end result, as you&rsquo;re sort of saying,</p>
<p>is you look at places like Niger, right?</p>
<p>The average mother there is having six children.</p>
<p>We have a very young global South.</p>
<p>And the important thing is that they&rsquo;re fed, they&rsquo;re clothed,</p>
<p>and that they have an upward trajectory.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>People living in abject poverty will probably end in our lifetime.</p>
<p>You know, the only places it won&rsquo;t end is in places with dictators.</p>
<p>What are you seeing in terms of the shipping containers?</p>
<p>Because you must see shipping containers increasingly</p>
<p>leaving certain ports.</p>
<p>Where is China sort of exporting production to?</p>
<p>And what are the up-and-coming production areas?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some really interesting trends</p>
<p>going around around labor costs.</p>
<p>In China, the reason people went there over the last 40 years,</p>
<p>to be honest, was like cheap labor.</p>
<p>But over time, they became quite sophisticated.</p>
<p>They really learned how to manufacture things,</p>
<p>especially electronics.</p>
<p>If you want to make electronics, you pretty much</p>
<p>have to make them in Shenzhen, the Greater Bay Area,</p>
<p>as she called it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, but stuff that&rsquo;s just for cheap labor,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s no longer about cheap labor.</p>
<p>This is a whole supply chain ecosystem of components</p>
<p>and other things.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s just cheap labor, two years ago,</p>
<p>Mexico became cheaper than China in labor costs.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Which is a huge shift.</p>
<p>And now Mexico doesn&rsquo;t have the manufacturing capacity.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the skill sets.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, but they&rsquo;ll build it, you know.</p>
<p>And people will respond to that trend.</p>
<p>As long as it takes 120 days to ship stuff from China to the US,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t get this sorted out,</p>
<p>brands are going to respond to shipping closer to home.</p>
<p>So that is a trend that you&rsquo;re going to see more and more of,</p>
<p>if the delays stay the way they are.</p>
<p>I think China&rsquo;s big challenge is,</p>
<p>if they become labor costs too expensive,</p>
<p>how do they keep moving up the value chain?</p>
<p>And this is what their Made in China 2025 thing is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;ve got to, they&rsquo;ve got to make more</p>
<p>and more sophisticated products,</p>
<p>because it can&rsquo;t just be about dirt cheap labor.</p>
<p>Microwave disturbances.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s a huge challenge.</p>
<p>And very few, if anyone&rsquo;s really done it,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s done it at that scale,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re the biggest country in the world.</p>
<p>But Japan and Korea have kind of done that,</p>
<p>but not 10 times bigger populations.</p>
<p>India as well, moving to a services-based economy.</p>
<p>India with IT comes to mind.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll become entitled</p>
<p>and want to retire at 55 like you&rsquo;re up.</p>
<p>And by the way, my favorite answer,</p>
<p>someone at, I think it was Zuck,</p>
<p>although Toby from Shopify told me he&rsquo;s lifted this line.</p>
<p>His employees were asking him about the four-day work week.</p>
<p>And he was like, well, you know,</p>
<p>I do think we should do some experimentation</p>
<p>around how many days a week we work.</p>
<p>So, but we&rsquo;re going to start with the six-day work week,</p>
<p>like China does.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll try the four-day work week later.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in thanking.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Brian and Claire, well done.</p>
<p>The besties are gone.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
