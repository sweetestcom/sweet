    <p>The following is a conversation with Carl Friston,</p>
<p>one of the greatest neuroscientists in history.</p>
<p>Cited over 245,000 times,</p>
<p>known for many influential ideas in brain imaging,</p>
<p>neuroscience, and theoretical neurobiology,</p>
<p>including especially the fascinating idea</p>
<p>of the free energy principle for action and perception.</p>
<p>Carl&rsquo;s mix of humor, brilliance, and kindness,</p>
<p>to me, are inspiring and captivating.</p>
<p>This was a huge honor and a pleasure.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter,</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do a few minutes of ads now,</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you,</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends by Bitcoin,</p>
<p>and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to send</p>
<p>and receive money digitally,</p>
<p>let me mention a surprising fact related to physical money.</p>
<p>Of all the currency in the world,</p>
<p>roughly 8% of it is actual physical money.</p>
<p>The other 92% of money only exists digitally.</p>
<p>So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,</p>
<p>Google Play, and use the code LEXPODCAST, you get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>an organization that is helping to advance robotics</p>
<p>and STEM education for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Carl Friston.</p>
<p>How much of the human brain do we understand</p>
<p>from the low level of neuronal communication</p>
<p>to the functional level to the highest level,</p>
<p>maybe the psychiatric disorder level?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re certainly in a better position</p>
<p>than we were last century.</p>
<p>How far we&rsquo;ve got to go, I think,</p>
<p>is almost an unanswerable question.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have to set the parameters,</p>
<p>you know, what constitutes understanding, what level</p>
<p>of understanding do you want?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve made enormous progress</p>
<p>in terms of broad brush principles.</p>
<p>Whether that affords a detailed cartography</p>
<p>of the functional anatomy of the brain and what it does,</p>
<p>right down to the microcircuitry and the neurons,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably out of reach at the present time.</p>
<p>So the cartography, so mapping the brain,</p>
<p>do you think mapping of the brain,</p>
<p>the detailed, perfect imaging of it,</p>
<p>does that get us closer to understanding</p>
<p>of the mind, of the brain?</p>
<p>So how far does it get us if we have</p>
<p>that perfect cartography of the brain?</p>
<p>I think there are lower bounds on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting question.</p>
<p>And it would determine the sort of scientific career</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d pursue if you believe that knowing</p>
<p>every dendritic connection, every sort of microscopic,</p>
<p>synaptic structure right down to the molecular level</p>
<p>was gonna give you the right kind of information</p>
<p>to understand the computational anatomy,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;d choose to be a microscopist</p>
<p>and you would study little cubic millimeters of brain</p>
<p>for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>If on the other hand you were interested</p>
<p>in holistic functions and a sort of functional anatomy</p>
<p>of the sort that a neuropsychologist would understand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d study brain lesions and strokes,</p>
<p>just looking at the whole person.</p>
<p>So again, it comes back to at what level</p>
<p>do you want understanding?</p>
<p>I think there are principled reasons not to go too far.</p>
<p>If you commit to a view of the brain</p>
<p>as a machine that&rsquo;s performing a form of inference</p>
<p>and representing things, that level of understanding</p>
<p>is necessarily cast in terms of probability densities</p>
<p>and ensemble densities, distributions.</p>
<p>And what that tells you is that you don&rsquo;t really want</p>
<p>to look at the atoms to understand the thermodynamics</p>
<p>of probabilistic descriptions of how the brain works.</p>
<p>So I personally wouldn&rsquo;t look at the molecules</p>
<p>or indeed the single neurons in the same way</p>
<p>if I wanted to understand the thermodynamics</p>
<p>of some non equilibrium steady state of a gas</p>
<p>or an active material, I wouldn&rsquo;t spend my life</p>
<p>looking at the individual molecules</p>
<p>that constitute that ensemble.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d look at their collective behavior.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you go too coarse grain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna miss some basic canonical principles</p>
<p>of connectivity and architectures.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking here this bit colloquial,</p>
<p>but this current excitement about high field</p>
<p>magnetic resonance imaging at seven Tesla, why?</p>
<p>Well, it gives us for the first time the opportunity</p>
<p>to look at the brain in action at the level</p>
<p>of a few millimeters that distinguish</p>
<p>between different layers of the cortex</p>
<p>that may be very important in terms of evincing</p>
<p>generic principles of conical microcircuitry</p>
<p>that are replicated throughout the brain</p>
<p>that may tell us something fundamental</p>
<p>about message passing in the brain</p>
<p>and these density dynamics or neuronal</p>
<p>or some more population dynamics</p>
<p>that underwrite our brain function.</p>
<p>So somewhere between a millimeter and a meter.</p>
<p>Lingering for a bit on the big questions if you allow me,</p>
<p>what to use the most beautiful or surprising characteristic</p>
<p>of the human brain?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hierarchical and recursive aspect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s recurrent aspect.</p>
<p>Of the structure or of the actual</p>
<p>representation of power of the brain?</p>
<p>Well, I think one speaks to the other.</p>
<p>I was actually answering in a dull minded way</p>
<p>from the point of view of purely its anatomy</p>
<p>and its structural aspects.</p>
<p>I mean, there are many marvelous organs in the body.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take your liver for example.</p>
<p>Without it, you wouldn&rsquo;t be around for very long</p>
<p>and it does some beautiful and delicate biochemistry</p>
<p>and homeostasis and evolved with a finesse</p>
<p>that would easily parallel the brain</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have a beautiful anatomy.</p>
<p>It has a simple anatomy which is attractive</p>
<p>in a minimalist sense but it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that crafted structure of sparse connectivity</p>
<p>and that recurrence and that specialization</p>
<p>that the brain has.</p>
<p>So you said a lot of interesting terms here.</p>
<p>So the recurrence, the sparsity,</p>
<p>but you also started by saying hierarchical.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never thought of our brain as hierarchical.</p>
<p>Sort of I always thought it&rsquo;s just like a giant mess,</p>
<p>interconnected mess where it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to figure anything out.</p>
<p>But in what sense do you see the brain as hierarchical?</p>
<p>Well, I see it, it&rsquo;s not a magic soup.</p>
<p>Which of course is what I used to think</p>
<p>before I studied medicine and the like.</p>
<p>So a lot of those terms imply each other.</p>
<p>So hierarchies, if you just think about</p>
<p>the nature of a hierarchy,</p>
<p>how would you actually build one?</p>
<p>And what you would have to do is basically</p>
<p>carefully remove the right connections</p>
<p>that destroy the completely connected soups</p>
<p>that you might have in mind.</p>
<p>So a hierarchy is in and of itself defined</p>
<p>by a sparse and particular connectivity structure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not committing to any particular form of hierarchy.</p>
<p>But your sense is there is some.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>In virtue of the fact that there is a sparsity</p>
<p>of connectivity, not necessarily of a qualitative sort,</p>
<p>but certainly of a quantitative sort.</p>
<p>So it is demonstrably so that the further apart</p>
<p>two parts of the brain are,</p>
<p>the less likely they are to be wired,</p>
<p>to possess axonal processes, neuronal processes</p>
<p>that directly communicate one message</p>
<p>or messages from one part of that brain</p>
<p>to the other part of the brain.</p>
<p>So we know there&rsquo;s a sparse connectivity.</p>
<p>And furthermore, on the basis of anatomical connectivity</p>
<p>in traces studies, we know that that sparsity</p>
<p>underwrites a hierarchical and very structured</p>
<p>sort of connectivity that might be best understood</p>
<p>like a little bit like an onion.</p>
<p>There is a concentric, sometimes referred to as centripetal</p>
<p>by people like Marcel Masulam,</p>
<p>hierarchical organization to the brain.</p>
<p>So you can think of the brain as in a rough sense,</p>
<p>like an onion, and all the sensory information</p>
<p>and all the afferent outgoing messages</p>
<p>that supply commands to your muscles</p>
<p>or to your secretory organs come from the surface.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a massive exchange interface</p>
<p>with the world out there on the surface.</p>
<p>And then underneath, there&rsquo;s a little layer</p>
<p>that sits and looks at the exchange on the surface.</p>
<p>And then underneath that, there&rsquo;s a layer</p>
<p>right the way down to the very center,</p>
<p>to the deepest part of the onion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean by a hierarchical organization.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a discernible structure defined</p>
<p>by the sparsity of connections</p>
<p>that lends the architecture a hierarchical structure</p>
<p>that tells one a lot about the kinds of representations</p>
<p>and messages.</p>
<p>Coming back to your earlier question,</p>
<p>is this about the representational capacity</p>
<p>or is it about the anatomy?</p>
<p>Well, one underwrites the other.</p>
<p>If one simply thinks of the brain</p>
<p>as a message passing machine,</p>
<p>a process that is in the service of doing something,</p>
<p>then the circuitry and the connectivity</p>
<p>that shape that message passing also dictate its function.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done a lot of amazing work</p>
<p>in a lot of directions.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at one aspect of that,</p>
<p>of looking into the brain</p>
<p>and trying to study this onion structure.</p>
<p>What can we learn about the brain by imaging it?</p>
<p>Which is one way to sort of look at the anatomy of it.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, what are the methods of imaging,</p>
<p>but even bigger, what can we learn about it?</p>
<p>Right, so well, most human neuroimaging</p>
<p>that you might see in science journals</p>
<p>that speaks to the way the brain works,</p>
<p>measures brain activity over time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing to say,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re effectively looking at fluctuations</p>
<p>in neuronal responses,</p>
<p>usually in response to some sensory input</p>
<p>or some instruction, some task.</p>
<p>Not necessarily, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest</p>
<p>in just looking at the brain</p>
<p>in terms of resting state, endogenous,</p>
<p>or intrinsic activity.</p>
<p>But crucially, at every point,</p>
<p>looking at these fluctuations,</p>
<p>either induced or intrinsic in the neural activity,</p>
<p>and understanding them at two levels.</p>
<p>So normally, people would recourse</p>
<p>to two principles of brain organization</p>
<p>that are complementary.</p>
<p>One, functional specialization or segregation.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>It simply means that there are certain parts of the brain</p>
<p>that may be specialized for certain kinds of processing.</p>
<p>For example, visual motion,</p>
<p>our ability to recognize or to perceive movement</p>
<p>in the visual world.</p>
<p>And furthermore, that specialized processing</p>
<p>may be spatially or anatomically segregated,</p>
<p>leading to functional segregation.</p>
<p>Which means that if I were to compare your brain activity</p>
<p>during a period of viewing a static image,</p>
<p>and then compare that to the responses of fluctuations</p>
<p>in the brain when you were exposed to a moving image,</p>
<p>say a flying bird,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d expect to see</p>
<p>restricted, segregated differences in activity.</p>
<p>And those are basically the hotspots</p>
<p>that you see in the statistical parametric maps</p>
<p>that test for the significance of the responses</p>
<p>that are circumscribed.</p>
<p>So now, basically, we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>some people have perhaps unkindly called a neocartography.</p>
<p>This is a phrenology augmented by modern day neuroimaging,</p>
<p>basically finding blobs or bumps on the brain</p>
<p>that do this or do that,</p>
<p>and trying to understand the cartography</p>
<p>of that functional specialization.</p>
<p>So how much is there such,</p>
<p>this is such a beautiful sort of ideal to strive for.</p>
<p>We humans, scientists, would like this,</p>
<p>to hope that there&rsquo;s a beautiful structure to this</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s, like you said, there&rsquo;s segregated regions</p>
<p>that are responsible for the different function.</p>
<p>How much hope is there to find such regions</p>
<p>in terms of looking at the progress of studying the brain?</p>
<p>Oh, I think enormous progress has been made</p>
<p>in the past 20 or 30 years.</p>
<p>So this is beyond incremental.</p>
<p>At the advent of brain imaging,</p>
<p>the very notion of functional segregation</p>
<p>was just a hypothesis based upon a century,</p>
<p>if not more, of careful neuropsychology,</p>
<p>looking at people who had lost via insult</p>
<p>or traumatic brain injury particular parts of the brain,</p>
<p>and then saying, well, they can&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>or they can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>For example, losing the visual cortex</p>
<p>and not being able to see,</p>
<p>or losing particular parts of the visual cortex</p>
<p>or regions known as V5</p>
<p>or the middle temporal region, MT,</p>
<p>and noticing that they selectively</p>
<p>could not see moving things.</p>
<p>And so that created the hypothesis</p>
<p>that perhaps visual movement processing</p>
<p>was located in this functionally segregated area.</p>
<p>And you could then go and put invasive electrodes</p>
<p>in animal models and say, yes, indeed,</p>
<p>we can excite activity here.</p>
<p>We can form receptive fields that are sensitive to</p>
<p>or defined in terms of visual motion.</p>
<p>But at no point could you exclude the possibility</p>
<p>that everywhere else in the brain</p>
<p>was also very interested in visual motion.</p>
<p>By the way, I apologize to interrupt,</p>
<p>but a tiny little tangent.</p>
<p>You said animal models, just out of curiosity,</p>
<p>from your perspective, how different is the human brain</p>
<p>versus the other animals</p>
<p>in terms of our ability to study the brain?</p>
<p>Well, clearly, the further away you go from a human brain,</p>
<p>the greater the differences,</p>
<p>but not as remarkable as you might think.</p>
<p>So people will choose their level of approximation</p>
<p>to the human brain,</p>
<p>depending upon the kinds of questions</p>
<p>that they want to answer.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re talking about sort of canonical principles</p>
<p>of microcircuitry, it might be perfectly okay</p>
<p>to look at a mouse, indeed.</p>
<p>You could even look at flies, worms.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you wanted to look at</p>
<p>the finer details of organization of visual cortex</p>
<p>and V1, V2, these are designated patches of cortex</p>
<p>that may do different things, indeed, do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably want to use a primate</p>
<p>that looked a little bit more like a human,</p>
<p>because there are lots of ethical issues</p>
<p>in terms of the use of nonhuman primates</p>
<p>to answer questions about human anatomy.</p>
<p>But I think most people assume</p>
<p>that most of the important principles are conserved</p>
<p>in a continuous way, right from, well, yes,</p>
<p>worms right through to you and me.</p>
<p>So now returning to, so that was the early sort of ideas</p>
<p>of studying the functional regions of the brain</p>
<p>by if there&rsquo;s some damage to it,</p>
<p>to try to infer that that part of the brain</p>
<p>might be somewhat responsible for this type of function.</p>
<p>So where does that lead us?</p>
<p>What are the next steps beyond that?</p>
<p>Right, well, I&rsquo;ll just actually just reverse a bit,</p>
<p>come back to your sort of notion</p>
<p>that the brain is a magic soup.</p>
<p>That was actually a very prominent idea at one point,</p>
<p>notions such as Lashley&rsquo;s law of mass action</p>
<p>inherited from the observation that for certain animals,</p>
<p>if you just took out spoonfuls of the brain,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t matter where you took these spoonfuls out,</p>
<p>they always showed the same kinds of deficits.</p>
<p>So it was very difficult to infer functional specialization</p>
<p>purely on the basis of lesion deficit studies.</p>
<p>But once we had the opportunity</p>
<p>to look at the brain lighting up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s literally it&rsquo;s sort of excitement, neuronal excitement</p>
<p>when looking at this versus that,</p>
<p>one was able to say, yes, indeed,</p>
<p>these functionally specialized responses</p>
<p>are very restricted and they&rsquo;re here or they&rsquo;re over there.</p>
<p>If I do this, then this part of the brain lights up.</p>
<p>And that became doable in the early 90s.</p>
<p>In fact, shortly before with the advent</p>
<p>of positron emission tomography.</p>
<p>And then functional magnetic resonance imaging</p>
<p>came along in the early 90s.</p>
<p>And since that time, there has been an explosion</p>
<p>of discovery, refinement, confirmation.</p>
<p>There are people who believe that it&rsquo;s all in the anatomy.</p>
<p>If you understand the anatomy,</p>
<p>then you understand the function at some level.</p>
<p>And many, many hypotheses were predicated</p>
<p>on a deep understanding of the anatomy and the connectivity,</p>
<p>but they were all confirmed</p>
<p>and taken much further with neuroimaging.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I meant by we&rsquo;ve made an enormous amount</p>
<p>of progress in this century indeed,</p>
<p>and in relation to the previous century,</p>
<p>by looking at these functionally selective responses.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the whole story.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this sort of near phrenology,</p>
<p>but finding bumps and hot spots in the brain</p>
<p>that did this or that.</p>
<p>The bigger question was, of course,</p>
<p>the functional integration.</p>
<p>How all of these regionally specific responses</p>
<p>were orchestrated, how they were distributed,</p>
<p>how did they relate to distributed processing</p>
<p>and indeed representations in the brain.</p>
<p>So then you turn to the more challenging issue</p>
<p>of the integration, the connectivity.</p>
<p>And then we come back to this beautiful,</p>
<p>sparse, recurrent, hierarchical connectivity</p>
<p>that seems characteristic of the brain</p>
<p>and probably not many other organs.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, we come back to this challenge</p>
<p>of trying to figure out how everything is integrated.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s your feeling?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the general consensus?</p>
<p>Have we moved away from the magic soup view of the brain?</p>
<p>So there is a deep structure to it.</p>
<p>And then maybe a further question.</p>
<p>You said some people believe that the structure</p>
<p>is most of it, that you can really get</p>
<p>at the core of the function</p>
<p>by just deeply understanding the structure.</p>
<p>Where do you sit on that, do you?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s got some mileage to it, yes, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a worthy pursuit of going,</p>
<p>of studying through imaging and all the different methods</p>
<p>to actually study the structure.</p>
<p>No, absolutely, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m just noting, you were accusing me</p>
<p>of using lots of long words</p>
<p>and then you introduced one there, which is deep,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>Because deep is the sort of millennial equivalent</p>
<p>of hierarchical.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve put deep in front of anything,</p>
<p>not only are you very millennial and very trending,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also implying a hierarchical architecture.</p>
<p>So it is a depth, which is, for me, the beautiful thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the word deep kind of,</p>
<p>yeah, exactly, it implies hierarchy.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even think about that.</p>
<p>That indeed, the implicit meaning</p>
<p>of the word deep is hierarchy.</p>
<p>Yep. Yeah.</p>
<p>So deep inside the onion is the center of your soul.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>Maybe briefly, if you could paint a picture</p>
<p>of the kind of methods of neuroimaging,</p>
<p>maybe the history which you were a part of,</p>
<p>from statistical parametric mapping.</p>
<p>I mean, just what&rsquo;s out there that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>for people maybe outside the field</p>
<p>to understand of what are the actual methodologies</p>
<p>of looking inside the human brain?</p>
<p>Right, well, you can answer that question</p>
<p>from two perspectives.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s the modality.</p>
<p>What kind of signal are you measuring?</p>
<p>And they can range from,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s limit ourselves</p>
<p>to sort of imaging based noninvasive techniques.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve essentially got brain scanners,</p>
<p>and brain scanners can either measure</p>
<p>the structural attributes, the amount of water,</p>
<p>the amount of fat, or the amount of iron</p>
<p>in different parts of the brain,</p>
<p>and you can make lots of inferences</p>
<p>about the structure of the organ of the sort</p>
<p>that you might have produced from an X ray,</p>
<p>but a very nuanced X ray that is looking</p>
<p>at this kind of property or that kind of property.</p>
<p>So looking at the anatomy noninvasively</p>
<p>would be the first sort of neuroimaging</p>
<p>that people might want to employ.</p>
<p>Then you move on to the kinds of measurements</p>
<p>that reflect dynamic function,</p>
<p>and the most prevalent of those fall into two camps.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got these metabolic, sometimes hemodynamic,</p>
<p>blood related signals.</p>
<p>So these metabolic and or hemodynamic signals</p>
<p>are basically proxies for elevated activity</p>
<p>and message passing and neuronal dynamics</p>
<p>in particular parts of the brain.</p>
<p>Characteristically though, the time constants</p>
<p>of these hemodynamic or metabolic responses</p>
<p>to neural activity are much longer</p>
<p>than the neural activity itself.</p>
<p>And this is referring,</p>
<p>forgive me for the dumb questions,</p>
<p>but this would be referring to blood,</p>
<p>like the flow of blood.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a ton of,</p>
<p>it seems like there&rsquo;s a ton of blood vessels in the brain.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the interaction between the flow of blood</p>
<p>and the function of the neurons?</p>
<p>Is there an interplay there or?</p>
<p>Yup, yup, and that interplay accounts for several careers</p>
<p>of world renowned scientists, yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>So this is known as neurovascular coupling,</p>
<p>is exactly what you said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how does the neural activity,</p>
<p>the neuronal infrastructure, the actual message passing</p>
<p>that we think underlies our capacity to perceive and act,</p>
<p>how is that coupled to the vascular responses</p>
<p>that supply the energy for that neural processing?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a delicate web of large vessels,</p>
<p>arteries and veins, that gets progressively finer</p>
<p>and finer in detail until it perfuses</p>
<p>at a microscopic level,</p>
<p>the machinery where little neurons lie.</p>
<p>So coming back to this sort of onion perspective,</p>
<p>we were talking before using the onion as a metaphor</p>
<p>for a deep hierarchical structure,</p>
<p>but also I think it&rsquo;s just anatomically quite</p>
<p>a useful metaphor.</p>
<p>All the action, all the heavy lifting</p>
<p>in terms of neural computation is done</p>
<p>on the surface of the brain,</p>
<p>and then the interior of the brain is constituted</p>
<p>by fatty wires, essentially, axonal processes</p>
<p>that are enshrouded by myelin sheaths.</p>
<p>And these, when you dissect them, they look fatty and white,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s called white matter,</p>
<p>as opposed to the actual neuro pill,</p>
<p>which does the computation constituted largely by neurons,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s known as gray matter.</p>
<p>So the gray matter is a surface or a skin</p>
<p>that sits on top of this big ball,</p>
<p>now we are talking magic soup,</p>
<p>but a big ball of connections like spaghetti,</p>
<p>very carefully structured with sparse connectivity</p>
<p>that preserves this deep hierarchical structure,</p>
<p>but all the action takes place on the surface,</p>
<p>on the cortex of the onion, and that means</p>
<p>that you have to supply the right amount of blood flow,</p>
<p>the right amount of nutrient,</p>
<p>which is rapidly absorbed and used by neural cells</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have the same capacity</p>
<p>that your leg muscles would have</p>
<p>to basically spend their energy budget</p>
<p>and then claim it back later.</p>
<p>So one peculiar thing about cerebral metabolism,</p>
<p>brain metabolism, is it really needs to be driven</p>
<p>in the moment, which means you basically</p>
<p>have to turn on the taps.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s lots of neural activity</p>
<p>in one part of the brain, a little patch</p>
<p>of a few millimeters, even less possibly,</p>
<p>you really do have to water that piece</p>
<p>of the garden now and quickly,</p>
<p>and by quickly I mean within a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>So that contains a lot of, hence the imaging</p>
<p>could tell you a story of what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Absolutely, but it is slightly compromised</p>
<p>in terms of the resolution.</p>
<p>So the deployment of these little microvessels</p>
<p>that water the garden to enable the neural activity</p>
<p>to play out, the spatial resolution</p>
<p>is in order of a few millimeters,</p>
<p>and crucially, the temporal resolution</p>
<p>is the order of a few seconds.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t get right down and dirty</p>
<p>into the actual spatial and temporal scale</p>
<p>of neural activity in and of itself.</p>
<p>To do that, you&rsquo;d have to turn</p>
<p>to the other big imaging modality,</p>
<p>which is the recording of electromagnetic signals</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re generated in real time.</p>
<p>So here, the temporal bandwidth, if you like,</p>
<p>or the low limit on the temporal resolution</p>
<p>is incredibly small, talking about milliseconds.</p>
<p>And then you can get into the phasic fast responses</p>
<p>that is in and of itself the neural activity,</p>
<p>and start to see the succession or cascade</p>
<p>of hierarchical recurrent message passing</p>
<p>evoked by a particular stimulus.</p>
<p>But the problem is you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at electromagnetic signals that have passed</p>
<p>through an enormous amount of magic soup</p>
<p>or spaghetti of collectivity, and through the scalp</p>
<p>and the skull, and it&rsquo;s become spatially very diffuse.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very difficult to know where you are.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this sort of catch 22.</p>
<p>You can either use an imaging modality</p>
<p>that tells you within millimeters</p>
<p>which part of the brain is activated,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know when,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve got these electromagnetic EEG, MEG setups</p>
<p>that tell you to within a few milliseconds</p>
<p>when something has responded, but you&rsquo;re not aware.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got these two complementary measures,</p>
<p>either indirect via the blood flow,</p>
<p>or direct via the electromagnetic signals</p>
<p>caused by neural activity.</p>
<p>These are the two big imaging devices.</p>
<p>And then the second level of responding to your question,</p>
<p>what are the, from the outside,</p>
<p>what are the big ways of using this technology?</p>
<p>So once you&rsquo;ve chosen the kind of neural imaging</p>
<p>that you want to use to answer your set questions,</p>
<p>and sometimes it would have to be both,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got a whole raft of analyses,</p>
<p>time series analyses usually, that you can bring to bear</p>
<p>in order to answer your questions</p>
<p>or address your hypothesis about those data.</p>
<p>And interestingly, they both fall</p>
<p>into the same two camps we were talking about before,</p>
<p>this dialectic between specialization and integration,</p>
<p>differentiation and integration.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the cartography, the blobology analyses.</p>
<p>I apologize, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t interrupt so much,</p>
<p>but just heard a fun word, the blah.</p>
<p>Blobology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a neologism, which means the study of blobs.</p>
<p>So nothing bob.</p>
<p>Are you being witty and humorous,</p>
<p>or does the word blobology ever appear</p>
<p>in a textbook somewhere?</p>
<p>It would appear in a popular book.</p>
<p>It would not appear in a worthy specialist journal.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fond word for the study of literally little blobs</p>
<p>on brain maps showing activations.</p>
<p>So the kind of thing that you&rsquo;d see in the newspapers</p>
<p>on ABC or BBC reporting the latest finding</p>
<p>from brain imaging.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, the maths involved</p>
<p>in that stream of analysis does actually call upon</p>
<p>the mathematics of blobs.</p>
<p>So seriously, they&rsquo;re actually called Euler characteristics</p>
<p>and they have a lot of fancy names in mathematics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it, about your ideas</p>
<p>in free energy principle.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s echoes of blobs there</p>
<p>when you consider sort of entities,</p>
<p>mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, circumscribed, well defined,</p>
<p>you entities of, well, from the free energy point of view,</p>
<p>entities of anything, but from the point of view</p>
<p>of the analysis, the cartography of the brain,</p>
<p>these are the entities that constitute the evidence</p>
<p>for this functional segregation.</p>
<p>You have segregated this function in this blob</p>
<p>and it is not outside of the blob.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically the, if you were a map maker</p>
<p>of America and you did not know its structure,</p>
<p>the first thing were you doing constituting</p>
<p>or creating a map would be to identify the cities,</p>
<p>for example, or the mountains or the rivers.</p>
<p>All of these uniquely spatially localizable features,</p>
<p>possibly topological features have to be placed somewhere</p>
<p>because that requires a mathematics of identifying</p>
<p>what does a city look like on a satellite image</p>
<p>or what does a river look like</p>
<p>or what does a mountain look like?</p>
<p>What would it, you know, what data features</p>
<p>would evidence that particular top,</p>
<p>you know, that particular thing</p>
<p>that you wanted to put on the map?</p>
<p>And they normally are characterized</p>
<p>in terms of literally these blobs</p>
<p>or these sort of, another way of looking at this</p>
<p>is that a certain statistical measure</p>
<p>of the degree of activation crosses a threshold</p>
<p>and in crossing that threshold</p>
<p>in the spatially restricted part of the brain,</p>
<p>it creates a blob.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s basically what statistical parametric mapping does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically mathematically finessed blobology.</p>
<p>Okay, so those are the,</p>
<p>you kind of described these two methodologies for,</p>
<p>one is temporally noisy, one is spatially noisy</p>
<p>and you kind of have to play and figure out</p>
<p>what can be useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be great if you can sort of comment.</p>
<p>I got a chance recently to spend a day</p>
<p>at a company called Neuralink</p>
<p>that uses brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>and their dream is to, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of sort of dreams,</p>
<p>but one of them is to understand the brain</p>
<p>by sort of, you know, getting in there</p>
<p>past the so called sort of factory wall,</p>
<p>getting in there and be able to listen,</p>
<p>communicate both directions.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this,</p>
<p>the future of this kind of technology</p>
<p>of brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>to be able to now have a window</p>
<p>or direct contact within the brain</p>
<p>to be able to measure some of the signals,</p>
<p>to be able to sense signals,</p>
<p>to understand some of the functionality of the brain?</p>
<p>Ambivalent, my sense is ambivalent.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a mixture of good and bad</p>
<p>and I acknowledge that freely.</p>
<p>So the good bits, if you just look at the legacy</p>
<p>of that kind of reciprocal but invasive</p>
<p>your brain stimulation,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t paint a complete picture</p>
<p>when I was talking about sort of the ways</p>
<p>we understand the brain prior to neuroimaging.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just lesion deficit studies.</p>
<p>Some of the early work, in fact,</p>
<p>literally 100 years from where we&rsquo;re sitting</p>
<p>at the institution of neurology,</p>
<p>was done by stimulating the brain of say dogs</p>
<p>and looking at how they responded</p>
<p>with their muscles or with their salivation</p>
<p>and imputing what that part of the brain must be doing.</p>
<p>If I stimulate it and I vote this kind of response,</p>
<p>then that tells me quite a lot</p>
<p>about the functional specialization.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a long history of brain stimulation</p>
<p>which continues to enjoy a lot of attention nowadays.</p>
<p>Positive attention.</p>
<p>Oh yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, deep brain stimulation for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>is now a standard treatment</p>
<p>and also a wonderful vehicle</p>
<p>to try and understand the neuronal dynamics</p>
<p>underlying movement disorders like Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>Even interest in magnetic stimulation,</p>
<p>stimulating the magnetic fields</p>
<p>and will it work in people who are depressed, for example.</p>
<p>Quite a crude level of understanding what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but there is historical evidence</p>
<p>that these kinds of brute force interventions</p>
<p>do change things.</p>
<p>They, you know, it&rsquo;s a little bit like banging the TV</p>
<p>when the valves aren&rsquo;t working properly,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still, it works.</p>
<p>So, you know, there is a long history.</p>
<p>Brain computer interfacing or BCI,</p>
<p>I think is a beautiful example of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of carved out its own niche</p>
<p>and its own aspirations</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ve been enormous advances within limits.</p>
<p>Advances in terms of our ability to understand</p>
<p>how the brain, the embodied brain,</p>
<p>engages with the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking here of sensory substitution,</p>
<p>the augmenting our sensory capacities</p>
<p>by giving ourselves extra ways of sensing</p>
<p>and sampling the world,</p>
<p>ranging from sort of trying to replace lost visual signals</p>
<p>through to giving people completely new signals.</p>
<p>So, one of the, I think, most engaging examples of this</p>
<p>is equipping people with a sense of magnetic fields.</p>
<p>So you can actually give them magnetic sensors</p>
<p>that enable them to feel,</p>
<p>should we say, tactile pressure around their tummy,</p>
<p>where they are in relation to the magnetic field of the Earth.</p>
<p>And after a few weeks, they take it for granted.</p>
<p>They integrate it, they embody this,</p>
<p>simulate this new sensory information</p>
<p>into the way that they literally feel their world,</p>
<p>but now equipped with this sense of magnetic direction.</p>
<p>So that tells you something</p>
<p>about the brain&rsquo;s plastic potential</p>
<p>to remodel and its plastic capacity</p>
<p>to suddenly try to explain the sensory data at hand</p>
<p>by augmenting the sensory sphere</p>
<p>and the kinds of things that you can measure.</p>
<p>Clearly, that&rsquo;s purely for entertainment</p>
<p>and understanding the nature and the power of our brains.</p>
<p>I would imagine that most BCI is pitched</p>
<p>at solving clinical and human problems</p>
<p>such as locked in syndrome, such as paraplegia,</p>
<p>or replacing lost sensory capacities</p>
<p>like blindness and deafness.</p>
<p>So then we come to the negative part of my ambivalence,</p>
<p>the other side of it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to be deflationary</p>
<p>because much of my deflationary comments</p>
<p>is probably large out of ignorance than anything else.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, the bandwidth</p>
<p>and the bit rates that you get</p>
<p>from brain computer interfaces as we currently know them,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about bits per second.</p>
<p>So that would be like me only being able to communicate</p>
<p>with any world or with you using very, very, very slow Morse code.</p>
<p>And it is not even within an order of magnitude</p>
<p>near what we actually need for an inactive realization</p>
<p>of what people aspire to when they think about</p>
<p>sort of curing people with paraplegia or replacing sight</p>
<p>despite heroic efforts.</p>
<p>So one has to ask, is there a lower bound</p>
<p>on the kinds of recurrent information exchange</p>
<p>between a brain and some augmented or artificial interface?</p>
<p>And then we come back to, interestingly,</p>
<p>what I was talking about before,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re talking about function</p>
<p>in terms of inference, and I presume we&rsquo;ll get to that</p>
<p>later on in terms of the free energy principle,</p>
<p>then at the moment, there may be fundamental reasons</p>
<p>to assume that is the case.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about ensemble activity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about basically, for example,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s paint the challenge facing brain computer interfacing</p>
<p>in terms of controlling another system</p>
<p>that is highly and deeply structured,</p>
<p>very relevant to our lives, very nonlinear,</p>
<p>that rests upon the kind of nonequilibrium</p>
<p>steady states and dynamics that the brain does,</p>
<p>the weather, all right?</p>
<p>So imagine you had some very aggressive satellites</p>
<p>that could produce signals that could perturb</p>
<p>some little parts of the weather system.</p>
<p>And then what you&rsquo;re asking now is,</p>
<p>can I meaningfully get into the weather</p>
<p>and change it meaningfully and make the weather respond</p>
<p>in a way that I want it to?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about chaos control on a scale</p>
<p>which is almost unimaginable.</p>
<p>So there may be fundamental reasons</p>
<p>why BCI, as you might read about it in a science fiction novel,</p>
<p>aspirational BCI may never actually work</p>
<p>in the sense that to really be integrated</p>
<p>and be part of the system is a requirement</p>
<p>that requires you to have evolved with that system,</p>
<p>that you have to be part of a very delicately structured,</p>
<p>deeply structured, dynamic, ensemble activity</p>
<p>that is not like rewiring a broken computer</p>
<p>or plugging in a peripheral interface adapter.</p>
<p>It is much more like getting into the weather patterns</p>
<p>or, come back to your magic soup,</p>
<p>getting into the active matter</p>
<p>and meaningfully relate that to the outside world.</p>
<p>So I think there are enormous challenges there.</p>
<p>So I think the example of the weather is a brilliant one.</p>
<p>And I think you paint a really interesting picture</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t as negative as I thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially saying that it might be</p>
<p>incredibly challenging, including the low bound</p>
<p>of the bandwidth and so on.</p>
<p>I kind of, so just to full disclosure,</p>
<p>I come from the machine learning world.</p>
<p>So my natural thought is the hardest part</p>
<p>is the engineering challenge of controlling the weather,</p>
<p>of getting those satellites up and running and so on.</p>
<p>And once they are, then the rest is fundamentally</p>
<p>the same approaches that allow you to win in the game of Go</p>
<p>will allow you to potentially play in this soup,</p>
<p>in this chaos.</p>
<p>So I have a hope that sort of machine learning methods</p>
<p>will help us play in this soup.</p>
<p>But perhaps you&rsquo;re right that it is a biology</p>
<p>and the brain is just an incredible system</p>
<p>that may be almost impossible to get in.</p>
<p>But for me, what seems impossible</p>
<p>is the incredible mess of blood vessels</p>
<p>that you also described without,</p>
<p>we also value the brain.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t make any mistakes, you can&rsquo;t damage things.</p>
<p>So to me, that engineering challenge seems nearly impossible.</p>
<p>One of the things I was really impressed by at Neuralink</p>
<p>is just talking to brilliant neurosurgeons</p>
<p>and the roboticists that made me realize</p>
<p>that even though it seems impossible,</p>
<p>if anyone can do it, it&rsquo;s some of these world class</p>
<p>engineers that are trying to take it on.</p>
<p>So I think the conclusion of our discussion here</p>
<p>of this part is basically that the problem is really hard</p>
<p>but hopefully not impossible.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s okay, let&rsquo;s start with the basics.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve also formulated a fascinating principle,</p>
<p>the free energy principle.</p>
<p>Could we maybe start at the basics</p>
<p>and what is the free energy principle?</p>
<p>Well, in fact, the free energy principle</p>
<p>inherits a lot from the building</p>
<p>of these data analytic approaches</p>
<p>to these very high dimensional time series</p>
<p>you get from the brain.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s interesting to acknowledge that.</p>
<p>And in particular, the analysis tools</p>
<p>that try to address the other side,</p>
<p>which is a functional integration,</p>
<p>so the connectivity analyses.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, but I should also acknowledge</p>
<p>it inherits an awful lot from machine learning as well.</p>
<p>So the free energy principle is just a formal statement</p>
<p>that the existential imperatives for any system</p>
<p>that manages to survive in a changing world</p>
<p>can be cast as an inference problem</p>
<p>in the sense that you can interpret</p>
<p>the probability of existing as the evidence that you exist.</p>
<p>And if you can write down that problem of existence</p>
<p>as a statistical problem,</p>
<p>then you can use all the maths that has been developed</p>
<p>for inference to understand and characterize</p>
<p>the ensemble dynamics that must be in play</p>
<p>in the service of that inference.</p>
<p>So technically, what that means is</p>
<p>you can always interpret anything that exists</p>
<p>in virtue of being separate from the environment</p>
<p>in which it exists as trying to minimize</p>
<p>variational free energy.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re from the machine learning community,</p>
<p>you will know that as a negative evidence lower bound</p>
<p>or a negative elbow, which is the same as saying</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to maximize or it will look as if</p>
<p>all your dynamics are trying to maximize</p>
<p>the complement of that which is the marginal likelihood</p>
<p>or the evidence for your own existence.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s basically the free energy principle.</p>
<p>But to even take a sort of a small step backwards,</p>
<p>you said the existential imperative.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of beautiful poetic words here,</p>
<p>but to put it crudely, it&rsquo;s a fascinating idea</p>
<p>of basically just of trying to describe</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re looking at a blob,</p>
<p>how do you know this thing is alive?</p>
<p>What does it mean to be alive?</p>
<p>What does it mean to exist?</p>
<p>And so you can look at the brain,</p>
<p>you can look at parts of the brain,</p>
<p>or this is just a general principle</p>
<p>that applies to almost any system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a fascinating sort of philosophically</p>
<p>at every level question and a methodology</p>
<p>to try to answer that question.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be alive?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a huge endeavor and it&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s at least some,</p>
<p>from some perspective, a clean answer.</p>
<p>So maybe can you talk about that optimization view of it?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s trying to be minimized, maximized?</p>
<p>A system that&rsquo;s alive, what is it trying to minimize?</p>
<p>Right, you&rsquo;ve made a big move there.</p>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s good to make big moves.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve assumed that the thing exists</p>
<p>in a state that could be living or nonliving.</p>
<p>So I may ask you, what licenses you</p>
<p>to say that something exists?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I use the word existential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond living, it&rsquo;s just existence.</p>
<p>So if you drill down onto the definition</p>
<p>of things that exist, then they have certain properties</p>
<p>if you borrow the maths</p>
<p>from nonequilibrium steady state physics</p>
<p>that enable you to interpret their existence</p>
<p>in terms of this optimization procedure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s good you introduced the word optimization.</p>
<p>So what the free energy principle</p>
<p>in its sort of most ambitious,</p>
<p>but also most deflationary and simplest, says</p>
<p>is that if something exists,</p>
<p>then it must, by the mathematics</p>
<p>of nonequilibrium steady state,</p>
<p>exhibit properties that make it look</p>
<p>as if it is optimizing a particular quantity.</p>
<p>And it turns out that particular quantity</p>
<p>happens to be exactly the same</p>
<p>as the evidence lower bound in machine learning</p>
<p>or Bayesian model evidence in Bayesian statistics.</p>
<p>Or, and then I can list a whole other list</p>
<p>of ways of understanding this key quantity,</p>
<p>which is a bound on surprise or self information</p>
<p>if you have information theory.</p>
<p>There are a number of different perspectives</p>
<p>on this quantity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just basically the log probability</p>
<p>of being in a particular state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling this story as an honest,</p>
<p>an attempt to answer your question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m answering it as if I was pretending</p>
<p>to be a physicist who was trying to understand</p>
<p>the fundaments of nonequilibrium steady state.</p>
<p>And I shouldn&rsquo;t really be doing that</p>
<p>because the last time I was taught physics,</p>
<p>I was in my 20s.</p>
<p>What kind of systems,</p>
<p>when you think about the free energy principle,</p>
<p>what kind of systems are you imagining</p>
<p>as a sort of more specific kind of case study?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m imagining a range of systems,</p>
<p>but at its simplest, a single celled organism</p>
<p>that can be identified from its eco niche</p>
<p>or its environment.</p>
<p>So at its simplest, that&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>what I always imagined in my head.</p>
<p>And you may ask, well, is there any,</p>
<p>how on earth can you even elaborate questions</p>
<p>about the existence of a single drop of oil, for example?</p>
<p>But there are deep questions there.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the oil, why doesn&rsquo;t the thing,</p>
<p>the interface between the drop of oil</p>
<p>that contains an interior</p>
<p>and the thing that is not the drop of oil,</p>
<p>which is the solvent in which it is immersed,</p>
<p>how does that interface persist over time?</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the oil just dissolve into solvent?</p>
<p>So what special properties of the exchange</p>
<p>between the surface of the oil drop</p>
<p>and the external states in which it&rsquo;s immersed,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a physicist, say it would be the heat bath.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a physical system, an ensemble again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about density dynamics, ensemble dynamics,</p>
<p>an ensemble of atoms or molecules immersed in the heat bath.</p>
<p>But the question is, how did the heat bath get there?</p>
<p>And why does it not dissolve?</p>
<p>How is it maintaining itself?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What actions is it?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil</p>
<p>and I guess it would dissolve in water,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t dissolve in water.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>Precisely, so why not?</p>
<p>So why not?</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>And how do you mathematically describe,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such a beautiful idea.</p>
<p>And also the idea of like, where does the thing,</p>
<p>where does the drop of oil end and where does it begin?</p>
<p>Right, so I mean, you&rsquo;re asking deep questions,</p>
<p>deep in a nonmillennial sense here.</p>
<p>In a hierarchical sense.</p>
<p>But what you can do, so this is the deflationary part of it.</p>
<p>Can I just qualify my answer by saying that normally</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m asked this question,</p>
<p>I answer from the point of view of a psychologist,</p>
<p>we talk about predictive processing and predictive coding</p>
<p>and the brain as an inference machine,</p>
<p>but you haven&rsquo;t asked me from that perspective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m answering from the point of view of a physicist.</p>
<p>So the question is not so much why,</p>
<p>but if it exists, what properties must it display?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the deflationary part of the free energy principle.</p>
<p>The free energy principle does not supply an answer</p>
<p>as to why, it&rsquo;s saying if something exists,</p>
<p>then it must display these properties.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of thing that&rsquo;s on offer.</p>
<p>And it so happens that these properties it must display</p>
<p>are actually intriguing and have this inferential gloss,</p>
<p>this sort of self evidencing gloss that inherits on the fact</p>
<p>that the very preservation of the boundary</p>
<p>between the oil drop and the not oil drop</p>
<p>requires an optimization of a particular function</p>
<p>or a functional that defines the presence</p>
<p>or the existence of this oil drop,</p>
<p>which is why I started with existential imperatives.</p>
<p>It is a necessary condition for existence</p>
<p>that this must occur because the boundary</p>
<p>basically defines the thing that&rsquo;s existing.</p>
<p>So it is that self assembly aspect</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that you were hinting at in biology,</p>
<p>sometimes known as autopoiesis</p>
<p>in computational chemistry with self assembly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, what does it look like?</p>
<p>Sorry, how would you describe things</p>
<p>that configure themselves out of nothing?</p>
<p>The way they clearly demarcate themselves</p>
<p>from the states or the soup in which they are immersed.</p>
<p>So from the point of view of computational chemistry,</p>
<p>for example, you would just understand that</p>
<p>as a configuration of a macro molecule</p>
<p>to minimize its free energy, its thermodynamic free energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly the same principle that we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>that thermodynamic free energy is just the negative elbow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same mathematical construct.</p>
<p>So the very emergence of existence, of structure, of form</p>
<p>that can be distinguished from the environment</p>
<p>or the thing that is not the thing</p>
<p>necessitates the existence of an objective function</p>
<p>that it looks as if it is minimizing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s finding a free energy minima.</p>
<p>And so just to clarify, I&rsquo;m trying to wrap my head around.</p>
<p>So the free energy principle says that if something exists,</p>
<p>these are the properties it should display.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what that means is we can&rsquo;t just look,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t just go into a soup and there&rsquo;s no mechanism.</p>
<p>Free energy principle doesn&rsquo;t give us a mechanism</p>
<p>to find the things that exist.</p>
<p>Is that what&rsquo;s implying, is being implied</p>
<p>that you can kind of use it to reason,</p>
<p>to think about like, study a particular system</p>
<p>and say, does this exhibit these qualities?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent question.</p>
<p>But to answer that, I&rsquo;d have to return</p>
<p>to your previous question about what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between living and nonliving things.</p>
<p>Yes, well, actually, sorry.</p>
<p>So yeah, maybe we can go there.</p>
<p>Maybe we can go there, you kind of drew a line</p>
<p>and forgive me for the stupid questions,</p>
<p>but you kind of drew a line between living and existing.</p>
<p>Is there an interesting sort of distinction?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there is.</p>
<p>So things do exist, grains of sand,</p>
<p>rocks on the moon, trees, you.</p>
<p>So all of these things can be separated from the environment</p>
<p>in which they are immersed.</p>
<p>And therefore, they must at some level</p>
<p>be optimizing their free energy,</p>
<p>taking this sort of model evidence interpretation</p>
<p>of this quantity that basically means</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re self evidencing.</p>
<p>Another nice little twist of phrase here</p>
<p>is that you are your own existence proof,</p>
<p>statistically speaking, which I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>I said that, somebody did, but I love that phrase.</p>
<p>You are your own existence proof.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s so existential, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to think about that for a few days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful line.</p>
<p>So the step through to answer your question</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s it good for,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go along the following lines.</p>
<p>First of all, you have to define what it means</p>
<p>to exist, which now, as you&rsquo;ve rightly pointed out,</p>
<p>you have to define what probabilistic properties</p>
<p>must the states of something possess</p>
<p>so it knows where it finishes.</p>
<p>And then you write that down in terms</p>
<p>of statistical dependencies, again, sparsity.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s connected or what&rsquo;s correlated</p>
<p>or what depends upon, it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s not correlated</p>
<p>and what doesn&rsquo;t depend upon something.</p>
<p>Again, it comes down to the deep structures,</p>
<p>not in this instance, hierarchical,</p>
<p>but the structures that emerge</p>
<p>from removing connectivity and dependency.</p>
<p>And in this instance, basically being able</p>
<p>to identify the surface of the oil drop</p>
<p>from the water in which it is immersed.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you start to realize,</p>
<p>well, there are actually four kinds of states</p>
<p>in any given universe that contains anything.</p>
<p>The things that are internal to the surface,</p>
<p>the things that are external to the surface</p>
<p>and the surface in and of itself,</p>
<p>which is why I use a metaphor,</p>
<p>a little single celled organism</p>
<p>that has an interior and exterior</p>
<p>and then the surface of the cell.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s mathematically a Markov blanket.</p>
<p>Just to pause, I&rsquo;m in awe of this concept</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s the stuff outside the surface,</p>
<p>stuff inside the surface and the surface itself,</p>
<p>the Markov blanket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the most beautiful kind of notion</p>
<p>about trying to explore what it means</p>
<p>to exist mathematically.</p>
<p>I apologize, it&rsquo;s just a beautiful idea.</p>
<p>But it came out of California, so that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I changed my mind.</p>
<p>I take it all back.</p>
<p>So anyway, so you were just talking</p>
<p>about the surface, about the Markov blanket.</p>
<p>So this surface or these blanket states</p>
<p>that are the, because they are now defined</p>
<p>in relation to these independencies</p>
<p>and what different states internal blanket</p>
<p>or external states can,</p>
<p>which ones can influence each other</p>
<p>and which cannot influence each other.</p>
<p>You can now apply standard results</p>
<p>that you would find in non equilibrium physics</p>
<p>or steady state or thermodynamics or hydrodynamics,</p>
<p>usually out of equilibrium solutions</p>
<p>and apply them to this partition.</p>
<p>And what it looks like is if all the normal gradient flows</p>
<p>that you would associate with any non equilibrium system</p>
<p>apply in such a way that part of the Markov blanket</p>
<p>and the internal states seem to be hill climbing</p>
<p>or doing a gradient descent on the same quantity.</p>
<p>And that means that you can now describe</p>
<p>the very existence of this oil drop.</p>
<p>You can write down the existence of this oil drop</p>
<p>in terms of flows, dynamics, equations of motion,</p>
<p>where the blanket states or part of them,</p>
<p>we call them active states and the internal states</p>
<p>now seem to be and must be trying to look</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re minimizing the same function,</p>
<p>which is a low probability of occupying these states.</p>
<p>Interesting thing is that what would they be called</p>
<p>if you were trying to describe these things?</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re talking about are internal states,</p>
<p>external states and blanket states.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s carve the blanket states</p>
<p>into two sensory states and active states.</p>
<p>Operationally, it has to be the case</p>
<p>that in order for this carving up</p>
<p>into different sets of states to exist,</p>
<p>the active states, the Markov blanket</p>
<p>cannot be influenced by the external states.</p>
<p>And we already know that the internal states</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be influenced by the external states</p>
<p>because the blanket separates them.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, it means the active states, the internal states</p>
<p>are now jointly not influenced by external states.</p>
<p>They only have autonomous dynamics.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got a picture of an oil drop</p>
<p>that has autonomy, it has autonomous states,</p>
<p>it has autonomous states in the sense</p>
<p>that there must be some parts of the surface of the oil drop</p>
<p>that are not influenced by the external states</p>
<p>and all the interior.</p>
<p>And together, those two states endow</p>
<p>even a little oil drop with autonomous states</p>
<p>that look as if they are optimizing</p>
<p>their variational free energy or their negative elbow,</p>
<p>their moral evidence.</p>
<p>And that would be an interesting intellectual exercise.</p>
<p>And you could say, you could even go into the realms</p>
<p>of panpsychism, that everything that exists</p>
<p>is implicitly making inferences on self evidencing.</p>
<p>Now we make the next move, but what about living things?</p>
<p>I mean, so let me ask you,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between an oil drop</p>
<p>and a little tadpole or a little lava or a plankton?</p>
<p>The picture was just painted of an oil drop.</p>
<p>Just immediately in a matter of minutes</p>
<p>took me into the world of panpsychism,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve just convinced me,</p>
<p>made me feel like an oil drop is a living,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly an autonomous system,</p>
<p>but almost a living system.</p>
<p>So it has sensory capabilities and acting capabilities</p>
<p>and it maintains something.</p>
<p>So what is the difference between that</p>
<p>and something that we traditionally</p>
<p>think of as a living system?</p>
<p>That it could die or it can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, mortality, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the right answer there is</p>
<p>because they can move,</p>
<p>like movement seems like an essential element</p>
<p>to being able to act in the environment,</p>
<p>but the oil drop is doing that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>The oil drop will be moved,</p>
<p>but does it in and of itself move autonomously?</p>
<p>Well, the surface is performing actions</p>
<p>that maintain its structure.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re being too clever.</p>
<p>I was, I had in mind a passive little oil drop</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sitting there at the bottom</p>
<p>on the top of a glass of water.</p>
<p>Sure, I guess.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve nailed it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s movement.</p>
<p>So where does that movement come from?</p>
<p>If it comes from the inside,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got, I think, something that&rsquo;s living.</p>
<p>What do you mean from the inside?</p>
<p>What I mean is that the internal states</p>
<p>that can influence the active states,</p>
<p>where the active states can influence,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not influenced by the external states,</p>
<p>can cause movement.</p>
<p>So there are two types of oil drops, if you like.</p>
<p>There are oil drops where the internal states</p>
<p>are so random that they average themselves away,</p>
<p>and the thing cannot, on average,</p>
<p>when you do the averaging, move.</p>
<p>So a nice example of that would be the Sun.</p>
<p>The Sun certainly has internal states.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of intrinsic autonomous activity going on,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s not coordinated,</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t have the deep, in the millennial sense,</p>
<p>the hierarchical structure that the brain does,</p>
<p>there is no overall mode or pattern or organization</p>
<p>that expresses itself on the surface</p>
<p>that allows it to actually swim.</p>
<p>It can certainly have a very active surface,</p>
<p>but en masse, at the scale of the actual surface of the Sun,</p>
<p>the average position of that surface cannot, in itself, move,</p>
<p>because the internal dynamics are more like a hot gas.</p>
<p>They are literally like a hot gas,</p>
<p>whereas your internal dynamics are much more structured</p>
<p>and deeply structured,</p>
<p>and now you can express on your active states</p>
<p>with your muscles and your secretory organs,</p>
<p>your autonomic nervous system and its effectors,</p>
<p>you can actually move, and that&rsquo;s all you can do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something which,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t thought of it like this before,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s nice to just realize</p>
<p>there is no other way that you can change the universe</p>
<p>other than simply moving.</p>
<p>Whether that moving is articulating with my voice box</p>
<p>or walking around or squeezing juices</p>
<p>out of my secretory organs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only one way you can change the universe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>And the fact that you do so nonrandomly makes you alive.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s that nonrandomness.</p>
<p>And that would be manifested,</p>
<p>we realize, in terms of essentially swimming,</p>
<p>essentially moving, changing one&rsquo;s shape,</p>
<p>a morphogenesis that is dynamic and possibly adaptive.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I was trying to get at</p>
<p>between the difference between the oil drop</p>
<p>and the little tadpole.</p>
<p>The tadpole is moving around.</p>
<p>Its active states are actually changing the external states.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s now a cycle,</p>
<p>an action perception cycle, if you like,</p>
<p>a recurrent dynamic that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>that depends upon this deeply structured autonomous behavior</p>
<p>that rests upon internal dynamics</p>
<p>that are not only modeling</p>
<p>the data impressed upon their surface or the blanket states,</p>
<p>but they are actively resampling those data by moving.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re moving towards chemical gradients and chemotaxis.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve gone beyond just being good little models</p>
<p>of the kind of world they live in.</p>
<p>For example, an oil droplet could, in a panpsychic sense,</p>
<p>be construed as a little being</p>
<p>that has now perfectly inferred.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a passive, nonliving oil drop</p>
<p>living in a bowl of water.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>But to now equip that oil drop with the ability to go out</p>
<p>and test that hypothesis about different states of beings.</p>
<p>So it can actually push its surface over there, over there,</p>
<p>and test for chemical gradients,</p>
<p>or then you start to move to a much more lifelike form.</p>
<p>This is all fun, theoretically interesting,</p>
<p>but it actually is quite important</p>
<p>in terms of reflecting what I have seen</p>
<p>since the turn of the millennium,</p>
<p>which is this move towards an inactive</p>
<p>and embodied understanding of intelligence.</p>
<p>And you say you&rsquo;re from machine learning.</p>
<p>So what that means,</p>
<p>the central importance of movement,</p>
<p>I think has yet to really hit machine learning.</p>
<p>It certainly has now diffused itself throughout robotics.</p>
<p>And perhaps you could say certain problems in active vision</p>
<p>where you actually have to move the camera</p>
<p>to sample this and that.</p>
<p>But machine learning of the data mining deep learning sort</p>
<p>simply hasn&rsquo;t contended with this issue.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s done, instead of dealing with the movement problem</p>
<p>and the active sampling of data,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just said, we don&rsquo;t need to worry about,</p>
<p>we can see all the data because we&rsquo;ve got big data.</p>
<p>So we can ignore movement.</p>
<p>So that for me is an important omission</p>
<p>in current machine learning.</p>
<p>The current machine learning is much more like the oil drop.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But an oil drop that enjoys exposure</p>
<p>to nearly all the data that it will ever need to be exposed to,</p>
<p>as opposed to the tadpoles swimming out</p>
<p>to find the right data.</p>
<p>For example, it likes food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good hypothesis.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s test it out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go and move and ingest food, for example,</p>
<p>and see is that evidence that I&rsquo;m the kind of thing</p>
<p>that likes this kind of food.</p>
<p>So the next natural question, and forgive this question,</p>
<p>but if we think of sort of even artificial intelligence</p>
<p>systems, which I just painted a beautiful picture</p>
<p>of existence and life.</p>
<p>So do you ascribe, do you find within this framework</p>
<p>a possibility of defining consciousness</p>
<p>or exploring the idea of consciousness?</p>
<p>Like what, you know, self awareness</p>
<p>and expand it to consciousness?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How can we start to think about consciousness</p>
<p>within this framework?</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s possible to think about it,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;ll get it.</p>
<p>Get anywhere is another question.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;m licensed</p>
<p>to answer that question.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d have to speak to a qualified philosopher</p>
<p>to get a definitive answer to that.</p>
<p>But certainly, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest</p>
<p>in using not just these ideas, but related ideas</p>
<p>from information theory to try and tie down</p>
<p>the maths and the calculus and the geometry of consciousness,</p>
<p>either in terms of sort of a minimal consciousness,</p>
<p>even less than a minimal selfhood.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m talking about is the ability, effectively,</p>
<p>to plan, to have agency.</p>
<p>So you could argue that a virus does have a form of agency</p>
<p>in virtue of the way that it selectively</p>
<p>finds hosts and cells to live in and moves around.</p>
<p>But you wouldn&rsquo;t endow it with the capacity</p>
<p>to think about planning and moving in a purposeful way</p>
<p>where it countenances the future.</p>
<p>Whereas you might an ant.</p>
<p>You might think an ant&rsquo;s not quite as unconscious</p>
<p>as a virus.</p>
<p>It certainly seems to have a purpose.</p>
<p>It talks to its friends en route during its foraging.</p>
<p>It has a different kind of autonomy, which is biotic,</p>
<p>but beyond a virus.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about, so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some line that has to do with the complexity of planning</p>
<p>that may contain an answer.</p>
<p>I mean, it would be beautiful if we</p>
<p>can find a line beyond which we could say a being is conscious.</p>
<p>Yes, it will be.</p>
<p>These are wonderful lines that we&rsquo;ve drawn with existence,</p>
<p>life, and consciousness.</p>
<p>Yes, it will be very nice.</p>
<p>One little wrinkle there, and this</p>
<p>is something I&rsquo;ve only learned in the past few months,</p>
<p>is the philosophical notion of vagueness.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it would be wonderful to draw a line.</p>
<p>I had always assumed that that line at some point</p>
<p>would be drawn until about four months ago,</p>
<p>and the philosopher taught me about vagueness.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve come across this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a technical concept.</p>
<p>And I think most revealingly illustrated with,</p>
<p>at what point does a pile of sand become a pile?</p>
<p>Is it one grain, two grains, three grains, or four grains?</p>
<p>So at what point would you draw the line</p>
<p>between being a pile of sand and a collection of grains of sand?</p>
<p>In the same way, is it right to ask,</p>
<p>where would I draw the line between conscious</p>
<p>and unconscious?</p>
<p>And it might be a vague concept.</p>
<p>Having said that, I agree with you entirely.</p>
<p>Systems that have the ability to plan.</p>
<p>So just technically, what that means</p>
<p>is your inferential self evidencing,</p>
<p>by which I simply mean the thermodynamics and gradient</p>
<p>flows that underwrite the preservation of your oil</p>
<p>droplet like form, can be described</p>
<p>as an optimization of log Bayesian model</p>
<p>evidence, your elbow.</p>
<p>That self evidencing must be evidence</p>
<p>for a model of what&rsquo;s causing the sensory impressions</p>
<p>on the sensory part of your surface or your Markov</p>
<p>blanket.</p>
<p>If that model is capable of planning,</p>
<p>it must include a model of the future consequences</p>
<p>of your active states or your action, just planning.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now in the game of planning as inference.</p>
<p>Now notice what we&rsquo;ve made, though.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made quite a big move away from big data and machine</p>
<p>learning, because again, it&rsquo;s the consequences of moving.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the consequences of selecting those data or those</p>
<p>data or looking over there.</p>
<p>And that tells you immediately that even</p>
<p>to be a contender for a conscious artifact or a strong</p>
<p>AI or generalized, I don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s called nowadays,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got to have movement in the game.</p>
<p>And furthermore, you&rsquo;ve got to have a generative model</p>
<p>of the sort you might find in, say, a variational auto</p>
<p>encoder that is thinking about the future conditioned</p>
<p>upon different courses of action.</p>
<p>Now that brings a number of things to the table, which</p>
<p>now you start to think, well, those</p>
<p>have got all the right ingredients</p>
<p>to talk about consciousness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now got to select among a number of different courses</p>
<p>of action into the future as part of planning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now got free will.</p>
<p>The act of selecting this course of action or that policy</p>
<p>or that policy or that action suddenly</p>
<p>makes me into an inference machine,</p>
<p>a self evidencing artifact that now</p>
<p>looks as if it&rsquo;s selecting amongst different alternative</p>
<p>ways forward, as I actively swim here or swim there</p>
<p>or look over here, look over there.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;ve now got to a situation</p>
<p>if there is planning in the mix.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now getting much closer to that line</p>
<p>if that line were ever to exist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it gets you quite as far as self aware, though.</p>
<p>And then you have to, I think, grapple with the question,</p>
<p>how would formally write down a calculus or a maths</p>
<p>of self awareness?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s impossible to do.</p>
<p>But I think there would be pressure on you</p>
<p>to actually commit to a formal definition of what</p>
<p>you mean by self awareness.</p>
<p>I think most people that I know would probably</p>
<p>say that a goldfish, a pet fish, was not self aware.</p>
<p>They would probably argue about their favorite cat,</p>
<p>but would be quite happy to say that their mom was self aware.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I mean, but that might very well connect</p>
<p>to some level of complexity with planning.</p>
<p>It seems like self awareness is essential for complex planning.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you want to take that further?</p>
<p>Because I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>Again, the line is unclear, but it</p>
<p>seems like integrating yourself into the world,</p>
<p>into your planning, is essential for constructing complex plans.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So mathematically describing that in the same elegant way</p>
<p>as you have with the free energy principle might be difficult.</p>
<p>Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that, well, perhaps we should just,</p>
<p>can we just go back?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very important answer you gave.</p>
<p>And I think if I just unpacked it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d see the truisms that you&rsquo;ve just exposed for us.</p>
<p>But let me, sorry, I&rsquo;m mindful that I didn&rsquo;t answer</p>
<p>your question before.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the free energy principle good for?</p>
<p>Is it just a pretty theoretical exercise</p>
<p>to explain nonequilibrium steady states?</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>It does nothing more for you than that.</p>
<p>It can be regarded, it&rsquo;s going to sound very arrogant,</p>
<p>but it is of the sort of theory of natural selection,</p>
<p>or a hypothesis of natural selection.</p>
<p>Beautiful, undeniably true, but tells you</p>
<p>absolutely nothing about why you have legs and eyes.</p>
<p>It tells you nothing about the actual phenotype,</p>
<p>and it wouldn&rsquo;t allow you to build something.</p>
<p>So the free energy principle by itself</p>
<p>is as vacuous as most tautological theories.</p>
<p>And by tautological, of course,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to the theory of natural,</p>
<p>the survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the fittest of those that survive?</p>
<p>Why do they cycle?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fitter.</p>
<p>It just goes around in circles.</p>
<p>In a sense, the free energy principle has that same</p>
<p>deflationary tautology under the hood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a characteristic of things that exist.</p>
<p>Why do they exist?</p>
<p>Because they minimize their free energy.</p>
<p>Why do they minimize their free energy?</p>
<p>Because they exist.</p>
<p>And you just keep on going round and round and round.</p>
<p>But the practical thing,</p>
<p>which you don&rsquo;t get from natural selection,</p>
<p>but you could say has now manifest in things</p>
<p>like differential evolution or genetic algorithms</p>
<p>and MCMC, for example, in machine learning.</p>
<p>The practical thing you can get is,</p>
<p>if it looks as if things that exist</p>
<p>are trying to have density dynamics</p>
<p>and look as though they&rsquo;re optimizing</p>
<p>a variational free energy,</p>
<p>and a variational free energy has to be</p>
<p>a functional of a generative model,</p>
<p>a probabilistic description of causes and consequences,</p>
<p>causes out there, consequences in the sensorium</p>
<p>on the sensory parts of the Markov blanket,</p>
<p>then it should, in theory, be possible</p>
<p>to write down the generative model,</p>
<p>work out the gradients,</p>
<p>and then cause it to autonomously self evidence.</p>
<p>So you should be able to write down oil droplets.</p>
<p>You should be able to create artifacts</p>
<p>where you have supplied the objective function</p>
<p>that supplies the gradients,</p>
<p>that supplies the self organizing dynamics</p>
<p>to non equilibrium steady state.</p>
<p>So there is actually a practical application</p>
<p>of the free energy principle</p>
<p>when you can write down your required evidence</p>
<p>in terms of, well, when you can write down</p>
<p>the generative model that is the thing</p>
<p>that has the evidence.</p>
<p>The probability of these sensory data</p>
<p>or this data, given that model,</p>
<p>is effectively the thing that the elbow</p>
<p>or the variational free energy bounds or approximates.</p>
<p>That means that you can actually write down the model</p>
<p>and the kind of thing that you want to engineer,</p>
<p>the kind of AGI or artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>that you want to manifest probabilistically,</p>
<p>and then you engineer, a lot of hard work,</p>
<p>but you would engineer a robot and a computer</p>
<p>to perform a gradient descent on that objective function.</p>
<p>So it does have a practical implication.</p>
<p>Now, why am I wittering on about that?</p>
<p>It did seem relevant to, yes.</p>
<p>So what kinds of, so the answer to,</p>
<p>would it be easier or would it be hard?</p>
<p>Well, mathematically, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just told you all you need to do</p>
<p>is write down your perfect artifact,</p>
<p>probabilistically, in the form</p>
<p>of a probabilistic generative model,</p>
<p>a probability distribution over the causes</p>
<p>and consequences of the world</p>
<p>in which this thing is immersed.</p>
<p>And then you just engineer a computer and a robot</p>
<p>to perform a gradient descent on that objective function.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>But of course, the big problem</p>
<p>is writing down the generative model.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the heavy lifting comes in.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the form and the structure of that generative model</p>
<p>which basically defines the artifact that you will create</p>
<p>or, indeed, the kind of artifact that has self awareness.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where all the hard work comes,</p>
<p>very much like natural selection doesn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>in the slightest why you have eyes.</p>
<p>So you have to drill down on the actual phenotype,</p>
<p>the actual generative model.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, what did you tell me</p>
<p>that tells me immediately the kinds of generative models</p>
<p>I would have to write down in order to have self awareness?</p>
<p>What you said to me was I have to have a model</p>
<p>that is effectively fit for purpose</p>
<p>for this kind of world in which I operate.</p>
<p>And if I now make the observation</p>
<p>that this kind of world is effectively largely populated</p>
<p>by other things like me, i.e. you,</p>
<p>then it makes enormous sense</p>
<p>that if I can develop a hypothesis</p>
<p>that we are similar kinds of creatures,</p>
<p>in fact, the same kind of creature,</p>
<p>but I am me and you are you,</p>
<p>then it becomes, again, mandated to have a sense of self.</p>
<p>So if I live in a world</p>
<p>that is constituted by things like me,</p>
<p>basically a social world, a community,</p>
<p>then it becomes necessary now for me to infer</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s me talking and not you talking.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t need that if I was on Mars by myself</p>
<p>or if I was in the jungle as a feral child.</p>
<p>If there was nothing like me around,</p>
<p>there would be no need to have an inference</p>
<p>at a hypothesis, oh yes, it is me</p>
<p>that is experiencing or causing these sounds</p>
<p>and it is not you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when there&rsquo;s ambiguity in play</p>
<p>induced by the fact that there are others in that world.</p>
<p>So I think that the special thing about self aware artifacts</p>
<p>is that they have learned to, or they have acquired,</p>
<p>or at least are equipped with, possibly by evolution,</p>
<p>generative models that allow for the fact</p>
<p>there are lots of copies of things like them around,</p>
<p>and therefore they have to work out it&rsquo;s you and not me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought of that.</p>
<p>I never thought of that, that the purpose</p>
<p>of the really usefulness of consciousness</p>
<p>or self awareness in the context of planning</p>
<p>existing in the world is so you can operate</p>
<p>with other things like you, and like you could,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to necessarily be human.</p>
<p>It could be other kind of similar creatures.</p>
<p>Absolutely, well, we view a lot of our attributes</p>
<p>into our pets, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>Or we try to make our robots humanoid.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a deep reason for that,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just much easier to read the world</p>
<p>if you can make the simplifying assumption</p>
<p>that basically you&rsquo;re me, and it&rsquo;s just your turn to talk.</p>
<p>I mean, when we talk about planning,</p>
<p>when you talk specifically about planning,</p>
<p>the highest, if you like, manifestation or realization</p>
<p>of that planning is what we&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
<p>I mean, the human condition doesn&rsquo;t get any higher</p>
<p>than this talking about the philosophy of existence</p>
<p>and the conversation.</p>
<p>But in that conversation, there is a beautiful art</p>
<p>of turn taking and mutual inference, theory of mind.</p>
<p>I have to know when you wanna listen.</p>
<p>I have to know when you want to interrupt.</p>
<p>I have to make sure that you&rsquo;re online.</p>
<p>I have to have a model in my head</p>
<p>of your model in your head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the highest, the most sophisticated form</p>
<p>of generative model, where the generative model</p>
<p>actually has a generative model</p>
<p>of somebody else&rsquo;s generative model.</p>
<p>And I think that, and what we are doing now evinces</p>
<p>the kinds of generative models</p>
<p>that would support self awareness,</p>
<p>because without that, we&rsquo;d both be talking over each other,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;d be singing together in a choir.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a brilliant analogy for what I&rsquo;m trying to say,</p>
<p>but yeah, we wouldn&rsquo;t have this discourse.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t have this.</p>
<p>Yeah, the dance of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>As I interrupt, I mean, that&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll re listen to this conversation many times.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much poetry in this, and mathematics.</p>
<p>Let me ask the silliest, or perhaps the biggest question</p>
<p>as a last kind of question.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about living in existence</p>
<p>and the objective function under which</p>
<p>these objects would operate.</p>
<p>What do you think is the objective function</p>
<p>of our existence?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>What do you think is the, for you, perhaps,</p>
<p>the purpose, the source of fulfillment,</p>
<p>the source of meaning for your existence,</p>
<p>as one blob in this soup?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to answer that, again, as a physicist,</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s the free energy I expect</p>
<p>consequent upon my behavior.</p>
<p>So technically, we could get a really interesting</p>
<p>conversation about what that comprises</p>
<p>in terms of searching for information,</p>
<p>resolving uncertainty about the kind of thing that I am.</p>
<p>But I suspect that you want a slightly more personal</p>
<p>and fun answer, but which can be consistent with that.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s reassuringly simple</p>
<p>and hops back to what you were taught as a child,</p>
<p>that you have certain beliefs about the kind of creature</p>
<p>and the kind of person you are.</p>
<p>And all that self evidencing means,</p>
<p>all that minimizing variational free energy</p>
<p>in an inactive and embodied way,</p>
<p>means is fulfilling the beliefs about</p>
<p>what kind of thing you are.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;re all given those scripts,</p>
<p>those narratives, at a very early age,</p>
<p>usually in the form of bedtime stories or fairy stories</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m a princess and I&rsquo;m gonna meet a beast</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna transform and he&rsquo;s gonna be a prince.</p>
<p>And so the narratives are all around you</p>
<p>from your parents to the friends</p>
<p>to the society feeds these stories.</p>
<p>And then your objective function is to fulfill.</p>
<p>Exactly, that narrative that has been encultured</p>
<p>by your immediate family, but as you say,</p>
<p>also the sort of the culture in which you grew up</p>
<p>and you create for yourself.</p>
<p>I mean, again, because of this active inference,</p>
<p>this inactive aspect of self evidencing,</p>
<p>not only am I modeling my environment,</p>
<p>my eco niche, my external states out there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m actively changing them all the time</p>
<p>and doing the same back, we&rsquo;re doing it together.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a synchrony that means that I&rsquo;m creating</p>
<p>my own culture over different timescales.</p>
<p>So the question now is for me being very selfish,</p>
<p>what scripts were I given?</p>
<p>It basically was a mixture between Einstein and shark homes.</p>
<p>So I smoke as heavily as possible,</p>
<p>try to avoid too much interpersonal contact,</p>
<p>enjoy the fantasy that you&rsquo;re a popular scientist</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna make a difference in a slightly quirky way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I grew up on.</p>
<p>My father was an engineer and loved science</p>
<p>and he loved sort of things like Sir Arthur Edmonds,</p>
<p>Spacetime and Gravitation, which was the first</p>
<p>understandable version of general relativity.</p>
<p>So all the fairy stories I was told as I was growing up</p>
<p>were all about these characters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping the Hobbit out of this</p>
<p>because that doesn&rsquo;t quite fit my narrative.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a journey of exploration, I suppose, of sorts.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;ve just grown up to be what I imagine</p>
<p>a mild mannered Sherlock Holmes slash Albert Einstein</p>
<p>would do in my shoes.</p>
<p>And you did it elegantly and beautifully.</p>
<p>Carl was a huge honor talking today, it was fun.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>No, thank you. Appreciate it.</p>

<p>and your motor system seeks to minimize prediction error.</p>
