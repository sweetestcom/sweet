    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Michael Mina.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor at Harvard doing research</p>
<p>on infectious disease and immunology.</p>
<p>The most defining characteristic of his approach</p>
<p>to science and biology is that of a first principles thinker</p>
<p>and engineer focused not just on defining the problem,</p>
<p>but finding the solution.</p>
<p>In that spirit, we talk about cheap rapid at home testing,</p>
<p>which is a solution to COVID 19 that to me has become</p>
<p>one of the most obvious, powerful, and doable solutions</p>
<p>that frankly should have been done months ago</p>
<p>and still should be done now.</p>
<p>As we talk about its accuracy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s high for detecting actual contagiousness</p>
<p>and hundreds of millions can be manufactured quickly</p>
<p>and relatively cheaply.</p>
<p>In general, I love engineering solutions like these</p>
<p>even if government bureaucracies often don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It respects science and data, it respects our freedom,</p>
<p>it respects our intelligence and basic common sense.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been solution oriented, not problem oriented.</p>
<p>It saddens me to see that public discourse</p>
<p>disproportionately focuses on the mistakes</p>
<p>of those who dare to build solutions</p>
<p>rather than applaud their attempt to do so.</p>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt said it well</p>
<p>in his The Man in the Arena speech over 100 years ago.</p>
<p>I should say that both the critic</p>
<p>and the creator are important,</p>
<p>but in my humble estimation,</p>
<p>there are too many now of the former</p>
<p>and not enough of the latter.</p>
<p>So while we spread the derisive words</p>
<p>of the critic on social media, making it viral,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not forget that this world is built</p>
<p>on the blood, sweat, and tears of those who dare to create.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Michael Minna.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful, mysterious,</p>
<p>or surprising idea in the biology of humans or viruses</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve ever come across in your work?</p>
<p>Sorry for the overly philosophical question.</p>
<p>Wow, well that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>You know, I love the pathogenesis of viruses,</p>
<p>and one of the things that I&rsquo;ve worked on a lot</p>
<p>is trying to understand how viruses interact with each other.</p>
<p>And so pre all this COVID stuff,</p>
<p>I was really, really dedicated to understanding</p>
<p>how viruses impact other pathogens,</p>
<p>so how if somebody gets an infection with one thing</p>
<p>or a vaccine, does it either benefit or harm you</p>
<p>from other things that appear to be unrelated to most people.</p>
<p>And so one system which is highly detrimental to humans,</p>
<p>but what I think is just immensely fascinating, is measles.</p>
<p>And measles gets into a kid&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>The immune system picks it up,</p>
<p>and essentially grabs the virus,</p>
<p>and does exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to do,</p>
<p>which is to take this virus</p>
<p>and bring it into the immune system</p>
<p>so that the immune system can learn from it,</p>
<p>can develop an immune response to it.</p>
<p>But instead, measles plays a trick.</p>
<p>It gets into the immune system,</p>
<p>serves almost as a Trojan horse,</p>
<p>and instead of getting eaten by these cells,</p>
<p>it just takes them over,</p>
<p>and it ends up proliferating in the very cells</p>
<p>that were supposed to kill it.</p>
<p>And it just distributes throughout the entire body,</p>
<p>gets into the bone marrow,</p>
<p>kills off children&rsquo;s immune memories.</p>
<p>And so it essentially, what I&rsquo;ve found</p>
<p>and what my research has found is that this one virus</p>
<p>was responsible for as much as half</p>
<p>of all of the infectious disease deaths in kids</p>
<p>before we started vaccinating against it,</p>
<p>because it was just wiping out children&rsquo;s immune memories</p>
<p>to all different pathogens,</p>
<p>which is, I think, just astounding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just amazing to watch it spread throughout bodies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done the studies in monkeys,</p>
<p>and you can watch it just destroy</p>
<p>and obliterate people&rsquo;s immune memories</p>
<p>in the same way that some parasite</p>
<p>might destroy somebody&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>Is that evolutionary just coincidence,</p>
<p>or is there some kind of advantage</p>
<p>to this kind of interactivity between pathogens?</p>
<p>Oh, I think in that sense, it&rsquo;s just coincidence.</p>
<p>It probably is a, it&rsquo;s a good way for measles to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good way for measles to essentially</p>
<p>be able to survive long enough to replicate in the body.</p>
<p>It just replicates in the cells</p>
<p>that are meant to destroy it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s utilizing our immune cells for its own replication,</p>
<p>but in so doing, it&rsquo;s destroying the memories</p>
<p>of all the other immunological memories.</p>
<p>But there are other viruses,</p>
<p>so a different system is influenza,</p>
<p>and flu predisposes to severe bacterial infections.</p>
<p>And that, I think, is another coincidence,</p>
<p>but I also think that there are some evolutionary benefits</p>
<p>that bacteria may hijack</p>
<p>and sort of piggyback on viral infections.</p>
<p>Viruses can, they just grow so much quicker than bacteria.</p>
<p>They replicate faster,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s this system with viruses,</p>
<p>with flu and bacteria,</p>
<p>where the influenza has these proteins</p>
<p>that cleave certain receptors,</p>
<p>and the bacteria want to cleave those same receptors.</p>
<p>They want to cleave the same molecules</p>
<p>that gave entrance to those receptors.</p>
<p>So instead, the bacteria found out, like,</p>
<p>hey, we could just piggyback on these viruses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll do it 100 or 1,000 times faster than we can.</p>
<p>And so then they just piggyback on,</p>
<p>and they let flu cleave all these sialic acids,</p>
<p>and then the bacteria just glom on in the wake of it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all different interactions between pathogens</p>
<p>that are just remarkable.</p>
<p>So does this whole system of viruses</p>
<p>that interact with each other</p>
<p>and so damn good at getting inside our bodies,</p>
<p>does that fascinate you or terrify you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much a scientist,</p>
<p>and so it fascinates me much more than it terrifies me.</p>
<p>But knowing enough, I know just how well,</p>
<p>you know, we get the wrong virus in our population,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s through some random mutation</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s this same COVID 19 virus,</p>
<p>and it, you know, these things are tricky.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to mutate quickly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re able to find new hosts</p>
<p>and rearrange in the case of influenza.</p>
<p>So what terrifies me is just how easily</p>
<p>this particular pandemic could have been so much worse.</p>
<p>This could have been a virus</p>
<p>that is much worse than it is.</p>
<p>You know, same thing with H1N1 back in 2009.</p>
<p>That terrifies me.</p>
<p>If a virus like that was much more detrimental,</p>
<p>you know, that would be,</p>
<p>it could be much more devastating.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s hard to say, you know,</p>
<p>the human species were, well,</p>
<p>I hesitate to say that we&rsquo;re good at responding to things</p>
<p>because there are some aspects that were,</p>
<p>this particular virus, SARS COVID 2 and COVID 19</p>
<p>has found a sweet spot where it&rsquo;s not quite serious enough</p>
<p>on an individual level that humans just don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t seen much of a useful response by many humans.</p>
<p>A lot of people even think it&rsquo;s a hoax.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s led us down this path of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not quite serious enough</p>
<p>to get everyone to respond immediately</p>
<p>and with the most urgency, but it&rsquo;s enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bad enough that, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s caused our economies to shut down and collapse.</p>
<p>And so I think I know enough about virus biology</p>
<p>to be terrified for humans that, you know,</p>
<p>it can, it just takes one virus,</p>
<p>just takes the wrong one to just obliterate us</p>
<p>or not obliterate us,</p>
<p>but really do much more damage than we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think that COVID 19</p>
<p>is a result of a virus evolving together with like Twitter,</p>
<p>like figuring out how we can sneak past the defenses</p>
<p>of the humans.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not bad enough.</p>
<p>And then the misinformation,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff together is operating</p>
<p>in such a way that the virus can spread effectively.</p>
<p>I wonder, I mean, obviously a virus is not intelligent,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a rhyme and a rhythm</p>
<p>to the way this whole evolutionary process works</p>
<p>and creates these fascinating things</p>
<p>that spread throughout the entire civilization.</p>
<p>Absolutely, it&rsquo;s, yeah,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely fascinated by this idea</p>
<p>of social media in particular,</p>
<p>how it replicates, how it grows.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been, how it actually starts interacting</p>
<p>with the biology of the virus, masks,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna get vaccinated, politics,</p>
<p>like these seem so external to virus biology,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s become so intertwined.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And I actually think we could find out</p>
<p>that the virus actually becomes,</p>
<p>obviously not intentionally,</p>
<p>but we could find that people choosing not to wear masks,</p>
<p>choosing not to counter this virus</p>
<p>in a regimented and sort of organized way,</p>
<p>effectively gives the virus more opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>We can look at vaccines.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to have</p>
<p>one of the most aggressive vaccination programs</p>
<p>the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>But we are unfortunately doing it</p>
<p>right at the peak of viral transmission</p>
<p>when millions and millions of people</p>
<p>are still getting infected.</p>
<p>And when we do that,</p>
<p>that just gives this virus so many more opportunities.</p>
<p>I mean, orders of magnitude more opportunity</p>
<p>to mutate around our immune system.</p>
<p>Now, if we were to vaccinate everyone</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s not a lot of virus,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s just not a lot of virus.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s not going to be as many,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how many zeros are at the end</p>
<p>of however many viral particles</p>
<p>there are in the world right now,</p>
<p>more than quadrillions.</p>
<p>And so if you assume that at any given time,</p>
<p>somebody might have trillions of virus in them</p>
<p>and any given individual,</p>
<p>so then multiply trillions by millions</p>
<p>and you get a lot of viruses out there.</p>
<p>And if you start applying pressure, ecological pressure,</p>
<p>to this virus, that when it&rsquo;s not abundant,</p>
<p>God, the opportunity for a virus to sneak around immunity,</p>
<p>especially when all the vaccines are identical,</p>
<p>essentially, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>All it takes is one to mutate and then jumps.</p>
<p>Takes one.</p>
<p>Takes one in the whole world.</p>
<p>And we have to not forget</p>
<p>that this particular virus was one.</p>
<p>It was one opportunity and it has spread across the globe</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no reason that can&rsquo;t happen tomorrow anew.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>I have a million other questions in this direction,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to talk about one of the most exciting aspects</p>
<p>of your work, which is testing or rapid testing.</p>
<p>You wrote a great article in Time on November 17th.</p>
<p>This is like a month ago about rapid testing titled,</p>
<p>How We Can Stop the Spread of COVID 19 by Christmas.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jot down the fact that this is a month ago.</p>
<p>So maybe your timeline would be different,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say in a month.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about this powerful idea</p>
<p>for quite a while throughout the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>How do we stop the spread of COVID 19 in a month?</p>
<p>Well, we use tests like these.</p>
<p>So the only reason the virus continues spreading</p>
<p>is because people spread it to each other.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t magic.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a few ways to stop the virus</p>
<p>from spreading to each other.</p>
<p>And that is you either can vaccinate everyone</p>
<p>and vaccinating everyone is a way to immunologically</p>
<p>prevent the virus from growing inside of somebody</p>
<p>and therefore spreading.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know yet actually if this vaccine,</p>
<p>if any of these vaccines are going to</p>
<p>prevent onward transmission.</p>
<p>So that may or may not serve to be one opportunity.</p>
<p>Certainly I think it will decrease transmission.</p>
<p>But the other idea that we have at our disposal now,</p>
<p>we had it in May, we had it in June,</p>
<p>July, August, September, October, November,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s December.</p>
<p>We still have it.</p>
<p>We still choose not to use it in this country</p>
<p>and in much of the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s rapid testing.</p>
<p>That is giving, it&rsquo;s empowering people to know</p>
<p>that they are infected and giving them the opportunity</p>
<p>to not spread it to their loved ones</p>
<p>and their friends and neighbors and whoever else.</p>
<p>We could have done this.</p>
<p>We still can.</p>
<p>Today we could start.</p>
<p>We have millions of these tests.</p>
<p>These tests are simple paper strip tests.</p>
<p>They are, inside of this thing</p>
<p>is just a little piece of paper.</p>
<p>Now I can actually open it up here.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>So this, this is how we do it right here.</p>
<p>We have this little paper strip test.</p>
<p>This is enough to let you know if you&rsquo;re infectious.</p>
<p>With somewhere around the order of 99% sensitivity,</p>
<p>99% specificity, you can know</p>
<p>if you have infectious virus in you.</p>
<p>If we can get these out to everyone&rsquo;s homes,</p>
<p>build these, make 10 million, 20 million,</p>
<p>30 million of them a day.</p>
<p>You know, we make more bottles of Dasani water every day.</p>
<p>We can make these little paper strip tests.</p>
<p>And if we do that and we get these into people&rsquo;s homes</p>
<p>so that they can use them twice a week,</p>
<p>then we can know if we&rsquo;re infectious.</p>
<p>You know, is it perfect?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>But is it near perfect?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, and so if we can say,</p>
<p>hey, the transmission of this is, you know,</p>
<p>for every hundred people that get infected right now,</p>
<p>they go on to infect maybe 130 additional people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exponential growth.</p>
<p>So a hundred becomes 130.</p>
<p>A couple of days later that 130 becomes</p>
<p>another 165 people have now been infected.</p>
<p>And you know, go over three weeks</p>
<p>and a hundred people become 500 people infected.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&rsquo;t take much to have those hundred people</p>
<p>not infect 130, but infect 90.</p>
<p>All we have to do is remove say 30, 40% of new infections</p>
<p>from continuing their spread.</p>
<p>And then instead of exponential growth,</p>
<p>you have exponential decay.</p>
<p>So this doesn&rsquo;t need to be perfect.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to go from a hundred to zero.</p>
<p>We just have to go and have those hundred people infect 90</p>
<p>and those 90 people infect, you know, 82,</p>
<p>whatever it might be.</p>
<p>And you do that for a few weeks and boom,</p>
<p>you have now gone instead of a hundred to 500,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gone from a hundred to 20.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very hard.</p>
<p>And so the way to do that is to let people know</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re infectious.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re a perfect example right now.</p>
<p>This morning I used these tests to make sure</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t infectious.</p>
<p>Is it perfect?</p>
<p>No, but it reduced my odds 99%.</p>
<p>I already was at extremely low odds</p>
<p>because I spend my life quarantining these days.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing with this test,</p>
<p>with the testing in general,</p>
<p>which is why I love what you&rsquo;ve been espousing,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s really confusing to me that this has not been</p>
<p>taken on as it&rsquo;s one actual solution</p>
<p>that was available for a long time.</p>
<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been solutions proposed</p>
<p>at a large scale and a solution that it seems</p>
<p>like a lot of people would be able to get behind.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some politicization or fear of other solutions</p>
<p>that people have proposed, which is like lockdown.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a worry, you know,</p>
<p>especially in the American spirit of freedom,</p>
<p>like you can&rsquo;t tell me what to do.</p>
<p>The thing about tests is it like empowers you</p>
<p>with information essentially.</p>
<p>So like it gives you more information about your,</p>
<p>like your role in this pandemic,</p>
<p>and then you can do whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s all up to your ethics and so on.</p>
<p>So like, and it&rsquo;s obvious that with that information,</p>
<p>people would be able to protect their loved ones</p>
<p>and also do their sort of quote unquote duty</p>
<p>for their country, right?</p>
<p>Is protect the rest of the country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s empowerment,</p>
<p>but you know, this is a problem.</p>
<p>We have not put these into action in large part</p>
<p>because we have a medical industry</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t want to see them be used.</p>
<p>We have a political and a regulatory industry</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t want to see them be used.</p>
<p>That sounds crazy.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t they want them to be used?</p>
<p>We have a very paternalistic approach</p>
<p>to everything in this country.</p>
<p>You know, despite this country kind of being founded</p>
<p>on this individualistic ideal,</p>
<p>pull yourself up from your bootstraps, all that stuff.</p>
<p>When it comes to public health,</p>
<p>we have a bunch of ivory tower academics who want data.</p>
<p>They, you know, they want to see perfection.</p>
<p>And we have this issue of letting perfection</p>
<p>get in the way of actually doing something at all,</p>
<p>you know, doing something effective.</p>
<p>And so we keep comparing these tests, for example,</p>
<p>to the laboratory based PCR test.</p>
<p>And sure, this isn&rsquo;t a PCR test,</p>
<p>but this doesn&rsquo;t cost a hundred dollars</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t take five days to get back,</p>
<p>which means in every single scenario,</p>
<p>this is the more effective test.</p>
<p>And we have, unfortunately, a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not about public health.</p>
<p>We have entirely eroded any ideals of public health</p>
<p>in our country for the biomedical complex,</p>
<p>you know, this medical industrial complex,</p>
<p>which overrides everything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, you know, I&rsquo;m just,</p>
<p>can I swear on this pot?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so fucking pissed that these tests don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, and everyone says, you know,</p>
<p>oh, we couldn&rsquo;t make these, you know,</p>
<p>that we could never do it.</p>
<p>That would be such a hard, a difficult problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the vaccine gets,</p>
<p>we have at the same time that we could have gotten</p>
<p>these stupid little paper strip tests out to every household,</p>
<p>we have developed a brand new vaccine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through phase one, phase two, phase three trials.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve scaled up its production.</p>
<p>And now we have UPS and FedEx</p>
<p>and all the logistics in the world,</p>
<p>getting freezers out to where they need to be.</p>
<p>We have this immense, we see when it comes to sort of</p>
<p>medicine, you know, something you&rsquo;re injecting into somebody,</p>
<p>then all of a sudden people say, oh, yes we can.</p>
<p>But you say, oh no, that&rsquo;s too simple a solution,</p>
<p>too cheap a solution.</p>
<p>No way could we possibly do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this faulty thinking in our country,</p>
<p>which, you know, frankly is driven by big money, big,</p>
<p>you know, the only time when we actually think</p>
<p>that we can do something that&rsquo;s maybe aggressive</p>
<p>and complicated is when there&rsquo;s billions and billions</p>
<p>of billions of dollars in it, you know.</p>
<p>I mean, on a difficult note, because this is part</p>
<p>of your work from before the COVID,</p>
<p>it does seem that I saw a statistic currently</p>
<p>is that 40% would not be taken,</p>
<p>of Americans would not be taking the vaccine,</p>
<p>some number like this.</p>
<p>So you also have to acknowledge that all the money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been invested, like there doesn&rsquo;t appear</p>
<p>to be a solution to deal with like the fear,</p>
<p>distrust that people have.</p>
<p>I bet, I don&rsquo;t know if you know this number,</p>
<p>but for taking a strip, like a rapid test like this,</p>
<p>I bet you people would say,</p>
<p>like the percentage of people that wouldn&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>is in the single digits, probably.</p>
<p>I completely think so.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t want to get a test today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it gets sent to a lab,</p>
<p>it gets reported, it has all this stuff.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re a country which teaches people</p>
<p>from the time they&rsquo;re babies, you know,</p>
<p>to keep their medical data close to them.</p>
<p>We have HIPAA, we have all these,</p>
<p>we have immense rules and regulations</p>
<p>to ensure the privacy of people&rsquo;s medical data.</p>
<p>And then a pandemic comes around</p>
<p>and we just assume that the average person</p>
<p>is gonna wipe all that away and say,</p>
<p>oh no, I&rsquo;m happy giving out not just my own medical data,</p>
<p>but also to tell the authorities,</p>
<p>everyone who I&rsquo;ve spent my time with,</p>
<p>so that they all get a call and are pissed at me</p>
<p>for giving up their names.</p>
<p>You know, so people aren&rsquo;t getting tested</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re definitely not giving up their contacts</p>
<p>when it comes to contact tracing.</p>
<p>And so for so many reasons, that approach is failing.</p>
<p>Not to even mention the delays in testing</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>And so this is a whole different approach,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an approach that empowers people</p>
<p>and takes the power a bit away from the people in charge.</p>
<p>You know, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really grating on,</p>
<p>I think, public health officials who say,</p>
<p>no, we need the data.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re effectively saying, if I can&rsquo;t have the data,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the individuals,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the public to have their own data either.</p>
<p>Which is a terrible approach to a pandemic</p>
<p>where we can&rsquo;t solve a public health crisis</p>
<p>without actively engaging the public.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And you know, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do right now,</p>
<p>which is a terrible approach.</p>
<p>So first of all, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>you have a really nice informative website,</p>
<p>rapidtest.org, with information on this.</p>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t believe this is not more popular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Okay, but our, one of the FAQs you have</p>
<p>is a rapid test too expensive.</p>
<p>So can cost be brought down?</p>
<p>Like I pay, I take a weekly PCR test</p>
<p>and I think I pay 160, 170 bucks a week.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s criminal.</p>
<p>Absolutely we can get costs.</p>
<p>This thing right here costs less than a dollar to make.</p>
<p>With everything combined, plus the swabs,</p>
<p>you know, maybe it costs a dollar 50.</p>
<p>Could be sold for, frankly, it could be sold for $3</p>
<p>and still make a profit if they wanna sell it for five.</p>
<p>This one here, this is a slightly more complicated one,</p>
<p>but you can see it&rsquo;s just got</p>
<p>the exact same paper strip inside.</p>
<p>And this is really, it doesn&rsquo;t look like much,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of the cream of the crop</p>
<p>in terms of these rapid tests.</p>
<p>This is the one that the US government bought</p>
<p>and it is doing an amazing job.</p>
<p>It has a 99.9% sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>And so essentially the way it works is you just,</p>
<p>you use a swab, you put the,</p>
<p>once you kind of use a swab on yourself,</p>
<p>you put the swab into these little holes here.</p>
<p>You put some buffer on it and you close it</p>
<p>and a line will show up if it&rsquo;s positive</p>
<p>and a line won&rsquo;t show up if it&rsquo;s negative.</p>
<p>It takes five, 10 minutes.</p>
<p>This whole thing, this can be made so cheap</p>
<p>that the US government was able to buy them,</p>
<p>buy 150 million of them from Abbott for $5 a piece.</p>
<p>So anyone who says that these are expensive,</p>
<p>we have the proof is right here.</p>
<p>This one at its, Abbott did not lose money on this deal.</p>
<p>They got $750 million for selling 150 million of these</p>
<p>at five bucks a piece.</p>
<p>All of these tests can do the same.</p>
<p>So anyone who says that these should be,</p>
<p>unfortunately what&rsquo;s happening though</p>
<p>is the FDA is only authorizing</p>
<p>all of these tests as medical devices.</p>
<p>So what happens when you, if I&rsquo;m a medical company,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m a test production company</p>
<p>and I wanna make this test and I go through</p>
<p>and the FDA at the end of my authorization,</p>
<p>the FDA says, okay, you now have a medical device,</p>
<p>not a public health tool, but a medical device.</p>
<p>And that affords you the ability to charge</p>
<p>insurance companies for it.</p>
<p>Why would I ever as a, you know,</p>
<p>in our capitalistic economy and sort of infrastructure,</p>
<p>why would I ever not sell this for $30</p>
<p>when insurance will pay for it or $100?</p>
<p>You know, it might only cost me 50 cents to make,</p>
<p>but by pushing all of these tests through a medical pathway</p>
<p>at the FDA, what extrudes out the other side</p>
<p>is an expensive medical device that&rsquo;s erroneously expensive.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to be inflated in cost,</p>
<p>but the companies say, well, I&rsquo;d rather make fewer of them</p>
<p>and just sell them all for $30 a piece</p>
<p>than make tens of millions of them, which I could do,</p>
<p>and sell them at a dollar marginal profit.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a problem with our whole medical industry</p>
<p>that we see tests only as medical devices</p>
<p>and what I would like to see is for the government</p>
<p>in the same way that they bought 150 million of these</p>
<p>from Abbott, they should be buying, you know,</p>
<p>all of these tests, they should be buying 20 million a day</p>
<p>and getting them out to people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<p>This virus has cost trillions of dollars</p>
<p>to the American people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s closed down restaurants and stores</p>
<p>and obviously the main streets across America</p>
<p>have shuttered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s killing people, it&rsquo;s killing our economy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s killing lifestyles and lives.</p>
<p>This is an obvious solution.</p>
<p>To me, this is exciting.</p>
<p>This is like, this is a solution.</p>
<p>I wish like in April or something like that</p>
<p>to launch like the larger scale manufacturing deployment</p>
<p>of tests.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what test they are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously the capitalist system</p>
<p>would create cheaper and cheaper tests</p>
<p>that would be hopefully driving down to $1.</p>
<p>So what are we talking about?</p>
<p>In America, there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>300 plus million people.</p>
<p>So that means you wanna be testing regularly, right?</p>
<p>So how many do you think is possible to manufacture?</p>
<p>What would be the ultimate goal to manufacture per month?</p>
<p>Yep, so if we wanna slow this virus</p>
<p>and actually stop it from transmitting,</p>
<p>achieve what I call herd effects.</p>
<p>Like vaccine herd immunity,</p>
<p>herd effects are when you get that R value below one</p>
<p>through preventing onward transmission.</p>
<p>If we wanna do that with these tests,</p>
<p>we need about 20 million to 40 million of them every day,</p>
<p>which is not a lot.</p>
<p>In the United States.</p>
<p>So we could do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other ways.</p>
<p>You can have two people in a household swab each other,</p>
<p>swab themselves rather,</p>
<p>and then mix, put the swabs into the same tube</p>
<p>and onto one test so you can pool.</p>
<p>So you can get a two or three X gain in efficiency</p>
<p>through pooling in the household.</p>
<p>You could do that in schools or offices too,</p>
<p>wherever and just use a swab.</p>
<p>You have a, there&rsquo;s two people.</p>
<p>I mean, even if it&rsquo;s just standing in line</p>
<p>at a public testing site or something,</p>
<p>you could just say, okay,</p>
<p>these two are the last people to test or swab themselves.</p>
<p>They go into one thing.</p>
<p>And if it comes back positive,</p>
<p>then you just do each person and it&rsquo;s rapid.</p>
<p>So you can just say to the people, one of you is positive.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s test you again.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s ways to get the efficiency gains much better.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say, I think that the optimal number right now</p>
<p>that matches sort of what we can produce more or less today,</p>
<p>if we want it, is 20 million a day.</p>
<p>Right now, one company that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have their test here,</p>
<p>but one company is already producing 5 million tests</p>
<p>themselves and shipping them overseas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an American company based in California called Inova,</p>
<p>and they are giving 5 million tests to the UK every day.</p>
<p>Not to the, you know, and this is just because there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>the federal government hasn&rsquo;t authorized these tests.</p>
<p>So without the support of the government.</p>
<p>So yeah, so essentially,</p>
<p>if the government just puts some support behind it,</p>
<p>then yeah, you can get 20 million, probably easy.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, this, I mean, just here,</p>
<p>I have three different companies.</p>
<p>These, they all look similar.</p>
<p>Well, this one&rsquo;s closed,</p>
<p>but these are three different companies right here.</p>
<p>This is a fourth, Abbott.</p>
<p>Now, this is a fifth.</p>
<p>This is a sixth.</p>
<p>These two are a little bit different.</p>
<p>Do you mind if in a little bit,</p>
<p>would you take some of these or?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>We can absolutely do them.</p>
<p>So you have a lot of tests in front of you.</p>
<p>Could you maybe explain some of them?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a few different classes of tests</p>
<p>that I just have here, and there&rsquo;s more tests.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many more different tests out in the world too.</p>
<p>These are one class of tests.</p>
<p>These are rapid antigen tests</p>
<p>that are just the most bare bones paper strip tests.</p>
<p>These are, this is the type that I wanna see produced</p>
<p>in the tens of millions every day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so simple.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need the plastic cartridge.</p>
<p>You can just make the paper strip,</p>
<p>and you could have a little tube like this</p>
<p>that you just dunk the paper strip into.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually need the plastic,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;d actually prefer,</p>
<p>because if we start making tens of millions of these,</p>
<p>this becomes a lot of waste.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d rather not see this kind of waste be out there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a few companies,</p>
<p>Quidel is making a test called the Quick View,</p>
<p>which is just this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, they&rsquo;ve gotten rid of all the plastic.</p>
<p>And for people who are just listening to this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re looking at some very small tests</p>
<p>that fit in the palm of your hand,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re basically paper strips</p>
<p>fit into different containers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hence the comment about the plastic containers.</p>
<p>These are just injection molded, I think.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>they can build them at high numbers,</p>
<p>but then they have to like place them in there appropriately</p>
<p>and all this stuff.</p>
<p>So it is a bottleneck,</p>
<p>or somewhat of a bottleneck in manufacturing.</p>
<p>The actual bottleneck, which the government, I think,</p>
<p>should use the Defense Productions Act to build up,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a nitrocellulose membrane,</p>
<p>a laminated membrane on this,</p>
<p>that allows the material,</p>
<p>the buffer with the swab mixture to flow across it.</p>
<p>So the way these work,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called lateral flow tests.</p>
<p>And you take a swab,</p>
<p>you swab the front of your nose,</p>
<p>you dunk that swab into some buffer,</p>
<p>and then you put a couple of drops of that buffer</p>
<p>onto the lateral flow.</p>
<p>And just like paper,</p>
<p>if you dip a piece of paper into a cup of water,</p>
<p>the paper will pull the water up through capillary action.</p>
<p>This actually works very similarly.</p>
<p>It flows through somewhat a capillary action</p>
<p>through this nitrocellulose membrane.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s little antibodies on there,</p>
<p>these little proteins that are very specific,</p>
<p>in this case, for antigens or proteins of the virus.</p>
<p>So these are antibodies similar to the antibodies</p>
<p>that our body makes from our immune system,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just printed on these lateral flow tests,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re printed just like a little, a line.</p>
<p>So then you slice these all up into individual ones.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s any virus on that buffer,</p>
<p>as it flows across, the antibodies grab that virus,</p>
<p>and it creates a little reaction with some colloids in here</p>
<p>that cause it to turn dark.</p>
<p>Just like a pregnancy test,</p>
<p>one line means negative, it means a control strip worked,</p>
<p>and two lines mean positive.</p>
<p>It means, you know, if you get two lines,</p>
<p>it just means you have virus there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very, very likely to have virus there.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re super simple.</p>
<p>It is the exact same technology as pregnancy tests.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the technology, this particular one from Abbott,</p>
<p>this has been used for other infectious diseases</p>
<p>like malaria, and actually a number of these companies</p>
<p>have made malaria tests that do the exact same thing.</p>
<p>So they just coopted the same form factor</p>
<p>and just changed the antibodies</p>
<p>so it picks up SARS CoV2 instead of other infections.</p>
<p>Is it also, the Abbott one, is it also a strip?</p>
<p>Yep, yeah, this Abbott one here is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the, in this case,</p>
<p>instead of being put in a plastic sheath,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just put in a cardboard thing and literally glued on.</p>
<p>I mean, it looks like nothing, you know, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it looks like a, like,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just the simplest thing you could imagine.</p>
<p>The exterior packaging looks very Apple like, it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>It does, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s nice when it comes in a,</p>
<p>this is how they&rsquo;re packaged, you know,</p>
<p>so, and they don&rsquo;t have to, you know,</p>
<p>these are coming in individual packages against,</p>
<p>again, because they&rsquo;re really considered</p>
<p>individual medical devices,</p>
<p>but you could package them in bigger packets and stuff.</p>
<p>You wanna be careful with humidity</p>
<p>so they all have a little,</p>
<p>one of those humidity removing things</p>
<p>and oxygen removing things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, this is one class, these antigen tests.</p>
<p>If we could just pause for a second, if it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>and could you just briefly say what is an antigen test</p>
<p>and what other tests there are out there,</p>
<p>like categories of tests?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Just really quick.</p>
<p>So the testing landscape is a little bit complicated,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, but I&rsquo;ll break it down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really just three major classes of tests.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with the first two.</p>
<p>The first two tests are just looking for the virus</p>
<p>or looking for antibodies against the virus.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve heard about serology tests,</p>
<p>or maybe some people have heard about it.</p>
<p>Those are a different kind of test.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking to see has somebody in the past,</p>
<p>does somebody have an immune response against the virus,</p>
<p>which would indicate that they were infected</p>
<p>or exposed to it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about the antibody tests.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>Those, they actually can look very similar to this,</p>
<p>or they can be done in a laboratory.</p>
<p>Those are usually done from blood</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking for an immune response to the virus.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Everything I&rsquo;m talking about here</p>
<p>is looking for the virus itself,</p>
<p>not the immune response to the virus.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s two ways to look for the virus.</p>
<p>You can either look for the genetic code of the virus,</p>
<p>like the RNA, just like the DNA of somebody&rsquo;s human cells,</p>
<p>or you can look for the proteins themselves,</p>
<p>the antigens of the virus.</p>
<p>So I like to differentiate them.</p>
<p>If you were a PCR test that looks for RNA in,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say if we made it against humans,</p>
<p>it would be looking for the DNA inside of our cells.</p>
<p>That would be actually looking for our genetic code.</p>
<p>The equivalent to an antigen test</p>
<p>is sort of a test that like actually is looking</p>
<p>for our eyes or our nose or physical features of our body</p>
<p>that would delineate, okay, this is Michael, for example.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re either looking for a sequence</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re looking for a structure.</p>
<p>The PCR tests that a lot of people have gotten now</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re done in labs usually</p>
<p>are looking for the sequence of the virus, which is RNA.</p>
<p>This test here by a company called Detect,</p>
<p>this is one of Jonathan Rothberg&rsquo;s companies.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the guy who helped create modern day sequencing</p>
<p>and all kinds of other things.</p>
<p>So this Detect device, that&rsquo;s the name of the company,</p>
<p>this is actually a rapid RNA detection device.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost, it&rsquo;s like a PCR like test</p>
<p>and we could even do it here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s a beautiful test in my opinion,</p>
<p>works exceedingly well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a little bit more expensive.</p>
<p>So I think it could confirm,</p>
<p>could be used as a confirmatory test for these.</p>
<p>Is there a greater accuracy to it?</p>
<p>Yes, I would say that there is a greater accuracy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a downfall though of PCR</p>
<p>and tests that look for RNA.</p>
<p>They can sometimes detect somebody</p>
<p>who is no longer infectious.</p>
<p>So you have the RNA test</p>
<p>and then you have these antigen tests.</p>
<p>The antigen tests look for structures,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re generally only going to turn positive</p>
<p>if people have actively replicating virus in them.</p>
<p>And so what happens after an infection dissipates,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve just gone from having sort of a spike.</p>
<p>So if you get infected, maybe three days later,</p>
<p>the virus gets into exponential growth</p>
<p>and it can replicate to trillions of viruses</p>
<p>inside the body.</p>
<p>Your immune system then kind of tackles it</p>
<p>and beats it down to nothing.</p>
<p>But what ends up in the wake of that,</p>
<p>you just had a battle.</p>
<p>You had this massive battle that just took place</p>
<p>inside your upper respiratory tract.</p>
<p>And because of that, you&rsquo;ve had trillions and trillions</p>
<p>of viruses go to zero, essentially.</p>
<p>But the RNA is still there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just these remnants.</p>
<p>In the same way that if you go to a crime scene</p>
<p>and blood was sort of spread all over the crime scene,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find a lot of DNA.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of DNA.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no people anymore, but there&rsquo;s a lot of DNA there.</p>
<p>Same thing happens here.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happening with PCR testing</p>
<p>is when people go and use these exceedingly high sensitivity</p>
<p>PCR tests, people will stay positive for weeks or months</p>
<p>after their infection has subsided,</p>
<p>which has caused a lot of problems, in my opinion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s problems that the CDC and the FDA and doctors</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to deal with.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve tried to publish on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to suggest that this is an issue,</p>
<p>both to New York Times and others.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s unfortunately kind of taken</p>
<p>on a life of its own of conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>thinking that they call it a case demic.</p>
<p>They say, oh, you know, PCR is detecting people</p>
<p>who are no longer, who are false positive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not false positives.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re late positives, no longer transmissible.</p>
<p>I think the way you, like what I saw in rapidtest.org,</p>
<p>I really liked the distinction between diagnostic</p>
<p>sensitivity and contagiousness sensitivity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s so, that website is so obvious</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s painful because it&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we should be talking about is</p>
<p>how accurately is a test able to detect your contagiousness?</p>
<p>And you have different plots that show that actually</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, you know, that antigen tests,</p>
<p>the tests we&rsquo;re looking at today, like rapid tests,</p>
<p>are actually really good at detecting contagiousness.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It all mixes back with this whole idea that,</p>
<p>of the medical industrial complex.</p>
<p>You know, in this country, and in most countries,</p>
<p>we have almost entirely defunded</p>
<p>and devalued public health, period.</p>
<p>You know, we just have.</p>
<p>And what that means is that we don&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a language for it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a lexicon for it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a regulatory landscape for it.</p>
<p>And so the only window we have to look at a test today</p>
<p>is as a medical diagnostic test.</p>
<p>And that becomes very problematic when we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to tackle a public health threat</p>
<p>and a public health emergency.</p>
<p>By definition, this is a public health emergency</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And yet we keep evaluating tests</p>
<p>as though the diagnostic benchmark is the gold standard.</p>
<p>Where if I&rsquo;m a physician, I am a physician,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll put on that physician hat for a moment.</p>
<p>And if I have a patient who comes to me</p>
<p>and wants to know if their symptoms are a result of them</p>
<p>having COVID, then I want every shred of evidence</p>
<p>that I can get to see, does this person currently</p>
<p>or did they recently have this infection inside of them?</p>
<p>And so in that sense, the PCR test is the perfect test.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really sensitive.</p>
<p>It will find the RNA if it&rsquo;s there at all</p>
<p>so that I could say, you know, yeah,</p>
<p>you have a low amount of RNA left.</p>
<p>You might&rsquo;ve been, you said your symptoms</p>
<p>started two weeks ago.</p>
<p>You probably were infectious two weeks ago</p>
<p>and you have lingering symptoms from it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a medical diagnosis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a detective recreating a crime scene.</p>
<p>They wanna go back there and recreate the pieces</p>
<p>so that they can assign blame or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not public health.</p>
<p>In public health, we need to only look forward.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t wanna go back and say,</p>
<p>well, was this person, are there symptoms</p>
<p>because they had an infection two weeks ago?</p>
<p>In public health, we just wanna stop the virus</p>
<p>from spreading to the next person.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where we don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>if somebody was infected two weeks ago.</p>
<p>We only care about finding the people</p>
<p>who are infectious today.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, our regulatory landscape</p>
<p>fails to apply that knowledge</p>
<p>to evaluate these tests as public health tools.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only evaluating the tests as medical tools.</p>
<p>And therefore, we get all kinds of complaints</p>
<p>that say this test, which detects 99 plus,</p>
<p>99.8% of current infectious people,</p>
<p>by the FDA&rsquo;s rubric, they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>no, no, it&rsquo;s only 50% sensitive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because when you go out into the world</p>
<p>and you just compare this against PCR positivity,</p>
<p>most people who are PCR positive in the world right now</p>
<p>at any given time are post infectious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re no longer infectious</p>
<p>because you might only be infectious for five days,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;ll remain PCR positive</p>
<p>for three or four or five weeks.</p>
<p>And so when you go and just evaluate these tests</p>
<p>and you say, okay, this person&rsquo;s PCR positive,</p>
<p>does the rapid antigen test detect that?</p>
<p>More often than not, it&rsquo;s no.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because those people don&rsquo;t need isolation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re post infectious.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s become much more of a problem</p>
<p>than I think even the FDA themself is recognizing</p>
<p>because they are unwilling at this point</p>
<p>to look at this as a public health problem</p>
<p>requiring public health tools.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll definitely talk about this a little bit more</p>
<p>because the concern I have is that</p>
<p>a bigger pandemic comes along.</p>
<p>What are the lessons we draw from this</p>
<p>and how we move forward?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that in a bit.</p>
<p>But sort of, can we discuss further the lay of the land here</p>
<p>of the different tests before us?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So I talked about PCR tests and those are done in the lab</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re done essentially with a rapid test like this,</p>
<p>the detect, and we can even try this in a moment.</p>
<p>It goes into a little heater.</p>
<p>So you might have one of these in a household</p>
<p>or one of these in a nursing home or something like that</p>
<p>or in an airport.</p>
<p>Or you could have one that has 100 different outlets.</p>
<p>This is just to heat the tube up.</p>
<p>These are the rapid tests.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re super simple, no frills.</p>
<p>You just swab your nose and you put the swab into a buffer</p>
<p>and you put the buffer on the test.</p>
<p>So we can use these right now if you want.</p>
<p>We can try it out.</p>
<p>And all the tests we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually swabbing the nose.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still the main, yeah.</p>
<p>There are some saliva tests coming about</p>
<p>and these can all work potentially with saliva.</p>
<p>They just have to be recalibrated.</p>
<p>But these swabs are really not bad.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the deep swab that goes like way back</p>
<p>into your nose or anything.</p>
<p>This is just a swab that you do yourself</p>
<p>like right in the front of your nose.</p>
<p>So if you wanna do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you mind if I?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, why don&rsquo;t we start with this one?</p>
<p>Because this is Abbott&rsquo;s Buy Next Now test</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really, it&rsquo;s pretty simple.</p>
<p>This is the swab from the Abbott test.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the swab from the Abbott test.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m gonna do to start</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m going to take this buffer here,</p>
<p>which is, this is just the buffer</p>
<p>that goes onto this test.</p>
<p>So this is a brand new one.</p>
<p>I just opened this test out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna just take six drops of this buffer</p>
<p>and put it right onto this test here.</p>
<p>Two, three, four, five, six.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re gonna take that swab, open it up.</p>
<p>Yep, and now just wipe it around inside the,</p>
<p>into the front of your nose.</p>
<p>Do a few circles on each nostril.</p>
<p>That looks good.</p>
<p>This always makes me wanna sneeze.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, now I&rsquo;m gonna have you do it yourself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting emotional.</p>
<p>Hold it parallel to the test.</p>
<p>So put the test down on the table.</p>
<p>Yep, and then go into that bottom hole.</p>
<p>Yep, and push forward</p>
<p>so that you can start to see it in the other hole.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Now turn, if it&rsquo;s, once it hits up against the top,</p>
<p>just turn it three times.</p>
<p>One, two, three, and sort of, yep.</p>
<p>And now you just close,</p>
<p>so pull off that adhesive sticker there.</p>
<p>And now you just close the whole thing.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Now what we will see</p>
<p>is we will see a line form.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening now is the buffer that you put in there</p>
<p>is now moving up onto the paper strip test,</p>
<p>and it has the material from the swab in there.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;ll see is a line will form,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna be the control line.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll also see the,</p>
<p>ideally we&rsquo;ll see no line for the actual line.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see no line for the actual test line.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because you should be negative.</p>
<p>So one line will be positive and two lines will be negative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very cool.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this purple thing creeping up</p>
<p>onto the control line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you wanna be seeing.</p>
<p>So you want to see that,</p>
<p>so right now you essentially want to see</p>
<p>that that blue line turns pink or purply color.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a blue line that&rsquo;s already there printed.</p>
<p>It should turn sort of a purple pink color.</p>
<p>And ideally there will be no additional line for the sample.</p>
<p>And if there is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the 99 point whatever percent accuracy on,</p>
<p>that means I have, I&rsquo;m contagious.</p>
<p>That would mean that you&rsquo;re likely contagious</p>
<p>or you likely have infectious virus in you.</p>
<p>What we can do,</p>
<p>because one of the things that my plan calls for</p>
<p>is because sometimes these tests</p>
<p>can get false positive results, it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>Maybe 1% or in the case of this Binex now,</p>
<p>this Abbott test 0.1%.</p>
<p>So one in a thousand, one in 500,</p>
<p>something like that can be falsely positive.</p>
<p>What I recommend is that when somebody is positive</p>
<p>on one of these,</p>
<p>you turn around and you immediately test</p>
<p>on a different test.</p>
<p>You could either do it on the same,</p>
<p>but for good measure,</p>
<p>you want to use a separate test</p>
<p>that is somewhat orthogonal,</p>
<p>meaning that it shouldn&rsquo;t turn falsely positive</p>
<p>for the same reason.</p>
<p>This particular test here,</p>
<p>this detect test because it is looking for the RNA</p>
<p>and not the antigen,</p>
<p>this is an amazingly accurate test</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of a perfect gold standard</p>
<p>or confirmatory test for any of these antigen tests.</p>
<p>So one of the recommendations that I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>especially if people start using antigen tests</p>
<p>before you get onto a plane</p>
<p>or as what I call entrance screening,</p>
<p>if somebody is positive,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t immediately tell them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re positive, go isolate for 10 days.</p>
<p>You tell them, let&rsquo;s confirm on one of these,</p>
<p>on a detect test.</p>
<p>That is because it&rsquo;s completely orthogonal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s looking for the RNA instead of the antigen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason, no biological reason</p>
<p>that both of these should be falsely positive.</p>
<p>So if one&rsquo;s falsely positive and the other one is negative,</p>
<p>especially because this one&rsquo;s more sensitive,</p>
<p>then I would trust this as a confirmatory test.</p>
<p>If this one&rsquo;s negative, then the antigen test</p>
<p>would be considered falsely positive.</p>
<p>It does look like there&rsquo;s only a single line,</p>
<p>so this is very exciting news.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, yep.</p>
<p>It says wait 15 minutes to see both lines,</p>
<p>but in general, if somebody&rsquo;s really gonna be positive,</p>
<p>that line starts showing up within a minute or two.</p>
<p>So you wanna keep the whole,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll keep watching it for the whole 15 minutes</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s sitting there, but I would say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re knowing that you&rsquo;ve had PCR tests recently</p>
<p>and all that.</p>
<p>The odds are pretty good.</p>
<p>The odds are very good.</p>
<p>The packaging, very iPhone like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m digging the sexy packaging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for good packaging, okay.</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s this test here,</p>
<p>which is, this is another, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Let me open this up and show you.</p>
<p>This is a really nice test.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another antigen test.</p>
<p>Works the exact same way as this, essentially,</p>
<p>but what you can see is it&rsquo;s got lights in it</p>
<p>and a power button and stuff.</p>
<p>This is called an allume test, which is fine,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a really nice test, to be honest,</p>
<p>but it has to pair with an iPhone.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s good as a,</p>
<p>I think that this is gonna become,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of use for this from a medical perspective,</p>
<p>where you want good reporting.</p>
<p>This can, because it pairs with an iPhone,</p>
<p>it can immediately send the report</p>
<p>to a department of health,</p>
<p>whereas these paper strip tests, they&rsquo;re just paper.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t report anything unless you wanna report it.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m gonna just pick it apart.</p>
<p>And so you can see is there&rsquo;s fluorescent readers</p>
<p>and little lasers and LEDs and stuff in there.</p>
<p>You can actually see the lights going off.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a paper strip test right inside there,</p>
<p>but you can see that there&rsquo;s a whole circuit board</p>
<p>and all this stuff, right?</p>
<p>And so this is the kind of thing</p>
<p>that the FDA is looking for,</p>
<p>for home use and things like that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of foolproof.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go wrong with it.</p>
<p>It pairs with an iPhone, so you need Bluetooth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be more limited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great test, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as good as any of these.</p>
<p>But when you compare this thing with a battery</p>
<p>and a circuit board and all this stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got its purpose, but it&rsquo;s not a public health tool.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna see this made in the tens of millions a day</p>
<p>and thrown away.</p>
<p>This is just.</p>
<p>But FDA likes that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>FDA loves this stuff,</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t get it out of their mind</p>
<p>that this is a public health crisis.</p>
<p>We need, I mean, just look at the difference here.</p>
<p>Something with flashing lights is essential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got batteries, it&rsquo;s got a Bluetooth thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great test, but to be honest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not any better than this one.</p>
<p>And so I want this one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice and all.</p>
<p>The form factor is nice,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really nice that it goes to Bluetooth.</p>
<p>But it goes against the principle of just 20 million a day.</p>
<p>The easy solution, everybody has it.</p>
<p>You can manufacture and probably,</p>
<p>you could&rsquo;ve probably scaled this up in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>These companies, I mean, the rest of the world has these.</p>
<p>They can be scaled up.</p>
<p>They already exist.</p>
<p>You know, SD biosensors,</p>
<p>one company&rsquo;s making tens of millions a day,</p>
<p>not coming to the United States,</p>
<p>but going all over Europe,</p>
<p>going all over Southeast Asia and East Asia.</p>
<p>So they exist.</p>
<p>The US is just, you know, we can&rsquo;t get out of our own way.</p>
<p>I wonder why somebody,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you were paying attention,</p>
<p>but somebody like an Elon Musk type character.</p>
<p>So he was really into doing</p>
<p>some like obvious engineering solution,</p>
<p>like this at home rapid test</p>
<p>seems like a very Elon Musk thing to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw,</p>
<p>but I had a little Twitter conversation with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Does he not like, what is he,</p>
<p>do you know what his thoughts are on rapid testing?</p>
<p>Well, he was using a slightly different one,</p>
<p>one of these, but that requires an instrument</p>
<p>called the BD Veritor.</p>
<p>And he got a false positive,</p>
<p>or no, I shouldn&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t necessarily get a false positive.</p>
<p>He got discrepant results.</p>
<p>He did this test four times.</p>
<p>He got two positives, two negatives,</p>
<p>but then he got a PCR test</p>
<p>and it was a very low positive result.</p>
<p>So I think what happened is he just tested himself</p>
<p>at the tail end of an,</p>
<p>this was actually right before he was about to send those.</p>
<p>It was the day of essentially that he was sending</p>
<p>the astronauts up to the space station the other day.</p>
<p>So he was using these rapid tests</p>
<p>cause he wanted to make sure that he was good to go in</p>
<p>and he got discrepant results.</p>
<p>Ultimately they were correct,</p>
<p>but two were negative, two were positive.</p>
<p>But what really happened once he shared his PCR results</p>
<p>and they were very low positive.</p>
<p>So really what was happening is,</p>
<p>my guess is he found himself right at the edge</p>
<p>of his positivity, of his infectiousness.</p>
<p>And so the test worked how it was supposed to work.</p>
<p>It probably had he used it two days earlier,</p>
<p>it would have been screaming positive.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten discrepant results,</p>
<p>but he found himself right at the edge</p>
<p>by the time he used the test.</p>
<p>So the PCR would always pick it up</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s still, cause that will still stay positive</p>
<p>then for weeks potentially.</p>
<p>But the rapid antigen test was starting to falter,</p>
<p>not in a bad way,</p>
<p>but just he probably was really no longer</p>
<p>particularly infectious.</p>
<p>And so it was kind of when it gets to be a very low viral</p>
<p>load, it becomes stochastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating this duality.</p>
<p>So one you can think from an individual perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear when you take four and half are positive,</p>
<p>half are negative, like what are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>But from a societal perspective,</p>
<p>it seems like if just one of them is positive,</p>
<p>just stay home for a couple of days, for a while.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re a CEO of a company,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re launching astronauts to space,</p>
<p>you may not want to rely absolutely on the antigen test</p>
<p>as a thing by which you steer your decisions</p>
<p>of like 10,000 plus people companies.</p>
<p>But us individuals just living in the world,</p>
<p>if you can, if it comes up positive,</p>
<p>then you make decisions based on that.</p>
<p>And then that scales really nicely to an entire society</p>
<p>of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you get that virus to stop spreading.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to catch every single one.</p>
<p>And the nice thing is that these will,</p>
<p>these will catch the people who are most infectious.</p>
<p>So with Elon Musk, it generally that test,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the counterfactual.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have his results from three days earlier</p>
<p>when he was probably most infectious.</p>
<p>But my guess is the fact that it was catching two</p>
<p>out of the four, even when he was down at a CT value</p>
<p>of really, really very, very low viral load on the PCR test</p>
<p>suggests that it was doing its job.</p>
<p>And you just wanna, and the nice thing is</p>
<p>because these can be produced at such scale,</p>
<p>getting one positive doesn&rsquo;t immediately have to mean</p>
<p>10 days of isolation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the CDC is more conservative stance to say,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re positive on any tests,</p>
<p>stay home for 10 days and isolate.</p>
<p>But here, people would just have more tests.</p>
<p>So the recommendation should be test daily.</p>
<p>If you turn positive, test daily</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;ve been negative for 24, 48 hours</p>
<p>and then go back to work.</p>
<p>And the nice thing there is right now,</p>
<p>people just aren&rsquo;t testing</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t wanna take 10 days off.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not getting paid for it.</p>
<p>So they can&rsquo;t take 10 days off.</p>
<p>Do you know what Elon thinks about this idea</p>
<p>of rapid testing for everybody?</p>
<p>So I understood I need to look at that whole Twitter thread.</p>
<p>So I understand his perhaps criticism of,</p>
<p>he had like a conspiratorial tone from my vague look at it</p>
<p>of like, what&rsquo;s going on here with these tests?</p>
<p>But what does he actually think about</p>
<p>this very practical to me engineering solution</p>
<p>of just deploying rapid tests to everybody?</p>
<p>It seems like that&rsquo;s a way to open up the economy in April.</p>
<p>Well, to be honest,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get in touch with him again.</p>
<p>I think, take somebody like Elon Musk</p>
<p>with the engineering prowess within his ranks,</p>
<p>to easily, easily build these at the tens of millions a day.</p>
<p>He could build the machines from scratch.</p>
<p>A lot of the companies,</p>
<p>they buy the machines from South Korea or Taiwan, I believe.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to, we can build these machines.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re simple to build.</p>
<p>Put somebody like Elon Musk on it,</p>
<p>take some of his best engineers and say,</p>
<p>look, the US needs a solution in two weeks.</p>
<p>Build these machines, figure it out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll do it, he could do it.</p>
<p>This is a guy who is literally,</p>
<p>he has started multiple entirely new industries.</p>
<p>He has the capital to do it without the US government</p>
<p>if he wanted to.</p>
<p>And you know what, it would,</p>
<p>the return on investment for him would be huge.</p>
<p>But frankly, the return on investment in the country</p>
<p>would be hundreds of billions of dollars,</p>
<p>because it means we could get society open.</p>
<p>So I know that his first experience</p>
<p>with these rapid tests was confusing,</p>
<p>which is how I ended up having this Twitter</p>
<p>kind of conversation with him very briefly.</p>
<p>But I think that if he understood</p>
<p>sort of a little bit more, and I think he does,</p>
<p>I really love to talk to him about it,</p>
<p>because I think he could totally change</p>
<p>the course of this pandemic in the United States,</p>
<p>single handedly.</p>
<p>He loves grand things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think out of all the solutions I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>this is the obvious engineering solution</p>
<p>to at least a pandemic of this scale.</p>
<p>I love that you say the engineering solution.</p>
<p>So this is something I&rsquo;ve been really trying to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an engineer, my previous history was all engineering,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really how I think.</p>
<p>I then went into medicine and PhD world,</p>
<p>but I think that the world,</p>
<p>like one of the major catastrophes,</p>
<p>or one of the major problems,</p>
<p>is that we have physicians making the decisions</p>
<p>about public health and a pandemic,</p>
<p>when really we need engineers.</p>
<p>This is an engineering problem.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;ve been trying to do,</p>
<p>I actually really want to start a whole new field</p>
<p>called public health engineering.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been, eventually I want to try</p>
<p>to bring it to MIT and get MIT</p>
<p>to want to start a new department or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a doubly awesome idea.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That, this is really, okay.</p>
<p>I love this, I love every aspect.</p>
<p>I love everything you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>A lot of people believe,</p>
<p>because vaccines started being deployed currently,</p>
<p>that we are no longer in need of a solution.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re no longer in need of slowing the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>To me, as I understand,</p>
<p>it seems like this is the most important time</p>
<p>to have something like a rapid testing solution.</p>
<p>Can you kind of break that apart?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of rapid testing currently</p>
<p>in the next, what is it, three, four months maybe?</p>
<p>Even more.</p>
<p>The vaccine rollout isn&rsquo;t gonna be as peachy</p>
<p>as everyone is hoping.</p>
<p>And I hate to be the Debbie Downer here,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of unknowns with this vaccine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already mentioned one,</p>
<p>which is there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who just don&rsquo;t want to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>I hope that that might change as things move forward</p>
<p>and people see their neighbors getting it</p>
<p>and their family getting it and it&rsquo;s safe and all.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know how effective the vaccine is gonna be</p>
<p>after two or three months.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only measured it in the first two or three months,</p>
<p>which is a massive problem,</p>
<p>which we can go into biologically,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s very good reasons to believe</p>
<p>that the efficacy could fall way down</p>
<p>after two or three months.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna stop transmission.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t stop transmission,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>herd immunity is much, much more difficult to get</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s all based on transmission blockade.</p>
<p>And frankly, we don&rsquo;t know how easily</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be able to roll it out.</p>
<p>Some of the vaccines need really significant cold chains,</p>
<p>have very short half lives outside of that cold chain.</p>
<p>We need to organize massive numbers of people</p>
<p>to be able to distribute these.</p>
<p>Most hospitals today are saying that they&rsquo;re not equipped</p>
<p>to hire the right people</p>
<p>to be even administering enough of these vaccines.</p>
<p>And then a lot of the hospitals</p>
<p>are frustrated because they&rsquo;re getting much lower,</p>
<p>smaller allocations than they were expecting.</p>
<p>So I think right now, like you say,</p>
<p>right now is the best time,</p>
<p>you know, besides three or four or five or six months ago,</p>
<p>right now is the best time to get these rapid tests out.</p>
<p>And we need to, I mean,</p>
<p>the country has the capacity to build them.</p>
<p>We have, we&rsquo;re shipping them overseas right now.</p>
<p>We just need to flip a switch,</p>
<p>get the FDA to recognize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s more important things than diagnostic medicine,</p>
<p>which is the effectiveness of the public health program</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re dealing with a pandemic.</p>
<p>They need to authorize these as public health tools,</p>
<p>or, you know, frankly, the president could,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of other ways to get these tests</p>
<p>to not have to go through</p>
<p>the normal FDA authorization program,</p>
<p>but maybe have the NIH and the CDC give a stamp of approval.</p>
<p>And if we could, we could get these out tomorrow.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where that article came from,</p>
<p>you know, how we can stop the spread of this virus</p>
<p>by Christmas, we could, you know, now it&rsquo;s getting late.</p>
<p>And so we have to keep updating that timeframe,</p>
<p>maybe putting Christmas in the title wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I should have said how we can stop</p>
<p>the spread of this virus in a month.</p>
<p>It would be a little bit more timeless,</p>
<p>but we could do it, you know, we really could do it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the most frustrating part here is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just choosing not to as a country.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re choosing to bankrupt our society</p>
<p>because some people at the FDA and other places</p>
<p>just can&rsquo;t seem to get their head around the fact</p>
<p>that this is a public health problem,</p>
<p>not a bunch of medical problems.</p>
<p>Is there a way to change that policy wise?</p>
<p>So this is a much bigger thing that you&rsquo;re speaking to,</p>
<p>which I love in terms of the MIT engineering approach</p>
<p>to public health.</p>
<p>Is there a way to push this?</p>
<p>Is this a political thing?</p>
<p>Like where some Andrew Yang type characters</p>
<p>need to like start screaming about it?</p>
<p>Is it more of an Elon Musk thing</p>
<p>where people just need to build it</p>
<p>and then on Twitter start talking crap</p>
<p>to politicians for not doing it?</p>
<p>What are the ideas here?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little of both.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s political on the one hand,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve certainly been talking to Congress a lot,</p>
<p>talking to senators.</p>
<p>Are they receptive?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the crazy thing.</p>
<p>Everyone but the FDA is receptive.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s astounding.</p>
<p>I mean, I advise, informally I advise the president</p>
<p>and the president elects teams.</p>
<p>I talk to Congress, I talk to senators, governors,</p>
<p>and then all the way down to mayors of towns and things.</p>
<p>And I mean, months ago I held a round table discussion</p>
<p>with Mayor Garcetti, who&rsquo;s the mayor of LA,</p>
<p>and I brought all the companies who make these things.</p>
<p>This was in like July or August or something.</p>
<p>I brought all the companies to the table</p>
<p>and said, okay, how can we get these out?</p>
<p>And unfortunately, it went nowhere</p>
<p>because the FDA won&rsquo;t authorize them</p>
<p>as public health tools.</p>
<p>The nice thing is that this is one of the nice</p>
<p>and frustrating things.</p>
<p>This is one of the few bipartisan things that I know of.</p>
<p>And like you said, it&rsquo;s a real solution.</p>
<p>Lockdowns aren&rsquo;t a solution.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re an emergency bandaid to a catastrophe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s currently happening.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a solution.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re definitely not a public health solution</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re taking a more holistic view of public health,</p>
<p>which includes people&rsquo;s wellbeing,</p>
<p>includes their psychological wellbeing,</p>
<p>their financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>Just stopping a virus if it means</p>
<p>that all those other things get thrown under the bus</p>
<p>is not a public health solution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a myopic or very tunnel visioned approach</p>
<p>to a virus that&rsquo;s spreading.</p>
<p>This is a simple solution with essentially no downfall.</p>
<p>There is nothing bad about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just giving people a result.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s bipartisan.</p>
<p>The most conservative and the most liberal people,</p>
<p>everyone just wants to know their status.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to have to wait in line for four hours</p>
<p>to find out their status on Monday,</p>
<p>a week later, on Saturday.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a useless test at that point.</p>
<p>And everyone recognizes that.</p>
<p>So why do you think, like the mayor of LA,</p>
<p>why do you think politicians are going for these,</p>
<p>from my perspective, like kind of half ass lockdowns,</p>
<p>which is not, so I have seen good evidence</p>
<p>that like a complete lockdown can work,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s in theory, it&rsquo;s just like communism in theory</p>
<p>can work.</p>
<p>Like theoretically speaking, but it just doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>at least in this country, we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just impossible to have complete lockdown.</p>
<p>And still politicians are going for these kind of lockdowns</p>
<p>that everybody hates,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really hurting small businesses.</p>
<p>Like why are they going for that?</p>
<p>And big businesses, and yeah, all businesses,</p>
<p>but like basically not just hurting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re destroying small businesses, right?</p>
<p>Which is going to have potentially, I mean,</p>
<p>yeah, I&rsquo;ve been reading as I don&rsquo;t shut up</p>
<p>about the rise and fall of the Third Reich,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s economic effects that take a decade to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be long lasting effects</p>
<p>that may be destructive to the very fabric of this nation.</p>
<p>So why are they doing it,</p>
<p>and why are they not using the solution?</p>
<p>Is there any intuition?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve said that FDA has a stranglehold, I guess,</p>
<p>on this whole public health problem.</p>
<p>Is that all it is?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s honestly, it&rsquo;s pretty much all it is.</p>
<p>The companies, so somebody like Mayor Garcetti</p>
<p>or Governor Baker, Cuomo, Newsom,</p>
<p>any of these, DeWine, I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of governors</p>
<p>in this country at this point,</p>
<p>and of course the federal government,</p>
<p>including the president&rsquo;s own teams,</p>
<p>and the heads of the NIH, the heads of the CDC about this.</p>
<p>The problem is the tests don&rsquo;t exist in this country</p>
<p>at the level that we need them to right now</p>
<p>to make that kind of policy, to make that kind of program.</p>
<p>They could, but they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so what that means is that when Mayor Garcetti says,</p>
<p>okay, what are my actual options today,</p>
<p>despite these sounding like a great idea,</p>
<p>he looks around and he says, well, they&rsquo;re not authorized.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t exist right now for at home use.</p>
<p>And from his perspective,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not about to pick that fight with the FDA,</p>
<p>and it turns out nobody is.</p>
<p>Why are people afraid of,</p>
<p>it seems like an easy struggle to fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a&hellip;</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t see it as a fight.</p>
<p>They think that the FDA is the end all be all.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks the FDA is the end all be all.</p>
<p>And so they just defer, everyone is deferential,</p>
<p>including the heads of all the other government agencies</p>
<p>because that is their role.</p>
<p>But what everyone is failing to see</p>
<p>is that the FDA doesn&rsquo;t even have a mandate or a remit</p>
<p>to evaluate these tests as public health tools.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just falling in this weird gray zone</p>
<p>where the FDA is saying, look,</p>
<p>we evaluate medical products.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing that I meant,</p>
<p>like Tim Stenzel, head of in vitro diagnostics at the FDA,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing what his job is,</p>
<p>which is to evaluate medical tools.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is where I think the CDC</p>
<p>has really blundered.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t made the right distinction to say, look,</p>
<p>okay, the FDA is evaluating these for doctors to use</p>
<p>and all that, but we&rsquo;re the CDC</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re the public health agency of this country</p>
<p>and we recognize that these tools</p>
<p>require a different authorization pathway</p>
<p>and a different use, not prescription.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between medical devices</p>
<p>and public health.</p>
<p>And I guess FDA is not designed for this public health,</p>
<p>especially in emergency situations.</p>
<p>And they actually explicitly say that.</p>
<p>I mean, when I go and talk to Tim,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a very reasonable guy,</p>
<p>but when I talk to him, he says,</p>
<p>look, we don&rsquo;t, we just do not evaluate</p>
<p>a public health tool.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re telling me this is a public health tool,</p>
<p>great, go and use it.</p>
<p>And so I say, okay, great, we&rsquo;ll go and use it.</p>
<p>And then the comment is,</p>
<p>but does it give a result back to somebody?</p>
<p>I say, well, yes, of course it gives a result</p>
<p>back to somebody, it&rsquo;s being done in their home.</p>
<p>So then it&rsquo;s defined as a medical tool, can&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s stuck in this gray zone where unfortunately,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this weird definition that any tool,</p>
<p>any test that gives a result back to an individual</p>
<p>is defined by CMS, Centers for Medicaid Services,</p>
<p>as a medical device requiring medical authorization.</p>
<p>But then you go and ask, it gets crazier,</p>
<p>because then you go and ask Seema Verma,</p>
<p>the head of CMS, you know, okay,</p>
<p>can these be authorized as public health tools</p>
<p>and not fall under your definition of a medical device?</p>
<p>So then the FDA doesn&rsquo;t have to be the ones</p>
<p>authorizing it as a public health tool.</p>
<p>And Seema Verma says, oh, we don&rsquo;t have any jurisdiction</p>
<p>over point of care and sort of rapid devices like this.</p>
<p>We only have jurisdiction over lab devices.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like nobody has ownership over it,</p>
<p>which means that they just keep,</p>
<p>they stay in this purgatory of not being approved.</p>
<p>And so this is where I think, frankly, it needs a president.</p>
<p>It needs a presidential order to just unlock them,</p>
<p>to say this is more important than having a prescription.</p>
<p>And in fact, I mean, really what&rsquo;s happening now,</p>
<p>because there is this sense that tests</p>
<p>are public health tools,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not being defined as such,</p>
<p>the FDA now is pretty much,</p>
<p>not only are they not authorizing these</p>
<p>as public health tools,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing by authorizing</p>
<p>what are effectively public health tools as medical devices,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just diluting down the practice of medicine.</p>
<p>I mean, his answer right now, unfortunately is,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t know why you want these to be</p>
<p>sort of available to everyone without a prescription.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already said that a doctor can write</p>
<p>a whole prescription for a whole college campus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, if you&rsquo;re going in that direction then,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s no longer medicine,</p>
<p>having a doctor write a prescription for a college campus,</p>
<p>for everyone on the campus to have repeat testing,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re just in the territory of eroding medicine</p>
<p>and eroding all of the legal rules</p>
<p>and reasons that we have prescriptions in the first place.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just everything about it is just destructive</p>
<p>instead of just making a simple solution,</p>
<p>which is these are okay as public health tools</p>
<p>as long as they meet X and Y metrics,</p>
<p>go and CDC can put their stamp of approval on them.</p>
<p>What do you think, sorry if I&rsquo;m stuck on this,</p>
<p>your mention of MIT and public health engineering, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it has a sense of,</p>
<p>I talked to computational biology folks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always exciting to see computer scientists</p>
<p>start entering the space of biology.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a lot of exciting things</p>
<p>that happen because of that,</p>
<p>trying to understand the fundamentals of biology.</p>
<p>So from the engineering approach to public health,</p>
<p>what kind of problems do you think can be tackled?</p>
<p>What kind of disciplines are involved?</p>
<p>Like, do you have ideas in this space?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I can speak to one of the major activities</p>
<p>that I wanna do.</p>
<p>So what I normally do in my research lab</p>
<p>is develop technologies that can take a drop</p>
<p>of somebody&rsquo;s blood or some saliva</p>
<p>and profile for hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of different antibodies against every single pathogen</p>
<p>that somebody could be possibly exposed to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So this is all new technology</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been developing more</p>
<p>from a bioengineering perspective.</p>
<p>But then I use a lot of the mathematics tools</p>
<p>to A, interpret that.</p>
<p>But what I really wanna do, for example,</p>
<p>to kind of kick off this new field</p>
<p>of what I consider public health engineering</p>
<p>is to create, maybe it&rsquo;s a little ambitious,</p>
<p>but create a weather system for viruses.</p>
<p>I want us to be able to open up our iPhones,</p>
<p>plug in our zip code and get a better sense,</p>
<p>get a probability of why my kid has a runny nose today.</p>
<p>Is it COVID?</p>
<p>Is it a rhinovirus, an adenovirus, or is it flu?</p>
<p>And we can do that.</p>
<p>We can start building the rules of virus spread</p>
<p>across the globe, both for pandemic preparedness,</p>
<p>but also for just everyday use in the same way</p>
<p>that people used to think that predicting the weather</p>
<p>was gonna be impossible.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that&rsquo;s not impossible now.</p>
<p>Is it always perfect?</p>
<p>No, but does it offer, does it completely change the way</p>
<p>that we go about our days?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I envision, for example, right now,</p>
<p>we open up our iPhone, we plug in a zip code,</p>
<p>and if it tells us it&rsquo;s gonna rain today,</p>
<p>we bring an umbrella.</p>
<p>So in the future, it tells us,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s a lot of SARS CoV2 in your community.</p>
<p>Instead of grabbing your umbrella, you grab your mask.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to have masks all the time.</p>
<p>But if we know the rules of the game</p>
<p>that these viruses play by,</p>
<p>we can start preparing for those.</p>
<p>And every year, we go into every flu season blindfolded</p>
<p>with our hands tied behind our back, just saying,</p>
<p>I hope this isn&rsquo;t a bad flu season this year.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I mean, this is, we&rsquo;re in the 21st century.</p>
<p>We have the tools at our disposal now</p>
<p>to not have that attitude.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t like 1920s.</p>
<p>You know, we can just say,</p>
<p>hey, this is gonna be a bad flu season this year.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s act accordingly and with a targeted approach.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t, for example,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t just use our umbrellas all day long,</p>
<p>every single day, in case it might rain.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t board up our homes every single day</p>
<p>in case there&rsquo;s a hurricane.</p>
<p>We wait, and if we know that there&rsquo;s one coming,</p>
<p>then we act for a small period of time accordingly.</p>
<p>And then we go back, and we&rsquo;ve prepared ourselves</p>
<p>in like these little bursts to not have it ruin our days.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how exciting</p>
<p>that vision of the future is.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And it seems like it should be within our reach,</p>
<p>the, just these like weather maps of viruses</p>
<p>floating about the Earth, and it seems obvious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things where right now,</p>
<p>it seems like maybe impossible.</p>
<p>And then looking back like 20 years from now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll wonder like why the hell</p>
<p>this hasn&rsquo;t been done way earlier.</p>
<p>Though one difference between weather,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have interesting ideas in this space.</p>
<p>The difference between weather and viruses</p>
<p>is it includes, the collection of the data</p>
<p>includes the human body, potentially.</p>
<p>And that means that there is some, as with the contact</p>
<p>tracing question, there&rsquo;s some concern about privacy.</p>
<p>There seems to be this dance that&rsquo;s really complicated.</p>
<p>With Facebook getting a lot of flack</p>
<p>for basically misusing people&rsquo;s data,</p>
<p>or just whether it&rsquo;s perception or reality,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certainly a lot of reality to it too,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re not good stewards of our private data.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this weird place where it&rsquo;s like obvious</p>
<p>that if we do, if we collect a lot of data</p>
<p>about human beings and maintain privacy</p>
<p>and maintain all like basic respect for that data,</p>
<p>just like honestly common sense respect for the data,</p>
<p>that we can do a lot of amazing things for the world,</p>
<p>like a weather map for viruses.</p>
<p>Is there a way forward to gain trust of people</p>
<p>or to do this well, do you have ideas here?</p>
<p>How big is this problem?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a central problem.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple central problems that need to be solved.</p>
<p>One, how do you get all the samples?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not actually too difficult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually, I have a pilot project going right now</p>
<p>with getting samples from across all the United States.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of samples every week</p>
<p>are flowing into my lab and we process them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s taking the, it&rsquo;s taking like one of the,</p>
<p>basically there&rsquo;s biology here and chemistry</p>
<p>and converting that into numbers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re doing, for example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who go to the hospital every day,</p>
<p>a lot of people who donate blood, people who donate plasma.</p>
<p>So one of the projects that I have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to the privacy question in a moment,</p>
<p>but this, so what I wanna do is the name that I&rsquo;ve given</p>
<p>this as a global immunological observatory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason not to have that.</p>
<p>Good name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said, instead of saying, well,</p>
<p>how do we possibly get enough people on board</p>
<p>to send in samples all the time?</p>
<p>Well, just go to the source.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a company in Massachusetts</p>
<p>that makes 80% of all the instruments</p>
<p>that are used globally to collect plasma from plasma donors.</p>
<p>So I went to this company, Hemenetics, and said,</p>
<p>is there a way you have 80% of the global market</p>
<p>on plasma donations?</p>
<p>Can we start getting plasma samples</p>
<p>from healthy people that use your machines?</p>
<p>So that hooked me up with this company called Octopharma.</p>
<p>And Octopharma has a huge reach</p>
<p>and offices all over the country</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just collecting people&rsquo;s plasma.</p>
<p>They actually pay people for their plasma</p>
<p>and then that gets distributed to hospitals</p>
<p>and all this stuff is anonymous plasma.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve just been collecting anonymous samples.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re processing them, in this case,</p>
<p>for COVID antibodies to watch from January</p>
<p>up through December, we&rsquo;re able to watch</p>
<p>how the virus entered into the United States</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s transmitting every day across the US.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re getting those results organized now</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna start putting them publicly online soon</p>
<p>to start making at least a very rough map of COVID.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the type of thinking that I have</p>
<p>in terms of like, how do you actually capture</p>
<p>huge numbers of specimens?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t ask everyone to participate on sort of a,</p>
<p>I mean, you maybe could if you have the right tools</p>
<p>and you can offer individuals something in return</p>
<p>like 23andMe does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great way to get people to give specimens</p>
<p>and they get results back.</p>
<p>So with these technologies that I&rsquo;ve been building</p>
<p>along with some collaborators at Harvard,</p>
<p>we can come up with tools that people might actually want.</p>
<p>So I can offer you your immunological history.</p>
<p>I can say, give me a drop of your blood on a filter paper,</p>
<p>mail it in and I will be able to tell you</p>
<p>every infectious disease you&rsquo;ve ever encountered</p>
<p>and maybe even when you encountered it roughly.</p>
<p>I could tell you, do you have COVID antibodies right now?</p>
<p>Do you have Lyme disease antibodies right now?</p>
<p>Flu, triple E and all these different viruses.</p>
<p>Also peanut allergies, milk allergies, anything.</p>
<p>If your immune system makes a response to it,</p>
<p>we can detect that response.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden we have this very valuable technology</p>
<p>that on the one hand gives people maybe information</p>
<p>they might want to know about themselves,</p>
<p>but on the other hand becomes this amazingly rich</p>
<p>source of big data to enter into</p>
<p>this global immunological observatory</p>
<p>sort of mathematical framework to start building</p>
<p>these maps, these epidemiological tools.</p>
<p>But you asked about privacy</p>
<p>and absolutely that&rsquo;s essential to keep in mind</p>
<p>first and foremost.</p>
<p>So privacy can be,</p>
<p>you can keep these samples 100% anonymous.</p>
<p>They are just, when I get them, they show up with nothing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally just tubes.</p>
<p>I know a date that they were collected</p>
<p>and a zip code that they&rsquo;re collected from</p>
<p>or even just sort of a county level ID.</p>
<p>So with an IRB and with ethical approval</p>
<p>and with the people&rsquo;s consent,</p>
<p>we can maybe collect more data,</p>
<p>but that would require consent.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s this other approach</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m really excited about,</p>
<p>which is certainly going to gain some scrutiny I think,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll have to figure out where it comes into play.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been recognizing that we can take somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>immunological profile and we can make a biological</p>
<p>fingerprint out of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually stable enough</p>
<p>so that I could take your blood.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I don&rsquo;t know who you are,</p>
<p>but you sent me a drop of blood a year ago</p>
<p>and then you sent me a drop of blood today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that those two blood spots</p>
<p>are coming from the same person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just showing up in my lab.</p>
<p>But I can run our technology over</p>
<p>and it just gives me your immunological history.</p>
<p>But your immunological history is so unique to you</p>
<p>and the way that your body responds to these pathogens</p>
<p>is so unique to you</p>
<p>that I can use that to tether your two samples.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who you are, I know nothing about you.</p>
<p>I only know when those samples came out of a person.</p>
<p>But I can say, oh, these two samples a year apart</p>
<p>actually belong to the same person.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s sufficient information</p>
<p>in that immunological history to match the samples.</p>
<p>Or from a privacy perspective, that&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>Does that generally hold for humans?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s enough uniqueness to match?</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s very stochastic, even twins.</p>
<p>So this, I believe, we haven&rsquo;t published this yet.</p>
<p>We will soon.</p>
<p>You have a twin too, right?</p>
<p>I do have a twin, I have an identical twin brother,</p>
<p>which makes me interested in this.</p>
<p>He looks very much like me.</p>
<p>Oh, is that how that works?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And DNA can&rsquo;t really tell us apart.</p>
<p>But this tool is one of the only tools in the world</p>
<p>that could tell twins apart from each other.</p>
<p>Could still be accurate enough to say this blood,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 99.999% accurate to say</p>
<p>that these two blood samples came from the same individual.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a combination,</p>
<p>both of your immunological history,</p>
<p>but also how your unique body responds to a pathogen,</p>
<p>which is random.</p>
<p>The way that we make antibodies is, by and large,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got an element of randomness to it.</p>
<p>How the cells, when they make an antibody,</p>
<p>they chop up the genetic code to say,</p>
<p>okay, this is the antibody that I&rsquo;m gonna form</p>
<p>for this pathogen.</p>
<p>And you might form, if you get a coronavirus, for example,</p>
<p>you might form hundreds of different antibodies,</p>
<p>not just one antibody against the spike protein,</p>
<p>but hundreds of different antibodies</p>
<p>against all different parts of the virus.</p>
<p>So that gives this really rich resolution of information</p>
<p>that when I then do the same thing</p>
<p>across hundreds of different pathogens,</p>
<p>some of which you&rsquo;ve seen, some of which you haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it gives you an exceedingly unique fingerprint</p>
<p>that is sufficiently stable over years and years and years</p>
<p>to essentially give you a barcode.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have to know who you are,</p>
<p>but I can know that these two specimens</p>
<p>came from the same person somewhere out in the world.</p>
<p>So fascinating that there&rsquo;s this trace,</p>
<p>your life story in the space of viruses,</p>
<p>in the space of pathogen, like these,</p>
<p>you know, because there&rsquo;s this entire universe</p>
<p>of these organisms that are trying to destroy each other.</p>
<p>And then your little trajectory through that space</p>
<p>leaves a trace, and then you can look at that trace.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And that, I mean, there&rsquo;s, okay,</p>
<p>that data period is just fascinating.</p>
<p>And the vision of making that data universally connected</p>
<p>to where you can make, like infer things,</p>
<p>and just like with the weather, is really fascinating.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably artificial intelligence</p>
<p>applications there, start making predictions,</p>
<p>start finding patterns.</p>
<p>Exactly, we&rsquo;re doing a lot of that already.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how, how do we have this going?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve been trying to get this funded for years now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve spoken to governments, you know,</p>
<p>everyone says, cool idea, not gonna do it.</p>
<p>You know, why do we need it?</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>The why do you need it?</p>
<p>Yeah, the why do you need it.</p>
<p>And of course now, you know, I mean,</p>
<p>I wrote in 2015 about this,</p>
<p>why we would, why this would be useful.</p>
<p>And of course, now we&rsquo;re seeing why it would be useful.</p>
<p>Had we had this up and running in 2019,</p>
<p>had we had it going, we were drawing blood from,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re getting blood samples from hospitals</p>
<p>and clinics and blood donors from New York City,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say, you know, that could have,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t run the first PCR test for coronavirus</p>
<p>until probably a month and a half or two months</p>
<p>after the virus started transmitting in New York City.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like with the rain,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t start wearing umbrella or taking out umbrellas.</p>
<p>Exactly, for two months, but different than the rain,</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t actually see that it was spreading right now.</p>
<p>And so Andrew Cuomo had no choice</p>
<p>but to leave the city open.</p>
<p>You know, there were hints that maybe the virus</p>
<p>was spreading in New York City,</p>
<p>but you know, he didn&rsquo;t have any data to back it up.</p>
<p>No data.</p>
<p>And so it was just week on week and week.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t have any information to really go by</p>
<p>to allow him to have the firepower</p>
<p>to say we&rsquo;re closing down the city.</p>
<p>This is an emergency.</p>
<p>We have to stop spread before it starts.</p>
<p>And so they waited until the first PCR tests</p>
<p>were coming about.</p>
<p>And then the moment they started running PCR tests,</p>
<p>they find out it&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p>You know, and so that was a disaster</p>
<p>because of course New York City, you know,</p>
<p>was just hit so bad because nobody was,</p>
<p>you know, we were blind to it.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have to be blind to it.</p>
<p>And the nice thing about this technology is</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have, with the exact same technology</p>
<p>we had in 2017, we could have detected</p>
<p>this novel coronavirus spreading in New York City in 2020.</p>
<p>Not because we changed, not because we are actually</p>
<p>actively looking for this novel coronavirus,</p>
<p>but because we would see, we would have seen patterns</p>
<p>in people&rsquo;s immune responses using AI,</p>
<p>or just frankly using our, just the raw data itself.</p>
<p>We could have said, hey, it looks like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that looks like known coronavirus</p>
<p>is spreading in New York, but there&rsquo;s gaps.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s, for some reason,</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t developing an immune response</p>
<p>to this coronavirus that seems to be spreading</p>
<p>to these normal things that, you know,</p>
<p>and it just looks, the profile looks different.</p>
<p>And we could have seen that and immediately,</p>
<p>especially since we had an idea that</p>
<p>there was a novel coronavirus circulating in the world,</p>
<p>we could have very quickly and easily seen,</p>
<p>hey, clearly we&rsquo;re seeing a spike of something</p>
<p>that looks like a known coronavirus,</p>
<p>but people are responding weirdly to it.</p>
<p>Our AI algorithms would have picked it up,</p>
<p>and just our basic, heck, you could have put it</p>
<p>in an Excel spreadsheet, we would have seen it.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Some basic visualization would have shown it.</p>
<p>Exactly, we would have seen spikes,</p>
<p>and they would have been kind of like off, you know,</p>
<p>immune responses that the shape of them</p>
<p>just looked a little bit different,</p>
<p>but they would have been growing,</p>
<p>and we would have seen it, and it could have</p>
<p>saved tens of thousands of lives in New York City.</p>
<p>So to me, the fascinating question,</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>so both the huge collection of data at scale,</p>
<p>just super exciting, and then the kind of obvious</p>
<p>at scale solution to the current virus</p>
<p>and future ones is the rapid testing.</p>
<p>Can we talk about the future of viruses</p>
<p>that might be threatening our very existence?</p>
<p>So do you think like a future natural virus</p>
<p>can have an order of magnitude greater effect</p>
<p>on human civilization than anything we&rsquo;ve ever seen?</p>
<p>So something that either kills all humans,</p>
<p>or kills, I don&rsquo;t know, 60, 70% of humans.</p>
<p>So something like something we can&rsquo;t even imagine.</p>
<p>Is that something that you think is possible?</p>
<p>Because it seems to not have happened yet.</p>
<p>So maybe like the entirety, whoever the programmer is</p>
<p>of the simulation that sort of launched the evolution</p>
<p>from the Big Bang seems to not want to destroy us humans.</p>
<p>Or maybe that&rsquo;s the natural side effect</p>
<p>of the evolutionary process that humans are useful.</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that the evolutionary process will produce a virus</p>
<p>that will kill all humans?</p>
<p>I think it could.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely.</p>
<p>And the reason I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely</p>
<p>is on the one hand, it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet,</p>
<p>in part because mobility is a recent phenomena.</p>
<p>People weren&rsquo;t particularly mobile</p>
<p>until fairly recently.</p>
<p>Now, of course, now that we have people flying back</p>
<p>and forth across the globe all the time,</p>
<p>the chances of global pandemics</p>
<p>has escalated exponentially, of course.</p>
<p>And so on the one hand,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of why it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>We can look at things like Ebola.</p>
<p>Now, Ebola, we haven&rsquo;t generally had major Ebola epidemics</p>
<p>in the past, not because Ebola wasn&rsquo;t transmitting</p>
<p>and infecting humans, but because it was largely affecting</p>
<p>and infecting humans in disconnected communities.</p>
<p>So you see out in rural parts of Africa, for example,</p>
<p>in Western Africa, you might end up having</p>
<p>isolated Ebola outbreaks,</p>
<p>but there weren&rsquo;t connections that were fast enough</p>
<p>that would allow people to then spread it into the cities.</p>
<p>Of course, we saw back in 2014, 15 massive Ebola outbreak</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t because it was a new strain of Ebola,</p>
<p>but it was because there&rsquo;s new inroads and connections</p>
<p>between the communities and people got it to the city.</p>
<p>And so we saw it start to spread.</p>
<p>So that should be a little bit foreshadowing</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p>And now we have this pandemic.</p>
<p>We had 2009, we have this.</p>
<p>There is a benefit or there is sort of a natural check.</p>
<p>And this is like kind of like a Voltaire</p>
<p>predator prey dynamic kind of systems,</p>
<p>ecological systems and mathematics that</p>
<p>if you have something that&rsquo;s so deadly,</p>
<p>people will respond more maybe with a greater panic,</p>
<p>a greater sense of panic, which alone could, you know,</p>
<p>destroy humanity.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we now know that we can lock down.</p>
<p>We know that that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>And so if this was a worse virus</p>
<p>that was actually killing 60% of people as infecting,</p>
<p>we would lock down very quickly.</p>
<p>My biggest fear though, is let&rsquo;s say that was happening.</p>
<p>You need serious lockdowns if you&rsquo;re gonna keep things going.</p>
<p>So the only reason we were able to keep things going</p>
<p>during our lockdowns is because it wasn&rsquo;t so bad</p>
<p>that we were still able to have people work</p>
<p>in the grocery stores.</p>
<p>Still have people work in the shipping</p>
<p>to get the food onto the shelves.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, we could probably figure out</p>
<p>how to stop the virus,</p>
<p>but can we stop the virus without starving?</p>
<p>You know, and I&rsquo;m not sure that that,</p>
<p>if this was another acute respiratory virus</p>
<p>that say had a slightly, say it transmitted the same way,</p>
<p>but say it actually did worse damage to your heart,</p>
<p>but it was like a month later</p>
<p>that people started having heart attacks in mass.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like not just one offs, but really severe.</p>
<p>Well, that could be a serious problem for humanity.</p>
<p>So in some ways I think that there are lots of ways</p>
<p>that we could end up dying at the hand of a virus.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re already seeing it.</p>
<p>Just, I mean, my fear is still,</p>
<p>I think coronaviruses have demonstrated</p>
<p>a keen ability to destroy or to create outbreaks</p>
<p>that can potentially be deadly to large numbers of people.</p>
<p>Flu strains, though, are still by and large my concern.</p>
<p>So you think the bad one might come from the flu,</p>
<p>the influenza?</p>
<p>Yeah, their replication cycle,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to genetically recombine</p>
<p>in a way that coronaviruses aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They have segmented genomes,</p>
<p>which means that they can just swap out</p>
<p>whole parts of their genomes, no problem,</p>
<p>repackage them, and then boom,</p>
<p>you have a whole antigenic shift, not a drift.</p>
<p>What that means is that on any occasion,</p>
<p>any day of the year, you can have, boom,</p>
<p>a whole new virus that didn&rsquo;t exist yesterday.</p>
<p>And now with farming and industrial livestock,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing animals and humans come into contact much more.</p>
<p>Just the opportunities for an influenza strain</p>
<p>that is unique and deadly to humans increases.</p>
<p>All the while, transmission and mobility has increased.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a matter of time, in my opinion.</p>
<p>What about from immunology perspective</p>
<p>of the idea of engineering a virus?</p>
<p>So not just the virus leaking from a lab or something,</p>
<p>but actually being able to understand the protein,</p>
<p>like everything about what makes a virus enough</p>
<p>to be able to figure out ways to maybe target it</p>
<p>or untarget it, attack biologics.</p>
<p>Subverse immunity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that something, obviously that&rsquo;s somewhere</p>
<p>on the list of concerns, but is that anywhere close</p>
<p>of the top 10 highlights along with nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and so on that we should be worried about?</p>
<p>Or is the natural pandemic really the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much greater concern?</p>
<p>I would say that the former, that manmade viruses</p>
<p>and genetically engineered viruses should be right up there</p>
<p>with the greatest concerns for humanity right now.</p>
<p>We know that the tools, for better or worse,</p>
<p>the tools for creating a virus are there.</p>
<p>We can do it.</p>
<p>And I mean, heck, the human species</p>
<p>is no longer vaccinated against smallpox.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get a smallpox vaccine.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get a smallpox vaccine, at least I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>And so if somebody wanted to make smallpox</p>
<p>and distribute it to the world in some way,</p>
<p>it could be exceedingly deadly and detrimental to humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not even sort of using your imagination</p>
<p>to create a new virus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one that we already have.</p>
<p>Unlike the past when smallpox would circulate,</p>
<p>you had large fractions of the community</p>
<p>that was already immune to it.</p>
<p>And so it wouldn&rsquo;t spread</p>
<p>or it would spread a little bit slower.</p>
<p>But now we have essentially in a few years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have a whole global population that is susceptible.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at measles.</p>
<p>We have an entire, I mean, measles, I have,</p>
<p>there are some researchers in the world right now,</p>
<p>which for various reasons are working on creating</p>
<p>a measles strain that evades immunity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for bioterrorism,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s not the expectation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for using measles as an oncolytic virus to kill cancer.</p>
<p>And the only way you can really do that</p>
<p>is if your immune system doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you take a measles virus and there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to go into the details of why it would work,</p>
<p>but it could work.</p>
<p>Measles likes to target potentially cancer cells.</p>
<p>But to get your immune system not to kill off the virus</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to use the virus to target it,</p>
<p>you maybe want to make it blind to the immune system.</p>
<p>But now imagine we took some virus like measles,</p>
<p>which has an R naught of 18, transmits extremely quickly.</p>
<p>And now we have essentially,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we had a whole human race</p>
<p>that is susceptible to measles.</p>
<p>And this is a virus that spreads</p>
<p>orders of magnitude easier than this current virus.</p>
<p>Imagine if you were to plug something toxic</p>
<p>or detrimental into that virus and release it to the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible to be both accidental and intentional.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Mark Lipsitch is a good colleague of mine</p>
<p>at Harvard, we&rsquo;re both in the,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the director of the Center</p>
<p>for Communicable Disease Dynamics from a faculty member.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s spoken very, very forcefully</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s very outspoken about the dangers</p>
<p>of gain of function testing,</p>
<p>where in the lab we are intentionally creating viruses</p>
<p>that are exceedingly deadly</p>
<p>under the auspices of trying to learn about them.</p>
<p>So that if the idea is that if we kind of accelerate</p>
<p>evolution and make these really deadly viruses in the lab,</p>
<p>we can be prepared for if that virus ever comes about</p>
<p>naturally or through unnatural means.</p>
<p>The concern though is, okay, that&rsquo;s one thing,</p>
<p>but what if that virus got out on somebody&rsquo;s shoe?</p>
<p>Just what if?</p>
<p>If the effects of an accident are potentially catastrophic,</p>
<p>is it worth taking the chances just to be prepared</p>
<p>a little bit for something that may</p>
<p>or may not ever actually develop?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a serious ethical quandary we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>how to both be prepared,</p>
<p>but also not cause a catastrophic mistake.</p>
<p>As a small tangent,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a recent really exciting breakthrough of alpha two,</p>
<p>of alpha fold two solving protein folding</p>
<p>or achieving state of the art performance</p>
<p>on protein folding.</p>
<p>And then I thought proteins have a lot to do with viruses.</p>
<p>It seems like being able to use machine learning</p>
<p>to design proteins that achieve certain kinds of functions</p>
<p>will naturally allow you to use maybe down the line,</p>
<p>not yet, but allow you to use machine learning</p>
<p>to design basically viruses,</p>
<p>maybe like measles, like for good,</p>
<p>which is like to attack cancer cells, but also for bad.</p>
<p>Is that a crazy thought</p>
<p>or is this a natural place where this technology may go?</p>
<p>I suppose as all technologies can,</p>
<p>which is for good and for bad.</p>
<p>Do you think about the role of machine learning in this?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, absolutely, I mean, alpha fold is amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing algorithm, a series of algorithms.</p>
<p>And it does demonstrate, to me,</p>
<p>it demonstrates just how powerful,</p>
<p>everything in the world has rules.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t know the rules.</p>
<p>We often don&rsquo;t know them,</p>
<p>but our brain has rules, how it works.</p>
<p>Everything is plus and minus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in the world that&rsquo;s really not</p>
<p>at its most basic level, positive, negative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, obviously, it&rsquo;s all just charge.</p>
<p>And that means everything.</p>
<p>You can figure it out with enough computational power</p>
<p>and enough, in this case, I mean,</p>
<p>machine learning and AI is just one way to learn rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an empirical way to learn rules,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a profoundly powerful way.</p>
<p>And certainly, now that we are getting to a point</p>
<p>where we can take a protein and know how it folds,</p>
<p>given its sequence, we can reverse engineer that</p>
<p>and we can say, okay, we want a protein to fold this way.</p>
<p>What does the sequence need to be?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t done that yet so much,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the next iteration of all of this.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s say somebody wants to develop a virus</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna start with somebody wanting to develop a virus</p>
<p>to defeat cancer, something good.</p>
<p>And so it would start with a lot of money</p>
<p>from the federal government for all the positives</p>
<p>that will come out of it.</p>
<p>But we have to be really careful</p>
<p>because that will come about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that we will develop,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already doing it.</p>
<p>We engineer molecules all the time for specific uses.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, we take them from a lab</p>
<p>and then we take them from a lab and then we make them.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, we take them from nature and then tweak them.</p>
<p>But now we can supercharge it.</p>
<p>We can accelerate the pace of discovery.</p>
<p>To not have it just be discovery,</p>
<p>we have it be true ground up engineering.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re trying to make a new molecule</p>
<p>to stabilize somebody with some retinal disease.</p>
<p>So we come up with some molecule</p>
<p>to stability of somebody with retinal degeneration.</p>
<p>Just a small tweak to that,</p>
<p>to say make a virus that causes the human race</p>
<p>to become blind.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds really conspiracy theoryish,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re learning so much about biology</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s always nefarious reasons.</p>
<p>I mean, heck, look at how AI and just Google searches,</p>
<p>those can be, they are every single day</p>
<p>being leveraged by nefarious actors</p>
<p>to take advantage of people, to steal money,</p>
<p>to do whatever it might be.</p>
<p>Eventually, probably to create wars</p>
<p>or already to create wars.</p>
<p>And I mean, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any question at this point</p>
<p>behind disinformation campaigns.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s being leveraged.</p>
<p>This thing that could be wholly good</p>
<p>is always going to be leveraged for bad.</p>
<p>And so how do you balance that as a species?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure.</p>
<p>The hope is, as you mentioned previously,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some, that we were able</p>
<p>to also develop defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about the human species</p>
<p>that seems to keep coming up with ways to,</p>
<p>just like on the deadline,</p>
<p>just at the last moment,</p>
<p>figuring out how to avoid destruction.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m eternally optimistic about the human race</p>
<p>not destroying ourselves,</p>
<p>but you could do a lot of things</p>
<p>that would be very painful.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re doing it already, just,</p>
<p>I mean, we are seeing how our regulation today,</p>
<p>we did this thing, it started as a good thing,</p>
<p>regulation of medical products,</p>
<p>but now it is unwillingly and unintentionally harming us.</p>
<p>Our regulatory landscape,</p>
<p>which was developed totally for good in our country</p>
<p>is getting in the way of us deploying a tool</p>
<p>that could stop our economies</p>
<p>from having to be sort of sputteringly closed,</p>
<p>that could stop deaths from happening</p>
<p>at the rate that they are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I think we will come to a solution.</p>
<p>Of course, now we&rsquo;re gonna get the vaccine</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna make people lose track</p>
<p>of like why we even bother testing, which is a bad idea.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re already seeing that.</p>
<p>We have this amazing capacity to both do damage</p>
<p>when we don&rsquo;t intend to do damage</p>
<p>and then also to pull up when we need to pull up</p>
<p>and stop complete catastrophe.</p>
<p>And so we are an interesting species in that way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of young folks, undergrads,</p>
<p>grads, they&rsquo;re also young, listen to this.</p>
<p>So is there, you&rsquo;ve talked about a lot of fascinating stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s ways that things are done</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s actual solutions</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not always like intersecting.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for undergraduate students</p>
<p>or graduate students or even people in high school now</p>
<p>about a life, about a career of how they might be able</p>
<p>to solve real big problems in the world,</p>
<p>how they should live their life</p>
<p>in order to have a chance to solve big problems</p>
<p>in the world?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I struggle a little bit sometimes to give advice</p>
<p>because the advice that I give</p>
<p>from my own personal experience is necessarily distinct</p>
<p>from the advice that would make other people successful.</p>
<p>I have unending ambitions to make things better, I suppose.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see barricades</p>
<p>where other people sometimes see barricades.</p>
<p>Now, even just little things like when this virus started,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a medical director at Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital</p>
<p>and so I oversee or helped oversee</p>
<p>molecular virology diagnostics.</p>
<p>So when this virus started, wearing my epidemiology hat</p>
<p>and wearing my sort of viral outbreak hat,</p>
<p>I recognized that this is gonna be a big virus</p>
<p>that was important on a global level.</p>
<p>Even if the CDC and WHO weren&rsquo;t ready to admit</p>
<p>that it was a pandemic,</p>
<p>it was obvious in January that it was a pandemic.</p>
<p>So I started trying to get a test built at the Brigham,</p>
<p>which is one of Harvard&rsquo;s teaching hospitals.</p>
<p>The first encounters I had with the upper administration</p>
<p>of the hospital were pretty much, no, why would we do that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s silly, who are you?</p>
<p>And I said, well, okay, don&rsquo;t believe me, sure.</p>
<p>But I kept pushing on it.</p>
<p>And then eventually I got them to agree.</p>
<p>It was really only a couple of weeks</p>
<p>before the Biogen conference happened.</p>
<p>We started building the test.</p>
<p>I think they started looking abroad and saying,</p>
<p>okay, this is happening, sure, like, maybe he was right.</p>
<p>But then I went a step further and I said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna have enough tests at the hospital.</p>
<p>And so my ambition was to get a better testing program</p>
<p>started and so I figured what better place</p>
<p>to scale up testing than the Broad Institute.</p>
<p>Broad Institute is amazing, very high throughput,</p>
<p>high efficiency research institute</p>
<p>that does a lot of genomic sequencing, things like that.</p>
<p>So I went to the Broad and I said,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s this coronavirus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s obviously gonna impact our society greatly.</p>
<p>Can we start modifying your high efficiency instruments</p>
<p>and robots for coronavirus testing?</p>
<p>Everyone in my orbit, in the hospital world,</p>
<p>just said, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>How could you possibly plan to do that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>And to me, it was like the most dead simple thing to do.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t, but the higher ups and the people</p>
<p>who think about, I think one of the things</p>
<p>is to recognize that most people in the world</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see solutions, they just see problems.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>Thinking of problems and how things will go wrong</p>
<p>is really easy because you&rsquo;re not coming up</p>
<p>with a brand new solution.</p>
<p>And this to me was just a super simple solution.</p>
<p>Hey, let&rsquo;s get the Broad to help build tests.</p>
<p>Every single hospital director told me no,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>My own superiors, the ones I report to in the hospital,</p>
<p>said, you know, Mike, you&rsquo;re a new faculty member.</p>
<p>Your ideas probably would be right,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re too naive and young to know that it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>Obviously now the Broad is the highest</p>
<p>throughput laboratory in the country.</p>
<p>And so I think my recommendation to people</p>
<p>is as much as possible, get out of the mode</p>
<p>of thinking about things as problems.</p>
<p>Sometimes you piss people off,</p>
<p>I could probably use a better filter sometimes</p>
<p>to try to like be not so upfront with certain things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just so crucial to always just see,</p>
<p>to just bring it, like think about things in new ways</p>
<p>that other people haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Cause usually there&rsquo;s something else out there.</p>
<p>And one of the things that has been most beneficial to me,</p>
<p>which is that my education was really broad.</p>
<p>It was engineering and physics.</p>
<p>And well, and then I became a Buddhist monk.</p>
<p>Well, and then I became a Buddhist monk for a while.</p>
<p>And so that gave me a different perspective,</p>
<p>but then it was medicine and immunology.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;ve brought all of it together</p>
<p>from a mathematics and biology and medicine perspective</p>
<p>and policy and public health.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the best in any one of these things.</p>
<p>I recognize that there are gonna be geniuses out there</p>
<p>who are just worlds better than me</p>
<p>at any one of these things that I try to work on.</p>
<p>But my superpower is bringing them all together,</p>
<p>you know, and just thinking,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s, I think how you can really change the world.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll ever change the world</p>
<p>in the way that I hope.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how you can have a chance.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s how you can have a chance, exactly.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s also what, you know, this to me,</p>
<p>this rapid testing program,</p>
<p>like this is the most dead simple solution in the world.</p>
<p>And this literally could change the world.</p>
<p>It could change the world.</p>
<p>It could change, and it is, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s countries that are doing it now.</p>
<p>The US isn&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;ve been advising many countries on it.</p>
<p>And I would say that, you know,</p>
<p>some of the early papers that we put out earlier on,</p>
<p>a lot of the things actually are changing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t always, unless you really look hard,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re actually having an effect.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s more overt than other times.</p>
<p>In April, I published a paper that was saying,</p>
<p>hey, with the PCR values from these tests,</p>
<p>we need to really focus on the CT values,</p>
<p>the actual quantitative values</p>
<p>of these lab based PCR tests.</p>
<p>At the time, all the physicians and laboratory directors</p>
<p>told me that was stupid.</p>
<p>You know, why would you do that?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not accurate enough.</p>
<p>And of course, now it&rsquo;s headline news that, you know,</p>
<p>Florida, they just mandated reporting out the CT values</p>
<p>of these tests, cause there&rsquo;s a real utility of them.</p>
<p>You can understand public health from it.</p>
<p>You can understand better clinical management.</p>
<p>You know, that was a simple solution</p>
<p>to a pretty difficult problem.</p>
<p>And it is changing.</p>
<p>The way that we approach all of the lab testing</p>
<p>in this country is starting to, it&rsquo;s taken a few months,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s starting to change because of that.</p>
<p>And, you know, that was just me saying,</p>
<p>hey, this is something we should be focusing on.</p>
<p>Got some other people involved and other people.</p>
<p>And now people recognize, hey, there&rsquo;s actual value</p>
<p>in this number that comes out of these lab based PCR tests.</p>
<p>So sometimes it does grow fairly quickly.</p>
<p>But I think the real answer,</p>
<p>if my only answer, I don&rsquo;t know what, you know,</p>
<p>I recognize that everyone, some people are gonna be</p>
<p>really focused on and have one small, but deep skillset.</p>
<p>I go the opposite direction.</p>
<p>I try to bring things together.</p>
<p>And, but the biggest thing I think is just,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see barriers, like just see,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s always a solution to a barrier.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a barrier,</p>
<p>that literally means there&rsquo;s a solution to it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called a barrier.</p>
<p>And just like you said, most people will just present to you,</p>
<p>only be thinking about it and present to you with barriers.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s easy to start thinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all there is in this world.</p>
<p>And just think big.</p>
<p>I mean, God, you know, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong</p>
<p>with thinking big.</p>
<p>Elon Musk thought big and, you know,</p>
<p>and then thinking big builds on itself.</p>
<p>You know, you get a billion dollars from one big idea</p>
<p>and then that allows you to make three new big ideas.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a hunger for it if you think big</p>
<p>and you communicate that vision with the world.</p>
<p>All the most brilliant and like passionate people</p>
<p>will just like, you&rsquo;ll attract them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll come to you.</p>
<p>And then it makes your life actually really exciting.</p>
<p>The people I&rsquo;ve met at like Tesla and Neuralink,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s just like this fire in their eyes.</p>
<p>They just love life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing, I think, to be around those people.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about what was the philosophy,</p>
<p>the journey that took you to becoming a Buddhist monk</p>
<p>and what did you learn about life?</p>
<p>What did you take away from that experience?</p>
<p>How did you return back to Harvard</p>
<p>and the world that&rsquo;s unlike that experience, I imagine?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I was at Dartmouth at the time.</p>
<p>Well, I went to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>I was already pretty interested in developing countries</p>
<p>and sort of under resourced areas.</p>
<p>And I was doing a lot of engineering work</p>
<p>and I went there, but I was also starting to think</p>
<p>maybe health was something of interest.</p>
<p>And so I went to Sri Lanka</p>
<p>because I had a long interest in Buddhism as well,</p>
<p>just kind of interested in it as a thing.</p>
<p>Which aspect of the philosophy attracted you?</p>
<p>I would say that the thing that interested me most</p>
<p>was really this idea of kind of a butterfly effect</p>
<p>of like what you do now has ripple effects</p>
<p>that extend out beyond what you can possibly imagine,</p>
<p>both in your own life and in other people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>And in some ways, Buddhism has, not in some ways,</p>
<p>in a pretty deep way, Buddhism has that</p>
<p>as part of its underlying philosophy</p>
<p>in terms of rebirth and sort of your actions today</p>
<p>propagate to others, but also propagate</p>
<p>to sort of what might happen in your circle</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s called samsara and rebirth.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that I subscribe fully</p>
<p>to this idea that we are reborn,</p>
<p>which always was a little bit of a debate internally,</p>
<p>I suppose, when I was a monk.</p>
<p>But it has always been, it was that</p>
<p>and then it was also meditation.</p>
<p>At the time I was a fairly elite rower.</p>
<p>I was rowing at the national level</p>
<p>and rowing to me was very meditative.</p>
<p>It was just, even if you&rsquo;re in a boat with other people,</p>
<p>I mean, on the one hand, it&rsquo;s like the extreme</p>
<p>of like a team sport, but it&rsquo;s also the extreme</p>
<p>sort of focus and concentration that&rsquo;s required of it.</p>
<p>And so I was always really into just meditative</p>
<p>type of things.</p>
<p>I was doing a lot of pottery too,</p>
<p>which was also very meditative.</p>
<p>And so Buddhism just kind of really,</p>
<p>there are a lot of things about meditating</p>
<p>that just appealed.</p>
<p>And so I moved to Sri Lanka,</p>
<p>planning to only be there for a couple of months.</p>
<p>And then I was shadowing in this medical clinic</p>
<p>and there was this physician who was just really,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just kind of a horrible situation.</p>
<p>Frankly, this guy was trained decades earlier.</p>
<p>He was an older physician and he was still just practicing</p>
<p>like these fairly barbaric approaches to medicine</p>
<p>because he was a rural town</p>
<p>and he just didn&rsquo;t have a lot of,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t have any updated training, frankly.</p>
<p>And so, I just remember this like girl came in</p>
<p>with like shrapnel in her hand</p>
<p>and his solution was to like air it out.</p>
<p>And so he was like, without even numbing her hand,</p>
<p>he was like cutting it open more with this idea</p>
<p>that like the more oxygen and stuff.</p>
<p>And it just, I think there was something about all of this.</p>
<p>And I was already talking to these monks at the time.</p>
<p>I would be in this clinic in the morning and I&rsquo;d go</p>
<p>and my idea was to teach English</p>
<p>to these monks in the evening.</p>
<p>Turned out I&rsquo;m a really bad English teacher.</p>
<p>So they just taught, they allowed me just to sit with them</p>
<p>and meditate and they were teaching me more about Buddhism</p>
<p>than I could have possibly taught them about English</p>
<p>or being an American or something.</p>
<p>And so I just slowly, I just couldn&rsquo;t take,</p>
<p>I like couldn&rsquo;t handle being in that clinic.</p>
<p>So more and more, I just started moving to,</p>
<p>spending more and more time at this monastery.</p>
<p>And then after about two months,</p>
<p>I was supposed to come back to the States</p>
<p>and I decided I didn&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>So I moved to this monastery in the mountains</p>
<p>primarily because I didn&rsquo;t have the money</p>
<p>to like just keep living.</p>
<p>So living in a monastery is free.</p>
<p>And so I moved there and just started meditating</p>
<p>more and more and then months went by</p>
<p>and it just really gravitated.</p>
<p>I gravitated to the whole notion of it.</p>
<p>I mean, it became, it sounds strange,</p>
<p>but meditating almost just like anything</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve put your mind to became exciting.</p>
<p>It became like there weren&rsquo;t enough hours</p>
<p>in the day to meditate.</p>
<p>And I would do it for 18 hours a day, 15 hours a day,</p>
<p>just sit there and you, and like,</p>
<p>I mean, I hate sleeping anyway,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go to sleep</p>
<p>because I felt like I didn&rsquo;t accomplish</p>
<p>what I needed to accomplish in meditation that day,</p>
<p>which is so strange because there is no end,</p>
<p>but it was always, but there are these,</p>
<p>there are these steps that happen during meditation</p>
<p>that are very prescribed in a way.</p>
<p>Buddha talked about them and these are ancient writings,</p>
<p>which exist.</p>
<p>I mean, the writings are real.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thousands of years old now.</p>
<p>And so whether it was Buddha writing them or whoever,</p>
<p>there are lots of different people</p>
<p>who have contributed to these writings over the years.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re very prescribed</p>
<p>and they tell you what you&rsquo;re gonna go through.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t really focus too much on them.</p>
<p>I read a little bit about them,</p>
<p>but your mind really does.</p>
<p>When you actually start meditating at that level,</p>
<p>like not an hour here and there,</p>
<p>but like truly just spending your day as meditating,</p>
<p>it becomes kind of like this other world</p>
<p>where it becomes exciting and you&rsquo;re actively working,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actively meditating,</p>
<p>not just kind of trying to quiet things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of just the first stage</p>
<p>of trying to get your mind to focus.</p>
<p>Most people never get past that first stage,</p>
<p>especially in our culture.</p>
<p>Could you briefly summarize</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s waiting beyond the stage of just quieting the mind?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that could be described as exciting on there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>So I would say, so the first thing,</p>
<p>the first step is truly just to like be able</p>
<p>to close your eyes, focus on your breath</p>
<p>and not have other thoughts enter into your mind.</p>
<p>That alone is just so hard to do.</p>
<p>Like I couldn&rsquo;t do it now if I wanted, but I could then.</p>
<p>But once you get past that stage,</p>
<p>you start entering into like all these other,</p>
<p>you go through the kind of,</p>
<p>I went through this like pretty trippy stage,</p>
<p>which is a little bit euphoric</p>
<p>where you just kind of start not hallucinating.</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t like some crazy thing</p>
<p>that would happen in a movie,</p>
<p>but definitely just weird.</p>
<p>You start getting into the stage</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re able to quiet your mind for so long,</p>
<p>for hours at a time that like for me,</p>
<p>I started getting really excited</p>
<p>about this idea of mindfulness,</p>
<p>which is part of Buddhism in general,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s part of Theravada Buddhism in particular</p>
<p>for this in this way, which was you take,</p>
<p>you start focusing on your daily activities,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s sipping a cup of tea or walking</p>
<p>or sweeping around.</p>
<p>I lived on this mountainside in this cottage thing,</p>
<p>it was built into the rock.</p>
<p>And so every morning I would wake up early</p>
<p>and sweep around it and stuff,</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s just what we did.</p>
<p>And you start to, you meditate on all those activities.</p>
<p>And one of the things that was so exciting,</p>
<p>which sounds completely ridiculous now</p>
<p>was just almost learning about your daily activities</p>
<p>in ways that you never would have thought about before.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s involved with like picking up this glass of water?</p>
<p>If I said, okay, I&rsquo;m just gonna pick,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a drink of water,</p>
<p>to me right now, it&rsquo;s a single activity.</p>
<p>But during meditation, it&rsquo;s not a single activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole series of activities</p>
<p>of like little engineering feats and feelings.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gripping the water</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s feeling that the glass is cold</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s lifting and it&rsquo;s moving and dragging and dragging.</p>
<p>And you start to learn a whole new language of life.</p>
<p>And that to me was like this really exhilarating thing</p>
<p>that it was an exhilarating component of meditation</p>
<p>that there was never enough time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like learning a new computer language.</p>
<p>Like it gets really exciting when you start coding</p>
<p>and all these new things you can do.</p>
<p>You learn how to experience life in a much richer way.</p>
<p>And so you never run out of ways</p>
<p>to go deeper and deeper and deeper</p>
<p>in the way you experienced even just</p>
<p>the drinking of the glass of water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And what becomes kind of exhilarating</p>
<p>is you start to be able to predict things</p>
<p>that you never are,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even have predictions, right word.</p>
<p>But I always think of the matrix,</p>
<p>where I forget who it was,</p>
<p>somebody was shooting at Neo</p>
<p>and he like leans backwards and he dodges the bullets.</p>
<p>In some ways, when you start breaking</p>
<p>every little action that your hands do</p>
<p>or that your feet do or that your body does</p>
<p>down into all these little actions</p>
<p>that make up one what we normally think of as an action,</p>
<p>all of a sudden you can start to see things</p>
<p>almost in slow motion.</p>
<p>I like to think of it very much like language.</p>
<p>The first time somebody hears a foreign language,</p>
<p>it sounds really fast usually.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hear the spaces between words.</p>
<p>And it just sounds like a stream of consciousness.</p>
<p>And it just sounds like a stream of noises</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve never heard the language before.</p>
<p>And as you learn the language,</p>
<p>you hear clear breaks between words</p>
<p>and it starts to gain context.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden like that,</p>
<p>what once sounded very fast slows down and it has meaning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our whole life.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s this whole language happening</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t speak generally.</p>
<p>But if you start to speak it</p>
<p>and if you start to learn it and you start to say,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m picking up this glass</p>
<p>is actually 18 little movements.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden it becomes extremely exciting</p>
<p>and exhilarating to just breathe.</p>
<p>Breathing alone and the rise and fall of your abdomen</p>
<p>or the way the air pushes in and out of your nose</p>
<p>becomes almost interesting.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really neat is the world just starts slowing down</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll never forget that feeling.</p>
<p>And if there was one euphoric feeling from meditation</p>
<p>I want to gain back,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think I could without really meditating</p>
<p>like that again and I don&rsquo;t think I will,</p>
<p>was this like slow motion of the world.</p>
<p>It was finding the spaces between all the movements</p>
<p>in the same way that the spaces between all the words happen.</p>
<p>And then it almost gives you this new appreciation</p>
<p>for everything, it was really amazing.</p>
<p>And so I think it came to an abrupt end though</p>
<p>when the tsunami hit.</p>
<p>I was there in the Indian Ocean tsunami hit in 2004.</p>
<p>And it was like this dichotomy of being a monk</p>
<p>and just meditating in this extraordinary place.</p>
<p>And then the tsunami hits and kills 40,000 people</p>
<p>in a few minutes on the coast</p>
<p>of this really small little country in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>And then my whole world of being a monk</p>
<p>came crashing down.</p>
<p>And when I go to the coast,</p>
<p>and I mean, that was just a devastating visual sight</p>
<p>and emotional sight.</p>
<p>But the strangest thing happened,</p>
<p>which was that everyone just wanted me to stay as a monk.</p>
<p>You know, people in that culture, they wanted to,</p>
<p>the monks largely fled from the coastlines those,</p>
<p>you know, and so then there I was</p>
<p>and people wanted me to be a monk.</p>
<p>They wanted me to stay on the coast,</p>
<p>but be a monk and not help,</p>
<p>like not help in the way that I considered helping.</p>
<p>They wanted me just to keep meditating</p>
<p>so that they could bring me offerings</p>
<p>and have their sort of karmic responsibilities</p>
<p>attended to as well.</p>
<p>And so that was really bizarre to me.</p>
<p>It was like, how could I possibly just sit around</p>
<p>while all these people, half of everyone&rsquo;s family just died?</p>
<p>And so in any case, I stopped being a monk</p>
<p>and I moved to this refugee camp</p>
<p>and lived there for another six months or so</p>
<p>and just stayed there, not as a monk,</p>
<p>but tried to raise some money from the US</p>
<p>and tried to like, I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing.</p>
<p>Frankly, I was 22.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I appreciated at the time</p>
<p>how much of a role I was having in that community&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s taken me many years to process all of this</p>
<p>since then, but I would say it&rsquo;s what put me</p>
<p>into the public health world, living in that refugee camp.</p>
<p>And that difference that happened,</p>
<p>from being a monk to being in this devastating environment</p>
<p>just really changed my whole view</p>
<p>of sort of why I was existing, I suppose.</p>
<p>Well, so there&rsquo;s this richness of life</p>
<p>in a single drink of water that you experience,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s this power of nature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s capable to take the lives of thousands of people.</p>
<p>So given all that, the absurdity of that,</p>
<p>let me ask you, and the fact that you study things</p>
<p>that could kill the entirety of human civilization,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of this all?</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life,</p>
<p>this whole orchestra we&rsquo;ve got going on?</p>
<p>Does it have a meaning?</p>
<p>And maybe from another perspective,</p>
<p>how does one live a meaningful life, if such is possible?</p>
<p>Well, from what I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single answer to that by any stretch.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things about Buddhism to me</p>
<p>is that the human existence is part of suffering,</p>
<p>which is very different from Judeo Christian existence,</p>
<p>which is that human existence is something to be,</p>
<p>is a very different, it&rsquo;s something to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a richness to it.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, it&rsquo;s just another one of your lives,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s your opportunity to attain nirvana</p>
<p>and become a monk, for example, and meditate</p>
<p>to attain nirvana,</p>
<p>else you kind of just go back into the samsara,</p>
<p>the cycle of suffering.</p>
<p>And so, when I look at, I mean, in some ways,</p>
<p>the notion of life and what the purpose of life is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of completely distinct,</p>
<p>this sort of Western view of life,</p>
<p>which is that this life is the most precious thing</p>
<p>in the world versus this is just another opportunity</p>
<p>to try to get out of life.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole notion of nirvana, and in Buddhism,</p>
<p>it getting out of this sort of cycle of suffering</p>
<p>is to vanish.</p>
<p>If you could attain nirvana throughout this life,</p>
<p>the idea is that you don&rsquo;t get reborn.</p>
<p>And so, when I look at these two,</p>
<p>on the one hand, you have Christian faith</p>
<p>and other things that want to go to heaven</p>
<p>and live forever in heaven.</p>
<p>Then you have this other whole half of humans</p>
<p>who want nothing more than to get out of the cycle</p>
<p>of rebirth and just, poof, not exist anymore.</p>
<p>The cycle of suffering, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so how do you reconcile those two?</p>
<p>And I guess.</p>
<p>Do you have both of them in you?</p>
<p>Do you basically oscillate back and forth?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I, I think I just,</p>
<p>I look at us and I think we&rsquo;re just a bunch of proteins.</p>
<p>That we form and we, they work in this really amazing way</p>
<p>and they might work in a bigger scale.</p>
<p>There might be some connections</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not really clear about,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re still biological.</p>
<p>I believe that they&rsquo;re biological.</p>
<p>How did these proteins become conscious</p>
<p>and why do they want to help civilization</p>
<p>by having at home rapid tests at scale?</p>
<p>Well, I think, I don&rsquo;t have an answer to that one,</p>
<p>but I really do believe. I was hoping you would.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, this is just an evolution</p>
<p>of consciousness I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t personally think is,</p>
<p>my feeling is that we&rsquo;re a bunch of pluses and minuses</p>
<p>that have just gotten so complex</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re able to make rich feelings, rich emotions.</p>
<p>And I do believe though, you know, on the one hand,</p>
<p>I sometimes wake up some days,</p>
<p>my fiance doesn&rsquo;t always love it,</p>
<p>but you know, I kind of think we&rsquo;re all just a bunch</p>
<p>of robots with like pretty complicated algorithms</p>
<p>that we deal with.</p>
<p>And, you know, in that sense, like, okay,</p>
<p>if the world just blew up tomorrow</p>
<p>and nothing existed the day after that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just another blip in the universe, you know?</p>
<p>But at the same time, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of probably my most core basic feeling</p>
<p>about life is like, we&rsquo;re just a blip</p>
<p>and we may as well make the most of it</p>
<p>while we&rsquo;re here blipping.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one hell of a fun blip though.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s an amazing blink of an eye in time.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Teddy Roosevelt.</p>
<p>It is not the critic who counts.</p>
<p>Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles</p>
<p>or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.</p>
<p>The credit belongs to the man who actually is in the arena,</p>
<p>whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,</p>
<p>who strives valiantly, who errs,</p>
<p>who comes short again and again,</p>
<p>because there is no effort without error and shortcoming,</p>
<p>but who does actually strive to do the deeds,</p>
<p>who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions,</p>
<p>who spends himself in a worthy cause,</p>
<p>who at the best knows in the end that triumph</p>
<p>of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails,</p>
<p>at least fails while daring greatly,</p>
<p>so that his place shall never be</p>
<p>with those cold and timid souls</p>
<p>who neither know victory nor defeat.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
