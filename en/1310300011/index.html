<p>On the podcast today, I interview Pete Smithson from Aussie English.</p>
<p>Pete will give you three tips to get your resume ready for the business world in Australia,</p>
<p>plus a bonus tip about key spelling differences between Australia and the U.S. that you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>want to know.</p>
<p>So listen in today.</p>
<p>Hello Pete, welcome to All Ears English.</p>
<p>How are you today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>How are you going, Lindsay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fantastic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to have you back on the show.</p>
<p>Guys, on the show today we have Pete Smithson back on the show again for the third time.</p>
<p>Pete is the creator of Aussie English and he is the host of the Aussie English podcast</p>
<p>and the Aussie English YouTube channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a good time when you&rsquo;re on the show, Pete.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s everything going today?</p>
<p>Yeah, good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s summer at the moment, although we&rsquo;re in the middle of, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys</p>
<p>experienced La Nina and El Nino over in America.</p>
<p>Do you guys have that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in La Nina, which is a huge weather cycle period for multiple years where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>way too much rain.</p>
<p>So at the moment it&rsquo;s kind of not too hot, but it&rsquo;s just raining constantly despite being</p>
<p>in December, obviously.</p>
<p>And for us in the Southern Hemisphere, that&rsquo;s when we have our summers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your summer.</p>
<p>What a weird time.</p>
<p>Summer Christmas.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And Christmas is coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a strange combination of events, right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re used to it.</p>
<p>I was just down in the Southern Hemisphere last month and I just love the amount of light</p>
<p>that there is at this time of year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just incredible, you know.</p>
<p>But anyway, side point.</p>
<p>So today, Pete, we are getting into resumes, right, submitting your resume, especially</p>
<p>in Australia versus the US.</p>
<p>So Pete, in your world, before you became a creator, what did you do?</p>
<p>Did you apply for a lot of jobs in the 9-to-5 world or what track were you on before?</p>
<p>So yeah, sort of, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a point of pride or a point of embarrassment, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a full-time job because I was always studying at university.</p>
<p>I did my bachelor&rsquo;s, master&rsquo;s and PhD there in biology and then always sort of had part-time</p>
<p>jobs whilst doing that.</p>
<p>And then after that finish, I ended up the podcast host and content creator online.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been my quote, full-time job ever since.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I did still have to do resumes, but I probably didn&rsquo;t ever put in anywhere</p>
<p>near the sort of effort that would be required and quality control and everything like that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re applying for a very professional full-time job, but still had to do it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, there are some differences between, I think, other countries and how they would</p>
<p>do things, including America and what we would do here in Australia.</p>
<p>Big things, the cover letter and then just being sort of succinct with your past history</p>
<p>and everything and not going, you know, not handing in a 10-page document because no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to read it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to get into today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to highlight specifically, you know, applying for jobs in Australia.</p>
<p>You know, how might it be a little bit different?</p>
<p>But first I want to ask you, Pete, how did you go from biology to teaching English online</p>
<p>and being a podcaster?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super curious about that.</p>
<p>How did that switch happen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a long story, but I&rsquo;ll try and give you the long and the short of it.</p>
<p>So, when I was at high school, I was doing Mandarin Chinese and then French at high school.</p>
<p>And so, I ended up dropping Mandarin Chinese because there was way too much competition</p>
<p>in terms of immigrants, immigrant children who spoke it fluently and would do that subject</p>
<p>to be able to dominate it at year 12.</p>
<p>So, I ditched it, did French, didn&rsquo;t do French after that for like 10 years and lost it all</p>
<p>overall.</p>
<p>But then when I was doing my PhD, I started getting into fitness and doing a bit of martial</p>
<p>arts, so BJJ and mixed martial arts in Melbourne.</p>
<p>And I started meeting just loads and loads of foreigners who spoke different languages</p>
<p>and would just be surrounded by Turkish and French and Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish</p>
<p>and Chinese and, you know, loads of different languages and started to feel a bit embarrassed</p>
<p>that I only had English.</p>
<p>So, I started working my butt off with French and was listening to a podcast called Francais</p>
<p>Authentique, Authentic French.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you know Johan, but he was great.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d had a bit of experience with podcasting during my science degrees, just</p>
<p>as sort of appearing as a, you know, quote unquote, scientist on these podcasts to talk</p>
<p>about things.</p>
<p>And when I would go to the gym and chat with my friends who were French, I would say, you</p>
<p>know, I&rsquo;d be speaking in French with them and they would be like, you&rsquo;ve been improving</p>
<p>really quickly.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the secret?</p>
<p>I have trouble with English and Australian English is a nightmare.</p>
<p>And so, I was like, I&rsquo;m using podcasts, so I get loads and loads of listening comprehension</p>
<p>every single day when I&rsquo;m walking or commuting or in the lab doing work.</p>
<p>I can just listen to, you know, four hours of podcasts in a day.</p>
<p>It adds up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they were like, are there any for Australian English?</p>
<p>And I had a look and was like, no, there&rsquo;s bugger all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s none.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I decided to take it upon myself, I think probably 2015, the end of 2015 is when I started</p>
<p>and I finished my PhD in 2017, at the end of 2017.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s about two years as it was growing and by the end there, it was just starting</p>
<p>to get me an income.</p>
<p>And I was like, this looks like it could become a full-time job and I much prefer this helping</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>It was much more fulfilling than doing, you know, pipetting in a lab, you know, by myself</p>
<p>doing genetic work.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So, that was effectively the story and never looked back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the origin story.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it cool when you get to kind of fill sort of a gap in the universe, whether there</p>
<p>is something doesn&rsquo;t exist, right?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that a podcast for Australian English did not exist in the world and you</p>
<p>were able to fill that.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Guys, before we get into today&rsquo;s tips from Pete, I want to make sure our listeners know</p>
<p>where to go and check out your other episodes on All Ears English.</p>
<p>So, guys, Pete was on for episode 1805, where he gave us three tips for life in Australia.</p>
<p>We talked a little bit about the lifestyle there.</p>
<p>And then he was on 1366.</p>
<p>That must have been around 2020.</p>
<p>We talked about Aussie English slang.</p>
<p>So, guys, check out those episodes and then come right back here to this episode because</p>
<p>now, Pete, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<p>Tell me a little bit about your tips on how to submit a resume in or how to submit kind</p>
<p>of a job application in Australia.</p>
<p>What do we have to know that could be a little bit different from in the US or the rest of</p>
<p>the world?</p>
<p>What would be your first tip?</p>
<p>Well, one of the big things I used to notice when I was working in a restaurant and there</p>
<p>would be people coming in and handing in their resumes, quite a lot of the time they would</p>
<p>be from overseas and they would always have like a photo on the front of their resume</p>
<p>of themselves.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something where I was just like, you don&rsquo;t need to do that.</p>
<p>Like, and, you know, it sort of felt weird that you put that there expecting that we</p>
<p>would want to see you as a photo as opposed to just in the interview or when you came</p>
<p>in or something.</p>
<p>But the other thing was it takes up so much space on the front.</p>
<p>And so, I would be like, you&rsquo;re wasting important real estate on the front page where you could</p>
<p>be writing your cover letter, the succinct cover letter.</p>
<p>And so, my first tip here is include a succinct cover letter that&rsquo;s usually just the front</p>
<p>page and you are displaying why you have the experience and knowledge and would be a perfect</p>
<p>fit for the job effectively.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so, a big thing here too, I&rsquo;ve noticed that a lot of people will create like a sort</p>
<p>of, what would you say, a cover letter that kind of fits all and as a result, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really fit.</p>
<p>Generic.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the word I was looking for.</p>
<p>Generic cover letter.</p>
<p>And that is sort of a big no-no unless you are just trying to throw out as many resumes</p>
<p>as possible, like going fishing and hope that something jumps on the line.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, the advice that I&rsquo;ve always had, especially from my parents who were working at universities</p>
<p>in the education department and doing a lot of hiring, they would always be like, read</p>
<p>your job application, read it clearly, work out how you are the best person for this job.</p>
<p>You know, even if you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case, play it up as if you are and specifically</p>
<p>tackle points related to that job to show, to display that you have read and understood</p>
<p>what the job is and what they require.</p>
<p>And you are quickly and succinctly displaying why you are a good catch, why you&rsquo;re a good</p>
<p>person to hire, because for the most part, and my dad was always saying this, he&rsquo;d get</p>
<p>like a hundred applicants for a job and he&rsquo;d be like, I&rsquo;m only reading the first few lines</p>
<p>of the cover letter unless it&rsquo;s a good one and then I&rsquo;ll read the whole thing.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t have time to read every single resume.</p>
<p>And so, you have to do a good job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that first impression, right?</p>
<p>So, do a good job with your cover letter, make it succinct, you know, probably review</p>
<p>that more than the rest of your resume, because that&rsquo;s that sort of&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Tinder dates, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a blind date where you&rsquo;re meeting someone, you want to show up as best as you</p>
<p>can, you know, in nice clothing, maybe with makeup on or, you know, not just fresh out</p>
<p>of the gym smelling horrible.</p>
<p>You want to put your best face forward, right?</p>
<p>So, yeah, do your best with the cover letter.</p>

<p>Fresh for everyone.</p>
<p>But what do you think?</p>
<p>Is it like that in the US?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I love that you have that insider perspective, you know, watching your parents or your dad</p>
<p>kind of look at those letters and toss ones out just based on how he saw that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s similar in the US.</p>
<p>You do need to present a cover letter.</p>
<p>I have one question for you in Australia, and I&rsquo;ve never quite known how to do this</p>
<p>in the US either because I&rsquo;m in a similar boat.</p>
<p>I kind of bypassed the entire nine to five world too.</p>
<p>I never did it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I completely bypassed it and I will never go to it.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s how my life has gone.</p>
<p>But do you copy and paste your cover letter as well as attaching it as a PDF or do you</p>
<p>just copy and paste it into the email with no attachment involved?</p>
<p>Like what is the right etiquette to go about that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I know really.</p>
<p>Like if there is a specific etiquette to it, I&rsquo;d probably make sure that it&rsquo;s always attached</p>
<p>to the front of the resume document so that they don&rsquo;t miss it.</p>
<p>Because they can always, if you&rsquo;ve copy and pasted it into the email or you&rsquo;ve attached</p>
<p>it as a separate document, I reckon it could potentially get lost.</p>
<p>You know, they may miss it.</p>
<p>They may just forward that one file of your resume.</p>
<p>And again, if someone picks it up and there&rsquo;s no cover letter on it, they may just be like,</p>
<p>well, this person&rsquo;s lazy and just forgot it.</p>
<p>So, into the no pile.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d probably err on the side of repeating it, having it in too many places as opposed</p>
<p>to too few.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Just in case.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I was thinking too, but I was never sure about that when I was applying</p>
<p>for jobs.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s good to know now.</p>
<p>And I completely agree with you with not putting the photo because, you know, we should be</p>
<p>judged based on our experience, not our photo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very irrelevant and weird to see that on a resume.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re applying in Australia or the US, guys, don&rsquo;t put your photo on the resume.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So, Pete, what would be that second tip?</p>
<p>So, when writing the resume, a big one, I think, is for people who speak English as</p>
<p>a second language, it would be focusing on the formal kind of grammar.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably a pretty&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a nice balance that you need here with standard English and maybe a little</p>
<p>bit of formality, but not over the top.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I would probably get away with being a little over the top with formality when writing it,</p>
<p>because if I read it and it does sound a bit unnatural because it&rsquo;s so formal, I&rsquo;m still</p>
<p>going to think they&rsquo;ve done that because they&rsquo;re working really hard at producing a good document,</p>
<p>right, whether or not they&rsquo;re a native speaker.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I would say avoid informal language and focus on good grammar and formal language</p>
<p>and formal grammar.</p>
<p>You can use tools like Grammarly to kind of check it.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t used it recently, but I would imagine they probably have settings on their</p>
<p>for resumes.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would imagine they&rsquo;d have like a business English kind of setting to go through and</p>
<p>check because the grammar can be different.</p>
<p>The wording can be different that you would use.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to that, obviously, you can have people proofread it who are,</p>
<p>you know, native speakers or not, people who have experience applying for jobs and writing</p>
<p>resumes or reading resumes.</p>
<p>And then obviously getting on Google and just finding example resumes, you know, asking</p>
<p>friends and family if they have example ones in English that you can read and just taking</p>
<p>structures, grammatical structures or sentences that make sense to put into your own resume.</p>
<p>Obviously, don&rsquo;t plagiarise it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ve got all this experience that isn&rsquo;t mine, but take those structures</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve used and rewrite it into your own.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also going to be sort of working on your English simultaneously.</p>
<p>So, I think that&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unfortunate, but I think it is really, really important to nail the English in your</p>
<p>resume, because again, if I, whether consciously or subconsciously, if I were hiring someone</p>
<p>and I read the resume and the English had mistakes, if I didn&rsquo;t think that they were</p>
<p>learning English, I would probably think that they are potentially not intelligent enough</p>
<p>to have the job right.</p>
<p>Like if I thought they were Australian and they had horrible English, I&rsquo;d be like, well,</p>
<p>this, you know, I&rsquo;m going to have that conscious or subconscious bias.</p>
<p>But otherwise, if I think they&rsquo;re learning English, I may have the bias of like, oh,</p>
<p>well, is the English going to be good enough?</p>
<p>I might be nervous.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to find a native speaker or not.</p>
<p>So, I think that&rsquo;s, for better or worse, whether or not that&rsquo;s okay, a big thing is going to</p>
<p>be just nailing your English in the resume.</p>
<p>So, get as many people to look at it as possible.</p>
<p>Check it, use Grammarly, get on your Word document and use Spellcheck, everything like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>So, this is the time to really button up our English on our resume, on our cover letter,</p>
<p>right, Pete?</p>
<p>Because, you know, it&rsquo;s meant to get us the interview.</p>
<p>And once we get into the interview, we&rsquo;ll have a little bit more leeway because the</p>
<p>person will know our experience, but definitely button up your English for the resume.</p>
<p>And by the way, yeah, Grammarly should have something for resumes.</p>
<p>I use Grammarly sometimes too.</p>
<p>And it even works on my Canva slides.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s like a plugin, is it, for your&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in your browser.</p>
<p>For your browser.</p>
<p>And it just shows up on pretty much everything I do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for native speakers, non-native, anyone, anyone and everyone who just wants</p>
<p>a grammar check, wants to see if there&rsquo;s another word we could put in, and we can learn a lot</p>
<p>from it.</p>
<p>So, guys, I like that recommendation.</p>
<p>But overall, I like the idea, just get a little bit more formal when it comes to the resume</p>
<p>and cover letter.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Pete, what&rsquo;s number three?</p>
<p>So, I think focusing on that succinctness throughout the entire resume, a lot of times</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;ve read resumes, and even when I&rsquo;ve written my own, you have this feeling of I</p>
<p>need to include everything.</p>
<p>I need to give everyone every bit of possible information for them to use.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve got to remember, they&rsquo;re not going to be reading the majority of it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your foot in the door, and they&rsquo;re just seeing whether or not they can be bothered</p>
<p>interviewing you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s that importance on cover letter first, and then the writing inside</p>
<p>the resume, but then keeping it succinct, avoiding waffling on about things that aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>important and including information that may not be relevant.</p>
<p>So, I would say, obviously, include, say, your most recent job experience and everything</p>
<p>like that for the last couple of years.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t have to go back to high school, unless you&rsquo;re straight out of high school.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And also, obviously, including the stuff that is directly relevant to the job.</p>
<p>You know, so if you&rsquo;ve worked in McDonald&rsquo;s, but you&rsquo;re applying to be an engineer and</p>
<p>you have all this other experience, there&rsquo;s probably no point in including the fact that</p>
<p>you worked at McDonald&rsquo;s, so that&rsquo;s not going to do you any favours or any</p>
<p>negative experiences there either.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I would probably say keep it succinct, focus on that.</p>
<p>And as you said, just focus on the fact that the resume is your foot in the door.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just getting you the interview and the interview is where you get to shine.</p>
<p>And the good thing about the interview is whether or not the interviewee or the interviewers</p>
<p>know, a lot of what&rsquo;s going to matter there is their connection with you as a person.</p>
<p>Like the experience and everything is sort of the box ticking side of things.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s the point where they&rsquo;re really trying to vet, are you</p>
<p>legit with your experience and can you communicate clearly and everything?</p>
<p>But then probably most importantly, do they like you?</p>
<p>Do they think you&rsquo;re going to be a good fit for the team?</p>
<p>Are you going to be able to work with someone?</p>
<p>My wife was telling me this story the other day where her boss sat her down and was</p>
<p>like, you actually had less experience than someone else who came in for the job that you</p>
<p>applied for and got.</p>
<p>But the woman who was the boss of her boss, who was on the interview panel,</p>
<p>pretty much just said, nah, screw the other person.</p>
<p>You clearly get along with my wife really, really well, you know, with Kel.</p>
<p>So, she&rsquo;s your human.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll get the experience, but you guys obviously are going to click way more and be a better</p>
<p>fit for a team than this other person who had more experience, but you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily jive with on the same level.</p>
<p>And so, even if you don&rsquo;t necessarily have the experience that other people do, you may</p>
<p>just be a more personable person who fits into that role better, gets along with the</p>
<p>people, has a good rapport.</p>
<p>And the interview is where you get to show that, right?</p>
<p>So, yeah. Right, right.</p>
<p>So, we want to get to that interview.</p>
<p>So, keep it simple.</p>
<p>I love it. And I love that you use the word for our listeners, waffle on.</p>
<p>That is a great bonus that I just want to highlight for our listeners if that&rsquo;s new, which it</p>
<p>might be. We use that in the States, too.</p>
<p>What does it mean, Pete? Just real quick.</p>
<p>It would be like talking incessantly, right?</p>
<p>Talking on and on about nothing important.</p>
<p>So, what I&rsquo;ve done for a lot of these points, I could have probably kept them more</p>
<p>succinct, but I tended to waffle on a bit more than I probably should have.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll have to look into the origin, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;d usually see the word waffle.</p>
<p>And I think this would be American, right?</p>
<p>This is that sort of grid shaped dessert that you would make out of flour and water and</p>
<p>like a pancake that you put in a press.</p>
<p>True. And in the States, it&rsquo;s actually it&rsquo;s a dessert.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a breakfast, believe it or not, but we like sweet things.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, go figure. I love it.</p>
<p>OK, so the point is here, guys, keep it simple, keep it succinct, get yourself into that</p>
<p>interview so then you can connect like your wife did, right?</p>
<p>She got the job because they liked her more often.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it comes down to, is will you get along with your co-workers?</p>
<p>Will you fit in in this office environment?</p>
<p>So good. So let&rsquo;s get to the part I&rsquo;m most excited about here, Pete, with this</p>
<p>interview is spelling.</p>
<p>Tell us about when we are submitting a resume or a cover letter in Australia versus</p>
<p>maybe the US. What do we have to be careful of when it comes to spelling differences?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s probably not the end of the world, right?</p>
<p>Like it won&rsquo;t matter too much if you use American spelling.</p>
<p>And to be fair, I think a lot of Australians probably insert words from time to time</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re using the American spelling without even knowing it.</p>
<p>But I think just to avoid showing people that you are</p>
<p>a foreigner or that you have foreign English or that you&rsquo;re, you know, and I don&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>that in like a negative kind of way, but it is in this sort of a case where you are applying</p>
<p>for a job and it is kind of blind and they&rsquo;re reading the letter and that&rsquo;s all they have to go</p>
<p>off, I would be trying to stick in the crowd, the local crowd as much as possible.</p>
<p>So, if I were going to America, I would be avoiding using Australian English, Australian</p>
<p>slang, everything like that in the cover letter, because I would just be like, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to be reading this and be thinking or being pulled out</p>
<p>of the moment where they&rsquo;re meant to be just getting that information.</p>
<p>Right. So, a big thing would be using Australian spelling, which is just the same as</p>
<p>British English spelling. Right.</p>
<p>We got it from them. You guys are the ones that changed it, I think, in the 1800s.</p>
<p>Yeah. You sort of half standardised it.</p>
<p>Right. And so, some of it made sense with removing superfluous vowels or changing</p>
<p>consonants that didn&rsquo;t make much sense in those places.</p>
<p>But, yeah, I would say make sure that you&rsquo;re using Australian or British</p>
<p>spelling. And again, you can probably use settings in your Google Docs or Word or</p>
<p>Grammarly or whatever to just change the language when doing it.</p>
<p>And, you know, you could probably just write your resume in American English, whatever</p>
<p>English you use, and then just do a spell check when you change it over to</p>
<p>Australian, British English, and then just go through and adjust all those words.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re mostly going to be nouns, really, I think.</p>
<p>So. So, that&rsquo;s why we have to use our tools, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shame in having a tool like Grammarly, having a spell check, having a human</p>
<p>being look at it for that spelling.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about some examples.</p>
<p>So, for example, double consonants.</p>
<p>Tell me about that in the US versus Australia.</p>
<p>What are we talking about here?</p>
<p>Well, this is one of those things that really confuses me, because I would have thought</p>
<p>that the US would remove the superfluous double consonant, whereas it seems you guys</p>
<p>have kept the double, say, L&rsquo;s, right, in words like enroll or fulfil.</p>
<p>At the end of those words, you&rsquo;ve got two L&rsquo;s, whereas in British English or Australian</p>
<p>English, we have one. And so, yeah, you&rsquo;ll quite often see that.</p>
<p>And even I get confused with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be writing and I&rsquo;ll be like, is it one L, is it two L&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Right. And I&rsquo;ll have it on my website sometimes, you know, where I&rsquo;ve used two L&rsquo;s instead</p>
<p>of one. And I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s Australian English and I don&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Right. And then it can get frustrating.</p>
<p>And why do we have that extra L?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point, Pete. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need it. It doesn&rsquo;t serve any purpose.</p>
<p>Right. So, I think it would potentially, the argument could be made that if you have those</p>
<p>double consonants after a vowel, it changes the vowel compared to- It makes it a short</p>
<p>vowel, right, instead of a diphthong or a longer vowel.</p>
<p>So, if I had- If you just had fulfilling and it was spelt with one L, it can</p>
<p>look like it&rsquo;s for filing, right, or in enrolling instead of</p>
<p>enrolling, you know.</p>
<p>So, that argument could be made, but I think for the most part, it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>confusing. So, it&rsquo;s probably a bad example in terms of how it made a</p>
<p>difference. Yeah.</p>
<p>So, words like, again, like enroll, fulfill, I&rsquo;m sure there are a</p>
<p>bunch of other ones, but guys, that gives you a sense.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s the first one, double consonants.</p>
<p>And what else? Do we have an E, an ence, ending in ence, for example,</p>
<p>defence, offence, defence, offence?</p>
<p>Tell us about that. Yeah, well, and you&rsquo;ve just said them with American pronunciation,</p>
<p>right? And I find these two words really interesting.</p>
<p>So, defence and offence, we would spell with British or American, British or Australian</p>
<p>English with a C-E at the end, whereas you guys changed it to an</p>
<p>S-E, which it seems to make sense, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, you know, synonymous with the letter S.</p>
<p>Yeah. But the interesting thing is how you guys changed the emphasis and I</p>
<p>think even the vowel pronunciation, right?</p>
<p>So, you would say defence and offence.</p>
<p>And when I hear that as an Australian, I&rsquo;m thinking you&rsquo;re talking about sports</p>
<p>immediately. I&rsquo;m thinking the defence of a basketball team or the</p>
<p>offence, instead of saying defence and offence.</p>
<p>And if you were to say defence and offence, offence, I feel as you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>offended someone, like you&rsquo;ve said something and oh, they&rsquo;ve taken offence.</p>
<p>And defend is like to defend with your life, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to protect something.</p>
<p>So, do you guys pronounce those all exactly the same way or do you have a difference?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little tricky now that I&rsquo;m thinking about it.</p>
<p>So, if I say something like in my defence or a defence lawyer,</p>
<p>I would say defence.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re talking about sports, the defence, the offence, play defence,</p>
<p>play offence. So, it just depends on what we&rsquo;re trying to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing. Yeah. So, it is you guys as well, because, yeah, I always hear it.</p>
<p>And I would probably just use defence in both situations.</p>
<p>OK, interesting. But because I&rsquo;m so used to hearing American English, I might start</p>
<p>saying defence and offence for sports.</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s a common one. And then vowels, things like the O-U, you guys changed</p>
<p>into just O, right? So, colour and flavour and behaviour, those sorts of words,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve changed it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big one. They&rsquo;re the kind of words that come up more frequently.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ll see those and be like, if they&rsquo;ve written colour and they only have O-R, I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>like, American English, Americans, American English.</p>
<p>When I see the way you guys spell it, it feels like it should say flavour, right?</p>
<p>Or colour. It&rsquo;s strange to me, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, and you pronounce the R at the end, right, which is cool.</p>
<p>Whereas we would just say colour.</p>
<p>Right. Which I think is cool.</p>
<p>So, it works out both ways.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, we always think the accents that we don&rsquo;t have sound cool, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved the Aussie accent, to be honest, more than the British accent, but we</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t tell anyone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to take that clip out and then put that as one of, you know, the lines on</p>
<p>one of my website pages.</p>
<p>The last little thing I wanted to mention, sorry to interrupt you, was the dates, right?</p>
<p>And this is one of those biggest things that causes a lot of confusion between, I think,</p>
<p>just Americans and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Yeah. You guys put the month first and then the day and then the year, whereas we do</p>
<p>day, month, year.</p>
<p>Yeah. And so, for the most part, it&rsquo;s confusing.</p>
<p>Although I think if you were to, if you see that there are numbers above 12 in the middle</p>
<p>bit, you know, you know that it&rsquo;s not a month, right?</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re like, okay, they&rsquo;re using the American system.</p>
<p>But obviously, if you&rsquo;re applying for a job anywhere that isn&rsquo;t America, you want to be, I</p>
<p>assume, you want to be using day, month, year.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it could lead to a bit of confusion there and vice versa.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re applying for a job in the US, you want to switch it.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, always do it based on where you&rsquo;re trying to apply.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why we do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why the rest, I mean, the rest of the world, I don&rsquo;t know why we have to do it</p>
<p>differently than the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very weird. And to be honest&hellip;</p>
<p>I feel like it was an accountant that just decided, I want to order things from 1 to 12 for</p>
<p>months for the financial, like tax return stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all their fault, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll have to come after that person.</p>
<p>But anyways, good stuff.</p>
<p>This has been fantastic, Pete.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s really important to know how to essentially localize our resume and our</p>
<p>application so that the point is getting in the door for that interview, where then we</p>
<p>can fall back on connection, not perfection, and building that connection and that</p>
<p>relationship. Pete, this is awesome.</p>
<p>Could you tell us where our listeners can find you online to find your podcast or your</p>
