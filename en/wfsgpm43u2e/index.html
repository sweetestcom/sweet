<p>﻿[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>all right welcome back everyone we have</p>
<p>a great show a great number of people</p>
<p>lined up to ask questions anything that</p>
<p>I say is definitely not meant or</p>
<p>intended to give you any cures or help</p>
<p>you even prevent anything so it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>for information food for thought so</p>
<p>check with your doctor before</p>
<p>implementing any of the things that I</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>all right Steve</p>
<p>over to you all right thank you so much</p>
<p>uh good morning everyone and I think we</p>
<p>had a nice gentleman named Jackman if I</p>
<p>have it right he was on a forklift in a</p>
<p>factory and he had a mask on because he</p>
<p>has an abscessed tooth and just the</p>
<p>breathing in on it was driving him crazy</p>
<p>so short of uh you know plowing the</p>
<p>forklift into a dentist office how about</p>
<p>people before they get to the dentist or</p>
<p>whatever what can they do for an</p>
<p>abscessed tooth maybe he&rsquo;s listening I</p>
<p>hope</p>
<p>the abscesses are are really tough</p>
<p>because your body&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>encapsulate an infection and um you know</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t know what you can do for pain</p>
<p>relief other than maybe some clove oil</p>
<p>on the tooth until you can get it</p>
<p>handled</p>
<p>um some people</p>
<p>um who have root canals then later on</p>
<p>develop abscess abscesses underneath</p>
<p>that tooth and so in that case the tooth</p>
<p>is probably dead and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to deal with that but uh yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to find a competent dentist</p>
<p>that can fix that</p>
<p>um because that infection</p>
<p>um they found bacteria from</p>
<p>from infections like that in other</p>
<p>places in the body so it can spread so</p>
<p>it does create a situation</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know other than clove oil</p>
<p>topically I don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not going to ever you</p>
<p>know resolve unless you go to a dentist</p>
<p>that knows how to you know deal with</p>
<p>that yeah that&rsquo;s one of the worst things</p>
<p>and of course this takes us back to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what was it stranded with Tom Hanks</p>
<p>anyway he banged one of those out with a</p>
<p>ice skate and a coconut</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s we&rsquo;d all like to</p>
<p>take a better remedy to pain relief than</p>
<p>that so good luck to you sir I hope you</p>
<p>get that fixed very soon let&rsquo;s kick it</p>
<p>off with our first question of the day</p>
<p>Dr Bergen here it is</p>
<p>okay if insulin prevents brain plaquing</p>
<p>in Alzheimer&rsquo;s like that amyloid plaque</p>
<p>and Alzheimer&rsquo;s which by the way it does</p>
<p>which is interesting</p>
<p>then why shouldn&rsquo;t we just be focused on</p>
<p>raising insulin</p>
<p>with a higher carb diet now that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very interesting question I can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>to hear the answer to that and speaking</p>
<p>of answers folks let&rsquo;s also kick it off</p>
<p>with this um pleasing graphic of Dr</p>
<p>Berg&rsquo;s app which is uh not only</p>
<p>available now but they&rsquo;ve really come</p>
<p>through it and made it work very</p>
<p>efficiently so unlike YouTube and other</p>
<p>social media you&rsquo;ll be able to find the</p>
<p>video you&rsquo;re looking for both on Apple a</p>
<p>store and Google Play additionally they</p>
<p>have like podcasts so if you&rsquo;re driving</p>
<p>you can listen to Dr Berg&rsquo;s remedies not</p>
<p>cures but suggestions and so on please</p>
<p>check with your doctor</p>
<p>before you feel better and uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>what else I think that&rsquo;s it for that so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific digging to that question</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go straight over to our social</p>
<p>media folks and Karen from YouTube what</p>
<p>are your thoughts on organic versus free</p>
<p>range or pasture-raised chickens</p>
<p>organic what there&rsquo;s one one word that I</p>
<p>missed sure uh let&rsquo;s see on organic</p>
<p>versus free range uh is there any</p>
<p>difference</p>
<p>so organic pastures or free range</p>
<p>well as far as chickens and chicken eggs</p>
<p>ideally you need of course pasture</p>
<p>raised not pasteurized uh you want</p>
<p>chickens that actually can roam around</p>
<p>outside the barn eating bugs that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>ideal situation and there are certain um</p>
<p>companies now that I would seek out if I</p>
<p>were you that have videos on their</p>
<p>website to show you their happy chickens</p>
<p>and then you can see what really happens</p>
<p>because honestly most of the chickens</p>
<p>out there don&rsquo;t see the light of day and</p>
<p>so you look you crack the yolk open and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like wow it&rsquo;s just so nice and</p>
<p>yellow well little do you know uh</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using certain food coloring and</p>
<p>colorings to add that color in there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not coming from a true</p>
<p>carotenoid is coming from a synthetic</p>
<p>carotenoid I have actually a test that</p>
<p>measures carotenoids and eggs and so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to be doing some research on that</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily differentiate</p>
<p>between the synthetic versus the natural</p>
<p>but you can still figure it out because</p>
<p>the synthetic</p>
<p>does not float when you do the mixture</p>
<p>in other words um the true carotenoids</p>
<p>the natural ones are fat soluble so they</p>
<p>kind of float at the top so Bingo you</p>
<p>can actually determine that just by</p>
<p>looking at that but um</p>
<p>anyway</p>
<p>um I just wanted to bring that up</p>
<p>because um</p>
<p>the eggs are one of the best foods and</p>
<p>uh you know it&rsquo;s worth spending a little</p>
<p>bit more and getting a high quality egg</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um you know it&rsquo;s so funny look at these</p>
<p>commercial eggs and it says oh yeah</p>
<p>grain fed like or vegetarian fed like</p>
<p>yeah well that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>the greatest because you&rsquo;re just using</p>
<p>soy and uh what even if you as compared</p>
<p>to what animal animal meat you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeding or animal waste products I mean</p>
<p>like so it&rsquo;s just there&rsquo;s a lot of um</p>
<p>marketing involved in making it sound</p>
<p>really great a lot of sleight of hand</p>
<p>out there in that but anyway</p>
<p>get some healthy chickens however you</p>
<p>can do that I was in Zambia once and ate</p>
<p>eggs there and boy what a difference and</p>
<p>they were indeed free range and the the</p>
<p>yolks were so rich and yellow or no</p>
<p>orange really yeah they&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>golden yeah it&rsquo;s very amazing so uh so</p>
<p>go get them okay on next is uh Tilly</p>
<p>from YouTube what can a person do about</p>
<p>polyneuropathy</p>
<p>okay so poly means uh many neuropathy</p>
<p>problem with the Nerf so we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>um usually when you have multiple nerve</p>
<p>damage that can be coming from many</p>
<p>different things one being diabetes so</p>
<p>the best thing to do is change your diet</p>
<p>come off carbohydrates that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>increase your micro and macro</p>
<p>vascularization so that means that the</p>
<p>tiny little capillaries are going to</p>
<p>start healing as well as the big</p>
<p>arteries are going to start healing so</p>
<p>you have less oxidation and so then you</p>
<p>can have</p>
<p>um blood flow to your actual nerves</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really the problem is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting enough nutrition or</p>
<p>blood flow or oxygen to the nerves and</p>
<p>it dies so one one really good remedy to</p>
<p>stop the symptoms and like pretty quick</p>
<p>is is that benfotamine I talked about</p>
<p>the before it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a type of B</p>
<p>vitamin that goes it&rsquo;s a fat soluble so</p>
<p>it goes right into the nerve and it</p>
<p>works great so benfotamine take more</p>
<p>than it recommends like I would just</p>
<p>take 4 times as much as it recommends</p>
<p>they say take one pill a day take four</p>
<p>and then you can also add something else</p>
<p>too it&rsquo;s called alpha lipoic acid both</p>
<p>of those work great for um peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathies polyneuropathies</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>neuropathies so um yeah you could use</p>
<p>that especially if you&rsquo;re pre-diabetic</p>
<p>or a diabetic</p>
<p>okay very good well there&rsquo;s a great deal</p>
<p>of interest about that and uh and other</p>
<p>things so we are going to go over to</p>
<p>Terry&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>thoughtful list of who&rsquo;s watching he</p>
<p>just produced two so he obviously has</p>
<p>already supplemented the one that he did</p>
<p>initially and so here we go good morning</p>

<p>United States of America so thanks</p>
<p>everyone for joining and you know we</p>
<p>have an international cast as well let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see yes and to prove that we have Taha</p>
<p>from UK let me bring him up and he is</p>
<p>our first International guest today Taha</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on or Taha you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>Burke</p>
<p>all right thank you</p>
<p>a big fan of you I&rsquo;ve been following you</p>
<p>for now nearly a year uh my question is</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with the</p>
<p>gallstones uh earlier this year and</p>
<p>luckily got your just right now</p>
<p>this thing in the post just hour one</p>
<p>hour back so the question is like I got</p>
<p>like this three gallstones and like as</p>
<p>usual the conventional doctor saying go</p>
<p>and get it removed the gallbladder</p>
<p>uh but I&rsquo;ve seen your videos are saying</p>
<p>that gallbladder removal is not can be a</p>
<p>little bit like dubious so</p>
<p>have this thing the supplements I mean</p>
<p>should I use anything else with that</p>
<p>thing in order to uh get those</p>
<p>gallstones out and just make my</p>
<p>gallbladder working functional well and</p>
<p>also the diet along with these things</p>
<p>yeah how big were the golf stands do you</p>
<p>know uh it&rsquo;s a three only uh 1.5</p>
<p>centimeters the biggest one the rest is</p>
<p>smaller</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>um well so it so again like</p>
<p>you know I can&rsquo;t make any claims that my</p>
<p>product or any other product can</p>
<p>actually cure that but I&rsquo;m just going to</p>
<p>give you the data on gallstones it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>um a recognized</p>
<p>treatment to use uh bile salts for</p>
<p>gallstones uh unfortunately a lot of</p>
<p>doctors don&rsquo;t want to do that for some</p>
<p>reason they just want to take the</p>
<p>gallbladder out but but then what and</p>
<p>then now you&rsquo;re left with this uh</p>
<p>without a gallbladder good thing it was</p>
<p>an extra organ that we didn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>because the apparently the body does</p>
<p>make a lot of mistakes you know</p>
<p>developing organs that doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>need and that&rsquo;s so not true the more you</p>
<p>study the body the more you realize that</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make mistakes</p>
<p>um so we need that organ and the other</p>
<p>thing is that um so you&rsquo;re taking the uh</p>
<p>bile salts I would take a</p>
<p>um probably one with a meal and then I</p>
<p>would take uh</p>
<p>one on an empty stomach</p>
<p>and another on empty stomach okay in the</p>
<p>afternoon</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s going to put more bile that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help to thin the bile that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help to slowly dissolve things</p>
<p>I would also recommend ordering online</p>
<p>uh tadka</p>
<p>and choline both of those are are just</p>
<p>some really ninja extra things that you</p>
<p>can take and you just take um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just going to be taking more and</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll take Tucka take take two in</p>
<p>the morning and then two in the</p>
<p>afternoon so now we have a lot more bile</p>
<p>flowing through our bodies and then that</p>
<p>will speed things up and help hopefully</p>
<p>help dissolve things</p>
<p>um now as far as</p>
<p>um prevention</p>
<p>well what causes a lack of bile</p>
<p>a lot of things I have videos on that</p>
<p>you have it could be a low fat diet</p>
<p>believe it or not because fat</p>
<p>stimulation it could be you you have</p>
<p>been you haven&rsquo;t been doing the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet long enough for you to</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve been doing the opposite of</p>
<p>that more carbs which basically will</p>
<p>deplete your bile over time so um</p>
<p>supporting the gut biome getting on keto</p>
<p>um well I&rsquo;ll actually help you in the</p>
<p>long run prevent this problem</p>
<p>now I I had some serious gallbladder</p>
<p>problems and of course I was eating a</p>
<p>tremendous amount of fat and everyone</p>
<p>was saying oh it&rsquo;s the fat well along</p>
<p>with that fat I was doing a tremendous</p>
<p>amount of carb so if you&rsquo;re doing the</p>
<p>fat without the carb you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>so these are just things that I would</p>
<p>recommend and then also watch my um my</p>
<p>acupressure technique to kind of massage</p>
<p>the left and right areas underneath the</p>
<p>rib cage just because you know you got</p>
<p>this little sack there that&rsquo;s holding</p>
<p>the concentrated bile and if you massage</p>
<p>that area you can help me push things</p>
<p>through these little tubes they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called bile ducts and facilitate more</p>
<p>drainage but when soon as you take those</p>
<p>bile salts that&rsquo;s going to actually</p>
<p>increase</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the sludge and things will come out a</p>
<p>lot easier so the tadka and the bio</p>
<p>slots that you have are going to help</p>
<p>thin the bile and that&rsquo;s really what you</p>
<p>want to do right now</p>
<p>lovely I should be using the liver</p>
<p>cleanse detox as well do you recommend</p>
<p>it along with this I mean that that that</p>
<p>would support the liver directly not a</p>
<p>bad idea because that that um because</p>
<p>guess what makes bile cells um your</p>
<p>liver so the better the liver the more</p>
<p>bio and so many people have a fatty</p>
<p>liver and they don&rsquo;t even know it and</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t produce the bile so yeah so the</p>
<p>liver is important</p>
<p>uh then thanks for that exercise because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really working as well the</p>
<p>massage under the the ribcage awesome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thank you for your great</p>
<p>representation uh lovely holiday happy</p>
<p>holidays and half season and a new Happy</p>
<p>New Year Dr work as well thank you thank</p>
<p>you all the viewers thank you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrific uh thank you so much have a</p>
<p>great time a lot of holiday cheer kind</p>
<p>of wrapping up a little sad as we move</p>
<p>on toward the January doldrums for most</p>
<p>people I think uh okay and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to social no let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to answering the first question of today</p>
<p>which I thought was very interesting and</p>
<p>the question asked if if insulin</p>
<p>prevents brain plaquing and Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>then why shouldn&rsquo;t we be focused on</p>
<p>raising the insulin uh with a higher</p>
<p>carb diet and</p>
<p>um 75 increasing carbs would have harm</p>
<p>to vital organs like the liver and</p>
<p>kidneys 25 say it would actually harm</p>
<p>the brain over uh the long run so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s 75 and 25 any</p>
<p>Wizards in those answers</p>
<p>so this is I think this is a really</p>
<p>really key very important point so if</p>
<p>anyone has checked out watching this and</p>
<p>just check back in right now and really</p>
<p>focus in on what I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re dealing with Dementia</p>
<p>neurodegeneration of the brain</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s right you need to know this</p>
<p>if you have a loved one loved one or</p>
<p>anyone you know</p>
<p>this is the data okay</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the most important thing to do is to uh</p>
<p>get your diet corrected and um insulin</p>
<p>as you may already know lowers blood</p>
<p>sugars but it has other functions and</p>
<p>one other really important function is</p>
<p>neuro</p>
<p>like brain neurons protection</p>
<p>yeah I know that&rsquo;s interesting so it</p>
<p>protects the brain against</p>
<p>um does that plaquing that can develop</p>
<p>in the brain amyloid plaquing in</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s right so so we need the</p>
<p>insulin so but here&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>how do we increase insulin</p>
<p>by eating carbs so that&rsquo;s conflicting</p>
<p>information so here&rsquo;s the here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>missing information for most people when</p>
<p>you start to do that as soon as you</p>
<p>start to increase insulin from carbs</p>
<p>your body</p>
<p>creates resistance</p>
<p>it starts creating insulin resistance</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>you end up with a an insulin deficiency</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>so check this out the reason why you</p>
<p>have increased insulin to create insulin</p>
<p>deficiencies because the body creates</p>
<p>this barrier because it&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>protect you</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>it sounds weird but once you understand</p>
<p>it it makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>so the solution is to um</p>
<p>normalize insulin okay don&rsquo;t try to</p>
<p>increase it with carbs and the way you</p>
<p>normalize it is you fix insulin</p>
<p>resistance which most people have and</p>
<p>you do that with several things</p>
<p>so you might want to write this down cut</p>
<p>down your carbs</p>
<p>lower tubes</p>
<p>intermittent fasting intermittent</p>
<p>fasting I&rsquo;m talking about um one meal a</p>
<p>day one meal a day if you I mean if you</p>
<p>have Alzheimer&rsquo;s or going in the</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>more than that it&rsquo;s unneeded it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unnecessary you can greatly turn things</p>
<p>around with this omad one meal a day and</p>
<p>you might be saying well oh my gosh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna starve to death well guess what no</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not and you have a really healthy</p>
<p>meal make sure it&rsquo;s big enough but um</p>
<p>you want to um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to turn</p>
<p>things around really fast that one meal</p>
<p>a day that way you fast 23 hours and wow</p>
<p>watch what happens to your brain it</p>
<p>starts to heal so we got the one meal a</p>
<p>day low carb</p>
<p>lower your stress stress activates</p>
<p>cortisol cortisol makes your body make</p>
<p>sugar it&rsquo;s like eating candy believe it</p>
<p>or not I know it&rsquo;s weird so you lower</p>
<p>stress and then you exercise all those</p>
<p>things very simply will help turn things</p>
<p>around very important and the kind of</p>
<p>the necessity foundation and again if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand that you could be</p>
<p>ending up giving your um your spouse or</p>
<p>a loved one you know oh let&rsquo;s just give</p>
<p>them some ice cream let me give him some</p>
<p>carbs let&rsquo;s make sure they have enough</p>
<p>nourishment by feeding them too</p>
<p>frequently and end up unknowingly</p>
<p>worsening the situation</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um anyway that&rsquo;s just some really key</p>
<p>things and now you know this really big</p>
<p>confusion and the most important thing</p>
<p>to do for Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients okay now</p>
<p>to add to the confusion Maybe here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>true falser our next question dealing</p>
<p>with plaque</p>
<p>all right true or false amyloid plaque</p>
<p>is a um</p>
<p>is a potent anti-microbial protein a</p>
<p>hundred times stronger than penicillin</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking about that uh beta</p>
<p>amyloid plaquing and from Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wow is that true or false hmm if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true what the heck do you do with that</p>
<p>all right so let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media</p>
<p>um oh no we have more shout outs this is</p>
<p>a quick one folks they did they want to</p>
<p>make sure they were mentioned in Spain</p>
<p>Montenegro nambia Israel Paraguay Hong</p>
<p>Kong Tunisia Brazil and Bulgaria thank</p>
<p>you folks for chiming in uh after the</p>
<p>fact that&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>uh oh</p>
<p>um uh</p>
<p>pan Veer from YouTube keto is causing</p>
<p>tremendous constipation oops and</p>
<p>bleeding in my bowel movements what can</p>
<p>I do to address this</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s either one of two things one</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re doing too much fiber or</p>
<p>number two you&rsquo;re not doing enough so</p>
<p>basically simply ask yourself</p>
<p>what what was the big change when you</p>
<p>went on keto did you increase the</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>or decrease them</p>
<p>chances are you probably increased them</p>
<p>which means you have some underlying</p>
<p>pre-existing inflammation in your gut</p>
<p>because anytime someone has the gut</p>
<p>inflammation they do a lot of fiber it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to tear them up and bind them up</p>
<p>so they need to do more carnivore keto</p>
<p>for a while make sure it&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>version of that and then that will um</p>
<p>that will help to restore the gut and</p>
<p>take the inflammation away and then you</p>
<p>can slowly add in some some fibers as</p>
<p>the gut heals but in the form maybe</p>
<p>fermented like sauerkraut something like</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>so um why don&rsquo;t I recommend carnivore</p>
<p>for everyone because</p>
<p>um I think I don&rsquo;t need to do that</p>
<p>because if you can if you don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>serious gut issue you can tolerate some</p>
<p>of these plant uh plants that have other</p>
<p>benefits phytonutrients nutrients uh</p>
<p>things like that so I personally have a</p>
<p>good amount of salad every single day</p>
<p>and a lot of Diversified type of uh</p>
<p>plants but I don&rsquo;t do I actually add</p>
<p>that a good amount of animal protein in</p>
<p>there as well so I can get the complete</p>
<p>Spectrum but</p>
<p>um so I think a combination is great if</p>
<p>you can do it but honestly</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if there are vegans out there that are</p>
<p>trying to exist on</p>
<p>plant alone and doing a lot of grains</p>
<p>and stuff you have to be pretty darn</p>
<p>healthy to be a vegan</p>
<p>to handle the um</p>
<p>some of the uh some of the stuff in the</p>
<p>fiber that can irritate the gut</p>
<p>so um I know that sounds strange but uh</p>
<p>um if you go into</p>
<p>doing vegan um and you&rsquo;re you have gut</p>
<p>problems oh my gosh you&rsquo;re going to end</p>
<p>up with</p>
<p>a lot of issues</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a tough one</p>
<p>okay and an oft asked question uh wants</p>
<p>to know uh oh teenage specific from</p>
<p>YouTube my hair has been thinning</p>
<p>noticeably while on keto what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and once again I just like to throw in</p>
<p>that uh Dr Berg from what I know is not</p>
<p>wearing a wig and his lovely wife Karen</p>
<p>is like Rapunzel she has this thick</p>
<p>beautiful shock of hair and I don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>any hair on the floor around either of</p>
<p>them so you can be on keto and have</p>
<p>beautiful hair but I have heard that</p>
<p>some people have an issue with that</p>
<p>doctor can we help in this case Tina the</p>
<p>the couple things I would look at I</p>
<p>would look are you having enough protein</p>
<p>because with keto you have a moderate</p>
<p>protein not high not low are you doing</p>
<p>the quality protein versus some protein</p>
<p>powders which are not quality and then</p>
<p>the second thing is the trace minerals</p>
<p>are the activators for certain enzymes</p>
<p>that help you grow hair and then also</p>
<p>the B vitamins are you doing the B</p>
<p>vitamins</p>
<p>um these are all things I would look at</p>
<p>because when you do Keto if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>supply enough B vitamins and sometimes</p>
<p>the trace minerals and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting it from the food you know</p>
<p>potentially you can lose some hair</p>
<p>um but a lot of times it&rsquo;s just a matter</p>
<p>of increasing more protein as well</p>
<p>very good</p>
<p>um another thing I hear a bunch these</p>
<p>days is nitrous oxide it seems to be</p>
<p>everywhere</p>
<p>and uh let&rsquo;s see I&rsquo;ve just lost that</p>
<p>Brenda oh here we go Brenda from</p>
<p>Facebook what are the benefits of</p>
<p>nitrous oxide and how it might affect</p>
<p>endothelium</p>
<p>yeah it does support uh the endothelium</p>
<p>the inside layer of your arteries which</p>
<p>has a lot of different sensors in there</p>
<p>for blood pressure and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and and also to uh attract</p>
<p>um immune cells that can then create a</p>
<p>plaquing issue so it can actually help</p>
<p>your blood pressure and help support the</p>
<p>inside of the arteries</p>
<p>um and so this is one another you can</p>
<p>get it from having beets you know eating</p>
<p>beets things like that but there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in a lot of different foods so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of the support what it can do a lot</p>
<p>of times people take it to help with</p>
<p>blood pressure</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>But realize blood pressure</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know just by correcting the diet</p>
<p>just coming off low carb you can usually</p>
<p>corrupt the correct the blood pressure</p>
<p>also by adding vitamin D and especially</p>
<p>especially more potassium</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll help your blood pressure</p>
<p>all right so Terry once again has</p>
<p>climbed on me he is our producer and</p>
<p>grammarian and he does he is properly</p>
<p>educated has a masters I think in</p>
<p>English and he wanted to remind me that</p>
<p>um it is nitric not nitrous oxide which</p>
<p>I probably did as a teenager it&rsquo;s Nitric</p>
<p>okay thank you for that Terry I&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>say that again</p>
<p>uh in air I hope okay Christy from</p>
<p>Facebook do you have any suggestions on</p>
<p>how to treat uh lichen planus lichten</p>
<p>planus lichen planus</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s kind of a yeasty fungal uh</p>
<p>infection and um there&rsquo;s so you can do</p>
<p>tea tree oil</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good one oregano oil you can do</p>
<p>garlic oil</p>
<p>these are all uh simple things but I</p>
<p>think that you know they tend to um you</p>
<p>people tend to get external uh fungal</p>
<p>infections because they&rsquo;re microbiome</p>
<p>okay is not it&rsquo;s not good so they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>really focusing on that you know the</p>
<p>more I look at this the more that</p>
<p>becomes really really important</p>
<p>especially even</p>
<p>relating to this next question we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be getting to if you have the</p>
<p>answers yet Steve I do should I let them</p>
<p>rip okay so the question asked and this</p>
<p>was a true falser so you&rsquo;re either right</p>
<p>or wrong amyloid plaque is a protein a</p>
<p>potent microbial protein 100 times</p>
<p>stronger than penicillin which I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>allergic to and the audience 78 say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true 22 say it&rsquo;s absolutely false</p>
<p>this is another new piece of information</p>
<p>that I um I stumbled on because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>constantly digging into these topics and</p>
<p>uh yes it&rsquo;s absolutely true I mean this</p>
<p>is um groundbreaking because</p>
<p>Steve if you go in the woods with a</p>
<p>match and you strike strike the match</p>
<p>right and you start the woods on fire</p>
<p>should you be putting all of your energy</p>
<p>and trying to get rid of that uh put out</p>
<p>that match</p>
<p>uh I guess right now rather than the</p>
<p>fire right exactly right so what happens</p>
<p>is like you have this um</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s focused on the amyloid</p>
<p>plaquing right amyloid plaque it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the match</p>
<p>uh what&rsquo;s behind that</p>
<p>they found that</p>
<p>this this amyloid plaquing</p>
<p>and these Tangles that come with it are</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re like a fishing line that</p>
<p>encapsulate uh microbes spiral kites</p>
<p>from lime uh herpes</p>
<p>type one Simplex types one</p>
<p>um also like a chlamydia type</p>
<p>microorganism and they actually are</p>
<p>trying to help you they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>anti-microbial in the brain</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>when you untangle this amyloid plaquing</p>
<p>which see the researchers are spending</p>
<p>billions of dollars to trying to to get</p>
<p>rid of the plaquing but they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>understanding what&rsquo;s behind it</p>
<p>um so we have we have this uh infection</p>
<p>so the body so it&rsquo;s not like a real</p>
<p>full-blown infection it&rsquo;s subclinical</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s below your awareness so here you</p>
<p>have this which by the way it takes like</p>
<p>20 years to develop you have this</p>
<p>plaquing that&rsquo;s developing you have no</p>
<p>symptoms right and then 20 years later</p>
<p>you get started having cognitive start</p>
<p>going in a room like what did I what did</p>
<p>I go in here for and all of a sudden you</p>
<p>have at the peak of plucking you have</p>
<p>less plucking then the immune system</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>reacts to this by creating a lot of</p>
<p>inflammation and then you have more</p>
<p>destruction</p>
<p>on top of that interest right and then</p>
<p>you start getting Alzheimer&rsquo;s so then my</p>
<p>thought is hmm</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a microbiome in the</p>
<p>brain</p>
<p>or is your brain sterile do you have</p>
<p>good bacteria in your brain and it turns</p>
<p>out you do have</p>
<p>bacteria in the brain it&rsquo;s you do have</p>
<p>microbes that help you so so of course</p>
<p>um if there&rsquo;s any alteration in the gut</p>
<p>microbiome as well as in the brain</p>
<p>microbiome that can put you at risk so</p>
<p>this all you know leads to a</p>
<p>kind of a very objective view on this</p>
<p>whole situation</p>
<p>to prevent Alzheimer&rsquo;s you really not</p>
<p>just need to focus on your insulin</p>
<p>resistance problem but you also need to</p>
<p>if you have</p>
<p>um a virus herpes virus or a tick bite</p>
<p>the key is getting your body healthy</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to just focus on well I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to start taking</p>
<p>permanent antibiotics to kill off this</p>
<p>uh this spiral kite right or I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to take these drugs to try to kill off</p>
<p>this virus you it doesn&rsquo;t work if the</p>
<p>strategy doesn&rsquo;t work you have to look</p>
<p>at the whole picture and strengthen the</p>
<p>immune system and and that and a big</p>
<p>part of that is the microbiome and a big</p>
<p>part of that is keeping your stress low</p>
<p>and keeping you sleeping you know in</p>
<p>check and exercising and all these</p>
<p>factors we talked about</p>
<p>um but this is kind of new information</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be releasing a video on it it gives</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>um a deeper understanding and a solution</p>
<p>to prevent this problem and turn around</p>
<p>I think if you catch it in time you can</p>
<p>easily turn it around</p>
<p>but it starts with the knowledge of the</p>
<p>mechanism wow well as you know Terry has</p>
<p>all sorts of embarrassing ill-gotten</p>
<p>infections so I&rsquo;m going to send him some</p>
<p>plaque straight away we&rsquo;ll get him</p>
<p>squared away</p>
<p>so Terry keep hope alive well I just I</p>
<p>forgot to say one thing Steve</p>
<p>um because because we the the</p>
<p>pre-existing Dogma about this plaque is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just oh it&rsquo;s just waste that</p>
<p>accumulates we don&rsquo;t need it has no</p>
<p>purpose it&rsquo;s just sitting there it&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>but the genes for that plaque</p>
<p>are in other species that&rsquo;s been around</p>
<p>for 400 million years so unchanged so</p>
<p>obviously it has a very very important</p>
<p>purpose</p>
<p>at the expense of a lot of collateral</p>
<p>damage Alzheimer&rsquo;s wow so I think the</p>
<p>same thing with insulin resistance is</p>
<p>trying to help you but it ends up</p>
<p>creating problems</p>
<p>wow okay let&rsquo;s see uh Dania from</p>
<p>Facebook I have a 15 year old with</p>
<p>tinnitus or whooshing in the ears what</p>
<p>can I do to reverse this annoying</p>
<p>condition in her son</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>um two or three videos I have on that</p>
<p>they should watch there&rsquo;s a technique</p>
<p>you can try that works like 50 of the</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>um and then there&rsquo;s other things that</p>
<p>you can look at as far as calcium</p>
<p>buildup on the little hairs it also can</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>um a problem with</p>
<p>um you know how you have peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathy in diabetic diabetes you can</p>
<p>also have neuropathy of that nerve</p>
<p>um in the ear from having blood sugar</p>
<p>issues and insulin resistance in which</p>
<p>case you take pinfhotamine so with a</p>
<p>little bit of understanding and and</p>
<p>questions you can kind of narrow down</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s coming from I mean another</p>
<p>cause could be it could be mucus from a</p>
<p>sinus infection and just narrow down and</p>
<p>then you can</p>
<p>address it correctly</p>
<p>very good rather than a one size fits</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>yep okay well next in from the Green</p>
<p>Room I&rsquo;m going to go to Buzzy from Nova</p>
<p>Scotia simply because she was so</p>
<p>cheerful when I spoke with her she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nice lady and let&rsquo;s see Buzzy I have</p>
<p>unmuted you so go ahead with your one</p>
<p>question for Dr Berg please</p>
<p>unmute yourself please</p>
<p>hello Dr Berg I appreciate your videos</p>
<p>and resources they are helpful and</p>
<p>informative</p>
<p>um as a member of Dr Jason funds the</p>
<p>fasting method I have lost 85 pounds 18</p>
<p>inches around my waist and 16 body fat</p>
<p>through intermittent fasting I am no</p>
<p>longer diabetic or obese I am 50 years</p>
<p>old five feet tall and I weigh 115</p>
<p>pounds</p>
<p>I do however</p>
<p>still have a pooch belly</p>
<p>my question is how can I get rid of it</p>
<p>and before you answer I want to say</p>
<p>thank you and the best of 2023 to you</p>
<p>and your loved ones</p>
<p>thank you I actually did a video on this</p>
<p>topic there&rsquo;s a couple things some of</p>
<p>that is loose skin some of it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>subcutaneous fat which is The</p>
<p>Superficial fat which is which is not as</p>
<p>much related to insulin resistance as</p>
<p>the internal visceral fat</p>
<p>which is easier to get rid of so the</p>
<p>real</p>
<p>um solution for that is going to have to</p>
<p>be more exercise</p>
<p>and also doing the reverse setups you</p>
<p>can do them standing and you tighten</p>
<p>your stomach and you Arch backwards I</p>
<p>have videos on it the reverse uh sit-ups</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re starting to</p>
<p>tighten up this loose skin in your</p>
<p>stomach and it&rsquo;ll it&rsquo;s quite interesting</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see within like a week or two</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start to go flatter and flatter</p>
<p>because the skin like if you do regular</p>
<p>sit-ups you just make the skin less</p>
<p>tight</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s one thing I would do but I</p>
<p>think now is to step up the exercise and</p>
<p>start doing a bit more of that and high</p>
<p>intensity interval training with um and</p>
<p>then occasionally do um you know maybe</p>
<p>once a month do a prolonged fasting</p>
<p>which you probably already attempting</p>
<p>that that would be very helpful but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>focus on it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>problem it&rsquo;s not related to insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s um so and being female you have</p>
<p>genes that give you more subcutaneous</p>
<p>fat and the reason for that is um</p>
<p>survival for the baby if you get</p>
<p>pregnant and then you have this extra</p>
<p>fat so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that is what&rsquo;s really going on</p>
<p>awesome and then Steve since we&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>the topic a little bit more on</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s I wanted to mention just one</p>
<p>thing I I</p>
<p>talked to a gentleman recently</p>
<p>that has a series of assisted living</p>
<p>home centers in Phoenix Arizona</p>
<p>and what I really like about this guy is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um not everyone but those that are</p>
<p>willing he&rsquo;s actually putting him on a a</p>
<p>really good ketogenic plan and a lot of</p>
<p>these uh elderly are able to go back</p>
<p>home even if they&rsquo;re in hospice not</p>
<p>everyone but some some of them and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just improving left and right so</p>
<p>if anyone has a loved one and they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>Phoenix Arizona</p>
<p>um email me at Dr Berg</p>
<p>drberg.com and I can put you in contact</p>
<p>with this person because if I had my if</p>
<p>I needed to put my wife and I&rsquo;m being</p>
<p>sarcastic now my parents whatever and I</p>
<p>had to put them in a situation I would</p>
<p>probably I would send them to this guy</p>
<p>because he really takes care of him and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s he gives them really good a</p>
<p>ketogenic plan and I always tease my</p>
<p>wife that uh honey um I&rsquo;ll send you to a</p>
<p>really good assisted living home and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be all set up and she just kind</p>
<p>of smacks me</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;ll do that</p>
<p>all right we&rsquo;re going to go to another</p>
<p>Green Room person because we&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>lot of them stacked up but first let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get out the next question here it is</p>
<p>okay what is in butter that can help you</p>
<p>fight off infection</p>
<p>okay what is in butter that can help you</p>
<p>fight off infection and so when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sick when you&rsquo;re sick I mean how is</p>
<p>butter going to help you</p>
<p>okay and Buzzy by the way sorry to cut</p>
<p>you off so quickly we love you and glad</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still watching and so on but we</p>
<p>have to move on with the clock against</p>
<p>us and we&rsquo;re going to do that by</p>
<p>bringing up Usman from Trinidad and</p>
<p>Usman I&rsquo;m going to unmute you and if you</p>
<p>do the same thing you were on with Dr</p>
<p>bird</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>yes perfectly yeah right thanks for this</p>
<p>opportunity</p>
<p>um I spoke as a privilege I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>watching the videos for the past year</p>
<p>um I started intermittent fasting eight</p>
<p>months ago</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>um about two months after</p>
<p>starting intermittent fast then I</p>
<p>developed this</p>
<p>um sleeping problem where I would go to</p>
<p>bed</p>
<p>and I will wake up about hour and a half</p>
<p>or two hours after</p>
<p>and then unable to go to sleep</p>
<p>afterwards</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>this problem I have been dealing with</p>
<p>this problem</p>
<p>all this time and it still exists</p>
<p>I did some dot work</p>
<p>um a few weeks ago I could share the</p>
<p>results</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if if it will help</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my position there okay yeah so</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t get into the blood work</p>
<p>at this point but here I&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>some my suggestion um if you if your</p>
<p>sleep has worsened by doing keto</p>
<p>um the couple things I&rsquo;d look at because</p>
<p>if you do keto the requirement for</p>
<p>certain B vitamins go up especially B1</p>
<p>okay and not having a B1 can affect your</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>um also the requirements of certain</p>
<p>electrolytes like potassium and</p>
<p>magnesium go up so I&rsquo;m assuming that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re adding about both of those in if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not I would add those back in but</p>
<p>the third thing is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>one thing that&rsquo;s I found very beneficial</p>
<p>for a good portion I&rsquo;d say 60 percent of</p>
<p>the population not everyone is to take</p>
<p>vitamin D right before bed it seems to</p>
<p>really help support the circadian</p>
<p>rhythms and help you sleep</p>
<p>um but not for every single person so</p>
<p>those are three things I would try</p>
<p>um and of course</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>um I have been using um well Dr Brooks</p>
<p>the supplements have been New Zealand&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nutritional East</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Dr Bose wheatgrass order</p>
<p>formula</p>
<p>and I always I am all serious enough um</p>
<p>by B1 then 40 million 250 mg</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Zing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>magnesium citrate</p>
<p>because of some crumbs I was having in</p>
<p>my feet also so those are the</p>
<p>supplements that I&rsquo;m using okay what</p>
<p>about potassium</p>
<p>but I I feel like about five cups and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the electrolyte products okay</p>
<p>okay so you&rsquo;re getting a potassium from</p>
<p>that but you said um</p>
<p>you have a gluten problem so but you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s no gluten in vegetables</p>
<p>just the grains</p>
<p>no gluten I said gluten</p>
<p>yeah so then just by avoiding grains</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to solve that problem</p>
<p>well I have not been using any cops um</p>
<p>uh I cut down all capsule because I use</p>
<p>is um some berries</p>
<p>okay so quick quick question tell me</p>
<p>um real quick like 10 seconds what is</p>
<p>abnormal on your blood test</p>
<p>Michael</p>
<p>um went from 158 to telephone so to 290.</p>
<p>okay on my HDL went from 65 to 58. uh my</p>
<p>um passing blood sugar went from 95 to</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>however my A1C went from 5.3 to 5.5</p>
<p>my vldl moved from 10 to 15.</p>
<p>okay this is the real abnormal case is</p>
<p>the total commercial</p>
<p>yeah I don&rsquo;t think this is a problem I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think this is a problem</p>
<p>um especially because you&rsquo;re eating more</p>
<p>fat and the total cholesterol doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>um what happens is as you as you burn</p>
<p>more fat a lot of that fat has a portion</p>
<p>of cholesterol inside the fat cell that</p>
<p>has to come out so a lot of people have</p>
<p>increased cholesterol when they do this</p>
<p>but you should get an advanced lipid</p>
<p>profile to look at the two different</p>
<p>types of LDL the ones that are the one</p>
<p>that is low dense</p>
<p>the small dense particle size versus the</p>
<p>large buoyant I would imagine</p>
<p>if you look at that you would see a</p>
<p>whole different picture of some good</p>
<p>things but since the fact your HDL went</p>
<p>up</p>
<p>HDL went up</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s a good indicator</p>
<p>yes your A1C went up but just it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>within the normal range</p>
<p>um so what I probably would do</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re concerned about this I would</p>
<p>add more exercise</p>
<p>um to burn off some of this stuff and uh</p>
<p>like even for me I have to um when you</p>
<p>do keto sometimes you you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>changing over the fuel system so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>getting more energy more efficient</p>
<p>energy and just the energy alone could</p>
<p>keep you up that is what happened to me</p>
<p>so I had to</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m on keto which I have been for a</p>
<p>long time I have to exercise more to get</p>
<p>myself tired so I can sleep at night if</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m like okay</p>
<p>uh because my body just needs to be</p>
<p>tired so I would add in a good exercise</p>
<p>something or physical work one of the</p>
<p>two to the point where it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>good solid workout and see if that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t help your sleeping</p>
<p>oh this is I&rsquo;m sorry go ahead and Usman</p>
<p>by the way we&rsquo;re fighting the clock so I</p>
<p>hope all that gives you some great</p>
<p>directions there&rsquo;s a lot probably to</p>
<p>this side I have to unwind but um I I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to take a lot longer</p>
<p>to evaluate everything I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing a lot right I tell you what why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you just email me more details to</p>
<p>Dr Berg drberg.com and I&rsquo;ll see if I can</p>
<p>take a look at that okay that&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>great best of luck Gooseman thanks for</p>
<p>calling in from Trinidad and we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>answers to quiz question number three</p>
<p>which asks what in butter can help you</p>
<p>fight off infection and uh the audience</p>
<p>uh 45 say vitamin D 20 say K2 20 say</p>
<p>vitamin A and</p>
<p>oh vitamin D was the first one and then</p>
<p>20 say vitamin A and ten percent say uh</p>
<p>butyrate</p>
<p>okay well you&rsquo;re all right</p>
<p>um the fat soluble vitamins and</p>
<p>specifically</p>
<p>um vitamin A it&rsquo;s a good source of</p>
<p>vitamin A vitamin A you know I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really talk about it as much for your</p>
<p>immune system like I do vitamin D which</p>
<p>vitamin D is like hands down the best</p>
<p>the vitamin A without enough of that</p>
<p>what happens is you do not have the</p>
<p>capacity</p>
<p>for those antibodies so the antibodies</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t help you now whatever and what is</p>
<p>an antibody an antibiot is that little</p>
<p>uh thing in your immune system that goes</p>
<p>around and locates</p>
<p>uh these bad guys and tags them</p>
<p>so then the other part of immune system</p>
<p>can come in and assassinate them</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t do the destruction itself</p>
<p>it identifies it&rsquo;s kind of like the uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what do you call that Steve when you</p>
<p>have uh</p>
<p>um someone that is going out to find</p>
<p>certain criminals to call them what</p>
<p>Bounty Hunter yes the bounty hunters so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what these guys are these</p>
<p>antibodies and so without vitamin A you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that capacity for the Bounty</p>
<p>Hunter anymore so now we have less</p>
<p>immune system so if I this is why butter</p>
<p>is a good thing to consume uh when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re run down or sick but it also has</p>
<p>vitamin D which is awesome and vitamin E</p>
<p>also supports the immune system nk2</p>
<p>and butyrate so all these things are</p>
<p>really important for the immune system</p>
<p>wonderful congratulations audience uh</p>
<p>you did very well on that last question</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s throw one up I took it out of</p>
<p>order because we may only have time for</p>
<p>one more with all our folks in the</p>
<p>waiting room and this is very</p>
<p>interesting I thought</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>our cataracts more likely to develop</p>
<p>from a high or low cholesterol situation</p>
<p>all right dig into that audience and we</p>
<p>do have some social media so of course</p>
<p>we only want to support them but I am</p>
<p>going to go back to the Green Room so uh</p>
<p>uh Daryl if you would belt out your</p>
<p>question just as quickly as possible</p>
<p>because I want to make sure we get to</p>
<p>everyone and Daryl you were on with Dr</p>
<p>Berg welcome to the show</p>
<p>uh unmute yourself dear</p>
<p>no I still can&rsquo;t hear you</p>
<p>I tell you what if you want unplug your</p>
<p>headset many times that&rsquo;ll work and you</p>
<p>can just talk through the computer</p>
<p>no oh yes now we can there you go</p>
<p>Pittsburgh I was totally committed to</p>
<p>keto took your keto coaching course and</p>
<p>was just really excited about it and I</p>
<p>took the advice to get a CT calcium</p>
<p>score my score was 7.97 rocked my world</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been confused ever since what</p>
<p>advice can you give me okay well here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the confusion probably is coming in like</p>
<p>oh my gosh it&rsquo;s like what am I going to</p>
<p>do um we you probably you probably did</p>
<p>not do this right before you started the</p>
<p>ketogenic plan you probably did it after</p>
<p>you kind of got started so we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>because when you evaluate something you</p>
<p>always need two of something to look at</p>
<p>the comparison right so</p>
<p>um I mean it could have been higher and</p>
<p>all of a sudden it&rsquo;s coming down we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know but okay so it&rsquo;s high so what</p>
<p>that means is that uh you need to</p>
<p>continue what you&rsquo;re doing and then</p>
<p>reevaluate in maybe two months and then</p>
<p>see the change because you really now</p>
<p>have the prediction on what you need to</p>
<p>focus more on and that is the um the</p>
<p>arteries right so then the tocatrinos</p>
<p>would be important keeping your carbs</p>
<p>low</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>making sure that you do the healthy</p>
<p>version of Keto all these things are</p>
<p>going to help you make sure you fast uh</p>
<p>maybe do one meal a day I think if you</p>
<p>just did that and then reevaluate is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see a nice change over</p>
<p>time and it&rsquo;ll keep coming down more and</p>
<p>more and more so what</p>
<p>what they also found in some of this</p>
<p>calcium plaquing is biofilms or microbes</p>
<p>which is fascinating and that&rsquo;s all fed</p>
<p>you know with what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>here with the insulin and and the</p>
<p>glucose and stuff probably in the past</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um if you look at my recent videos on</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>cardiovascular health in relationship to</p>
<p>the biofilms I give a couple other</p>
<p>things that you can do</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another thing you can do too</p>
<p>which is a good key later right you can</p>
<p>do a key later so um natural chelators I</p>
<p>talk about that and so you can start to</p>
<p>strip off some of the calcium but of</p>
<p>course</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you only did one test so now we have to</p>
<p>do a comparison over time to see the</p>
<p>change I think you&rsquo;re doing the right</p>
<p>thing and you just need to stand it but</p>
<p>now you have</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like when it&rsquo;s like doing a</p>
<p>DNA test and finding out your where your</p>
<p>weaknesses are that&rsquo;s valuable so I</p>
<p>think um</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to do fine I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it I would just</p>
<p>keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>um the worst thing you can do is</p>
<p>go back to maybe what you&rsquo;re doing and</p>
<p>maybe higher carbs because that&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to create more inflammation we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>trying to reduce inflammation</p>
<p>tocatrinols are going to be really</p>
<p>important every day because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really targeting specifically the inside</p>
<p>layer of your arteries and that&rsquo;ll be uh</p>
<p>very supportive to reduce any more</p>
<p>buildup but</p>
<p>um yeah I think you&rsquo;re going to do fine</p>
<p>you just keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>keep improving it and give it more time</p>
<p>and reevaluate</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s great well thank you thank</p>
<p>you Daryl and please do get back with us</p>
<p>uh with uh with all the great results</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting and by the way this</p>
<p>continuing things sort of hilarious Dr</p>
<p>Bergen I&rsquo;m going to take it as a</p>
<p>compliment people continue to question</p>
<p>whether the show is live maybe it&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>good to be Live Well muramasa from</p>
<p>YouTube just a question when it was live</p>
<p>so murmas unless we have a time machine</p>
<p>we are answering now that yes indeed and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll prove it Dr Berg hold up two</p>
<p>fingers</p>
<p>unbelievable I don&rsquo;t know if that proved</p>
<p>anything but there they are and we are</p>
<p>indeed uh live so muramasa I want you to</p>
<p>rest assured that you&rsquo;re getting the</p>
<p>latest updates on um health and so on</p>
<p>and in fact we&rsquo;d invite you why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you sign up muramasa for the uh to be a</p>
<p>guest on the show I&rsquo;m sure you have some</p>
<p>interesting question we&rsquo;d love to meet</p>
<p>you and demonstrate how much fun you</p>
<p>have as a live contestant okay let&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>move along now uh to the answer to the</p>
<p>fourth question of the day which asked</p>
<p>are cataracts more likely to develop</p>
<p>from low or high cholesterol</p>
<p>uh and 65 say it&rsquo;s low cholesterol 35</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s because of high cholesterol any</p>
<p>winners yeah the answer is low</p>
<p>cholesterol huh interesting yeah we need</p>
<p>we need this cholesterol uh for hormones</p>
<p>uh for cell membranes</p>
<p>for um for the myelin sheath in our</p>
<p>brains</p>
<p>um uh 25</p>
<p>of your brain is cholesterol</p>
<p>and um so that&rsquo;s interesting so we also</p>
<p>need cholesterol as a precursor to make</p>
<p>vitamin D with with the uh the exposure</p>
<p>to Sun we need cholesterol to build up</p>
<p>the bile salts so you know cholesterol&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotten a bad name but it has a purpose</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important and if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough you you&rsquo;re likely to get</p>
<p>things like um cataracts</p>
<p>especially I mean like think about just</p>
<p>just take a look just take a look at</p>
<p>statins right look at the side effects</p>
<p>from statins I mean that&rsquo;ll just blow</p>
<p>you away but of course if you look up</p>
<p>the side effects from statins on the</p>
<p>first two or three or four or five pages</p>
<p>of Google it&rsquo;ll say oh there is no side</p>
<p>effects it&rsquo;s totally harmless it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>and then you have to really dig deep so</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>these Google searches have are becoming</p>
<p>a slightly biased I know this is hard to</p>
<p>believe but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s the problem goodness okay uh</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;ve got one more person</p>
<p>uh Sherry who&rsquo;s waiting in the green</p>
<p>room and share we are fighting the clock</p>
<p>so if you don&rsquo;t mind give me one</p>
<p>question in 30 seconds so we can get a</p>
<p>good answer back to you you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>air with Dr Berg</p>
<p>good morning Dr Berg good morning</p>
<p>uh I like many people am very confused</p>
<p>about cholesterol in foods</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to</p>
<p>um comment on</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>two videos</p>
<p>one is</p>
<p>um from nutrition Made Simple</p>
<p>and the name of it is the effects of</p>
<p>dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Dr Tom Day Spring talks about the effect</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>of dietary cholesterol on blood</p>
<p>cholesterol and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that is pretty complicated and I would</p>
<p>like your comment on it the second video</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>um again from nutrition made simple and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s entitled Dr Burr</p>
<p>um gets fact checked by MD PhD yeah um</p>
<p>so you can just comment on those yeah I</p>
<p>know about that video</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to try to make this really simple</p>
<p>um yeah that that particular doctor is</p>
<p>um he&rsquo;s not sponsored by his videos</p>
<p>directly but indirectly is part of a</p>
<p>foundation that he&rsquo;s sponsored by um</p>
<p>another group that is uh</p>
<p>um supporting the plant base which is</p>
<p>fine I had no problem with that but</p>
<p>um so he did find uh he found that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one error that I I said relating</p>
<p>to cholesterol and the I think the</p>
<p>American Heart Association there was an</p>
<p>error that he pointed out which is fine</p>
<p>okay but the the whole point about</p>
<p>cholesterol and he even talks about this</p>
<p>in some of his videos it&rsquo;s like uh</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t even think he he recommends</p>
<p>going low cholesterol but um when you</p>
<p>start eating more cholesterol it is true</p>
<p>your cholesterol will increase</p>
<p>um but then as far as having high</p>
<p>cholesterol and then your risk for heart</p>
<p>disease</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that was used to be the Dogma but</p>
<p>things are changing because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>finding out it&rsquo;s not actually true and</p>
<p>so now we have a two different camps we</p>
<p>have one camp that says oh yeah it&rsquo;s we</p>
<p>have to hold that that Viewpoint and</p>
<p>then a lot of the new doctors are saying</p>
<p>no no we need to change and upgrade it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>it takes a long time for</p>
<p>um a group of</p>
<p>um doctors to agree on something</p>
<p>especially if there&rsquo;s new changes</p>
<p>um I think the best thing for you to do</p>
<p>is to try to learn a little bit more</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>um the two different types of LDL and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>also the um the data on the advanced</p>
<p>lipid profile because you have the you</p>
<p>know the thing that&rsquo;s really study is</p>
<p>the the pathogenic type of LDL which is</p>
<p>um the small dense lipopo particle size</p>
<p>versus the large buoyant if you really</p>
<p>kind of wrap your wits around that</p>
<p>um and</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;ll all make sense to you</p>
<p>because um</p>
<p>a lot of the studies that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about with cholesterol not human</p>
<p>studies other other studies that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>quoting are observational studies based</p>
<p>on questionnaires so like what do you do</p>
<p>do you um how much Credence do you give</p>
<p>these things and it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to find volunteers</p>
<p>um human volunteers to do something and</p>
<p>isolate this one variable that could be</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>um so that takes um a medical dictionary</p>
<p>it takes time to sort out and actually</p>
<p>go through the studies and look up all</p>
<p>these different words to really wrap</p>
<p>your your wits around it because if you</p>
<p>rely on</p>
<p>this information from a secondary person</p>
<p>either myself or another expert I mean</p>
<p>if we just take a medical doctor right</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of conflicting data on</p>
<p>medical doctors you know even phds</p>
<p>looking at this topic so and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be just as confused so</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>and then I also tell people okay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this big controversy about</p>
<p>cholesterol why don&rsquo;t you find out what</p>
<p>this doctor recommends as a diet okay do</p>
<p>that for a period of time</p>
<p>and then see how you feel and look at</p>
<p>your biomarkers and then do another</p>
<p>program see how you feel look at your</p>
<p>biomarkers and then you can decide</p>
<p>Because unless you are first hand and</p>
<p>experience it you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll never</p>
<p>fully know because you can go to my</p>
<p>website and I have over 6 000 success</p>
<p>stories right</p>
<p>um so I have probably more than most but</p>
<p>unless you personally try it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know for sure so</p>
<p>um we can&rsquo;t just go by cholesterol as</p>
<p>one biomarker we gotta look at the whole</p>
<p>thing but um there&rsquo;s a lot of factors</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s genetics there&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>complex thing and I I feel your pain</p>
<p>interesting well that begs the question</p>
<p>can you get any of these testimonials on</p>
<p>your great app are they there</p>
<p>no no we keep them on the website</p>
<p>because I I only have the videos on the</p>
<p>app all right very good well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most important thing well I&rsquo;m glad we</p>
<p>got through everybody including Sherry</p>
<p>that was an interesting question and a</p>
<p>fascinating answer uh Dr uh Berg let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say we do have a couple of minutes left</p>
<p>so uh why don&rsquo;t we go back wrap it up</p>
<p>with social media Devon from Facebook is</p>
<p>flaxseed good or bad for you</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good for certain people</p>
<p>um women particularly that uh that might</p>
<p>want to help support their estrogen</p>
<p>levels a little bit more after menopause</p>
<p>but typically it&rsquo;s not like a big huge</p>
<p>game changer type thing right</p>
<p>um and then if you&rsquo;re gonna do flax oil</p>
<p>um it has I would recommend uh make sure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not rancid because it goes rancid</p>
<p>real fast and then you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>get a sprouted version and you can grind</p>
<p>it and grind your own it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more of a hassle but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>benefits um</p>
<p>um as I&rsquo;m getting more into the DNA</p>
<p>testing and understanding that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m going to be doing seminars</p>
<p>or videos on this topic and then also</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be giving people the epigenetic</p>
<p>things you can do for various situations</p>
<p>which I think will be really important</p>
<p>because if you look that up right now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s first of all there&rsquo;s not a lot</p>
<p>of information on that and uh and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also very tactical so it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to understand it you know so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to simplify that but to</p>
<p>do that it takes a lot of</p>
<p>deep Dives and that&rsquo;s kind of what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing right now each day and it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just a lot</p>
<p>to tackle so but stay tuned for that all</p>
<p>right why don&rsquo;t we wrap up with this</p>
<p>Alice from YouTube thank you Dr Berg for</p>
<p>your dedication to educate people on</p>
<p>this journey to keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting it really is a game changer if</p>
<p>you have the right tools and I salute</p>
<p>you as well I am way down in weight feel</p>
<p>terrific don&rsquo;t eat all day and all those</p>
<p>things and that&rsquo;s happening for millions</p>
<p>of people around the world including</p>
<p>Alice so thank you for that comment</p>
<p>Alice</p>
<p>yes and on that note I really appreciate</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s questions and attention</p>
<p>um and also the comments on all the</p>
<p>videos I do read a lot of those comments</p>
<p>and so stay tuned for some more more</p>
<p>education on health coming up this next</p>
