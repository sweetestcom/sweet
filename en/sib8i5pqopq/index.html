<p>have are my wife Lori so let&rsquo;s get that</p>
<p>out of the way first I&rsquo;m ashamed of it</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;ll go back to a full shot of you</p>
<p>and uh let&rsquo;s go back speaking of not</p>
<p>curing anyone to last week one that we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get time to this is devoree from</p>
<p>YouTube I Follow Dr Burke&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recommendations of a leafy greens in my</p>
<p>diet and a balanced routine of</p>
<p>food-based supplements and it&rsquo;s helped</p>
<p>my sickle cell anemia immensely thanks</p>
<p>Doc so that&rsquo;s not doc trying to help</p>
<p>anybody that is feedback from the field</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a heck of a lot of you know</p>
<p>of course African Americans mainly that</p>
<p>suffer from Sickle Cell so we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>glad to hear that there is some relief</p>
<p>out there somewhere why don&rsquo;t we kick it</p>
<p>off with our first question today uh and</p>
<p>there it is</p>
<p>all right so what is the best Trace</p>
<p>mineral to help regulate</p>
<p>too much estrogen in the body like</p>
<p>estrogen dominance that&rsquo;s a condition</p>
<p>where you have maybe heavier periods</p>
<p>maybe you have um cysts in the breast</p>
<p>maybe you have heavy weight in the</p>
<p>midsection thighs buttocks area</p>
<p>um what would be the best Trace mineral</p>
<p>remedy for that</p>
<p>okay get on it uh audience and I know</p>
<p>you will let&rsquo;s go to social media this</p>
<p>time from YouTube uh ritva from YouTube</p>
<p>My ketones are at 4.0 is that considered</p>
<p>too high I fast 18 20 as her routine per</p>
<p>day and she says thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome no they&rsquo;re not too high</p>
<p>at all um and in fact um</p>
<p>you know you have uh you know when it</p>
<p>gets up to like 9 10 you know that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem but uh you you won&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>do that unless you&rsquo;re a diabetic and you</p>
<p>forget to take your insulin</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but if you you know typically an average</p>
<p>person would be between</p>
<p>you know 0.5 and 3. but then what</p>
<p>happens when you start adding fasting</p>
<p>you can go up to four</p>
<p>uh when you say exercise Echoes up to</p>
<p>five</p>
<p>um maybe six but um it&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>going to go higher than that but if it</p>
<p>does you know</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;d have to be a diabetic type one</p>
<p>okay and forgetting to take your insulin</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very very rare and um</p>
<p>most people</p>
<p>um can control their blood sugars with</p>
<p>their medication if they&rsquo;re a type 1</p>
<p>diabetic okay very good and next up from</p>
<p>also YouTube is jelly mom which might</p>
<p>suggest something about her diet uh how</p>
<p>do you manage gerd symptoms without ppis</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>gerds symptoms right so gerd is uh</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different names for</p>
<p>GERD you have reflex</p>
<p>laryngitis</p>
<p>extra pharyngeal reflux disorder like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like probably about 20 or 30</p>
<p>different names for the same thing acid</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically acid reflux and the</p>
<p>problem is the valve is not closing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not closing and the acid is coming up so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really a problem with acid it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a problem with the valve and that valve</p>
<p>has a sensor</p>
<p>to the level of pH in that stomach the</p>
<p>hydrochloric acid so</p>
<p>what you need to do is you need to</p>
<p>acidify more so that valve will close as</p>
<p>a normal response to acid and so I would</p>
<p>recommend taking uh betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride start with maybe three</p>
<p>before a meal and start to increase it a</p>
<p>little bit more each day until you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>until the acid reflux goes away and you</p>
<p>might go up to nine or even 10 before a</p>
<p>meal and then you&rsquo;re going to maintain</p>
<p>that for a period of time until you it</p>
<p>could take you know depending on how</p>
<p>long a spender could take some weeks but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>most people</p>
<p>take an antacid and get rid of the acid</p>
<p>and they feel better until the next time</p>
<p>they eat and it&rsquo;s worse because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>removing the very thing that&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to keep that valve closed and that that</p>
<p>acid that stomach controls</p>
<p>the release of bile so now we&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>gallbladder issue the release of enzymes</p>
<p>from the pancreas</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s just so so key so stay stay</p>
<p>tuned for more videos but I have a lot</p>
<p>of videos on HCL hydrochloric acid and</p>
<p>gerd you should check them out</p>
<p>all right very good in a few minutes</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have someone in a green</p>
<p>room Daniel is coming to us from</p>
<p>Palestine but in the meantime let&rsquo;s talk</p>

<p>your selfless acclair Terry every week</p>
<p>to help us keep up with all that are in</p>
<p>here and let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;re waiting for an</p>
<p>answer from our question in the meantime</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to uh social media Lori</p>
<p>from YouTube is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>oh kachaba okay on the keto diet cachaba</p>
<p>is that better spell am I saying that</p>
<p>right I guess so</p>
<p>you know uh I think it is but you just</p>
<p>have to read read the ingredients to</p>
<p>make sure there&rsquo;s no hidden anything</p>
<p>like maltodextrin tapioca you know</p>
<p>things like that uh corn fiber which is</p>
<p>a soluble fiber which is a new</p>
<p>functional synthetic fiber that they use</p>
<p>um it doesn&rsquo;t resemble corn</p>
<p>um so it really you know you just read</p>
<p>the ingredients and see if everything is</p>
<p>acceptable but um I I haven&rsquo;t read the</p>
<p>ingredients on this so I I couldn&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>you okay very good Patsy thank you doc</p>
<p>Patsy from Facebook will lemon water or</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar break a fast I am on</p>
<p>omad and down get this 75 pounds</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>um no it&rsquo;s not going to break a fast</p>
<p>um I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it um</p>
<p>the video that I released today I think</p>
<p>is pretty interesting</p>
<p>um it has to do with uh the apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar actually</p>
<p>turns right into a ketone it can be used</p>
<p>as fuel so if you want more energy</p>
<p>you should just add more apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar to your water I I um recently</p>
<p>forgot to take it for a few days and</p>
<p>then I realized why am I a little bit</p>
<p>kind of sluggish and I&rsquo;m like oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right so I started shaking again and</p>
<p>energy start coming right back up so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it in the morning and then</p>
<p>afternoon but one or two tablespoons and</p>
<p>some water gives you more energy because</p>
<p>it turns in the ketones which is</p>
<p>interesting that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t think it does that but</p>
<p>it does acetic acid actually is</p>
<p>considered a ketone</p>
<p>um fascinating an acquired taste it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually it&rsquo;s going to turn into a</p>
<p>ketone sorry</p>
<p>very good okay as promised we&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>Daniel up next uh calling in from uh the</p>
<p>Middle East and less than Daniel you sir</p>
<p>are on with Dr Berg with your one</p>
<p>question that you&rsquo;re going to belt out</p>
<p>in 30 seconds go</p>
<p>go ahead sir</p>
<p>good morning I am on</p>
<p>I am on a water fast and just waiting</p>
<p>for your question like that for the last</p>
<p>17 days I was wondering what&rsquo;s your best</p>
<p>advices for that and uh problem I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hear a bad breath</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>very safe to go for a 40-day water fast</p>
<p>and it is only water</p>
<p>water fast okay now Daniel stand by just</p>
<p>a minute I&rsquo;m not sure that Dr Berg was</p>
<p>able to hear your comments so Dr Burr</p>
<p>could you hear any of that</p>
<p>no I couldn&rsquo;t okay he wants to know if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s safe to go on a 40-day water fast</p>
<p>um which really sums up his question</p>
<p>as long as you have enough fat in your</p>
<p>body to do it and um and also you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking nutrition along the way B</p>
<p>vitamins electrolytes the vitamin D</p>
<p>um omega-3 fatty acids and the trace</p>
<p>minerals</p>
<p>um and then make sure that you know how</p>
<p>to come off that diet because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the best things to do if you</p>
<p>have cancer but 40 day fast is pretty</p>
<p>intense and then of course</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to lose some serious weight</p>
<p>but the point is that I think um it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>therapeutic in some cases and definitely</p>
<p>cancer is one of them so if I had</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>um a stage four cancer that was</p>
<p>spreading I would go a million to 40</p>
<p>days fast starting today</p>
<p>I would do that and uh</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a lot of power in what that</p>
<p>fast can do to the immune system turning</p>
<p>on certain</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>things to kill off cancer cells</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it has some good valid um</p>
<p>reasons to do it so that&rsquo;s my answer</p>
<p>okay Dale Daniel for some reason uh Dr</p>
<p>Burke couldn&rsquo;t hear you but we&rsquo;d sure</p>
<p>love to hear back from you after a</p>
<p>40-day fast and see how you did that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fascinating process certainly and a</p>
<p>healthy one I think and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing it for uh you know uh reasons of</p>
<p>your own perhaps Faith Etc so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really neat so get back with us if you</p>
<p>would and let us know because we want to</p>
<p>hear back from you thanks for joining us</p>
<p>on that now we had our first quiz</p>
<p>question out uh which asked excuse me</p>
<p>let me flip the switch yeah got so many</p>
<p>buttons audience what is the best Trace</p>
<p>mineral to help regulate too much</p>
<p>estrogen in the body estrogen dominance</p>
<p>and the audience feels or 50 of them</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s zinc 30 say it&rsquo;s selenium</p>
<p>and 20 say it&rsquo;s magnesium any winners</p>
<p>Dot</p>
<p>okay well do we don&rsquo;t have winners today</p>
<p>um but uh maybe maybe next time but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh iodine iodine has the ability to</p>
<p>regulate estrogen and um seek help right</p>
<p>think seek help with iodine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some real interesting</p>
<p>information I want to share with you on</p>
<p>an upcoming video about iodine but</p>
<p>iodine uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the best things to</p>
<p>handle like fibrocystic breast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great of course for a hypothyroid</p>
<p>case even if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s but</p>
<p>just if you have Hashimoto&rsquo;s you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to take a lot of it just take</p>
<p>sufficient amounts</p>
<p>but selenium is more for that but um</p>
<p>yeah estrogen dominant you&rsquo;ll see that</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re having period and and other</p>
<p>symptoms that are related to estrogen</p>
<p>dominance improve when you take more</p>
<p>iodine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting I&rsquo;m looking for the</p>
<p>question but there was someone who</p>
<p>talked about having a fibrocystic breast</p>
<p>so perhaps you just helped answer their</p>
<p>question yeah and there&rsquo;s some other</p>
<p>jealous listeners out there who weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mentioned and they wanted to chime in</p>
<p>and they are from Malaysia Guam Kenya</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi Kuwait Ghana United Arab</p>
<p>Emirates Albania uh Bavaria and Hungary</p>
<p>and we do have someone for Hungry coming</p>
<p>up a little later so thank you all for</p>
<p>chiming in uh with that why don&rsquo;t we pop</p>
<p>up the next question of the day and this</p>
<p>is not a true falser so</p>
<p>okay good which vitamin deficiency is</p>
<p>usually behind sciatic pain</p>
<p>sciatica pain okay now audience</p>
<p>batting zero so far oh audience anyway</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s your time to redeem yourself</p>
<p>with that next question and let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to uh social media oh no uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see yes social media</p>
<p>uh Tina from YouTube my daughter has the</p>
<p>debilitating pain and very heavy</p>
<p>menstrual cycles every month I had the</p>
<p>same thing when I was younger and had to</p>
<p>undergo a hysterectomy at 30. my</p>
<p>daughter is now 30. uh is there any hope</p>
<p>or an alternative solution for that</p>
<p>agony</p>
<p>hey that relates to the last question</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it it&rsquo;s the iodine</p>
<p>um also um</p>
<p>another thing that you could take uh is</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a little bit of calcium magnesium right</p>
<p>During the period because think about it</p>
<p>if you have these heavy cramps</p>
<p>we have a muscle spasm right so take</p>
<p>electrolytes like especially magnesium</p>
<p>and calcium that would be a good thing</p>
<p>to take at that point</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;d probably recommend maybe before</p>
<p>you go to bed that&rsquo;s a good time to take</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s other things as well</p>
<p>um that I&rsquo;ve gotten good success with uh</p>
<p>from standard processors a product</p>
<p>called eutrophin PMG that seems to be</p>
<p>very effective for the um menstrual</p>
<p>cycle cramps and happy periods but I</p>
<p>would definitely do the iodine and in</p>
<p>the form of seek help okay seek help</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good form a source of iodine and</p>
<p>other trace minerals</p>
<p>all right very good we&rsquo;ve got a couple</p>
<p>of folks whose camera cameras weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>working and one of them is uh Irene from</p>
<p>the UK Irene are you on with us</p>
<p>I am it&rsquo;s Arlene Arlene pardon me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s those readers that I have</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not working well can you hear</p>
<p>her Dr Burke</p>
<p>yes perfectly very good go ahead with</p>
<p>your question Arlene from the UK</p>
<p>okay thanks Dr Berg my husband and I do</p>
<p>about 18 to 20 hour keto intermittent</p>
<p>fasting every day occasionally we do a</p>
<p>42 hour sort of every second month how</p>
<p>often would you recommend that we do a</p>
<p>40 248 or longer fast</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>um doing it</p>
<p>um if you did it once from once a month</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d see a really good benefit</p>
<p>so I like the idea of like a a weekly um</p>
<p>you know maybe</p>
<p>you know I think you you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you said you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>one meal a day well I don&rsquo;t think you</p>
<p>are right I like consistently</p>
<p>uh well we kind of eat over a full four</p>
<p>hour period and okay</p>
<p>okay in the day yeah I like that I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great and then if you did like um</p>
<p>48 hour fast let&rsquo;s say once a month I</p>
<p>think that would be awesome and uh that</p>
<p>way you get the benefit of you know if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s anything going on in the body</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a polyp or let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s um some pre-cancer cells or or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>um something going on with the immune</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>uh periodic</p>
<p>prolonged fasting 48 or even better yet</p>
<p>72 if you can do it would be highly</p>
<p>beneficial to your body</p>
<p>thank you very much you&rsquo;re great by the</p>
<p>way thanks that&rsquo;s wonderful so are you</p>
<p>Arlene we&rsquo;re glad to hear you uh with</p>
<p>such great success and I also would love</p>
<p>to see you hear what you&rsquo;re when you go</p>
<p>to once a month perhaps let the audience</p>
<p>know how that goes for it because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a oft asked and excuse me question of</p>
<p>how often you can fast at that link so</p>
<p>uh we have a very fast audience of</p>
<p>course who&rsquo;s already answered quiz</p>
<p>question number two and that question</p>
<p>was which vitamin deficiency usually</p>
<p>behind sciatica pain and the audience</p>
<p>feels seventy percent of them say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>B12 15 say uh a D vitamin or a d excuse</p>
<p>me a D vitamin and 15 say B1</p>
<p>well I think we have a um</p>
<p>much better audience response this time</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s three uh B vitamins involved</p>
<p>um but it could be one of these three</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all B vitamins B1 B12 okay</p>
<p>which is really commonly known</p>
<p>um to actually if you&rsquo;re deficient to</p>
<p>create nerve damage because the myelin</p>
<p>sheath around the nerve can be destroyed</p>
<p>but you also have another vitamin which</p>
<p>is a B6 B6 B6</p>
<p>um has everything to do with the</p>
<p>metabolism</p>
<p>of uh myelin and um</p>
<p>so if you can</p>
<p>um make sure that you um</p>
<p>watch my upcoming video on satica and</p>
<p>carpal tunnel syndrome you can kind of</p>
<p>learn like when you would want to take</p>
<p>B6 or B1 or B12 or all three of them but</p>
<p>um boy if you have sciatica or even</p>
<p>carpal tunnel syndrome those are three</p>
<p>that you can be rest assured that would</p>
<p>greatly reduce the pain now one caveat</p>
<p>to this when you take B6</p>
<p>pyridoxine I don&rsquo;t ever recommend taking</p>
<p>that that version I would recommend</p>
<p>taking another version which you could</p>
<p>find on the label it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s p5p it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a it&rsquo;s the active version of B6</p>
<p>that actually will</p>
<p>um work better because and you&rsquo;ll see in</p>
<p>this video if you take</p>
<p>large amounts of this uh</p>
<p>regular B6 paroxetine it can actually</p>
<p>create a deficiency of B6 because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>competitive to the active form</p>
<p>so um and unfortunately most of the</p>
<p>supplements out there that are</p>
<p>multivitamins contain this version of B6</p>
<p>that could create a problem for a lot of</p>
<p>people and so you know the very solution</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to to remedy is going to</p>
<p>be causing the problem you&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>remedy so</p>
<p>um stay tuned for that video especially</p>
<p>if you have sciatica</p>
<p>very good okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>a beta tester from YouTube is the name</p>
<p>they were born with what should I eat if</p>
<p>there are no pasture-raised eggs</p>
<p>available where I live</p>
<p>organic eggs can you do organic eggs</p>
<p>that would be a step up</p>
<p>um but honestly if you if you have a</p>
<p>choice between no eggs and conventional</p>
<p>eggs</p>
<p>at least you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know something&rsquo;s better than nothing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get some good good</p>
<p>protein from that egg um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big difference in quality of</p>
<p>course but um organic eggs would be the</p>
<p>next best thing but I like to do</p>
<p>pasture-raised and organic if you can</p>
<p>find them they&rsquo;re more expensive but I</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re worth it and if you could</p>
<p>even take to the next level like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing you can raise your own chickens</p>
<p>then these chickens uh it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>expensive they don&rsquo;t eat very much and</p>
<p>hopefully they can eat some bugs around</p>
<p>your yard but boy do those chicken eggs</p>
<p>taste good and um</p>
<p>these egg these chickens just keep</p>
<p>producing and producing all year round I</p>
<p>mean I don&rsquo;t even know what we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>do with these eggs I think we it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>nine eggs a day what are we gonna do</p>
<p>with all these eggs every single day</p>
<p>they load up and um so it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>protein Source very good okay speaking</p>
<p>of iodine if your thyroid has been</p>
<p>removed do you still need iodine</p>
<p>well iodine works for a lot of other</p>
<p>things okay it works for a lot of things</p>
<p>that go Way Beyond the thyroid like I</p>
<p>said estrogen control okay</p>
<p>um but also</p>
<p>it helps</p>
<p>um with as an antimicrobial</p>
<p>it helps even lower cortisol which is</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>so it can do a lot for you but if you</p>
<p>have your thyroid removed</p>
<p>um one little tip on that I would try to</p>
<p>find a doc that can work with you to get</p>
<p>armor thyroid which is a more of a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a whole package of hormones not</p>
<p>just Synthroid which is T4 the synthetic</p>
<p>version but all the different you know</p>
<p>thyroid you know if you the thyroid</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t Just Produce T4 it produces a</p>
<p>little bit of a T3 it also produces um</p>
<p>uh calcitonin which is another hormone</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that would be something you should look</p>
<p>into very good doc you may have noticed</p>
<p>your battery died so I have put up our</p>
<p>cheerful oh rendering of view</p>
<p>um but let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>so audience if you&rsquo;ll stand by just a</p>
<p>moment</p>
<p>no problem because what I can do is I</p>
<p>have a backup battery so I already</p>
<p>predicted that we can replace that and</p>
<p>uh very good the doctor is going to</p>
<p>auxiliary power please stand by</p>
<p>all right here we go let&rsquo;s see if that</p>
<p>works</p>
<p>very close drum roll please boy that you</p>
<p>are prepared doctor he is back with us</p>
<p>okay I see I knew that was going to</p>
<p>happen sooner or later yep well here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen next is we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go on with the next question</p>
<p>not a true false or it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>require some real research there you go</p>
<p>doc</p>
<p>all right let me just um take off this</p>
<p>little square thing</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>okay all right there we go all right so</p>
<p>here we go which is worse consuming</p>
<p>Sugar by itself or consuming sugar and</p>
<p>protein or sugar and fat that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>interesting all right climb on it</p>
<p>audience as we know you will and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see let&rsquo;s go back to social media uh</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a tour probably from Ireland</p>
<p>wants to know if Irish sea moss would be</p>
<p>the best and cheapest way to get your</p>
<p>daily allotment of minerals Irish sea</p>
<p>moss</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a bad idea it is not a bad idea</p>
<p>I think you could get a lot of good</p>
<p>trace minerals and regular minerals from</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s type of seaweed</p>
<p>um or sea kelp you know CMOS anything</p>
<p>anything from the sea the problem with</p>
<p>iodine is that they don&rsquo;t the farmers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put it back in the soil so unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming something from the</p>
<p>coastal lands or from the sea chances</p>
<p>are you&rsquo;re not going to have a lot of</p>
<p>iodine and you know I mean just about I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know two billion people on the</p>
<p>planet are deficient in iodine so</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of people that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>percentage so chances are you may be</p>
<p>deficient so</p>
<p>um how do you solve that seek help CMOS</p>
<p>seaweed or shellfish or</p>
<p>you know fish from the ocean</p>
<p>very good okay marhawk more Hoxie from</p>
<p>YouTube why are my kidneys so sensitive</p>
<p>while on keto do we need to drink more</p>
<p>water when we experience kidney stress</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t describe what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>his kidneys but they&rsquo;re stressful yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m missing a lot of information when</p>
<p>you say tender it could be also not your</p>
<p>kidneys it could be just like your gut</p>
<p>which could be you know you can have</p>
<p>some inflammation in your gut because of</p>
<p>the fiber that you&rsquo;re now eating a lot</p>
<p>of so in that case you do carnivore but</p>
<p>I mean if it really is kidneys I mean</p>
<p>are you doing the healthy version of</p>
<p>Keto are you um you know maybe you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing almonds and chocolate it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>keto or spinach where you&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>lot of oxlets in which case you need to</p>
<p>be drinking a lot more water or don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>eat those oxalate Foods because oxalates</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>are a problem okay for kidney stones and</p>
<p>even like what&rsquo;s called pseudogout which</p>
<p>can actually aggravate your joints and</p>
<p>even other joints too and so there are</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>um on keto that are high in oxalates</p>
<p>chocolate</p>
<p>almonds spinach</p>
<p>of course rhubarb pie right</p>
<p>um kiwi so these are all things that you</p>
<p>need to be aware of and definitely if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re if a problem if you have a</p>
<p>problem with oxalates you need to make</p>
<p>watch my videos on that make adjustments</p>
<p>because oxalates</p>
<p>can really destroy the kidney itself</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>just an FYI I don&rsquo;t want to destroy</p>
<p>those things okay you got two Petra from</p>
<p>YouTube I have Steve one little one</p>
<p>little tip on the oxlets uh just so</p>
<p>happens that vitamin B6</p>
<p>helps to reduce oxalates too so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just a little extra no charge tip on</p>
<p>that bonus for the audience that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>I found that question I was looking for</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from Petra from YouTube and you</p>
<p>mentioned this I have a fibrocystic</p>
<p>breast I would like to know what I can</p>
<p>do to help resolve I also have a lot of</p>
<p>pain throughout my body she doesn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>anymore about that what do you think doc</p>
<p>it just is so simple this is a</p>
<p>no-brainer um you just take a little C</p>
<p>cup on a regular basis it just means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re low on iodine and so the estrogen</p>
<p>gets out of control</p>
<p>um I mean I don&rsquo;t even think</p>
<p>you know actually you have to realize</p>
<p>too estrogen</p>
<p>is um all all over the place it&rsquo;s in our</p>
<p>environment as uh chemicals that mimic</p>
<p>estrogen and um also if your thyroid</p>
<p>is on the hypo side</p>
<p>you um</p>
<p>you know because of lack of iodine</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re not going to be able to</p>
<p>metabolize</p>
<p>your cholesterol is basically you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to metabolize cholesterol too well</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t really make make things</p>
<p>from cholesterol anymore like bile and</p>
<p>vitamin D so here you are</p>
<p>unknowingly having a thyroid problem</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re deficient iodine and your</p>
<p>cholesterol is high</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not making a bile it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>perfect storm for a gallstone or a gall</p>
<p>sludge which then can cause pain</p>
<p>underneath your rib cage to refer to the</p>
<p>right shoulder and also bile is</p>
<p>necessary to help to detoxify</p>
<p>estrogen so is iodine in your liver so</p>
<p>we get this buildup of estrogen we have</p>
<p>which can then indirectly affect your</p>
<p>thyroid so you can see all these things</p>
<p>are connected so I will release the</p>
<p>video on this soon but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>very I mean I&rsquo;m telling you the the</p>
<p>Cascade of problems that occur from a</p>
<p>lack of iodine are huge</p>
<p>wow okay Lynn from Facebook I need to</p>
<p>take evening supplements and</p>
<p>progesterone I don&rsquo;t want to drink a</p>
<p>whole glass of water before bed but</p>
<p>eating anything to push the pills down</p>
<p>will break a fast any suggestions for</p>
<p>Lynn</p>
<p>you can break them up you know maybe you</p>
<p>could eat something that um</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t increase</p>
<p>or break the keto um too bad and that</p>
<p>would be like a little maybe a little</p>
<p>celery or a little vegetable</p>
<p>or maybe even um MCT oil you know as</p>
<p>something to take</p>
<p>um but the the two things that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really stimulate insulin that much would</p>
<p>be fiber</p>
<p>and fat</p>
<p>so those are two options</p>
<p>um versus the car other carbs and</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>all right very good well our third</p>
<p>question which is worse consuming Sugar</p>
<p>by itself or consuming Sugar Plus</p>
<p>protein and or fat that sounds delicious</p>
<p>doc um let&rsquo;s see the audience uh 90 say</p>
<p>its worst choice is sugar with protein</p>
<p>or fat also known as ice cream cherry</p>
<p>puts and ten percent say it&rsquo;s plain</p>
<p>sugar who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;d be much better off consuming</p>
<p>pure sugar than combined with protein or</p>
<p>fat why because when you combine it with</p>
<p>sugar sugar with protein or fat you get</p>
<p>this thing called glycation glycation</p>
<p>and glycation is basically this</p>
<p>it causes the protein and the fat to um</p>
<p>to bind in a certain way in your tissues</p>
<p>that make things get destroyed like even</p>
<p>when you uh do what&rsquo;s called an A1c</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a destruction of the hemoglobin</p>
<p>in your blood</p>
<p>and so when you are consuming things</p>
<p>like uh fat and sugar like in a donut</p>
<p>for example deep fried</p>
<p>um or even barbecued ribs with all that</p>
<p>sugar and that meat that&rsquo;s cooked under</p>
<p>heat you&rsquo;re consuming what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>Advanced glycation end products which</p>
<p>are basically some pretty nasty things</p>
<p>that can do some bad things to your body</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>make you very unhealthy so again if</p>
<p>if somehow Steve you&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re forced to consume sugar and</p>
<p>you have this option of only consuming</p>
<p>sugar it&rsquo;s happened that would be a</p>
<p>better option</p>
<p>all right very good now uh here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that affects roughly half the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s population Bernadette speaking</p>
<p>about it from Facebook what if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>post-menopausal and have no estrogen I</p>
<p>need to increase the estrogen intake</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I question</p>
<p>Well normally during menopause you have</p>
<p>a backup organ that makes estrogen</p>
<p>progesterone and all the other hormones</p>
<p>that the ovaries</p>
<p>were supposed to make but they went in</p>
<p>retirement and um that&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>adrenal glands so you don&rsquo;t really need</p>
<p>the same amount of hormones but you need</p>
<p>the normal amount that your adrenal</p>
<p>produces and so the goal of menopause is</p>
<p>to definitely support the adrenals as</p>
<p>much as you can and how do you do that</p>
<p>well DHEA is a good raw material that</p>
<p>you can take just to build up the</p>
<p>precursor for these hormones and also</p>
<p>make sure you don&rsquo;t go on a low</p>
<p>cholesterol diet because</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re on a Statin or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking low</p>
<p>um like you&rsquo;re on low fats you have to</p>
<p>realize that cholesterol is the raw</p>
<p>material to help you build up these sex</p>
<p>hormones and so you&rsquo;re going to end up</p>
<p>suffering and having a lot of problems</p>
<p>with that so the other last remedy that</p>
<p>is really good</p>
<p>um for post-menopausal women would be</p>
<p>the vitamin E in the form of tocotrenals</p>
<p>simply because the great majority of</p>
<p>vitamin E in your body is stored in the</p>
<p>pituitary and the pituitary regulates</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>not just the adrenals but the ovary as</p>
<p>well so that would be some tips that you</p>
<p>can apply very good Stephanie from Texas</p>
<p>are you with us</p>
<p>yes I am I&rsquo;m here very good well guess</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s your turn to talk to Dr Berg</p>
<p>about your fascinating question one</p>
<p>question of course out in 30 seconds</p>
<p>would be helpful go</p>
<p>okay when I was 30 I had a hysterectomy</p>
<p>as mentioned earlier it was a full-blown</p>
<p>one they took both ovaries uterus</p>
<p>fallopians cervix all of it out and the</p>
<p>doctor prescribed me estradiol because</p>
<p>he said that if I don&rsquo;t take estrogens</p>
<p>that by the time I&rsquo;m 55 my bones my skin</p>
<p>and my joints will be that of an 80 year</p>
<p>old and so I&rsquo;m 37 now</p>
<p>um I had another doctor tell me that I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to take the estrogen and so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just confused as to whether do I</p>
<p>need to take it do I not need to take it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot in the keto world that</p>
<p>estrogen is a fat producing hormone so</p>
<p>is there other things that I could eat</p>
<p>like the sea kilt like you had mentioned</p>
<p>to I don&rsquo;t know I I just do I need to</p>
<p>should I take it or not at my age of 37.</p>
<p>yeah good question I I can&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>one way or another because I&rsquo;m you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a medical doctor however I would</p>
<p>give you some tips to to do some further</p>
<p>research first of all try to find a</p>
<p>naturopathic doctor who knows about you</p>
<p>know testing testing these hormones to</p>
<p>see where you&rsquo;re at because like I said</p>
<p>before like the adrenals are the backup</p>
<p>so if you remove the uterus and the</p>
<p>ovaries well definitely the adrenals are</p>
<p>going to be like in a State of Shock so</p>
<p>you want to support the adrenal because</p>
<p>that can actually give you the</p>
<p>replacement of the estrogen that the</p>
<p>ovaries are not are no longer giving you</p>
<p>that being said</p>
<p>um I I really honestly do not think uh</p>
<p>estradiol is the the best option for</p>
<p>that simple simply because okay so it</p>
<p>might give you some uh estradiol but</p>
<p>then what about the risk the risks</p>
<p>um that come with that you know cancer</p>
<p>risks things like that so there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>some problems</p>
<p>with um taking this estrogen replacement</p>
<p>therapy I mean just look it up but just</p>
<p>write down the list it&rsquo;s just like wow</p>
<p>not good</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>um the last point I&rsquo;m going to bring up</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>um there is two remedies that I used to</p>
<p>recommend for patients who had a</p>
<p>hysterectomy floor hysterectomy in</p>
<p>practice from Standard Process um</p>
<p>eutrophin PMG and over trophin PMG both</p>
<p>of those um actually you&rsquo;d probably feel</p>
<p>a lot better when you take them just</p>
<p>take one of each right before bed</p>
<p>because they tend to</p>
<p>um replace kind of what&rsquo;s missing to a</p>
<p>certain degree not hormone wise but</p>
<p>glandular wise so you might want to try</p>
<p>that as well but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but I think I would focus more on your</p>
<p>adrenals right now more than anything</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>could you say the names one more time</p>
<p>sorry yeah eutrophin PMG and ovitrophin</p>
<p>PMG</p>
<p>all right Stephanie go get them</p>
<p>uh and speaking of going and getting</p>
<p>them our audience fell flat on the first</p>
<p>question but then they did brilliantly</p>
<p>on the next two and this one&rsquo;s a true</p>
<p>falcer so you have a 50 chance of being</p>
<p>brilliant and here it is</p>
<p>okay true or false having</p>
<p>a wrinkle</p>
<p>or a crease on your earlobe is a is a</p>
<p>good indicator</p>
<p>of the prediction of cardiovascular</p>
<p>disease is that true or false everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>running to the bathroom to check I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not uh able to do that yet but I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>certainly do it after the show okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go back to social</p>
<p>media uh Stephanie from Facebook please</p>
<p>share your advice for pulmonary</p>
<p>hypertension herbs supplements what</p>
<p>would you do with that conditions thanks</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s three things I would do if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not already doing them definitely</p>
<p>get on the ketogenic diet which will get</p>
<p>you off some of the carbs because the</p>
<p>carbs tend to create stiffness in the</p>
<p>vascular system</p>
<p>all throughout the entire body</p>
<p>um the other thing I would do is I would</p>
<p>take um</p>
<p>more potassium and eat foods high in</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>that would be the second thing and the</p>
<p>third thing would be vitamin D vitamin D</p>
<p>deficiencies have been known to increase</p>
<p>hypertension in different forms of</p>
<p>hypertension so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>those are the three things that I would</p>
<p>do if I were you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but definitely research them and of</p>
<p>course check with your doctor before</p>
<p>coming off any medication absolutely</p>
<p>okay back to Youtube Jenna asks is</p>
<p>ferrous glutinate a good way to address</p>
<p>low iron levels in a woman I guess</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a much better way and</p>
<p>and it comes from food consuming red</p>
<p>meat or liver or even taking organic</p>
<p>grass-fed liver and pills would be a</p>
<p>really good source</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>supporting an iron deficiency because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get the type of iron that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>absorbable in the body versus a</p>
<p>supplement which you know it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>best bioavailable form of iron</p>
<p>and so um</p>
<p>I think I would get it from a food-based</p>
<p>thing and so and that should solve a lot</p>
<p>of your problems</p>
<p>okay very good uh we have someone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been on before Dora and she&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>Hungary and she&rsquo;s about to unmute</p>
<p>herself and now she&rsquo;s on with Dr Berg go</p>
<p>ahead Dora with your one question please</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>yes perfectly</p>
<p>okay hello</p>
<p>so basically my question is I have a low</p>
<p>thyroid level and I have been taking</p>
<p>medicine called athroxine for five years</p>
<p>because it was very very bad but my real</p>
<p>body problem started when I was about</p>
<p>eight years old and I started with this</p>
<p>excessive yawning and cannot get best</p>
<p>feeling and also digestion problem and</p>
<p>bloating and gas everything and now at</p>
<p>that moment I have these symptoms and</p>
<p>also I have this a smaller gallblador</p>
<p>polyp and also I have a bit high</p>
<p>cholesterol and I also have this uh what</p>
<p>is it a when I eat something I feel</p>
<p>something reflux or something and my</p>
<p>question is that um</p>
<p>I watched a lot of your videos and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very very good and I started to Kettle</p>
<p>for keto diet and fasting for two months</p>
<p>ago and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s very good and I</p>
<p>also take many of your supplements uh</p>
<p>but my question is that this excessive</p>
<p>yawning cannot get breastfeeding will</p>
<p>just be handled during I do the keto</p>
<p>diet or what should I take and the other</p>
<p>question how should I stop the astroxy</p>
<p>into medicine and replace with something</p>
<p>healthy supplements so this is my</p>
<p>breakfast okay question one question are</p>
<p>you taking any c-calp or iodine right</p>
<p>now c-cap your c-cap okay I think this</p>
<p>and yeah I think also this and many</p>
<p>others so it&rsquo;s very very good and it</p>
<p>saved my life but I need yeah more</p>
<p>suggestion so as far as the getting off</p>
<p>the medication of course I&rsquo;m not the</p>
<p>person to ask that question you have to</p>
<p>make a transition with some help from</p>
<p>another doctor to make a transition</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always this slow</p>
<p>transition</p>
<p>um but um I will say this that the uh if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking CCAP the iodine is going</p>
<p>to support the thyroid now if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s involved c-cap also has</p>
<p>selenium</p>
<p>um so that is going to help you because</p>
<p>now what&rsquo;s going to happen you have</p>
<p>better thyroid function which is going</p>
<p>to help better cholesterol</p>
<p>function more bile better digestion I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you if you have if you have high</p>
<p>cholesterol or you have digestive issues</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t fix the thyroid</p>
<p>and then you get your blood tests and</p>
<p>and they start treating the cholesterol</p>
<p>but not the real cause which is a slow</p>
<p>thyroid oh my gosh you just keep going</p>
<p>around and around and around</p>
<p>um but I think you&rsquo;re on the right track</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one more thing I would recommend</p>
<p>that is very effective to help um</p>
<p>from the pituitary angle uh the control</p>
<p>over your thyroid and that is something</p>
<p>called myo and nasitol</p>
<p>type of B vitamin it&rsquo;s really good for a</p>
<p>lot of things but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>um helping you control that thyroid</p>
<p>stimulating hormone which is usually</p>
<p>um high if you have a hypothyroid</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend and probably that lump in the</p>
<p>throat could be just maybe a little</p>
<p>internal swelling of the thyroid on the</p>
<p>esophagus possibly that&rsquo;s great all</p>
<p>right well listen thank you so much</p>
<p>Adora we appreciate it uh and really</p>
<p>nice to have you back representing</p>
<p>Hungary so well uh let&rsquo;s see we will now</p>
<p>oh wait a minute Dora let me ask you a</p>
<p>question did you have one more thought I</p>
<p>heard you trying to say something go</p>
<p>ahead yeah so because this</p>
<p>active yawning gun cannot breastfeeding</p>
<p>I have this whole of my life and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very bad and this is uh my main problem</p>
<p>basically but I want to handle and this</p>
<p>will be handled during the keto diet or</p>
<p>what do you suggest for that I I I I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know but I I will say um</p>
<p>there could be a couple reasons for this</p>
<p>yawning okay</p>
<p>um but I go beyond just being tired</p>
<p>which I that doesn&rsquo;t sound like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very tired but</p>
<p>um the that can also occur if your pH is</p>
<p>off</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um what might be interesting is just to</p>
<p>experiment like</p>
<p>take a day and just start consuming</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar through the day and</p>
<p>see if that improves your yawning and</p>
<p>then the next day take a little baking</p>
<p>soda with water maybe a little like an</p>
<p>eighth of a teaspoon in water take it a</p>
<p>few times a day and see which improves</p>
<p>your yawning and that that&rsquo;ll kind of</p>
<p>indirectly give you an idea is it are</p>
<p>you too alkaline or are you too acid</p>
<p>um both versions can affect</p>
<p>your breathing and oxygen levels so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like for example if you&rsquo;re more acidic</p>
<p>you know this could be yawning or maybe</p>
<p>a sign frequently type situation a gasp</p>
<p>for breath that looks kind of like a</p>
<p>yawning situation but if you have</p>
<p>alkalinity you can also have a different</p>
<p>type of breathing which could affect</p>
<p>that so that&rsquo;s one little tip but um</p>
<p>but I will um I would suggest just</p>
<p>instead of focusing on that symptom</p>
<p>just focus on what you&rsquo;re doing like</p>
<p>getting getting your diet corrected</p>
<p>handling the thyroid and then see if</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t just go away because these</p>
<p>things are all connected</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well thank you uh Dora as</p>
<p>always for participating all right doc</p>
<p>now question number four which I&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>everyone looked into true false having a</p>
<p>wrinkle or crease on your earlobe is a</p>
<p>good prediction of cardiovascular</p>
<p>disease how horrible let&rsquo;s see the</p>
<p>audience</p>
<p>um 60 of respondents say it&rsquo;s true and</p>
<p>40 percent say it&rsquo;s nonsense no they</p>
<p>actually said it was false</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually true there&rsquo;s a pretty high</p>
<p>correlation like 71 of the time this is</p>
<p>related to cardiovascular problems</p>
<p>and the reason is because if you think</p>
<p>about it when you have a clogged artery</p>
<p>you start to generate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a lot of collateral circulation these</p>
<p>are additional arteries and veins and</p>
<p>stuff like that but chronic</p>
<p>cardiovascular problems</p>
<p>um decrease the amount of collateral</p>
<p>circulation in your body as well</p>
<p>so you have these collateral uh</p>
<p>blood vessels in the ear too and so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see a loss of that and it starts</p>
<p>to become dehydrated and starts to</p>
<p>wrinkle and shrivel up and if you take a</p>
<p>look at your the opening of your ear and</p>
<p>you go back 45 degrees on your earlobe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a crease and if you have</p>
<p>that you should watch my video that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to release on that because it</p>
<p>could be potentially a problem with the</p>
<p>heart so it&rsquo;s a real simple way of</p>
<p>kind of um a little indicator light that</p>
<p>kind of goes off that maybe I should do</p>
<p>something about my my diet or this or</p>
<p>that right so</p>
<p>now I can just see what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>happen everywhere you go now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be looking at people&rsquo;s earlobes</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t mention my name when you</p>
<p>start diagnosing people on the street</p>
<p>I think you have a cardiovascular</p>
<p>accident based on your earlobe</p>
<p>yes that would get somebody&rsquo;s attention</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s very interesting okay also</p>
<p>interesting is Tierra from Facebook what</p>
<p>do you suggest for the elderly that are</p>
<p>weak and have low energy that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>man I would</p>
<p>I would love to just um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>um see what happens if they just get on</p>
<p>keto get off the carbs and just have</p>
<p>some high Quality Meats and vegetables</p>
<p>and then the apple cider vinegar I think</p>
<p>that that Simplicity of that will go a</p>
<p>long way and I would also recommend just</p>
<p>one meal a day if you&rsquo;re over the age of</p>
<p>50 that&rsquo;s really all you really need is</p>
<p>one meal a day</p>
<p>um now um</p>
<p>unfortunately like assisted living homes</p>
<p>and nursing homes there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>regulation that you have to feed someone</p>
<p>every</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know a few hours something like</p>
<p>that so they got the snacks you have</p>
<p>this you can&rsquo;t let a person go too long</p>
<p>so you so you&rsquo;re not doing fasting so</p>
<p>now we we continue this insulin</p>
<p>resistance which is going to affect the</p>
<p>the cognitive function of that person</p>
<p>and they just go downhill but boy</p>
<p>if I could if I had my um</p>
<p>my option to just do an experiment I</p>
<p>would I would put people um elderly on</p>
<p>one meal a day make sure it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>healthy keto and I bet you anything it</p>
<p>would be miraculous</p>
<p>but unfortunately that&rsquo;s not how they do</p>
<p>it they put it put everyone on a food</p>
<p>pyramid they use institutional foods and</p>
<p>they just kind of go down from there</p>
<p>yuck okay well we&rsquo;ve had a great time</p>
<p>but they were in The Green Room and last</p>
<p>but not least is Margie Cordova and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s going to demonstrate brilliantly</p>
<p>how to ask one question and get it out</p>
<p>in 30 seconds Margie good luck</p>
<p>good morning Dr Berg good morning I</p>
<p>appreciate you having me on your show I</p>
<p>actually I have two questions so maybe</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll let me do that my first one</p>
<p>is my son keeps having a dislocated</p>
<p>shoulder</p>
<p>could be could this be a deficiency in</p>
<p>minerals and and what I wanted to say is</p>
<p>I did recently see your video on the top</p>
<p>mineral deficiency and rotator cuff</p>
<p>repair is this the same thing as a</p>
<p>dislocated shoulder you know I think um</p>
<p>that could be potentially uh a good</p>
<p>thing but what comes to mind you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s trace minerals especially</p>
<p>since what they do to all the proteins</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking about ligaments and</p>
<p>tendons and cartilage</p>
<p>manganese is a really good trace mineral</p>
<p>um for for that</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s probably the first thing that</p>
<p>comes to mind but again</p>
<p>um you know it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to just</p>
<p>just take a good trace mineral uh</p>
<p>product and then see what happens</p>
<p>sometimes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know there could be an old injury to</p>
<p>that area that&rsquo;s creating a loose</p>
<p>ligament or tendon and things like that</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>but I would go after these trace</p>
<p>minerals too and the other thing that</p>
<p>not to Omit is the vitamin D vitamin D</p>
<p>is really good for</p>
<p>muscles</p>
<p>um reducing inflammation and supporting</p>
<p>supporting the absorption of not just</p>
<p>calcium absorption but other minerals in</p>
<p>relationship to the Integrity of joints</p>
<p>and tendons and ligaments okay and by</p>
<p>the way Margie let&rsquo;s get this one out</p>
<p>quick we are running out of time go</p>
<p>ahead with your second brief question</p>
<p>okay my second question is I have this</p>
<p>horrible rash it started on my eye area</p>
<p>which I was told by my doctor that it</p>
<p>was a topic dermatitis and he prescribed</p>
<p>a steroid which I never took then the</p>
<p>rash moved to my neck and other areas of</p>
<p>my body and this has been going on for</p>
<p>two months my guess is that it may be</p>
<p>keto rash or an allergy to hair dye what</p>
<p>can I do about it so you really have to</p>
<p>identify and isolate what did you do</p>
<p>just before this happened and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to give you the big clue so</p>
<p>anything new to the diet or a new hair</p>
<p>dye but I will say if you want if it is</p>
<p>keto rash you just need to take more B</p>
<p>vitamins especially vitamin B2 and that</p>
<p>should clear up if it&rsquo;s a rash</p>
<p>okay riboflavin</p>
<p>um but Steve it&rsquo;s very interesting um I</p>
<p>think uh questions always come into you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just ask one question they have to</p>
<p>have two short questions well I am a</p>
<p>complete talkaholic so I have great</p>
<p>respect for those people that can belt</p>
<p>it out as fast as I ask them to I just</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t shut me up but anyway uh Adora</p>
<p>you Marge excuse me you perform</p>
<p>brilliantly and we appreciate your brief</p>
<p>two questions and we&rsquo;d love to hear back</p>
<p>from you on all your successes okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go knock out uh the final question</p>
<p>this is a real controversy we&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>of recently and there it is Doc</p>
<p>now true or false urethral consumption</p>
<p>has been proven</p>
<p>to increase your risk of getting a heart</p>
<p>attack</p>
<p>this is all over the news so is that</p>
<p>true or false all right I need to climb</p>
<p>on it let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to social</p>
<p>media Fred from Facebook I have the</p>
<p>double whammy of prostate cancer and</p>
<p>hypertension what should I be doing</p>
<p>immediately to address these conditions</p>
<p>uh you should be fasting immediately</p>
<p>prolonged fasting</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m talking like right now that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna help that&rsquo;s going to greatly help</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s other things you need to get</p>
<p>on the healthy version of Keto but with</p>
<p>a lot of cruciferous vegetables uh</p>
<p>including</p>
<p>um some of the micro greens if you could</p>
<p>find a broccoli that&rsquo;s a microgreen or</p>
<p>grow your own that would be the best</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in this these broccoli grains which are</p>
<p>broccoli Sprouts but I would if you can</p>
<p>get them on soil that&rsquo;s even better it</p>
<p>will have the potential to greatly pull</p>
<p>you out of this situation where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>more susceptible to cancer so this</p>
<p>sulforaphane chemical and these broccoli</p>
<p>Sprouts are like or or greens is like 50</p>
<p>to 100 times more than adult broccoli</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been heavily studied I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking like over 2 000 studies so they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do those studies unless</p>
<p>there was a reason</p>
<p>and so again if you consume some of</p>
<p>those it&rsquo;s going to help help you</p>
<p>detoxify help you reduce the risk of</p>
<p>getting cancer and hopefully help you</p>
<p>um not get cancer again if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already had it all right very good well</p>
<p>because the audiences performed so</p>
<p>brilliantly and quickly we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have a social media Marathon until the</p>
<p>end of the hour so let&rsquo;s ask uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see I missed it oh yes Diane from</p>
<p>Facebook what can I do to help raise my</p>
<p>hemoglobin levels is that important doc</p>
<p>slightly if you want to up you want</p>
<p>oxygen and you want</p>
<p>energy</p>
<p>um two things</p>
<p>you know you want to get your iron from</p>
<p>animal products animal meat that would</p>
<p>be good and then B12 from animal</p>
<p>products like animal meat or liver that</p>
<p>would be good</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so and you can get liver pills and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll give you the B12 and the iron in</p>
<p>the best form possible there is a</p>
<p>genetic problem that&rsquo;s quite common</p>
<p>involving uh folate and also B12 and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another little thing on the back</p>
<p>of my mind that</p>
<p>that could be the reason why you might</p>
<p>have anemia and so because if you take</p>
<p>the wrong type</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>like uh B9 you take like too much folic</p>
<p>acid or you&rsquo;re taking the wrong type of</p>
<p>B12 like</p>
<p>cyanocobolamine which is the synthetic</p>
<p>version uh you&rsquo;re not going to be doing</p>
<p>well you need to take the methyl</p>
<p>versions which is the methylcobolamine</p>
<p>and methyl folate but that&rsquo;s in another</p>
<p>video</p>
<p>um but um that&rsquo;s what I would do all</p>
<p>right here&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s big controversy the</p>
<p>question was a true false sir</p>
<p>erythritol consumption has been proven</p>
<p>to increase your risk of getting a heart</p>
<p>attack and 75 percent of our respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s false and 25 percent I I</p>
<p>suppose are swearing off erythritol</p>
<p>because they say it&rsquo;s horrifyingly true</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with that doc</p>
<p>well there was a there was a study that</p>
<p>was done</p>
<p>which it sounds like a more like a hit</p>
<p>job on erythritol because here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing the the on the knee on the media</p>
<p>you see all these oh yeah now erythritol</p>
<p>is now linked to can uh to heart attacks</p>
<p>well if you actually read the study</p>
<p>uh it wasn&rsquo;t on the consumption of</p>
<p>erythritol</p>
<p>it was on erythritol in the blood</p>
<p>and of course they don&rsquo;t tell you this</p>
<p>but your body will make erythritol out</p>
<p>of sugar</p>
<p>as in high carb diets diabetes</p>
<p>kidney disease liver disease</p>
<p>if you have belly fat you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>probably have more respiratory because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating too many carbs</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t tell you that</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t also tell you that if you</p>
<p>look at additional studies in erythritol</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s considered an antioxidant it</p>
<p>actually helps your blood sugars it</p>
<p>helps insulin become more sensitive</p>
<p>it helps support the endothelial layer</p>
<p>in the inside of your arteries</p>
<p>so how can this make sense</p>
<p>why does why does a person that needs</p>
<p>more sugar in their diet</p>
<p>have more erythritol maybe because the</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>is um using Risperdal as an antioxidant</p>
<p>to protect the damage the collateral</p>
<p>damage from the high sugar</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not the bad guy after all it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not the thing that&rsquo;s associated with</p>
<p>heart attacks so again</p>
<p>um you have to be able to think with the</p>
<p>data and understand it and uh</p>
<p>I think that makes the most sense as far</p>
<p>as the data I release a video on that</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>um probably next week you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>um another study that they did that</p>
<p>shows that keto has now been shown to</p>
<p>cause early early death</p>
<p>and of course if you actually read the</p>
<p>study it&rsquo;s not even a ketogenic diet in</p>
<p>fact there was one that they said</p>
<p>the keto-like diet the keto-like diet</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t say the actual keto diet</p>
<p>well the keto-like diet actually was 25</p>
<p>percent carbohydrates</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if you eat 2 000 calories per day</p>
<p>and 25 of your calories which is 500</p>
<p>calories carbs that&rsquo;s not the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet but it&rsquo;s a keto-like diet right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re just confusing</p>
<p>definitions so again</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely a lot of attacks</p>
<p>against keto merely because it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>and a lot of people are are taking a lot</p>
<p>less medication and they&rsquo;re eating a lot</p>
<p>less processed junk Foods nothing annoys</p>
<p>the Doomsday is more than a healthy diet</p>
<p>that actually works and you can learn</p>
<p>more about that on drberg.com or on his</p>
<p>great app which is for Android and iOS</p>
<p>so you can get a nice organized view of</p>
<p>what you need while you&rsquo;re riding the</p>
<p>bus to work and let&rsquo;s see in Violet why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we wrap up with a very earthy</p>
<p>question Violet from Facebook how can I</p>
<p>fix the pancreas if I have greasy or</p>
<p>floating stools I was taking gallbladder</p>
<p>formula but it gave me diarrhea another</p>
<p>gastrointestinal symptom what would you</p>
<p>suggest</p>
<p>so these greasy stools is usually a</p>
<p>deficiency of lipase or other enzymes to</p>
<p>help you break down fat right in the</p>
<p>pancreas now</p>
<p>also along with that it could be a lack</p>
<p>of bile salts but if you take bile salts</p>
<p>and you have diarrhea it means that you</p>
<p>probably have too much so either you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking too much of the bile salt okay or</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t need it in the first place in</p>
<p>which case you want to support the</p>
<p>pancreas directly with enzymes including</p>
<p>the lipase so that is the solution is</p>
<p>just take a multi-enzyme product that in</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called pancreat I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called pancreatin</p>
<p>pancreatin pancreatic enzymes it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>combination of a lot of different</p>
<p>enzymes that&rsquo;s probably what you need</p>
<p>um and there&rsquo;s many different reasons</p>
<p>why you would need that and I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>videos on that but maybe it&rsquo;s you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need the bowel cells but if you take</p>
<p>bile salts and you get diarrhea that</p>
<p>means you have</p>
<p>either taken too much or you have enough</p>
<p>and you never need it in the first place</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but anyway</p>
<p>on that note I really appreciate the</p>
<p>great questions today and your wonderful</p>
<p>attention and you stayed this long well</p>
<p>done you get the prize of more videos</p>
<p>next week and we will see you next next</p>
<p>uh Friday same time same place have a</p>
<p>great weekend</p>
<p>foreign</p>
