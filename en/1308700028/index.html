    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Our card this week is Anthony Tony Adams, the Ace of Hearts from Utah.</p>
<p>Tony was a rising star in Salt Lake City who had nothing but a bright future ahead of him</p>
<p>in politics.</p>
<p>Until one night in 1978 when someone entered his apartment and viciously attacked him,</p>
<p>leaving behind a still unsolved mystery and complicated questions of motive.</p>
<p>Was Tony&rsquo;s murder a political assassination, a hate crime, or a random attack?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was about 8.30 p.m. on Monday, November 6th, 1978, and a man who we&rsquo;ll call Thomas</p>
<p>and his wife, who we&rsquo;ll refer to as Alison, had just arrived at their friend Tony&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>building.</p>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s place was kind of the hangout hub for lots of people in the area, so Thomas</p>
<p>and Alison had been there plenty of times, but this time was different.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t there to hang out, they were there to check on Tony.</p>
<p>No one had heard from him in a day or two, which was odd, but they hadn&rsquo;t thought much</p>
<p>of it until he missed a super important political rally on Sunday.</p>
<p>You see, Tony was this brilliant 25-year-old guy who was well known for his involvement</p>
<p>in local Salt Lake City politics, and he was a campaign manager for Congressional hopeful</p>
<p>William Hoyle.</p>
<p>Thomas and Alison were also involved with William Hoyle&rsquo;s campaign, so when Tony never</p>
<p>showed up to his rally on Sunday, his friends started to worry.</p>
<p>I mean, this was the weekend before the election, so they knew that Tony wouldn&rsquo;t have missed</p>
<p>that rally for anything.</p>
<p>And their worry only grew as the day crept by and they still hadn&rsquo;t heard from him.</p>
<p>So by the time Monday evening arrived with no word from Tony, Thomas and Alison had a</p>
<p>gut feeling that something was terribly wrong.</p>
<p>When they got to his apartment building, they noticed his van was in the parking lot.</p>
<p>It was unlocked, so Thomas glanced around inside.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t notice anything out of the ordinary, but the fact that his van was there meant</p>
<p>that Tony had to be home.</p>
<p>So Thomas and Alison went inside.</p>
<p>As they approached Tony&rsquo;s apartment, they noticed something odd.</p>
<p>His door was cracked open a few inches.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when Alison&rsquo;s stomach dropped.</p>
<p>Something told her that whatever was on the other side of that door would be something</p>
<p>she could never unsee.</p>
<p>Thomas agreed to go inside the apartment by himself and look around while Alison waited</p>
<p>in the hallway.</p>
<p>When Thomas came barreling back out the door a few minutes later, he frantically told Alison</p>
<p>that they had to call the police now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d found Tony and all he could tell her was that he had some kind of wound in his</p>
<p>chest.</p>
<p>Within minutes of their 911 call, a dozen police officers rushed to Tony&rsquo;s apartment,</p>
<p>and what they found was truly gruesome.</p>
<p>In the bedroom, propped up against a radiator and slumped over a TV stand, was Tony.</p>
<p>He was naked, and his body was covered in blood.</p>
<p>Before police even processed the scene, word started to spread that Tony had been found</p>
<p>murdered.</p>
<p>So news reporters started lining up outside the apartment building.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a 1978 interview local news channel KUTV did with a responding officer the day</p>
<p>Tony was discovered.</p>
<p>The man is obviously dead and he has been for quite some time.</p>
<p>It appears to me his throat was cut.</p>
<p>Not only had Tony&rsquo;s throat been cut, he&rsquo;d been stabbed several times.</p>
<p>And since he&rsquo;d been dead for a while, police had already lost valuable time, so they got</p>
<p>right to work.</p>
<p>They immediately started searching the room for any clues they could find, but the scene</p>
<p>was a lot to take in.</p>
<p>The drawers of Tony&rsquo;s dresser had been pulled out and rifled through, the bedsheets had</p>
<p>been torn off, blood was pooled on the bed and smeared across the wall.</p>
<p>Then on the floor, atop the wadded up bedsheets, police found the possible murder weapon.</p>
<p>A large, wooden-handled butcher knife covered with blood.</p>
<p>Based on his other cutlery, it appeared to be a knife taken right from Tony&rsquo;s own kitchen.</p>
<p>Outside the bedroom, police found even more blood, I mean lots of it.</p>
<p>They found blood on the door jamb in the kitchen, on the front door, and all over the bathroom.</p>
<p>As officers looked around the bathroom, they started to wonder if that&rsquo;s where Tony had</p>
<p>first been attacked.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>The bathtub had a ring of blood around the inside of it, and there was a big gouge on</p>
<p>the wall above a bloody handprint.</p>
<p>Still not sure exactly what happened, officers definitely thought it looked as if there had</p>
<p>been a violent struggle in the bathroom.</p>
<p>They even wondered if Tony had been taking a bath when his killer first struck, since</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t wearing any clothes.</p>
<p>But then they noticed something else.</p>
<p>There was stuff floating in the bloody water in the tub, some pieces of clothing, and what</p>
<p>looked like the contents of Tony&rsquo;s wallet.</p>
<p>Our reporting team went to Salt Lake City and interviewed Kara Porter, the co-founder</p>
<p>of the Utah Cold Case Coalition, and she said that the stuff from inside Tony&rsquo;s wallet</p>
<p>was all accounted for in this bathtub, except for one thing.</p>
<p>He had just gotten paid, and he had deposited his check.</p>
<p>He had made a withdrawal of some cash.</p>
<p>They found some receipts of some stores that he had spent the money.</p>
<p>So they did some math and believed he maybe should have had $30 cash on him.</p>
<p>Now that assumes he didn&rsquo;t go buy groceries.</p>
<p>We used cash a lot more often in the 70s than they do now.</p>
<p>So they thought maybe somebody had stolen $30 just because he didn&rsquo;t have receipts for</p>
<p>the remaining $30.</p>
<p>In 1978, that amount of cash had the purchasing power of about $130 today.</p>
<p>Obviously, no amount is worth killing over.</p>
<p>But it was enough that at the time, police at least pondered robbery as a motive in the</p>
<p>beginning.</p>
<p>But other than the money, nothing seemed to be missing from the apartment.</p>
<p>Sure, everything had been ransacked, drawers had been rifled through, but it seemed like</p>
<p>everything was accounted for besides that $30.</p>
<p>So police continued collecting evidence.</p>
<p>And as they did, detectives got major deja vu, because they had just been at that exact</p>
<p>apartment complex building less than a year before, investigating an entirely different</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>In November 1977, a 16-year-old girl was found dead in her bathtub at Tony&rsquo;s apartment complex.</p>
<p>According to KUTV, Sharon Schulmeier had been sexually assaulted and strangled.</p>
<p>Now, Sharon&rsquo;s murder hadn&rsquo;t been solved yet.</p>
<p>But despite the fact that they both lived in the same complex, and she was found in</p>
<p>a bathtub and Tony was thought to have maybe been taking a bath, police were pretty adamant</p>
<p>from the get-go that there was no connection between the two killings.</p>
<p>Now maybe it was the fact that Tony had been stabbed and Sharon had been strangled, or</p>
<p>that the victims had nothing in common besides where they lived.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not entirely clear.</p>
<p>But it seems like detectives didn&rsquo;t want to go too far down that road, and they wanted</p>
<p>to look at other possibilities.</p>
<p>Once police finished processing the crime scene, they got to work right away trying</p>
<p>to figure out what Tony had been up to in the days leading up to his death.</p>
<p>They thumbed through his address book to find friends and acquaintances to call.</p>
<p>Finding his little black book at his apartment meant police had pretty much everyone Tony</p>
<p>knew, and they had their phone numbers right at their fingertips.</p>
<p>So they started dialing.</p>
<p>One person detectives reached was a co-worker of Tony&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They worked together at Utah Transit Authority, or UTA, both as bus drivers.</p>
<p>The co-worker said that the last time he saw Tony was the morning of November 3rd, which</p>
<p>was the Friday before his body was found.</p>
<p>Another co-worker said that Friday was the last time he saw Tony too.</p>
<p>He saw him sometime that evening, though from police reports it&rsquo;s not clear where these</p>
<p>two co-workers saw Tony last, whether it was at work or somewhere else.</p>
<p>Police also talked to one of Tony&rsquo;s friends who said that the last time they&rsquo;d spoken</p>
<p>with him was November 1st, which was the Wednesday before he was killed.</p>
<p>And what this friend had to say really intrigued police.</p>
<p>They said Tony complained about a quote-unquote lady friend.</p>
<p>He said he&rsquo;d recently gotten into a heated argument with her, whoever her was, but Tony</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really elaborate beyond that.</p>
<p>It seemed like Tony was possibly turning down a relationship of some kind, but it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>super clear.</p>
<p>This same friend said that they tried to call him back that weekend on both Saturday and</p>
<p>Sunday, even on Monday, but there was no answer.</p>
<p>And his friend never got to the bottom of who this lady was or what they were arguing</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>Police talked to another friend of Tony&rsquo;s who&rsquo;d only known him for a few months, and</p>
<p>the last time he saw Tony was either Friday or Saturday night.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t sure, but he was certain about one thing.</p>
<p>The last time he saw Tony, he wasn&rsquo;t alone.</p>
<p>Tony was hanging out with a man who looked to be in his mid-20s, about average height</p>
<p>with long hair, a mustache, and a beard.</p>
<p>It was a loose description, but detectives took it and ran with it.</p>
<p>They canvassed all the bars in the area that Tony was known to hang out at, but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find anyone who could pass for a match.</p>
<p>So police continued making calls.</p>
<p>According to reports, another acquaintance police talked to said that they knew of a</p>
<p>very suspicious man living in Tony&rsquo;s apartment building.</p>
<p>In fact, the guy and Tony even lived on the same floor.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s never clarified in the police report why this man was deemed very suspicious, but</p>
<p>police learned that this man supposedly knew which apartment Tony lived in and that he</p>
<p>was also a bus driver.</p>
<p>But when detectives talked to this suspicious man, he flat out denied knowing Tony or where</p>
<p>he lived.</p>
<p>Police didn&rsquo;t find any of his fingerprints at the scene, but they still wanted to give</p>
<p>him a polygraph just to be safe, and he passed.</p>
<p>So just like that, the man was cleared as a possible suspect.</p>
<p>As the days and hours crept by, more and more tips came trickling in.</p>
<p>But the one that intrigued police most came from a coworker of Tony&rsquo;s who told police</p>
<p>that he knew a man who we&rsquo;ll call Dave, and Dave knew a man who&rsquo;d killed somebody.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s basically saying that he knows somebody who knows somebody who might&rsquo;ve done something.</p>
<p>It was a long shot, but police did end up tracking down this Dave guy just to hear all</p>
<p>of this straight from him.</p>
<p>And Dave said it was true.</p>
<p>There was a man that he knew who&rsquo;d suddenly told him one day that he needed to find $1,200</p>
<p>so he could either pay for a lawyer or skip town because he&rsquo;d just murdered someone.</p>
<p>Of course, detectives&rsquo; ears perked up when they heard this, but there was one small problem.</p>
<p>Dave didn&rsquo;t know how to get in touch with the man who&rsquo;d made this confession, and he</p>
<p>was only able to offer a vague description, 6'3&quot;, 200 pounds, dark hair.</p>
<p>But the police officer who talked with Dave didn&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read from a redacted police report that our journalists obtained.</p>
<p>Now wherever it&rsquo;s redacted, you&rsquo;re just going to hear a noise.</p>
<p>The officer wrote, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is this officer&rsquo;s opinion that Mr. ______ is covering up some sort of business</p>
<p>transaction with ______.</p>
<p>It is also this officer&rsquo;s opinion that Mr. ______ knows who ______ is and is withholding</p>
<p>information,&rsquo; end quote.</p>
<p>The police had to move on.</p>
<p>Every day the murder went unsolved meant another day a vicious killer was roaming the streets.</p>
<p>Police continued making calls and chasing dead-end leads.</p>
<p>Nothing was panning out.</p>
<p>But then on November 9th, three days after Tony&rsquo;s body was found, Detective Ron Millard</p>
<p>decided to pay a visit to Tony&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>Now the scene had already been cleared, but Detective Millard had just been assigned to</p>
<p>the case, and he just wanted to go over everything once more, quadruple check that the other</p>
<p>detectives hadn&rsquo;t missed anything.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>They had.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d missed something big.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Kara Porter again.</p>
<p>She told us what Detective Millard found in Tony&rsquo;s apartment all these days later as</p>
<p>he walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p>At that time, the reporting officer observed a bloody fingerprint on the drawer next to</p>
<p>the sink in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Upon checking the contents of this drawer, another blood spot was observed in the bottom</p>
<p>of the drawer under several kitchen utensils.</p>
<p>But what he saw at the bottom of the drawer wasn&rsquo;t just a blood spot.</p>
<p>It was a bloody knife, a second knife that police had just completely missed.</p>
<p>After reviewing this case, this is what I keep getting hung up on.</p>
<p>If Detective Millard hadn&rsquo;t gone back to Tony&rsquo;s apartment on November 9th, would that</p>
<p>knife have just never been found?</p>
<p>I mean, the scene had already been cleared, so I have to think the answer is yes.</p>
<p>If he hadn&rsquo;t gone to double check things, no one would have even considered that a second</p>
<p>knife ever existed.</p>
<p>After finding this second knife and the bloody fingerprint, Detective Millard called a sergeant</p>
<p>with the crime lab to the scene.</p>
<p>According to the police reports, the sergeant processed the inside of the drawer and its</p>
<p>contents for fingerprints, but the results were negative.</p>
<p>As for the bloody fingerprint Detective Millard found on the drawer itself, it&rsquo;s not clear</p>
<p>what was done with that.</p>
<p>The report doesn&rsquo;t specify, but reports do say that the bloody knife was taken into</p>
<p>evidence.</p>
<p>Now, even though the police had found this second knife by a stroke of luck, they still</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t any closer to catching the killer, and rumors were running rampant around the</p>
<p>city.</p>
<p>Plenty of people didn&rsquo;t buy the robbery gone wrong theory because they thought Tony&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder was a carefully planned, targeted assassination, and this wasn&rsquo;t some bogus claim at a left</p>
<p>field.</p>
<p>Obviously, this theory did hold some water because Tony definitely stood out as a target</p>
<p>in Salt Lake City in the 1970s, particularly because of three things.</p>
<p>Tony was an openly gay, black socialist.</p>
<p>To provide some context for what life was like for the gay community in Utah back then,</p>
<p>our reporting team talked with Salt Lake City resident and self-described gay historian</p>
<p>Ben Williams.</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s dedicated a significant amount of his life to researching and documenting LGBTQ</p>
<p>plus history in Utah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s what most would consider an expert, not only on Salt Lake City&rsquo;s gay history,</p>
<p>but also Tony&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Ben and Tony actually had some mutual friends, and he spent countless hours interviewing</p>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s loved ones and documenting his life to keep Tony&rsquo;s memory alive.</p>
<p>Ben was in his 20s when Tony was killed, and he remembers the atmosphere of Salt Lake City</p>
<p>during that time well.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s set the stage.</p>
<p>The year was 1978, Salt Lake City had roughly 600,000 residents, and Ben estimates that</p>
<p>fewer than 100 of those residents publicly acknowledged that they were gay because locals</p>
<p>were still holding tight to the stigma surrounding homosexuality at the time.</p>
<p>And honestly, a lot of people were unwelcoming to anyone who had opposing views or lived</p>
<p>differently than they did.</p>
<p>In fact, it was still illegal in Utah to be a homosexual and you could be arrested.</p>
<p>And so most people kind of, you could lose your job, you&rsquo;d be arrested, you could be</p>
<p>kicked out of your apartment.</p>
<p>And so there was a lot of pressure for most people to kind of stay in the closet at that</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>But Tony was one of the few people in Salt Lake City who refused to stay closeted.</p>
<p>He was active in the gay community, and he even helped organize the state&rsquo;s very first</p>
<p>gay protest in 1977, which was a bold move and props to him.</p>
<p>But even though he was a trailblazer making waves in a conservative city, I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find any threats he&rsquo;d received or anyone who openly hated Tony specifically.</p>
<p>In fact, Tony&rsquo;s friends say that he was a really well-liked and respected guy within</p>
<p>his circles.</p>
<p>He was passionate about topics that were important to him, but he wasn&rsquo;t in-your-face aggressive</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>He just wasn&rsquo;t afraid to shake things up.</p>
<p>Tony was known for writing letters to the editor talking about controversial topics.</p>
<p>We actually have two of those letters that you can read on our website at thedeckpodcast.com.</p>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s letters caused such a stir in the city that readers would actually write back to</p>
<p>him in other letters to the editor trying to argue with him.</p>
<p>If his points hadn&rsquo;t been clear and effective, then people wouldn&rsquo;t be trying to rebut him.</p>
<p>So he did do that.</p>
<p>Tony was also a leader in the Salt Lake City chapter of the Socialist Workers Party.</p>
<p>And like I mentioned earlier, he was the campaign manager for William Hoyle, who was a socialist</p>
<p>running for Congress.</p>
<p>And again, Tony&rsquo;s murder happened the weekend before the election.</p>
<p>So the question is, was Tony&rsquo;s murder a carefully timed political assassination?</p>
<p>Did someone have it out for him for being a socialist in the very conservative state</p>
<p>of Utah?</p>
<p>These assassination and hate crime theories were gathering traction with Tony&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>and friends.</p>
<p>Even his pastor thought Tony had been targeted because he wasn&rsquo;t afraid to depart from</p>
<p>the norm.</p>
<p>But detectives weren&rsquo;t really buying it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t think that Tony&rsquo;s murder was politically motivated or related to his sexual</p>
<p>orientation at all.</p>
<p>And we aren&rsquo;t really sure why police didn&rsquo;t consider this motive more seriously, because</p>
<p>the Salt Lake City Police Department rejected several opportunities to talk to our reporting</p>
<p>team about Tony&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Regardless, it didn&rsquo;t take long for the hate crime theory to hold more weight, because</p>
<p>later that same month, another member of the gay community was murdered.</p>
<p>Doug Coleman, another gay man in Salt Lake City, was found shot to death inside a railroad</p>
<p>car just three weeks after Tony&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Police didn&rsquo;t think Doug was targeted because of his sexual orientation either, but that</p>
<p>was of little comfort to the local gay community.</p>
<p>And their murders, paired with the violence against the gay community across the country</p>
<p>at the time, left Salt Lake City&rsquo;s gay community petrified.</p>
<p>In California, Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to public office, had just</p>
<p>been assassinated.</p>
<p>And there was also a string of murders targeting gay people across California.</p>
<p>Ben told our reporting team that after Tony and Doug&rsquo;s murders, the gay community in</p>
<p>Salt Lake essentially went back into the closet for fear of their lives.</p>
<p>So there was just this kind of climate of fear.</p>
<p>There were serial killers going on in California.</p>
<p>There was gay people were just seen as somebody that if you killed a gay person, you were</p>
<p>doing society a favor at that time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why a lot of people would just kind of, not only for their careers, they stayed</p>
<p>in the closet out of fear.</p>
<p>And especially after Tony Adams&rsquo; death, he was so prominent in the community, so many</p>
<p>people knew of him and his death, that it frightened the leaders that were out at that</p>
<p>time to the point that it took almost four to five years after Tony&rsquo;s death for the gay</p>
<p>community in Salt Lake to recover.</p>
<p>Detectives didn&rsquo;t think Doug and Tony&rsquo;s murders were connected, but they didn&rsquo;t want to totally</p>
<p>dismiss the possibility either.</p>
<p>So once investigators got a suspect in Doug&rsquo;s murder, they took the suspect&rsquo;s photo and</p>
<p>brought it to the leaders of the Socialist Workers Party to see if they recognized the</p>
<p>man or had seen him hanging out with Tony, just in case Tony&rsquo;s murder was connected to</p>
<p>Doug&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But the leaders said that they didn&rsquo;t recognize the man in the picture at all.</p>
<p>So detectives asked for a full list of all party members so they could be interviewed</p>
<p>one by one and shown the picture.</p>
<p>But the leaders didn&rsquo;t like the idea of just handing over the names of everyone in the</p>
<p>party, the very party that was being extremely vocal about Tony&rsquo;s murder, maybe to the point</p>
<p>that it made police uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So instead of handing over all the party members, the leaders proposed a different approach.</p>
<p>They suggested that police give them a copy of the suspect&rsquo;s picture so that they could</p>
<p>show everyone within their party.</p>
<p>This request would protect the members of the Socialist Workers Party, but still would</p>
<p>get the investigators the answers that they were looking for.</p>
<p>But police flat out refused.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t going to budge on wanting that list of names.</p>
<p>And this really rubbed the Socialist Workers Party the wrong way.</p>
<p>In 2018, investigative journalist Eric Peterson wrote a two-part series for the Salt Lake</p>
<p>Tribune in partnership with the Utah Investigative Journalism Project about Tony&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He interviewed a member of the Socialist Workers Party and friend of Tony&rsquo;s named Clemens</p>
<p>Bach.</p>
<p>Clemens remembered the party&rsquo;s interaction with police vividly.</p>
<p>In the article, Eric Peterson wrote, quote,</p>
<p>Bach feared officers armed with a party membership list would show up at people&rsquo;s workplaces</p>
<p>for interviews and get them fired.</p>
<p>To this day, he harbors no doubt about the police&rsquo;s intent, end quote.</p>
<p>By the end of December, the Socialist Workers Party was fed up with how the police were</p>
<p>handling the investigation.</p>
<p>It had been almost two months since Tony was killed, and the investigation had gone nowhere.</p>
<p>They felt that police weren&rsquo;t being open about the investigation and that they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taking Tony&rsquo;s murder seriously.</p>
<p>So party members took matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>They band together and wrote a long letter requesting that the U.S. attorney for Utah</p>
<p>investigate Tony&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>In the letter, Clemens Bach wrote, quote,</p>
<p>The Salt Lake City police are not pursuing this case with the attention which a political</p>
<p>crime of this type would merit.</p>
<p>Conflicting and confusing reports from the police as to physical evidence and the progress</p>
<p>of the investigation raise questions in our minds about the competence of the police</p>
<p>to investigate the murder of a man to whom they were actively hostile, end quote.</p>
<p>And listen, the party&rsquo;s allegation that police were hostile toward Tony wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>baseless accusation, because just a few months before his murder, Tony had been arrested</p>
<p>for solicitation, and his arrest turned out to be quite controversial.</p>
<p>According to reports, here&rsquo;s what police said happened.</p>
<p>They stumbled upon Tony&rsquo;s phone number scrawled across a wall in a public restroom,</p>
<p>and they called him posing as a man who was interested in sex.</p>
<p>They say that Tony agreed to meet the man at a local hotel.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not clear if an exchange of money was mentioned during this conversation, but</p>
<p>regardless, when police arrived at the hotel, they arrested Tony and charged him with engaging</p>
<p>in sex work.</p>
<p>But Tony said he was innocent, and many of his friends thought that he was targeted just</p>
<p>because he was an openly gay man.</p>
<p>The Socialist Workers Party even published an article in their newsletter, The Militant,</p>
<p>alleging that Tony had been framed, and police were trying to bully him into spying on other</p>
<p>party members and anyone in the gay community.</p>
<p>But even if Tony did write his number on that bathroom wall, Ben Williams said there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good chance that it wasn&rsquo;t in an effort to find sex work.</p>
<p>Well, in the 1970s, there were no grinders or anything like that to help people connect</p>
<p>to data for sexual partners and things like that.</p>
<p>But a lot of people did write their numbers on bathroom walls or in stalls to basically</p>
<p>hook up with other people.</p>
<p>Because Tony wouldn&rsquo;t plead guilty to the prostitution charge, he was scheduled to go</p>
<p>to court.</p>
<p>But for an unknown reason, the case was dismissed at the last minute, just a few days before</p>
<p>the court hearing and less than a week before his murder.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t just Tony that police were accused of being hostile toward.</p>
<p>It was the entire gay community.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t go to the police for protection.</p>
<p>The police was seen as the enemy to gay people at that time.</p>
<p>So nobody reported any kind of bashing or being hit or anything that was going on, because</p>
<p>for one thing, it might be reported in the newspapers and you&rsquo;d lose your job.</p>
<p>But the police weren&rsquo;t really interested in investigating.</p>
<p>And it seems like the gay community&rsquo;s fears really weren&rsquo;t unfounded.</p>
<p>Police were rumored to have joked with each other about Tony&rsquo;s murder and used offensive</p>
<p>slurs when talking about him.</p>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s brother said police even used an anti-gay slur in front of him, referring to Tony.</p>
<p>And the name-calling didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>Ben Williams told us that a closeted police officer later came forward with an infuriating</p>
<p>story about his fellow officers.</p>
<p>They said that when Tony Adams was murdered, they used three real disparaging terms to</p>
<p>describe Tony Adams, you know, using the word, the N-word for him, calling him a communist</p>
<p>and calling him a queer and basically saying three strikes and you&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>Like they were laughing about the fact that, you know, that he was, you know, kind of like</p>
<p>a worthless person.</p>
<p>The days and weeks and months started passing by with no tips and no new leads.</p>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s case grew colder and colder, and the buzz surrounding his murder seemed to wear off.</p>
<p>That is until January 1981, more than two years after Tony was killed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the Socialist Workers Party received an alarming message.</p>
<p>On January 19th, according to reporting by the Daily Herald, the state headquarters of</p>
<p>the Socialist Workers Party was vandalized.</p>
<p>There were broken windows, a shattered glass door, and a note.</p>
<p>The note read, quote, death to the traitor communists, race mixers, and black rioters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for some good old fashioned American justice, end quote.</p>
<p>But the note didn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>Next to this threatening statement was a picture of a lynching.</p>
<p>Obviously, this was deeply unsettling to party members, especially in light of Tony&rsquo;s semi-recent</p>
<p>murder that was still unsolved.</p>
<p>But once again, the Socialist Workers Party felt that police weren&rsquo;t taking them seriously.</p>
<p>In the Daily Herald&rsquo;s article, William Hoyle is quoted as saying,</p>
<p>the police claim this is a single act of vandalism and have refused to launch an investigation.</p>
<p>But we consider this a serious act of intimidation, especially since one of our officials was</p>
<p>murdered two years ago, end quote.</p>
<p>But maybe the reason police didn&rsquo;t connect the two crimes is because they had already</p>
<p>settled into their own theories about what happened.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a ton of evidence pointing one way or another, so speculations were a</p>
<p>bit all over the place.</p>
<p>According to Eric Peterson&rsquo;s reporting for the Salt Lake Tribune, one Salt Lake City</p>
<p>detective thought that Tony was killed by someone he&rsquo;d picked up at a bar that weekend.</p>
<p>Maybe that 20-something-year-old man with the mustache that he was seen hanging out</p>
<p>with a couple of days before his body was found.</p>
<p>But police were never able to track that man down or get a better description of him.</p>
<p>So it was a pretty loose theory.</p>
<p>Other detectives believed Tony was targeted for being a supposed sex worker.</p>
<p>But a lot of investigators thought the murder wasn&rsquo;t premeditated at all.</p>
<p>Because if it had been planned, why didn&rsquo;t the killer bring their own weapon?</p>
<p>Another detective thought it was a crime of opportunity.</p>
<p>Maybe some quote-unquote street kids wanting to make a quick buck.</p>
<p>For years, a few mediocre theories were all police had.</p>
<p>And theories aren&rsquo;t enough to solve a case.</p>
<p>So once tips stopped trickling in, the investigation came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>And it stayed that way for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Until one day, when police made a discovery that proved one of these theories wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so far-fetched after all.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Salt Lake City Police Department decided to do a cold case review of Anthony&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>Part of this process involved submitting the fingerprints found in Anthony&rsquo;s apartment</p>
<p>in 1978 to a database that didn&rsquo;t exist in the 70s.</p>
<p>It was called the Automated Fingerprint Identification System, also known as APHIS.</p>
<p>And one of those fingerprints that they submitted got a match that they hadn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>A fingerprint lifted from Tony&rsquo;s TV matched a woman named Mickey Henson.</p>
<p>Now Mickey&rsquo;s name hadn&rsquo;t come up at all over the course of the decades-long investigation.</p>
<p>Not as a friend or acquaintance, not as a suspect.</p>
<p>So why was her fingerprint found at Tony&rsquo;s apartment?</p>
<p>Was she possibly the killer that police had been looking for all these years?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>By the time police matched the fingerprint to Mickey, she was already dead.</p>
<p>She died in 2004 from lupus, according to a case document filed by the Department of</p>
<p>Justice.</p>
<p>But even though their brand new possible suspect was long gone, investigators still wanted</p>
<p>answers.</p>
<p>So they tracked down Mickey&rsquo;s friends and family to find out why she would have been</p>
<p>at Tony&rsquo;s apartment in 1978, and to find out if she had it in her to kill him.</p>
<p>Police learned that Mickey would have been just 16 years old and living in Salt Lake</p>
<p>City at the time of Tony&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>A friend of hers from that time said that even though she was just a teenager, Mickey</p>
<p>had already lived a turbulent life.</p>
<p>She ran away from home when she was just 11 years old and started running with a rough</p>
<p>crowd and hanging out with other kids who were into hard drugs and robbery.</p>
<p>This friend police interviewed used the words wild and violent to describe 16-year-old Mickey.</p>
<p>And an ex-boyfriend said that Mickey definitely had a violent side.</p>
<p>Once during a particularly heated argument, he said that Mickey went as far as brandishing</p>
<p>a butcher knife and threatening to kill him.</p>
<p>Mickey&rsquo;s violent streak wasn&rsquo;t the only reason police saw her as a promising suspect.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, Mickey was known to have an extreme hatred of gay people.</p>
<p>She was even suspected of associating with a group known for specifically targeting and</p>
<p>robbing gay people.</p>
<p>Now Mickey&rsquo;s sister actually disputed that claim, that Mickey was homophobic when she</p>
<p>was interviewed for the Salt Lake Tribune article.</p>
<p>The sister said that Mickey herself was bisexual, and she even had a girlfriend at the time</p>
<p>of Tony&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>But the LGBTQ plus community wasn&rsquo;t the only marginalized group Mickey was rumored</p>
<p>to despise.</p>
<p>She was known to be viciously racist, specifically toward black people.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, Mickey&rsquo;s friend was asked if Mickey would have ever been associated</p>
<p>with a black person.</p>
<p>Her response was an emphatic no.</p>
<p>Mickey only looked more suspicious when investigators learned that she was briefly acquainted with</p>
<p>none other than Joseph Paul Franklin, an infamous serial killer and self-proclaimed</p>
<p>white supremacist who targeted people who were black, biracial, or Jewish.</p>
<p>He went on a killing spree between 1977 and 1980 and murdered at least 15 people.</p>
<p>But the stack of suspicion against Mickey didn&rsquo;t even stop there.</p>
<p>Much later in her life, when Mickey was super sick and convinced she would die at any moment,</p>
<p>a friend came to visit her.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, during that visit, Mickey said something alarming.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, she blurted out, quote, I did something really, really, really bad,</p>
<p>end quote.</p>
<p>But then she just stopped talking.</p>
<p>The friend said that Mickey never did elaborate on what she was talking about, but the friend</p>
<p>got the feeling that it was the start of a confession.</p>
<p>In 2012, Mickey was officially named a person of interest in Tony&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s as far as things have gotten.</p>
<p>I mean, Mickey&rsquo;s dead and the only evidence against her is circumstantial.</p>
<p>Even the fingerprint, the most damning evidence against her could potentially be explained</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>If Mickey was bi and a member of the gay community, she may have gone to Tony&rsquo;s apartment at</p>
<p>one point to just hang out.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, Tony&rsquo;s place was kind of the hangout spot for many people, especially</p>
<p>those in the gay community.</p>
<p>So since it was far too late for a confession and no eyewitnesses were coming forward putting</p>
<p>Mickey at Tony&rsquo;s apartment the weekend of his murder, the case went cold again.</p>
<p>But then six years later in 2018, the Utah Investigative Journalism Project dove headfirst</p>
<p>into Tony&rsquo;s murder and brought new life to the case.</p>
<p>They interviewed law enforcement, scoured public records, you name it.</p>
<p>And some of the information they uncovered was jaw dropping.</p>
<p>Eric Peterson&rsquo;s two-part series for the Salt Lake Tribune details their research findings,</p>
<p>and you should definitely check out those articles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to link to them in the blog post for this episode, which you can find on our</p>
<p>website.</p>
<p>Anyway, as police were being interviewed by the Utah Investigative Journalism Project</p>
<p>and going back over Tony&rsquo;s case with a fine tooth comb, they realized something very important</p>
<p>was missing, the murder weapon.</p>
<p>You heard me right.</p>
<p>The Butcher Knife Police had initially found the day Tony&rsquo;s body was discovered had vanished.</p>
<p>But the Salt Lake City Police Department said that the knife wasn&rsquo;t in their possession</p>
<p>when it vanished.</p>
<p>They said that the lab they sent it to must have lost it.</p>
<p>So bit of context here.</p>
<p>Back in the 70s, Utah&rsquo;s state crime lab hadn&rsquo;t opened yet.</p>
<p>So police supposedly would send their evidence to the University of Utah to be tested at</p>
<p>the Center for Human Toxicology.</p>
<p>So essentially police were saying it wasn&rsquo;t their fault.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t have lost the murder weapon because it hadn&rsquo;t been in their possession</p>
<p>since they&rsquo;d sent it to the university.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where things get really weird.</p>
<p>The Center for Human Toxicology&rsquo;s director at the time of Tony&rsquo;s murder, Brian Finkel,</p>
<p>said that the allegation that his lab lost the evidence was preposterous.</p>
<p>It literally wasn&rsquo;t possible.</p>
<p>Not because his lab had some immaculate organization system or anything, but because the lab did</p>
<p>not handle physical evidence.</p>
<p>Brian Finkel told reporter Eric Peterson, quote, no, no, we wouldn&rsquo;t do anything with</p>
<p>physical evidence.</p>
<p>We dealt strictly with toxicology, end quote.</p>
<p>So basically Brian was saying there&rsquo;s no way they ever took the murder weapon in the</p>
<p>first place because this lab only dealt with swabs to test for things like alcohol or drugs</p>
<p>or poison, never physical evidence.</p>
<p>Utah&rsquo;s chief medical examiner at the time of Tony&rsquo;s killing said, Brian&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The university&rsquo;s Center for Human Toxicology would have never accepted physical evidence</p>
<p>like a knife.</p>
<p>And according to Eric Peterson&rsquo;s article, the police department now admits that they</p>
<p>have no idea if the university&rsquo;s lab lost evidence.</p>
<p>So the million dollar question that no one can seem to answer is where is the knife that</p>
<p>killed Anthony Adams?</p>
<p>How do you lose a bloody butcher knife?</p>
<p>And you must be thinking like, oh, there must have been some clerical error or horrible</p>
<p>misunderstanding that led to the murder weapons disappearance.</p>
<p>But wait till you hear this.</p>
<p>A spokesperson told Eric Peterson there could be other cases also missing evidence, but</p>
<p>the department doesn&rsquo;t know how many cases because they don&rsquo;t have the manpower to</p>
<p>do a complete inventory of all of the evidence from their cold case files.</p>
<p>So members of the Utah investigative journalism project submitted a records request asking</p>
<p>for the evidence status of the city&rsquo;s cold cases from around the time Tony was killed</p>
<p>from 1978 to 1984.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 17 cases in total.</p>
<p>And police did review those 17 cases as requested.</p>
<p>And the report police generated listed only three of those cases as missing certain pieces</p>
<p>of evidence.</p>
<p>The first was Tony&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>The second, Douglas Coleman, the gay man who was gunned down the same month that Tony was</p>
<p>killed.</p>
<p>And the third was Mona Oliberi, a lesbian who was murdered in April 1979.</p>
<p>Again, missing from Tony&rsquo;s file was the murder weapon and police wouldn&rsquo;t comment</p>
<p>on the status of the second knife.</p>
<p>Missing from Doug&rsquo;s case were some cigarette butts found near his body and missing from</p>
<p>Mona&rsquo;s were fingernail clippings collected from the scene.</p>
<p>Three members of the gay community all killed within months of each other.</p>
<p>Their cases remain unsolved.</p>
<p>And now key evidence was missing in all three.</p>
<p>So was this mere coincidence or was there something more sinister going on?</p>
<p>And the answer to that is something only police would know for sure.</p>
<p>So I want to reiterate that our reporting team did reach out to the Salt Lake City Police</p>
<p>Department back in January, hoping to get some clarity, but they declined our request</p>
<p>for an interview.</p>
<p>We reached out again in April after hearing conflicting information about who discovered</p>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Like police reports say that Tony&rsquo;s two friends from William Hoyle&rsquo;s campaign found</p>
<p>his body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we said at the top of this episode.</p>
<p>But to this day, there are rumors that Tony&rsquo;s boyfriend at the time, a guy named Bill Woodbury,</p>
<p>was actually the one who&rsquo;d found Tony.</p>
<p>So we reached out to the police department for a second time, just asking them to confirm</p>
<p>what we read in the police reports.</p>
<p>And they responded, quote, we have no additional information to release on this matter.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Our efforts with that second query were to simply fact check conflicting information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been reported, but the department wouldn&rsquo;t even entertain our email.</p>
<p>Since we weren&rsquo;t able to talk with police, it&rsquo;s a bit unclear what their theories are</p>
<p>today about what happened the day of Tony&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>It seems like the Mickey Henson robbery theory is the most likely scenario.</p>
<p>But Kara Porter told us that she&rsquo;s not convinced.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s not just a knife.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a knife with a guy who&rsquo;s naked in his bathroom.</p>
<p>To me, that adds another layer that does make it likely that he would have known someone</p>
<p>Because if it was someone who got into the apartment and just wanted to do a quick burglary</p>
<p>thing, you&rsquo;d be thrilled that the guy&rsquo;s taking a bath in the bathroom and you would</p>
<p>just look around and then leave again.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t go looking for the guy.</p>
<p>Because of the way it is, it does seem personal.</p>
<p>It really does.</p>
<p>Tony was a passionate and brilliant young man who dedicated his life to doing what he</p>
<p>could to make the world a better and more accepting place.</p>
<p>But that life was senselessly and violently cut short.</p>
<p>For more than 40 years, questions about what happened to Tony and why have gone unanswered.</p>
<p>His family and friends have never known justice.</p>
<p>But someone out there has the power to change that.</p>
<p>If that person is you, if you have any information about the murder of Anthony Tony Adams, please</p>
<p>speak up.</p>
<p>His family and friends and everyone who knew him deserves closure.</p>
<p>And Tony deserves justice.</p>
<p>You can call the Salt Lake City Police Department at 801-799-3000.</p>
<p>His case number is 1978-86442.</p>
<p>Or you can text TIP-SLCPD to 274637.</p>
