<p>Ôªø[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>all right welcome back everyone we have</p>
<p>a really great show we have a great</p>
<p>lineup today there&rsquo;s a lot of great</p>
<p>questions people from all over the world</p>
<p>are listening in and so if you have a</p>
<p>question go ahead and comment or</p>
<p>question or ask the question through</p>
<p>social media</p>
<p>um anything that I say is definitely not</p>
<p>going to replace your medical care check</p>
<p>with your</p>
<p>competent physician before implementing</p>
<p>any of these things we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>discuss today</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s just Dive Right In Steve</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we go straight to social media we never</p>
<p>want to ignore our great friends on</p>
<p>social media so let me see here what is</p>
<p>today and yes from YouTube I&rsquo;m doing a</p>
<p>five day fast right now and I&rsquo;m a little</p>
<p>confused on the best way to break and</p>
<p>extend it fast because you share your</p>
<p>thoughts</p>
<p>yeah watch my video on it because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of details but in a</p>
<p>thumbnail sketch you don&rsquo;t want to break</p>
<p>it with any carbs any sugar because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that can really be dangerous</p>
<p>because what happens with potassium</p>
<p>being pushed around</p>
<p>um in and out of your blood</p>
<p>um start out with just a small amount of</p>
<p>um food maybe um</p>
<p>maybe a little small little salad or</p>
<p>something maybe a little nuts and then</p>
<p>wait a couple hours and then maybe have</p>
<p>a little bit of um egg</p>
<p>you know then maybe wait a couple hours</p>
<p>and have a little bit more but you want</p>
<p>to kind of gradually go in and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make the mistake that I made</p>
<p>when I first did a prolonged fast I just</p>
<p>pigged out ate a ton of food I was like</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve never eaten before and then I</p>
<p>go oh my goodness that was a big mistake</p>
<p>because your digestive system</p>
<p>is not ready for that much food so ease</p>
<p>into it and then</p>
<p>um watch my video on the specifics</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a little bit more to it</p>
<p>than I just mentioned</p>
<p>terrific okay and here&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question Marcia from YouTube is there a</p>
<p>practical way to measure autophagy</p>
<p>good question</p>
<p>um no there&rsquo;s not going to be any</p>
<p>practical way to measure it other than</p>
<p>the effects that it can create</p>
<p>which is not are not going to show up</p>
<p>immediately they&rsquo;re kind of delayed so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the recite how do</p>
<p>you measure recycling of old damaged</p>
<p>proteins right</p>
<p>you just start looking younger you know</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s going to be so gradual you may</p>
<p>not see a difference right away so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any way to measure it</p>
<p>but we know how to induce it uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of things that can trigger it the</p>
<p>main thing is fasting</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s degrees of autophagy</p>
<p>and um so for example let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to go lower calorie and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lower than a thousand calories per day</p>
<p>you will get some autophagy</p>
<p>um and then you less and less eating</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re at 100 calories a day</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get more autophagy no food you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get even more autophagy so when someone</p>
<p>does fasting and then consumes let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>Bulletproof Coffee right with a good</p>
<p>amount of calories</p>
<p>um I mean it&rsquo;s not like a thousand</p>
<p>calories so they may stop autophagy for</p>
<p>a period of time</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not going to be as bad as</p>
<p>consuming a really big meal with a lot</p>
<p>of protein</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting okay doc uh currently</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on like a three hour window and I</p>
<p>certainly eat more than a thousand</p>
<p>calories in three hours then I have 21</p>
<p>hours is there any autophagy in that</p>
<p>given the fact that I need to yeah there</p>
<p>is a top 50 going on when you start</p>
<p>fasting for that many hours absolutely</p>
<p>um so there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of</p>
<p>benefits and even when you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t have a lot of</p>
<p>autophagy there&rsquo;s a lot of other</p>
<p>benefits that go beyond just the</p>
<p>recycling of old damaged proteins so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things happening</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>for your health</p>
<p>autophagy is one benefit one of the many</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s cool about autophagy is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s nice about that</p>
<p>as it relates to prolonged fasting is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re cleaning up uh damaged</p>
<p>mitochondria which are behind cancer so</p>
<p>like I said before and I&rsquo;ll say it again</p>
<p>the best strategy for overcoming cancer</p>
<p>is to</p>
<p>clean up these uh the actual root cause</p>
<p>of cancer which is damaged mitochondria</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>you know rather than try to um</p>
<p>you know use Force by force let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>some people have this idea that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to use I&rsquo;m just going to destroy</p>
<p>cancer my body I&rsquo;m going to use all the</p>
<p>chemo and all the radiation hey I killed</p>
<p>the cancer but you also killed the</p>
<p>immune system at the same time so um</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not just about using more</p>
<p>Force it&rsquo;s kind of like uh when I was in</p>
<p>wrestling it&rsquo;s not necessarily the</p>
<p>strongest person that always wins you</p>
<p>know you have to have technique you have</p>
<p>to have strategy so</p>
<p>um you have to use uh things that um</p>
<p>leverage you know resources to overcome</p>
<p>these problems very encouraging uh and</p>
<p>people all over the world appear to be</p>
<p>encouraging because here&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>listening uh joining us today from the</p>
<p>UK in Canada Egypt Jamaica Greece Poland</p>
<p>Austria Denmark Croatia Switzerland</p>
<p>Mexico Saudi Arabia India the</p>

<p>these United States so thanks everybody</p>
<p>for tuning in and as always thank you</p>
<p>Terry for his his fingers must be</p>
<p>throbbing after typing all that in uh</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s go right back to Karen this</p>
<p>time from Facebook how long can I take</p>
<p>Mick milk thistle and what are the</p>
<p>benefits</p>
<p>I mean you could take it for a good</p>
<p>amount of time I mean I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a restriction but the benefits</p>
<p>are very unique</p>
<p>um this prickly</p>
<p>um herb or wheat which I have the mole</p>
<p>all all around my backyard</p>
<p>um this milk thistle has this property</p>
<p>of um protecting the liver so if you</p>
<p>were happen to be poisoned by either a</p>
<p>mushroom or a snake I would try to start</p>
<p>chewing on some of this milk thistle</p>
<p>seed because it&rsquo;s the antidote it</p>
<p>protects the liver and so um it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>for people that are alcoholics people</p>
<p>that take Tylenol people that have any</p>
<p>problem with the liver they should take</p>
<p>it and it it can help protect the liver</p>
<p>against things if you&rsquo;re on medication</p>
<p>or you have some chronic problem that</p>
<p>involves the liver you should just take</p>
<p>it as a something to help neutralize the</p>
<p>effects of that toxin I&rsquo;m sorry the</p>
<p>medication</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it does terrific okay let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get to our great questions we&rsquo;ve got one</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about today but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the first one this is</p>
<p>probably exciting as well and Dr Berg</p>
<p>there you go</p>
<p>okay how much actual water does an</p>
<p>average person drink per day</p>
<p>in cups</p>
<p>all right folks dig into that and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to our uh green room as we call it</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>today it&rsquo;s the husband of a very</p>
<p>familiar person that we&rsquo;ve had on</p>
<p>Virginia who&rsquo;s this french-speaking</p>
<p>woman in multilingual and so interesting</p>
<p>but now her husband who&rsquo;s not nearly as</p>
<p>pretty as she is is going to be on with</p>
<p>us and Sir if you would unmute yourself</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got Richard from Pismo Beach go</p>
<p>ahead Richard you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>Richard go ahead if you can hear us good</p>
<p>morning doctor good morning</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on healthy keto and if for</p>
<p>about a year and a half now and on omad</p>
<p>for about three months I lost 45 pounds</p>
<p>I feel great but I was diagnosed with a</p>
<p>hiatal hernia and Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus</p>
<p>over 10 years ago and my question uh</p>
<p>since I have no symptoms since I started</p>
<p>Keto uh will and can these conditions be</p>
<p>healed over time</p>
<p>I believe they can I believe they can of</p>
<p>course when you get into Health Care uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>um negative to bring up the word cure</p>
<p>which is really bizarre because why</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t we can&rsquo;t things be cured</p>
<p>um I guess it&rsquo;s illegal in certain</p>
<p>States so you can&rsquo;t cure anyone but you</p>
<p>can definitely manage the symptoms I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;ve seen that before people have</p>
<p>Hiatal hernias which is a kind of a</p>
<p>physical physical problem because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a weakness within the abdominal</p>
<p>wall there or even the uh the tissue</p>
<p>um right right next to the diaphragm and</p>
<p>all of a sudden they have no more</p>
<p>symptoms so I think it can be resolved</p>
<p>if you have a problem in the future I</p>
<p>think one really uh good thing to do</p>
<p>would be the manual type uh therapy that</p>
<p>I show you in some of the videos to kind</p>
<p>of like push things back in there while</p>
<p>you you stretch back and forth to kind</p>
<p>of manually manipulate it but think</p>
<p>about what happens when you do keto</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re improving insulin resistance</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re improving your ability to absorb</p>
<p>proteins amino acids so you should see</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>um muscle repair more muscle and uh on a</p>
<p>better connective tissue</p>
<p>um because if hernias are just weakness</p>
<p>within a certain</p>
<p>connective tissue or even muscles you</p>
<p>can have weakness within the wall so</p>
<p>um anything you do to strengthen that is</p>
<p>a good thing</p>
<p>well I think you get a little delayed</p>
<p>there but that&rsquo;s great Richard</p>
<p>um I hope that helps and congratulations</p>
<p>on a fantastic</p>
<p>um 40 pound weight loss I&rsquo;m sure that</p>
<p>yeah yeah I have no doubt that Virginia</p>
<p>was lashing him through the whole</p>
<p>process and uh ensuring that he stayed</p>
<p>on task so good for you that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>great couples do for one another so</p>
<p>thanks again and by the way Richard why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you uh you know stay in touch with</p>
<p>us and let us know if the uh Barrett&rsquo;s</p>
<p>esophagus shows Improvement and so on</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always fascinated to find out what</p>
<p>happens after the fact so thanks for</p>
<p>joining us and our best to your wife or</p>
<p>Jenny all right let&rsquo;s see do we have no</p>
<p>answers quite yet on the question so why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go back to social media Charlie</p>
<p>from Facebook I have a dear friend whose</p>
<p>son is suffering from Crohn&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>what foods do you recommend for him</p>
<p>I I would do the basic eating plan that</p>
<p>I recommend to everyone which is the</p>
<p>healthy version of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>which would not include any of those um</p>
<p>those things that are inflammatory like</p>
<p>the uh</p>
<p>um omega-6 oils especially the seed oils</p>
<p>got to be careful of those the canola</p>
<p>the corn the soy cottonseed oil avoid</p>
<p>those uh creates inflammation and of</p>
<p>course all the grains which can</p>
<p>especially the gluten can tear up your</p>
<p>gut and create all sorts of problems</p>
<p>with the gut but</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a really good video to search</p>
<p>out I think it&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>entitled the real cause of bloating you</p>
<p>should watch that and apply that</p>
<p>information because um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dealing with these body</p>
<p>problems you want yes you need to reduce</p>
<p>the symptoms and Colitis is a symptom</p>
<p>and um but the question is why did you</p>
<p>get this in the first place are you</p>
<p>creating enough Health are you on the</p>
<p>right eating plan</p>
<p>um go to drburg.com and just I have it</p>
<p>download you can just download the</p>
<p>eating plan just right there</p>
<p>and so we have the exact details if you</p>
<p>want even more details I do have a book</p>
<p>on it</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>terrific great Council I&rsquo;m sure okay we</p>
<p>have an answer for our first question of</p>
<p>today which asks how much water does the</p>
<p>average person per day drink in cups and</p>
<p>our respondents let&rsquo;s see 65 percent say</p>
<p>eight cups 30 say fewer than eight cups</p>
<p>and five percent are standing out saying</p>
<p>more than eight cups any Winner&rsquo;s doctor</p>
<p>no no winners today ouch</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s the average person only consumes</p>
<p>just slightly more than four cups and I</p>
<p>for my friend in Germany</p>
<p>um Dennis</p>
<p>um that would come out too if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken 236 grams</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t quote me that&rsquo;s what I was</p>
<p>going to say roughly around there but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing um</p>
<p>yes they&rsquo;re drinking a lot of fluids for</p>
<p>sure probably over eight cups of fluid</p>
<p>but the actual</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>glasses of water is only slightly more</p>
<p>than four cups which is fascinating most</p>
<p>of the other fluids include the coffee</p>
<p>the sodas the diet sodas the juice the</p>
<p>alcohol a lot of things that have</p>
<p>caffeine a lot of things that dehydrate</p>
<p>you that are not hydrating at all so um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s interesting and stay tuned for</p>
<p>a more in-depth video on that because um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s this whole push</p>
<p>just to get people to drink more water</p>
<p>but is that really solving the problem</p>
<p>is that really curing the problem well I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s helping a little bit but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not doing a significant</p>
<p>um factor for hydration so I&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>the details on that when you in in a</p>
<p>video</p>
<p>all right well here&rsquo;s some details from</p>
<p>Sharda from Facebook I oh wait a minute</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry let me go back one Sheila from</p>
<p>Facebook I&rsquo;m 63 and cannot lose any</p>
<p>weight even being on omad for several</p>
<p>months on healthy keto help</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things you have a you have</p>
<p>an option for two things okay</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would do a significantly longer fast</p>
<p>okay and I&rsquo;m talking about to do like a</p>
<p>five day fast</p>
<p>um maybe even longer and because</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re not hungry so many</p>
<p>people are like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing omad and they&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>hungry and they have a lot of weight to</p>
<p>lose well so the question is if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not hungry why are you eating your body</p>
<p>is eating itself and it&rsquo;s eating all the</p>
<p>fat so might as well ride the wave take</p>
<p>advantage of that and go longer go five</p>
<p>days take the supplements but um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a nice way to jump start it but the</p>
<p>other thing that I would do in between</p>
<p>if you could do this is do omad every</p>
<p>other day so one meal a day every other</p>
<p>day so you&rsquo;re not eating today but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll eat tomorrow you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>next day you&rsquo;ll eat the next day and so</p>
<p>on some people</p>
<p>they need to do that because</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening inside their body maybe</p>
<p>from something in the past that really</p>
<p>you know cradle a severe insulin</p>
<p>resistance problem</p>
<p>um they need to go to more of an extreme</p>
<p>level I I had a handful of people that I</p>
<p>had to put on that program which finally</p>
<p>helped them and just because things were</p>
<p>just at a snail&rsquo;s pace and so</p>
<p>um if they did that they would they</p>
<p>would get success but</p>
<p>especially if you um if you happen to be</p>
<p>in a situation where you were dieting as</p>
<p>a kid and you were put on a lot of</p>
<p>programs that&rsquo;s always an issue or you</p>
<p>had a lot of stress certain times or you</p>
<p>dieted a lot through your early 20s or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always something in the</p>
<p>background that kind of slows things</p>
<p>down but um that&rsquo;s those are the two</p>
<p>choices do prolonged fasting and or do</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>eat every other day one meal very good</p>
<p>by the way we just spoke about liquids</p>
<p>in a fast should you be on four cups or</p>
<p>something is there any different uh</p>
<p>regime in terms of the amount of fluid</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking during a fast</p>
<p>well I think I think you need you need</p>
<p>to do at least uh two to three liters of</p>
<p>fluid per day uh especially if if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any risk of kidney stones you</p>
<p>know because you want to keep that fluid</p>
<p>enough fluid to the body so on average</p>
<p>uh if we take everything in the</p>
<p>consideration you know and videos I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>say well don&rsquo;t drink unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thirsty well um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of like a</p>
<p>a theory that make I mean that makes</p>
<p>sense because you don&rsquo;t want to over</p>
<p>drink but but you need some fluids so I</p>
<p>would say between two to three would be</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>especially if you exercise you know the</p>
<p>question is um</p>
<p>some people don&rsquo;t crave fluid they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>crave uh water they don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>thirsty but they&rsquo;re craving salt</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>why is that it could be that</p>
<p>um you need more salt than to get more</p>
<p>of a thirst right because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>um when you have more salt in your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s now okay now more balanced so and</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>they they don&rsquo;t have enough volume of</p>
<p>blood and so they might have low blood</p>
<p>pressure is the body going to actually</p>
<p>crave water</p>
<p>maybe not it might crave more salt</p>
<p>because if if they crave more water</p>
<p>and they drink more water it would make</p>
<p>the salt situation worse because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to dilute you so a lot of times um</p>
<p>the body will crave more salt first so</p>
<p>then then you&rsquo;ll drink more water</p>
<p>so that kind of solves the problem right</p>
<p>there all right thank you sir okay next</p>
<p>question please</p>
<p>all right which medical conditions</p>
<p>um wait what medical what medical</p>
<p>condition does olive oil have the</p>
<p>greatest effect on</p>
<p>talking about extra virgin olive oil it</p>
<p>does a lot but what what condition does</p>
<p>it help most</p>
<p>all right dig into it audience uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>Jay from YouTube is it better to take</p>
<p>regular fish oil or is some</p>
<p>omega-369 uh</p>
<p>better for you also what are your</p>
<p>thoughts on flaxseed oil so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple questions yeah flaxseed oil is</p>
<p>not going to give you those omega-3</p>
<p>fatty acids that you need they might</p>
<p>contain a little bit of a precursor ala</p>
<p>but not the um the other ones that you</p>
<p>need so not the active form a better</p>
<p>option uh than even fish oil would be</p>
<p>Cod Liver because Cod Liver not only</p>
<p>will you will give you the benefit of</p>
<p>the Omega-3</p>
<p>but also vitamin A and vitamin D</p>
<p>and so if you think about it uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just something unique about Cod Liver</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>just as it&rsquo;s just more enhancing than</p>
<p>just the other fish oils which is only</p>
<p>the mega-3</p>
<p>all right very good well uh we have got</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see someone else from our green</p>
<p>room and I&rsquo;m gonna go tahina from</p>
<p>Houston simply because it seems to rhyme</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see let me get Hina on Hina</p>
<p>unmute yourself you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg hello</p>
<p>okay my question is uh I have a multiple</p>
<p>autoimmune diseases like I have</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis lupus thyroid</p>
<p>I have H pylori and most of the time my</p>
<p>liver enzymes go elevated</p>
<p>so whenever I try to do the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting I feel super lethargic</p>
<p>and like I cannot do my house chores I</p>
<p>can go to my work I can take care of my</p>
<p>two two years old baby so it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>but I really wanna do something which is</p>
<p>natural to cure myself or at least you</p>
<p>know to feel better</p>
<p>and uh uh I was doing really good but</p>
<p>after I got covered it was</p>
<p>miserable like my condition was</p>
<p>miserable even I can&rsquo;t change the driver</p>
<p>of my baby</p>
<p>so uh I I have this condition for 11</p>
<p>years and I never ever did like took any</p>
<p>steroids or anything but</p>
<p>I was doing all natural and I was</p>
<p>feeling much better</p>
<p>but after the covet I got really sick</p>
<p>and I was on prednazon but my immune</p>
<p>system was so suppressed but that I was</p>
<p>getting sick like every other day like I</p>
<p>had holes or like</p>
<p>a strep throat or something then I</p>
<p>stopped taking it and</p>
<p>my question is mostly like I I lost a</p>
<p>lot of weight because of this immune and</p>
<p>this autoimmune and whenever I try to do</p>
<p>the fasting I lose so much weight</p>
<p>this is the second thing I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>lose any weight I actually want to put</p>
<p>on some some weight</p>
<p>so how I can do that I can eat I cannot</p>
<p>eat gluten I cannot eat mostly like any</p>
<p>greens I cannot eat sell cucumber like</p>
<p>sorry the</p>
<p>broccoli I cannot eat cauliflower well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some good news I have some good</p>
<p>news for you yes so you want some good</p>
<p>news yes are you sitting down right now</p>
<p>yes okay good so you you don&rsquo;t uh</p>
<p>the good news is the on the Keto Plan</p>
<p>the healthy version</p>
<p>there is no grains there is no gluten</p>
<p>this is exciting so you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about that and then you can just</p>
<p>avoid those other vegetables that create</p>
<p>problem I get the feeling though what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening is that um</p>
<p>you might benefit more for from a</p>
<p>carnivore diet because uh it sounds to</p>
<p>me like um if you have an autoimmune</p>
<p>disease there could be also some gut</p>
<p>issues involved right so yeah a lot of</p>
<p>inflammation then that means we should</p>
<p>probably switch to carnivore for a</p>
<p>couple months and then so maybe you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do the fasting but you do a</p>
<p>healthier version of the carnivore but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the other thing that I</p>
<p>would do I would start taking</p>
<p>um daily vitamin D3 at like 40 to 50 000</p>
<p>IUS because that will help drop the</p>
<p>inflammation I would take also butane</p>
<p>hydrochloride because you have H pylori</p>
<p>which is you need acidify the stomach if</p>
<p>you can tolerate unless there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>gastritis in which you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and so I do know what you&rsquo;re up against</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re going to also have to take</p>
<p>high doses of the vitamin B1 I would</p>
<p>probably take a combination of</p>
<p>benphotamine as well as um a natural B1</p>
<p>and just take whatever the dosage says</p>
<p>take you know double or triple of that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;ll actually get your energy</p>
<p>back from the covid situation and I have</p>
<p>videos on that and then you can just</p>
<p>watch this video again just to kind of</p>
<p>write these down because I went really</p>
<p>fast and we have to get through the rest</p>
<p>of the people that are lined up but</p>
<p>those are the things that I think I</p>
<p>would focus on and that would turn</p>
<p>things around for you and then once you</p>
<p>get your strength back then consider</p>
<p>doing longer fasts so it&rsquo;s always a</p>
<p>catch-22</p>
<p>um not wanting to lose weight not having</p>
<p>enough fat to do fasting and if I was in</p>
<p>your situation the only time I would</p>
<p>probably do prolonged fasting is if I</p>
<p>had cancer then I would I would be okay</p>
<p>with getting really really really skinny</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m going to get rid of my cancer I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a better benefit well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well Hina thank you so much</p>
<p>for joining us we appreciate it and as</p>
<p>always we&rsquo;d love to hear back from you</p>
<p>and see that you gained a few pounds and</p>
<p>started uh lifting huge amounts of</p>
<p>weight no I&rsquo;m just kidding whatever that</p>
<p>makes you healthy would be just</p>
<p>absolutely terrific now speaking of</p>
<p>healthy Dr Berg the audience failed the</p>
<p>last</p>
<p>um failed to last quiz question nobody</p>
<p>got it right so let&rsquo;s hope that they</p>
<p>have improved this time and the question</p>
<p>was which medical condition does olive</p>
<p>oil have the greatest effect on and drum</p>
<p>roll please uh 45 of respondents say</p>
<p>olive oil helps with autoimmune disease</p>
<p>uh 25 say skin issues 15 say liver or</p>
<p>the gut issues and finally 10 percent</p>
<p>cardiac issues and five percent wow</p>
<p>Terry thank you says it&rsquo;s with</p>
<p>cholesterol is there any wisdom in any</p>
<p>of those answers</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s definitely a lot of</p>
<p>everyone is right there&rsquo;s all these</p>
<p>benefits I mean for it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>potent anti-inflammatory but most of the</p>
<p>research that I found when I recently</p>
<p>looked back at it related to blood</p>
<p>pressure significant blood pressure</p>
<p>lowering effect so that would relate to</p>
<p>cardio but it also has an anti</p>
<p>thrombosis so it actually helps thin the</p>
<p>blood it&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>antimicrobial anti-cancer so it would be</p>
<p>also great for autoimmune so um you know</p>
<p>I think that um if you&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>extra virgin olive oil I think you</p>
<p>should start doing it put it on your</p>
<p>salad or just take a couple tablespoons</p>
<p>a day because there&rsquo;s some really cool</p>
<p>amazing properties in that olive oil</p>
<p>that I was just like I already knew</p>
<p>about it but not when I</p>
<p>recently researched them like wow I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to be drinking more olive oil</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and I also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called fatora</p>
<p>um what is the name of the one I use</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it down below but I found this</p>
<p>wonderful Farm in Italy that I get my</p>
<p>my oil from because I watched them</p>
<p>cultivate and grow these olives I tested</p>
<p>their soil and I</p>
<p>um I saw what they do to create this I</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s like talk about someone really</p>
<p>taking it to the next level and caring</p>
<p>about uh the quality and so I looked at</p>
<p>their lab results of the some of the</p>
<p>phytonutrients and how they make it I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like okay sign me up I I need to start</p>
<p>or in cases and then using that but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of other great olive oil</p>
<p>out there don&rsquo;t get me wrong from a lot</p>
<p>of different countries so</p>
<p>um the way that you know when you taste</p>
<p>it and it has that nice little</p>
<p>fresh grass taste with that little</p>
<p>irritation in the back of your throat</p>
<p>and then you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s terrific okay let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to social media uh Ernesto from</p>
<p>Facebook is intermittent fasting uh good</p>
<p>for trembling hands</p>
<p>I think I think it is because of the</p>
<p>effects that fasting does on your brain</p>
<p>and um the Tremors</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um mostly happen because there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>type of deficiency in the brain certain</p>
<p>parts of the brain that control like</p>
<p>dopamine and you might have these</p>
<p>resting Tremors and then you do fasting</p>
<p>and now we get this really cool</p>
<p>regenerative fact you actually can grow</p>
<p>your neurons back in your brain when you</p>
<p>do fasting which is mind-blowing that</p>
<p>your body will do that so if you want a</p>
<p>couple more brain cells</p>
<p>um definitely include fasting prolonged</p>
<p>fasting and there&rsquo;s other things too</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>um cold showers and even those ice baths</p>
<p>which I know Steve is I know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>itching to jump into some ice bath or a</p>
<p>cold shower that&rsquo;ll actually really help</p>
<p>um grow your brain back</p>
<p>so wow that&rsquo;s great you hear that Terry</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Hope</p>
<p>poor guy he can&rsquo;t retaliate because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not on the air with me but he&rsquo;ll let me</p>
<p>have it afterwards let&rsquo;s see Stephanie</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>no I&rsquo;m sorry Stephanie I&rsquo;m going to go</p>
<p>to Sarah best supplements to take in the</p>
<p>third trimester of pregnancy I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always so hopeful for people</p>
<p>having babies doc</p>
<p>well you just you just want to you know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna get pregnant might as</p>
<p>well have the healthiest baby possible</p>
<p>right and there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s uh you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to get the cheapest prenatal out there</p>
<p>you want to get something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a whole food concentrate you want to get</p>
<p>something that has um</p>
<p>the uh a good amount and I&rsquo;m not talking</p>
<p>about massive toxic amounts I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>talking about a good amount of vitamin D</p>
<p>omega-3 trace minerals a natural whole</p>
<p>vitamin C complex</p>
<p>um uh something with natural the B</p>
<p>complex so nutritional yeast</p>
<p>um make sure you can have iodine</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so these are all and then I would try to</p>
<p>eat foods that are high in these food uh</p>
<p>these nutrients like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um maybe some you know liver</p>
<p>um some organic grass-fed grass-finished</p>
<p>liver that would be really beneficial</p>
<p>um some shellfish oysters I mean these</p>
<p>would be really good to take to increase</p>
<p>your fertility salmon some wild caught</p>
<p>salmon</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that uh the the health of that child is</p>
<p>dependent on what the mother ate during</p>
<p>the pregnancy and before</p>
<p>um and you can that way the child</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t end up with you know you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taken get braces and dental</p>
<p>malformations and all sorts of you know</p>
<p>you have deficiencies like vitamin D</p>
<p>deficiency can create bowed legs so you</p>
<p>want to take enough vitamin D for sure</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s the form of rickets in</p>
<p>children but and then</p>
<p>and whatever you have to do to</p>
<p>breastfeed or get some help with the</p>
<p>late Jade League that would be very</p>
<p>smart because in the breast milk you</p>
<p>have uh colostrum which will start the</p>
<p>immune system and you have all these</p>
<p>natural antibodies that the mother has</p>
<p>developed through her whole life that</p>
<p>get passed on to this this infant so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually giving this infant</p>
<p>their immune system which is awesome</p>
<p>because if they do if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>breastfeed you don&rsquo;t give them that</p>
<p>immune system they are a lot more sick</p>
<p>more frequently and they have a lot more</p>
<p>allergies and risks for all sorts of</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>wow well uh do what nature says and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see let me find Stephanie probably</p>
<p>was mad at me because I skipped over a</p>
<p>question but it was only due to my</p>
<p>embarrassment of not thinking I could</p>
<p>say this</p>
<p>this phrase but I think I&rsquo;ve got it</p>
<p>Stephanie from YouTube can you please</p>
<p>discuss the benefits of taking</p>
<p>serrapeptase did I say that right</p>
<p>yeah Sarah peptase</p>
<p>um that is a an enzyme from silkworm and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great for fibrotic tissue let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>for example you have some plaquing in</p>
<p>the arteries or you have some Scar</p>
<p>Tissue throughout the body</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been known to help help dissolve</p>
<p>that and help resolve that so it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>for a lot of different conditions but</p>
<p>mainly it&rsquo;s um if you combine that with</p>
<p>tocatrinals which is a type of vitamin</p>
<p>E2 that would be a good good strategy to</p>
<p>help um remove</p>
<p>um extra scar tissue that your body</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>all right</p>
<p>all right back to the green Mirage are</p>
<p>you with us pop on your camera and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to put you on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s give him just a second and he</p>
<p>is very efficient with that there you go</p>
<p>Raj you are on the air with Dr Berg</p>
<p>please unmute yourself</p>
<p>hi doctor good morning hello</p>
<p>oh thank you so much for giving me talk</p>
<p>to you talk with you uh it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m facing uh stomach issues so after</p>
<p>eating food right after eating food uh</p>
<p>after one two hours I&rsquo;m getting severe</p>
<p>stomach pain so I went to hospital they</p>
<p>did uh interest endoscopy MRI ultrasound</p>
<p>avaskar ultrasound and gallbladder test</p>
<p>but they said everything is good but my</p>
<p>bilirubin is always high 2.5 2.6 do you</p>
<p>think what&rsquo;s too high a bilirubin okay</p>
<p>they said we are not sure why it is</p>
<p>increasing but everything looks good so</p>
<p>I went to another hospitals that he</p>
<p>taken all the tests that it endoscopy</p>
<p>and found it could be H pylori and I</p>
<p>took medication for h pylori but still</p>
<p>same thing so I&rsquo;m getting severe pain</p>
<p>like sharp pain sometimes I have to</p>
<p>vomiting after vomiting and then</p>
<p>settling down</p>
<p>so okay yeah I don&rsquo;t know what to do so</p>
<p>okay this is this is what this is what</p>
<p>you do okay</p>
<p>um what you want to do is you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things that I would</p>
<p>recommend and it&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>sometimes to diagnosis unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for it</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a functional test but it&rsquo;s a pH</p>
<p>test the the amount of acid you have the</p>
<p>pH of your stomach like what is the pH I</p>
<p>would bet you anything it&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>between one and three it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>higher it&rsquo;s probably more alkaline and</p>
<p>then when you eat it&rsquo;s just like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna be able to digest and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to cause a lot of stomach pain</p>
<p>right there also you&rsquo;re not going to get</p>
<p>the release of the bile</p>
<p>which means that your bile is going to</p>
<p>be the bile salts are going to be uh</p>
<p>kind of thicker than they should</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um because the calcium will tend to kind</p>
<p>of build up in the in the um little</p>
<p>tubes between your liver and the</p>
<p>gallbladder called Ducks bile ducts so</p>
<p>those will be kind of um jammed up and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of thickened</p>
<p>um bile salts and some of the other</p>
<p>sludge in there they call it just bile</p>
<p>sludge if you took tadka okay tadka an</p>
<p>empty stomach you look it up get it on</p>
<p>Amazon tadka take two of those in the</p>
<p>morning empty stomach and then take two</p>
<p>in the afternoon empty stomach and then</p>
<p>with each meal</p>
<p>take a whole handful I&rsquo;m talking at</p>
<p>least eight the betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>right before you eat and you do that for</p>
<p>several weeks</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll reestablish the pH tend to put</p>
<p>this H pylori back in remission because</p>
<p>over 50 of the population has it but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t become a problem until the pH of</p>
<p>your stomach starts to go up more</p>
<p>alkaline and then now you now you get</p>
<p>the bile problem and then now everything</p>
<p>kind of gets all stuck there and you</p>
<p>have pain so um those are the two things</p>
<p>I would do and I think you&rsquo;ll be quite</p>
<p>pleasantly surprised at the results</p>
<p>the test to diagnose that is it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to do this functional test I don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know what tests they do for thickened</p>
<p>bile</p>
<p>um sludge but you know what you either</p>
<p>go through the test which I think they</p>
<p>might even knock you out and it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>expensive or buy a very inexpensive</p>
<p>bottle of Tucka take it and if the</p>
<p>problem goes away then you know you have</p>
<p>that problem it&rsquo;s a lot cheaper to do it</p>
<p>that way</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see you know I knew you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>ask that let me just write it down so I</p>
<p>can</p>
<p>yeah so it&rsquo;s a t-u-d-c-a</p>
<p>um tug cup</p>
<p>and then the other one is betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride those are the two that you</p>
<p>need to get that&rsquo;s great well I think</p>
<p>Raji might be getting a lot of Vitamin D</p>
<p>naturally because you have these Stripes</p>
<p>of sunlight searing into your face</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s going to be a new trend on</p>
<p>a tick tock and everyone&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>doing that so congratulations you</p>
<p>trendsetter and please do get back with</p>
<p>us after the fact and let us know uh if</p>
<p>things are improving for you so thanks</p>
<p>for hanging in there in the green room</p>
<p>and folks we&rsquo;ve got a couple more there</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t worry we will get to you so Dr</p>
<p>need to take morning and afternoon these</p>
<p>two before</p>
<p>yep okay thank you all right very good I</p>
<p>miss your stripes Taj but that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>right all right let&rsquo;s uh let&rsquo;s move on</p>
<p>to another quiz question and here you go</p>
<p>doc</p>
<p>all right so how long does stress take</p>
<p>to affect your hair loss so</p>
<p>um you know I mean it&rsquo;s a well-known</p>
<p>fact that stress can affect your hair</p>
<p>right so when you go through a</p>
<p>significant amount of stress how long</p>
<p>does it usually take before the air</p>
<p>starts to fall out</p>
<p>all right dig into that audience and you</p>
<p>redeem your last last time after opening</p>
<p>with a complete failure uh you uh you</p>
<p>got the last question right let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>how if you can keep that Trend going all</p>
<p>right Julie from Facebook my gallbladder</p>
<p>was removed over 30 years ago along with</p>
<p>part of my signoid colon how can I stop</p>
<p>my frequent diarrhea ouch</p>
<p>so unfortunately</p>
<p>um what&rsquo;s happening is you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>um too much bile now because when they</p>
<p>remove those structures now we don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>know usually you&rsquo;re not going to have</p>
<p>enough but if you have diarrhea that</p>
<p>means you have too much bowel coming</p>
<p>through there and so there are certain</p>
<p>types of medications that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably going to have to take right now</p>
<p>which are things that slow down the bile</p>
<p>production</p>
<p>and then maybe you could find some</p>
<p>natural thing I haven&rsquo;t researched to</p>
<p>see if there&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>anti-bile supplement out there there</p>
<p>might be but that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on unfortunately you&rsquo;re that have that</p>
<p>situation you just have too much bile</p>
<p>usually it&rsquo;s the opposite um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>another thing that I probably would</p>
<p>recommend that you do just</p>
<p>um who knows what kind of trauma that</p>
<p>created I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s like you do</p>
<p>surgery and maybe they made the hole too</p>
<p>big or too you know but if you could</p>
<p>manually massage underneath the right</p>
<p>rib cage and the left rib cage about an</p>
<p>inch off the midline an inch slower</p>
<p>maybe one or two inches lower and find a</p>
<p>certain point of tenderness on left and</p>
<p>right side and start massaging that that</p>
<p>that just might give you a little more</p>
<p>relief because anytime they do surgery</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of scar tissue</p>
<p>that might develop that if you can</p>
<p>kind of loosen some of that up it can</p>
<p>sometimes help so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you need to do all right</p>
<p>audience well Terry has got your back he</p>
<p>told me stop saying the first quiz</p>
<p>question was a failure more than 30</p>
<p>percent of respondents were correct by</p>
<p>saying fewer than eight cups of water so</p>
<p>my apologies and once again Terry is</p>
<p>listening and he has your back he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to let me get it I&rsquo;m sure you just</p>
<p>you just said that because to make it</p>
<p>was a test to see if he was listening</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s exactly right Terry</p>
<p>congratulations you retain your job by</p>
<p>being attentive okay no actually Terry</p>
<p>could probably fire me so I mean I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>quit picking on him for a while okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see uh so we&rsquo;re waiting for that</p>
<p>quiz question answer and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to gallbladders Paul from</p>
<p>YouTube can you share thoughts on what</p>
<p>might cause gallbladder polyps I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>taking your gallbladder formula for</p>
<p>months</p>
<p>well I think it&rsquo;s the same thing that</p>
<p>might be um causing polyps in the colon</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some uh reason that your body is</p>
<p>trying to consolidate or or wall off</p>
<p>something it could be</p>
<p>you know it could be a microbe could be</p>
<p>some toxin I don&rsquo;t know but what I do</p>
<p>know if you did periodic prolonged</p>
<p>fasting with any polyps whether in the</p>
<p>colon or in the liver and the kidney I</p>
<p>think my thought is that you would</p>
<p>probably see them shrink and hopefully</p>
<p>go away</p>
<p>um so maybe you do like</p>
<p>a three or four day fast</p>
<p>um but that&rsquo;s what I that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>um and then make sure that the food that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating is the correct healthy</p>
<p>version of the ketogenic diet because</p>
<p>ultimately that will help things in the</p>
<p>long run especially with what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>with your liver because the liver is</p>
<p>connected to the gallbladder</p>
<p>sorry okay uh why don&rsquo;t we go all the</p>
<p>way to Antigua or Antigua as Jamila</p>
<p>corrected me and she&rsquo;s got a question</p>
<p>for us she&rsquo;s got kind of a funky video</p>
<p>going there but let&rsquo;s hope we can hear</p>
<p>uh Jamila you&rsquo;re on with Dr bird</p>
<p>okay can you guys hear me yes</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s great okay so Dr Berg</p>
<p>um thanks for having me</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been watching your videos for</p>
<p>maybe a month now uh let me explain to</p>
<p>you real quick because I have a timeline</p>
<p>on the 23rd of August I had to be taken</p>
<p>from work I&rsquo;m an immigration officer I</p>
<p>had to be taken from work to the doctor</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t walk or when I tried to walk</p>
<p>my heartbeat stuff and that was like two</p>
<p>days after my cycle ended and so I was</p>
<p>anemic I found out my blood count was</p>
<p>really low I was told to take try he</p>
<p>make twice a day try he make 600.</p>
<p>and um my heart rate slowed down and</p>
<p>everything started to feel better but</p>
<p>last week Tuesday</p>
<p>I had I my heart rate increased again</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it was just a little bit over 100 uh the</p>
<p>Friday went up the Saturday the same</p>
<p>thing the Sunday last week Monday I</p>
<p>decided to go to the ER</p>
<p>but before going to the ER I took a</p>
<p>thyroid test at a private lab I got back</p>
<p>my my thyroid test</p>
<p>and I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism</p>
<p>on Wednesday</p>
<p>um I have multiple fibroids um one of</p>
<p>them is a kind of big</p>
<p>um I have a cyst</p>
<p>on my ovary</p>
<p>so I was just wondering because I have</p>
<p>all the classic symptoms of</p>
<p>hyperthyroidism I have been trying to</p>
<p>eat the ketoe for two weeks I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m getting all my calories in but I</p>
<p>can tell you that uh at work I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>stressed for the last couple months and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m wondering if it&rsquo;s stress that</p>
<p>triggered off my thyroid I just need</p>
<p>your help as to what I should do to get</p>
<p>this under control</p>
<p>you know you know at the um you I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>guessing it&rsquo;s it probably is Graves</p>
<p>which is an autoimmune hyperthyroid I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>guessing but I don&rsquo;t know for a fact</p>
<p>um you know 90 maybe even the</p>
<p>hypothyroid is um Hashimoto&rsquo;s which is</p>
<p>an autoimmune so what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>interesting to me that um when you go</p>
<p>through stress significant emotional</p>
<p>stress or whatever chronic stress</p>
<p>um a person could go either hyper or</p>
<p>hypo thyroid</p>
<p>with an autoimmune situation which I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s one way or the other I just know</p>
<p>that the immune system is developing</p>
<p>antibodies and it&rsquo;s creating a problem</p>
<p>um so that being said</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a couple things that I would</p>
<p>I would do in addition to</p>
<p>the healthy keto I would do a bit more</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>and I would also do whatever you can to</p>
<p>lower your stress because if it was</p>
<p>triggered by stress then you have to</p>
<p>kind of undo that but isolate</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can</p>
<p>do for reducing stress but then you want</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>not just do things like exercise to</p>
<p>reduce stress but get find out what is</p>
<p>stressing the isolate the main thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s stressing you out</p>
<p>um one thing that I found more than</p>
<p>anything that will probably help you now</p>
<p>is to do things to improve your sleep</p>
<p>which uh because out of all the things</p>
<p>for stress reduction sleep is probably</p>
<p>the the biggest thing so if you have any</p>
<p>sleep problems you know watch my videos</p>
<p>on that uh go</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;ve been having problems sleeping</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m gonna tell you the</p>
<p>honor truth I suffered from anxiety so</p>
<p>you know hearing that I have hyper</p>
<p>I got really sad</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like wow did this really happen to</p>
<p>me and I&rsquo;m just you know I&rsquo;d go to sleep</p>
<p>maybe around eight wake up around 12 and</p>
<p>go back to sleep around three I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know you know I don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>control my answer</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s better than nothing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better than nothing you just have I</p>
<p>think I would take this problem</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>of and just take parts of the problem</p>
<p>and that because it could be very</p>
<p>overwhelming so just work on parts of</p>
<p>the problem that you can do right now</p>
<p>and you keep stripping it down until</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all gone for example right now</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about anything but fixing</p>
<p>your sleep okay okay once then when you</p>
<p>get rid of that you work on the next</p>
<p>thing but</p>
<p>um a couple things for sleep I&rsquo;ll just</p>
<p>mention right now make sure that your</p>
<p>room is on the cool side make sure that</p>
<p>you do some type of low stress exercise</p>
<p>that can make your body tired uh for</p>
<p>example let&rsquo;s say you did some some</p>
<p>weight training or something only work</p>
<p>on one or two muscle groups right so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a real short workout</p>
<p>you you and created some damage on your</p>
<p>body but that actually will help you uh</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um more than just kind of like light</p>
<p>type of exercise like really work one or</p>
<p>two muscle groups and um it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>definitely help you sleep so watch my</p>
<p>videos on on sleep and then</p>
<p>then reevaluate after you do that but um</p>
<p>unfortunately you have a uh your</p>
<p>adrenals probably need some support so</p>
<p>take a lot of B1 nutritional yeast in</p>
<p>this you can do the ashwagandha the</p>
<p>lemon balm tea those are good but I</p>
<p>think B1 is going to help you a lot with</p>
<p>your adrenals okay Jeremiah listen we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running out of time and I appreciate you</p>
<p>coming on with us so please try those</p>
<p>things and get back with us and let us</p>
<p>know how things are going in atigua or</p>
<p>Antigua which I now know how to</p>
<p>pronounce okay so our latest quiz</p>
<p>question number three how long does</p>
<p>stress take to affect hair loss and 35</p>
<p>percent say a week or two thirty percent</p>
<p>say a matter of days 25 say a month or</p>
<p>more and 15 uh wrapped it up with 15</p>
<p>saying more than two months</p>
<p>now this is interesting because a lot of</p>
<p>people that lose their hair</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re wondering what&rsquo;s going on I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve had any stress and then</p>
<p>what they don&rsquo;t realize is there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>huge delay between the time you go</p>
<p>through stress and the time you lose</p>
<p>your hair just because hair grows kind</p>
<p>of slow and we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>one to three months okay after the fat</p>
<p>after a stress so you know with other</p>
<p>things you can kind of see the thing</p>
<p>that happens right before the problem</p>
<p>but with hair loss you got to look</p>
<p>earlier just like in your fingernails if</p>
<p>you see um a problem with your</p>
<p>fingernails let&rsquo;s say you have this</p>
<p>white Speck right in the middle of your</p>
<p>nail which is a zinc deficiency which is</p>
<p>really</p>
<p>a time where you ate too much sugar</p>
<p>and if it&rsquo;s right in the middle of the</p>
<p>nail we know about three months ago</p>
<p>you had a birthday party and you end up</p>
<p>eating the whole cake because it created</p>
<p>a lot of deficiency of Zinc at that</p>
<p>point and then I&rsquo;ll show that little</p>
<p>white dot so sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>um figure these things out because of</p>
<p>the delay time but yeah with your hair</p>
<p>just look three months back and say oh</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s right I had this major stress</p>
<p>event and now it all makes sense so I</p>
<p>will release the video on that shortly</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s an interesting event</p>
<p>that happened I don&rsquo;t know maybe 30</p>
<p>years ago where a gentleman that was</p>
<p>driving a petrol rig a big semi truck it</p>
<p>caught on fire and he escaped it and his</p>
<p>dark hair turned gray within a very</p>
<p>short period and they said that was from</p>
<p>just enormous stress of thinking you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to burn to death so I never forgot</p>
<p>that uh that article okay we&rsquo;ve got two</p>
<p>folks left in the green room and Sarah</p>
<p>from Israel has been trying to get on</p>
<p>the air and is coming back and forth</p>
<p>Sarah I hope we can hear you go ahead</p>
<p>with your question</p>
<p>me yes speak up and let us know what</p>
<p>your question is</p>
<p>my question is how I can do to lower my</p>
<p>Uric acids because it&rsquo;s a little high I</p>
<p>made keto for about a month or a nice</p>
<p>job because I went on vacation and I</p>
<p>went through a blood test and</p>
<p>a uh my uric acid level was</p>
<p>and a little bit my cholesterol yells so</p>
<p>I want to research it because it was</p>
<p>good for me but I don&rsquo;t know where to</p>
<p>start now with these levels</p>
<p>got it okay good question let me answer</p>
<p>that for you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when you do</p>
<p>mainly fasting or intermittent fasting</p>
<p>it is true that the um</p>
<p>the uric acid does go up okay but if you</p>
<p>think about uric acid is not a hundred</p>
<p>percent a Bad Thing uric acid is</p>
<p>a more powerful antioxidant than any</p>
<p>other antioxidant in your blood which is</p>
<p>fascinating so the question is why is</p>
<p>your uric acid going up because your</p>
<p>anti your um antioxidants are going up</p>
<p>and your body&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>um clean things up and protect things</p>
<p>because you have this</p>
<p>um increased</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>counter to oxidative stress so um</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re experiencing a physical</p>
<p>problem like gout I wouldn&rsquo;t be too</p>
<p>other than</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know make sure the amount of protein</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re eating is not excessive</p>
<p>potentially that you know because uric</p>
<p>acid is part of the whole protein</p>
<p>breakdown cycle</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um but when you do go through fasting</p>
<p>there is a spike of uric acid and then</p>
<p>it comes down more and more and more</p>
<p>over time</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re fasting and also</p>
<p>the more your uh the insulin resistance</p>
<p>you have too the more you&rsquo;ll have uric</p>
<p>acid so</p>
<p>anyway I would um if you have gout for</p>
<p>example</p>
<p>um and then that&rsquo;s uh realize that</p>
<p>probably the biggest trigger for that is</p>
<p>the fructose and the fruit and the beer</p>
<p>and the carbs and the sugar and all that</p>
<p>more than other things like protein</p>
<p>um and um so</p>
<p>I watch my videos and gout if you have</p>
<p>that but other than that I think I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be concerned um because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many other benefits you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>experiencing now and I just give it more</p>
<p>time reevaluate it see if your uric acid</p>
<p>does come down over time and just</p>
<p>realize too that the underlying problem</p>
<p>is probably more with your kidney not</p>
<p>being able to regulate this more than</p>
<p>anything else so you know if you keep</p>
<p>doing this your body gets healthy the</p>
<p>kidneys get healthier the liver gets</p>
<p>healthier and then the uric acid gets</p>
<p>healthier all right that&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>thank you so much Sarah I&rsquo;m glad we were</p>
<p>able to finally get your call and we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got one more participant Nancy I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to startle her because she&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>phone right now she&rsquo;s going oh no I got</p>
<p>to get off I got to get off and she did</p>
<p>it successfully and Nancy I hope you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unmuted and you&rsquo;re on the phone with Dr</p>
<p>Berger I hope you were bragging to your</p>
<p>friend about being on the show</p>
<p>I was but unfortunately it was my boss</p>
<p>so he said are you at an appointment I</p>
<p>hear people in the background I said no</p>
<p>no I&rsquo;m waiting to talk to Dr Berg oh boy</p>
<p>let me give you a note no I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if that would work yeah yeah I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;m kind of self-employed it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that big of a deal anyway</p>
<p>um so Dr Berg I&rsquo;ve been following you</p>
<p>for a while now a couple years at least</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I have watched your videos on heartburn</p>
<p>and how to get rid of it and your lemon</p>
<p>acid apple cider vinegar cranberry water</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve you know bought the your</p>
<p>gallbladder formula and the bile salts</p>
<p>and the butane hydrochloride</p>
<p>what happened is I&rsquo;ve been taking</p>
<p>Omeprazole for years not consistently</p>
<p>but I know that it&rsquo;s something I need to</p>
<p>get off of and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so I dropped it and I started doing your</p>
<p>stuff taking the pills drinking the</p>
<p>water every morning consistently got off</p>
<p>my tea instead of tea I would drink your</p>
<p>lemon water</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I still had horrible heartburn</p>
<p>so when does it go away what can I do I</p>
<p>actually got back on the two-week cycle</p>
<p>of Omeprazole because it was I was in so</p>
<p>much pain</p>
<p>what do I do</p>
<p>and how long can I expect</p>
<p>okay so do you have symptoms of acid</p>
<p>reflux that&rsquo;s coming up here or is it</p>
<p>just heartburn in your stomach itself</p>
<p>sometimes both</p>
<p>okay but you do have Gerd</p>
<p>yeah sometimes</p>
<p>okay so this valve that&rsquo;s on the top of</p>
<p>the stomach</p>
<p>is not closing properly and so</p>
<p>um the question is why</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a couple reasons for that</p>
<p>that the most common one is that the you</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t have the acidity that you</p>
<p>need and of course by taking this</p>
<p>medication for such a long period of</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>which actually helps get rid of acid you</p>
<p>probably don&rsquo;t have hardly anything in</p>
<p>there so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re stuck between</p>
<p>a rock and a hard place because it might</p>
<p>not be as easy as just like oh I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>going to get off this and start a</p>
<p>replacement you might have to do a</p>
<p>little bit of both and then give it a</p>
<p>long time because what people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize is to re-establish the normal pH</p>
<p>in the stomach</p>
<p>um sometimes takes months and sometimes</p>
<p>you have to take larger amounts than</p>
<p>um is recommended on the back of label</p>
<p>especially with betaine hydrochloride I</p>
<p>probably would not do two things at once</p>
<p>like I probably wouldn&rsquo;t work on the</p>
<p>gallbladder and the bile salts at the</p>
<p>same time because that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>alkaline solution so here you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>the potato chloride and the alkaline at</p>
<p>the same time now we got a we</p>
<p>neutralized it I&rsquo;m like oh so probably</p>
<p>just do one thing at a time and start</p>
<p>with the petite hydrochloride and start</p>
<p>increasing the amount until your</p>
<p>heartburn goes away so you might end up</p>
<p>with like I don&rsquo;t know five six seven</p>
<p>eight nine ten also wow it took ten of</p>
<p>these and now I have no more heartburn</p>
<p>and then you just give that more time</p>
<p>and just let it kind of reestablish</p>
<p>um now let&rsquo;s say for example you took</p>
<p>leads between hydrochloride and you you</p>
<p>felt worse then that means you have</p>
<p>gastritis did that ever happen</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>yes I well</p>
<p>when I take four like you you said take</p>
<p>eight at a time I&rsquo;ve read that and um so</p>
<p>I take them they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re pretty big</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gel caps so they get lodged</p>
<p>and you get sick stomach and you then</p>
<p>you you know you kind of feel yucky and</p>
<p>then you have to eat and you know same</p>
<p>thing with the vitamins in the morning</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m a faster I fast omad pretty</p>
<p>much every day and when I take those 12</p>
<p>or so vitamins you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re a your k</p>
<p>your B your B12 all of those zinc</p>
<p>yeah I get sick to my stomach and I</p>
<p>found out last week that I was actually</p>
<p>getting severe stomach cramps and</p>
<p>I figured it was maybe the vitamins so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>yeah so you might have to just take</p>
<p>those with when you&rsquo;re one meal and just</p>
<p>take them with food</p>
<p>um the the type of betaine hydrochloride</p>
<p>you might want to get is not in a gel</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in a capsule it&rsquo;s just like in</p>
<p>a tablet</p>
<p>um okay because I do understand that</p>
<p>with your esophagus things can get kind</p>
<p>of stuck in there and then that can be a</p>
<p>big problem</p>
<p>um I would also</p>
<p>one thing I would take before bed is a</p>
<p>uh my liquid probiotic that way you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to take anything pill-wise</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>um that will actually kind of help you</p>
<p>from the other side of your body and</p>
<p>give you more microbes to make more</p>
<p>secondary bile and then we can actually</p>
<p>maybe kind of fix it from the other end</p>
<p>of your digestive tract but what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really running into is the duration of</p>
<p>being on this medication and what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>did to your pH of your stomach and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to kind of just</p>
<p>um play with it back and forth until you</p>
<p>can re-establish all the acid at the</p>
<p>same time taking medication and then you</p>
<p>slowly take less with the help of your</p>
<p>doctor you know just until the point</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re eventually off of it</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>coming off medication is always a</p>
<p>problem so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re up against but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if there is any tests that can um that</p>
<p>you can talk your GI doctor into doing</p>
<p>that could measure the pH of your</p>
<p>stomach that would be very valuable it</p>
<p>might be a pain in the butt to get it</p>
<p>done but I would get I would bet</p>
<p>anything it&rsquo;s it could be a pH of four</p>
<p>or five or even six which then would</p>
<p>just completely</p>
<p>you know so you can really see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on you&rsquo;re like it kind of baffle</p>
<p>your doctor to go wait a second how</p>
<p>could you have no hardly any acid but</p>
<p>you have heartburn that doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense to me well that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>the valve is not closing so</p>
<p>um one last Point okay and then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it but uh vitamin B1 uh in the form of</p>
<p>benfotamine not that you want to take</p>
<p>another supplement if you have a history</p>
<p>of insulin resistance</p>
<p>um you could be very deficient in B1 and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another reason why that valve</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t close</p>
<p>but again I don&rsquo;t want to throw so many</p>
<p>things at you at once so stick with the</p>
<p>retain another chloride and then solve</p>
<p>that and then go on to something else</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s great thanks so much</p>
<p>Nancy for that and by the way doc we got</p>
<p>a little later start and this is the</p>
<p>question I was dying to get answered why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we give them a bonus question here</p>
<p>and there it is</p>
<p>what is the most ignored disease on the</p>
<p>planet</p>
<p>I just find that do you want me to just</p>
<p>tell people because you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>should I just what it is yeah why not</p>
<p>they probably know anyway</p>
<p>well what do you think it is Steve</p>
<p>um you know I didn&rsquo;t give enough time to</p>
<p>think that I just wanted you to do all</p>
<p>the thinking</p>
<p>okay so um there is a disease out there</p>
<p>that causes it&rsquo;s more common it&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>hardly ever tested and it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>ignored it it&rsquo;s behind metabolic</p>
<p>syndrome a fatty liver obesity</p>
<p>especially in the midsection it&rsquo;s behind</p>
<p>getting up urinating at night it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behind getting tired after you eat</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s behind fluid retention it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behind diabetes okay wow so it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>one disease and we&rsquo;ll cover this next</p>
<p>week</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>hyperinsulinemia okay it&rsquo;s too much</p>
<p>insulin</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s behind this whole thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on behind so many other problems</p>
<p>and so really if you look at it these</p>
<p>other problems are really symptoms of</p>
<p>hyperinsulinemia and what&rsquo;s really wild</p>
<p>is they always check your blood sugars</p>
<p>but not the insulin levels</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say well you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re fine your blood sugars are level</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>how could it be possible Steve that</p>
<p>someone eats so much sugar like the</p>
<p>average person consumes like just</p>
<p>massive amounts of sugar in the diet but</p>
<p>their blood sugars are normal how could</p>
<p>their blood sugars be normal by</p>
<p>consuming all of this sugar in fact it</p>
<p>could be normal for 15 years</p>
<p>in the blood</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s happening in the</p>
<p>background is you have your pump and so</p>
<p>much insulin out to push that blood</p>
<p>sugar down to keep things normal</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re ignoring the real mechanism</p>
<p>behind this blood sugar which is the</p>
<p>insulin that&rsquo;s going way too high so the</p>
<p>earliest detection of blood sugar</p>
<p>problems occurs with insulin because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s trying to push this blood</p>
<p>sugar down so hyperinsulinemia is behind</p>
<p>this whole thing and of course if we</p>
<p>could only figure out what causes that</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>well we know what causes that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>high carb diets and frequent meeting</p>
<p>eating and snacking</p>
<p>so thus the ketogenic diet and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting wow and on that</p>
<p>note</p>
