    <p>The following is a conversation with Kevin Scott,</p>
<p>the CTO of Microsoft.</p>
<p>Before that, he was the senior vice president</p>
<p>of engineering and operations at LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And before that, he oversaw mobile ads engineering</p>
<p>at Google.</p>
<p>He also has a podcast called Behind the Tech</p>
<p>with Kevin Scott, which I&rsquo;m a fan of.</p>
<p>This was a fun and wide ranging conversation</p>
<p>that covered many aspects of computing.</p>
<p>It happened over a month ago,</p>
<p>before the announcement of Microsoft&rsquo;s investment</p>
<p>in OpenAI that a few people have asked me about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be one or two people in the future</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll talk with me about the impact of that investment.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on iTunes,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to give a special thank you</p>
<p>to Tom and Nelante Bighousen</p>
<p>for their support of the podcast on Patreon.</p>
<p>Thanks Tom and Nelante.</p>
<p>Hope I didn&rsquo;t mess up your last name too bad.</p>
<p>Your support means a lot</p>
<p>and inspires me to keep this series going.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Kevin Scott.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve described yourself as a kid in a candy store</p>
<p>at Microsoft because of all the interesting projects</p>
<p>that are going on.</p>
<p>Can you try to do the impossible task</p>
<p>and give a brief whirlwind view</p>
<p>of all the spaces that Microsoft is working in?</p>
<p>Both research and product?</p>
<p>If you include research,</p>
<p>it becomes even more difficult.</p>
<p>I think broadly speaking,</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s product portfolio includes everything</p>
<p>from big cloud business,</p>
<p>like a big set of SaaS services.</p>
<p>We have sort of the original,</p>
<p>or like some of what are among the original</p>
<p>productivity software products that everybody uses.</p>
<p>We have an operating system business.</p>
<p>We have a hardware business where we make everything</p>
<p>from computer mice and headphones</p>
<p>to high end personal computers and laptops.</p>
<p>We have a fairly broad ranging research group</p>
<p>where we have people doing everything</p>
<p>from economics research.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this really, really smart young economist,</p>
<p>Glenn Weil, who my group works with a lot,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s doing this research on these things</p>
<p>called radical markets.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s written an entire technical book</p>
<p>about this whole notion of radical markets.</p>
<p>So like the research group sort of spans from that</p>
<p>to human computer interaction to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And we have GitHub, we have LinkedIn,</p>
<p>we have a search advertising and news business</p>
<p>and like probably a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m embarrassingly not recounting in this list.</p>
<p>Gaming to Xbox and so on, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, gaming for sure.</p>
<p>Like I was having a super fun conversation this morning</p>
<p>with Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>So when I was in college,</p>
<p>there was this game that LucasArts made</p>
<p>called Day of the Tentacle</p>
<p>that my friends and I played forever.</p>
<p>And like we&rsquo;re doing some interesting collaboration now</p>
<p>with the folks who made Day of the Tentacle.</p>
<p>And I was like completely nerding out with Tim Schafer,</p>
<p>like the guy who wrote a Day of the Tentacle this morning,</p>
<p>just a complete fan boy,</p>
<p>which sort of it like happens a lot.</p>
<p>Like Microsoft has been doing so much stuff</p>
<p>at such breadth for such a long period of time</p>
<p>that like being CTO like most of the time,</p>
<p>my job is very, very serious.</p>
<p>And sometimes like I get caught up</p>
<p>in like how amazing it is to be able to have</p>
<p>the conversations that I have with the people</p>
<p>I get to have them with.</p>
<p>Yeah, to reach back into the sentimental.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the radical markets and the economics?</p>
<p>So the idea with radical markets is like,</p>
<p>can you come up with new market based mechanisms to,</p>
<p>you know, I think we have this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having this debate right now,</p>
<p>like does capitalism work like free markets work?</p>
<p>Can the incentive structures</p>
<p>that are built into these systems produce outcomes</p>
<p>that are creating sort of equitably distributed benefits</p>
<p>for every member of society?</p>
<p>You know, and I think it&rsquo;s a reasonable,</p>
<p>reasonable set of questions to be asking.</p>
<p>And so what Glenn, and so like, you know,</p>
<p>one mode of thought there,</p>
<p>like if you have doubts that the markets</p>
<p>are actually working, you can sort of like tip towards</p>
<p>like, okay, let&rsquo;s become more socialist</p>
<p>and, you know, like have central planning and, you know,</p>
<p>governments or some other central organization</p>
<p>is like making a bunch of decisions</p>
<p>about how, you know, sort of work gets done</p>
<p>and, you know, like where the, you know,</p>
<p>where the investments and where the outputs</p>
<p>of those investments get distributed.</p>
<p>Glenn&rsquo;s notion is like, lean more</p>
<p>into like the market based mechanism.</p>
<p>So like, for instance, you know,</p>
<p>this is one of the more radical ideas,</p>
<p>like suppose that you had a radical pricing mechanism</p>
<p>for assets like real estate where you were,</p>
<p>you could be bid out of your position</p>
<p>in your home, you know, for instance.</p>
<p>So like if somebody came along and said,</p>
<p>you know, like I can find higher economic utility</p>
<p>for this piece of real estate</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re running your business in,</p>
<p>like then like you either have to, you know,</p>
<p>sort of bid to sort of stay</p>
<p>or like the thing that&rsquo;s got the higher economic utility,</p>
<p>you know, sort of takes over the asset</p>
<p>which would make it very difficult</p>
<p>to have the same sort of rent seeking behaviors</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got right now</p>
<p>because like if you did speculative bidding,</p>
<p>like you would very quickly like lose a whole lot of money.</p>
<p>And so like the prices of the assets</p>
<p>would be sort of like very closely indexed</p>
<p>to like the value that they could produce.</p>
<p>And like, because like you&rsquo;d have this sort</p>
<p>of real time mechanism that would force you</p>
<p>to sort of mark the value of the asset to the market,</p>
<p>then it could be taxed appropriately.</p>
<p>Like you couldn&rsquo;t sort of sit on this thing and say,</p>
<p>oh, like this house is only worth 10,000 bucks</p>
<p>when like everything around it is worth 10 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, so it&rsquo;s an incentive structure</p>
<p>that where the prices match the value much better.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Glenn does a much better job than I do</p>
<p>at selling and I probably picked the world&rsquo;s worst example,</p>
<p>you know, and it&rsquo;s intentionally provocative,</p>
<p>so like this whole notion,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not sure whether I like this notion</p>
<p>that like we can have a set of market mechanisms</p>
<p>where I could get bid out of my property, you know,</p>
<p>but you know, like if you&rsquo;re thinking about something</p>
<p>like Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s wealth tax, for instance,</p>
<p>like you would have, I mean, it&rsquo;d be really interesting</p>
<p>in like how you would actually set the price on the assets</p>
<p>and like you might have to have a mechanism like that</p>
<p>if you put a tax like that in place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting that that kind of research,</p>
<p>at least tangentially is touching Microsoft research.</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re really thinking broadly.</p>
<p>Maybe you can speak to, this connects to AI,</p>
<p>so we have a candidate, Andrew Yang,</p>
<p>who kind of talks about artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and the concern that people have about, you know,</p>
<p>automation&rsquo;s impact on society and arguably,</p>
<p>Microsoft is at the cutting edge of innovation</p>
<p>in all these kinds of ways and so it&rsquo;s pushing AI forward.</p>
<p>How do you think about combining all our conversations</p>
<p>together here with radical markets and socialism</p>
<p>and innovation in AI that Microsoft is doing</p>
<p>and then Andrew Yang&rsquo;s worry that that will result</p>
<p>in job loss for the lower and so on.</p>
<p>How do you think about that?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s sort of one of the most important questions</p>
<p>in technology like maybe even in society right now</p>
<p>about how is AI going to develop</p>
<p>over the course of the next several decades</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s it going to be used for</p>
<p>and what benefits will it produce</p>
<p>and what negative impacts will it produce</p>
<p>and who gets to steer this whole thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say at the highest level,</p>
<p>one of the real joys of getting to do what I do at Microsoft</p>
<p>is Microsoft has this heritage as a platform company</p>
<p>and so Bill has this thing that he said a bunch of years ago</p>
<p>where the measure of a successful platform</p>
<p>is that it produces far more economic value</p>
<p>for the people who build on top of the platform</p>
<p>than is created for the platform owner or builder</p>
<p>and I think we have to think about AI that way.</p>
<p>As a platform.</p>
<p>Yeah, it has to be a platform that other people can use</p>
<p>to build businesses, to fulfill their creative objectives,</p>
<p>to be entrepreneurs, to solve problems that they have</p>
<p>in their work and in their lives.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be a thing where there are a handful of companies</p>
<p>sitting in a very small handful of cities geographically</p>
<p>who are making all the decisions about what goes into the AI</p>
<p>and then on top of all this infrastructure,</p>
<p>then build all of the commercially valuable uses for it.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s bad from a sort of economics</p>
<p>and sort of equitable distribution of value perspective,</p>
<p>sort of back to this whole notion of did the markets work?</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also bad from an innovation perspective</p>
<p>because I have infinite amounts of faith</p>
<p>in human beings that if you give folks powerful tools,</p>
<p>they will go do interesting things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more than just a few tens of thousands of people</p>
<p>with the interesting tools,</p>
<p>it should be millions of people with the tools.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like you think about the steam engine</p>
<p>in the late 18th century, like it was maybe the first</p>
<p>large scale substitute for human labor</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve built like a machine</p>
<p>and in the beginning when these things are getting deployed,</p>
<p>the folks who got most of the value from the steam engines</p>
<p>were the folks who had capital</p>
<p>so they could afford to build them</p>
<p>and like they built factories around them and businesses</p>
<p>and the experts who knew how to build and maintain them.</p>
<p>But access to that technology democratized over time.</p>
<p>Like now, like an engine, it&rsquo;s not like a differentiated</p>
<p>thing, like there isn&rsquo;t one engine company</p>
<p>that builds all the engines</p>
<p>and all of the things that use engines</p>
<p>are made by this company</p>
<p>and like they get all the economics from all of that.</p>
<p>Like fully demarcated, like they&rsquo;re probably,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re sitting here in this room</p>
<p>and like even though they&rsquo;re probably things</p>
<p>like the MEMS gyroscope that are in both of our phones,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s like little engines sort of everywhere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just a component in how we build the modern world.</p>
<p>Like AI needs to get there.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s a really powerful way to think.</p>
<p>If we think of AI as a platform</p>
<p>versus a tool that Microsoft owns,</p>
<p>as a platform that enables creation on top of it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the way to democratize it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting actually.</p>
<p>And Microsoft throughout its history</p>
<p>has been positioned well to do that.</p>
<p>And the tie back to this radical markets thing,</p>
<p>like so my team has been working with Glenn on this,</p>
<p>and Jaren Lanier actually.</p>
<p>So Jaren is the sort of father of virtual reality.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s one of the most interesting human beings on the planet,</p>
<p>like a sweet, sweet guy.</p>
<p>And so Jaren and Glenn and folks in my team have been working</p>
<p>on this notion of data as labor</p>
<p>or like they call it data dignity as well.</p>
<p>And so the idea is that if you,</p>
<p>again going back to this sort of industrial analogy,</p>
<p>if you think about data as the raw material that is</p>
<p>consumed by the machine of AI in order to do useful things,</p>
<p>then like we&rsquo;re not doing a really great job right now in having</p>
<p>transparent marketplaces for valuing those data contributions.</p>
<p>So and we all make them explicitly like you go to LinkedIn,</p>
<p>you sort of set up your profile on LinkedIn,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s an explicit contribution.</p>
<p>Like you know exactly the information</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re putting into the system.</p>
<p>And like you put it there because you have</p>
<p>some nominal notion of what value you&rsquo;re going to get in return.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like only nominal,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t know exactly what value you&rsquo;re getting in return.</p>
<p>Like service is free,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s low amount of perceived debt.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got all this indirect contribution that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>making just by virtue of interacting with all of</p>
<p>the technology that&rsquo;s in your daily life.</p>
<p>And so like what Glenn and</p>
<p>Jaren and this data dignity team are trying to do is like,</p>
<p>can we figure out a set of mechanisms that let us value</p>
<p>those data contributions so that you could create</p>
<p>an economy and like a set of controls and incentives that</p>
<p>would allow people to like maybe even in the limit,</p>
<p>like earn part of their living</p>
<p>through the data that they&rsquo;re creating.</p>
<p>And like you can sort of see it in explicit ways.</p>
<p>There are these companies like Scale AI,</p>
<p>and like there are a whole bunch of them in China</p>
<p>right now that are basically data labeling companies.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re doing supervised machine learning,</p>
<p>you need lots and lots of label training data.</p>
<p>And like those people who work for</p>
<p>those companies are getting compensated</p>
<p>for their data contributions into the system.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s easier to put a number on</p>
<p>their contribution because they&rsquo;re explicitly labeling data.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying that we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>contributing data in different kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating to start to</p>
<p>explicitly try to put a number on it.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s possible?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s hard. It really is.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>as much transparency as I think</p>
<p>we need in like how the data is getting used.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s super complicated.</p>
<p>Like we, I think as</p>
<p>technologists sort of appreciate</p>
<p>like some of the subtlety there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the data gets created and then it gets,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not valuable.</p>
<p>Like the data exhaust that you give off,</p>
<p>or the explicit data that I am putting into</p>
<p>the system isn&rsquo;t super valuable atomically.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s only valuable when you sort of</p>
<p>aggregate it together into sort of large numbers.</p>
<p>This is true even for these like folks who are</p>
<p>getting compensated for like labeling things.</p>
<p>Like for supervised machine learning now,</p>
<p>like you need lots of labels to</p>
<p>train a model that performs well.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s one of the challenges.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how do you sort of figure</p>
<p>out like because this data is getting combined in</p>
<p>so many ways like through</p>
<p>these combinations like how the value is flowing.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah. And it&rsquo;s fascinating that you&rsquo;re thinking about this.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t even going into this conversation expecting</p>
<p>the breadth of research really</p>
<p>that Microsoft broadly is thinking about,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about at Microsoft.</p>
<p>So if we go back to 89 when Microsoft released Office,</p>
<p>or 1990 when they released Windows 3.0.</p>
<p>In your view, I know you weren&rsquo;t there through its history,</p>
<p>but how has the company changed in</p>
<p>the 30 years since as you look at it now?</p>
<p>The good thing is it&rsquo;s started off as a platform company.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s still a platform company,</p>
<p>like the parts of the business that are thriving and</p>
<p>most successful are those that are building platforms.</p>
<p>Like the mission of the company now is,</p>
<p>the mission&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like changed in a very interesting way.</p>
<p>So back in 89,</p>
<p>90 like they were still on the original mission,</p>
<p>which was like put a PC on every desk and in every home.</p>
<p>And it was basically about democratizing access to</p>
<p>this new personal computing technology,</p>
<p>which when Bill started the company,</p>
<p>integrated circuit microprocessors were a brand new thing.</p>
<p>And people were building homebrew computers from kits,</p>
<p>like the way people build ham radios right now.</p>
<p>I think this is the interesting thing</p>
<p>for folks who build platforms in general.</p>
<p>Bill saw the opportunity there and</p>
<p>what personal computers could do.</p>
<p>And it was like, it was sort of a reach.</p>
<p>Like you just sort of imagine like where things</p>
<p>were when they started the company</p>
<p>versus where things are now.</p>
<p>Like in success,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve democratized a platform,</p>
<p>it just sort of vanishes into the platform.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t pay attention to it anymore.</p>
<p>Like operating systems aren&rsquo;t a thing anymore.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re super important,</p>
<p>like completely critical.</p>
<p>And like when you see one fail,</p>
<p>like you just sort of understand.</p>
<p>But like it&rsquo;s not a thing where you&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>waiting for the next operating system thing</p>
<p>in the same way that you were in 1995, right?</p>
<p>Like in 1995, like we had</p>
<p>Rolling Stones on the stage with the Windows 95 rollout.</p>
<p>Like it was like the biggest thing in the world.</p>
<p>Everybody lined up for it the way</p>
<p>that people used to line up for iPhone.</p>
<p>But like, you know, eventually,</p>
<p>and like this isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>Like it just sort of, you know,</p>
<p>the success is that it&rsquo;s sort of, it becomes ubiquitous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everywhere, like human beings,</p>
<p>when their technology becomes ubiquitous,</p>
<p>they just sort of start taking it for granted.</p>
<p>So the mission now that Satya</p>
<p>rearticulated five plus years ago now,</p>
<p>when he took over as CEO of the company.</p>
<p>Our mission is to empower every individual and</p>
<p>every organization in the world to be more successful.</p>
<p>And so, you know, again,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a platform mission.</p>
<p>And like the way that we do it now is, is different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we have a hyperscale cloud that</p>
<p>people are building their applications on top of.</p>
<p>Like we have a bunch of AI infrastructure that</p>
<p>people are building their AI applications on top of.</p>
<p>We have, you know,</p>
<p>we have a productivity suite of software,</p>
<p>like Microsoft Dynamics, which, you know,</p>
<p>some people might not think is the sexiest thing in the world,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like helping people figure out how to automate</p>
<p>all of their business processes and workflows</p>
<p>and to help those businesses using it to grow and be more.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a much broader vision</p>
<p>in a way now than it was back then.</p>
<p>Like it was sort of very particular thing.</p>
<p>And like now, like we live in this world where</p>
<p>technology is so powerful and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>such a basic fact of life that it both exists</p>
<p>and is going to get better and better over time</p>
<p>or at least more and more powerful over time.</p>
<p>So like, you know, what you have to do as a platform player</p>
<p>is just much bigger.</p>
<p>Right. There&rsquo;s so many directions in which you can transform.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t mention mixed reality, too.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s probably early days</p>
<p>or it depends how you think of it.</p>
<p>But if we think on a scale of centuries,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the early days of mixed reality.</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>And so with HoloLens,</p>
<p>Microsoft is doing some really interesting work there.</p>
<p>Do you touch that part of the effort?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the thinking?</p>
<p>Do you think of mixed reality as a platform, too?</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>When we look at what the platforms of the future could be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fairly obvious that like AI is one.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have to, I mean, like that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, you sort of say it to like someone</p>
<p>and you know, like they get it.</p>
<p>But like we also think of the like mixed reality</p>
<p>and quantum as like these two interesting,</p>
<p>you know, potentially.</p>
<p>Quantum computing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay. So let&rsquo;s get crazy then.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about some futuristic things here.</p>
<p>Well, the mixed reality, Microsoft is really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even futuristic, it&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible stuff.</p>
<p>And look, and it&rsquo;s having an impact right now.</p>
<p>Like one of the more interesting things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happened with mixed reality</p>
<p>over the past couple of years that I didn&rsquo;t clearly see</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s become the computing device</p>
<p>for folks who, for doing their work,</p>
<p>who haven&rsquo;t used any computing device at all</p>
<p>to do their work before.</p>
<p>So technicians and service folks and people</p>
<p>who are doing like machine maintenance on factory floors.</p>
<p>So like they, you know, because they&rsquo;re mobile</p>
<p>and like they&rsquo;re out in the world</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re working with their hands</p>
<p>and, you know, sort of servicing these like</p>
<p>very complicated things, they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t use their mobile phone</p>
<p>and like they don&rsquo;t carry a laptop with them</p>
<p>and, you know, they&rsquo;re not tethered to a desk.</p>
<p>And so mixed reality, like where it&rsquo;s getting traction</p>
<p>right now, where HoloLens is selling a lot of units</p>
<p>is for these sorts of applications for these workers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s become like, I mean, like the people love it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh my God, like this is like for them,</p>
<p>like the same sort of productivity boosts that,</p>
<p>you know, like an office worker had</p>
<p>when they got their first personal computer.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you did mention it&rsquo;s certainly obvious AI</p>
<p>as a platform, but can we dig into it a little bit?</p>
<p>How does AI begin to infuse some of the products</p>
<p>in Microsoft?</p>
<p>So currently providing training of,</p>
<p>for example, neural networks in the cloud</p>
<p>or providing pre trained models or just even providing</p>
<p>computing resources and whatever different inference</p>
<p>that you wanna do using neural networks.</p>
<p>How do you think of AI infusing as a platform</p>
<p>that Microsoft can provide?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everywhere.</p>
<p>And like we run these review meetings now</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s me and Satya and like members</p>
<p>of Satya&rsquo;s leadership team and like a cross functional</p>
<p>group of folks across the entire company</p>
<p>who are working on like either AI infrastructure</p>
<p>or like have some substantial part of their product work</p>
<p>using AI in some significant way.</p>
<p>Now, the important thing to understand</p>
<p>is like when you think about like how the AI</p>
<p>is gonna manifest in like an experience</p>
<p>for something that&rsquo;s gonna make it better,</p>
<p>like I think you don&rsquo;t want the AIness</p>
<p>to be the first order thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like whatever the product is</p>
<p>and like the thing that is trying to help you do,</p>
<p>like the AI just sort of makes it better.</p>
<p>And this is a gross exaggeration,</p>
<p>but like people get super excited about like</p>
<p>where the AI is showing up in products and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>do you get that excited about like</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re using a hash table like in your code?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just another.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting programming tool,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of like it&rsquo;s an engineering tool.</p>
<p>And so like it shows up everywhere.</p>
<p>So like we&rsquo;ve got dozens and dozens of features</p>
<p>now in Office that are powered by</p>
<p>like fairly sophisticated machine learning,</p>
<p>our search engine wouldn&rsquo;t work at all</p>
<p>if you took the machine learning out of it.</p>
<p>The like increasingly things like content moderation</p>
<p>on our Xbox and xCloud platform.</p>
<p>When you mean moderation,</p>
<p>you mean like the recommender is like showing</p>
<p>what you wanna look at next.</p>
<p>No, no, no, it&rsquo;s like anti bullying stuff.</p>
<p>So the usual social network stuff</p>
<p>that you have to deal with.</p>
<p>Yeah, correct.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like really it&rsquo;s targeted,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s targeted towards a gaming audience.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a very particular type of thing</p>
<p>where the line between playful banter</p>
<p>and like legitimate bullying is like a subtle one.</p>
<p>And like you have to like, it&rsquo;s sort of tough.</p>
<p>Like I have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to if we could dig into it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re also,</p>
<p>you led the engineering efforts of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And if we look at LinkedIn as a social network,</p>
<p>and if we look at the Xbox gaming as the social components,</p>
<p>the very different kinds of I imagine communication</p>
<p>going on on the two platforms, right?</p>
<p>And the line in terms of bullying and so on</p>
<p>is different on the platforms.</p>
<p>So how do you,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s such a fascinating philosophical discussion</p>
<p>of where that line is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows the right answer.</p>
<p>Twitter folks are under fire now, Jack at Twitter</p>
<p>for trying to find that line.</p>
<p>Nobody knows what that line is.</p>
<p>But how do you try to find the line</p>
<p>for trying to prevent abusive behavior</p>
<p>and at the same time, let people be playful</p>
<p>and joke around and that kind of thing?</p>
<p>I think in a certain way,</p>
<p>like if you have what I would call vertical social networks,</p>
<p>it gets to be a little bit easier.</p>
<p>So like if you have a clear notion</p>
<p>of like what your social network should be used for,</p>
<p>or like what you are designing a community around,</p>
<p>then you don&rsquo;t have as many dimensions</p>
<p>to your sort of content safety problem</p>
<p>as you do in a general purpose platform.</p>
<p>I mean, so like on LinkedIn,</p>
<p>like the whole social network</p>
<p>is about connecting people with opportunity,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s helping them find a job</p>
<p>or to sort of find mentors</p>
<p>or to sort of help them like find their next sales lead</p>
<p>or to just sort of allow them to broadcast</p>
<p>their sort of professional identity</p>
<p>to their network of peers and collaborators</p>
<p>and sort of professional community.</p>
<p>Like that is, I mean, like in some ways,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s very, very broad,</p>
<p>but in other ways it&rsquo;s sort of, it&rsquo;s narrow.</p>
<p>And so like you can build AI&rsquo;s like machine learning systems</p>
<p>that are capable with those boundaries</p>
<p>of making better automated decisions</p>
<p>about like what is sort of inappropriate</p>
<p>and offensive comment or dangerous comment</p>
<p>or illegal content when you have some constraints.</p>
<p>You know, same thing with like the gaming social network.</p>
<p>So for instance, like it&rsquo;s about playing games,</p>
<p>not having fun.</p>
<p>And like the thing that you don&rsquo;t want to have happen</p>
<p>on the platform is why bullying is such an important thing.</p>
<p>Like bullying is not fun.</p>
<p>So you want to do everything in your power</p>
<p>to encourage that not to happen.</p>
<p>And yeah, but I think it&rsquo;s sort of a tough problem</p>
<p>in general and it&rsquo;s one where I think, you know,</p>
<p>eventually we&rsquo;re going to have to have some sort</p>
<p>of clarification from our policymakers about what it is</p>
<p>that we should be doing, like where the lines are,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t, like in democracy, right?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t want,</p>
<p>you want some sort of democratic involvement.</p>
<p>Like people should have a say</p>
<p>in like where the lines are drawn.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t want a bunch of people making</p>
<p>like unilateral decisions.</p>
<p>And like we are in a state right now</p>
<p>for some of these platforms</p>
<p>where you actually do have to make unilateral decisions</p>
<p>where the policymaking isn&rsquo;t going to happen fast enough</p>
<p>in order to like prevent very bad things from happening.</p>
<p>But like we need the policymaking side of that to catch up,</p>
<p>I think, as quickly as possible</p>
<p>because you want that whole process to be a democratic thing,</p>
<p>not a, you know, not some sort of weird thing</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve got a non representative group</p>
<p>of people making decisions that have, you know,</p>
<p>like national and global impact.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating because the digital space is different</p>
<p>than the physical space in which nations</p>
<p>and governments were established.</p>
<p>And so what policy looks like globally,</p>
<p>what bullying looks like globally,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s healthy communication looks like globally</p>
<p>is an open question and we&rsquo;re all figuring it out together,</p>
<p>which is fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean with, you know, sort of fake news, for instance.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Deep fakes and fake news generated by humans?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we can talk about deep fakes,</p>
<p>like I think that is another like, you know,</p>
<p>sort of very interesting level of complexity.</p>
<p>But like if you think about just the written word, right?</p>
<p>Like we have, you know, we invented papyrus,</p>
<p>what, 3,000 years ago where we, you know,</p>
<p>you could sort of put word on paper.</p>
<p>And then 500 years ago, like we get the printing press,</p>
<p>like where the word gets a little bit more ubiquitous.</p>
<p>And then like you really, really didn&rsquo;t get ubiquitous</p>
<p>printed word until the end of the 19th century</p>
<p>when the offset press was invented.</p>
<p>And then, you know, just sort of explodes</p>
<p>and like, you know, the cross product of that</p>
<p>and the Industrial Revolution&rsquo;s need</p>
<p>for educated citizens resulted in like</p>
<p>this rapid expansion of literacy</p>
<p>and the rapid expansion of the word.</p>
<p>But like we had 3,000 years up to that point</p>
<p>to figure out like how to, you know,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s journalism, what&rsquo;s editorial integrity,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s, you know, what&rsquo;s scientific peer review.</p>
<p>And so like you built all of this mechanism</p>
<p>to like try to filter through all of the noise</p>
<p>that the technology made possible</p>
<p>to like, you know, sort of getting to something</p>
<p>that society could cope with.</p>
<p>And like, if you think about just the piece,</p>
<p>the PC didn&rsquo;t exist 50 years ago.</p>
<p>And so in like this span of, you know,</p>
<p>like half a century, like we&rsquo;ve gone from no digital,</p>
<p>you know, no ubiquitous digital technology</p>
<p>to like having a device that sits in your pocket</p>
<p>where you can sort of say whatever is on your mind</p>
<p>to like what did Mary have in her,</p>
<p>Mary Meeker just released her new like slide deck last week.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve got 50% penetration of the internet</p>
<p>to the global population.</p>
<p>Like there are like three and a half billion people</p>
<p>who are connected now.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s crazy, crazy, like inconceivable,</p>
<p>like how fast all of this happened.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s not surprising</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t figured out what to do yet,</p>
<p>but like we gotta really like lean into this set of problems</p>
<p>because like we basically have three millennia worth of work</p>
<p>to do about how to deal with all of this</p>
<p>and like probably what, you know,</p>
<p>amounts to the next decade worth of time.</p>
<p>So since we&rsquo;re on the topic of tough, you know,</p>
<p>tough challenging problems,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s look at more on the tooling side in AI</p>
<p>that Microsoft is looking at is face recognition software.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of powerful positive use cases</p>
<p>for face recognition, but there&rsquo;s some negative ones</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing those in different governments</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>So how do you, how does Microsoft think about the use</p>
<p>of face recognition software as a platform</p>
<p>in governments and companies?</p>
<p>How do we strike an ethical balance here?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think we&rsquo;ve articulated a clear point of view.</p>
<p>So Brad Smith wrote a blog post last fall,</p>
<p>I believe that sort of like outlined</p>
<p>like very specifically what, you know,</p>
<p>what our point of view is there.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think we believe</p>
<p>that there are certain uses</p>
<p>to which face recognition should not be put.</p>
<p>And we believe again,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a need for regulation there.</p>
<p>Like the government should like really come in</p>
<p>and say that, you know, this is where the lines are.</p>
<p>And like, we very much wanted to like figuring out</p>
<p>where the lines are, should be a democratic process.</p>
<p>But in the short term, like we&rsquo;ve drawn some lines</p>
<p>where, you know, we push back against uses</p>
<p>of face recognition technology, you know,</p>
<p>like the city of San Francisco, for instance,</p>
<p>I think has completely outlawed any government agency</p>
<p>from using face recognition tech.</p>
<p>And like that may prove to be a little bit overly broad.</p>
<p>But for like certain law enforcement things,</p>
<p>like you really, I would personally rather be overly</p>
<p>sort of cautious in terms of restricting use of it</p>
<p>until like we have, you know,</p>
<p>sort of defined a reasonable, you know,</p>
<p>democratically determined regulatory framework</p>
<p>for like where we could and should use it.</p>
<p>And, you know, the other thing there is like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a bunch of research that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and a bunch of progress that we&rsquo;ve made on bias there.</p>
<p>And like, there are all sorts of like weird biases</p>
<p>that these models can have,</p>
<p>like all the way from like the most noteworthy one</p>
<p>where, you know, you may have underrepresented minorities</p>
<p>who are like underrepresented in the training data</p>
<p>and then you start learning like strange things.</p>
<p>But like there are even, you know, other weird things.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve, I think we&rsquo;ve seen in the public research,</p>
<p>like models can learn strange things,</p>
<p>like all doctors are men, for instance, just, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, and so like, it really is a thing</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very important for everybody</p>
<p>who is working on these things before they push publish,</p>
<p>they launch the experiment, they, you know, push the code</p>
<p>to, you know, online, or they even publish the paper</p>
<p>that they are at least starting to think about</p>
<p>what some of the potential negative consequences are,</p>
<p>some of this stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, this is where, you know, like the deep fake stuff</p>
<p>I find very worrisome just because</p>
<p>there are going to be some very good beneficial uses</p>
<p>of like GAN generated imagery.</p>
<p>And funny enough, like one of the places</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s actually useful is we&rsquo;re using the technology</p>
<p>right now to generate synthetic visual data</p>
<p>for training some of the face recognition models</p>
<p>to get rid of the bias.</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s one like super good use of the tech,</p>
<p>but like, you know, it&rsquo;s getting good enough now</p>
<p>where, you know, it&rsquo;s going to sort of challenge</p>
<p>a normal human being&rsquo;s ability to,</p>
<p>like now you&rsquo;re just sort of say,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s very expensive for someone</p>
<p>to fabricate a photorealistic fake video.</p>
<p>And like GANs are going to make it fantastically cheap</p>
<p>to fabricate a photorealistic fake video.</p>
<p>And so like what you assume you can sort of trust is true</p>
<p>versus like be skeptical about is about to change.</p>
<p>And like, we&rsquo;re not ready for it, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>The nature of truth, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s also exciting because I think both you and I</p>
<p>probably would agree that the way to solve,</p>
<p>to take on that challenge is with technology, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably going to be ideas of ways to verify</p>
<p>which kind of video is legitimate, which kind is not.</p>
<p>So to me, that&rsquo;s an exciting possibility,</p>
<p>most likely for just the comedic genius</p>
<p>that the internet usually creates with these kinds of videos</p>
<p>and hopefully will not result in any serious harm.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it could be, you know,</p>
<p>like I think we will have technology to,</p>
<p>that may be able to detect whether or not</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s fake or real.</p>
<p>Although the fakes are pretty convincing,</p>
<p>even like when you subject them to machine scrutiny.</p>
<p>But, you know, we also have these increasingly</p>
<p>interesting social networks, you know,</p>
<p>that are under fire right now</p>
<p>for some of the bad things that they do.</p>
<p>Like one of the things you could choose to do</p>
<p>with a social network is like you could,</p>
<p>you could use crypto and the networks</p>
<p>to like have content signed</p>
<p>where you could have a like full chain of custody</p>
<p>that accompanied every piece of content.</p>
<p>So like when you&rsquo;re viewing something</p>
<p>and like you want to ask yourself,</p>
<p>like how much can I trust this?</p>
<p>Like you can click something</p>
<p>and like have a verified chain of custody</p>
<p>that shows like, oh, this is coming from this source.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like signed by like someone</p>
<p>whose identity I trust.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think having that, you know,</p>
<p>having that chain of custody,</p>
<p>like being able to like say, oh, here&rsquo;s this video.</p>
<p>Like it may or may not have been produced</p>
<p>using some of this deepfake technology,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve got a verified chain of custody</p>
<p>where you can sort of trace it all the way back</p>
<p>to an identity and you can decide whether or not</p>
<p>like I trust this identity.</p>
<p>Like, oh no, this is really from the White House</p>
<p>or like this is really from the, you know,</p>
<p>the office of this particular presidential candidate</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s really from, you know, Jeff Wiener, CEO of LinkedIn</p>
<p>or Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft.</p>
<p>Like that might be like one way</p>
<p>that you can solve some of the problems.</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s not the super high tech.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve had all of this technology forever.</p>
<p>And, but I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Like it has to be some sort of technological thing</p>
<p>because the underlying tech that is used to create this</p>
<p>is not going to do anything but get better over time</p>
<p>and the genie is sort of out of the bottle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no stuffing it back in.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a social component,</p>
<p>which I think is really healthy for a democracy</p>
<p>where people will be skeptical</p>
<p>about the thing they watch in general.</p>
<p>So, you know, which is good.</p>
<p>Skepticism in general is good for content.</p>
<p>So deepfakes in that sense are creating a global skepticism</p>
<p>about can they trust what they read.</p>
<p>It encourages further research.</p>
<p>I come from the Soviet Union</p>
<p>where basically nobody trusted the media</p>
<p>because you knew it was propaganda.</p>
<p>And that kind of skepticism encouraged further research</p>
<p>about ideas as opposed to just trusting any one source.</p>
<p>Well, look, I think it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why</p>
<p>the scientific method and our apparatus</p>
<p>of modern science is so good.</p>
<p>Like, because you don&rsquo;t have to trust anything.</p>
<p>Like, the whole notion of modern science</p>
<p>beyond the fact that this is a hypothesis</p>
<p>and this is an experiment to test the hypothesis</p>
<p>and this is a peer review process</p>
<p>for scrutinizing published results.</p>
<p>But stuff&rsquo;s also supposed to be reproducible.</p>
<p>So you know it&rsquo;s been vetted by this process,</p>
<p>but you also are expected to publish enough detail</p>
<p>where if you are sufficiently skeptical of the thing,</p>
<p>you can go try to reproduce it yourself.</p>
<p>And like, I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>Like, I think a lot of engineers are like this</p>
<p>where like, you know, sort of this,</p>
<p>like your brain is sort of wired for skepticism.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t just first order trust everything</p>
<p>that you see and encounter.</p>
<p>And like, you&rsquo;re sort of curious to understand,</p>
<p>you know, the next thing.</p>
<p>But like, I think it&rsquo;s an entirely healthy thing.</p>
<p>And like, we need a little bit more of that right now.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a large business owner.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just a huge fan of many of Microsoft products.</p>
<p>I mean, I still, actually in terms of,</p>
<p>I generate a lot of graphics and images</p>
<p>and I still use PowerPoint to do that.</p>
<p>It beats Illustrator for me.</p>
<p>Even professional sort of, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So I wonder, what is the future of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say Windows and Office look like?</p>
<p>Is, do you see it?</p>
<p>I mean, I remember looking forward to XP.</p>
<p>Was it exciting when XP was released?</p>
<p>Just like you said, I don&rsquo;t remember when 95 was released.</p>
<p>But XP for me was a big celebration.</p>
<p>And when 10 came out, I was like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice improvement.</p>
<p>So what do you see the future of these products?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a bunch of excite.</p>
<p>I mean, on the Office front,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be this like increasing productivity wins</p>
<p>that are coming out of some of these AI powered features</p>
<p>that are coming.</p>
<p>Like the products will sort of get smarter and smarter</p>
<p>in like a very subtle way.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s not gonna be this big bang moment</p>
<p>where like Clippy is gonna reemerge and it&rsquo;s gonna be.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ll have to wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Is Clippy coming back?</p>
<p>But quite seriously, so injection of AI.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much, or at least I&rsquo;m not familiar,</p>
<p>sort of assistive type of stuff going on</p>
<p>inside the Office products.</p>
<p>Like a Clippy style assistant, personal assistant.</p>
<p>Do you think that there&rsquo;s a possibility</p>
<p>of that in the future?</p>
<p>So I think there are a bunch of like very small ways</p>
<p>in which like machine learning powered assistive things</p>
<p>are in the product right now.</p>
<p>So there are a bunch of interesting things.</p>
<p>Like the auto response stuff&rsquo;s getting better and better.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like getting to the point</p>
<p>where it can auto respond with like,</p>
<p>okay, this person&rsquo;s clearly trying to schedule a meeting.</p>
<p>So it looks at your calendar and it automatically</p>
<p>like tries to find like a time and a space</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mutually interesting.</p>
<p>Like we have this notion of Microsoft search</p>
<p>at a Microsoft search where it&rsquo;s like not just web search,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like search across like all of your information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sitting inside of like your Office 365 tenant</p>
<p>and like potentially in other products.</p>
<p>And like we have this thing called the Microsoft Graph</p>
<p>that is basically an API federator that sort of like</p>
<p>gets you hooked up across the entire breadth</p>
<p>of like all of the, like what were information silos</p>
<p>before they got woven together with the graph.</p>
<p>Like that is like getting increasing,</p>
<p>with increasing effectiveness,</p>
<p>sort of plumbed into some of these auto response things</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna be able to see the system</p>
<p>like automatically retrieve information for you.</p>
<p>Like if, you know, like I frequently send out,</p>
<p>you know, emails to folks where like I can&rsquo;t find a paper</p>
<p>or a document or whatnot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why the system</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t be able to do that for you.</p>
<p>And like, I think the, it&rsquo;s building towards</p>
<p>like having things that look more like,</p>
<p>like a fully integrated, you know, assistant,</p>
<p>but like you&rsquo;ll have a bunch of steps</p>
<p>that you will see before you,</p>
<p>like it will not be this like big bang thing</p>
<p>where like Clippy comes back and you&rsquo;ve got this like,</p>
<p>you know, manifestation of, you know,</p>
<p>like a fully, fully powered assistant.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s definitely coming in,</p>
<p>like all of the, you know, collaboration,</p>
<p>coauthoring stuff&rsquo;s getting better.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like really interesting.</p>
<p>Like if you look at how we use</p>
<p>the Office product portfolio at Microsoft,</p>
<p>like more and more of it is happening inside of</p>
<p>like Teams as a canvas.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s this thing where, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got collaboration is like at the center</p>
<p>of the product and like we built some like really cool stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some of, which is about to be open source</p>
<p>that are sort of framework level things</p>
<p>for doing, for doing coauthoring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So in, is there a cloud component to that?</p>
<p>So on the web, or is it,</p>
<p>and forgive me if I don&rsquo;t already know this,</p>
<p>but with Office 365, we still,</p>
<p>the collaboration we do if we&rsquo;re doing Word,</p>
<p>we still send the file around.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>So this is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already a little bit better than that.</p>
<p>A little bit better than that and like, you know,</p>
<p>so like the fact that you&rsquo;re unaware of it means</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a better job to do,</p>
<p>like helping you discover, discover this stuff.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s already like got a huge,</p>
<p>huge cloud component.</p>
<p>And like part of, you know, part of this framework stuff,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re calling it, like I,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve been working on it for a couple of years.</p>
<p>So like, I know the internal code name for it,</p>
<p>but I think when we launched it to build,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the Fluid Framework.</p>
<p>And, but like what Fluid lets you do is like,</p>
<p>you can go into a conversation that you&rsquo;re having in Teams</p>
<p>and like reference like part of a spreadsheet</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working on where somebody&rsquo;s like sitting</p>
<p>in the Excel canvas,</p>
<p>like working on the spreadsheet with a, you know,</p>
<p>chart or whatnot,</p>
<p>and like you can sort of embed like part of the spreadsheet</p>
<p>in the Teams conversation where like you can dynamically</p>
<p>update it and like all of the changes that you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>to the, to this object are like, you know,</p>
<p>coordinate and everything is sort of updating in real time.</p>
<p>So like you can be in whatever canvas is most convenient</p>
<p>for you to get your work done.</p>
<p>So I, out of my own sort of curiosity as an engineer,</p>
<p>I know what it&rsquo;s like to sort of lead a team</p>
<p>of 10, 15 engineers.</p>
<p>Microsoft has, I don&rsquo;t know what the numbers are,</p>
<p>maybe 50, maybe 60,000 engineers, maybe 40.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what the number is, it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s more than 10 or 15.</p>
<p>What, I mean, you&rsquo;ve led different sizes,</p>
<p>mostly large size of engineers.</p>
<p>What does it take to lead such a large group</p>
<p>into a continue innovation,</p>
<p>continue being highly productive</p>
<p>and yet develop all kinds of new ideas and yet maintain,</p>
<p>like what does it take to lead such a large group</p>
<p>of brilliant people?</p>
<p>I think the thing that you learn</p>
<p>as you manage larger and larger scale</p>
<p>is that there are three things</p>
<p>that are like very, very important</p>
<p>for big engineering teams.</p>
<p>Like one is like having some sort of forethought</p>
<p>about what it is that you&rsquo;re gonna be building</p>
<p>over large periods of time.</p>
<p>Like not exactly, like you don&rsquo;t need to know</p>
<p>that like, you know, I&rsquo;m putting all my chips</p>
<p>on this one product and like this is gonna be the thing,</p>
<p>but like it&rsquo;s useful to know like what sort of capabilities</p>
<p>you think you&rsquo;re going to need to have</p>
<p>to build the products of the future.</p>
<p>And then like invest in that infrastructure,</p>
<p>like whether, and like I&rsquo;m not just talking</p>
<p>about storage systems or cloud APIs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also like what does your development process look like?</p>
<p>What tools do you want?</p>
<p>Like what culture do you want to build around?</p>
<p>Like how you&rsquo;re, you know, sort of collaborating together</p>
<p>to like make complicated technical things.</p>
<p>And so like having an opinion and investing in that</p>
<p>is like, it just gets more and more important.</p>
<p>And like the sooner you can get a concrete set of opinions,</p>
<p>like the better you&rsquo;re going to be.</p>
<p>Like you can wing it for a while at small scales,</p>
<p>like, you know, when you start a company,</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t have to be like super specific about it,</p>
<p>but like the biggest miseries that I&rsquo;ve ever seen</p>
<p>as an engineering leader are in places</p>
<p>where you didn&rsquo;t have a clear enough opinion</p>
<p>about those things soon enough.</p>
<p>And then you just sort of go create a bunch</p>
<p>of technical debt and like culture debt</p>
<p>that is excruciatingly painful to clean up.</p>
<p>So like, that&rsquo;s one bundle of things.</p>
<p>Like the other, you know, another bundle of things</p>
<p>is like, it&rsquo;s just really, really important</p>
<p>to like have a clear mission</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just some cute crap you say</p>
<p>because like you think you should have a mission,</p>
<p>but like something that clarifies for people</p>
<p>like where it is that you&rsquo;re headed together.</p>
<p>Like, I know it&rsquo;s like probably like a little bit</p>
<p>too popular right now,</p>
<p>but Yuval Harari&rsquo;s book, Sapiens,</p>
<p>one of the central ideas in his book is that</p>
<p>like storytelling is like the quintessential thing</p>
<p>for coordinating the activities of large groups of people.</p>
<p>Like once you get past Dunbar&rsquo;s number,</p>
<p>and like I&rsquo;ve really, really seen that</p>
<p>just managing engineering teams.</p>
<p>Like you can just brute force things</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re less than 120, 150 folks</p>
<p>where you can sort of know and trust</p>
<p>and understand what the dynamics are</p>
<p>between all the people, but like past that,</p>
<p>like things just sort of start to catastrophically fail</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have some sort of set of shared goals</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re marching towards.</p>
<p>And so like, even though it sounds touchy feely</p>
<p>and you know, like a bunch of technical people</p>
<p>will sort of balk at the idea that like,</p>
<p>you need to like have a clear, like the missions,</p>
<p>like very, very, very important.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always right, right?</p>
<p>Stories, that&rsquo;s how our society,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the fabric that connects us,</p>
<p>all of us is these powerful stories.</p>
<p>And that works for companies too, right?</p>
<p>It works for everything.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, even down to like, you know,</p>
<p>you sort of really think about it,</p>
<p>like our currency, for instance, is a story.</p>
<p>Our constitution is a story.</p>
<p>Our laws are stories.</p>
<p>I mean, like we believe very, very, very strongly in them.</p>
<p>And thank God we do.</p>
<p>But like they are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just abstract things.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re just words.</p>
<p>Like if we don&rsquo;t believe in them, they&rsquo;re nothing.</p>
<p>And in some sense, those stories are platforms</p>
<p>and the kinds, some of which Microsoft is creating, right?</p>
<p>They have platforms on which we define the future.</p>
<p>So last question, what do you,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get philosophical maybe,</p>
<p>bigger than even Microsoft,</p>
<p>what do you think the next 20, 30 plus years</p>
<p>looks like for computing, for technology, for devices?</p>
<p>Do you have crazy ideas about the future of the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I think we, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re entering this time where we&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>we have technology that is progressing</p>
<p>at the fastest rate that it ever has.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got some really big social problems,</p>
<p>like society scale problems that we have to tackle.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think we&rsquo;re going to rise to the challenge</p>
<p>and like figure out how to intersect</p>
<p>like all of the power of this technology</p>
<p>with all of the big challenges that are facing us,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s, you know, global warming,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s like the biggest remainder of the population boom</p>
<p>is in Africa for the next 50 years or so.</p>
<p>And like global warming is going to make it increasingly difficult</p>
<p>to feed the global population in particular,</p>
<p>like in this place where you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>like the biggest population boom.</p>
<p>I think we, you know, like AI is going to,</p>
<p>like if we push it in the right direction,</p>
<p>like it can do like incredible things to empower all of us</p>
<p>to achieve our full potential and to, you know,</p>
<p>like live better lives.</p>
<p>But like that also means focus on like</p>
<p>some super important things.</p>
<p>Like how can you apply it to healthcare to make sure that,</p>
<p>you know, like our quality and cost of</p>
<p>and sort of ubiquity of health coverage is better</p>
<p>and better over time.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s more and more important every day is like</p>
<p>in the United States and like the rest of the industrialized world,</p>
<p>so Western Europe, China, Japan, Korea,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve got this population bubble of like aging,</p>
<p>working, you know, working age folks who are,</p>
<p>you know, at some point over the next 20, 30 years,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be largely retired.</p>
<p>And like you&rsquo;re going to have more retired people</p>
<p>than working age people.</p>
<p>And then like you&rsquo;ve got, you know,</p>
<p>sort of natural questions about who&rsquo;s going to take care of</p>
<p>all the old folks and who&rsquo;s going to do all the work.</p>
<p>And the answers to like all of these sorts of questions,</p>
<p>like where you&rsquo;re sort of running into, you know,</p>
<p>like constraints of the, you know,</p>
<p>the world and of society has always been like</p>
<p>what tech is going to like help us get around this?</p>
<p>Like when I was a kid in the 70s and 80s,</p>
<p>like we talked all the time about like population boom,</p>
<p>population boom, like we&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re not going to be able to like feed the planet.</p>
<p>And like we were like right in the middle of the Green Revolution</p>
<p>where like this massive technology driven increase</p>
<p>in crop productivity like worldwide.</p>
<p>And like some of that was like taking some of the things</p>
<p>that we knew in the West and like getting them distributed</p>
<p>to the, you know, to the developing world.</p>
<p>And like part of it were things like, you know,</p>
<p>just smarter biology like helping us increase.</p>
<p>And like we don&rsquo;t talk about like overpopulation anymore</p>
<p>because like we can more or less,</p>
<p>we sort of figured out how to feed the world.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a technology story.</p>
<p>And so like I&rsquo;m super, super hopeful about the future</p>
<p>and in the ways where we will be able to apply technology</p>
<p>to solve some of these super challenging problems.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve, like one of the things that I&rsquo;m trying to spend</p>
<p>my time doing right now is trying to get everybody else</p>
<p>to be hopeful as well because, you know, back to Harare,</p>
<p>like we are the stories that we tell.</p>
<p>Like if we, you know, if we get overly pessimistic right now</p>
<p>about like the potential future of technology,</p>
<p>like we, you know, like we may fail to get all of the things</p>
<p>in place that we need to like have our best possible future.</p>
<p>And that kind of hopeful optimism, I&rsquo;m glad that you have it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re leading large groups of engineers</p>
<p>that are actually defining, that are writing that story,</p>
<p>that are helping build that future, which is super exciting.</p>
<p>And I agree with everything you said except I do hope</p>
<p>Clippy comes back.</p>
<p>We miss him. I speak for the people.</p>
<p>So, Galen, thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me. It was a pleasure.</p>
