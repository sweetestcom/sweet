<p>[&ldquo;Good Day for Dreaming&rdquo; by Ruelle playing]</p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to Apple Park.</p>
<p>I am so glad you could join us today.</p>
<p>Just last month we were here to introduce some great new products:</p>
<p>Apple Watch Series 6,</p>
<p>Apple Watch SE,</p>
<p>as well as the eighth-generation iPad</p>
<p>and the all-new iPad Air.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got some more huge announcements for you today.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started with an exciting new product for the home</p>
<p>we know you&rsquo;re going to love.</p>
<p>This year, our homes have become even more important in our daily lives.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s critical that the technology we choose for our home</p>
<p>provides a truly great experience.</p>
<p>When we approach designing products for the home,</p>
<p>we focus on three key attributes:</p>
<p>First, they must be easy to use,</p>
<p>from the initial setup to the way you interact with it every day.</p>
<p>And we design our products to work better together, seamlessly and intuitively.</p>
<p>We also design them to be secure and to protect your privacy.</p>
<p>Because you should be the one in control of how your personal data is used.</p>
<p>We applied these principles when we created HomePod.</p>
<p>HomePod is a breakthrough speaker</p>
<p>that combines precise, high-fidelity sound with the intelligence of Siri.</p>
<p>It provides an entirely new way to discover and interact with music at home.</p>
<p>And now we want to bring this experience to even more people.</p>
<p>So today, I&rsquo;m excited to introduce the newest addition to the HomePod family.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to show it to you now.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ready to Rock That&rdquo; by Bonti playing]</p>
<p>[volume decreases]</p>
<p>This is HomePod mini.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Bob to tell you all about it.</p>
<p>[music continues]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to tell you about HomePod mini.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible smart speaker,</p>
<p>with a compact, elegant design that&rsquo;s perfect for your home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrapped in a beautiful, seamless mesh fabric that not only looks great,</p>
<p>but was created specifically for its acoustic performance.</p>
<p>On top of HomePod mini is a backlit touch surface</p>
<p>that provides controls for volume, play/pause,</p>
<p>and even illuminates when you invoke Siri.</p>
<p>But the design is just the beginning.</p>
<p>In creating HomePod mini,</p>
<p>we thought carefully about what you want from a smart speaker.</p>
<p>First, you want amazing sound that ensures your music, podcasts</p>
<p>and everything you listen to sounds incredible.</p>
<p>Next, you want a world-class intelligent assistant</p>
<p>that helps you wherever you are.</p>
<p>And as our homes become smarter,</p>
<p>you want it to serve as the brain of your smart home,</p>
<p>orchestrating and controlling a wide range of devices.</p>
<p>And finally, because it&rsquo;s your home, you want a smart speaker</p>
<p>that puts your privacy and security at the forefront.</p>
<p>All this is exactly what HomePod mini is designed to deliver.</p>
<p>And to tell you more about how we made this happen,</p>
<p>let me pass it to Dave and Yael.</p>
<p>At Apple, we have a passion for music,</p>
<p>so we knew HomePod mini had to sound amazing.</p>
<p>We started by custom-designing every acoustic element.</p>
<p>We created a full-range dynamic driver</p>
<p>that delivers high output while keeping distortion to a minimum</p>
<p>and developed a pair of high-excursion, force-cancelling passive radiators</p>
<p>that enable amazing bass response.</p>
<p>We also crafted an acoustic waveguide</p>
<p>to deliver a consistent, 360-degree sound experience,</p>
<p>enabling you to place HomePod mini anywhere.</p>
<p>In order to get truly big sound out of this compact design,</p>
<p>we combined it with the powerful Apple S5 chip</p>
<p>and advanced software which all together enables something we call&hellip;</p>
<p>computational audio.</p>
<p>Even before you hear the first note,</p>
<p>HomePod mini is analyzing the unique characteristics of the music</p>
<p>and applying complex tuning models to optimize loudness,</p>
<p>adjust the dynamic range,</p>
<p>and control the movement of the driver and passive radiators in real time.</p>
<p>And all this happens over 180 times a second.</p>
<p>The result is an audio experience unheard of in a speaker this size</p>
<p>and one only Apple can deliver.</p>
<p>Now, bringing amazing sound into your home</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just about breakthrough audio quality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about letting you enjoy that sound throughout your house.</p>
<p>Multiple HomePod mini speakers</p>
<p>can play perfectly in sync across your entire house.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great for entertaining</p>
<p>or keeping up with your favorite podcast as you get stuff done.</p>
<p>And when you place two in the same room,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll intelligently become a stereo pair,</p>
<p>filling your space with rich, enveloping sound.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Ferris Wheel&rdquo; by Sylvan Esso playing]</p>
<p>And to make HomePod mini</p>
<p>the ultimate smart speaker for iPhone owners,</p>
<p>later this year, you&rsquo;ll get a new Handoff experience that&rsquo;s truly magical.</p>
<p>Using the U1 Ultra Wideband chip,</p>
<p>which we introduced in iPhone last year,</p>
<p>HomePod mini can understand, with high precision,</p>
<p>when your iPhone is nearby.</p>
<p>Bring iPhone close to HomePod mini</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get visual, audible and haptic effects&hellip;</p>
<p>[hip-hop playing]</p>
<p>&hellip;so it feels like your devices are physically connected</p>
<p>as music flows from one to the other.</p>
<p>And of course, HomePod mini can play all of your favorite content.</p>
<p>In addition to Apple Music,</p>
<p>you can listen to all your favorite podcasts,</p>
<p>along with thousands of radio stations</p>
<p>from iHeartRadio, RADIO.COM and TuneIn.</p>
<p>And in the coming months,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to use services from providers like Pandora and Amazon.</p>
<p>And because HomePod mini has the power of Siri,</p>
<p>anyone in the home can ask to play an artist, album or track,</p>
<p>hear a playlist, or even search for music by lyrics.</p>
<p>Hey Siri, play the song that goes, &ldquo;feeling good, never stressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sunday Best&rdquo; by Surfaces.</p>
<p>[upbeat music playing]</p>
<p>Siri on HomePod mini brings you the music you love</p>
<p>and helps you discover new favorites.</p>
<p>But of course, Siri does more than just play your favorite music.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Yael.</p>
<p>Siri is what makes a smart speaker, well, smart.</p>
<p>Siri was the first mainstream intelligent assistant,</p>
<p>and today it&rsquo;s the most popular in the world,</p>
<p>available on over a billion devices</p>
<p>and handling over 25 billion requests a month.</p>
<p>And Siri keeps getting better.</p>
<p>In the past three years, Siri&rsquo;s gotten faster and more concise.</p>
<p>Speech recognition is twice as accurate.</p>
<p>And Siri knows over 20 times more facts.</p>
<p>Together, Siri and HomePod mini</p>
<p>do everything you&rsquo;d expect from a smart speaker,</p>
<p>from multiple timers and alarms to weather reports</p>
<p>to answering the random questions kids think up.</p>
<p>But what really sets HomePod mini apart</p>
<p>is Siri&rsquo;s deep integration with iPhone.</p>
<p>Using Siri, HomePod mini can access the apps on your iPhone</p>
<p>to send a message, check your calendar, make a call,</p>
<p>even find your iPhone.</p>
<p>And because of this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to ask HomePod mini for a personal update</p>
<p>with just a single request.</p>
<p>Hey Siri, what&rsquo;s my update?</p>
<p>Good morning, Jumi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently sunny and 72 degrees.</p>
<p>Your first event is at 11:00 a.m., gallery visit.</p>
<p>You have one upcoming reminder: call Zoe.</p>
<p>Of course, your voice isn&rsquo;t the only voice in your house.</p>
<p>Siri knows that</p>
<p>and can recognize the voices of each member of your household</p>
<p>so that everyone gets their own personal experience.</p>
<p>Hey Siri, what&rsquo;s my first class today?</p>
<p>Hey Siri, text Anika, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick you up in ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hey Siri, play my Favorites mix.</p>
<p>Okay, Moe. Favorites mix now playing.</p>
<p>And deep integration with iPhone</p>
<p>also enables a magical experience with CarPlay.</p>
<p>Ask HomePod mini what time Target closes</p>
<p>and a Siri suggestion automatically appears in CarPlay,</p>
<p>so when you hop in the car, the route is ready and waiting for you.</p>
<p>With the intelligence of Siri,</p>
<p>HomePod mini helps you get things done around the home.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s turn to the smart home.</p>
<p>When it comes to your home, you want comfort and convenience</p>
<p>without complexity.</p>
<p>So with HomePod mini, we&rsquo;ve made the smart home simple.</p>
<p>HomePod mini automatically integrates with the Home app</p>
<p>so you can control all of your HomeKit accessories with just your voice.</p>
<p>You can ask to turn down the heat,</p>
<p>lock the doors,</p>
<p>dim the lights,</p>
<p>or even set a scene&hellip;</p>
<p>[Jumi] Hey Siri, good morning.</p>
<p>Good morning. The scene is set.</p>
<p>[Garten] &hellip;to control multiple accessories with a single voice command.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re just getting started with your smart home,</p>
<p>the new Discover Tab in the Home app</p>
<p>makes it easy to find all kinds of great smart home accessories</p>
<p>to control lighting, security, comfort and more.</p>
<p>One of the most important parts of the smart home</p>
<p>is communicating with your family,</p>
<p>which is why we created&hellip;</p>
<p>Intercom.</p>
<p>Intercom lets you quickly send a message from one HomePod</p>
<p>to another in a different room</p>
<p>or to multiple rooms throughout your home.</p>
<p>Hey Siri, tell everyone, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re late. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>[HomePod mini chimes]</p>
<p>[Moe] We&rsquo;re late. Let&rsquo;s go!</p>
<p>Hey Siri, reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just getting my jacket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really exciting is that we&rsquo;ve taken it a step further</p>
<p>and designed Intercom to also work with your iPhone,</p>
<p>iPad, Apple Watch and even CarPlay,</p>
<p>something only Apple can do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get a home intercom system that goes everywhere with you.</p>
<p>[Moe] Ask everyone, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s hungry? I&rsquo;ve got pizza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Garten] The message will automatically play</p>
<p>on HomePod speakers throughout the home,</p>
<p>and a notification will appear on your family&rsquo;s personal devices.</p>
<p>And Intercom messages will play on AirPods as well,</p>
<p>so you can always get your kid&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Reply, &ldquo;You read my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[&ldquo;JEWELZ&rdquo; by Anderson .Paak playing]</p>
<p>Intercom helps connect the members of your home</p>
<p>in an entirely new way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited about how HomePod mini</p>
<p>brings the power of Siri intelligence to your smart home.</p>
<p>Back to Bob.</p>
<p>Not only is HomePod mini packed with great features,</p>
<p>like every Apple product</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s designed with your privacy and security in mind.</p>
<p>Nothing you say is sent out of your home until you activate Siri with a touch</p>
<p>or it hears those magic words, &ldquo;Hey Siri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And your requests are not associated with your Apple ID,</p>
<p>and you choose whether Apple saves your audio recordings.</p>
<p>Personal requests only work when your iPhone is home with you,</p>
<p>and all communication with smart home accessories uses strong encryption.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait for you to enjoy the incredible experiences</p>
<p>the new HomePod mini brings to your home.</p>
<p>It comes in both white and space gray,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce that HomePod mini will be available</p>
<p>for just $99.</p>
<p>And you can order HomePod mini November 6th,</p>
<p>and it will start shipping the week of November 16th.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s HomePod mini.</p>
<p>With the power of computational audio,</p>
<p>a world-class intelligent assistant,</p>
<p>great features like Intercom</p>
<p>and tight integration with your favorite Apple devices.</p>
<p>And now back to Tim.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about iPhone.</p>
<p>iPhone is an incredibly powerful and personal device.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the product we use the most every day.</p>
<p>With amazing capabilities, iPhone has changed our lives</p>
<p>and has never been more indispensable than it is now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been another big year for iPhone.</p>
<p>Ever since its launch, iPhone 11 has been the most popular smartphone in the world.</p>
<p>People love their iPhones.</p>
<p>iPhone has led the industry in customer satisfaction</p>
<p>every year since it was first introduced.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much that people love about their iPhones.</p>
<p>They love how easy it is to use,</p>
<p>how it connects people in personal ways,</p>
<p>how it elevates photography,</p>
<p>keeps us informed and keeps us entertained.</p>
<p>With a powerful ecosystem of apps in the App Store,</p>
<p>iPhone enables people to do more and more things every day.</p>
<p>And users can trust that iPhone is designed to do all of this</p>
<p>while protecting their security and privacy.</p>
<p>Every decade, there&rsquo;s a new generation of technology</p>
<p>that provides a step change in what we can do with our iPhones.</p>
<p>The next generation is here.</p>
<p>Today is the beginning of a new era for iPhone.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re bringing 5G to iPhone.</p>
<p>This is a huge moment for all of us, and we&rsquo;re really excited.</p>
<p>5G will bring a new level of performance for downloads and uploads,</p>
<p>higher quality video streaming, more responsive gaming,</p>
<p>real-time interactivity and so much more.</p>
<p>5G networks are more advanced,</p>
<p>with lower latency and less network congestion.</p>
<p>So you can get higher network speeds even in densely populated areas.</p>
<p>And 5G even helps protect your privacy and security,</p>
<p>since you won&rsquo;t need to connect to unknown, unsecured,</p>
<p>public Wi-Fi hotspots as often.</p>
<p>Each generation of cellular network technology on iPhone</p>
<p>has enabled breakthrough innovations</p>
<p>and entirely new opportunities for our developers and our users.</p>
<p>And 5G is the most exciting step yet.</p>
<p>For so many people, this all becomes real with 5G coming to iPhone.</p>
<p>As you know, iPhone provides seamless integration</p>
<p>of world-class hardware and world-class software.</p>
<p>What you may not know about is the incredible collaboration</p>
<p>between Apple and our carrier partners around the world</p>
<p>to ensure iPhone users get the best possible experience.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re fortunate today to have one of our closest partners join us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome Hans Vestberg, Chairman and CEO of Verizon,</p>
<p>here to Apple Park.</p>
<p>Hans, this really is a big day.</p>
<p>And our teams have done some amazing work together.</p>
<p>I want to thank you and the whole Apple team</p>
<p>for a fantastic collaboration leading up to this historic moment.</p>
<p>Until now, most people have taken a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach to 5G.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been waiting for 5G to get real&hellip;</p>
<p>with the network coverage they expect,</p>
<p>the incredible performance they have been promised,</p>
<p>and the devices they love.</p>
<p>Well, today with iPhone, the wait is over.</p>
<p>5G just got real.</p>
<p>Of course, what&rsquo;s the most exciting part for me</p>
<p>as a guy who has worked in networking for 25-plus years?</p>
<p>That fact that for the first time ever,</p>
<p>iPhone can now access Verizon&rsquo;s 5G Ultra Wideband.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built with large quantities of mmWave spectrum</p>
<p>that enable unprecedented performance.</p>
<p>5G Ultra Wideband has already been recognized</p>
<p>as being the fastest 5G in the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s getting even faster.</p>
<p>Our 5G network now gives you double the peak download speeds:</p>
<p>over 4 gigabits per seconds today in ideal conditions</p>
<p>and even higher over time.</p>
<p>And double the upload speeds at over 200 megabits per second.</p>
<p>So whenever you&rsquo;re watching a high-definition movie</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re planning business workflows with real-time augmented reality,</p>
<p>you can be sure that there&rsquo;s no faster 5G anywhere on earth.</p>
<p>5G Ultra Wideband has, also, a massive capacity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building it to help remove bottlenecks in crowded places</p>
<p>where thousands of people use their phones at the same time.</p>
<p>Because one day we&rsquo;ll be safely back in those places.</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;re nearly doubling our 5G-enabled stadiums,</p>
<p>venues, airports, train stations,</p>
<p>and lighting up some of the busiest locations in the country.</p>
<p>This enables amazing things,</p>
<p>like reinventing the in-stadium fan experience</p>
<p>with our NFL partners.</p>
<p>The new Verizon 5G SuperStadium experience in the NFL app</p>
<p>lets fans see and feel the action</p>
<p>from up to seven camera angles, including views from players&rsquo; eyes,</p>
<p>and an immersive augmented reality like never before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited for NFL to be rolling this out to many stadiums</p>
<p>through the course of the season.</p>
<p>And finally, 5G Ultra Wideband provides you with super low latency,</p>
<p>so experiences like multiplayer gaming</p>
<p>feel like they&rsquo;re happening in near real time,</p>
<p>freed from the confines of your home.</p>
<p>Together with Apple,</p>
<p>Verizon has partnered with one of the world&rsquo;s leading gaming companies</p>
<p>for some exciting news that you&rsquo;ll hear about later today.</p>
<p>To make this incredible experience available to more people,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doubling down on our fastest network,</p>
<p>the 5G Ultra Wideband,</p>
<p>with double the coverage in existing cities</p>
<p>like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles,</p>
<p>and expanding into new cities like Philadelphia and San Francisco,</p>
<p>with 60 cities by year-end.</p>
<p>In addition to our 5G Ultra Wideband network,</p>
<p>we have an extensive 5G network.</p>
<p>And today, we&rsquo;re excited to announce</p>
<p>that Verizon is turning on our 5G Nationwide network,</p>
<p>reaching more than 200 million people across more than 1,800 cities and towns.</p>
<p>So, all of the pieces have now come together:</p>
<p>the coverage of 5G Nationwide,</p>
<p>the unprecedented performance of 5G Ultra Wideband in more and more cities,</p>
<p>the reliability you expect from Verizon.</p>
<p>With the first 5G iPhone on the 5G America has been waiting for,</p>
<p>we can finally say, 5G just got real.</p>
<p>Hans, this is definitely the start of something big.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us,</p>
<p>and thank you for all the great work we&rsquo;re doing together.</p>
<p>We are very excited about 5G on iPhone,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to introduce 5G</p>
<p>across our entire lineup of new iPhone models today.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to show you the very first iPhone with 5G.</p>
<p>Introducing iPhone 12.</p>
<p>To tell you all about it, I&rsquo;d like to hand it over to Kaiann.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at iPhone 12 with 5G.</p>
<p>It has an all-new design that&rsquo;s simply stunning.</p>
<p>It has smooth, flat edges,</p>
<p>allowing the aluminum frame and glass to stay flush, front and back,</p>
<p>creating this unique uniform construction.</p>
<p>Inside and out, iPhone was re-architected</p>
<p>to pack in new technologies into a smaller form factor.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 was designed with 5G in mind,</p>
<p>including the position of all-new antennas which go around the aluminum frame.</p>
<p>The design looks amazing in five stunning new colors:</p>
<p>black, white, (PRODUCT)RED, green and a gorgeous blue.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 features the same great 6.1-inch display size as iPhone 11,</p>
<p>yet we reduced the display borders to create a much smaller iPhone.</p>
<p>If we compare it to iPhone 11,</p>
<p>iPhone 12 is 11% thinner,</p>
<p>15% smaller in volume</p>
<p>and 16% lighter.</p>
<p>Keeping the display size and reducing the footprint was only possible</p>
<p>by bringing our best display technology to iPhone 12.</p>
<p>And that is our Super Retina XDR display.</p>
<p>Our new Apple-custom OLED has many advantages over LCD.</p>
<p>Each OLED pixel has its own light which can be individually controlled,</p>
<p>giving us pixel-precision brightness, rich colors</p>
<p>and an amazing two-million-to-one contrast ratio</p>
<p>for true blacks in photos, videos, games.</p>
<p>And Dark Mode looks fantastic.</p>
<p>The new OLED display also has a higher resolution,</p>
<p>with twice as many pixels as iPhone 11.</p>
<p>It now has 460 pixels per inch.</p>
<p>So text will be sharper for easier reading,</p>
<p>and your photos will look better,</p>
<p>with more detail, increased dynamic range and precise color.</p>
<p>And peak brightness is nearly twice as high for HDR content: 1,200 nits,</p>
<p>and we include support for HDR video formats:</p>
<p>Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG.</p>
<p>We obsess over making your display impeccable,</p>
<p>and of course it&rsquo;s important that we protect your display in the best way.</p>
<p>The cover glass on iPhone 11 is the toughest in the industry,</p>
<p>but iPhone 12 leaps ahead with something even better.</p>
<p>Much better.</p>
<p>Our incredible Materials Engineering team</p>
<p>has been working closely with our partners at Corning,</p>
<p>the leaders in glass technology,</p>
<p>on a new cutting-edge material.</p>
<p>And we call it Ceramic Shield.</p>
<p>Ceramic Shield goes beyond glass</p>
<p>by adding a new high-temperature crystallization step</p>
<p>which grows nanoceramic crystals within the glass matrix</p>
<p>to dramatically improve toughness.</p>
<p>To make this material both tough and optically clear,</p>
<p>we precisely control the type of crystals</p>
<p>and degree of crystallinity.</p>
<p>This was the breakthrough that made Ceramic Shield possible for iPhone.</p>
<p>Ceramic Shield is tougher than any smartphone glass,</p>
<p>and along with our new design it makes iPhone more durable than ever.</p>
<p>We measured four times better drop performance.</p>
<p>That means if your iPhone accidentally slips out of your pocket,</p>
<p>Ceramic Shield will have four times the chance of surviving without cracking.</p>
<p>This is the biggest jump in reliability we&rsquo;ve ever had on iPhone,</p>
<p>and we are thrilled to bring that to iPhone 12.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk more about the 5G capability on iPhone 12.</p>
<p>As Tim said, to create the best possible 5G experience</p>
<p>it required seamless integration of hardware and software,</p>
<p>and partnering closely with carriers.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Arun to tell you more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here in one of our 50 world-class anechoic chambers</p>
<p>where we develop and test advanced wireless capabilities like 5G.</p>
<p>And we approach this differently than anyone else.</p>
<p>Starting with hardware, we designed custom 5G antennas and radio components</p>
<p>that allow us to target exactly what works best in the entire system.</p>
<p>We can be very space efficient</p>
<p>while also including the most 5G bands in a single phone,</p>
<p>to work on 5G in more places than any other smartphone.</p>
<p>Another Apple advantage is our ability to engineer a fully integrated system</p>
<p>from silicon to software.</p>
<p>We analyzed our entire software stack from applications down to firmware</p>
<p>to take advantage of 5G speeds.</p>
<p>For example, we optimized iOS frameworks,</p>
<p>so apps can get the benefit of 5G without using more power.</p>
<p>5G makes iPhone faster.</p>
<p>We also made 5G smarter with Smart Data mode.</p>
<p>When your iPhone doesn&rsquo;t need 5G speeds,</p>
<p>it automatically uses LTE to save battery.</p>
<p>But the instant 5G speeds do matter, iPhone starts using it.</p>
<p>We also conduct rigorous validation.</p>
<p>For example, this custom-built anechoic chamber</p>
<p>helps us replicate signals from multiple sources and directions.</p>
<p>We use this data to optimize our antenna system</p>
<p>and our unique beamforming algorithms.</p>
<p>To deliver 5G around the world,</p>
<p>we collaborate closely with carrier partners,</p>
<p>ensuring iPhone has great throughput,</p>
<p>coverage, call quality and battery life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve completed 5G testing on over 100 carriers</p>
<p>in over 30 regions,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re seeing impressive peak speeds on iPhone 12.</p>
<p>Up to 3.5 gigabits per second in ideal conditions.</p>
<p>Of course, 5G speeds will vary by carrier and region.</p>
<p>In the US, we also support mmWave,</p>
<p>the high frequency version of 5G on all iPhone 12 models.</p>
<p>This includes support for Verizon&rsquo;s 5G Ultra Wideband network.</p>
<p>This technology is ideal for densely populated areas</p>
<p>and crowded stadiums.</p>
<p>With wider bandwidth, it can deliver even higher speeds.</p>
<p>In fact, we have measured over 4 gigabits per second in ideal conditions</p>
<p>and up to 1 gigabit per second in typical conditions.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re excited to offer iPhone users the best possible 5G experience.</p>
<p>Now back to Kaiann.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about the chip that powers the new iPhone.</p>
<p>The A13 Bionic on iPhone 11 is still the fastest chip in a smartphone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s until now.</p>
<p>We have a new chip developed by our world-class silicon team:</p>
<p>A14 Bionic, the fastest chip ever in a smartphone.</p>
<p>Let me quickly take you to our secret chip lab</p>
<p>where Hope will tell you all about it.</p>
<p>[beeping]</p>
<p>And finally, here&rsquo;s Hope.</p>
<p>Every year, iPhone sets the standard for mobile performance,</p>
<p>even challenging the performance of laptops.</p>
<p>This year, A14 Bionic</p>
<p>also marks a very important milestone in the history of iPhone.</p>
<p>A14 Bionic is the first smartphone chip in the world</p>
<p>built on the latest 5-nanometer process technology.</p>
<p>The reduction in transistor size enables us to add features</p>
<p>and increase performance,</p>
<p>all while improving energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Our Silicon Engineering team</p>
<p>has packed 11.8 billion transistors into A14 Bionic,</p>
<p>an increase of nearly 40% compared to A13.</p>
<p>A14 improves performance and efficiency across the entire design of the chip,</p>
<p>starting with the CPU.</p>
<p>The new 6-core CPU in A14 is the fastest CPU in any smartphone.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s up to 50% faster.</p>
<p>A14 also features our latest 4-core GPU design,</p>
<p>driving increased image quality and overall efficiency,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s even better for advanced games and machine learning.</p>
<p>And compared to the competition, it&rsquo;s the fastest GPU in any smartphone,</p>
<p>delivering up to 50% faster graphics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also made significant architectural changes</p>
<p>that push the limits of ML processing,</p>
<p>a critical design investment to enable new experiences.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve dramatically increased the performance of our Neural Engine</p>
<p>by growing from 8 to 16 cores.</p>
<p>This change delivers up to 80% faster performance</p>
<p>on the most critical machine learning models.</p>
<p>This new Neural Engine</p>
<p>is capable of an astounding 11 trillion operations per second.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve also increased the performance of our CPU&rsquo;s dedicated ML accelerators,</p>
<p>now 70% faster,</p>
<p>so our developers benefit</p>
<p>from considerably improved ML performance on our entire chip.</p>
<p>Our silicon powers every experience on the iPhone,</p>
<p>and with A14 Bionic we make those experiences even better</p>
<p>with big updates to our CPU, GPU</p>
<p>and a dramatic increase in machine learning capabilities.</p>
<p>Back to Kaiann.</p>
<p>A14 Bionic enables console-quality games.</p>
<p>With the faster speeds and lower latency of 5G,</p>
<p>multiplayer gaming gets even better.</p>
<p>Later this year, one of the best games of all time is coming to iPhone.</p>
<p>It has held the prestigious title</p>
<p>of most popular, most played and most viewed game in the world</p>
<p>and revolutionized e-sports</p>
<p>with over 100 million people watching the world championship last year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, of course, talking about League of Legends.</p>
<p>Using the power of the new A14 Bionic</p>
<p>and Verizon&rsquo;s 5G Ultra Wideband network,</p>
<p>iPhone gaming is taking an enormous leap forward.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Michael Chow, executive producer from Riot Games,</p>
<p>to tell you more about it.</p>
<p>At Riot, we aspire to make games that meet our players wherever they are.</p>
<p>League of Legends is the world&rsquo;s most popular PC game.</p>
<p>But now with the insanely powerful iPhone 12 and Verizon 5G,</p>
<p>we believe it&rsquo;s the perfect time to bring League to iOS.</p>
<p>This is League of Legends: Wild Rift.</p>
<p>The power of A14 Bionic literally blew us away.</p>
<p>It allows us to show off champions like Ashe</p>
<p>with a brand-new level of fidelity that you can&rsquo;t find on any other platform.</p>
<p>With off-the-charts GPU performance and frames per second,</p>
<p>you get amazing details and fluid gameplay,</p>
<p>even in the most chaotic team fights.</p>
<p>On iPhone 12, gameplay is always responsive and unbelievably smooth.</p>
<p>Until now, to be competitive in League of Legends,</p>
<p>you had to be tied to your desk.</p>
<p>But Verizon 5G frees you to game like a pro</p>
<p>pretty much anywhere, no Wi-Fi required.</p>
<p>And with wicked-fast speeds up to 25 times today&rsquo;s networks,</p>
<p>not only is gameplay fast, but so are downloads.</p>
<p>So you can instantly grab dope new skins</p>
<p>that show off all your favorite champs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you on the Wild Rift.</p>
<p>Wow! What a huge moment for mobile gaming.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to play League of Legends on iPhone 12.</p>
<p>A14 Bionic also combines with our cameras and powerful software</p>
<p>to deliver the new dual-camera system of iPhone 12.</p>
<p>It has the Ultra Wide camera that people love</p>
<p>and use to take inspiring photos in creative ways.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 also has a new Wide camera</p>
<p>with an f/1.6 aperture, our fastest yet.</p>
<p>This allows more light to hit the sensor, making every photo better.</p>
<p>Along with the wider aperture,</p>
<p>we developed our first 7-element lens</p>
<p>to maintain sharp detail in your photo from edge to edge.</p>
<p>This delivers a 27% improvement in low-light performance,</p>
<p>so photos and videos all around will have less noise and brighter results.</p>
<p>Like in this photo, with fantastic detail in her hair, clothing,</p>
<p>and the sun&rsquo;s reflection.</p>
<p>On top of this, we use computational photography</p>
<p>to deliver even more powerful new features.</p>
<p>Our Smart HDR 3 continues to bring out details in faces,</p>
<p>like you see here when the sun is so bright behind her.</p>
<p>Now it understands scenes with machine learning</p>
<p>and applies more adjustments to distinct parts of the photo.</p>
<p>For example, Smart HDR 3 brings out more detail in the rocks</p>
<p>and uses sky segmentation to adjust for color, contrast and noise.</p>
<p>Computational photography also enables Night mode,</p>
<p>which has been called the best in the industry.</p>
<p>Night mode on iPhone 12 gets even better.</p>
<p>The faster aperture captures more light.</p>
<p>And now, we are expanding Night mode to all cameras of iPhone 12,</p>
<p>for the first time on the Ultra Wide</p>
<p>and front TrueDepth camera, which is perfect for Night mode selfies.</p>
<p>This is without a flash.</p>
<p>These cameras are incredible.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at other photos shot on iPhone 12.</p>
<p>This photo makes use of the Ultra Wide lens</p>
<p>while maintaining sharpness and clarity like you see in the branches and leaves.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another Ultra Wide photo, shot from below.</p>
<p>Just look at the amazing details in the clothing and chandeliers.</p>
<p>In this low-light portrait photo,</p>
<p>the color and warm light in the background come together seamlessly.</p>
<p>For video, iPhone continues to lead the industry</p>
<p>with the highest-quality video.</p>
<p>And with the larger aperture, iPhone 12 video will get even better,</p>
<p>with big improvements in lower light.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re adding Night mode time-lapse,</p>
<p>with longer exposure and brighter frames when using a tripod.</p>
<p>We wanted to show you iPhone 12 in action,</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s a video we shot and edited entirely on iPhone 12.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Why iii Love the Moon&rdquo; by Phony Ppl playing]</p>
<p>With an amazing camera on the go and 5G speeds,</p>
<p>iPhone 12 takes us into an even more wireless world.</p>
<p>We love wireless charging, but want to improve the experience.</p>
<p>When setting down your phone, you can miss the exact center of the charger,</p>
<p>which can result in slow, less efficient charging, or none at all.</p>
<p>So with iPhone 12, we are making this so much better.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all.</p>
<p>Introducing MagSafe for iPhone.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Deniz.</p>
<p>MagSafe is an advanced new system.</p>
<p>It starts by improving the wireless charging experience.</p>
<p>Our wound wire coil, which is unique in the industry,</p>
<p>now accommodates magnets</p>
<p>and maintains compatibility with existing Qi chargers.</p>
<p>The magnets are optimized for alignment and efficiency.</p>
<p>And we improved our shielding design</p>
<p>to safely provide up to 15 watts for faster charging.</p>
<p>We use a custom nanocrystalline shield to capture magnetic flux.</p>
<p>We also added two new sensors:</p>
<p>a single-turn coil NFC and a sensitive magnetometer,</p>
<p>which senses magnetic field strength and can instantly react to it.</p>
<p>This enables iPhone 12 to recognize and provide</p>
<p>a better experience for accessories.</p>
<p>Any MagSafe accessory can simply snap onto the back of iPhone.</p>
<p>So, this is really great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re enabling a whole new ecosystem for MagSafe,</p>
<p>starting with all-new cases for iPhone 12:</p>
<p>silicone, clear, leather&hellip;</p>
<p>which have magnets to snap on and off, and they&rsquo;re far easier to use.</p>
<p>And you can use other MagSafe accessories on top of the cases,</p>
<p>like the MagSafe charger.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a MagSafe wallet. It just snaps to the back of iPhone</p>
<p>and also works on top of MagSafe cases.</p>
<p>The leather sleeve uses MagSafe sensors</p>
<p>to identify when iPhone is inside to reveal the clock.</p>
<p>We also developed the new MagSafe Duo Charger</p>
<p>for your iPhone and Apple Watch.</p>
<p>You can charge both devices with one charger,</p>
<p>and it folds up easily for when you travel.</p>
<p>And these are just the accessories we are introducing.</p>
<p>Belkin is already working on a couple of new accessories:</p>
<p>a car mount and a multi-charger dock.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to see the innovative ways that others will use MagSafe,</p>
<p>creating a robust and ever-expanding ecosystem.</p>
<p>Back to you, Kaiann.</p>
<p>We also have some big environmental news for iPhone.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Lisa.</p>
<p>Today, Apple is carbon neutral for our global corporate operations.</p>
<p>Our offices, stores and data centers run on 100% renewable energy.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re proud of how far we&rsquo;ve come.</p>
<p>But by 2030,</p>
<p>we plan to have net zero climate impact across our entire business,</p>
<p>including our manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles.</p>
<p>This means that every Apple device sold,</p>
<p>from material collection, component manufacturing,</p>
<p>assembly, transport, customer use, charging,</p>
<p>all the way through recycling and material recovery</p>
<p>will be 100% carbon neutral.</p>
<p>Many of iPhone 12&rsquo;s environmental features build on our past progress,</p>
<p>removing harmful chemicals and using renewable and recyclable materials.</p>
<p>And now, for the first time,</p>
<p>we are using 100% recycled rare earth elements in all magnets,</p>
<p>including the camera, haptics and MagSafe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also been transitioning our iPhone manufacturing partners</p>
<p>to renewable energy.</p>
<p>And just like we did with Apple Watch,</p>
<p>we looked for ways to cut waste and use less material.</p>
<p>Customers already have over 700 million Lightning headphones.</p>
<p>And many customers have moved to a wireless experience</p>
<p>with AirPods, Beats or other wireless headphones.</p>
<p>And there are also over two billion Apple power adapters out in the world,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not counting the billions of third-party adapters.</p>
<p>So we are removing these items from the iPhone box,</p>
<p>which reduces carbon emissions</p>
<p>and avoids the mining and use of precious materials.</p>
<p>Removing these items also means a smaller, lighter iPhone box.</p>
<p>We can fit up to 70% more products on a shipping pallet,</p>
<p>reducing carbon emissions in our global logistics chain.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, the changes we&rsquo;ve made for iPhone 12</p>
<p>cut over two million metric tons of carbon emissions annually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like removing 450,000 cars from the road per year.</p>
<p>This is huge, and we&rsquo;re really proud that Apple is taking the lead.</p>
<p>We hope others will follow,</p>
<p>making this impact even bigger for our planet.</p>
<p>Back to you, Kaiann.</p>
<p>Now every iPhone will include the more advanced and higher power</p>
<p>USB-C to Lightning Cable.</p>
<p>It can be used with any standard USB-C power adapter or computer port.</p>
<p>And USB-C enables fast charging.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s iPhone 12 with 5G.</p>
<p>But to add to all these big announcements,</p>
<p>we also wanted to do something a little different.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;James Bond Theme&rdquo; playing]</p>
<p>Something only Apple would do.</p>
<p>[music continues]</p>
<p>[beeps]</p>
<p>[beeps]</p>
<p>This is iPhone 12 mini.</p>
<p>With its amazing size, it fits in the palm of your hand,</p>
<p>while still keeping the expansive edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR display.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s smaller and lighter than our 4.7-inch models like iPhone 8,</p>
<p>but with a larger 5.4-inch display that lets you see so much more.</p>
<p>With its compact size,</p>
<p>the iPhone 12 mini has the exact same features as iPhone 12.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just choosing between two great sizes.</p>
<p>In fact, iPhone 12 mini is the smallest, thinnest</p>
<p>and lightest 5G phone in the world.</p>
<p>With its large screen and compact size,</p>
<p>we think this will be an incredibly popular iPhone.</p>
<p>Everything on iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini is the latest:</p>
<p>5G, the fastest chip with A14 Bionic,</p>
<p>most advanced display with OLED,</p>
<p>all-new design with Ceramic Shield,</p>
<p>even better water resistance, new cameras for low light,</p>
<p>and MagSafe.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see everything iPhone 12 can do.</p>
<p>[&ldquo;Eat Them Apples&rdquo; by Suzi Wu playing]</p>
<p>[camera shutter clicking]</p>
<p>Even with these huge updates,</p>
<p>the iPhone 12 lineup will start at just $699 for iPhone 12 mini</p>
<p>and $799 for iPhone 12.</p>
<p>We also have great financing options from Apple as well as our partners.</p>
<p>This includes a very special offer from Verizon.</p>
<p>If you trade in an iPhone X or newer,</p>
<p>you can get iPhone 12</p>
<p>starting at $15 per month for 24 months,</p>
<p>or iPhone 12 mini for just $12 per month.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented leap forward for iPhone.</p>
<p>There is simply nothing like iPhone 12.</p>
<p>Back to you, Tim.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>They are the start of a new era for iPhone.</p>
<p>Yet that&rsquo;s just half of our iPhone story today.</p>
<p>We want to take it even further with our pro line of iPhones.</p>
<p>And here they are.</p>
<p>This is iPhone 12 Pro.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to hand it over to Joz to tell you all about it.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro is designed</p>
<p>for our users who want the absolute most from their iPhone.</p>
<p>It takes our new design even further with premium materials.</p>
<p>This includes a durable and beautiful surgical-grade stainless steel band</p>
<p>and precision-milled back glass.</p>
<p>They come in four new finishes, including an elegant silver,</p>
<p>a rich, deep graphite, a stunning gold</p>
<p>and an all-new Pacific Blue.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re engineered with an advanced PVD process</p>
<p>that provides a spectacular luster.</p>
<p>And our new gold uses a high-power magnetron coating process</p>
<p>that gives the stainless steel a stunning bright gold finish.</p>
<p>The pro models also feature our incredibly durable Ceramic Shield.</p>
<p>And these models have best-in-class water and dust resistance</p>
<p>with an IP68 rating,</p>
<p>so they can withstand submersion at up to six meters for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The pro design is complemented beautifully with our new MagSafe accessories</p>
<p>which provide easy and secure attachment and high-power charging.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro features</p>
<p>our industry-leading Super Retina XDR displays.</p>
<p>We were able to go from today&rsquo;s 5.8-inch to a much larger 6.1-inch display.</p>
<p>And iPhone 12 Pro Max increases from today&rsquo;s 6.5-inch</p>
<p>to a more expansive 6.7-inch display.</p>
<p>We were able to grow these displays</p>
<p>but keep the form factors nearly identical.</p>
<p>So for people who want our biggest displays,</p>
<p>this is the largest display ever in an iPhone,</p>
<p>with our highest resolution,</p>
<p>featuring nearly three and a half million pixels.</p>
<p>HDR video comes to life.</p>
<p>High-resolution HDR movies and TV shows that you stream over 5G</p>
<p>will look amazing.</p>
<p>Our pro models are packed with pro-level performance.</p>
<p>While our competition is scrambling to catch up with our chips from last year,</p>
<p>we remain generations ahead.</p>
<p>And our advantages go beyond the CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>Together with our Image Signal Processor, or ISP,</p>
<p>they enable powerful computational photography for camera experiences</p>
<p>that simply are not possible with traditional cameras.</p>
<p>For example, Deep Fusion uses machine learning on the Neural Engine</p>
<p>for pixel-by-pixel processing of photos</p>
<p>with unprecedented detail, texture and minimal noise.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, Deep Fusion uses all the compute engines of the A14.</p>
<p>Our camera sensor captures multiple images</p>
<p>and processes them through the ISP.</p>
<p>The CPU computes the alignment of the frames.</p>
<p>The GPU pre-processes the images</p>
<p>before running them through the Neural Engine.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s additional post-processing done in the GPU.</p>
<p>With A14 Bionic, we are able to bring Deep Fusion to all four cameras</p>
<p>of iPhone 12 Pro,</p>
<p>including the front-facing TrueDepth camera.</p>
<p>We combine state-of-the-art camera hardware</p>
<p>with this amazing compute power</p>
<p>to create a pro camera system that is unlike any other device.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro features our amazing Ultra Wide camera</p>
<p>with a 120-degree field of view,</p>
<p>and our new Wide camera with faster f/1.6 aperture</p>
<p>and 7-element lens that lets in 27% more light.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro also features a 52 mm Telephoto camera for stunning portraits.</p>
<p>So iPhone 12 Pro delivers high-quality optical images</p>
<p>at three different focal lengths,</p>
<p>with a 4x optical zoom range.</p>
<p>The larger size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max</p>
<p>provided us with an opportunity to do even more with our pro camera system.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s Andrew to tell you all about it.</p>
<p>In iPhone 12 Pro Max, we&rsquo;ve been able to create our best camera ever.</p>
<p>We have a brand-new Telephoto camera with a 65 mm focal length.</p>
<p>Moving from a 52 mm focal length to a 65 mm</p>
<p>allows for longer framing in the classic portrait style.</p>
<p>With the new Telephoto, you can now optically zoom in two and a half times</p>
<p>for even closer shots or tighter crops,</p>
<p>which means improving to a 5x optical zoom range</p>
<p>from the Ultra Wide&rsquo;s 13 mm to the Telephoto&rsquo;s 65 mm.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro Max features an all-new massive Wide camera</p>
<p>with an f/1.6 aperture, a new sensor</p>
<p>and new system for Optical Image Stabilization, or OIS.</p>
<p>Let me first tell you about the new sensor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 47% larger, with 1.7 micron pixels, our largest yet.</p>
<p>Larger pixels plus a faster aperture</p>
<p>gives iPhone 12 Pro Max</p>
<p>an incredible 87% improvement in low light,</p>
<p>which is our biggest leap in light gathering capability.</p>
<p>On top of that, we developed a completely new system</p>
<p>for optical image stabilization</p>
<p>that adopts a high-end DSLR approach called sensor-shift.</p>
<p>Sensor-shift applies stabilization to the sensor</p>
<p>instead of the heavier lens</p>
<p>to precisely control motion in X and Y while maintaining sharpness.</p>
<p>This cancels both low and high-frequency disturbances</p>
<p>like hand movement or vibrations in a car.</p>
<p>In addition, the OIS on all our Wide cameras this year</p>
<p>can now make 5,000 micro adjustments per second,</p>
<p>which is five times more than last year.</p>
<p>Along with motion processing advancements,</p>
<p>we get stabilized exposure times of up to two seconds in low light</p>
<p>for handheld shots,</p>
<p>equal to a full f-stop increase in light gathering.</p>
<p>This sensor-shift system is unique to Apple</p>
<p>and helps people capture everyday situations</p>
<p>with extraordinary images.</p>
<p>And it delivers steady video with a truly cinematic feel.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s my colleague Alok to tell you more about another feature</p>
<p>we created for our pro users.</p>
<p>These are amazing cameras for pros,</p>
<p>and we want to give our pros even more control</p>
<p>over the images they capture.</p>
<p>Many pros love to capture in RAW,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re missing the benefit of our sophisticated image fusion.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d like to show you a sneak peek of a new feature</p>
<p>that combines the control of shooting in RAW</p>
<p>with the power of our computational photography.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s Apple ProRAW.</p>
<p>This will be an incredible feature for pros</p>
<p>and will be available in the iPhone Camera app</p>
<p>on iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max later this year.</p>
<p>It provides many of the benefits of our multi-frame image processing</p>
<p>and computational photography,</p>
<p>like Deep Fusion and Smart HDR,</p>
<p>and combines them with the depth and flexibility of a RAW format.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, we constructed a new pipeline</p>
<p>that takes components of the processing</p>
<p>we do in our CPU, GPU, ISP and Neural Engine</p>
<p>and combines them into a new Deep Image file</p>
<p>computed at the time of capture without any shutter delay.</p>
<p>And we do this for all four cameras,</p>
<p>dynamically adapting for various scenes</p>
<p>while maintaining our intuitive camera experience.</p>
<p>Things like sharpening, white balance and tone mapping</p>
<p>become instructions rather than being baked into the photo,</p>
<p>delivering full creative control over color, detail and dynamic range.</p>
<p>Here you can see a photo shot with Apple ProRAW.</p>
<p>Notice how it&rsquo;s taken full advantage of Deep Fusion</p>
<p>to capture a wide range of light and shadow from multiple exposures.</p>
<p>Because all the data is contained in Apple ProRAW,</p>
<p>this image can be processed in various ways</p>
<p>while retaining the crisp, beautifully rendered detail.</p>
<p>You can edit Apple ProRAW directly in our Photos app</p>
<p>and other professional photo editing apps.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also creating an API for third-party apps</p>
<p>to capture images in Apple ProRAW.</p>
<p>This is really the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The flexibility of RAW with the power of Apple&rsquo;s computational photography.</p>
<p>And now, back to Joz.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro allows you to take absolutely stunning photos.</p>
<p>Even at dusk, you can see the incredible color and texture in the shadows.</p>
<p>You can see this Ultra Wide shot preserves the detail</p>
<p>in the cracks of the desert floor.</p>
<p>You can almost feel it.</p>
<p>With Deep Fusion, you can even see the detail of her dress</p>
<p>in this low-light setting.</p>
<p>In this classic black-and-white,</p>
<p>you can feel the sun glistening on the horse.</p>
<p>On a tripod, we can take Night mode even further,</p>
<p>capturing the pop of color in the tent as well as the stars in the night sky.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about pro video.</p>
<p>Year after year,</p>
<p>iPhone provides the highest quality video on a smartphone.</p>
<p>Pros use iPhone to shoot TV shows, news reports and even movies.</p>
<p>This has never been more important, as our homes have become our studios.</p>
<p>In fact, for many TV productions, from American Idol to Mythic Quest,</p>
<p>the show has been able to go on because of iPhone.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re taking pro video further, much further.</p>
<p>For the first time, we&rsquo;re bringing HDR video recording to iPhone.</p>
<p>You can now record in 10-bit High Dynamic Range.</p>
<p>This means we can capture over 700 million colors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 60 times more colors than before.</p>
<p>While you capture, you get a live preview of your HDR content</p>
<p>on the Super Retina XDR display.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re also gonna do something that no other device in the world can do.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro is the first camera</p>
<p>to record in Dolby Vision HDR.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, every single frame of 10-bit video</p>
<p>runs through our ISP, generating a histogram</p>
<p>and allowing iPhone to grade each frame in Dolby Vision,</p>
<p>live while you&rsquo;re recording.</p>
<p>And we can do this at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>This is enabled by our Apple custom sensor</p>
<p>and the incredible power of the A14,</p>
<p>which does the intense processing of these image algorithms in real time.</p>
<p>Prior to today, you needed a pro studio lab and special equipment</p>
<p>to edit your original Dolby Vision footage and then re-encode your files.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro will be the first device to edit in Dolby Vision,</p>
<p>right from the Photos app.</p>
<p>You can even apply filters.</p>
<p>iPhone will regenerate the Dolby Vision tuning on the fly.</p>
<p>Oscar-winning cinematographer Emmanuel &ldquo;Chivo&rdquo; Lubezki made a film</p>
<p>to showcase iPhone 12 Pro with Dolby Vision,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to show it to you now.</p>
<p>My name is Emmanuel Lubezki. I am a cinematographer.</p>
<p>When I started shooting movies, you had to rent a very expensive camera,</p>
<p>buy film stock, pay for developing,</p>
<p>special equipment for editing.</p>
<p>Now, you can really go out with one of these devices and make a movie.</p>
<p>The iPhone Pro will allow filmmakers all around the world to make films</p>
<p>that otherwise are impossible because you don&rsquo;t have the means</p>
<p>or because the cameras are too heavy or too complicated.</p>
<p>I think the next great cinematographer or the next great film director</p>
<p>is already making movies with one of these devices.</p>
<p>So iPhone is the first and only device</p>
<p>that enables you to capture, edit, watch and share Dolby Vision video.</p>
<p>What an incredible end-to-end pro video workflow,</p>
<p>right from your pocket.</p>
<p>And with 5G, sharing your videos from the field has never been faster.</p>
<p>And we have another exciting capability we&rsquo;re bringing to our new pro iPhones.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Francesca to tell you more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve pushed the industry with depth technology over the years,</p>
<p>and today we continue that innovation with&hellip;</p>
<p>a LiDAR scanner.</p>
<p>LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging,</p>
<p>and it measures how long it takes light to reach an object and reflect back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve adopted this technology for iPhone,</p>
<p>and with the machine learning and depth frameworks of iOS 14,</p>
<p>iPhone understands the world around you</p>
<p>and builds a precise depth map of the scene.</p>
<p>It enables object and room scanning, photo and video effects</p>
<p>and precise placement of AR objects.</p>
<p>LiDAR makes iPhone 12 Pro a powerful device</p>
<p>for delivering instant AR and unlocking endless opportunities in apps.</p>
<p>The LiDAR scanner also takes our pro camera system</p>
<p>to a whole new level.</p>
<p>With LiDAR&rsquo;s ability to see in the dark,</p>
<p>we use it for autofocus in low-light scenes,</p>
<p>improving accuracy to focus and reducing capture time.</p>
<p>Instead of hunting for focus,</p>
<p>the LiDAR scanner can identify the subject,</p>
<p>focus and capture right away.</p>
<p>This works in photos and videos.</p>
<p>In fact, with LiDAR, we can improve focus time in low-light scenes</p>
<p>by up to six times,</p>
<p>so your subject is clearly in focus, without missing the moment.</p>
<p>LiDAR also improves depth in low light for Night mode,</p>
<p>enabling stunning Night mode portrait shots like this one.</p>
<p>Look at the incredible detail in the face,</p>
<p>the realistic color throughout the scene</p>
<p>and the blooming bokeh in the lights in the background.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the new LiDAR scanner on iPhone 12 Pro.</p>
<p>Now back to Joz.</p>
<p>As you can see, iPhone 12 Pro is loaded with incredible innovations.</p>
<p>And when you combine these advanced capabilities with 5G,</p>
<p>it will enable you to do so much more on the go.</p>
<p>And 5G is going to unlock even more opportunities for our developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to show you a couple examples.</p>
<p>On-call physicians often need to review complex medical scans anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>OsiriX HD app and 5G enables them to download these very large images</p>
<p>with lightning-fast speeds.</p>
<p>The ability to download a full diagnostic scan</p>
<p>in a matter of seconds versus minutes</p>
<p>can make the difference between life and death for a stroke victim.</p>
<p>And enterprise will be able to use private 5G networks</p>
<p>for high reliability and low-latency apps.</p>
<p>Like JigSpace, which accelerates setup of complex work spaces.</p>
<p>To set up a medical device production facility,</p>
<p>Medtronic would normally create a Six Sigma cardboard layout of the space,</p>
<p>taking weeks to design and costing tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>And now, with 5G and the new LiDAR scanner,</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro enables teams to immediately map the environment</p>
<p>and collaborate with their colleagues</p>
<p>to instantly place simulated equipment,</p>
<p>adapt it to the room layout and outline process flows.</p>
<p>JigSpace on iPhone 12 Pro enabled Medtronic</p>
<p>to completely transform projects from weeks to hours,</p>
<p>reducing costs by more than 90%.</p>
<p>We really pushed the limits with iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max</p>
<p>with stunning new designs and larger displays.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re packed with our most innovative technologies</p>
<p>like the A14 Bionic chip, LiDAR scanner</p>
<p>and incredible pro camera system powered by computational photography.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s a short film we created about the iPhone 12 Pro.</p>
<p>[man narrating] A singular new design.</p>
<p>A reengineered chip.</p>
<p>And 5G.</p>
<p>This is iPhone 12 Pro.</p>
<p>The vertical band is precision-machined from stainless steel.</p>
<p>The Ceramic Shield on the front is tougher than any smartphone glass.</p>
<p>And tighter borders allow for even larger Super Retina XDR displays.</p>
<p>5G is set to change the world with radically faster speeds.</p>
<p>The hardware and software have been optimized for the best 5G experience.</p>
<p>A14 Bionic has a smaller, 5-nanometer transistor,</p>
<p>which pushes the most powerful chip in a smartphone generations ahead.</p>
<p>A new and improved pro camera system</p>
<p>makes the 12 Pro the photographer&rsquo;s iPhone.</p>
<p>The larger iPhone 12 Pro Max pushes these innovations even further.</p>
<p>Its bigger sensor dramatically increases the detail captured</p>
<p>and helps improve low-light performance by 87%.</p>
<p>The custom-designed LiDAR scanner</p>
<p>puts advanced depth-mapping technology in your pocket.</p>
<p>You can now take a Night mode portrait</p>
<p>and unlock a new world of possibilities for augmented reality.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro smashes the benchmark for highest quality video in a smartphone.</p>
<p>The movie industry can now count on it as an essential piece of equipment.</p>
<p>It is the world&rsquo;s first device able to capture, play back and edit</p>
<p>10-bit HDR footage with Dolby Vision.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro comes in two sizes</p>
<p>and in four finishes, including new Pacific Blue.</p>
<p>An integral part of this year&rsquo;s design is MagSafe,</p>
<p>an intelligent system of magnets that connect accessories in a whole new way.</p>
<p>All this and more make the iPhone 12 Pro the most powerful iPhone ever.</p>
<p>Even with all of these incredible pro technologies,</p>
<p>we are keeping the price the same as today,</p>
<p>with iPhone 12 Pro starting at $999.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doubling the starting capacity to 128 GB.</p>
<p>And iPhone 12 Pro Max, with our best cameras ever,</p>
<p>at $1,099.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re rolling out 5G to more than 100 carriers around the world.</p>
<p>This is our fastest rollout ever.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro will be available for pre-order</p>
<p>this Friday, October 16th,</p>
<p>and available next week on October 23rd.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 12 mini will be available for pre-order</p>
<p>starting on Friday, November 6th,</p>
<p>and they will begin shipping the following week, on November 13th.</p>
<p>So this is our new iPhone lineup,</p>
<p>starting with iPhone SE at just $399,</p>
<p>and iPhone 11 is now just $599.</p>
<p>Now back to Tim.</p>
<p>Wow, what an amazing day.</p>
<p>This is the day we&rsquo;ve all been looking forward to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable to think about where iPhone started</p>
<p>and where it is today.</p>
<p>Now with support for high-performance 5G networks,</p>
<p>the powerhouse A14 chip,</p>
<p>Super Retina XDR displays with Ceramic Shield,</p>
<p>MagSafe</p>
<p>and breakthrough camera systems that even record Dolby Vision video.</p>
<p>And pro models that take the experience further with a pro design,</p>
<p>four incredible cameras, LiDAR scanner</p>
<p>and the largest display we&rsquo;ve ever shipped in an iPhone.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come so far with a device that is so important to our daily lives.</p>
<p>This marks the start of a new era for iPhone.</p>
<p>And we announced HomePod mini,</p>
<p>with computational audio, the power of Siri,</p>
<p>and a simple and private smart home experience</p>
<p>all in a beautiful, compact design.</p>
<p>At Apple, we put the user at the center of everything we do.</p>
<p>It means so much to us to create products that make a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>Products that make things simpler, easier and more enjoyable.</p>
<p>And we couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of these products</p>
<p>and the amazing teams who made it all possible.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us, stay safe,</p>
<p>and have a great day.</p>
