    <p>He&rsquo;s optimizing the view.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimizing for shade, actually.</p>
<p>Trying to get out of the.</p>
<p>Oh, fucking Christ, you look like a moron.</p>
<p>I mean, this dipshit showed up.</p>
<p>He showed up to my beach club yesterday, and it was basically like someone had taken a mummy</p>
<p>and then wrapped a mummy inside of a white sheet and then presented him at this place.</p>
<p>Oh, he lathered in his like SPF 500.</p>
<p>And so I said at one point, let&rsquo;s go for a walk.</p>
<p>And this asshole had the nerve to grab his cell phone</p>
<p>and a battery pack for the cell phone.</p>
<p>I forced him to leave the phone.</p>
<p>He felt naked.</p>
<p>Then I made him take off his shoes and socks.</p>
<p>And then I tried to get him to take a shirt off.</p>
<p>We got almost all the way there.</p>
<p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, here we go.</p>
<p>Three, two.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to everybody&rsquo;s favorite game show.</p>
<p>Guess who&rsquo;s not in Italy?</p>
<p>With us today.</p>
<p>David Sachs wearing sunglasses with the view of an ocean clearly on a nautical vessel.</p>
<p>And I am in an old apartment in the center of Florence.</p>
<p>And Chamath is at his hideaway somewhere in the countryside.</p>
<p>And Friedberg is in front of a abstract piece of art.</p>
<p>Two people high on crystal meth trying to break into his car in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer a San Francisco resident.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud and sad to say after 20 years of living in the city,</p>
<p>I have relocated still in a not to a nondescript location still in California, but</p>
<p>enough said in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>So with us again, obviously, Rain Man, the dictator and back from a week off the queen of</p>
<p>Kenwah.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Tell us, Queen, you had a big week, you had some nice ink come out some press</p>
<p>about the production board raising some monster round.</p>
<p>And you took the week off.</p>
<p>Give us the feedback.</p>
<p>What was it like taking a week off from the pod?</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re getting press and you&rsquo;re becoming a public figure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it been like for you the past week?</p>
<p>And tell everybody what went down with this new fund.</p>
<p>You know, my strategy was to take a week off from the pod and then have the ratings go up.</p>
<p>And then I could quietly and nicely exit as a member of the cast.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve been drawn as Al Pacino said, just when I thought I was out, I am back</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s I missed you guys.</p>
<p>I actually listened to the all in pod for the first time ever.</p>
<p>Last week, you guys did a great job.</p>
<p>You mean you&rsquo;ve been complaining these other last 41 times without even listening to it?</p>
<p>You know, I will say I listened to it while we&rsquo;re on it.</p>
<p>But this was actually really interesting.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve never actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s big of you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually listening while we&rsquo;re taping.</p>
<p>We do it ourselves.</p>
<p>I hear the whole freaking thing in real life.</p>
<p>So listening to it, I found it really entertaining.</p>
<p>And I think I have a better appreciation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s less about some of the points and facts we make, which I&rsquo;ve been pitching and complaining</p>
<p>about the topics and, you know, where we go with the conversation and stuff.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just generally just nice to just hear everyone, you know, kind of shoot the</p>
<p>shit.</p>
<p>Anyway, good job.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re a fan of the all in pod?</p>
<p>I might get a wet your beak mug from one of our fans.</p>
<p>I have one.</p>
<p>I have three.</p>
<p>Someone sent me a whole gift basket from the kid who&rsquo;s paying for college based on our IP.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So we announced our TBB funding last week, too, which I have been running the production</p>
<p>board for 4 years now, a little over 4 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been my primary vehicle where I&rsquo;ve been primarily incubating new businesses and making</p>
<p>some investments from the balance sheet.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve raised several rounds of capital over the last few years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never talked about it publicly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never done press around it.</p>
<p>But as you guys know, the primary reason for going public with it was really just to</p>
<p>gain recruit interest in the work that we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>So we really want to see great people be made aware of the work we&rsquo;re doing at the production</p>
<p>board and at each of our individual businesses.</p>
<p>So we could start to at least get folks knowledgeable and aware of us.</p>
<p>So when we reach out and folks are interested in thinking about what else they might want</p>
<p>to do with their careers and their lives, we&rsquo;re hopefully there for them.</p>
<p>So it was great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to share what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We also shared 5 of our businesses that we&rsquo;ve incubated, several of which have been stealth</p>
<p>up until now.</p>
<p>One of which, Jason, I think you&rsquo;ve referenced in the past, our molecular beverage printing</p>
<p>company, Canna.</p>
<p>So that one&rsquo;s starting to emerge a little bit more now after several years of R&amp;D and</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re making progress now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll hopefully have more to share over time in terms of what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re excited.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great to have great investors.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great piece in CNBC by Ari Levy.</p>
<p>I guess you gave him he&rsquo;s a great journalist, by the way, like old school legit journalist.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think fan of the pod.</p>
<p>How did you pick Ari to be the vehicle for this?</p>
<p>Did you use a PR firm where you just decided, I&rsquo;m going to share it with this one person,</p>
<p>we had a mutual person who&rsquo;s in PR who introduces I didn&rsquo;t want to go to a broad PR thing.</p>
<p>So I was just kind of like, let&rsquo;s get you know, I was going to do my medium post, which</p>
<p>I wrote was like a blog post.</p>
<p>And that was the primary content.</p>
<p>And then it was like, let&rsquo;s just find someone good who can kind of at least, you know, push</p>
<p>people to that content that can speak well to our business.</p>
<p>And you know, he was recommended.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met him before.</p>
<p>Great guy.</p>
<p>So, you know, we just wanted to kind of get that one piece done.</p>
<p>Anyway, he did a great job.</p>
<p>He said he I think he&rsquo;s been on your show, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on This Week in Startups.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I see it when I used to go to CNBC.</p>
<p>I would you walk down at one market, you used to go there to him off to and you walk down</p>
<p>like a row of journalists.</p>
<p>And as you go to get on set, I don&rsquo;t know if this happened to you, Chamath, one or two</p>
<p>of the journals will intercept you and try to get a story.</p>
<p>So he would always stop me.</p>
<p>Hey, I heard that Travis at Uber was this or whatever.</p>
<p>But great job on the ink.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see you, you know, raise 300 million.</p>
<p>There was a lot of references to Larry and Sergey and Google.</p>
<p>Maybe you could tell us what how much who led the round this $300 million round.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s involvement?</p>
<p>When I first started the production board, it was my&hellip;</p>
<p>I had made personal investments with my own money and started some businesses with my own money.</p>
<p>And I had a series of dinners and conversations with Larry Page about</p>
<p>doing something together with Alphabet.</p>
<p>I knew Larry from my Google days, obviously.</p>
<p>And we ended up after a bunch of conversations with folks at the level below saying,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to manage a fund.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t want to go work at Alphabet.</p>
<p>So the idea was I would set up a holding company, a permanent company</p>
<p>that like any business has a balance sheet with cash on it and can do stuff with that money.</p>
<p>And Alphabet invested in the holding company.</p>
<p>They put some cash in.</p>
<p>This was 4 years ago.</p>
<p>And they became a minority shareholder and had a board seat and I set up a board.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the work.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ve raised another round since then.</p>
<p>And then we just raised this round we announced last week.</p>
<p>And so our&hellip; The round was&hellip; I think&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we announced, but it was co-led by BlackRock.</p>
<p>We had Morgan Stanley, Koch Industries, Bailey Gifford, Allen &amp; Company.</p>
<p>Foxhaven, Arrowmark.</p>
<p>Just a bunch of really high quality, long-term institutional investors.</p>
<p>Alphabet put more money in.</p>
<p>The Gates family office called Cascade has been an investor with us for a while.</p>
<p>So they all put money in into the round.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great because we can use that capital to build new businesses and</p>
<p>support some of our existing businesses.</p>
<p>So some of our businesses are really hard, deep tech companies.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to have to go rush out and raise venture money or&hellip;</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t want to have an incentive to try and mark the asset up and get a good mark on it.</p>
<p>So really, we can use some of our money now to support some of our businesses</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re ready to go commercial or until they&rsquo;re ready to raise outside capital,</p>
<p>if that makes sense for them.</p>
<p>Not always gonna make sense.</p>
<p>And so we have a lot of flexibility.</p>
<p>And you own 100% of every business that comes out of here,</p>
<p>then you find a management team, as we discussed, and then spin them out.</p>
<p>Chamath, what do you think of this venture studio approach,</p>
<p>which has only really worked for Bill Gross from Idealab,</p>
<p>and maybe John Borthwick with Betaworks in New York,</p>
<p>and I guess science maybe worked as well with Dollar Shave Club.</p>
<p>But here you have, you know, I think Friedberg, a great entrepreneur as well, doing this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this studio model going long</p>
<p>in building companies in a studio system?</p>
<p>Well, I think it means a lot of different things to different people.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure, honestly, what a venture studio is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different in somebody else&rsquo;s view than what Friedberg is doing.</p>
<p>But what I will say is that the different thing that he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>which I believe in is you have to become extremely hyper focused.</p>
<p>You know, I think that there was a moment where if you look at when Idealab was really successful,</p>
<p>or when Betaworks was really successful.</p>
<p>In the case of Idealabs at a very specific prototypical web 1.0 business,</p>
<p>Betaworks had a very prototypical web 2.0 kind of social business.</p>
<p>They all work because these guys were experts in those things.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m pretty bullish on what Friedberg is doing,</p>
<p>just because he&rsquo;s not trying to boil the ocean.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s being very specific around, you know, synthetic biology.</p>
<p>And I think that that is probably what got other people excited.</p>
<p>Because then, not only from Friedberg&rsquo;s execution capability,</p>
<p>which I really believe in, but then now think about it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an investor, I don&rsquo;t want to put my money into something that</p>
<p>all of a sudden looks like nine other things,</p>
<p>where all of a sudden, it creates a lot of correlation that I didn&rsquo;t really know existed,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m investing hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very big deal that a lot of investors have.</p>
<p>And so when Friedberg can very legitimately say,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m, you know, explicitly focused in this thing.</p>
<p>And then he also said, and Friedberg, you may want to talk about this.</p>
<p>And this is the only thing I&rsquo;m going to focus on.</p>
<p>It gives an investor a lot of confidence, because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a really smart guy who&rsquo;s done this before.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to stay in the swim lane and do something really specific here.</p>
<p>And now I can understand how it fits into the rest of my portfolio.</p>
<p>So I think that there is a lot of value for investors in a bunch of different ways.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m super excited.</p>
<p>I appreciate that. I mean, I think like one of the things that mattered to me,</p>
<p>Jason, and the way I kind of frame it, like a lot of people think,</p>
<p>oh, Venture Studio, it&rsquo;s about how many things you crank out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like Y Combinator&rsquo;s model.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s not about how many businesses you start.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about absolute value creation.</p>
<p>So, you know, you have to do the things that you have the resourcing to do</p>
<p>with the objective being to drive business value as a whole.</p>
<p>So that means doing one thing, doing 3 things, doing 5 things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about how many things, you know, whatever the right balance is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about just cranking out businesses.</p>
<p>Because each one of these things, we have to continue to be active.</p>
<p>And we need to continue to build.</p>
<p>And when we start a business, we reserve a good chunk of the business</p>
<p>as equity for the team that works on it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re 100% owners, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to get the right people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got to feel like and act like owners in that business with us.</p>
<p>You wind up owning 50% or ballpark 40%.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>It actually varies quite a bit.</p>
<p>So you know, without getting into too many details, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>when we start the business, we&rsquo;re the majority owner.</p>
<p>And in many cases, when we&rsquo;ve brought in other investors,</p>
<p>over time, we get diluted down to become a minority owner.</p>
<p>So 30% or something like that, like if you did the series A or something.</p>
<p>But but in many cases, we end up being, you know,</p>
<p>we want to continuously fund some of these businesses.</p>
<p>Because it may not make sense to bring in outside investors.</p>
<p>And, and we&rsquo;ll continue to be the majority owner.</p>
<p>But we create an independent board, we make sure that the team feels like it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>independent business.</p>
<p>And we give them a lot of infrastructure and tooling, finance, HR, legal facilities,</p>
<p>support, recruiting support, etc.</p>
<p>And obviously templates for how to succeed and playbooks and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of what I would call our platform value.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Another bestie housekeeping.</p>
<p>By the way, David Sacks is an investor in TPB.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys knew that.</p>
<p>Around ago.</p>
<p>So good job, Sacks.</p>
<p>Good job, Sacks.</p>
<p>Is that another unicorn for me?</p>
<p>Technically, yes.</p>
<p>Look at you.</p>
<p>Well, in other news, Sacks, this is like the victory lap episode.</p>
<p>Sacks, you announced you&rsquo;re closing $1.1 billion with a B in Kraft&rsquo;s third fund,</p>
<p>and explicitly talking about focus to Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>explicit focus on marketplaces and SaaS.</p>
<p>Maybe you could explain how long it took you to raise the $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>I think the first fund was $300 million.</p>
<p>The second was $600 million.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically doubling each time?</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>I mean, the first one was $350, second fund was $510.</p>
<p>This one is $1.12 billion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be $612 million for venture, which is C, series A, series B, and $510 for growth.</p>
<p>And yeah, we are focused on SaaS and marketplaces.</p>
<p>I kind of run the SaaS practice, and my thesis is really the same as it was when I was doing Yammer,</p>
<p>which is apply consumer growth tactics to enterprise software, make it go viral inside</p>
<p>companies, sort of sell it bottom up through the average employee as opposed to top down</p>
<p>through the CIO.</p>
<p>And then the other GP in the fund, Jeff Floor, is focused on marketplaces.</p>
<p>He was the founder CEO of StubHub, which was one of the original e-commerce marketplaces</p>
<p>on the web.</p>
<p>And so he leads the marketplace practice.</p>
<p>And those are also, I would say, along with SaaS, marketplaces are the best kind of internet</p>
<p>businesses to create.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve just decided to focus on those two areas.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of enough for the world for us.</p>
<p>And in related news, your project call in, which is a podcasting plus casual audio application</p>
<p>has been doing great in beta.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m proud to announce that we had a small allocation for our syndicate, the syndicate.com,</p>
<p>which is my syndicate, and then the all in syndicate, which we created as a lark.</p>
<p>Between those two syndicates, my syndicate had 900 requests to invest over, I think,</p>
<p>$7 million.</p>
<p>We had a small $1 million allocation.</p>
<p>And we basically did a lottery.</p>
<p>So something like one in, I don&rsquo;t know, seven or six got in.</p>
<p>And then the all in syndicate also filled up.</p>
<p>And then the all in syndicate, no carry, no fees.</p>
<p>Everybody gets a free ride, thanks to David Sachs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s our first all in syndicate, chipping away at my core business and eating my lunch.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And the all in syndicate is going to be $250,000, so it&rsquo;s $250,000, $1,000 checks with no fee,</p>
<p>no carry.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re, the company is paying the administrative expense of that.</p>
<p>We just want to let 250 of our listeners wet their beaks.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So, and-</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is it open yet, Sachs?</p>
<p>Like, can anyone download the app and use it yet?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s still in private beta.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to open up soon.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ll certainly announce it on the pod.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting better.</p>
<p>I was looking at it the other day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting really tight.</p>
<p>I mean, can I talk a little bit about it or do you not want to keep it?</p>
<p>Yeah, go for it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, here&rsquo;s the, here&rsquo;s the genius of it.</p>
<p>And I mean that sincerely, not just because you gave me an allocation, but clubhouse,</p>
<p>when you go to clubhouse, if you miss the great conversation, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And clubhouse has really bad audio quality and the rooms are, and there&rsquo;s really, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s clubs as a concept, but in call in, everybody creates a show.</p>
<p>Then the show is syndicated to an RSS feed, like a podcast.</p>
<p>So you can basically start your own podcast with no staff, no post production.</p>
<p>You just talk and then it goes out to an RSS feed.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re thinking David and I of doing like a post show after all in like two days after</p>
<p>just to talk to the fans and do like a little private group thing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of like a really nice overlap of podcasting.</p>
<p>And yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I was going to say, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s basically long tail podcasting,</p>
<p>using social audio as the gateway drug to, you know, to long tail podcasting.</p>
<p>The cut is a company worth 4 billion yet.</p>
<p>Have we internally marked up the round four times?</p>
<p>Like Jason Horowitz did with clubhouse?</p>
<p>Let me ask, let me get your mouth in the conversation.</p>
<p>Jamal, what do you think of a venture firm?</p>
<p>Making a seed investment at 100 million, then a billion, then at 4 billion</p>
<p>for a product that, you know, it&rsquo;s largely sideways.</p>
<p>This is like internal three bets and marking it up 10x and then 4x.</p>
<p>So 40x lift over three rounds.</p>
<p>What do we think of this?</p>
<p>I think the best venture firms shouldn&rsquo;t give a shit about any company.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that they really do.</p>
<p>Because if they&rsquo;re very savvy, they should be doing exactly what Andreessen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen the articles about Tiger, you&rsquo;ve seen all these other folks.</p>
<p>The real question is maybe if you want, can you please explain what they&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re doing is, to me, if you understand,</p>
<p>the investing landscape makes a ton of sense, which is technology used to be the small niche.</p>
<p>And so we used to only get, you know, when I started social capital,</p>
<p>there was probably 25 to $30 billion a year flowing into venture.</p>
<p>Just in 2011.</p>
<p>Fast forward a decade, we have like $120 billion a year going into tech,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going up like crazy.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re the best brands, you&rsquo;re going to get the overwhelming amount of interest</p>
<p>from people who want to get into the asset class as the asset class expands, right?</p>
<p>So if all of a sudden, you know, you decided to invest in private equity,</p>
<p>when private equity was going bonkers, you&rsquo;re not going to take as much of a shot</p>
<p>on an emerging manager, you&rsquo;re going to want to take a shot on Blackstone or KKR.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s allowed those folks Carlisle to scale AUM just unbelievably Blackstone,</p>
<p>I think, under management, exactly half a trillion dollars now at Blackstone.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are these indelible brands in venture.</p>
<p>And when everybody realizes they need to be long tech, they jump in.</p>
<p>Now when they do that, you have to understand who these people are.</p>
<p>There are two things that matter.</p>
<p>One, they are people like pension funds.</p>
<p>And their hurdle rate, meaning, you know,</p>
<p>what are they trying to do better than in terms of a rate of return</p>
<p>is in the low to mid single digits.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really important to know.</p>
<p>8%, 9%, 10%.</p>
<p>Not even, not even, not even, not even.</p>
<p>5%, 6%, okay?</p>
<p>And then the second thing you need to know is that these guys have so much money that</p>
<p>they would rather when they spend an hour meeting with you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d rather give you a $50 million check than a $5 million check.</p>
<p>A $5 million check just compounds their problems.</p>
<p>So if you put these two things together, it makes a ton of sense for companies like Andreessen</p>
<p>to now focus on the velocity of money.</p>
<p>Raise a fund, put the money to work,</p>
<p>raise a new fund in a very systematic way that everybody can understand and can predict.</p>
<p>So that Andreessen can tell their LPs on a calendar,</p>
<p>guys, I&rsquo;m going to be back to you in 18 months.</p>
<p>Guys, I&rsquo;m going to be back to you in a year and be able to scale the capital.</p>
<p>And I think if you look at it in that framework, it explains Andreessen, it explains Excel,</p>
<p>it explains Sequoia.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s a brilliant strategy because these guys still make 2.5% on the money.</p>
<p>They end up returning the market beta, meaning what the average market would do anyways,</p>
<p>plus a little bit of alpha, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll still do a little bit better than the market,</p>
<p>which means they&rsquo;ll be able to raise money infinitely.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m at Andreessen and I&rsquo;ve had a-</p>
<p>Do you mean the public market or the venture market?</p>
<p>So venture market typically does 20%?</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;ll decay, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;ll decay down to 10% or 12%.</p>
<p>But my point is, it&rsquo;s still better than the 5% or 6% these pension funds and other folks</p>
<p>need to earn.</p>
<p>So today, the goal of every fund that&rsquo;s successful that has a brand, David&rsquo;s included,</p>
<p>should be do good deals, make sure you&rsquo;re in things that can work.</p>
<p>And the thing that David has, which other folks don&rsquo;t, is David can help make things</p>
<p>work when they&rsquo;re not necessarily obvious, but then pound the money in and then raise</p>
<p>more money as fast as you can.</p>
<p>Because then it helps the investor, that&rsquo;s what they want, and they&rsquo;re happy to pay you.</p>
<p>And then for you, the GP, you start to make enormous fees and the whole cycle works.</p>
<p>So for Andreessen, I think that&rsquo;s the calculus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, shit, if I can put 100 million in, that&rsquo;s 100 million less I have in my fund.</p>
<p>Now I can go, I&rsquo;m 100 million closer to raising the new fund.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Now the criticism has been, Friedberg, I&rsquo;ll go to you, it&rsquo;s bad hygiene for the same firm</p>
<p>to mark up the same product three times.</p>
<p>In this case, you know-</p>
<p>Clubhouse.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name?</p>
<p>Clubhouse.</p>
<p>So is that a warning sign for you that it&rsquo;s a bubble?</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s kind of the worst case I&rsquo;ve heard is like marking up your own book, self-dealing,</p>
<p>whatever.</p>
<p>How do you look at that issue, Friedberg?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll go to you, Sax.</p>
<p>Well, if it were SpaceX, you would look like a genius.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think we can criticize it until-</p>
<p>Or WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Or WhatsApp.</p>
<p>And Sequoia has done this many times where they&rsquo;ve been the lead in multiple rounds in</p>
<p>the company and they have high conviction in the quality of a business and they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to bring other investors in.</p>
<p>And when you have high conviction, and you can continuously buy more of the stock and</p>
<p>buy more of the company and be a bigger owner, and then it works out, you look like a freaking</p>
<p>genius.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t want to criticize the investing style of these guys.</p>
<p>I mean, time will tell if they made good bets or not as a whole.</p>
<p>You can kind of make the case maybe that they&rsquo;re trying to be asset managers and drive assets</p>
<p>under management up and gain more fees.</p>
<p>But I think LPs are a little shrewder than that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll kind of take a smarter look at that.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the guys that are known for doing this, like Sequoia and Founders</p>
<p>Fund and others, have had incredible returns by doing exactly this.</p>
<p>So the strategy does work.</p>
<p>And, you know, you just have to have to do it with the right businesses.</p>
<p>And then I think that will, you know, demonstrate the quality of your investing acumen.</p>
<p>All right, Sax, any further thoughts on that?</p>
<p>The marking up your own book?</p>
<p>Is that something you plan on doing with this new fund and having the growth?</p>
<p>And how would you look at, hey, call in starts getting some traction.</p>
<p>Does that mean your growth fund is going to go market up and take that those shares?</p>
<p>Or do you think that it&rsquo;s better hygiene to have the market price it?</p>
<p>Well, I guess it just depends.</p>
<p>I mean, the growth fund does give us the ability to double down at a later stage on our own</p>
<p>early stage companies.</p>
<p>But you do have to be really sure when you do that, because it does, you know, it certainly</p>
<p>raises questions if you&rsquo;re wrong, right?</p>
<p>That you wouldn&rsquo;t have with any other investment.</p>
<p>So it just it definitely raises the stakes.</p>
<p>You have to be really certain, I guess.</p>
<p>But, you know, if Colin&rsquo;s a big hit, do we go raise, you know, a growth round?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And now I think what we might do in that case, because we incubated it is we&rsquo;d let somebody</p>
<p>else lead the round, and then we would participate.</p>
<p>So you have some third party setting the price, because we incubated the company.</p>
<p>And frankly, that&rsquo;s what we did with the round that you just participated in is</p>
<p>craft participated, but we did not set the terms.</p>
<p>It was actually Goldcrest and Sequoia co lead the round with craft</p>
<p>when you incubate a company like that.</p>
<p>Let me ask another technical question, because the audience last week, or in the week before</p>
<p>really responded well to us talking about this as opposed to COVID and Delta variant,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about at the end of the show.</p>
<p>For those people, you can basically turn off the show at 50 minutes or 75 minutes when</p>
<p>we talk about the impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But, and I&rsquo;m hoping you&rsquo;re thinking right now about who&rsquo;s not in Italy, I hope we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get back to that.</p>
<p>When you incubate a company like that, who owns the original founder shares craft,</p>
<p>the organization, David Sachs, the individual came up with it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the inside baseball there?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of all the above.</p>
<p>And we, meaning craft, have a deal with our LPS, that&rsquo;s called an LPA limited partner</p>
<p>agreement.</p>
<p>And one of the things that was negotiated, when I found a craft four years ago, was the</p>
<p>terms on which craft would incubate deals.</p>
<p>And, and so it&rsquo;s all predetermined what I get as a founder, what what our funds get</p>
<p>what the LPS get, so there can be no argument about it later.</p>
<p>And this is this call it is what we&rsquo;ve actually done.</p>
<p>Now, we have a few incubations in development.</p>
<p>You know, for me, it&rsquo;s really important to scratch that product itch, you know, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>originally a product guy.</p>
<p>And, and I, you know, I love investing in helping companies, but occasionally about</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say maybe once a year, I get a product idea that I think is worth developing.</p>
<p>And so this gives us the ability to incubate it.</p>
<p>So we did it a few years ago with a crypto company called Harbor, we ended up selling</p>
<p>that company to BitGo, which just announced the largest acquisition of a crypto company</p>
<p>galaxy is acquiring it for something like 1.2 billion.</p>
<p>So anyway, so Harbor, I think, will work out, you know, once that deal closes, and Collins,</p>
<p>the second one, there&rsquo;s a couple other things that are still, you know, they&rsquo;re too early</p>
<p>to talk about, but but I think Colin will be the second one to launch</p>
<p>Chamath as an LP and a lot of funds, what do you think when somebody comes to you and</p>
<p>says, I want to in my LPA, my limited partner agreement, have the ability to incubate these</p>
<p>companies that a good trend, bad trend?</p>
<p>How do you think about it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t really, you know, push back on a single term in any LPA, because I&rsquo;m only</p>
<p>doing it mostly to support people.</p>
<p>And so whatever terms they want, they get from me.</p>
<p>And, you know, kind of just like, let them go and hope they get lucky, you know, I have</p>
<p>a very different approach to, to these kinds of things, because I&rsquo;m not necessarily trying</p>
<p>to compound my capital, I&rsquo;m just there to sort of enable folks and, you know, take 1%</p>
<p>of the fund or sometimes a little bit more if I really have an asymmetric view on a specific</p>
<p>thing that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But otherwise, I just take 1% sign the thing and, you know, wish them wish them the best</p>
<p>and then try to support them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m trying to do if I believe in what the how they&rsquo;re investing and the</p>
<p>deals they&rsquo;ve done, you know, however they do it is up is fine with me, I want to go</p>
<p>back to something, which is, I actually think it&rsquo;s not a question of hygiene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a question of governance.</p>
<p>Because when you do these things, and you mark these companies up, the real question,</p>
<p>if a company stops working, is they tend to have too much money, and then they tend to</p>
<p>not have enough governance.</p>
<p>And the reason is because governance typically comes with board diversity and board diversity</p>
<p>comes with more and different investors who have different, you know, puts and takes at</p>
<p>any given point in time, that diversity is very helpful to keep everybody on the same</p>
<p>page and to actually get a decent outcome when things aren&rsquo;t working as much.</p>
<p>Now, when things are working, obviously, nobody cares, you know, because like, you can just</p>
<p>have Jim gets on the board of WhatsApp with yawn, and it&rsquo;s all kind of said and done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not been to the right.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re saying, when things are when things are good, nobody complains.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, and you know, this may be a good jumping off point for, you know, we wanted to talk</p>
<p>about Zymergen today.</p>
<p>Can I say one thing before we get Zymergen, which is just look, I think there&rsquo;s all sorts</p>
<p>of new models now with with this sort of tech and the money going into tech, the venture</p>
<p>capital exploding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these innovative new models.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all for the good.</p>
<p>A studio that I think is great is what Jack Abraham&rsquo;s done with Atomic.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;ve produced multiple unicorns out of there because Jack is just a phenomenal</p>
<p>idea guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a 10x idea guy.</p>
<p>So he then as part of Atomic comes up with the idea and then brings on a operating partner</p>
<p>and that model works for them.</p>
<p>And then, you know, he just partnered with Keith Raboy on OpenStore and Keith decided</p>
<p>to become the CEO.</p>
<p>And Keith is still a GP at Founders Fund.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re seeing like the blending of these models.</p>
<p>You know, it used to be that you made the decision to become a VC and your career as</p>
<p>a founder was just over.</p>
<p>It was like this line that could never be crossed again.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re seeing the blurring of these lines.</p>
<p>And look, I think it&rsquo;s good for everybody because frankly, when Keith or what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>with Colin, we remind people that we&rsquo;re still founders and product people and not just sort</p>
<p>of semi-retired guys.</p>
<p>And frankly, it&rsquo;s good for what we do as investors.</p>
<p>We saw it with Mike Spicer, who is a partner at Sutter Hill.</p>
<p>He incubated, it started and was the original head of Snowflake, which was a massive‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And before that, this is his third.</p>
<p>So he did Pure Storage.</p>
<p>He did Snowflake.</p>
<p>I think he did Laceworks.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just fucking money.</p>
<p>And just folks that don&rsquo;t know, Snowflake, it&rsquo;s an enterprise software company.</p>
<p>They make software.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a venture capitalist.</p>
<p>He started this company while working as a venture capitalist.</p>
<p>They brought on a great CEO.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible guy.</p>
<p>Later, Frank Zlutman, who&rsquo;s a legend.</p>
<p>And the company just went public last year, I think, or the year before and they&rsquo;re worth</p>
<p>$82 billion today.</p>
<p>And so it really highlights that while this guy is still operating as a venture capitalist</p>
<p>and a GP, he&rsquo;s been able to generate incredible returns for his fund and build amazing businesses</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>So‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I mean, Spicer is a perfect example, because I&rsquo;ve known him since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>And at one point, Spicer started this consumer company called Bix.</p>
<p>And we were like an investor.</p>
<p>I was a small investor in Bix.</p>
<p>And I think it got acquired by Yahoo.</p>
<p>And it was always curious, because Spicer was clearly the smartest one in the room.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, he was kind of grinding this consumer thing.</p>
<p>And then he left Yahoo, went to Sutter Hill.</p>
<p>And he basically said, you know what, fuck this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going back to my roots.</p>
<p>Because before that, he was a pretty traditional enterprise guy.</p>
<p>And he just crushed it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like Michael Jordan was finally like, ah, fuck baseball.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going back to basketball.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like Reid Hoffman and Neil Boosery at Greylock, right?</p>
<p>I mean, these guys are incredible operators, business builders, and they continue to do</p>
<p>that work while being partners in the venture.</p>
<p>We have three directions we can go moving on.</p>
<p>Zymergen.</p>
<p>Zymergen is so interesting.</p>
<p>I think we should do it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do Zymergen.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, Zymergen went public at $31 a share in April,</p>
<p>traded as high as $48.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, I had the CEO on my podcast.</p>
<p>And I was confounded trying to understand the business.</p>
<p>You had told me I had asked you for some questions, Friedberg.</p>
<p>And you gave me some choice statements of what to ask.</p>
<p>Which can I say?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Anyway, you gave me some choice questions.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t ask them exactly the way you said them.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the quote of what happened on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Zymergen stated the following Zymergen recently became aware of issues with its commercial</p>
<p>product pipeline that will impact the company&rsquo;s delivery timeline and revenue projections.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the company no longer expects product revenue in 2021</p>
<p>and expects product revenue to be immaterial in 2022.</p>
<p>They also announced that the founding CEO Josh Hoffman, who was on This Week in Startups to</p>
<p>maybe a month ago, stepping down as CEO will be replaced.</p>
<p>And Zymergen stock then dropped 70% on the news.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this was a SPAC or not.</p>
<p>SoftBank hyped them.</p>
<p>It was a straight IPO and the stock dropped 80% yesterday.</p>
<p>80% a day after going public three months ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I think freeberg, a good way to start would be what did they say they were going to do?</p>
<p>And then why has this happened?</p>
<p>So Zymergen and a couple companies like them started around the same time, which is around</p>
<p>2014 2013 2012 that era 2015 even.</p>
<p>And the promise of these companies is truly to be everyone wants to be this platform for</p>
<p>synthetic biology.</p>
<p>And what that means is they can take cells and in a smart way, edit the cells and get</p>
<p>those cells to make things that humans need.</p>
<p>And so you can think about making materials like silk and leather and plastics.</p>
<p>And you can think about making food like egg proteins and milk proteins and so on.</p>
<p>And you can think about making industrial products, enzymes and things that might be</p>
<p>used in laundry detergent, other applications.</p>
<p>And so for years, we&rsquo;ve gotten DNA sequencing cheaper.</p>
<p>We now have DNA writing and editing cheaper.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now got other tools to basically screen cells.</p>
<p>So we have these, the set of tools, where the synthetic biology platform companies popped</p>
<p>up and said, you know, we&rsquo;re going to put all these tools together and build a platform</p>
<p>for editing cells and doing a better job of making things.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to get into all these markets.</p>
<p>And Zymergen when they first started, were like several other companies like them a services</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>So they would go to big partners like DuPont and say, hey, let us make a new enzyme for</p>
<p>you pay us $25 million upfront.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll get a royalty on the back end when that product eventually goes to market.</p>
<p>And they did that for years, they went after insecticidal products, they went after plastics</p>
<p>and materials and all sorts of stuff.</p>
<p>And as is the case with a lot of deep tech, it turns out it&rsquo;s really friggin hard.</p>
<p>You know, these tools might be there.</p>
<p>But like we saw with the clean tech era, where everyone thought they could make oil from</p>
<p>sugarcane, you know, 20 years ago, using the same sort of approach to get the unit economics,</p>
<p>meaning can you make the product cheap enough, it&rsquo;s really, really hard.</p>
<p>That means you got to get these cells to be just perfect.</p>
<p>And you got to get the systems to be perfect.</p>
<p>And so at the end of the day, they went through a lot of customers at Zymergen that paid them</p>
<p>10s of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>And Zymergen didn&rsquo;t have anything at the end of the projects to say, here&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>works that you guys are willing to pay for that you&rsquo;re going to go take to market because</p>
<p>it really wasn&rsquo;t that compelling.</p>
<p>The unit economics weren&rsquo;t good enough.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t really have big breakthroughs for any big industry.</p>
<p>And so Zymergen, like other companies in the space, pivoted and said, you know what, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to now be a products company.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to make our own products instead of just being a services company.</p>
<p>And as they started to get into that, they decided that their first big product would be</p>
<p>this kind of, you know, plastic for cell phones, or what have you protective film.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, what happened is it takes so much money to do all this R&amp;D to run all</p>
<p>these labs to have all these robotic arms that they have that are moving test tubes around</p>
<p>hundreds of people building and running these labs.</p>
<p>And, and so they&rsquo;ve had to raise money.</p>
<p>And in order to raise money, as you guys know, you have to kind of hype the story, you have</p>
<p>to say, look, we&rsquo;re going to change the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re reinventing everything.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using synthetic biology to rebuild everything, yada, yada.</p>
<p>And the story resonates with me, because I truly do believe that the potential is there.</p>
<p>But the timing and the sequencing of these things is hard.</p>
<p>As is the case with a lot of deep tech companies, when you get too far ahead of the curve,</p>
<p>and you start saying, I&rsquo;m going to do X, Y, and Z, but you can really only do A, B, and C today,</p>
<p>you raise money saying I&rsquo;m worth billions of dollars, you raise hundreds of millions of</p>
<p>dollars, and the hype has to keep stepping up.</p>
<p>And they eventually got into the trap that a lot of companies got into, which is taking</p>
<p>money from SoftBank.</p>
<p>And SoftBank said, here&rsquo;s $400 million at a $3 billion valuation a few years ago.</p>
<p>And they said, great, let&rsquo;s run at it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be a products company.</p>
<p>And they burnt through a lot of that money.</p>
<p>And suddenly, they didn&rsquo;t have any products to show because deep tech is hard.</p>
<p>It took a lot longer than anyone thought.</p>
<p>And what will&hellip;</p>
<p>We better try and craft a narrative and get public.</p>
<p>And so they did that, they got public.</p>
<p>And a lot of what they had been telling people was coming, what&rsquo;s coming, it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>here soon, didn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>So they had to pivot the business, they had to become a products company, they kept telling</p>
<p>folks they were going to be X, Y, and Z months away.</p>
<p>And they were going to be able to hit these targets on the product.</p>
<p>And it turns out it was always a little bit further away, a little bit further away.</p>
<p>And then boom, they have a big board review recently.</p>
<p>And they look at the product pipeline, and they look at where they are.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh, this really isn&rsquo;t going to work.</p>
<p>And the whole thing falls apart, because everyone was banking on this massive return.</p>
<p>And everyone missed the story, which is that they&rsquo;ve been doing this for many years and</p>
<p>had to eventually abandon and pivot away from their business because no one was willing</p>
<p>to pay them for it.</p>
<p>So truly, they never found product market fit in their first generation of their business.</p>
<p>And they never found product market fit in the second generation of the business.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really worth taking a watchful eye based on this learning, which is just a fundamental</p>
<p>basic premise for starting a company.</p>
<p>Do you have product market fit?</p>
<p>And can you make money from your product?</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t answer those two things, there isn&rsquo;t a business.</p>
<p>And then the third thing is how valuable the company is a function of how much you can</p>
<p>grow.</p>
<p>And so they really hadn&rsquo;t even gotten past phase one.</p>
<p>And everyone kind of wanted to believe the hype.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit disappointing to see, but it&rsquo;s really going to impact the industry broadly.</p>
<p>Because now people are going to say a lot of synthetic biology companies are smoking</p>
<p>mirrors, and they&rsquo;re really not there yet.</p>
<p>So a lot of folks in the industry are really concerned, right?</p>
<p>So to dovetail this with the previous discussion, sax, funding your own company over funding</p>
<p>of companies, we talked about, hey, if it goes well, like WhatsApp did, well, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a genius.</p>
<p>But if it doesn&rsquo;t go well, and you get ahead of your skis, you don&rsquo;t have product market</p>
<p>fit, and you&rsquo;ve raised a bunch of money, then somebody becomes the bag holder.</p>
<p>No, Jason, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s even it&rsquo;s even bigger than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not just that it happened just in the private markets.</p>
<p>And we then you had JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs take them public.</p>
<p>And then they raised, you know, another half a billion dollars in the public markets.</p>
<p>And then they shot the bet.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we seen the same thing.</p>
<p>This is the same week that Nicola founder, who went out by SPAC and was going to compete</p>
<p>with Tesla and Ford.</p>
<p>There, he&rsquo;s now under indictment for lying and selling shares, also known as security</p>
<p>fraud.</p>
<p>Probably going to go to jail.</p>
<p>I had him on the podcast that was underwhelming.</p>
<p>So sax, we look at these, which is it?</p>
<p>Should we on a hygiene basis, be throttling these companies and have milestone based financing?</p>
<p>Or is this the sign of a top in the market that people are able to go public, people</p>
<p>are being given large amounts of money by SoftBank.</p>
<p>And these things, probably people should pump the brakes.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, SoftBank is engaged in a style of investing that we would never engage in</p>
<p>is absolutely antithetical to the way that we invest, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making $500 million seed investments in massively overvalued companies.</p>
<p>You know, we, we are one of the reasons why we like SaaS and marketplace that craft is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very milestone based.</p>
<p>I mean, we, you know, if we invest before you have a functional product, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be at a seed valuation, you know, like a 10 cap, $10 million valuation, not in the</p>
<p>billions, like, you know, like Zymergen.</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re going to, in order to do a series A, by and large, we need to see</p>
<p>some revenue, you know?</p>
<p>And then, you know, if we&rsquo;re going to do a growth round, we need to see more revenue</p>
<p>and more customers.</p>
<p>And so, you know, you show incremental progress, you know, we&rsquo;re engaged in milestone based</p>
<p>investing where the amount of money you raise and the valuation, you&rsquo;re able to get scales</p>
<p>with the amount of proof that you have delivered, you know, to investors about the company.</p>
<p>And the crazy thing about these like spectacular implosions, and they&rsquo;re usually around deep</p>
<p>tech is because these entrepreneurs can tell a story.</p>
<p>And people just seem to suspend belief and don&rsquo;t demand any proof for years and years.</p>
<p>So it was Theranos, it was Nikola and now it&rsquo;s Zymergen.</p>
<p>And I think by the way, deep tech is it&rsquo;s not that we should dismiss technically difficult</p>
<p>problems.</p>
<p>We should engage and fund and build great businesses that are technically difficult.</p>
<p>How much are we funded for how many months or quarters?</p>
<p>Yeah, but or I mean, what&rsquo;s important is, you know, what is the representation that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being made.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s only one hype man on planet Earth that is good enough to pull this off</p>
<p>and actually deliver the goods at the end of the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably Elon, like, because, you know, he funded these businesses that were deep</p>
<p>tech businesses, Tesla and SpaceX for many, many years.</p>
<p>He was able to get investors excited.</p>
<p>He funded them himself.</p>
<p>He funded himself.</p>
<p>But remember, most of the capital, I mean, he put in some capital, but the vast majority</p>
<p>billion with Tesla, he put in 50 million and went bankrupt.</p>
<p>He went bankrupt.</p>
<p>He was living off a $200,000 loan from a billionaire friend of ours.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Beep that part out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to say sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Elon only self funded the first couple hundred million in these companies.</p>
<p>He delivered revenue very early on.</p>
<p>You remember at Tesla, he first developed the sports car, the Roadster.</p>
<p>And that was $150,000.</p>
<p>He sold 100 in advance, not dissimilar to Virgin Galactic&rsquo;s playbook.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s an important lesson, right?</p>
<p>Like in deep tech, you can&rsquo;t just say I&rsquo;m going from zero to one with billions of dollars</p>
<p>over decades.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a government funded program.</p>
<p>Well, or you can if it&rsquo;s your own.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what say that&rsquo;s what Branson did.</p>
<p>And Bezos.</p>
<p>When I showed up, Richard had spent 1.1 or 1.2 billion of his own money.</p>
<p>And I thought, I mean, at some point in the game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s skin in the game.</p>
<p>I mean, Bezos has been funding Blue Origin for 20 years, right?</p>
<p>I think they take Necker and Mosquito Island if he if that doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>There was also Quibi.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Quibi didn&rsquo;t even involve deep tech.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t require any scientific breakthrough.</p>
<p>It just required some marketing proof that people were interested in that format.</p>
<p>And they just blew a million dollars.</p>
<p>Well, basically, Katzenberg, along with Meg Whitman,</p>
<p>who was kind of a weird choice to be a co-founder because she&rsquo;s more of like the</p>
<p>late stage CEO you bring on to take the company public once it&rsquo;s already working.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not really like a founder.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not a product innovator.</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s not a product innovator.</p>
<p>But Katzenberg is though, right?</p>
<p>Katzenberg is obviously very creative.</p>
<p>And so they came up with this idea.</p>
<p>He knows talent.</p>
<p>So they came up with this idea to build a studio that put a billion dollars into</p>
<p>creating short 10 minute videos.</p>
<p>The problem was, there was no proof that the market was wanted that format.</p>
<p>They should have spent five or 10 million proving that the format</p>
<p>made sense and then spent a billion dollars if it worked.</p>
<p>And, you know, I just I don&rsquo;t understand why</p>
<p>founders or really investors kind of put up with these types of stories.</p>
<p>Look at WeWork.</p>
<p>Same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There was not a shred of evidence that there was an economically viable model there.</p>
<p>And yet billions and billions of dollars went into that company before the bottom.</p>
<p>Well, it actually, in fairness,</p>
<p>I disagree.</p>
<p>I disagree on that one.</p>
<p>The first couple of years was economic viable.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t a software business.</p>
<p>They had great gross margins.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t scalable like software.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There was no leverage in the model.</p>
<p>It was just purely like go lease something for X dollars and then sublet it for X plus Y,</p>
<p>you know, X plus Y dollars.</p>
<p>And it worked.</p>
<p>It just like, how do you scale that?</p>
<p>And then they got ahead of their skis and did all sorts of crazy stuff to get the tech valuation.</p>
<p>Oh, hold on a second.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like you can just go to the store and buy it off the shelf.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a tech valuation thing you can buy.</p>
<p>Other people had to believe it as well.</p>
<p>And those other people were also pretty credible, smart people.</p>
<p>Were they the later stage people?</p>
<p>Did you read the WeWork book?</p>
<p>The later stage ones?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;re like evading the thing that that we&rsquo;re not saying, which is that</p>
<p>as much as we all want to believe that we&rsquo;re all doing incredibly, incredibly diligent work,</p>
<p>there are a lot of examples where belief trumps logic.</p>
<p>And even the smartest people just look past the obvious.</p>
<p>And we just talked about four pretty obvious examples.</p>
<p>In no world should a credible tech investor not be able to do a simple valuation or see</p>
<p>a business model and brazenly believe a real estate business is a tech business.</p>
<p>At the same time, there should be no world where you pitch something that is just so</p>
<p>incredibly grandiose from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>And the reason you invest is actually because you don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>Because if you did, you&rsquo;d be more critical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fucking insane.</p>
<p>Well, this is the thing, Chamath, people are suspending disbelief.</p>
<p>These examples that you just brought up are exactly that.</p>
<p>Yes, they&rsquo;re suspending disbelief out of greed.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not doing the basic tenets of investing, which is milestones,</p>
<p>talking to the customer.</p>
<p>These are blocking and tackling.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more than greed, Jason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s greed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fraud too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s criminal, it&rsquo;s fraud.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s fraud.</p>
<p>Some of it&rsquo;s fraud.</p>
<p>So read the quote, read the quote from the US Attorney of Manhattan, who said Milton,</p>
<p>with respect to Nikola, lied about nearly every aspect of the business.</p>
<p>People like that need to go to jail.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jail, big time.</p>
<p>Jail, big time.</p>
<p>The startup world, the investing world only works if investors can trust the information</p>
<p>and the financial statements that are being given by operators, because we have to make</p>
<p>decisions quickly.</p>
<p>And if they give us bogus numbers, how are we supposed to make educated decisions?</p>
<p>Well, people don&rsquo;t want to do diligence, Sax.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to do diligence anymore.</p>
<p>We look at metrics.</p>
<p>We always look at metrics, okay?</p>
<p>We look at, look, we can do the metrics in one day.</p>
<p>Churn.</p>
<p>Look, we look at ARR.</p>
<p>We look at net revenue retention.</p>
<p>We look at churn.</p>
<p>We look at CAC.</p>
<p>And we look at your financials.</p>
<p>We can do it in one day.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an invasive process.</p>
<p>We can decide very, very quickly because we know what numbers we&rsquo;re looking for and how</p>
<p>to read the statements we&rsquo;re given.</p>
<p>But question for you.</p>
<p>When the founders say, I have a competitive process.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to do all that.</p>
<p>Has that been happening in today&rsquo;s crazy market where people say, the train&rsquo;s leaving the</p>
<p>station and we can&rsquo;t do diligence.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time for this.</p>
<p>Are you, has that happened to you?</p>
<p>Has that happened to you in the last six months?</p>
<p>In a sense, but we say to them, listen, here&rsquo;s what we need.</p>
<p>And if you give us these numbers today, we can make a decision within 24 hours.</p>
<p>So, and there&rsquo;s no reason we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And by the way, they have those numbers.</p>
<p>And if they say they don&rsquo;t have those numbers, they&rsquo;re too incompetent to be funded because</p>
<p>these are all the core SAS metrics that you should have to be tracking your business.</p>
<p>So we would never make an investment without seeing the SAS metrics for a SAS business.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me just step in for a second, because I think there&rsquo;s two camps.</p>
<p>One is businesses, companies that are operate a business.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re talking about, it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>You could have looked at the business metrics of WeWork and made an assessment</p>
<p>of the quality of that business.</p>
<p>Or Nikola.</p>
<p>Or Nikola.</p>
<p>Well, on the other hand, you have this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you have companies, I&rsquo;m saying not Theranos and not Nikola,</p>
<p>because those are not businesses yet.</p>
<p>Those are still in technology development.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re deep tech.</p>
<p>So what happens is the founder, the CEO, the management team, they put together their own</p>
<p>representation of the metrics that they believe should matter.</p>
<p>And then they try and show how those metrics translate into value over time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no revenue, there&rsquo;s no customers, there&rsquo;s no profits.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re saying is we can, in the case of Zymergen,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got X number of experiments we can run per day.</p>
<p>And as a result, those experiments should translate into Y discoveries per year.</p>
<p>And those discoveries should translate into Z dollars of revenue per year.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the pyramid gets built.</p>
<p>And the same was true of Nikola.</p>
<p>The same was true of a lot of these companies where they say,</p>
<p>we can do X, therefore, we&rsquo;re worth Y.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that sort of narrative that investors then say, my God,</p>
<p>the story is so compelling.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re right, I want to believe it.</p>
<p>I want to put the money in.</p>
<p>And I want this thing to work.</p>
<p>And therefore, I&rsquo;ll fund this thing.</p>
<p>And I think and I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve seen continuously.</p>
<p>It started with the clean tech industry.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re seeing it increasingly with all these companies.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>Magically.</p>
<p>And in a lot of these cases, by the way, I will also say Nikola,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s easy to do that.</p>
<p>But it shouldn&rsquo;t be a representation that the entire set of</p>
<p>opportunities is a false narrative.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There are many great businesses in biotech that actually do deliver the goods.</p>
<p>And they turn into incredible companies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a synthetic biology competitor design margin, who I spent a bunch of time with,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say the name of the company.</p>
<p>And they and I and I asked them, what gross revenue?</p>
<p>Simple question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your gross margin?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your revenue?</p>
<p>What are your cogs?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s gross margin?</p>
<p>And I got an asterisk laden answer.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>Asterisk laden answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like adjusted EBITDA adjusted for what?</p>
<p>Speak English.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you got to tell them speak English.</p>
<p>This is like when I would come home, my dad say, where&rsquo;s your report card?</p>
<p>I say, you know, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>My report card.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>So where is it?</p>
<p>I passed.</p>
<p>And then I, you know, again, it&rsquo;s still shocking to see the number of people that will still do</p>
<p>these deals.</p>
<p>And look, maybe it all works out in the end.</p>
<p>But I tend to think like, if you can&rsquo;t present things simply, and you can&rsquo;t explain things</p>
<p>simply, that&rsquo;s on you.</p>
<p>However, if then you still do that, and you still have good intentions, maybe you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But then investors toe the line.</p>
<p>The problem is there&rsquo;s this momentum thing that happens among investors, as Friedberg</p>
<p>said, where the FOMO kicks in, and some of the smartest people become some of the dumbest</p>
<p>fucking people.</p>
<p>No, they are suspending disbelief, like you would not believe in the industry, right?</p>
<p>Well, because it&rsquo;s not their money.</p>
<p>I mean, look, at the end of the day, why does it happen?</p>
<p>Meaning, how can a Zymergen IPO happen like this for Nikola?</p>
<p>Like, meaning, if you look under the hood in the s1, I was trying to find it in the</p>
<p>s1.</p>
<p>Was there somebody that actually did like, some due diligence into Highline?</p>
<p>Clearly not.</p>
<p>Was there was there a synthetic chemist or a synthetic biologist that basically helped</p>
<p>clearly not?</p>
<p>Did everybody say that that was okay?</p>
<p>Clearly, yes.</p>
<p>You know, did I don&rsquo;t know anybody get under the hood of Nikola?</p>
<p>And actually, like, look at the engine, make sure the thing worked.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>By the way, people did there just were enough people that didn&rsquo;t that they were able to</p>
<p>get a financing done.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s the important point is there&rsquo;s enough in the private market.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about two public market examples.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not allowed to have sequestered diligence when you&rsquo;re going through an IPO.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how it works.</p>
<p>By the way, I like, do you guys know the difference between humans and animals?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one, there&rsquo;s one distinguishing characteristic that I think making</p>
<p>tools, making narratives, narratives, stories, all come down to narratives.</p>
<p>Like there are dolphins that can communicate with one another.</p>
<p>There are monkeys that sit in a tree and they can warn each other about approaching predators,</p>
<p>meaning that there are other species that can communicate.</p>
<p>What humans can do that no other species can do is create a narrative</p>
<p>to create an ethereal belief in something that does not exist and get others to believe</p>
<p>in that story, religion, democracy, the financial institutions, the monetary system,</p>
<p>a business like this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about someone saying</p>
<p>High Alliance Nikla.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And I think in all these cases, by the way, this is the cliff notes version of sapiens,</p>
<p>everybody.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a version of sapiens.</p>
<p>I have a funny Theranos story.</p>
<p>If you guys want to hear it, let me just finish this one point.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a fundamental premise, which is humans want to believe.</p>
<p>And so when you have a Barnum type person show up when you have a, you know, a compelling</p>
<p>narrative and a compelling deliverer of that narrative, whether it&rsquo;s a religious leader</p>
<p>or a presidential or a government leader or a business leader, and you want to see what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re selling come to reality.</p>
<p>You want to write a check and you want to put your time or your money into seeing that</p>
<p>thing come reality.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I fundamentally look at you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re missing a key point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not their money.</p>
<p>So stop saying that.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>They would not put their children&rsquo;s fucking education account into these companies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting other people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting other people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>This is the key thing.</p>
<p>Not enough skin in the game.</p>
<p>Employees put their time into these companies for the same reason.</p>
<p>People join.</p>
<p>It is not their money.</p>
<p>People trade off money and time all the time.</p>
<p>My point is people will take their time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re giving up the opportunity cost of working somewhere else to go work at these</p>
<p>companies.</p>
<p>David, David, I honestly I really fucking disagree with you here.</p>
<p>The reason why somebody goes and works at this company because they believe there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>positive signaling from a soft bank.</p>
<p>Okay, so these people are smart.</p>
<p>They think this money must mean it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>They think I&rsquo;m now going to commit my reputation and my time to get options because obviously</p>
<p>these folks must have done their work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making the mistake.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the lie.</p>
<p>Because those folks are not doing the work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a group of people.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s a group of people placing bets who are placing bets of other people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s other people&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>You would do different diligence.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>The Zymergen IPO, the traditional IPO would have been entirely different if they had to</p>
<p>write if the underwriters were at risk for their own net worth.</p>
<p>It would be.</p>
<p>And if their stock was locked up of the management teams for five years or 10 years.</p>
<p>I do agree with that point.</p>
<p>I do agree with the point you&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>Okay, Saks, go.</p>
<p>Saks, go.</p>
<p>Saks from a boat.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not disagreeing with Chamath.</p>
<p>But the point that resonates with me that Freeburg said is actually the book Sapiens</p>
<p>really did impact my thinking as a VC, which is, you know, Yuval Harari makes this point</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s narratives that kind of define, you know, humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what binds us together in societies.</p>
<p>And frankly, the vast majority of narratives throughout human history have just been wrong.</p>
<p>But they still worked as-</p>
<p>Good stories.</p>
<p>Binding people together.</p>
<p>And I kind of applied that to VC, which is the VC process revolves around a pitch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a narrative session where the entrepreneur goes up there.</p>
<p>Yeah, and presents a narrative.</p>
<p>And then everyone debates the narrative and decides whether they buy into it.</p>
<p>And, you know, after reading Sapiens, I&rsquo;m like, this whole process, like, is stupid.</p>
<p>How do I get out of a narrative-driven investing philosophy?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I went back to, look, I understand SaaS.</p>
<p>I know what the metrics are supposed to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still listen to the pitch.</p>
<p>I want to hear it.</p>
<p>But just show me the numbers first.</p>
<p>And at least I can get to a decision that&rsquo;s somewhat grounded in reality, because I think</p>
<p>most of what the VC process does is just measure a founder&rsquo;s ability to tell narratives.</p>
<p>And that may be correlated with their ability to do marketing, but it&rsquo;s not correlated with</p>
<p>whether their idea is fundamentally correct or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine in the seed stage, I think, yeah.</p>
<p>I think there will be the least amount of fraud when you either have irrefutable metrics,</p>
<p>or the investor has to invest their own money.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the gold standard.</p>
<p>Everything else is just, you know, catch as catch can, and you&rsquo;re just gonna have a bunch</p>
<p>of trash.</p>
<p>Yeah, here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m handling at the early stage.</p>
<p>Saks, you because you get to meet my companies.</p>
<p>I have told them to craft their narratives around their traction now, because I know</p>
<p>that all this performative stuff is nonsense.</p>
<p>So when you meet those companies, they do a three minute pitch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the majority of it is, here&rsquo;s the product, here&rsquo;s the traction, and I accept people based</p>
<p>on traction.</p>
<p>And then I give them more money as the traction goes up.</p>
<p>And we bet four or five times on the same company based on metrics.</p>
<p>And I tell them all, you&rsquo;re coming to the accelerator, here&rsquo;s 100k.</p>
<p>If you want more money from us, we&rsquo;ll keep giving you money if you can grow 10% or more</p>
<p>per month on real metrics, period.</p>
<p>And we will keep giving you money forever.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I like these launch, like demo sessions that you do with us, because now you force</p>
<p>them to base their presentation around a chart.</p>
<p>So at least I can see some metrics.</p>
<p>And the other thing we do similar to you is I always start with a product demo.</p>
<p>Our motto is show me the product, not a PowerPoint, because the same PowerPoint can describe 10</p>
<p>or 100 different products.</p>
<p>It can describe a product that might be great.</p>
<p>It can describe a product that sucks.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>So show me the product.</p>
<p>And now at least I&rsquo;m grounded in what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not just listening to some story.</p>
<p>By the way, I go back to this.</p>
<p>I still think that funding narratives makes a ton of sense in the early stage.</p>
<p>See, I rip, I rip in 50k to $5 million checks all the time.</p>
<p>I could care less if it sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>I take a punt at it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But the minute that I&rsquo;m writing 100 or 200 or $500 million check, I pay fucking attention.</p>
<p>Yes, because it&rsquo;s my money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my money.</p>
<p>And I go back to this when it&rsquo;s not their money, you&rsquo;re going to see this thing riddled</p>
<p>with fraud.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to see cases like this stuff constantly.</p>
<p>And the person that pays the price, where I do agree with Freeberg, is the employee</p>
<p>because they mistakenly think that these folks must know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But the reality is, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just doing a job.</p>
<p>They want to get paid themselves.</p>
<p>And so this is how these things happen.</p>
<p>You guys, let me just give you some specifics on the Zymergen scenario.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re going to go public, right?</p>
<p>Leading up to their IPO, the stock&rsquo;s at 31 bucks in the IPO.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re an employee, and you have stock options in Zymergen,</p>
<p>you have the option to exercise your stock options anytime,</p>
<p>which means you buy the stock at your strike price.</p>
<p>And then you can sell the stock later when the IPO is over.</p>
<p>So a lot of employees exercise their stock options,</p>
<p>meaning they put their own money up to buy the stock at $10, $5, $4, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And they actually owe taxes on the difference between their exercise price</p>
<p>and the fair market value at the time that they exercised.</p>
<p>So if the stock goes public at $30, and they exercise,</p>
<p>they got to pay taxes as if the stock was at $30.</p>
<p>And then they end up in a situation where they can&rsquo;t actually get liquid.</p>
<p>And so there was a lot of employees that got really screwed on this transaction</p>
<p>when Zymergen went public,</p>
<p>because they thought the company was going to be worth $10, $20, $30, $40, $50.</p>
<p>And now the stock&rsquo;s at $8.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to actually owe money to the IRS and they paid for their stock option.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a brutal scenario when it plays out for employees.</p>
<p>And I just feel really bad for a lot of really, really great,</p>
<p>you know, smart people that work there that take a massive hit on this thing.</p>
<p>I hired two more researchers on my team just to do diligence at the syndicate.</p>
<p>And I would say between 20 and 30% of deals that look great.</p>
<p>When we get under the covers and look at the diligence, we look at the cap table,</p>
<p>we look at the revenue, we look at the accounting,</p>
<p>we asked them who&rsquo;s doing their accounting, we asked them for bank statements,</p>
<p>we asked them for incorporation docs, we asked them for IP assignments.</p>
<p>This is like the basic blocking tackling 20 to 30% do not pass diligence.</p>
<p>And we find stuff that is crazy.</p>
<p>I had one founder give themselves a loan.</p>
<p>And then we didn&rsquo;t know about it.</p>
<p>And then we find out about it later.</p>
<p>They did a loan, the company owes them hundreds of 1000s of dollars had another one</p>
<p>where they were presented their revenue as reoccurring.</p>
<p>And it was a it was a cruel based account.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a cruel based accounting was a cash based accounting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, what is going on here?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically lying.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re misrepresenting your company.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called securities fraud.</p>
<p>When you make a representation, don&rsquo;t ever bend it or exaggerate it.</p>
<p>Just tell the truth.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Theranos story?</p>
<p>Chamath, I need the Theranos story.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll give you a follow up story.</p>
<p>The Theranos story.</p>
<p>So I had I had a couple I had a very famous investor.</p>
<p>Tell me this is like 2015 2016.</p>
<p>And I said, guys, you know, we were just talking, I said,</p>
<p>What do you like?</p>
<p>What do you like?</p>
<p>Like, you know, we all kind of talk like that.</p>
<p>At some point, whenever we interact, you know, and he said,</p>
<p>this company Theranos, you have maybe it was 2014.</p>
<p>Anyways, 2015.</p>
<p>Theranos, Theranos, Theranos.</p>
<p>And I said, Are you an investor?</p>
<p>And he said, No, but I wish I was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And I tried to get an introduction.</p>
<p>I thought, okay, this is this is going to be really interesting.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t get an introduction.</p>
<p>But then I find out who the board is.</p>
<p>And instantly I get turned off.</p>
<p>So in my mind, I had a very negative impression because the</p>
<p>board was literally not all 90 year olds.</p>
<p>And I thought, what do 90 year olds know about, you know,</p>
<p>blood testing, and, you know, basically building a tricorder.</p>
<p>And at that time, you know, I think I told this story before,</p>
<p>but I had burned about maybe 50 75 million bucks on six</p>
<p>different startups trying to do this, like, you know, in situ,</p>
<p>kind of like, you know, finger prick blood testing, blah,</p>
<p>blah, blah.</p>
<p>So I was really fascinated with the space.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, a guy that I work with at Facebook,</p>
<p>a very senior guy says to me, I&rsquo;m thinking and I was trying</p>
<p>to recruit him to come work at one of my companies as CEO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of going to Theranos.</p>
<p>And I said, just go to the interview and tell me what</p>
<p>happens.</p>
<p>Before I, you know, try to convince you to not go.</p>
<p>He goes into the, to the interview to be CEO of this</p>
<p>fucking company.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t let him pass reception.</p>
<p>They interview him in a makeshift room outside of the</p>
<p>meeting.</p>
<p>And he said, well, can I, you know, go inside?</p>
<p>And you know, when do we have a follow up interview?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;d like to meet some of the team.</p>
<p>I want to see what it is.</p>
<p>And they said, no, no, no, we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your offer letter.</p>
<p>Do you want to join?</p>
<p>Well, can I see the device?</p>
<p>Can I try it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>And I said to this guy, I said, how can you fucking join this</p>
<p>company?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re coming in as a good</p>
<p>junior flunky.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re coming in as the second or third most</p>
<p>important person in this business.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t been past reception.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s past reception.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know what your office will look like.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even know if you like the office furniture at that</p>
<p>basic level.</p>
<p>Think about everything else that comes after that.</p>
<p>And then, you know, what happened happened.</p>
<p>So what a disaster.</p>
<p>William Perry, former head of Secretary of Defense, Henry</p>
<p>Kissinger.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it was like, it was a bunch of grandpa</p>
<p>types.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you knew.</p>
<p>It was a red flag.</p>
<p>If you got one of those guys, you got one guy like Kissinger</p>
<p>on your board.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re all like that, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Problem.</p>
<p>Huge.</p>
<p>I go on CNBC.</p>
<p>I just had John Kerry Rue from the Wall Street Journal who</p>
<p>broke this thing wide open on my podcast.</p>
<p>And I start getting all these inside tips about</p>
<p>Theranos.</p>
<p>And one of them was that Elizabeth Holmes and Balwani,</p>
<p>who is the COO, were in a relationship together.</p>
<p>They lived at the same address, all this nonsense.</p>
<p>And I check with Kerry Rue.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, Hey, is this true?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was like, why didn&rsquo;t you report?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m just chasing it down.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be in the next story.</p>
<p>So I go on CNBC.</p>
<p>And I was like, listen, when they&rsquo;re smoked as fire, if</p>
<p>they had the device, my game theory is if you have the</p>
<p>device, you show it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the goods, you don&rsquo;t show it.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>I think my gut tells me this is a total fraud.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be zero.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, oh, and I was like, yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, when the COO and the CEO are in a</p>
<p>relationship, that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, what?</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>And I like, they&rsquo;re like, are you sure?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, yeah, that&rsquo;s what people are telling me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know firsthand knowledge, but that&rsquo;s what I</p>
<p>think is going on.</p>
<p>So this whole thing blows up.</p>
<p>Calacanis says this, blah, blah, blah, CNBC.</p>
<p>That night, I got invited to Beep&rsquo;s house in the valley</p>
<p>for movie night.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been to that.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I walk in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Zuck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this famous person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this Googler, that person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s 50 people.</p>
<p>And the celebrities who are in the blockbuster movie</p>
<p>are there.</p>
<p>I think it was the movie Arrival, but I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>make any I don&rsquo;t want to give away whose house it was.</p>
<p>I go to this secret movie night.</p>
<p>I walk in, I get greeted.</p>
<p>And I kid you not 15 feet in front of me looking directly</p>
<p>at me is Elizabeth Holmes.</p>
<p>And I get with like 10 feet or and she just looks at me</p>
<p>snarls and walks away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the most uncomfortable moment of my life.</p>
<p>Clearly a giant scam and fraud.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s going to go to jail, too, by the way.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going on trial this month, August, I believe she&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be on trial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking way too long.</p>
<p>I hope she goes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the justice system is a little bit screwed.</p>
<p>Okay, we got to wrap up.</p>
<p>I got a pretty good.</p>
<p>You have a pretty good track record of calling out these</p>
<p>frauds.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a service to the community.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the few who actually does it.</p>
<p>You got any other budding frauds?</p>
<p>Well, Ripple, you called out Ripple, right?</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s not go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go easy on the Ripple to some people who are friends</p>
<p>with people.</p>
<p>Well, I think right now you&rsquo;re backing off.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not backing off.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to lose a member of our little quartet</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>But I will say that my fraud of the moment, the one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making my Spidey sense go crazy is Tether.</p>
<p>USDT, these these guys are I mean, this feels like it is</p>
<p>going to be a billion of the crypto thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a crypto stablecoin.</p>
<p>The idea is, they said it&rsquo;s $1 in US currency, $1 per</p>
<p>tether, always.</p>
<p>And then over time, we find out maybe they don&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>dollar in their bank account for each one.</p>
<p>The New York Attorney General finds them $18 million says</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t work with anybody in New York.</p>
<p>They say we&rsquo;re not a fraud.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, well, what about the Attorney General who</p>
<p>said you were a fucking fraud?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, yeah, no, no, that was a</p>
<p>misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Yada yada.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, there&rsquo;s no misunderstanding.</p>
<p>You know, we should do you know, we should do we should</p>
<p>get all the fans the all in pod, we&rsquo;re going to declare a</p>
<p>certain time and date where and we encourage everyone who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in tether to pull out a tether to stress the system and see</p>
<p>what stress test.</p>
<p>Well, the problem is, you don&rsquo;t actually own your tethers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other scam.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like eight or nine of these offshore, unregulated</p>
<p>crypto exchanges, not the ones in the United States that are</p>
<p>highly regulated like Coinbase.</p>
<p>This is offshore.</p>
<p>And there are white.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve been told is you can create an exchange yourself</p>
<p>with white label software and pop up your own casino.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a bloodhound.</p>
<p>I mean, like, you just gotta sniff this shit out.</p>
<p>When I find this out, I cut it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one of my favorite things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Bronx brawler.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s roaming the streets looking for a fight.</p>
<p>Brooklyn, Brooklyn.</p>
<p>I mean, exactly.</p>
<p>I love a good fight.</p>
<p>I love a good fight.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got nothing going on right now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other people I want to call out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some other people I want to call out.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to it.</p>
<p>Oh, Scott Galloway.</p>
<p>Dipshit.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, he&rsquo;s small potatoes.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s a small potato.</p>
<p>Irrelevant.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t look like Thurston Howell, the third on his.</p>
<p>He does on a yacht.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So Jason&rsquo;s in Florence.</p>
<p>Chamath is at his estate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you where I am.</p>
<p>Actually, Jake, I appreciate this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a boat outside Elba, which is the.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in Elba.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in Elba.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where Napoleon was in prison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll actually I&rsquo;ll show you the prison where he was.</p>
<p>Where he was kept.</p>
<p>I think you can see it.</p>
<p>If I get to the right spot.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>We put the Nicola founder in there and we&rsquo;ll put Elizabeth Holmes in there.</p>
<p>Same place.</p>
<p>Can you see the.</p>
<p>Just see your fucking ugly face.</p>
<p>And your beautiful yacht.</p>
<p>How much are people going to hate us?</p>
<p>Three of us are in Italy in August.</p>
<p>It is like the stereotypical.</p>
<p>Work hard and you&rsquo;ll be on an Island level too.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staying in an Airbnb.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s costing me 350 euros a night for four bedrooms.</p>
<p>I feel pretty good about myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the center of Florence.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re spending about the same amount on your boat, right?</p>
<p>350, 400 euros a night per room.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got it.</p>
<p>I got the Airbnb deal.</p>
<p>Talk to us about after pay sacks.</p>
<p>OK, so well, first, I mean, if we&rsquo;re going to call somebody out first, I want to call out PayPal.</p>
<p>OK, what&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>I actually wrote a blog post about it called the no buy list.</p>
<p>Basically, PayPal is creating the equivalent of a no fly list with respect to their service.</p>
<p>Well, for anybody who they put, they deem as deplorable or undesirable.</p>
<p>Basically, they&rsquo;re working with the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern</p>
<p>Poverty Law Center, SPLC, to create lists of people and groups who they are going to</p>
<p>ban their accounts.</p>
<p>Now, I got to say this.</p>
<p>The ADL and the SPLC are storied institutions that did great work combating both anti-Semitism</p>
<p>and racism.</p>
<p>But they are now under new management and new leadership, and they have greatly expanded</p>
<p>their missions.</p>
<p>The ADL was originally about stopping anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s about basically opposing extremism or white supremacy in any of the places they</p>
<p>find it.</p>
<p>For example, they&rsquo;ve taken positions on US Supreme Court nominations.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gone very, very far afield of their original mission.</p>
<p>The SPLC has gotten sued a number of times for putting people on these lists.</p>
<p>They put Sam Harris at some point on the list.</p>
<p>They put another human rights person on the list.</p>
<p>Anybody who challenges any or has any guest on their podcast that the Southern Poverty</p>
<p>Law Center doesn&rsquo;t like, they basically blacklist them.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And the lists have become very expansive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve become very expansive.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the problem is you now have&hellip;</p>
<p>Look, before this was just some ivory tower, you know, 501 type thing where they would</p>
<p>basically&hellip;</p>
<p>It was hyperbolic rhetoric.</p>
<p>They would basically call these people and groups names.</p>
<p>But now PayPal is operationalizing these ban lists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re turning it into a no-buy list.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying, we&rsquo;re going to cut off your account.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very dangerous because we&rsquo;ve already seen the precedent with speech online that</p>
<p>we had a bunch of social media companies banning people from participating in online</p>
<p>speech.</p>
<p>Now, what PayPal is potentially doing is banning people from financial access.</p>
<p>And losing your right to speech is bad, but losing your right to make a livelihood is</p>
<p>even worse.</p>
<p>And I think Republicans in Congress need to say to Dan Shulman, first of all, it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>great for them to haul him up there in front of Congress to a hearing like they did with</p>
<p>Jack and Zuck and Sundar.</p>
<p>Haul him up there and say to him in no uncertain terms, we see what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>We oppose it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get on our hind legs and fight this.</p>
<p>If you try to deny Americans their right to access the new economy, we see no reason for</p>
<p>your company to get any bigger.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to oppose every acquisition you ever do.</p>
<p>And we may not be in power today, but one day the tide will turn.</p>
<p>We will get control of Congress.</p>
<p>And at that point, you know, elephants have long memories.</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;re watching you.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s been a long time since Republicans thought of their role this way.</p>
<p>For the last few decades, they&rsquo;ve been very lazy or fair with respect to the economy.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a very successful Republican president on Mount Rushmore, Teddy Roosevelt.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s on Mount Rushmore because he busted up the cartels and the oligarchs of his era,</p>
<p>and he fought for the rights of the common American to make a living.</p>
<p>That is the playbook that Republicans need to follow right now.</p>
<p>Okay, Henry Belcaster, you got that clip right here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get some animations on top of it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Square has bought Afterpay for $30 billion,</p>
<p>which represents a large portion of their outstanding equity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an equity-based deal.</p>
<p>What do we think, Freeberg?</p>
<p>They issued a third of their stock to buy this company.</p>
<p>So basically, Square is a public company.</p>
<p>They issued shares to Afterpay shareholders.</p>
<p>And Afterpay only represents about 4% of Square&rsquo;s revenue.</p>
<p>So they gave away a third of their company to increase their revenue by 4%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the pessimist&rsquo;s view of the business.</p>
<p>Now, if you think about Square, they&rsquo;ve got 2 businesses that are equally sized.</p>
<p>One is like a consumer business, this cash app.</p>
<p>And then cash app.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they do a bunch of stuff, including crypto in there.</p>
<p>And then they have another app, another set of tools for merchants,</p>
<p>which is businesses on the other side.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s becoming more of a marketplace business.</p>
<p>And the idea is that this Afterpay deal can solidify their ability to basically be a lender</p>
<p>to their consumers and provide a tool to merchants to increase sales.</p>
<p>Because the way Afterpay works, it&rsquo;s a buy now, pay later product.</p>
<p>These have been around for a long time.</p>
<p>And you can basically make a purchase online without having to put down a credit card or</p>
<p>to pay for it.</p>
<p>And they instantly run a credit check on you and instantly offer you credit to buy that thing.</p>
<p>And then you pay in installments over time.</p>
<p>And so it allows people&hellip; It allows websites and businesses to get more consumers to buy stuff</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really easy for them to buy stuff if they don&rsquo;t have the money to buy today.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And by the way, this business concept has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a company called Bill Me Later that was bought by PayPal in 2008 for $1 billion.</p>
<p>And it was a similar thesis.</p>
<p>So the thesis&hellip; What&rsquo;s old is new again.</p>
<p>The thesis is, if you can provide these tools to merchants, they will get more sales and PayPal</p>
<p>on the other side would make more money because consumers would spend more through the system.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the same model with Square.</p>
<p>But most important&hellip; So we&rsquo;re seeing Square consolidate the marketplace dynamics of their</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also effectively stepping up and competing and making sure they&rsquo;re locking</p>
<p>in the competitive advantage they have with having this two sided marketplace</p>
<p>against emerging competitors like a firm.</p>
<p>And so far&hellip;</p>
<p>The public capital markets will always reward great growth strategies.</p>
<p>The minute that they announced this deal, the market cap of Square went up by almost 25%.</p>
<p>The deal is free.</p>
<p>Free.</p>
<p>I repeat, they just acquired a $30 billion company for fucking free.</p>
<p>Which is what happened with Whole Foods and Amazon.</p>
<p>Here is the secret hiding in plain sight that not enough CEOs understand about the public</p>
<p>markets.</p>
<p>And so for the CEOs out there listening, there are two ways for you to get constantly</p>
<p>rewarded by the public markets.</p>
<p>Number one is what Square did, which is to incrementally acquire feature after feature</p>
<p>after feature.</p>
<p>The thing with Buy Now Pay Later is that it is not a company.</p>
<p>It has always been a feature.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a feature of a much larger financial services platform.</p>
<p>And I think Square is proving that.</p>
<p>And everybody else over time will realize that Goldman Sachs and Apple are about to</p>
<p>do something there with Buy Now Pay Later as well for themselves.</p>
<p>Apple already does it for the phones.</p>
<p>So the idea is that this is just a credit feature that should be on every single major</p>
<p>network.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if WhatsApp and Facebook had a Buy Now Pay Later feature.</p>
<p>Amazon.</p>
<p>Over time.</p>
<p>Everybody needs to have this feature.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t build a company around it.</p>
<p>And so if Square can basically continue to acquire or build adjacent features that consolidates</p>
<p>the financial services stack for their consumers, the stock market will reward these guys, they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to grow and buy things for free for the next five or 10 years.</p>
<p>The second way that corporate that companies can get rewarded in the public markets is</p>
<p>if you look at your costs, and you flip them from a cost or an expense into revenue, and</p>
<p>the gold standard is Amazon.</p>
<p>So if you guys look back, I&rsquo;ll just give you a very quick example, because it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>In 2005, year end 2005, Amazon, they had eight and a half billion of sales, 2 billion of</p>
<p>net profit.</p>
<p>Their two biggest costs there was product and shipping.</p>
<p>So what did they do?</p>
<p>They started Amazon Kindle, they started Amazon Basics, they started Amazon</p>
<p>Fire, they started Amazon Echo.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, that whole thing shrank, their gross margins went up.</p>
<p>Then on the operating expense side, Amazon was spending 6% of revenue on fulfillment,</p>
<p>they started a fulfillment business.</p>
<p>They were spending 5% of revenue on technology, they started AWS.</p>
<p>They were spending 2% of revenue on marketing, they started Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>They were spending 2% on payment processing, they started Amazon Payments.</p>
<p>So if you look at any company like this, Square, I think Stripe is another part of me,</p>
<p>Shopify is another great example where you can see the path to growth.</p>
<p>If you can see folks acquiring adjacent features, or if you can see folks taking expense lines</p>
<p>and turning them into revenue lines.</p>
<p>These are, in my opinion, sure bet, companies that compound forever in the public.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s great network effects.</p>
<p>If you think about financial services for consumers, I would argue there&rsquo;s 5 general</p>
<p>categories.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s banking, lending, trading, crypto, and insurance.</p>
<p>And I think in order of retention, meaning how long a customer is likely to stick with</p>
<p>a service provider, it&rsquo;s banking, then lending, then trading, then crypto, then insurance.</p>
<p>And in terms of profit generation per customer per year, it&rsquo;s trading, then crypto, then</p>
<p>lending, then insurance, and then banking.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re seeing is a lot of these financial services providers to consumers</p>
<p>in the digital world, replacing the old school world by starting to consolidate these categories</p>
<p>in a smarter way than the old school offline companies have been able to do.</p>
<p>Banks need to make money through overdraft fees.</p>
<p>They make $30 billion a year in overdraft fees.</p>
<p>So if you make banking entirely online and make it free, you retain a customer and then</p>
<p>you can make money by offering them lending, trading, crypto, some of these other services.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly the trend.</p>
<p>I have a big thesis and a big belief that over the next decade, we&rsquo;re going to see those</p>
<p>five categories start to merge.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to have three to five superpowers that are going to offer a consolidated stack</p>
<p>of services and the unit economics are going to change because they&rsquo;re going to focus on</p>
<p>getting the high retention products to be cheap and free.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re going to make money on the high margin products.</p>
<p>The canary I completely agree with you and the canary in the coal mine is who will be</p>
<p>given a federal banking license because that is the only gate that the authorities have</p>
<p>to King make who those consolidators will be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an easy thing that can be unemotionally assess or Amazon just buy one.</p>
<p>No, you have to.</p>
<p>This is an incredibly arduous process to get a federal banking license to be cleared by</p>
<p>the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>What if Amazon bought a bank?</p>
<p>You have to get it approved.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not listening to me.</p>
<p>These are regulatory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking a question for the audience.</p>
<p>You cannot just go and buy these things.</p>
<p>Okay, so even if you want to, you can&rsquo;t just buy a company like you bought Whole Foods.</p>
<p>So for example, I think Square now is a federally licensed bank.</p>
<p>And I believe that at the Federal Reserve recognizes these guys, they can borrow when</p>
<p>they can borrow money at the discount window at the discount rate.</p>
<p>As startups get more successful and can get there, those will be the ones that will do</p>
<p>what David said, because it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many users or how much momentum you have.</p>
<p>If you cannot get a federal license to operate, you can&rsquo;t consolidate.</p>
<p>So you can be a vertically specific great business.</p>
<p>But eventually, you have to sell.</p>
<p>E-Trade, Morgan Stanley is a great example, where, you know, in the absence and an inability</p>
<p>to expand, you have to sell yourself because the cost of capital eats you up.</p>
<p>The comment on this, by the way, the most obvious one here, which I think is interesting,</p>
<p>is the Shopify Stripe debate.</p>
<p>Because if you look inside the P&amp;L of Shopify, an enormous line item now about 350 million</p>
<p>bucks a year is what they&rsquo;re paying to Stripe.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of pressure over time to figure out what these</p>
<p>big businesses want to do with respect to their payment strategies and do it themselves,</p>
<p>because they may be able to save a lot of money.</p>
<p>Unclear.</p>
<p>Can I be like the lone voice of dissent on this afterpay thing?</p>
<p>Oh, go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, look, it&rsquo;s clear the market loved it.</p>
<p>Chamath is right about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sending a signal to everybody in the industry, in the finance industry, that</p>
<p>consolidation is going to be rewarded.</p>
<p>It seems like finance is going to go the same way that media did, where you start to</p>
<p>see studios in Hollywood all get gobbled up by big tech players, sort of the final convergence</p>
<p>of digital analog.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re clearly going to see that in banking now, too.</p>
<p>So as a business person and as an entrepreneur, I respect and admire what Jack Dorsey has</p>
<p>done with Square.</p>
<p>But as an American, I&rsquo;m definitely concerned about this accumulation of power.</p>
<p>And we now see Jack as the first person.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never been anyone in American history who holds in his hands the right to deny people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>speech on a major speech platform and the ability to deny them access to a major consumer</p>
<p>payments platform.</p>
<p>Now, he doesn&rsquo;t have dominant market share in either one of those things.</p>
<p>In either.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s got less than 10% in each.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s an influencer.</p>
<p>And we saw that Twitter was the first site to kick off Trump.</p>
<p>And then in the wake of that, every other tech platform did it.</p>
<p>And Square, after January 6th, cut off the accounts of everybody who was involved or</p>
<p>connected to it, whatever that means.</p>
<p>And a bunch of other players in the fintech stack did it.</p>
<p>So we now have this issue of financial de-platforming.</p>
<p>PayPal is already well down that road.</p>
<p>What will Jack Dorsey do?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, on the one hand, he&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you start up?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you buy or start or incubate your own?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s protection freeze.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to ban people from calling.</p>
<p>So you win.</p>
<p>Just fucking start your own Square competitor, Sachs, and stop complaining.</p>
<p>Jason, look, these companies have gigantic network effects.</p>
<p>PayPal is over a $300 billion markup company.</p>
<p>If all of the-</p>
<p>If they back those 10%, if they knock 10% of people off, you get them.</p>
<p>Now you got your beachhead.</p>
<p>Stop complaining and build it.</p>
<p>It is not.</p>
<p>It is a non-argument to claim that a cartel of gigantic fintech companies that have monopoly</p>
<p>scale, monopoly network effects, acting together, that is not a threat to people&rsquo;s rights to have-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about how you can make money from it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just talking your book.</p>
<p>Like, you can just start these competitors-</p>
<p>This is not about making money for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about making money for me.</p>
<p>This is-</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>But it is an opportunity.</p>
<p>Like, who&rsquo;s to stop somebody from creating-</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t Parler back?</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t there some other, like, right wing or more conservative Twitter that&rsquo;s booming right</p>
<p>now?</p>
<p>I heard there&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>Kara Swisher was talking about-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m predicting right now that financial de-platforming is going to be the big</p>
<p>hot potato, political hot potato over the next year.</p>
<p>This is the next wave of censorship.</p>
<p>And what-</p>
<p>I agree with David.</p>
<p>Republicans on the FTC-</p>
<p>I agree with all that.</p>
<p>What the Republicans on the FTC, on that board, need to ask Jack Dorsey right now is,</p>
<p>will you import the Twitter block list over to Square?</p>
<p>Or will you keep these things separate?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have Jack on the program.</p>
<p>Bestie, guestie, Jack.</p>
<p>Can I just say something sexy?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But if you just want to make a lot of money, and you have to have some financial stock</p>
<p>ownership over the next few years, I think the way to do it is just to kind of, like,</p>
<p>figure out which of these emerging companies have or are about to get or have disclosed</p>
<p>in their earnings that they&rsquo;re filing for licensure.</p>
<p>And I think you want to own those things.</p>
<p>Because the key thing is, like, when you get these licenses, you just get a cheaper cost</p>
<p>of capital.</p>
<p>It just allows you to out-compete and out-maneuver.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, you&rsquo;re competing with these big, lumbering incumbents, who</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t have the access to the same flexible technology, and they&rsquo;re running code that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, 40, 50 years old.</p>
<p>Then the policy decision becomes much more complicated, because I do agree with you that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be platforming or de-platforming issues that happen.</p>
<p>The good thing about this is that it is highly fragmented, and that there is no clear path,</p>
<p>at least that I see, for two or three folks to have 25% to 30% to 35% ownership.</p>
<p>That already happened, sort of in credit cards, and I think we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson</p>
<p>from that.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t happened since.</p>
<p>I hope it remains that decentralized.</p>
<p>But what I think the reaction of the stock market to Square buying Afterpay is now everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be looking at that and going, wait a second, I can spend, you know, a quarter</p>
<p>of the market cap of my company and have the acquisition be free?</p>
<p>No, but David, my point, that&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re saying is, hold on a second.</p>
<p>These companies are features, and we want to have folks who are licensed and capable</p>
<p>to consolidate what Friedberg said, these five categories.</p>
<p>And if you look inside of Square, they have an incredible lending business.</p>
<p>They have incredible merchant services business.</p>
<p>They have a pretty decent and emerging crypto and trading business.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re putting all the pieces together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they saw, and they&rsquo;re licensed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But who are the big winners in this wave of consolidation going to be at the end of the</p>
<p>day?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be Square.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be Stripe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be PayPal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be the big online companies, not the offline legacy banks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing that happened in Hollywood.</p>
<p>The only studio that didn&rsquo;t get gobbled up by a tech company is Disney, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gone 80% big tech.</p>
<p>And they became a tech company.</p>
<p>And they become a tech company.</p>
<p>They became a tech company.</p>
<p>So their whole business, they&rsquo;re going to catch up to Netflix, and then they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to roll Netflix.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to roll right over Netflix.</p>
<p>The reality is that there is something about big tech that wants to deplatform people.</p>
<p>The legacy analog offline companies were never this moralistic towards their customer</p>
<p>base.</p>
<p>They never deplatformed and banned people the way that these companies are doing.</p>
<p>They limited their moralizations and their high horse to the Oscar Awards and the Emmys.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re correct.</p>
<p>J Cal, J Cal, I&rsquo;m going to do a I&rsquo;m going to do a crazy wine dinner tomorrow night.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about 45 minutes from you.</p>
<p>You should take a car, have them wait, eat dinner, and then drive back.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>I got I&rsquo;m doing I&rsquo;m going to see David, which, you know, for me is a lifelong dream.</p>
<p>Of course you are.</p>
<p>Every time I I&rsquo;m going to go see David because not David Sachs, David, you know, the statue</p>
<p>of David, which to me is like looking in a mirror my whole life.</p>
<p>I looked at that, you know, that body small stubby schlong.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>But why don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>But why don&rsquo;t I have so many hours I&rsquo;m doing in Florence?</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll zip out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll zip out, but I&rsquo;m going to see you next week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 45.</p>
<p>The question is, Friedberg, what are you fucking doing?</p>
<p>Get on a plane and come see your besties.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the only person not in Italy.</p>
<p>You come for three or four days.</p>
<p>I know you got a pregnant wife.</p>
<p>I know you got a lot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re moving all this stuff.</p>
<p>You gave up on San Francisco.</p>
<p>Let me go talk to her.</p>
<p>Just come for three days.</p>
<p>Three days.</p>
<p>Get her some present and maybe get some extra help at the house.</p>
<p>What are all your pilots doing?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all just sitting there in Italy, hanging out.</p>
<p>Mine are literally having the best time, but they&rsquo;re living their best lives right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, we&rsquo;re going to take a tour of Venice.</p>
<p>Do they want to get some hours in?</p>
<p>I mean, no.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll send my plane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s United.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send United for you.</p>
<p>J. Cal, why don&rsquo;t you come visit me tomorrow?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to see a museum.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t want to spend time museum.</p>
<p>Hey, Saks, why am I having a great time with my girls in Florence?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you all next week.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be fine.</p>
<p>J. Cal, I&rsquo;m only going for a day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming to drop.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m my, my mom&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>You know, like I have a lot of people here for two days and hang out for two days with us.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>48 hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>Bring everybody.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>I love you besties.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, congratulations, J. Cal on Rob.</p>
<p>Congratulations on Robin Hood, J. Cal.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m going to say is, is my first fund, my little $11 million fund right now,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ll see what happens a long way to go.</p>
<p>Once again, I&rsquo;ll have a top 5%, 1% fund.</p>
<p>The first fund I did with Sequoia with the scouts was like 150 cash on cash.</p>
<p>Who knows this first fund I did with you guys backing me.</p>
<p>Uh, thank you for supporting me.</p>
<p>That $11 million fund could be 5, 6, 5, 6, 7 X could be, who knows?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Go big boy.</p>
<p>Cash on cash.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a good feeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good feeling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you for the support, David.</p>
<p>You pushed me.</p>
<p>Proud of you, Saxy Poo.</p>
<p>Proud of you.</p>
<p>Nice week for everybody.</p>
<p>Wait, did you have any wins this week?</p>
<p>Aside from spending a lot of money on wine, is there any spectacular news that we need to know?</p>
<p>Well, I think David can confirm, but I think I probably made a billion dollars this week.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Oh, something&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>There must be a SPAC coming.</p>
<p>Brace, brace, IPO.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no SPAC.</p>
<p>No SPACs.</p>
<p>No, oh, oh, something&rsquo;s getting sold.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find out next week.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next week.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Love you, Bastis.</p>
<p>Love you, Italy.</p>
<p>Of course, everybody&rsquo;s favorite.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>The science conductor himself, David Friedman.</p>
<p>All the data, all the science says, go do whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>Go into a nightclub, sweaty, throbbing beef.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Go into a&hellip;</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>But I think understanding what the other counterpoints and counterarguments might be</p>
<p>is critical to get people to actually get to that opinion themselves,</p>
<p>as opposed to just telling them, this is a single point that you should believe.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>So much is all about like the good and the evil, them and us.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t recognize that in moments where there are shared values,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just sitting on both sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Or recognizing that sometimes having different values</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make someone evil.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>And at this point, I&rsquo;m like seven tequila, watermelon tequilas in.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, oh my god, he&rsquo;s got some actual flavor though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the dance floor, you know, jamming out to Coolio.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what&rsquo;s up Coolio?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, god, this is like a dream come true.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like hugging me, his face is right next to my face.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ve had a little bit of tequila.</p>
<p>And I whisper in Coolio&rsquo;s ear, I appreciate you.</p>
<p>I appreciate you.</p>
<p>I appreciate you.</p>
<p>I appreciate you.</p>
<p>I appreciate you.</p>
<p>I try and kind of elevate the conversation a little bit.</p>
<p>And why I care so much about this point.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Of course, everybody&rsquo;s favorite, the queen of quinoa,</p>
<p>the science conductor himself, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>The quality of the show, he calls it the Friedberg Index.</p>
<p>If Friedberg talks a lot, it&rsquo;s a great episode.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>All the data, all the science, just do whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Go into a nightclub.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Sweaty necks and people.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Go into a throbbing rave.</p>
