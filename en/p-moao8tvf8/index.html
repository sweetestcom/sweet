your</p><p>medical</p><p>treatments so just uh take it with a</p><p>grain of salt and</p><p>come to us through social media to ask</p><p>questions and then</p><p>we&rsquo;ll we&rsquo;ll try to answer as many as</p><p>possible</p><p>let&rsquo;s just dive right in and uh get</p><p>right into it steve okay so i definitely</p><p>don&rsquo;t like long introductions so go</p><p>ahead you you start you certainly don&rsquo;t</p><p>well i&rsquo;ll keep mine to a minimum too uh</p><p>so let&rsquo;s go this time to uh social media</p><p>they&rsquo;re oft ignored they think but we&rsquo;re</p><p>not going to</p><p>we&rsquo;re not going to let them prove that</p><p>so susan from youtube i have metastasis</p><p>in the bones breast cancer and was</p><p>recently diagnosed with coronary artery</p><p>disease i&rsquo;m sorry boy the dietary</p><p>requirements for these conditions are</p><p>very different what should i be doing</p><p>well i think that probably the most</p><p>important thing to do is focus on the</p><p>cancer right now there is a recent if</p><p>you take up to a scan of all the videos</p><p>that i&rsquo;ve done on cancer watch the most</p><p>recent ones</p><p>and apply that information there is a</p><p>download</p><p>that i would follow based on some really</p><p>pretty hardcore research on what i would</p><p>do if i had cancer</p><p>we we recently did finish the study</p><p>which a lot of you donated to which i&rsquo;m</p><p>going to we&rsquo;re submitting it to</p><p>a major</p><p>uh oncology publication so i&rsquo;m excited</p><p>to get that published</p><p>the results and you&rsquo;re going to be quite</p><p>happy to see the results um and this is</p><p>like using</p><p>it&rsquo;s not even diet it&rsquo;s alternative</p><p>things to</p><p>alter a certain pathway i&rsquo;m really</p><p>excited about it but go ahead and um</p><p>go to those videos and uh dissect them</p><p>and apply that information</p><p>well that&rsquo;s wonderful and i&rsquo;m going to</p><p>assume that this would also apply to</p><p>marion from youtube 38 have had colon</p><p>surgery followed or cancer followed by</p><p>chemotherapy what vitamin mineral</p><p>analysis do i need which is the best</p><p>serving same videos i guess for her</p><p>yeah yeah you want to do that you know i</p><p>think the thing that&rsquo;s unique about the</p><p>cancer is that um</p><p>the diet that helps prevent it is not</p><p>the diet</p><p>that i would apply if i had it</p><p>so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the mystery that you</p><p>should just</p><p>that will inspire you to go and see what</p><p>what is should the diet be</p><p>um</p><p>but um</p><p>what&rsquo;s fascinating about a cancer cell</p><p>is that it comes from a normal cell</p><p>and uh</p><p>it&rsquo;s damaged to the cell and then it&rsquo;s</p><p>like this</p><p>morphs into this ancient pathway that it</p><p>ferments fuel</p><p>and</p><p>it loses</p><p>its ability to die</p><p>so it kind of lives forever</p><p>so it kind of has all these strategies</p><p>to survive so what you have to do is you</p><p>you have to understand the mechanism</p><p>unfortunately there&rsquo;s so much confusion</p><p>about</p><p>what to do especially when you go down</p><p>the medical route</p><p>because</p><p>the prognosis is not that great uh using</p><p>the typical conventional care</p><p>so anyway um</p><p>that&rsquo;s all i got to say</p><p>all right very good so angela from</p><p>youtube is taking should i mention the</p><p>name brand it&rsquo;s the standard stuff you</p><p>find off the stuff off the shelf at</p><p>walmart multivitamin for women i would</p><p>like to take something with more</p><p>nutrients multivitamins what would you</p><p>recommend for a woman over 55</p><p>get get a real get a real uh food based</p><p>vitamin nutrient and of course i&rsquo;m not</p><p>biased of my own</p><p>um</p><p>i&rsquo;m being sarcastic but um the the kind</p><p>of i think the best multi</p><p>is my keto energy but because it comes</p><p>from i actually show you the food that</p><p>it comes from so there&rsquo;s food that comes</p><p>the problem with using uh food based uh</p><p>vitamins and minerals is that uh</p><p>it&rsquo;s just a bit more expensive because</p><p>it takes a lot of work to</p><p>extract the natural version versus</p><p>synthetic you can make it from</p><p>petrochemicals and unfortunately um</p><p>they don&rsquo;t work the same</p><p>and so</p><p>that&rsquo;s but that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re cheap and</p><p>i mean look at the first ingredients</p><p>usually calcium carbonate that&rsquo;s</p><p>limestone and uh</p><p>i mean it&rsquo;s like eating it&rsquo;s like a rock</p><p>so you&rsquo;re</p><p>it&rsquo;s just really sad that to know that</p><p>99 of all the vitamins out there are</p><p>made synthetically</p><p>and um you think you&rsquo;re getting the real</p><p>thing but they&rsquo;re</p><p>an imitation of the real thing and some</p><p>people say well there&rsquo;s no difference</p><p>really so there&rsquo;s no difference between</p><p>artificial versus natural okay so</p><p>um</p><p>that&rsquo;s just kind of false information so</p><p>get something food based read the</p><p>ingredients and see where it comes from</p><p>um you want the source of it on the</p><p>label</p><p>well it sounds great by the way i&rsquo;m</p><p>going to take you folks behind the</p><p>scenes there&rsquo;s old charlie take you</p><p>behind the scenes uh in a conversation i</p><p>overheard uh dr berg having and that was</p><p>that he was paying over 2 200</p><p>a kilo for something versus you know 10</p><p>dollars for a barrel of it from china do</p><p>you recall what that was something oh</p><p>i&rsquo;m just going to say like um</p><p>like one like vitamin b1 um i i didn&rsquo;t</p><p>want to use the synthetic version so</p><p>um it was like</p><p>well over 20 28 a hundred dollars per</p><p>kilogram</p><p>incredibly expensive just for that</p><p>ingredient alone so um</p><p>um versus the naturals like i mean</p><p>versus the synthetic which is like</p><p>pennies</p><p>so</p><p>i mean like a half a penny per</p><p>per kilogram i mean this is crazily</p><p>cheap so the thing is like um</p><p>um</p><p>you know when you get into vitamins you</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to base everything based on</p><p>costs exclusively you want to look at</p><p>the quality too</p><p>but it does take</p><p>it&rsquo;s more expensive to get the the real</p><p>stuff unfortunately</p><p>well i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m a great</p><p>fan of all those and healthier for it so</p><p>why don&rsquo;t we kick off the first question</p><p>doc i&rsquo;m not sure if you can see it but</p><p>there you go</p><p>all right let me see if i can see it i</p><p>think i can see it all right good so</p><p>what is the best natural remedy for an</p><p>ulcer i&rsquo;m talking about the ulcer either</p><p>for your on your stomach or the small</p><p>intestine</p><p>a peptic or</p><p>a duodenal ulcer</p><p>incredible hang on just a second doc i&rsquo;m</p><p>going to arrange your</p><p>picture in here i&rsquo;m going to bring on</p><p>taylor</p><p>who has been very patient from georgia</p><p>and we were giggling about everything is</p><p>peachtree street down there and uh you</p><p>can&rsquo;t find your way because of it but</p><p>hang on taylor i&rsquo;ve got you all squared</p><p>in the way and welcome to the show with</p><p>your first question in 30 seconds if you</p><p>can go</p><p>all right okay so um usually from what i</p><p>see people who are doing keto and also</p><p>trying to like reverse things like</p><p>insulin resistance typically have issues</p><p>with weight gain and trying to lose</p><p>weight however i&rsquo;m kind of on the other</p><p>end of the spectrum i&rsquo;m thin</p><p>and have a hard time gaining and</p><p>maintaining weight although i used to</p><p>eat all throughout the day constantly</p><p>snacked and i ate really unhealthy um so</p><p>is it is it unusual to see people who</p><p>are thin and have trouble gaining and</p><p>keeping weight on that also have insulin</p><p>resistance and how can this be the case</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s not the highest population but</p><p>i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;ve i kind of fit in that same</p><p>category where you have people that</p><p>you know they base everything on their</p><p>weight like oh i&rsquo;m healthy i&rsquo;m well</p><p>whizzing you could still have very</p><p>easily have health uh insulin resistance</p><p>because and then it affects you</p><p>differently it can affect your blood</p><p>sugar your mood your cognitive function</p><p>it can even create a fatty liver that</p><p>won&rsquo;t even show up in your belly so um</p><p>absolutely um</p><p>in fact you just kind of</p><p>gave me an idea i should probably do a</p><p>video just on that because how many</p><p>people are</p><p>thin and just think well</p><p>you know fat is the</p><p>most obvious thing that is</p><p>like an indication that you&rsquo;re unhealthy</p><p>but um</p><p>yes</p><p>now when you do keto</p><p>the challenge i&rsquo;m thinking you&rsquo;re going</p><p>to run into especially if you&rsquo;re going</p><p>to do intermittent fasting is trying to</p><p>keep the weight down right</p><p>yeah i&rsquo;ve been doing it for the last two</p><p>months and actually somehow i managed to</p><p>get back to my healthy weight and</p><p>maintain it so i don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s</p><p>happening but it&rsquo;s great</p><p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>yeah i think have you felt</p><p>some changes in either like your energy</p><p>or other other things</p><p>yeah my mood has definitely improved the</p><p>one thing that i&rsquo;ve been struggling with</p><p>and i&rsquo;m still trying to kick which in</p><p>hindsight i think is really due to like</p><p>an iodine deficiency because i do have a</p><p>thyroid nodule but other than that i</p><p>still have some brain fog but my mood is</p><p>drastically better anxiety has gone away</p><p>so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s made a huge improvement now</p><p>that i&rsquo;ve restored my gut a little bit</p><p>and added some good things</p><p>wow that&rsquo;s great that&rsquo;s great i think</p><p>you&rsquo;re on the right track</p><p>and</p><p>yeah with the thyroid um</p><p>you know you could have these nodules</p><p>from an estrogen spike so i don&rsquo;t know</p><p>what&rsquo;s going on with your cycles but but</p><p>you&rsquo;re right the iodine uh sea kelp is</p><p>the remedy for that and um</p><p>oh good</p><p>good um that should help you and</p><p>um</p><p>let me think if there&rsquo;s anything else</p><p>um</p><p>yeah i think that that should be good</p><p>and the longer you do this</p><p>you&rsquo;ll start seeing</p><p>all sorts of uh changes for the for the</p><p>better um</p><p>more stable changes and but with insulin</p><p>resistance it sounds like your diet was</p><p>similar to mine it does take</p><p>it does take some months</p><p>and sometimes even years to fully flip</p><p>that thing into a place where it&rsquo;s like</p><p>completely almost gone so yeah yeah and</p><p>i&rsquo;m really happy you mentioned the</p><p>estrogen things i&rsquo;m almost positive i&rsquo;ve</p><p>had estrogen dominance since i had my</p><p>son because i have like the unwanted</p><p>hair and the hormonal acne that just</p><p>won&rsquo;t go away it&rsquo;s been like five years</p><p>so that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m working on too with</p><p>the sea kelp and the iodine so i&rsquo;ve been</p><p>learning a lot from you thank you</p><p>right you&rsquo;re welcome definitely throw um</p><p>maybe also</p><p>throw in a little cruciferous vegetable</p><p>as well um</p><p>now people will say well that&rsquo;s</p><p>estrogenic but like no actually it&rsquo;s um</p><p>it just helps the ratios it helps the</p><p>ratios a good and bad settle it&rsquo;ll put</p><p>you in a better a good place so yeah</p><p>awesome thank you</p><p>you&rsquo;re welcome well that&rsquo;s really great</p><p>thanks taylor and dr berg is very</p><p>interested in what goes on uh not just</p><p>at the time that you undertake some of</p><p>these things but afterwards so</p><p>please do get back with us taylor later</p><p>on and let us know how things are going</p><p>for you an example later i&rsquo;m not going</p><p>to bring you on right now virginia but</p><p>she&rsquo;s been on before and we&rsquo;ve been able</p><p>to kind of track her progress as she</p><p>goes through all these healthy things so</p><p>but in the meantime let me see uh if we</p><p>can</p><p>uh</p><p>give some</p><p>credit to all those that are watching</p><p>from around the world and they&rsquo;re coming</p><p>to us today from uk canada india</p><p>malaysia taiwan south africa zambia</p><p>greece mexico italy france pakistan</p><p>japan norway belgium egypt romania</p><p>cyprus the netherlands australia</p><p>germany algeria hong kong the</p><p>philippines denmark chile ireland the</p><p>czech republic saudi arabia syria iraq</p><p>can you believe this lebanon ghana the</p><p>united arab</p><p>emirates excuse me morocco and all</p><p>across these united states and i don&rsquo;t</p><p>know if sweden was in there but we&rsquo;re</p><p>going to go to victor in a little bit</p><p>too who is calling or coming in from</p><p>stockholm sweden in fact why wait let&rsquo;s</p><p>bring let&rsquo;s bring a victor in right now</p><p>and victor if you don&rsquo;t mute yourself</p><p>we&rsquo;re going to bring you in from across</p><p>the globe and you&rsquo;re on with dr berg</p><p>thank you very much hello dr berg</p><p>hello so</p><p>so i have a specific question and that</p><p>is i want to build muscle and i do the</p><p>intermittent fasting i do 18 to 24 hours</p><p>each day i eat two meals a day</p><p>i eat a lot of eggs and meat</p><p>but the thing is i eat around 100 250</p><p>grams protein</p><p>and 150 to 200 grams of fat</p><p>i would like to increase the amount of</p><p>food that i intake but i&rsquo;m not sure like</p><p>should i increase the protein increase</p><p>the fat</p><p>increase the carbs the carbs are 20 to</p><p>50 grams</p><p>yeah i wouldn&rsquo;t increase the</p><p>carbs</p><p>more than 50 grams i wouldn&rsquo;t</p><p>increase the protein i would increase</p><p>the fat that&rsquo;s the one that</p><p>you can be safe and you can be you could</p><p>turn that into energy especially with</p><p>someone like you that want you want to</p><p>increase your muscle mass because</p><p>you it&rsquo;s first of all it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>it&rsquo;s going to prevent you from losing</p><p>any weight because your body&rsquo;s going to</p><p>be using that as your primary fuel</p><p>source so you&rsquo;re not going to lose any</p><p>more weight and then you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>have to add in</p><p>the right type of exercise</p><p>to really stimulate that muscle out of</p><p>all the variables</p><p>it&rsquo;s the um</p><p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>loading up those muscles that will cause</p><p>the the greatest</p><p>uh growth factor rebound growth factor</p><p>for the uh</p><p>for the muscle tissue so</p><p>that&rsquo;s what i would do but you you won&rsquo;t</p><p>grow more muscles by dumping more and</p><p>more protein um that&rsquo;s not the answer so</p><p>i think you have it you definitely have</p><p>sufficient</p><p>uh quite a bit um i&rsquo;m guessing when you</p><p>say protein too</p><p>you&rsquo;re seeing the quantity of</p><p>the protein source versus the protein in</p><p>the protein source right like</p><p>because that would be a tremendous</p><p>amount of</p><p>actual</p><p>protein</p><p>yeah</p><p>i mean i&rsquo;m very strict with the food i i</p><p>mean i only do the grass-fed organic the</p><p>meat</p><p>uh i do the liver i do the</p><p>i do eggs organics it&rsquo;s just that how</p><p>much fat can i eat i mean if i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m</p><p>starting to come like over 200 closer to</p><p>250 is that okay for the body or will it</p><p>be too much no it&rsquo;s not going to be too</p><p>much because um</p><p>the especially when you&rsquo;re on keto and</p><p>you keep your carbs low you can handle a</p><p>lot of fat it&rsquo;s just ability your</p><p>ability to digest it with with enough</p><p>bile in your gallbladder um</p><p>[Music]</p><p>okay good then that&rsquo;s great and i think</p><p>too that if you were to um</p><p>go by your</p><p>feeling of being satisfied after a meal</p><p>and being able to go from one meal to</p><p>the next without being hungry that&rsquo;s</p><p>like the most important thing versus to</p><p>try to put you into some category of</p><p>this is how many calories that you need</p><p>based on your age and size</p><p>okay</p><p>so if the feeling is that i</p><p>i&rsquo;m still a little bit hungry i should</p><p>add more fat</p><p>yes yes and then</p><p>the other thing too because there&rsquo;s a</p><p>difference between being satisfied and</p><p>being</p><p>full like you might go i&rsquo;m stuffed but i</p><p>still need something</p><p>that&rsquo;s really has to do with more um</p><p>either</p><p>nutrient dense foods which i&rsquo;m guessing</p><p>that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re doing like make sure</p><p>there&rsquo;s more nutrients per calorie</p><p>um health higher quality or it could be</p><p>just the insulin resistance</p><p>issue that takes time</p><p>or it could be a lack of bile sometimes</p><p>i think so because i had like high</p><p>bilirubin levels</p><p>um</p><p>and this is how i started with the</p><p>ketoslash carnivore that i did before</p><p>was that i had some infection or virus</p><p>in the liver so it took like two years</p><p>to become healthy and now when i&rsquo;m</p><p>healthy i&rsquo;ve started training for a</p><p>couple of months and that&rsquo;s why i i saw</p><p>the tip about tatka so i added it to the</p><p>to my i&rsquo;ve done it for like 10 days now</p><p>and i&rsquo;ve</p><p>seen the difference that my skin is not</p><p>as dry as before that&rsquo;s interesting</p><p>and so this is why now like my goal is</p><p>to build muscle i won&rsquo;t grow</p><p>very slow in like all the details where</p><p>can i twist and turn to make another</p><p>better results</p><p>yes yes that&rsquo;s great um</p><p>sufficient protein a lot of exercise and</p><p>then a lot of things to recover make</p><p>sure your sleeping is really good and</p><p>you recover after your workouts and um</p><p>you know get if you it&rsquo;s also about</p><p>finding um the right people to um</p><p>get your information from or coach you</p><p>um there&rsquo;s so many great people out</p><p>there versus there&rsquo;s other people that</p><p>are terri give you terrible advice so</p><p>that&rsquo;s really look for look for someone</p><p>that can give you the right right data</p><p>on that as well but that&rsquo;s what i would</p><p>recommend um i would probably um i</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t go over 50 grams of carbs but i</p><p>would go up to 50 grams of carbs and</p><p>maybe you you add the berries in there</p><p>to get your carbs carbs up a little bit</p><p>higher but um yeah i would hover around</p><p>there yes</p><p>okay perfect thank you very much</p><p>hey you&rsquo;re welcome</p><p>thanks so much victor for joining us</p><p>that was another great call from</p><p>stockholm sweden and uh speaking of</p><p>around the world</p><p>someday steve i&rsquo;m going to go there i</p><p>want to</p><p>go there my</p><p>grandparents are from there i want to</p><p>check it out i will go there one of</p><p>these days good welcome summer time oh</p><p>nice yeah oh yes i heard about that not</p><p>not through the winter</p><p>no that&rsquo;s a little brutal for us okay so</p><p>uh we&rsquo;ve got some answers on the first</p><p>question which asks what is the best</p><p>natural remedy for an ulcer in the</p><p>audience oh my gosh</p><p>it&rsquo;s swept by me give me just a second</p><p>here we go</p><p>60 say some form of chlorophyll 20 say</p><p>zinc 10 say l-carotene did i say that</p><p>right and 10 say lemon juice or apple</p><p>cider vinegar</p><p>okay well here&rsquo;s the thing um</p><p>zinc carnosine will help you but as far</p><p>as</p><p>a i should have said a food because i</p><p>kind of tricked everyone but cabbage</p><p>cabbage cabbage cabbage what what&rsquo;s in</p><p>cabbage cabbage</p><p>has</p><p>a a very unique sulfur base</p><p>compound</p><p>that</p><p>actually kills h pylori</p><p>kills h pylori so it kills off this</p><p>microbe</p><p>that is involved in a large percentage</p><p>of ulcers</p><p>so</p><p>it&rsquo;s fascinating that</p><p>it won&rsquo;t kill the good bacteria but it</p><p>kills this other this pathogenic</p><p>form of h pylori now</p><p>most a lot of people have h pylori but</p><p>it&rsquo;s inactive or it&rsquo;s not pathogenic</p><p>but</p><p>uh there&rsquo;s something that occurs and i</p><p>might be um</p><p>i might have asked this question so i&rsquo;m</p><p>hesitant about telling you too much</p><p>right now but um</p><p>there&rsquo;s something that happens in the</p><p>stomach that allows this microbe to come</p><p>out and cause the ulcer i had</p><p>an ulcer in college so bad</p><p>that i was just downing all the time so</p><p>i have a lot of personal</p><p>experience with that but</p><p>not fun not a good condition</p><p>but cabbage um cabbage juice</p><p>you can juice it you can steam it you&rsquo;re</p><p>still going to retain like 97 of that</p><p>compound</p><p>if you overcook it</p><p>that&rsquo;s not going to work</p><p>and if you ferment it as in sauerkraut</p><p>you can actually still get some great</p><p>benefits it&rsquo;s not quite as potent but</p><p>you get the benefits of all the other</p><p>probiotics</p><p>in sauerkraut so</p><p>um</p><p>you probably wouldn&rsquo;t want to do apple</p><p>cider vinegar because that&rsquo;s going to</p><p>burn you more</p><p>interesting okay how about the second</p><p>question this is an interesting one i</p><p>didn&rsquo;t know it</p><p>you can see it there</p><p>why is farm-raised salmon gray</p><p>and needing the synthetic coloring that</p><p>they use to make it pink</p><p>gross</p><p>okay audience dig into that let&rsquo;s go</p><p>back to youtube donna from youtube her</p><p>husband is in ketosis now and has</p><p>experienced severe calf cramps at night</p><p>uh i think he&rsquo;s drinking too many fluids</p><p>uh he thinks he needs 64 ounces of fluid</p><p>every day plus four cups of coffee is</p><p>this too much what&rsquo;s going on with uh</p><p>with her husband well he needs the</p><p>minerals he needs some minerals i mean</p><p>typically it&rsquo;s going to be a deficiency</p><p>of magnesium it could be a deficiency of</p><p>potassium</p><p>and potentially it could even be a</p><p>problem with calcium it&rsquo;s one of those</p><p>three so um</p><p>that&rsquo;s what he needs to do is to</p><p>increase the electrolytes that&rsquo;s why i</p><p>always say like the electrolytes are key</p><p>when you&rsquo;re doing keto because you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to dump all this extra fluid and</p><p>so i mean it&rsquo;s okay if he has the fluid</p><p>as long as he has the electrolytes</p><p>to because if you dump all this fluid</p><p>you don&rsquo;t replace those um in your</p><p>fasting</p><p>you could be deficient and that can show</p><p>up as a cramp in your calves or even</p><p>like in the middle of night you&rsquo;re</p><p>pointing your toe and as you get this</p><p>cramp that just</p><p>is a killer um</p><p>and then one last thing about that your</p><p>ph if the ph is too alkaline you might</p><p>not be able to absorb these nutrients</p><p>too so that&rsquo;s another root cause so</p><p>apple cider vinegar is a great way to</p><p>increase the absorption of</p><p>the some of these minerals well that&rsquo;s</p><p>interesting and donna i can tell you i</p><p>jog almost every night two and a half</p><p>miles</p><p>and if number one if i don&rsquo;t drink</p><p>enough but if i don&rsquo;t take</p><p>and i&rsquo;m going to plug it here dr berg&rsquo;s</p><p>electrolyte formula my can</p><p>my calves will cramp up to the point</p><p>where i got to stop it gets so painful</p><p>and i just can&rsquo;t keep going on so i will</p><p>say doc</p><p>drown enough i drink enough but uh you</p><p>know making sure that i drink a glass</p><p>full of electrolyte stuff a couple hours</p><p>before i run has kept my my calves from</p><p>cramping so i just for my personal</p><p>experience i&rsquo;m just surprised you even</p><p>need any electrolytes with the amount of</p><p>vegetables that you consume and the</p><p>amount of salad that you consume on a</p><p>daily basis that&rsquo;s right well i make</p><p>sure they put a little bit of lettuce on</p><p>my double cheese uh you know to make</p><p>sure that i&rsquo;m eating right</p><p>those nutritional guidelines okay let&rsquo;s</p><p>see where the heck are we so donna good</p><p>luck with you and your husband tell him</p><p>to put some more minerals in his body</p><p>let&rsquo;s see uh maria from facebook i still</p><p>have a constant sweet taste in my mouth</p><p>despite eating less protein what else</p><p>can i do that&rsquo;s interesting</p><p>it&rsquo;s a chronic what taste a sweet taste</p><p>and she doesn&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s taking</p><p>anything let&rsquo;s see i still have a</p><p>constant sweet taste in my mouth despite</p><p>eating less protein what else can i do</p><p>well maybe cut down some of the sugar</p><p>like donate the carbs are going to</p><p>obviously</p><p>that&rsquo;s what you have to adjust if you</p><p>have a constant sweet taste in your</p><p>mouth i would imagine but you know it&rsquo;s</p><p>really hard to to evaluate that because</p><p>i don&rsquo;t have enough information</p><p>i mean i can&rsquo;t figure this thing out by</p><p>adjusting the protein just that one</p><p>variable i i don&rsquo;t know um a sweet taste</p><p>in your mouth i</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know i</p><p>i don&rsquo;t know what the rest of your diet</p><p>is like yeah but you know the</p><p>the default answer is um</p><p>for of so many symptoms</p><p>if you don&rsquo;t have the basic</p><p>correct eating in it&rsquo;s like these</p><p>all these remedies that i even i</p><p>recommend don&rsquo;t work because they um</p><p>you&rsquo;re going uphill you&rsquo;re going against</p><p>these basic</p><p>deficiencies and basic problems with</p><p>your fuel source that mask other</p><p>symptoms and create other symptoms so</p><p>the key is first getting in your diet</p><p>then try to adjust some of these other</p><p>symptoms because you may not even have</p><p>them after you get your basic eating</p><p>corrected</p><p>all right and over to you yes yeah sure</p><p>uh well some of it stephanie from</p><p>youtube will keto improve borderline</p><p>hypothyroidism</p><p>it can definitely help your your thyroid</p><p>problem because of</p><p>what it does to the endocrine system a</p><p>high carb diet</p><p>increases um</p><p>insulin</p><p>and you get insulin resistance and that</p><p>can affect the thyroid severely not just</p><p>the thyroid the entire endocrine system</p><p>so um like sometimes i&rsquo;ll have people</p><p>say well i can&rsquo;t do ketil because i am a</p><p>diabetic or i have hashimoto&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m like</p><p>no no that&rsquo;s the reason why you want to</p><p>do it and</p><p>also um it&rsquo;s gonna drop inflammation</p><p>so if you have an autoimmune</p><p>disorder especially the thyroid you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna drop inflammation so right there</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna improve the situation so</p><p>you might wanna possibly consider doing</p><p>keto</p><p>maybe</p><p>why not miriam from facebook can soaking</p><p>vegetables overnight get rid of any</p><p>pesticides</p><p>in them perhaps on them</p><p>i think it will help a little tiny bit</p><p>but you need to</p><p>these pesticides you have to usually</p><p>soak them with and</p><p>even apple cider vinegar can help you</p><p>but you want to add something to it i</p><p>have a video on that and i give options</p><p>of how to</p><p>how to remove some of this stuff but um</p><p>just water alone we&rsquo;ll do</p><p>maybe</p><p>five percent elimination but there&rsquo;s</p><p>just you know</p><p>the</p><p>these chemicals are are fat soluble and</p><p>this is why when you get a chemical wash</p><p>um</p><p>it usually can actually it&rsquo;s a salt it&rsquo;s</p><p>a natural solvent that helps pull out</p><p>some of these fat soluble chemicals that</p><p>get attached to the outside of the</p><p>vegetable</p><p>so um</p><p>find something like that</p><p>all right the audience is on it uh quiz</p><p>question number two asks why is</p><p>farm-raised salmon gray and needing</p><p>synthetic coloring</p><p>and 55</p><p>say a lack of exercise which causes an</p><p>increase in myoglobin that&rsquo;s interesting</p><p>30 say lack of natural nutrition like</p><p>krill and 15 say</p><p>lack of quality foods smart audience i</p><p>think that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s uh amazing research</p><p>yeah yeah exactly um um here&rsquo;s what</p><p>happens so the the salmon and trout uh</p><p>well mainly salmon eat krill and shrimp</p><p>and um</p><p>and then those krill and shrimp have</p><p>microalgae they&rsquo;ll eat that and</p><p>and that has the pigment so these</p><p>pigments are created from the algae</p><p>and this pigment gets transferred</p><p>um but of course guess what uh the farm</p><p>raised salmony they don&rsquo;t eat the krill</p><p>they eat um</p><p>soy corn</p><p>uh animal</p><p>products a lot a lot of other issues so</p><p>they don&rsquo;t have the natural</p><p>pigment source so</p><p>they have to pay</p><p>so if the the companies that make the</p><p>farm fish have farm raised fish have to</p><p>pay to color it using a certain pigment</p><p>that&rsquo;s made from petroleum chemicals and</p><p>synthetic</p><p>derivatives and unfortunately um</p><p>it&rsquo;s like i mean it&rsquo;s expensive too it&rsquo;s</p><p>like 20</p><p>of the</p><p>fish&rsquo;s diet is um the expense comes from</p><p>the the coloring agent which is is not</p><p>the same as a natural</p><p>thing so um there&rsquo;s a lot of issues with</p><p>that and it&rsquo;s a synthetic version um</p><p>the safety studies</p><p>are sparse</p><p>and um</p><p>but it looks good</p><p>so as long as it looks good right</p><p>because if they didn&rsquo;t put it in there</p><p>it would be literally it would be pale</p><p>gray</p><p>so um</p><p>honestly i don&rsquo;t um i would want to see</p><p>the sta safety studies over a long</p><p>period of time before i would want to</p><p>put those in my body and you may say</p><p>well</p><p>it&rsquo;s just coloring it&rsquo;s not a big deal</p><p>right well um it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p><p>yes it&rsquo;s a synthetic antioxidant well</p><p>so is synthetic beta-carotene and some</p><p>of these other antioxidants</p><p>that they found to cause cancer</p><p>in certain studies but it took like 10</p><p>20 years to get it off the market so</p><p>it&rsquo;s just one of those things where</p><p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no safety studies</p><p>there&rsquo;s nothing on humans and so we&rsquo;re</p><p>just gambling trying it out and</p><p>hopefully it</p><p>you know it works out but yeah this goes</p><p>to for the the coloring and egg yolks</p><p>commercial eggs</p><p>and even chicken meat so when you buy</p><p>chicken they have to put different</p><p>pigments in there to make it look like a</p><p>a fresh chicken or it&rsquo;s going to be very</p><p>pale gray</p><p>so</p><p>unfortunately</p><p>um this is what we were</p><p>you know these are options</p><p>so we have to spend a little bit more to</p><p>get something that&rsquo;s</p><p>without some of these petrochemicals</p><p>wow well for the lay people uh out here</p><p>shopping</p><p>how do you know it says you know the</p><p>chicken gets to leap around outside</p><p>or you know whatever you know i mean or</p><p>the salmon how do you know if it&rsquo;s</p><p>really</p><p>uh natural if they say so is it or how</p><p>do you sort through all that</p><p>well you could definitely go by price</p><p>because it&rsquo;s going to be a lot more</p><p>expensive but if you can go to a</p><p>farmer&rsquo;s market and you talk to the</p><p>farmer</p><p>i mean</p><p>and and or go to the grocery store and</p><p>see if you could find like i mean at the</p><p>very minimum organic chicken</p><p>because free range just means it&rsquo;s out</p><p>of the cage you know might might have a</p><p>hole in the barn where they can go out</p><p>occasionally but</p><p>i think the wave of the future</p><p>is going to be for more transparency of</p><p>where i would love to see the animals</p><p>where they&rsquo;re raised before i buy them</p><p>and i think that buying animals from a</p><p>farmer even though it&rsquo;s expensive would</p><p>be a really good investment if you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing fasting you&rsquo;re saving money you&rsquo;re</p><p>not eating as frequently so</p><p>and support the farmer and um</p><p>i think</p><p>it&rsquo;s it takes</p><p>more work but when you go to the store</p><p>steve and you buy a chicken for</p><p>four or five dollars think about</p><p>how could they afford to sell it for</p><p>four to five dollars to raise that whole</p><p>chicken</p><p>and even break even i mean it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s expensive to feed these chickens</p><p>good food and let them</p><p>roam around i have 16 chickens and</p><p>we buy organic feed of course they eat</p><p>bugs</p><p>and i&rsquo;m doing all sorts of experiments</p><p>with um</p><p>fermenting the grains and checking the</p><p>yolks so i have everything lined up and</p><p>i&rsquo;m going to share that with everyone in</p><p>a new channel</p><p>very soon so i&rsquo;m excited about that but</p><p>i had to find the devices to be able to</p><p>measure</p><p>the carotenoids the retinol the vitamin</p><p>e and the egg yolk and then do</p><p>comparisons</p><p>um</p><p>so got some real interesting data coming</p><p>coming down the pike steve boy that is</p><p>fascinating he&rsquo;s dr burger&rsquo;s quick</p><p>quick becoming the uh the consummate</p><p>farmer let&rsquo;s get back to questions dr</p><p>berg if you can see this here&rsquo;s the next</p><p>one</p><p>all right so</p><p>what&rsquo;s in kefir that can help you sleep</p><p>better</p><p>all right ladies and gentlemen climb on</p><p>that</p><p>and let&rsquo;s go back to our green room and</p><p>let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;re going to go to debbie</p><p>who is in colorado springs</p><p>is it warming up out there debbie</p><p>uh yesterday it was 80 and today it&rsquo;s</p><p>snowing okay so</p><p>that&rsquo;s colorado</p><p>wow well debbie if you would uh knock</p><p>out your question as close to 30 seconds</p><p>as you can and you&rsquo;re on with dr burke</p><p>well do hi dr berg i&rsquo;m so happy to be</p><p>here you&rsquo;ve been highly influential in</p><p>my journey so far</p><p>so my question i was diagnosed recently</p><p>with type 2 diabetes</p><p>and i have been on keto</p><p>for four years the last two years</p><p>intermittent fasting as well</p><p>and</p><p>i suspect because i feel great and i</p><p>have i wasn&rsquo;t on keto to lose weight and</p><p>i&rsquo;m at a healthy weight i just um</p><p>did it for all the health benefits and</p><p>have never felt better in many many ways</p><p>so</p><p>i suspect perhaps maybe i&rsquo;m experiencing</p><p>physiological insulin resistance i&rsquo;m not</p><p>sure</p><p>i am considering maybe going on a higher</p><p>carb diet to retrain my body and my</p><p>cells to process glucose again</p><p>my fear is my glucose numbers are so</p><p>high</p><p>that doing that might put me in a</p><p>dangerous situation and i&rsquo;m sort of at a</p><p>crossroads of what my next step should</p><p>be</p><p>so um i think i missed something that</p><p>you said but so so you were diabetic you</p><p>got on keto no no i i got on keto four</p><p>years ago i was healthy i just wanted to</p><p>be healthier oh and i&rsquo;ve been on keto</p><p>for four years and i got diagnosed with</p><p>diabetes um a couple months ago</p><p>interesting so so i have a question</p><p>can you just give me a rundown on what</p><p>you would eat in a given day on average</p><p>sure so i have a bulletproof coffee in</p><p>the morning with grass-fed butter and</p><p>mct oil</p><p>i</p><p>fast for about 15 hours so at around</p><p>noon other than that coffee</p><p>so fat fast and then around noon i will</p><p>typically have</p><p>eggs and avocado</p><p>and sprouts some type of keto</p><p>lunch</p><p>um and then since i&rsquo;ve started fasting i</p><p>will have more healthy carbs maybe in</p><p>the afternoon and for dinner you know i</p><p>would be having sweet potatoes and</p><p>you know mostly vegetables we</p><p>meet three times a week or so um</p><p>but but i will say when i started</p><p>intermittent fasting i started eating</p><p>more healthy carbs and more fruit than i</p><p>did when i was</p><p>strict strict keto for the first two</p><p>years</p><p>i got it and um did you get this um</p><p>diagnosed through an a1c test</p><p>insulin and what was your a1c so my a1c</p><p>was 7.2</p><p>my</p><p>i asked for a homo ir test based on your</p><p>recommendation on my second i had blood</p><p>done blood work done twice in the four</p><p>month period so the second time around</p><p>they did my homo ir and that was 1.4</p><p>and my insulin is 3.7</p><p>okay yeah but my glucose shoots up you</p><p>know when i eat let&rsquo;s say i&rsquo;ll eat a</p><p>sweet potato</p><p>an hour and a half later my glucose</p><p>level will be close to 400. so it&rsquo;s</p><p>getting very high</p><p>but if i&rsquo;m strict keto</p><p>i can keep it under 200 but it&rsquo;s still</p><p>not in a healthy place</p><p>are you going through stress</p><p>no</p><p>okay good</p><p>good</p><p>um</p><p>well</p><p>i think um</p><p>the fact that your blood sugar is high</p><p>you you must</p><p>you must start to um</p><p>just get rid of</p><p>get rid of the starches because the</p><p>starches are i mean that&rsquo;s just like</p><p>that&rsquo;s just adding more sugar to the</p><p>yeah the problem there&rsquo;s um there&rsquo;s even</p><p>some</p><p>great um home tests that you can get now</p><p>even an a1c at home test</p><p>but</p><p>i mean you you&rsquo;re really left with the</p><p>decision of lowering your carbs and</p><p>going back to the strict version and the</p><p>healthy version and maybe some</p><p>additional things too</p><p>that involve</p><p>um maybe not diet but um you know</p><p>exercise and then also nutrients like</p><p>um</p><p>berberine and uh cinnamon i don&rsquo;t know</p><p>if you do those but there&rsquo;s uh</p><p>yeah okay</p><p>and the other thing too to help insulin</p><p>resistance</p><p>and to help help the situation is to</p><p>work on the microbiome because</p><p>those will</p><p>those will start generating um</p><p>small chain fatty acids like butyrate</p><p>and things that will help your blood</p><p>sugars greatly</p><p>um</p><p>so i think it&rsquo;s going to be one of those</p><p>um</p><p>experiments to be able to monitor</p><p>yourself your blood sugars and see what</p><p>is doing it</p><p>but um you you we need to put you in the</p><p>right direction here because um</p><p>wow that&rsquo;s really that&rsquo;s going up even</p><p>when you&rsquo;re strict your blood sugars are</p><p>still 200 that tells me that um</p><p>that your liver must be also producing</p><p>the sugar so it&rsquo;s crazy it&rsquo;s creating a</p><p>gluconeogenesis is turning other things</p><p>from the sugar so um</p><p>maybe the the next</p><p>next thing you need to do is focus more</p><p>on the liver with milk thistle and</p><p>and things to support your liver liver</p><p>health start really working with that</p><p>and um</p><p>take it to the next level and then just</p><p>give it a little bit more time be</p><p>patient because</p><p>eventually that</p><p>they call it the don dawn phenomena or</p><p>the</p><p>production of that sugar will go down if</p><p>you just stay really consistent</p><p>and i&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not having the</p><p>stress because the stress could also do</p><p>that medication can do it</p><p>but um but i would still add a really</p><p>good probiotic and start working on the</p><p>gut and then support your liver and then</p><p>just give it more time</p><p>super helpful thank you so i&rsquo;m assuming</p><p>trying to</p><p>you know i&rsquo;ve the research i&rsquo;ve done</p><p>people try to</p><p>have higher carbs for three or five days</p><p>to kind of retrain their body to accept</p><p>that glucose again is that probably not</p><p>a good idea for me based on that now</p><p>it&rsquo;s that that&rsquo;s um i just found</p><p>personally it&rsquo;s false information it&rsquo;s</p><p>bad advice because</p><p>okay</p><p>resetting it&rsquo;s kind of like</p><p>resetting your insulin receptors with</p><p>carbs</p><p>well all you&rsquo;re going to do is you&rsquo;re</p><p>just putting gasoline on the fire</p><p>exactly</p><p>it&rsquo;s just</p><p>it&rsquo;s like turning up the heat to fix the</p><p>air conditioner it just doesn&rsquo;t work so</p><p>yeah whoever told you that i would i</p><p>would really evaluate</p><p>that information because it&rsquo;s just not</p><p>and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s why people say they um</p><p>they have like the carb day to reset and</p><p>they</p><p>like it&rsquo;s just going to make things</p><p>worse</p><p>great okay make sense thank you so much</p><p>you&rsquo;re welcome oh</p><p>sure</p><p>thanks debbie we definitely want to hear</p><p>back from you as you you know continue</p><p>this discipline and love to hear that</p><p>your blood sugars are down</p><p>and steve i just want to bring something</p><p>up that actually makes uh uh that she</p><p>just</p><p>gave me a another uh thought on that con</p><p>that uh what&rsquo;s happening</p><p>is that um there&rsquo;s a lot of information</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of products out there that</p><p>are being recently promoted as being</p><p>keto friendly and and so i&rsquo;m starting up</p><p>a dr berg approved kind of a list and</p><p>it&rsquo;s going to be on my website it&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m</p><p>actively working on that because</p><p>if i went on</p><p>amazon and i started searching out these</p><p>products reading the ingredients and i&rsquo;m</p><p>like in a state of shock of how many</p><p>things are keto friendly and they&rsquo;re</p><p>really not so i will be covering that</p><p>because these hidden</p><p>the hidden the amount of hidden</p><p>maltodextrin</p><p>in these desserts and bars and</p><p>keto snacks are just off the charts got</p><p>maltodextrin you got synthetic fibers</p><p>which act like</p><p>uh carbohydrates but they&rsquo;re in the</p><p>family that don&rsquo;t contribute to</p><p>carbohydrates so</p><p>that is another another thing that i</p><p>will be talking a lot more about because</p><p>i mean just like debbie i mean she&rsquo;s</p><p>trying to trying to do it and make it</p><p>work out and if it doesn&rsquo;t work she</p><p>she might go on to the next thing that</p><p>try something else when in fact</p><p>if we just make sure we&rsquo;re doing the</p><p>right thing it might end up working</p><p>probably is going to work for her so</p><p>yeah that was a good good question</p><p>well i&rsquo;m scared to look at that list i&rsquo;m</p><p>afraid that the mcrib is not going to</p><p>make the cut so i&rsquo;m just going to remain</p><p>in ignorance so that i can carry on with</p><p>my great healthy uh routine okay so the</p><p>last question was</p><p>what what&rsquo;s in kefir that can help you</p><p>sleep better i&rsquo;m interested in that one</p><p>and the audience 70 say tryptophan</p><p>20 say some form of probiotics and 10</p><p>say vitamin d</p><p>well what&rsquo;s interesting about kefir</p><p>that is um</p><p>it is different than yogurt because it&rsquo;s</p><p>a combination of friendly bacteria and</p><p>friendly yeast</p><p>um</p><p>these microorganisms make b1</p><p>they make lactic</p><p>acid</p><p>and they have lactobacillus microbes</p><p>that actually help lower cortisol which</p><p>is going to help you sleep they also</p><p>produce</p><p>l-tryptophan which is a precursor to</p><p>serotonin which is a precursor to</p><p>melatonin</p><p>and these microbes make serotonin</p><p>directly as well as melatonin so there&rsquo;s</p><p>a lot of reasons why</p><p>kefir is good to take right before you</p><p>go to bed if you have a sleeping problem</p><p>but of course if you&rsquo;re fasting</p><p>you know take it right at the meal at</p><p>your last meal but um</p><p>a little bit of kefir and you can make</p><p>it yourself i&rsquo;m going to do a video on</p><p>a great source inexpensive way to make</p><p>yourself i mean just taking either</p><p>milk which by the way if you if you&rsquo;re</p><p>lactose intolerant</p><p>it&rsquo;ll be a lot better if you do the</p><p>kefir than yogurt and just take either</p><p>goat&rsquo;s milk or cow&rsquo;s milk high quality</p><p>put these little</p><p>little crystals in there</p><p>keep it out of the fridge for 24 hours</p><p>and you have kefir and you can take</p><p>those crystals back out</p><p>and start another batch</p><p>so</p><p>it&rsquo;s a really great way to um</p><p>you know get enhance your sleep and</p><p>so you might want to try it anything to</p><p>improve sleep it might be a good thing</p><p>so um maybe you eat late and this will</p><p>work briefly great because you have a</p><p>late dinner and then you have your kefir</p><p>and then you go right to bed</p><p>so something to try steve</p><p>absolutely on my list viviness from</p><p>facebook and by the way you know there&rsquo;s</p><p>so many people coming on to this routine</p><p>we forget that they don&rsquo;t know</p><p>everything and she wants to know please</p><p>explain what ketones are and what is</p><p>ketosis for those just joining the</p><p>ketones are a a compound that is a</p><p>byproduct</p><p>of uh when you burn fat</p><p>and so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a fuel source that</p><p>your body um runs on that&rsquo;s actually way</p><p>way way better than the typical glucose</p><p>and the way that you generate these</p><p>ketones is you reduce your carbohydrates</p><p>down to below 50 grams but</p><p>but keep it under like 30 grams and then</p><p>you&rsquo;ll start making ketones and what&rsquo;s</p><p>interesting about this whole thing is</p><p>like</p><p>this is our bodies were developed to run</p><p>on ketones it&rsquo;s really a natural thing</p><p>but because of the introduction of so</p><p>many carbohydrates to our diet</p><p>we have switched away from ketosis</p><p>burning ketones to running on glucose</p><p>so</p><p>based on a lot of other reasons health</p><p>reasons um you want to try the ketogenic</p><p>diet and you&rsquo;ll see why it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p><p>way better diet to do than any other</p><p>diet out there because it runs your body</p><p>and what&rsquo;s</p><p>natural to um run on which is the stored</p><p>energy of fat so we have a lot more fat</p><p>than we do stored sugar</p><p>so you can avoid a lot of diseases by</p><p>doing the ketogenic diet</p><p>very good dr berg next question</p><p>okay</p><p>what is the best remedy for restless leg</p><p>syndrome</p><p>climb on that audience let&rsquo;s go back to</p><p>youtube</p><p>uh</p><p>animal i think is the name is there a</p><p>relationship between eating breakfast</p><p>and having anxiety attacks</p><p>well uh my first book i recommended</p><p>eating breakfast i don&rsquo;t recommend</p><p>anymore um especially if you&rsquo;re not</p><p>hungry i think that&rsquo;s probably the most</p><p>important thing to do to improve your</p><p>health is don&rsquo;t eat at breakfast and in</p><p>that way you can fast longer and it can</p><p>improve your mood</p><p>doing</p><p>every time you eat you stimulate insulin</p><p>every time you eat carbs you increase</p><p>insulin and the spike of insulin will</p><p>put you more into a sympathetic</p><p>dominance mode where you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re more</p><p>in the flight or fight mode which is</p><p>anxiety</p><p>so um when you go low carb you reduce</p><p>this</p><p>this</p><p>adrenaline cortisol stress response</p><p>so i would skip the breakfast</p><p>and it&rsquo;s false information that it&rsquo;s the</p><p>most important meal of the day it&rsquo;s not</p><p>it&rsquo;s not a good thing to do</p><p>yet i promoted it for years until i</p><p>found out that was bad advice</p><p>well</p><p>live and learn</p><p>and uh</p><p>yeah exactly steve and let me tell you</p><p>who else has learned and that is for</p><p>jenny who has been on with us several</p><p>times and she&rsquo;s going to</p><p>continue to demonstrate the 30-second</p><p>question virginia you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd</p><p>hello dr berg i&rsquo;m adrenal type i&rsquo;m 70</p><p>years old and i&rsquo;ve been doing your</p><p>program 11 months</p><p>i&rsquo;ve lowered my a1c to 5.8 still needs</p><p>to be lowered i have serious ir</p><p>but recently the cholesterol the h</p><p>ratio to the hdl was like 6.3 so it&rsquo;s</p><p>like the um collectors 364. that kind of</p><p>made me a little bit concerned and i&rsquo;m</p><p>dealing with sister cell</p><p>prolapse</p><p>so i wanted to do a prolonged</p><p>uh fast</p><p>so i started saturday was the last day</p><p>that i had my meal</p><p>i by wednesday i could see something</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t right with me i was irritated i</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t feeling well i was feeling very</p><p>tired um</p><p>no energy i didn&rsquo;t have any bowel</p><p>movements um</p><p>for two days and this was i started you</p><p>know sunday was my first day and then by</p><p>wednesday i said to my husband by</p><p>evening time i ought to eat something</p><p>because i don&rsquo;t feel right what did i do</p><p>wrong</p><p>did you take enough sea salt potassium</p><p>b vitamins</p><p>i did the b complex i did my</p><p>electrolytes two of them</p><p>and i did salt on one of them</p><p>and i took a cup two in the morning and</p><p>two in the evening</p><p>okay so a couple things that could have</p><p>done that um</p><p>you</p><p>you may need and it sounds like you do</p><p>support</p><p>from the microbiome your your friendly</p><p>bacteria i think that could be what&rsquo;s</p><p>missing</p><p>as well as</p><p>some bile salts because the bile salts</p><p>will</p><p>really put your cholesterol into a great</p><p>ratio especially if you&rsquo;re doing keto</p><p>and eating more fats</p><p>um</p><p>the the purified bile salts you know the</p><p>gallbladder formula</p><p>take that an empty stomach</p><p>and what</p><p>what you have to realize too is your own</p><p>microbes make</p><p>secondary bile and so without the bile</p><p>then what happens is there&rsquo;s nothing to</p><p>break down the cholesterol</p><p>so that&rsquo;s one thing that</p><p>crossed my mind and then the other thing</p><p>too is like um</p><p>bile helps you absorb um</p><p>vitamin d</p><p>and um</p><p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a lot of fat soluble</p><p>vitamins that are related to mood</p><p>especially vitamin d</p><p>those are all fat soluble so i&rsquo;m</p><p>thinking you&rsquo;re probably not absorbing</p><p>those or you&rsquo;re missing some nutrients</p><p>because you&rsquo;re supposed to feel good</p><p>when you&rsquo;re doing fasting so there&rsquo;s</p><p>obviously something missing so um</p><p>i would go after the big clue is your</p><p>cholesterol</p><p>so um i would kind of work on the</p><p>microbes</p><p>and the bile</p><p>and try it again but don&rsquo;t go as long</p><p>and just see how how you feel and just</p><p>increase the sea salts a little bit more</p><p>and that definitely will make you feel</p><p>weak</p><p>and funky and not good if you&rsquo;re not</p><p>having enough sea salt</p><p>and then one last thing</p><p>hopefully your b vitamins are from a</p><p>natural source they&rsquo;re not a synthetic</p><p>source because that could be another</p><p>factor</p><p>yeah i take your keto energy that has uh</p><p>and then dr mercola&rsquo;s uh</p><p>b complex and also benefit me that you</p><p>had suggested and i recently just saw</p><p>that you have a b vitamin one b1 how</p><p>different is that from the benefitamine</p><p>of b1 how different</p><p>the benfotamine believe it or not it&rsquo;s a</p><p>synthetic but i have not found any side</p><p>effects from that synthetic</p><p>it&rsquo;s a fat soluble b1</p><p>uh the one i have is a water soluble b1</p><p>a completely natural source very very</p><p>high quality</p><p>the benfotamine works</p><p>really good if there&rsquo;s any type of</p><p>brain or nerve issues</p><p>the water soluble works</p><p>for everything else</p><p>so so they&rsquo;re a little bit different um</p><p>but i wanted to have a b1 um because</p><p>it&rsquo;s so hard to find a natural b1</p><p>especially for</p><p>anxiety and</p><p>nervous tension and mood issues and that</p><p>happened with the white finger syndrome</p><p>the b1 could it could help um</p><p>circulation um</p><p>possibly</p><p>yeah</p><p>thank you you&rsquo;re welcome all right so</p><p>great to have you back for jenny and uh</p><p>keep up the great trials there and we&rsquo;d</p><p>love to hear back from you again as you</p><p>conquer the challenges of uh fasting</p><p>that long my hat

cindy</p><p>from bloomington indiana cindy uh</p><p>you&rsquo;re on the air with dr berger hope</p><p>hello this is cindy and can you hear me</p><p>let&rsquo;s see i can</p><p>but um</p><p>dr berg and you know people in the</p><p>audience hear them that&rsquo;s sort of</p><p>interesting well i tell you what uh</p><p>cindy go ahead with your question for me</p><p>and i will uh tell dr berg what it is</p><p>okay that sounds great thank you so much</p><p>i&rsquo;ve learned so much from you over the</p><p>last 18 months i&rsquo;ve been doing keto and</p><p>intermittent fasting</p><p>i&rsquo;m 58 years old and i just had a full</p><p>checkup and</p><p>my cholesterol is high it has been high</p><p>for the last 10 years</p><p>this time it was 382</p><p>and i&rsquo;m sure my doctor is coming unglued</p><p>about that and my ldl was also high</p><p>again it&rsquo;s 232</p><p>my tsh3</p><p>is high but everything else was normal</p><p>when i ask for</p><p>small dense ldl or fractionation or an</p><p>mr lipid profile to try to understand</p><p>those uh particle sizes that you&rsquo;ve</p><p>talked about in your videos</p><p>all of the medical professionals that</p><p>i&rsquo;ve seen over the last couple of years</p><p>look at me with this blank foggy stare</p><p>and i&rsquo;m just wondering</p><p>how</p><p>can i get these this this testing done</p><p>when and i&rsquo;m in a huge medical group</p><p>here in this college town and nobody</p><p>knows what i am talking about thank you</p><p>so much</p><p>yeah i think um and i could hear</p><p>everything you said i think and i ran</p><p>into i run into this often so there are</p><p>some great</p><p>uh keto friendly cardiologists that will</p><p>be very happy to consult you remotely</p><p>and</p><p>help you get the right testing</p><p>and</p><p>if you just if you start doing searches</p><p>on</p><p>on youtube to find you know keto</p><p>cardiologists i know there&rsquo;s</p><p>i i know i could think of 10 off the top</p><p>of my hand</p><p>so you could um</p><p>look at their websites find out which</p><p>one to work with and they can help you</p><p>maybe find someone locally or</p><p>or they can do it themselves and help</p><p>help you evaluate this but yeah it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s really sad to</p><p>uh to know that there some of these docs</p><p>do not understand the difference between</p><p>these particle sizes and they&rsquo;re not up</p><p>on this data</p><p>there&rsquo;s an advanced lipid profile that</p><p>you must do to really see what&rsquo;s really</p><p>going on because</p><p>they&rsquo;re just working off the outdated</p><p>old information that&rsquo;s been pushed</p><p>around for years and they haven&rsquo;t been</p><p>updated yet on the new information um</p><p>so</p><p>in the meantime</p><p>um the fact that your cholesterol and</p><p>your ldl is high if you&rsquo;re concerned</p><p>i think that the motto of today&rsquo;s</p><p>chat would be bile salts</p><p>take</p><p>gallbladder formula or bile salts to</p><p>help mobilize this cholesterol</p><p>and help it be removed a little bit</p><p>faster because as you start keto</p><p>the fat cell</p><p>you&rsquo;re running off of your fat from your</p><p>fat cell well guess what part of that</p><p>fat cell is cholesterol and that has to</p><p>come out so you&rsquo;re probably dumping a</p><p>lot of cholesterol</p><p>out of that</p><p>fat cell</p><p>which is a normal thing</p><p>and the key is</p><p>the size</p><p>the size of it if your carbs are low</p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to have the small dense</p><p>ones that can get lodged</p><p>into the inside of the artery you&rsquo;ll</p><p>have the large buoyant ones that</p><p>float through the body so</p><p>the key is keeping that carb low not</p><p>cheating and then adding</p><p>the purify bowel salts to help the liver</p><p>and give it more time</p><p>i do have your</p><p>many of your supplements as well as the</p><p>gallbladder formula and i did take some</p><p>notes on what you were saying and</p><p>um i did have a small success in that i</p><p>asked for a cac scan and they knew what</p><p>i was talking about so that will be</p><p>coming up down the road and i know from</p><p>your previous videos that i probably</p><p>should be increasing my uh hit workouts</p><p>and get more aerobic to lower those</p><p>numbers as well so that&rsquo;s kind of my</p><p>takeaway from what you&rsquo;re saying if i&rsquo;m</p><p>correct</p><p>yeah you&rsquo;re right you&rsquo;re right so that&rsquo;s</p><p>going to greatly help you</p><p>and this the</p><p>the um the coronary artery calcium scan</p><p>is</p><p>the</p><p>best</p><p>indicator for</p><p>mortality from all causes it&rsquo;s going to</p><p>tell you what&rsquo;s going on with the inside</p><p>of the arteries if there&rsquo;s calcium and</p><p>hopefully it&rsquo;ll be zero and you&rsquo;re going</p><p>to be good to go and even if it is</p><p>high</p><p>there&rsquo;s things that you can do to kind</p><p>of bring it down but</p><p>yeah exercise to sleep</p><p>uh reduce the stress all these things</p><p>are are going to help you so the goal is</p><p>just to</p><p>keep</p><p>keep doing things to</p><p>improve it until it&rsquo;s back to normal the</p><p>heart the hard part about this whole</p><p>topic is to</p><p>like we&rsquo;re operating off of um</p><p>omitted information like we don&rsquo;t have</p><p>all these tests to know the particle</p><p>size well we can go by this we can go by</p><p>that so</p><p>we&rsquo;re just going to use the</p><p>best advice based on what what data we</p><p>have until we get you into a good range</p><p>so um</p><p>it&rsquo;s a little bit of</p><p>coping with the situation right now</p><p>until you can get those tests done well</p><p>i thank you so much i&rsquo;ve learned so many</p><p>important things from you and 75 percent</p><p>of our household is converted to</p><p>intermittent fasting and keto and we do</p><p>thank you for everything</p><p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>great good job thank you thank you so</p><p>much like everyone we&rsquo;d love to hear</p><p>back from you we haven&rsquo;t forgotten dave</p><p>let&rsquo;s try it again dave</p><p>try to see if we can have dr berg hear</p><p>you go ahead</p><p>dave are you still with us</p><p>well i&rsquo;m not going to he might be off</p><p>getting a cup of joe in the meantime</p><p>let&rsquo;s go back to uh what will be our</p><p>final question answer today and that</p><p>asks what&rsquo;s the best remedy for restless</p><p>leg syndrome boy am i glad i don&rsquo;t have</p><p>that uh 70 of respondents say magnesium</p><p>20 say various forms of vitamin b1 10</p><p>say potassium or himalayan salts who&rsquo;s</p><p>right</p><p>steve i had this for just years i mean i</p><p>get up at literally in the middle of the</p><p>night two o&rsquo;clock and i&rsquo;m pounding my</p><p>legs because they will not chill out i</p><p>had to go for a run in the middle of the</p><p>night around the neighborhood so um</p><p>little did i know it says a simple</p><p>simple remedy of course</p><p>um it&rsquo;s b1 vitamin b1</p><p>what it does is it just removes all that</p><p>lactic acid that builds up</p><p>from the high carb diet now if i would</p><p>if i wasn&rsquo;t consuming ben and jerry&rsquo;s</p><p>ice cream before bed every night and</p><p>massive pasta i probably wouldn&rsquo;t have</p><p>that problem so the higher the refined</p><p>carbohydrate sugar diet the more b1 that</p><p>you need or</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to generate way too much</p><p>lactic acid in the in the tissues which</p><p>is not a good thing</p><p>so um</p><p>simple remedy</p><p>to a major problem</p><p>and i just want to tell everyone stay</p><p>tuned for some really interesting videos</p><p>coming up that i&rsquo;m working on and i</p><p>appreciate all your wonderful comments</p><p>and your attention</p><p>sticking around this long</p><p>and have a great weekend</p><p>we&rsquo;ll see you next week</p><p>[Music]</p><p>foreign</p></section><footer
