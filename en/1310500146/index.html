    <p>The following is a conversation with John Clark.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a friend, a Brazilian jiu jitsu black belt,</p>
<p>former MMA fighter, and at least in my opinion,</p>
<p>one of the great UFC corner man coaches to listen to.</p>
<p>And also, he&rsquo;s my current jiu jitsu coach</p>
<p>at Broadway Jiu Jitsu in South Boston.</p>
<p>He was once, for a time, a philosophy major in college,</p>
<p>and is now, I would say, a kind of practicing philosopher,</p>
<p>opinionated, brilliant,</p>
<p>and someone I always enjoy talking to even when,</p>
<p>especially when, we disagree, which we do often.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s definitely someone I can see talking to</p>
<p>many times on this podcast.</p>
<p>In fact, he hosts a new podcast of his own</p>
<p>called Please Allow Me.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor,</p>
<p>followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>
<p>Thank you to Theragun,</p>
<p>the device I use for post workout muscle recovery,</p>
<p>Magic Spoon, low carb keto friendly cereal</p>
<p>that I think is delicious,</p>
<p>Eight Sleep, a mattress that cools itself</p>
<p>and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep,</p>
<p>and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that martial arts,</p>
<p>especially jiu jitsu and judo,</p>
<p>have been a big part of my growth as a human being.</p>
<p>So I think I will talk to a few martial artists</p>
<p>on occasion on this podcast.</p>
<p>I hope that is of interest to you.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t talk to people who are simply great fighters</p>
<p>or great athletes, but people who have a philosophy</p>
<p>that I find to be interesting and worth exploring,</p>
<p>even if I disagree with parts or most of it.</p>
<p>I like alternating between historians</p>
<p>and computer scientists, fighters and biologists,</p>
<p>and between totally different worldviews and personalities,</p>
<p>like Elon Musk and Michael Malice.</p>
<p>This world, to me, is fascinating</p>
<p>because of the diversity of weirdness</p>
<p>that is human civilization.</p>
<p>I love the weird and the brilliant,</p>
<p>and hope you join me on the journey of exploring both.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like an episode, skip it.</p>
<p>For an OCD person like myself,</p>
<p>sometimes not listening to a podcast episode</p>
<p>is an act of courage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not finishing a book even though you&rsquo;re 80% done.</p>
<p>Try it sometimes.</p>
<p>Listen to ones you like, and don&rsquo;t listen</p>
<p>to the ones you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I know, it&rsquo;s profound advice.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with John Clark.</p>
<p>You ready for this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been ready for this my whole life.</p>
<p>All right, I was thinking of doing a Kerouac style road trip</p>
<p>across the United States,</p>
<p>after this whole COVID thing lifts.</p>
<p>You ever take a trip like that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a handful of long distance driving trips</p>
<p>up and down the East Coast, but also from the West Coast</p>
<p>back to the East Coast, and then returning to California.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve definitely done my fair share</p>
<p>of driving in this country.</p>
<p>Do you have the longing for the great American road trip?</p>
<p>I think there are so many things</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to see in the world</p>
<p>that I now, at this point in my life, realize</p>
<p>there are tons of things that I need to see here</p>
<p>in this country, and a road trip could potentially</p>
<p>be the best way to see them.</p>
<p>I think to do it effectively, you need an amount of time</p>
<p>where you can be as leisurely as possible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no deadline, and there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta make it from Chicago to St. Louis by sundown</p>
<p>to get to this place at this time.</p>
<p>I think you really need to be able to take your time</p>
<p>and kind of let the road take you where you need to go.</p>
<p>It feels like you need a mission though, ultimately.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason you need to be in San Francisco.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the Kerouac thing.</p>
<p>You have to meet somebody somewhere kind of loosely</p>
<p>in a few weeks, and then it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>as you struggle on towards that mission,</p>
<p>you meet weird characters that get in your way,</p>
<p>but ultimately sort of create an experience.</p>
<p>I think having a loose deadline is good,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a beginning and an end point,</p>
<p>and what I mean is I don&rsquo;t wanna have to be,</p>
<p>all right, we&rsquo;re leaving, say, Boston on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to New York by Monday morning,</p>
<p>and then from New York, we&rsquo;re gonna go to Philly,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve gotta be in Philly at four.</p>
<p>A vague beginning and end is fine,</p>
<p>but I think having very strict guidelines in between</p>
<p>will rob you of certain experiences along the way.</p>
<p>If you have a timeframe to get from Philly to Indianapolis</p>
<p>and some awesome shit starts to happen in Philly,</p>
<p>do you really wanna have to cut it short</p>
<p>because you gotta be in Indianapolis by sunup?</p>
<p>Why do you have to be anywhere by any time</p>
<p>for any reason, really?</p>
<p>Plans change.</p>
<p>Plans change all the time, exactly,</p>
<p>but if we&rsquo;re talking about having a mission</p>
<p>or the type of road trip,</p>
<p>I just think it would be best to have it</p>
<p>as loose and flexible as possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You gotta make hard deadlines and then break them.</p>
<p>Totally change the plans.</p>
<p>Disappoint people, break promises.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way of life.</p>
<p>Somebody&rsquo;s waiting for you in St. Louis,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden, you fell in love</p>
<p>with a biker in New York.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re up to.</p>
<p>I can appreciate that, but on a trip like that,</p>
<p>I feel like a trip with deadlines</p>
<p>is for a different point in your life,</p>
<p>and at this point in my life,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any of the deadlines</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not about meeting someone</p>
<p>and disappointing them in St. Louis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about me not disappointing myself.</p>
<p>You wanna have enough time in what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>to make sure that you get the full breadth</p>
<p>of every experience that you encounter.</p>
<p>How would you fully experience a place?</p>
<p>How would you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve actually fully experienced Boston.</p>
<p>If you were showing up to a city for a week</p>
<p>on this road trip, what would you do?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna answer that in two parts.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I had an opportunity to move out of Boston,</p>
<p>and the thing that kept me here, no question about it,</p>
<p>was the fact that I felt like I had a contract</p>
<p>with my students, and I did not.</p>
<p>I felt like a great many of them took a leap of faith</p>
<p>by joining my gym and asking me to teach them what I know,</p>
<p>and when I had an opportunity to leave Boston,</p>
<p>I thought of those people,</p>
<p>and I thought, I wanna fulfill my obligation to them.</p>
<p>So because I made a decision to stay here,</p>
<p>I then that summer made a decision</p>
<p>to endear myself to the city of Boston,</p>
<p>and I tried to find lots and lots</p>
<p>of different things to do.</p>
<p>I can tell you that the coolest thing</p>
<p>that I found to do in this city is the MFA,</p>
<p>where they have on Friday nights,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have different exhibits and stuff,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll have little beer carts and food tents,</p>
<p>and you can go do a painting class off on the side.</p>
<p>Very cool night of things to do.</p>
<p>But in general, whenever I&rsquo;m in a new city,</p>
<p>I try not to pay attention to Google,</p>
<p>and I try not to do anything that I find on a travel site.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is to walk out of your hotel</p>
<p>or wherever it is you&rsquo;re staying</p>
<p>and find the most normal looking bar,</p>
<p>have a drink, and talk to a bartender.</p>
<p>So the people, the people.</p>
<p>The people, and then you can experience that town</p>
<p>the way that they experience it.</p>
<p>Even in a city where there are tons of tourist attractions,</p>
<p>locals probably visit the same tourist attractions</p>
<p>when they have visitors come from out of town,</p>
<p>you wanna see how they view those places</p>
<p>and how they visit them.</p>
<p>And you wanna go to eat where they&rsquo;re going to eat.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re gonna, for the most part,</p>
<p>the North End is not a place where I would take someone</p>
<p>and say, hey, this is Boston&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the pinnacle of Boston dining,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very touristy.</p>
<p>There are a handful of really good restaurants there,</p>
<p>but I wanna know where the,</p>
<p>I wanna go to Bogie&rsquo;s Place.</p>
<p>I wanna know the down low spots where.</p>
<p>The hell&rsquo;s Bogie&rsquo;s Place?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little steakhouse in the back of J.M. Curly&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a shitty bar?</p>
<p>J.M. Curly&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just a bar with like bar food.</p>
<p>But I think that like.</p>
<p>In South Boston?</p>
<p>It is in Boston, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not South Boston?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s in, it&rsquo;s in the downtown area.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know what the neighborhoods</p>
<p>are called here, honestly,</p>
<p>because they have an area called Downtown Boston,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t even know what the hell that means.</p>
<p>And they used to have the Financial District.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s Southie?</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;ve heard about the Southie.</p>
<p>Southie is South Boston.</p>
<p>But is there a difference between South Boston and Southie?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>No, but like, you know, the mythical Southie.</p>
<p>I think the mythical Southie</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s long gone now.</p>
<p>And the term now actually is Sobo.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changed, what, who took over what?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, you know, the good will hunting personality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Southie, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Strong accent, those bad ass dudes.</p>
<p>I came here right at the end of like,</p>
<p>what was South Boston.</p>
<p>So when I got, and my gym is in South Boston,</p>
<p>the neighborhood was just starting to change.</p>
<p>So I think,</p>
<p>as gentrification happened</p>
<p>and they started building more luxury condominiums,</p>
<p>they were buying all these old businesses out,</p>
<p>all the mom and pop businesses.</p>
<p>And I think that kind of changed</p>
<p>the makeup of the community.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t only because there was an influx</p>
<p>of new young people with disposable income,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s an exodus of the older people</p>
<p>who kind of grew up and raised their families there</p>
<p>because they were being offered</p>
<p>humongous sums of money for their homes</p>
<p>that they had bought like in the late 70s and early 80s</p>
<p>so that they could develop those areas.</p>
<p>So you have a combination of the influx of new people</p>
<p>and the exodus of the old,</p>
<p>and now you just got this totally new neighborhood</p>
<p>in its place.</p>
<p>What do you love about Boston?</p>
<p>Is there a love still for Boston?</p>
<p>You certainly have the love of the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gone as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, I don&rsquo;t wanna pinpoint pin this on Boston</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s happening in all great cities.</p>
<p>As these areas become gentrified,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is the personality</p>
<p>and the character of the neighborhood</p>
<p>is just being run out.</p>
<p>And I have nothing against people coming in</p>
<p>and making money and things like that.</p>
<p>But when you do it at the expense of the culture,</p>
<p>the character and the personality of the neighborhood,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re kind of standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>These are the people that came here</p>
<p>and built these areas up.</p>
<p>It happens here in Boston,</p>
<p>it happens in all over New York,</p>
<p>happens on the West Coast.</p>
<p>So what I love about Boston is not nearly as romantic</p>
<p>as what it might&rsquo;ve been 15 years ago</p>
<p>and what I used to love about New York.</p>
<p>What I love about Boston is that it&rsquo;s walkable.</p>
<p>The food scene is on the rise here.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;re hard pressed to find the charm</p>
<p>that people think of when they think of old Boston</p>
<p>and old New England city.</p>
<p>So yeah, I see it differently.</p>
<p>People sometimes criticize like MIT</p>
<p>like for the thing that it is now.</p>
<p>But I think it is always like that.</p>
<p>I tend to prefer to carry the flame of the greatness,</p>
<p>the greatest moments of its history</p>
<p>and like sort of enjoy the echoes of that</p>
<p>in the halls of MIT.</p>
<p>In the same way in Boston, you think about the history</p>
<p>and that history lives on in the few individuals.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t just look around what Boston is now</p>
<p>and be like, what has Boston become?</p>
<p>I think it was always carried by a minority of individuals.</p>
<p>I think we kind of look back in history</p>
<p>and think like times were greater</p>
<p>in a certain kind of dimension back then.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because we remember,</p>
<p>this is a ridiculous non data driven assertion of mine,</p>
<p>is to remember just the brightest stars of that history.</p>
<p>And so we romanticize it.</p>
<p>But I think if you look around now,</p>
<p>those special people are still living in Boston</p>
<p>for which Boston will be remembered as a great city</p>
<p>in like 50 years.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re probably right, but isn&rsquo;t there some sort</p>
<p>of theory about the point that there&rsquo;s like a certain age</p>
<p>in your life where things resonate differently to you?</p>
<p>Like, I think they&rsquo;ve done studies</p>
<p>where most people stop searching for new music</p>
<p>after age 19.</p>
<p>Most dads you see like wearing super old clothes,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the style of the time period</p>
<p>of the last great part of their life.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s an evolution in people</p>
<p>and it could also be the memories of where they live.</p>
<p>And when I was 17, of course my neighborhood</p>
<p>was the best then because I was having the most fun.</p>
<p>And we always kind of look at things through that tint,</p>
<p>I think, and you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong</p>
<p>with the way cities are evolving now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not, I prefer the time of like a mom and pop store,</p>
<p>not a fabricated like gastropub that could just be like</p>
<p>on a four lane super highway</p>
<p>on your way out of Epcot Center.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually owned by like some conglomerate.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s still the special places.</p>
<p>Like I, this takes us back to the road trip</p>
<p>is maybe I tend to romanticize the experiences</p>
<p>of like the diners in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>What would you say makes for like,</p>
<p>it feels like life is made up of these experiences</p>
<p>that maybe on paper seem mundane,</p>
<p>but are actually somehow give you a chance</p>
<p>to pause and reflect on life</p>
<p>with like a certain kind of people,</p>
<p>whether like really close friends or complete strangers,</p>
<p>maybe alcohol is involved in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>It seems like a road trip facilitates that</p>
<p>if you allow it to.</p>
<p>Like what do you think makes for those kinds of experience?</p>
<p>Have you had any?</p>
<p>I think in the context of a road trip,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like hyper localization.</p>
<p>And I think it is those experiences along the way</p>
<p>with people and the people that you&rsquo;re with</p>
<p>will color the experiences differently</p>
<p>depending on the person.</p>
<p>The road trip you took was with somebody else or alone?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve driven up and down the East Coast several times.</p>
<p>When I drove from LA to New York,</p>
<p>my friend was on the run from the cops.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we were trying to get out of.</p>
<p>Traffic tickets?</p>
<p>Yeah, traffic tickets.</p>
<p>Yeah, allegedly.</p>
<p>We were trying to get out of LA</p>
<p>because he was going to have to go away for a little while.</p>
<p>So we drove from LA and we just,</p>
<p>we were young kids, we had no idea what we were doing,</p>
<p>and we drove East.</p>
<p>And then we had an unbelievable trip,</p>
<p>mostly because we didn&rsquo;t really have a destination,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t really have a timeframe, thank goodness,</p>
<p>because he got arrested again in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>So we got kind of stuck there.</p>
<p>And then we drove back to LA</p>
<p>when he got out in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>But all the stops along the way</p>
<p>were kind of like weird things,</p>
<p>like you have no money, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re finding that like a little diamond</p>
<p>in the rough place to eat,</p>
<p>the diner you talk about, like that place.</p>
<p>I once was in, where was I?</p>
<p>I think I was in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>And the guy that I was with, he said,</p>
<p>I know this quaint little spot around the corner.</p>
<p>And I was young, I was like 25.</p>
<p>And I thought the coolest thing in the world would be</p>
<p>to be such a citizen of the world</p>
<p>that you know these quaint little spots around the corner</p>
<p>in like all these great cities.</p>
<p>Like I know where to get this great chicken sandwich</p>
<p>in Argentina.</p>
<p>I know where to get this great meal in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>I know where to get this super local egg in another country.</p>
<p>And I just thought that that was really cool,</p>
<p>the ability to do that anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Did you get closer with that guy through the trip?</p>
<p>I found that like, so I took a trip across the United States</p>
<p>with a guy friend of mine.</p>
<p>We had different goals.</p>
<p>I was searching for meaning in life</p>
<p>and he was searching for,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the politically correct way of phrasing it,</p>
<p>but just basically trying to sleep</p>
<p>with every kind of woman that this world has to offer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between those two things?</p>
<p>Well, I guess he was searching</p>
<p>for the different kinds of meanings.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I still think that you can&rsquo;t find meaning</p>
<p>between a woman&rsquo;s legs, I suppose.</p>
<p>Have you tried all of them?</p>
<p>But there was a tension there.</p>
<p>We grew closer with those experiences,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve gotten in fights.</p>
<p>There was a lot of like literal almost fights</p>
<p>and then we were close and there was like silences,</p>
<p>but then we were like brothers</p>
<p>and this whole weird journey of friendship that we went on.</p>
<p>I think anytime you spend that much time</p>
<p>in like a small space with another person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have the different parts</p>
<p>of the relationship will manifest themselves.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have the periods of closeness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have the periods of vulnerability</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like maybe you&rsquo;re driving through Denver</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s three in the morning</p>
<p>and you talk about something</p>
<p>you might not have otherwise talked about.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have the periods</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t wanna see that motherfucker ever again.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t, and depending could be because of anything.</p>
<p>But the guy that I drove twice with,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still in contact, we&rsquo;re still buddies.</p>
<p>We have very different goals also,</p>
<p>but at that point in our lives,</p>
<p>we never even contemplated the meaning of life.</p>
<p>We were about probably more to the point</p>
<p>of the friend that you drove with.</p>
<p>We were more about racking up experiences,</p>
<p>whatever they were.</p>
<p>I wanna be able to retell this.</p>
<p>Stories.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanna be able to retell this</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gotta sound cool.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t wanna retell a story about,</p>
<p>yeah and then we drove through Alabama</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve got a lovely library</p>
<p>and I checked out this book</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not interested in retelling that.</p>
<p>Do you remember any, this is a kid&rsquo;s show,</p>
<p>do you remember any stories that the kids would enjoy</p>
<p>from those times that were profound in some kind of way?</p>
<p>There were some impactful moments</p>
<p>on the beginning of our road trip where we had no money</p>
<p>and as a couple of kids who knew nothing,</p>
<p>we literally had to, we stopped in Vegas</p>
<p>and we went to Circus Circus.</p>
<p>At the time they had $3 blackjack</p>
<p>and we had like 12 bucks</p>
<p>and my buddy was a kind of a degenerate gambler</p>
<p>so he knew what was up.</p>
<p>I was just like kind of stuffing chips in my pockets,</p>
<p>making sure we could pay for the gas.</p>
<p>And just being at a point which is like a starting line</p>
<p>and like we drove from LA to Vegas,</p>
<p>which is only about four hours</p>
<p>and being at the starting line and realizing like,</p>
<p>we may not even like get off the starting line here.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t, what are we doing?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be two guys stuck in Vegas.</p>
<p>We have no money.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t go West because you&rsquo;re gonna get pinched.</p>
<p>We have no money to go East.</p>
<p>What the hell are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Are we gonna wind up in Vegas?</p>
<p>So, you know, that was kind of a profound thing</p>
<p>where you just, it&rsquo;s a turning,</p>
<p>it potentially could have been a turning point in our lives</p>
<p>had we not made enough money to continue going East.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beautiful thing about road trips</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re broke is like,</p>
<p>in retrospect, everything turned out fine,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re facing the complete darkness,</p>
<p>the uncertainty of the possibilities laid before you.</p>
<p>And like, I don&rsquo;t know if you were confident at that time,</p>
<p>but like, I was really full of self doubt.</p>
<p>Like just, all I could see is all the trajectories</p>
<p>where you just screw up your life.</p>
<p>Like, what am I doing with my life?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a failure, like all these dreams I&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never realized I&rsquo;m a complete piece of shit.</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I had no concept of consequence.</p>
<p>I probably had toxoplasmosis.</p>
<p>I had literally no concept of consequence.</p>
<p>Immediate gratification was all I cared about.</p>
<p>Oh, so existentialist.</p>
<p>Yeah, it did not even enter my mind in my like early 20s</p>
<p>that anything that I was doing at that point</p>
<p>could reverberate for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I think part of me didn&rsquo;t even think I&rsquo;d make it this far.</p>
<p>And so I was not interested in like the long play.</p>
<p>I remember thinking like,</p>
<p>why should I be acting now in a way</p>
<p>that might impact a point in my life I never reach?</p>
<p>And yet now you are a man who searches for meaning in life,</p>
<p>at least I would say to put another way,</p>
<p>you think deeply about this world</p>
<p>and in a philosophical context</p>
<p>while also appreciating the violence</p>
<p>of hurting other friends of yours, right?</p>
<p>On a regular basis.</p>
<p>So why do you think, I mean,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a broader question there,</p>
<p>but it calls a personal question.</p>
<p>It seems that people who fight for prolonged periods of time,</p>
<p>like Jiu Jitsu people and mixed martial arts people,</p>
<p>even military folks become over time philosophers.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Is that, is there a parallel between fighting and violence</p>
<p>and the philosophical depth with which you now have arrived</p>
<p>from the starting point of being the full existentialist</p>
<p>of like just living in the moment</p>
<p>to like being introspective human now?</p>
<p>I would say to that being a soldier</p>
<p>or a warrior hundreds of years ago</p>
<p>is probably what started the marriage</p>
<p>between martial arts and philosophy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re constantly under someone else&rsquo;s charge</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re told to go out and walk in a line</p>
<p>and overtake some Germanic tribe somewhere</p>
<p>and that happens all the time, your job is being a soldier.</p>
<p>On any given day, you might not come home.</p>
<p>So I think that you have to start your day</p>
<p>by thinking deeply about how you&rsquo;ve lived to that point</p>
<p>and the people that are living in and around you</p>
<p>and how you&rsquo;ve treated them.</p>
<p>And I think that probably is what started the marriage</p>
<p>of being kind of like a philosophical martial artist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to really like on a daily basis,</p>
<p>take stock of what&rsquo;s going on around you and inside you</p>
<p>because we all suffer with this kind of idea.</p>
<p>If today&rsquo;s my last day, did I do it right?</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really do it so much nowadays</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re so comfortable,</p>
<p>but if we were being marched out to war every day,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d see people live a little bit differently.</p>
<p>And you treat the people around you</p>
<p>a little bit differently.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s echoes of that</p>
<p>in just even the sport of like grappling and Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re facing your own mortality?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really think of it that way, but.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think that a lot of people</p>
<p>that train in a martial art in contemporary society,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider them all martial artists.</p>
<p>I think just because you train in martial art</p>
<p>does not mean you&rsquo;re a martial artist.</p>
<p>There are so many people that use martial arts</p>
<p>as a form of exercise and like this little piece</p>
<p>of self concept.</p>
<p>They use martial arts as a tagline in their Instagram bio.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really a form of exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something they do, it&rsquo;s not something they are.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a big difference there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff mixed up in there</p>
<p>because the Instagram thing is something you do for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also, it could be something you are for display</p>
<p>versus who you are in the private moments</p>
<p>of searching and thinking and struggling</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Instagram is a surface layer</p>
<p>that much of modern society operates in,</p>
<p>which is really problematic because there&rsquo;s that gap</p>
<p>between the person you show to the world</p>
<p>and the person you are in private life.</p>
<p>And if you make majority of your project</p>
<p>of the human project of your sort of few years</p>
<p>on this earth, the optimization</p>
<p>of the public Instagram profile,</p>
<p>then you never develop this private person.</p>
<p>But it does seem that if you do jiu jitsu long enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult not to fall into like,</p>
<p>this has become a personal journey,</p>
<p>an intellectual journey.</p>
<p>Because like, if you get your ass kicked thousands of times,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain point to where that,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s like a defense mechanism,</p>
<p>but that turns into some kind</p>
<p>of deeply profound introspective experience</p>
<p>versus like exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not yoga.</p>
<p>Yeah, so let me go back first</p>
<p>and address the Instagram point,</p>
<p>which I think there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>between people whose Instagram is intrinsically tied</p>
<p>to their profession and they have</p>
<p>to put a specific profile out there.</p>
<p>And I think in general,</p>
<p>people who truthfully their business is tied</p>
<p>to their Instagram profile, I wanna exclude them.</p>
<p>I think that most people,</p>
<p>Instagram is how they want to be seen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not always congruent with who you are,</p>
<p>but I think there is a level of dishonesty there.</p>
<p>Like this is how I want people to see me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put all this stuff in my Instagram bio,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really not me.</p>
<p>And when you do that,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little disingenuous and you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;re never really gonna marry</p>
<p>those two things together and it gets tough.</p>
<p>Let me, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>let me push back on something.</p>
<p>This is a good time to address the many flaws</p>
<p>of the great and powerful John Clark.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go there.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You strive so hard for excellence in your life</p>
<p>and for extreme competence that you are visibly</p>
<p>and physically off put by people</p>
<p>who have not achieved competence.</p>
<p>Do you think we should be nicer to the people who are,</p>
<p>like you mentioned, a person who first picks up an art,</p>
<p>picks up, becomes vegan, starts doing CrossFit,</p>
<p>start doing Jiu Jitsu for the first time</p>
<p>and create that as their,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re struggling through this like, who am I?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really overly proud and it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p>And you and your wise chair have seen many battles.</p>
<p>Yeah, that you see the ridiculousness of that.</p>
<p>I tend to, I&rsquo;m learning to give those folks,</p>
<p>not to mock them and to sort of give them a chance</p>
<p>to do their ridiculousness because I think I was that too.</p>
<p>Let me first clarify.</p>
<p>I wanna be clear about what you mean</p>
<p>when you say a level of competence.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve never won a world championship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never, you know, there are plenty of things in my life</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve not achieved what most people would consider</p>
<p>to be the penultimate level of success.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s accomplishments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accomplishments, it&rsquo;s ribbons, it&rsquo;s things like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that those things don&rsquo;t mean anything to me.</p>
<p>And the fact that I haven&rsquo;t in some arenas</p>
<p>is something that I wanna change,</p>
<p>which is, we can talk about that in a second.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>between the very eager noob of whatever it is they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>who does the thing so that they can signal</p>
<p>they do the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a person I have less respect for.</p>
<p>So we know each other primarily through jujitsu.</p>
<p>Look at a jujitsu tournament.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this idea that people espouse online.</p>
<p>I respect anyone with the guts to get on the mat</p>
<p>and put it on the line and sign up for a tournament.</p>
<p>That is the biggest load of shit I have ever heard.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Do you know how easy it is for you</p>
<p>to put your name on something</p>
<p>and pay the registration fee and walk in there?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the hard part.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the easiest part.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you lose your first match,</p>
<p>but I respect the person who signs up for the tournament,</p>
<p>registers for the tournament, goes on a diet,</p>
<p>loses weight the right way, trains their ass off,</p>
<p>and does the things properly and then goes on the mat.</p>
<p>The person who simply signs their name</p>
<p>on the registration form and jumps on the mat,</p>
<p>if they haven&rsquo;t done these other things,</p>
<p>they actually have nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Because what they&rsquo;ve done is they&rsquo;ve stepped onto the mat,</p>
<p>in the ring, in the cage with a bucket full of excuses.</p>
<p>Sure you signed up, but you&rsquo;re not really vulnerable</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t run, you didn&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t do all the things you&rsquo;re supposed to do.</p>
<p>The person who eliminates every possible excuse</p>
<p>and then steps on the mat</p>
<p>and gets their ass kicked in the first round,</p>
<p>I have so much more respect for that person</p>
<p>than the person who does nothing</p>
<p>and maybe on natural ability wins a couple of matches</p>
<p>and then writes on Facebook</p>
<p>on how I lost to the eventual champion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s worth zero, that&rsquo;s worth zero.</p>
<p>And in that process, what did you learn about yourself?</p>
<p>You learned about yourself</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve got a natural level of aptitude</p>
<p>for whatever this activity is that you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t actually learn how to maximize it</p>
<p>through training and through dedication</p>
<p>and through all these other things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an incredibly interested, novice musician.</p>
<p>I like to play bass, but I don&rsquo;t put that on anything.</p>
<p>And I stink at it.</p>
<p>I would really love to be sick at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently not, but I&rsquo;m not running around,</p>
<p>talking about entering, any of those other things.</p>
<p>I do it, it&rsquo;s for myself</p>
<p>and I wanna reach a level of competence in that.</p>
<p>So the person that you have respect for</p>
<p>is a person who takes it fully seriously,</p>
<p>takes the effort fully seriously.</p>
<p>So for bass, that would be that you agree with yourself</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to perform live</p>
<p>and just in your own private moments, your private thoughts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to give yourself an excuse out,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m just gonna have fun.</p>
<p>This is a nice experience.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to think I&rsquo;m going to try</p>
<p>to be the best possible bass player</p>
<p>given everything that&rsquo;s going on in my life,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to do my, like actually,</p>
<p>and put it all on the line.</p>
<p>And if I fail, that&rsquo;s not because I didn&rsquo;t try,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a failure.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then sit in that sick feeling of like, I&rsquo;m a failure.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that an important thing to know?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s like the best thing it could be,</p>
<p>but sometimes it&rsquo;s fun to lose yourself</p>
<p>in the bragging, in the lesser ways of life.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m careful not to,</p>
<p>because too many people in my life,</p>
<p>when I brought them with like a little candle</p>
<p>of a fire of a dream, they would just go like,</p>
<p>they would just blow that fire out,</p>
<p>that they would dismiss me.</p>
<p>Cause they see like, I would say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said a lot of ridiculous stuff,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always dreamed about like putting,</p>
<p>I always dreamed of having this world full of robots.</p>
<p>And every time I would bring these ideas up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be shut down by the different people,</p>
<p>by my parents, by, then you need to first get an education.</p>
<p>You need to succeed in these dimensions.</p>
<p>In order to do all these things,</p>
<p>you have to get good grades.</p>
<p>You have to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s all this stuff that it&rsquo;s indirect</p>
<p>or direct ways of blowing out that little ridiculous dream</p>
<p>that you present.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I remember sort of bringing up,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, things like becoming a state champion</p>
<p>in wrestling, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird dance because of course the coaches will tell,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll kind of dismiss that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, okay.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it feels like in those early days,</p>
<p>you have to preserve that little fire.</p>
<p>Johnny Ive, I don&rsquo;t know if you know who that is,</p>
<p>is a designer at Apple.</p>
<p>He was a chief designer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s behind most of the iPhone, all that stuff.</p>
<p>And he always talked about that he wouldn&rsquo;t bring his ideas</p>
<p>to Steve Jobs until they were matured</p>
<p>because he would always shit on them.</p>
<p>He wanted them to as little babies live for a little bit</p>
<p>before they get completely shut down.</p>
<p>And I always think about that when I see a beginner</p>
<p>sort of bragging on Instagram, you have to be careful.</p>
<p>Let them play with that little dream.</p>
<p>Are you playing with a little dream that you&rsquo;re nurturing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to take that little flame</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to create a roaring blaze with it?</p>
<p>Or are you playing with the idea of it</p>
<p>and behind that there&rsquo;s no substance?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know the difference.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I struggle with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it necessarily is.</p>
<p>Certainly you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And when I say Instagram,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna impugn a bunch of strangers,</p>
<p>but I have a gym with a lot of members.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that the number of years</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the gym,</p>
<p>when someone comes to me and says, this is my goal,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tell them yes or no in general, but I know.</p>
<p>I can tell by the way they say it to me,</p>
<p>I can thin slice it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the look on people&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>And when people start to say they wanna do X, Y, and Z,</p>
<p>I know right off the bat,</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s either gonna put an effort in</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not going to put an effort in.</p>
<p>So to me, it&rsquo;s about the effort behind that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re busting your ass and you&rsquo;re a new at something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re brand new, but you&rsquo;re working really hard</p>
<p>and you have a series of like moderate successes in that,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the guy I wanna champion</p>
<p>because that persistence and that grit over time,</p>
<p>those successes will no longer be moderate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be huge.</p>
<p>But the person who&rsquo;s having moderate success</p>
<p>by doing nothing, chances are they&rsquo;ll never learn</p>
<p>to put that work in and the successes will never grow.</p>
<p>You have an admiration for Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>I love him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna let that sit for a brief moment.</p>
<p>So why?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a combination of factors.</p>
<p>One is like the timeliness of his career</p>
<p>and like the age I was when he like came to prominence,</p>
<p>the raw, brutal violence</p>
<p>and the raw, brutal honesty when he speaks.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easy for people to hear him or see his life</p>
<p>and cast him aside as some simianesque,</p>
<p>like just cretin scourge on society.</p>
<p>But when you hear him speak,</p>
<p>like this is not a guy who&rsquo;s unintelligent.</p>
<p>This is a guy who knows himself better</p>
<p>than probably most of us know ourselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disarming and that&rsquo;s a humongous part</p>
<p>of my admiration for him.</p>
<p>Who is Mike Tyson?</p>
<p>Because it feels like there&rsquo;s similarities</p>
<p>between him and you.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s a violent person in there,</p>
<p>but also a really kind person.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all like living together in a little house.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re the same.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thoughtful person,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a scary, violent person.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like having a picnic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re having a picnic.</p>
<p>I think there are dialectical tensions in everyone,</p>
<p>these like opposing forces</p>
<p>that are constantly pulling at you</p>
<p>and at different points in your life,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s sliding scale.</p>
<p>And I think that certainly when I was a younger person,</p>
<p>that there was a lot more manifestation of the violence</p>
<p>and a lot less of the kindness.</p>
<p>People who were not as close to me</p>
<p>probably saw more of the violent side</p>
<p>and only the very close people to me saw like</p>
<p>what would pass for the kind side.</p>
<p>And now that&rsquo;s sliding in the other direction.</p>
<p>And I worry actually sometimes that</p>
<p>there could be a situation where I need</p>
<p>that old version of me</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s getting further and further away</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t call him up if I need him.</p>
<p>And that concerns me to a certain degree.</p>
<p>The sad aging warrior seeing his greater self fade away.</p>
<p>But you still compete.</p>
<p>Does that person return?</p>
<p>It seems like for Mike Tyson,</p>
<p>that person returned at the prospect of competition.</p>
<p>It returns, but I&rsquo;ve learned better</p>
<p>how to manifest it in competition</p>
<p>in terms of like the effects</p>
<p>that that type of emotion has on you physically</p>
<p>in the middle of a competition.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve better learned how to utilize that energy.</p>
<p>But I think another side effect of this</p>
<p>is like having a gym where you&rsquo;re a bigger guy</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the head instructor,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be as mean and violent as you once were</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re also not trying to run a business.</p>
<p>And you spend so many years trying not to be mean</p>
<p>and to soften your technique a little bit</p>
<p>that that all of a sudden just becomes who you are.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t necessarily like that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been trying to reclaim that a little bit</p>
<p>on the mat, but I think in competition,</p>
<p>there has to be an athlete really wants to score the points.</p>
<p>A fighter really wants to incapacitate you</p>
<p>and put you in a position where they can</p>
<p>do their own bidding.</p>
<p>And the result in a jujitsu match</p>
<p>might just still be two points,</p>
<p>but the motivations are very, very different.</p>
<p>What do you make of Tyson on Joe Rogan</p>
<p>saying that he was aroused by violence?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s insane?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s deeply honest for him?</p>
<p>And do you think that rings true for many of us,</p>
<p>others who practices in different degrees?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for a lot of people.</p>
<p>And I think that it was a brutally honest statement by him.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s something that even if a lot of people</p>
<p>feel it, they&rsquo;re not that comfortable</p>
<p>admitting it or saying it.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s great joy</p>
<p>in landing a flush right hand on someone&rsquo;s jaw</p>
<p>and then watching them crumble.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even feel it.</p>
<p>You ever played baseball as a kid?</p>
<p>You can hit a base hit off the end of the bat</p>
<p>and it will sting your hands</p>
<p>because of the way that you hit it.</p>
<p>You can hit a home run and you won&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>It just feels so good in your hands.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think, one of the joys of physical contact.</p>
<p>When you do it the right way,</p>
<p>and that goes for all physical contact.</p>
<p>When you do it the right way,</p>
<p>the physical pleasure you can derive from it</p>
<p>and the mental pleasure, it&rsquo;s unparalleled.</p>
<p>See, but that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Let me draw a distinction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the fortune of being a wrestler.</p>
<p>And I would draw a distinction</p>
<p>between a very well executed in competition,</p>
<p>double leg, single leg take down or a pin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, as an OCD person,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something so comforting</p>
<p>about a well executed pin</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like two seconds</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like everything is flush and nice.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s all clean.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, this OCD person who likes to align show,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just beautiful.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s good technique.</p>
<p>And wrestling also provides you,</p>
<p>maybe more than other sports,</p>
<p>the feeling of dominating another human.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Of breaking, no, not just of them being very cocky</p>
<p>and very powerful,</p>
<p>you feel this power of another human being</p>
<p>and then you breaking them.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m not as honest as Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>But that, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever sort of looked in the mirror</p>
<p>and said like, that that was, I enjoyed that aspect of it.</p>
<p>But it certainly seems like you chase that.</p>
<p>So when I was a wrestler in high school,</p>
<p>I lost so many matches because of over aggressiveness.</p>
<p>Like, I would pick the top position and let you stand</p>
<p>just so that I could do a mat return.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t trying to return you to the mat.</p>
<p>I was actually trying to like drive you through the mat</p>
<p>and through the ground.</p>
<p>Like I took, like, it gave me joy to do that.</p>
<p>Like, it wasn&rsquo;t like I was trying to, you know,</p>
<p>just return you to the mat so that I could pin you.</p>
<p>That what you just talked about,</p>
<p>like the dominating another person,</p>
<p>I used to look at that as you&rsquo;ve got someone</p>
<p>who in theory is equally trained</p>
<p>and equally skilled as you are.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re absolutely out there totally dominating them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s joy in that.</p>
<p>You could get in an MMA fight</p>
<p>and you could take someone down and you could mount them.</p>
<p>And all that feels great.</p>
<p>But when you start raining down the punches</p>
<p>on their face from mount and like dropping elbows and stuff,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s another level of satisfaction there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s tough to describe.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that everyone is made for it.</p>
<p>When I was, I think when I was a senior in high school,</p>
<p>my wrestling coach said, look,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to stop with all this crazy aggressive wrestling.</p>
<p>Like they tried to turn me into a technician</p>
<p>and it did work to a degree.</p>
<p>And it was a humongous shift for me in terms of success,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t the same level of enjoyment out of it.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I got disqualified from New England</p>
<p>because my coach said cross face and I cross face</p>
<p>and he said harder.</p>
<p>And I basically wound up and blasted a kid in the face</p>
<p>and his nose got busted everywhere.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t think not to do it because that felt good.</p>
<p>It felt good to cross face him like that.</p>
<p>I was a lot of like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird American warrior ethos that I&rsquo;ve picked up,</p>
<p>but I also have in me the Russian, the Setyaev brothers</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t see it, don&rsquo;t see it as that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get draw,</p>
<p>they think that there is a tension between the art</p>
<p>of the martial art and the violence of the martial art.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a poetic way I could put it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not so fascinated with this Dan Gable</p>
<p>dominating another human.</p>
<p>They think of the effortlessness of the technique</p>
<p>and your mastery of the art is exhibited</p>
<p>in its effortlessness,</p>
<p>how much you lose yourself in the moment and the timing,</p>
<p>that just the beauty of a timing.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s much more, like one example in judo,</p>
<p>but also in wrestling, you can look at the foot sweep.</p>
<p>Wrestlers in America and even judo players in America</p>
<p>and much of the world don&rsquo;t admire the beauty</p>
<p>of the foot sweep, but a well timed foot sweep,</p>
<p>which is a way to sort of off balance</p>
<p>to find the right timing to just effortlessly</p>
<p>change the table, turn the tables of,</p>
<p>I mean, dominate your opponent is seen as the highest form</p>
<p>of mastery in Russian wrestling.</p>
<p>In the case of judo, it&rsquo;s in Japanese judo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what that tension is about.</p>
<p>I think it actually takes me back to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you listened to Dan Carlin,</p>
<p>Hardcore History and Genghis Khan, if you&rsquo;ve ever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a great, great book.</p>
<p>On Genghis Khan?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to adjust.</p>
<p>Most of my life said Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>but the right pronunciation is actually Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tension there.</p>
<p>We kind of think, I don&rsquo;t know we,</p>
<p>I kind of thought as Genghis Khan is a ultra violent,</p>
<p>a leader of ultra violent men, but another view,</p>
<p>another way to see them is the people who warriors</p>
<p>that valued extreme competence and mastery of the art</p>
<p>of fighting with weapons, with bows,</p>
<p>with the horse riding, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure exactly where to place them</p>
<p>on my sort of thinking about violence in our human history.</p>
<p>I think in the context of like combat sports,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a difference between an athlete</p>
<p>winning a contest under a certain set of rules</p>
<p>and a fighter winning a fight under those exact same rules.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different approach to it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think one is any better than the other.</p>
<p>Like in MMA, I think a great example would be</p>
<p>George St. Pierre.</p>
<p>George St. Pierre is a tremendous athlete</p>
<p>and he considers himself to be a martial artist first.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to win an athletic competition.</p>
<p>Like Nick Diaz is trying to bust your ass, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different approach to it.</p>
<p>And yes, they&rsquo;ve had different results</p>
<p>at the highest level of competition,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s difficult to attribute the difference in results</p>
<p>just to their approach to the sport</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re different human beings</p>
<p>with different abilities and different physical attributes.</p>
<p>The PsyTF brothers have that luxury of being able</p>
<p>to talk about the beauty of a perfectly timed slide by.</p>
<p>There are other wrestlers that will never be able</p>
<p>to pull that off and therefore they have to pursue</p>
<p>other ways to defeat someone.</p>
<p>And maybe it is the Dan Gable breaking a man&rsquo;s spirit</p>
<p>by outworking him type thing,</p>
<p>which is beautiful in its own way.</p>
<p>But we tend to self select the ways in which</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to be successful</p>
<p>and then kind of take a deep dive into that.</p>
<p>What do you think is more beautiful?</p>
<p>Brute force or effortless execution</p>
<p>of a technique that dominates another human?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a subjective thing</p>
<p>based on what skills you perceive yourself to have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never, I&rsquo;ve never been a slick, super athletic,</p>
<p>dexterous competitor in anything.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always been more of an,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta outwork you, I&rsquo;ve gotta out grind you,</p>
<p>I gotta out mean you.</p>
<p>And so because I&rsquo;ve lived that,</p>
<p>I tend to see the beauty in that more</p>
<p>because I have a perceptual awareness</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t have for the people who have the luxury</p>
<p>of being very slick and athletic</p>
<p>and using beautiful technique.</p>
<p>Now that said, there&rsquo;s a phenomenal little video</p>
<p>the other day I sent to a friend of a compilation</p>
<p>of foot sweeps by Leota Machida in MMA.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re so beautiful and they&rsquo;re so awesome.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t have an appreciation for those,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t emulate those because I lack</p>
<p>the physical ability to do that.</p>
<p>Whereas I at least have a chance to emulate</p>
<p>some of the people who do it through grit</p>
<p>and through outworking people.</p>
<p>But I would love to return to Genghis Khan</p>
<p>and get your thoughts about,</p>
<p>like I have so many mixed feelings</p>
<p>about whether he is evil or not,</p>
<p>whether the violence that he brought to the world</p>
<p>had ultimately, the fact that it had maybe</p>
<p>kind of like Dan Carlin describes,</p>
<p>cleanse the landscape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a reset for the world through violence</p>
<p>had ultimately a progressive effect on human civilization,</p>
<p>even though in the short term it led to massive,</p>
<p>you could say suffering.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of that, man.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on Genghis Khan?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s always difficult to look at a historical figure</p>
<p>and their actions of their time through a modern day lens</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy for us to kind of impugn</p>
<p>their achievements and the things that they did</p>
<p>and say, oh, well, what he did was wrong.</p>
<p>Well, of course that can be true,</p>
<p>but a lot of times we don&rsquo;t actually have</p>
<p>any real good context or concept</p>
<p>of the times they were living in</p>
<p>and what really was deemed wrong and what really wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking at it through a very cushy modern lens.</p>
<p>That being said, from what I&rsquo;ve read about Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>yeah, he was a violent dude,</p>
<p>but also he gave you an option.</p>
<p>When he got to a village, he said,</p>
<p>look, you have a choice,</p>
<p>you can come with us or you can run.</p>
<p>And he gave them an option to join his legion of fighters</p>
<p>who he took very good care of.</p>
<p>He was the first military leader</p>
<p>to pay his soldiers families when they died.</p>
<p>And he did that based on the booty that they got</p>
<p>when they raided a village.</p>
<p>He took that money, he took his share</p>
<p>and they divided that up amongst the soldiers</p>
<p>and then the soldiers families.</p>
<p>I think he also is credited with first horseback mail routes</p>
<p>or something like that, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t he the godfather of the modern postal system?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s the Bernie Sanders of the Mongol Empire.</p>
<p>I do think the offering of surrender is an interesting one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s interesting as a thought experiment,</p>
<p>whether you would sacrifice your way of,</p>
<p>like the pride of nations or the nationalism,</p>
<p>pride of your country,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re willing to give that up to survive.</p>
<p>It depends on who depends on you.</p>
<p>If you have a family and young kids and stuff like that,</p>
<p>I think your obligation is primarily to them</p>
<p>and therefore surrender has to be something</p>
<p>that you consider in that moment in time</p>
<p>so that you can take care of those people.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a man alone and you&rsquo;ve got all these principles</p>
<p>and all this other stuff and you&rsquo;re not down</p>
<p>with what Genghis Khan is doing and what he&rsquo;s selling,</p>
<p>yeah, try and escape, do your thing</p>
<p>and just know what waits on the other side of that</p>
<p>for you potentially.</p>
<p>But I think if there&rsquo;s someone else out there</p>
<p>that depends on you, your obligation should be to them.</p>
<p>It feels like historically people valued principles</p>
<p>more than life in this weight of like,</p>
<p>what do I value more?</p>
<p>The principles I hold versus survival.</p>
<p>It seems that now we don&rsquo;t value principles as much.</p>
<p>Principles could be also religion,</p>
<p>it could be your values, whatever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re okay sort of sacrificing those</p>
<p>for to preserve our survival.</p>
<p>And that applies in all forms like actual survival</p>
<p>or like on social media, like preserving your reputation,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It seems like we, especially in America,</p>
<p>value individual life,</p>
<p>that death is somehow a really bad thing.</p>
<p>As opposed to saying sacrificing your principles</p>
<p>is a very bad thing and everybody dies</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s okay to die.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s horrible is to sacrifice your principles</p>
<p>of who you are just to live another day.</p>
<p>I think a big problem is people don&rsquo;t really even know</p>
<p>what their principles are anymore.</p>
<p>People, social media and just the way that we live nowadays</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re separated from the human contact like this,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not contacting people in a community anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, whether you&rsquo;re religious or not,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re not congregating at a church,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not part of a parish</p>
<p>like you would be like in down South,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not part of that community anymore.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s difficult to figure out</p>
<p>what your principles and values are</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re constantly jumping from one bucket</p>
<p>to the next online.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t get a lot of like direct,</p>
<p>like reasonable feedback from people.</p>
<p>You just get dipshit feedback.</p>
<p>Like, oh, you don&rsquo;t believe this?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re a jerk.</p>
<p>I think the hard thing currently</p>
<p>is having the integrity and character</p>
<p>to stick by principles one under.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to equate murder in the Genghis Khan times</p>
<p>to social media cancel culture,</p>
<p>but it certainly doesn&rsquo;t feel good</p>
<p>when people are attacking on social media.</p>
<p>And it does take a lot of integrity to,</p>
<p>without anger, without emotion,</p>
<p>without mocking others or attacking others unfairly,</p>
<p>standing by the ideas you hold,</p>
<p>or in another way, standing by your friends,</p>
<p>standing by this little group,</p>
<p>like loyalty of the people that you know are good people.</p>
<p>I find that in cancel culture,</p>
<p>one of the sad things is whenever somebody gets</p>
<p>quote unquote canceled,</p>
<p>everybody just gets all their friends become really quiet</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t defend them or worse.</p>
<p>I mean, quiet is at least understandable.</p>
<p>They kind of signal that they throw them out of the bus,</p>
<p>I guess is one way to put it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I think about a lot</p>
<p>because from coming from me, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I hold an ethic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if others hold this ethic.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s this like Russian mobster ethic of like,</p>
<p>you should help your friends bury the body.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t criticize your friends for committing</p>
<p>the murder.</p>
<p>Like there are certain levels of like,</p>
<p>yeah, you have that discussion after you buried the body</p>
<p>that like maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t have done that murder thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I understand that that&rsquo;s a problematic,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the terminology?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a problematic ethical framework</p>
<p>within which to operate.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it feels like what else do we have</p>
<p>in this world except the brotherhood, the sisterhood,</p>
<p>the love we have for a very small community.</p>
<p>But perhaps that&rsquo;s the wrong way of thinking.</p>
<p>Perhaps the 21st century would be defined</p>
<p>by the dissipation of this community,</p>
<p>of this loyalty concept.</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re all just individuals.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And I think you have to have some sort of core framework</p>
<p>of principles and beliefs that you operate on.</p>
<p>And I think what I was referencing is a little bit different.</p>
<p>But to speak to your point,</p>
<p>you need a framework of core principles</p>
<p>on which you can then base a lot of your other decisions.</p>
<p>Like I believe these three things to be true,</p>
<p>whatever they are,</p>
<p>and that will help inform other decisions</p>
<p>you make in your life.</p>
<p>As far as how you treat your friends,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got probably three friends that,</p>
<p>if they called me right now and said,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s bury the body, sorry, Lex, I gotta go.</p>
<p>There are other people in my life that if they said,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;ve got to go bury the body,</p>
<p>I would say, who is this?</p>
<p>So I think it depends on the relationship.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s a good, that&rsquo;s a really good measure.</p>
<p>I would love to have,</p>
<p>I would love that to be in your profile.</p>
<p>People put like pronouns.</p>
<p>I would love to put like, honestly, like objectively,</p>
<p>not self report, but objective,</p>
<p>how many people in your life, if they committed murder,</p>
<p>you would not ask any questions</p>
<p>and you would help them hide the body.</p>
<p>Like, I would love to know that number for people.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think it&rsquo;s a weird thing too,</p>
<p>because you think right away, like, okay,</p>
<p>it must be the group of people that are the closest to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s who you&rsquo;re first thinking of, right?</p>
<p>But obviously for like my best friend,</p>
<p>I would do it, no question about it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve got other people that are close to me</p>
<p>that are close to me in other ways.</p>
<p>And I probably wouldn&rsquo;t do that only</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d do it for me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that is a consideration.</p>
<p>So I guess, is the principle there</p>
<p>then that you do for your friends</p>
<p>what you think they would do for you?</p>
<p>Is that the underlying principle?</p>
<p>Or do you just have a blind loyalty</p>
<p>to people in your life for different reasons?</p>
<p>I got people that are not on my inner circle</p>
<p>that I probably wouldn&rsquo;t help change a tire</p>
<p>at two in the morning if they&rsquo;re on the highway.</p>
<p>But if they called me and said,</p>
<p>hey, we gotta bury the body, I might show up for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just these weird different connections you have.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have close friends that like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably be, exactly, the tire is a good example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, can&rsquo;t you find somebody else to do this?</p>
<p>I think part of that is just this leap of faith</p>
<p>into like giving yourself to the other person</p>
<p>that creates a deep connection</p>
<p>that makes life fulfilling, like meaningful</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t exist if you don&rsquo;t take that leap.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not about the murder.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sort of focusing.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a, I think you have to,</p>
<p>what is it, cross that bridge when you get there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure.</p>
<p>This is just a thought experiment.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, I think about that a lot,</p>
<p>especially these COVID times.</p>
<p>And as like people become more and more isolated</p>
<p>and separated from each other,</p>
<p>like how important is it to have those deep connections</p>
<p>to other humans?</p>
<p>I think especially like what you&rsquo;re talking about there.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the movie, The Town?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great line in the movie</p>
<p>where one of the main characters</p>
<p>walks into his friend&rsquo;s house and he says,</p>
<p>I need your help.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go hurt some people</p>
<p>and you can never ask me about it again.</p>
<p>And the friend looks up and he says,</p>
<p>whose car are we taking?</p>
<p>Like that is the type of person you need in your life.</p>
<p>And the people, like there are people</p>
<p>that will walk through that door and say that to you</p>
<p>and you drop everything you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the people that walk through your door</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, you know what?</p>
<p>I got a hot pocket in the microwave.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit tied up right now,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to help you out.</p>
<p>But you know, I don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have that deep connection with those people.</p>
<p>You mentioned some principles</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve changed your mind on.</p>
<p>Is there, do you wanna go there?</p>
<p>Is there some interesting principles</p>
<p>and the process of changing that is useful to talk about?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really cite a specific thing,</p>
<p>except that understanding that the principles</p>
<p>that you have at different points in your life</p>
<p>can change and it&rsquo;s okay to change them</p>
<p>without being a total pussy</p>
<p>and being bullied by other people</p>
<p>into thinking what you thought was wrong.</p>
<p>If you come to these conclusions of your own volition</p>
<p>and you decide to change them, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And it can be really, it can be really liberating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really liberating to have an idea</p>
<p>that you hold so true to your core belief system</p>
<p>and then to actually have someone change your mind for you</p>
<p>and be okay with it, as opposed to being like, no,</p>
<p>I gotta die with this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really liberating.</p>
<p>There are definitely are ideas you wanna die on that hill</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s ever gonna change your mind.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really liberating to be confident enough</p>
<p>to say, change my mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have some smart motherfuckers around me</p>
<p>who can tell me, listen, you&rsquo;re being a total dipshit.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s rethink this.</p>
<p>Or like I have one friend who does the five whys all the time</p>
<p>and he loves backing me into a corner.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the five whys?</p>
<p>You just, like when someone makes a statement</p>
<p>about something, to really get to the core issue,</p>
<p>they say, if you ask why five times, make a statement,</p>
<p>well, why is that?</p>
<p>And you answer that, well, why?</p>
<p>And you phrase the whys differently, obviously,</p>
<p>but then you get to the core.</p>
<p>They say five times, you can get to the core of the issue.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a challenging thing.</p>
<p>But I find later in life, it&rsquo;s so liberating for me</p>
<p>to be confident enough to be like,</p>
<p>man, was I fucking way off the mark on this</p>
<p>and have my mind changed.</p>
<p>And be able to say that to others that I was wrong.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>That ability, and I never used to have that.</p>
<p>And it feels real good.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a hunger for that too.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re so right, actually, on a personal level,</p>
<p>it feels very good.</p>
<p>Exactly as you said, it&rsquo;s liberating</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re free to then think as opposed to.</p>
<p>Defend.</p>
<p>Yeah, without thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, you get so sick of defending the same thing</p>
<p>over and over and over.</p>
<p>And you start to think about it and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, I would really like to evolve my thought process here.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re constantly defending one point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to let other ideas in.</p>
<p>You discount the possibility</p>
<p>that you can have your mind changed</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re constantly on the defense.</p>
<p>You have to have a crack in the front line</p>
<p>in order to let a new idea come in and possibly flourish.</p>
<p>And maybe the new idea doesn&rsquo;t even prove your current</p>
<p>belief system to be wrong,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s like the water to a seed and it grows</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s something even bigger and better.</p>
<p>And you can start to work with that instead.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a tough thing because I&rsquo;m a stubborn fuck</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very difficult for me, it was historically,</p>
<p>to say I was wrong about this one,</p>
<p>or I messed this one up,</p>
<p>or I wish I could have that one back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a public figure for me thing too,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s a difference between changing your mind</p>
<p>with a small circle of friends</p>
<p>and changing your mind publicly about something,</p>
<p>but it has equal, one echoes the other.</p>
<p>It is equally liberating,</p>
<p>but people will not make that change easy,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s ultimately liberating as a human being,</p>
<p>public figure or not to just think deeply about this world</p>
<p>and to keep changing, which is like,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a deep hunger for that</p>
<p>in like political discourse,</p>
<p>that people are so tribal currently about politics</p>
<p>that they want to see somebody who says,</p>
<p>you know what, I changed my mind on this.</p>
<p>And then keep changing their mind and keep asking questions,</p>
<p>keep showing that they&rsquo;re open minded,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But when you want someone in a position of political power</p>
<p>to change their mind because they realize</p>
<p>that there might be a better way,</p>
<p>not because they realize that by changing their mind,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get a new demographic to vote for them.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s transparent as shit.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to see that.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a person who can&rsquo;t separate their position</p>
<p>from their people they&rsquo;re supposed to be helping.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can usually smell that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re just talking offline about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about Hillary Clinton</p>
<p>where she talked about changing her mind on gay marriage</p>
<p>that it felt like this is a political calculation</p>
<p>versus like really deeply thinking about like,</p>
<p>what things do we do in this world</p>
<p>that violate basic human rights?</p>
<p>Like really thinking about deeply.</p>
<p>And of course politicians are calculating this,</p>
<p>but you can see it.</p>
<p>This is the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like on the human level,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like political policies, but there&rsquo;s also humans.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always liked Bernie Sanders, for example.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, not the later perhaps Bernie Sanders,</p>
<p>but I used to listen to him back in the day.</p>
<p>And it felt that people might disagree with me,</p>
<p>but it felt like there was a real human struggling</p>
<p>with ideas, whatever, agree with him or not,</p>
<p>it felt like he wasn&rsquo;t doing political calculation.</p>
<p>He was just a human.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t be further away from my political ideals,</p>
<p>but also like, there&rsquo;s an obvious authenticity</p>
<p>to his passion for what he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>that is not present in other candidates.</p>
<p>And you could see it,</p>
<p>all these people that have been in politics forever,</p>
<p>like from all the way back</p>
<p>when Hillary was a lawyer in the 70s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of shots of her in a courtroom</p>
<p>in the 70s though, she&rsquo;s looking all right.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got those big glasses on.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s kind of a little bit of a nerdy babe back in the day.</p>
<p>Oh, you mean like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, John Clark says Hillary Clinton was a babe</p>
<p>back in the day.</p>
<p>73 Clinton, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question</p>
<p>about authenticity in politicians.</p>
<p>Do you think like Hillary Clinton,</p>
<p>just the Clintons in general are a good example</p>
<p>that why do you think they become over time so inauthentic?</p>
<p>Is it the system that changes them?</p>
<p>Is it their own hunger for power?</p>
<p>Is it, what is it, or are they always inauthentic?</p>
<p>Well, first I&rsquo;d like to say that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know this,</p>
<p>but I come from a bit of a political dynasty myself.</p>
<p>I was on the student government several times</p>
<p>in high school and my dad won the runoff</p>
<p>in a special election in Bradenton Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s like 700 people there.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So your dad got you the job?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re basically,</p>
<p>a lot of people compare us to the Kennedys.</p>
<p>My guess with the politicians is that,</p>
<p>and you can see it now as we&rsquo;re becoming more cognizant</p>
<p>as people to the political process,</p>
<p>I think the process corrupts people.</p>
<p>And I think that, I don&rsquo;t know the ins and outs of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to people who are far more educated</p>
<p>on it than me and I&rsquo;m unprepared to cite</p>
<p>any of their points.</p>
<p>I think you can see it a little bit in Dan Crenshaw.</p>
<p>Can I say this?</p>
<p>Yeah, I like him.</p>
<p>I really liked Dan,</p>
<p>especially like a year, year and a half ago.</p>
<p>He seemed very level headed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear to me now that as he panders</p>
<p>more and more to the right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s setting himself for a presidential run.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And he just doesn&rsquo;t seem like the same authentic</p>
<p>ideals oriented guy that he did a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>Now I could be wrong on that.</p>
<p>It could be way off.</p>
<p>But I think that you can take someone</p>
<p>as honest as you want to.</p>
<p>When you start them on that path to the presidency,</p>
<p>you become so unbelievably beholden</p>
<p>to so many people and entities along the way</p>
<p>that by the time you get to the final destination,</p>
<p>the Oval Office, all you&rsquo;re doing is paying back</p>
<p>the favors that got you there.</p>
<p>And you never get to serve the people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to serve.</p>
<p>Your primary focus is on your office</p>
<p>and not on the people that you&rsquo;re supposed to be helping.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s a humongous problem.</p>
<p>And like we could talk all about campaign finance reform</p>
<p>and the two party system.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the people who are running for political posts,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re working to keep a job.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not working to improve the lives</p>
<p>of the constituents, which is different.</p>
<p>A long, long time ago, like a lot of politicians,</p>
<p>those were like part time jobs.</p>
<p>And they held other posts out West.</p>
<p>They were ranchers by day and sheriff by night,</p>
<p>whatever the case might be.</p>
<p>But now, such a cushy path for the rest of your life</p>
<p>that the goal is to just be a politician,</p>
<p>not do the things that you think a politician</p>
<p>is supposed to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;ll talk to Dan on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, I like the version of him from a year ago</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t been really paying attention.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be, I&rsquo;ll actually pay more attention now</p>
<p>and ask him that exact question.</p>
<p>Like, how do you prevent yourself from changing,</p>
<p>becoming what the Clintons became?</p>
<p>I tend to believe like there&rsquo;s conspiratorial stuff</p>
<p>about Clintons and all these politicians.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that they were actually</p>
<p>good, thoughtful people back in the day.</p>
<p>And the system changes them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even the system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about just the process of campaigning.</p>
<p>I just think it wears you down to where</p>
<p>if you look at the percentage of time you spend</p>
<p>on the kinds of conversations you have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like one, you do these speeches,</p>
<p>which you repeat the same thing over and over and over.</p>
<p>It beats the process of thinking.</p>
<p>You just exhaust your brain to where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking anymore, you&rsquo;re just repeating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s exceptionally difficult</p>
<p>to keep making speech after speech after speech,</p>
<p>saying the same thing over and over and over again,</p>
<p>and at the same time thinking deeply</p>
<p>and changing your mind and learning.</p>
<p>And then also the pandering to financial,</p>
<p>like having phone calls, like fundraising,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they do now.</p>
<p>They spend most of their time fundraising.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not worried about anything.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt you, but I was gonna say</p>
<p>that you can see there&rsquo;s a fuel.</p>
<p>Like the more attention and the higher regard</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re held in in your community,</p>
<p>and the more sycophants like continue</p>
<p>to blow smoke up your ass,</p>
<p>the more it changes the way you present yourself.</p>
<p>And you can see it in every walk of life.</p>
<p>I mean, jiu jitsu is a tiny, tiny little section</p>
<p>of the world, but you see it in the jiu jitsu community.</p>
<p>When someone all of a sudden starts a social media page</p>
<p>or whatever, and they get a bunch of people,</p>
<p>like basically like cyber fellating them</p>
<p>on their Instagram page, they change.</p>
<p>Fellating, is that a word?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>So giving fellatio?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So fellating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jamie, look it up.</p>
<p>I think, but in those people, it changes their character.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It changes who they are because they become emboldened</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;ve got this like mythical cyber mob</p>
<p>behind them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sign at the entrance to your gym</p>
<p>that reads, for every moment of triumph,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a quote by Hunter S. Thompson.</p>
<p>It reads, for every moment of triumph,</p>
<p>for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.</p>
<p>What does this quote mean to you?</p>
<p>That quote to me is about, mostly about sacrifice.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about to achieve anything great</p>
<p>or anything beautiful or to triumph,</p>
<p>you have to have sacrificed so many things to get there,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re the most unbelievably genetically gifted person</p>
<p>in the world and greatness is just, you know,</p>
<p>falls upon you, it&rsquo;s just raining from the sky.</p>
<p>I think on your path to greatness,</p>
<p>on your path to success and triumph,</p>
<p>you leave a lot of carnage in your wake,</p>
<p>personal relationships, other goals,</p>
<p>things that you didn&rsquo;t pursue, you know,</p>
<p>other unfulfilled dreams.</p>
<p>And you kind of have to sell a lot of that out</p>
<p>in order to be really at the peak of your field</p>
<p>or what you want to be.</p>
<p>I know that that&rsquo;s happened in my life.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s tons and tons of relationships</p>
<p>that, you know, couldn&rsquo;t survive the way</p>
<p>that I was living my life,</p>
<p>because when I was trying to be a big time fighter</p>
<p>or like when I was just training all the time,</p>
<p>tons of relationships dissolve themselves naturally,</p>
<p>some not so naturally.</p>
<p>Some people get it, some people don&rsquo;t get it,</p>
<p>some people hate you, you miss tons of other opportunities.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s kind of what that quote means to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about sacrifice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about you&rsquo;re giving up what you want now</p>
<p>for what you want more.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the trampling of souls, it&rsquo;s messy too,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not clear what the right path is.</p>
<p>Like that sacrifice is not obvious</p>
<p>that those are the right sacrifices to make.</p>
<p>You might be ruining your own life,</p>
<p>but the fact that you&rsquo;re willing to take that risk</p>
<p>and sort of go all in on whether it&rsquo;s stupid or not,</p>
<p>go all in on something,</p>
<p>that the possibility of creating something beautiful</p>
<p>is there.</p>
<p>Who says it&rsquo;s stupid?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going all in on it, you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>Someone else might think it&rsquo;s stupid,</p>
<p>but I mean, who really cares?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m of many minds on many things,</p>
<p>so I feel like there&rsquo;s certain minds,</p>
<p>certain moves of the day where you think it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>Like relationships is a beautiful one,</p>
<p>which is, you&rsquo;ve seen the movie Whiplash, by any chance?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It seems like in a man&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>or it could be a woman&rsquo;s, but I don&rsquo;t identify as a woman,</p>
<p>so I know the man, the lived experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 2020, bro.</p>
<p>But my lived experience for now is that of a man.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see about tomorrow.</p>
<p>And there is, in the pursuit of excellence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s often a choice of,</p>
<p>some of the souls that must be trampled</p>
<p>are personal relationships with humans in your life</p>
<p>that you might deeply care about.</p>
<p>It could be family, it could be friends,</p>
<p>it could be loved ones of all different forms.</p>
<p>It could be the people that, your colleagues</p>
<p>that are dependent on you, people who will lose jobs</p>
<p>because of the decisions you make, all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It seems that that moment happens,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure that sacrifice is always the correct one.</p>
<p>Like, to me, the movie Whiplash,</p>
<p>for people who haven&rsquo;t seen, spoiler alert, maybe?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if that movie has any spoilers,</p>
<p>but there is a relationship with a female.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a student, there&rsquo;s a drummer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pursuing excellence</p>
<p>of this particular art form of drumming,</p>
<p>and he has a brief, fleeting relationship with a female,</p>
<p>and he also has an instructor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pushing him to his limits</p>
<p>in what appears to be awfully a lot</p>
<p>like a toxic relationship.</p>
<p>And he chooses, not chooses,</p>
<p>he naturally makes the decision</p>
<p>to sacrifice the romantic relationship with the woman</p>
<p>in further pursuit of this chaos of,</p>
<p>this chaotic pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t feel like a deliberate decision.</p>
<p>It feels like a giant mess of like an emotional mess</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just like,</p>
<p>kind of like a fish swimming against stream,</p>
<p>just like, fuck it.</p>
<p>You let go of all the things that convention says</p>
<p>you should appreciate.</p>
<p>You throw away the possibility of a stable life,</p>
<p>of a comfortable life,</p>
<p>of what society says is a meaningful life,</p>
<p>and just pursue this crazy thing</p>
<p>full of seeming toxicity</p>
<p>with crazy people surrounding you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what the right decision is.</p>
<p>Part of my brain says, you should stay with the girl.</p>
<p>Fuck that instructor that&rsquo;s making you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pushing you to places where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>that are destructive, potentially destructive,</p>
<p>like could lead to suicide,</p>
<p>could lead you to completely</p>
<p>fail or fail on your pursuit of excellence</p>
<p>or destroy the dream,</p>
<p>the passionate pursuit of the thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve always dreamed for,</p>
<p>in that case is drumming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many minds there.</p>
<p>Like what is the right thing to do?</p>
<p>So my first two thoughts are,</p>
<p>number one, fuck convention.</p>
<p>What is convention?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some laid out path,</p>
<p>some linear progression of the way your life</p>
<p>is supposed to go,</p>
<p>like that someone can draw a picture of at the end.</p>
<p>That shit&rsquo;s, first of all, it&rsquo;s just boring and whatever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t wanna say that it&rsquo;s cowardly</p>
<p>because it isn&rsquo;t cowardly,</p>
<p>but for someone who&rsquo;s not conventional</p>
<p>to not be nonconventional is cowardly,</p>
<p>to get sucked into the convention.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s first.</p>
<p>Second of all,</p>
<p>I believe that scene in the diner in that movie</p>
<p>where he tells her you&rsquo;re in my way</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m gonna want to be with you,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to want me to be going out to dinner</p>
<p>with you and I know I should be practicing,</p>
<p>or I know I should be training.</p>
<p>And ultimately I&rsquo;m gonna make,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m either gonna feel bad about not being with you</p>
<p>by training,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna skip the training to be with you</p>
<p>and neither one is right.</p>
<p>The whole thing that they don&rsquo;t mention in that</p>
<p>is that that&rsquo;s the wrong girl.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the wrong girl.</p>
<p>The right girl is a gangster.</p>
<p>The right girl says, oh, you&rsquo;ve practiced tonight?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you a sandwich and some milk</p>
<p>so that you can, outside the door,</p>
<p>let me know when you&rsquo;re done,</p>
<p>or you have some free time.</p>
<p>The right girl compliments that.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not an impediment in any way.</p>
<p>Even if what you wanna do is be with her so much</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re putting the drums down,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re putting the bass down,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re picking up the pizza,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not going to training,</p>
<p>that girl, without even telling you</p>
<p>why she&rsquo;s making decisions,</p>
<p>is making decisions to help you achieve your goal.</p>
<p>Now that might sound like some sort of chauvinistic</p>
<p>king of the castle type shit</p>
<p>where everyone should cater to you,</p>
<p>but the fact of the matter is</p>
<p>that person is a compliment to your life</p>
<p>in helping you do your thing,</p>
<p>and in your own way you&rsquo;re helping them</p>
<p>to achieve whatever their goals are also.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uncommon that you have two people under the same roof</p>
<p>striving to be unbelievably excellent in one small area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not impossible, but it&rsquo;s uncommon.</p>
<p>Relationships have to be like binary systems,</p>
<p>like two stars.</p>
<p>The gravitational pull is what keeps you together</p>
<p>and circling around one another, right?</p>
<p>And one is bigger than the other,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll fluctuate,</p>
<p>and the stars will get bigger,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get smaller,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll contract based on positioning and composition.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way a relationship should be,</p>
<p>not an asteroid coming in to disrupt</p>
<p>the surface of your planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a binary system, it&rsquo;s a compliment.</p>
<p>That girl was the wrong girl for him.</p>
<p>So you shouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like the big unconventional dreams</p>
<p>should not be adjusted to fit into this world.</p>
<p>Because I mean, there is a part of me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like full of self thought,</p>
<p>well, maybe you&rsquo;re just a dick.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, who cares?</p>
<p>Lex, so first of all,</p>
<p>who cares?</p>
<p>This is, by the way, somebody who&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you have recently gotten,</p>
<p>well, in the span of the history of the universe</p>
<p>is recently you&rsquo;ve gotten to a relationship,</p>
<p>but you haven&rsquo;t always,</p>
<p>you have not felt the need to be in the relationship</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>by society&rsquo;s kind of momentum.</p>
<p>If you, I think that if you really want anything,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to be prepared fully to be the exact opposite.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a person who&rsquo;s looking for a relationship,</p>
<p>the only way you&rsquo;re going to get in an awesome relationship</p>
<p>is by being comfortable being alone,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the risk.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a person who&rsquo;s driven by money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to be comfortable being totally poor</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the risk, right?</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re constantly hedging your bets,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never all in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never all in on the thing you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>So a relationship has to compliment your life.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say, it&rsquo;s okay to want to be in a relationship,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t want to be in a relationship so bad</p>
<p>that you take someone in who fits the suit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, oh, our schedules kind of work out.</p>
<p>You live near me and this and that and the other thing,</p>
<p>because the logistics of a relationship</p>
<p>are not always perfect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what matters is when the two people are together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the perfect part of it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great to want to meet people and say,</p>
<p>if we meet and some sort of a relationship develops,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to run with it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not meeting you hoping a relationship develops.</p>
<p>I think you kind of put the cart before the horse</p>
<p>in a lot of those situations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when guys meet.</p>
<p>No guy goes out and is like, I&rsquo;m looking for a bro, right?</p>
<p>Nobody does that.</p>
<p>You go to the gym and you run into a bunch of dudes</p>
<p>and the next thing you know, someone&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>and they want to talk about fighting</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fucking shotgun and beers.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden you got a bro and that&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>It works the same way with women.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a shotgun and beers?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show you after this.</p>
<p>You poke a hole in the bottom and you open the top.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the problem with America.</p>
<p>Drink vodka like a man.</p>
<p>Okay, now don&rsquo;t poke holes in beers.</p>
<p>This is the problem with the frat culture.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really know how to drink.</p>
<p>They think they know how to drink.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know how to drink.</p>
<p>What do you think makes a successful relationship</p>
<p>if we can linger on that a little longer?</p>
<p>Like, let me ask John Clark about love.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t ask a question, but let me just say love.</p>
<p>About love.</p>
<p>Are you one of those people who never says I love you?</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m an extreme person.</p>
<p>And like my emotions are also extreme.</p>
<p>And one of the things I concern myself with,</p>
<p>maybe this is philosophical and martial arts warrior</p>
<p>soldier type related stuff is like, I don&rsquo;t want anyone.</p>
<p>If I die tonight on the drive home,</p>
<p>hopefully that doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I hope that no one is left questioning</p>
<p>how I felt about them.</p>
<p>And people I don&rsquo;t like probably are not questioning that.</p>
<p>And so the thing that I&rsquo;ve had to learn</p>
<p>how to do later in life is to tell the people</p>
<p>that you care about, that you care about them.</p>
<p>And each thing can be equally off putting</p>
<p>to the receiver of the message.</p>
<p>Each thing can be equally off putting</p>
<p>to the receiver of the message.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re letting someone know how much you dislike them,</p>
<p>that can be off putting to the person</p>
<p>receiving that message.</p>
<p>And when you tell someone how much you care about them,</p>
<p>it can also be off putting to the person,</p>
<p>depending on how they view their relationship with you.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still important to get it out there.</p>
<p>Like you shouldn&rsquo;t hold those things in</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re worried about how they&rsquo;ll be received</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;ll come back at you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re okay going all in on these?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not afraid of commitment?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not afraid of commitment.</p>
<p>Anyone who says they&rsquo;re afraid of commitment</p>
<p>is full of shit.</p>
<p>You know what they&rsquo;re afraid of?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid of commitment with that person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re afraid of.</p>
<p>Like when someone knocks you on your ass</p>
<p>and they come into your life</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re flush with all these emotions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not worried about,</p>
<p>oh, I don&rsquo;t really like commitment.</p>
<p>No, because they&rsquo;ve knocked you on your ass.</p>
<p>You want to be with them.</p>
<p>You want those things.</p>
<p>The two most alive points in your life,</p>
<p>I think people feel is the euphoria of a new relationship</p>
<p>and then the loss when that love is gone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never feel more, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>than in those moments in your life.</p>
<p>See, the nice thing about the loss is it lasts longer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a Louis C.K. point that he makes,</p>
<p>which is like that,</p>
<p>like in his show, I think,</p>
<p>is a conversation with an older gentleman</p>
<p>that says like that&rsquo;s his favorite part</p>
<p>of the relationship is that period</p>
<p>between the loss of the relationship</p>
<p>and the real death, which is forgetting the person.</p>
<p>But that period lasts the longest</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like the most fulfilling,</p>
<p>like missing the other person</p>
<p>is as fulfilling as the actual love,</p>
<p>the early infatuation, which is interesting.</p>
<p>I also think of the Bukowski.</p>
<p>I return to that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little clip of him in an interview</p>
<p>saying that love is a fog</p>
<p>that dissipates with the first light of reality</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So basically emphasizing</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s this very, very, very fleeting thing,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a moments thing and then it just fades</p>
<p>and everything else is something else.</p>
<p>So love is only a temporary thing, which is interesting.</p>
<p>I think some people say that&rsquo;s cynical.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to think of it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>that everything is fleeting</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t put effort into it.</p>
<p>Almost everything will be fleeting.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t put effort into it,</p>
<p>most people will get fat and lazy.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t put effort into something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna not be good at playing guitar or playing bass.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to put effort into it.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for a relationship.</p>
<p>That the awesome part of it, that like love part,</p>
<p>that dies soon and early on in a relationship</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so good</p>
<p>that we think we don&rsquo;t have to work at it, but you do.</p>
<p>You have to keep doing the things</p>
<p>and you gotta keep things new and crisp and fresh.</p>
<p>And different people probably feel differently about this,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, you walk around your girl</p>
<p>and you start like farting and stuff,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s when it all dies.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it dies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all human beings.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all here and our bodies work in the same way,</p>
<p>but you start to chip away at this beautiful thing</p>
<p>when you buck conventional courtesy and things like that.</p>
<p>Well, take it for granted, basically.</p>
<p>You take it for granted, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the same thing with life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of meditating on death</p>
<p>that you could die today.</p>
<p>In the same way you should meditate</p>
<p>on this relationship could end today,</p>
<p>this connection with another human could be.</p>
<p>This is the last time you could be interacting.</p>
<p>And your chances of that increase</p>
<p>when you take it for granted and you shit on people.</p>
<p>But when you work at it, the chances of that decrease.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never gonna be zero, but it decreases.</p>
<p>And when you do that, when you&rsquo;re the person</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to maintain</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to work at the relationship,</p>
<p>you gotta make sure that both people are working at it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you&rsquo;re just a fucking chump.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s return back to mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>Let me ask the ridiculous question</p>
<p>of who do you think are the top three,</p>
<p>maybe top five greatest fighters of all time?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to compare fighters across generations.</p>
<p>And maybe one way to say it is which metrics</p>
<p>would you put on the table</p>
<p>as to measure what a great fighter is?</p>
<p>There was a guy named Dioxapus.</p>
<p>And in the fourth century, and he was such a badass</p>
<p>that in the Olympics in 336 BC,</p>
<p>no one even showed up to fight him in the Pancration event.</p>
<p>Nobody even showed up because he was fucking everybody up.</p>
<p>Years later, he was retired.</p>
<p>And this crazy Macedonian dude came there</p>
<p>at some dinner for Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s chilling, drinking,</p>
<p>whatever they were drinking out of their chalices.</p>
<p>And this Macedonian dude threatened him and challenged him.</p>
<p>So Dioxapus said, yeah, man, we&rsquo;ll throw down.</p>
<p>And they set the time and the place.</p>
<p>Macedonian dude comes out like body armor,</p>
<p>spear, shield, all this other shit.</p>
<p>Dioxapus came out absolutely naked with a wooden club</p>
<p>and took on this much younger guy,</p>
<p>beat the living crap out of him</p>
<p>and then put his foot on his throat</p>
<p>and then didn&rsquo;t even kill him in the show of ultimate power</p>
<p>for the time.</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the guy being naked too</p>
<p>is just extra demeaning.</p>
<p>Extra demeaning, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, can we rephrase the question then?</p>
<p>Because those are clearly going to be</p>
<p>some probably forgotten warriors in history.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s take it to like modern day mixed martial arts</p>
<p>in the UFC, perhaps.</p>
<p>Well, just mixed martial arts there.</p>
<p>Who do you think are the top fighters of all time?</p>
<p>What metrics would you consider</p>
<p>in trying to answer this perhaps unanswerable question?</p>
<p>I think one of the things you want to think about</p>
<p>is strength of opponent at the time you fought them.</p>
<p>So for example, fighting BJ Penn in his prime</p>
<p>and beating him is far different</p>
<p>than beating BJ Penn last year, right?</p>
<p>So to say you have a victory over BJ Penn</p>
<p>is not the same given the timeframe of when it happened.</p>
<p>Not to take anything away from anyone who&rsquo;s beaten BJ Penn.</p>
<p>Just use that as an example of someone whose career</p>
<p>went into a different direction.</p>
<p>I would say the guy who I think is probably the best</p>
<p>that people are the least familiar with</p>
<p>would be Marillo Bustamante.</p>
<p>And I think he was a guy who was one of the guys</p>
<p>with the first really good physical build for MMA,</p>
<p>which I think is narrow from the chest to the back</p>
<p>and long shoulder to shoulder</p>
<p>and kind of sinewy made out of steel cable.</p>
<p>That was a guy who could box,</p>
<p>that was a guy who could wrestle,</p>
<p>and that was a guy who had great jujitsu.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t a great kickboxer,</p>
<p>but at the time he didn&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>Fought everybody and gave everybody a run.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s probably one of those guys</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gotta be considered.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a few killers that never,</p>
<p>because why is he not in the discussion?</p>
<p>Because I think greatness requires both the skill</p>
<p>and the opportunity to meet each other.</p>
<p>And when you talk about a fighter,</p>
<p>the other thing that really a good fighter needs</p>
<p>to become great is a foil.</p>
<p>And so many fighters don&rsquo;t have a foil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the biggest detractions, I think,</p>
<p>of early Mike Tyson&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a foil.</p>
<p>He had no one driving him.</p>
<p>And by the time he did,</p>
<p>by the time he had a foil in Holyfield,</p>
<p>his career was in a different place.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s one of the greats of all time,</p>
<p>and he never really had a foil,</p>
<p>so his greatness was in unparalleled destruction</p>
<p>of like nobody as well, of lesser opponents.</p>
<p>Right, and so when people debate</p>
<p>the level of greatness of Mike Tyson,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the things they say,</p>
<p>like he didn&rsquo;t fight a lot of killers in their prime.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve obviously got to say in that conversation,</p>
<p>I have a really difficult time</p>
<p>keeping George St. Pierre out of the conversation,</p>
<p>only because he was able to beat you with anything.</p>
<p>He could out jab you, he could out wrestle you,</p>
<p>and he could submit you.</p>
<p>The problem I have with Fedor</p>
<p>is his career also took a drastic turn towards the end.</p>
<p>And when he was fighting in Pride,</p>
<p>he was doing a lot more grappling,</p>
<p>and then he just started casting</p>
<p>that overhand right at people.</p>
<p>And his game kind of changed at that point.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take anything away from his greatness,</p>
<p>but at that time, the great heavyweights</p>
<p>were not really fighting in Pride,</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t really exist yet.</p>
<p>And by the time he fought a really good one,</p>
<p>Fabricio Verdun, he did get submitted there.</p>
<p>Does his later performance color your and our perception</p>
<p>of his greatness in general about fighters?</p>
<p>Not mine, but I&rsquo;m someone who&rsquo;s intimately involved</p>
<p>in the sport, but it colors everyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Same with Anderson Silva.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Anderson Silva doesn&rsquo;t want to fight</p>
<p>in like seven years or something, or he&rsquo;s like one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a guy who in his prime was one of the best fighters.</p>
<p>Is he in the top five for you?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s probably in the top five, yeah.</p>
<p>Greater striker of all time or no?</p>
<p>In MMA?</p>
<p>In mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>In mixed martial arts?</p>
<p>In mixed martial arts, that&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>The greatest MMA striker of all time.</p>
<p>Because like the timing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about foot sweeps, right?</p>
<p>Who makes it look easier than Anderson Silva?</p>
<p>I think in an incredibly short sample of his prime,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotta be Anderson Silva,</p>
<p>and I think you have to consider discussing Leota Machida</p>
<p>for his unbelievable manipulation of distance,</p>
<p>which is something that people don&rsquo;t really talk too much</p>
<p>about in terms of fighting,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re someone in the sport.</p>
<p>That his use of distance and the ability to like,</p>
<p>what we call pop out, like make you miss by one inch</p>
<p>so that he could follow your fist back in</p>
<p>as you retract it and it hit you over the top,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a thing of beauty.</p>
<p>Anderson Silva, when he became a counter striker,</p>
<p>when he got to his prime in the UFC,</p>
<p>That was a thing of beauty.</p>
<p>So I think definitely those two guys</p>
<p>and Murilo Bustamante&rsquo;s gotta be the third guy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so many good guys now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>So where do you put, in terms of metrics,</p>
<p>you mentioned GSP and Anderson Silva,</p>
<p>I think they have a large number of defenses of a title.</p>
<p>Is that important to you?</p>
<p>Like this kind of consistent domination?</p>
<p>No, because it&rsquo;s easily manipulated</p>
<p>by the people making money off the fights.</p>
<p>So there was a great quote one time</p>
<p>when the UFC was coming to prominence</p>
<p>and Vince McMahon from the WWE, he said,</p>
<p>you know, the difference between what we do</p>
<p>and what UFC does is that when we have a superstar,</p>
<p>I can make sure he stays on top</p>
<p>until he&rsquo;s no longer a superstar</p>
<p>because we have predetermined results.</p>
<p>UFC can&rsquo;t do that because they&rsquo;re actually having fights.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s true and false.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>but you can give your superstars the most favorable matchups</p>
<p>to keep them on top for the longest.</p>
<p>So people always talk about title defenses</p>
<p>as if the guy they&rsquo;re fighting, the challenger,</p>
<p>is always the person most deserving of the shot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t put that much stock in it.</p>
<p>Is it possible to put a guy in consideration</p>
<p>as one of the greats</p>
<p>if all they had is one or two amazing fights?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you, like an amazing</p>
<p>could be a lot of different definitions.</p>
<p>It could be just the war.</p>
<p>Like they never really reached</p>
<p>the highest of excellences of domination,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve, like this,</p>
<p>we had this discussion about Kyle Bokniak, right?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s a perfect example.</p>
<p>He had this famous fight against Zabit Magomed Sharapov,</p>
<p>where on one side you have an Anderson Silva type of fighter</p>
<p>and Zabit, like just a very good striker.</p>
<p>Like, and then there&rsquo;s like the warrior on the Kyle side.</p>
<p>And just the fight,</p>
<p>they created something special together.</p>
<p>It was fight at night, whatever.</p>
<p>But the, you know, that fight was special on that night</p>
<p>because the two dance partners.</p>
<p>You can have a great performance</p>
<p>without being a great fighter.</p>
<p>Not saying neither of those guys is a great fighter,</p>
<p>but to answer your first question,</p>
<p>I think that having one or two great performances</p>
<p>does not necessarily mean that you are great.</p>
<p>I need a larger sample size.</p>
<p>I have no idea what that is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any idea what that is.</p>
<p>And also,</p>
<p>where, how much weight does toughness have</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about the criteria</p>
<p>when you define a great fighter?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have the answer to it.</p>
<p>I admire the underdog that rises to the occasion</p>
<p>through brute force.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t bring the skillset to the table</p>
<p>that perhaps some of the greats have,</p>
<p>but they rose to the occasion.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about that.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re more talking about like</p>
<p>the internal attributes</p>
<p>as opposed to the external physical attributes.</p>
<p>And those are the things I think that you cannot teach.</p>
<p>Those things, you come in the door</p>
<p>and you either have that or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think, and we talk about this all the time,</p>
<p>and this is one of the things</p>
<p>where my mind changes regularly.</p>
<p>Like on what makes a fighter,</p>
<p>is it born or is it bred?</p>
<p>And this week I&rsquo;m of the opinion that it&rsquo;s in you.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s in you and you suppress it</p>
<p>and people can tease it out of you,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think you can make someone</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t have that seed in there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can turn them into that great warrior</p>
<p>with that level of grit and mental toughness.</p>
<p>Now, when that fight, when Kyle fights Zabit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a unique situation for both guys.</p>
<p>It was kind of a later replacement fight for Kyle.</p>
<p>Zabit&rsquo;s star was on the rise.</p>
<p>And Kyle put the blueprint out there on how to beat Zabit.</p>
<p>Which is?</p>
<p>Which is pressure him</p>
<p>and try and drag him into the late rounds.</p>
<p>You notice that later on when Calvin Kader fought him,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t give him five rounds.</p>
<p>They wanted five rounds.</p>
<p>And Zabit&rsquo;s camp, from what I understand,</p>
<p>would not agree to the five round fight.</p>
<p>Well, he didn&rsquo;t look.</p>
<p>Right, so with Kyle, it was a three round fight.</p>
<p>Three round fight.</p>
<p>And did it went to decision?</p>
<p>It went to decision.</p>
<p>Well, Zabit won the decision, clearly.</p>
<p>Did Kyle have a shot at winning the third round?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the exact score,</p>
<p>but Kyle could have won the third round</p>
<p>had he done a couple things differently.</p>
<p>But I do believe in the fourth round,</p>
<p>I think Kyle wouldn&rsquo;t have won a fourth round.</p>
<p>And I think maybe even won the fight</p>
<p>if there would have been a fifth round.</p>
<p>And he was pressing forward,</p>
<p>perhaps in a funny way that you could tell me I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but it felt like he wasn&rsquo;t emphasizing head movement</p>
<p>at that point.</p>
<p>He went full Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>There was a point at which,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s funny that you say that.</p>
<p>Which is a contradiction, actually, because.</p>
<p>Mike Tyson had great head movement.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know exactly what I mean</p>
<p>because he was in the pocket.</p>
<p>I think he was trying to do the movement.</p>
<p>He was just in the pocket and pressing forward.</p>
<p>And the fuck you attitude of just not pressing down.</p>
<p>That was a little bit later</p>
<p>when Zabit&rsquo;s back was towards the cage.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the round.</p>
<p>We get that fight.</p>
<p>And I said to Kyle, I was like,</p>
<p>look, this kid has been training martial arts</p>
<p>since he was three years old.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not an area where you&rsquo;re gonna out technique him.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve gotta now channel some of that grit</p>
<p>that we know you have.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to showcase it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how long I did it for,</p>
<p>because Kyle&rsquo;s much shorter than Zabit.</p>
<p>So for a good long while,</p>
<p>while we were training for Zabit,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even say anything.</p>
<p>And I just had clips of Mike Tyson training</p>
<p>on the TV in the gym and the head movement.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t even mention it.</p>
<p>And then we started to like get into it</p>
<p>and talk about getting inside the length</p>
<p>of the longer fighter and things like that.</p>
<p>And we kind of, which when some people train MMA,</p>
<p>they say, okay, this guy&rsquo;s a really good wrestler.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about avoiding the wrestling</p>
<p>or being a better wrestler.</p>
<p>And I think that when the difference in skill is so great,</p>
<p>those are both the wrong answer.</p>
<p>If a guy who&rsquo;s a really good wrestler wants to take you down</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have a lot of wrestling experience,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably gonna get you down</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s got a good coach, right?</p>
<p>So you have to deal with that.</p>
<p>To then say, I&rsquo;m gonna then learn in eight weeks</p>
<p>how to wrestle better than a guy who&rsquo;s been wrestling</p>
<p>since he was eight years old is also a bad idea.</p>
<p>So what we concentrated on for that camp</p>
<p>and it worked beautifully was</p>
<p>not getting caught in chain wrestling.</p>
<p>These are the takedowns you&rsquo;re gonna get caught with.</p>
<p>This is how to not get caught with the next step</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re defending takedown one.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s the chain of techniques</p>
<p>that are gonna get fucked, right?</p>
<p>So we talked, we did a ton of work on get ups</p>
<p>and breaking the hands from the various takedowns.</p>
<p>Like it was a while ago now.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t remember exactly the techniques we worked on,</p>
<p>but we concentrated on defend the first takedown</p>
<p>and stay out of the chain.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get chained into a bunch of wrestling techniques</p>
<p>cause you will be out wrestled.</p>
<p>And that was really successful.</p>
<p>And then in the third round, Zabit was tired.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>He was tired.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Zabit got tired.</p>
<p>He cuts a tremendous amount of weight.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t see him staying at 145 forever</p>
<p>when they start giving him five round fights.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if he&rsquo;s had a five round fight</p>
<p>and he may have, but I can&rsquo;t see him staying down there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, the guy&rsquo;s like six one.</p>
<p>Guys, he&rsquo;s a giant of a guy.</p>
<p>So Kyle pressed forward there and he said,</p>
<p>he felt that there was no power left in Zabit&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>And so he felt fine.</p>
<p>And I think part of it was he fed off the crowd</p>
<p>as he moved forward and, you know,</p>
<p>saw that he wasn&rsquo;t taking a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Like the punches weren&rsquo;t staying him.</p>
<p>He started walking right through him.</p>
<p>It goes to your question of what makes a fighter.</p>
<p>Was the, him walking forward like that,</p>
<p>something that you&rsquo;re born with</p>
<p>or is that something you were training?</p>
<p>Is that the Mike Tyson on TV?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s born with that.</p>
<p>Kyle is born with that.</p>
<p>And the crowd, I&rsquo;ve been in a lot.</p>
<p>Was he in Boston?</p>
<p>No, he was in New York.</p>
<p>He was in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in a lot of arenas</p>
<p>for a lot of different sporting events.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the loudest things I&rsquo;ve ever heard</p>
<p>when he did that.</p>
<p>I was going crazy.</p>
<p>And you ask about that being like taught or not.</p>
<p>Kyle is so much like that,</p>
<p>that I have to try and tease some of that out of him,</p>
<p>pull it back.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s also so very technical when he wants to be</p>
<p>that the emotion and the fun of it</p>
<p>gets in the way of his technique.</p>
<p>And probably has cost him a couple of wins.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>we work on with him right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like staying within yourself, being a professional,</p>
<p>taking your time to download the information in round one</p>
<p>and then starting your fight in round two.</p>
<p>But the tension between those two things,</p>
<p>what makes, what on that day created one of the,</p>
<p>in my opinion, one of the greatest fights I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan agrees.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s one of the greatest fights</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve certainly ever seen.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s funny that you as a coach,</p>
<p>I can see the frustration of like,</p>
<p>like throwing away some of the strategy kind of thing.</p>
<p>Like you seeing like being not happy</p>
<p>that there could be things</p>
<p>that he could have done to win the fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in retrospect.</p>
<p>I think that at that time,</p>
<p>we were playing with incredible house money.</p>
<p>Like Kyle was a gigantic underdog in that fight.</p>
<p>Zabit was unstoppable.</p>
<p>I think people were probably picking him</p>
<p>to finish the fight in round one.</p>
<p>I think at that point,</p>
<p>no one had ever gone the distance with Zabit.</p>
<p>And no one certainly had, you know,</p>
<p>put that kind of performance together.</p>
<p>And I think Kyle put the blueprint out there.</p>
<p>And in retrospect, when I look at the last round,</p>
<p>yeah, there were things that could have been done differently,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re playing with house money at that point.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, let it fly.</p>
<p>You get to a point where you&rsquo;ve got it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re down three rounds and there&rsquo;s 20 seconds left.</p>
<p>You got to move all your chips to the center of the table</p>
<p>and, you know, see what happens.</p>
<p>Do you remember what Joe Rogan said about it?</p>
<p>I remember like he got won over.</p>
<p>I think I have trouble remembering</p>
<p>because offline we talked about that fight</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s exceptionally impressed by,</p>
<p>I mean, Joe&rsquo;s from Boston, so it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a story there.</p>
<p>Okay, it sucks not,</p>
<p>you naturally want to romanticize,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a Rocky versus like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a Rocky IV, a Draga.</p>
<p>I mean, similar, I suppose, kind of chemistry.</p>
<p>Kyle&rsquo;s style represents the American.</p>
<p>Ideal, right?</p>
<p>The spirit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he&rsquo;s from Gloucester.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you could have dragged him off the docks</p>
<p>three hours before the fight and said,</p>
<p>hey, you want to go fight?</p>
<p>And he would have said yes.</p>
<p>Oh man, that was a special fight.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, as per a discussion</p>
<p>of like greatest fighters of all time,</p>
<p>I tend to believe that that fight is more special</p>
<p>than the championship belt defenses by George St. Pierre.</p>
<p>Like, you know, there&rsquo;s something to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Rocky, Rocky I is more special</p>
<p>than like Rocky III, right?</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s the underdog or it&rsquo;s whatever,</p>
<p>like the dance partner is like going to war</p>
<p>and like that moment, I mean, it&rsquo;s bigger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bigger than any individual fighter.</p>
<p>They create that and that,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not perhaps good for a career.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not good for like in terms of money,</p>
<p>in terms of longevity,</p>
<p>in terms of all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a special moment in the history of fighting</p>
<p>that you both created.</p>
<p>I can remember like right after,</p>
<p>like there was so much excitement in the air</p>
<p>during the third round.</p>
<p>And I remember being in the corner</p>
<p>and like, I was so excited at the end of it</p>
<p>that I had forgotten what happened in the other two rounds.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>And I looked to Sean, one of the other corner men,</p>
<p>and I think I said to him, did we win?</p>
<p>When you rewatch the fight,</p>
<p>clearly we didn&rsquo;t win the fight.</p>
<p>I mean, we lost the other rounds,</p>
<p>but I got so caught up in that moment</p>
<p>and I just remember like,</p>
<p>I was so in awe of his performance</p>
<p>that like I forgot what was going on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so hard to not be a fan at that moment</p>
<p>and to stay within yourself and try and like coach,</p>
<p>but then what the fuck you even coaching at that point?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re rumbling.</p>
<p>We got 30 seconds.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to win here.</p>
<p>And I remember like the performance itself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of moral victories,</p>
<p>but if ever there was gonna be one, that was one.</p>
<p>And when the fight was over and I grabbed Kyle,</p>
<p>like they hadn&rsquo;t even been to the center of the cage yet.</p>
<p>And I just hugged him and I said, you&rsquo;re my fucking hero.</p>
<p>And I remember being very emotional about that,</p>
<p>that I was able to be a part of that.</p>
<p>It feels wrong to say, but I was,</p>
<p>I kind of avoided saying it,</p>
<p>but I think if I&rsquo;m being honest with my feelings,</p>
<p>this is a safe space for feelings.</p>
<p>Is I think it was the greatest mixed martial arts fight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m being biased.</p>
<p>I was honestly thinking like, am I being biased?</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think that was the greatest fight.</p>
<p>Like if you wanna rank fights I&rsquo;ve ever seen,</p>
<p>I think to me that was the greatest fight I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It certainly was one of the greatest displays</p>
<p>of like just dogged effort from an underdog</p>
<p>who was out experienced and probably outsized.</p>
<p>But I mean, like you just,</p>
<p>Kyle&rsquo;s one of those kids,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna tell him he&rsquo;s out of a fight.</p>
<p>He has something you can&rsquo;t teach.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen tons of people with more physical attributes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just mental midgets</p>
<p>and they got a million dollar body and a 50 cent heart.</p>
<p>And Kyle is not that.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t teach it no matter what you do.</p>
<p>But that was, I would say like my career in combat sports,</p>
<p>which spans, if you wanna go all the way back</p>
<p>to like wrestling, like that was one of probably</p>
<p>the greatest experiences I&rsquo;ve been a part of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bittersweet sport.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a fickle mistress.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, the tragic aspect of that is</p>
<p>like, I guess Kyle lost, right?</p>
<p>So like if you look at the record</p>
<p>and all the kind of things,</p>
<p>perhaps like you look at the career,</p>
<p>maybe like as a financial,</p>
<p>from a financial perspective that perhaps is not</p>
<p>the greatest thing for Kyle&rsquo;s career</p>
<p>or that or in the history of the UFC,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s not like maybe many people</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even watch that fight,</p>
<p>but it was a special moment that stands in the history.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many of these in the history of fighting.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>when you look at someone&rsquo;s career in the UFC,</p>
<p>like financially, there&rsquo;s a handful of people</p>
<p>that make real money.</p>
<p>Everybody else makes nothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a handful of people that make real money.</p>
<p>So did that loss cost him in the near term?</p>
<p>Sure, but when you look back on your life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna look back on that loss</p>
<p>as something that derailed my life financially</p>
<p>and I never recovered from it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Like the sad thing is, is unless you were a champion</p>
<p>and most people are gonna be forgotten</p>
<p>right after they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Most people will be forgotten.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not forgotten,</p>
<p>certainly your accolades are gonna be misrepresented.</p>
<p>Either they&rsquo;re gonna be inflated or diminished</p>
<p>one way or the other.</p>
<p>So looking back on it, it&rsquo;s just so hard to quantify that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an experience.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re in that moment</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re one of the people intimately involved in it,</p>
<p>the value of that experience supersedes any financial gain.</p>
<p>Where would you put Khabib</p>
<p>in the discussion of the greatest of all time?</p>
<p>So you recently, we worked together,</p>
<p>we watched the fight of him and Justin Gaethje</p>
<p>and Khabib retired.</p>
<p>Would you put him up there as one of the greatest</p>
<p>or did he never truly find his foil,</p>
<p>like the great warrior that challenged him?</p>
<p>And maybe do you think he&rsquo;s fully retired now?</p>
<p>To answer the question about being fully retired,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any idea.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t for a second pretend to think that I understand</p>
<p>the way that people from that part of the world</p>
<p>think and respect their family and things like that.</p>
<p>To an American who says,</p>
<p>oh, I promised my mom I wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I mean, I promised my mom I wouldn&rsquo;t do a lot of things.</p>
<p>I went right out the fucking back door and did them.</p>
<p>But I think that that means something different</p>
<p>to people in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>So I have no idea what kind of weight that carries.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t answer that.</p>
<p>I can say a lot of times when people think</p>
<p>about great fighters,</p>
<p>they think about the aspects that make up MMA.</p>
<p>Like they think of MMA as a pie</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all these different pieces that make up the pie.</p>
<p>And how good is this piece?</p>
<p>When the fact of the matter is</p>
<p>is you only need one really, really, really good piece.</p>
<p>And the other pieces are complimentary pieces</p>
<p>to get you to where you&rsquo;re the strongest.</p>
<p>And if you want to tell me</p>
<p>that Khabib&rsquo;s not the greatest MMA fighter</p>
<p>because he doesn&rsquo;t have really slick striking,</p>
<p>you can make that argument.</p>
<p>But what I can tell you is Khabib has good enough striking</p>
<p>to get him to his grappling</p>
<p>where he is clearly the best guy at 155 they&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>So does that make him the greatest fighter</p>
<p>in that division or not?</p>
<p>To your point about the foil,</p>
<p>they wanted Connor to be his foil</p>
<p>and he just manhandled them.</p>
<p>I mean, they wanted that to happen.</p>
<p>Did not happen.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a kind of argument to be made which we kind of,</p>
<p>now you get haters in this argument</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to be one of the haters</p>
<p>because I know your, how should I put it?</p>
<p>Lack of admiration for Connor McGregor.</p>
<p>But, what is it?</p>
<p>Football is a game of inches?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense where that Connor,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an argument to be made</p>
<p>that Connor wasn&rsquo;t exactly dominated,</p>
<p>that he ended up being dominant,</p>
<p>meaning, let me phrase it differently,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a lot of points in the fight</p>
<p>that a different trajectory could have happened.</p>
<p>So he wasn&rsquo;t so far from having a chance</p>
<p>at winning that fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the end.</p>
<p>You can focus.</p>
<p>Those are the most important moments at the end.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lost the most important moments.</p>
<p>Right, but the road less taken.</p>
<p>It could have been,</p>
<p>if he didn&rsquo;t lose those very important moments,</p>
<p>he had a chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying out of all the people that Khabib fought,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s arguable that Connor was up there</p>
<p>of the people that had a chance.</p>
<p>Let me say this first.</p>
<p>I love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get so much heat for this.</p>
<p>I do love Khabib.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge Khabib fan</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a grappler first and foremost.</p>
<p>Me too, because I&rsquo;m also Russian.</p>
<p>I love Khabib, calm down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When Connor came on the scene,</p>
<p>I loved Connor because I&rsquo;m an Irish American</p>
<p>and I want to support him and things like that.</p>
<p>And he was good fun.</p>
<p>He got to be, for my personal taste,</p>
<p>he got to be too much.</p>
<p>Of all the people Khabib has fought,</p>
<p>I would never fight Connor again if I were him.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>And I said this about the Diaz fight.</p>
<p>Nate Diaz, who was one of my favorite fighters,</p>
<p>has fought the exact same fight for 12 years.</p>
<p>Connor will switch something up to give himself an edge.</p>
<p>And I believe that Connor would figure something out</p>
<p>in fight number two, I think,</p>
<p>but I also thought that Gagey would give Khabib problems</p>
<p>where it wouldn&rsquo;t be a matter of</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to out wrestle Khabib</p>
<p>or become better at defending his wrestling takedowns.</p>
<p>Connor would have figured out a way to not get wrestled.</p>
<p>I feel like he&rsquo;s constantly changing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s constantly evolving.</p>
<p>And whether or not people realize it or not,</p>
<p>I think Connor&rsquo;s one of the better overall athletes in MMA</p>
<p>just from looking at his body and his movement</p>
<p>and the way he&rsquo;s shaped.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a very tiny waist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got really pronounced glutes and shoulders.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s a for real athlete.</p>
<p>Whereas a lot of guys in MMA are not for real athletes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just good at one of the things that makes up MMA.</p>
<p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying about</p>
<p>if this happened, if that happened,</p>
<p>but I mean, you could say that</p>
<p>about every single combat sports event ever.</p>
<p>If Spinks&rsquo;s hook landed on Tyson,</p>
<p>maybe that fight didn&rsquo;t end the way that it did,</p>
<p>but you know what?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>But if we could talk about just Connor McGregor</p>
<p>for a second,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to get your fan mail or hate mail.</p>
<p>Speak to the innovation of Connor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hear very many people making this argument,</p>
<p>but is it possible to make an argument</p>
<p>that Connor McGregor is one of the greatest fighters</p>
<p>of all time?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting argument.</p>
<p>And the problem, the only problem with the argument</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s so much emotion on either side.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had a conversation, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>with Yaron Brook, who is a philosopher,</p>
<p>objectivist, which is the philosophy of Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>And the amount of emotion around that particular human</p>
<p>is fascinating to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to the amount of emotion around Donald Trump.</p>
<p>You can think of different personalities, maybe Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Those are the people that aren&rsquo;t willing</p>
<p>to have their mind changed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too emotionally attached to the argument.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s weird that why do we,</p>
<p>why some people inspire so much emotion and others don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>But Connor McGregor, I feel like nobody&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to have a calm fight analysis of the guy.</p>
<p>Look, to me, as just a fan of martial arts,</p>
<p>like I studied judo, I love watching just hours</p>
<p>of Olympic judo and appreciating the art form.</p>
<p>Like I forget the humans involved.</p>
<p>Teddy Renner, who&rsquo;s a heavyweight,</p>
<p>the most probably the most dominant heavyweight</p>
<p>in the history of judo, just studying his gripping,</p>
<p>just the art of it.</p>
<p>And who cares if there&rsquo;s shit talking?</p>
<p>Like to me, I put all of that aside</p>
<p>and just look at the art.</p>
<p>And like what I really appreciate about Connor McGregor</p>
<p>is his innovation, like of movement,</p>
<p>of maybe it&rsquo;s romanticized, maybe you can correct me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a Cheeto eating fan of mixed martial arts,</p>
<p>but like I seem to detect more innovation</p>
<p>than almost any other fighter</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve paid attention to in Connor McGregor.</p>
<p>I think first, I&rsquo;ll answer in two parts.</p>
<p>I think, well, I&rsquo;m not gonna answer the first part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a comment, because you didn&rsquo;t ask the question.</p>
<p>What was the question?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about how Connor McGregor fans are very emotional</p>
<p>and Connor McGregor detractors are very emotional.</p>
<p>I think fans become very emotional.</p>
<p>They become cheerleaders of someone like Connor McGregor</p>
<p>or Donald Trump, because they see that person</p>
<p>exhibiting the qualities that they themselves lack.</p>
<p>And so they become cheerleaders for that, right?</p>
<p>And I think that for the most part,</p>
<p>people who are detractors of Connor McGregors,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really Connor McGregor detractors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re detractors of Connor supporters.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beef that they have</p>
<p>with the people in that bucket, right?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not really a problem.</p>
<p>And that applies probably in our current political climate,</p>
<p>Donald Trump with the left and the right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about like, they actually don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>on the other, the caricature, the most extreme versions</p>
<p>of what they see in the supporters of the other side.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>But I think the more interesting thing</p>
<p>is the fighter himself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s put the supporters aside.</p>
<p>I would say that, you know, what some people know</p>
<p>and some people don&rsquo;t know is that Connor&rsquo;s base</p>
<p>is in karate and the karate style of Connor McGregor,</p>
<p>Steven Thompson, of Lyoto Machida,</p>
<p>that type of distance management,</p>
<p>a lot of times we think as martial artists,</p>
<p>we think that the sport version of the art</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve chosen to pursue somehow taints the authenticity</p>
<p>and the effectiveness of it.</p>
<p>But point karate is what led to that</p>
<p>in and out distance management style of Connor,</p>
<p>of Lyoto and of Steven Thompson.</p>
<p>They all kind of use it a little bit differently,</p>
<p>but they use it very effectively, all three of them.</p>
<p>And that comes from a world of trying to kind of like</p>
<p>step in, land contact on you from my point</p>
<p>and then get back out before you can counterstrike me, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where that comes from.</p>
<p>Connor is blessed to have a longer arms</p>
<p>than someone his height probably normally has.</p>
<p>And his movement is just so fluid.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so athletic with the hinges of his body,</p>
<p>the knees and the hips and the swivel of his body,</p>
<p>which is also the hips and the shoulders.</p>
<p>His movement, his distance,</p>
<p>and the way he sets people up for the straight left hand</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re circling away from it</p>
<p>and he can still land it,</p>
<p>which is what he did to Chad Mendes.</p>
<p>Hit him with a straight left</p>
<p>while he was circling away from it.</p>
<p>That is something that is very beautiful to watch.</p>
<p>And sometimes people see the kicks</p>
<p>and they see all the flashy snap kicks and the sidekicks.</p>
<p>All that stuff is doing is setting people up</p>
<p>for the left hand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re corralling people, you&rsquo;re funneling people,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re leading the dance and you&rsquo;re bringing them</p>
<p>to a spot where you know you can land that left hand.</p>
<p>And his ability to do that is masterful.</p>
<p>People constantly shit on his ability to grapple</p>
<p>because a couple of his losses</p>
<p>have been to jujitsu guys or grapplers,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve been to really good guys.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s gonna sit here and tell me</p>
<p>Conor McGregor&rsquo;s not a good grappler, go grapple him.</p>
<p>Let me see you grapple him.</p>
<p>To that point, I&rsquo;ll also say a lot of people</p>
<p>will use Conor McGregor&rsquo;s X guard sweep on Nate Diaz</p>
<p>as evidence to his high level grappling in that fight,</p>
<p>to which I would also counter,</p>
<p>Nate Diaz didn&rsquo;t fight that off</p>
<p>because he knew he was so much better at jujitsu</p>
<p>off the bottom that he didn&rsquo;t even care if he got swept.</p>
<p>So is Conor McGregor innovative?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is he one of the best fighters ever?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to say because he&rsquo;s such a cash cow</p>
<p>that he was fed people.</p>
<p>I firmly believe no one who put</p>
<p>that Conor McGregor Khabib fight together</p>
<p>thought Khabib would win.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I remember, so at that time it was not completely clear.</p>
<p>There was a myth of the great Khabib.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t completely clear how good is he really.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And it was unclear how good is Conor also.</p>
<p>Because I think to me,</p>
<p>maybe part of my admiration of Conor McGregor</p>
<p>is rooted in the fact that I thought</p>
<p>there was no way he beats Jose Aldo</p>
<p>and I thought there&rsquo;s definitely no way</p>
<p>he beats Eddie Alvarez.</p>
<p>And so like when he did,</p>
<p>I was like, my brain was like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something broken.</p>
<p>It was like shut down, like on windows, like froze.</p>
<p>We have to rethink this.</p>
<p>Like this is a special human.</p>
<p>Now people who argue he&rsquo;s not even in the running</p>
<p>of like top 20 is,</p>
<p>if you look at the number of defenses, for example,</p>
<p>of his belt that he had very, very little.</p>
<p>But like to me, I&rsquo;m one of those people</p>
<p>is back to our discussion of like,</p>
<p>do moments make great fighters?</p>
<p>That I think just being able to beat Jose Aldo</p>
<p>and I would argue in his prime,</p>
<p>some people might disagree in this,</p>
<p>in a way where he like figures out the puzzle,</p>
<p>gets in his head the entirety of the picture.</p>
<p>And then to be, I mean, Eddie Alvarez,</p>
<p>would he be considered a really strong wrestler?</p>
<p>Like, or not strong wrestler,</p>
<p>strong striker and wrestler,</p>
<p>the whole combination of it.</p>
<p>And also what&rsquo;s the other wrestler he fought?</p>
<p>Chad Mendes. Chad Mendes.</p>
<p>So let me comment on all those if I may.</p>
<p>So I was at the Chad Mendes fight live.</p>
<p>And there was a jujitsu tournament, we&rsquo;re out in Vegas.</p>
<p>And so me and my best friend came out</p>
<p>and we got some tickets.</p>
<p>That night was supposed to be the first Aldo fight.</p>
<p>Aldo got hurt, like right after I bought the tickets.</p>
<p>They pulled Chad Mendes in.</p>
<p>He was a little bit out of shape, whatever.</p>
<p>You still got to fight the fight.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want to use that fight as evidence</p>
<p>to Conor&rsquo;s greatness because they pulled Chad Mendes in.</p>
<p>He was like hunting and drinking beers in the woods</p>
<p>and was a little out of shape.</p>
<p>But if you want to talk about greatness,</p>
<p>like that surpasses your in ring accomplishments.</p>
<p>I was in the stands that night</p>
<p>and the people that came from Ireland</p>
<p>to see Conor fight that night,</p>
<p>single handedly set the market</p>
<p>for hotel room prices and airline tickets to Vegas</p>
<p>that weekend.</p>
<p>These motherfuckers were all dressed like Conor</p>
<p>in the stands.</p>
<p>They had wool suits on and big beards</p>
<p>and the whole thing.</p>
<p>I mean, they probably weren&rsquo;t pocket watches.</p>
<p>I never saw more people trying to be someone else.</p>
<p>Never saw more people try to be someone else.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a level of,</p>
<p>is there a level of greatness in that?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how to parse all that out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somebody who doesn&rsquo;t admire that.</p>
<p>I love that in the sense, the following sense, I think.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t seem to hold this belief at all,</p>
<p>but to me, fighting is not just,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t like a quiet street fight that nobody watches.</p>
<p>This is also a spectacle.</p>
<p>This is also a story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s a professional wrestling element</p>
<p>to this.</p>
<p>This is not, like you think it&rsquo;s just about fighting.</p>
<p>If it was just about fighting, you wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a story to it, I guess,</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m trying to get to.</p>
<p>And greatness has to incorporate that.</p>
<p>People that criticize, again, I might be wrong on this,</p>
<p>but I honestly think that Conor McGregor,</p>
<p>not nearly as much as Khabib,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a true martial artist.</p>
<p>I think he respects his opponents despite the talk.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m misreading it,</p>
<p>but it feels like he is a storyteller,</p>
<p>like Chael Sonnen type of like, he&rsquo;s constructed this image</p>
<p>to play the story, like just the way he acts</p>
<p>after the fight, the honor he shows to his opponents.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real martial artist in there,</p>
<p>and to dismiss the fact that the story of the fight</p>
<p>is part of it, because he doesn&rsquo;t just shit talk.</p>
<p>This is what people don&rsquo;t seem to understand.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s good at shit talking.</p>
<p>Very good, and I&rsquo;m with you on basically everything you said.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s greatness to that,</p>
<p>and I think that he understands how to sell a fight,</p>
<p>and I think what he did to Jose Aldo by getting in his head</p>
<p>helped him win that fight.</p>
<p>He insulted Jose Aldo and his country so much</p>
<p>that he knew Aldo was gonna come forward</p>
<p>right into that left hook.</p>
<p>Was that fight in Brazil, by the way?</p>
<p>Do you remember?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall.</p>
<p>Because I know he insulted all of Brazil,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure if it was in Brazil.</p>
<p>But when he tried to do that to Khabib,</p>
<p>you could tell that he just was not gonna get</p>
<p>in Khabib&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Khabib was unflappable.</p>
<p>But there is definitely something great</p>
<p>about how he moves people.</p>
<p>The Irish are like, I mean, Conor&rsquo;s walkout music,</p>
<p>for people from Ireland of Irish descent,</p>
<p>that shit is like very deep.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a very emotional song.</p>
<p>I was, to be honest, a little bit upset with Khabib,</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t rise.</p>
<p>I admire that entire culture.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an aspect to where he could have risen</p>
<p>to the occasion of there&rsquo;s the same kind of depth</p>
<p>of love of country that Russia has.</p>
<p>Is there in Dagestan?</p>
<p>Dagestan is a little weird in terms of like,</p>
<p>but he could have, especially with Putin&rsquo;s support,</p>
<p>wear for a bit the full Russian hat</p>
<p>of like this is the great nation.</p>
<p>Like rise above the culture of Dagestan,</p>
<p>which is a small town boy with the small town values</p>
<p>of family and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a moment where you inspire entire nations.</p>
<p>Like the step up and be the foil</p>
<p>to the great Conor McGregor where also Khabib</p>
<p>becomes the foil to, like both of them</p>
<p>are the foil to each other and become like,</p>
<p>that fight was already a great fight, right?</p>
<p>But it could have been something historic.</p>
<p>Ali versus Fred, I mean, it could have been really historic.</p>
<p>And I would argue, I guess the biggest disappointment I have,</p>
<p>and I understand it and I also honor it as a martial artist,</p>
<p>but to, I&rsquo;m disappointed that Khabib doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to even consider the possibility of doing in Moscow</p>
<p>fight number two, and because that could be narrative wise</p>
<p>if they do it right, that&rsquo;s one of the,</p>
<p>could be one of the greatest fights in history.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think in terms of Khabib and inspiring a country,</p>
<p>is it possible that by staying true to the values</p>
<p>that he had his entire career and getting to the zenith</p>
<p>of his art form and still doing it in that humble way,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it possible that that inspires?</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%, so I should clarify that I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just hearing from people,</p>
<p>from my fellow comrades, no, is they love that.</p>
<p>They love that, but they.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a brash, beer chugging, shit talking thing</p>
<p>that people really like about Connor, and I do love that.</p>
<p>But the beautiful narrative would have been the clash,</p>
<p>the real clash of those cultures.</p>
<p>So Khabib chooses to live the culture by walking away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also like a clash of them sort of walking,</p>
<p>not walking away from the fire, but walking into the fire</p>
<p>of this brashness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sort of the cool collected calmness</p>
<p>of the Dagestan people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you were talking about the Saitya brothers.</p>
<p>So they just view it totally differently.</p>
<p>And there are stereotypes about the Irish</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re maybe potentially a louder,</p>
<p>more boisterous culture.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t heard of that, yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, I thought they each played their part perfectly.</p>
<p>And all those things that you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>could have happened.</p>
<p>Maybe Khabib steps up and he carries the proverbial flag,</p>
<p>so to speak, for a nation of people and they go to battle.</p>
<p>But the fight, if it plays out the same way,</p>
<p>is still the fight.</p>
<p>And it was an okay fight.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a great fight.</p>
<p>It was, you know, the fight was okay.</p>
<p>And I think that, again, I don&rsquo;t have any idea</p>
<p>what Khabib&rsquo;s obligations to his family are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think either of those guys want for more money.</p>
<p>To do another fight is just a legacy thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just about fulfilling some part of a legacy.</p>
<p>And I just, I admire the possibility of a great legacy</p>
<p>that is bigger than either of the fighters.</p>
<p>I think with Khabib, he kind of, he&rsquo;s not as concerned</p>
<p>about legacy, I think.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Your promoter&rsquo;s dream, because you want the rematch,</p>
<p>and the only thing that makes more money</p>
<p>than the rematch is the trilogy.</p>
<p>You gotta split the rematch, you hope Conor wins,</p>
<p>and then you have the trilogy fight.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re all in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t get into Khabib&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>but I know Putin, just the game, the entirety of it,</p>
<p>especially at the time,</p>
<p>especially if it was Trump as president,</p>
<p>if he was as president at the time,</p>
<p>and Putin, and in Russia,</p>
<p>and just knowing how masterful Conor is at,</p>
<p>because Conor would be a different Conor.</p>
<p>I think he would be a calmer Conor.</p>
<p>There would be a different,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t wanna be over the top Conor</p>
<p>with the Russian people.</p>
<p>Right, no, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, ah, this is dangerous ground.</p>
<p>See, that was the episode in the hotel in Brooklyn</p>
<p>when some of the Russian guys confronted Artem,</p>
<p>and then Conor came over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, but the danger of that.</p>
<p>I mean, there is the element of just like real danger,</p>
<p>and the real, it was almost of war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It was like when Chael Sonnen was talking so much smack,</p>
<p>maybe it was against Vanderlei Silva.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, and it was one of those fights</p>
<p>where they just didn&rsquo;t think he was gonna make it</p>
<p>out of Brazil.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Americans don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>People take some of that shit in different parts</p>
<p>of the world very, very seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s what makes it beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes a great story,</p>
<p>and I think fighting is very much about the stories,</p>
<p>not just about the particular outcomes of a fight,</p>
<p>or the skillset matching, or the chess of the fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about the story of the greater,</p>
<p>like context of societies, of warring.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like warring cultures, but we&rsquo;re still,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still good, we&rsquo;re no longer can have great,</p>
<p>big, hot wars between nations because of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>This is our wars that we can have,</p>
<p>and in some sense, I feel robbed of the great war</p>
<p>that could have happened.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean there aren&rsquo;t lots of wars going on,</p>
<p>but yeah, the big one is not gonna happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much of a balance of power</p>
<p>with nuclear weapons and technology and stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the end of war.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s always gonna be war?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;ll always be war,</p>
<p>especially in underdeveloped parts of the world.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there always underdeveloped,</p>
<p>relatively, parts of the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, at some point, though, you&rsquo;d think,</p>
<p>I mean, the way that technology&rsquo;s expanding</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re bringing technology to weird parts of the world</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t think of as technologically advanced,</p>
<p>the way that the Chinese are inhabiting certain areas</p>
<p>for mining purposes and things like that,</p>
<p>I think underdeveloped parts of the world</p>
<p>will get developed quickly.</p>
<p>I just wonder what the nature of that war might be.</p>
<p>It could be cyber, it could be all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I think in developed nations, it&rsquo;s gonna be cyber.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably the next phase of war,</p>
<p>but I mean, I think you talk about parts of the world</p>
<p>like the Middle East,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just still gonna be warring tribal factions.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even begin to understand</p>
<p>what those people are fighting about over there.</p>
<p>Yet, everyone sitting in America on their couch</p>
<p>has an opinion.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t even begin to understand it.</p>
<p>I sure can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s back to the principle discussion,</p>
<p>when what&rsquo;s violated is much deeper</p>
<p>than just kind of anything we can even,</p>
<p>in a middle class existence, can even comprehend.</p>
<p>A lot of times, American soldiers will go to war</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re told to do,</p>
<p>and maybe they disagree with the orders,</p>
<p>and maybe they agree with the orders,</p>
<p>but I get a sense that people in the Middle East fighting</p>
<p>all believe in what they&rsquo;re fighting for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a thing where they&rsquo;re told to go do it.</p>
<p>I believe they really believe</p>
<p>that what they&rsquo;re doing is the right thing,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re defending some sort of principle.</p>
<p>Are you generally optimistic about the future,</p>
<p>speaking of war, of human civilization?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll, people talk about the Fermi Paradox</p>
<p>and asking why haven&rsquo;t aliens visited us,</p>
<p>if you believe they haven&rsquo;t visited us.</p>
<p>One of the thoughts is that there&rsquo;s kind of a great filter</p>
<p>that intelligent civilization reach a point</p>
<p>where it destroys itself naturally,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why we haven&rsquo;t seen them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t last very long.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a kind of,</p>
<p>we seem to be advancing faster and faster and faster.</p>
<p>We keep developing more and more powerful ways</p>
<p>of destroying ourselves in all kinds of ways,</p>
<p>not even, just even to say nuclear weapons alone,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s all kinds of new ways,</p>
<p>engineer pandemics, nanotechnology, AGI,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It seems to be that the argument that we are going</p>
<p>to destroy ourselves in some kind of creative way</p>
<p>very shortly is not too crazy of an argument to make.</p>
<p>Are you more optimistic or pessimistic</p>
<p>about the prospects of human civilization</p>
<p>in maybe the 22nd century?</p>
<p>Like, is it possible that your generation</p>
<p>is the last generation to be alive on Earth?</p>
<p>No, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say that five generations</p>
<p>from now that could be true.</p>
<p>I guess I think of it really selfishly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer that when your time here on Earth is over,</p>
<p>the overwhelmingly vast majority of people</p>
<p>will be forgotten within 12 calendar months.</p>
<p>People with no family will be forgotten sooner,</p>
<p>and so I don&rsquo;t give a lot of thought</p>
<p>to what will happen to Earth or mankind when I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
<p>I give more thought to maximizing my time here now,</p>
<p>and I wanna do it in a way where I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not overtly hindering the future of civilization</p>
<p>or humankind, but I&rsquo;m definitely taking a me first approach</p>
<p>to how I live on Earth.</p>
<p>Do you have a philosophy behind why you have</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t have kids on this topic?</p>
<p>Because for many people, when they have kids,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense, it&rsquo;s almost like a genetic sense</p>
<p>or something like that, where all of a sudden,</p>
<p>you do start caring about what happens</p>
<p>five generations from now.</p>
<p>I mean, I think I&rsquo;m just too selfish.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s the easy answer.</p>
<p>Like, I know that your whole life has to change.</p>
<p>You know, your focus, everything shifts,</p>
<p>and just don&rsquo;t wanna do that.</p>
<p>And also, I think that there&rsquo;s a level of,</p>
<p>I guess if I have to really unpack it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably a level of lack of hope in the future.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t think the world</p>
<p>and humanity is going in the right direction.</p>
<p>What does the right direction look like?</p>
<p>I think the right direction looks like people</p>
<p>coming back together in a more impactful human way,</p>
<p>in person, touching, feeling, talking face to face.</p>
<p>So all the things you&rsquo;re describing is what we had,</p>
<p>as you mentioned before, when you were like a teenager.</p>
<p>So the state of the world.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because your mind was formed then.</p>
<p>It very well could be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that the virtual reality worlds</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll create will be actually</p>
<p>a much higher level of existence.</p>
<p>In fact, like now we&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re moving slowly away from tribalism,</p>
<p>perhaps you could argue the ideas of nations,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going, we&rsquo;re moving into the realm of ideas</p>
<p>and it could be a higher form of existence</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re sort of moving past the constraints</p>
<p>of our meat vehicles into the space of our minds.</p>
<p>It depends what you value.</p>
<p>Cause when you sit here and you talk about it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re talking about these things</p>
<p>in these humongous levels, on these macro levels.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people view it that way.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people view it as like,</p>
<p>what kind of pizza am I getting tonight?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a much different outlook.</p>
<p>And sure, the virtual world that&rsquo;s on the horizon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s got benefits and will help people,</p>
<p>but is it gonna help the things that you find valuable?</p>
<p>Like, was it gonna help commerce?</p>
<p>Okay, sure.</p>
<p>Is that the thing you find the most valuable?</p>
<p>Is it gonna help communication?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;ll help disseminating information.</p>
<p>Is it gonna help explain the information</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re disseminating?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Is it gonna hinder interpersonal communication?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And those are things I find valuable.</p>
<p>Interpersonal communication, talking to people.</p>
<p>Like it saddens me when I go into a restaurant</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s five year old kids who like,</p>
<p>slamming away on an iPad and can&rsquo;t make eye contact</p>
<p>with anybody or teenagers who don&rsquo;t say please and thank you</p>
<p>when they order from the waitress.</p>
<p>Like that to me is wrong.</p>
<p>That shit&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know this for a fact,</p>
<p>but I do attribute that to using technology as a crutch</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re raising raising kids.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think those are things that I find valuable.</p>
<p>I tried to empathize.</p>
<p>I mean, I agree with you as a person who grew up</p>
<p>in a certain age, but like prior to the internet, I suppose.</p>
<p>But, or at least solidified the early philosophies</p>
<p>of the way I see the world prior to the internet.</p>
<p>During the time of AOL, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>Brr.</p>
<p>Uh, what was your AIMS screen name?</p>
<p>I never had one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I was the last person I knew to get a cell phone.</p>
<p>I was so anti all that stuff because I just felt like</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to be a part of it.</p>
<p>I did not want to be a part of it.</p>
<p>I joined the underground forum about MMA in 2000 or 2001</p>
<p>when I first started training.</p>
<p>I think right at the tail end, I got a MySpace,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t have any of that stuff</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t want any of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>It just was, I was not into it.</p>
<p>I felt like, like what are the good things</p>
<p>that are going to come out of it?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m going to get my package in two days</p>
<p>instead of four days?</p>
<p>Does that make my life better?</p>
<p>I try to, I try to deeply empathize</p>
<p>with a lot of experiences of other people.</p>
<p>And like one of the things I love,</p>
<p>like the smell of paper books and books in general.</p>
<p>And early on, this is like five years ago,</p>
<p>I just gave away all my books.</p>
<p>And I said, you know, I&rsquo;m really going to try to</p>
<p>fall in love with the books in the same way I did before,</p>
<p>but now with a Kindle or not a Kindle,</p>
<p>like paper, white, whatever, the ebook reader.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still not there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been kind of trying to fall in love</p>
<p>with that experience.</p>
<p>And the same way I try to think like,</p>
<p>teenagers are really into TikTok now,</p>
<p>like making these short videos.</p>
<p>I try to consider the possibility that their existence</p>
<p>will be a much happier one than I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>because of this kind of interaction.</p>
<p>From my sort of skeptical perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the attention span is so short,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really deeply think or deeply experience things.</p>
<p>They construct a social layer that they present to the world</p>
<p>and they work on creating this social layer,</p>
<p>like the presentation to the world much more</p>
<p>than really sitting alone with their thoughts</p>
<p>and the sadnesses and their hopes and dreams and fears.</p>
<p>And like working on the project that is their own,</p>
<p>like actual person that exists in this physical world,</p>
<p>as opposed to working on the project</p>
<p>of a particular social platform that they show.</p>
<p>But like, perhaps that project,</p>
<p>like who cares who you are in the physical space?</p>
<p>Maybe what you are is what your Instagram shows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the more important project to work on.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s reality?</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s reality?</p>
<p>Perception is reality, right?</p>
<p>So how other people perceive this constructed thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s their reality of you.</p>
<p>But is it your reality?</p>
<p>Like that, I mean, like we said earlier,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how you want people to see you</p>
<p>is very rarely in line with how you really are</p>
<p>or how you see yourself.</p>
<p>And I mean, I can remember being like a 13 year old kid</p>
<p>and like when you go through a bunch of weird</p>
<p>13 year old kid shit, like sitting in my room,</p>
<p>like turning a red light on</p>
<p>and listening to like a sad record</p>
<p>and like trying to figure out what&rsquo;s going on inside.</p>
<p>Sometimes you like it, sometimes you don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>But I feel like those experiences are lost</p>
<p>on kids constantly connected to a phone.</p>
<p>And like, you know, I don&rsquo;t know what the remedy</p>
<p>for those situations is nowadays.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, do they make a TikTok video?</p>
<p>Do they blog about it?</p>
<p>Do they, you know, make a video or a&hellip;</p>
<p>Nobody blogs anymore, bro.</p>
<p>Whatever, man.</p>
<p>Or a video, a story about,</p>
<p>oh, this is what happened to me</p>
<p>and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Does that actually help them work it out?</p>
<p>Or does it just create more noise and more static</p>
<p>on how to get to the root of the problem</p>
<p>and learn about themselves?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what future social networks are exactly.</p>
<p>I do know on a shallow level,</p>
<p>it does feel good when somebody clicks like on something.</p>
<p>I think that is more of a drug</p>
<p>than an actual deep long lasting fulfilling happiness.</p>
<p>But perhaps there&rsquo;s a way to make a social network</p>
<p>that does lead to long lasting happiness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s somehow detached from the physical meat space.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it feels like</p>
<p>you want to give that a chance.</p>
<p>Do you think when people are liking things on social media,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s just a group of people,</p>
<p>an overwhelming majority of people</p>
<p>that are gonna like whatever you put out there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re clicking like,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s another section of people</p>
<p>that just constantly scroll and like,</p>
<p>scroll and like, and scroll and like.</p>
<p>Like, do you think when you get a like</p>
<p>on content you put out,</p>
<p>that that like perhaps came from someone</p>
<p>who normally doesn&rsquo;t like your content,</p>
<p>but like you&rsquo;ve just changed their mind on something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve turned them around on it.</p>
<p>I tend to think that when I get likes on social media,</p>
<p>those are just the people that like all my shit</p>
<p>no matter what I say.</p>
<p>Like they probably don&rsquo;t even read it.</p>
<p>Like I could put the most preposterous thing up there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still gonna get a handful</p>
<p>of the same exact likes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But I tend to, the way I see likes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of, you said multiple things.</p>
<p>I think in one sense you see social media</p>
<p>as like a battleground of ideas</p>
<p>and like is a kind of indicated,</p>
<p>like the best possible like is an indicator</p>
<p>of like, of you winning over somebody on an idea</p>
<p>and they really appreciate that idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best possible like.</p>
<p>To me, a like is just two strangers smiling at each other.</p>
<p>Like a moment of like, like.</p>
<p>I got you, bro.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got you, bro.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, like fist bump.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, we&rsquo;re in this fucking thing together.</p>
<p>This whole thing doesn&rsquo;t make any sense,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s possible for likes to be that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the actual clicking of a like,</p>
<p>I think social media at its best might be that</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, I got you, bro.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a large scale as opposed to kind of</p>
<p>this weird, like crazy pool of dopamine</p>
<p>where everyone&rsquo;s just obsessed with this likes and likes</p>
<p>and then the division drives like more</p>
<p>of this like weird, anxious engagement.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just the dark version of it</p>
<p>in the early days of social media.</p>
<p>I think you called it a battleground of ideas,</p>
<p>but I think social media is nothing but a battleground</p>
<p>of fragile egos.</p>
<p>Well, but humans are fragile egos.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe, but I think the people,</p>
<p>I think particularly on social media,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the most fragile.</p>
<p>Like, would you be doing all the things you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>What would you be doing if you weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if you weren&rsquo;t podcasting and posting the things you do</p>
<p>on social media, what would you be doing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably be much the same guy, right?</p>
<p>But I think that on social media,</p>
<p>the fragile ego people, what you see on social media</p>
<p>is not what they&rsquo;d be doing without social media.</p>
<p>Does that make any sense?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re probably,</p>
<p>your mission is probably somewhat congruent, your path.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just utilizing social media.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of people,</p>
<p>social media has changed their path</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re doing something totally foreign to them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re only able to do it maybe</p>
<p>because of social media.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re focusing on a particular moment in time</p>
<p>of people in their less great moments,</p>
<p>like in their less great version of themselves.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re just focusing on the masses struggling</p>
<p>to become the best version of themselves.</p>
<p>And then you, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>For stretches of time, whether it&rsquo;s days, weeks, and months,</p>
<p>you could be a shady person on the internet.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re focusing on that.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, social media platforms emphasize</p>
<p>they love it when you&rsquo;re like that,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not doing great in your own life</p>
<p>because it increases anxiety, increases engagement,</p>
<p>makes you more susceptible to an argument,</p>
<p>and then really get pulled into like conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But the other side works too.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s also the people who are on social media</p>
<p>fronting like they&rsquo;re these positive figures</p>
<p>and going to the gym, whatever it is,</p>
<p>the positivity that they spew out.</p>
<p>But in real life, they&rsquo;re the most negative fucks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever met in your life.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just so full of crap.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just people playing to an audience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you said, it&rsquo;s like a politician sometimes.</p>
<p>A politician wakes up one day and they decide,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the group I can pander to the best</p>
<p>to get the most likes equals votes?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same thing on social media.</p>
<p>People wake up and whether it&rsquo;s conscious or not,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the group I can pander to the best</p>
<p>to get the most likes?</p>
<p>Is it the positivity motivated crowd?</p>
<p>Is it the woe is me crowd?</p>
<p>Like what is it?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s gonna give me the most likes?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to argue against that.</p>
<p>I guess it rings true what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>but I just kind of refuse to believe it.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m pandering to the optimistic crowd.</p>
<p>Like I met with my marketing team</p>
<p>and I just feel that love has the best,</p>
<p>what do you call it?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that accuse me</p>
<p>of being like exactly that,</p>
<p>which is like, why are you always being positive?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, cause I&rsquo;d like to be that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wouldn&rsquo;t consider you someone who panders.</p>
<p>No, but I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to say that everyone is pandering,</p>
<p>but like maybe they&rsquo;re just trying.</p>
<p>I do believe that social media platforms</p>
<p>could encourage people when they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to be the best version of themselves, whatever that is.</p>
<p>It could be like Conor McGregor talking shit.</p>
<p>It could be just being positive.</p>
<p>It could be actually creating cool things in this world,</p>
<p>putting out instructional videos for Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>or like inspiring students to competition.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>All those kinds of things, educational content.</p>
<p>I think that people are trying.</p>
<p>Like I tend to believe that people want to be good.</p>
<p>Like they want to be successful</p>
<p>in whatever that definition of success is.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re kind of struggling to do that.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just awkward at it at first.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s easy to focus on the awkwardness</p>
<p>and the stumbling around as people have that.</p>
<p>And they start shitting on each other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to kind of focus in on that.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s just like people, you know, white belts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more white belts in the world</p>
<p>than there are black belts.</p>
<p>But you gotta give them a chance to kind of grow.</p>
<p>I think on social media, if you put your stuff out there,</p>
<p>whatever your stuff is, your content, your views</p>
<p>or whatever, you let the chips fall where they may.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a different thing than being like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tweak what I normally might say</p>
<p>and put it up this way</p>
<p>because I want these people to like it.</p>
<p>And in terms, I also think I have a different viewpoint</p>
<p>than you do on people wanting to be successful.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think that many people</p>
<p>want to be successful.</p>
<p>I think people want to have the appearance</p>
<p>of wanting to be successful.</p>
<p>But to be successful takes a shitload of work.</p>
<p>And most people don&rsquo;t want to put that work in.</p>
<p>So they craft this persona of a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying really hard, but just can&rsquo;t catch the break</p>
<p>or, you know, these motherfuckers</p>
<p>with getting back on my grind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never been on a grind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been on the couch.</p>
<p>I so disagree with you.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your foil.</p>
<p>You enjoyed that guy on the couch with the cheetah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your motivation.</p>
<p>But just own it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be like back on the ground, back on the couch.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re like David Goggins,</p>
<p>who was like talking shit to the one guy</p>
<p>with the eating Cheetos.</p>
<p>And so doing inspires millions</p>
<p>to actually pursue their success.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>But I just think that most people</p>
<p>really do want to be successful</p>
<p>and are trying to work hard and they keep failing.</p>
<p>So, I mean.</p>
<p>But why is it continue?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt you.</p>
<p>But like, let&rsquo;s take a person who&rsquo;s overweight.</p>
<p>Do you not think that person wants to be skinny?</p>
<p>Of course they want to be skinny.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t want it enough</p>
<p>to put the pizza or the pie down and go to the gym.</p>
<p>They want it, but they want it to be easy.</p>
<p>Of course they want to be skinny.</p>
<p>Well, everyone wants it to be easy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And of course people want to be successful,</p>
<p>but do they want it enough to do the work?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they do.</p>
<p>I think the easy thing to do is to create</p>
<p>an outward facing persona of the person who really wants it.</p>
<p>And you get the same reward from a lot of people</p>
<p>as the person who actually is successful.</p>
<p>Very few people differentiate</p>
<p>from the person who&rsquo;s found success</p>
<p>and the person who&rsquo;s showing you</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re trying to get success on social media.</p>
<p>People see that as the same.</p>
<p>I see you&rsquo;re going after the marketing dollar</p>
<p>that represents the people that want to work hard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>You started a podcast recently.</p>
<p>Hell yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called, which people probably from this conversation</p>
<p>can, I guess we didn&rsquo;t really talk about politics much</p>
<p>or the fact that you&rsquo;re a business owner</p>
<p>or the fact that you&rsquo;re a red blooded American</p>
<p>and love this country, America.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really talk about that,</p>
<p>but from the name of the podcast,</p>
<p>they can probably infer it.</p>
<p>And the name is Please Allow Me.</p>
<p>Good name.</p>
<p>What have you learned from doing this podcast?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your hope of doing this podcast?</p>
<p>People should definitely listen to it.</p>
<p>You have a few episodes out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re damn good at it, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll evolve and change.</p>
<p>So this is like the early days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to see where it goes,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your thinking around it</p>
<p>as an intellectual putting your thoughts out into the world?</p>
<p>I think that one of the things that COVID did</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re all kind of in lockdown was as a business owner,</p>
<p>made me take stock of what&rsquo;s the future</p>
<p>of brick and mortar businesses.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always been reluctant</p>
<p>to be an online presence in any way,</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s not my thing,</p>
<p>because I believe that I&rsquo;m a force of nature</p>
<p>and people need to experience me, right?</p>
<p>And the few characters that Twitter has are phasing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>The force of nature, there&rsquo;s John Clark.</p>
<p>I want you to feel physically uncomfortable around me.</p>
<p>This has been three hours</p>
<p>of me being physically uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared for my life.</p>
<p>And so I thought that that would be one of the ways</p>
<p>in which I could increase.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that with the lockdown</p>
<p>and potential future lockdowns,</p>
<p>in order to pay my mortgage and my bar tab</p>
<p>and my Grubhub&rsquo;s out of control,</p>
<p>that I would need to find ancillary ways to&hellip;</p>
<p>Door dash slash Lex.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to use Grubhub, Grubhub sucks.</p>
<p>Door dash.</p>
<p>They actually do.</p>
<p>Door dash.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>You can go back to your local fooder.</p>
<p>711.</p>
<p>Yeah, and get the food.</p>
<p>You can order 711 from Door Dash.</p>
<p>Or from Postmates.</p>
<p>Code Lex.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m sorry, go.</p>
<p>But anyway, I thought it was like,</p>
<p>oh, I should probably increase a little bit</p>
<p>my online presence and what would be a way to do that</p>
<p>that would be fun for me and entertaining.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, a lot of people, yourself included,</p>
<p>that I know have done some podcasts</p>
<p>and I find that inspiring and I&rsquo;m fortunate enough</p>
<p>to know a bunch of cool motherfuckers</p>
<p>that I can talk to about a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;re starting to drop in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an aspect to which podcasting</p>
<p>does capture the force of nature better.</p>
<p>In the digital form, podcasting captures</p>
<p>the force of nature of a human being</p>
<p>better than other mediums, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely, there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>I just felt like, you know when it&rsquo;s midnight</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in the bar and you get the sense</p>
<p>that the bar&rsquo;s gonna close in 90 minutes</p>
<p>and you think, you know, not enough people have seen me yet</p>
<p>and maybe we should go to another bar</p>
<p>so more people can see me.</p>
<p>I feel like podcasting is like that for me.</p>
<p>Not enough people have heard my thoughts</p>
<p>and I feel like, my mom raised me to be a giver.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t want me to be selfish.</p>
<p>And I have these thoughts that I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a waste if you didn&rsquo;t give it to the world.</p>
<p>People seem to really enjoy them.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I enjoy them.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve probably been on my best behavior today</p>
<p>on this episode of the podcast.</p>
<p>So if you want the uncensored, unfiltered,</p>
<p>the full spectrum of the force of nature,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s John Clark, you go to the podcast.</p>
<p>Funny enough, I think you&rsquo;re drinking</p>
<p>throughout most of the podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Tequila, so they only last like an hour</p>
<p>because you seem to like, I&rsquo;m guessing</p>
<p>that you just lose it one hour.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like Cinderella turns into a frog or whatever.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;m learning is</p>
<p>sometimes you have great conversations when you&rsquo;re drunk</p>
<p>and sometimes you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like I went into it with the write drunk,</p>
<p>edit sober mentality.</p>
<p>Yes, Hemingway.</p>
<p>Hemingway, yes.</p>
<p>But turns out that sometimes you don&rsquo;t have that much</p>
<p>to edit when you&rsquo;re super shit faced.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been scaling that back a little bit.</p>
<p>What do you mean exactly by that?</p>
<p>Like, where does it go wrong when you&rsquo;re drunk?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about that, because.</p>
<p>It gets, especially when you have a personal relationship</p>
<p>with the person that you&rsquo;re talking to,</p>
<p>rather than trying to put some ideas on display</p>
<p>for other people to hear and maybe talk about,</p>
<p>you wind up just having like a conversation</p>
<p>with your bro about inside jokes and things like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not that interesting.</p>
<p>No one wants to like watch, you know,</p>
<p>go to a bar and watch two people at the,</p>
<p>sitting there getting drunk and talking to each other</p>
<p>is different than listening to like strong discourse.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>One interesting thing as a fan of Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan, I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Joe Rogan for a long time</p>
<p>and he has his friends over a lot, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a aspect to those three, four,</p>
<p>five hour conversations that I really enjoy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a magic to those.</p>
<p>I think he taught the world that those kinds</p>
<p>of long form conversations can work.</p>
<p>The, what you forget is Joe Rogan is a comedian.</p>
<p>His friends are also celebrities.</p>
<p>Like they know what it&rsquo;s like to be on the mic.</p>
<p>They know there is a challenge</p>
<p>to actually having your friends on a microphone.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ve never,</p>
<p>this is the first time they&rsquo;ve been on a microphone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually what you&rsquo;ve been doing,</p>
<p>which is a very interesting experiment.</p>
<p>And you find that some are more awkward than others.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re trying to find like,</p>
<p>what do I do with this kind of thing?</p>
<p>Why do you not talk to strangers?</p>
<p>Why did you go with people that you&rsquo;re actually know?</p>
<p>So the simple answer is the people</p>
<p>that I selected are both interesting</p>
<p>and I thought would be good at talking.</p>
<p>But then I noticed the thing you just mentioned.</p>
<p>My buddy Paul did the first one and Paul&rsquo;s a wild man.</p>
<p>And if you went out with Paul,</p>
<p>he can talk about a bazillion topics</p>
<p>to a certain, to a significant level of depth, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got a good understanding</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a unique perspective on a lot of things.</p>
<p>And I think he was the first guy invited on my podcast</p>
<p>and it was almost like he was on a little bit</p>
<p>less than natural about it.</p>
<p>And then by the time he loosened up with some drinks,</p>
<p>he was, it just, we were all shitfaced.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a face shift though.</p>
<p>Totally, totally.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s gonna come back on</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll be more comfortable with it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll probably be awesome</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a great person to talk to.</p>
<p>I had my friend Dave on who&rsquo;s a restaurateur</p>
<p>and a musician, that one will be released pretty soon.</p>
<p>But yesterday I had a guy on</p>
<p>who you might really enjoy listening to</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a friend of mine, his name&rsquo;s Mark Clem.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an endurance athlete and he&rsquo;s been compared,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been called the white Dave Goggins.</p>
<p>And he talks about like those comparisons</p>
<p>and what he hates about it and the various events and stuff.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just a guy who&rsquo;s just always kind of like natural</p>
<p>and like, I knew he&rsquo;d be great to get on the podcast.</p>
<p>And so I started with friends who I thought could handle it</p>
<p>and who also are just really interesting people.</p>
<p>And I did it so that I could also establish</p>
<p>a level of comfort because it was a new thing for me.</p>
<p>And I knew that they wouldn&rsquo;t really give a shit</p>
<p>what I was doing and be like, hey, this is cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going over to JC&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna drink some tequila and talk shit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just gonna be a microphone there this time.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s amazing what you&rsquo;re doing, the freedom of it.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not currently doing any advertisements</p>
<p>or any of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just exploring your voice.</p>
<p>This is one of the mediums that you&rsquo;re just trying it out.</p>
<p>My 11 subscribers know what I&rsquo;m about.</p>
<p>Your 11 subscribers, it&rsquo;s in the double digits.</p>
<p>For both you and I, do you have advice for me</p>
<p>as a podcaster and for yourself as a podcast?</p>
<p>Like if you were to think like you&rsquo;re gonna do say,</p>
<p>I mean, who knows, but say you do a thousand more episodes.</p>
<p>Like imagine a world where your life continues</p>
<p>in that direction, that this is like a little parallel.</p>
<p>Like for me, this thing is like a little side hobby,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also one that&rsquo;s deeply fulfilling.</p>
<p>So not just from a business perspective,</p>
<p>which is not the way I think about it.</p>
<p>I just think from a life human perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have this kind of conversation</p>
<p>with you off mic, like this long, this deep, this attentive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really fulfilling</p>
<p>about these conversations.</p>
<p>So what advice would you have for me?</p>
<p>What advice do you have for yourself?</p>
<p>Oh, have you not introspected this that deeply?</p>
<p>Oh, I have advice.</p>
<p>I think the first advice I would give to you</p>
<p>is I think you should have me on more often.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s first and foremost.</p>
<p>And second is go on your podcast and have a conversation.</p>
<p>Well, I would say you come on my podcast when you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When you feel like the product that I&rsquo;m putting out</p>
<p>would benefit from your presence and vice versa,</p>
<p>not as a favor to a bro, but at the right time.</p>
<p>I do sense, actually, it&rsquo;s an interesting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dance to it, which is like Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>I recently did, like Joe Rogan had a conversation with me</p>
<p>on this podcast.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very specific kind of thing</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re helping each other out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the timing on that has to be right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, like if that makes any sense,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like supporting each other.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make a difference, you would think.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s just people talking,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what microphones,</p>
<p>but it changes things.</p>
<p>It does, and there&rsquo;s an order to the guests</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve had on.</p>
<p>And the next guest that I&rsquo;ll have on</p>
<p>will be a friend we have in common,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be talking about teaching</p>
<p>and how to teach different styles of teaching</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re teaching and all these other things.</p>
<p>Your mind&rsquo;s saying who?</p>
<p>Oh, Sean Fisher.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s an order to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not scientific, but it&rsquo;s based on my gut.</p>
<p>Is it astrologically based?</p>
<p>What do you mean it&rsquo;s not scientific?</p>
<p>Your gut, so you have a sense,</p>
<p>like Joe Rogan, for example, tries to do left, right.</p>
<p>He tries to alternate like this gut feeling</p>
<p>of like these bins of people,</p>
<p>and he tries to alternate worldviews.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Like he kind of, so that he doesn&rsquo;t feel like it,</p>
<p>like it constantly shakes him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about him,</p>
<p>like constantly pulls him in multiple directions</p>
<p>about like how he sees the world,</p>
<p>and that keeps him balanced.</p>
<p>That keeps the conversation kind of exciting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I did it in a way where I knew Paul was gonna be wild</p>
<p>and we might get a little out of control</p>
<p>and like have some technical hiccups along the way.</p>
<p>And then my friend Jake,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a CEO of a pharmaceutical company,</p>
<p>that was very timely because he was able</p>
<p>to speak to vaccines.</p>
<p>And that was kind of scientific flavored.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And what I learned listening back on that</p>
<p>is like I learned for myself about,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t asking the next level questions</p>
<p>to really draw out great answers.</p>
<p>And part of it is you&rsquo;re simultaneously hanging out</p>
<p>with a bro, but also I was trying to learn something</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t learn what I wanted to learn.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my fault because I didn&rsquo;t ask the questions.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an expert in that field.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m an absolute dipshit</p>
<p>when it comes to that stuff.</p>
<p>And so I didn&rsquo;t do a good job.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t know it,</p>
<p>that means the thing I was trying to tease out of him,</p>
<p>no one who was gonna listen is gonna learn that either.</p>
<p>So I learned that.</p>
<p>Then I had the one with soap on,</p>
<p>which I thought was pretty good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a wrestler, he&rsquo;s also a farmer.</p>
<p>Right, and a social worker.</p>
<p>And kind of humble and thoughtful.</p>
<p>Yeah, thoughtful.</p>
<p>Thoughtful guy.</p>
<p>Like slower, he&rsquo;s not a wild man, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Not a wild man in the sense that I&rsquo;m wild,</p>
<p>but he does preach this philosophy of being more wild.</p>
<p>Like being in touch with nature.</p>
<p>Nature, that kind of wild.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>And then my buddy Dave, he came on because I love music.</p>
<p>And I wanted to talk a lot about music.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s one of the most knowledgeable people</p>
<p>about music that I know.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got a restaurant coming up.</p>
<p>And I thought my buddy Mark Clem,</p>
<p>being an endurance athlete,</p>
<p>like when you hear some of the things,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know these things existed</p>
<p>that this fucking kid did.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s out of his mind.</p>
<p>And I think Sean and I will have</p>
<p>probably the most intellectual conversation</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll have had on my podcast to date.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a little bit of alternating there,</p>
<p>but I did it that way so that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gut feeling behind, oh, so that what?</p>
<p>Is there, where are you going?</p>
<p>Do you know where you&rsquo;re going?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a destination, but I want to,</p>
<p>I want to see it to its end, whether that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it gets somewhere of its own volition</p>
<p>or it takes on a new life at some point.</p>
<p>And then I know how to drive it where it needs to go.</p>
<p>I think the advice I have for both of us is,</p>
<p>I think I need to, no, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think for you, I see an inner turmoil.</p>
<p>I see a storm that bruising you</p>
<p>because I feel like there&rsquo;s a concern</p>
<p>for what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And is it gonna lead to negative feelings towards you</p>
<p>or the thing that you&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>And I feel like we&rsquo;re different people</p>
<p>and I have such an easier time saying fuck off to everybody.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a liberating thing,</p>
<p>but it also can keep me from achieving the thing</p>
<p>that I want to achieve,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m so flippant with opinions</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t listen to them</p>
<p>and let them direct me when they should.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>Let me push back on that.</p>
<p>Please do.</p>
<p>I think you believe that about yourself</p>
<p>and nevertheless, your social media presence</p>
<p>indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>If I were to be very harsh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like one of the mentally strongest</p>
<p>character wise people I know.</p>
<p>And yet on social media,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t put your face to the world.</p>
<p>So one of the reasons you sense the fear in me,</p>
<p>which exists, I of course want to let go of it,</p>
<p>is because I put my face and my name on things.</p>
<p>And so when I say something stupid,</p>
<p>it hurts when people say like,</p>
<p>look, that guy said something stupid.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a fear of saying something stupid</p>
<p>in all of his different forms,</p>
<p>like of being my lesser self.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same feeling I have in competition</p>
<p>of losing, not just losing.</p>
<p>Losing doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s embarrassing myself.</p>
<p>I like losing, being the lesser version of myself.</p>
<p>And when you put yourself out there in a full way,</p>
<p>I think you,</p>
<p>I would venture to say you&rsquo;re also,</p>
<p>because you said you wouldn&rsquo;t give yourself that advice.</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re also afraid</p>
<p>of standing behind some of the ideas,</p>
<p>because right now you&rsquo;re doing guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re free to be,</p>
<p>to say things, to speak your mind from the sidelines.</p>
<p>But the moment you&rsquo;re standing,</p>
<p>and when people can throw shit at you,</p>
<p>I feel like you haven&rsquo;t faced that fire yet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been avoiding that fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, maybe I&rsquo;m projecting.</p>
<p>No, to a degree you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think a big thing for me was putting ads on</p>
<p>for our Jiu Jitsu online curriculum.</p>
<p>That was a big thing for me,</p>
<p>because for several reasons,</p>
<p>like in the climate of everyone under the sun</p>
<p>having a Jiu Jitsu tutorial online and social media,</p>
<p>not social media necessarily,</p>
<p>but forums specifically that critique and shit the bed.</p>
<p>One thing I have not done that I&rsquo;ve thought about doing,</p>
<p>and probably you&rsquo;re right in your analysis of it,</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ve not gone the way that I do see you</p>
<p>on things like Reddit and say,</p>
<p>hey, Reddit, I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>Like I could easily go to Reddit and say,</p>
<p>hey, Reddit, I got this website up.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample video,</p>
<p>whatever the fuck people do on there.</p>
<p>But yeah, you&rsquo;re right, I haven&rsquo;t done that.</p>
<p>And part of it might be because I know also,</p>
<p>if I get suckered in for one second into the negativity,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna become an online warrior,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna be that person.</p>
<p>So yeah, you&rsquo;re probably right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re self aware about that.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things I&rsquo;ve early on decided</p>
<p>is like, I&rsquo;m just gonna be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always really enjoyed being positive.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to make sure I stay that way.</p>
<p>And when there&rsquo;s negativity, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just ignoring it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally just returning it with positivity.</p>
<p>I probably am the same way as you,</p>
<p>most people are with egos.</p>
<p>You wanna become the warrior against the negativity.</p>
<p>And like many wars, there&rsquo;s no winning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no winning that war.</p>
<p>Especially online.</p>
<p>Especially on the internet.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, that&rsquo;s been a journey</p>
<p>to try to face the fire of the negativity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not actually that bad.</p>
<p>It sounds like very dramatic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many people that are negative,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like when you put advertisements,</p>
<p>so you put your face on an instructional</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It just, there&rsquo;s an aspect to it</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;re being a salesman,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being a gimmicky thing.</p>
<p>It just feels wrong.</p>
<p>And people will point out, look,</p>
<p>that guy is a fraud, like it&rsquo;s fake.</p>
<p>Look, he&rsquo;s trying,</p>
<p>but those people are going to be out there.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re like trying to do your best,</p>
<p>trying to be authentic and not trying to like</p>
<p>be a snake oil salesman</p>
<p>and being like the shady kind of salesman,</p>
<p>I think they keep you honest.</p>
<p>They keep you honestly being the most authentic self.</p>
<p>And podcasting is like the best medium</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re being real.</p>
<p>Those one hour plus that you put out there,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like real John.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a,</p>
<p>like people fall in love with that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the beautiful aspect of podcasting</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>long form doesn&rsquo;t give any possibility</p>
<p>for you not to be authentic.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a magical medium.</p>
<p>The tough thing is you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>popularity takes time, not popularity.</p>
<p>And so like you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it for that reason.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the thing that really drives me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there three books,</p>
<p>technical fiction philosophical that had an impact on you?</p>
<p>Like, is there books that you kind of return to</p>
<p>that you enjoy and that you find profound in some way?</p>
<p>I would say like probably the thing I read</p>
<p>is in one of Emerson&rsquo;s essays that I read</p>
<p>at a point in my life where I needed that type of thing.</p>
<p>And I read self reliance and,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a ton of good essays,</p>
<p>but I thought self reliance was probably</p>
<p>the most impactful to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read later in life,</p>
<p>like a handful of existential authors</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all great,</p>
<p>but at the time a lot of it has to do with timing.</p>
<p>And when I read self reliance</p>
<p>and it was about the individual that was really good</p>
<p>and made it was impactful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a book called Jonathan Livingston Seagull</p>
<p>by Richard Bach, I think.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of along the same lines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about this seagull who wants to break conformity</p>
<p>and learn to fly and do all these other great things.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a very short read.</p>
<p>So if people are interested in that, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>The book, which I was lucky enough to read</p>
<p>before the movie ever even came out,</p>
<p>which is just a pleasure of mine was American Psycho.</p>
<p>Just from a writing standpoint,</p>
<p>I found that the writing was awesome.</p>
<p>Brett Easton Ellis is the author of that</p>
<p>and several other books</p>
<p>who have like intertwining characters.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a New England prep school guy.</p>
<p>And so a lot of like the stories</p>
<p>and a lot of the visuals rang true for me</p>
<p>and anyone who can write four pages of prose</p>
<p>on like a Huey Lewis album, I mean, kudos to you.</p>
<p>And I also would say no one will do this,</p>
<p>but I would at some point read as much</p>
<p>of one of the big three religious texts as possible.</p>
<p>It really gives you perspective.</p>
<p>There are so many overlapping stories of religious texts.</p>
<p>And then the way that they&rsquo;re written</p>
<p>gives you a unique perspective</p>
<p>on different people throughout the world.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a Roman Catholic,</p>
<p>maybe don&rsquo;t read the Bible, read one of the other texts.</p>
<p>And that would be an interesting take, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m embarrassed to say that, first of all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read the Bible, which is embarrassing to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I read a bunch of stuff about the Bible</p>
<p>and not the Bible itself.</p>
<p>And the same, not equating them,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t read Marx directly.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read Mein Kampf by Hitler directly.</p>
<p>And it feels like sometimes,</p>
<p>cause you think like it&rsquo;s better to read stuff</p>
<p>about the books, but ultimately you want,</p>
<p>because like the analysis will be better</p>
<p>in texts that followed it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s value to actually reading like the actual words.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s this power in the words</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a reason why like the Bible</p>
<p>is one of the most impactful books ever.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s in those words</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a value to return to those words.</p>
<p>The communist manifesto is truly frightening</p>
<p>if you read it in like modern context.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth reading.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth reading.</p>
<p>And so is Mein Kampf, not obviously,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s not obvious, but it is not very well written,</p>
<p>but all the ideas that led to the evil that is Hitler</p>
<p>are all in there, which is fascinating to think about</p>
<p>because probably some of the world leaders at the time</p>
<p>should have probably read the books.</p>
<p>He outlined everything he&rsquo;s gonna do.</p>
<p>Offline, you mentioned an Emerson quote that I really like.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to end on this powerful quote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy in the world to live after the world&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy in solitude to live after your own.</p>
<p>The great man is who in the midst of the world</p>
<p>keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.</p>
<p>What does this quote mean to you?</p>
<p>It kind of reinforces the idea</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re here to live your life</p>
<p>and that even when people are trying to</p>
<p>influence you or comment on the decisions</p>
<p>that you make for your life,</p>
<p>you should have the strength to stick by living your life</p>
<p>the way you want to live it,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s one immutable truth for you</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t apply to everyone.</p>
<p>And so people who frown upon</p>
<p>or judge the way that you live</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not, air quotes, conventional,</p>
<p>their opinion should not be something</p>
<p>that impacts the choices that you make.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a relationship now.</p>
<p>Yes. Is that deeply meaningful?</p>
<p>Or are you ultimately still alone?</p>
<p>Are you still just a man in the cold</p>
<p>of the life that is suffering?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m a man who&rsquo;s warm, nestled in a bosom.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end, John.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a friend, you&rsquo;re my coach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll talk many more times in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks for wasting all your time with me today.</p>
<p>Thanks brother.</p>
<p>Thanks Lex, I had an awesome time.</p>
<p>Hope to be back soon.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
