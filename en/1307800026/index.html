    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 24, Germanic Mythology.</p>
<p>The last time I looked at the writings of the Roman historian Tacitus, and I used his</p>
<p>book Germania to explore early Germanic society.</p>
<p>In this episode, I&rsquo;m going to continue exploring Germanic culture, but this time I want to</p>
<p>focus on Germanic mythology and religion, and the impact that Germanic mythology has</p>
<p>had on modern English.</p>
<p>But before I begin, I want to note that I&rsquo;m going to discuss the Germanic runic writing</p>
<p>system in the next episode.</p>
<p>I had originally intended to discuss it this time, but it&rsquo;ll actually fit better in the</p>
<p>next episode.</p>
<p>So next time, I&rsquo;m going to discuss the Gothic tribes and their language, which was the first</p>
<p>Germanic language to be written down and recorded for posterity.</p>
<p>So next time, we&rsquo;ll focus on the early written forms of the Germanic languages.</p>
<p>But now, let&rsquo;s turn to the very broad topic of Germanic mythology, and I want to begin</p>
<p>this topic by establishing a general time frame.</p>
<p>So far, my focus has been on the early Germanic tribes, at a time when there was a more or</p>
<p>less common culture and a common language.</p>
<p>But our knowledge of this early period is somewhat limited.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at some of the archaeological evidence and some of the linguistic evidence,</p>
<p>and last time, I used Tacitus as a source.</p>
<p>But Tacitus only tells us a little bit about Germanic mythology.</p>
<p>In addition to Tacitus, there are a few other early written sources which mention a few</p>
<p>things about the early Germans and their religious practices, but most of what we know about</p>
<p>Germanic mythology comes from much later written sources.</p>
<p>Most of these later sources were written several centuries later, during the early</p>
<p>Middle Ages, so it&rsquo;s difficult to know how much of this mythology was inherited from</p>
<p>the original Germanic tribes, and how much was developed at a later date, after the tribes</p>
<p>began to fracture.</p>
<p>From these later sources, we know the most about the mythology of the northern Germanic</p>
<p>tribes in and around Scandinavia, who were the ancestors of the Vikings.</p>
<p>With respect to the western Germanic tribes, which included the Angles and the Saxons,</p>
<p>there are relatively few written records which actually discuss their religion and mythology.</p>
<p>And there are even fewer records concerning the eastern Germanic tribes, which included</p>
<p>the Goths.</p>
<p>We do know that the Gothic missionary Wafilis converted the Goths to Christianity in the</p>
<p>4th century, but very little is known about their specific beliefs before that conversion.</p>
<p>So why do we know so much about the mythology of the northern Germanic tribes?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a matter of timing.</p>
<p>Writing was very limited among the early Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>The tribes did develop a runic writing system, which they used for inscriptions, but most</p>
<p>of what we know about these tribes comes from the Romans and other literate peoples.</p>
<p>But from the 6th century onward, writing became more and more prevalent throughout the Germanic</p>
<p>regions.</p>
<p>The spread of writing and the Roman alphabet was also accompanied by the spread of the</p>
<p>Roman religion, Christianity.</p>
<p>In fact, as we&rsquo;ll see in later episodes, the spread of writing and Christianity were</p>
<p>very closely linked.</p>
<p>But for purposes of Germanic mythology, this creates a problem.</p>
<p>By the time most of these tribes had adopted writing and began to write about their own</p>
<p>cultures, they&rsquo;d already been converted to Christianity.</p>
<p>And this is generally the case with the Goths and their language, which we&rsquo;ll explore</p>
<p>next time.</p>
<p>Most of the written evidence of the Gothic language comes in the form of the Gothic translation</p>
<p>of the Bible, so we know virtually nothing about their pre-Christian beliefs.</p>
<p>And this is generally true of the western Germanic tribes as well, though we do have</p>
<p>some limited writings about mythology in Old English and other western dialects.</p>
<p>But in the north, the northern Germanic speakers didn&rsquo;t convert to Christianity until much</p>
<p>later, well after they had adopted writing.</p>
<p>So the early northern Germanic writers gave us a very detailed description of their religious</p>
<p>beliefs during this period before Christianity.</p>
<p>But again, did the beliefs of the Old Norse speakers in the 10th century reflect the beliefs</p>
<p>of the early Germanic tribes 8 or 9 centuries earlier?</p>
<p>Well again, that&rsquo;s a little difficult to say.</p>
<p>But there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First, religious views tend to be very conservative.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t tend to change very much over time.</p>
<p>As we look at the later writings of the Germanic tribes, most of these written accounts were</p>
<p>based on oral traditions which date back centuries to the time of the early Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But beyond these very general statements, we can only compare the Old Norse accounts</p>
<p>with the limited written accounts of the western Germanic tribes and the early accounts of</p>
<p>the Roman writers.</p>
<p>And by comparing these various sources, modern historians can make some general conclusions</p>
<p>about the mythology of the original Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s look at the earliest known written sources.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the first written account of Germanic religion comes from Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>After he conquered the Celtic Gauls in the 1st century BC, Caesar wrote a first-hand</p>
<p>account of the Gallic Wars.</p>
<p>Though the book focuses on Gaul and its Celtic-speaking inhabitants, Caesar does make a few references</p>
<p>to the Germanic-speaking tribes to the northeast of Gaul.</p>
<p>And specifically, he distinguishes the Germanic tribes from the Celtic tribes.</p>
<p>And one way in which he does this is to distinguish their religious practices.</p>
<p>As I noted in the episode about the ancient Celts, the Celtic religious leaders were the</p>
<p>Druids.</p>
<p>But Caesar noted that the Germanic tribes didn&rsquo;t have Druid priests.</p>
<p>The Druids routinely used sacrifices as part of their religious practices.</p>
<p>But Caesar wrote that the Germanic tribes didn&rsquo;t have the same high regard for sacrifices</p>
<p>that the Celts had.</p>
<p>And later historians have actually confirmed that the Druids were not a feature of the</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But Caesar&rsquo;s comments about sacrifices have been largely discounted.</p>
<p>We now know that the Germanic tribes actually did believe in sacrifices, and in fact, they</p>
<p>routinely made sacrifices to gain favor with the gods.</p>
<p>Now before we leave Caesar, I should note that he made one other important comment about</p>
<p>the religious beliefs of the Celtic Gauls.</p>
<p>He noted that they worshipped many gods, but that Mercury was their preeminent god.</p>
<p>The Celts actually called their primary god Lugus.</p>
<p>But the Romans tended to associate the gods of foreign people with their own Roman gods.</p>
<p>And of course, Mercury was a Roman god, not a Celtic god.</p>
<p>So for some reason, the Romans associated Mercury with the preeminent Celtic god.</p>
<p>And Caesar confirms this by noting that the Celtic Gauls worshipped Mercury above all</p>
<p>others.</p>
<p>And this reference is actually very important when we get to the writings of Tacitus.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s jump ahead to Tacitus.</p>
<p>Remember that Caesar wrote in the first century BC.</p>
<p>And as I discussed last time, the next major source of information about the Germanic tribes</p>
<p>was Tacitus in his book Germania written at the end of the first century AD.</p>
<p>So about 150 years after Caesar.</p>
<p>And thanks to Tacitus, we get a bit more detailed description of Germanic religion.</p>
<p>Tacitus begins his discussion of Germanic religion by noting that they worshipped Mercury</p>
<p>above all other gods.</p>
<p>And so we see the same connection that Caesar had made with respect to the Gauls a century</p>
<p>and a half earlier.</p>
<p>Once again, we see that the Romans equated the Germanic gods with their own gods.</p>
<p>And again, for some reason, they associated the preeminent god of the Germans with Mercury,</p>
<p>just as they had done with the Celtic god, Lucas.</p>
<p>Of course, the early Germans didn&rsquo;t actually worship the Roman gods.</p>
<p>They worshipped their own gods.</p>
<p>And we know that the preeminent god in Germanic mythology was Woden or Odin.</p>
<p>And just to be clear about that name, because you do see it written both ways, the later</p>
<p>Norse speakers in Scandinavia called the god Odin.</p>
<p>But the Anglo-Saxons called him Woden.</p>
<p>The later Norse speakers tended to drop the W sound when it appeared before a vowel.</p>
<p>So Odin, without the W, developed as a later version of the same name.</p>
<p>But since this is a podcast about English, I&rsquo;m going to use the Anglo-Saxon version</p>
<p>of the name Woden.</p>
<p>So Woden was the primary Germanic god.</p>
<p>But did these early Germanic tribes actually call their god Woden during this very early</p>
<p>common Germanic period?</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Since the Romans didn&rsquo;t use the Germanic names, we can&rsquo;t say for certain what the</p>
<p>original Germanic tribes called this god.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have any written accounts which refer to the god by his later Germanic name</p>
<p>Woden until the 3rd century, shortly after Tacitus.</p>
<p>But linguists have used reconstructions to determine that the original name of the god</p>
<p>would have been something like Wodenaz.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s likely that the early Germans did refer to this god by a very early version</p>
<p>of his later name.</p>
<p>But again, the Romans just called him Mercury.</p>
<p>And we can still see that connection when we look at the days of the week, which I discussed</p>
<p>back in episode 18.</p>
<p>Remember that the Romans had a day named after Mercury, which was basically Mercury&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>And that name still exists in modern Romance languages like French, where the name is Mercury.</p>
<p>And the later Germanic tribes were influenced by the Roman association of Mercury with Woden,</p>
<p>so they substituted Roman Mercury with Germanic Woden.</p>
<p>And the day became Woden&rsquo;s Day, or as we know it today, Wednesday.</p>
<p>So the connection between those gods can still be found in the modern names for that day</p>
<p>of the week.</p>
<p>Tacitus also refuted Caesar&rsquo;s earlier statements regarding Germanic sacrifices.</p>
<p>He noted that, in fact, the Germanic tribes did make both animal and human sacrifices</p>
<p>on specific days.</p>
<p>And later archaeological discoveries have confirmed that the Germans did make animal</p>
<p>and human sacrifices.</p>
<p>Tacitus also notes that the early Germans didn&rsquo;t believe that their gods lived in temples.</p>
<p>Instead, they preferred to conduct religious ceremonies in forests or groves.</p>
<p>And here we see some strong similarities between the Celtic and Germanic religious practices.</p>
<p>Tacitus also tells us that the early Germans discerned the will of the gods by casting</p>
<p>lots.</p>
<p>As he described it, the process involved cutting a tree branch into many different pieces and</p>
<p>placing specific markings on each piece.</p>
<p>The pieces were then cast onto a white cloth.</p>
<p>And a priest, if it was a public ceremony, or the head of the family, if it was a private</p>
<p>ceremony, they would select three pieces at random.</p>
<p>And the markings on those pieces would then be read to determine the will of the gods</p>
<p>or to predict the future, which could essentially be the same thing.</p>
<p>These little pieces of wood, or for that matter, any such objects which were read in this random</p>
<p>manner, were called klutum by the early Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>This word was eventually shortened and it became hlot in Old English.</p>
<p>And it eventually became lot in Middle English.</p>
<p>Around the 12th century, the word cast was borrowed from Old Norse, meaning to throw.</p>
<p>And that word produced words like outcast, meaning to throw someone out.</p>
<p>And it produced phrases like cast away and cast off.</p>
<p>And that word cast was often used in conjunction with the concept of throwing lots.</p>
<p>And it produced the phrase to cast lots, meaning to throw objects in a random manner with some</p>
<p>larger purpose in mind.</p>
<p>So you might cast lots, or in a game involving dice, you might cast a die, which is just</p>
<p>another form of casting lots.</p>
<p>And even today, if we cast our lot with someone, we&rsquo;re basically rolling the dice.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re picking a side and letting fate have its way.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this Germanic word lot was later borrowed into early French and Italian,</p>
<p>and there it produced new words like lottery and lotto.</p>
<p>This comes from the fact that the early version of those games involved putting objects in</p>
<p>a container and shaking them up and selecting certain pieces.</p>
<p>This was a game of chance, which involved a form of casting lots.</p>
<p>So from there, we got the terms lottery and lotto, again, all derived from this original</p>
<p>Germanic method of predicting the fates.</p>
<p>Now in addition to casting lots, Tacitus described another way in which the Germanic tribes predicted</p>
<p>the fates.</p>
<p>He said that they observed the sounds and flights of birds, as well as the neighs and</p>
<p>snorts of horses.</p>
<p>And he said that the early Germans could discern the will of the gods by paying close attention</p>
<p>to those signs.</p>
<p>Now the Germans were not the only ones who thought that the future could be predicted</p>
<p>by observing the flight patterns of birds.</p>
<p>The Romans did that as well, and in fact the Romans coined their own term to describe the</p>
<p>process of trying to predict the fates or the future in any of these random ways.</p>
<p>They called these signs the auspices.</p>
<p>And this term actually came from the process of watching birds in the sky.</p>
<p>The Latin word for bird was avis, which later became avis.</p>
<p>Remember from the last episode that early Latin didn&rsquo;t have the v sound, it had the</p>
<p>w sound.</p>
<p>So weenum became veenum and later veeno.</p>
<p>Well the same thing happened with the Latin word for bird.</p>
<p>Early on it was avis, and it later became avis.</p>
<p>And from that later version of the word we get modern English words like aviary, for</p>
<p>a place where birds are kept, and aviation, for the process of flying like a bird.</p>
<p>Well early on the Romans combined that original version of the word avis with the Latin verb</p>
<p>to watch, which was spectra.</p>
<p>Of course that word gives us English words like spectate and spectator.</p>
<p>Well when you combine the words for bird and watch, you got a bird watcher.</p>
<p>So avis and spectra produced the word auspice, which again was literally a bird watcher,</p>
<p>or someone who predicted the will of the gods by observing the flight patterns of birds.</p>
<p>And there are some linguists who think that this word auspice actually predated the Romans.</p>
<p>The Latin words for bird and watch both come from Indo-European root words.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some evidence that the original Indo-Europeans also combined the same two</p>
<p>root words to produce an even earlier version of the word auspice.</p>
<p>But at any rate, the Romans definitely used the word, and they called the process of watching</p>
<p>birds auspicium.</p>
<p>This word later produced the English word auspicious, meaning a favorable or good sign.</p>
<p>By the way, just as the Romans kept a close eye on the movement of the birds in the sky,</p>
<p>they also paid close attention to the movement and the alignment of the stars.</p>
<p>Of course, the Greeks did this, too, and they thought that the particular alignment</p>
<p>of the stars could be a good omen or a bad omen.</p>
<p>From an earlier episode, we know that the Greek word for star was aster, and that ultimately</p>
<p>gives us the word astrology, which also involved the process of observing stars in the sky.</p>
<p>But it was the Romans who gave us the word for what astrologers watch, which is constellation.</p>
<p>Since a constellation is a group of stars associated with each other, the Romans combined</p>
<p>the word come, meaning with, and stella, which was their word for star, and it produced the</p>
<p>word constellatus, which became constellation.</p>
<p>But the early Romans had actually developed a separate word to refer to a star or group</p>
<p>of stars in the sky, and this separate word came from a separate Indo-European root word,</p>
<p>which originally meant to shine.</p>
<p>This Latin word was cetus.</p>
<p>So the Romans combined this word with that same prefix come, meaning with, to describe</p>
<p>the process of observing the stars, perhaps because you were with the stars as you observed</p>
<p>them to determine the fates.</p>
<p>This combination of come and cetus produced the word considera, and this is the origin</p>
<p>of the modern English word consider, meaning to review or contemplate something.</p>
<p>Well unfortunately when you look for signs in the night sky, you sometimes get bad news,</p>
<p>and the Romans created a word for that which literally meant the stars were out of alignment.</p>
<p>They combined the word da, meaning apart or away from, and the word aster, meaning star,</p>
<p>to produce the word disaster.</p>
<p>So lots, casting lots, lottery lotto, auspicious, astrology, consider, and disaster, all of</p>
<p>those modern words come from this early process of trying to discern the will of the gods</p>
<p>by observing random events, either pieces of wood or birds or stars or some other random</p>
<p>event.</p>
<p>So once again we&rsquo;ve digressed from early Germanic into Latin, but I wanted to make</p>
<p>some historical connections between those words for you.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s turn back to the Germans, and at this point we&rsquo;ve basically exhausted</p>
<p>what Tacitus has to tell us about early Germanic mythology.</p>
<p>So from here we have to look to other sources for information about Germanic religion and</p>
<p>mythology.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, the Germanic languages began to be written down a few centuries after</p>
<p>Tacitus, and these early writings reveal a lot more about the specific Germanic gods</p>
<p>and the religious practices of the early Germanic people.</p>
<p>And by comparing these later sources from different regions, we can discern some common</p>
<p>features that were likely inherited from the earlier Germanic tribes during the common</p>
<p>Germanic period.</p>
<p>We know that the early Germans had their own pantheon of gods.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just Woden.</p>
<p>There were lots of gods with their own unique histories and personalities.</p>
<p>Much of what we know about these gods comes from later sources, especially writings from</p>
<p>Old Norse sources in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>But as I noted earlier, these sources were written many centuries later, so it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>how much of this Norse mythology can be traced back to the original Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But there are a few aspects of these various gods which did have a later impact on the</p>
<p>English language, so I&rsquo;ve picked through the various mythologies and selected a few</p>
<p>bits and pieces which relate to later English, and also relate to our modern culture in general.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, the primary Germanic god was Woden.</p>
<p>And he was worshipped by the early Germanic tribes during the common Germanic era.</p>
<p>He was considered the head of all royal Germanic families.</p>
<p>And even the Anglo-Saxon kings ultimately traced their lineage back to Woden.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Woden was a war god.</p>
<p>And this is consistent with the Germanic emphasis on war.</p>
<p>He was the god of those who died in battle.</p>
<p>He sat upon a throne in the sky and looked down upon the world.</p>
<p>And when warriors died in battle, they would go to Woden&rsquo;s heavenly home called Valhalla.</p>
<p>And it was common for early Germans to use the phrase, journey to Woden, or be a guest</p>
<p>of Woden, to mean to die.</p>
<p>In later mythology, Woden is described as having one eye and wearing a wide-brimmed</p>
<p>hat and a cloak.</p>
<p>He controlled the wind and the water, and he could walk on waves and could arrive through</p>
<p>the air in the form of a storm.</p>
<p>He also rode an eight-legged horse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noted that Wednesday was named after Woden, but beyond that, the name of Woden</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t produce any other words in modern English, at least none that I&rsquo;ve been able</p>
<p>to identify.</p>
<p>However, Woden&rsquo;s influence on modern culture can be seen in other ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially evident in certain Christmas traditions, which were borrowed from the Germanic</p>
<p>pagans.</p>
<p>It appears that the early Germanic tribes were like most ancient peoples of Europe in</p>
<p>that they held a specific mid-winter festival.</p>
<p>These festivals were usually held around the time of the winter solstice, which was the</p>
<p>shortest day of the year.</p>
<p>This date marked the beginning of winter, and in ancient societies, this marked the</p>
<p>beginning of a potentially dangerous period.</p>
<p>The growing and harvesting season was over, and if the tribe didn&rsquo;t have enough food</p>
<p>stored, the following months could bring starvation and death.</p>
<p>So going all the way back to the Stone Age, many of these ancient societies would hold</p>
<p>a festival around this time of the year, around the winter solstice.</p>
<p>They would make sacrifices to the gods to ensure divine protection during the winter</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>To avoid having to feed cattle throughout the winter, most of the cattle would be slaughtered.</p>
<p>So with fully harvested crops and lots of slaughtered animals, food was abundant.</p>
<p>And throughout the year, fruits and grains had been fermenting.</p>
<p>And now, late in the year, all of this fruit and grain finally completed the fermentation</p>
<p>process, and that meant wine and ale, lots of it.</p>
<p>So drinking was a prominent feature at these celebrations as well.</p>
<p>So these festivals were all about eating, drinking, and making sacrifices.</p>
<p>And this type of mid-winter festival was the last big celebration of the year, just before</p>
<p>winter began.</p>
<p>Well the Germanic tribes had their own mid-winter festival, and it was probably part of the</p>
<p>same ancient tradition which had been handed down from their ancestors over the centuries.</p>
<p>The Germanic version of this mid-winter festival evolved into a specific festival which would</p>
<p>last 12 days, and we know this celebration today as the Yule.</p>
<p>And the reason we know that name is by looking at the names of the months, which were used</p>
<p>by the later Germanic tribes before they converted to Christianity and began to adopt the Latin</p>
<p>names which we still use today in English.</p>
<p>For example, in the Old English dialect of the Anglo-Saxons, December was known as the</p>
<p>Ara-Geola, which meant before the 12-day Yule festival.</p>
<p>And the following month, basically modern January, was called After-Geola, which meant</p>
<p>after the Yule festival.</p>
<p>Most of the other Germanic languages also named those months after the Yule period,</p>
<p>including the Gothic language which was attested as early as the 4th century.</p>
<p>The word Eola eventually evolved into the modern version of the word Yule.</p>
<p>Now as Christianity expanded into northern Europe, the church had a choice to make.</p>
<p>It could either condemn these pagan festivals, or it could co-opt them.</p>
<p>If the church rejected the festivals, it would tend to alienate the native people.</p>
<p>But if it adopted these celebrations, then it would be easier to convert the native</p>
<p>population to Christianity.</p>
<p>And ultimately, that&rsquo;s what the church did.</p>
<p>It accommodated the beliefs and traditions of the native peoples by adopting the Yule</p>
<p>festival into the existing Christmas celebrations.</p>
<p>And the terms Yule and Yuletide, meaning Yule time, passed into English with their modern</p>
<p>associations with Christmas.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the Germanic Yule festival lasted for a period of 12 days.</p>
<p>And from this 12-day festival, we got the 12-day Christmas celebration, which began</p>
<p>on December 25th.</p>
<p>This 12-day celebration of Christmas was actually very common in much of Europe during the Middle</p>
<p>Ages, including the British Isles.</p>
<p>And some elements of that 12-day celebration still exist there.</p>
<p>But very little of the 12-day celebration has made it to modern America.</p>
<p>Of course, we still have the song, the 12 days of Christmas, and some people light a</p>
<p>candle at Christmas for each of the 12 days of Christmas.</p>
<p>But these are merely remnants of the 12-day celebration, which owes its roots to the Germanic</p>
<p>Yule festival.</p>
<p>By the way, it was common in the early Germanic period to burn a large tree throughout the</p>
<p>12-day celebration.</p>
<p>It was sort of like a big bonfire that burned for 12 days.</p>
<p>This log was called the Yule log, and that tradition was also incorporated into the later</p>
<p>12 days of Christmas.</p>
<p>As people began to have homes with fireplaces, they would burn a log in the fireplace each</p>
<p>day during the 12 days of Christmas.</p>
<p>So if you ever wondered what a Yule log was, well, now you know.</p>
<p>So you may ask, what does all of this have to do with the Germanic god Woden?</p>
<p>Well, during the Yule period, it was believed that supernatural and ghostly events would occur.</p>
<p>One of these events was the so-called Wild Hunt, in which Woden would lead a ghostly</p>
<p>procession across the sky.</p>
<p>And many historians believe that this was the ultimate origin of certain ideas and aspects</p>
<p>that would later play a role in the figure of Santa Claus.</p>
<p>The Yule-time figure of Woden had a long white beard, and he rode a gray horse across the</p>
<p>sky.</p>
<p>By the time of the later Norse traditions of the 13th century, Woden, or Odin, still</p>
<p>had a long white beard, but now he had a blue hood, and his horse had eight legs, and he</p>
<p>bore gifts.</p>
<p>These aspects of Woden later influenced the figure of Sinterklaas, which developed in</p>
<p>and around Belgium, the Netherlands, and parts of northern Germany.</p>
<p>Sinterklaas developed as part of the December celebration of Saint Nicholas, who was a real-life</p>
<p>person who lived in the 3rd and 4th centuries, and who was the patron saint of children.</p>
<p>So Sinterklaas was based around this particular celebration in and around the Netherlands.</p>
<p>And the name Sinterklaas was actually derived from the name Saint Nicholas.</p>
<p>Sinterklaas eventually got mixed in with the English figure of Father Christmas, thereby</p>
<p>completing the evolution from the northern European Sinterklaas to the anglicized Santa</p>
<p>Klaus.</p>
<p>He still has his long white beard, and he still bears gifts, and he still lives in the</p>
<p>cold and icy north, now the North Pole.</p>
<p>In some depictions he still has a hood, only now it&rsquo;s red instead of blue, and he still</p>
<p>rides through the sky at night during Christmas time, only instead of an eight-legged horse,</p>
<p>he now has eight reindeer.</p>
<p>So you can see how some of these ancient Germanic figures and religious traditions have filtered</p>
<p>down to us in modern Christianity and modern English.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about Woden, and modern historians believe that Woden was actively</p>
<p>worshipped in some early form by the original Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But what about the other gods which appear in later Anglo-Saxon and Norse mythologies?</p>
<p>Were they also worshipped by the original Germanic tribes?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a tougher question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noted in earlier episodes that just as Wednesday was named after Woden, Tuesday</p>
<p>was named after the god Tiu, or Tir as he was known in Old Norse.</p>
<p>And you might also remember from a very early episode of the podcast that Tiu is cognate</p>
<p>with the Greek god Zeus and the Roman god Jupiter.</p>
<p>The names of all of those gods originated with an original Indo-European word which</p>
<p>meant sky-father.</p>
<p>So, since Tiu had roots within the original Indo-European language that continued throughout</p>
<p>the Germanic period, that suggests that even the earliest Germans had some concept of this</p>
<p>god Tiu.</p>
<p>But in later Norse mythology, Tiu or Tir doesn&rsquo;t play that same prominent role that Zeus plays</p>
<p>in Greek mythology or Jupiter plays in Roman mythology.</p>
<p>So what happened to Tiu?</p>
<p>Well, we can&rsquo;t say for certain.</p>
<p>But he was still a sky god in the later Norse mythology.</p>
<p>For example, he could arrive from the sky as a storm.</p>
<p>So the fact that he was a sky god seems to have been retained from the original Indo-European</p>
<p>version of the god.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s clearly subordinate to Woden in the Germanic pantheon of gods.</p>
<p>In fact, he&rsquo;s sometimes depicted as the son of Woden.</p>
<p>So was he downgraded at some point?</p>
<p>Well maybe.</p>
<p>Tacitus may actually give us a clue to this.</p>
<p>You might remember from the last episode that Tacitus began his book Germania by dividing</p>
<p>the Germanic tribes into three separate groups.</p>
<p>And he stated that each of those tribal groups were descended from the three sons of an ancient</p>
<p>god.</p>
<p>The god&rsquo;s name was Manus.</p>
<p>And Tacitus also states that the father of Manus was a god named Tuisto.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all he says about Tuisto.</p>
<p>But some modern scholars think that Tuisto was the earlier version of Tiu or Tir.</p>
<p>And if so, that would make sense given what we know about Zeus and Jupiter.</p>
<p>That would make Tuisto the ultimate father, or more precisely the grandfather, of the</p>
<p>Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>But again, Tacitus doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything else about Tuisto.</p>
<p>And we know from Tacitus himself that Tuisto was not the primary god worshiped by the Germans.</p>
<p>So perhaps around the time of Tacitus in the first century AD, Tiu held a lofty status</p>
<p>in the overall pantheon of Germanic gods, but he wasn&rsquo;t actively worshipped in the</p>
<p>way that Woden was.</p>
<p>At any rate, by the time we get to the later Anglo-Saxon and Norse versions of Tiu, we</p>
<p>can see lots of parallels with Woden.</p>
<p>They were both sky gods, and they were both gods of war.</p>
<p>And scholars believe Tiu was a god of war because the later Romans equated him with</p>
<p>the Roman god Mars, which is also how French Marti, named after Mars, became English Tuesday,</p>
<p>named after Tiu.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s move on to another Germanic god.</p>
<p>In fact, let&rsquo;s discuss probably the most famous Germanic god in modern Western culture,</p>
<p>because even Hollywood knows about this god.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m talking about Thor.</p>
<p>Again, we know from earlier episodes of the podcast that Thursday was originally Thorsday.</p>
<p>He was a popular deity and was also known as the Thunder God.</p>
<p>In fact, his name literally meant thunder in Old Norse.</p>
<p>And it comes from the same Germanic root as the English word thunder.</p>
<p>So Thor and thunder are cognate.</p>
<p>Thor was a great warrior with incredible strength, and of course his famous weapon was a hammer,</p>
<p>which could be thrown and which would automatically return to his hand.</p>
<p>He was named after thunder because he announced himself through thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>So was Thor around during the time of Tacitus, or was he a later creation?</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t have any specific references to Thor during the time of Tacitus, so we</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t say for certain that he was being worshipped at that time.</p>
<p>But some modern scholars speculate that Thor may indeed have been around at this very early stage.</p>
<p>In fact, they speculate that Thor was actually a very old god and may have even predated</p>
<p>Woden and he may have held a higher position than Woden at some point in the Germanic pantheon of gods.</p>
<p>Again, this is only speculation.</p>
<p>But the reason why some scholars have proposed this view is the fact that Thor is so closely</p>
<p>associated with thunder.</p>
<p>I noted that the words thunder and Thor were cognate.</p>
<p>Well, the word thunder has very strong Indo-European roots.</p>
<p>The word appears in very similar forms in both Latin and Persian as well as the Germanic</p>
<p>languages.</p>
<p>And they all share the same root with the Sanskrit word for thunder as well.</p>
<p>So if Thor was closely associated with thunder, then there may have been deeper roots among</p>
<p>the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>Many ancient agricultural societies had specific thunder gods.</p>
<p>And those gods were extremely important because they controlled thunderstorms and rain.</p>
<p>And that meant they were responsible for the fertility of the land.</p>
<p>And in fact, Zeus was a thunder god and was one of the oldest gods in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>So if the original Indo-Europeans had a distinct thunder god, that god may have passed on to</p>
<p>the early Germans as a very early version of Thor.</p>
<p>Again, this is all speculation, but it&rsquo;s an interesting argument.</p>
<p>Outside of Thursday, which comes from Thor&rsquo;s name, and thunder, which comes from the same</p>
<p>root as Thor, the only other word in English connected to the name Thor is thorium, the</p>
<p>chemical element which was named after Thor by a Swedish chemist in the 1800s.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered the gods which gave us the names of Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s turn to Friday.</p>
<p>Friday was named after a Germanic goddess.</p>
<p>But the precise one is a matter of some debate.</p>
<p>Most scholars attribute the source of the name Friday to the goddess Frigga.</p>
<p>Frigga was the wife of Woden.</p>
<p>But Germanic mythology also had another goddess named Freya.</p>
<p>And because of the similarity of the names, the two are often confused.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually some evidence that the two goddesses originated as a single goddess</p>
<p>in very early Germanic mythology.</p>
<p>And later, the original goddess evolved into two separate goddesses.</p>
<p>In fact, Freya was only known in northern Germany.</p>
<p>And the southern Germanic regions only recognized a goddess whose name was almost identical</p>
<p>to Frigga.</p>
<p>So, as the early tribes began to migrate and separate from each other, the original goddess</p>
<p>may have taken on distinct identities within the northern and southern tribes.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that our sources of knowledge about these goddesses come from much later</p>
<p>Nordic accounts.</p>
<p>So by the time of these later sources, these separate versions of the original goddess</p>
<p>may have just been considered completely separate goddesses altogether.</p>
<p>As I noted in an earlier episode, Friday is generally attributed to Frigga, the wife of</p>
<p>Woden.</p>
<p>But it appears that some of the Germanic tribes named the day after Freya instead.</p>
<p>For example, many scholars think the name of the day in Icelandic is named after Freya.</p>
<p>And remember that Freya was only known in the northern regions.</p>
<p>So that connection makes sense.</p>
<p>Now in addition to Freya and Frigga, there&rsquo;s another Germanic goddess which I need to mention</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s also important to modern English and modern Christianity.</p>
<p>The goddess was called Eastra.</p>
<p>She represented increasing sunlight and therefore she came to represent spring and fertility</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>The name of the goddess actually has its origins in the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The Indo-European word aus meant to shine, specifically shining at dawn.</p>
<p>And so this word came to be associated with the sun rising in the morning.</p>
<p>And this Indo-European word aus ultimately produced the word east as in the place or</p>
<p>direction where the sun rises in the morning.</p>
<p>This Indo-European root word also produced a Roman goddess, Aurora, the goddess of the</p>
<p>dawn.</p>
<p>And, of course, the name Aurora has passed into modern English as another word referring</p>
<p>to dawn.</p>
<p>But amongst the Germanic tribes who descended from the same original Indo-Europeans, that</p>
<p>same original Indo-European root word produced the name of this Germanic goddess, Eastra.</p>
<p>And it also produced another Germanic word, Austrin, which originally referred to the</p>
<p>sunrise feast which was celebrated at the spring equinox.</p>
<p>And in fact, the name of the goddess Eastra was probably derived from this Germanic word</p>
<p>for the sunrise feast.</p>
<p>Since the spring equinox marked the beginning of spring, which was the start of the planting</p>
<p>and growing season, it was considered a time of fertility.</p>
<p>And the goddess Eastra came to represent the springtime.</p>
<p>And she therefore became a goddess of fertility.</p>
<p>Of course, the importance of Eastra to modern English and Christianity is the fact that</p>
<p>her name is the source of the word Easter.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Anglo-Saxons converted to Christianity, they incorporated certain aspects</p>
<p>of the spring Austrin celebration into the early Christian celebrations commemorating</p>
<p>the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>The timing of the Christian celebrations coincided with the Germanic spring celebration.</p>
<p>The Christian celebration also represented a rebirth of sorts, so its connection with</p>
<p>the fertility goddess Eastra made sense.</p>
<p>So the Anglo-Saxons made this connection, and they borrowed the goddess&rsquo; name as the</p>
<p>name of the Christian celebrations.</p>
<p>By the way, have you ever wondered what the Easter bunny and Easter eggs have to do with</p>
<p>the resurrection of Christ in the Bible?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the connection.</p>
<p>Bunnies and eggs represent fertility.</p>
<p>Obviously, rabbits reproduce very quickly.</p>
<p>And eggs are new chickens and birds just waiting to hatch.</p>
<p>So these fertility symbols were closely associated with spring fertility.</p>
<p>And so these pagan springtime fertility symbols, including the name of the spring fertility</p>
<p>goddess, they became associated with the springtime Christian holiday celebrating a different</p>
<p>type of rebirth.</p>
<p>But I should note that this association of the name of the Christian holiday with the</p>
<p>spring fertility goddess, that was somewhat unique to the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Almost all neighboring languages use a variant of the Latin pascha to name this holiday.</p>
<p>But again, just like with the combination of the Yule celebrations with Christmas, we</p>
<p>can see the mixing of Germanic pagan traditions and Christian traditions as Christianity spread</p>
<p>in northern Europe.</p>
<p>Now beyond the gods and the goddesses which I&rsquo;ve mentioned, there were many other Germanic</p>
<p>deities as well.</p>
<p>Most of those didn&rsquo;t have much of an impact on modern English, so I&rsquo;m not going to address</p>
<p>all of them here.</p>
<p>But I did want to mention one other god before I conclude this episode.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the Germanic god Loki.</p>
<p>Loki was a trickster god.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s found his way into modern popular culture thanks to movies like the Avengers.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s important to our story because he was the father of a daughter goddess named</p>
<p>Hel.</p>
<p>According to later Norse mythology, Hel was banished to a cold, dark, misty world where</p>
<p>she became the goddess of the dead and came to represent the realm of the evil dead.</p>
<p>And as Christianity spread into northern Europe, it borrowed the name of this goddess just</p>
<p>like it had borrowed the name of Eostre for Easter.</p>
<p>The goddess Hel who oversaw the realm of the evil dead became the word for the Christian</p>
<p>concept of the place where bad people go when they die.</p>
<p>So the modern term Hel, spelled H-E-L-L, it was taken directly from the name of this Germanic</p>
<p>goddess.</p>
<p>But the use of the term was secured within English when it was used in the King James</p>
<p>Bible to translate the Greek word Hades, referring to the same place.</p>
<p>Now speaking of the place where dead people go when they die, the early Germans were like</p>
<p>many ancient people in that they believed a dead person would continue to live after</p>
<p>death in his or her grave.</p>
<p>Therefore, a corpse was buried with everything the person might need in the afterlife.</p>
<p>And this is largely determined by examining the grave evidence from this period.</p>
<p>Then it appears that the Germanic people believed that there was a realm of the dead</p>
<p>within the ocean or other bodies of water.</p>
<p>When prominent tribe members or leaders died, a special ship was prepared for the deceased</p>
<p>final voyage.</p>
<p>The deceased person was then buried with the ship.</p>
<p>This process is actually documented throughout later Germanic literature after writing was</p>
<p>adopted by the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>For example, Beowulf begins with a description of this ceremony.</p>
<p>In one modern English translation, the passage reads in part,</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s dear comrades carried his body to the sea&rsquo;s current, as he himself had ordered</p>
<p>when he still gave commands.</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s dear leader had ruled for a long time.</p>
<p>There at the harbor stood the ring-carved prow, the nobles&rsquo; vessel, icy, sea-ready.</p>
<p>They laid down the king that they had dearly loved, their tall ring-giver, in the center</p>
<p>of the ship, the mighty by the mast.</p>
<p>Great treasure was there, bright gold and silver, gems from far lands.</p>
<p>As you may know, in 1938, archaeologists unearthed an Anglo-Saxon ship loaded with artifacts</p>
<p>at Sutton Hoo in eastern England.</p>
<p>The ship was part of a large Anglo-Saxon burial ceremony which probably dates back to the</p>
<p>early 7th century.</p>
<p>And this find is extremely important to Anglo-Saxon scholars, but we&rsquo;ll deal with all of that</p>
<p>when we get to the Old English period.</p>
<p>The main point here is to show the connection between the dead and the sea, which was a</p>
<p>prominent feature of Germanic mythology.</p>
<p>The northern Germanic tribes had access to the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, so they</p>
<p>believed that the kingdom of the dead existed at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>But the southern and eastern Germanic tribes were landlocked, so they tended to believe</p>
<p>that the kingdom of the dead existed in certain lakes.</p>
<p>The ritual of ship burial was linked to this belief, because a dead king might need his</p>
<p>ship to travel to this underworld kingdom of the dead.</p>
<p>And we can also see this belief in certain words in modern English.</p>
<p>For example, the words sol, s-o-u-l, and sea, s-e-a, they both derive from the same</p>
<p>common Germanic root word.</p>
<p>That original Germanic word was sywas, and it meant lake or inland sea.</p>
<p>And that word eventually became sea in modern English.</p>
<p>But that root word also produced the later Germanic word sywelo, which meant something</p>
<p>belonging to a lake or deriving from a lake.</p>
<p>And that term later evolved into the modern English word sol.</p>
<p>The word sol can be specifically traced back to Germanic dialects spoken in southern and</p>
<p>eastern Germany, where lakes were considered the place where souls returned to death.</p>
<p>But interestingly, that early word for soul isn&rsquo;t found in the early northern Germanic</p>
<p>dialects.</p>
<p>So it appears that the word sol was originally connected to the lakes, but not the sea.</p>
<p>By the way, many scholars also think this is the connection to the old belief that the</p>
<p>stork delivered newborn babies.</p>
<p>This belief apparently originated within the Germanic regions of northern Europe, and it</p>
<p>reflects the idea that there&rsquo;s a place beneath the lake where souls live, in this case souls</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t yet been born as humans.</p>
<p>Also, remember that the original Germanic concept of hell was not a place of fire and</p>
<p>brimstone, that&rsquo;s the Christian version.</p>
<p>The original Germanic version was an underwater kingdom of dead souls.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;s some interesting etymology here as well.</p>
<p>The name of the goddess Hel, H-E-L, and her underwater kingdom, called Hel, actually that</p>
<p>can be traced back to the original Indo-European language.</p>
<p>The Indo-European root word was Kel, which meant to cover or conceal.</p>
<p>But remember Grimslaw, the original K sound became an H sound in the original Germanic</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>So, Kel became Hel.</p>
<p>But again, it came from a root word meaning to cover or conceal.</p>
<p>So we can see that connection to an underwater kingdom, which is concealed or covered by</p>
<p>a lake.</p>
<p>But that same original Indo-European root word, Kel, passed into Latin as Kella, spelled</p>
<p>C-E-L-L-A.</p>
<p>And if you remember back to the history of the letter C, the Latin K sound shifted to</p>
<p>an S sound before an E or an I in early French.</p>
<p>So Latin Kella became French Cell.</p>
<p>And from French, the word passed into modern English in basically the same form.</p>
<p>And today, we have the word Cell, as in jail cell, to mean a place where a person is concealed</p>
<p>or contained.</p>
<p>So Cell and Hel both come from the same original Indo-European root word.</p>
<p>Hel is the Germanic version, and Cell is the Latin and French version.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time talking about Germanic gods and goddesses, but I should</p>
<p>also note that Germanic mythology also involves lots of other mythological beings and creatures.</p>
<p>For example, it features beings like giants, dwarves, Nixies, and elves.</p>
<p>Of course, J.R.R. Tolkien used many of these creatures in his books, like The Hobbit and</p>
<p>The Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p>And the Brothers Grimm also collected many folktales which involved these same creatures.</p>
<p>And these beings and creatures then passed to many other works of literature and fantasy.</p>
<p>So we see these creatures throughout Western literature today, but most of their characteristics</p>
<p>can be traced back to Germanic mythology.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to conclude this episode about Germanic religion and mythology on that note.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;ve seen how the religion of the early Germans had a significant influence</p>
<p>on modern English, as well as modern Christianity and our modern Western culture.</p>
<p>Next time, I&rsquo;m going to move the story of the Germanic people forward a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to look beyond the early common Germanic period to the later period around</p>
<p>the 3rd and 4th centuries.</p>
<p>During this time frame, new distinct tribes began to emerge.</p>
<p>And one of those tribes was the Goths.</p>
<p>And also during this period, some of the early Germans began to adopt writing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at the development of Germanic runic writing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at the Gothic translation of the Bible and related religious texts.</p>
<p>And this is all very important because it marks the first time that we have the German</p>
<p>people writing down their own language for later generations to read.</p>
<p>So we can read their words in their own languages.</p>
<p>So next time, we&rsquo;ll look at the Goths and the written language of the early Germans.</p>
<p>Until then, thanks for listening to the History of English podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Chris.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you next time.</p>
