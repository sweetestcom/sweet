    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire</p>
<p>to bring you zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs</p>
<p>in the sense that I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s any one substance or collection of substances</p>
<p>that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There, you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about dreaming,</p>
<p>learning during dreaming, and unlearning during dreaming,</p>
<p>in particular, unlearning of troubling emotional events.</p>
<p>Now, my interest in dreaming goes way back.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I had a friend,</p>
<p>and he came over one day, and he brought with him a mask</p>
<p>that had a little red light in the corner.</p>
<p>He had purchased this thing</p>
<p>through some magazine ad that he had seen,</p>
<p>and this mask was supposed to trigger lucid dreaming.</p>
<p>Lucid dreaming is the experience of dreaming during sleep,</p>
<p>but being aware that one is dreaming,</p>
<p>and in some cases, being able to direct one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dream activities.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a lucid dream,</p>
<p>and you want to fly, for instance,</p>
<p>some people report being able to initiate</p>
<p>that experience of flying,</p>
<p>or to contort themselves into an animal,</p>
<p>or to transport themselves</p>
<p>to wherever they want within the dream.</p>
<p>I tried this device.</p>
<p>The way it worked is you put on the mask</p>
<p>during a waking state, wide awake,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d look at the little light flashing in the corner,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d also wear it when you went to sleep at night,</p>
<p>and indeed, while I was asleep,</p>
<p>I could see the red light, presumably through my eyelids,</p>
<p>although for all I know, I had opened my eyes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I was asleep,</p>
<p>and then because I was dreaming,</p>
<p>and I was experiencing something very vivid,</p>
<p>I was able to recognize that I was dreaming,</p>
<p>and then start to direct some of the events</p>
<p>within that dream.</p>
<p>Now, lucid dreaming occurs in about 20% of people,</p>
<p>and in a small percentage of those people,</p>
<p>they lucid dream almost every night,</p>
<p>so much so that many of them report their sleep</p>
<p>not being as restorative as it would be otherwise.</p>
<p>Now, all of this is to say that lucid dreaming</p>
<p>and dreaming are profound experiences.</p>
<p>We tend to feel extremely attached to our dream experience.</p>
<p>This may explain the phenomenon</p>
<p>of people who have a very intense dream,</p>
<p>they need to somehow tell everybody about that dream,</p>
<p>or tell someone about that dream.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know what that behavior is about,</p>
<p>but sometimes we wake up,</p>
<p>and we feel so attached to what happened in this state</p>
<p>that we call dreaming,</p>
<p>that there seems to be an intense need</p>
<p>to share it with other people,</p>
<p>presumably to process it and make sense of it.</p>
<p>Now, numerous people throughout history</p>
<p>have tried to make sense of dreams</p>
<p>in some sort of organized way,</p>
<p>the most famous of which, of course, is Sigmund Freud,</p>
<p>who talked about symbolic representations in dreams.</p>
<p>A lot of that has been kind of debunked,</p>
<p>although I think that there&rsquo;s some interest</p>
<p>in what the symbols of dreaming are,</p>
<p>and this is something that we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>in more depth today,</p>
<p>although not Freudian theory in particular.</p>
<p>So I think in order to really think about dreams</p>
<p>and what to do with them,</p>
<p>and how to maximize the dream experience</p>
<p>for sake of learning and unlearning,</p>
<p>the best way to address this</p>
<p>is to look at the physiology of sleep,</p>
<p>to really address what do we know concretely about sleep?</p>
<p>So first of all, as we get sleepy,</p>
<p>we tend to shut our eyes,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because there are some autonomic centers</p>
<p>in the brain, some neurons that control</p>
<p>closing of the eyelids when we get sleepy,</p>
<p>and then we transition into sleep,</p>
<p>and sleep, regardless of how long we sleep,</p>
<p>is generally broken up into a series of 90-minute cycles,</p>
<p>these ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>So early in the night,</p>
<p>these 90-minute cycles tend to be comprised</p>
<p>more of shallow sleep and slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>so stage one, stage two, et cetera,</p>
<p>and what we call slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go into detail about what all this means in a moment.</p>
<p>And we tend to have less so-called REM sleep,</p>
<p>R-E-M sleep, which stands for rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll talk about rapid eye movement sleep in detail.</p>
<p>So early in the night,</p>
<p>a lot more slow-wave sleep and less REM.</p>
<p>For every 90-minute cycle that we have</p>
<p>during a night of sleep,</p>
<p>we tend to start having more and more REM sleep,</p>
<p>so more of that 90-minute cycle</p>
<p>is comprised of REM sleep and less of slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>Now, this is true regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you wake up at the middle of the night</p>
<p>to use the restroom or your sleep is broken.</p>
<p>The more sleep you&rsquo;re getting across the night,</p>
<p>the more REM sleep you&rsquo;re going to have.</p>
<p>And REM sleep and non-REM, as I&rsquo;ll refer to it,</p>
<p>have distinctly different roles in learning and unlearning,</p>
<p>and they are responsible for learning and unlearning</p>
<p>of distinctly different types of information.</p>
<p>And this has enormous implications</p>
<p>for learning of motor skills,</p>
<p>for unlearning of traumatic events,</p>
<p>or for processing emotionally challenging,</p>
<p>as well as emotionally pleasing events.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll see,</p>
<p>one can actually leverage their daytime activities</p>
<p>in order to access more slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>or non-REM sleep, as we&rsquo;ll call it,</p>
<p>or more REM sleep,</p>
<p>depending on your particular emotional and physical needs.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really a remarkable stage of life</p>
<p>that we have a lot more control and power over</p>
<p>than you might believe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also talk about lucid dreaming.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about hallucinations</p>
<p>and how drug-induced hallucinations</p>
<p>have a surprising similarity to a lot of dream states,</p>
<p>and yet some really important differences.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s start by talking about slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>or non-REM sleep.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that slow-wave sleep and non-REM sleep</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>So for you sleep aficionados out there,</p>
<p>I am lumping right now.</p>
<p>As we say in science,</p>
<p>there are lumpers and there are splitters,</p>
<p>and I am both.</p>
<p>Sometimes I lump, sometimes I split.</p>
<p>For sake of clarity and ease of conversation right now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be a lumper.</p>
<p>So when I say slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>I mean non-REM sleep generally,</p>
<p>although I acknowledge there is a distinction.</p>
<p>Slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>So slow-wave sleep is characterized</p>
<p>by a particular pattern of brain activity</p>
<p>in which the brain is metabolically active,</p>
<p>but that there&rsquo;s these big sweeping waves of activity</p>
<p>that include a lot of the brain.</p>
<p>If you want to look this up there,</p>
<p>you can find evidence for sweeping of waves</p>
<p>of neural activity across association cortex,</p>
<p>across big swaths of the brainstem,</p>
<p>the so-called pons chiniculate occipital pathway.</p>
<p>This is brainstem, thalamus, and then cortex.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested,</p>
<p>although more of that is going to occur in REM sleep.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting thing about slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>are the neuromodulators that tend to be associated with it</p>
<p>that are most active and least active</p>
<p>during slow-wave sleep, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>To remind you, neuromodulators are these chemicals</p>
<p>that act rather slowly,</p>
<p>but their main role is to bias particular brain circuits</p>
<p>to be active and other brain circuits to not be active.</p>
<p>These are like the music playlist.</p>
<p>Think of neuromodulators,</p>
<p>and these come in the names of acetylcholine,</p>
<p>norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.</p>
<p>Think of them as suggesting playlists on your audio device.</p>
<p>So classical music is distinctly different in feel and tone</p>
<p>and a number of other features from like third-wave punk</p>
<p>or from hip hop, right?</p>
<p>So think of them as biasing toward particular genres</p>
<p>of neural circuit activity, okay?</p>
<p>Mellow music versus really aggressive fast music</p>
<p>or rhythmic music that includes lyrics</p>
<p>versus rhythmic music that doesn&rsquo;t include lyrics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more or less the way</p>
<p>to think about these neuromodulators,</p>
<p>and they are associated as a consequence</p>
<p>with certain brain functions.</p>
<p>So we know, for instance,</p>
<p>and just to review, acetylcholine in waking states</p>
<p>is a neuromodulator that tends to amplify the activity</p>
<p>of brain circuits associated with focus and attention.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator</p>
<p>that tends to amplify the brain circuits</p>
<p>associated with alertness and the desire to move.</p>
<p>Serotonin is the neuromodulator that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>and tends to amplify the circuits in the brain and body</p>
<p>that are associated with bliss</p>
<p>and the desire to remain still.</p>
<p>And dopamine is the neuromodulator that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>and is associated with amplification</p>
<p>of the neural circuits in the brain and body</p>
<p>associated with pursuing goals and pleasure and reward, okay?</p>
<p>So in slow-wave sleep, something really interesting happens.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s essentially no acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine production and release and action</p>
<p>from the two major sites, which are in the brainstem,</p>
<p>which from a nucleus, the parabigeminal nucleus,</p>
<p>if you really want to know,</p>
<p>or from the forebrain, which is nucleus basalis,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to know these names,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;d like, that&rsquo;s why I put them out there.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine production plummets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just almost to zero.</p>
<p>And acetylcholine, as I just mentioned,</p>
<p>is associated with focus.</p>
<p>So you can think of slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>as these big sweeping waves of activity through the brain</p>
<p>and a kind of distortion of space and time</p>
<p>so that we&rsquo;re not really focusing on any one thing.</p>
<p>Now, the other molecules that are very active at that time</p>
<p>are norepinephrine, which is a little bit surprising</p>
<p>because normally in waking states,</p>
<p>norepinephrine is going to be associated</p>
<p>with a lot of alertness and the desire to move,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not a ton of norepinephrine around</p>
<p>in slow-wave sleep, but it is around.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something associated</p>
<p>with the movement circuitry going on in slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>And remember, this is happening mostly</p>
<p>at the beginning of the night.</p>
<p>Your sleep is dominated by slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>So no acetylcholine, very little norepinephrine,</p>
<p>although there is some, and a lot of serotonin.</p>
<p>And serotonin, again, is associated with this desire,</p>
<p>this sensation of kind of bliss or wellbeing,</p>
<p>but not a lot of movement.</p>
<p>And during sleep, you tend not to move.</p>
<p>Now, in slow-wave sleep, you can move.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not paralyzed, so you can roll over.</p>
<p>If people are going to sleepwalk,</p>
<p>typically it&rsquo;s going to be during slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>And what studies have shown</p>
<p>through some kind of sadistic experiments</p>
<p>where people are deprived specifically of slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>and that can be done by waking them up</p>
<p>as soon as the electrode recordings show</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>or by chemically altering their sleep</p>
<p>so that it biases them away from slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>what studies have shown is that motor learning</p>
<p>is generally occurring in slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say the day before you go to sleep,</p>
<p>you were learning some new dance move,</p>
<p>or you were learning some specific motor skill,</p>
<p>either a fine motor skill or a coarse motor skill.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a new form of exercise</p>
<p>or some new coordinated movements.</p>
<p>This could be coordinated movement</p>
<p>at the level of the fingers,</p>
<p>or it could be coordinated movement</p>
<p>at the level of the whole body and large limb movements.</p>
<p>It could involve other people,</p>
<p>or it could be a solo activity.</p>
<p>Learning of those skills</p>
<p>is happening primarily during slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>in the early part of the night.</p>
<p>In addition, slow-wave sleep has been shown to be important</p>
<p>for the learning of detailed information.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t always cognitive information.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about cognitive information,</p>
<p>but the studies that have been done along these lines</p>
<p>involve having people learn very detailed information</p>
<p>about very specific rules</p>
<p>and the way that certain words are spelled.</p>
<p>They tend to be challenging words.</p>
<p>So if people are tested</p>
<p>in terms of their performance on these types of exams,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re deprived of slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>they tend to perform very poorly.</p>
<p>So we can think of slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>as important for motor learning, motor skill learning,</p>
<p>and for the learning of specific details</p>
<p>about specific events.</p>
<p>And this turns out to be fundamentally important</p>
<p>because now we know that slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>is primarily in the early part of the night,</p>
<p>and motor learning is occurring primarily</p>
<p>early in the night,</p>
<p>and detail learning is occurring early in the night.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that are waking up</p>
<p>after only three, four hours of sleep,</p>
<p>this might be informative.</p>
<p>This might tell you a little something</p>
<p>about what you are able to learn and not able to learn</p>
<p>if that were to be the only sleep that you get,</p>
<p>although hopefully that&rsquo;s not the only sleep that you get.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re going to dive deep into how it is</p>
<p>that one can maximize motor learning</p>
<p>in order to extract, say, more detailed information</p>
<p>about coordinated movements</p>
<p>and how to make them faster or slower.</p>
<p>So that might be important for certain sports.</p>
<p>It might be almost certainly important for certain sports.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be important</p>
<p>for any kind of coordinated movement,</p>
<p>like, say, learning to play the piano,</p>
<p>or, for instance, how to learn synchronized movements</p>
<p>with somebody else.</p>
<p>So maybe, I mentioned the example of dance earlier.</p>
<p>If you, like me, a few years ago,</p>
<p>I set out to learn tango</p>
<p>because I have some Argentine relatives,</p>
<p>and I was abysmal.</p>
<p>I need to return to that at some point.</p>
<p>I was just abysmal.</p>
<p>And one of the worst things</p>
<p>about being abysmal and learning dance</p>
<p>is that somebody else has to suffer the consequences also.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe in the month on neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explore that again as a self-experimentation.</p>
<p>But the key things to know are slow-wave sleep&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in motor learning and detailed learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no acetylcholine around at that time,</p>
<p>has this big amplitude activity</p>
<p>sweeping throughout the brain,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s the release of these neuromodulators,</p>
<p>norepinephrine and serotonin.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s all happening early in the night.</p>
<p>So, athletes, people that are concerned about performance,</p>
<p>if you happen to wake up after just a couple hours</p>
<p>of three, four hours of sleep</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re excited about a competition the next day,</p>
<p>presumably, if you&rsquo;ve already trained the skills</p>
<p>that you need for the event,</p>
<p>you should be fine to engage in that particular activity.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s always going to be better</p>
<p>to get a full night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>And a full night&rsquo;s sleep for you is six hours,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always going to be better to get more sleep</p>
<p>than it is to get less.</p>
<p>However, I think some people get a little bit</p>
<p>overly concerned that if they didn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>their full night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>before some sort of physical event,</p>
<p>that their performance is going to plummet.</p>
<p>Presumably, if you&rsquo;ve already learned what you need to do</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s stored in your neural circuits,</p>
<p>and you know how to make those coordinated movements,</p>
<p>what the literature on slow-wave sleep suggests</p>
<p>is that you would be replenished,</p>
<p>that the motor learning and the recovery from exercise</p>
<p>is going to happen early in the night.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll just pause there and kind of shelve that</p>
<p>for a moment, and then we&rsquo;re going to come back to it.</p>
<p>But I want to talk about REM sleep,</p>
<p>or rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to have more of it.</p>
<p>A larger percentage of these 90-minute sleep cycles</p>
<p>is going to be comprised of REM sleep</p>
<p>as you get toward morning.</p>
<p>REM sleep is fascinating.</p>
<p>It was discovered in the 50s</p>
<p>when a sleep laboratory in Chicago,</p>
<p>the researchers observed that people&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>were moving under their eyelids.</p>
<p>Now, something very important that we&rsquo;re going to address</p>
<p>when we talk about trauma later</p>
<p>is that the eye movements are not just side to side,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very erratic in all different directions.</p>
<p>One thing that I don&rsquo;t think anyone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone really talk about publicly</p>
<p>is why eye movements during sleep, right?</p>
<p>Eyes are closed, and sometimes people&rsquo;s eyelids</p>
<p>will be a little bit open and their eyes are darting around,</p>
<p>especially in little kids.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suggest you do this, I&rsquo;m not even sure it&rsquo;s ethical,</p>
<p>but it has been done where you pull back the eyelids</p>
<p>of a kid while they&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>and their eyes are kind of darting all over the place.</p>
<p>I think people do this to their passed out friends</p>
<p>at parties and things like that.</p>
<p>So again, I don&rsquo;t suggest you do it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m telling you it because it&rsquo;s been done before</p>
<p>and therefore you don&rsquo;t have to do it again.</p>
<p>But rapid eye movement sleep is fascinating</p>
<p>and occurs because there are connections</p>
<p>between the brainstem, an area called the pons,</p>
<p>and areas of the thalamus and the top of the brainstem</p>
<p>that are involved in generating movements</p>
<p>in different directions, sometimes called saccades,</p>
<p>although sometimes during rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just rapid, it&rsquo;s kind of a jittery</p>
<p>side to side thing, and then the eyeballs kind of roll.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really pretty creepy to look at if you see.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening there is the circuitry</p>
<p>that is involved in conscious eye movements</p>
<p>is kind of going haywire, but it&rsquo;s not haywire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these waves of activity from the brainstem</p>
<p>up to the so-called thalamus,</p>
<p>which is an area that filter sensory information</p>
<p>and then up to the cortex.</p>
<p>And the cortex, of course,</p>
<p>is involved in conscious perceptions.</p>
<p>So in rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>there are a couple things that are happening</p>
<p>besides rapid eye movements.</p>
<p>The main ones are that they&rsquo;re, I should say,</p>
<p>in contrast to slow wave sleep, in REM sleep,</p>
<p>serotonin is essentially absent, okay?</p>
<p>So this molecule, this neuromodulator</p>
<p>that tends to create the feeling of bliss and wellbeing</p>
<p>and just calm placidity is absent, all right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>In addition to that, norepinephrine,</p>
<p>this molecule that&rsquo;s involved in movement and alertness</p>
<p>is absolutely absent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably one of the few times in our life</p>
<p>that epinephrine is essentially at zero activity</p>
<p>within our system.</p>
<p>And that has a number of very important implications</p>
<p>for the sorts of dreaming that occur during REM sleep</p>
<p>and the sorts of learning that can occur</p>
<p>in REM sleep and unlearning.</p>
<p>First of all, in REM sleep, we are paralyzed.</p>
<p>We are experiencing what&rsquo;s called atonia,</p>
<p>which just means that we&rsquo;re completely laid out</p>
<p>and paralyzed.</p>
<p>We also tend to experience whatever it is</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re dreaming about as a kind of hallucination</p>
<p>or a hallucinatory activity.</p>
<p>Long ago, I looked into hallucinations and dreaming.</p>
<p>I was just fascinated by this in high school.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some great books on this</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in exploring the relationship</p>
<p>between hallucinations and dreaming.</p>
<p>The most famous of which are from a guy,</p>
<p>researcher at Harvard, Alan Hobson,</p>
<p>wrote a book called Dream Drugstore</p>
<p>and talked all about the similarities</p>
<p>between drugs that induce hallucinations</p>
<p>and dreaming in REM.</p>
<p>So you can explore that if you like.</p>
<p>So in REM, our eyes are moving,</p>
<p>but the rest of our body is paralyzed</p>
<p>and we are hallucinating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no epinephrine around.</p>
<p>Epinephrine doesn&rsquo;t just create a desire</p>
<p>to move and alertness.</p>
<p>It is also the chemical signature of fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s released from our adrenal glands</p>
<p>when we experience something that&rsquo;s fearful or alerting.</p>
<p>So if a car suddenly screeches in front of us</p>
<p>or we get a troubling text message,</p>
<p>adrenaline is deployed into our system.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is epinephrine.</p>
<p>Those are equivalent molecules.</p>
<p>And epinephrine isn&rsquo;t just released from our adrenals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also released within our brain.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this weird stage of our life</p>
<p>that happens more toward morning that we call REM sleep,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re hallucinating</p>
<p>and having these outrageous experiences in our mind,</p>
<p>but the chemical that&rsquo;s associated with fear and panic</p>
<p>and anxiety is not available to us.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be very important.</p>
<p>And you can imagine why that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important because it allows us to experience things,</p>
<p>both replay of things that did occur,</p>
<p>as well as elaborate contortions</p>
<p>of things that didn&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p>And it allows us to experience those</p>
<p>in the absence of fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>And that, it turns out,</p>
<p>is very important for adjusting our emotional relationship</p>
<p>to challenging things that happened to us</p>
<p>while we were awake.</p>
<p>Those challenging things can sometimes be in the form</p>
<p>of social anxiety or just having been working very hard</p>
<p>or concern about an upcoming event.</p>
<p>Or sometimes people report, for instance,</p>
<p>dreams where they find themselves late to an exam</p>
<p>or naked in public or in some sort of situation</p>
<p>that would be very troubling to them.</p>
<p>And that almost certainly occurs during REM sleep.</p>
<p>So we have this incredible period of sleep</p>
<p>in which our experience of emotionally laden events</p>
<p>is dissociated, it&rsquo;s chemically blocked</p>
<p>from us having the actual emotion.</p>
<p>Now, probably immediately some of you are thinking,</p>
<p>well, what about nightmares?</p>
<p>I have nightmares and those carry a lot of emotion</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll wake up in a panic.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider each of those two things separately</p>
<p>because they are important in understanding REM sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good chance that nightmares are occurring</p>
<p>during slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>There are actually some drugs</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t suggest people take,</p>
<p>in fact, so much so I&rsquo;m not going to mention them,</p>
<p>that give people very kind of scary or eerie dreams</p>
<p>and this kind of feeling that things are pursuing them</p>
<p>or that they can&rsquo;t move when they are being chased.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually a common dream that I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>is I guess it&rsquo;s more or less a nightmare.</p>
<p>The feeling that one is paralyzed and can&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>and is being chased.</p>
<p>A lot of people have said, oh, that must be in REM sleep</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re paralyzed and so you&rsquo;re dreaming</p>
<p>about being paralyzed and you can&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably false.</p>
<p>The research says that because norepinephrine</p>
<p>is absent during REM sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very unlikely that you can have</p>
<p>these intense fearful memories.</p>
<p>So those are probably occurring in slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>Although there might be instances</p>
<p>where people have nightmares in REM sleep.</p>
<p>The other thing is some people experience,</p>
<p>certainly I&rsquo;ve had this experience of waking up</p>
<p>and feeling very stressed about whatever it was</p>
<p>that I happen to be thinking about</p>
<p>or dreaming about in the moments before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an interesting case of an invasion</p>
<p>of the dream state into the waking state.</p>
<p>And the moment you wake up, epinephrine is available.</p>
<p>So the research on this isn&rsquo;t fully crystallized,</p>
<p>but most of it points in the direction</p>
<p>of the experience of waking up and feeling very panicked.</p>
<p>Maybe, I want to highlight may,</p>
<p>but maybe that you were experiencing something</p>
<p>that was troubling in the daytime.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re repeating that experience in your sleep.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is not available</p>
<p>and therefore the brain circuits associated</p>
<p>with fear and anxiety are shut off.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re able to process those events.</p>
<p>And then suddenly you wake up</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a surge of adrenaline, of epinephrine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now coupled to that experience.</p>
<p>So nightmares very likely in slow wave sleep</p>
<p>and that kind of panic on waking from something</p>
<p>very likely to be an invasion of the thoughts</p>
<p>and ideas, however distorted in REM sleep</p>
<p>invading the waking state.</p>
<p>In fact, that brings to mind something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve mentioned once before,</p>
<p>but I want to mention again, this atonia,</p>
<p>this paralysis that we experienced during sleep</p>
<p>can invade the waking state.</p>
<p>Many people report the experience of waking up</p>
<p>and being paralyzed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re legitimately waking up, it&rsquo;s not a dream.</p>
<p>Waking up and being paralyzed and it is terrifying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this happen before.</p>
<p>It is, I can tell you terrifying to be wide awake.</p>
<p>And as far as I could tell fully conscious,</p>
<p>but unable to move.</p>
<p>And then generally you can jolt yourself out of it</p>
<p>in a few seconds, but it is quite frightening.</p>
<p>Now, some people actually experience waking up</p>
<p>being fully paralyzed and hallucinating.</p>
<p>And there is a theory in the academic</p>
<p>and scientific community at least</p>
<p>that what people report as alien abductions</p>
<p>have a certain number of core characteristics</p>
<p>that map quite closely yearly similarly</p>
<p>to these experiences.</p>
<p>A lot of reports of alien abduction</p>
<p>involve people being unable to move,</p>
<p>seeing particular faces, hallucinating extensively,</p>
<p>feeling like their body is floating</p>
<p>or they were transported.</p>
<p>This is very similar to the experience</p>
<p>of invasion of atonia into the waking state.</p>
<p>Waking up and still being paralyzed</p>
<p>as well as the hallucinations that are characteristic</p>
<p>of dreaming in REM sleep.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that people&rsquo;s alien abductions</p>
<p>were not legitimate alien abductions.</p>
<p>How could I?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>And if I was there, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>because that would make me an alien</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to know.</p>
<p>But it is quite possible</p>
<p>that people are experiencing these things</p>
<p>and they are an invasion of the sleep state</p>
<p>into the waking state.</p>
<p>And they can last several minutes or longer.</p>
<p>And because in dreams, space and time are distorted.</p>
<p>Our perception of these events could be</p>
<p>that they lasted many hours</p>
<p>and we can really feel as if they lasted many hours</p>
<p>when in fact they took only moments.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to return to distortion</p>
<p>of space and time in a little bit.</p>
<p>So to just recap where we&rsquo;ve gone so far,</p>
<p>slow wave sleep early in the night,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been shown to be important for motor learning</p>
<p>and for detail learning.</p>
<p>REM sleep has a certain dream component</p>
<p>when which there&rsquo;s no epinephrine.</p>
<p>Therefore we can&rsquo;t experience anxiety.</p>
<p>We are paralyzed.</p>
<p>Those dreams tend to be really vivid</p>
<p>and have a lot of detail to them.</p>
<p>And yet in REM sleep, what&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>is that the sorts of learning that happen in REM sleep</p>
<p>are not motor events.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about unlearning of emotional events.</p>
<p>And now we know why,</p>
<p>because the chemicals available</p>
<p>for really feeling those emotions are not present.</p>
<p>Now that has very important implications.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s address those implications from two sides.</p>
<p>First of all, we should ask what happens</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t get enough REM sleep?</p>
<p>And a scenario that happens a lot</p>
<p>where people don&rsquo;t get enough REM sleep is the following.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just explain the one that I&rsquo;m familiar with</p>
<p>because it happens to me a lot,</p>
<p>although I figured out ways to adjust.</p>
<p>I go to sleep around 10, 30, 11 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>I fall asleep very easily.</p>
<p>And then I wake up around three or 4 a.m.</p>
<p>I now know to use a NSDR, a non-sleep deep rest protocol.</p>
<p>And that allows me to fall back asleep.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s called non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really allows me to relax my body and brain.</p>
<p>And I tend to fall back asleep and sleep till about 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>during which time I get a lot of REM sleep.</p>
<p>And I know this because I&rsquo;ve measured it.</p>
<p>And I know this because my dreams tend to be very intense</p>
<p>of the sort that we know is typical of REM sleep.</p>
<p>In this scenario,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten my slow wave sleep early in the night</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve got my REM sleep toward morning.</p>
<p>However, there are times when I don&rsquo;t go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Maybe I have a flight to catch, that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ve got a lot on my mind</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t go back to sleep.</p>
<p>I can tell you, and you&rsquo;ve probably experienced,</p>
<p>that the lack of REM sleep</p>
<p>tends to make people emotionally irritable.</p>
<p>It tends to make us feel</p>
<p>as if the little things are the big things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very clear from laboratory studies</p>
<p>where people have been deprived selectively of REM sleep</p>
<p>that our emotionality tends to get a little bit unhinged</p>
<p>and we tend to catastrophize small things.</p>
<p>We tend to feel like the world is really daunting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re never going to move forward in the ways that we want.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t unlearn the emotional components</p>
<p>of whatever it is that&rsquo;s been happening,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not traumatic.</p>
<p>The other thing that happens in REM sleep</p>
<p>is a replay of certain types of spatial information</p>
<p>about where we were and why we were in those places.</p>
<p>And this maps to some beautiful data</p>
<p>and studies that were initiated</p>
<p>by a guy named Matt Wilson at MIT years ago,</p>
<p>showing that in rodents,</p>
<p>and it turns out in non-human primates and in humans,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a replay of spatial information during REM sleep</p>
<p>that almost precisely maps to the activity</p>
<p>that we experienced during the day</p>
<p>as we move from one place to another.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a common world scenario.</p>
<p>You go to a new place,</p>
<p>you navigate through that city or that environment.</p>
<p>This place doesn&rsquo;t have to be at the scale of a city.</p>
<p>It can be a new building,</p>
<p>could be finding particular rooms, new social interaction.</p>
<p>You experience that, and if it&rsquo;s important enough,</p>
<p>that becomes solidified a few days later,</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t forget it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s unimportant, you&rsquo;ll probably forget it.</p>
<p>During REM sleep, there&rsquo;s a literal replay</p>
<p>of the exact firing of the neurons that occurred</p>
<p>while you were navigating that same city</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building earlier.</p>
<p>So REM sleep seems to be involved in the generation</p>
<p>of this detailed spatial information.</p>
<p>But what is it that&rsquo;s actually happening in REM sleep?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this uncoupling of emotion,</p>
<p>but most of all, what&rsquo;s happening in REM sleep</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re forming a relationship</p>
<p>with particular rules or algorithms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to figure out,</p>
<p>based on all the experience that we had during the day,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s important that we avoid certain people</p>
<p>or that we approach certain people,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s important that when we enter a building</p>
<p>that we go into the elevator and turn left</p>
<p>where the bathroom is, for instance,</p>
<p>these general themes of things and locations</p>
<p>and how they fit together, and that has a word.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called meaning.</p>
<p>During our day, we&rsquo;re experiencing all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Meaning is how we each individually piece together</p>
<p>the relevance of one thing to the next, right?</p>
<p>So if I suddenly told you that this pen</p>
<p>was downloading all the information to my brain</p>
<p>that was important to deliver this information,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably think I was a pretty strange character</p>
<p>because typically we don&rsquo;t think of pens</p>
<p>as downloading information into brains,</p>
<p>but if I told you that I was getting information</p>
<p>from my computer that was allowing me to say things to you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d say, well, that&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because we have a clear</p>
<p>and agreed upon association with computers</p>
<p>and information and memory,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have that same association with pens.</p>
<p>You might say, well, duh,</p>
<p>but something in our brain</p>
<p>needs to solidify those relationships</p>
<p>and make sure that certain relationships don&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>and it appears that REM sleep is important for that</p>
<p>because when you deprive yourself or people of REM,</p>
<p>they start seeing odd associations.</p>
<p>They tend to lump or batch things.</p>
<p>I know this from my own experience.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve ever been sleep-deprived,</p>
<p>which unfortunately happens too often</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m terrible with deadlines,</p>
<p>pull an all-nighter,</p>
<p>the word the starts to look like it&rsquo;s spelled incorrectly,</p>
<p>and the is a very simple word to spell,</p>
<p>but things start to look a little distorted,</p>
<p>and we know that if people are deprived of REM sleep</p>
<p>for very long periods of time, they start hallucinating.</p>
<p>They literally start seeing relationships</p>
<p>and movement of objects that isn&rsquo;t happening,</p>
<p>and so REM sleep is really</p>
<p>where we establish the emotional load,</p>
<p>but where we also start discarding</p>
<p>of all the meanings that are irrelevant,</p>
<p>and if you think about emotionality,</p>
<p>a lot of over-emotionality or catastrophizing</p>
<p>is about seeing problems everywhere,</p>
<p>and you could imagine why that might occur</p>
<p>if you start linking the web</p>
<p>of your experience too extensively.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important in order to have healthy,</p>
<p>emotional, and cognitive functioning</p>
<p>that we have fairly narrow channels</p>
<p>between individual things.</p>
<p>If we see something on the news that&rsquo;s very troubling,</p>
<p>well, then it makes sense to be very troubled,</p>
<p>but if we&rsquo;re troubled by everything</p>
<p>and we start just saying everything is bothering me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m feeling highly irritable</p>
<p>and everything is just distorting and troubling me,</p>
<p>chances are we are not actively removing the meaning,</p>
<p>the connectivity between life experiences</p>
<p>as well as we could,</p>
<p>and that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep,</p>
<p>so REM sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity</p>
<p>to eliminate the meanings that don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that it exacerbates the meanings that do matter,</p>
<p>but it eliminates the meanings that don&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>and that bears a striking resemblance</p>
<p>to what happens early in development.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a discussion about early in development,</p>
<p>but early in development,</p>
<p>the reason a baby can&rsquo;t generate coordinated movements</p>
<p>and the reason why children can get very emotional</p>
<p>about what seems like trivial events</p>
<p>or what adults know to be trivial events,</p>
<p>like, oh, the ice cream shop is closed,</p>
<p>and then the kid just dissolves</p>
<p>into a puddle of tears,</p>
<p>and the parents go, okay, well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be open again another time.</p>
<p>Children, one of the reasons</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t generate coordinated movement</p>
<p>or place that event of the ice cream shop being closed</p>
<p>into a larger context</p>
<p>is because they have too much connectivity,</p>
<p>and much of the maturation of the brain and nervous system</p>
<p>that brings us to the point of being emotionally stable,</p>
<p>reasonable, rational human beings</p>
<p>is about elimination of connections between things,</p>
<p>so REM sleep seems to be where we uncouple</p>
<p>the potential for emotionality between various experiences,</p>
<p>and that brings us</p>
<p>to the absolutely fundamental relationship</p>
<p>and similarity of REM sleep</p>
<p>to some of the clinical practices</p>
<p>that have been designed to eliminate emotionality</p>
<p>and help people move through trauma</p>
<p>and other troubling experiences,</p>
<p>whether or not those troubling experiences</p>
<p>are a death in the family or of a close loved one,</p>
<p>something terrible that happened to you or somebody else,</p>
<p>or an entire childhood,</p>
<p>or some event that in your mind and body</p>
<p>is felt as and experienced as bad, terrible, or concerning.</p>
<p>Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatments</p>
<p>such as EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing,</p>
<p>or ketamine treatment for trauma,</p>
<p>something that recently became legal</p>
<p>and is in fairly widespread clinical use.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine</p>
<p>at kind of a core level</p>
<p>bear very similar features to REM sleep.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about EMDR first.</p>
<p>EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing,</p>
<p>is something that was developed</p>
<p>by a psychologist, Francine Shapiro.</p>
<p>She actually was in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>And the story goes that she was walking,</p>
<p>not so incidentally,</p>
<p>in the trees and forests behind Stanford,</p>
<p>and she was recalling a troubling event in her own mind.</p>
<p>So this would be from her own life.</p>
<p>And she realized that as she was walking,</p>
<p>the emotional load of that experience</p>
<p>was not as intense or severe.</p>
<p>She extrapolated from that experience</p>
<p>of walking and not feeling as stressed</p>
<p>about the stressful event,</p>
<p>to a practice that she put into work</p>
<p>with her clients, with her patients,</p>
<p>and that now has become fairly widespread.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the few behavior treatments</p>
<p>that are approved by the American Psychological Association</p>
<p>for the Treatment of Trauma.</p>
<p>What she had her clients and patients do</p>
<p>was move their eyes from side to side</p>
<p>while recounting some traumatic or troubling event.</p>
<p>Now, this was, of course, in the clinic.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m guessing that she removed the walking component</p>
<p>and just took the eye movement component to the clinic,</p>
<p>because while it would be nice to go on therapy sessions</p>
<p>with your therapist and take walks,</p>
<p>it has, there are certain boundaries to that,</p>
<p>such as confidentiality.</p>
<p>You know, if there are a lot of people around,</p>
<p>the person might not feel as open to discussing things,</p>
<p>or weather barriers and things like that.</p>
<p>You know, if it&rsquo;s raining or hailing outside,</p>
<p>it gets tough to do.</p>
<p>Why eye movements?</p>
<p>Well, she never really said why eye movements,</p>
<p>but soon I&rsquo;ll tell you why the decision</p>
<p>to select these lateralized eye movements</p>
<p>for the work in the clinic was the right one.</p>
<p>So these eye movements, they look silly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do them because that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>They look silly, but they basically involve</p>
<p>sitting in a chair and moving one&rsquo;s eyes from side to side,</p>
<p>not while talking, but, you know, for me, you know,</p>
<p>and then recounting the event.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sometimes talking while moving the eyes,</p>
<p>but usually it was moving the eyes from side to side</p>
<p>for 30, 60 seconds,</p>
<p>then describing this challenging procedure.</p>
<p>Now, as a vision scientist who also works on stress,</p>
<p>when I first heard this, I thought it was crazy, frankly.</p>
<p>People would ask me about EMDR,</p>
<p>and I just thought, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I went and looked up some of the theories</p>
<p>about why EMDR might work,</p>
<p>and there were a bunch of theories.</p>
<p>Oh, it mimics the eye movements during REM sleep.</p>
<p>That was one.</p>
<p>Turns out that&rsquo;s not true, and I&rsquo;ll explain why.</p>
<p>The other one was, oh, it synchronizes the activity</p>
<p>on the two sides of the brain.</p>
<p>Well, sort of.</p>
<p>I mean, when you look into both sides</p>
<p>of the binocular visual field,</p>
<p>you activate the visual cortex,</p>
<p>but this whole idea of synchrony</p>
<p>between the two sides of the brain</p>
<p>is something that I think modern neuroscience</p>
<p>is starting to, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>gently or not so gently move away</p>
<p>from this whole left brain business.</p>
<p>It turns out, however,</p>
<p>that eye movements of the sort that I just did</p>
<p>and that Francine Shapiro took from this walk experience</p>
<p>and brought to her clients in the clinic</p>
<p>are the sorts of eye movements that you generate</p>
<p>whenever you&rsquo;re moving through space,</p>
<p>when you are self-generating that movement.</p>
<p>So not so much when you&rsquo;re driving a car,</p>
<p>but certainly if you were riding a bicycle</p>
<p>or you were walking or you were running,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t realize it,</p>
<p>but you have these reflexive subconscious eye movements</p>
<p>that go from side to side,</p>
<p>and they are associated with the motor system.</p>
<p>So when you move forward, your eyes go like this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been a number of studies</p>
<p>showing that these lateralized eye movements</p>
<p>helped people move through</p>
<p>or dissociate the emotional experience</p>
<p>of particular traumas with those experiences</p>
<p>such that they could recall those experiences</p>
<p>after the treatment and not feel stressed about them</p>
<p>or they didn&rsquo;t report them as traumatic any longer.</p>
<p>Now, the success rate wasn&rsquo;t 100%,</p>
<p>but they were statistically significant</p>
<p>in a number of studies.</p>
<p>And yet there are still some critics of EMDR.</p>
<p>And frankly, for a long time,</p>
<p>I still thought, well, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>this just seems like kind of a hack.</p>
<p>It just seems like kind of a,</p>
<p>this is something for which we don&rsquo;t know the mechanism</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>But in the last five years,</p>
<p>there have been no fewer than five,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a sixth on the way,</p>
<p>high-quality peer-reviewed manuscripts</p>
<p>published in Journal of Neuroscience,</p>
<p>Neuron, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,</p>
<p>Nature, excellent journal.</p>
<p>These are very stringent journals and papers</p>
<p>showing that lateralized eye movements</p>
<p>of the sort that I just did,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re just listening to this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just sweeping, moving the eyes from side to side</p>
<p>with eyes open, that those eye movements,</p>
<p>but not vertical eye movements,</p>
<p>suppress the activity of the amygdala,</p>
<p>which is this brain region that is involved</p>
<p>in threat detection, stress, anxiety, and fear.</p>
<p>There are some forms of fear</p>
<p>that are not amygdala-dependent,</p>
<p>but the amygdala, it&rsquo;s not a fear center,</p>
<p>but it is critical for the fear response</p>
<p>and for the experience of anxiety.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a clinical tool now</p>
<p>that indeed shows a lot of success</p>
<p>in a good number of people</p>
<p>where eye movements from side to side</p>
<p>are suppressing the amygdala,</p>
<p>and the general theme is to use those eye movements</p>
<p>to suppress the fear response,</p>
<p>and then to recount or repeat the experience,</p>
<p>and over time, uncouple the heavy emotional load,</p>
<p>the sadness, the depression, the anxiety, the fear,</p>
<p>from whatever it was that happened that was traumatic.</p>
<p>This is important to understand</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d love to be able to tell somebody</p>
<p>who had a traumatic experience</p>
<p>that they would forget that experience,</p>
<p>but the truth is you never forget the traumatic experience.</p>
<p>What you do is you remove the emotional load.</p>
<p>Eventually, it really does lose its potency.</p>
<p>The emotional potency is alleviated.</p>
<p>Now, EMDR, I should just mention,</p>
<p>tends to be most successful for single event</p>
<p>or very specific kinds of trauma that happen over and over,</p>
<p>as opposed to, say, an entire childhood or an entire divorce.</p>
<p>It tends to be most effective</p>
<p>for single event kinds of things,</p>
<p>car crashes, et cetera,</p>
<p>where people can really recall the events</p>
<p>in quite a lot of detail.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not for everybody, and it should be done,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s going to be done for trauma,</p>
<p>it should be done in a clinical setting</p>
<p>with somebody who&rsquo;s certified to do this,</p>
<p>but that bears a lot of resemblance to REM sleep, right?</p>
<p>This experience in our sleep where our eyes are moving,</p>
<p>although in a different way,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have the chemical, epinephrine,</p>
<p>in order to generate the fear response,</p>
<p>and yet we&rsquo;re remembering the event</p>
<p>from the previous day or days.</p>
<p>Sometimes in REM sleep,</p>
<p>we think about things that happened a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And then now there&rsquo;s this new treatment,</p>
<p>this chemical treatment with the drug ketamine,</p>
<p>which also bears a lot of resemblance</p>
<p>to the sorts of things that happen in REM sleep.</p>
<p>Ketamine is getting a lot of attention now,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of people</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t realize what ketamine is.</p>
<p>Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.</p>
<p>It is remarkably similar to the drug called PCP,</p>
<p>which is certainly a hazardous drug for people to use.</p>
<p>Ketamine and PCP both function to disrupt the activity</p>
<p>of a particular receptor in the brain</p>
<p>called the NMDA receptor, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.</p>
<p>This is a receptor that&rsquo;s in the surface of neurons</p>
<p>or on the surface of neurons</p>
<p>for which most of the time it&rsquo;s not active.</p>
<p>But when something very extreme happens,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of activity in the neural pathway</p>
<p>that impinges on that receptor,</p>
<p>it opens and it allows the entry of molecules, ions,</p>
<p>that trigger a cellular process</p>
<p>that we call long-term potentiation.</p>
<p>And long-term potentiation translates</p>
<p>to a change in connectivity so that later</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need that intense event</p>
<p>for the neuron to become active again.</p>
<p>Let me clarify a little bit of this.</p>
<p>The NMDA receptor is gated by intense experience.</p>
<p>One way you can think about this</p>
<p>is typically I walk in my home,</p>
<p>I might make some food and sit down at my kitchen table,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think anything about explosions.</p>
<p>But were I to come home one night,</p>
<p>sit down to a bowl of chicken soup,</p>
<p>and there was a massive explosion,</p>
<p>the neurons that are associated with chicken soup</p>
<p>in my kitchen table would be active in a way</p>
<p>that was different than they were previously,</p>
<p>and would be coupled to this experience of explosions</p>
<p>such that the next time and perhaps every other time</p>
<p>that I go to sit down at the kitchen table,</p>
<p>no matter how rational I am</p>
<p>about the origins of that explosion,</p>
<p>maybe it was a gas truck that was down the road</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no reason to think it&rsquo;s there today,</p>
<p>but I would have the same experience.</p>
<p>Those neurons would become active</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d get an increase in heart rate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d get an increase in sweating, et cetera.</p>
<p>Ketamine blocks this NMDA receptor</p>
<p>and prevents that crossover</p>
<p>and the addition of meaning to the kitchen table,</p>
<p>kitchen soup, excuse me,</p>
<p>chicken soup explosion experience.</p>
<p>So how is ketamine being used?</p>
<p>Ketamine is being used to prevent learning of emotions</p>
<p>very soon after trauma.</p>
<p>So ketamine is being stocked</p>
<p>in a number of different emergency rooms</p>
<p>if people are brought in quickly,</p>
<p>and these are hard to describe even,</p>
<p>but a horrible experience of somebody seeing a loved one</p>
<p>next to them killed in a car accident</p>
<p>and they were driving that car.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t for everybody, certainly,</p>
<p>and you need to talk to your physician,</p>
<p>but ketamine is being used</p>
<p>so they might infuse somebody with ketamine</p>
<p>so that their emotion can still occur,</p>
<p>but that the plasticity,</p>
<p>the change in the wiring of their brain</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t allow that intense emotion</p>
<p>to be attached to the experience.</p>
<p>Now, immediately, you can imagine</p>
<p>the sort of ethical implications of this, right?</p>
<p>Because certain emotions need to be coupled to experiences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that people should be using ketamine</p>
<p>or shouldn&rsquo;t be using ketamine,</p>
<p>certainly not recreationally, it&rsquo;s quite dangerous.</p>
<p>It can be lethal, and like PCP,</p>
<p>it can cause pretty dramatic changes</p>
<p>in perception and behavior,</p>
<p>but in the clinical setting,</p>
<p>the basis of ketamine-assisted therapies</p>
<p>is really to remove emotion,</p>
<p>and I think the way I&rsquo;ve been hearing about it</p>
<p>talked about in the general public</p>
<p>is a lot of people think it&rsquo;s a little bit more</p>
<p>like the kind of psilocybin trials or the MDMA trials</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s about becoming more emotional</p>
<p>or getting in touch with a certain experience.</p>
<p>Ketamine is about becoming dissociative</p>
<p>or removed from the emotional component of the experience.</p>
<p>So now we have ketamine, which chemically blocks plasticity</p>
<p>and prevents the connection</p>
<p>between an emotion and an experience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pharmacologic intervention.</p>
<p>We have EMDR, which is this eye movement thing</p>
<p>that is designed to suppress the amygdala</p>
<p>and is designed to remove emotionality</p>
<p>while somebody recounts an experience,</p>
<p>and we have REM sleep where the chemical epinephrine</p>
<p>that allows for signaling of intense emotion</p>
<p>and the experience of a tense emotion</p>
<p>in the brain and body is not allowed.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re starting to see a organizational logic,</p>
<p>which is that a certain component of our sleeping life</p>
<p>is acting like therapy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what REM sleep is about.</p>
<p>So we should really think about REM sleep</p>
<p>and slow wave sleep as both critical.</p>
<p>Slow wave sleep for motor learning and detailed learning,</p>
<p>REM sleep for attaching of emotions</p>
<p>to particular experiences,</p>
<p>and then for making sure that the emotions</p>
<p>are not attached to the wrong experiences</p>
<p>and for unlearning emotional responses</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re too intense or severe.</p>
<p>And this all speaks to the great importance</p>
<p>of mastering one&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>something that we talked about in episode two of the podcast</p>
<p>and making sure that if life has disruptive events,</p>
<p>either due to travel or stress or changes in school</p>
<p>or food schedule,</p>
<p>something that we talked about in episodes three and four,</p>
<p>that one can still grab a hold and manage one&rsquo;s sleep life</p>
<p>because fundamentally the unlearning of emotions</p>
<p>that are troubling to us</p>
<p>is what allows us to move forward in life.</p>
<p>And indeed the REM deprivation studies</p>
<p>show that people become hyper-emotional,</p>
<p>they start to catastrophize.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no surprise therefore</p>
<p>that sleep disturbances correlate</p>
<p>with so many emotional and psychological disturbances.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, by now it should just be obvious</p>
<p>why that will be the case.</p>
<p>In fact, the other day I was in a discussion</p>
<p>with a colleague of mine who&rsquo;s down in Australia,</p>
<p>Dr. Sarah McKay, I&rsquo;ve known her for two decades now</p>
<p>from the time she was at Oxford.</p>
<p>And Sarah studies, among other things,</p>
<p>menopause in the brain.</p>
<p>And she was saying that a lot of the emotional effects</p>
<p>of menopause actually are not directly related</p>
<p>to the hormones.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been some really nice studies</p>
<p>showing that the disruptions in temperature regulation</p>
<p>and menopause mapped to changes in sleep regulation</p>
<p>that then impact emotionality</p>
<p>and an inability to correctly adjust the circuits</p>
<p>related to emotionality.</p>
<p>And I encourage you to look at her work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll probably have her as a guest on the podcast</p>
<p>at some point in the future</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s so knowledgeable about those sorts of issues</p>
<p>as well as issues related to testosterone</p>
<p>and in people with all sorts</p>
<p>of different chromosomal backgrounds.</p>
<p>So sleep deprivation isn&rsquo;t just deprivation of energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just deprivation of immune function.</p>
<p>It is deprivation of self-induced therapy</p>
<p>every time we go to sleep, okay?</p>
<p>So these things like EMDR and ketamine therapies</p>
<p>are in-clinic therapies, but REM sleep is the one</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re giving yourself every night when you go to sleep</p>
<p>which raises, I think, the other important question</p>
<p>which is how to get and how to know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting the appropriate amount</p>
<p>of REM sleep and slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll talk about next.</p>
<p>So how should one go about getting the appropriate amount</p>
<p>of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep</p>
<p>and knowing that you&rsquo;re getting the right amount?</p>
<p>Well, short of hooking yourself up to an EEG,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be tough to get exact measurements</p>
<p>of brain states from night to night.</p>
<p>Some people nowadays are using things like the Oura Ring</p>
<p>or a Whoop band or some other device</p>
<p>to measure the quality and depth</p>
<p>and duration of their sleep.</p>
<p>And for many people, those devices can be quite useful.</p>
<p>Some people are only gauging their sleep</p>
<p>by way of whether or not they feel rested,</p>
<p>whether or not they feel like they&rsquo;re learning</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting better or not.</p>
<p>There are some things that one can really do.</p>
<p>And the first one might surprise you</p>
<p>in light of everything I&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>and probably everything you&rsquo;ve heard about sleep.</p>
<p>There was a study done by a Harvard undergraduate</p>
<p>Emily Hoagland who was in Robert Strickgold&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>And that study explored how variations</p>
<p>in total sleep time related to learning</p>
<p>as compared to total sleep time itself.</p>
<p>And to summarize the study,</p>
<p>what they found was that it was more important</p>
<p>to have a regular amount of sleep each night</p>
<p>as opposed to the total duration.</p>
<p>In other words, and what they showed</p>
<p>was that improvements in learning</p>
<p>or deficits in learning were more related</p>
<p>to whether or not you got six hours, six hours,</p>
<p>five hours, six hours.</p>
<p>That was better than if somebody got, for instance,</p>
<p>six hours, 10 hours, seven hours, four or five hours.</p>
<p>So you might say, well, that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>because I thought we&rsquo;re just all supposed to get more sleep</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s more REM towards morning.</p>
<p>It turns out that for sake of learning new information</p>
<p>and performance on exams in particular,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what was measured.</p>
<p>Limiting the variation in the amount of your sleep</p>
<p>is at least as important and perhaps more important</p>
<p>than just getting more sleep overall.</p>
<p>And I think this will bring people great relief,</p>
<p>many people great relief who are struggling</p>
<p>to quote unquote, get enough sleep.</p>
<p>Remember a few episodes ago,</p>
<p>I talked about the difference between fatigue and insomnia.</p>
<p>Fatigue is tends to be when we are tired,</p>
<p>insomnia tends to lead to a sleepiness during the day</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re falling asleep and you don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want either of those things really.</p>
<p>But I found it striking that the data from this study</p>
<p>really point to the fact that consistently getting</p>
<p>about the same amount of sleep</p>
<p>is better than just getting more sleep.</p>
<p>And I think nowadays so many people are just aiming</p>
<p>for more sleep and they&rsquo;re rather troubled about the fact</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re only getting five hours</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re only getting six hours in some cases.</p>
<p>It may be the case that they are sleep deprived</p>
<p>and they need more sleep,</p>
<p>but some people just have a lower sleep need.</p>
<p>And I find great relief personally in the fact</p>
<p>that consistently getting for me about six hours</p>
<p>or six and a half hours is going to be more beneficial</p>
<p>than constantly striving for eight or nine</p>
<p>and finding that some nights I&rsquo;m getting five</p>
<p>and sometimes I&rsquo;m getting nine and varying around the mean.</p>
<p>As I recall, and I think I&rsquo;m going to get this</p>
<p>precisely right, but if not, I know that I&rsquo;m at least close</p>
<p>for every hour variation in sleep,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not I was more sleep</p>
<p>than one typically got,</p>
<p>there was a 17% reduction in performance</p>
<p>on this particular exam type.</p>
<p>And so this is powerful.</p>
<p>This means that we should strive</p>
<p>for a regular amount of sleep.</p>
<p>And for some of us, that means falling asleep</p>
<p>and waking up and going back to sleep.</p>
<p>For some people it means falling asleep</p>
<p>and waking up and not getting back to sleep.</p>
<p>Now, ideally you&rsquo;re getting the full compliment</p>
<p>of slow wave sleep early in night</p>
<p>and sleep toward morning, which is REM sleep,</p>
<p>which brings us to how to get more REM sleep.</p>
<p>Well, there are a couple of different ways,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s how to not get more REM sleep, all right?</p>
<p>First of all, drink a lot of fluid</p>
<p>right before going to sleep.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why we wake up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night to use the bathroom</p>
<p>is because when our bladder is full,</p>
<p>there is a neural connection,</p>
<p>literally a set of neurons and a nerve circuit</p>
<p>that goes to the brainstem that wakes us up.</p>
<p>And actually some people that I know</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t be mentioned,</p>
<p>actually use this to try and adjust for their jet lag</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re trying to stay awake.</p>
<p>Having to use the bathroom,</p>
<p>having to urinate is one of the most anxiety evoking</p>
<p>experiences anyone can have.</p>
<p>If you really have to go to the bathroom,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to fall asleep or stay asleep.</p>
<p>And bedwetting, which happens in kids very early on</p>
<p>is a failure of those circuits to mature until,</p>
<p>you know, I think we all assume that babies</p>
<p>are going to pee in their sleep,</p>
<p>but adults aren&rsquo;t supposed to do that.</p>
<p>And the circuits take some time to develop</p>
<p>and in some kids they develop a little bit later than others.</p>
<p>So having a full bladder is one way to disrupt your sleep.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to go to bed dehydrated, but that&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is evidence</p>
<p>that if you want to remember your dreams more</p>
<p>or remember more of your dreams,</p>
<p>there is a tool that you can use.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily recommend it,</p>
<p>which is to drink a bunch of water before you go to sleep.</p>
<p>And then what happens is you tend to break</p>
<p>in and out of REM sleep.</p>
<p>It tends to be fractured.</p>
<p>And with a sleep journal,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ve done these laboratory studies,</p>
<p>believe it or not, people will recall more of their dreams</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in this kind of semi-conscious state</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re constantly waking up throughout the night.</p>
<p>I suggest not having a full bladder before you go to sleep.</p>
<p>That one&rsquo;s kind of an obvious one, but nonetheless.</p>
<p>The other one is if you recall that during REM sleep,</p>
<p>we have a shift in neurotransmitters</p>
<p>such that we have less serotonin, right?</p>
<p>I just want to make sure I got that right.</p>
<p>Excuse me, less serotonin.</p>
<p>There are a lot of supplements out there</p>
<p>geared toward improving sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken some of them and I&rsquo;ve taken many of them,</p>
<p>if not all of them at this point,</p>
<p>so I could report back to you.</p>
<p>And I think I mentioned on a previous episode</p>
<p>that when I take tryptophan or anything</p>
<p>that contains 5-HTP, which is serotonin</p>
<p>or a precursor to serotonin,</p>
<p>serotonin is made from tryptophan,</p>
<p>I tend to fall very deeply asleep</p>
<p>and then wake up a few hours later.</p>
<p>And that makes sense now based on the fact</p>
<p>that you just don&rsquo;t want a lot of REM sleep early on.</p>
<p>What was probably happening</p>
<p>is that I was getting a lot of REM sleep early on</p>
<p>because low levels of serotonin</p>
<p>are typically associated with slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>and that comes early in the night.</p>
<p>So for some people, those supplements might work,</p>
<p>but beware serotonin supplements</p>
<p>could disrupt the timing of REM sleep and slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>And in my case, led to waking up</p>
<p>very shortly after going to sleep</p>
<p>and not being able to get back to sleep.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to increase your slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting, there are ways to do that.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful ways to increase slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>the percentage of slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>apparently without any disruption</p>
<p>to the other components of sleep and learning,</p>
<p>is to engage in resistance exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that resistance exercise</p>
<p>triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine pathways</p>
<p>that lend themselves to release of growth hormone,</p>
<p>which happens early in the night.</p>
<p>And resistance exercise, therefore,</p>
<p>can induce a greater percentage of slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be done very close to going to bedtime.</p>
<p>In fact, for some people,</p>
<p>the exercise could be disruptive</p>
<p>for reasons I&rsquo;ve talked about in previous episodes.</p>
<p>But resistance exercise, unlike aerobic exercise,</p>
<p>does seem to increase the amount of slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>which, as we know, is involved in motor learning</p>
<p>and the acquisition of fine detailed information,</p>
<p>not general rules</p>
<p>or the emotional components of experiences.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested in lucid dreaming</p>
<p>and would like to increase the amount of lucid dreaming</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re experiencing,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to track down that device</p>
<p>with the red light that I described at the beginning,</p>
<p>but there are a number of just simple zero technology tools</p>
<p>that one could use in principle.</p>
<p>One is to set a cue.</p>
<p>The way this works is you come up with a simple statement</p>
<p>about something that you&rsquo;d like to see</p>
<p>or experience later in dreams.</p>
<p>You can, for instance, write down something like,</p>
<p>I want to remember the red apple.</p>
<p>I know it sounds silly and trivial.</p>
<p>And you look at that,</p>
<p>you would probably want to write it down on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>You might even want to draw a red apple.</p>
<p>And then before you go to sleep, you would look at it.</p>
<p>And then you would just go to sleep.</p>
<p>There are some reports that doing that</p>
<p>for several days in a row can lead to a situation</p>
<p>in which you are suddenly in your dream</p>
<p>and you remember the red apple.</p>
<p>And that gives you a sort of tether to reality</p>
<p>between the dream state and reality</p>
<p>that allows you to navigate and shape</p>
<p>and kind of adjust your dreams.</p>
<p>Lucid dreaming does not have to be</p>
<p>or include the ability to alter features of the dream,</p>
<p>to be able to control things in the dream.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just the awareness that you are dreaming,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, some people enjoy lucid dreaming.</p>
<p>And then for people that have a lot of lucid dreams</p>
<p>that feel kind of overwhelmed by those,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to involve trying to embrace protocols</p>
<p>that can set the right duration of sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of literature, not a lot,</p>
<p>that shows that keeping the total amount of sleep per night</p>
<p>to say six hours, such that you begin sleep and end</p>
<p>at the beginning and end of one of these ultradian cycles</p>
<p>can be better than waking up</p>
<p>in the middle of one of these ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>So try and find the right amount of sleep that you need,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>And then try and get that consistently night to night.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a lucid dreamer and you don&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>then you may want to start to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re waking up at the end</p>
<p>of one of these ultradian cycles.</p>
<p>So in this case, it would be better to wake up</p>
<p>after six hours than after seven.</p>
<p>And if you did sleep longer than six hours,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;d want to get to seven and a half hours</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to reflect the end</p>
<p>of one of these 90 minute cycles</p>
<p>as opposed to waking up in the middle.</p>

<p>Alcohol and marijuana are well-known to induce states</p>
<p>that are pseudo sleep-like,</p>
<p>especially when people fall asleep</p>
<p>after having consumed alcohol or THC,</p>
<p>the active component,</p>
<p>one of the active components in marijuana.</p>
<p>Alcohol, THC, and most things like them,</p>
<p>meaning things that increase serotonin or GABA</p>
<p>are going to disrupt the pattern of sleep.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to disrupt the depth,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to disrupt the overall sequencing</p>
<p>of more slow-wave sleep early in the night</p>
<p>and more REM sleep later in the night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the reality.</p>
<p>There are some things that,</p>
<p>at least in a few studies that I could find,</p>
<p>seem to suggest that you could increase</p>
<p>the amount of slow-wave sleep using things like arginine,</p>
<p>the amino acid arginine,</p>
<p>although you really want to check,</p>
<p>arginine can have effects on heart, et cetera,</p>
<p>has other effects.</p>
<p>But alcohol, THC,</p>
<p>not going to be great for sleep and depth of sleep.</p>
<p>You might feel like you can fall asleep faster,</p>
<p>but the sleep that you&rsquo;re accessing</p>
<p>really isn&rsquo;t the kind of deep restorative sleep</p>
<p>that you should be getting.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if that&rsquo;s what you need in order to sleep,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s within your protocol,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve said here before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting people take anything,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a medical doctor,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a cop,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not trying to regulate anyone&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling you what the literature says.</p>
<p>Some of you may want to explore your dreams</p>
<p>and meaning of dreams, et cetera.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s not a lot of hard data</p>
<p>about how to do this,</p>
<p>but a lot of people report keeping a sleep journal</p>
<p>or a dream journal can be very useful.</p>
<p>So they mark when they think they fell asleep</p>
<p>the night before, when they woke up.</p>
<p>And if they wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>or early in the morning,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just write down what they can recall of their dreams.</p>
<p>And even if they recall nothing,</p>
<p>many people have the experience of mid morning</p>
<p>or later afternoon that suddenly comes to them</p>
<p>that they had a dream about something</p>
<p>and writing that down.</p>
<p>I kept a dream journal for a while.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really afford me much.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really learn anything</p>
<p>except that my dreams were very bizarre.</p>
<p>But there are some things that happen in dreams</p>
<p>that are associated with REM sleep</p>
<p>as compared to slow wave sleep,</p>
<p>which can tell you whether or not your dream</p>
<p>likely happened in REM sleep or slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>And the distinguishing feature it turns out</p>
<p>is something called theory of mind.</p>
<p>Theory of mind is actually an idea that was developed</p>
<p>for the study and assessment of autism.</p>
<p>And it was initially that phrase theory of mind</p>
<p>was brought about by Simon Baron-Cohen,</p>
<p>who is Sasha Baron-Cohen, the comedian&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>Simon Baron-Cohen is a psychologist</p>
<p>and to some extent a neuroscientist at Oxford.</p>
<p>And theory of mind tests are done on children.</p>
<p>And the theory of mind test is like the following.</p>
<p>A child is brought into a laboratory</p>
<p>and watches a video of a child playing with some sort of toy.</p>
<p>And then at the end of playing with that toy,</p>
<p>they put the toy in a drawer and they go away.</p>
<p>And then another child comes in and is looking around.</p>
<p>And then the experimenter asks the child</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in the experiment, the real child,</p>
<p>and says, you know, what does the child think?</p>
<p>You know, what are they feeling?</p>
<p>And most children of a particular age,</p>
<p>five or six or older will say,</p>
<p>oh, you know, he or she is confused.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know where the toy is.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;ll say something that implies</p>
<p>what we call theory of mind,</p>
<p>that they can put their ideas into,</p>
<p>and their mind into what the other child</p>
<p>is likely to be feeling or experiencing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s theory of mind.</p>
<p>And it turns out that this is used</p>
<p>as one of the assessments for autism</p>
<p>because some children, not all,</p>
<p>but some children that have autism</p>
<p>or that go on to develop autism</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have this theory of mind.</p>
<p>They tend to fixate on the fact</p>
<p>that the first child put the toy in the drawer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s in the drawer,</p>
<p>as opposed to answering the question,</p>
<p>which is how does the second child feel about it?</p>
<p>Or what are they experiencing?</p>
<p>So theory of mind is something</p>
<p>that emerges early in life</p>
<p>as a part of the maturation of the circuits in the brain</p>
<p>associated with emotional learning and social interactions.</p>
<p>And we experience this in certain dreams.</p>
<p>So if you had a dream that you&rsquo;re puzzled about</p>
<p>or that you&rsquo;re fixated on and you&rsquo;re thinking about,</p>
<p>you might ask, in that dream,</p>
<p>was I assessing somebody else&rsquo;s emotion and feeling,</p>
<p>or was I very much in my own first-person experience?</p>
<p>And the tendency is that theory of mind</p>
<p>tends to show up most in these REM-associated dreams.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t a hard and fast rule,</p>
<p>but chances are, if you were in a dream</p>
<p>and you were thinking about other people</p>
<p>who wanted to do something to you,</p>
<p>you were thinking about their desire to chase you</p>
<p>or help you or something that was related</p>
<p>to someone else&rsquo;s emotional experience,</p>
<p>it was probably a REM dream.</p>
<p>That dream occurred in rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>as opposed to slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>And that makes sense when you think about the role of REM</p>
<p>in emotional unlearning of associations</p>
<p>with particular life events,</p>
<p>that REM is rich with all sorts of exploration</p>
<p>of the emotional load of being chased</p>
<p>or the emotional load of having to take an exam the next day</p>
<p>or being late for something.</p>
<p>But again, if you&rsquo;re fixated</p>
<p>or you can recall thinking a lot about</p>
<p>or feeling a lot about what somebody else&rsquo;s motivations were</p>
<p>then chances are it was in REM.</p>
<p>And if not, chances are it was in slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;ve been in a deep dive of sleep and dreaming,</p>
<p>learning and unlearning.</p>
<p>And I just want to recap a few of the highlights</p>
<p>and important points.</p>
<p>A lot more slow wave sleep and less REM early in the night.</p>
<p>More REM and less slow wave sleep later in the night.</p>
<p>REM sleep is associated with intense experiences</p>
<p>without this chemical epinephrine</p>
<p>that allows us the anxiety or fear</p>
<p>and almost certainly has an important role</p>
<p>in uncoupling of emotion from experiences,</p>
<p>kind of self-induced therapy that we go into each night.</p>
<p>That bears striking resemblance to things like EMDR</p>
<p>and ketamine therapies and so forth.</p>
<p>Slow wave sleep is critical, however.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s critical mostly for motor learning</p>
<p>and the learning of specific details.</p>
<p>So REM is kind of emotions and general themes</p>
<p>and meaning and slow wave sleep, motor learning and details.</p>
<p>I personally find it fascinating that consistency of sleep,</p>
<p>meaning getting six hours every night</p>
<p>is better than getting 10 one night,</p>
<p>eight the next, five the next, four the next.</p>
<p>I find that fascinating and I think I also like it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something I can control better</p>
<p>than just trying to sleep more,</p>
<p>which I think I&rsquo;m not alone in agreeing</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s just hard for a lot of people to do.</p>
<p>This episode also brings us to the conclusion</p>
<p>of a five episode streak where we&rsquo;ve been focusing on sleep</p>
<p>and transitions in and out of sleep, non-sleep depressed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about a lot of tools,</p>
<p>morning light, evening light, avoiding lights,</p>
<p>blue blockers, supplements,</p>
<p>tools for measuring sleep duration and quality.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been covering a lot of themes.</p>
<p>I like to think that by now you&rsquo;re armed</p>
<p>with a number of tools and information,</p>
<p>things like knowing when your temperature minimum is,</p>
<p>knowing when you might want to view light or not,</p>
<p>when you might want to eat or take hot showers</p>
<p>or God forbid a cold shower,</p>
<p>something that most people, including me,</p>
<p>more or less loathe, but can have certain benefits.</p>
<p>And that will allow you to shape your sleep life</p>
<p>and get this consistent or more or less consistent</p>
<p>amount of sleep on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>In fact, I have this little joke</p>
<p>that I sometimes tell it&rsquo;s not funny.</p>
<p>Like most of the jokes I tell, I&rsquo;m told they&rsquo;re not funny,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much excitement now</p>
<p>about intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that someone should start something</p>
<p>on intermittent sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>although we&rsquo;re already doing that.</p>
<p>We are all experiencing lack of sleep from time to time.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we should catastrophize that too much.</p>
<p>I think that what we want to do</p>
<p>rather than accumulate a sleep anxiety is to,</p>
<p>if we get a bad night&rsquo;s sleep, we want to adjust.</p>
<p>We want to get back on track</p>
<p>and just get the consistent amount of sleep.</p>
<p>Use those non-sleep deep rest protocols</p>
<p>to help us relax when we&rsquo;re feeling anxious</p>
<p>or having trouble waking up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>There are a lot of tools out there</p>
<p>and most of them are zero cost.</p>
<p>And so I hope you&rsquo;ll find those beneficial.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been hearing Costello snoring</p>
<p>throughout this episode, I apologize on his behalf.</p>
<p>As I said in the welcome video to this podcast,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an integral part of the podcast.</p>
<p>A few people have said, hey,</p>
<p>that noise in the background is really disruptive.</p>
<p>Hey, what can I say?</p>
<p>Costello is a 10-year-old bulldog mastiff.</p>
<p>The lifespan on those animals is about 10 years.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not trying to make you feel guilty,</p>
<p>but after he&rsquo;s gone, there won&rsquo;t be any snoring,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;ll probably get a different dog.</p>
<p>So sort of a, what would the kids say?</p>
<p>Sorry, not sorry.</p>
<p>Sorry, not sorry about the snoring.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry if it&rsquo;s disruptive genuinely,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s here for the haul.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>As we close out this segment on sleep,</p>
<p>we are moving into a new theme and topic</p>
<p>for the next four to five episodes.</p>
<p>We are going to discuss the science</p>
<p>and the tools related to neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is a remarkable feature</p>
<p>of the nervous system.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the defining feature of the nervous system,</p>
<p>which is its ability to change itself</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>That is unlike every other tissue and collection of cells</p>
<p>and organ in our body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really what makes us us as a species,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s what makes us us as individuals.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really where our potential lies.</p>
<p>Everything that we know, everything we can do,</p>
<p>and our true potential in terms of what we will ever</p>
<p>be able to know, do, say in life</p>
<p>is set by the limits of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to explore learning in childhood,</p>
<p>learning in adulthood.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to discuss detailed protocols</p>
<p>as they relate to sensory plasticity,</p>
<p>learning new sensory information versus motor plasticity</p>
<p>or sensory motor integration.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about language acquisition.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be talking about emotional acquisition</p>
<p>and breadth, as well as I think a topic</p>
<p>a lot of people are going to find fascinating</p>
<p>is the relationship between plasticity set</p>
<p>during childhood attachment to parent or other caregiver</p>
<p>and how that maps onto adult relationships.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s many of you have probably heard</p>
<p>about Secure Attach or Insecure Attach,</p>
<p>the A, B and C babies as they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>from the classic studies of Bowlby and others.</p>
<p>But now there&rsquo;s actual neuroscience that can say</p>
<p>which circuits were active during those early life</p>
<p>attachments and how those map to adult attachment styles,</p>
<p>challenges, and what makes us more likely</p>
<p>to select certain partners and styles of attachment,</p>
<p>as well as how to change those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>And I think neuroscience&rsquo;s time has come</p>
<p>for neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk, of course,</p>
<p>about supplements and chemicals and machines and devices</p>
<p>that can assist in speeding up the plasticity process.</p>
<p>Or believe it or not, there are some cases</p>
<p>where you might want to delay plasticity</p>
<p>in order to get more depth of learning</p>
<p>and have that learning last longer.</p>
<p>Something that is just absolutely spectacular literature.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very excited to move on to that topic soon.</p>
<p>I hope that the tools that you&rsquo;ve acquired so far</p>
<p>and the knowledge that you&rsquo;ve acquired so far</p>
<p>is helping you with your self-evaluation</p>
<p>and experimentation as you see fit,</p>
<p>and is allowing you to not just sleep better,</p>
<p>but feel better while you&rsquo;re awake,</p>
<p>and hopefully has set the stage for you to learn better</p>
<p>as we start to march into the month on neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Many of you have asked how you can help support</p>
<p>the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and we greatly appreciate the question.</p>
<p>You can help support the podcast</p>
<p>by subscribing to the YouTube channel,</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t already,</p>
<p>and leaving comments and questions in the comment section.</p>
<p>If you could subscribe on Apple and or Spotify,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a place on Apple podcast to leave a rating</p>
<p>as well as comments about how you feel about the podcast.</p>
<p>If you could suggest the podcast to friends and coworkers</p>
<p>and anyone else that you think would benefit</p>
<p>from the information,</p>
<p>that also really helps us get the word out.</p>
<p>And of course, check out our sponsors</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a very direct way to help us continue</p>
<p>to get this information out to the general public.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality,</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>and you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>Last but not least,</p>
<p>a few people wrote to me with some questions</p>
<p>slash corrections about things that I said</p>
<p>in previous podcasts.</p>
<p>So in keeping with my goal</p>
<p>of making the information accurate and clear,</p>
<p>I just want to correct myself</p>
<p>about a few things that I said.</p>
<p>One of those,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m guessing it probably came from an endocrinologist</p>
<p>or somebody else that knows a lot about testicles,</p>
<p>said, Huberman, you mentioned that testosterone</p>
<p>is made by the sertoli cells of the testes,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made by the Leydig cells of the testes,</p>
<p>and indeed you are correct.</p>
<p>And so I want to make sure that I clarify that.</p>
<p>Testosterone is made by the Leydig cells of the testes,</p>
<p>not by the sertoli cells.</p>
<p>The sertoli cells make 5-alpha reductase and aromatase</p>
<p>and some other enzymes involved in conversion of testosterone</p>
<p>into things like DHT and estrogen.</p>
<p>So thank you for that correction.</p>
<p>I genuinely appreciate it.</p>
<p>I misspoke.</p>
<p>The other thing I said was at one point I said,</p>
<p>typical temperature is 96.8,</p>
<p>when I actually meant to say 98.6.</p>
<p>So it was a dyslexic slip on my part,</p>
<p>and I apologize.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m dyslexic.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve been clinically diagnosed with dyslexia,</p>
<p>but I swapped them,</p>
<p>which sometimes happens when I&rsquo;m going fast.</p>
<p>So I apologize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use this as a moment to just say,</p>
<p>temperature varies a lot across the day and night.</p>
<p>That was a theme of previous podcasts.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t really talk about average temperature anyway,</p>
<p>but I do want to be clear that most people think</p>
<p>about average temperature as 98.6.</p>
<p>I misspoke my error and I apologize.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me in this journey</p>
<p>of the nervous system and biology</p>
<p>and trying to understand the mechanisms</p>
<p>that make us who we are and how we function</p>
<p>in sleep and in wakefulness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an incredible landscape to consider.</p>
<p>And I hope that you&rsquo;re getting a lot out of the information.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
