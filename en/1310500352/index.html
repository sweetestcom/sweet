    <p>The following is a conversation with Natalie Cabral,</p>
<p>an astrobiologist and scientist at the SETI Institute,</p>
<p>directing the Carl Sagan Center</p>
<p>for the Study of Life in the Universe.</p>
<p>She explores some of the harshest places on earth,</p>
<p>including free diving and volcanic lakes,</p>
<p>all in the pursuit of understanding</p>
<p>living organisms beyond earth.</p>
<p>For this, she holds the woman&rsquo;s world record</p>
<p>for diving at an altitude, both scuba and free diving.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got True Classic Teas for t-shirts,</p>
<p>Shopify for e-commerce,</p>
<p>BetterHelp for mental health,</p>
<p>and Athletic Greens for the best daily multivitamin.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>Never any ads in the middle, I hate those.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them, if you must,</p>
<p>please still check out the sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by True Classic Teas,</p>
<p>high quality, soft, slim-fitted t-shirts for men.</p>
<p>I happen to be wearing one now.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m wearing one every single day,</p>
<p>unless I&rsquo;m wearing a suit or a dress shirt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the go-to, comfortable programming, coding outfit</p>
<p>if I want to do work.</p>
<p>For prolonged periods of time, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m wearing.</p>
<p>Is there anything better than a great black t-shirt?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there is.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m reading through the t-shirt Wikipedia,</p>
<p>which, again, is amazing that there&rsquo;s a Wikipedia article</p>
<p>on all the basic objects and things</p>
<p>and concepts in this world.</p>
<p>Now, so yeah, there&rsquo;s an interesting history</p>
<p>based in undergarments in the 19th century,</p>
<p>but now there&rsquo;s a big picture of Marlon Brando</p>
<p>wearing a t-shirt in the movie A Streetcar Named Desire.</p>
<p>I guess there is a phase shift at some point</p>
<p>where people started wearing them.</p>
<p>By the Great Depression, a t-shirt was often</p>
<p>the default garment to be worn</p>
<p>when doing farm or ranch chore.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s the cowboy thing.</p>
<p>So first you start at the farm or the ranch,</p>
<p>and then that takes over</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where all the cool people are,</p>
<p>and they define the fashion</p>
<p>of the rugged American individual.</p>
<p>And then it looks like in 1960s,</p>
<p>printed t-shirts gained popularity for self-expression</p>
<p>as well as for advertisement, protests, and souvenirs.</p>
<p>Of course, in the 60s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when people started getting creative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to have a plain t-shirt</p>
<p>like I have on now.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to trueclassic.com and enter code LEX</p>
<p>to get 25% off.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Shopify,</p>
<p>a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere</p>
<p>with a great-looking online store</p>
<p>that brings your ideas to life</p>
<p>and tools to manage day-to-day operation.</p>
<p>And I will likely be using it,</p>
<p>or I should really use it,</p>
<p>when I finally get my lazy butt to start doing merch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that a bunch of people asked for,</p>
<p>and I do myself enjoy wearing t-shirts</p>
<p>for things that I&rsquo;m a fan of.</p>
<p>And then when people notice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a nod of acceptance to each other.</p>
<p>I was just wearing a Metallica t-shirt yesterday.</p>
<p>Which one was it?</p>
<p>I think it was Master of Puppets.</p>
<p>And I used to have that t-shirt many years ago,</p>
<p>and it got so worn out,</p>
<p>because I would wear it everywhere,</p>
<p>and it just got worn out.</p>
<p>And I just saw it,</p>
<p>I was somewhere, I think I was in Boston,</p>
<p>it was a souvenir shop,</p>
<p>and I saw that same shirt,</p>
<p>but it was all crisp and nice,</p>
<p>and I had to have it.</p>
<p>But obviously Metallica&rsquo;s a giant band,</p>
<p>but I think this applies to even small things</p>
<p>like podcasts and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a huge fan of podcasts,</p>
<p>a huge fan of a lot of things,</p>
<p>like audiobooks.</p>
<p>I wish there was more merch for individual audiobooks.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do like merch for books I love.</p>
<p>You know, like books on tape,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll be books on shirt.</p>
<p>Anyway, lots of ideas.</p>

<p>They figure out what you need</p>
<p>to match with a professional licensed therapist</p>
<p>in under 48 hours.</p>
<p>As I look at the internet today,</p>
<p>social networks like Twitter and Facebook</p>
<p>and Instagram and TikTok and YouTube,</p>
<p>and I read some of the comments,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a distant thought in my mind.</p>
<p>How much better would it be</p>
<p>if everyone put a little time to BetterHelp?</p>
<p>Or not even BetterHelp,</p>
<p>just talk therapy of any kind.</p>
<p>Find a therapist of any kind.</p>
<p>It just so happens that BetterHelp</p>
<p>is the easiest way to do it</p>
<p>because you can just do it online.</p>
<p>And for things like that, for therapy,</p>
<p>I wish all difficult things,</p>
<p>I wish going to the gym could be done online.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it can be,</p>
<p>but the actual working out,</p>
<p>like I mean literally go to the gym</p>
<p>because with BetterHelp,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re literally getting therapy remotely, right?</p>
<p>To be able to just do some bench press</p>
<p>and squat remotely somehow,</p>
<p>maybe like inside a virtual world,</p>
<p>but where it actually affects your physical body,</p>
<p>like your muscles grow from you doing a workout remotely.</p>
<p>Huh, a boy can dream.</p>

<p>This show is also brought to you by Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s AG1 Drink, a drink that I just drank.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>10 minutes ago?</p>
<p>I drink it usually twice a day,</p>
<p>once to break a fast</p>
<p>and second time after a hard workout or a long run.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an all-in-one daily drink</p>
<p>to support better health and peak performance.</p>
<p>It has almost become meme,</p>
<p>how much I love Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>It just makes me happy.</p>
<p>I love the taste of it.</p>
<p>I like the psychological feeling</p>
<p>of knowing I got my stuff together</p>
<p>because at least I&rsquo;m taking care of that.</p>
<p>When everything else is falling apart,</p>
<p>when my life is a giant mess,</p>
<p>at least I got some of the basic nutrients</p>
<p>and vitamins into my body.</p>
<p>And the rest, of course,</p>
<p>you have to take care of sleep and exercise and all that,</p>
<p>but at least this one thing,</p>
<p>this is a place I go to for reassurance, for stability.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Nathalie Cabral.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>You are the director of the Carl Sagan Center for Research</p>
<p>at the SETI Institute.</p>
<p>SETI, of course,</p>
<p>stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.</p>
<p>One of the things you do as part of that</p>
<p>is travel to some of Earth&rsquo;s most extreme</p>
<p>and dangerous environments</p>
<p>in search of organisms that live in conditions</p>
<p>analogous to those on Mars.</p>
<p>First, let me ask what the job posting</p>
<p>for the work you do looks like.</p>
<p>Is it like Shackleton&rsquo;s ad in 1900</p>
<p>that said people wanted for hazardous journey</p>
<p>to the South Pole?</p>
<p>Small wages, bitter cold,</p>
<p>long months of complete darkness, constant danger?</p>
<p>And also, where do I apply?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>because there was not really a job application.</p>
<p>In fact, when you&rsquo;re a scientist,</p>
<p>you have questions in your mind,</p>
<p>and you have hypotheses,</p>
<p>and you start to list the kind of thing you need to answer.</p>
<p>And then when you see the kind of thing you have to answer,</p>
<p>then you kind of know the places</p>
<p>where you need to go to do that.</p>
<p>As far as science is concerned,</p>
<p>started with analyzing data from the Mars missions.</p>
<p>And I had written a PhD about water on Mars,</p>
<p>first looking at channels</p>
<p>and the history evolution of water.</p>
<p>But then during my postdoc,</p>
<p>I started to look where that water was ponding.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough,</p>
<p>everybody was about channels and water,</p>
<p>and whether catastrophic or whatnot or seepage.</p>
<p>But when you are talking about ponding water</p>
<p>like lakes or ocean,</p>
<p>people started waving their arms a little bit.</p>
<p>So it was a little bit of a battle,</p>
<p>interestingly enough, yeah.</p>
<p>But that got us on track with my husband.</p>
<p>We were working together,</p>
<p>and we started developing the idea,</p>
<p>the concept of lakes in impact craters.</p>
<p>So why an impact crater is just because</p>
<p>the Viking mission at the time,</p>
<p>which is what we were working with,</p>
<p>the resolution and the topography were so poor</p>
<p>that there was really no way of telling</p>
<p>where you had a real low in the topography.</p>
<p>The only thing you knew was a hole in the ground</p>
<p>was an impact crater.</p>
<p>So when you saw valleys.</p>
<p>What was the Viking mission?</p>
<p>The Viking mission landed on Mars in 1976,</p>
<p>and there were two landers and two orbiters.</p>
<p>So they were really our first feet on the ground on Mars,</p>
<p>but they were lander.</p>
<p>They were not moving.</p>
<p>They were not going up.</p>
<p>And that was the data you were looking at?</p>
<p>It was already in the 90s,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t have yet the Mars Global Surveyor</p>
<p>and whatnot.</p>
<p>We still work for 20 years.</p>
<p>We worked on that.</p>
<p>I did my master and my PhD thesis on Viking missions.</p>
<p>You mentioned that the places you go to</p>
<p>are defined by the questions you want to ask.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just step back.</p>
<p>What questions have always tugged at your heart?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I was looking at those images</p>
<p>and saw some lakes.</p>
<p>And then came time where we started talking</p>
<p>about sending landers and rovers on Mars</p>
<p>and looking maybe at the possibility</p>
<p>that Mars was habitable.</p>
<p>And lakes are particularly good places</p>
<p>to look for those questions.</p>
<p>So this is how it all ties up.</p>
<p>So you were always curious about life out there?</p>
<p>I have been always curious about life in the universe</p>
<p>and about questions on how we got to be here</p>
<p>and the bigger question.</p>
<p>Now with 25 years more in that business,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more about understanding the origin and nature of life</p>
<p>rather than whether there is life or not on Mars.</p>
<p>I mean, this was really for me a stepping stone</p>
<p>to bigger questions.</p>
<p>But they were definitely important</p>
<p>because they helped me frame my way of thinking</p>
<p>about those questions.</p>
<p>And so looking at Mars, at lakes,</p>
<p>understanding what the conditions were,</p>
<p>3.5 billion years ago or close to 4 billion years ago,</p>
<p>then I knew the type of environment</p>
<p>I needed to explore here on earth as analogous</p>
<p>to be able to understand what type of life</p>
<p>still survives in those environment</p>
<p>and what kind of instrument</p>
<p>and what kind of resolution do I need to actually detect it.</p>
<p>So this is how the whole thing started.</p>
<p>And it started with a small grant, literally 40K.</p>
<p>It was a discretionary fund.</p>
<p>And this is how I got started in my career.</p>
<p>And so many of these questions you can answer</p>
<p>by looking at life in extreme conditions here on earth.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s step back a little bit</p>
<p>and look at Mars and lakes on Mars.</p>
<p>Just going back to your PhD and before, and maybe today,</p>
<p>what do we understand about life on Mars?</p>
<p>What do we understand about lakes on Mars?</p>
<p>Is there water on Mars?</p>
<p>What do we understand about the conditions</p>
<p>from 4 billion years ago on Mars?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve gone a long way.</p>
<p>Remember from the Viking where we had no resolution,</p>
<p>well, we had a little bit more resolution than with Mariner.</p>
<p>What did you think at that time?</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Just take us back to that mindset.</p>
<p>It was really the exploration,</p>
<p>like your first look at a planet.</p>
<p>You have to remember that the first mission</p>
<p>that successfully snapped some pictures of Mars</p>
<p>was Mariner 4.</p>
<p>And then everybody at that time</p>
<p>was still under the spell of H. Wells</p>
<p>and the idea that Mars looked with telescope</p>
<p>so similar to the earth.</p>
<p>Polar caps, we could see them with a telescope</p>
<p>and we knew it had season.</p>
<p>The actual tilt is pretty much the same</p>
<p>as the one for earth.</p>
<p>So when Mariner 4 left, everybody, not everybody,</p>
<p>but a lot of people thought</p>
<p>that we would see the crystal cities and domes and stuff,</p>
<p>that another civilization might have evolved</p>
<p>in parallel to us in the solar system.</p>
<p>And of course, when the first images came back</p>
<p>and Mars looked with that kind of resolution,</p>
<p>it had like the moon.</p>
<p>It was a huge disappointment.</p>
<p>Then Mariner 9 came and that changed everything.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of drama</p>
<p>because Mars started one of the biggest dust storm</p>
<p>it ever experienced.</p>
<p>And so for three months,</p>
<p>we had an orbiter circling around Mars</p>
<p>and not seeing anything.</p>
<p>But then when the dust cleared,</p>
<p>all of a sudden we started discovering volcanoes,</p>
<p>valleys, ancient channels, dune fields, polar caps,</p>
<p>and see what I&rsquo;m talking to you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to invent any words to describe Mars.</p>
<p>And although the myth of extraterrestrial civilization</p>
<p>on Mars was gone, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>the imagination of the scientists started to pick up</p>
<p>because right away we&rsquo;re seeing something</p>
<p>that was familiar, that we could describe.</p>
<p>So right away, Viking would put on the fast track</p>
<p>and the idea was so Mars looks so much</p>
<p>like earth could have been,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s arid and there is little atmosphere, et cetera,</p>
<p>could there be life?</p>
<p>And of course, behind this,</p>
<p>at the time they were people like Klein and Sagan,</p>
<p>Carl Sagan, just thinking about how can we test</p>
<p>the idea of biology of life on Mars?</p>
<p>So this is what Viking did.</p>
<p>But of course, at the time when the two landers</p>
<p>arrived on Mars, we didn&rsquo;t have the context</p>
<p>of the geology of the environment.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have much data at all.</p>
<p>So the data that Viking sent back was very confusing.</p>
<p>Some people still think today that we discovered life</p>
<p>on Mars at the time,</p>
<p>because some of the experiment turned out</p>
<p>to show a strange signal.</p>
<p>But most of the community think that it can be explained</p>
<p>by chemical reaction that we see today.</p>
<p>So it was so confusing that NASA decided to say,</p>
<p>okay, if we want to be serious about looking for life</p>
<p>on Mars, we have to understand the environment</p>
<p>because life and environment co-evolve.</p>
<p>So as cause or effect, a planet is going to give you</p>
<p>the physical chemical environment for life to happen.</p>
<p>These are the boundaries.</p>
<p>But once life is here, it&rsquo;s going to change everything.</p>
<p>One of the biggest impact of life was to inject</p>
<p>oxygen into the atmosphere of the earth</p>
<p>three, two billion years ago.</p>
<p>And that changed everything,</p>
<p>including our signature in space.</p>
<p>So there is this co-evolution.</p>
<p>So if you want to understand one,</p>
<p>you have to remove the other from the equation,</p>
<p>this kind of a two or none equation.</p>
<p>So even though oxygen changes our signature today,</p>
<p>what if all life on earth died,</p>
<p>and now we fast forward a billion years,</p>
<p>what would be the traces left?</p>
<p>So the question I&rsquo;m trying to ask is,</p>
<p>if life had existed on Mars,</p>
<p>what would be the signs we would look for?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very good question.</p>
<p>The thing is that if you draw the parallel with earth,</p>
<p>it took 82% of earth history, geological history,</p>
<p>to go from very simple life, microbial life, to complexity.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m saying complexity,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even talking about us, I&rsquo;m talking about animals.</p>
<p>So Mars is smaller, lost its magnetic field very fast,</p>
<p>and lost its atmosphere is very fast.</p>
<p>Life also appeared on earth very fast.</p>
<p>So the condition being quite similar at that time</p>
<p>between the earth and Mars,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume for a moment that life appeared on Mars.</p>
<p>It would have been simple life</p>
<p>when conditions started to degrade,</p>
<p>which was less than a billion year</p>
<p>after the planet had formed.</p>
<p>So everything at the surface would have disappeared,</p>
<p>except maybe for morphological traces of the interaction</p>
<p>between life and its environment.</p>
<p>So on earth, the best example</p>
<p>are what we call stromatolites.</p>
<p>These are rock formation that are built by microbes.</p>
<p>So we know that, we know how to recognize them.</p>
<p>You could have chemical traces as well.</p>
<p>There is some interesting question marks right now</p>
<p>about carbon isotopes at Gale crater,</p>
<p>because we found an abundance of C12,</p>
<p>which normally is used by life on earth,</p>
<p>but it can be produced by other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s a real biosignature in itself,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s intriguing.</p>
<p>We have now the C12 and we have methane.</p>
<p>But going back, it&rsquo;s a time on Mars 3.5 billion years ago</p>
<p>where you have lots of destructions,</p>
<p>where you have lots of impact cratering, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we still have very old rocks</p>
<p>that survive from that time.</p>
<p>So these are good places.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re sending the rovers in those places,</p>
<p>ancient lakes and impact craters,</p>
<p>and places where you have very old rocks.</p>
<p>So when you say ancient lakes and impact craters,</p>
<p>the simple question, so impact crater is a crater</p>
<p>created by a giant rock hitting the planet?</p>
<p>And yes, a big rock that can be metal or rock,</p>
<p>or it can be a comet as well, mostly ice.</p>
<p>So is that good for life or bad for life?</p>
<p>For creating life and destroying life?</p>
<p>Both, it&rsquo;s actually both.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the building blocks of life,</p>
<p>the bricks, the stuff we are made of,</p>
<p>carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and phosphorus,</p>
<p>they were included on our planet.</p>
<p>They were built in just because our planet is made</p>
<p>of this kind of rocks, asteroids and comets</p>
<p>coming together by what we call accretion.</p>
<p>So they were built in.</p>
<p>When an asteroid comes,</p>
<p>there is a lot of destruction going on.</p>
<p>But at the same time, those rocks,</p>
<p>they bring with them those bricks of life,</p>
<p>and they create lots of energy.</p>
<p>And if the environment around is favorable,</p>
<p>you might possibly have some seeding going on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the aspect of what we call panspermia,</p>
<p>which is the fact that comets and asteroids</p>
<p>have the building blocks of life embedded in them,</p>
<p>and that given favorable condition,</p>
<p>they might be able to seed planets.</p>
<p>This is a theory.</p>
<p>What percent of you, when you&rsquo;re looking up at the stars</p>
<p>and wondering about this stuff,</p>
<p>thinks that panspermia is what happened on Mars</p>
<p>or on Earth, which is the building blocks of life</p>
<p>came from elsewhere?</p>
<p>Well, but that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Panspermia is a vector, potential vector,</p>
<p>which means that it actually distributes</p>
<p>the stuff of life left and right,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t explain the origin of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the environment itself.</p>
<p>It just promotes maybe, and we still have to prove this.</p>
<p>But what we know is that the stuff we are made of</p>
<p>is very abundant all over the place,</p>
<p>including in interstellar medium.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all over, it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>The idea is that maybe it just waits</p>
<p>to have the proper environment,</p>
<p>and we know what it needs here on Earth.</p>
<p>It needs water, it needs energy, shelter, and nutrients.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re fundamentally interested in the origin of life</p>
<p>and the big leaps in evolutionary history</p>
<p>that could be like an origin of something,</p>
<p>origin of eukaryotes, origin of photosynthesis,</p>
<p>origin of whatever.</p>
<p>I just think if we&rsquo;re a civilization here on Earth</p>
<p>and we survive another few hundred years,</p>
<p>I think it would be a good idea to take a big gun</p>
<p>and just shoot life out there, like a life gun.</p>
<p>Basically try to create panspermia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good backup solution.</p>
<p>So one way is to actually copy our brains</p>
<p>and actual humans, some complex information,</p>
<p>and send it out there.</p>
<p>Another way to preserve life is just to</p>
<p>send the basic building blocks, send a bunch of bacteria,</p>
<p>a bunch of whatever the rugged organisms are on Earth,</p>
<p>just send a bunch of those.</p>
<p>These are not the building blocks.</p>
<p>They are actual organism.</p>
<p>Right, but isn&rsquo;t that a nice shortcut?</p>
<p>Or do we wanna,</p>
<p>because you said building blocks are everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, the bricks of life, the carbon, hydrogen, et cetera,</p>
<p>they were produced by the death of previous stars.</p>
<p>So this is how they were produced.</p>
<p>And stars like our sun started to form 10 billion years ago.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the sun is the only kind of star</p>
<p>that produce life or enables life,</p>
<p>but actually was produced 10 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Now what you&rsquo;re talking about is a little different.</p>
<p>Right now there are many,</p>
<p>many efforts to do the type of thing you are talking about,</p>
<p>which is to put our DNA on whatever kind of substrate</p>
<p>and preserve it in vaults,</p>
<p>either in different place on Earth or on the moon.</p>
<p>Some people are already thinking about putting DNA</p>
<p>on the moon.</p>
<p>As far as brain&rsquo;s concerned,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s drawing towards transhumanism,</p>
<p>which is the enhancement of who we are</p>
<p>through AI and machine learning.</p>
<p>Of course, having backups is a good thing.</p>
<p>For me, I would say that taking care of our planets</p>
<p>and going back to a place</p>
<p>where we are in equilibrium with our environment</p>
<p>would be also maybe the best backup possible</p>
<p>and let evolution do its things.</p>
<p>Right now we are like teenagers</p>
<p>with enough brain to create cool tools,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t have enough brain to understand</p>
<p>yet the consequences of what we are doing.</p>
<p>And right now we are paying for this.</p>
<p>So the question is whether we are going to be able</p>
<p>to move forward and learn from the mistakes we are making</p>
<p>to become a mature civilization.</p>
<p>You probably heard of the Drake equation.</p>
<p>That would be the L at the very end, the duration.</p>
<p>Duration of intelligent civilization.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And, or at least the length of time</p>
<p>a civilization remains detectable.</p>
<p>It can disappear from the radar screen,</p>
<p>literally for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>The first one is destroyed itself</p>
<p>or being destroyed by external events,</p>
<p>or it can become so in tune with the universe</p>
<p>and so advanced that it disappears</p>
<p>because he melts really in the background</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not visible anymore.</p>
<p>There are some wild theories out there saying</p>
<p>that civilization might be so advanced</p>
<p>that you cannot distinguish them from physical processes.</p>
<p>And that was an example.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t say that this is the case,</p>
<p>but some people say, imagine that in fact,</p>
<p>all the dark matter that we see or we theorized about</p>
<p>is in fact some sort of a biological process.</p>
<p>So you can think about a number of things.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe that what you talk about,</p>
<p>about preserving our information is kind of what life does.</p>
<p>We need to look at ourselves as not different</p>
<p>of what the little self that started off was.</p>
<p>And this is what tells you not about the origin of life,</p>
<p>but in fact, the nature of life,</p>
<p>which is a lot more interesting to me</p>
<p>because the nature of life is really</p>
<p>what is going to give you some universal signature</p>
<p>to look for it all over the place.</p>
<p>And not only around ponds of water for life as we know it,</p>
<p>but the nature of life is telling you</p>
<p>that life wants to get the most information possible</p>
<p>around its surroundings.</p>
<p>And complexity is in fact,</p>
<p>the ability to gather and exchange</p>
<p>and preserve the most information possible.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;re saying is kind of preserving</p>
<p>the kind of information we have.</p>
<p>So in the things that we are doing,</p>
<p>as life happened,</p>
<p>and I say happened because we don&rsquo;t know what life is,</p>
<p>we have 123 definitions of life.</p>
<p>And some people are saying,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have any definition,</p>
<p>we only have descriptions of life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So think about it for two minutes.</p>
<p>We are looking for something we don&rsquo;t know it is,</p>
<p>but we have a few clues about the nature of life.</p>
<p>There are some really good theories.</p>
<p>The first one was Schrodinger, right?</p>
<p>In the 40s.</p>
<p>Right now there is a guy named Jeremy England.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another biophysical theory of life.</p>
<p>It says life is the inevitable result</p>
<p>of thermophysics.</p>
<p>This is the best way to beat entropy, to fight entropy.</p>
<p>But when you look at what we are doing,</p>
<p>if you want to know what the nature of life is,</p>
<p>look at our languages.</p>
<p>And they can be very different languages,</p>
<p>but they all have the same purpose, right?</p>
<p>Exchange information, understand, store information,</p>
<p>and also whether it is with somebody at the outside</p>
<p>or thoughts in yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same thing the cell was doing.</p>
<p>But now when you&rsquo;re looking at life</p>
<p>and at the structure of our languages,</p>
<p>life started with an atom.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an atom.</p>
<p>They got together to create inorganic molecules.</p>
<p>Then you have complex inorganic molecules.</p>
<p>Then you get to organic molecules,</p>
<p>complex inorganic molecules.</p>
<p>And then you have RNA, DNA, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the structure of our language.</p>
<p>We created alphabets, letters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your atom.</p>
<p>Then we put them together to create syllables, right?</p>
<p>Those syllables get together to create words.</p>
<p>Words tell you something,</p>
<p>but they are nothing without a verb</p>
<p>that gives the direction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s RNA and DNA.</p>
<p>And then you can put all the complements you want.</p>
<p>Our languages are built exactly as life is built.</p>
<p>We are repeating patterns.</p>
<p>I call this the Mandelbrot universe</p>
<p>and the fractal universe,</p>
<p>because this is exactly what it is.</p>
<p>I would say that as much as I do believe</p>
<p>to sending probes to explore the universe,</p>
<p>I say we should also look inward</p>
<p>to find the answer to some of the profound question</p>
<p>of who we are, what&rsquo;s life, what&rsquo;s the nature of life,</p>
<p>because we are expressing life.</p>
<p>So searching not for life, but for the nature of life.</p>
<p>The nature of life, absolutely.</p>
<p>I am more interested in that</p>
<p>because the day we understand the nature of life,</p>
<p>then we have a universal biosignature.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether this life</p>
<p>respond to the same kind of biochemical processes as we do,</p>
<p>although it makes sense.</p>
<p>I told you about the generational aspect</p>
<p>of the bricks of life,</p>
<p>the stuff we are made of.</p>
<p>The sun is part of the youngest generation of stars.</p>
<p>And the first two generation of stars</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t produce the kind of elements we are made of.</p>
<p>They were stars that were either without metal,</p>
<p>just made of helium and hydrogen, or poor in metals.</p>
<p>So the stars died off</p>
<p>and stars like the sun were born from those.</p>
<p>And this is why we have elements like carbon,</p>
<p>hydrogen, oxygen, et cetera, now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the life we are built on.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s not stupid to be looking</p>
<p>for something that looks like us,</p>
<p>because right now in the universe,</p>
<p>this is the stuff that&rsquo;s the most abundant.</p>
<p>And we see with the exoplanet, with Kepler, with TESS,</p>
<p>and now with James Webb,</p>
<p>we see that there are many, many different type of planets</p>
<p>that may be habitable in the habitable zone of their stars.</p>
<p>There are countless stars like the sun,</p>
<p>but more interestingly enough,</p>
<p>there are other type of stars</p>
<p>where you do have habitable zone as well,</p>
<p>and where the duration of the stars</p>
<p>are sometimes a thousand times more than our sun.</p>
<p>So you can imagine all sorts of things,</p>
<p>and you can imagine what type of life would be</p>
<p>around those stars.</p>
<p>The biochemistry might be quite similar, in fact,</p>
<p>and especially for the simple life,</p>
<p>because simple life starts really quickly on Earth.</p>
<p>So my take on this is that the universe</p>
<p>is full of cyanobacteria,</p>
<p>but as far as intelligent life, it takes more time.</p>
<p>So that can take different aspect.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s possible that the universe</p>
<p>is full of bacteria,</p>
<p>and even those stars that last a thousand times longer</p>
<p>than the sun,</p>
<p>even on the planets that orbit those stars,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s bacteria,</p>
<p>for billions and billions and billions of years.</p>
<p>We actually don&rsquo;t know what triggered</p>
<p>the evolution to complexity on Earth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still a big question mark.</p>
<p>Is that the most impressive invention on Earth to you?</p>
<p>That Cambrian revolution is really what took us</p>
<p>towards what we are.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, there were the dinosaurs, et cetera,</p>
<p>the dinosaur were wiped out.</p>
<p>So the evolution could have taken</p>
<p>a completely different turn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always, I would say, mass extinction</p>
<p>that are going to drive what&rsquo;s the end game.</p>
<p>But yeah, you take two planets and you change</p>
<p>those asteroid impacts or those big geological events</p>
<p>that wipe out like 90% of life at any time.</p>
<p>The thing that seemed to be interesting,</p>
<p>there are two things.</p>
<p>The first one is where you are located on our galaxy</p>
<p>matters a lot.</p>
<p>We actually are in the habitable zone of our galaxy.</p>
<p>And if you are too close to the center,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s a lot denser.</p>
<p>And remember, we have the Oort cloud</p>
<p>around our solar system.</p>
<p>And if you are in the region of the galaxy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too populated,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to run gravitational interaction</p>
<p>with all these stars.</p>
<p>And since it&rsquo;s more dense,</p>
<p>you will have more of the comets that are living</p>
<p>in the Oort cloud being ejected from the Oort cloud</p>
<p>and coming towards the inner solar system</p>
<p>and collide with planets.</p>
<p>So you will have more of these impacts</p>
<p>if you are too close to the center of the galaxy,</p>
<p>not to mention the radiation.</p>
<p>There is a place in our galaxy</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a really bad neighborhood.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to have life.</p>
<p>But what really matters is extinctions,</p>
<p>but also the climate history of a planet</p>
<p>has a role to play.</p>
<p>And it seems that it&rsquo;s a theory.</p>
<p>It still has to be backed up by more observation,</p>
<p>but there is a good correlation</p>
<p>between not only the passage of the solar system</p>
<p>towards the center of the galaxy.</p>
<p>There is one place where we get hit by asteroid</p>
<p>because of the interaction I was telling you about.</p>
<p>But the other one is the climate</p>
<p>with the Milankovitch cycles.</p>
<p>Big jumps in life&rsquo;s evolution seem to be associated</p>
<p>with snowball earth episodes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why yet.</p>
<p>Snowball episode, intuitively you would think</p>
<p>that they are connected to a decrease in life</p>
<p>because the whole earth is covered in ice.</p>
<p>But for some reason,</p>
<p>there were big jumps in evolution right after.</p>
<p>Each of those episodes.</p>
<p>And today there are other things like</p>
<p>why all of a sudden you have mutation</p>
<p>that seems to be responsible for a big jump in evolution.</p>
<p>We are not clear yet.</p>
<p>So all of those things,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re thinking about life elsewhere</p>
<p>are going to come into play.</p>
<p>And I cannot tell you that a planet that remains habitable</p>
<p>for much longer than the earth</p>
<p>will have an evolutionary path</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the same or different.</p>
<p>Depends on extension, depends on climate,</p>
<p>depends on whatnot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit surreal</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re two descendants of apes.</p>
<p>Well, I think that some people-</p>
<p>Try to figure out what the heck is going on.</p>
<p>And I mean, we&rsquo;re very biased.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re biased as humans.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re less biased as a scientist.</p>
<p>But we still love earth.</p>
<p>We still don&rsquo;t know anything but this earth.</p>
<p>And so even though you try to escape</p>
<p>from thinking of what life is</p>
<p>in the search for the nature of life,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still kind of connected to</p>
<p>the way we understand the nature of life here on earth.</p>
<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s a little different than that.</p>
<p>We are biased when it comes to the origin of life.</p>
<p>Because, well, we are the only model we know.</p>
<p>And as I said, it makes sense</p>
<p>because it seems that a lot of stars like the sun</p>
<p>appeared 10 billion years ago.</p>
<p>And there are lots of world that really resemble the earth</p>
<p>and lots of water out there</p>
<p>and lots of condition that could be</p>
<p>a repeat of what we know.</p>
<p>And we know that this biochemistry works.</p>
<p>So again, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>what is going to change is really</p>
<p>the evolution of a planet.</p>
<p>Extinction, geology, et cetera.</p>
<p>But our model is probably very abundant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that the end game</p>
<p>is going to resemble us</p>
<p>because of all these extinction, et cetera.</p>
<p>But this is a good bias.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one that has the number for it.</p>
<p>You know, the principle of mediocrity.</p>
<p>I think that in that case,</p>
<p>it really applies where the earth</p>
<p>is representative of an abundance of other worlds.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there can be other biochemistry.</p>
<p>We have some examples in our own solar system.</p>
<p>Titan might be a representative of that.</p>
<p>We are not very clear of the kind of biochemistry</p>
<p>that can come out of a world</p>
<p>where you have hydrocarbon lakes</p>
<p>and rains and things like that.</p>
<p>But we are going there.</p>
<p>So we will learn something about this.</p>
<p>So the bias is right there.</p>
<p>The nature of life is different.</p>
<p>If really life is the best way</p>
<p>the universe has to fight entropy,</p>
<p>there is no bias there</p>
<p>because physics is the same all across the universe.</p>
<p>At least the universe we know.</p>
<p>There might be other universes,</p>
<p>but the one we know works with the same physics.</p>
<p>So if life is the best way to fight entropy,</p>
<p>you can imagine that life permeates the entire universe.</p>
<p>And then the question might change</p>
<p>to flavors of ice cream.</p>
<p>What are the flavors of complexity</p>
<p>that this process, this nature of life leads to?</p>
<p>And there we might have bias</p>
<p>about what complexity looks like,</p>
<p>what beautiful complexity looks like.</p>
<p>We look at humans that operate</p>
<p>at a certain physical scale and time scale,</p>
<p>and we think this is intelligence.</p>
<p>We have another problem.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what life is.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what intelligence is,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know what consciousness is.</p>
<p>But we are trying to tackle the big question.</p>
<p>Do we know what complexity is also?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that we have to be honest.</p>
<p>And as a scientist,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna step back and talk about intelligence.</p>
<p>For me, a bacteria that has survived,</p>
<p>like cyanobacteria that has survived just like us,</p>
<p>four billion years in one incarnation or another,</p>
<p>and actually they are very similar</p>
<p>to the one that they were 3.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>It has some intelligence about its environment.</p>
<p>So for complexity,</p>
<p>it might be that we need to take the world literally,</p>
<p>which is an assemblage or additional capacity</p>
<p>to gather, collect, store information.</p>
<p>Maybe this is something like that,</p>
<p>or actually use that information to do something with it.</p>
<p>But I do completely agree with you</p>
<p>when you talk about flavor of ice cream.</p>
<p>I think this is exactly it.</p>
<p>And I have a basic education</p>
<p>about what physics is doing right now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m look at quantum physics</p>
<p>and what it says about the universe</p>
<p>and about the connection about an atom here,</p>
<p>and an atom here, a photon here and a photon there.</p>
<p>And I am starting to put maybe wrongfully,</p>
<p>two and two together.</p>
<p>But in my mind,</p>
<p>and of course it&rsquo;s nothing until I can prove it,</p>
<p>but in my mind,</p>
<p>the universe is connected everywhere</p>
<p>in all different places.</p>
<p>So this life connection is something that,</p>
<p>as you said, permeate the universe.</p>
<p>And the way to find life</p>
<p>might be very different</p>
<p>than to look for the origins of life.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good thing to go out there</p>
<p>and look for the origin of life somewhere else,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the manifestation of the nature of life</p>
<p>that all of a sudden becomes apparent, evident to our eye.</p>
<p>But what I think would be our greatest achievement</p>
<p>is that if we can find that process of life,</p>
<p>because at that point, in my mind,</p>
<p>the universe all of a sudden is going to illuminate itself</p>
<p>with actually its living force,</p>
<p>what I can only call a living force.</p>
<p>To me, this is what we are looking at,</p>
<p>a universe that becomes more and more complex with time,</p>
<p>more and more able to gather information,</p>
<p>and interestingly enough, why?</p>
<p>To understand itself.</p>
<p>So Sagan was right when he was telling,</p>
<p>we are the universe trying to understand itself.</p>
<p>And the more we go, the more the universe become alive,</p>
<p>maybe intelligent, and maybe also conscious.</p>
<p>Conscious, self-aware.</p>
<p>Exactly. Through us.</p>
<p>It does make me a little bit sad as a human,</p>
<p>just watching all the breakthroughs</p>
<p>on artificial intelligence side</p>
<p>when applied to natural sciences,</p>
<p>now more and more to physics,</p>
<p>that the creatures that will solve</p>
<p>the question of the origin of the nature of life</p>
<p>or just the process, the nature of life,</p>
<p>will be AI systems.</p>
<p>It makes me a bit sad to&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Because&hellip; You think humans will?</p>
<p>At this point in time, remember who&rsquo;s behind AI.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not buying in the singularity thing yet.</p>
<p>AI is not aware.</p>
<p>AI is being built by humans.</p>
<p>So AI is a tool, an extremely smart tool,</p>
<p>as long as we build it.</p>
<p>And as long as we use it as a tool, it remains a tool.</p>
<p>And I think there is a lot of brouhaha,</p>
<p>and of course, science fiction and movies, they don&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>Yeah, I gotta push back a little bit.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree with you for the most part</p>
<p>in terms of brouhaha and sci-fi.</p>
<p>But there is, like in the work of DeepMind,</p>
<p>we can look at chess or we can look at protein folding.</p>
<p>So chess is a simple one to first look at.</p>
<p>What AlphaZero, which is their game-playing engine,</p>
<p>was able to discover, and now Stockfish,</p>
<p>about chess humbles the best human players.</p>
<p>Not just it&rsquo;s better than them.</p>
<p>It comes up with ideas that the humans don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And so the AI now is telling you,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s programmed by humans,</p>
<p>the AI is saying, sacrificing a pawn here is a good idea.</p>
<p>Sacrificing a queen or a bishop here is a good idea.</p>
<p>And then you start to kind of intuit as a human why,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t deeply understand.</p>
<p>And you can say that AI is not conscious,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t deeply understand the way humans do,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still a wisdom and a depth of knowledge</p>
<p>in that chess-playing program that humans don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And the same with the alpha fold with protein folding.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, and now they&rsquo;re applying it to physics</p>
<p>to simulating nuclear reactions and so on.</p>
<p>It feels like there might be a way</p>
<p>to understand the nature of life,</p>
<p>that we can kind of intuit poetically as humans,</p>
<p>but the true understanding will come from a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more computationally sophisticated.</p>
<p>Again, I would push back on my turn</p>
<p>because I still think that humans give themselves</p>
<p>the ability to do that by building that tool.</p>
<p>So the idea that the tool,</p>
<p>we are getting into the Kardashev scale</p>
<p>and the dark forest and all of these things.</p>
<p>We can see the world this way.</p>
<p>At this point in time, for me,</p>
<p>I still see a great tool.</p>
<p>Now, whether the sci-fi scenario is going to happen,</p>
<p>et cetera, I still think that we are far away from this.</p>
<p>But if that tool is capable of giving me a new perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just that we are starting to jump</p>
<p>into a deeper cognition of what the universe is,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s through our brain</p>
<p>or through a different way of gathering information.</p>
<p>Remember, this is what we do.</p>
<p>Yeah, humans are able to actually build tools</p>
<p>and then integrate them into their way of thinking.</p>
<p>Maybe another generation has to be born</p>
<p>that is raised with those tools,</p>
<p>but we seem to take for granted all the cool technologies</p>
<p>you integrate into your way of thinking.</p>
<p>A lot of people that are growing up now,</p>
<p>their mind is integrated with the internet.</p>
<p>You basically reconfigure the way you memorize things.</p>
<p>You no longer have to memorize a lot of facts</p>
<p>because you can look them up really quickly.</p>
<p>And so you reallocate a lot of resources</p>
<p>for thinking versus memory of just strict facts,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff, and we integrate all of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there I would completely agree with you.</p>
<p>In fact, I wrote about this again</p>
<p>in this new book that&rsquo;s coming out.</p>
<p>When is the book coming out?</p>
<p>In January, it will be in French, actually, to start with.</p>
<p>You wrote it in French?</p>
<p>Actually, I wrote it first in English</p>
<p>and I translated it into French,</p>
<p>so the English version is already pretty much ready to go</p>
<p>if we find a publisher in the US.</p>
<p>But anyways, the point being here</p>
<p>is that I looked at this as a relationship with technology,</p>
<p>as a complete change.</p>
<p>To me, this is a singularity more than anything else,</p>
<p>which is the co-evolution of human with technology,</p>
<p>not anymore with their environment.</p>
<p>Why we are messing up the environment right now,</p>
<p>why we don&rsquo;t respond to pandemic the way we should,</p>
<p>because we are disconnected to the environment</p>
<p>we are taking our information from</p>
<p>and we were adapting from.</p>
<p>Right now, exactly as you said,</p>
<p>we take the information from the web,</p>
<p>from the phones, et cetera.</p>
<p>We have no filter over that information.</p>
<p>Before, you were out in the environment,</p>
<p>and the information you get</p>
<p>is the one the planet is sending you.</p>
<p>Now, this information is coming from different way.</p>
<p>You have no way of knowing</p>
<p>if the information is correct or not.</p>
<p>Yeah, I gotta push back on that.</p>
<p>No, you look at this as an ecosystem</p>
<p>and it explains a lot of our behavior.</p>
<p>See, I like that you said teenagers.</p>
<p>So, the technology, I think,</p>
<p>when we move past the teenager stage,</p>
<p>enriches our ability to sense the earth,</p>
<p>to understand what&rsquo;s going on with the environment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re very,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not that technology disconnects us</p>
<p>from the environment.</p>
<p>It gives us more tools with which to understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with the environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for the people who are building the tools</p>
<p>and know how to use it.</p>
<p>Take those tools now, put them in the general public</p>
<p>with no filter, which is happening with social media,</p>
<p>which is happening with a lot of things,</p>
<p>and you see the disaster this is creating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the disaster.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>You sound like a parent talking about a teenager.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The teenager, it&rsquo;s the growing pains of a civilization</p>
<p>that is becoming deeply connected with our,</p>
<p>we can communicate all across the world,</p>
<p>even through the pandemic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the good thing about technology.</p>
<p>This is also something I wrote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the tools we create that are bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way we use them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>This is the cool thing about humans.</p>
<p>And hopefully we&rsquo;ll do all the learning</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s too late,</p>
<p>because our response to what&rsquo;s going on in the environment,</p>
<p>our response to pandemics is deeply connected</p>
<p>to this disconnect we have with nature.</p>
<p>Anyways, we all agree that we are in growing pains,</p>
<p>and hopefully we can move forward</p>
<p>because there is a fantastic universe,</p>
<p>something absolutely magical around us.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking as a scientist.</p>
<p>I mean, there is magic, not in sense of trickery,</p>
<p>but in sense of wonder around us.</p>
<p>And there are so many signs where we are getting so close</p>
<p>to revolutions in cosmology, in astrobiology,</p>
<p>in astronomy, which I think to me,</p>
<p>this is where the hope lies.</p>
<p>And also an awakening of understanding</p>
<p>that we need to be in equilibrium with a planet</p>
<p>if we want to move forward.</p>
<p>Because even though we have these big dreams</p>
<p>of going on Mars and the moon,</p>
<p>listen, I am a planetary geologist,</p>
<p>so I am all for exploration.</p>
<p>Right now, the moon or Mars is not going to save your butt</p>
<p>because for the logistics,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll still depend very much on the earth</p>
<p>and for a long time.</p>
<p>I think this time we are living in</p>
<p>will be remembered as a pivot in our history</p>
<p>for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>A time where there is a growing consciousness,</p>
<p>where we are creating tools</p>
<p>that are going a little bit ahead of us,</p>
<p>that we have some difficult time to catching up on with,</p>
<p>where we have to deal with a population</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s way too big for the planet we have.</p>
<p>We need to really learn a sense of balance</p>
<p>and maturity as a civilization.</p>
<p>So how is this going to unfold?</p>
<p>Right now, I have no clue.</p>
<p>I draw a lot of optimism from the similar things</p>
<p>that happened many decades ago</p>
<p>when nuclear weapons were developed.</p>
<p>Boy, it was that at the time, even more terrifying.</p>
<p>You just now created weapons</p>
<p>that could destroy the entirety of life on earth,</p>
<p>or not entirety, but a lot of it.</p>
<p>And we somehow found a balance.</p>
<p>And the threat constantly is out there.</p>
<p>And that threat has been made more visceral in recent times</p>
<p>because of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But we find a balance somehow.</p>
<p>So I have a thread of optimism for human civilization</p>
<p>that we figure it out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re clever teenagers, I think.</p>
<p>We are clever teenagers.</p>
<p>There is definitely a thread of optimism,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s thin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thin because something that has changed as well</p>
<p>is the mentality of humans.</p>
<p>Although the threat was terrifying</p>
<p>when nuclear weapons were created,</p>
<p>there was a sense of limits</p>
<p>you were willing to push in the threats.</p>
<p>There was a sense of decency, of moral values.</p>
<p>It was not perfect, but it was at least a time</p>
<p>where people could come together</p>
<p>from very different perspective and agree</p>
<p>that something was more important</p>
<p>than destroying everything.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s so hilarious you say that.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re talking about a small slither of humans,</p>
<p>which is the scientists in the Manhattan Project, perhaps.</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>That was also the time when over 100 million people</p>
<p>were tortured or murdered in China and in Europe.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about scientists here.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m talking about politicians.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone beyond that point now.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m worried about.</p>
<p>I mean, torture, et cetera.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, well, we are apes, exactly what you said.</p>
<p>So I think that there is a lot to be,</p>
<p>not to blame grandpa for that,</p>
<p>but because we can always get better.</p>
<p>Grandpa was a wild man.</p>
<p>But we have to improve a lot on that side</p>
<p>before we can claim that we are a mature civilization.</p>
<p>When you, just because you mentioned the magic,</p>
<p>when you look out there,</p>
<p>perhaps this is not a scientific question, but.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be scientific all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you said magic.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a magic to magic that is in part scientific</p>
<p>and in part, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever fills us with awe</p>
<p>as humans when we look up at the stars.</p>
<p>Do you think the universe is full of life or not?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re sitting, drinking some wine,</p>
<p>looking up at the stars and wandering as a human,</p>
<p>do you think we&rsquo;re alone</p>
<p>or do you think life is everywhere?</p>
<p>I am going to make such an unmagical response to that.</p>
<p>My response is, that&rsquo;s the scientific response.</p>
<p>That if we are alone,</p>
<p>then the universe is a statistical absurdity.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I have no doubt in my mind.</p>
<p>And that is an unscientific response as well.</p>
<p>But I have no doubt in my mind</p>
<p>that the universe is teeming with life.</p>
<p>What if it keeps dying?</p>
<p>This is what life does.</p>
<p>Unfortunately.</p>
<p>So the, yes.</p>
<p>So that extinction is, as a process,</p>
<p>as a part of the process of life,</p>
<p>extinction seems to be a fundamental,</p>
<p>both negative and positive component.</p>
<p>So what if all the complex life out there just keeps dying</p>
<p>and not making way for,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re actually a statistical anomaly</p>
<p>in us being able to survive that L in the Drake equation,</p>
<p>being able to survive long enough</p>
<p>to form complex organisms of the kind like mammals are,</p>
<p>things with brains,</p>
<p>things that are able to publish.</p>
<p>L is not about that.</p>
<p>L is about how long a civilization</p>
<p>is capable of being detectable,</p>
<p>which means that rich technologies</p>
<p>and being detectable.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a more nuanced things to L</p>
<p>because you can have intelligent civilizations</p>
<p>that are not very detectable.</p>
<p>Yeah, we had civilization for thousands of years.</p>
<p>We started to be detectable 150 years ago.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about technology,</p>
<p>technology that we can actually capture from space.</p>
<p>You become visible to your neighbors.</p>
<p>And this is all about the Fermi paradox, right?</p>
<p>It takes time, obviously,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re taking again ourselves as a model,</p>
<p>but this is the only one we have</p>
<p>to get to the point where we become detectable.</p>
<p>But look at the age of the universe.</p>
<p>Even if life as we understand it,</p>
<p>not saying even as we know it,</p>
<p>but as we can understand it,</p>
<p>started 10 billion years ago.</p>
<p>And it takes 4 billion years to get</p>
<p>to the point where it becomes detectable.</p>
<p>That means that the first planet</p>
<p>where those civilizations started off,</p>
<p>starting to be detectable</p>
<p>when we were still cyanobacteria in ponds.</p>
<p>So they were, you know,</p>
<p>throwing messages that were passing</p>
<p>above our heads at that point.</p>
<p>And those civilization, when you look at them now,</p>
<p>close to 10 billion years after the start.</p>
<p>So their son would be dead, okay?</p>
<p>In the best case scenario, they move somewhere else.</p>
<p>And what that means is that civilization</p>
<p>are going to rise, die, or move and transform themselves.</p>
<p>We can see ourselves changing.</p>
<p>We know that humans are still changing as a species.</p>
<p>The human being in 1,000 or even 500 years from now</p>
<p>might not be looking a lot like we are doing right now.</p>
<p>Who knows where we will be.</p>
<p>We might be migrating into our planetary system.</p>
<p>We might be migrating somewhere else.</p>
<p>Well, you said migrating,</p>
<p>but it seems when you look at life,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily migrate, it expands.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not or place A or place B,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s place A and place B.</p>
<p>It seems to expand.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>We are talking about the human civilization here.</p>
<p>So there are different factor.</p>
<p>If you are a cyanobacteria or any type of,</p>
<p>even a mammal that doesn&rsquo;t have the technology to escape</p>
<p>the planet we were born on,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s plan A, it&rsquo;s right there.</p>
<p>You know, whatever happens to your planet,</p>
<p>you are tied to it, you cannot escape it.</p>
<p>For humans, it&rsquo;s a little different.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s A and B or whatever we can.</p>
<p>So we have to expect that a number of the civilization,</p>
<p>extraterrestrial civilization</p>
<p>that might be technologically advanced,</p>
<p>a number of them will have disappeared</p>
<p>just because they run the course of their evolution</p>
<p>or because their son run out of fuel</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t have a way to escape</p>
<p>or they were wiped out by any kind of event.</p>
<p>And then there will be those that survive.</p>
<p>Everything I&rsquo;ve seen from life,</p>
<p>it seems obvious that there&rsquo;s life everywhere out there.</p>
<p>In fact, maybe I don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the jump from bacteria enough,</p>
<p>but it seems obvious</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s intelligent civilizations out there.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know how to define intelligence,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s beautiful complexity.</p>
<p>Like when you look at a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at enough cellular automata,</p>
<p>which is a very primitive mathematical construction</p>
<p>that when you run, complexity emerges.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at that enough to know</p>
<p>that it just seems like there&rsquo;s complexity</p>
<p>everywhere out there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m deeply puzzled by the Fermi paradox.</p>
<p>It makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>I mean, they have trivial answers to it.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t aliens at scale not shown up?</p>
<p>I think the two possible options for me</p>
<p>is either we&rsquo;re too dumb to see it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re already here.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been talking to us through processes</p>
<p>we just don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Like what we experience as life here on earth</p>
<p>is actually they&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>Aliens could be consciousness.</p>
<p>That when we feel love for one another,</p>
<p>that could be aliens.</p>
<p>When we, I don&rsquo;t know, or feel fear or whatever,</p>
<p>that could be aliens.</p>
<p>I have to agree with you.</p>
<p>None of this is scientifically provable.</p>
<p>Right now, we talked a little bit already about that.</p>
<p>But I would say that I do not adhere to the Fermi paradox</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very anthropomorphic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a typical example of seeing the universe</p>
<p>through our own eyes.</p>
<p>And this is where the limitation is.</p>
<p>Understanding what&rsquo;s going on with complexity, as you said,</p>
<p>and looking at the biophysical model</p>
<p>and theories for the nature of life,</p>
<p>I would agree that probably this extraterrestrial message</p>
<p>is all around us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not yet capable of picking it up.</p>
<p>But I think, unfortunately, even though that makes me sad,</p>
<p>the way to pick it up is by studying life here on Earth,</p>
<p>doing some of the science you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>better understand the nature of life</p>
<p>until you realize, holy crap,</p>
<p>the thing I was looking for all along</p>
<p>has been here all along, right under our nose.</p>
<p>Well, you know, a good example of that,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be an extraterrestrial civilization,</p>
<p>look at something that I really,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s real, I don&rsquo;t care,</p>
<p>because in terms of intellectual exercise,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Look at the shadow biosphere.</p>
<p>The idea that life didn&rsquo;t appear only once on Earth,</p>
<p>but there were many different pathways of it.</p>
<p>And today we know when we study the tree of life</p>
<p>that led to us, from Luca to us.</p>
<p>And the shadow biosphere is telling us that there is,</p>
<p>or there are, other pathways that came up</p>
<p>at the time where life originated,</p>
<p>but they are so different</p>
<p>that we cannot recognize them as being living.</p>
<p>And we cannot pick them up in our test</p>
<p>because our tests are being built</p>
<p>to recognize life as we know it.</p>
<p>And for me, again, I don&rsquo;t know if this theory</p>
<p>will be verified or it would be discredited,</p>
<p>but what I like about it is that it forces me</p>
<p>to think on how do I look for life?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So that starts here on our planet,</p>
<p>not even with little green men.</p>
<p>It starts with very simple life that can be so different.</p>
<p>That it might be just right in front of our nose</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>So that probably starts with the scientific humility of-</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>Realizing that we might be too biased</p>
<p>in our understanding of what is the phenomena</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to study.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like the term bias</p>
<p>because it involves some moral connotation that, you know.</p>
<p>But I understand the bias in terms of scientific pathway,</p>
<p>intellectual framework, definitely.</p>
<p>What do you think about the UFO sightings?</p>
<p>So the widespread experiences that people have</p>
<p>in seeing different phenomena that are mysterious.</p>
<p>That people project ideas about whether it&rsquo;s aliens or not,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t explain it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s pictures and data</p>
<p>and then the government is involved</p>
<p>in releasing footage and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that seems to captivate the public.</p>
<p>It always does.</p>
<p>It always do.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there are a number of things</p>
<p>that captivate people, especially children, actually.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs and aliens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a child.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are all still child at heart.</p>
<p>And so about UFOs, I am a scientist and I&rsquo;m a citizen.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a couple of things.</p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t mind talking about that at all</p>
<p>because I think as a scientist,</p>
<p>this is extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Because the thing I don&rsquo;t know, I want to learn about it.</p>
<p>This is more knowledge.</p>
<p>So we all know the statistics about UFOs.</p>
<p>95% of them are just natural phenomenon</p>
<p>or things that are being misinterpreted.</p>
<p>We know that.</p>
<p>Then you have the 2% that might be secret programs</p>
<p>by whatever government it&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Another percent, say, is about natural phenomenon</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know about yet, that we cannot explain.</p>
<p>And then there is this tiny percentage</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t fall into all these categories of thing.</p>
<p>And I think that the report about the UAPs</p>
<p>falls into the same kind of scheme,</p>
<p>except that now they have at least some patterns of speed</p>
<p>of other things that were in the report.</p>
<p>Today, we don&rsquo;t know if these sightings</p>
<p>are part of military program or actual UFOs.</p>
<p>I always run into that question</p>
<p>because, of course, as the director</p>
<p>of the Carl Sagan Center at the SETI Institute,</p>
<p>I received a number of emails about the subject.</p>
<p>People are actually confused</p>
<p>about what the SETI Institute is.</p>
<p>We are not studying UFOs.</p>
<p>We are actually looking for messages.</p>
<p>The way I put it usually is that</p>
<p>we are studying extraterrestrials in their natural habitat.</p>
<p>And the UFO people are trying to understand</p>
<p>whether they invaded our aerial space.</p>
<p>So this is two very different things.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, over the years,</p>
<p>I actually respect very much people</p>
<p>who are trying to go to the bottom of what UFO are</p>
<p>following some very scientific ways of doing this.</p>
<p>There are very, very credible agencies doing this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a folklore around UFOs.</p>
<p>And this has been a huge disservice</p>
<p>to the scientific community.</p>
<p>And this is why you have been having that much pushback</p>
<p>for a long time by the scientific community</p>
<p>because no congressman in the world</p>
<p>wants to tell their taxpayer</p>
<p>that they are supporting something</p>
<p>that looking for flying saucers.</p>
<p>And when you see what&rsquo;s happening, it&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>And I am actually concerned about that relationship</p>
<p>that people do between folklore and real search</p>
<p>for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s been so bad that until today,</p>
<p>there is no government agency</p>
<p>that is actually funding the SETI search.</p>
<p>It is a private funded endeavor.</p>
<p>What NASA funds right now, which is a progress,</p>
<p>is a search for techno signature,</p>
<p>which means that when you are looking</p>
<p>at the atmosphere of a planet,</p>
<p>you look for some disequilibrium</p>
<p>that could tell you that something is there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not going to fund an institute or whatnot</p>
<p>that is looking for messages or other things like that.</p>
<p>Is that just have to do with a taboo</p>
<p>associated with the folklore, as you said?</p>
<p>Yes, and I think there was a pushback</p>
<p>from the political arena decades ago about that.</p>
<p>At the time where all the flying saucer were coming out</p>
<p>and then the SETI Institute got started.</p>
<p>So, but now there is more of a willingness</p>
<p>to look at the UAP, UFO phenomenon</p>
<p>from a scientific standpoint.</p>
<p>So much so that the government is actually seeking</p>
<p>some help from a scientific institution.</p>
<p>And there are programs to start looking</p>
<p>into those phenomenon.</p>
<p>And as a scientist, I am interested.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m not interested in,</p>
<p>again, Carl Sagan comes back here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to believe, I want to know.</p>
<p>And so to know, you have to have a real experiment,</p>
<p>you have to have observation</p>
<p>and you have things that are done the right way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have somebody that start with,</p>
<p>what if, as a question, and then turns this what if</p>
<p>into the only argument and the only conclusion there is.</p>
<p>You understand what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>But still, I think it&rsquo;s valuable to appreciate the mystery</p>
<p>and not deny the mystery, so.</p>
<p>No, the mystery is there, but what I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>is people taking advantage of the public</p>
<p>and making money out of folklore.</p>
<p>Well, let me flip that.</p>
<p>I understand, but so there&rsquo;s a folklore</p>
<p>in like the stuff I do, AI and robotics, for example.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a clear fear terminator in movies</p>
<p>and all those kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You could say that I&rsquo;m very concerned</p>
<p>about this miscalibrated understanding of the public,</p>
<p>of what robots&rsquo; role are in society.</p>
<p>Or you could see it as a, let&rsquo;s use a metaphor of a wave.</p>
<p>You can say this giant wave that we&rsquo;ll call folklore</p>
<p>is a really bad idea, we need to avoid it,</p>
<p>we need to hide, we need to build dams.</p>
<p>Or you can be a surfer and ride the wave, as a scientist.</p>
<p>To me, the fact that people are wondering</p>
<p>about the mystery of UFOs, it means they&rsquo;re wondering.</p>
<p>No, they are.</p>
<p>But the thing, I will stop surfing that wave</p>
<p>when it comes back to bite an entire scientific discipline.</p>
<p>When it hurts the science, sure.</p>
<p>For now, the past 60 years,</p>
<p>we were not able to raise money from the government,</p>
<p>no grants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a discipline that has no postdoc or very little postdoc</p>
<p>just because there is a fear of that folklore</p>
<p>on the political arena.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t want to be associated with that</p>
<p>because they confuse the two.</p>
<p>So I stop there.</p>
<p>And as the director of the Carl Sagan Center,</p>
<p>I am just very happy to see now</p>
<p>that there is a course correction</p>
<p>in the government seeking scientific investigators</p>
<p>for this kind of issues.</p>
<p>And hopefully that will right the ship</p>
<p>I love it, I love to see it.</p>
<p>But I want, and I love our little disagreements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing so, obviously, respectfully and with love,</p>
<p>and it makes for a fun conversation.</p>
<p>But I think, you know, just like with surfing a wave,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some level of, the more you resist it,</p>
<p>the worse it is.</p>
<p>So I-</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t resist it.</p>
<p>Yes, but it happened.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t come from us, and we pay the price.</p>
<p>I just think that the role of a scientist,</p>
<p>in part, in the 21st century,</p>
<p>when we talk about social media,</p>
<p>is to direct this sense of wonder that people have</p>
<p>into a direction of the rigors of science.</p>
<p>I think we do that pretty well.</p>
<p>I would disagree.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I would say he does much better,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s other places in science where-</p>
<p>The search for life is a fairly easy place</p>
<p>to, you know, draw the wonder of people.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a profound question</p>
<p>that pretty much everybody has.</p>
<p>But I think, I just want to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that I think a lot of scientists, my colleagues, friends,</p>
<p>think that all you need to do is science.</p>
<p>All you need to do is the scientific process,</p>
<p>the peer review process, the data, and so on.</p>
<p>But I think communication is actually</p>
<p>a fundamental part of the process,</p>
<p>because it has to do with funding,</p>
<p>but it also has to do, like, we&rsquo;re a bunch of humans</p>
<p>trying to ask big questions,</p>
<p>trying to figure this whole puzzle out.</p>
<p>And curiosity is beautiful.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>We do have more public presentation at the Institute</p>
<p>than peer-reviewed articles.</p>
<p>And believe me, we have lots of peer-reviewed articles.</p>
<p>So our scientists are out there,</p>
<p>and they are sharing the wonder of discoveries.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so easy these days.</p>
<p>I mean, there is not one day.</p>
<p>Tell me about writing a book right now</p>
<p>about the search for life in the universe.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s almost every single day</p>
<p>I had to correct something in the chapters I was writing.</p>
<p>So SETI, in terms of both signatures and signals,</p>
<p>is a pretty active field?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s getting better right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting better.</p>
<p>But remember that the SETI Institute</p>
<p>is not only about the search</p>
<p>for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p>This is the historical root of the Institute.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s about 10% of what we do.</p>
<p>In fact, we are searching for life in the universe</p>
<p>from the origins of life to extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p>So 90% of everything else is exoplanet.</p>
<p>For instance, we have a good chunk of the Kepler team</p>
<p>that is actually with the SETI Institute,</p>
<p>and they are working with TESS right now.</p>
<p>Some already have some time on the GEMS web.</p>
<p>We have astrobiologists, we have astronomers.</p>
<p>And those are looking for data, for signals,</p>
<p>for planets out there outside of our solar system.</p>
<p>Go to analog places to try and understand</p>
<p>the type of life that survives</p>
<p>in planetary-type environments.</p>
<p>I mean, people are always surprised when I tell them,</p>
<p>you know, whatever flies in the solar system,</p>
<p>has flown or will be flying, we are involved.</p>
<p>So this is not something that pops in everybody&rsquo;s mind</p>
<p>when they are thinking about the SETI Institute,</p>
<p>because we started off</p>
<p>as the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p>But the Institute has really bloomed</p>
<p>into the search for life along the Drake equation,</p>
<p>all the terms of the Drake equation.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, because, by the way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying a bunch of terms,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s good to return to the basics.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re saying whatever&rsquo;s flown,</p>
<p>SETI is a part of the things that are flown.</p>
<p>So we, because we&rsquo;re using we elusive sometimes,</p>
<p>we say we humans, and sometimes we SETI.</p>
<p>So the SETI is really broadly involved.</p>
<p>A lot of the fingertips reaching out there towards the stars.</p>
<p>Think about Mars involved in landing site selection</p>
<p>in instrument that are actually on board.</p>
<p>Some of the mission in science teams, for instance,</p>
<p>Cassini, New Horizons, also missions that will be coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the search for life.</p>
<p>We do this all across the Drake equation.</p>
<p>So SETI is part of it, and it&rsquo;s our route,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s expanding a little bit right now.</p>
<p>We hope it will continue to expand.</p>
<p>So this is a good time for the institute.</p>
<p>And it also, in my mind,</p>
<p>was the very first astrobiology institute,</p>
<p>because we have this multidisciplinary approach</p>
<p>where I can bring many of the scientists</p>
<p>from different domains and disciplines</p>
<p>to think about a question.</p>
<p>And as you know,</p>
<p>discoveries happen at the nexus of disciplines.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really a privilege</p>
<p>when you are in an institute like that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve dived in volcanic lakes at high altitudes</p>
<p>to study the creatures within.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the technical, the fun,</p>
<p>the human story of that effort?</p>
<p>The image that is associated with a scientist</p>
<p>is the person with the white coat in the lab.</p>
<p>In fact, a number of us at the institute are athletes</p>
<p>doing extremes, what would be considered extreme stuff.</p>
<p>And that, I mean, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little dangerous too,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s to get data and more knowledge.</p>
<p>So there are so many stories.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where-</p>
<p>What was the first time you did a dangerous thing</p>
<p>with a volcano?</p>
<p>Oh, so the first one associated</p>
<p>to the search for life, understanding,</p>
<p>was in 2002, where I started climbing</p>
<p>those high volcanoes in the Andes</p>
<p>that are 20,000 footers.</p>
<p>The view out there is just beautiful.</p>
<p>You got, you&rsquo;re so hilarious at spending</p>
<p>almost no time on some epic things.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>Okay, how tall are these volcanoes?</p>
<p>What are you doing with a volcano?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s required to prepare for that?</p>
<p>What does a mission like that look like?</p>
<p>I mean, that is true that this is science embodied.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like athletics and it&rsquo;s science</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re studying the extreme conditions</p>
<p>of life on Earth, extreme beauty of life on Earth</p>
<p>in those conditions.</p>
<p>So what are we talking about with this volcano?</p>
<p>How big is it?</p>
<p>So remember when we were talking about</p>
<p>how do I understand how I search for life on Mars?</p>
<p>This is how it started for me.</p>
<p>And then I looked at environment,</p>
<p>in my head started going through the environments on Earth.</p>
<p>That would be good analysis.</p>
<p>And then you only have a few.</p>
<p>And the Andes in that case are some of the best</p>
<p>in the world just because of the aridity of the place</p>
<p>and the higher you go, the least atmosphere you have,</p>
<p>the more UV radiation you have.</p>
<p>And the Andes are volcanic, hydrothermal,</p>
<p>plus you have the climate change that&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>you have evaporation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a picture of Mars 3.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>And so now you are actually entering a time machine,</p>
<p>basically.</p>
<p>So remember I&rsquo;m a diver.</p>
<p>And the first time I got in 2002</p>
<p>to the places we wanted to explore,</p>
<p>all of a sudden I was standing at 14,000 foot</p>
<p>looking at 20,000 feet and saying,</p>
<p>okay, well, I need to get up there.</p>
<p>You scared?</p>
<p>No, no, because we are prepared.</p>
<p>And the only thing I didn&rsquo;t know is</p>
<p>if I was going to be able to make it to the top</p>
<p>because now you&rsquo;re dealing with high altitude.</p>
<p>You can deal with high altitude sickness.</p>
<p>You can deal with a number of things.</p>
<p>And for God&rsquo;s sake, these are volcanoes</p>
<p>and they are dormant, they are not extinct.</p>
<p>That can bite us a couple of times.</p>
<p>What was your preparation for that kind of, I mean, this is-</p>
<p>There is a lot of hiking and trekking</p>
<p>at high altitude around here, but not so high</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have anything closer</p>
<p>to those elevations around here in the US.</p>
<p>But in volcanic environment, climbing volcanoes here,</p>
<p>we have plenty of those, diving as well.</p>
<p>I am a free diver.</p>
<p>So this is where it&rsquo;s going to be hilarious</p>
<p>because I started with a complete irrational fear</p>
<p>of pressurized vessels that comes</p>
<p>from an incident in my childhood.</p>
<p>And so I became a free diver</p>
<p>to avoid having to carry oxygen tanks on my back.</p>
<p>Free diving is diving without-</p>
<p>Without anything, just your lungs, right?</p>
<p>That was, that started from childhood.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it was to the point where when I saw</p>
<p>a pressurized vessel, like a methane tanks or anything,</p>
<p>I would be, you know, going around</p>
<p>and put a lot of distance between me and that tank.</p>
<p>So I was not going to carry any oxygen tank.</p>
<p>And the first time I actually dived</p>
<p>at the summit of that lake was free diving.</p>
<p>People look at me like I&rsquo;m nuts.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I am a little bit.</p>
<p>People that work with you as well.</p>
<p>I mean, that kind of seems kind of nuts.</p>
<p>No, we knew-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a risk.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s a lot of, less of a risk</p>
<p>than getting with conventional air.</p>
<p>And I can explain that.</p>
<p>But ultimately, what decided me to certify SCUBA</p>
<p>and go over my fear was that as a scientist,</p>
<p>I needed more time at the bottom of the lake</p>
<p>to sample, you know, rationally, take my time to think.</p>
<p>And I can stay quite long enough</p>
<p>as a free diver underwater.</p>
<p>But the last thing you want to do at 20,000 feet</p>
<p>is to come up at the surface with empty lungs</p>
<p>because there is not much you can breathe out there</p>
<p>to replenish your oxygen.</p>
<p>So definitely your time underwater is cut short</p>
<p>just for safety.</p>
<p>And I realized that it was not a good trade-off for me</p>
<p>at some point.</p>
<p>So I certified SCUBA.</p>
<p>And after three years of exploring that lake free diving,</p>
<p>we finally came up with a full SCUBA diving expedition,</p>
<p>but we were diving with rebreathers,</p>
<p>which means that we dived with pure oxygen.</p>
<p>So rebreathers give you a bag</p>
<p>with stuff that looks like catalyters in it,</p>
<p>which is basically to absorb the CO2</p>
<p>that you are expelling when you&rsquo;re breathing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re recycling oxygen this way.</p>
<p>So basically you are rebreathing your own respiration.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How long can you do that?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting about that technology?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>because then that completely avoids</p>
<p>the potential issues you may have with the binds</p>
<p>when you are diving,</p>
<p>the risk of bubbles trapped in your lungs</p>
<p>because of different pressures and different gases.</p>
<p>Oh, so there&rsquo;s a complexity</p>
<p>to the flow of oxygen underwater.</p>
<p>When you are breathing regular air,</p>
<p>when you are SCUBA diving here,</p>
<p>you know that you have to do some different,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re coming back, when you are diving deep</p>
<p>and you have conventional air,</p>
<p>then you need to stop</p>
<p>so that you can equalize the gases in your lungs.</p>
<p>If you come back too fast,</p>
<p>then you can have air bubbles stuck</p>
<p>and then you can raise the binds,</p>
<p>which you can risk to be paralyzed.</p>
<p>You can raise a number of nasty issues.</p>
<p>And we wanted absolutely to avoid that.</p>
<p>So diving with pure oxygen avoids this completely.</p>
<p>And it has another benefit.</p>
<p>At high altitude is that, well,</p>
<p>the greater risk when you&rsquo;re at high altitude</p>
<p>is altitude sickness.</p>
<p>What is altitude sickness?</p>
<p>Is just you not having enough oxygen in your blood.</p>
<p>So this was a good benefit.</p>
<p>It was a good trade-off.</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to be also trained by the military.</p>
<p>So we came up with not the civilian rebreather,</p>
<p>which is the big thing on the back</p>
<p>that you carry on your back.</p>
<p>We actually were given Navy SEALs commando rebreathers.</p>
<p>You worked with Navy SEALs for this?</p>
<p>The director of military operations.</p>
<p>Yes, we were trained like astronauts for three months.</p>
<p>I spent more time.</p>
<p>I had a joke that if somebody wanted to reach me,</p>
<p>they better put a phone line at the bottom</p>
<p>of the swimming pool because this is where I was.</p>
<p>So we trained and we trained</p>
<p>and our manual about the safety was about that thick.</p>
<p>So it was a real operation.</p>
<p>That was three years into it</p>
<p>because when you are free diving in the years prior,</p>
<p>there is no risk.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any other gas in your lung</p>
<p>than what you&rsquo;re breathing.</p>
<p>The only risk is come short of air</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re in trouble,</p>
<p>which happened to me one time, seriously.</p>
<p>Tell me about that time.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you about free diving</p>
<p>before we return to the rebreathers.</p>
<p>Well, all these lakes I had altitude, they are cold.</p>
<p>They are the minimum temperature</p>
<p>that you can have on bodies of water,</p>
<p>clear bodies of water, which is four degrees C.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very cold.</p>
<p>And so you cannot-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an ice bath.</p>
<p>Yeah, somewhat, yeah.</p>
<p>So you cannot just dive with a wetsuit.</p>
<p>So the idea was to take a dry suit.</p>
<p>And I learned how to free dive with a dry suit,</p>
<p>which is really the worst thing you can do.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a wetsuit?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a dry suit?</p>
<p>So a wetsuit is usually what you use in the ocean</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not too cold.</p>
<p>You can use also a dry suit.</p>
<p>But the wetsuit basically is going to keep you warm</p>
<p>because water is getting into the suit</p>
<p>and at the contact of your skin</p>
<p>is getting to body temperature.</p>
<p>And so for a while you can dive like that.</p>
<p>And in the ocean here, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>The dry suit is the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely closed,</p>
<p>which means that you don&rsquo;t have any contact</p>
<p>with the water outside.</p>
<p>And you keep your warmth through your body temperature</p>
<p>and even clothing that you can put into it.</p>
<p>So this dry suit, they are used by diver</p>
<p>who go really deep in very cold water</p>
<p>and need to stay a long time underwater.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the bad part?</p>
<p>The bad part is that when you have those dry suit,</p>
<p>you have a lot of air that can be trapped in it.</p>
<p>Usually we do what we call burping the suit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not very pleasant expression,</p>
<p>but you get in the water</p>
<p>and as soon as you get in the water,</p>
<p>you can see the air pockets all over the place, right?</p>
<p>So you burp the suit, you open the valve</p>
<p>and the air comes out.</p>
<p>Once you have done that,</p>
<p>then you look with your lead belt</p>
<p>and you know when you&rsquo;re ready to go down.</p>
<p>And so what happened that day</p>
<p>is that I actually did burp the suit,</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t realize I burped it completely.</p>
<p>And so I went down and immediately I felt</p>
<p>the air pocket going to my legs.</p>
<p>So basically air was trapped in the suit</p>
<p>and went on my legs as I was diving like that.</p>
<p>And so I didn&rsquo;t pay too much attention to that.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re diving down?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was diving down.</p>
<p>And so I didn&rsquo;t pay too much attention about that</p>
<p>as I was busy, just an awkward position,</p>
<p>but then I wanted to turn and go up.</p>
<p>Well, no can do.</p>
<p>I was just like a buoy.</p>
<p>And I was like that.</p>
<p>So the first time I say, okay,</p>
<p>I try a second time and a third time.</p>
<p>And by the fourth time,</p>
<p>I kind of realized I was in trouble.</p>
<p>And the fifth time I say, okay,</p>
<p>now you better give it your best try.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s gonna be big trouble.</p>
<p>So this is free diving?</p>
<p>I was free diving.</p>
<p>And then you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I cannot turn around.</p>
<p>What were you feeling?</p>
<p>I mean, is there a panic or not?</p>
<p>No, there is no panic because you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You cannot afford to be panicking.</p>
<p>In fact, you are always thinking,</p>
<p>because there is training,</p>
<p>and this is the best part about training.</p>
<p>Your training allows you that space</p>
<p>to keep you cool and composed,</p>
<p>which you need to be in that kind of situation.</p>
<p>And so finally, after the fifth time,</p>
<p>I was able to rectify the position and get myself up.</p>
<p>But when I got up, my lungs were empty.</p>
<p>I had been in the water for quite some time.</p>
<p>And I knew what was going to happen.</p>
<p>So I decided to just be the plank,</p>
<p>not move and don&rsquo;t do anything,</p>
<p>just open my mouth and try to suck oxygen.</p>
<p>But obviously, oxygen at 6,000 meters, 20,000 feet,</p>
<p>there is not that much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a little, it&rsquo;s 48%</p>
<p>of what you breathe at sea level.</p>
<p>So although it was noon at that time,</p>
<p>the sky stayed pretty dark and starry</p>
<p>for about a minute or two.</p>
<p>So just stars everywhere?</p>
<p>Oh my God, yes.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>The funny thing was-</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the first time you experienced that kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, can you possibly train for that?</p>
<p>Because can you also pass out?</p>
<p>Oh, you could.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that I was already seeing dark</p>
<p>was a real sign that my brain was starved of oxygen.</p>
<p>And I had one of my friends or colleagues on the shore</p>
<p>just telling me, because I&rsquo;d been under for a little while,</p>
<p>and say, is everything okay?</p>
<p>And I remember trying to say something,</p>
<p>and I was just like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, I think, the best lie I ever, ever.</p>
<p>I get the thumb down.</p>
<p>You were lying to the friend and maybe to yourself?</p>
<p>No, because I knew I was going to be okay,</p>
<p>but it took me to be still for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Well, can you talk about freediving?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s the technical skill involved here?</p>
<p>It just seems exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p>Like for most people that swim, you go underwater.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the skill there?</p>
<p>You know, I think you probably can get good or better</p>
<p>at freediving by training.</p>
<p>So you have different techniques.</p>
<p>You can train in swimming pool,</p>
<p>and you can say, you know, frankly, for me,</p>
<p>I go at the bottom of the swimming pool and I sit there,</p>
<p>and then you have relaxation techniques.</p>
<p>Some people meditate.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I am not a good person that can meditate,</p>
<p>or if I do, I don&rsquo;t know about it.</p>
<p>But my way of doing things</p>
<p>and taking my mind off the situation I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>is by singing in my head.</p>
<p>I love music or hearing music,</p>
<p>and in fact, knowing the kind of song I&rsquo;m singing,</p>
<p>I know about the length of time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m staying underwater as well.</p>
<p>So this is how, you know, so this is my own way.</p>
<p>People have different ways.</p>
<p>What kind of music are we talking about?</p>
<p>All sorts of music.</p>
<p>Can be classical, can be pop music, you know, just songs.</p>
<p>When you really know that you are relaxed,</p>
<p>and something I experienced actually at 20,000 feet,</p>
<p>which was the greatest experience of my life</p>
<p>in those terms, is when you forget</p>
<p>that you have water around you.</p>
<p>At that point, you cannot tell whether you are the water</p>
<p>or water is you.</p>
<p>There is actually no separation anymore.</p>
<p>And I felt that when I was training in the swimming pool.</p>
<p>I never could have imagined that I would feel that way once</p>
<p>on top of that volcano, and it happened,</p>
<p>and it was absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>It was, you know, we were talking about</p>
<p>how life consciousness permeates the universe.</p>
<p>At that point in time, on that volcano, that day,</p>
<p>it took me by surprise.</p>
<p>I was not expecting it.</p>
<p>Everything around me, the lake was arctic blue</p>
<p>with all the ray of the suns, you can,</p>
<p>you could tell them apart, every single one of them.</p>
<p>I was surrounded by golden darts,</p>
<p>and it was the most incredible experience.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s that kind of environment</p>
<p>that led me to just, you know,</p>
<p>go into whatever state of meditation or whatnot,</p>
<p>but all of a sudden, there was no separation anymore</p>
<p>between me, the water, the volcano.</p>
<p>And if I came with questions, they didn&rsquo;t matter anymore</p>
<p>because for that fraction of a second,</p>
<p>it seemed that I had all the answers in the universe.</p>
<p>Was it the connectedness with everything?</p>
<p>You can call it that way.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know what it means, you know, literally,</p>
<p>but it is that moment where you feel that it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore.</p>
<p>It was absolute peace, absolute understanding,</p>
<p>and it was incredible.</p>
<p>It was an absolute awareness.</p>
<p>Could you describe it as beautiful?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t go beyond that.</p>
<p>I think that there is clearly, in my mind today,</p>
<p>no words that can express how perfect this was.</p>
<p>Does that start to speak to why you love diving?</p>
<p>Or is there something special about that place,</p>
<p>diving at such elevations and volcanoes?</p>
<p>You know, I started diving pretty much,</p>
<p>this is the first thing I did when I was near water.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a very fun little incident</p>
<p>with my parents, me being on the shore of a lake</p>
<p>on vacation, I was three years old, maybe.</p>
<p>And I had these little lifesavers on my arms,</p>
<p>and my parents were not watching.</p>
<p>And in my little brain, I still can remember today,</p>
<p>saying, well, nothing bad can happen to me.</p>
<p>I cannot drown if I go underwater.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s the logic of a three-year-old.</p>
<p>Yes, it kind of works.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s pretty brilliant.</p>
<p>So I removed the lifesavers that I had,</p>
<p>and I just went in the water.</p>
<p>My mom said before she could do anything,</p>
<p>I was under, and it was like a natural thing.</p>
<p>And for me, I felt immediately at home.</p>
<p>And you know, as little as I was, completely.</p>
<p>And it goes beyond that.</p>
<p>You know, this sense of connectedness,</p>
<p>or oneness, or whatever, I always felt good underwater.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter really if it&rsquo;s 20,000 feet.</p>
<p>The thing that matters at that point</p>
<p>is that you need to get there.</p>
<p>So you need to get with all the gears,</p>
<p>with your hiking, trekking equipment,</p>
<p>high mountaineering gears.</p>
<p>And when you get on top of that,</p>
<p>you have to remove all that and don a suit.</p>
<p>Is there something you can speak to</p>
<p>the challenging aspects of that process?</p>
<p>Or is it just like this rigorous process</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s well-designed, that you have to go through,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t think one step at a time?</p>
<p>This is where most of the risk is,</p>
<p>because you can be well-prepared,</p>
<p>but for one reason or another, you get sick, you know?</p>
<p>And you can get sick not only</p>
<p>because of high altitude sickness.</p>
<p>It can be a number of things.</p>
<p>Or you can be tired, or you can catch a cold.</p>
<p>And then of course you have the mountain itself.</p>
<p>We had a magnitude 7.8 earthquake</p>
<p>hitting one day when we were 50 meters away from the summit.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t obviously plan for that.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the acts of God.</p>
<p>You know, working with NASA,</p>
<p>although I am the director of the SETI Institute,</p>
<p>my grants are coming from NASA, so I&rsquo;m a NASA contractor.</p>
<p>And every time we go to those environments,</p>
<p>we have to go through the rigorous process</p>
<p>of training with NASA and checking all the boxes for safety.</p>
<p>So they are training and training and training us.</p>
<p>And I have to thank them,</p>
<p>because a lot of those trainings</p>
<p>are the things that are in your brain.</p>
<p>When these kinds of things happen,</p>
<p>you know how to react and you are not freaking out.</p>
<p>But in all of the things they are training us for,</p>
<p>you have the green risk, the yellow risk, and the red risk.</p>
<p>So the green risks are basically the don&rsquo;t be stupid</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t do the kind of thing</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t be doing at home.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s jumping, you know, on rocks that are unstable.</p>
<p>You can tweak your ankle, you know.</p>
<p>And then you have other risks like high altitude sickness,</p>
<p>how you prepare for that, how you recognize that.</p>
<p>These are the yellow risks.</p>
<p>And then the red risks.</p>
<p>The red risks are what they call the acts of gods,</p>
<p>the kind of thing that they can happen,</p>
<p>you know there is nothing you can do about it,</p>
<p>and then you accept that when you do that.</p>
<p>So those are volcanic eruptions</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in this kind of environment,</p>
<p>earthquakes and everything that,</p>
<p>and avalanches, for instance.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re in this giant mountain and it&rsquo;s shaking.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not shaking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the interesting part of it.</p>
<p>There was a whole background of things</p>
<p>that happened that day when we started off,</p>
<p>but we got to 50 meters from the summit</p>
<p>and I have part of my logistics team</p>
<p>that is at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>And being so close to the summit,</p>
<p>we have to go under a overhang of lava.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just like we are just under this big vault of lava</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually beautiful.</p>
<p>If you want something beautiful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the Altiplano seen from 20,000 feet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the colors?</p>
<p>What are we looking at?</p>
<p>The colors are that of early earth,</p>
<p>which means primordial earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ochres, yellows, oranges, browns,</p>
<p>with a dark blue sky.</p>
<p>And so you are just, you know, it&rsquo;s a time machine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just out there and you&rsquo;re climbing 42 degree slopes.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden I&rsquo;m right next behind the guide</p>
<p>and the guide has been with us, it&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve been together for 10 years</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s starting to do that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t discuss.</p>
<p>When Macario do that, you know, I listen</p>
<p>and I ask the team to do the same thing</p>
<p>where maybe half a dozen.</p>
<p>And then I went to talk to him and say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on the radio.</p>
<p>And then he gives me the radio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to my logistics chief officer</p>
<p>who was at the bottom and he say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having a tremendous earthquake.</p>
<p>He was saying that the, actually the ground was waving.</p>
<p>It was so bad.</p>
<p>And he was freaking out because he said,</p>
<p>everything is avalanching and I&rsquo;m very puzzled</p>
<p>because we are in a very dangerous part of the volcano.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I turn around and then this is when I realized</p>
<p>there is dust absolutely everywhere.</p>
<p>Everything that I saw two minutes before it&rsquo;s gone,</p>
<p>just disappear into a wall of dust,</p>
<p>but nothing&rsquo;s happening where we are.</p>
<p>And our friends down, they were freaking out</p>
<p>because they were seeing everything avalanching</p>
<p>and especially the other side of the mountain</p>
<p>we were on was avalanching.</p>
<p>So they have no visuals.</p>
<p>They have no visual.</p>
<p>They thought that we are caught in the avalanching.</p>
<p>So I said, no.</p>
<p>But some, so at that point I said.</p>
<p>They thought you were screwed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, so if this is what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m taking everybody to the summit</p>
<p>because we have a very large crater</p>
<p>that will take care of avalanching.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be safe.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m waiting for the aftershock</p>
<p>because this is what you do when you have earthquakes.</p>
<p>So here we go, taking everybody in the crater.</p>
<p>And now you have half a dozen scientists</p>
<p>in the crater with the crater lake.</p>
<p>And this is why we came for.</p>
<p>So we just had a 7.8 earthquake.</p>
<p>And what do you think they do?</p>
<p>Well, of course they do the science they came to do.</p>
<p>So the only thing is that I couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because my radio was only working</p>
<p>when I was on the rim of the crater.</p>
<p>But I had a little assistant with me,</p>
<p>a young Bolivian teenager.</p>
<p>He had been shadowing me for three weeks.</p>
<p>So he knew exactly what to do.</p>
<p>And he said, Natalie, no problem.</p>
<p>Give me your bag.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do the sampling for you.</p>
<p>So I was monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>Were you scared?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t at that point.</p>
<p>And there was another moment.</p>
<p>My friend downstairs, I could, you know.</p>
<p>At the foot.</p>
<p>At the foot, yeah.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve known each other.</p>
<p>As I said, we&rsquo;re family.</p>
<p>This team is family.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve known each other.</p>
<p>I am the godmother of kids.</p>
<p>So we are close.</p>
<p>And I could feel for the first time in my life</p>
<p>that he actually was scared.</p>
<p>And he was calling me every 30 seconds, telling me stuff.</p>
<p>I say, you have to stop this now.</p>
<p>Just call me to give me information</p>
<p>that is useful for me to make decisions.</p>
<p>And so I say, okay, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>He tells me, you know, there is still avalanching, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then a few minutes later, he calls me and say,</p>
<p>I think that Lascar is erupting.</p>
<p>So now I have to tell you, we are on a volcano.</p>
<p>The next volcano, we share a slope with it,</p>
<p>is a little lower,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the most temperamental volcano</p>
<p>of the entire chain.</p>
<p>And this one has a history of eruption.</p>
<p>And then my friend is telling me</p>
<p>that the volcano seems to be starting to erupt.</p>
<p>If that volcano goes off, we have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>That got my attention.</p>
<p>So if you say scared, I would say that</p>
<p>I got the realization that what that meant.</p>
<p>I went cold for like a fraction of a second,</p>
<p>but that meant that just my adrenaline started to kick in.</p>
<p>And it was a very, very strange experience</p>
<p>because now you have tunnel vision.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about survival.</p>
<p>And I say, okay, now you are going to tell me</p>
<p>what I need to know, you know.</p>
<p>Tell me, what do you see?</p>
<p>Say, I see smoke.</p>
<p>Say, what kind of smoke?</p>
<p>He say, it&rsquo;s white.</p>
<p>I say, no big deal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s water vapor.</p>
<p>Okay, where is it going?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to Argentina.</p>
<p>That was the opposite direction of where we are.</p>
<p>I said, okay, I&rsquo;m staying where I am</p>
<p>because right now there is no danger.</p>
<p>And there was still the issue of the aftershock.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to have the team caught in the gully,</p>
<p>in the central gully of the volcano</p>
<p>with an avalanche coming at us.</p>
<p>So we stayed there.</p>
<p>And he called me after that and say,</p>
<p>well, you know, it&rsquo;s still going to Argentina.</p>
<p>Fine, okay.</p>
<p>And then a little later, he calls me and say,</p>
<p>Natalie, things are changing here.</p>
<p>I say, okay, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>I say, well, the cloud is a little yellow.</p>
<p>And I was thinking myself, shit.</p>
<p>What does it mean when it&rsquo;s yellow?</p>
<p>Sulfur.</p>
<p>And then when you have sulfur mixed with the water vapor</p>
<p>or the water in your lungs, this turns into sulfuric acid.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re really screwed.</p>
<p>And I say, okay, where-</p>
<p>Thank you for the information.</p>
<p>Where is the cloud going?</p>
<p>He said, the wing is shifting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming your direction.</p>
<p>So yeah, that was a day like that, you know?</p>
<p>And I am talking to him on the radio and I&rsquo;m turning around.</p>
<p>And as I turned around, I see the cloud starting to pop</p>
<p>on the opposite side of the rim, you know?</p>
<p>So at that time we had no choice anymore</p>
<p>because now you have to figure out</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to kill you first.</p>
<p>So there was the risk or the potential of an avalanche.</p>
<p>But at least you can see the rocks.</p>
<p>The gas is going to kill you before you can see it.</p>
<p>So I called everybody back.</p>
<p>We gather our stuff.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t give too much detail,</p>
<p>but I say it&rsquo;s time to go downhill and fast.</p>
<p>Which we did.</p>
<p>We stopped only when we were at mid-camp.</p>
<p>And then at that point we saw the cloud</p>
<p>just completely covering the summit where we were.</p>
<p>So we did well to bail out.</p>
<p>But that was 500 meter higher than we were.</p>
<p>So we are safe.</p>
<p>I was just making sure that you would not go down the slope</p>
<p>where we were safe.</p>
<p>So we stayed and just rested for a little while.</p>
<p>And after that we descended.</p>
<p>And it was all on adrenaline.</p>
<p>I can tell you what, I had two of my crew with headaches.</p>
<p>Part of one of them was because of the altitude.</p>
<p>We climbed really fast.</p>
<p>The other one was because of the cloud.</p>
<p>She was the closest to the cloud when it happened.</p>
<p>So we descended fast.</p>
<p>Wow, that was close.</p>
<p>That was close.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting how the human body and mind works</p>
<p>because I know that from the moment my friend told me</p>
<p>that the volcano seemed to be erupting,</p>
<p>I was going on adrenaline.</p>
<p>But when we got close to them and I saw him,</p>
<p>we were getting close to the cars,</p>
<p>I saw him come in towards me.</p>
<p>And the slope, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>all the adrenaline went away.</p>
<p>I was a mess.</p>
<p>I had to find the first rock and sit down.</p>
<p>It was gone, I mean.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>So you just basically physically and mentally collapsed</p>
<p>once you saw.</p>
<p>Absolutely, there was nothing left of me.</p>
<p>I got in the car and I felt,</p>
<p>in the car as we were heading back towards our camp,</p>
<p>I could have passed out.</p>
<p>I really fought back.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not the kind of passing out really easy.</p>
<p>But there was nothing left.</p>
<p>I had no energy, no nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fabulous how you react</p>
<p>and how this is embedded in your brain</p>
<p>from eons of evolution,</p>
<p>of reaction to a dangerous situation, basically.</p>
<p>The drive to survive.</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>You just told us one heck of a story.</p>
<p>And as you said, such story comes along</p>
<p>with many of the diving expeditions that you do.</p>
<p>But on the science side,</p>
<p>what is that world that simulates,</p>
<p>that travels back in time into the Martian landscape?</p>
<p>What does the science reveal?</p>
<p>So the science reveals that life is resilient.</p>
<p>When I started that project, I told my husband,</p>
<p>I said, this is going to be very fast.</p>
<p>We are going in such nasty environment</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not going to find anything.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll be back home fairly soon.</p>
<p>So 20 years later,</p>
<p>we are still studying those environments.</p>
<p>So that was your gut feeling like nothing,</p>
<p>not much can possibly survive in those conditions.</p>
<p>The UV environment is so nasty.</p>
<p>But there you find the same microorganism</p>
<p>that made the very first fossils on Earth</p>
<p>3.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>And they keep surviving.</p>
<p>They developed an adaptation,</p>
<p>Swiss army knife, if you prefer.</p>
<p>And so you learn about that.</p>
<p>You learn about what they are,</p>
<p>how they adapt through times</p>
<p>and through environmental changes,</p>
<p>which is really important.</p>
<p>What are their signatures?</p>
<p>We learn to recognize them.</p>
<p>We learn what kind of instrument we need,</p>
<p>what kind of signature,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s chemical or morphological or whatnot.</p>
<p>So basically we learn how to explore.</p>
<p>But I would say that to me,</p>
<p>and this is a realization,</p>
<p>interestingly enough that came three years</p>
<p>into the project,</p>
<p>I really woke up literally one morning saying,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve been coming here for three years now,</p>
<p>try and understand how to search for life on Mars.</p>
<p>But what this place is showing us</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s happening right here, right now</p>
<p>on our own planet.</p>
<p>And by exploring those extreme environments,</p>
<p>we are also reaching to places not too many people go.</p>
<p>And so we are learning more about our own biospheres</p>
<p>and the diversity of our own life here on Earth.</p>
<p>So these are the two main thing, you know,</p>
<p>that I would say.</p>
<p>What kind of life survives up there?</p>
<p>On top of those volcanoes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about bacteria, you know, mostly.</p>
<p>Is there something specific about that bacteria</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to be so rugged?</p>
<p>Yes, they have adapted to very high UV radiation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only because they are at high altitude,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because early Earth didn&rsquo;t have an ozone layer.</p>
<p>So when those, the ancestors of those bacteria originated,</p>
<p>they have to survive a world</p>
<p>where you had lots of short UV coming down at the surface.</p>
<p>And also lots of hydrothermal environment,</p>
<p>you know, volcanoes and hot water, lots of salt.</p>
<p>And you see all these toolbox still embedded</p>
<p>in those microorganism today, 4 billion years later,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>And depending on the environment,</p>
<p>they are going to switch some of these defenses adaptation</p>
<p>on or off.</p>
<p>The UV situation there is so nasty</p>
<p>that here you have bacterias like that.</p>
<p>I know bacteria, you find them everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really something you find all over the place.</p>
<p>But if you find them here in California,</p>
<p>they will turn their protection against UV</p>
<p>during the day in summer,</p>
<p>and they will switch it off at the end of the day.</p>
<p>There in the Andes, it&rsquo;s so nasty</p>
<p>that that thing stays on all the time.</p>
<p>But if you take samples and bring them back here</p>
<p>and start to culture them,</p>
<p>like we did on top of a building,</p>
<p>leaving them, you will see the second generation</p>
<p>of this organism,</p>
<p>they are starting to switch on and off again.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re extremely adaptable, extremely rugged,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they are still here.</p>
<p>And probably that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>because life finds ways.</p>
<p>So is there some degree to which</p>
<p>the harshness of the conditions</p>
<p>enables the flourishing of life versus shuts it down?</p>
<p>Well, it will shut down those that cannot survive.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a statement</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kept in obvious right there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>And this is what evolution is, right?</p>
<p>So they are here because they were the most adaptable.</p>
<p>And so evolution is going to show the path of the fittest.</p>
<p>The one that cannot resist,</p>
<p>they might have a good time for a little while,</p>
<p>but then, you know, we&rsquo;ve seen this at much different scale</p>
<p>and with complex life.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, 100,000 years ago,</p>
<p>Neanderthal was side by side by Homo sapiens,</p>
<p>but Neanderthal was completely adapted to a cold earth,</p>
<p>to a glacial earth of the end of the Pleistocene.</p>
<p>And when conditions change, it couldn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>You think, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still some mysteries around that, right?</p>
<p>Like exactly what were the harshness of the conditions?</p>
<p>I still really suspicious.</p>
<p>What did Homo sapiens do?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I really want to know.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Some shady stuff that happened.</p>
<p>Shady stuff happened.</p>
<p>They met, they bred together,</p>
<p>they fought against each other.</p>
<p>What humans do.</p>
<p>You had to expect that.</p>
<p>But the thing is that Neanderthal was completely adapted</p>
<p>for a very long time to live at the edge of those glaciers.</p>
<p>There were probably in a weakened situation</p>
<p>when Homo sapiens came and started to spread.</p>
<p>So basically this is what life does.</p>
<p>It adapts, and if it cannot adapt anymore,</p>
<p>it disappears and something else takes over.</p>
<p>You hold the women&rsquo;s world record</p>
<p>for diving at altitudes, both scuba and free diving.</p>
<p>So I have to ask,</p>
<p>can you describe the details of those records?</p>
<p>I never looked for those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not after records at all.</p>
<p>In fact, I didn&rsquo;t know I had broken those records</p>
<p>when that happened.</p>
<p>We did that as part of our expedition,</p>
<p>our scientific expedition.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically sport in the name of science versus-</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s science in the name of science,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a very physical thing that you have to do.</p>
<p>So we trained ourselves like athletes.</p>
<p>Yeah, to get the job done.</p>
<p>To get the job done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re holding your breath underwater</p>
<p>for a very long time with free diving.</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>Do you think in terms of time,</p>
<p>is there layers where you know through training</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a good place?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you take time off and you get rusty.</p>
<p>And I have not been diving in a while,</p>
<p>so probably I need to go back to the drawing board</p>
<p>and the bottom of the swimming pool.</p>
<p>But having training from the past,</p>
<p>I think it will pick up much more faster then.</p>
<p>Basically, I would never at those altitude,</p>
<p>I would never go over three minutes.</p>
<p>That would be suicidal.</p>
<p>So the altitude is much tougher</p>
<p>than the pool back at ground level?</p>
<p>It is, but it&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s because when you come up</p>
<p>and you have to get oxygen.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s not the going in the water.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m underwater, I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>And if I wanted, I could stay longer,</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t be very wise.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written about the history of life on Mars.</p>
<p>Like you said, you&rsquo;re kind of exploring that</p>
<p>by looking at the lakes here.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s been life on Mars?</p>
<p>Do you think there is life on Mars?</p>
<p>Right, so when you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>the environment of Mars early on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fairly similar to that of early Earth.</p>
<p>Never was exactly the same</p>
<p>because Mars was always farther from the sun</p>
<p>than the Earth, right?</p>
<p>So it was always a little cooler,</p>
<p>but you have to imagine maybe the Arctic during the summer,</p>
<p>that would be early Mars with a lot going on for it</p>
<p>in terms of environment,</p>
<p>very favorable to even life as we know it.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know how fast life happened on Earth.</p>
<p>There are signs right now showing</p>
<p>that it might have actually originated</p>
<p>only 200 million years after the crust cooled down.</p>
<p>Yeah, this still has to be verified,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the closest.</p>
<p>And these are indirect evidence,</p>
<p>like carbon left by the activity of life, not life itself.</p>
<p>And there is a twist in the story for Mars</p>
<p>is that it seems that Mars came together as a planet</p>
<p>faster than the Earth</p>
<p>and had water earlier than the Earth.</p>
<p>So it may be that Mars was habitable</p>
<p>and might have seen the beginning of life</p>
<p>earlier than the Earth.</p>
<p>So all of this is speculation.</p>
<p>Obviously we haven&rsquo;t found any evidence</p>
<p>or solid evidence yet.</p>
<p>I would say unambiguous evidence,</p>
<p>but unambiguous evidence of life</p>
<p>is going to be something interesting to prove</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know what life is, remember?</p>
<p>So I always joke that the only way we would know</p>
<p>that there is life on Mars</p>
<p>if there was a rabbit jumping in front of the rover,</p>
<p>but we might be gathering,</p>
<p>we have what we call a ladder of life detection,</p>
<p>which is that you have a series of rungs</p>
<p>that you need to go through</p>
<p>that actually are not proving you that you discovered life,</p>
<p>but are making the possibility</p>
<p>that what you discovered was made only by the environment</p>
<p>more and more improbable.</p>
<p>So we are trying to prove the contrary, right?</p>
<p>So this is what we have right now.</p>
<p>And as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,</p>
<p>considering all the unknowns we have,</p>
<p>I think there was as much chance</p>
<p>that life originated on Mars than it did on Earth.</p>
<p>And if it was at the surface,</p>
<p>then it got in trouble after 500 million years</p>
<p>because of the disappearance of the magnetosphere,</p>
<p>the loss of the magnetosphere and the atmosphere.</p>
<p>But as we know, you know,</p>
<p>life doesn&rsquo;t only stay in one place.</p>
<p>As soon as it&rsquo;s out there, it&rsquo;s going to adapt,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to give itself more chance to survive.</p>
<p>And that to me means that if life appeared,</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s still there</p>
<p>and probably on the ground where it can be, you know,</p>
<p>in an environment that&rsquo;s more stable.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how stability is good or not,</p>
<p>might not be so good,</p>
<p>but they might be in a different type of metabolism</p>
<p>through dormancy, you know,</p>
<p>waiting for different climate cycles.</p>
<p>And there is the fact that Mars changes</p>
<p>a lot faster than the Earth</p>
<p>and climate changes are a lot stronger in magnitude.</p>
<p>So there might be a place on Mars,</p>
<p>we know that there is a place on Mars,</p>
<p>deeper in the subsurface where temperature and pressure</p>
<p>are good for liquid water to stay there.</p>
<p>So these would be good places for a stable habitat</p>
<p>over time, no matter what happens at the surface.</p>
<p>But if life is also caught</p>
<p>between that deep zone and the surface,</p>
<p>there is an active layer.</p>
<p>There is a lot of ice in the subsurface of Mars.</p>
<p>And when the climate changes,</p>
<p>when the obliquity goes beyond 30 degrees,</p>
<p>then at that point,</p>
<p>you will have some activation of that zone.</p>
<p>You have thawing of the ice.</p>
<p>So all this region is reactivated</p>
<p>and maybe that&rsquo;s a way where you have pathways for life</p>
<p>to move from the deep zone to closer to the surface.</p>
<p>This is why I am one of those scientists</p>
<p>who thinks that life might not be so far</p>
<p>from the surface than we think.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have to dig very far to find it.</p>
<p>We probably won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m-</p>
<p>That would be so amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of that just because of this experience</p>
<p>as well of extreme environments.</p>
<p>You have to sit and look and listen basically.</p>
<p>The story of my life,</p>
<p>if I want to understand where microbes are located on Mars,</p>
<p>I have to become the microbe, right?</p>
<p>This is the thought experiment.</p>
<p>And if I want to understand where ET is,</p>
<p>then I have to become ET.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a big stretch.</p>
<p>But in extreme environment,</p>
<p>you sit in the desert for a while</p>
<p>and you just try to understand where the wind&rsquo;s coming from,</p>
<p>where the humidity, when it&rsquo;s showing up.</p>
<p>And then you start to understand</p>
<p>the patterns of those things.</p>
<p>What are the useful signals that you need for survival?</p>
<p>You need to know where water is,</p>
<p>where the source of energy is going to be drawn from.</p>
<p>You need to find shelters.</p>
<p>And shelters don&rsquo;t mean that,</p>
<p>for instance, you can have a water column</p>
<p>of a lake or a river or whatnot, or the ocean.</p>
<p>It can be also a very thin layer of dust,</p>
<p>or it can be a translucent rock.</p>
<p>And you see what we call endoliths.</p>
<p>These are the same cyanobacteria,</p>
<p>but a different version of them.</p>
<p>They live inside the rocks, inside those crystals,</p>
<p>because they have the best of life.</p>
<p>They are into translucent crystals</p>
<p>so that they receive the light from the sun.</p>
<p>They can do the photosynthesis,</p>
<p>but there is enough of that crystal</p>
<p>so that the nasty UV is being stopped.</p>
<p>And they are in their little house.</p>
<p>And when you are looking at temperature within those rocks,</p>
<p>they tend to make it toastier than the outside temperature.</p>
<p>So there is a lot of things going on.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying for Mars is that,</p>
<p>yeah, right now you don&rsquo;t have an atmosphere</p>
<p>very much, 160 times thinner than the Earth.</p>
<p>Six millibars is really not much, but it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>But you still have a lot of UV, the short UV,</p>
<p>like the nasty one, UVA, UVB, UVC,</p>
<p>that can really mess up your DNA</p>
<p>and destroy it beyond repair.</p>
<p>But as soon as you have a little alcove</p>
<p>into a rock or a cliff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be looking at those places,</p>
<p>but you have to understand Mars,</p>
<p>or any other planet for that matter,</p>
<p>at the level that matters for the microbe.</p>
<p>And it is.</p>
<p>So then you need-</p>
<p>Be one with the microbe.</p>
<p>Be one with the microbes,</p>
<p>which means that we have lots of orbital data,</p>
<p>which is good to understand habitability</p>
<p>at the planet level or at the regional level.</p>
<p>But we have very little data right now</p>
<p>that is very useful to understand habitability</p>
<p>at the scale that matters for the microbes</p>
<p>at this point in time.</p>
<p>So we need to do a better job with that.</p>
<p>My idea is to have arrays of environmental stations</p>
<p>that could have a lot of benefits.</p>
<p>One would be to give us that vision for the microbes.</p>
<p>That would be good for us through biology.</p>
<p>And second-</p>
<p>So a collection of stations on Mars.</p>
<p>On Mars, yeah.</p>
<p>That give us a good map of the planet.</p>
<p>High resolution.</p>
<p>We can do that regionally.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s good for us through biology,</p>
<p>for the search for life on Mars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good about how to learn where microbes could be</p>
<p>that can be a problem for contamination both ways.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s good for planetary protection.</p>
<p>And since those station would have communication</p>
<p>capabilities on them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s excellent for human exploration</p>
<p>because not only you have weather stations</p>
<p>all over the place that can tell your astronauts,</p>
<p>learn the pattern when it&rsquo;s a good time to go out</p>
<p>or not go out.</p>
<p>And also how to communicate when they go and do sorties.</p>
<p>So there are a number of things we can do</p>
<p>that can tell you lots of information.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s rewind the clock a little bit.</p>
<p>You grew up in Paris.</p>
<p>I was just there.</p>
<p>Helen McDonald in her New York Times</p>
<p>amazing profile piece of you</p>
<p>writes that your teenage years were troubled.</p>
<p>So how did the challenging early years</p>
<p>make the human being the scientist that you are today?</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>I think that this is what&rsquo;s taking me</p>
<p>on top of those big mountains.</p>
<p>And the irony is for me to be looking</p>
<p>for the origin and nature of life</p>
<p>because I was so close to losing it.</p>
<p>But to me, that was a great lesson learned</p>
<p>and that helped me see through the beauty of life.</p>
<p>Going on the other side of that,</p>
<p>it became really what made me</p>
<p>and helped me go through absolutely everything</p>
<p>and anything in life.</p>
<p>Climb mountains and tell me</p>
<p>there is something I want to know.</p>
<p>And I am going to give it my best</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t give up and I won&rsquo;t give in.</p>
<p>And this is a message that I carried all my life</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m so very grateful that I did</p>
<p>because all these things that I would have missed</p>
<p>if I hadn&rsquo;t done that.</p>
<p>This is something that I wrote in my first book</p>
<p>and part of it is the reason why I wrote it.</p>
<p>Just because I felt that there were messages in my path.</p>
<p>Oftentimes teenagers are troubled.</p>
<p>It can be one way or another.</p>
<p>Or if it&rsquo;s not a troubled teenage,</p>
<p>you have times in your life where you doubt,</p>
<p>where you just waving your arm and say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the purpose?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the reason why I carry on?</p>
<p>And when I see all the things that I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>the dream that I was able to fulfill,</p>
<p>what a waste it would have been, you know?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, there was a point in your life</p>
<p>where you thought about suicide.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And I did more than thinking about it,</p>
<p>but I was a lucky one.</p>
<p>For some reason, I&rsquo;m still here.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know why, but I&rsquo;m still here.</p>
<p>And the lesson for me was that never ever again,</p>
<p>because you have to give tomorrow a chance.</p>
<p>You never can think about tomorrow</p>
<p>in the terms of the present.</p>
<p>You never know what can happen.</p>
<p>You know what is going to happen</p>
<p>if you go through what you want to do.</p>
<p>Tomorrow&rsquo;s never happening, you know?</p>
<p>And I had, I had a, the other lesson</p>
<p>came a few years later,</p>
<p>where actually somebody was drowning</p>
<p>and I went after that person.</p>
<p>I almost died that day too, not that I wanted to,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just because the condition</p>
<p>were very, very difficult.</p>
<p>That person died from there,</p>
<p>although we took him out of the water.</p>
<p>But I had a lot of difficulty coming out.</p>
<p>I came out, but then I thought a lot about that guy.</p>
<p>He was in his thirties.</p>
<p>And it was like a sort of a echo from a few years before</p>
<p>telling me that person would never have a tomorrow.</p>
<p>That person would never be able to fulfill his dream</p>
<p>or even have dreams of any kind.</p>
<p>And I was here and I was going to give myself</p>
<p>the best chance to fulfill all the dreams I wanted to</p>
<p>and go after all the questions I wanted to.</p>
<p>And this is what kept me going now, you know?</p>
<p>So the advice there is even if you don&rsquo;t see a why,</p>
<p>an answer to the why question, why live today.</p>
<p>Give tomorrow a chance, always.</p>
<p>Do you think about your death today?</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been so close with it so many times.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you know, that&rsquo;s part of life.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>If something happens to me while I&rsquo;m doing the stuff I love,</p>
<p>what a way of going.</p>
<p>This will happen wherever it catches me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>It will be what it will be.</p>
<p>And I had the best of all masters for that.</p>
<p>I had my husband.</p>
<p>My husband and I were 44 years apart in age.</p>
<p>And it was just a pure love story.</p>
<p>And he never looked at his age,</p>
<p>never thought about himself or defined himself by his age.</p>
<p>In fact, he reinvented a life for himself</p>
<p>at an age where everybody retires.</p>
<p>We met when he was 66.</p>
<p>And that was a blessing and a curse,</p>
<p>but a blessing, most of it,</p>
<p>because we took every single day as if it was the last.</p>
<p>So we enjoyed life.</p>
<p>And right now, it&rsquo;s not so much, you know,</p>
<p>I have to really think of him.</p>
<p>It just passed away this August, last August.</p>
<p>And for me, it&rsquo;s more like I have to draw from his example,</p>
<p>on him always telling me,</p>
<p>look forward, trust life, be happy, live.</p>
<p>You know, today, every single day,</p>
<p>I have to remind several times a day of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>But he had the recipe.</p>
<p>He never thought about death,</p>
<p>because when you start thinking too much about death,</p>
<p>that prevents you from living.</p>
<p>Do you miss him?</p>
<p>Oh, gosh, we were so close.</p>
<p>I think we were, it&rsquo;s more like one spirit in two bodies.</p>
<p>We were that close.</p>
<p>So missing him doesn&rsquo;t even cut it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the toughest mountain I ever climbed.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love in the human condition?</p>
<p>I think, I hope,</p>
<p>that this is the force that drives the universe.</p>
<p>Although, you know,</p>
<p>we might be experiencing the other side of it,</p>
<p>maybe just to learn how important love is.</p>
<p>That might be it, you know?</p>
<p>For me, my experience with my husband,</p>
<p>where I never had to wake up every single morning,</p>
<p>ever wondering if I was loved.</p>
<p>I had to look in his eyes</p>
<p>and him looking back at me to know it, you know?</p>
<p>So when you get to that point</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t question it anymore,</p>
<p>I would hope for humanity to reach that point</p>
<p>where you can feel the same love</p>
<p>for the person that is unknown in the street,</p>
<p>that you feel for the people you love.</p>
<p>I think that at that point,</p>
<p>we are going to be reaching the maturity</p>
<p>of that civilization we are hoping for.</p>
<p>And seeing the universe through love.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t run spacecrafts, of course,</p>
<p>but putting love into our intent</p>
<p>of going into and settling into another planet</p>
<p>instead of, oh my God,</p>
<p>we need to escape because we are freaking,</p>
<p>messing up with our own planet.</p>
<p>I think that this is the answer to so many things.</p>
<p>So, is there a part of you</p>
<p>that maybe just a little bit</p>
<p>wants to step foot on Mars, like you personally?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, of course, I&rsquo;m curious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a scientist and I&rsquo;ve been working on Mars.</p>
<p>I was actually privileged to be working on Gusev Crater</p>
<p>and deciding for the landing site of the Spirit rover,</p>
<p>which means that I worked on that landing site for 15 years</p>
<p>and I got to see it from the ground.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the closest to being there and exploring.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not physically be present there.</p>
<p>If you were giving me the opportunity,</p>
<p>of course I would go, but I know one thing.</p>
<p>I would want to come back.</p>
<p>So, given the option of dying on Mars</p>
<p>or dying on Earth, you&rsquo;d visit Mars,</p>
<p>but you would like to spend your last days here.</p>
<p>Yeah, because of a number of things.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;re not ready to set on Mars,</p>
<p>regardless of what being said.</p>
<p>It will happen.</p>
<p>It will happen and because we are explorers,</p>
<p>humans, they&rsquo;re explorers, so this will happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Depending on how we go about this,</p>
<p>it can be a very good thing.</p>
<p>With time, as much as I&rsquo;ve been exploring,</p>
<p>continue to explore the big questions</p>
<p>of origin and nature of life or exploring of a planet,</p>
<p>the love, you were talking about love,</p>
<p>the love for my own planet has grown deeper</p>
<p>and my concern about it has grown deeper.</p>
<p>So, the data that I&rsquo;m collecting</p>
<p>to learn about other planets,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also using it to understand better our home planet</p>
<p>and trying to make it a little better</p>
<p>for the next generation.</p>
<p>So, if you were talking about love,</p>
<p>this is love that would drive me back here.</p>
<p>Yeah, this planet, it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>sometimes I just pause and I&rsquo;m in awe</p>
<p>at the incredible thing we have here</p>
<p>and I have deep gratitude for all the life forms here,</p>
<p>the beautiful complexity.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s darkness behind it,</p>
<p>all the death, all the extinction that led up to us,</p>
<p>two descendants of apes sitting here today.</p>
<p>I feel that&rsquo;s a responsibility.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the fittest that survived.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>As the dominant species, at least,</p>
<p>you know, technologically, et cetera,</p>
<p>maybe not the wisest one, but the dominant species,</p>
<p>we have a responsibility towards the entire biosphere</p>
<p>because the decisions we are making now</p>
<p>not only affect us, they are affecting the entire biosphere</p>
<p>and right now, the choices we are making</p>
<p>are leading to the disappearance of 150 species</p>
<p>every single day.</p>
<p>All the big mammals on this earth today</p>
<p>are on the brink of extinction.</p>
<p>We are within the sixth greatest extinction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfolding before our eyes</p>
<p>and I would strongly suggest that we use our smart</p>
<p>to help a little bit this situation and we can do this.</p>
<p>I think we can do this.</p>
<p>We just need to redirect our energy.</p>
<p>In the name of love.</p>
<p>This was an incredible conversation</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really honored that you sit with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of your work for a long time now,</p>
<p>so this is really awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very welcome, thanks.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Natalie Cabral.</p>

<p>and now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Stanislav Lem and Solaris.</p>
<p>How do you expect to communicate with the ocean</p>
<p>when we can&rsquo;t even understand one another?</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
