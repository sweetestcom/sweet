<p>Hey Lindsay, how are you? Hey Michelle? I am doing great. How are you? What&rsquo;s going on today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good. I just feel like I need new solutions</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good. I just feel like I need new silverware because I don&rsquo;t know what happened</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if things are going missing but I feel like I have like</p>
<p>10,000 spoons when all I need is a knife. Oh, that sounds like someone</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s line whose line is that? I think it&rsquo;s a Linus more said man. I love that song. I love it</p>
<p>I love that song something about it. It&rsquo;s just fun to sing along to right? Yeah guys. We&rsquo;re talking about the song ironic</p>
<p>This is a song from I don&rsquo;t know 1990 something and like that was a great song. I had a great remember the music video</p>
<p>Oh, yeah</p>
<p>Yes, I remember it&rsquo;s like in the car and she&rsquo;s like all different people and like yeah guys Alanis Morissette ironic</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a huge huge song. So, um, actually I for I should have mentioned this to you earlier</p>
<p>So one year for Halloween you were like my friend</p>
<p>No, but my friend and I we were just trying to think of like a really easy Halloween costume. Uh-huh, and</p>
<p>um, we both dressed in all black and I just like I</p>
<p>forget if I was the spoons or she was in night or if I was in the night, but I think</p>
<p>So like we like taped a sash of just like like a ton of plastic spoons</p>
<p>To me and then my friend or I may have been reverse had just like one plastic knife</p>
<p>And so we were just like walking around with spoons and a knife on our</p>
<p>Right, I love it. I love it and it&rsquo;s true. It is ironic</p>
<p>You have all these things all these spoons, but when you need a knife, you need a knife spoons</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t really fit the bill right? They don&rsquo;t really do what you needed to do to cut something. So that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s somewhat ironic, right?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Exactly. So yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna talk about some stuff that&rsquo;s ironic today</p>
<p>But before we do guys remember to hit follow on the all ears English podcast because you never want to miss an episode</p>
<p>Oh, yes, do not miss all ears English guys four days a week</p>
<p>So Michelle, we have a question to inspire today&rsquo;s episode from one of our awesome listeners from Mauritania</p>
<p>Can I go ahead and read the question? Go for it. Here we go. Hello guys. My name is Amdi Baca from Mauritania</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an Arabian country. You probably have heard this name for the first time because it&rsquo;s not comical</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what she meant by that, but that&rsquo;s okay. We&rsquo;ll keep going here</p>
<p>I have a question. I always hear this word a lot life is ironic or oh my god, that&rsquo;s ironic</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it means. Can you explain in a native way? I&rsquo;m elated and stoked to see its meaning nice nice</p>
<p>Oh, I love it. I think it is listeners picking up on some of our vocabulary from our different podcasts. I love that</p>
<p>Well, thank you for that question that is a good question and this is gonna be a fun one</p>
<p>So yeah guys, we&rsquo;ve done a couple episodes where we&rsquo;ve mentioned something being ironic or the word irony. So one is</p>
<p>1796 as it&rsquo;s a sign astrology stop signs and signatures and what&rsquo;s the other one Lindsay 18?</p>
<p>Sorry, 880 880 is six ways to be funny in English</p>
<p>So guys go check that out</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on the website, you could get that on the website or you could get that in the iOS or Android app</p>
<p>Just type in those numbers</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Absolutely guys. So the dictionary says to identify something that&rsquo;s ironic</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s happening in the opposite way to what is expected and typically causing wry amusement because of this</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>So before the episode guys Lindsay and I were talking about, you know</p>
<p>The word ironic and it&rsquo;s one of those things where it&rsquo;s hard to think of an example of it</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of those things that when it happens, it&rsquo;s like kind of it&rsquo;s almost kind of a cool feeling</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like oh, it&rsquo;s ironic, right? Do you feel right? Yeah. Yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than just something that&rsquo;s strange or coincidental. It&rsquo;s more than coincidental. I think yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s ironic. It&rsquo;s in again. Like you said, it&rsquo;s easier to identify when it actually happens</p>
<p>We know we&rsquo;re in we&rsquo;re in that sweet spot of irony, right? Right, right, right</p>
<p>It just happens and it&rsquo;s kind of amusing when I happen</p>
<p>Mm-hmm</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s basically like something&rsquo;s kind of strange in some sort of coincidental way. Yes</p>
<p>So, I mean like here I tried to come up with a couple examples</p>
<p>So like one is and you tell me well, first of all, let&rsquo;s talk about it</p>
<p>The ironic song haven&rsquo;t you heard people kind of analyze it and they&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s not actually ironic. It&rsquo;s just bad luck</p>
<p>Yeah, kind of I know sometimes I wonder about the rain on the wedding day thing, right? That&rsquo;s not ironic</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just yeah, just kind of things. Yeah, unless like it had been mentioned somehow</p>
<p>In some other way before that there was more to the story. I think that&rsquo;s just kind of not quite irony. Yeah</p>
<p>Right, exactly exactly so</p>
<p>That is kind of interesting. So let&rsquo;s try and find some examples and talk about if it&rsquo;s ironic</p>
<p>So, okay, I have it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s ironic that Billy became a doctor because he has always been afraid of blood</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s closer to irony than rain on your wedding day. Right? Mm-hmm</p>
<p>Some people say that rain on your wedding day is good luck, you know, right, right exactly, right? That&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>Yeah, um, or what&rsquo;s another one? It was ironic that the fitness coaches ran into each other at a doughnut festival</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s just funny I love that I would go to a festival oh my gosh</p>
<p>That sounds like fun there was a Bloody Mary festival in town last weekend and I missed it I was so annoyed</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like Bloody Mary&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. It&rsquo;s one of those things where I well now that I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>Do you ever have something where you think that you don&rsquo;t like it, but you&rsquo;re always like well</p>
<p>Maybe I would like it if I tried it again</p>
<p>And do you like that&rsquo;s one of those where I&rsquo;ll like try it again</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wait, maybe I will like I want to give it a chance and then I&rsquo;m like, nah</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean don&rsquo;t get me wrong</p>
<p>I take the doughnut festival over a Bloody Mary festival any day, but you should try it again. You should try it again</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try it again. I will I will</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s ironic because well, I mean, okay. So Lindsay, why is that ironic?</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Typically fitness coaches you wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to find them at a doughnut festival, right?</p>
<p>Because usually they&rsquo;re talking about the importance of nutrition and health and probably not eating sugar, but they were both there</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just kind of funny. All right, right</p>
<p>unexpected</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s unexpected. It&rsquo;s like a little twist. It&rsquo;s just kind of a twist. Yeah, it&rsquo;s just kind of like oh, that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>Like right that kind of a feeling so guys</p>
<p>So, you know, we have ironic is the adjective and then we have irony is the noun</p>
<p>So there are like lots of different types of irony and a lot of like when we talk about irony</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re also talking about like things like in plays in books, you know</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking for examples of the irony like in high school. I feel like you have to find that. Yes. Oh</p>
<p>Like when we read Shakespeare or any any literature you always that yeah, right. All those assignments were always tricky. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s always some sort of irony different types of it and we could get more into it another time</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very it&rsquo;s kind of a lot of literature. But yeah, okay</p>
<p>So when we talk about it, let&rsquo;s break it down to the different parts of speech that our listeners need right Michelle</p>
<p>So and in the adjective form, how do we talk about this word?</p>
<p>right, so you would say like</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s ironic. Mm-hmm. So just ironic and then as a noun, it&rsquo;s we know it&rsquo;s right like</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. Love it</p>
<p>Okay. All right, Michelle. So then how can we use ironic and irony in sentences? What do you think?</p>
<p>Right. So for ironic you might just say like, oh, wow, that&rsquo;s ironic like how or how ironic you might say something like that</p>
<p>If like Lindsay like let&rsquo;s say Lindsay</p>
<p>We are the fitness coaches and we&rsquo;re at the donut festival run into each other</p>
<p>I might make a joke and say like Oh Lindsay, like like oh, it&rsquo;s so funny running into you here. How ironic</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be a joke. Like that would be something that would make you laugh. That&rsquo;s kind of funny. Exactly</p>
<p>Or here&rsquo;s another example. There&rsquo;s definitely some irony there, right? So in that case, we&rsquo;re using the noun form. Mm-hmm</p>
<p>Or you might hear somebody say I can see the irony there. Mm-hmm, right?</p>
<p>So like if we&rsquo;re at the festival and I said, oh like wow</p>
<p>Look at us running into each other at this donut festival</p>
<p>Like how ironic you might respond and you might say something like oh, yeah, I can see the irony there. Yeah, right</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way to support the speaker. We&rsquo;ve done lots of episodes guys on how to support if someone&rsquo;s telling a story or saying</p>
<p>Something funny you can say I can see the X there. I can see the humor there. I can see the irony there</p>
<p>I can see the the shock there, right? These are good skills to have guys really good stuff</p>
<p>Right, right, right or another</p>
<p>Way to use it is instead of ironic or irony you could say ironically blank, right?</p>
<p>So you could start off the sentence you could say ironically I hate wine, but wound up on a whole wine tour in, California</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s another good example. I love it. I love it. So good</p>
<p>Yeah, do you you like wine, right? Yeah sure beer drinker. No, no my trip to Argentina</p>
<p>We were definitely going to be going to some wineries because it&rsquo;s famous Mendoza is famous for Malbec wine</p>
<p>So is Chile, but that&rsquo;s my favorite wine</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s yeah, that&rsquo;s pretty much what they have as far as I know in Mendoza</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re gonna be is mostly at the wineries</p>
<p>So you like red wine more or white one? I like both Michelle</p>
<p>I like both it just depends on the type of white or red and it depends on what I&rsquo;m eating the weather my mood</p>
<p>What I feel like nighttime daytime a lot of different things that you know that I decide based on so yes</p>
<p>Very sophisticated. Oh, well, thank you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like I like red wine. Okay, interesting interesting</p>
<p>Yeah, so do we have a role play to show our listeners how this might embed itself into a conversation? Let&rsquo;s do it</p>
<p>Here we go. So Lindsay we are we actually ran into it where we&rsquo;re running into each other on vacation in this role play</p>
<p>Have you ever run into somebody in big on vacation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve heard of it happening like I&rsquo;ve heard of people from the States running into someone in Italy or something</p>
<p>Oh, wow, you know, yeah, we I remember I think it&rsquo;s happened to me more than once but I specifically remember</p>
<p>When I was a kid, we were in San Francisco and one of like the administrators from my one of the schools</p>
<p>I went to</p>
<p>We were like in like some garden and all of a sudden we heard like, oh, it&rsquo;s the Kaplan then it was her</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s so funny. It can happen right and I love I love this first response right that we&rsquo;re gonna share. Let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go through it</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go through the role play and then we&rsquo;ll make comments on the role play. Here we go. Oh my gosh. What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Wow, I can&rsquo;t believe we ran into each other all the way across the country Lindsay. I know</p>
<p>Ironically, I was just talking about you because we stopped at the zoo and I know you love seeing tigers. Wow, that is ironic</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t use irony there guys, but we&rsquo;re not gonna use</p>
<p>Ironic. I love how I find it really interesting like sometimes how people&rsquo;s language reflects</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on in their head when they say what are you doing here? It&rsquo;s more. Well, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m sure the other person&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>What are you doing here? You know what? I mean? It&rsquo;s like why wouldn&rsquo;t they be there? It&rsquo;s funny. I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s just weird</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re if you run into somebody and you&rsquo;re surprised that&rsquo;s something you could say guys you could say</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Exactly. And then you said wow, I can&rsquo;t believe we ran into each other all the way across the country and I said, I know</p>
<p>Ironically, I was just talking about you because we stopped at the zoo and I know you love seeing tigers</p>
<p>So that is pretty ironic, right? It&rsquo;s not just the fact it&rsquo;s not really the fact that we ran into each other</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the irony, right Michelle</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the actual irony here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that you were just thinking about hey</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, exactly like we could go into it. Like I feel like some people might say that&rsquo;s not ironic</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a coincidence, but ironic is kind of but you don&rsquo;t have to like, you know debate</p>
<p>Intellectual debate right exactly. It&rsquo;s just kind of like, you know, you could you could have said like oh like that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like funny enough like, you know, but people just throw this in sometimes I think and then I said wow</p>
<p>That is ironic to support you. Yes. I love it. I love it. Yeah. I mean the point of all there&rsquo;s English is connection</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not being intellectual</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not being nitpicking everything and making sure everything&rsquo;s a hundred percent. Correct guys</p>
<p>We want you to connect with the person in front of you</p>
<p>So when you comment on something that to you feels ironic just go for it, right that adds to the connection</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point Michelle. That&rsquo;s the point of all there&rsquo;s English</p>
<p>Absolutely. Absolutely. So wow, this was fun. This was a really good question. I think like</p>
<p>I it&rsquo;s always fun to talk about things that are ironic and debated and disgusted but guys we talked about</p>
<p>You know, it can be a little bit tough to grasp sometimes and I don&rsquo;t think that the Alanis Morissette doesn&rsquo;t I even though?</p>
<p>I love the song. I don&rsquo;t know that things are really ironic in that song. Yeah people people like to talk about that, too</p>
<p>But but when when you find something that&rsquo;s ironic then you&rsquo;ll know it. Yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the feeling you just think to yourself</p>
<p>Oh, wow, that&rsquo;s weird, right? It&rsquo;s kind of like weird when something has kind of a combination of funny and weird and coincidental</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s irony. And you know again if you come and you say oh something&rsquo;s ironic and it&rsquo;s not quite irony</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Okay</p>
<p>Focus on that connection have a laugh with the person in front of you and go on with your day. It&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>Right, right, right. Exactly. All right. Well Lindsay, this was fun. And yeah, we&rsquo;ll go find things that are ironic</p>
<p>Yeah, we got it. All right, Michelle. I&rsquo;ll see you in the next one. Have a good one. Bye Lindsay. Bye</p>
