    <p>(crowd chatters)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good afternoon, welcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Erika Walker.</p>
<p>I am the senior assistant dean for instruction here</p>
<p>at the Haas School of Business,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d like to welcome you on behalf of Dean Ann Harrison,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s traveling today, to our Dean Speaker Series.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for this particular topic today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really wonderful to be here on this occasion</p>
<p>to reflect on just how much change Alex</p>
<p>and his changemaker class have catalyzed both on campus</p>
<p>and in the lives of students.</p>
<p>I remember when Alex was in the process</p>
<p>of developing this course.</p>
<p>I remember he was really thoughtful</p>
<p>and serious about how to ensure</p>
<p>that he would be able to inspire students</p>
<p>to be changemakers,</p>
<p>and not after they patented a new invention,</p>
<p>not after they secured a new job title</p>
<p>that was high profile,</p>
<p>or not after they started a new company,</p>
<p>but right now as immediate changemakers, right?</p>
<p>I was excited that we were gonna be able</p>
<p>to offer something like this in the undergraduate program.</p>
<p>Now Alex began teaching this class in 2019,</p>
<p>drawing rave reviews from students</p>
<p>in the very first semester.</p>
<p>Students would share</p>
<p>that the Becoming a Changemaker class was life-changing,</p>
<p>and even transformational.</p>
<p>They were surprised that such a course</p>
<p>as this was actually offered as part of business education,</p>
<p>and it ultimately reframed the way many students</p>
<p>approached their own leadership journey.</p>
<p>Now since that first semester,</p>
<p>Alex&rsquo;s changemaker curriculum</p>
<p>has become exceptionally popular all across Haas,</p>
<p>among our undergraduates, our MBAs,</p>
<p>and even with our Berkeley Executive Education participants.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s found creative ways to teach changemaking at all levels</p>
<p>and to all types of learners.</p>
<p>Now students would remark on the inclusive approach</p>
<p>that Alex brings to his teaching,</p>
<p>highlighting how his unique pedagogical approach</p>
<p>to changemaking meets them where they are,</p>
<p>and specifically inspires them to lead change</p>
<p>in brand new ways.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also pioneered some new approaches</p>
<p>to experiential learning,</p>
<p>which pushed our students outside of their comfort zones</p>
<p>as they explore what leading change means to them.</p>
<p>This is important because it is often during discomfort</p>
<p>that we have our most salient growth experiences.</p>
<p>Now as a culture champion, a Haas culture champion,</p>
<p>it is especially meaningful to see</p>
<p>that this course connects incredibly deeply</p>
<p>and fundamentally to Haas&rsquo;s defining leadership principles,</p>
<p>with one week of class dedicated</p>
<p>to exploring the changemaking connections</p>
<p>to each of those defining leadership principles.</p>
<p>And now, it&rsquo;s so exciting to see</p>
<p>that Alex is making the same magic</p>
<p>of his Haas classes available</p>
<p>to so many more people through his wonderful new book</p>
<p>that was just launched yesterday.</p>
<p>(Erika claps)</p>
<p>(all applaud) (Erika laughs)</p>
<p>Haas is featured prominently in the book,</p>
<p>from chapters named</p>
<p>after the Haas defining leadership principles</p>
<p>to stories of Berkeley Haas leaders</p>
<p>that have shown changemaking,</p>
<p>have demonstrated those changemaking principles in action.</p>
<p>Now knowing Alex, I&rsquo;m sure it was a labor of love</p>
<p>to put all this hard work into writing this book,</p>
<p>but he did it because he so deeply believes</p>
<p>that every person can be a changemaker,</p>
<p>and he can help everyone fulfill that potential.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising to anyone</p>
<p>that even though this is his book,</p>
<p>he wants to use this occasion, this celebration,</p>
<p>as a chance to highlight and elevate the work of the impact</p>
<p>of the alumni in those classes.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s joined today by alumni,</p>
<p>each an inspiring changemaker in their own right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity</p>
<p>to again publicly congratulate you Alex.</p>
<p>This is really exciting,</p>
<p>the Haas community is so proud of you,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t wait to see what this impact will be</p>
<p>on all changemakers out there, everywhere.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to now turn this over to Alex</p>
<p>who will lead the panel discussion today.</p>
<p>Again, congratulations,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s give another warm round of applause.</p>
<p>(all applaud)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much Erika, super kind introduction,</li>
</ul>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just so grateful to be here today with all of you.</p>
<p>Of course, my name is on the cover of the book,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a community effort,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s such a joy to celebrate this book in community</p>
<p>with all of you.</p>
<p>As Erika mentioned, this book is very Haas,</p>
<p>and it all started with a single serendipitous conversation,</p>
<p>so I went to meet with Jay Stowsky,</p>
<p>who was our senior assistant dean of instruction,</p>
<p>know Jay is watching virtually,</p>
<p>and I was going to him for advice on a career transition,</p>
<p>but I think he could tell that my heart wasn&rsquo;t really in it,</p>
<p>and so I will always remember what he said.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;But Alex, what do you really wanna do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I said, &ldquo;Well, y&rsquo;know, what I really wanna do is teach,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and then made some excuses</p>
<p>for why I couldn&rsquo;t possibly teach,</p>
<p>but to my shock and delight, he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, what do you wanna teach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in that moment, became crystal clear, I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanna teach becoming a changemaker,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and again, to my shock and delight,</p>
<p>he said, &ldquo;Okay, put together a syllabus, show it to me,</p>
<p>&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll go from there,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and I remember literally leaping out of my seat,</p>
<p>so elated someone else saw this potential in this class,</p>
<p>in this vision, and I shook his hand,</p>
<p>I closed the door to his office,</p>
<p>immediately pulled out my phone</p>
<p>and Googled how to create a syllabus,</p>
<p>because I had no idea how to do it,</p>
<p>but that started this journey which is now so special</p>
<p>to bring all full circle here to Haas.</p>
<p>As Erika mentioned, I don&rsquo;t want this to be about me.</p>
<p>I so believe in a potential of all of us</p>
<p>to become changemakers,</p>
<p>and I wanna use this as a platform</p>
<p>to lift up the stories and the impact</p>
<p>of so many other changemakers, and here&rsquo;s the amazing thing,</p>
<p>is I could&rsquo;ve chosen any of the hundreds</p>
<p>of students I&rsquo;ve had the privilege</p>
<p>and joy of teaching to be up here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m so thrilled to be joined by three alumni today,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ll have a panel discussion about leading change,</p>
<p>about positive change, about being a changemaker,</p>
<p>and I thought to get us started,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have each of them just briefly introduce themselves</p>
<p>and tell us a little bit about their changemaker journey</p>
<p>and their impact, so Angelica, we start with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah hi, just intro and what we&rsquo;ve been up to,</li>
</ul>
<p>kind of, yeah? - And what makes you</p>
<p>a changemaker, yeah. - Okay, okay. (laughs)</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Angelica, I graduated from Haas in May 2021,</p>
<p>I came back to walk, and I&rsquo;m currently a Google APMM</p>
<p>so I work in product marketing there</p>
<p>but during my five-to-nine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a content creator</p>
<p>so I make content online really about,</p>
<p>which segues me into my next point of my changemaking,</p>
<p>is un-gatekeeping the process of, whether it&rsquo;s college,</p>
<p>career, new grad life,</p>
<p>I feel like that was something I experienced</p>
<p>when I got to Berkeley or coming to a competitive school,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of, just the whole process in starting</p>
<p>from the college admission process was a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>you gotta know this or these are the secrets</p>
<p>and very this gatekeep-y energy</p>
<p>that I just personally did not, you know,</p>
<p>resonate with and I don&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>and I really believe that there&rsquo;s enough room</p>
<p>and success and opportunities for everyone,</p>
<p>so I started making my content</p>
<p>and having these like micro-changemaking moments</p>
<p>which is an element in the book that is talked about</p>
<p>and really bringing that to scale on the internet,</p>
<p>I started making TikToks and Instagram</p>
<p>and YouTube about my experience</p>
<p>and the ways I want to just spread this wealth of knowledge</p>
<p>of like, hey, recruiting for certain positions start</p>
<p>in this time and like,</p>
<p>so many people across the country who go</p>
<p>to a wide variety of schools just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about these things and I just wanted to share</p>
<p>with people what my experiences are</p>
<p>and I had the advantage of going</p>
<p>to such a great school like Haas</p>
<p>that had these resources and the community</p>
<p>and the knowledge that they gave me, I was like,</p>
<p>I need to be telling everybody and not just me</p>
<p>and my four friends here,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s kind of a little bit inside</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;ve been doing with my life</p>
<p>and my changemaking habits.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>And a number</li>
</ul>
<p>of my students have said they specifically chose Berkeley</p>
<p>and chose Haas because of the videos</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve watched of you,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re an amazing recruiter for us, yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>Alicia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, I&rsquo;m Alicia.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually a fifth year, still studying here,</p>
<p>business and economics major,</p>
<p>and I guess my changemaking journey started in 2020.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a swimmer as well, and the Olympics had been postponed</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d kind of lost my identity a little bit,</p>
<p>like that was everything that I was working towards,</p>
<p>and I remember doing my classes and my syllabus,</p>
<p>like getting everything ready for the next semester,</p>
<p>and picking this class,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t consider myself a changemaker</p>
<p>or anything like that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d, pretty overwhelmed when I&rsquo;d get into the Haas classes</p>
<p>and everyone would say their double,</p>
<p>triple majors and things like that</p>
<p>and how academic Berkeley was,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t until I took the class that I realized</p>
<p>that I could make a change,</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t always just about me</p>
<p>and my journey as a swimmer,</p>
<p>and so I kind of took the opportunity after the class</p>
<p>to get deep into mental health,</p>
<p>and particularly with athletes,</p>
<p>and try and get on as many podcasts as I could and try</p>
<p>and do raffles and bring together that spirit</p>
<p>of the Olympics but also, you know,</p>
<p>that the pandemic has been tough,</p>
<p>and that we can make a change</p>
<p>from a very small point of view,</p>
<p>so I started with myself and just tried</p>
<p>to do the local swimming community</p>
<p>and get bigger from there,</p>
<p>and then regain my identity in 2021</p>
<p>when the next Olympics came round,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m kinda still navigating it,</p>
<p>but this class gave me my voice</p>
<p>to kind of come out of myself</p>
<p>and stop thinking about the I, I guess,</p>
<p>and make a change within the wider community.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>And Shannon, please.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi there everyone, my name is Shannon Elliott.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I graduated with my MBA in December 2020,</p>
<p>which seems like a million years ago at this point</p>
<p>but not that long ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny Alex, when you were just speaking,</p>
<p>I was thinking, I had my answer ready about, you know,</p>
<p>when I started my changemaking journey, and I have no idea,</p>
<p>sometimes you just have this memory</p>
<p>from long ago just spark out of nowhere.</p>
<p>I think my first, my very first changemaker experience,</p>
<p>I think I was eight or nine years old,</p>
<p>and I think I was on the playground of my elementary school,</p>
<p>and I remember witnessing some kind</p>
<p>of confrontation between two of my classmates,</p>
<p>and I remember the classmate</p>
<p>who had not started it had gotten sent</p>
<p>to the principal&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>and I thought that was unacceptable, completely unjust,</p>
<p>and I somehow,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think I really knew what a petition was</p>
<p>but I distinctly remember going around</p>
<p>and petitioning my classmates and asking them</p>
<p>to sign this document in support</p>
<p>of my friend who was unjustly, you know,</p>
<p>unjustly being disciplined,</p>
<p>so if that counts as the beginning, maybe that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I have no idea what happened, I was nine,</p>
<p>I probably did not have the full story,</p>
<p>but I chuckle about that</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s something deep in me</p>
<p>from a very early age that wanted to fight for justice,</p>
<p>but as an adult, (chuckles) a more informed adult,</p>
<p>I started my career mostly in non-profits.</p>
<p>My background is in communications,</p>
<p>and so for about four years,</p>
<p>my first four years in my career,</p>
<p>I was working on mental health stigma reduction</p>
<p>and social inclusion campaigns,</p>
<p>actually here in Alameda County,</p>
<p>and working with underserved populations</p>
<p>and marginalized groups through campaigns,</p>
<p>through marketing, things like that, messaging,</p>
<p>and then over time, working in a lot of healthcare,</p>
<p>mission-based healthcare, non-profits and so forth,</p>
<p>and today, after finishing my MBA from Haas,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working as the director of communications</p>
<p>for a fintech company</p>
<p>in San Francisco called LendingClub that&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also mission-based,</p>
<p>focusing on empowering folks to make their financial goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terrific, thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>So one of the key themes of &ldquo;Becoming a Changemaker,&rdquo;</p>
<p>the book and the class, is this adaptability</p>
<p>and flexibility, so we have one other amazing panelist</p>
<p>who was supposed to join us in person,</p>
<p>but of course things happen,</p>
<p>and so he was nice enough to film a video for us,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s also welcome&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>And building, so I graduated in 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>from the Haas School of Business,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m the CEO and co-founder of Blackbook U.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a diversity, equity, and inclusion solution,</p>
<p>working to streamline peer-to-peer connection</p>
<p>for Black students the moment</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re thinking of college to when they graduate.</p>
<p>A huge inspiration for my education really came</p>
<p>from the success of the world of innovation around me.</p>
<p>I was born in Oakland, raised here in the Bay Area,</p>
<p>and in seeing a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>the opportunities of Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and how they very much overlooked the communities</p>
<p>that I came from,</p>
<p>I worked to position my education as a platform</p>
<p>or bridge to the communities that I come from</p>
<p>and the opportunities that were all around us,</p>
<p>which is why I eventually created Blackbook,</p>
<p>but a huge, huge, you know, stepping stone for me</p>
<p>in doing this work really came</p>
<p>from adopting the changemaker mindset.</p>
<p>This notion of a growth mindset was something</p>
<p>that was new to me, being able to navigate variables,</p>
<p>different trajectories, different pathways</p>
<p>to align on your solution or the outcome in the world</p>
<p>that you wanna see,</p>
<p>was something so ingrained in myself through this course.</p>
<p>But I think what naturally came after that was this idea</p>
<p>of learned optimism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many ups and downs as an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>and being able to be a leader</p>
<p>and inspire this cohesive path forward is something</p>
<p>that will consistently challenge you not only</p>
<p>as an entrepreneur but even outside your work.</p>
<p>And lastly, I think that these aspects</p>
<p>of mindset really come into play in this idea</p>
<p>of a collective mindset.</p>
<p>For me and for many of us who are reading the book,</p>
<p>going through a class, you know,</p>
<p>having a conversation with someone,</p>
<p>we have an idea of the impact or vision that we wanna see</p>
<p>in the world, it&rsquo;s not until we&rsquo;re able to articulate this</p>
<p>and create a shared vision</p>
<p>that we can start to work towards the outcomes</p>
<p>and realities that we wanna see.</p>
<p>This notion of a shared vision is something</p>
<p>that Alex was able to create through his classes</p>
<p>and through his community here in Berkeley,</p>
<p>and with this book,</p>
<p>I believe that there&rsquo;s so much potential</p>
<p>in being able to share this to folks</p>
<p>who might not have the privilege of sitting in a class or,</p>
<p>you know, might not have the, you know,</p>
<p>inspiration to kind of, you know,</p>
<p>be a part of things like this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a stepping stone that&rsquo;s scratching the surface</p>
<p>for many people, optimizing access,</p>
<p>and really it&rsquo;s a huge milestone,</p>
<p>so congratulations to Alex,</p>
<p>congratulations to the rest of the community</p>
<p>because you know, we&rsquo;re all a part of this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really excited to see what happens next,</p>
<p>so thank you all.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Super grateful to Ibrahim for recording that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ll do now</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;ll have a little conversation among us</p>
<p>on the panel here, and then we&rsquo;ll open up to questions</p>
<p>for you about things you wanna talk about changemaking</p>
<p>and beyond.</p>
<p>So Shannon, wanna pick on something that you mentioned.</p>
<p>One of the greatest joys for me</p>
<p>as an educator is this like magical moment</p>
<p>where I can literally see someone become a changemaker.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happens in week one, sometimes it&rsquo;s week 14,</p>
<p>hopefully by our week at least,</p>
<p>but sometimes it&rsquo;s by the end of the class</p>
<p>where they realize, oh, I can become a changemaker,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s magical as an instructor,</p>
<p>to get to be part of that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a privilege to be part of that.</p>
<p>So we can start with Alicia and then Angelica,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear from you,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the moment where you first realized</p>
<p>that you could be a changemaker?</p>
<p>Alicia, we can start with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>You want me?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the class that I&rsquo;m&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In your life or in the class, yeah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;d say in the class,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>it was when you were talking</p>
<p>about the kind of growth mindset and,</p>
<p>versus the fixed mindset,</p>
<p>and then applying that to the end of semester project,</p>
<p>my group and I decided we were gonna do something</p>
<p>to get active.</p>
<p>You know, we were taking the class from our bedrooms online,</p>
<p>(chuckles) and so it was hard to mobilize the community</p>
<p>from a mental health perspective</p>
<p>and get everybody moving and to create that plan,</p>
<p>and I wanted to see that through,</p>
<p>particularly in the UK where lockdown was really hard,</p>
<p>and I guess that&rsquo;s where it kinda clicked,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t have to just stay here and be stagnant</p>
<p>and not do anything,</p>
<p>I can start from a very small perspective</p>
<p>and go to my local club</p>
<p>and try and implement the changemaking process</p>
<p>that we had talked about, and you know,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really view myself as a changemaker</p>
<p>or anything like that, I just viewed myself</p>
<p>as one of the Berkeley students taking your class,</p>
<p>until I managed to go home in 2021 for the first time</p>
<p>and do that, and implement that kind of growth mindset</p>
<p>with the project that we did there, yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Alex] Nice, Angelica.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think for me, the idea of micro-leadership was, I guess,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>put into words from your class,</p>
<p>but going back to my thing about,</p>
<p>I think growth mindset is one thing</p>
<p>but also abundance mindset is something</p>
<p>that I learned that was so important to my journey,</p>
<p>especially being at Haas, it&rsquo;s a competitive program,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a competitive school,</p>
<p>I think sometimes we get a reputation for, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only so many spots for this job or like a lot,</p>
<p>sometimes the students unfortunately</p>
<p>were almost pitted against each other and I really always,</p>
<p>even among my friend group,</p>
<p>thought that there was enough opportunities, enough jobs,</p>
<p>enough money for all of us,</p>
<p>and it really is one of those like, what is it,</p>
<p>a tide rises all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna butcher this phrase, something of,</p>
<p>all boats, yes, - Tides raise all boats,</p>
<p>there you go, there you go. - all boats, yes,</p>
<p>(laughing) and so I, you know, started</p>
<p>with obviously how I treat my friends</p>
<p>with this type of thing of like,</p>
<p>career mobility was like something</p>
<p>I was really passionate about</p>
<p>and helping my friends feeling empowered</p>
<p>and resumes and all that stuff,</p>
<p>and then taking that to the next level</p>
<p>like practicing those micro-leadership moments</p>
<p>that Alex talked about</p>
<p>and then bringing that onto the internet</p>
<p>and I felt that there was also a gap in the market</p>
<p>for someone who&rsquo;s a new grad,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s talking about their honest experience</p>
<p>and someone who isn&rsquo;t 20 years out of their career</p>
<p>but someone who can&ndash;</p>
<p>People gatekept where they went to get tutoring</p>
<p>or SAT prep because it was that competitive</p>
<p>and so I was like, I wanna take this knowledge</p>
<p>and share it with people</p>
<p>and get people to also adopt that mindset</p>
<p>when it comes to any career or even life,</p>
<p>like there is so much out there for everybody</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a finite number of opportunities</p>
<p>and people and jobs and money and all that stuff,</p>
<p>so even being a content creator or influencer,</p>
<p>that mindset could be there in that community too of like,</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s only this many events</p>
<p>or this many brand deals or sponsorships,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s something that I just took on</p>
<p>as a micro thing in my life</p>
<p>and I wanted to really share that</p>
<p>across all my different touchpoints,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m really passionate about</p>
<p>is like practicing in small moments</p>
<p>and then finding ways you can amplify that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, and Shannon,</li>
</ul>
<p>you of course talked about your earliest age</p>
<p>on the playground,</p>
<p>but how about like, yeah. - My nine-year-old self</p>
<p>excluded, I think I really realized I could be a changemaker</p>
<p>when I had that ah-ha moment</p>
<p>where I redefined fundamentally was changemaking was, right?</p>
<p>I was always, and probably a lot of us, right,</p>
<p>think of changemaking as big and bold and flashy and,</p>
<p>you know, this 20-year-old wunderkind</p>
<p>who found the next huge, you know,</p>
<p>multi-billion-dollar startup, right?</p>
<p>I did not see myself in that sort of image</p>
<p>and also I can be,</p>
<p>while I can be extroverted</p>
<p>I also very much have an introverted side,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not always out there hustling,</p>
<p>going to cocktails trading business cards,</p>
<p>I have my quiet moments too,</p>
<p>but I think what was so great about this class is so much</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;d already been doing,</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t seen it as changemaking, but really it was,</p>
<p>it was those smaller moments, those quieter moments,</p>
<p>and even if you aren&rsquo;t necessarily leading this big,</p>
<p>bold initiative from scratch,</p>
<p>if you even simply create a safe space</p>
<p>for others to share ideas and connect</p>
<p>that might not have otherwise been there</p>
<p>had you not done it, that&rsquo;s huge,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s moving things forward,</p>
<p>so I think as I&rsquo;ve progressed in my career, right,</p>
<p>right out of undergrad, I had this big, all-or-nothing,</p>
<p>black-or-white thinking of what changemaking was</p>
<p>but as I progressed through my career,</p>
<p>seeing those smaller moments, quieter moments,</p>
<p>how can I open up doors for other people</p>
<p>and support them in change,</p>
<p>it just comes in so many forms</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re ever struggling with that,</p>
<p>wondering if you&rsquo;re making a difference,</p>
<p>you most likely are, take a breath, go for a walk,</p>
<p>zoom out your perspective a little bit,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;re on the right track.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I so appreciate that.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the book, of course I define changemaking,</p>
<p>and I define it in a radically inclusive way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply someone who leads positive change</p>
<p>from where they are,</p>
<p>and that makes it inclusive to all of us to be changemakers.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need a formal title or role or responsibility,</p>
<p>all it takes is giving ourselves the authority to step up</p>
<p>and say, &ldquo;Yes, I can do something about this&rdquo;</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s true to who we are,</p>
<p>introvert or extrovert or beyond.</p>
<ul>
<li>And I think building on that, you know,</li>
</ul>
<p>if we&rsquo;re at Berkeley, we&rsquo;re probably already</p>
<p>very achievement-oriented individuals, right,</p>
<p>and I think to just get those little wins,</p>
<p>it gives you that confidence that you&rsquo;re making progress</p>
<p>to keep going, right?</p>
<p>If your bar is all or nothing and it&rsquo;s so high</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re ever reaching it,</p>
<p>it can be really easy to be disheartened</p>
<p>and kinda walk away and give up, when in reality, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve actually come already so far, so just keep going.</p>
<p>I think you wrote, I&rsquo;m going to misattribute this quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Action is antidote to despair,&rdquo; right?</p>
<p>Was that&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s not me, that&rsquo;s Joan Baez that said that, but yeah,</li>
</ul>
<p>don&rsquo;t wanna take credit - I was gonna (laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>for that, but. (audience laughs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was gonna say Joni Mitchell</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but I was gonna mess it up, yeah.</p>
<p>So again, those small, and again,</p>
<p>that took me time to realize.</p>
<p>I would not have, you know,</p>
<p>10 years ago would I have had this perspective, no,</p>
<p>but just keeping that in mind,</p>
<p>yeah, it gets you through the harder times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, so appreciate that, so of course the subtitle</li>
</ul>
<p>of the book is &ldquo;An Actionable Inclusive Guide</p>
<p>&ldquo;to Leading Positive Change, Any Level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spoken a bit on the inclusivity lens,</p>
<p>I wanna talk a bit about the action-oriented lens,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;d love to hear from you,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a lesson from the class</p>
<p>that you sort of put into practice,</p>
<p>or that you wanna teach the community</p>
<p>when it comes to changemaking?</p>
<p>Start with anyone who feels called to get started.</p>
<ul>
<li>I could share the story that we talked about earlier,</li>
</ul>
<p>that coincidentally happened - Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>About, gosh, what was that, six months or so ago,</p>
<p>maybe longer, and it was kind of a, it was a tough moment,</p>
<p>it turned out okay, but this was actually just a moment</p>
<p>in life that presented itself to me.</p>
<p>I was not planning for it, I was out in the world,</p>
<p>it was not related to work in any way,</p>
<p>but I think this is a great example of micro-leadership</p>
<p>with very real human consequences,</p>
<p>so I was out in Oakland doing some grocery shopping,</p>
<p>you know, at a standard shopping center</p>
<p>in a Trader Joe&rsquo;s parking lot,</p>
<p>and I was going up to my car on the second floor.</p>
<p>I had just left a coffee meeting</p>
<p>with one of my colleagues in a pretty good mood,</p>
<p>it was Friday, I was ready for the weekend,</p>
<p>and I noticed a woman who appeared,</p>
<p>she was lying on the ground</p>
<p>and she seemed to be struggling a little bit,</p>
<p>and I was confused and I immediately,</p>
<p>I looked around to see if anyone else was doing anything,</p>
<p>and I started to question myself,</p>
<p>because my eyes told me one thing but I looked around</p>
<p>and I was like, well no one else is helping her</p>
<p>so she must be okay,</p>
<p>and then I actually saw an individual come over,</p>
<p>she was in the process of being robbed</p>
<p>but maybe no one else had seen it</p>
<p>or just didn&rsquo;t take action and someone came over</p>
<p>and actually kicked her in the stomach,</p>
<p>and immediately, I just went into reaction mode,</p>
<p>and partly panic, but partly, I just had to do something,</p>
<p>and it was fascinating because in real time we were seeing,</p>
<p>I as the first person to react,</p>
<p>suddenly maybe three or four people around me,</p>
<p>because they saw me acting, then they came in to help too,</p>
<p>and so Alex talks about that idea, in a less dramatic way,</p>
<p>but in his book about, it&rsquo;s very often that first person,</p>
<p>that first agent of change to get others to go on board,</p>
<p>right, whether it&rsquo;s something like an emergency like that</p>
<p>or even a smaller change initiative at your company</p>
<p>or in life, that first person is that catalyst</p>
<p>to get other people on board</p>
<p>and it makes all the difference in the world,</p>
<p>and thankfully she ended up being okay,</p>
<p>it has a happy ending, she&rsquo;s doing well, but yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just you, it&rsquo;s so easy to,</p>
<p>I think when you&rsquo;re studying this stuff,</p>
<p>put it in very like theoretical context</p>
<p>and read case studies, it&rsquo;s so applicable</p>
<p>to absolutely everything in life</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re least expecting it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, I so appreciate that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, Alicia?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think for me, the first action item</li>
</ul>
<p>that came was actually in January,</p>
<p>so I finished the class in December, and in January,</p>
<p>the pandemic was obviously still going on,</p>
<p>and one of my close friends had sadly been impacted</p>
<p>through his deteriorating mental health,</p>
<p>so kind of in his honor,</p>
<p>I wanted to swim for something bigger than myself,</p>
<p>and I began training, refocused myself,</p>
<p>and by the time the Olympics came around,</p>
<p>it was kind of like, oh this is cool,</p>
<p>like I can put on the like Team GB jerseys</p>
<p>and things like that, but it wasn&rsquo;t the feeling</p>
<p>that I had thought it was gonna be,</p>
<p>and I kind of took the T-shirt off</p>
<p>and plucked up the courage to ask some of my teammates</p>
<p>to sign it, and you know,</p>
<p>like a lot of the people I idolized,</p>
<p>I asked for their signatures on this top</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t wear it again, I got it framed</p>
<p>and I decided to do a global raffle</p>
<p>to raffle off in Max&rsquo;s honor,</p>
<p>and I think that was the first solidified action</p>
<p>that I took.</p>
<p>It was pretty hard because it&rsquo;s so emotional but also,</p>
<p>these were people I looked up to,</p>
<p>so I didn&rsquo;t feel like a changemaker in myself in that I was,</p>
<p>you know, asking people way above me,</p>
<p>but I think that when the raffle was done,</p>
<p>and it actually went to a little girl</p>
<p>who knew the person that it was in honor of,</p>
<p>that made me realize that it had created a change,</p>
<p>and you know,</p>
<p>obviously it created like a couple thousand dollars</p>
<p>that went to this charity, but this little girl,</p>
<p>I still email, I keep in contact with her,</p>
<p>she sends me cards at competitions,</p>
<p>but to know that she&rsquo;s inspired to make a change</p>
<p>at eight years old was the thing</p>
<p>that made it all worth it to me, you know,</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t see myself like that</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s created a change for someone that young</p>
<p>and that is down to the lessons I learned</p>
<p>from this class, so yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer mad I didn&rsquo;t win the raffle.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s deserving more than I am.</p>
<p>Angelica, how &lsquo;bout you?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think for me, one of the hard to swallow pills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that was really helpful with both the book</p>
<p>and the class was really being honest with yourself,</p>
<p>and I know there was a section of your book</p>
<p>when you talk about like, you felt important</p>
<p>just because people were asking you questions of like,</p>
<p>oh, can you check my work or like, is this idea of like,</p>
<p>are you really making impact</p>
<p>and are you really saying what you&rsquo;re saying or are we like,</p>
<p>pretending that we are because everything is lined up</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re, you know, basically playing dress-up</p>
<p>for a leader, right, or changemaker,</p>
<p>and even this whole thing of like,</p>
<p>something I&rsquo;m really passionate about,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve talked about is un-gatekeeping like so many things</p>
<p>about, especially about like success</p>
<p>or whatever that means for different people,</p>
<p>but taking a really, like I wasn&rsquo;t always like this</p>
<p>and I definitely have my fair share of insecurities</p>
<p>but I feel like that&rsquo;s where a lot</p>
<p>of those feelings come from</p>
<p>and being really honest</p>
<p>was a big thing I know you talked about in your class</p>
<p>and the book is like, checking yourself of like, okay like,</p>
<p>why am I feeling this way, why am I frustrated,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t I wanna share my resume tips with my friends,</p>
<p>like thinking about,</p>
<p>like really walking through that process of,</p>
<p>and getting honest</p>
<p>with myself was such a big wake-up call for me,</p>
<p>and as soon as I found that that was the root</p>
<p>of why so many people are gatekeepers</p>
<p>and so many people don&rsquo;t like to share resources</p>
<p>and networks and whatever,</p>
<p>helped me like tackle that on my own</p>
<p>and be at a better place where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>oh, no I have X, Y, Z things that are going for me,</p>
<p>like feeling much more secure</p>
<p>about myself I think was such a, like a click for me</p>
<p>that was able to, why I was able to make content,</p>
<p>why I became so much more championing</p>
<p>of non-gatekeeping content and empowering others,</p>
<p>was because I was able to really couple this idea of like,</p>
<p>again, abundance mindset, growth mindset,</p>
<p>which all came from being very honest with myself,</p>
<p>and that was a big thing for me that I took away.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Shannon] Can I add on?</li>
</ul>
<p>I totally wanna go back - Yeah.</p>
<ul>
<li>to that, you talked about finding your confidence, right,</li>
</ul>
<p>and I think there was another really big moment,</p>
<p>where were so many big moments, so many that,</p>
<p>just get the book, they&rsquo;re all filled with big moments,</p>
<p>but one person you profile in there,</p>
<p>we were lucky enough to have come guest lecture for us,</p>
<p>Cal Soon, and she is awesome, I wanna be her when I grow up,</p>
<p>she is a constant entrepreneur, founder,</p>
<p>doing wonderful things in the world,</p>
<p>and she talked repeatedly, she shared,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s very open with us,</p>
<p>shared her struggles of founding companies.</p>
<p>I think she said her father had built something up</p>
<p>to $1 million when she was a kid and then lost it all,</p>
<p>something like that, and then started from scratch again,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of us can identify with the fear</p>
<p>of failure, especially working so hard</p>
<p>to get to a place like Berkeley and to, you know,</p>
<p>whatever you think you need to do for your next career step,</p>
<p>and you know, it&rsquo;s scary to take a risk</p>
<p>and potentially fail, and here she was,</p>
<p>completely inspirational, talking about all her failures,</p>
<p>and I found it fascinating, and I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the fear of failure ever terrify you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it just stop you from even trying, &lsquo;cause sometimes</p>
<p>&ldquo;in my past I would certainly skew that way,&rdquo; and she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, in my family, you know, it was just expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Failure isn&rsquo;t the end, it&rsquo;s a means to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You learn through the failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The failure is an essential part of getting you</p>
<p>&ldquo;to where you wanna go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you stopped every time you failed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;it would be game over, there&rsquo;d be nothing else to do</p>
<p>&ldquo;or build on,&rdquo; right,</p>
<p>so that still sticks with me to this day,</p>
<p>and whenever I&rsquo;m having an insecure day</p>
<p>or an insecure moment, I go back to that,</p>
<p>and yeah, just try and internalize it as much as I can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, yeah, so appreciate that.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the highlights, I think,</p>
<p>of the class is bringing in a diverse array</p>
<p>of different guest speakers,</p>
<p>all who give voice to changemaking different roles</p>
<p>and sectors.</p>
<p>One particularly memorable guest speaker was Sid Espinosa.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the first ever Latino mayor of Palo Alto, California,</p>
<p>and at the time, was the head of philanthropy at Microsoft.</p>
<p>And so a student asked a question,</p>
<p>which I think was a poignant one, which is basically,</p>
<p>I wanna create big system, substantive change,</p>
<p>but I also don&rsquo;t wanna burn out.</p>
<p>Do you have any advice for me?</p>
<p>And so Sid started talking, and as he was talking,</p>
<p>the sort of instructor,</p>
<p>the professor inside of me was like uh-oh,</p>
<p>did he just deflate these students&rsquo; hopes?</p>
<p>But no, he actually gave the most empowering advice,</p>
<p>I think, of any of the guest speakers.</p>
<p>So he said, &ldquo;We need to stop thinking about leading change,</p>
<p>&ldquo;especially systemic change, as the lone person in a race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead, start thinking about it as a relay race</p>
<p>&ldquo;that you will have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years of your career,</p>
<p>&ldquo;and think about how you can take the baton</p>
<p>&ldquo;from those who came before you,</p>
<p>&ldquo;advance it in a really meaningful way,</p>
<p>&ldquo;and then when your time comes,</p>
<p>&ldquo;find ways to hand that baton off to the next person,</p>
<p>&ldquo;and do so in a thoughtful way where you&rsquo;re mentoring them,</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re supporting them,</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re setting them up for success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I always say that changemaking is a team sport,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s a powerful reframe</p>
<p>to think about how we can all be part of change together.</p>
<p>So that goes back to one of the themes of Haas,</p>
<p>one of the defining leadership principles,</p>
<p>which is questioning the status quo,</p>
<p>and so my question for each of you is,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s something from the book or from the class that,</p>
<p>especially through the lens of leadership</p>
<p>and kind of how we make change, that you think,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s a status quo we need to challenge</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s maybe a tool or an idea from the class</p>
<p>that you think can help us question that status quo?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it&rsquo;s really easy</li>
</ul>
<p>when you are in a bigger organization,</p>
<p>sometimes you can kind of feel like you&rsquo;re floating along,</p>
<p>no one really sees you, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a company of thousands if not tens,</p>
<p>if not hundreds of thousands of people, right, you know,</p>
<p>typically the bigger companies are, the more structure,</p>
<p>the more red tape and bureaucracies there are, right,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of hard to do your own thing,</p>
<p>you can kinda question,</p>
<p>am I even making a difference here each day?</p>
<p>Am I just coming in, clocking in and out and going home,</p>
<p>and am I, is what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>with my life even worth anything at the moment?</p>
<p>I think looking for the, again,</p>
<p>those quiet moments that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>those really small, how you even show up in meetings,</p>
<p>how you show up in settings,</p>
<p>can you create psychological safety</p>
<p>for maybe some of your teammates or your colleagues</p>
<p>to speak about an issue they&rsquo;ve been struggling with,</p>
<p>whereas no one else would give them that space?</p>
<p>So again, it might not be this big flashy change effort,</p>
<p>depending on how you define that or what you envision,</p>
<p>but just simply how you show up and relate to others</p>
<p>and support others</p>
<p>in your day-to-day can make all the difference,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe that person was having a bad day</p>
<p>and was about to give up on something,</p>
<p>and you gave them five minutes and your attention</p>
<p>and some encouragement, and then they kept going</p>
<p>and who knows, maybe they&rsquo;ll,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones that find a new medicine for something,</p>
<p>you never know, right?</p>
<p>You just never know the positive impact</p>
<p>your actions can have on someone else.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanna add to that, because I feel the same way,</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;cause I just started my new grad,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a year into my first new grad job</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m at a very big company,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s a common thing is like,</p>
<p>you get there with fresh eyes and all these ideas</p>
<p>and things you wanna do and there&rsquo;s so many problems, right,</p>
<p>and especially at big companies,</p>
<p>and you could so easily get burnt out trying to,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t solve, you know, these big problems,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t change this company, you can&rsquo;t change even,</p>
<p>you know, so many things,</p>
<p>but as someone who just shows up and being a new grad,</p>
<p>I think what I learned was the small moments,</p>
<p>also like setting healthy expectations of like,</p>
<p>what really is in your power, right,</p>
<p>like, again, the baton race analogy is so great</p>
<p>because you can only do your best for people before you</p>
<p>and after you and then the rest of it is kind of like,</p>
<p>you know, well hopefully you&rsquo;ll all start to be in line</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only so much you can do.</p>
<p>An analogy that was told to me recently was like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re steering a very, very large ship, right,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna be at the front of the ship</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re gonna get pummeled,</p>
<p>but you wanna be directing it and getting allies</p>
<p>and getting teamwork to go so it starts</p>
<p>to turn into a direction and not into the iceberg,</p>
<p>so that was a really good thing you brought up</p>
<p>because I feel like as a new grad,</p>
<p>I face that all the time</p>
<p>of like I have so many things I wanna do and, you know,</p>
<p>feeling frustrated by, the problems are too big,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough power,</p>
<p>but like what can I do? - Politics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, well that&rsquo;s what really it is, but,</li>
</ul>
<p>(both laugh)</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s why I think taking small moments</p>
<p>and pacing yourself I think is a good way definitely</p>
<p>to not face burnout.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thanks, Alicia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think my thing I learned</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>about challenging the status quo</p>
<p>in this class was what a leader looks like.</p>
<p>I was a captain of the swim team that year,</p>
<p>and I thought leadership was this hard kind</p>
<p>of competitive person that needed to come down hard</p>
<p>on their teammates, and needed to be that person</p>
<p>that was instructive and not very compassionate</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t show vulnerability or anything like that,</p>
<p>and you know, along with the challenges of that year,</p>
<p>but also the class and watching the clips</p>
<p>from people like Brene Brown, and seeing that, you know,</p>
<p>the more you can relate to people</p>
<p>and the more compassionate you can be,</p>
<p>the more effective you are, and you know,</p>
<p>that first semester, I completely failed as a captain.</p>
<p>I was so unrelatable, and watching those clips,</p>
<p>hearing from those guest speakers</p>
<p>and knowing that it&rsquo;s okay not to be perfect</p>
<p>but also that you are far more relatable</p>
<p>if you can be yourself was something that I learned,</p>
<p>and I think particularly with the culture that I come from,</p>
<p>the status quo of being a leader is this person</p>
<p>that you idolize and that doesn&rsquo;t show this emotion,</p>
<p>so trying to tap into that was my biggest takeaway</p>
<p>from the status quo.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think building on that really quick,</li>
</ul>
<p>I think traditionally in business</p>
<p>or maybe like the more old-school way of thinking was like,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t show emotions, you know,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily reach out to people and be warm and fuzzy,</p>
<p>right, I think nowadays,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s always been this way</p>
<p>but at least in reality but there&rsquo;s more recognition</p>
<p>and openness about it now,</p>
<p>do not underestimate the importance</p>
<p>and the impact of emotional intelligence,</p>
<p>and being able to connect with people.</p>
<p>You can always get into the tactics and strategy later,</p>
<p>but if you can&rsquo;t even connect with a person to begin with,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have anything to talk about, right?</p>
<p>So always look for those connections when you can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Love it, as Patti Sanchez says,</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Empathy is the key</p>
<p>&ldquo;to leading organizational change,&rdquo; totally agree.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll open up in a second to questions from all of you,</p>
<p>so if you have a question, you can head back,</p>
<p>we have a microphone there,</p>
<p>you can line up and we&rsquo;ll get to you in a sec.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love to hear the questions that you all have,</p>
<p>so please head back and ask questions, but in the meantime,</p>
<p>I will ask a question to the panel, which is, in our class,</p>
<p>probably my favorite assignment</p>
<p>is we do something called the changemaker of the week.</p>
<p>I want every student</p>
<p>to leave the class having been introduced to 40,</p>
<p>50 different changemakers from all walks of life</p>
<p>to see how they have led positive change</p>
<p>from where they are.</p>
<p>Students have to make a case</p>
<p>for why this person&rsquo;s a changemaker</p>
<p>and apply the concepts from class.</p>
<p>So my question for each of you is,</p>
<p>who is a changemaker that inspires you,</p>
<p>famous or not, and why?</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s so many good ones, it&rsquo;s hard to pick favorites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately for me, I, in the last couple years especially,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, become really passionate</p>
<p>about plant-based living, and there is a woman,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if some of you have heard of her,</p>
<p>Miyoko Schinner, she recently made the Forbes&rsquo; 50 Over 50,</p>
<p>and she is completely just changing the game</p>
<p>in the plant-based food space.</p>
<p>She actually founded a vegan creamery several years ago</p>
<p>and is going toe to toe with the bigger industry</p>
<p>and getting, she&rsquo;s been doing this kind of work</p>
<p>for decades now, but she&rsquo;s finally at a point</p>
<p>where people are buying in and coming along</p>
<p>and you can start to see the change better for the planet,</p>
<p>for the animals, for health, for environment,</p>
<p>and she did something that I was never sure</p>
<p>that I would see the effects of in my lifetime</p>
<p>or at least not for several decades,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s through all that hard work</p>
<p>and just believing in your mission</p>
<p>and making those connections,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s really inspiring to watch.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have one that maybe is not as obvious,</li>
</ul>
<p>but does anyone know the podcast Dax Shepard,</p>
<p>Armchair Expert?</p>
<p>Yes, okay, so Dax Shepard is a comedian and actor,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s also married to Kristen Bell, yes,</p>
<p>and I think that he&rsquo;s a changemaker that inspires me</p>
<p>because he very openly talks about vulnerability,</p>
<p>and especially being, you know, a typical six-foot-four guy</p>
<p>and he has like lots of tattoos and he&rsquo;s really built</p>
<p>and all these stereotypes,</p>
<p>like you would never think that would be so vulnerable,</p>
<p>I think that he&rsquo;s doing so much</p>
<p>for people who look like him, people who sound like him,</p>
<p>people who dress like him and all those things,</p>
<p>because he always talks very deep into like very emotional,</p>
<p>vulnerable moments where even I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>ooh, that was a little too honest,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s been really enjoyable for me to listen</p>
<p>and I feel like he&rsquo;s doing a lot for especially men</p>
<p>and emotional intelligence,</p>
<p>so that just came to mind &lsquo;cause I love his podcast,</p>
<p>and I heard he thinks UC Berkeley is the best school,</p>
<p>so like if he ever sees this clip, then maybe he can come,</p>
<p>(audience laughs) but I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying</p>
<p>the way he talks to his guests with experts</p>
<p>and other celebrities too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mine is a little more close to home,</li>
</ul>
<p>but I&rsquo;d say my parents are some of the biggest changemakers</p>
<p>that I have drawn from.</p>
<p>You know, they were kinda the people that pushed me</p>
<p>to go beyond my comfort zone and the safety net</p>
<p>of being in the UK, and I&rsquo;d never lived away from home</p>
<p>or anything like that and kind of pushed me to just go</p>
<p>and see what was out there in America,</p>
<p>and I had no idea what I was getting myself into,</p>
<p>but they were very much like, you know,</p>
<p>any chances you don&rsquo;t take are those that are missed,</p>
<p>you know, and you&rsquo;re gonna fail,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna do things that you maybe wish you hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and things like that, but do it,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of the legacy my mom and dad have lived by,</p>
<p>and so you know, looking at them as changemakers</p>
<p>and people who have provided for me</p>
<p>and allowed me to kind of flourish in another country,</p>
<p>even thought it is so far away from home,</p>
<p>is something that I&rsquo;m grateful for and I, you know,</p>
<p>I, again, like didn&rsquo;t really view people like that</p>
<p>as changemakers before this,</p>
<p>but they have made such an impact on me</p>
<p>and become such a powerful, like,</p>
<p>relationship now because of that.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love it, I appreciate the wide variety</li>
</ul>
<p>of different changemakers that you all highlighted,</p>
<p>so to quote Brene Brown, again, she says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vulnerability is courage in you, but weakness in myself,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and we often think that way,</p>
<p>and so I really appreciate that someone is courageous enough</p>
<p>to ask the first question, so please,</p>
<p>just share your name and your affiliation with Haas</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s get to your question, thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, hi.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Julius, I&rsquo;m an exchange student from Germany,</p>
<p>and I recently became involved</p>
<p>with the effective altruism movement,</p>
<p>and I wanted to know what your thoughts are</p>
<p>on how they actually try to like do research</p>
<p>and identify the most pressing issues for a society,</p>
<p>and if you think this is an effective way to make change,</p>
<p>or if you have maybe not even heard of the movement,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;d be happy to elaborate,</p>
<p>but wanted to know what your thoughts are.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Would you mind elaborating?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can take, just really quickly,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>this is the faculty member question to answer,</p>
<p>so I mean I think it&rsquo;s really interesting,</p>
<p>the lens they&rsquo;re taking, so first of all,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re questioning the status quo, they&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>how can we do the most good in a limited amount</p>
<p>of time we have on Earth,</p>
<p>so I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful frame.</p>
<p>I think an important aspect that should be raised up</p>
<p>in the work that they do, perhaps, is the idea of empathy,</p>
<p>so sometimes they go in a very calculated way,</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s a role to think about, well also,</p>
<p>what are the human stories as well?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s I think both quantitative and qualitative</p>
<p>that could be important.</p>
<p>I think they go more on the quantitative side,</p>
<p>so that could be interesting way to balance it out,</p>
<p>but I think we need more people</p>
<p>that are questioning the status quo,</p>
<p>because traditional philanthropy</p>
<p>and other efforts aren&rsquo;t bringing about the systemic change</p>
<p>that we need, so I think it&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>to be questioning that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Julius] Thank you so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Laura Hassner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Full disclosure, I have the pleasure of teaching</p>
<p>with Alex in the Berkeley Changemaker,</p>
<p>but I promise he doesn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m asking this question.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>This is a question that our students have asked me</p>
<p>to ask you for a very long time,</p>
<p>and that is, what is your single best piece of advice</p>
<p>for our changemakers?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh. (all laugh)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I hacked this question</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause I created a 15-week class with all of my best advice,</p>
<p>and so I think I lean into having 30 hours</p>
<p>of it. - Read the book.</p>
<p>(laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think my single biggest piece</li>
</ul>
<p>of advice is to stop waiting for permission,</p>
<p>and to give it to yourself.</p>
<p>I think we can so often wait for someone else</p>
<p>to tell us that, okay, you&rsquo;re ready, you can go be a leader,</p>
<p>you can go be a changemaker,</p>
<p>and if you keep waiting and waiting and waiting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that that probably doesn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s very scary to put yourself out there,</p>
<p>but I think the most powerful thing</p>
<p>that begins the unlocking of your own changemaker journey,</p>
<p>and I hope that for many of you,</p>
<p>it might happen like literally right this moment,</p>
<p>in this room, is to say, yeah,</p>
<p>I could do something about this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to be the heropreneur, as Shannon said,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s ways that I can lead change in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true to who I am,</p>
<p>and it all starts with giving yourself that permission,</p>
<p>so this is my invitation to each of you</p>
<p>to take that invitation and to give yourself permission</p>
<p>and to start leading change,</p>
<p>so thank you Laura for that question.</p>
<ul>
<li>And&ndash; - I love that advice so much,</li>
</ul>
<p>we&rsquo;re so proud of you, congratulations.</p>
<ul>
<li>And building on that really quick, if you are someone you,</li>
</ul>
<p>if you know you have perfectionist tendencies, right,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just like, oh, I&rsquo;m just gonna wait</p>
<p>for that little extra bit before I start or it just,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t feel right, right,</p>
<p>like try to notice when that&rsquo;s happening (laughs)</p>
<p>and pause that thinking and just start,</p>
<p>because if you wait until you&rsquo;re ready,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kinda like having a kid, right, what they say,</p>
<p>if you wait until you&rsquo;re ready you&rsquo;ll just never have kids,</p>
<p>right, (laughs) so if you wait</p>
<p>until you really feel like you&rsquo;re ready,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably never gonna feel fully ready,</p>
<p>so just dive in and learn as you go and iterate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a process.</p>
<ul>
<li>To add to that, the best advice I got</li>
</ul>
<p>as a content creator is done is best, right?</p>
<p>Putting it out there is the best thing you could do</p>
<p>and everything after that is secondary, so done is best,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to also remind myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>It reminds me quite a bit of the nerves I felt</li>
</ul>
<p>on the first day of teaching Becoming a Changemaker,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m a brand new faculty member,</p>
<p>and you often hear about what it&rsquo;s like to be a student</p>
<p>on the first day, but not often from the faculty side,</p>
<p>and so I was teaching in N440,</p>
<p>and had no idea what to expect,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m, walked up the stairs</p>
<p>and walked into the classroom, kinda took a deep breath,</p>
<p>opened up the door, and at that moment,</p>
<p>what I saw nearly brought me to tears,</p>
<p>so I saw that not only was every single seat taken,</p>
<p>but there were students literally sitting in the side</p>
<p>of the room, on the window sills, like so many people,</p>
<p>they were hungry for this class,</p>
<p>and if I had just kept waiting for the class to be perfect,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never a time a class is perfect</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much that I didn&rsquo;t know at the time.</p>
<p>I tried to lean into the value of students always,</p>
<p>and sort of say, like look,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna learn all this together as we go,</p>
<p>but to at least just have that sort of confidence</p>
<p>without attitude to say, hey,</p>
<p>maybe this is something that can be a value</p>
<p>and lemme give it a shot,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s never a time that you&rsquo;re perfect,</p>
<p>so yeah, thanks for that.</p>
<p>You have a question?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, I&rsquo;m Kay Dawson with the Career Management Group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hi Shannon, welcome back. - Hi, thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, all of you, for being here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alicia, go TGB.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big week for Brits.</p>
<p>Some of you may have heard in the news, we have a new king.</p>
<p>The queen who&rsquo;s been in charge</p>
<p>of my entire life passed away last week,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s been a lot of calls for the monarchy to change.</p>
<p>I wanna ask all four of you,</p>
<p>which piece of the book would you underline</p>
<p>and present to King Charles,</p>
<p>(audience laughs) and what should he be doing</p>
<p>as a future changemaker in the public eye?</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe questioning the status quo is the obvious one,</li>
</ul>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think for me, I would say lead with compassion</li>
</ul>
<p>and vulnerability.</p>
<p>I think the monarchy is this very staunch British entity,</p>
<p>and particularly Charles, you know,</p>
<p>he hasn&rsquo;t really had to do a whole lot under the queen,</p>
<p>and you know, everyone&rsquo;s kind of looking to William,</p>
<p>and I think if we can get that impassioned leader</p>
<p>that everyone, you know, I guess is looking at Diana for,</p>
<p>if he can embody that,</p>
<p>then I think that might be the monarchy revived,</p>
<p>so I would underline the sections of, you know,</p>
<p>how to lead with that compassion and vulnerability.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Shannon] I default to the native Brit.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>My advice is to be a network-based leader,</li>
</ul>
<p>so again, we tend to put the single leader up on a pedestal</p>
<p>and look to them for all of the answers,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s more and more an outdated concept,</p>
<p>and so of course, being a king comes</p>
<p>with about as much formal authority as you can get,</p>
<p>but to think about, how can I be a node, not just a hub?</p>
<p>How can I empower those around me to also be part</p>
<p>of the efforts, to think a bit about,</p>
<p>how do I not just shift power but share power</p>
<p>so that other people are part of it?</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d be interested</p>
<p>in all of my advice there, but that&rsquo;s what I would like</p>
<p>(audience laughs) to see him do.</p>
<p>Thanks for that question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, I&rsquo;m Nelly, I&rsquo;m a third-year Haas undergrad student.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was wondering, in regards to the discussion</p>
<p>of un-gatekeeping success,</p>
<p>how do you all believe that Haas and other business schools</p>
<p>or companies can encourage/incentivize collaboration</p>
<p>among students rather than competition?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m super passionate about this question.</li>
</ul>
<p>I heard that the Haas curve is dropped, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s, - Yes.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t have that,</li>
</ul>
<p>but I think that that&rsquo;s a, - I didn&rsquo;t either.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think that&rsquo;s a huge step</li>
</ul>
<p>in the right&ndash; - Changemaking in action.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a huge step into the right direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what higher powers here made that happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy for the Haas students.</p>
<p>I think another thing, so that&rsquo;s a good one,</p>
<p>and then, think when it comes to community</p>
<p>and like a lot of opportunities, especially around career,</p>
<p>I know we have so many very competitive clubs here,</p>
<p>all that of which I got rejected to actually,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just a way we can open up a conversation</p>
<p>of like abundance mindset of like,</p>
<p>maybe we don&rsquo;t need to be admitting one person</p>
<p>to a consulting club a semester, right?</p>
<p>Like maybe we can open it up to five, right? (laughs)</p>
<p>And just opening the conversation about like,</p>
<p>the more people you have in organizations</p>
<p>or groups or clubs, these people are gonna be doing cool,</p>
<p>amazing things afterwards</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna probably wanna give back to,</p>
<p>so the more people you can get involved,</p>
<p>like the better it is gonna be for everyone,</p>
<p>so hopefully when it comes to clubs</p>
<p>and recreational things here,</p>
<p>I want to encourage students and faculty</p>
<p>or whoever is listening to,</p>
<p>maybe we can encourage to open up some seats</p>
<p>and opportunities.</p>
<p>I know sometimes it&rsquo;s a logistics thing,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s a big part of something</p>
<p>that we can actually improve</p>
<p>is like opening up spots. (laughs)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think for me, in another class actually,</li>
</ul>
<p>we also talked about collaboration and the importance of,</p>
<p>you know, that conflict that&rsquo;s task-oriented</p>
<p>and the diversity and bringing as many people together</p>
<p>to get these experiences,</p>
<p>and then we would take the final exam</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;d do all the projects on our own,</p>
<p>and the importance of collaboration, but as an individual,</p>
<p>we would take the exam or we would take the project,</p>
<p>and I would&rsquo;ve loved to take some more things as a group</p>
<p>and learn from those students</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d had those discussions with and things like that,</p>
<p>and the importance of, you know,</p>
<p>doing an end of year group project like we did.</p>
<p>Like it was like so important to me</p>
<p>that I got to speak to those people,</p>
<p>but I would&rsquo;ve loved to work with them</p>
<p>in my leadership class and stuff like that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I think building on that idea,</li>
</ul>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really good analogy here I think</p>
<p>when you talk about the process</p>
<p>of creating the defining principles through Haas, right,</p>
<p>and the four, Rich Lyons went through this whole process</p>
<p>to get these four defining principles up,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one thing to just create them</p>
<p>and then stick them on the wall</p>
<p>or stick them on the courtyard and then walk away</p>
<p>and then just expect people to start implementing them,</p>
<p>right, but if you really want those things to be embedded</p>
<p>in your culture,</p>
<p>you need to change fundamental processes, right?</p>
<p>You need to figure out how you can weave, you know,</p>
<p>what you value, or you say is important, into processes,</p>
<p>into everything you do,</p>
<p>so if you say collaboration&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still rewarding individual merit</p>
<p>and individual talents and you know,</p>
<p>maybe the loudest person in the room,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fundamental break from what you say you value,</p>
<p>right, so however you can embed collaboration</p>
<p>into day-to-day activities in terms of evaluations,</p>
<p>in terms of clubs, like you said,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll change over time if you can get there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great question, thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have time for one more question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, my name is Ryusei.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sophomore here at Berkeley,</p>
<p>probably getting into Haas, I don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>(all laugh)</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>And the question that I wanted</p>
<p>to ask was for all four of you,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>so every time I hire someone for my startup,</p>
<p>I ask them this question.</p>
<p>What do you think differentiates a good leader</p>
<p>from a great leader?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear what you guys think.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Terrific question, I&rsquo;ll go last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things, but the first, you know, again,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>going with my first instinct, humility, right?</p>
<p>You do not, it&rsquo;s funny, you don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>of the person leading change as being the first one</p>
<p>to say I don&rsquo;t know everything,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re in that space of being honest with yourself</p>
<p>and others that you don&rsquo;t know everything,</p>
<p>you open yourself up to learning more.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t make assumptions, you are constantly a student</p>
<p>of the world and student, a student of the areas you wish</p>
<p>to change, and I think</p>
<p>that humility also creates safe spaces</p>
<p>for other people to come to you with their thoughts</p>
<p>and suggestions, you know?</p>
<p>Would you rather go to someone with your thoughts</p>
<p>if they think they&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>you might actually make an impact and they&rsquo;d hear you,</p>
<p>or would you rather go to someone</p>
<p>who you figure is not gonna listen</p>
<p>to you because they already know it all, right?</p>
<p>So I would say, start with humility</p>
<p>and lots of good things follow from there.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d say, obviously, humility would probably be my top one,</li>
</ul>
<p>but I think the second most important for me is the ability</p>
<p>to listen, to listen, and not necessarily to talk,</p>
<p>and I feel like in this society,</p>
<p>everybody wants to get a word in, you know?</p>
<p>Like we all love the sound of our voices</p>
<p>and stuff like that, and listening to ourselves talk,</p>
<p>but having that leader that knows when to step back</p>
<p>and to listen, purely to hear people</p>
<p>and understand them is definitely</p>
<p>what makes me feel most valued, and I think sometimes,</p>
<p>and I get into this, you know, I have three sisters,</p>
<p>so we all wanna just talk at each other</p>
<p>and not necessarily listen,</p>
<p>and I feel like being able to hear each other out is one</p>
<p>of the most powerful things,</p>
<p>and I think that is something pretty rare in a great leader,</p>
<p>and is what makes them great and not necessarily good.</p>
<ul>
<li>Very similar to what everyone has just said,</li>
</ul>
<p>but for me, the biggest thing I,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m at my new grad job, I&rsquo;m only a year in,</p>
<p>but quickly, I can already sense, that&rsquo;s a good leader,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a good leader, you know?</p>
<p>And the big common theme</p>
<p>for me is really empathy leadership.</p>
<p>I think the work is the work,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of people can do good work,</p>
<p>but a really good leader is someone that you feel safe with</p>
<p>to talk to and just kindness,</p>
<p>I think, like that trust thing is such a big thing for me,</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;m seeing especially big,</p>
<p>successful organizations, there&rsquo;s a lot of talented people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of smart people, and the leaders</p>
<p>that really stick out to you</p>
<p>and the leaders you wanna follow to their next job</p>
<p>or you would go anywhere with or you would really want</p>
<p>to like actively spend time with are people</p>
<p>who are really empathy-driven leadership,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not always in the obvious way of like,</p>
<p>people with the highest ranking</p>
<p>or maybe they make more money than you or all these things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really, they could be maybe the same,</p>
<p>quote unquote, role as you, but they could be a leader</p>
<p>to you because they take time to listen</p>
<p>and really be developing those empathy skills,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the biggest thing that is like a way I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good leader and that&rsquo;s a bad leader,</p>
<p>is those types of skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m really passionate about inclusive leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a whole chapter dedicated to it,</p>
<p>entire week of the class dedicated to it,</p>
<p>and Juliet Bourke</p>
<p>and Andrea Espedido have done amazing research</p>
<p>on what makes a leader inclusive.</p>
<p>What they find is that there&rsquo;s sort of two superpowers,</p>
<p>when combined, leads to increased feelings of inclusion,</p>
<p>exponentially so, and so that&rsquo;s humility,</p>
<p>so I completely agree, being grounded in humility,</p>
<p>the second is an awareness of our biases.</p>
<p>When you have both humility and an awareness of our bias,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where feeling of inclusion skyrocket,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s what I look for in a leader</p>
<p>to truly be inclusive, is both of those.</p>
<p>Okay, as we wrap up, just a couple of announcements.</p>
<p>The first is that we will be selling books in the back,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very happy to sign books if anyone would like one,</p>
<p>and we also have 10 copies of the book to give away</p>
<p>for free, so if you look underneath your seat,</p>
<p>if you have a Post-it Note, you win a free book.</p>
<p>(audience members laugh)</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>so if&ndash;</p>
<p>(audience members cheer)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the lucky winners of the Post-it Note,</p>
<p>go see Sarah in the back to pick up your ticket.</p>
<p>(audience chatters)</p>
<p>All right, so with that, let me say,</p>
<p>thank you so much for being part</p>
<p>of this book launch celebration.</p>
<p>The world has never been more ready for you,</p>
<p>and thank you for being here, thanks everyone.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
