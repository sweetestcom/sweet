    <p>The following is a conversation with Neil Ferguson,</p>
<p>one of the great historians of our time,</p>
<p>at times controversial and always brilliant,</p>
<p>whether you agree with him or not.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an author of 16 books on topics covering</p>
<p>the history of money, power, war, pandemics, and empire.</p>
<p>Previously at Harvard, currently at Stanford,</p>
<p>and today launching a new university here in Austin, Texas</p>
<p>called the University of Austin,</p>
<p>a new institution built from the ground up</p>
<p>to encourage open inquiry and discourse</p>
<p>by both thinkers and doers,</p>
<p>from philosophers and historians</p>
<p>to scientists and engineers,</p>
<p>embracing debate, dissent, and self examination,</p>
<p>free to speak, to disagree, to think,</p>
<p>to explore truly novel ideas.</p>
<p>The advisory board includes Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt,</p>
<p>and many other amazing people with one exception, me.</p>
<p>I was graciously invited to be on the advisory board,</p>
<p>which I accepted in the hope of doing my small part</p>
<p>in helping build the future of education and open discourse,</p>
<p>especially in the fields of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>robotics, and computing.</p>
<p>We spend the first hour of this conversation</p>
<p>talking about this new university</p>
<p>before switching to talking about</p>
<p>some of the darkest moments in human history</p>
<p>and what they reveal about human nature.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Neil Ferguson.</p>
<p>You are one of the great historians of our time,</p>
<p>respected, sometimes controversial.</p>
<p>You have flourished in some of the best universities</p>
<p>in the world, from NYU to London School of Economics,</p>
<p>to Harvard, and now to Hoover Institution at Stanford.</p>
<p>Before we talk about the history of money, war, and power,</p>
<p>let us talk about a new university.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a part of launching here in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>It is called University of Austin, UATX.</p>
<p>What is its mission, its goals, its plan?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty obvious to a lot of people</p>
<p>in higher education that there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And that problem manifests itself</p>
<p>in a great many different ways.</p>
<p>But I would sum up the problem</p>
<p>as being a drastic chilling of the atmosphere</p>
<p>that constrains free speech, free exchange,</p>
<p>even free thought.</p>
<p>And I had never anticipated</p>
<p>that this would happen in my lifetime.</p>
<p>My academic career began in Oxford in the 1980s</p>
<p>when anything went.</p>
<p>One sensed that a university was a place</p>
<p>where one could risk saying the unsayable</p>
<p>and debate the undebatable.</p>
<p>So the fact that in a relatively short space of time,</p>
<p>a variety of ideas, critical race theory or wokeism,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it,</p>
<p>a variety of ideas have come along</p>
<p>that seek to limit and quite drastically limit</p>
<p>what we can talk about strikes me as deeply unhealthy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure, and I&rsquo;ve thought about this</p>
<p>for a long time, you can fix it</p>
<p>with the existing institutions.</p>
<p>I think you need to create a new one.</p>
<p>And so after much deliberation,</p>
<p>we decided to do it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a hugely timely opportunity</p>
<p>to do what people used to do in this country,</p>
<p>which was to create new institutions.</p>
<p>I mean, that used to be the default setting of America.</p>
<p>We sort of stopped doing that.</p>
<p>I mean, I look back and I thought,</p>
<p>why are there no new universities?</p>
<p>Or at least if there are,</p>
<p>why do they have so little impact?</p>
<p>It seems like we have the billionaires,</p>
<p>we have the need, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>So you still believe in institutions,</p>
<p>in the university, in the ideal of the university?</p>
<p>I believe passionately in that ideal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason they&rsquo;ve been around for nearly a millennium.</p>
<p>There is a unique thing that happens</p>
<p>on a university campus when it&rsquo;s done right.</p>
<p>And that is the transfer of knowledge between generations.</p>
<p>That is a very sacred activity.</p>
<p>And it seems to withstand major changes in technology.</p>
<p>So this form that we call the university predates</p>
<p>the printing press, survive the printing press,</p>
<p>continue to function through the scientific revolution,</p>
<p>the enlightenment, the industrial revolution to this day.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because,</p>
<p>maybe because of evolutionary psychology,</p>
<p>we need to be together in one relatively confined space</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in our late teens and early twenties</p>
<p>for the knowledge transfer between the generations</p>
<p>to happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my feeling about this,</p>
<p>but in order for it to work well,</p>
<p>there needs to be very few constraints.</p>
<p>There needs to be a sense</p>
<p>that one can take intellectual risk.</p>
<p>Remember, people in their late teens and early twenties</p>
<p>are adults, but they&rsquo;re inexperienced adults.</p>
<p>And if I look back on my own time as an undergraduate,</p>
<p>saying stupid things was my MO.</p>
<p>My way to finding good ideas</p>
<p>was through a minefield of bad ideas.</p>
<p>I feel so sorry for people like me today,</p>
<p>people age 18, 19, 20 today,</p>
<p>who are intellectually very curious</p>
<p>ambitious, but inexperienced</p>
<p>because the minefields today are absolutely lethal.</p>
<p>And one wrong foot and it&rsquo;s cancellation.</p>
<p>I said this to Peter Thiel the other day,</p>
<p>imagine being us now.</p>
<p>I mean, we were obnoxious undergraduates.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing that Peter did at Stanford</p>
<p>that Andrew Sullivan and I were not doing at Oxford.</p>
<p>And perhaps we were even worse,</p>
<p>but it was so not career ending</p>
<p>to be an absolutely insufferable,</p>
<p>obnoxious undergraduate then.</p>
<p>Today, if people like us exist today,</p>
<p>they must live in a state of constant anxiety</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to be outed for some heretical statement</p>
<p>that they made five years ago on social media.</p>
<p>So part of what motivates me</p>
<p>is the desire to give the me&rsquo;s of today a shot</p>
<p>at free thinking and really,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d call it aggressive learning,</p>
<p>learning where you&rsquo;re really pushed.</p>
<p>And I just think that stopped happening</p>
<p>on the major campuses because whether at Harvard</p>
<p>where I used to teach or at Stanford where I&rsquo;m now based,</p>
<p>I sense a kind of suffocating atmosphere of self censorship</p>
<p>that means people are afraid</p>
<p>to take even minimal risk in class.</p>
<p>I mean, just take, for example,</p>
<p>a survey that was published earlier this year</p>
<p>that revealed this is of undergraduates</p>
<p>in four year programs in the US.</p>
<p>85% of self described liberal students</p>
<p>said they would report a professor</p>
<p>to the university administration</p>
<p>if he or she said something they considered offensive.</p>
<p>And something like 75% said they do it</p>
<p>to a fellow undergraduate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of culture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s evolved in our universities.</p>
<p>So we need a new university in which none of that is true,</p>
<p>in which you can speak your mind, say stupid things,</p>
<p>get it completely wrong and live to tell the tale.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more going on, I think,</p>
<p>because when you start thinking about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong with a modern university,</p>
<p>many, many more things suggest themselves.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s an opportunity here</p>
<p>to build something that&rsquo;s radically new in some ways</p>
<p>and radically traditional in other ways.</p>
<p>For example, I have a strong preference</p>
<p>for the tutorial system that you see at Oxford and Cambridge,</p>
<p>which is small group teaching</p>
<p>and highly Socratic in its structure.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be great to bring that to the United States</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t really exist.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>I think we should be doing some very 21st century things,</p>
<p>making sure that while people are reading and studying</p>
<p>classic works, they&rsquo;re also going to be immersed</p>
<p>in the real world of technological innovation,</p>
<p>a world that you know very well.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to get a synthesis of the ancient and classical,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re gradually letting fade away</p>
<p>with the novel and technological.</p>
<p>So we wanna produce people who can simultaneously</p>
<p>talk intelligently about Adam Smith,</p>
<p>or for that matter, Shakespeare or Proust,</p>
<p>and have a conversation with you about where AI is going</p>
<p>and how long it will be before I can get driven here</p>
<p>by a self driving vehicle,</p>
<p>allowing me to have my lunch and prepare</p>
<p>rather than focus on the other crazy people on the road.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the dream that we can create something</p>
<p>which is partly classical and partly 21st century.</p>
<p>And we look around and we don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t see an institution</p>
<p>that you really think should exist,</p>
<p>I think you have a more responsibility to create it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking including something bigger</p>
<p>than just liberal education,</p>
<p>also including science, engineering and technology.</p>
<p>I should also comment that I mostly stay out of politics</p>
<p>and out of some of these aspects of liberal education</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of been the most controversial</p>
<p>and difficult within the university.</p>
<p>But there is a kind of ripple effect of fear</p>
<p>within that space into science and engineering</p>
<p>and technology that I think has a nature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s difficult to describe.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have a controversial nature.</p>
<p>It just has a nature of fear</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not, you mentioned saying stupid stuff</p>
<p>as a young 20 year old.</p>
<p>For example, deep learning, machine learning</p>
<p>is really popular in the computer science now</p>
<p>as an approach for creating artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>It is controversial in that space</p>
<p>to say that anything against machine learning,</p>
<p>saying, sort of exploring ideas that saying</p>
<p>this is going to lead to a dead end.</p>
<p>Now, that takes some guts to do as a young 20 year old</p>
<p>within a classroom to think like that,</p>
<p>to raise that question in a machine learning course.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculous because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to complain about this?</p>
<p>But the fear that starts in a course on history</p>
<p>or on some course that covers society,</p>
<p>the fear ripples and affects those students</p>
<p>that are asking big out of the box questions</p>
<p>about engineering, about computer science.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot, there&rsquo;s like linear algebra</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to change,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s like applied linear algebra,</p>
<p>which is machine learning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when robots and real systems touch human beings.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you have to ask yourself</p>
<p>these difficult questions about humanity,</p>
<p>even in the engineering and science and technology courses.</p>
<p>And these are not separate worlds in two senses.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just taken delivery of my copy of the book</p>
<p>that Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger have coauthored</p>
<p>on artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>the central question of which is,</p>
<p>what does this mean for us broadly?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not separate worlds in C.P. Snow&rsquo;s sense</p>
<p>of the chasm between science and arts,</p>
<p>because on a university campus,</p>
<p>everything is contagious from a novel coronavirus</p>
<p>to the behaviors that are occurring</p>
<p>in the English department.</p>
<p>Those behaviors, if denunciation becomes a norm,</p>
<p>undergraduate denounces professor,</p>
<p>teaching assistant denounces undergraduate,</p>
<p>those behaviors are contagious</p>
<p>and will spread inextricably first to social science</p>
<p>and then to natural sciences.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s part of the reason why</p>
<p>when this started to happen,</p>
<p>when we started to get the origins of disinvitation</p>
<p>and cancel culture,</p>
<p>it was not just a few conservative professors</p>
<p>in the humanities who had to worry,</p>
<p>everybody had to worry,</p>
<p>because eventually it was going to come</p>
<p>even to the most apparently hard stem part of the campus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s contagious.</p>
<p>This is something Nicholas Christakis should look at</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very good at looking at the way</p>
<p>in which social networks like the ones that exist</p>
<p>in a university can spread everything.</p>
<p>But I think when we look back and ask,</p>
<p>why did wokeism spread so rapidly</p>
<p>and rapidly out of humanities</p>
<p>into other parts of universities?</p>
<p>And why did it spread across the country</p>
<p>and beyond the United States</p>
<p>to the other English speaking universities?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a contagion.</p>
<p>And these behaviors are contagious.</p>
<p>The president of a university I won&rsquo;t name said to me</p>
<p>that he receives every day at least one denunciation,</p>
<p>one call for somebody or other to be fired</p>
<p>for something that they said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the crazy kind of totalitarianism light</p>
<p>that now exists in our universities.</p>
<p>And of course the people who want to downplay this say,</p>
<p>oh, well, there only have been a hundred and something</p>
<p>in disinvitations or,</p>
<p>oh, there really aren&rsquo;t that many cases.</p>
<p>But the point is that the famous events,</p>
<p>the events that get the attention</p>
<p>are responsible for a general chilling</p>
<p>that as you say, spreads to every part of the university</p>
<p>and creates a very familiar culture</p>
<p>in which people are afraid to say what they think.</p>
<p>Self censorship, look at the heterodox academy data on this</p>
<p>grows and grows.</p>
<p>So now a majority of students will say,</p>
<p>this is clear from the latest heterodox academy surveys,</p>
<p>we are scared to say what we think</p>
<p>in case we get denounced, in case we get canceled.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just not the correct atmosphere</p>
<p>for a university in a free society.</p>
<p>To me, what&rsquo;s really creepy</p>
<p>is how many of the behaviors I see</p>
<p>on university campuses today are reminiscent</p>
<p>of the way that people used to behave in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>or in the Soviet block or in Maoist China.</p>
<p>The sort of totalitarianism light</p>
<p>that I think we&rsquo;re contending with here,</p>
<p>which manifests itself as denunciations,</p>
<p>people informing on superiors.</p>
<p>Some people using it for career advantage.</p>
<p>Other people reduced to helpless desperate apology</p>
<p>to try to exonerate themselves.</p>
<p>People disappearing metaphorically, if not literally.</p>
<p>All of this is so reminiscent of the totalitarian regimes</p>
<p>that I studied earlier in my career</p>
<p>that it makes me feel sick.</p>
<p>And what makes me really feel sick</p>
<p>is that the people doing this stuff,</p>
<p>the people who write the letters of denunciation</p>
<p>are apparently unaware that they&rsquo;re behaving exactly</p>
<p>like people in Stalin&rsquo;s Soviet Union.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So they clearly have,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a massive educational failure.</p>
<p>If somebody can write an anonymous</p>
<p>or non anonymous letter of denunciation and not feel shame.</p>
<p>I mean, you should feel morally completely contaminated</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re doing that, but people haven&rsquo;t been taught</p>
<p>the realities of totalitarianism.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, I think you need to try</p>
<p>at least to create a new institution</p>
<p>where those pathologies will be structurally excluded.</p>
<p>So maybe a difficult question.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll push back on this,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re widely seen politically as a conservative.</p>
<p>Hoover Institution is politically conservative.</p>
<p>What is the role of politics at the University of Austin?</p>
<p>Because some of the ideas, people listening to this,</p>
<p>when they hear the ideas you&rsquo;re expressing,</p>
<p>they may think there&rsquo;s a lean to these ideas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a conservative lean to these ideas.</p>
<p>Is there such a lean?</p>
<p>There will certainly be people who say that</p>
<p>because the standard mode of trying to discredit</p>
<p>any new initiative is to say,</p>
<p>oh, this is a sinister conservative plot.</p>
<p>But one of our cofounders, Heather Heying,</p>
<p>is definitely not a conservative.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s as committed to the idea of academic freedom as I am.</p>
<p>But I think on political issues,</p>
<p>we probably agree on almost nothing.</p>
<p>And at least I would guess.</p>
<p>But politics, Max Weber made this point a long time ago,</p>
<p>that politics really should stop at the threshold</p>
<p>of the classroom, of the lecture hall.</p>
<p>And in my career, I&rsquo;ve always tried to make sure</p>
<p>that when I&rsquo;m teaching,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear where I stand politically,</p>
<p>though of course undergraduates</p>
<p>insatiably curiously want to know,</p>
<p>but it shouldn&rsquo;t be clear from what I say</p>
<p>because indoctrination on a political basis</p>
<p>is an abuse of the power of the professor,</p>
<p>as Weber rightly said.</p>
<p>So I think one of the key principles</p>
<p>of the University of Austin will be</p>
<p>that Weberian principle that politics</p>
<p>is not an appropriate subject</p>
<p>for the lecture hall, for the classroom.</p>
<p>And we should pursue truth</p>
<p>and enshrine liberty of thought.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s a political issue, then I can&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re against freedom of thought,</p>
<p>then we don&rsquo;t really have much of a discussion to have.</p>
<p>And clearly there are some people</p>
<p>who politically seem quite hostile to it.</p>
<p>But my sense is that there are plenty</p>
<p>of people on the left in academia.</p>
<p>I think of that interesting partnership</p>
<p>between Cornel West and Robbie George,</p>
<p>which has been institutionalized in the Academic Freedom Alliance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bipartisan, this issue.</p>
<p>It really, really is.</p>
<p>After all, 50 years ago, it was the left</p>
<p>that was in favor of free speech.</p>
<p>The right still has an anti free speech element to it.</p>
<p>Look how quickly they&rsquo;re out to ban critical race theory.</p>
<p>Critical race theory won&rsquo;t be banned</p>
<p>at the University of Texas.</p>
<p>Wokism won&rsquo;t be banned.</p>
<p>Everything will be up for discussion,</p>
<p>but the rules of engagement will be clear.</p>
<p>Chicago principles, those will be enforced.</p>
<p>And if you have to give a lecture on,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s just take a recent example,</p>
<p>the Dorian Abbott case.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re giving a lecture on astrophysics,</p>
<p>but it turns out that in some different venue</p>
<p>you express skepticism about affirmative action,</p>
<p>well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>We want to know what your thoughts are on astrophysics</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to be giving a lecture on.</p>
<p>That used to be understood.</p>
<p>I mean, at the Oxford of the 1980s,</p>
<p>there were communists and there were ultra Tories.</p>
<p>At Cambridge, there were people who were so reactionary</p>
<p>that they celebrated Franco&rsquo;s birthday,</p>
<p>but they were also out and out communists</p>
<p>down the road at King&rsquo;s College.</p>
<p>The understanding was that that kind of intellectual diversity</p>
<p>was part and parcel of university life.</p>
<p>And frankly, for an undergraduate,</p>
<p>it was great fun to cross the road</p>
<p>and go from outright conservatism,</p>
<p>ultra Torism to communism.</p>
<p>One learns a lot that way.</p>
<p>But the issue is when you&rsquo;re promoting</p>
<p>or hiring or tenuring people,</p>
<p>their politics is not relevant.</p>
<p>It really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And when it started to become relevant,</p>
<p>and I remember this coming up</p>
<p>at the Harvard history department late in my time there,</p>
<p>I felt deeply, deeply uneasy</p>
<p>that we were having conversations</p>
<p>that amounted to, well, we can&rsquo;t hire X person</p>
<p>despite their obvious academic qualifications</p>
<p>because of some political issue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what should happen at a healthy university.</p>
<p>Some practical questions.</p>
<p>Will University of Austin be a physical in person university</p>
<p>or virtual university?</p>
<p>What are some in that aspect where the classroom is?</p>
<p>It will be a real space institution.</p>
<p>There may be an online dimension to it</p>
<p>because there clearly are a lot of things</p>
<p>that you can do via the internet.</p>
<p>But the core activity of teaching and learning</p>
<p>I think requires real space.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve thought about this a long time,</p>
<p>debated Sebastian Thrun about this many, many years ago</p>
<p>when he was a complete believer in,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it the metaversity to go with the metaverse.</p>
<p>I mean, the metaversity was going to happen, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>But I never really believed in the metaversity.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do MOOCs because I just didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>A, be able to retain the attention,</p>
<p>B, be able to cope with the scaled grading that was involved.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a reason universities have been around</p>
<p>in their form for about a millennium.</p>
<p>You kind of need to all be in the same place.</p>
<p>So I think answer to that question</p>
<p>definitely a campus in the Austin area.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll start.</p>
<p>And if we can allow some of our content</p>
<p>to be available online, great, we&rsquo;ll certainly do that.</p>
<p>Another question is what kind of courses</p>
<p>and programming will it offer?</p>
<p>Is that something you can speak to?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your vision here?</p>
<p>We think that we need to begin more like a startup</p>
<p>than like a full service university from day one.</p>
<p>So our vision is that we start with a summer school,</p>
<p>which will offer provocatively the forbidden courses.</p>
<p>We want, I think, to begin by giving a platform</p>
<p>to the professors who&rsquo;ve been most subject</p>
<p>to council culture and also to give an opportunity</p>
<p>to students who want to hear them to come.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll start with a summer school</p>
<p>that will be somewhat in the tradition</p>
<p>of those institutions in the interwar period</p>
<p>that were havens for refugees.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re dealing here with the internal refugees</p>
<p>of the work era.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be an opportunity to test out some content,</p>
<p>see what students will come and spend time in Austin to hear.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s part A.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sort of, if you like, the launch product.</p>
<p>And then we go straight to a master&rsquo;s program.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can go to undergraduate education</p>
<p>right away because the established brands</p>
<p>in undergraduate education are offering something</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to compete with initially</p>
<p>because they have the brand, Harvard, Yale, Stanford,</p>
<p>and they offer also this peer network,</p>
<p>which is part of the reason people want so badly</p>
<p>to go to those places, not really the professors,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the classmates.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t wanna compete there initially.</p>
<p>Where there is, I think, room for new entrance</p>
<p>is in a master&rsquo;s program.</p>
<p>And the first one will be in entrepreneurship</p>
<p>and leadership.</p>
<p>Because I think there&rsquo;s a huge hunger</p>
<p>amongst people who want to get into,</p>
<p>particularly the technology world,</p>
<p>to learn about those things.</p>
<p>And they know they&rsquo;re not really going to learn</p>
<p>about them at business schools.</p>
<p>The people who are not going to teach them leadership</p>
<p>and entrepreneurship are professors.</p>
<p>So we want to create something that will be a little like</p>
<p>the very successful Schwarzman program in China,</p>
<p>which was come and spend a year in China</p>
<p>and find out about China.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be doing the same, essentially saying,</p>
<p>come and spend a year and find out about technology.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be a mix of academic content.</p>
<p>We want people to understand some of the first principles</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re studying.</p>
<p>There are first principles of entrepreneurship</p>
<p>and leadership, but we also want them to spend time with</p>
<p>people like one of our cofounders, Joe Lonsdale,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been a hugely successful venture capitalist</p>
<p>and learn directly from people like him.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of initial offering.</p>
<p>I think there are other master&rsquo;s programs</p>
<p>that we will look to roll out quite quickly.</p>
<p>I have a particular passion for a master&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in applied history or politics in applied history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a historian driven crazy by the tendency</p>
<p>of academic historians to drift away from</p>
<p>what seemed to me the important questions</p>
<p>and certainly to drift away from addressing</p>
<p>policy relevant questions.</p>
<p>So I would love to be involved in a master&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in applied history.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll build some programs like that</p>
<p>before we get to the full liberal arts experience</p>
<p>that we envisage for an undergraduate program.</p>
<p>And that undergraduate program is an exciting one</p>
<p>cause I think we can be innovative there too.</p>
<p>I would say two years would be spent doing</p>
<p>some very classical and difficult classical things,</p>
<p>bridging those old divides between arts and sciences.</p>
<p>But then there would also be in the second half</p>
<p>in the junior and senior years,</p>
<p>something somewhat more of an apprenticeship</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ll have centers, including a center</p>
<p>for technology engineering mathematics</p>
<p>that will be designed to help people make that transition</p>
<p>from the theoretical to the practical.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the vision.</p>
<p>And I think like any early stage idea</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll doubtless tweak it as we go along.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find things that work and things that don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But I have a very clear sense in my own mind</p>
<p>of how this should look five years from now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know about you.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m unusual as an academic</p>
<p>cause I quite like starting new institutions</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done a bit of it in my career.</p>
<p>You got to kind of know what it should look like</p>
<p>after the first four or five years</p>
<p>to get out of bed in the morning</p>
<p>and put up with all the kind of hassles of doing it.</p>
<p>Not least the inevitable flack that we were bound to take</p>
<p>from the educational establishment.</p>
<p>And I was graciously invited to be an advisor</p>
<p>to this University of Austin.</p>
<p>And the reason I would love to help</p>
<p>in whatever way I can is several.</p>
<p>So one, I would love to see Austin,</p>
<p>the physical location flourish intellectually</p>
<p>and especially in the space of science and engineering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really exciting to me.</p>
<p>Another reason is I am still a research scientist at MIT.</p>
<p>I still love MIT and I see this effort</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re launching as a beacon</p>
<p>that leads the way to the other elite institutions</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>I think too many of my colleagues</p>
<p>and especially in robotics kind of see,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t see robotics as a humanities problem.</p>
<p>But to me, robotics and AI will define much of our world</p>
<p>in the next century.</p>
<p>And for, not to consider all the deep psychological,</p>
<p>sociological, human problems associated with that.</p>
<p>To have real open conversations, to say stupid things,</p>
<p>to challenge the ideas that,</p>
<p>of how companies are being run, for example.</p>
<p>That is the safe space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to talk about the different</p>
<p>questions about technology when you&rsquo;re employed</p>
<p>by Facebook or Google and so on.</p>
<p>The university is the place to have those conversations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, and we&rsquo;re hugely excited</p>
<p>that you want to be one of our advisors.</p>
<p>We need a broad and an eclectic group of people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m excited by the way that group has developed.</p>
<p>It has some of the, some of my favorite intellectuals</p>
<p>are there, Steve Pinker,</p>
<p>for example, but we&rsquo;re also making sure</p>
<p>that we have people with experience in academic leadership.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a happy coalition of the willing,</p>
<p>looking to try to build something new,</p>
<p>which as you say, will be complimentary</p>
<p>to the existing and established institutions.</p>
<p>I think of the academic world as a network.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve moved from some major hubs in the network to others,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always felt that we do our best work,</p>
<p>not in a silo called Oxford, but in a silo</p>
<p>that is really a hub connected to Stanford,</p>
<p>connected to Harvard, connected to MIT.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I moved to the United States</p>
<p>was that I sensed that there was more intellectual action</p>
<p>in my original field of expertise, financial history.</p>
<p>And that was right.</p>
<p>It was a good move.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d have stagnated if I&rsquo;d stayed at Oxford.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I haven&rsquo;t lost connection with Oxford.</p>
<p>I recently went and gave a lecture there</p>
<p>in honor of Sir Roger Scruton,</p>
<p>one of the great conservative philosophers.</p>
<p>And the burden of my lecture was the idea</p>
<p>of the Anglosphere, which appealed a lot to Roger,</p>
<p>will go horribly wrong if illiberal ideas</p>
<p>that inhibit academic freedom spread</p>
<p>all over the Anglosphere.</p>
<p>And this network gets infected with these,</p>
<p>I think, deeply damaging notions.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think we&rsquo;re creating a new node.</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s a node that makes the network overall</p>
<p>more resilient.</p>
<p>And right now there&rsquo;s an urgent need for it.</p>
<p>I mean, there are people whose academic careers</p>
<p>have been terminated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll name two who are involved.</p>
<p>Peter Boghossian, who was harassed out of Portland State</p>
<p>for the reason that he was one of those intrepid figures</p>
<p>who carried out the grievance studies hoaxes,</p>
<p>exposing the utter charlatanry going on</p>
<p>in many supposedly academic journals</p>
<p>by getting phony gender studies articles published.</p>
<p>This is genius.</p>
<p>And of course, so put the noses out of joint</p>
<p>of the academic establishment</p>
<p>that he began to be subject to disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>So Peter is going to be involved.</p>
<p>And in a recent shocking British case,</p>
<p>the philosopher Kathleen Stock has essentially</p>
<p>been run off the campus of Sussex University in England</p>
<p>for violating the increasingly complex rules</p>
<p>about discussing transgender issues and women&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>She will be one of our advisors.</p>
<p>And I think also one of our founding fellows</p>
<p>actually teaching for us in our first iteration.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re creating a node that&rsquo;s badly needed.</p>
<p>Those people, I mean, I remember saying this</p>
<p>to the other founders when we first began</p>
<p>to talk about this idea to Barry Weiss</p>
<p>and to Panna Canellos as well as to Heather Haying.</p>
<p>We need to do this urgently because there are people</p>
<p>whose livelihoods are in fact being destroyed</p>
<p>by these extraordinarily illiberal campaigns against them.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no time to hang around</p>
<p>and come up with the perfect design.</p>
<p>This is an urgently needed lifeboat.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s start with that.</p>
<p>And then we can build something spectacular</p>
<p>taking advantage of the fact that all of these people have,</p>
<p>well, they now have very real skin in the game.</p>
<p>They need to make this a success.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure they will help us make it a success.</p>
<p>So you mentioned some interesting names</p>
<p>like Heather Haying, Barry Weiss, and so on.</p>
<p>Steven Pinker, somebody I really admire.</p>
<p>He too was under a lot of, quite a lot of fire.</p>
<p>Many reasons I admire him.</p>
<p>One, because of his optimism about the future.</p>
<p>And two, how little of a damn he seems to give</p>
<p>about like walking through the fire.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody more zen about walking through the fire</p>
<p>than Steven Pinker.</p>
<p>But anyway, you mentioned a lot of interesting names,</p>
<p>Jonathan Haidt is also interesting there.</p>
<p>Who is involved with this venture at this early days?</p>
<p>Well, one of the things that I&rsquo;m excited about</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re getting people from inside and outside</p>
<p>the academic world.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got Arthur Brooks, who for many years</p>
<p>ran the American Enterprise Institute very successfully,</p>
<p>has a Harvard role now teaching.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s somebody who brings, I think,</p>
<p>a different perspective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously a need to get experienced academic leaders</p>
<p>involved, which is why I was talking to Larry Summers</p>
<p>about whether he would join our board of advisors.</p>
<p>The Chicago principals owe a debt</p>
<p>to the former president of Chicago.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s graciously agreed to be in the board of advisors.</p>
<p>I could go on.</p>
<p>It would become a long and tedious list.</p>
<p>But my goal in trying to get this happy band to form</p>
<p>has been to signal that it&rsquo;s a bipartisan endeavor.</p>
<p>It is not a conservative institution</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to build.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an institution that&rsquo;s committed to academic freedom</p>
<p>and the pursuit of truth that will mean it when it takes</p>
<p>Robert Zimmer&rsquo;s Chicago principles</p>
<p>and enshrines them in its founding charter.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll make those something other than honored</p>
<p>in the breach, which they seem to be at some institutions.</p>
<p>So the idea here is to grow this organically.</p>
<p>We need, rather like the Academic Freedom Alliance</p>
<p>that Robbie George created earlier this year,</p>
<p>we need breadth.</p>
<p>And we need to show that this is not</p>
<p>some kind of institutionalization</p>
<p>of the intellectual dark web, though we</p>
<p>welcome founding members of that nebulous body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really something designed for all of academia</p>
<p>to provide a kind of reboot that I think we all agree is needed.</p>
<p>Is there a George Washington type figure?</p>
<p>Is there a president elected yet?</p>
<p>Or who&rsquo;s going to lead this institution?</p>
<p>Panos Kanellos, the former president of St. John&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>is the president of University of Austin.</p>
<p>And so he is our George Washington.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who Alexander Hamilton is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you to guess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny you mentioned IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.</p>
<p>Have you talked to your friend Sam Harris about any of this?</p>
<p>He is another person I really admire</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked to online and offline quite a bit</p>
<p>for not belonging to any tribe.</p>
<p>He stands boldly on his convictions</p>
<p>when he knows they&rsquo;re not going to be popular.</p>
<p>Like he basically gets canceled by every group.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t shy away from controversy.</p>
<p>And not for the sake of controversy itself,</p>
<p>he is one of the best examples to me</p>
<p>of a person who thinks freely.</p>
<p>I disagree with him on quite a few things,</p>
<p>but I deeply admire that he is what it looks</p>
<p>like to think freely by himself.</p>
<p>It feels to me like he represents</p>
<p>a lot of the ideals of this kind of effort.</p>
<p>Yes, he would be a natural fit.</p>
<p>Sam, if you&rsquo;re listening, I hope you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>I think in the course of his recent intellectual quests,</p>
<p>he did collide with one of our founders, Heather Haying.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have to model civil disagreements</p>
<p>at the University of Austin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely important that we should all</p>
<p>disagree about many things, but do it amicably.</p>
<p>One of the things that has been lost sight of,</p>
<p>perhaps it&rsquo;s all the fault of Twitter</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s something more profound,</p>
<p>is that it is possible to disagree in a civil way</p>
<p>and still be friends.</p>
<p>I certainly had friends at Oxford</p>
<p>who were far to the left of me politically,</p>
<p>and they are still among my best friends.</p>
<p>So the University of Austin has to be a place</p>
<p>where we can disagree vehemently,</p>
<p>but we can then go and have a beer afterwards.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, in my mind, a really important part</p>
<p>of university life, learning the difference</p>
<p>between the political and the personal.</p>
<p>So Sam is, I think, a good example, as are you,</p>
<p>of a certain kind of intellectual hero</p>
<p>who has been willing to go into the cyber sphere,</p>
<p>the metaverse, and carve out an intellectual space,</p>
<p>the podcast, and debate everything fearlessly.</p>
<p>His essay, it was really an essay on Black Lives Matter</p>
<p>and the question of police racism,</p>
<p>was a masterpiece of 2020.</p>
<p>And so he, I think, is a model of what we believe in.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t save the world with podcasts,</p>
<p>good though yours is,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a kind of solo element</p>
<p>to this form of public intellectual activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also there in Substack,</p>
<p>where all our best writers now seem to be,</p>
<p>including our founder, Barry Weiss.</p>
<p>The danger with this approach is, ultimately,</p>
<p>your subscribers are the people who already agree with you,</p>
<p>and we are all, therefore,</p>
<p>in danger of preaching to the choir.</p>
<p>I think what makes an institution like University of Austin</p>
<p>so attractive is that we get everybody together,</p>
<p>at least part of the year,</p>
<p>and we do that informal interaction at lunch, at dinner,</p>
<p>that allows, in my experience, the best ideas to form.</p>
<p>Intellectual activity isn&rsquo;t really a solo voyage.</p>
<p>Historians often make it seem that way,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve realized over time that I do my best work</p>
<p>in a collaborative way,</p>
<p>and scientists have been better at this</p>
<p>than people in the humanities.</p>
<p>But what really matters,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s magical about a good university,</p>
<p>is that interdisciplinary, serendipitous conversation</p>
<p>that happens on campus.</p>
<p>Tom Sargent, the great Nobel Prize winning economist and I,</p>
<p>used to have these kind of random conversations</p>
<p>in elevators at NYU or in corridors at Stanford,</p>
<p>and sometimes they&rsquo;d be quite short conversations,</p>
<p>but in that short, serendipitous exchange,</p>
<p>I would have more intellectual stimulus</p>
<p>than in many a seminar lasting an hour and a half.</p>
<p>So I think we want to get the Sam Harris&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and Lex Friedman&rsquo;s out of their darkened rooms</p>
<p>and give them a chance to interact</p>
<p>in a much less structured way than we&rsquo;ve got used to.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s that sense that sometimes</p>
<p>you need some freewheeling, unstructured debate</p>
<p>to get the really good ideas.</p>
<p>I mean, to talk anecdotally for a moment,</p>
<p>I look back on my Oxford undergraduate experience</p>
<p>and I wrote a lot of essays and attended a lot of classes,</p>
<p>but intellectually, the most important thing I did</p>
<p>was to write an essay on the Viennese satirist Karl Kraus</p>
<p>for an undergraduate discussion group called the Canon Club.</p>
<p>And I probably put more work into that paper</p>
<p>than I put into anything else,</p>
<p>except maybe my final examinations,</p>
<p>even although there was only really one senior member</p>
<p>present, the historian Jeremy Cato,</p>
<p>I was really just trying to impress my contemporaries.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the kind of thing we want.</p>
<p>The great intellectual leaps forward, occurred,</p>
<p>often in somewhat unstructured settings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Scotland, you can tell from my accent,</p>
<p>a little at least.</p>
<p>The enlightenment happened in late 18th century Scotland</p>
<p>in a very interesting interplay between the universities,</p>
<p>which were very important, Glasgow, Edinburgh,</p>
<p>St Andrews, and the coffee houses and pubs</p>
<p>of the Scottish cities where a lot of unstructured discussion</p>
<p>often fueled by copious amounts of wine took place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve missed over the last few years.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just think about how hard academic social life has become.</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;ve reached the point that Amy Chewer</p>
<p>becomes the object of a full blown investigation</p>
<p>and media storm for inviting to Yale Law School students</p>
<p>over to her house to talk.</p>
<p>I mean, when I was at Oxford, it was regarded</p>
<p>as a tremendous honor to be asked</p>
<p>to go to one of our tutors homes.</p>
<p>The social life of Oxford and Cambridge</p>
<p>is one of their great strengths.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sort of requirement to sip</p>
<p>unpleasant sherry with the dons.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve kind of killed all that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve killed all that in the US because nobody</p>
<p>dares have a social interaction with an undergraduate</p>
<p>or exchange an informal email in case</p>
<p>the whole thing ends up on the front page of the local</p>
<p>or student newspaper.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we need to kind of restore,</p>
<p>the social life of academia.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really address this sort of explicitly.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s magic to the interaction between students.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s magic in the interaction between faculty,</p>
<p>the people that teach.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the magic in the interaction</p>
<p>between the students and the faculty.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an iterative process that changes everybody involved.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like world experts in a particular discipline</p>
<p>are changed as much as the students,</p>
<p>as the 20 year olds with the wild ideas,</p>
<p>each are changed and that&rsquo;s the magic of it.</p>
<p>That applies in liberal education,</p>
<p>that applies in the sciences too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably maybe you can speak to this,</p>
<p>why so much scientific innovation</p>
<p>has happened in universities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the youthful energy</p>
<p>of like young minds, graduate students,</p>
<p>undergraduate students that inspire</p>
<p>some of the world experts</p>
<p>to do some of the best work of their lives.</p>
<p>Well, the human brain we know is at its most dynamic</p>
<p>when people are pretty young.</p>
<p>You know this with your background in math,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t get better at math after the age of 30.</p>
<p>And this is important when you think about</p>
<p>the intergenerational character of university.</p>
<p>The older people, the professors have the experience,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re fading intellectually</p>
<p>from much earlier than anybody really wants to admit.</p>
<p>And so you get this intellectual shot in the arm</p>
<p>from hanging out with people who are circa 20,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know shit, but brains are kind of like cooking.</p>
<p>I look back on the career I&rsquo;ve had in teaching,</p>
<p>which is over 25 years at where Cambridge, Oxford,</p>
<p>NYU, Harvard, and I have extremely strong relationships</p>
<p>with students from those institutions</p>
<p>because they would show up,</p>
<p>whether it was at office hours or in tutorials</p>
<p>and disagree with me.</p>
<p>And for me, it&rsquo;s always been about encouraging</p>
<p>some act of intellectual rebellion,</p>
<p>telling people, I don&rsquo;t want your essay to echo my views.</p>
<p>If you can find something wrong with what I wrote, great.</p>
<p>Or if you can find something I missed that&rsquo;s new, fantastic.</p>
<p>So there is definitely, as you said,</p>
<p>a magic in that interaction across the generations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s extraordinarily difficult, I think,</p>
<p>for an intellectual to make the same progress</p>
<p>in a project in isolation</p>
<p>compared with the progress that can be made</p>
<p>in these very special communities.</p>
<p>What does a university do?</p>
<p>Amongst other things,</p>
<p>it creates a somewhat artificial environment</p>
<p>of abnormal job security,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the whole idea of giving people tenure,</p>
<p>and then a relatively high turnover, new faces each year,</p>
<p>and an institutionalization of thought experiments</p>
<p>and actual experiments.</p>
<p>And then you get everybody living</p>
<p>in the same kind of vicinity</p>
<p>so that it can spill over into 3 a.m. conversation.</p>
<p>Well, that always seems to me</p>
<p>to be a pretty potent combination.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask ourselves a counterfactual question next.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that the world wars happen,</p>
<p>but there are no universities.</p>
<p>I mean, how does the Manhattan Project happen</p>
<p>with no academia, to take just one of many examples?</p>
<p>In truth, how does Britain even stay in the war</p>
<p>without Bletchley Park,</p>
<p>without being able to crack the German cipher?</p>
<p>The academics are unsung, or partly sung heroes</p>
<p>of these conflicts.</p>
<p>The same is true in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was a terribly evil and repressive system,</p>
<p>but it was good at science,</p>
<p>and that kept it in the game,</p>
<p>not only in World War II, it kept it in the Cold War.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s clear that universities are incredibly powerful,</p>
<p>intellectual force multipliers,</p>
<p>and our history without them would look very different.</p>
<p>Sure, some innovations would have happened without them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution didn&rsquo;t need universities.</p>
<p>In fact, they played a very marginal role</p>
<p>in the key technological breakthroughs</p>
<p>of the Industrial Revolution in its first phase.</p>
<p>But by the second Industrial Revolution</p>
<p>in the late 19th century,</p>
<p>German industry would not have leapt ahead</p>
<p>of British industry if the universities</p>
<p>had not been superior.</p>
<p>And it was the fact that the Germans institutionalised</p>
<p>scientific research in the way that they did</p>
<p>that really produced a powerful, powerful advantage.</p>
<p>The problem was that,</p>
<p>and this is a really interesting point</p>
<p>that Friedrich Meinlka makes in Die Deutsche Katastrophe</p>
<p>for the German Catastrophe,</p>
<p>the German intellectuals became technocrats, homo faber,</p>
<p>he says.</p>
<p>They knew a great deal about their speciality,</p>
<p>but they were alienated from, broadly speaking, humanism.</p>
<p>And that is his explanation,</p>
<p>or one of his explanations for why</p>
<p>this very scientifically advanced Germany</p>
<p>goes down the path of hell led by Hitler.</p>
<p>So when I come back and ask myself,</p>
<p>what is it that we want to do with a new university,</p>
<p>we wanna make sure that we don&rsquo;t fall into that German pit</p>
<p>where very high levels of technical and scientific expertise</p>
<p>are decoupled from the fundamental foundations</p>
<p>of a free society.</p>
<p>So liberal arts are there, I think,</p>
<p>to stop the scientists making Faustian pacts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>that people working on AI reach Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I think you said that academics are unsung heroes</p>
<p>of the 20th century.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s kind of an intellectual,</p>
<p>a lazy intellectual desire to kind of destroy</p>
<p>the academics, that the academics are the source</p>
<p>of all problems in the world.</p>
<p>And I personally believe that exactly as you said,</p>
<p>we need to recognize that the university</p>
<p>is probably where the ideas that will protect us</p>
<p>from the catastrophes that are looming ahead of us,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where those ideas are going to come from.</p>
<p>People who work on economics can argue back and forth</p>
<p>about John Maynard Keynes.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear</p>
<p>that he was the most important economist</p>
<p>and certainly the most influential economist</p>
<p>of the 20th century.</p>
<p>And I think his ideas are looking better today</p>
<p>in the wake of the financial crisis</p>
<p>than they have at any time since the 1970s.</p>
<p>But imagine John Maynard Keynes without Cambridge,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t because someone like that doesn&rsquo;t actually exist</p>
<p>without the incredible hothouse</p>
<p>that a place like Cambridge was in Keynes&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>He was a product of a kind of hereditary</p>
<p>intellectual elite, it had its vices.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t help but admire the sheer power of the mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of my career reading Keynes</p>
<p>and I revere that intellect, it&rsquo;s so, so powerful.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t have people like that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not prepared to have King&rsquo;s College Cambridge.</p>
<p>And it comes with redundancy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>There are lots and lots of things</p>
<p>that are very annoying about academic life</p>
<p>that you just have to deal with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re made fun of in that recent Netflix series,</p>
<p>The Chair.</p>
<p>And it is easy to make fun of academic life.</p>
<p>Tom Sharp&rsquo;s Porterhouse Blue did it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an inherently comical subject.</p>
<p>Professors at least used to be amusingly eccentric.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve sort of killed off that side of academia</p>
<p>by turning it into an increasingly doctrinaire place</p>
<p>where eccentricity is not tolerated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an illustration of this.</p>
<p>I had a call this morning from a British academic</p>
<p>who said, can you give me some advice</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to decolonize the curriculum.</p>
<p>This is coming from the,</p>
<p>diversity, equity and inclusion officers.</p>
<p>And it seems to me that what they&rsquo;re requiring of us</p>
<p>is a fundamental violation of academic freedom</p>
<p>because it is determining ex ante</p>
<p>what we should study and teach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing that we really, really have to resist</p>
<p>because that kills the university.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the moment that it stops being</p>
<p>the magical place of,</p>
<p>being the magical place of intellectual creativity</p>
<p>and simply becomes an adjunct</p>
<p>of the ministry of propaganda.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve loved the time we&rsquo;ve spent talking about this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a hopeful message</p>
<p>for the future of the university</p>
<p>that I still share with you</p>
<p>the love of the ideal of the university.</p>
<p>So very practical question.</p>
<p>You mentioned summer.</p>
<p>Which summer are we talking about?</p>
<p>So when, I know we don&rsquo;t wanna put hard dates here</p>
<p>but what year are we thinking about?</p>
<p>When is this thing launching?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>We are moving as fast as our resources allow.</p>
<p>The goal is to offer the first of the forbidden courses</p>
<p>next summer, summer of 2022.</p>
<p>And we hope to be able to launch an initial,</p>
<p>albeit relatively small scale master&rsquo;s program</p>
<p>in the fall of next year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s as fast as humanly possible.</p>
<p>So yeah, we&rsquo;re really keen to get going.</p>
<p>And I think the approach we&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>is somewhat imported from Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Think of this as a startup.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think of this as something that has to exist</p>
<p>as a full service university on day one.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the resources for that.</p>
<p>You did billions and billions of dollars</p>
<p>to build a university sort of as a facsimile</p>
<p>of an existing university,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what we want to do.</p>
<p>I mean, copying and pasting Harvard or Yale or Stanford</p>
<p>would be a futile thing to do.</p>
<p>They would probably, you very quickly end up</p>
<p>with the same pathologies.</p>
<p>So we do have to come up with a different design.</p>
<p>And one way of doing that is to grow it organically</p>
<p>from something quite small.</p>
<p>Elon Musk mentioned in his usual humorous way on Twitter</p>
<p>that he wants to launch</p>
<p>the Texas Institute of Technology and Science, TITS.</p>
<p>Some people thought this was sexist</p>
<p>because of the acronym, TITS.</p>
<p>So first of all, I understand their viewpoint,</p>
<p>but I also think there needs to be a place</p>
<p>for humor on the internet, even from CEOs.</p>
<p>So on this podcast, I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance</p>
<p>to talk to quite a few CEOs.</p>
<p>And what I love to see is authenticity.</p>
<p>And humor is often a sign of authenticity.</p>
<p>The quirkiness that you mentioned</p>
<p>is such a beautiful characteristic</p>
<p>of professors and faculty in great universities</p>
<p>is also beautiful to see as CEOs, especially founding CEOs.</p>
<p>So anyway, the deeper point he was making</p>
<p>is showing an excitement for the university</p>
<p>as a place for big ideas in science, technology, engineering.</p>
<p>So to me, if there&rsquo;s some kind of way,</p>
<p>if there is a serious thought that he had behind this tweet,</p>
<p>not to analyze Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter like it&rsquo;s Shakespeare,</p>
<p>but if there&rsquo;s a serious thought,</p>
<p>I would love to see him supporting the flourishing of Austin</p>
<p>as a place for science, technology,</p>
<p>for these kinds of intellectual developments</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>like make a place for free inquiry, civil disagreements,</p>
<p>coupled with great education and conversations</p>
<p>about artificial intelligence, about technology,</p>
<p>about engineering.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually gonna,</p>
<p>I hope there&rsquo;s a serious idea behind that tweet</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna chat with him about it.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>Most of the biggest storms in teacups of my academic career</p>
<p>have been caused by bad jokes that I&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>These days, if you wanna make bad jokes,</p>
<p>being a billionaire is a great idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to defend Elon&rsquo;s Twitter style</p>
<p>or sense of humor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna be remembered for his tweets, I think.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna be remembered</p>
<p>for the astonishing companies that he&rsquo;s built</p>
<p>and his contributions in a whole range of fields</p>
<p>from SpaceX to Tesla and solar energy.</p>
<p>And I very much hope that we can interest Elon</p>
<p>in this project.</p>
<p>We need not only Elon, but a whole range of his peers</p>
<p>because this takes resources.</p>
<p>Universities are not cheap things to run,</p>
<p>especially if, as I hope,</p>
<p>we can make as much of the tuition</p>
<p>covered by scholarships and bursaries.</p>
<p>We want to attract the best intellectual talent</p>
<p>to this institution.</p>
<p>The best intellectual talent</p>
<p>is somewhat randomly distributed through society.</p>
<p>And some of it is in the bottom quintile</p>
<p>of the income distribution.</p>
<p>And that makes it hard to get to elite education.</p>
<p>So this will take resources.</p>
<p>The last generation of super wealthy plutocrats,</p>
<p>the generation of the Gilded Age of the late 19th century,</p>
<p>did a pretty good job of funding universities.</p>
<p>Now Chicago wouldn&rsquo;t exist, but for the money of that era.</p>
<p>And so my message to not only to Elon,</p>
<p>but to all of the peers, all of those people</p>
<p>who made their billions out of technology</p>
<p>over the last couple of decades is this is your time.</p>
<p>I mean, and this is your opportunity</p>
<p>to create something new.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really understand why the wealthy of our time</p>
<p>are content to hand their money.</p>
<p>I mean, think of the vast sums Mike Bloomberg</p>
<p>recently gave to Johns Hopkins to established institutions.</p>
<p>When on close inspection, those institutions</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t seem to spend the money terribly well.</p>
<p>And in fact, one of the mysteries of our time</p>
<p>is the lack of due diligence</p>
<p>that hard nosed billionaires seem to do</p>
<p>when it comes to philanthropy.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s an opportunity here</p>
<p>for this generation of very talented, wealthy people</p>
<p>to do what their counterparts did in the late 19th</p>
<p>and early 20th century and create some new institutions.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t need to put their names on the buildings.</p>
<p>They just need to do what the founders of Chicago,</p>
<p>University of Chicago did,</p>
<p>create something new that will endure.</p>
<p>Yeah, MIT is launching a college of computing</p>
<p>and Stephen Schwarzman has given quite a large sum of money,</p>
<p>I think in total, a billion dollars.</p>
<p>And as somebody who loves computing,</p>
<p>as somebody who loves MIT, I want some accountability</p>
<p>for MIT becoming a better institution.</p>
<p>And this is once again,</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m excited about University of Austin</p>
<p>because it serves as a beacon.</p>
<p>Look, you can create something new</p>
<p>and this is what the great institutions</p>
<p>of the future should look like.</p>
<p>And Steve Schwarzman is also an innovator.</p>
<p>The idea of creating a college on the Tsinghua campus</p>
<p>and creating a kind of Rhodes program</p>
<p>for students from the Western world</p>
<p>to come study in China was Steve&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>And I was somewhat involved,</p>
<p>did some visiting, professing there.</p>
<p>It taught me that you can create something new</p>
<p>in that area of graduate education</p>
<p>and quite quickly attract really strong applicants</p>
<p>because the people who finished their four years</p>
<p>at Harvard or Stanford know that they don&rsquo;t know a lot.</p>
<p>And I, having taught a lot of people in that group,</p>
<p>know how intellectually dissatisfied they often are</p>
<p>at the end of four years.</p>
<p>I mean, they may have beautifully gamed the system</p>
<p>to graduate summa magna cum laude,</p>
<p>but they kind of know they&rsquo;ll confess it</p>
<p>after a drink or two.</p>
<p>They know that they gamed the system</p>
<p>and that intellectually it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the fulfilling experience they wanted.</p>
<p>And they also know that an MBA from a comparable institution</p>
<p>would not be a massive intellectual step forward.</p>
<p>So I think what we want to say is,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s something really novel, exciting,</p>
<p>that will be intellectually very challenging.</p>
<p>I do think the University of Austin has to be difficult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like it to feel a little bit like</p>
<p>surviving Navy SEAL training to come through this program</p>
<p>because it will be intellectually demanding.</p>
<p>That I think should be a magnet.</p>
<p>So yeah, Steve, if you&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>please join Elon in supporting this.</p>
<p>And Peter Thiel, if you&rsquo;re listening,</p>
<p>I know how skeptical you are about the idea</p>
<p>of creating a new university because heaven knows,</p>
<p>Peter and I have been discussing this idea for years</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s always said, well, no, we thought about this</p>
<p>and it just isn&rsquo;t gonna work.</p>
<p>But I really think we&rsquo;ve got a responsibility to do this.</p>
<p>Well, Steve&rsquo;s been on this podcast before.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spoken a few times, so I&rsquo;ll send this to him.</p>
<p>I hope he does actually get behind it as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m super excited by the ideas</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about that this effort represents</p>
<p>and what ripple effect it has on the rest of society.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>That was a time beautifully spent.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really grateful for the fortune</p>
<p>of getting a chance to talk to you</p>
<p>at this moment in history</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of your work</p>
<p>and the reason I wanted to talk to you today</p>
<p>is about all the excellent books you&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>about various aspects of history through money, war,</p>
<p>power, pandemics, all of that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad that we got a chance to talk about this,</p>
<p>which is not looking at history, it&rsquo;s looking at the future.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful little fortuitous moment.</p>
<p>I appreciate you talking about it.</p>
<p>In the book, Ascent of Money,</p>
<p>you give a history of the world through the lens of money.</p>
<p>If the financial system is a evolutionary nature,</p>
<p>much like life on earth,</p>
<p>what is the origin of money on earth?</p>
<p>The origin of money predates coins.</p>
<p>Most people kind of assume I&rsquo;ll talk about coins,</p>
<p>but coins are relatively late developments.</p>
<p>Back in ancient Mesopotamia,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know, 5,000 years ago,</p>
<p>there were relations between creditors and debtors.</p>
<p>There are even in the simplest economy</p>
<p>because of the way in which agriculture works.</p>
<p>Hey, I need to plant these seeds,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not gonna have crops for X months.</p>
<p>So we have clay tablets</p>
<p>in which simple debt transactions are inscribed.</p>
<p>I remember looking at great numbers of these</p>
<p>in the British Museum</p>
<p>when I was writing The Ascent of Money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really the beginning of money.</p>
<p>The minute you start recording a relationship</p>
<p>between a creditor and a debtor,</p>
<p>you have something that is quasi money.</p>
<p>And that is probably what these</p>
<p>clay tablets mostly denoted.</p>
<p>From that point on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great evolutionary experiment</p>
<p>to see what the most convenient way is</p>
<p>to record relations between creditors and debtors.</p>
<p>And what emerges in the time of the ancient Greeks</p>
<p>are coins, metal, tokens,</p>
<p>sometimes a valuable metal, sometimes not,</p>
<p>usually bearing the imprint of a state or a monarch.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the sort of more familiar form of money</p>
<p>that we still use today for very, very small transactions.</p>
<p>I expect coins will all be gone</p>
<p>by the time my youngest son is my age,</p>
<p>but the money that I have is still there.</p>
<p>My youngest son is my age,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re a last remnant of a very, very old way</p>
<p>of doing simple transactions.</p>
<p>And when you say coins, you mean physical coins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about coins have been rebranded</p>
<p>in the digital space as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, not coin based coins, actual coin coins.</p>
<p>You know, the ones that jangle in your pocket</p>
<p>and you kind of don&rsquo;t know quite what to do with</p>
<p>once you have some.</p>
<p>So that became an incredibly pervasive form</p>
<p>of paying for things.</p>
<p>Money&rsquo;s just a, it&rsquo;s just a crystallization</p>
<p>of a relationship between a debtor and a creditor.</p>
<p>And the coins are just very fungible.</p>
<p>Whereas a clay tablet relates to a specific transaction,</p>
<p>coins are generic and fungible.</p>
<p>They can be used in any transaction.</p>
<p>So that was an important evolutionary advance.</p>
<p>If you think of financial history,</p>
<p>and this was the point of the ascent of money,</p>
<p>as an evolutionary story, there are punctuated equilibria.</p>
<p>People get by with coins for a long time,</p>
<p>despite their defects as a means of payment,</p>
<p>such as that they can be debased, they can be clipped.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to avoid fake or debased money</p>
<p>entering the system.</p>
<p>But coinage is still kind of the basis of payments</p>
<p>all the way through the Roman Empire,</p>
<p>out the other end into the so called dark ages.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still how most things are settled</p>
<p>in cash transactions in the early 1300s.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get a big shift until after the Black Death,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s such a need to monetize the economy</p>
<p>because of chronic labor shortages</p>
<p>and feudalism begins to unravel,</p>
<p>that you just don&rsquo;t have a sufficient amount of coinage.</p>
<p>And so you get bills of exchange.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really into bills of exchange,</p>
<p>because, and this I hope will capture your listeners</p>
<p>and viewers imaginations,</p>
<p>when they start using bills of exchange,</p>
<p>which are really just pieces of paper saying,</p>
<p>I owe you over a three month period</p>
<p>while goods are in transit from Florence to London,</p>
<p>you get the first peer to peer payment system,</p>
<p>which is network verified,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not coins,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a King&rsquo;s head on them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just pieces of paper.</p>
<p>And the verification comes in the form of signatures.</p>
<p>And you need ultimately some kind of guarantee</p>
<p>if I write an IOU to you, bills of exchange,</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t really know me that well,</p>
<p>we only just met.</p>
<p>So you might wanna get endorsed by, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>somebody really credit worthy like Elon.</p>
<p>And so we actually can see in the late 14th century</p>
<p>in Northern Italy and England and elsewhere,</p>
<p>the evolution of a peer to peer network system</p>
<p>of payment.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually how world trade grows,</p>
<p>because you just couldn&rsquo;t settle</p>
<p>long oceanic transactions with coinage.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t practical.</p>
<p>All those treasure chests full of the balloons,</p>
<p>which were part of the way in which the Spanish empire worked</p>
<p>really inefficient.</p>
<p>So bills of exchange are an exciting part of the story.</p>
<p>And they illustrate something I should have made more clear</p>
<p>in the ascent of money,</p>
<p>that not everything used in payment needs to be money.</p>
<p>Classically, economists will tell you, oh, well, money,</p>
<p>money has three different functions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve heard this a zillion times, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a unit of account, it&rsquo;s a store of value,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>Now, there are three or four things</p>
<p>that are worth saying about this, and I&rsquo;ll just say two.</p>
<p>One, it may be that those three things are a trilemma,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very difficult for anything to be all of them.</p>
<p>This point was made by my Hoover colleague,</p>
<p>Manny Rincon Cruz last year,</p>
<p>and I still wish he would write this up as a paper</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a great insight.</p>
<p>The second thing that&rsquo;s really interesting to me</p>
<p>is that payments don&rsquo;t need to be money.</p>
<p>And if we go around, as economists love to do,</p>
<p>saying, well, Bitcoin&rsquo;s not money</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t fulfill these criteria,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re missing the point</p>
<p>that you could build a system of payments,</p>
<p>which I think is how we should think about crypto</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t money, doesn&rsquo;t need to be money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like bills of exchange.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s network based verification,</p>
<p>peer to peer transactions without third party verification.</p>
<p>When it hit me the other day</p>
<p>that we actually have this precedent for crypto,</p>
<p>I got quite excited and thought,</p>
<p>I wish I had written that in the Ascent of Money.</p>
<p>Can you sort of from a first principles,</p>
<p>like almost like a physics perspective,</p>
<p>or maybe a human perspective,</p>
<p>describe where does the value of money come from?</p>
<p>Like where is it actually, where is it?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a sheet of paper or it&rsquo;s coins,</p>
<p>but it feels like in a platonic sense,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some kind of thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually storing the value.</p>
<p>As us, a bunch of ants are dancing around and so on.</p>
<p>I come from a family of physicists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the black sheep of the family.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s a physicist, my sister is.</p>
<p>And so when you asked me to explain something</p>
<p>in physics terms, I get a kind of little part of me dies</p>
<p>because I know I&rsquo;ll fail.</p>
<p>But in truth, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p>
<p>what we decide money is going to be.</p>
<p>And anything can record, crystallize</p>
<p>the relationship between the creditor and the debtor.</p>
<p>It could be a piece of paper, it can be a piece of metal.</p>
<p>It can be nothing, can just be a digital entry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trust that we&rsquo;re really talking about here.</p>
<p>We are not just trusting one another.</p>
<p>We may not, but we are trusting the money.</p>
<p>So whatever we use to represent</p>
<p>the creditor debtor relationship,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a banknote or a coin or whatever,</p>
<p>it does depend on us both trusting it.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t always pertain.</p>
<p>What we see in episodes of inflation,</p>
<p>especially episodes of hyperinflation,</p>
<p>is a crisis of trust, a crisis of confidence</p>
<p>in the means of payments.</p>
<p>And this is very traumatic for the societies</p>
<p>to which it happens.</p>
<p>By and large, human beings,</p>
<p>particularly once you have a rule of law system</p>
<p>of the sort that evolved in the West</p>
<p>and then became generalized,</p>
<p>are predisposed to trust one another.</p>
<p>And the default setting is to trust money.</p>
<p>Even when it depreciates at a quite steady rate</p>
<p>as the US dollar has done pretty much uninterruptedly</p>
<p>since the 1960s, it takes quite a big disruption</p>
<p>for money to lose that trust.</p>
<p>But I think essentially what money should be thought of as</p>
<p>is a series of tokens that can take any form we like</p>
<p>and can be purely digital,</p>
<p>which represent our transactions as creditors and debtors.</p>
<p>And the whole thing depends on our collective trust to work.</p>
<p>I had to explain this to Stephen Colbert once</p>
<p>in the Colbert Show, the old show that was actually funny.</p>
<p>And it was a great moment when he said,</p>
<p>so Neil, could I be money?</p>
<p>And I said, yes, we could settle a debt</p>
<p>with a human being that was quite common in much of history,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the most convenient form of money.</p>
<p>Money has to be convenient.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why when they worked out</p>
<p>how to make payments with cell phones,</p>
<p>the Chinese simply went straight there from bank accounts.</p>
<p>They skipped out credit cards.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t see credit cards in China,</p>
<p>except in the hands of naive tourists.</p>
<p>How much can this trust bear</p>
<p>in terms of us humans with our human nature testing it?</p>
<p>I guess the surprising thing is the thing works.</p>
<p>A bunch of self interested ants running around</p>
<p>trading in trust.</p>
<p>And it seems to work except for a bunch of moments</p>
<p>in human history when there&rsquo;s hyperinflation,</p>
<p>like you mentioned.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just kind of amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing that us humans,</p>
<p>if I were to be optimistic and sort of hopeful</p>
<p>about human nature, it gives me a sense</p>
<p>that people want to lean on each other.</p>
<p>They want to trust.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly, I would say probably now,</p>
<p>a widely shared view amongst evolutionary psychologists,</p>
<p>network scientists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of Nicholas Christakis&rsquo;s argument</p>
<p>in a recent book.</p>
<p>I know economic history broadly bears this out,</p>
<p>but you have to be cautious.</p>
<p>The cases where the system works are familiar to us.</p>
<p>Because those are the states and the eras</p>
<p>that produce a lot of written records.</p>
<p>But when the system of trust collapses</p>
<p>and the monetary system collapses with it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s generally quite a paucity of records.</p>
<p>I found that when I was writing Doom.</p>
<p>And so we slightly are biased in favor of the periods</p>
<p>when trust prevailed and the system functioned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to point to a great many episodes</p>
<p>of very, very intense monetary chaos,</p>
<p>even in the relatively recent past.</p>
<p>In the wake of the First World War,</p>
<p>multiple currencies, not just the German currency,</p>
<p>multiple currencies were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The Russian currency, the Polish currency.</p>
<p>There were currency disasters all over</p>
<p>Central and Eastern Europe in the early 1920s.</p>
<p>And that was partly because over the course</p>
<p>of the 19th century, a system had evolved</p>
<p>in which trust was based on gold</p>
<p>and rules that were supposedly applied by central banks.</p>
<p>That system, which produced relative price stability</p>
<p>over the 19th century, fell apart</p>
<p>as a result of the First World War.</p>
<p>And as soon as it was gone, as soon as there was no longer</p>
<p>a clear link between those banknotes and coins and gold,</p>
<p>the whole thing went completely haywire.</p>
<p>And I think we should remember that the extent</p>
<p>of the monetary chaos from certainly 1918</p>
<p>all the way through to the late 1940s.</p>
<p>I mean, the German currency was destroyed</p>
<p>not once but twice in that period.</p>
<p>And that was one of the most advanced economies</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>In the United States, there were periods</p>
<p>of intensely deep deflation.</p>
<p>Prices fell by a third in the Great Depression.</p>
<p>And then very serious price volatility</p>
<p>in the immediate post World War II period.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bit of an illusion.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s an illusion for people who&rsquo;ve spent most</p>
<p>of their lives in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a period of exceptional price stability</p>
<p>since this century began in which a regime</p>
<p>of central bank independence and inflation targeting</p>
<p>appeared to generate steady below 2% inflation</p>
<p>in much of the developed world.</p>
<p>It was a bit too low for the central bankers liking.</p>
<p>And that became a problem in the financial crisis.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve avoided major price instability</p>
<p>for the better part of 20 years.</p>
<p>In most of the world, there haven&rsquo;t really been</p>
<p>that many very high inflation episodes</p>
<p>and hardly any hyperinflationary episodes.</p>
<p>Venezuela&rsquo;s one of the very few, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s another.</p>
<p>But if you take a 100 year view or a 200 year view,</p>
<p>or if you want to take a 500 year view,</p>
<p>you realize that quite often the system doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>If you go back to the 17th century,</p>
<p>there were multiple competing systems of coinage.</p>
<p>There had been a great inflation that had begun</p>
<p>the previous century.</p>
<p>The price revolution caused mainly by the rise</p>
<p>and caused mainly by the arrival of new world silver.</p>
<p>I think financial history is a bit messier</p>
<p>than one might think.</p>
<p>And the more one studies it, the more one realizes</p>
<p>the need for the evolution.</p>
<p>The reason bills of exchange came along</p>
<p>was because the coinage systems had stopped working.</p>
<p>The reason that banknotes started to become used</p>
<p>more generally first in the American colonies</p>
<p>in the 17th century, then more widely in the 18th century</p>
<p>was just that they were more convenient than any other way</p>
<p>of paying for things.</p>
<p>We had to invent the bond market in the 18th century</p>
<p>to cope with the problem of public debt,</p>
<p>which up until that point had been a recurrent source</p>
<p>of instability.</p>
<p>And then we invented equity finance</p>
<p>because bonds were not enough.</p>
<p>So I would prefer to think of the financial history</p>
<p>as a series of crises really that are resolved</p>
<p>by innovations and in the most recent episode,</p>
<p>very exciting episode of financial history,</p>
<p>something called Bitcoin initiated a new financial</p>
<p>or monetary revolution in response, I think,</p>
<p>to the growing crisis of the fiat money system.</p>
<p>Can you speak to that?</p>
<p>So what do you think about Bitcoin?</p>
<p>What do you think it is a response to?</p>
<p>What are the growing problems of the fiat system?</p>
<p>What is this moment in human history</p>
<p>that is full of challenges that Bitcoin</p>
<p>and cryptocurrency is trying to overcome?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Bitcoin was devised by Satoshi,</p>
<p>whoever he was, for fear of a breakdown</p>
<p>of the fiat currencies.</p>
<p>If it was, it was a very far sighted enterprise</p>
<p>because certainly in 2008,</p>
<p>when the first Bitcoin paper appeared,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t very likely that a wave of inflation was coming.</p>
<p>If anything, there was more reason</p>
<p>to fear deflation at that point.</p>
<p>I think it would be more accurate to say</p>
<p>that with the advent of the internet,</p>
<p>there was a need for a means of payment</p>
<p>native to the internet,</p>
<p>typing your credit card number into a random website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the way to pay for things on the internet.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d rather think of Bitcoin as the first iteration,</p>
<p>the first attempt to solve the problem</p>
<p>of how do we pay for things</p>
<p>in what we must learn to call the metaverse,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just call it the internet for old time&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>And ever since that initial innovation,</p>
<p>the realization that you could use computing power</p>
<p>and cryptography to create peer to peer payments</p>
<p>without third party verification,</p>
<p>a revolution has been gathering momentum</p>
<p>that poses a very profound threat</p>
<p>to the existing legacy system of banks and fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Most money in the world today is made by banks,</p>
<p>not central banks, banks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what most money is, it&rsquo;s entries in bank accounts.</p>
<p>And what Bitcoin represents</p>
<p>is an alternative mode of payment</p>
<p>that really ought to render banks obsolete.</p>
<p>I think this financial revolution</p>
<p>has got past the point at which it can be killed.</p>
<p>It was vulnerable in the early years,</p>
<p>but it now has sufficient adoption</p>
<p>and has generated sufficient additional layers.</p>
<p>I mean, Ethereum was in many ways</p>
<p>the more important innovation</p>
<p>because you can build a whole system of payments</p>
<p>and ultimately smart contracts on top of ether.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve now reached the point</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s pretty hard to imagine it all being killed.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just survived an amazing thing,</p>
<p>which was the Chinese shutting down mining</p>
<p>and shutting down everything.</p>
<p>And still here we are, in fact, cryptos thriving.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t know is how much damage</p>
<p>ill judged regulatory interventions are going to do</p>
<p>to this financial revolution.</p>
<p>Left to its own devices,</p>
<p>I think decentralized finance provides</p>
<p>the native monetary and financial system for the internet.</p>
<p>And the more time we spend in the metaverse,</p>
<p>the more use we will make of it.</p>
<p>The next things that will happen, I think,</p>
<p>will be that tokens in game spaces like Roblox</p>
<p>will become fungible.</p>
<p>As my nine year old spends a lot more time</p>
<p>playing on computer games than I ever did,</p>
<p>I can see that entertainment</p>
<p>is becoming a game driven phenomenon.</p>
<p>And in the game space, you need skins for your avatar.</p>
<p>The economics of the internet, it&rsquo;s evolving very fast.</p>
<p>And in parallel,</p>
<p>you can see this payments revolution happening.</p>
<p>I think that all goes naturally very well</p>
<p>and generates an enormous amount of wealth in the process.</p>
<p>The problem is there are people in Washington</p>
<p>with an overwhelming urge to intervene</p>
<p>and disrupt this evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Partly, I think out of a muddled sense</p>
<p>that there must be a lot of nefarious things going on.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t step in, many more will go on.</p>
<p>This, I think, greatly exaggerates</p>
<p>how much criminal activity is in fact going on in the space.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also the vested interests at work.</p>
<p>It was odd to me, maybe not odd,</p>
<p>perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t surprising,</p>
<p>that the Bank for International Settlements</p>
<p>earlier this year published a report,</p>
<p>one chapter of which said this must all go, must all stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all gotta be shut down</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gotta be replaced by central bank digital currency.</p>
<p>And Martin Wolf in the Financial Times read this</p>
<p>and said, I agree with this.</p>
<p>And one suddenly realized that the banks are clever.</p>
<p>They had achieved the intellectual counterattack</p>
<p>with almost no fingerprints on the weapon.</p>
<p>I think central bank digital currency is a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine why we would want to copy a Chinese model</p>
<p>that essentially takes all transactions</p>
<p>and puts them directly under the surveillance</p>
<p>of a central government institution.</p>
<p>But that suddenly is a serious counterproposal.</p>
<p>So on the one side, we have a relatively decentralized,</p>
<p>technologically innovative internet native system</p>
<p>of payments that has the possibility to evolve,</p>
<p>to produce a full set of smart contracts,</p>
<p>reducing enormously the transaction costs</p>
<p>that we currently encounter in the financial world</p>
<p>because it gets rid of all those middlemen</p>
<p>who take their cut every time you take out a mortgage</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one alternative.</p>
<p>But on the other side, we have a highly centralized system</p>
<p>in which transactions will by default</p>
<p>be under the surveillance of the central bank.</p>
<p>It seems like an easy choice to me,</p>
<p>but hey, I have this thing about personal liberty.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the regulators can kill web three.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re supposed to call it web three</p>
<p>because crypto is now an obsolescent term.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t kill it,</p>
<p>but they can definitely make it difficult</p>
<p>and throw a lot of sand into the machine.</p>
<p>And I think worst of all,</p>
<p>they can spoil the evolutionary story</p>
<p>by creating central bank digital currency</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think we really need.</p>
<p>Or we certainly don&rsquo;t need it in the Chinese form.</p>
<p>Do you think Bitcoin has a strong chance</p>
<p>to take over the world?</p>
<p>So become the primary,</p>
<p>you mentioned the three things that make money, money,</p>
<p>become the primary methodology</p>
<p>by which we store wealth, we exchange.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, I think what Bitcoin is,</p>
<p>this was a phrase that I got from my friend,</p>
<p>Matt McLennan at First Eagle,</p>
<p>an option on digital gold.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the gold of the system,</p>
<p>but currently behaves like an option.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s quite volatile</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>if this brave new world of crypto is gonna work.</p>
<p>But if it does work, then Bitcoin is the gold</p>
<p>because of the finite supply.</p>
<p>What role we need gold to play in the metaverse</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t quite clear.</p>
<p>I love that you&rsquo;re using the term metaverse.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Well, I just like the metaversity</p>
<p>as the antithesis of what we&rsquo;re trying to do in Austin.</p>
<p>But can you imagine I&rsquo;m using it sarcastically?</p>
<p>I come from Glasgow where all novel words</p>
<p>have to be used sarcastically.</p>
<p>So the metaverse, sarcastic.</p>
<p>But see, the beauty about humor and sarcasm</p>
<p>is that the joke becomes reality.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like using the word Big Bang</p>
<p>to describe the origins of the universe.</p>
<p>It becomes like that.</p>
<p>It will.</p>
<p>After a while, it&rsquo;s in the textbooks</p>
<p>and nobody&rsquo;s laughing.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Humor is sticky.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m on the side of humor,</p>
<p>but it is a dangerous activity these days.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think Bitcoin is the option of digital gold.</p>
<p>The role it plays is probably not so much store of value.</p>
<p>Right now, it&rsquo;s just nicely not very correlated asset</p>
<p>in your portfolio.</p>
<p>When I updated the Ascent of Money,</p>
<p>which was in 2018, 10 years after it came out,</p>
<p>I wrote a new chapter in which I said,</p>
<p>Bitcoin, which had just sold off after its 2017 bubble,</p>
<p>will rise again through adoption</p>
<p>because if every millionaire in the world</p>
<p>has 0.2% of his or her wealth in Bitcoin,</p>
<p>the price should be $15,000.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s 1%, it&rsquo;s $75,000.</p>
<p>And it might not even stay at 1%</p>
<p>because, I mean, look at its recent performance.</p>
<p>If your exposure to global stocks had been hedged</p>
<p>with a significant crypto holding,</p>
<p>you would have aced the last few months.</p>
<p>So I think the non correlation property</p>
<p>is very, very important in driving adoption.</p>
<p>And the volatility also drives adoption</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a sophisticated investor.</p>
<p>So I think the adoption drives Bitcoin up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the option of digital gold,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just this nicely not very correlated asset</p>
<p>that you wanna hold.</p>
<p>In a world where, what the hell?</p>
<p>I mean, the central bank&rsquo;s gonna tighten.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come through this massively disruptive effort</p>
<p>of the pandemic, public debt soared,</p>
<p>money printing soared.</p>
<p>You could hang around with your bonds</p>
<p>and wait for the euthanasia of the Rontier.</p>
<p>You can hang on to your tech stocks</p>
<p>and just hope there isn&rsquo;t a massive correction</p>
<p>or dot, dot, dot.</p>
<p>Well, and it seems like a fairly obvious strategy</p>
<p>to make sure that you have at least some crypto</p>
<p>for the coming year, given what we likely have to face.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s really interesting is that</p>
<p>on top of Ethereum,</p>
<p>a more elaborate financial system is being built.</p>
<p>Stable coins are the interesting puzzle for me</p>
<p>because we need off ramps.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you and I have to pay taxes in US dollars.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no getting away from that.</p>
<p>The IRS is gonna let us hold crypto</p>
<p>as long as we pay our taxes.</p>
<p>And the only question in my mind is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the optimal off ramp to make those taxes,</p>
<p>make those tax payments?</p>
<p>Probably it shouldn&rsquo;t be a currency invented by Facebook.</p>
<p>Never struck me as the best solution to this problem.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s some kind of Fed coin</p>
<p>or maybe one of the existing algorithmic stable coins</p>
<p>does the job.</p>
<p>But we clearly need some stable off ramp.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible for the IRS</p>
<p>within the next decade to be accepting Bitcoin</p>
<p>as tax payments?</p>
<p>I doubt that.</p>
<p>Having dealt with the IRS now</p>
<p>since when did I first come here, 2002,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to think of an institution less likely</p>
<p>to leap into the 21st century when it comes to payments.</p>
<p>No, I think we&rsquo;ll be tolerated, crypto world will be tolerated</p>
<p>as long as we pay our taxes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important that we&rsquo;re already at that point.</p>
<p>And then the next question becomes,</p>
<p>well, does Gary Gensler define everything as a security?</p>
<p>And do we then have to go through endless</p>
<p>regulatory contortions to satisfy the SEC?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of uncertainties</p>
<p>that the administrative state excels at creating</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s just how the administrative state works.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll do something new.</p>
<p>Hmm, I&rsquo;ll decide whether that&rsquo;s a security</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t expect me to define it for you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll decide in an arbitrary way and then you&rsquo;ll owe me money.</p>
<p>So all of this is going to be very annoying.</p>
<p>And for people who are trying to run exchanges</p>
<p>or innovate in the space, these regulations will be annoying.</p>
<p>But the problem with FinTech is it&rsquo;s different from tech,</p>
<p>broadly defined.</p>
<p>When tech got into eCommerce with Amazon,</p>
<p>when it got into social networking with Facebook,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t a huge regulatory jungle to navigate.</p>
<p>But welcome to the world of finance,</p>
<p>which has always been a jungle of regulation</p>
<p>because the regulation is there to basically entrench</p>
<p>the incumbents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be a much tougher fight than the fights</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen of other aspects of the tech revolution</p>
<p>because the incumbents are there and they see the threat.</p>
<p>And in the end, Satoshi said it very explicitly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s peer to peer payment without third party verification.</p>
<p>And all the third parties are going, wait, what?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the third parties.</p>
<p>So there is a connection between power and money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned World War I from the perspective of money.</p>
<p>So power, money, war, authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>From the perspective of money,</p>
<p>do you have hope that cryptocurrency can help resist war,</p>
<p>can help resist the negative effects</p>
<p>of authoritarian regimes?</p>
<p>Or is that a silly hope?</p>
<p>Wars happen because the people who have the power</p>
<p>to command armed forces miscalculate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s generally what happens.</p>
<p>And we will have a big war in the near future</p>
<p>if both the Chinese government and the US government</p>
<p>miscalculates and they unleash lethal force on one another.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing that any financial institution</p>
<p>can do to stop that any more than the Rothschilds</p>
<p>could stop World War I.</p>
<p>And they were then the biggest bank in the world by far</p>
<p>with massive international financial influence.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s accept that war is in a different domain.</p>
<p>War would impact the financial world massively</p>
<p>if it were a war between the United States and China</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s still a huge China trade on.</p>
<p>Wall Street is long China, Europe is long China.</p>
<p>So the conflict that I can foresee in the future</p>
<p>is one that&rsquo;s highly financially disruptive.</p>
<p>Where does crypto fit in?</p>
<p>Crypto&rsquo;s obvious utility in the short run</p>
<p>is as a store of wealth, of transferable wealth</p>
<p>for people who live in a world</p>
<p>of transferable wealth for people who live</p>
<p>in dangerous places with failing,</p>
<p>not just failing money, but failing rule of law.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why in Latin America,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much interest in crypto</p>
<p>because Latin Americans have a lot of monetary history</p>
<p>to look back on and not much of it is good.</p>
<p>So I think that the short run problem that crypto solves</p>
<p>is, and this goes back to the digital gold point,</p>
<p>if you are in a dangerous place with weak rule of law</p>
<p>and weak property rights,</p>
<p>here is a new and better way to have portable wealth.</p>
<p>I think the next question to ask is,</p>
<p>would you want to be long crypto</p>
<p>in the event of World War III?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about that question</p>
<p>is that World War III would likely have</p>
<p>a significant cyber dimension to it.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to be 100% in crypto</p>
<p>if they crash the internet,</p>
<p>which between them, China and Russia might be able to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating question,</p>
<p>whether you want to be holding physical gold</p>
<p>or digital gold in the event of World War III.</p>
<p>The smart person who studied history</p>
<p>definitely wants a bit of both.</p>
<p>And so let&rsquo;s imagine World War III</p>
<p>has a very, very severe cyber component</p>
<p>to it with high levels of disruption.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;d be glad of the old shiny stuff at that point.</p>
<p>So diversification still seems like</p>
<p>the most important truth of financial history.</p>
<p>And what is crypto?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just this wonderful new source of diversification,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d be nuts to be 100% in Bitcoin.</p>
<p>I mean, I have some friends</p>
<p>who are probably quite close to that.</p>
<p>Close to 100%, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d mar the balls of steel.</p>
<p>Yeah, in whatever way that balls of steel takes form.</p>
<p>You mentioned smart contracts.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about,</p>
<p>in the context of the history of money,</p>
<p>about Ethereum, about smart contracts,</p>
<p>about kind of more systematic at scale</p>
<p>formalization of agreements between humans?</p>
<p>Well, I think it must be the case</p>
<p>that a lot of the complexity in a mortgage is redundant.</p>
<p>That when we are confronted with pages and pages</p>
<p>and pages and pages of small prints,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing some manifestation</p>
<p>of the late stage regulatory state.</p>
<p>The transaction itself is quite simple.</p>
<p>And most of the verbiage is just ass covering by regulators.</p>
<p>So I think the smart contract,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m sure lawyers will email me</p>
<p>and tell me I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>can deal with a lot of the plain vanilla</p>
<p>and maybe not so plain transactions that we want to do</p>
<p>and eliminate yet more intermediaries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my kind of working assumption.</p>
<p>And given that a lot of financial transactions</p>
<p>have the potential at least to be simplified,</p>
<p>automated, turned into smart contracts,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably where the future goes.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see an obvious reason</p>
<p>why my range of different financial needs,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s think about insurance, for example,</p>
<p>will continue to be met with instruments</p>
<p>that in some ways are 100 years old.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re still at an early stage</p>
<p>of a financial revolution that will greatly streamline</p>
<p>how we take care of all those financial needs that we have,</p>
<p>mortgages and insurance leap to mind.</p>
<p>Most households are penalized</p>
<p>for being financially poorly educated</p>
<p>and confronted with oligopolistic</p>
<p>financial services providers.</p>
<p>So you kind of leave college already in debt.</p>
<p>So you start in debt servitude</p>
<p>and then you got to somehow lever up</p>
<p>to buy a home if you can,</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s kind of telling you you should do that.</p>
<p>So you and your spouse,</p>
<p>you are getting even more leveraged</p>
<p>and your long one asset class called real estate,</p>
<p>which is super illiquid.</p>
<p>I mean, already I&rsquo;m crying inside at the thought</p>
<p>of describing so many households financial predicament</p>
<p>in that way, and I&rsquo;m not done with them yet</p>
<p>because, oh, by the way,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all this insurance you have to take out</p>
<p>and here are the providers that are willing to insure you</p>
<p>and here are the premiums you&rsquo;re gonna be paying,</p>
<p>which are kind of presented to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your car insurance, that&rsquo;s your home insurance.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re here, it&rsquo;s the earthquake insurance.</p>
<p>And pretty soon you&rsquo;re just bleeding money</p>
<p>in a bunch of monthly payments to the mortgage lender,</p>
<p>to the insurer, to all the other people that lent you money.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s look at your balance sheet, it sucks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this great big chunk of real estate</p>
<p>and what else have you really got on there?</p>
<p>And the other side is a bunch of debt,</p>
<p>which is probably paying too high interest.</p>
<p>The typical household in the median kind of range</p>
<p>is at the mercy of oligopolistic</p>
<p>financial services providers.</p>
<p>Go down further in the social scale</p>
<p>and people are outside the financial system altogether.</p>
<p>And those poor folks have to rely on bank notes</p>
<p>and informal lending with huge punitive rates.</p>
<p>We have to do better than this.</p>
<p>This has to be improved upon.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s exciting about our time</p>
<p>is that technology now exists that didn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>when I wrote The Ascent of Money to solve these problems.</p>
<p>When I wrote The Ascent of Money, which was in 2008,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t really solve the problem I&rsquo;ve just described.</p>
<p>Certainly you couldn&rsquo;t solve it</p>
<p>with something like microfinance.</p>
<p>That was obviously not viable.</p>
<p>The interest rates were high,</p>
<p>the transaction costs were crazy, but now we have solutions</p>
<p>and the solutions are extremely exciting.</p>
<p>So FinTech is this great force for good</p>
<p>that brings people into the financial system</p>
<p>and reduces transaction costs.</p>
<p>Crypto is part of it, but it&rsquo;s just part of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much broader story of FinTech going on here</p>
<p>where suddenly you get financial services on your phone,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cost nearly as much as they did</p>
<p>when there had to be a bricks and mortar building</p>
<p>on main street that you kind of went humbly</p>
<p>and beseeched to lend you money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about that</p>
<p>because it seems to me very socially transformative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one other example of what&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>The people who really get sculpted in our financial system</p>
<p>are senders and receivers of remittances,</p>
<p>which are often amongst the poorest families in the world.</p>
<p>The people who are like my wife&rsquo;s family in East Africa</p>
<p>really kind of hand to mouth.</p>
<p>And if you send money to East Africa</p>
<p>or the Philippines or Central America,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the transaction costs are awful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to you, Western Union.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to solve that problem.</p>
<p>So 10 years from now,</p>
<p>the transaction costs will just be negligible</p>
<p>and the money will go to the people who need it</p>
<p>rather than to rent seeking financial institutions.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m on the side of the revolution with this</p>
<p>because I think the incumbent financial institutions globally</p>
<p>are doing a pretty terrible job</p>
<p>and middle class and lower class families lose out.</p>
<p>And thankfully, technologically,</p>
<p>technology allows us to fix this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so FinTech can remove a lot of inefficiencies</p>
<p>in the system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited myself,</p>
<p>maybe as a machine learning person in data oracles.</p>
<p>So converting a lot of our physical world into data</p>
<p>and have smart contracts on top of that.</p>
<p>So that no longer is there&rsquo;s this fuzziness</p>
<p>about what is the concrete nature of the agreements.</p>
<p>You can tie your agreement to weather.</p>
<p>You can tie your agreement to the behavior</p>
<p>of certain kinds of financial systems.</p>
<p>You can tie your behavior to, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I mean, all kinds of things.</p>
<p>You can connect it to the body</p>
<p>in terms of human sensory information.</p>
<p>Like you can make an agreement</p>
<p>that if you don&rsquo;t lose five pounds in the next month,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to pay me $1,000 or something like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stupid example, but it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good example, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>because like you can create all kinds of services</p>
<p>on top of that.</p>
<p>You can just create all kinds of interesting applications</p>
<p>that completely revolutionize how humans transact.</p>
<p>I think, of course, we don&rsquo;t want to create a world</p>
<p>of Chinese style social credit</p>
<p>in which our behavior becomes so transparent</p>
<p>to providers of financial services,</p>
<p>particularly insurers that when I try to go into the pub,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stopped from doing so.</p>
<p>Every time you take a drink, your insurance goes up.</p>
<p>Right, or my credit card wouldn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>in certain restaurants because they serve ribeye steak.</p>
<p>I fear that world because I see it being built in China.</p>
<p>And we must at all costs make sure</p>
<p>that the Western world has something distinctive to offer.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t just be, oh, it&rsquo;s the same as in China.</p>
<p>Only the data go to five tech companies</p>
<p>rather than to Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>So I think that the way we need to steer this world</p>
<p>is in the way that our data are by default</p>
<p>are by default vaulted on our devices</p>
<p>and we choose when to release the data</p>
<p>rather than the default setting</p>
<p>being that the data are available.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important, I think,</p>
<p>because it was one of the biggest mistakes</p>
<p>of the evolution of the internet</p>
<p>that in a way the default was to let our data be plundered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to undo that,</p>
<p>but I think we can at least create a new regime</p>
<p>that in future makes privacy default</p>
<p>rather than open access default.</p>
<p>In the book, Doom, The Politics of Catastrophe,</p>
<p>your newest book, you describe wars, pandemics</p>
<p>and the terrible disasters in human history,</p>
<p>which stands out to you as the worst</p>
<p>in terms of how much it shook the world</p>
<p>and the human spirit.</p>
<p>I am glad I was not around in the mid 14th century</p>
<p>when the bubonic plague swept across Eurasia.</p>
<p>As far as we can see, that was history&rsquo;s worst pandemic.</p>
<p>Maybe there was a comparably bad one</p>
<p>in the reign of the emperor Justinian,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some reason to think it wasn&rsquo;t as bad.</p>
<p>And the more we learn about the 14th century,</p>
<p>the more we realize that it really was across Eurasia</p>
<p>and the mortality was 30% in some places,</p>
<p>50% in some places higher.</p>
<p>There were whole towns that were just emptied.</p>
<p>And when one reads about the Black Death,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an unimaginable nightmare of death</p>
<p>and madness in the death with flagellant orders</p>
<p>wandering from town to town.</p>
<p>Town to town seeking to ward off divine retribution</p>
<p>by flogging themselves,</p>
<p>people turning on the local Jewish communities</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s somehow their fault.</p>
<p>That must have been a nightmarish time.</p>
<p>If you ask me for an also random runner up,</p>
<p>it would be World War II in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And in many ways, it might have been worse</p>
<p>because for a medieval peasant,</p>
<p>the sense of being on the wrong side of divine retribution</p>
<p>must have been overpowering.</p>
<p>In the mid 20th century,</p>
<p>you knew that this was manmade murder</p>
<p>on a massive industrial scale.</p>
<p>If one reads Grossman&rsquo;s Life and Fate,</p>
<p>just to take one example,</p>
<p>one enters a hellscape</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s extremely hard to imagine oneself in.</p>
<p>So these are two of the great disasters of human history.</p>
<p>And if we did have a time machine,</p>
<p>if one really were able to transport people back</p>
<p>and give them a glimpse of these times,</p>
<p>I think the post traumatic stress would be enormous.</p>
<p>People would come back from those trips</p>
<p>even if it was a one day excursion with guaranteed survival</p>
<p>in a state of utter shock.</p>
<p>You often explore counterfactual and hypothetical history,</p>
<p>which is a fascinating thing to do,</p>
<p>sometimes to a controversial degree.</p>
<p>And again, you walk through that fire gracefully.</p>
<p>So let me ask maybe about World War II or in general,</p>
<p>what key moments in history of the 20th century</p>
<p>do you think if something else happened at those moments,</p>
<p>we could have avoided some of the big atrocities,</p>
<p>Stalin&rsquo;s Baltimore, Hitler&rsquo;s Holocaust,</p>
<p>Mao&rsquo;s Great Chinese Famine?</p>
<p>The great turning point in world history</p>
<p>is August the 2nd, 1914,</p>
<p>when the British cabinet decides to intervene</p>
<p>and what would have been a European war</p>
<p>becomes a world war.</p>
<p>And with British intervention,</p>
<p>it becomes a massively larger and more protracted conflict.</p>
<p>So very early in my career,</p>
<p>I became very preoccupied with the deliberations</p>
<p>on that day and the surprising decision</p>
<p>that a liberal cabinet took to go to war,</p>
<p>which you might not have bet on that morning</p>
<p>because there seemed to be a majority of cabinet members</p>
<p>who would be disinclined and only a minority,</p>
<p>including Winston Churchill, who wanted to go to war.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one turning point.</p>
<p>I often wish I could get my time machine working</p>
<p>and go back and say, wait, stop.</p>
<p>Just think about what you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>And by the way, let me show you a video of Europe in 1918.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Can we linger on that one?</p>
<p>That one, a lot of people push back on you</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so difficult.</p>
<p>So the idea is, if I could try to summarize,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the first person that made me think</p>
<p>about this very uncomfortable thought,</p>
<p>which is the ideas in World War I,</p>
<p>it would be a better world if Britain stayed out of the war</p>
<p>and Germany won.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Thinking now in retrospect at the whole story</p>
<p>of the 20th century,</p>
<p>thinking about Stalin&rsquo;s rule of 30 years,</p>
<p>thinking about Hitler&rsquo;s rise to power</p>
<p>and the atrocities of the Holocaust,</p>
<p>but also like you said on the Eastern front,</p>
<p>the death of tens of millions of people through the war</p>
<p>and also sort of the political prisoners</p>
<p>and the suffering connected to communism,</p>
<p>connected to fascism, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s one heck of an example</p>
<p>of why you&rsquo;re just like fearless</p>
<p>in this particular style</p>
<p>of exploring counterfactual history.</p>
<p>So can you elaborate on that idea</p>
<p>and maybe why this was such an important day</p>
<p>in human history?</p>
<p>This argument was central to my book, The Pity of War.</p>
<p>I also did an essay in virtual history about this</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always amused me that from around that time,</p>
<p>I began to be called a conservative historian</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s actually a very left wing argument.</p>
<p>The people in 1914 who thought Britain should stay</p>
<p>at the war were the left of the Labour Party,</p>
<p>who split to become the Independent Labour Party.</p>
<p>What would have happened?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, Britain was not ready for war in 1914.</p>
<p>There had not been conscription.</p>
<p>The army was tiny.</p>
<p>So Britain had failed to deter Germany.</p>
<p>The Germans took the decision</p>
<p>that they could risk going through Belgium</p>
<p>using the Schlieffen Plan to fight their two front war.</p>
<p>They calculated that Britain&rsquo;s intervention</p>
<p>would either not happen or not matter.</p>
<p>If Britain had been strategically committed</p>
<p>to preventing Germany winning a war in Europe,</p>
<p>they should have introduced conscription 10 years before,</p>
<p>had a meaningful land army</p>
<p>and that would have deterred the Germans.</p>
<p>So the Liberal government provided the worst of both worlds,</p>
<p>a commitment that was more or less secret to intervene</p>
<p>that the public didn&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>In fact, much of the Liberal Party didn&rsquo;t know about,</p>
<p>but without really the means</p>
<p>to make that intervention effective,</p>
<p>a tiny army with just a few divisions.</p>
<p>So it was perfectly reasonable to argue</p>
<p>as a number of people did on August the 2nd, 1914,</p>
<p>that Britain should not intervene.</p>
<p>After all, Britain had not immediately intervened</p>
<p>against the French Revolutionary armies back in the 1790s.</p>
<p>It had played an offshore role, ultimately intervening,</p>
<p>but not immediately intervening.</p>
<p>If Britain had stayed out,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that France would have collapsed immediately</p>
<p>as it had in 1870.</p>
<p>The French held up remarkably well</p>
<p>to catastrophic casualties</p>
<p>in the first six months of the First World War.</p>
<p>But by 1916, I don&rsquo;t see how France could have kept going</p>
<p>if Britain had not joined the war.</p>
<p>And I think the war would have been over perhaps</p>
<p>at some point in 1916.</p>
<p>We know that Germany&rsquo;s aims</p>
<p>would have been significantly limited</p>
<p>because they would have needed to keep Britain out.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;d succeeded in keeping Britain out,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d have had to keep Britain out.</p>
<p>And the way to keep Britain out was obviously</p>
<p>not to make any annexation of Belgium,</p>
<p>to limit German war aims,</p>
<p>particularly to limit them to Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And from Britain&rsquo;s point of view, what was not to like?</p>
<p>So the Russian Empire is defeated</p>
<p>along with France.</p>
<p>What does that really change?</p>
<p>If the Germans are sensible</p>
<p>and we can see what this might&rsquo;ve looked like,</p>
<p>they focus on Eastern Europe,</p>
<p>they take chunks of the Russian Empire,</p>
<p>perhaps they create as they did</p>
<p>in the piece of Brest Litovsk,</p>
<p>an independent or quasi independent Poland.</p>
<p>In no way does that pose a threat to the British Empire.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Britain never had had a particularly good relationship</p>
<p>with the Russian Empire after all.</p>
<p>The key point here is that the Germany that emerges</p>
<p>from victory in 1916 has a kind of European union.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the dominant power of an enlarged Germany</p>
<p>with a significant middle Europa,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it,</p>
<p>customs union type arrangement with neighboring countries,</p>
<p>including one suspects, Austria, Hungary.</p>
<p>That is a very different world from the world of 1917, 18.</p>
<p>The protraction of the war for a further two years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s globalization,</p>
<p>which Britain&rsquo;s intervention made inevitable.</p>
<p>As Philip Zelikow showed in his recent book</p>
<p>on the failure to make peace in 1916,</p>
<p>Woodrow Wilson tried and failed to intervene</p>
<p>and broker a peace in 1916.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not the only counterfactualist here.</p>
<p>The extension of the war for a further two years</p>
<p>with escalating slaughter, the death toll rose</p>
<p>because the industrial capacity of the armies grew greater.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what condemns us to the Bolshevik revolution.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what condemns us ultimately to Nazism</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s out of the experience of defeat in 1918</p>
<p>as Hitler makes clear in Mein Kampf</p>
<p>that he becomes radicalized and enters the political realm.</p>
<p>Take out those additional years of war</p>
<p>and Hitler&rsquo;s just a failed artist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the end of the war that turns him into the demagogue.</p>
<p>You asked what are the things</p>
<p>that avoid the totalitarian states.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>British nonintervention for me is the most plausible</p>
<p>and it takes out all of that malignant history</p>
<p>that follows from the Bolshevik revolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for me to see how Lenin gets anywhere</p>
<p>if the war is over.</p>
<p>That looks like the opportunity</p>
<p>for the constitutional elements,</p>
<p>the liberal elements in Russia.</p>
<p>There are other moments at which you can imagine history</p>
<p>taking a different path.</p>
<p>If the provisional government in Russia</p>
<p>had been more ruthless,</p>
<p>it was very lenient towards the Bolsheviks,</p>
<p>but if it had just rounded them up</p>
<p>and shot the Bolshevik leadership,</p>
<p>that would have certainly cut the Bolshevik revolution off.</p>
<p>One looks back on the conduct of the Russian liberals</p>
<p>with the kind of despair at their failure</p>
<p>to see the scale of the threat that they faced</p>
<p>and the ruthlessness that the Bolshevik leadership</p>
<p>would evince. There&rsquo;s a counterfactual in Germany,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>I think the Weimar Republic destroyed itself</p>
<p>in two disastrous economic calamities,</p>
<p>the inflation and then the deflation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult for me to imagine Hitler</p>
<p>getting to be Reich Chancellor</p>
<p>without those huge economic disasters.</p>
<p>So another part of my early work explored</p>
<p>alternative policy options that the German Republic,</p>
<p>the Weimar Republic might have pursued.</p>
<p>There are other contingencies that spring to mind.</p>
<p>In 1936 or 38, I think more plausibly 38,</p>
<p>Britain should have gone to war.</p>
<p>The great mistake was Munich.</p>
<p>Hitler was in an extremely vulnerable position in 1938,</p>
<p>because remember, he didn&rsquo;t have Russia squared away</p>
<p>as he would in 1938.</p>
<p>As he would in 1939.</p>
<p>Chamberlain&rsquo;s mistake was to fold instead of going for war</p>
<p>as Churchill rightly saw.</p>
<p>And there was a magical opportunity there</p>
<p>that would have played into the hands</p>
<p>of the German military opposition and conservatives</p>
<p>to snuff Hitler out over Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>I could go on.</p>
<p>The point is that history is not some inexorable narrative,</p>
<p>which can only end one way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a garden of forking paths.</p>
<p>And many, many junctions in the road,</p>
<p>there were choices that could have averted</p>
<p>the calamities of the mid 20th century.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about this moment,</p>
<p>before you said I could go on,</p>
<p>this moment of Chamberlain and Hitler,</p>
<p>snuff Hitler out in terms of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll return to the book Doom on this point.</p>
<p>What does it take to be a great leader</p>
<p>in the room with Hitler,</p>
<p>or in the same time and space as Hitler,</p>
<p>to snuff him out, to make the right decisions?</p>
<p>So it sounds like you put quite a bit of a blame</p>
<p>on the man, Chamberlain,</p>
<p>and give credit to somebody like a Churchill.</p>
<p>So what is the difference?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s that line?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also written a book about Henry Kissinger,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an interesting sort of person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been throughout many difficult decisions</p>
<p>in the games of power.</p>
<p>So what does it take to be a great leader in that moment?</p>
<p>That particular moment, sorry to keep talking,</p>
<p>is fascinating to me,</p>
<p>because it feels like it&rsquo;s man on man conversations</p>
<p>that define history.</p>
<p>Well, Hitler was bluffing.</p>
<p>He really wasn&rsquo;t ready for war in 1938.</p>
<p>The German economy was clearly not ready for war in 1938.</p>
<p>And Chamberlain made a fundamental miscalculation</p>
<p>along with his advisors,</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t all Chamberlain.</p>
<p>He was in many ways articulating the establishment view.</p>
<p>And I tried to show in a book called War of the World</p>
<p>how that establishment worked.</p>
<p>It extended through the BBC, into the aristocracy,</p>
<p>to Oxford.</p>
<p>There was an establishment view.</p>
<p>Chamberlain personified it.</p>
<p>Churchill was seen as a warmonger.</p>
<p>He was at his lowest point of popularity in 1938.</p>
<p>But what is it that Chamberlain gets wrong?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s conceptual.</p>
<p>Chamberlain is persuaded that Britain has to play for time</p>
<p>because Britain is not ready for war in 1938.</p>
<p>He fails to see that the time that he gets,</p>
<p>that he buys at Munich is also available to Hitler.</p>
<p>Everybody gets the time</p>
<p>and Hitler&rsquo;s able to do much more with it</p>
<p>because Hitler strikes the pact with Stalin</p>
<p>that guarantees that Germany can fight a war</p>
<p>on one front in 1939.</p>
<p>What does Chamberlain do?</p>
<p>Build some more aircraft.</p>
<p>So the great mistake of the strategy of appeasement</p>
<p>was to play for time.</p>
<p>I mean, they knew war was coming,</p>
<p>but they were playing for time,</p>
<p>not realizing that Hitler got the time too.</p>
<p>And after he partitioned Czechoslovakia,</p>
<p>he was in a much stronger position,</p>
<p>not least because of all the resources</p>
<p>that they were able to plunder from Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>So that was the conceptual mistake.</p>
<p>Churchill played an heroic role in pointing out</p>
<p>this mistake and predicting accurately</p>
<p>that it would lead to war on worse terms.</p>
<p>What does it take?</p>
<p>It takes a distinct courage to be unpopular.</p>
<p>And Churchill was deeply unpopular at that point.</p>
<p>People would listen to him in the House of Commons</p>
<p>in silence.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Lady Astor shouted, rubbish.</p>
<p>So he went through a period of being hated on.</p>
<p>The other thing that made Churchill a formidable leader</p>
<p>was that he always applied history to the problem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why he gets it right.</p>
<p>He sees the historical problem</p>
<p>much more clearly than Chamberlain.</p>
<p>So I think if you go back to 1938,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no realistic counterfactual</p>
<p>in which Churchill&rsquo;s in government in 1938.</p>
<p>You have to have France collapse</p>
<p>for Churchill to come into government.</p>
<p>But you can certainly imagine a Tory elite</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s thinking more clearly about the likely dynamics.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t seen this, I guess, problem of conjecture,</p>
<p>to take a phrase from Kissinger,</p>
<p>which is that whatever they&rsquo;re doing in postponing the war</p>
<p>has the potential to create</p>
<p>a worse starting point for the war.</p>
<p>It would have been risky in 1938,</p>
<p>but it was a way better situation</p>
<p>than they ended up with in 1939, a year later.</p>
<p>You asked about Kissinger,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from reading Kissinger</p>
<p>and talking to Kissinger since I embarked</p>
<p>on writing his biography a great many years ago.</p>
<p>So I think one of the most important things I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>is that you can apply history to contemporary problems.</p>
<p>It may be the most important tool that we have</p>
<p>in that kind of decision making.</p>
<p>You have to do it quite ruthlessly and rigorously.</p>
<p>And in the moment of crisis, you have to take risk.</p>
<p>So Kissinger often says in his early work,</p>
<p>the temptation of the bureaucrat is to wait for more data,</p>
<p>but ultimately the decision making</p>
<p>that we do under uncertainty can&rsquo;t be based on data.</p>
<p>The problem of conjecture is</p>
<p>that you could take an action now and incur some cost,</p>
<p>an avert disaster, but you&rsquo;ll get no thanks for it</p>
<p>because nobody is grateful for an averted disaster.</p>
<p>And nobody goes around saying, wasn&rsquo;t it wonderful</p>
<p>how we didn&rsquo;t have another 9 11.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can do nothing,</p>
<p>incur no upfront costs and hope for the best.</p>
<p>And you might get lucky, the disaster might not happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in a democratic system, the much easier path to take.</p>
<p>And I think that the essence of leadership is to be ready</p>
<p>to take that upfront cost, avert the disaster</p>
<p>and accept that you won&rsquo;t get gratitude.</p>
<p>If I may make a comment, an aside about Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>So he, I think at 98 years old currently has still got it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very impressive.</p>
<p>I can only hope that my brain has the same durability</p>
<p>that his does because it&rsquo;s a formidable intellect</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s still in as sharp form as it was 50 years ago.</p>
<p>So you mentioned Eric Schmidt&rsquo;s in his book</p>
<p>and he reached out to me that he wanted to do this podcast.</p>
<p>And I know Eric Schmidt, I&rsquo;ve spoken to him before.</p>
<p>I like him a lot, obviously.</p>
<p>So they said, we could do a podcast for 40 minutes</p>
<p>with Eric, 40 minutes with Eric and Henry together</p>
<p>and 40 minutes with Henry.</p>
<p>So those are three different conversations.</p>
<p>And I had to like, I had to do some soul searching</p>
<p>because I said, fine, 40 minutes with Eric.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll probably talk many times again.</p>
<p>Fine, let&rsquo;s talk about this AI book together</p>
<p>for 40 minutes.</p>
<p>But I said, what I wrote to them is that I would hate myself</p>
<p>if I only have 40 minutes to talk to Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>And so I had to hold my ground, went back and forth</p>
<p>and in the end decided to part ways over this.</p>
<p>And I sometimes think about this kind of difficult decision</p>
<p>in the podcasting space of when do you walk away?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a particular world leader</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve mentioned in the past</p>
<p>where the conversation is very likely to happen.</p>
<p>And as it happens, those conversations could often be,</p>
<p>unfortunately this person only has 30 minutes now.</p>
<p>I know we agreed for three hours, but unfortunately,</p>
<p>and you have to decide, do I stand my ground on this point?</p>
<p>I suppose that&rsquo;s the thing that journalists</p>
<p>have to think about, right?</p>
<p>Like, do I hold onto my integrity</p>
<p>in whatever form that takes?</p>
<p>And do I stay my ground</p>
<p>even if I lose a fascinating opportunity?</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s something I thought about</p>
<p>and something I think about.</p>
<p>And with Henry Kissinger, I mean,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had a million amazing conversations in your biography,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not like something is lost,</p>
<p>but it was still nevertheless to me</p>
<p>some soul searching that I had to do</p>
<p>as a kind of practice for what to me</p>
<p>is a higher stakes conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just mention it as Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>I can have a conversation with him</p>
<p>unlike any conversation he&rsquo;s ever had,</p>
<p>partially because I&rsquo;m a fluent Russian speaker,</p>
<p>partially because I&rsquo;m messed up in the head</p>
<p>in certain kinds of ways that make</p>
<p>for an interesting dynamic,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re both Judo people,</p>
<p>we both are certain kinds of human beings</p>
<p>that can have a much deeper apolitical conversation.</p>
<p>I have to ask to stay on the topic of leadership.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve, in your book, Doom,</p>
<p>have talked about wars, pandemics throughout human history,</p>
<p>and in some sense, saying that all of these disasters</p>
<p>are manmade.</p>
<p>So humans have a role in terms of the magnitude</p>
<p>of the effect that they have on human civilization.</p>
<p>Without taking cheap political shots,</p>
<p>can we talk about COVID 19?</p>
<p>How will history remember the COVID 19 pandemic?</p>
<p>What were the successes,</p>
<p>what were the failures of leadership of man, of humans?</p>
<p>Doom was a book that I was planning to write</p>
<p>before the pandemic struck.</p>
<p>As a history of the future based in large measure</p>
<p>on science fiction.</p>
<p>It had occurred to me in 2019</p>
<p>that I had spent too long not reading science fiction,</p>
<p>and so I decided I would liven up my intake</p>
<p>by getting off history for a bit and reading science fiction.</p>
<p>Because history is great at telling you about the perennial</p>
<p>problems of power.</p>
<p>Putin is always interesting on history.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s become something of a historian recently</p>
<p>with his essays and lectures.</p>
<p>But what history is bad at telling you is,</p>
<p>well, what will the effects of discontinuity</p>
<p>of technology be?</p>
<p>And so I thought I need some science fiction</p>
<p>to think more about this,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m tending to miss the importance</p>
<p>of technological discontinuity.</p>
<p>If you read a lot of science fiction,</p>
<p>you read a lot of plague books,</p>
<p>because science fiction writers are really quite fond</p>
<p>of the plague scenario.</p>
<p>So the world ends in many ways in science fiction,</p>
<p>but one of the most popular is the lethal pandemic.</p>
<p>So when the first email came to me,</p>
<p>I think it was on January the 3rd</p>
<p>from my medical friend, Justin Stebbing,</p>
<p>funny pneumonia in Wuhan, my antennae began to tingle</p>
<p>because it was just like one of those science fiction books</p>
<p>that begins in just that moment.</p>
<p>It begins in just that way.</p>
<p>In a pandemic, as Larry Brilliant,</p>
<p>the epidemiologist said many years ago,</p>
<p>the key is early detection and early action.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you deal with a novel pathogen.</p>
<p>And almost no Western country did that.</p>
<p>We know it was doable because the Taiwanese</p>
<p>and the South Koreans did it, and they did it very well.</p>
<p>But really no Western country got this right.</p>
<p>Some were unlucky because super spreader events</p>
<p>happened earlier than in other countries.</p>
<p>Italy was hit very hard very early.</p>
<p>For other countries, the real disaster came quite late.</p>
<p>Russia, which has only relatively recently</p>
<p>had a really bad experience.</p>
<p>The lesson for me is quite different from the one</p>
<p>that most journalists thought they were learning last year.</p>
<p>Most journalists last year thought,</p>
<p>Trump is a terrible president.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying a lot of crazy things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his fault that we have high excess mortality</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>The same argument was being made by journalists in Britain,</p>
<p>Boris Johnson, dot, dot, dot,</p>
<p>Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, dot, dot, dot,</p>
<p>even India, Narendra Modi, the same argument.</p>
<p>And I think this argument is wrong in a few ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that the populist leaders said many crazy things,</p>
<p>and broadly speaking gave poor guidance</p>
<p>to their populations.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s true to say</p>
<p>that with different leaders,</p>
<p>these countries would have done significantly better</p>
<p>if Joe Biden had magically been president a year earlier.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the US would have done much better</p>
<p>because the things that caused excess mortality last year</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t presidential decisions.</p>
<p>They were utter failure of CDC to provide testing.</p>
<p>That definitely wasn&rsquo;t Trump&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>Scott Gottlieb&rsquo;s book makes that very clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just been published recently.</p>
<p>We utterly failed to use technology for contact tracing,</p>
<p>which the Koreans did very well.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really quarantine anybody seriously.</p>
<p>There was no enforcement of quarantine.</p>
<p>And we exposed the elderly to the virus</p>
<p>as quickly as possible in elderly care homes.</p>
<p>And these things had very little to do</p>
<p>with presidential incompetence.</p>
<p>So I think leadership is of somewhat marginal importance</p>
<p>in a crisis like this,</p>
<p>because what you really need</p>
<p>is your public health bureaucracy to get it right.</p>
<p>And very few Western public health bureaucracies</p>
<p>got it right.</p>
<p>Could the president have given better leadership?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>His correct strategy, however,</p>
<p>was to learn from Barack Obama&rsquo;s playbook</p>
<p>with the opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>The opioid epidemic killed as many people</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s watch as COVID did on Trump&rsquo;s watch.</p>
<p>And it was worse in a sense</p>
<p>because it only happened in the US.</p>
<p>And each year it killed more people</p>
<p>than the year before, over eight years.</p>
<p>Nobody to my knowledge has ever seriously blamed Obama</p>
<p>for the opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s mistake was to put himself front and center</p>
<p>of the response to claim that he had some unique insight</p>
<p>into the pandemic and to say with every passing week,</p>
<p>more and more foolish things</p>
<p>until even a significant portion of people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d voted for him in 2016 realized that he&rsquo;d blown it,</p>
<p>which was why he lost the election.</p>
<p>The correct strategy was actually to make Mike Pence</p>
<p>the pandemic czar and get the hell out of the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my advice to Trump would have been.</p>
<p>In fact, it was in February of last year.</p>
<p>So the mistake was to try to lead,</p>
<p>but actually leadership in a pandemic</p>
<p>is almost a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>What you really need is your public health bureaucracy</p>
<p>not to fuck it up.</p>
<p>And they really, really fucked it up.</p>
<p>And that was then all blamed on Trump.</p>
<p>Jim Fallows writes a piece in the Atlantic that says,</p>
<p>well, being the president&rsquo;s like flying a light aircraft,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pilot error.</p>
<p>And I read that piece and I thought,</p>
<p>does he really after all the years he spent writing</p>
<p>think that being president is like flying a light aircraft?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really nothing like flying a light aircraft.</p>
<p>Being president is you sit on top of a vast bureaucracy</p>
<p>with how many different agencies, 60, 70,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all lost count.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re surrounded by advisors,</p>
<p>at least a quarter of whom are saying, this is a disaster.</p>
<p>We have to close the borders.</p>
<p>And the others are saying, no, no,</p>
<p>we have to keep the economy going.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re running on in November.</p>
<p>So being a president in a pandemic</p>
<p>is a very unenviable position</p>
<p>because you actually can&rsquo;t really determine</p>
<p>whether your public health bureaucracy</p>
<p>will get it right or not.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think to push back on that,</p>
<p>just like being Churchill in a war is difficult.</p>
<p>So leaving Trump by an aside,</p>
<p>what I would love to see from a president</p>
<p>is somebody who makes great speeches</p>
<p>and arouses the public to push the bureaucracy,</p>
<p>the public health bureaucracy,</p>
<p>to get their shit together,</p>
<p>to fire certain kinds of people.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m a big fan of powerful speeches,</p>
<p>especially in the modern age with the internet.</p>
<p>It can really move people.</p>
<p>Instead, the lack of speeches</p>
<p>resulted in certain kinds of forces</p>
<p>amplifying division over whether to wear masks or not,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s almost like the public picked some random topic</p>
<p>over which to divide themselves.</p>
<p>And there was like a complete indecision,</p>
<p>which is really what it was,</p>
<p>fear of uncertainty materializing itself</p>
<p>in some kind of division.</p>
<p>And then you almost like busy yourself</p>
<p>with the red versus blue politics,</p>
<p>as opposed to some, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>FDR type character just stands and say,</p>
<p>fuck all this bullshit that we&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to manufacture 5 billion tests.</p>
<p>This is what America is great at.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to build</p>
<p>the greatest testing infrastructure ever built,</p>
<p>or something, or even with the vaccine development.</p>
<p>But that was what I was about to interject.</p>
<p>In a pandemic, the most important thing is the vaccine.</p>
<p>If you get that right,</p>
<p>then you should be forgiven for much else.</p>
<p>And that was the one thing</p>
<p>the Trump administration got right,</p>
<p>because they went around the bureaucracy</p>
<p>with Operation Warp Speed</p>
<p>and achieved a really major success.</p>
<p>So I think the paradox of the 2020 story</p>
<p>in the United States is that the one thing that mattered most</p>
<p>the Trump administration got right,</p>
<p>and it got so much else wrong</p>
<p>that was sort of marginal,</p>
<p>that we were left with the impression</p>
<p>that Trump had been to blame for the whole disaster,</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t really quite right.</p>
<p>Sure, it would have been great</p>
<p>if we did Operation Warp Speed for testing,</p>
<p>but ultimately vaccines are more important than tests.</p>
<p>And this brings me to the question</p>
<p>that you raised there of polarization and why that happened.</p>
<p>Now, in a book called The Square and the Tower,</p>
<p>I argued that it would be very costly for the United States</p>
<p>to allow the public sphere to continue to be dominated</p>
<p>by a handful of big tech companies,</p>
<p>that this ultimately would have more adverse effects</p>
<p>than simply contested elections.</p>
<p>And I think we saw over the past 18 months</p>
<p>just how bad this could be,</p>
<p>because the odd thing about this country</p>
<p>is that we came up with vaccines with 90 plus percent efficacy</p>
<p>and about 20% of people refused to get them</p>
<p>and still do refuse for reasons that seem best explained</p>
<p>in terms of the anti vaccine network,</p>
<p>which has been embedded on the internet for a long time,</p>
<p>predating the pandemic.</p>
<p>Renny DiResta wrote about this pre 2020.</p>
<p>And this anti vaccine network has turned out</p>
<p>to kill maybe 200,000 Americans</p>
<p>who could have been vaccinated,</p>
<p>but were persuaded through magical thinking</p>
<p>that the vaccine was riskier than the virus.</p>
<p>Whereas you don&rsquo;t need to be an epidemiologist,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to be a medical scientist</p>
<p>to know that the virus is about two orders</p>
<p>of magnitude riskier than the vaccine.</p>
<p>So again, leadership could definitely have been better.</p>
<p>But the politicization of everything</p>
<p>was not Trump&rsquo;s doing alone.</p>
<p>It happened because our public sphere has been dominated</p>
<p>by a handful of platforms whose business model</p>
<p>inherently promotes polarization,</p>
<p>inherently promotes fake news and extreme views,</p>
<p>because those are the things that get the eyeballs</p>
<p>on the screens and sell the ads.</p>
<p>I mean, this is now a commonplace.</p>
<p>But when one thinks about the cost</p>
<p>of allowing this kind of thing to happen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now a very high human cost.</p>
<p>And we were foolish to leave uncorrected</p>
<p>these structural problems in the public sphere</p>
<p>that were already very clearly visible in 2016.</p>
<p>And you described that, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s these networks that are almost like</p>
<p>laying dormant, waiting for their time in the sun,</p>
<p>and they stepped forward in this case.</p>
<p>And that those network effects just disservice catalyst</p>
<p>for whatever the bad parts of human nature.</p>
<p>I do hope that there&rsquo;s kinds of networks</p>
<p>that emphasize the better angels of our nature,</p>
<p>to quote Steven Pinker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just clearly, and we know this</p>
<p>from all the revelations of the Facebook whistleblower,</p>
<p>there is clearly a very clear tension</p>
<p>between the business model of a company like Facebook</p>
<p>and the public good, and they know that.</p>
<p>I just talked to the founder of Instagram.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the case, but it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>from a technology perspective,</p>
<p>absolutely true of any kind of social network.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible to build,</p>
<p>actually I think it&rsquo;s not just possible,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty easy if you set that as the goal,</p>
<p>to build social networks</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have these negative effects.</p>
<p>Right, but if the business model is we sell ads,</p>
<p>and the way you sell ads is to maximize user engagement,</p>
<p>then the algorithm is biased</p>
<p>in favor of fake news and extreme views.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the ads, a lot of people blame the ads.</p>
<p>The problem I think is the engagement,</p>
<p>and the engagement is just the easiest,</p>
<p>the dumbest way to sell the ads.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s much different metrics</p>
<p>that could be used to make a lot more money</p>
<p>than the engagement in the long term.</p>
<p>It has more to do with planning for the long term,</p>
<p>so optimizing the selling of ads</p>
<p>to make people happy with themselves in the long term,</p>
<p>as opposed to some kind of addicted like dopamine feeling.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, to me that has to do with metrics</p>
<p>and measuring things correctly</p>
<p>and sort of also creating a culture</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s valued to have difficult conversations</p>
<p>about what we&rsquo;re doing with society,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And I think once you have those conversations,</p>
<p>this takes us back to the University of Austin,</p>
<p>kind of once you have those difficult human conversations,</p>
<p>you can design the technology that will actually make</p>
<p>for help people grow,</p>
<p>become the best version of themselves,</p>
<p>help them be happy in the long term.</p>
<p>What gives you hope about the future?</p>
<p>As somebody who studied some of the darker moments</p>
<p>of human history, what gives you hope?</p>
<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>First of all, the United States</p>
<p>has a very unique operating system.</p>
<p>Which was very well designed by the founders</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d thought a lot about history</p>
<p>and realized it would take quite a novel design</p>
<p>to prevent the republic going the way of all republics</p>
<p>because republics tend to end up as tyrannies</p>
<p>for reasons that were well established</p>
<p>by the time of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>And it gives me hope that this design has worked very well</p>
<p>and withstood an enormous stress test in the last year.</p>
<p>I became an American in 2018, I think one of the most</p>
<p>important features of this operating system</p>
<p>is that it is the magnet for talent.</p>
<p>Here we sit, part of the immigration story</p>
<p>in a darkened room with funny accents.</p>
<p>A Scot and a Russian walk into a recording studio</p>
<p>and talk about America, it&rsquo;s very much like a joke.</p>
<p>And Elon&rsquo;s a South African and so on,</p>
<p>and Teal is a German.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re extraordinarily fortunate</p>
<p>that the natives let us come and play</p>
<p>and play in a way that we could not</p>
<p>in our countries of birth.</p>
<p>And as long as the United States continues</p>
<p>to exploit that superpower, that it is the talent magnet,</p>
<p>then it should out innovate</p>
<p>the totalitarian competition every time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one reason for being an optimist.</p>
<p>Another reason, and it&rsquo;s quite a historical reason</p>
<p>as you would expect from me.</p>
<p>Another reason that I&rsquo;m optimistic</p>
<p>is that my kids give me a great deal of hope.</p>
<p>They range in age from 27 down to four,</p>
<p>but each of them in their different way</p>
<p>seems to be finding a way through this crazy time of ours</p>
<p>without losing contact with that culture</p>
<p>and civilization that I hold dear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to live in the metaverse</p>
<p>as Mark Zuckerberg imagines it.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s a kind of ghastly hell.</p>
<p>I think Western civilization is the best civilization.</p>
<p>And I think that almost all the truths</p>
<p>about the human condition can be found</p>
<p>in Western literature, art, and music.</p>
<p>And I think also that the civilization</p>
<p>that produced the scientific revolution</p>
<p>has produced the great problem solving tool</p>
<p>that eluded the other civilizations</p>
<p>that never really cracked science.</p>
<p>And what gives me hope is that</p>
<p>despite all the temptations and distractions</p>
<p>that their generation had to contend with,</p>
<p>my children in their different ways</p>
<p>have found their way to literature</p>
<p>and to art and to music, and they are civilized.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t claim much of the credit for that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done my best,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s deeply encouraging</p>
<p>that they found their way to the things</p>
<p>that I think are indispensable for a happy life,</p>
<p>a fulfilled life.</p>
<p>Nobody, I think, can be truly fulfilled</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re cut off from the great body</p>
<p>of Western literature, for example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about Elon&rsquo;s argument</p>
<p>that we might be in a simulation.</p>
<p>No, no, there is a simulation, it&rsquo;s called literature.</p>
<p>And we just have to decide whether or not to enter it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently in the midst of the later stages</p>
<p>of Proust&rsquo;s great A l¬¥heure √©chec du temps perdu,</p>
<p>and Proust&rsquo;s observation of human relationships</p>
<p>is perhaps more meticulous than that of any other writer.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s impossible not to find yourself identifying</p>
<p>with Marcel and his obsessive, jealous relationships,</p>
<p>particularly with Albertine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the simulation.</p>
<p>And you decide, I think, as a sentient being,</p>
<p>how far to, in your own life,</p>
<p>reenact these more profound experiences</p>
<p>that others have written down.</p>
<p>One of my earliest literary simulations</p>
<p>was to reenact Jack Kerouac&rsquo;s Trippin on the Road</p>
<p>when I was 17, culminating in getting very wasted</p>
<p>in the Hanging Gardens of Xochimilco, not to be missed.</p>
<p>And it hit me, just as I was reading Proust,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s really how to live a rich life,</p>
<p>that one lives life, but one lives it</p>
<p>juxtaposing one&rsquo;s own experience</p>
<p>against the more refined experiences of the great writers.</p>
<p>So it gives me hope that my children do that a bit.</p>
<p>Do you include the Russian authors in the canon?</p>
<p>Yes, I don&rsquo;t read Russian,</p>
<p>but I was entirely obsessed</p>
<p>with Russian literature as a schoolboy.</p>
<p>I read my way through Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev,</p>
<p>I, Chekhov.</p>
<p>I think of all of those writers,</p>
<p>Tolstoy had the biggest impact</p>
<p>because at the end of War and Peace,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this great essay on historical determinism,</p>
<p>which I think was the reason I became a historian.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m really temperamentally a kind of Turgenev person,</p>
<p>oddly enough.</p>
<p>I think if you haven&rsquo;t read those novelists,</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t really be a complete human being</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t read the Brothers Karamazov.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not really, you&rsquo;re not grown up.</p>
<p>And so I think in many ways,</p>
<p>those are the greatest novels.</p>
<p>Raskolnikov, remember Raskolnikov&rsquo;s Nightmare</p>
<p>at the end of Crime and Punishment,</p>
<p>in which he imagines in his dream</p>
<p>a world in which a terrible virus spreads.</p>
<p>Do you remember this?</p>
<p>And this virus has the effect of making every individual</p>
<p>think that what he believes is right.</p>
<p>And in this self righteousness,</p>
<p>people fall on one another and commit appalling violence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Raskolnikov&rsquo;s Nightmare, and it&rsquo;s a prophecy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible prophecy of Russia&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Yeah, and coupled with that is probably the,</p>
<p>I also like the French, the existentialists, all that.</p>
<p>The full spectrum and German&rsquo;s Hermann Hesse</p>
<p>and just that range of human thought</p>
<p>as expressed in the literature is fascinating.</p>
<p>I really love your idea that the simulation,</p>
<p>like one way to live life</p>
<p>is to kind of explore these other worlds</p>
<p>and borrow from them wisdom</p>
<p>that you then just map onto your own lives.</p>
<p>You almost like stitch together your life</p>
<p>with these kind of pieces from literature.</p>
<p>The highly educated person is constantly struck by illusion.</p>
<p>Everything is an illusion to something that one has read.</p>
<p>And that is the simulation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the real metaverse is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the imaginary world that we enter when we read,</p>
<p>empathize, and then recognize in our daily lives</p>
<p>some scrap of the shared experience</p>
<p>that literature gives us.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ve aspired to be the idiot</p>
<p>from Prince Mishkin from Dostoevsky</p>
<p>and in aspiring to be that,</p>
<p>I have become the idiot, I feel, at least in part.</p>
<p>What, you mentioned the human condition,</p>
<p>does love have to do?</p>
<p>What role does it play in the human condition?</p>
<p>Friendship, love.</p>
<p>Love is the drug.</p>
<p>Love is, this was the great Roxy music line</p>
<p>that Brian Ferry wrote.</p>
<p>And love is the most powerful</p>
<p>and dangerous of all the drugs.</p>
<p>The driving force that overrides our reason.</p>
<p>And of course, it is the primal urge.</p>
<p>So what a civilized society has to do</p>
<p>is to prevent that drug, that primal force</p>
<p>from creating mayhem.</p>
<p>So there have to be rules like monogamy</p>
<p>and rituals like marriage that reign love in.</p>
<p>And make the addicts at least more or less under control.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s part of why I&rsquo;m a romantic</p>
<p>rather than a Steve Pinker, enlightenment rationalist.</p>
<p>Because the romantics realized that love was the drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>the difference in sensibility between Handel and Wagner.</p>
<p>And I had a Wagnerian phase when I was an undergraduate.</p>
<p>And I still remember thinking that in,</p>
<p>as old as Lieberstod,</p>
<p>that Wagner had got the closest to sex</p>
<p>that anybody had ever got in music,</p>
<p>or perhaps to love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky that I love my wife and that we were,</p>
<p>by the time we met, you know, smart enough to understand</p>
<p>that love is a drug that you have to kind of take</p>
<p>in certain careful ways.</p>
<p>And that it works best in the context of a stable relationship</p>
<p>it works best in the context of a stable family.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the key thing.</p>
<p>That one has to sort of take the drug</p>
<p>and then submit to the conventions</p>
<p>of marriage and family life.</p>
<p>I think in that respect, I&rsquo;m a kind of tamed romantic.</p>
<p>Tamed romantic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d like to think of myself.</p>
<p>The degree to which your romanticism is tamed</p>
<p>can be then channeled into productive work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you are a historian and a writer</p>
<p>is the best that love is channeled through the writing.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to be addicted to anything,</p>
<p>be addicted to work.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re all addictive,</p>
<p>but the thing about workaholism</p>
<p>is that it is the most productive addiction.</p>
<p>And rather that than drugs or booze.</p>
<p>So yes, I&rsquo;m always trying to channel my anxieties</p>
<p>into work.</p>
<p>I learned that at a relatively early age,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sort of massively productive way</p>
<p>of coping with the inner demons.</p>
<p>And again, we should teach kids that</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s come back to our earlier conversation</p>
<p>about universities.</p>
<p>Part of what happens at university</p>
<p>is that adolescents have to overcome all the inner demons.</p>
<p>And these include deep insecurity</p>
<p>about one&rsquo;s appearance, about one&rsquo;s intellect,</p>
<p>and then madly raging hormones</p>
<p>that cause you to behave like a complete fool</p>
<p>with the people to whom you&rsquo;re sexually attracted.</p>
<p>All of this is going on in the university.</p>
<p>How can it be a safe space?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely dangerous space by definition.</p>
<p>So yeah, I learned teaching young people</p>
<p>how to manage these storms,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of the job.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re really not allowed to do that anymore</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t talk about these things</p>
<p>for fear of the Title IX officers kicking down the door</p>
<p>and dragging us off in chains.</p>
<p>And like you said, hard work</p>
<p>and something you call work ethic in civilization</p>
<p>is a pretty effective way to achieve, I think,</p>
<p>a kind of happiness in a world that&rsquo;s full of anxiety.</p>
<p>Or at least exhaustion so that you sleep well.</p>
<p>Well, there is beauty to the exhaustion too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why running, there&rsquo;s manual work</p>
<p>that some part of us is built for that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, we are products of evolution</p>
<p>and our adaptation to a technological world</p>
<p>is a very imperfect one.</p>
<p>So hence the kind of masochistic urge to run.</p>
<p>I like outdoor exercise.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like gyms.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll go for long punishing runs in woodland,</p>
<p>hike up hills.</p>
<p>I like swimming in lakes and in the sea</p>
<p>because there just has to be that physical activity</p>
<p>in order to do the good mental work.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s all about trying to do the best work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my sense that we have</p>
<p>some random allocation of talent.</p>
<p>You kind of figure out what it is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re relatively good at</p>
<p>and you try to do that well.</p>
<p>I think my father encouraged me to think that way.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t mind about being average at the other stuff.</p>
<p>The kind of sick thing</p>
<p>is to try to be brilliant at everything.</p>
<p>I hate those people.</p>
<p>Should really not worry too much</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just an average double bass player, which I am,</p>
<p>or kind of average skier, which I definitely am.</p>
<p>Doing those things okay</p>
<p>is part of leading a rich and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>I was not a good actor,</p>
<p>but I got a lot out of acting as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>Turned out after three years of experimentation at Oxford</p>
<p>that I was, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>better at writing history essays than my peers.</p>
<p>And that was my edge.</p>
<p>That was my comparative advantage.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve just tried to make a living</p>
<p>from that slight edge.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to describe a life.</p>
<p>Is there a meaning to this thing?</p>
<p>Is there a meaning to life?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I was brought up by a physicist and a physician.</p>
<p>They were more or less committed atheists</p>
<p>who had left the Church of Scotland</p>
<p>as a protest against sectarianism in Glasgow.</p>
<p>And so my sister and I were told from an early age</p>
<p>life was a cosmic accident, and that was it.</p>
<p>There was no great meaning to it, and I can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>get past that.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there beauty to being an accident at a cosmic scale?</p>
<p>Yes, I wasn&rsquo;t taught to feel negative about that.</p>
<p>And if anything, it was a frivolous insight</p>
<p>that the whole thing was a kind of joke.</p>
<p>And I think that atheism isn&rsquo;t really a basis</p>
<p>for ordering a society, but it&rsquo;s been all right for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a kind of sense of a missing religious faith.</p>
<p>For me, however, there&rsquo;s clearly some embedded</p>
<p>Christian ethics in the way my parents lived.</p>
<p>And so we were kind of atheist Calvinists</p>
<p>who had kind of deposed God, but carried on behaving</p>
<p>as if we were members of the elect in a moral universe.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the state of mind that I was left in.</p>
<p>And I think that we aren&rsquo;t really around long enough</p>
<p>to claim that our individual lives have meaning.</p>
<p>But what Edmund Burke said is true.</p>
<p>The real social contract is between the generations,</p>
<p>between the dead, the living, and the unborn.</p>
<p>And the meaning of life is, for me at least,</p>
<p>to live in a way that honors the dead,</p>
<p>seeks to learn from their accumulated wisdom</p>
<p>because they do still outnumber us.</p>
<p>They outnumber the living by quite a significant margin.</p>
<p>And then to be mindful of the unborn</p>
<p>and our responsibility to them.</p>
<p>Writing books is a way of communicating with the unborn.</p>
<p>It may or may not succeed, and probably won&rsquo;t succeed</p>
<p>if my books are never assigned</p>
<p>by work professors in the future.</p>
<p>So what we have to do is more than just write books</p>
<p>and record podcasts, there have to be institutions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 57 now.</p>
<p>I realized recently that succession planning</p>
<p>had to be the main focus of the next 20 years</p>
<p>because there are things that I really care about</p>
<p>that I want future generations to have access to.</p>
<p>And so the meaning of life I do regard</p>
<p>as being intergenerational transfer of wisdom.</p>
<p>Ultimately the species will go extinct at some point.</p>
<p>Even if we do colonize Mars, one senses</p>
<p>that physics will catch up with this particular organism,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in the pretty far distant future.</p>
<p>And so the meaning of life is to make sure</p>
<p>that for as long as there are human beings,</p>
<p>they are able to live the kind of fulfilled lives,</p>
<p>ethically fulfilled, intellectually fulfilled,</p>
<p>emotionally fulfilled lives</p>
<p>that civilization has made possible.</p>
<p>It would be easy for us to revert to the uncivilized world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fantastic book that I&rsquo;m going to misremember.</p>
<p>Milosz is the captive soul, the captive mind rather,</p>
<p>which has a fantastic passage.</p>
<p>He was a Polish intellectual who says,</p>
<p>Americans can never imagine what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>for civilization to be completely destroyed</p>
<p>as it was in Poland by the end of World War II,</p>
<p>to have no rule of law, to have no security of even person,</p>
<p>nevermind property rights.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t imagine what that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>and what it will lead you to do.</p>
<p>So one reason for teaching history</p>
<p>is to remind the lucky Generation Z members</p>
<p>of California that civilization is a thin film.</p>
<p>And it can be destroyed remarkably easily.</p>
<p>And to preserve civilization</p>
<p>is a tremendous responsibility that we have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge responsibility.</p>
<p>And we must not destroy ourselves,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in the name of wokeism</p>
<p>or the pursuit of the metaverse.</p>
<p>Preserving civilization and making it available,</p>
<p>not just to our kids, but to people we&rsquo;ll never know,</p>
<p>generations ahead, that&rsquo;s the meaning.</p>
<p>And do so by studying the lessons of history.</p>
<p>Right, not only studying them, but then acting on them.</p>
<p>For me, the biggest problem is,</p>
<p>how do we apply history more effectively?</p>
<p>It seems as if our institutions, including government,</p>
<p>are very, very bad at applying history.</p>
<p>Lessons of history are learned poorly, if at all.</p>
<p>Analogies are drawn crudely.</p>
<p>Often the wrong inferences are drawn.</p>
<p>One of the big intellectual challenges for me</p>
<p>is how to make history more useful.</p>
<p>And this was the kind of thing that professors used to hate,</p>
<p>but really practically useful,</p>
<p>so that policymakers and citizens</p>
<p>can think about the decisions that they face</p>
<p>with a more historically informed body of knowledge.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a pandemic, the challenge of climate change,</p>
<p>what to do about Taiwan.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a better set of things to know</p>
<p>before you make decisions about those things</p>
<p>than the things that history has to offer.</p>
<p>Well, I love the discipline of applied history,</p>
<p>basically going to history and saying,</p>
<p>what are the key principles here</p>
<p>that are applicable to the problems of today?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And how can we solve that?</p>
<p>The great philosopher of history, R.G. Collingwood,</p>
<p>said in his autobiography, which was published in 1939,</p>
<p>that the purpose of history was to reconstitute</p>
<p>past thought from whatever surviving remnants there were,</p>
<p>and then to juxtapose it with our own predicament.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that juxtaposition of past experience</p>
<p>with present experience that is so important.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do that well.</p>
<p>And indeed, we&rsquo;ve flipped it</p>
<p>so that academic historians now think their mission</p>
<p>is to travel back to the past with the value system of 2021</p>
<p>and castigate the dead for their racism and sexism</p>
<p>and transphobia and whatnot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly wrong.</p>
<p>Our mission is to go back and try to understand</p>
<p>what it was like to live in the 18th century,</p>
<p>not to go back and condescend to the people of the past.</p>
<p>And once we&rsquo;ve had a better understanding,</p>
<p>once we&rsquo;ve seen into their lives, read their words,</p>
<p>tried to reconstitute their experience,</p>
<p>to come back and understand our own time better,</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we should really be doing.</p>
<p>But academic history has gone completely haywire,</p>
<p>and it does almost the exact opposite</p>
<p>of what I think it should do.</p>
<p>And by studying history, walk beautifully, gracefully</p>
<p>through this simulation, as you described,</p>
<p>by mapping the lessons of history into the world of today.</p>
<p>We have virtual reality already in our heads.</p>
<p>We do not need Oculus and the metaverse.</p>
<p>This was an incredible, hopeful conversation</p>
<p>in many ways that I did not expect.</p>
<p>I thought our conversation would be much more</p>
<p>about history than about the future,</p>
<p>and it turned out to be the opposite.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor to finally meet you, to talk to you.</p>
<p>Thank you for your valuable time.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex, and good luck with Putin.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Neil Ferguson.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Neil Ferguson himself.</p>
<p>No civilization, no matter how mighty it may appear</p>
<p>to itself, is indestructible.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
