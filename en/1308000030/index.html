    <p>Any word from the dictator or should we just do a I don&rsquo;t know man. I got it</p>
<p>I I cannot spend my whole day sitting on zoom waiting for chamath</p>
<p>Or I could have brad gerson or come on and sitting for isn&rsquo;t he richer than chamath?</p>
<p>He is now the largest spack in the world. Should we do that? Should I just have brad come on the pod?</p>
<p>Oh my god. Yes</p>
<p>Started now get him on started</p>
<p>Come on comes in later. He&rsquo;s like what the fuck we&rsquo;re like we replaced you with the new spack king</p>
<p>Oh my god, oh my god, get him on is this like, uh a kidnapping and you guys are gonna take me out and drop me</p>
<p>out behind uh</p>
<p>Behind the railroad cars what&rsquo;s going on here? Okay, good. Here we go. I&rsquo;m good. Is it how&rsquo;s the game?</p>
<p>Gain is great. Good</p>
<p>Jane</p>
<p>Has gone crazy</p>
<p>Hey everybody, hey everybody, it&rsquo;s another episode of the all-in podcast</p>
<p>We took last week off because it was spring break and we all needed a break</p>
<p>Hope you had a great one too with us today. Of course</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa from an undisclosed sunny location david friedberg. It looks like redwood city</p>
<p>Is it redwood city a rain man himself?</p>
<p>David sax ready for governor sax.com. And of course the king of all spax brad gerstner is with us again the new dictator</p>
<p>Uh filling in for chamath. Polly hapatea the dictator. Oh wait chamath</p>
<p>The dictator is here as well</p>
<p>and special bestie jason</p>
<p>jason jason</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not when you</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that means, but we&rsquo;re editing that out of the show</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bunch of beeps, uh, but welcome brad sitting in uh, just for a moment here because chamath was gonna</p>
<p>Blow it off. Yeah</p>
<p>He was a no-show. We needed a spat king. Sorry guys backing. I apologize</p>
<p>Emergency, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just a little flattery for chamath. The truth of the matter is chamath. Uh chamath is pioneering here</p>
<p>and uh, you know, I think um,</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been incredible to watch the competition and choice and as chamath knows I participated in a couple of the deals that he&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>um, and I think we all share the same feeling which is, you know, there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>uh, a system that is pretty byzantine</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t serving the founders who we all</p>
<p>Uh, you know care deeply about and so i&rsquo;m just i&rsquo;m thrilled whether it&rsquo;s direct list</p>
<p>like roblox did a few weeks ago that we we helped do and</p>
<p>You know or whether it&rsquo;s chamath and the incredible innovation that he&rsquo;s helping to do or you know, we&rsquo;re lucky</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been we&rsquo;ve invested in you know, building a capital markets business on top of this</p>
<p>uh this back and and and then</p>
<p>You know worked with uh grab to bring a great public company out this week</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get to the direct listing. Uh good segue</p>
<p>Clearly the biggest news of the week is coinbase the largest direct listing ever</p>
<p>Uh bill gurley somewhere is smiling</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s on top of roblox, which I think was the second biggest</p>
<p>Uh 2020 revenue 1.2 billion. Sorry brad did did snowflake direct list or that was a traditional?</p>
<p>No, that was traditional idea traditional idea. I don&rsquo;t know who got their bet week. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Wet their beaks on this one sax. Did you have a little bit?</p>
<p>I had a little tasty poo little tasty poo. I had uh, I had a lot</p>
<p>showered upon me</p>
<p>Uh explain boys because you&rsquo;re because you&rsquo;re in ribbit, right?</p>
<p>I am I was mickey&rsquo;s one of mickey&rsquo;s largest lps. Yeah</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s making for the audience who doesn&rsquo;t know mickey malka who runs a ribbit capital who owns seven percent?</p>
<p>Or ten percent or seven or eight percent of coinbase and what was incredible was I got distributed all of it yesterday</p>
<p>Which by the way, I think for a direct listing the strategy to me makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>I made a mistake in hindsight if I think about my distribution strategy because myself excel and andreason</p>
<p>When we did the slack direct listing we distributed probably five ten percent and then we waited and then we trickled it out over time</p>
<p>But by definition, I think the price action on direct listings shows you that you top tick the top price</p>
<p>At and the moment on the open print and so, you know if you&rsquo;re going to sell</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably better off selling absolutely right away</p>
<p>And if you look at the price action on direct listings, it&rsquo;s basically been one way direction down from the point of the direct listing</p>
<p>Spotify did that for two years. It kind of languished, you know slack did that until the salesforce acquisition?</p>
<p>Um, so in general, I think if if a direct listing happens when you get distributed the stock you should probably sell it right away</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p>Uh means it was priced correctly as opposed to underpriced. Is that what we should take from that?</p>
<p>Well, no because there&rsquo;s no price. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s well</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s tbd is what is the morale hit to the company to see a one-way?</p>
<p>Direction down in you know a stairway down on the stock price. So maybe it was good for selling shareholders</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily good for the morale of employees which then could impact</p>
<p>The long-term enterprise value that&rsquo;s being built at a company. So I think there&rsquo;s a bunch of tbds</p>
<p>I do think that direct listings are administratively clean in some ways</p>
<p>But company building may not necessarily win but you had a point of view</p>
<p>I think it was last year or two years ago about how</p>
<p>You know and I read some papers that one of the analysts at wall street put out showing that um</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much of a benefit to lockups with respect to short or long-term price volatility</p>
<p>Do you still hold that point of view?</p>
<p>like I think lockups are I think lockups are really unfair because they</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re attacks on the people that have been there the longest which are the employees</p>
<p>So, you know the idea that somebody that comes in at the absolute last minute</p>
<p>You know brad and I have done a bunch of ipos recently where he&rsquo;d like you get allocations in a book</p>
<p>He and I had nothing to do with companies, but we get it shares and we sell it day one</p>
<p>Then there are people that have been in that company for six seven eight nine ten years who sit around</p>
<p>You know twiddling their thumbs watching all these other people</p>
<p>Generate one one day returns. There was a tweet that bill gurley had yesterday that says</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a well-known crossover fund that over the last year has printed a billion dollars of one day share gains</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>So I think that lockups are kind of a regressive tax on the people that do the work and they</p>
<p>They are just rewarding people that have nothing to do with companies brad</p>
<p>What what do you do in grab because you lock yourself up right for a couple years and</p>
<p>Is there a lockup for the existing shareholders and grab? Yeah, so first I totally agree with chamath</p>
<p>Lockups are one of the most insidious things I think about the traditional ipo process</p>
<p>You know the fact that doordash employees are sitting there watching the stock go from 100 to 200 and then</p>
<p>You know all these other folks are selling while they&rsquo;ll watch the stock go from 200 back to 100</p>
<p>I would think it&rsquo;s incredibly demoralizing and it doesn&rsquo;t here&rsquo;s the thing. It doesn&rsquo;t need to exist</p>
<p>In roblox, there was no lockup</p>
<p>The employees were free to sell but guess what a lot of them chose not to sell</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s fair and and quicker price discovery when you actually allow it to happen</p>
<p>When you actually allow the supply and demand to exist in balance. So what we what we did at</p>
<p>At grab was we fought hard for the most open unlocked</p>
<p>Right day one we could possibly get</p>
<p>In that case, there are a lot of big shareholders who are on the board</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re deemed affiliates under section 16 of securities law, so they can&rsquo;t sell right they&rsquo;re deemed to be insiders, right? And</p>
<p>But we at the end of the day all employees can sell there is a group of senior management that said hey</p>
<p>We want to voluntarily lock it&rsquo;s a signal to the market, but all other employees in the company can sell</p>
<p>So there are over 5 000 employees in the company</p>
<p>And all of the early shareholders can sell on day one and I think this was</p>
<p>The first time i&rsquo;ve seen this in in, you know, this alternative ipo so we have almost a third</p>
<p>Uh of the entire share base of the company that is available for sale on day one incredible</p>
<p>Hey, brad, can I ask one more question? The um the the economics for grab</p>
<p>Are they are they better?</p>
<p>Under your structure than they would have been for traditional ipo to get the same amount of capital and they&rsquo;re paying seven percent to</p>
<p>The underwriting banks, you know as you as we all know, you know, bill</p>
<p>girly has</p>
<p>Has laboriously pointed out and documented that there are two expenses to a traditional ipo, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the upfront fee five and a half six percent, whatever they&rsquo;re paying on the amount of capital raised</p>
<p>But he would argue the much bigger expense</p>
<p>Right is the indirect cost of the structural underpricing, right?</p>
<p>Right. So in a traditional ipo, let&rsquo;s say you have a 10 billion dollar enterprise value raising a billion dollars</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s being underpriced he would argue structurally by 40. We can all debate that but that&rsquo;s 400 million dollars of dilution</p>
<p>To employees and to existing shareholders</p>
<p>I I think everybody in the grab process</p>
<p>both</p>
<p>the buy-side portfolio managers from fidelity janice tiro, etc as well as the company believe that we got a</p>
<p>20 to 30 percent higher price than a bank would have got because of the conviction the portfolios managers had</p>
<p>As a result of the significant investment</p>
<p>We were making in the company as a result of the fact that we were locking up our promote shares our sponsor shares for three</p>
<p>years</p>
<p>Um, and so if you say it&rsquo;s 30 on a four billion dollar raise, that&rsquo;s over a billion dollars of savings</p>
<p>Right over a billion dollars of indirect cost savings to the employees</p>
<p>And the shareholders and like for me</p>
<p>Our north star is founders. And so we literally have deconstructed the ipo at every step of the value chain</p>
<p>And to say, you know like rich barton my my thought partner in this he&rsquo;s taken</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the board of netflix when it went public took zillow public took expedia public</p>
<p>And he said like we can make this better at every step of the value chain</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve thought about it like a product and we build in a capital markets business. It says part of it</p>
<p>Right is eliminating the commission part of it is getting a fairer price, but part of it is curating that day one cap table</p>
<p>Right because these companies are stepping into the public markets</p>
<p>And you know as rich has said and others have said think about all the curation that goes into a private cap table</p>
<p>Now when you go public</p>
<p>Rich calls it a cap table randomization event</p>
<p>Right, you lose total control over your cap table, right?</p>
<p>Whereas in the case of grab we hand selected</p>
<p>What we think are the world&rsquo;s best public market shareholders to be their day one cap table</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very different outcome and it&rsquo;s not just about cost savings. It&rsquo;s not just about</p>
<p>Trying to get a fairer price. It&rsquo;s actually making the process better at each step of the value chain</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>So we were talking about coinbase last year when they had a big brouhaha and brian armstrong said</p>
<p>We are not going to talk about politics inside the company</p>
<p>Um, you can have political views but not inside the company sacks. You did some tweets about this. What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean</p>
<p>apparently</p>
<p>the coinbase&rsquo;s ban</p>
<p>On</p>
<p>Politics in the workplace and their refusal to submit to new york times interviews did not prevent them from creating an 85 billion dollar company</p>
<p>You know, i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m shocked shocked that they were able to to do that. Uh, that&rsquo;s basically what I tweeted</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>You know, it just shows that founders can do things their own way. They don&rsquo;t have to submit</p>
<p>To you know the woke mob and that&rsquo;s basically what I tweeted and then you know, of course</p>
<p>Well the first it&rsquo;s been interesting to see the reactions the first day</p>
<p>I got like 10 000 likes and then the second day. It seemed like some sort of sos went out</p>
<p>And uh now i&rsquo;ve been sort of surrounded</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been this like outcry and my takeaway is that the woke mob really doesn&rsquo;t like to be called out as a woke mob</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of they&rsquo;re sort of surrounding me with pitchforks now saying how dare you call us a mob. Um,</p>
<p>sax</p>
<p>Are you running for governor because it looks like you&rsquo;ve taken?</p>
<p>Botox</p>
<p>Did you take botox he&rsquo;s in miami, so it&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s going on with your</p>
<p>Lace on the botox</p>
<p>Your lips are incredibly swollen. I mean, they look very succulent. It&rsquo;s unbelievable</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a new lens. I&rsquo;ve got five different technologies. Uh making me slimming me here</p>
<p>But you do have your pin on today and you do look very governorial and I noticed that you bought i&rsquo;m wearing my miami pin</p>
<p>This is my city of miami pin francis gave you that francis gave me the pin that&rsquo;s fantastic. Did he tell you never call me francis</p>
<p>What is the big announcement today for you guys we&rsquo;re really excited to hear it. Yeah, tell us governor sax.com</p>
<p>What do you got on deck there? There&rsquo;s nothing this is a this is a jason construction. I don&rsquo;t want to get to me</p>
<p>Do we have a do we have an exploratory committee set up yet?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get sax out of the game. I need that deal. I mean guys guys</p>
<p>Obviously if this comes to pass we&rsquo;re going to rewrite history as david sax was our venturian candidate, you know</p>
<p>I floated the trial balloon</p>
<p>There was a layup</p>
<p>For david sax to come and alley-oop and dunk on gavin newsom. No, look. Oh, no, look</p>
<p>the world</p>
<p>I tell you newsom is doing everything in his power to to blow this recall because I mean</p>
<p>Timing is working in his favor. I mean he&rsquo;s done a horrible job on everything vaccine related</p>
<p>But the reality is covet is winding down. It&rsquo;s going to be over</p>
<p>So even though he delayed, um, everyone getting the vaccine by by weeks if not months months</p>
<p>Probably yeah by months</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got seven million unused doses sitting on the shelf in california because all of his crazy eligibility requirements</p>
<p>Despite all of that by the time we actually get around to the recall which will be in about five or six months</p>
<p>uh the recall election</p>
<p>You know, the economy&rsquo;s going to be booming again and we&rsquo;re going to be over people will probably forget</p>
<p>But but for the fact that he is now saying that he cannot guarantee that schools will reopen in the fall</p>
<p>So we now have we now have schools reopen</p>
<p>In you know every public schools reopen basically in every other state</p>
<p>You now have private schools are all reopened in california and he still cannot guarantee that schools will be reopened</p>
<p>Not not now but in the fall</p>
<p>David throw down the gauntlet</p>
<p>Yeah, make the guarantee you made enough money you will open all the public schools when they open in fall day one</p>
<p>Yeah, and uh, i&rsquo;m not this is the window david now or never i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not saying that that i&rsquo;m running</p>
<p>But one thing I would say is that whoever what what about if you ran?</p>
<p>If I ran I would 100 absolutely guarantee that school was opened in the fall</p>
<p>What we need what we need is a governor who will go to the teachers unions and say</p>
<p>Listen you will either report for your duty the first day of school five days a week no exceptions or you will look for another career</p>
<p>That is what we need</p>
<p>More more more</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not running. Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s go. Let&rsquo;s go. Can you make all the vending machines free?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. We can do that, too. Okay, can you can you get rid of all my debt?</p>
<p>Yeah, why not? Okay</p>
<p>Can we go back to the to the markets just for one second because I just want to I want to ask a couple questions</p>
<p>Brad, uh q1</p>
<p>Was nuts. Let&rsquo;s get some color commentary from a big player in the capital markets you talk us through us. Uh, talk to us through</p>
<p>what uh factor rotation</p>
<p>Was talk to us about your reactions to?</p>
<p>This archegos capital thing about inflation</p>
<p>Also gut check like what is that?</p>
<p>What is what is the rest of the year look like like talk just how what&rsquo;s your sentiment how you&rsquo;re feeling?</p>
<p>Just give us a reaction on just the economy and the gut check brad on</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t you like the biggest shareholder in united at some point?</p>
<p>And oh, yeah, that was a bad way to start off 2020. Yeah, I want to hear about the bad way to start</p>
<p>However, I would say that it ended up being the best year in the history of the firm</p>
<p>And so, you know like we like everybody else had to reinvent a lot of things about our business last year and and um,</p>
<p>Uh, we learned a lot from that moment and and the courage that a lot of people at united showed through through that period of</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>Without a lot of help. Uh, a lot of people think the government was helpful</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of unhelpful things that were being done, but notwithstanding that fact to chamas point</p>
<p>Um chamath, I think I went on cnbc in november and just said like when we normalize</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason that the 10-year shouldn&rsquo;t be uh back at the level it was in january 20</p>
<p>Right and for every one percent move in the 10-year</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a 10 to a 20</p>
<p>Draw down in growth multiples and the reason for that is very simple</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re long duration assets you discounted back at a higher rate and so you have multiple compression</p>
<p>And so we were starting at an all-time high in terms of growth equity multiples for both software and internet</p>
<p>When you look at october november of last year, we&rsquo;ve seen about</p>
<p>30 to 40 percent retracement</p>
<p>Or you know give back in terms of those multiples</p>
<p>Right in some names. It&rsquo;s bigger and sometimes some names. It&rsquo;s less. I suspect that there&rsquo;s another 10 to 20 to go</p>
<p>Right, uh for a 10-year that&rsquo;s going to be sitting here at 1-8</p>
<p>Um it I just got done talking as part of this road show as you know to all the biggest growth equity</p>
<p>Portfolio managers on the on the public buy side. I can tell you they&rsquo;re all deleveraging growth</p>
<p>They are not adding they&rsquo;re not looking to add dollars to growth and these are the biggest</p>
<p>Managers in the world and so we&rsquo;re not through that process</p>
<p>There are some people who&rsquo;ve anchored themselves to the fact that zoom was just at 500</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh my god, it&rsquo;s going straight back to 500. You&rsquo;re like no 500 was the outlier event</p>
<p>That was the all-time high multiple event. It will get there in the fullness of time</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to have to get there through earnings. So so what do you think then happens in the privates and you know?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about</p>
<p>Certain firms some of your competitors in the growth stage side ripping capital into companies every 24 hours or 48 hours</p>
<p>where where does that then normalize because aren&rsquo;t we setting up a dynamic where</p>
<p>If you have a bunch of growth firms pricing crazy rounds whose valuations can then will not be able to be</p>
<p>Held up in the public markets. Aren&rsquo;t we creating a different kind of problem?</p>
<p>well, um</p>
<p>You know you and i&rsquo;ve watched this dynamic play out probably four or five times over the course of the last 15 years</p>
<p>Where there&rsquo;s this inversion?</p>
<p>Private capital markets private markets are actually overvalued relative to public markets</p>
<p>I just look at a few ipos this week over the last couple weeks deliveroo hot private company down 30% in the ipo</p>
<p>App lovin came out this week 20% down in the ipo, right at the end of the day</p>
<p>The great that you know as munger likes to say, you know</p>
<p>The markets are a voting machine and the public markets are a brutal voting machine</p>
<p>um, and so</p>
<p>You know, it just is going to take remember when groupon got done that last private round at 20 billion</p>
<p>And then about nine months later is trading at 5 billion or zynga. I mean you and I go through this we&rsquo;ve watched this</p>
<p>You know, so it just takes the smack down and people losing actual money</p>
<p>um, and and however</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the one side right? This is a temporary dynamic markets will clear</p>
<p>I think it is possible you referenced, you know, uh, a good friend of of mine, you know</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s supposedly writing a term sheet every two days?</p>
<p>Um, you know, uh at tiger the truth of the matter is you can hop you can hold simultaneous troops</p>
<p>You can believe the next three months that we&rsquo;re likely to have more multiple compression in the public markets, right?</p>
<p>You could hedge your public book in a variety of ways against that like like we did and and announced last last december</p>
<p>And at the same time you can believe that the secular trend in technology has never been more potent</p>
<p>Right, and I believe that if you own an index of the top 30 percent of technology companies in the world today</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re willing to hold them for five to ten years. You will be</p>
<p>Incredibly well rewarded the the the most asymmetric bet maybe in the history of all of investing</p>
<p>Is having a golden ticket to have access to the best technology companies in the world today</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like unfair play and everybody on this call is playing in what is a highly asymmetric and unfair game</p>
<p>Stacked in our favor now</p>
<p>We can screw that up by trying to think we&rsquo;re good at short-term trading or doing a bunch of other stuff</p>
<p>We can get individual things wrong</p>
<p>But if you bet on the top</p>
<p>The top quartile of technology companies on a global basis like tiger and others are doing</p>
<p>Um, and and you have time on your side. You&rsquo;re going to be well rewarded</p>
<p>we talked about</p>
<p>the mid-market late stage</p>
<p>Venture space being a no-man&rsquo;s land a vortex</p>
<p>The value being created in the late stage and value being created in the early stage</p>
<p>But the money in the middle becoming a commodity</p>
<p>Because of tiger co2 and others coming in and just coming over the top. Do you uh subscribe to that broad?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s just a financial transaction in the middle and not a lot of value to be made there or do you think?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I you know, listen</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter in snowflake whether you invested in the 100 million dollar round the 200 million dollar round the 500 million dollar round</p>
<p>The billion dollar round where sequoia came in</p>
<p>You know if the company&rsquo;s going to two three four hundred billion dollars, right? All of those are extraordinary returns</p>
<p>So altimeter has described itself</p>
<p>Often as a life cycle investor, right? I represent the biggest portion of the capital in the firm</p>
<p>Some long-term endowments are number two and number three</p>
<p>And we have a multi-decade view on the world and our view is the one that I just articulated</p>
<p>I want to have maximum dollars</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care that it&rsquo;s all in the b or the c or the d or the ipo or you know</p>
<p>I want to have maximum dollars behind our best ideas and I want to be an incredible partner to these companies</p>
<p>As they move through the life cycle and part of the reason we build a capital markets business</p>
<p>To help founders in a better way step into the public markets is it&rsquo;s part of our mission, right?</p>
<p>Like I want to you know</p>
<p>How frustrating it was to me jason to be pre-mar or pre-ipo and mongo or twilio or octa</p>
<p>And then when it came to the ipo I have to go to the banks and grovel</p>
<p>Right and grovel for an allocation and they dribble five or ten million and I see them handing big</p>
<p>You know big allocations to people who I know are going to flip it and I actually want to own this stuff</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very frustrating. And so we think there&rsquo;s a better way and when those companies come public in the future</p>
<p>You said something which I want to use as a question to</p>
<p>Friedberg and sax and jason because these guys are involved very since in one way in what i&rsquo;m going to say</p>
<p>Which is you said gross tonnage of dollars one of the most incredible things that I thought about the</p>
<p>coinbase</p>
<p>S1</p>
<p>Was the amount of unbelievably smart buying that andreessen did and I thought to myself</p>
<p>Andreessen just out sequoia sequoia</p>
<p>And what do you guys think about sort of how they&rsquo;ve been able to</p>
<p>To actually execute it just seems like andreessen is done an incredible incredible job</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to I mean jason you&rsquo;re close to sequoia. So are you friedberg? I just want you to react to that</p>
<p>No, you gotta get you gotta give them credit on coinbase because I think they made the they made the most money I guess</p>
<p>Ribbit and gary tannin initialized may have made the highest roi because they invested a smaller amount of dollars earlier</p>
<p>my return my return in ribbit, uh</p>
<p>The maya from iconic told me was 506 times, right? Exactly. So so so ribbit made the 500x and I guess</p>
<p>Andreessen but andreessen made like 20 billion of returns of which you know, they&rsquo;re probably getting 25 30</p>
<p>So they they made the most money</p>
<p>May not have been the highest irr, but it was the most money and you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>They doubled down in this like 2018 2019 period. It sounded like they were doing a bunch of secondary buying</p>
<p>They were buying the stock at 25 bucks. Yeah, they bought it all from fred wilson in union square</p>
<p>So as much as from other investors, yeah, they were just they did what soccer did with twitter right and with uber and started buying</p>
<p>But they did it but they did it at a time where people were losing faith in crypto</p>
<p>There was like, you know, remember there&rsquo;s like this big</p>
<p>Winter. Yeah, there was a big crypto boom and like i&rsquo;d say december of 2017 january 2018</p>
<p>Then it kind of collapsed and the you know mirrors the price of bitcoin</p>
<p>You had bitcoin reached a peak of about 20 000 that crashed all the way down to four to three or four thousand</p>
<p>Obviously that was a great time to buy bitcoin</p>
<p>But it sounds like these guys were also buying coinbase at that time</p>
<p>So that was a pretty that was a remarkable doubling. By the way, it&rsquo;s a good it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a good validation of brad&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>About you know market perturbations being fairly independent of value creation over the long run</p>
<p>And you know if you have faith that this is where value will be created over a period of 10 plus years</p>
<p>um, you know, you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re when you have an opportunity to buy in buy in and don&rsquo;t let the market perturbations drive your</p>
<p>Decision-making or else you end up in this market trading trap</p>
<p>Um, yeah, I think I think we&rsquo;ve we&rsquo;ve talked about this a lot warren buffett talks about it a lot</p>
<p>I think chamath you&rsquo;ve made the point about</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>Not timing the markets but your time in the markets and this notion that when you have conviction in a business or an idea</p>
<p>or a thesis</p>
<p>uh, you know, you can continue to double down on that conviction regardless of whether you think relative valuations are appropriate or</p>
<p>Or kind of just join it at the time. It&rsquo;s even more acute</p>
<p>Because what happens is we make short-term decisions</p>
<p>And then those short-term decisions oftentimes to prove to be right in the short term and let me give you an example</p>
<p>And then it leads to behavioral lock-in right so at the end of 2014 bitcoin&rsquo;s at 1100 a share</p>
<p>We get I get very interested in crypto. I think this is one of the most asymmetric bets I see in the world</p>
<p>Right. I have I think it&rsquo;s a low probability event. But if you win the size of the prize is absolutely gigantic, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re looking at a deal with um andreason</p>
<p>Because I thought balaji was one of the smartest people in the space</p>
<p>The company was called 21.co idea of mining for bitcoin on a chip</p>
<p>on the eve of the deal</p>
<p>My partner and I I said, you know what?</p>
<p>I believe that we should place our bet in bitcoin</p>
<p>Because i&rsquo;m not sure whether or not this mining company is actually going to work out. Okay, so we pass on the deal</p>
<p>crypto bitcoin goes from 1200 to 300 in like a straight line down</p>
<p>And what was my takeaway?</p>
<p>My takeaway was like man. I&rsquo;m so smart. I&rsquo;m so smart. We passed on that deal</p>
<p>Okay, rather than being curious rather than learning more rather than developing it</p>
<p>And what andreason did during that period of time is they stuck to their belief that this could be a highly asymmetric outcome</p>
<p>Ultimately, I ran into katie hawn a board member at coinbase the night of the ipo</p>
<p>And she said brad, you know, um, do you remember you know 21.co?</p>
<p>I was like, yeah, she goes those were some of our original shares in coinbase. We sold that company to coinbase. Wow</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>and and</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s just for me</p>
<p>I sent this note to our team because I said, you know what guys in the face of having some good wins</p>
<p>I want to remind you</p>
<p>of some really potent</p>
<p>near near wins and misses</p>
<p>And my mistake at that point in time was I lacked mental flexibility</p>
<p>I got locked in to this idea that I was really smart by having missed 21.co</p>
<p>Rather than learning from that moment and saying listen when I started to see it move and then it moved pretty quickly</p>
<p>And I was like, oh I missed it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a stock we do the same thing</p>
<p>The reality is you should allocate to things that you think are thematically highly</p>
<p>Asymmetric and great ideas and and this was one of them and one we missed</p>
<p>Can I just can I just add something to that I was in 21, it was 21.e6. I don&rsquo;t remember getting any coinbase shares</p>
<p>All right, so somebody somebody you did not own the preferred</p>
<p>I did own preferred I invested you did not clear the pref stack. You&rsquo;re the wrong series</p>
<p>One thing i&rsquo;ll add to that is you have to look at the mandate of these funds</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an early stage fund and you have the ability to sell at 500 x or 1000 x or 2000 x</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to lock that in</p>
<p>And give something to your lps and I think this is where</p>
<p>You know thinking full life cycle. You said chamath like what did you learn from all this?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re building a business, right?</p>
<p>Well, I mean one of the things I learned is I didn&rsquo;t even know what prorata really was when I started my career</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do prorata in uber or anything</p>
<p>and now my position is I am</p>
<p>Going super prorata in our winners. So not only holding winners</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get to 10 15 ownership in these companies and it&rsquo;s starting to happen</p>
<p>You know with companies that are worth 500 or 700 million</p>
<p>and so that that is the economic that&rsquo;s the change in behavior i&rsquo;m doing which is</p>
<p>You know to your point if you bought snowflake at any time, you feel great about it</p>
<p>But then you have to have buy-in from your lps that they agree with that</p>
<p>And that they&rsquo;re okay with you taking a longer strategy and then at some point you want to return capital</p>
<p>And that becomes super problematic, you know, you&rsquo;re in seven eight nine ten of your fund</p>
<p>You want to take some chips off the table?</p>
<p>and so what i&rsquo;m going to do now is</p>
<p>I think i&rsquo;m going to try to do both where I have a group of lps who want to buy shares</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how to figure this out</p>
<p>And maybe somebody could advise me here</p>
<p>Because I have had other venture firms who had this challenge</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>The I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t want anything you own</p>
<p>Well, no, no, I know that</p>
<p>Bro, be careful</p>
<p>Why do you say yourself like that? No, yeah, i&rsquo;m looking for advice here</p>
<p>The whole point of this podcast is for me to draft off people who are smarter than me</p>
<p>Mission accomplished. So here we go. Yeah, we still have to teach you how to set up an llc to buy your house</p>
<p>Sorry, i&rsquo;m an idiot nouveau riche, but here&rsquo;s the issue can I be an angel investor in</p>
<p>Uber and then be selling shares in uber to my other lps</p>
<p>And creating that sock a secondary market or is that conflicted? You know, i&rsquo;ll tell you, you know, um,</p>
<p>Uh, I think this is public</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s public. I will say it anyway because I think it&rsquo;s well known but um</p>
<p>Founders fund had early spacex shares that they thought it was prudent to sell in the early funds</p>
<p>Those spacex shares the later fund was buying spacex shares in that round</p>
<p>Um, and so they were in a circumstance where they had such a big markup on the early round the early fund</p>
<p>um that they had to kind of distribute and liquidate those spacex shares meanwhile, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Some of with a good overlap of lps were buying in the other fund at that at that higher price</p>
<p>You are speaking to something I lived out in the early venture funds of social capital because when it was not</p>
<p>Entirely my own capital base</p>
<p>I felt that pressure and I did similar things because I was like, oh wow, we&rsquo;re in year seven eight nine</p>
<p>You know that I had and I had great lps. It&rsquo;s like wait</p>
<p>How can I not give capital back to the brode or mayo? These are phenomenal institutions</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t pressuring me at all, but I felt internal pressure and I started to make suboptimal decisions for myself. I couldn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>really, you know</p>
<p>Clearly the best optimized decision which would have been to hold everything as long as possible, you know to your point</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re in the top quartile of things</p>
<p>The best thing is to never sell and it&rsquo;s an incredibly</p>
<p>Special place where you can actually have that freedom to do it</p>
<p>The it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s interesting is I actually think the the folks that are in the best position to do are actually employees and you I</p>
<p>Actually think that they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re randomly doing this when you look at the churn rates of employees today</p>
<p>Like I saw this crazy stat the average tenure at uber is 1.8 years. That&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>The average tenure at tesla is 2.1 years. The average tenure at google is 3.2 years</p>
<p>so if you think about a traditional tenure career in the valley, you have somewhere between</p>
<p>You know three five three and five different baskets of shares</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re getting and you know, those are those are costless options effectively</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually an incredible form of portfolio construction for these people because if you never</p>
<p>Have to sell those things you can wait till they go public and you can underwrite them forever</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably what a lot of employees in silicon valley have figured out implicitly</p>
<p>I have a question I want to ask you guys as well</p>
<p>Which is um, I just want to go back to the public markets for a second</p>
<p>I tweeted out some of these amazing things I learned from the bezos. Oh my god. This is demented</p>
<p>Did you guys see what I what I tweeted? I saw your tweet and I and i&rsquo;ve been reading it. It&rsquo;s unbelievably</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been do you have it in front of you? Jason? I do i&rsquo;ll just give you the chamat&rsquo;s tweet here high level</p>
<p>28 percent of purchases on amazon are completed in less than three minutes. I think we&rsquo;ve all done that</p>
<p>50 percent of purchase is on amazon are completed in less than 15</p>
<p>And if you actually look at that, and I think this is a really I don&rsquo;t know if you made this calculation</p>
<p>No, this is bezos wrote it in the letter all of these things</p>
<p>So if you value your time at ten dollars an hour a very low one</p>
<p>um, that&rsquo;s 750 a year, um,</p>
<p>And that means your prime is free of 120 a year still</p>
<p>630 in profit. Let me say differently. Uh</p>
<p>The average trip to the store driving buying coming back is an hour</p>
<p>So what bezos said is that typically we will save you 75 hours because we can make all of that more efficient for you</p>
<p>At 10 bucks an hour. That&rsquo;s worth 750 dollars. We only charge you 120 for prime, which means you&rsquo;re you get</p>
<p>630 dollars of savings, but then he goes on to say and we have 200 million customers on prime. So we&rsquo;re saving them</p>
<p>126 billion dollars my instant reaction was two things. And so the last two points in that tweet are mine</p>
<p>One is holy fuck that&rsquo;s more in one year than what most companies are worth in their entire lifetime</p>
<p>And the second is that you can buy amazon for 13 times one year&rsquo;s worth of savings for a customer</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just if you look at prime</p>
<p>Yeah, which which makes amazon seem exceptionally cheap</p>
<p>but I reason I brought up amazon is he also wrote in there about his</p>
<p>Responsibility to his employees and we were just talking about employees and churn</p>
<p>And this was incredible to me that 70 percent of their employees voted down the unionization effort in alabama</p>
<p>And I just wanted to get saxy poo. Yeah, red red pill it crush it snort it. What do you what do you got to say?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean what what happened is you had in alabama? There&rsquo;s a amazon plant there</p>
<p>that uh where they there basically was an election to decide whether they would go union or not and there were</p>
<p>2,536 workers who voted in this union election</p>
<p>about 1,800 voted against unionization</p>
<p>versus</p>
<p>738 who voted to unionize</p>
<p>And then ballots from another 505 workers were either were challenged by either amazon or the union</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know yet what they mean, but those votes won&rsquo;t change the outcomes</p>
<p>The election is over now. This was a heavily lobbied</p>
<p>Election. I mean amazon was lobbying</p>
<p>um employees</p>
<p>but so were the unions and it looks like the unions at the end of the day or lost and</p>
<p>The employees voted to you know, remain unionless</p>
<p>Brad what do you think?</p>
<p>I thought it was a beautiful defense of capitalism. That&rsquo;s very much needed right now. Yeah, you know, um</p>
<p>It reminded me a lot frankly of the gates foundation annual letter</p>
<p>You know where bill gates is saying, you know capitalism is far from perfect</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s resulted in the most important era of prosperity and health and wellness in the history of the planet</p>
<p>And you know as I said on cnbc this week, you know, we live at a moment where capitalism is absolutely under attack</p>
<p>um, and</p>
<p>I truly believe it&rsquo;s the greatest force</p>
<p>The greatest potential force for good in the world</p>
<p>It brought us a vaccine</p>
<p>right, it brings us innovation that pulls people out of poverty that makes people healthier that</p>
<p>Gives an opportunity for people in rural areas that are impoverished to be educated</p>
<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s incumbent upon</p>
<p>Bezos, I think this was very much a robber baron sort of defense of building railroads</p>
<p>And I thought it was brilliant in its execution</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s important in it for all of us to stand up not defensively</p>
<p>But to say what are our obligations to make capitalism the greatest force for good?</p>
<p>You know chamath whether it&rsquo;s you and I talking about invest america on cnbc and giving every child in this country</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>participation in the ownership society, right right or all the other initiatives that we need to work on to</p>
<p>You know to to make the case we need to make it better</p>
<p>And I think one of the issues here is you know, what we see on twitter being part of the twitterati</p>
<p>Is you know people who are super woke socialist, whatever</p>
<p>Talking about this, but in reality the workers don&rsquo;t want it and I was talking to somebody in the media space</p>
<p>No, hold on. Can I just say something slightly different jason?</p>
<p>I think what workers don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>Is the version 1.0 of unions? Okay, because I think what they see that as</p>
<p>is attacks</p>
<p>That then goes and fills the coffers of certain people</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve seen like, you know a bunch of waste a bunch of graft a bunch of corruption people have been arrested</p>
<p>Unions are not effective anymore in collective bargaining. They are not they don&rsquo;t have any data. They don&rsquo;t have any facts</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not they don&rsquo;t have any power</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re but they&rsquo;re not set up to win. So I think</p>
<p>In my opinion, I think unions have an important role</p>
<p>But you need a version 2.0. You need some young smart bright people</p>
<p>To reframe what unions are and then I think you would see everybody collectively organized which is it&rsquo;s not about dues. You don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of dollars to</p>
<p>To all of a sudden like use to then elect certain people and that old model is breaking</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s breaking every day instead. I think what people need to do is like if you come together and like you understand</p>
<p>What are the products we make what are the margins we have?</p>
<p>How is my contribution measured, you know, and then you&rsquo;re able to use data and fact to really collectively bargain</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t happened yet</p>
<p>So I think what it was or it could be a free market and people could go work at starbucks or for postmates</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good. I get paid more but capitalism allows both to exist. Yeah, if you if you think about what a union is</p>
<p>You could almost make an argument that it is the ultimate</p>
<p>Manifestation of a free market system because it is basically like a bunch of people spitting out to have their own startup</p>
<p>And so, you know that group of people are saying we&rsquo;re not charging enough for our product or service today</p>
<p>The value that we are creating is worth more</p>
<p>Therefore we should go create a you know</p>
<p>A different business and charge more and effectively compete in the marketplace</p>
<p>With a higher quality product at a higher at a higher price point</p>
<p>and I think that that may be kind of you know, the</p>
<p>Distinction between what people kind of view to be regulatory capture around unions where there have has been government involvement in the past</p>
<p>Versus what may be possible. I think i&rsquo;ve heard some people talk about how</p>
<p>You know at some point in the world</p>
<p>We end up with at some point the evolution of capitalism you end up in a place where there are no employees</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a ton of independent contractors doing independent work</p>
<p>And maybe there is an organization of people around doing the same work over and over together as a group</p>
<p>Where you charge one kind of you know, uh aggregated fixed rate for that service</p>
<p>The other the other thing to me was like all of a sudden it brought into such a stark contrast</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t like 55 45</p>
<p>This was 70 30 and probably it could have been 80 20 or 90 10</p>
<p>And so it said to me wait a minute</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very small vocal group of people who are screaming for the mountaintops about this level of unionization and organization</p>
<p>And then the people that are actually the the participants of that system are like no. Thank you. Yeah</p>
<p>Well, I mean it shows that amazon does a great job managing right?</p>
<p>I mean they they create enough value and they&rsquo;ve bid enough for the service that people don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re being underbid</p>
<p>Media companies have been going through a unionization process from gawker to vox</p>
<p>The new york times has already had one and you&rsquo;re starting to see a bunch of folks voting on that</p>
<p>I was speaking to somebody who runs one of these companies and</p>
<p>they said</p>
<p>the in the short term, it&rsquo;s fabulous because</p>
<p>They set the prices of employees</p>
<p>So when somebody comes to you and says I want to raise they say well</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t because here&rsquo;s the pay scale that you negotiated</p>
<p>so we have to stick to that and I can&rsquo;t give you more than other people because</p>
<p>One of the things you fought for as a union was pay parity. And so you&rsquo;ve got five years</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it says on the chart five years. So it made everything predictable</p>
<p>And they said they like that. They said the problem is</p>
<p>Over the long term when you get to year 10 of a union in order to fire somebody</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s not doing a great job you have negotiated with the union that they have to get all these</p>
<p>Warnings and it&rsquo;s uncomfortable. So then the managers don&rsquo;t do the performance plans</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do that and then eventually who&rsquo;s left in the organization</p>
<p>The lower performers and then who leaves the higher performers who can command more money</p>
<p>So once you get this union thing going inside of a media company</p>
<p>In the short term it controls costs in the long term. It kills excellence</p>
<p>This was what somebody told me have you guys seen the movie?</p>
<p>American factory I think this was on netflix. It was actually created by am I uh, it was the first film produced by</p>
<p>Barack and michelle obama&rsquo;s production company</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a very interesting film</p>
<p>about there&rsquo;s a chinese billionaire who goes to</p>
<p>Kind of the rust belt to also a little um city outside dayton, ohio</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s and basically opens a a factory producing glass windshields for cars</p>
<p>And this this factory had been shut down. The whole town was kind of out of work</p>
<p>They were kind of down and down in the dumps</p>
<p>And so this this crazy chinese billionaire comes in there and reopens the factory</p>
<p>And all he and and it creates like 2 000 jobs for for people in this town</p>
<p>And everything starts off great</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s these really interesting sort of culture clashes between the american workers and the chinese executives and</p>
<p>Some of it&rsquo;s kind of comical and they show it in the movie</p>
<p>but then about halfway through the movie and and by the way, like these are people who are out of work and</p>
<p>You know this chinese company comes in and they do things kind of their way</p>
<p>But they pay people pretty well and creating a lot of jobs and initially</p>
<p>Everybody is very happy with it and the politicians are all encouraging it and then about halfway through the movie the unions come in</p>
<p>And the unions start agitating and they start telling all the workers that you&rsquo;re underpaid. You&rsquo;re mistreated</p>
<p>They start, you know, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s sort of intimidation</p>
<p>Tactics being used and then the politicians come in and you know, these politicians are sort of, you know</p>
<p>This is ohio, right?</p>
<p>And so the politicians start telling the the workers at this plant that they should get unionized</p>
<p>and it turns into this giant battle because and and the chinese company basically threatens to leave because</p>
<p>They came into this town and made a something like a 500 million dollar investment</p>
<p>In this plant based on an understanding</p>
<p>Of a certain cost structure and now all of a sudden the union wants to change that</p>
<p>And you know turns into this giant conflict and you realize that look that workers in this town had a good deal</p>
<p>And then the unions are about to like blow the whole thing</p>
<p>And and wreck it and they&rsquo;re about to drive this chinese company out of the town</p>
<p>And then they do this election kind of like what amazon did and ultimately</p>
<p>The chinese company wins and the voters choose not to go with the union, but you just feel like you can it&rsquo;s just so frustrating</p>
<p>to see this, um</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not like the the this particular union is benefiting the workers. It&rsquo;s about benefiting these union representatives</p>
<p>Or then paying off the politicians which gets back to our discussion in your little speech for your governor</p>
<p>Run that you&rsquo;re going to fire all the teachers come september 1st if they don&rsquo;t show up for work</p>
<p>no, but look, it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s a really interesting movie because</p>
<p>I think what it does is it highlights that what&rsquo;s in the interest of these?</p>
<p>Labor union leaders is not necessarily what&rsquo;s in the interest of the employees anybody watch no no</p>
<p>This guys look that this is like the simplest form of incentives to understand you pay dues as a union member</p>
<p>Those revenues get allocated and controlled by a handful of people in union leadership</p>
<p>so this is this shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that their incentives get misaligned, especially when</p>
<p>You go from a small effective union to a broad, you know union that represents all kinds of different workers</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an impossible infrastructure to manage and it becomes unwieldy</p>
<p>Unions can be effective</p>
<p>There is a value and a place for them. They need to get reinvented by the way</p>
<p>I look this up, you know</p>
<p>The average wage, uh, the average fee is to be in a union across all unions in the united states as a percent of labor</p>
<p>Anyone got a guess it wanted it&rsquo;s one and a half percent. Yeah, I said two. Yeah</p>
<p>So the argument is if they can increase wages net to those employees by more than one and a half percent it pays for itself</p>
<p>Right that that&rsquo;s the argument about their incentive</p>
<p>I totally get it. They are startup in and of themselves. They are an asset manager, right? Their goal is to grow assets</p>
<p>Yeah, and so their goal is to grow assets. So so the more assets they grow, um</p>
<p>You know the uh, the bigger their business the the way in which you know relating this back to bezos&rsquo;s annual letter, right?</p>
<p>Um, we&rsquo;ve been presented this false choice for two decades</p>
<p>between some form of ann randy and capitalism</p>
<p>And a nanny state right, right, right that either everything&rsquo;s unionized</p>
<p>Or we have no intervention at all</p>
<p>What I love about this moment in time</p>
<p>What I love about the leadership of benioff or bezos or gates or even anthony tan this incredible mission</p>
<p>Values driven leader who&rsquo;s using the power of capitalism to uplift tens of millions of people in southeast. Asia</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p>I see a totally new generation of leaders that understand the responsibility like they&rsquo;re charting the middle way</p>
<p>Right and we can equally reject lorena gonzalez</p>
<p>Right and at the same time we&rsquo;re want to have 15 minimum wage in the state of california like those two things are mutually</p>
<p>compatible and so</p>
<p>Um, that&rsquo;s why sax has to run</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a chart the third way</p>
<p>Let me ask you this brad. Would you put up 250k for an exploratory fund brad sax?</p>
<p>Do you put do you do you believe in a 15 minimum wage?</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be fine. I&rsquo;d be fine with that. It&rsquo;s not that that&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s on he took a blue pill</p>
<p>He took a blue pill give everyone everything certainly in the state of california. I think that makes sense</p>
<p>You know, I think look there might be some parts of the country where the standard of living is much cheaper</p>
<p>I mean, I think probably the the minimum wage should be a state issue because there&rsquo;s such a disparity and different</p>
<p>Uh costs of living in different states, so i&rsquo;m not sure i&rsquo;d federalize it but i&rsquo;m but certainly in california</p>
<p>I think 15 bucks. I mean, what about 20 bucks david? Yeah, david. 20 bucks in california. Why not? Why not a thousand? Yeah</p>
<p>I love that</p>
<p>Can everyone get a free tesla</p>
<p>No, but look, can I make can we make the point about unions in california?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a huge difference between private sector unions and public sector unions</p>
<p>So look i&rsquo;m not against collective bargaining when it comes to these private sector unions</p>
<p>Okay, because the the workers do have you know, these these uh plants</p>
<p>Involve can involve very tough working conditions. It&rsquo;s physically dangerous</p>
<p>Um, you know there before there were labor reforms they were working really long insane hours or safety issues</p>
<p>okay, I think it makes sense to have some sort of collective bargaining and there&rsquo;s somebody to</p>
<p>Negotiate with there&rsquo;s the management of the company has an incentive</p>
<p>And so you have some give and take and you have a negotiation it produces an outcome</p>
<p>Public sector unions are completely different right because when the teachers union goes to negotiate who are they negotiating with?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re negotiating with gavin newsom</p>
<p>And the teachers union is his biggest contributor</p>
<p>So who has an incentive to oppose their demands? There&rsquo;s no market. There&rsquo;s no market and so</p>
<p>at a minimum takes a politician who</p>
<p>Has a lot of integrity to stand up to the teachers unions because</p>
<p>He did it in new york</p>
<p>Bloomberg did do it by the way, by the way</p>
<p>This is this is a true market dynamic for everything as it relates to government spending</p>
<p>If you think about when when the government says it&rsquo;s going to spend something on someone on something</p>
<p>Legislation passes and it mandates that something needs to be bought</p>
<p>When that happens, there is no negotiating power because there is no marketplace to achieve that objective</p>
<p>They have to spend the money on the thing that they said they were going to spend it on</p>
<p>And at that point there is a seller who sells that thing who says oh shit. These guys have to buy it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll double the price. Okay, great. That&rsquo;s just the natural law of government inflation that happens</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happened with everything that we&rsquo;ve seen inflate in this country education</p>
<p>Healthcare is all because it&rsquo;s a government mandated service</p>
<p>And so then the service providers to the government have a single captive customer who has to spend the money</p>
<p>And so the same is true of education the government has to educate</p>
<p>Therefore I can show up as an education union and say i&rsquo;m going to double my price</p>
<p>To educate your people because you have to do it by law</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve passed all these laws that say you have to do it and there is nothing the government can do about it</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think it is worth highlighting that they&rsquo;re the lack of a marketplace meaning</p>
<p>If you were to negotiate with a company, let&rsquo;s say a company had to buy productivity software for its employees</p>
<p>It could decide whether or not buying that productivity software generated a positive return at the price point</p>
<p>That the sellers are negotiating against them and they could say no, you know what i&rsquo;m not going to buy it</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s too expensive. I&rsquo;m going to go find another way</p>
<p>The problem is governments are mandated to spend that money on that particular service</p>
<p>And therefore there is no room and so unions are a manifestation</p>
<p>Of this fundamental problem with giving governments large budgets and relying on the government to provide the service to us</p>
<p>Outside of a market driven context</p>
<p>So I think the question really is can health care can education can these things that have been inflated?</p>
<p>With the government having such an active role be provided in a way that the government facilitates their provisioning</p>
<p>Without the government being the customer. This is a good jumping off point to one very uh to the next then topic</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of things happening in government that I just want to get your guys&rsquo;s reaction to one</p>
<p>which was uh</p>
<p>The crazy summary that somebody did about the reaction to biden pulling out of afghanistan. Okay, the second is</p>
<p>Unfortunately biden reiterated trump&rsquo;s decision on uh refugee numbers just today</p>
<p>Um, so he&rsquo;s not he had a pledge that he would</p>
<p>You know go back to the the original numbers, uh</p>
<p>The obama level numbers and he said he&rsquo;s not going to he&rsquo;s going to keep it at the trump level</p>
<p>which basically says, you know, very nominal refugees and then the third is</p>
<p>the growing</p>
<p>Frustration and perceived incompetence of the cdc and now you have the entire business community</p>
<p>Starting to push back. Those are three completely different things, but they just speak about some government things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about your reactions to anybody</p>
<p>I mean the thing that that highlights for me is the media double standard</p>
<p>and I think this is why a lot of people are going to centrism and why this podcast has become a purple podcast and a</p>
<p>rational podcast because</p>
<p>Aoc was going down to the border hysterical crying. You remember the photos they were all dressed in white</p>
<p>And is there any difference between what trump did at the border and what&rsquo;s happening now?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t feel like it feels like it&rsquo;s a problem that they&rsquo;re both trying to solve and it&rsquo;s 90 the same outcome</p>
<p>And then you look at afghanistan</p>
<p>You know trump&rsquo;s like we got to get out of here and then the press dunks on him</p>
<p>Like how could you do that?</p>
<p>And now biden&rsquo;s doing and he&rsquo;s getting high fives</p>
<p>And so I would just like to see some consistency from the press and the reaction</p>
<p>and americans on these issues which seem to be</p>
<p>non-winnable or</p>
<p>you know, how much do you lose in these instances like</p>
<p>Afghanistan&rsquo;s a lose lose and the border is a lose lose like there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no winning</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think in these in some in some situations that a president has to face. I&rsquo;m interested what sax has to say</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I saw that I saw that tweet storm on the media double standard around afghanistan</p>
<p>We should show that and link to it in the show notes because the whoever it was incredible. It&rsquo;s incredible. I mean</p>
<p>This is like definitive proof of the media double standard where he goes literally</p>
<p>He does a side by side of every single major prestige media outlet their coverage on trump versus biden&rsquo;s drawdown in afghanistan</p>
<p>You know trump trump did the major drawdown and I think got us down to maybe like 1500 troops there</p>
<p>I think he missed a political opportunity not to just go all the way down to zero</p>
<p>Then he could have taken credit for ending the war which I think he</p>
<p>Wanted to do for whatever reason he didn&rsquo;t get it done</p>
<p>And he basically handed biden a beautiful opportunity just to kind of end the war once and for all I think it&rsquo;s very popular</p>
<p>People are we&rsquo;ve been there for 20 years. I think people want to get out. So I think biden&rsquo;s decision was</p>
<p>Politically correct and I think it was the the the right decision as well</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s time to be</p>
<p>Out of there, but yeah, the coverage in the press was just completely hysterical about trump doing it</p>
<p>It was predicting all sorts of negative consequences</p>
<p>um, and then when biden did it like like jason saying it was um, nothing but kudos, so well</p>
<p>Not only is a press not objective and not impartial</p>
<p>But they change their mind about a particular issue based on which team is doing it</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean if you look at the two quotes</p>
<p>They have a cnn tweet that they he just screen grabbed cnn on the same issue</p>
<p>He says this is reckless and it&rsquo;s really risky of trump&rsquo;s plan to withdraw troops and then</p>
<p>the next cnn tweet from this administration president obama praised president biden&rsquo;s bold leadership to withdraw from</p>
<p>Afghanistan by september 11th, and there&rsquo;s dozens of these npr cnn new york times</p>
<p>And over again, and then I think this is why americans hate the media. Absolutely</p>
<p>I mean, this is the you know, what the what the conservatives I would call the mainstream media, you know msn</p>
<p>I mean, but they are proving their bias right here. I mean and they&rsquo;re increasing irrelevance</p>
<p>This is why the american public don&rsquo;t trust them. Don&rsquo;t listen to them and don&rsquo;t care what they have to say</p>
<p>Brad, what do you think? Well, I I wanted to</p>
<p>You know at a federal level. We really can&rsquo;t opt out of any of this, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to leave the country. We got an election every four years</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re just talking about market failures in the state of california</p>
<p>And one of the most beautiful designs of our system of federalism</p>
<p>back to this idea of markets</p>
<p>Right is the fact that you get to choose what state you want to live in</p>
<p>And in a post-covid world, we have the greatest</p>
<p>ab testing</p>
<p>in the history of federalism</p>
<p>Because now you can live and work from anywhere</p>
<p>And the differences between state policies have never been greater</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve never had this incubation that we can all watch and live tweet about on twitter</p>
<p>And so now texas and florida they get to make choices california gets to make its choices and then we get to see</p>
<p>And political scientists are going to have a field day in five to ten years</p>
<p>And people are voting with their wallet today the ab test in real time</p>
<p>We have the largest economic migration in the history of this country</p>
<p>Occurring right now</p>
<p>And gavin newsom and lorena gonzalez. They&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>Be held accountable</p>
<p>For the conditions in san francisco for the decisions with respect to companies leaving the state people leaving the state and frankly</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about lower taxes</p>
<p>I would contend the even bigger issue</p>
<p>Is the contempt for capitalism?</p>
<p>The contempt for entrepreneurialism and innovation that exists in california, and I have no intention to leave</p>
<p>But I will tell you this like i&rsquo;m going to fight like hell</p>
<p>for a third way</p>
<p>Right that actually says capitalism can be a force for good in california</p>
<p>Um, and that&rsquo;s why sax needs to run</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>I love I love this idea of a state-by-state ab test. I mean, what was the old line?</p>
<p>I get it was it was fdr&rsquo;s line that uh, or federalism is the laboratory the states of the laboratory of democracy</p>
<p>Yeah, so I want to show this I just posted um a link in the chat of covid death rates, uh in the us by state</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really remarkable because every state has very has we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of very different covid policies. Um by state</p>
<p>What we see is that california and florida have almost the same death rate. I think california is like</p>
<p>154 per 10 000 and florida is like 159. It&rsquo;s a very very small gap</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Despite the fact that california has had the longest and most severe lockdowns in the country and calif and florida</p>
<p>Has been the most open and then meanwhile you look at states like um, like michigan</p>
<p>Which has also had very severe lockdowns and has had a much higher death rate</p>
<p>And so you see that there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s really no correlation</p>
<p>Between uh death rates for covid per capita and the the severity of of lockdowns</p>
<p>Basically, the data shows that lockdowns don&rsquo;t have an impact on a state&rsquo;s success in battling</p>
<p>Covid and you know, it&rsquo;s just remarkable that we still are despite this data</p>
<p>Despite the fact that you know, science is now showing us</p>
<p>We still have</p>
<p>Lockdowns in the state of california. We&rsquo;ve loosened up a little bit, but we&rsquo;re still talking about orange tiers</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just and i&rsquo;m here in florida right now. They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s open</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s open and you know florida has a lot more old people than california</p>
<p>And the death rate is just about the same as california</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just remarkable to me that we are stuck in in this mentality</p>
<p>of lockdown and I think it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>Newsom has bought into this savior myth that he has I think he&rsquo;s remembering</p>
<p>All this press that he and cuomo got at the beginning of covid about what great</p>
<p>Saviors they were and how they protected the population from from covid, but it&rsquo;s also been compounded by federal failure because the cdc</p>
<p>basically said</p>
<p>Or not said they revealed themselves to be incompetent, you know, the same person that we all thought was an incredible genius fauci</p>
<p>Increasingly looks like somewhat of a an idiot</p>
<p>And you know not completely informed on the topics that he should be informed about and then you know</p>
<p>You have these federal agencies. So for example when you put the cdc and the fda together</p>
<p>Some of their decisions are just complete head scratchers. Like for example this past week, you know the fda</p>
<p>Stopped the use of the johnson and johnson vaccine because seven women</p>
<p>Between the ages of 18 and 48 got a blood clot and one passed away</p>
<p>And if you think of over 7 million doses</p>
<p>Right and so a million what it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s literally one in seven million</p>
<p>million</p>
<p>Actually here&rsquo;s the crazy thing about that more people died in car accidents on the way to getting those</p>
<p>Vaccinations and actually died from a blood clot and so more than lightning strikes</p>
<p>or lightning</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s bad risk assessment, but it&rsquo;s also been very bad pr for for the vaccine</p>
<p>So in the wake of that the with the polling on vaccines went down by like 15 points</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re scaring people away from getting vaccines</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that polling was just on j and j or whether it applies to other vaccines as well</p>
<p>But the most important thing that the health officials could do is just convince people to get vaccinated</p>
<p>And the decision they made on rolling back j and j has really hurt that and then also this</p>
<p>You know that the falchi comments that even if you&rsquo;re vaccinated</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go to movies. You can&rsquo;t go to sporting events. You still have to wear a mask</p>
<p>You still can&rsquo;t you know get together in groups or indoor spaces. Well, then why would you get vaccinated?</p>
<p>Why would you take that chance that is so critical friedberg?</p>
<p>Do you think if you get a vaccine you should be allowed to take the mask off like that could be a reward look?</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a bigger question than the science question, right?</p>
<p>But um, I certainly don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s any risk to you or people around you</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve been vaccinated with respect to you&rsquo;re wearing a mask</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>You know this the the mask mandate</p>
<p>I think as you guys pointed out is a little bit more kind of political and social posturing</p>
<p>Uh than it is kind of you know, scientifically reducing the the the spread of the of the virus once you&rsquo;ve been vaccinated</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve been vaccinated you&rsquo;re in the clear</p>
<p>Theoretically can do what you want to do</p>
<p>Of course, so I mean let&rsquo;s just be really clear once you get vaccinated. There&rsquo;s no reason to wear a mask</p>
<p>Remember the reason for the mask mandates was source control, right? That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s right to prevent other people from getting the virus</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re not carrying the virus and you&rsquo;re not emitting the virus</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need for you to wear a mask and to and to and to insist</p>
<p>That people wear a mask after they&rsquo;ve been vaccinated is performatively</p>
<p>Anti-vax because you&rsquo;re sending the message that the vaccines can&rsquo;t be trusted</p>
<p>You agree with that freeberg, yeah, it&rsquo;s a fair point. I totally I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a really fair point and um,</p>
<p>Uh, and you know the the the whole counter argument to that which is counterfactual</p>
<p>Is you know, hey, you know, you can still transmit the virus</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that you can&rsquo;t transmit the virus, but you know, you could theoretically say that about anything. We know</p>
<p>Deterministically, uh, we don&rsquo;t have empirical evidence that we can say statistically. Here&rsquo;s how likely you are to transmit the virus</p>
<p>But we know deterministically this is the process by which a vaccine works</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be having replicating virus viral loads in your body</p>
<p>Therefore you&rsquo;re not going to have a high viral load coming out of your nasal passage of your mouth</p>
<p>therefore</p>
<p>You know, and this is the case with all these kind of vaccines like the flu</p>
<p>we you know, you shouldn&rsquo;t be or be needing to wear a mask so like</p>
<p>Um, you know totally make sense</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the upper bound friedberg of the number of people that are that are going to get vaccinated in the u.s</p>
<p>Are we going to get to 60 percent? I think 60 percent probably</p>
<p>Yeah, I would guess 60 60 65 percent. I mean because remember what percent of uh, people are under 60 and 20 percent</p>
<p>I think is that right? Yeah. Yeah, I think we&rsquo;ve really we&rsquo;ve really we&rsquo;ve really botched this</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve totally botched this vaccine rollout</p>
<p>I will tell you because of the the upper bound being where it is</p>
<p>I I still think we&rsquo;ll end up at a point where we&rsquo;re going to have a lot of people. Um,</p>
<p>That are going to be immune because they already had covid coupled with the vaccine</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have extremely low numbers</p>
<p>But the reality is the numbers are not going to get to zero and we talked about zeroism a couple podcasts ago</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re not going to get to zero. I think this is a really important thing to remember</p>
<p>The way that we&rsquo;ve tuned ourselves to react to covid</p>
<p>It was initially remember it was initially about you know, minimize the surge</p>
<p>And by minimizing the surge we will keep the health care system from being overwhelmed</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;ve transitioned into the</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t let covid spread but as we&rsquo;ve seen the reality is cannot stop covid from spreading no matter how many lockdowns you put in</p>
<p>Place societally people still get together in their homes and they&rsquo;ll give each other covid</p>
<p>And because some number of people will continue to have covid we are going to have covid in the united states for years to come</p>
<p>It is not going to go to zero</p>
<p>And the question we have to ask ourselves is how are we going to allow ourselves to operate?</p>
<p>How are we going to live our lives?</p>
<p>If the covid risk is non-zero and it will always be non-zero</p>
<p>And by the way, the measles risk is non-zero. The chickenpox risk is non-zero. There are already non-zero</p>
<p>Um, you know transmissible, um infectious diseases out there that have some degree of fatality rate to them</p>
<p>But um, I think the biggest thing we should all be concerned about is this notion that we are like shifting into a new normal</p>
<p>That will last for many years because we will never be at zero</p>
<p>So can I i&rsquo;m moving out of california if that&rsquo;s the case i&rsquo;m literally going to texas there will be mutinies</p>
<p>There will be mutinies. I&rsquo;m done. I got my vaccine. I&rsquo;m people people that nobody&rsquo;s gonna stand for that</p>
<p>Um, we already see it, you know chesky went on cnbc this morning and you know, basically said</p>
<p>You know, they are battening down all the hatches because there&rsquo;s no like the demand for travel</p>
<p>Is literally going to blow the roof off the building totally right like people people are over it</p>
<p>Too smart people make risk reward decisions in their personal lives every day</p>
<p>And if the government tries to lock them down, they&rsquo;re going to tear down the gates like it&rsquo;s not going to happen</p>
<p>but what what you&rsquo;re saying though is that what the implicit thing about what you&rsquo;re saying, which is scary is unlike times before about</p>
<p>measles or chickenpox</p>
<p>You we now are basically debasing</p>
<p>The credibility that these government institutions have about anything they say that&rsquo;s the real enemy in the room when this is all said and done</p>
<p>So now you have people that are acting on their own</p>
<p>So the cdc says you can&rsquo;t fill the middle seat the airlines say no go fuck yourself</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to fill whatever seat we want and nobody&rsquo;s going to complain back to what brad said because they&rsquo;re risk underwriting for themselves</p>
<p>And saying yeah, wait, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about anymore. And so where does it leave us?</p>
<p>Is that a good thing or a bad thing? You know, one of the ways states</p>
<p>Even democracies maintain power was information control</p>
<p>Right, right and there is no information control today anywhere</p>
<p>In fact, we have frictionless information, which means that by definition, I think there&rsquo;s greater chance for decentralization</p>
<p>I mean remember, you know the arab spring governments were overthrown on the basis of twitter, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe we live in a hobbesian state</p>
<p>You know of suffering in in the natural order of things, right?</p>
<p>but I certainly believe that government has a role to play to help organize us and</p>
<p>Uh, you know because there are big issues that we face in the future and you know, I just hope we can find a balance</p>
<p>uh, you know, uh</p>
<p>in the path forward, but this I I think chamat, this is a um an inoculation I think to bad institutions if you look at</p>
<p>People who spent two hundred fifty thousand dollars going into debt at some big expensive college</p>
<p>These young folks are saying i&rsquo;m not going to do that anymore</p>
<p>Now those colleges have to react and change and now we&rsquo;re seeing it with the teachers</p>
<p>This but I think jason it&rsquo;s actually more extreme than that like</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re learning that institutions aren&rsquo;t reliable number one</p>
<p>And then the second is that we&rsquo;re learning that those institutions are static. So meaning like today</p>
<p>There is I think that there&rsquo;s a lot there&rsquo;s a big case to be made</p>
<p>That the cdc doesn&rsquo;t really know what they were doing</p>
<p>And that in some cases the fda</p>
<p>Has been a little overreactive. Okay</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>What can we do about these things?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we can have a new cdc that we all create and believe in or a new fda</p>
<p>These are the laws of the government those laws won&rsquo;t change because there&rsquo;s a bunch of incentives</p>
<p>For folks who are currently in power that oversee those things to remain that way. So now</p>
<p>You know exactly as sacks said on the whim of frankly, like, you know, maybe an overreaction</p>
<p>We pull vaccines off then we pull them back on then we pull them off</p>
<p>You know the reaction to the astrazeneca vaccine was kind of a little uh awe-inspiring, you know, oh, it&rsquo;s bad. No, it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s good. No, it&rsquo;s bad. Take it off. Take it on put it on</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s been a global reaction</p>
<p>So you add all of these things up. I think the takeaway is what freeberg said institutions are broken</p>
<p>Because the incentives of the people that run them are not aligned to the people that actually expect output from them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say two things to this</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important point one is institutions to me are like like like any living organism they want to grow</p>
<p>And so, you know every government wants to add laws spend more money grow its budget</p>
<p>Every company wants to have more power grow its top line</p>
<p>Even every university harvard&rsquo;s endowment wants to grow over time. It wants to do more research</p>
<p>It wants to have more classes. It wants to have the bigger campus every institution as a result is then</p>
<p>Trying to aggregate um more resources and more power and more authority</p>
<p>And so, you know then when you have these moments where the institution doesn&rsquo;t serve</p>
<p>The stakeholders that it is meant to serve you have this breakdown of trust in the institution and institutional fallout begins</p>
<p>Whether that&rsquo;s the financial system and the and the evolution towards decentralized finance and bitcoin and so on</p>
<p>Or the failure of government and the ignorance against laws and what the government is telling us to do and so on</p>
<p>or in companies</p>
<p>And so the big question for this century is going to be are we going to allow that to happen now?</p>
<p>I mentioned this a few pods ago. What i&rsquo;m most concerned about is the absolute</p>
<p>Alternative to an institution is a mob rule and a mob rule as we&rsquo;ve seen where you get cancel culture</p>
<p>and you get um, you know game stop going through the roof and and you get um,</p>
<p>trial before um before without a jury</p>
<p>Uh and and trial without a judge</p>
<p>Can be really ugly and can be really nasty</p>
<p>And so the original intention of many of these institutions</p>
<p>Was to create a system by which there are rules and values that we all ascribe to and those values go out the window</p>
<p>When those institutions fail, so the big the big challenge, you know, we as as a as a as humanity are going to face this century</p>
<p>Is this this this dichotomy between the failure of institutions and the need for institutions to constantly grow?</p>
<p>Versus the challenge of not having institutions with respect to how do we operate societally with mob rule?</p>
<p>Uh and distributed rule, um, and and it&rsquo;s going to be interesting to kind of see</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a lot of back and forths over the next couple of decades. I would imagine with respect to how do we make?</p>
<p>uh economic government and business, uh,</p>
<p>Decisions and how they play and whether institutions or kind of distributed decision making plays a role</p>
<p>Good segue here to your pal. Josh. Holly. Holly. Uh sacks. I never thought I would see the day that a republican</p>
<p>wanted to bust</p>
<p>All the big companies</p>
<p>But he says no acquisitions by companies with a market cap over 100 billion</p>
<p>Putting aside the fact that this wasn&rsquo;t elizabeth warren or bernie sanders proposing this this was your your bestie</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re josh. Holly sacks. Have you met him or donated to him? I haven&rsquo;t met him. I haven&rsquo;t met him</p>
<p>Um, I think the second question you make a little donation there to holly</p>
<p>Uh, maybe maybe one day we&rsquo;ll see, you know, we&rsquo;ll say okay. What do you think about this concept?</p>
<p>Uh two points. Okay. Number one. You&rsquo;re right that this is showing, you know, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a big political realignment underway</p>
<p>This legislation could have come from elizabeth warren or bernie sanders. I think they would have justified it in different ways</p>
<p>I think what holly&rsquo;s concerned about is a concentration</p>
<p>Of power by big tech companies who are then using that power to censor people</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of the impetus there</p>
<p>I think sanders and warren their impetus would be around more of a concentration of wealth and money</p>
<p>And the power that that creates so slightly different motivations, but I think they&rsquo;re probably on the same page here</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of this populist wildfire. That&rsquo;s uh, that&rsquo;s kind of burning in both parties</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s sort of the first observation is is</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of this new populist realignment of our politics</p>
<p>The second point i&rsquo;d make about this is that this legislation is is what I would call sort of performative</p>
<p>Legislating. I mean, I don&rsquo;t think this bill is a serious proposal to become law</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s too much of a sledgehammer. I think that you know, if the goal here is to try and rein in big tech</p>
<p>I think just banning, you know any acquisition by firms over 100 billion dollar market cap. It is way too much of a</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not you know, it&rsquo;s just not uh crafted enough. I mean, is there any merit to it?</p>
<p>And how would you change it sax? It would have tons of unintended consequences for you know, what we do</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve talked about this. Is it good for what we do though?</p>
<p>I mean if companies stop selling early if instagram and youtube stayed independent wouldn&rsquo;t this have been much better?</p>
<p>It was a blanket</p>
<p>It was a blanket statement that said any company can&rsquo;t do it if they were over 100 billion, right?</p>
<p>So brookshire hathaway&rsquo;s business boop done gone to zero, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s too much of a blunt instrument and and look even for us, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only you know, three, I guess two or three good outcomes, right? There&rsquo;s ipos direct listings or spats</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put them in a category of a company going secondary sales. Yeah, then there&rsquo;s m&amp;a</p>
<p>Okay, and then the third outcome is basically the company goes under it goes bankrupt, right?</p>
<p>So if you take m&amp;a off the table</p>
<p>you are basically denying a lot of attractive exits for</p>
<p>Risk capital and that&rsquo;s going to ultimately hurt the returns risk capital and lead to less of it</p>
<p>There are a lot of there are a lot of companies where you know founders create a technology that&rsquo;s valuable and interesting</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t monetize and it needs to be part of something larger</p>
<p>And if you deprive every I guess big company of being able to buy of r&amp;d acquisitions</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of crippling the economy for no reason</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it really addresses the issue that holly really wants to address which is censorship</p>
<p>So my point is I would find a different way to address it</p>
<p>I think that at the end of the day this legislation is not meant to become law. It&rsquo;s meant to</p>
<p>Make a statement</p>
<p>To be a warning to big tech and to get you know</p>
<p>And and holly&rsquo;s trying to appeal to a constituency on his side of the aisle and I think it&rsquo;s sort of it&rsquo;s disgusting</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s performative in that regard. I mean holly like he votes against the election</p>
<p>He comes out with this asinine solution to his censorship beef, you know</p>
<p>Like this is the problem the grand standing of these politicians on both sides</p>
<p>That aren&rsquo;t focused on like how do we make sure that everybody&rsquo;s participating in the ownership society?</p>
<p>How do we deal with you know, you know issues of diversity?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s so far removed</p>
<p>from actual pragmatic solutions to the real problems facing us that it just drives me insane and so</p>
<p>um, he will most certainly not be getting a donation from</p>
<p>From our household</p>
<p>And um, you know like but what I am going to invest aggressively in</p>
<p>Uh, you know and what I think we ought to be doing and I I hope chamath will take me up on this</p>
<p>Right. I don&rsquo;t want to go spend 10 million in washington to lobby them to create the invest america account</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s you and I put up the money. Let&rsquo;s incubate this. Let&rsquo;s hire a ceo</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s you know, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s put up 10 10 15 million bucks</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s distribute it to families 2 000 bucks at a pop. Let&rsquo;s build a proof of concept hire a great ceo</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we do and prove that it works</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s better. That&rsquo;s actually a more practical giving pledge than the giving pledge</p>
<p>Oh my god, what a great idea chamath</p>
<p>We should if we should just do that right now and basically name and shame everybody that doesn&rsquo;t want to contribute who&rsquo;s made money</p>
<p>Because the reality is</p>
<p>We all have been extraordinarily lucky. Yes, we&rsquo;ve worked hard, but frankly, you know, none of us deserve any of this</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been lucky and so whatever representative share that you could contribute and what it does it gives</p>
<p>You know a low-income person of color minority person in america</p>
<p>Somebody who&rsquo;s you know disadvantaged a two thousand dollar head start when they&rsquo;re born is a fucking amazing</p>
<p>We could raise a hundred million dollars in the next three months</p>
<p>because do you know the reason people people are like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to pay taxes because they don&rsquo;t believe government is going to use the money wisely</p>
<p>If we went out and told all these folks that we&rsquo;re going to use it to give two thousand dollars directly</p>
<p>Right to create a sense of ownership and participation in the american dream their little slice of tesla of walmart of amazon of google</p>
<p>Like the money will come in from all the folks that you mentioned and I would love to see this crew get on board</p>
<p>With that. Yeah, I think we could do it over the course of the next six months</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in let&rsquo;s do it the audience who doesn&rsquo;t understand what we&rsquo;re talking about. Imagine we put</p>
<p>A thousand dollars into a 401k or 2000 401k for an american</p>
<p>Every american born what would that look like when they&rsquo;re 65 years old?</p>
<p>And what if 500 of the 2000 was in a 529?</p>
<p>What would that look like when they&rsquo;re 18 years old and go to college?</p>
<p>So that was my little punch-up jamath is you know put half of it in retirement half</p>
<p>Education it turns out if you put your stimulus check on each of the last three stimulus checks into dogecoin</p>
<p>You would have three hundred thousand dollars. Okay</p>
<p>So there there may be there may be alternative investment accounts</p>
<p>All right. Listen, there&rsquo;s been another amazing. Sorry, just so you know the two thousand dollars by the time you&rsquo;re 65</p>
<p>At at eight percent, which is you know, if you just buy the s and ptf would be about three hundred thousand two hundred ninety</p>
<p>Seven thousand so more than enough to comfortably retire in style and if you were to put 500 of it into</p>
<p>An account for college, maybe you get 25k or something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not sure what it equals in 18 years</p>
<p>As buffett has talked about in snowball the behavioral economics are if you have savings you save more</p>
<p>Right. Well, this is about education. Yeah, people feel part of the system feel like they&rsquo;re part of the game</p>
<p>All right. Listen another amazing episode. Uh, thanks, man. Thanks for coming on. Thanks for coming on</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a nickname for brad</p>
<p>We never nickname king of spax. Oh, just kidding</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to hand the crown. Oh</p>
<p>I just want to be called king</p>
<p>Somebody pick me up and let&rsquo;s go have a guy&rsquo;s trip</p>
<p>What are we doing here guys?</p>
<p>Where are we going? I just want to say well since david is in miami</p>
<p>Since david&rsquo;s in miami. I&rsquo;m going to tell you guys that my favorite prime number has always been</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it means. What&rsquo;s the joke?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in miami</p>
<p>Best</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;re going to miami let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>Let me see you all next. I love you besties. Love you, brad. Love you, brad</p>
<p>Brad say love you to sax. See what happens. Good. Keep it up. Brad. Say love you to sax. See what happens</p>
<p>Love you sax back at you</p>
<p>Brain man david</p>
<p>And it said we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it love you queen of</p>
<p>Besties are gone</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going</p>
