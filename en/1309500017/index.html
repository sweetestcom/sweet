    <p>hi guys how are you today</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Syrian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup Monday</p>
<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>every Monday I sit down</p>
<p>I do my makeup and I talk about true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>if you like true crime</p>
<p>and you like no no no</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true crime</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say like true crime</p>
<p>because you shouldn&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>but you can be interested</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true crime</p>
<p>and you like makeup</p>
<p>I would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>today I&rsquo;m just gonna talk about this guy</p>
<p>named John List</p>
<p>have you heard of him</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re about to</p>
<p>and the guy is messed up</p>
<p>John List he was born in Bay City Michigan</p>
<p>his father whose name was also John List</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just call him Father</p>
<p>he was a devout Lutheran and a Sunday school teacher</p>
<p>John List the son</p>
<p>he also became the same thing as his father</p>
<p>so a devout Lutheran</p>
<p>and a Sunday school teacher</p>
<p>in 1943 he enlisted in the US Army</p>
<p>and served as a laboratory technician</p>
<p>during World War II</p>
<p>and then in 1946</p>
<p>he was discharged</p>
<p>and he enrolled at the University of Michigan</p>
<p>in Ann Arbor</p>
<p>and he earned his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in business</p>
<p>business as business administration</p>
<p>and then he got his master&rsquo;s degree in accounting</p>
<p>so this John List guy</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t caught on</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s pretty smart</p>
<p>he seems to be really good with numbers</p>
<p>he seems to be all there</p>
<p>for the most part</p>
<p>I mean we don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s going well</p>
<p>right wow cool</p>
<p>November of 1950</p>
<p>the Korean War escalated</p>
<p>and John was recalled to active military service</p>
<p>and then in Virginia</p>
<p>where he was stationed</p>
<p>he met Helen Morris Taylor</p>
<p>and she lived nearby</p>
<p>with her daughter Brenda</p>
<p>I guess the 2 of them just hit it off</p>
<p>they fancied each other</p>
<p>and then they started dating</p>
<p>not long after</p>
<p>they got married</p>
<p>on December first 1951</p>
<p>in Baltimore Maryland</p>
<p>and the family moved to Northern California</p>
<p>while a lot of moving huh</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s strange to me</p>
<p>cause this is a side note</p>
<p>so he strange to me</p>
<p>cause like I&rsquo;ve never really like</p>
<p>did did a big move at all in my life</p>
<p>maybe I should move more</p>
<p>cool story Bailey</p>
<p>wow so then in 1952</p>
<p>John List had completed his second tour in the Army</p>
<p>and he then started to work paper company</p>
<p>in Kalamazoo</p>
<p>which side note</p>
<p>I had no idea</p>
<p>Kalamazoo was a real place</p>
<p>oh my God Bailey</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so dumb</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna visit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>I need to learn</p>
<p>you guys anyways</p>
<p>so Kalamazoo</p>
<p>great awesome</p>
<p>love that so</p>
<p>while living in Kalamazoo</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where John List and his wife Helen</p>
<p>kind of settled in a little bit more</p>
<p>and they started a family</p>
<p>so they had</p>
<p>children in 1959</p>
<p>it seemed like the marriage was kind of going south</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reported that Helen she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>she was an alcoholic</p>
<p>she was becoming just very unstable</p>
<p>she was angry</p>
<p>she was jealous</p>
<p>and she seemed to just take a lot of her anger</p>
<p>out on John</p>
<p>okay so do you remember</p>
<p>I think said</p>
<p>Helen had a daughter already</p>
<p>before she got married to John</p>
<p>and her name was Brenda</p>
<p>so in 1960 Brenda married</p>
<p>and she ended up leaving the household</p>
<p>and the rest of the family</p>
<p>ended up moving to Rochester New York</p>
<p>John took a job with Xerox</p>
<p>a lot of moving</p>
<p>happening right</p>
<p>had a lot of different jobs</p>
<p>but it seems like really good jobs right</p>
<p>so then in 1965</p>
<p>he accepted a position</p>
<p>at a bank in Jersey City</p>
<p>so again he moved with his wife and children</p>
<p>and also john&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>moved in with him</p>
<p>but they moved into this Victorian mansion</p>
<p>called Breeze Knoll</p>
<p>this Victorian mansion</p>
<p>is so extra like wow</p>
<p>a 19 room Victorian mansion</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beautiful it&rsquo;s huge</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you would do</p>
<p>with 19 rooms</p>
<p>would love to know</p>
<p>so from the outside looking in</p>
<p>John seemed to be the perfect family man right</p>
<p>and as we all know here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all a lie</p>
<p>to his co workers and stuff</p>
<p>it seemed like he had this awesome life</p>
<p>awesome family</p>
<p>amazing house</p>
<p>but a lot of his co</p>
<p>workers would say that</p>
<p>he was aloof</p>
<p>I love that word aloof</p>
<p>that he was aloof cold man</p>
<p>and he had little to no friends</p>
<p>people would say that</p>
<p>John lacked social skills</p>
<p>and because of his</p>
<p>lack of social skills</p>
<p>it was the reason</p>
<p>as to why he jumped from job to job</p>
<p>because he actually was losing jobs</p>
<p>he was getting fired</p>
<p>a couple of times</p>
<p>he got like</p>
<p>a promotion</p>
<p>but it wouldn&rsquo;t last long</p>
<p>he just couldn&rsquo;t seem to like</p>
<p>talk to people</p>
<p>before everything went down</p>
<p>John would leave every day</p>
<p>to go to work</p>
<p>everyone thought</p>
<p>he was going to work</p>
<p>so John would</p>
<p>leave the house</p>
<p>and he would go to the</p>
<p>train station</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s as far as he would get</p>
<p>he would go to the train station</p>
<p>and then he would sit there</p>
<p>and he would</p>
<p>spend his day</p>
<p>reading the newspaper</p>
<p>really John had lost his job</p>
<p>instead of just telling his family</p>
<p>that he lost his job</p>
<p>he was just like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go to the</p>
<p>train station</p>
<p>just sit there all day</p>
<p>reading a newspaper</p>
<p>just reading</p>
<p>in general and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come home</p>
<p>at the end of the day</p>
<p>so they think</p>
<p>I was at work</p>
<p>great plan John was doing this for a while</p>
<p>and like the stress was just</p>
<p>building up</p>
<p>because bills are due</p>
<p>and who pays the bills</p>
<p>John everything falls on him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just getting more and more stressed about this</p>
<p>and being honest</p>
<p>is just way too hard for people</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>the mortgage</p>
<p>was behind on payment</p>
<p>and I mean then</p>
<p>John finds out</p>
<p>that the foreclosure process has begun</p>
<p>and John knew</p>
<p>he was about to be exposed</p>
<p>as a failure</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been lying</p>
<p>and he needed to figure out a plan</p>
<p>and boy did he</p>
<p>make a plan</p>
<p>callum a fucking zoo</p>
<p>so get this</p>
<p>you ready buckle</p>
<p>in kitty cats</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a wild ride</p>
<p>so on November</p>
<p>9th of 1971</p>
<p>the children had left</p>
<p>they had gone to</p>
<p>school Helen</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>is sitting in</p>
<p>out of the 19 rooms</p>
<p>I guess she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sitting in where</p>
<p>the breakfast room</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>you know she&rsquo;s sitting there</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s having her coffee</p>
<p>John came up behind her</p>
<p>and he shoots Helen</p>
<p>in the back of the head</p>
<p>once John knew</p>
<p>that indeed</p>
<p>his wife was dead</p>
<p>John headed up the</p>
<p>stairs to his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>alma who was 84</p>
<p>at the time</p>
<p>and she was living</p>
<p>they called it the attic</p>
<p>it was just like</p>
<p>the you know</p>
<p>the top room</p>
<p>of this mansion</p>
<p>her own little area</p>
<p>John heads up the</p>
<p>stairs to his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s room</p>
<p>he goes into her bedroom</p>
<p>and he shoots her</p>
<p>right above her</p>
<p>left eye now</p>
<p>by this time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>afternoon and</p>
<p>his daughter</p>
<p>Patricia who&rsquo;s 16</p>
<p>and his son</p>
<p>Frederick who is 12</p>
<p>they arrive home</p>
<p>from school</p>
<p>and you guessed it</p>
<p>John sadly shoots</p>
<p>both of his children</p>
<p>in the back of the head</p>
<p>no words now</p>
<p>at this point</p>
<p>John even later</p>
<p>will say that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for laughing</p>
<p>every episode</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a moment of just like</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>where I have to laugh</p>
<p>but here here</p>
<p>this so John</p>
<p>shoots his wife</p>
<p>his mom and his 2 kids so far</p>
<p>and after this</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like hmm</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of hungry</p>
<p>so he goes into</p>
<p>the kitchen</p>
<p>and he makes himself some lunch</p>
<p>and he eats this lunch</p>
<p>how you eat</p>
<p>lunch after</p>
<p>just murdering</p>
<p>your family</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>level of crazy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a level</p>
<p>of crazy that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>know what what</p>
<p>he made like</p>
<p>a Bologna sandwich</p>
<p>the hell are you doing</p>
<p>John no so once</p>
<p>John had finished his lunch</p>
<p>he then drove</p>
<p>to his bank</p>
<p>and he closed</p>
<p>both um like</p>
<p>his account</p>
<p>and his mother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bank account</p>
<p>he also went into his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s savings account</p>
<p>took out all of her money</p>
<p>then John headed</p>
<p>to Westfield</p>
<p>High School</p>
<p>and this is so sad</p>
<p>but he watched</p>
<p>his oldest son</p>
<p>John Junior</p>
<p>who was 15 at the time</p>
<p>but he watched him play</p>
<p>in a soccer</p>
<p>game yeah again</p>
<p>this is a special</p>
<p>kind of crazy</p>
<p>once his son</p>
<p>is done with</p>
<p>the soccer game</p>
<p>he drove home</p>
<p>with his son</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>driving home</p>
<p>like normal</p>
<p>and I guess</p>
<p>John is just</p>
<p>acting calm</p>
<p>cool collected</p>
<p>like nothing happened</p>
<p>which is oh</p>
<p>John Jr walks</p>
<p>into the house</p>
<p>and then sadly</p>
<p>John shot him</p>
<p>in the chest</p>
<p>and the face</p>
<p>John will later say that</p>
<p>he shot him</p>
<p>so many times</p>
<p>because this</p>
<p>young boy had</p>
<p>multiple shots</p>
<p>and the reason</p>
<p>that he shot him</p>
<p>so many times</p>
<p>was because he</p>
<p>tried to resist</p>
<p>and he tried to run away</p>
<p>and John just shot him</p>
<p>repeatedly until</p>
<p>he was sure</p>
<p>that the boy</p>
<p>was dead so</p>
<p>I guess this was</p>
<p>john&rsquo;s plan</p>
<p>now okay like</p>
<p>this is how sick</p>
<p>some people</p>
<p>are and how</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you guys this is</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s weird</p>
<p>like this is the stuff</p>
<p>that really just</p>
<p>gets my brain</p>
<p>so confused</p>
<p>and wrapped up</p>
<p>in all of this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what how why</p>
<p>what there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many questions</p>
<p>so then John calls the</p>
<p>kids school</p>
<p>and he tells them</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be away</p>
<p>for a while</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re gonna be absent</p>
<p>and not to worry</p>
<p>now John considered</p>
<p>himself a very</p>
<p>religious man</p>
<p>so after killing his</p>
<p>whole family</p>
<p>he then sits down</p>
<p>and he wrote</p>
<p>a 5 page letter</p>
<p>to his pastor</p>
<p>after committing</p>
<p>the murders</p>
<p>which was later</p>
<p>found on the desk</p>
<p>in his study</p>
<p>now on this 5</p>
<p>page letter</p>
<p>it was essentially</p>
<p>a confession</p>
<p>and he explained</p>
<p>he was attempting</p>
<p>to save his</p>
<p>family&rsquo;s souls</p>
<p>because then</p>
<p>it was the 1970s</p>
<p>and he believed</p>
<p>it became a</p>
<p>very sinful time</p>
<p>John said that</p>
<p>he believed</p>
<p>his family was</p>
<p>giving into temptation</p>
<p>especially because</p>
<p>his daughter</p>
<p>came forward to John</p>
<p>and his wife</p>
<p>and said that</p>
<p>she wanted to</p>
<p>become an actress</p>
<p>and John viewed that</p>
<p>occupation as corrupt</p>
<p>and linked to Satan</p>
<p>now side note</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>anyone to think</p>
<p>I am singling out</p>
<p>religion at all</p>
<p>and making it about that</p>
<p>whether you</p>
<p>agree or disagree</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not pointing</p>
<p>the finger at</p>
<p>at that at all</p>
<p>because I know that</p>
<p>there are a lot</p>
<p>of good people</p>
<p>who have good intentions</p>
<p>when it comes</p>
<p>to religion</p>
<p>and what they believe</p>
<p>in all that stuff</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not trying</p>
<p>to get into</p>
<p>that at all</p>
<p>because I know</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>tend to think that</p>
<p>I am trying to</p>
<p>point the finger</p>
<p>at religion</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>been the case</p>
<p>I just kind of</p>
<p>mention their life</p>
<p>being Lutheran was</p>
<p>like a big part</p>
<p>of this guy&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>and his reasoning was that</p>
<p>does that make</p>
<p>sense cause</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>a couple videos</p>
<p>where people are like</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>about the religion</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m not just</p>
<p>played a big role</p>
<p>in their life</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about their life</p>
<p>because again</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>good people</p>
<p>out there who are in</p>
<p>these churches</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>religion and</p>
<p>then there are</p>
<p>some bad seeds</p>
<p>who ruin it</p>
<p>for everybody</p>
<p>if you are Lutheran</p>
<p>I am not singling you</p>
<p>out and saying</p>
<p>your people</p>
<p>are bad at all</p>
<p>I truly believe</p>
<p>in my heart</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>good people</p>
<p>out there and</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>bad ones is what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting at</p>
<p>okay thank you</p>
<p>kalamazoo so</p>
<p>John then put the bodies</p>
<p>of his wife</p>
<p>and his children</p>
<p>in sleeping bags</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also read</p>
<p>that he put</p>
<p>them on top</p>
<p>of sleeping</p>
<p>bags regardless</p>
<p>sleeping bags</p>
<p>were involved</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>moved them all</p>
<p>to like the</p>
<p>floor of the</p>
<p>mansions ballroom</p>
<p>when you walk</p>
<p>into the front door</p>
<p>they were all</p>
<p>right there</p>
<p>based off of</p>
<p>photos I saw</p>
<p>but he moved them all</p>
<p>into the same room</p>
<p>the ballroom</p>
<p>he left his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s body upstairs</p>
<p>in the attic</p>
<p>where her room was at</p>
<p>I guess he gave up</p>
<p>trying to move</p>
<p>her downstairs</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m laughing</p>
<p>because of how</p>
<p>ridiculous this is</p>
<p>now he was doing this</p>
<p>all throughout the night</p>
<p>apparently I think</p>
<p>at some point</p>
<p>he went to bed</p>
<p>the next day</p>
<p>when he woke up</p>
<p>he decided he</p>
<p>needed to cut</p>
<p>his picture</p>
<p>out of all the</p>
<p>family portraits</p>
<p>in the house</p>
<p>when police</p>
<p>did show up</p>
<p>eventually one day</p>
<p>and they needed a photo</p>
<p>for the wanted</p>
<p>poster that</p>
<p>they were sure</p>
<p>gonna draw up</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a reference</p>
<p>as to what he</p>
<p>looked like</p>
<p>and who he was</p>
<p>so he went through</p>
<p>every single photo</p>
<p>in the house</p>
<p>the photo drawer</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>and he cut himself</p>
<p>out of every</p>
<p>single photo</p>
<p>after doing</p>
<p>that John then</p>
<p>turned down</p>
<p>the thermostat</p>
<p>in the house</p>
<p>so it was freezing</p>
<p>to preserve the</p>
<p>bodies and also</p>
<p>to prevent a</p>
<p>smell from happening</p>
<p>correct me if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wrong on that</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m pretty sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>turns up the radio</p>
<p>and then John just</p>
<p>banished it</p>
<p>took nearly a</p>
<p>month until</p>
<p>police were notified</p>
<p>and the murders</p>
<p>were discovered</p>
<p>it said this is</p>
<p>mainly because</p>
<p>the family really</p>
<p>stuck to themselves</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>socialize at all</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really talk</p>
<p>to neighbors</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have friends</p>
<p>no one went to go</p>
<p>check on them</p>
<p>you know and then</p>
<p>also John sent</p>
<p>letters to like</p>
<p>the children&rsquo;s</p>
<p>school stating</p>
<p>that the family</p>
<p>would be visiting</p>
<p>helen&rsquo;s mother</p>
<p>in North Carolina</p>
<p>for several weeks</p>
<p>and that the</p>
<p>kids weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be in</p>
<p>school he also</p>
<p>called the school</p>
<p>to let them know</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be in school</p>
<p>John had also</p>
<p>stopped the</p>
<p>mail delivery</p>
<p>newspapers and</p>
<p>milk deliveries</p>
<p>you see back</p>
<p>in the day milk</p>
<p>would be delivered</p>
<p>to your front</p>
<p>door wild times</p>
<p>John stopped</p>
<p>all of that</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s coming to the</p>
<p>house at all</p>
<p>now the neighbors</p>
<p>though they did</p>
<p>notice that</p>
<p>the mansion&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lights were on</p>
<p>day and night</p>
<p>like they never shut off</p>
<p>they also noticed</p>
<p>like there was</p>
<p>no movement</p>
<p>happening in the</p>
<p>house they could</p>
<p>hear the radio</p>
<p>they saw the lights</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>never saw people</p>
<p>coming in and out</p>
<p>they never saw</p>
<p>anything and</p>
<p>then finally</p>
<p>the neighbors</p>
<p>say that the</p>
<p>lights began</p>
<p>to burn out</p>
<p>one by one by</p>
<p>one so like</p>
<p>the upstairs</p>
<p>and downstairs</p>
<p>and like the</p>
<p>lights were</p>
<p>just going out</p>
<p>and once that happened</p>
<p>the neighbors finally</p>
<p>called the police</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good to have</p>
<p>nosy neighbors</p>
<p>you know so</p>
<p>the neighbors</p>
<p>called the police</p>
<p>and then the police</p>
<p>show up to the</p>
<p>house they knock</p>
<p>knock knock</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>getting any answer</p>
<p>they peek through</p>
<p>the window and</p>
<p>guess what they see</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>they see the</p>
<p>bodies laying</p>
<p>on the floor</p>
<p>so police go</p>
<p>into the home</p>
<p>and they find</p>
<p>all the bodies</p>
<p>in the ballroom</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>it took them</p>
<p>a while to find</p>
<p>the poor mother</p>
<p>all the way</p>
<p>upstairs but</p>
<p>they did find her</p>
<p>then the police</p>
<p>launched a nationwide</p>
<p>manhunt police</p>
<p>investigated</p>
<p>hundreds of</p>
<p>leads without</p>
<p>any success</p>
<p>all of the reliable</p>
<p>photographs</p>
<p>of John had</p>
<p>been destroyed</p>
<p>or cut out so</p>
<p>they really</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>have any idea</p>
<p>of what this</p>
<p>man could look</p>
<p>like and again</p>
<p>at this point</p>
<p>it had been</p>
<p>almost a month</p>
<p>so this John</p>
<p>guy he got a</p>
<p>pretty damn</p>
<p>good head start</p>
<p>police then</p>
<p>found the family</p>
<p>car and it was</p>
<p>parked at John F</p>
<p>Kennedy Airport</p>
<p>in New York</p>
<p>City so police</p>
<p>looked into</p>
<p>like did he</p>
<p>get a flight</p>
<p>did he get a</p>
<p>ticket they</p>
<p>could not find</p>
<p>any evidence</p>
<p>of John buying a</p>
<p>ticket aboard</p>
<p>that he boarded</p>
<p>a flight at all</p>
<p>so they think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a ruse</p>
<p>so it would take</p>
<p>18 years for</p>
<p>police to learn</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>to John 18 years</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>according to John</p>
<p>and later reports</p>
<p>it said that</p>
<p>John left his car</p>
<p>at the airport</p>
<p>so then John had</p>
<p>traveled by</p>
<p>train and bus</p>
<p>he had traveled by</p>
<p>train and bus</p>
<p>from New Jersey</p>
<p>to Michigan</p>
<p>and then to</p>
<p>Colorado so</p>
<p>then John settled</p>
<p>in Denver in</p>
<p>early 1972 and took</p>
<p>an accounting</p>
<p>job as Robert</p>
<p>Peter Clark</p>
<p>aka Bob which</p>
<p>the name of</p>
<p>one of his college</p>
<p>classmates was</p>
<p>Bob Clark so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>he took his</p>
<p>classmates name</p>
<p>and John would say</p>
<p>that it was</p>
<p>like his friend</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>interviewed</p>
<p>the friend the real</p>
<p>Robert Clark</p>
<p>and the friend was</p>
<p>like I have</p>
<p>no idea who</p>
<p>that is and</p>
<p>then while in</p>
<p>Denver he joined</p>
<p>another Lutheran</p>
<p>congregation</p>
<p>and he ran a</p>
<p>carpool for</p>
<p>the church members</p>
<p>at one of the</p>
<p>church gatherings</p>
<p>he met Dolores</p>
<p>Miller and he</p>
<p>married her</p>
<p>in 1985 she had</p>
<p>no idea about</p>
<p>his past life</p>
<p>but his real</p>
<p>name was John</p>
<p>and all that</p>
<p>February of</p>
<p>1988 the couple</p>
<p>then moved to</p>
<p>Midlo Thillion Virginia</p>
<p>I guess in every video</p>
<p>I should have like</p>
<p>word of the day</p>
<p>and have it be a word that I can&rsquo;t pronounce</p>
<p>or I mispronounce</p>
<p>because every video</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s all our teeth</p>
<p>anyways so the couple then moved to Virginia</p>
<p>where John and his new wife had lived</p>
<p>and John was now still using that same name Bob Clark</p>
<p>which is so weird because he must have had to like come</p>
<p>up with a bunch of paperwork</p>
<p>cause how was he getting these good jobs</p>
<p>and then he just kind of went back to working</p>
<p>as an accountant</p>
<p>so John may have like</p>
<p>lived the rest of his life and freedom</p>
<p>if it weren&rsquo;t for the TV show</p>
<p>america&rsquo;s Most Wanted</p>
<p>remember is that show still on</p>
<p>it should be because it was pretty damn helpful</p>
<p>because this show featured John</p>
<p>and the family killings</p>
<p>in May of 1989</p>
<p>on the show</p>
<p>they got a forensic sculptor</p>
<p>to create a head a bust</p>
<p>they say showing what John most likely looked like</p>
<p>now when america&rsquo;s Most Wanted</p>
<p>agreed to feature the John Les case</p>
<p>it was considered at the time</p>
<p>to be the oldest case on the program</p>
<p>John had been missing at that point for 18 years</p>
<p>so it was like</p>
<p>slim to no chance of them finding it</p>
<p>but hey it&rsquo;s worth a shock</p>
<p>and then they brought in the forensic artist</p>
<p>Frank Bender</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s the one who created the bust</p>
<p>what John List</p>
<p>would look like</p>
<p>to this day</p>
<p>so he made him look aged</p>
<p>frank Bender</p>
<p>he had great success in helping capture aging fugitives</p>
<p>he was the best of the best</p>
<p>now in order to create a bust of the aging John</p>
<p>Bender went</p>
<p>or he consulted with the forensic psychologist</p>
<p>in order to make a profile of of John</p>
<p>his sculpture showed John with like</p>
<p>a receding hairline</p>
<p>sagging jaws</p>
<p>and a pair of glasses</p>
<p>and Frank bender&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>was that John would use glasses to disguise himself</p>
<p>as someone more important than he was</p>
<p>which would be proven accurate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s nuts how good this guy is</p>
<p>like he was spot on</p>
<p>so the show airs</p>
<p>and in Denver Colorado</p>
<p>a couple was watching and saw the sculpture thing</p>
<p>when they saw it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>that looks way too similar to our old neighbor</p>
<p>their old neighbor was John</p>
<p>so when they saw this on the TV they were like</p>
<p>pretty sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our old neighbor</p>
<p>so then they called a hotline</p>
<p>that they leave on america&rsquo;s Most wanted</p>
<p>and they give a tip and with this tip</p>
<p>they were able to locate John</p>
<p>now when John was arrested</p>
<p>he was wearing the exact style of sunglasses</p>
<p>that sculpture forensic sculpture had envisioned</p>
<p>and he looked just like it</p>
<p>it was great</p>
<p>see on June 1st 1989</p>
<p>John was arrested at the Richmond accounting firm</p>
<p>after the Denver neighbor</p>
<p>viewed the america&rsquo;s Most Wanted broadcast</p>
<p>and John continued to stand by his fake name</p>
<p>that he was Bob Clark</p>
<p>and he insisted that they had the wrong guy</p>
<p>he stood by that for a solid month</p>
<p>you got the wrong guy</p>
<p>my name is Bob Clark</p>
<p>finally John was faced with the evidence that they have</p>
<p>which included a fingerprint match with john&rsquo;s</p>
<p>military records</p>
<p>and then of course</p>
<p>the evidence that they found at the crime scene</p>
<p>which was more fingerprints</p>
<p>and shoe prints and stuff like that</p>
<p>hairs DNA I mean</p>
<p>he lived there</p>
<p>on February 16th 1990</p>
<p>my door just like</p>
<p>closed on its own</p>
<p>oh my God anyways</p>
<p>on February 16th 1990</p>
<p>finally John confessed his true identity</p>
<p>he was taken a trial</p>
<p>and John testified</p>
<p>that he was faced with financial difficulties in 1971</p>
<p>after losing his job</p>
<p>now he didn&rsquo;t want to share this humiliating news</p>
<p>with his family</p>
<p>so he spent each workday at the train station</p>
<p>reading newspapers</p>
<p>until it was time to come home</p>
<p>he ended up taking</p>
<p>money from his mother&rsquo;s bank accounts</p>
<p>to avoid falling behind on his mortgage</p>
<p>which eventually</p>
<p>he just ran out of money in general</p>
<p>he goes on to say</p>
<p>that he was dealing with his wife&rsquo;s alcoholism</p>
<p>and he really just throws her under the bus</p>
<p>saying that</p>
<p>he was also dealing with her untreated syphilis</p>
<p>now this is what John says</p>
<p>by that time</p>
<p>her excessive alcohol consumption and the syphilis</p>
<p>had transformed her from an attractive young woman</p>
<p>to an unkempt</p>
<p>paranoid shut in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what John said</p>
<p>and he goes on to say that she would frequently</p>
<p>publicly belittle John</p>
<p>constantly telling him that his sex performance was</p>
<p>awful compared to her first husband</p>
<p>so John goes on to say that he killed his family</p>
<p>to spare them from the humiliation of losing their home</p>
<p>and because he hoped they would go to heaven</p>
<p>psychiatrists say that John never showed any remorse</p>
<p>he never cried</p>
<p>he never got upset</p>
<p>he never said sorry</p>
<p>later during the trial</p>
<p>it was confirmed that John suffered from obsessive</p>
<p>compulsive personality disorder</p>
<p>and it caused him to consider</p>
<p>only 2 solutions to his little predicament</p>
<p>he could either accept welfare</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t have a job and he was struggling</p>
<p>or he could kill his family</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no in between</p>
<p>John would go on to say</p>
<p>that welfare was an unacceptable option</p>
<p>because he and his family would be exposed to ridicule</p>
<p>he would be viewed as a failure</p>
<p>and accepting handouts violated his father&rsquo;s teaching</p>
<p>yeah well I think murder</p>
<p>would violate your father&rsquo;s teaching as well</p>
<p>but what do I know</p>
<p>so john&rsquo;s goes on to say</p>
<p>with a controlling</p>
<p>alcoholic wife</p>
<p>and a mother who was just constantly on his case</p>
<p>about everything</p>
<p>there was only so much he could handle</p>
<p>before he was driven to murder</p>
<p>so finally on October 12 1990</p>
<p>John was convicted of 5 counts of first degree murder</p>
<p>at his sentencing hearing</p>
<p>he denied direct responsibility for his actions</p>
<p>saying quote</p>
<p>I feel that because of my mental state at the time</p>
<p>I was unaccountable for</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>I ask all affected for their forgiveness</p>
<p>understanding and prayer</p>
<p>end quote jeez</p>
<p>the judge was unmoved by this</p>
<p>he imposed a sentence of 5 terms of life imprisonment</p>
<p>to be served consecutively</p>
<p>which was the maximum penalty at the time</p>
<p>in 2002 John did an interview with Connie Chang</p>
<p>where she at</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t do that anymore does she</p>
<p>and John was asked why he didn&rsquo;t commit suicide</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re gonna kill your whole family</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re embarrassed</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you just kill yourself too bro</p>
<p>John stated that he didn&rsquo;t want to take his own life</p>
<p>as it would forbid him from his entrance into heaven</p>
<p>where he hoped to reunite with his family</p>
<p>which I think is such a crock of shit answer</p>
<p>Because murder is gonna prevent you getting into heaven</p>
<p>come on John</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not thinking</p>
<p>finally March 21st 2008</p>
<p>John died of complications from pneumonia at age 82</p>
<p>while in custody</p>
<p>their old mansion is called Breeze Knoll</p>
<p>it was the home where the murders took place</p>
<p>it was destroyed by arson</p>
<p>on August 20th 1972</p>
<p>which was 10 months after the murders</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believed you know</p>
<p>once news got out that there were murders taken place</p>
<p>that somebody went and like</p>
<p>burned it down</p>
<p>which is honestly</p>
<p>probably for the better</p>
<p>you know which I found this really interesting</p>
<p>when I was reading this article</p>
<p>it was like destroyed</p>
<p>along with this home</p>
<p>was the ballroom</p>
<p>stained glass skylight</p>
<p>which was rumored to be a Tiffany original</p>
<p>which was worth at least 100 000</p>
<p>at the time</p>
<p>which today would be worth either about 1,000,000</p>
<p>or well over $1,000,000</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unfortunate that that happened</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s unfortunate</p>
<p>that the whole family died</p>
<p>in the house</p>
<p>like let the Tiffany</p>
<p>stained glass</p>
<p>skylight go</p>
<p>a new house was built on the same site in 1974</p>
<p>I wonder if they know what happened</p>
<p>so that is a story about John List</p>
<p>and the awful things that he did to his family</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s truly unfortunate that he got to live</p>
<p>18 years of his life out living</p>
<p>but at least they caught him</p>
<p>and he did go to prison</p>
<p>but the whole thing like that</p>
<p>still pisses me off</p>
<p>thank God for america&rsquo;s Most Wanted</p>
<p>it seems that a lot of men</p>
<p>not all men</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m not saying that</p>
<p>a handful of men</p>
<p>truly believe that</p>
<p>murder is easier than divorce</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s disgusting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so disturbing</p>
<p>that one&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>cause this guy</p>
<p>you would never guess</p>
<p>and I feel like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing we&rsquo;ve been learning here</p>
<p>on my Monday episodes</p>
<p>the killers</p>
<p>never look like a flipping killer</p>
<p>mmm anyways</p>
<p>I hope that you have a very good day today</p>
<p>please be safe out there</p>
<p>make good choices</p>
<p>other than that</p>
<p>I hope you have a wonderful day</p>
<p>did I say make good choices</p>
<p>make good choices</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be seeing you guys later bye</p>
