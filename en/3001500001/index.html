    <p>[Music]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling over there</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you [Music]</p>
<p>please welcome president digital experience Anil chakravarti</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>good morning everybody oh look at that that&rsquo;s awesome well welcome to Adobe</p>
<p>Summit everybody it&rsquo;s amazing opening video isn&rsquo;t it give a hand to our</p>
<p>creative team great video to set the stage</p>
<p>is wonderful it&rsquo;s really wonderful to be back in person here after four years in</p>
<p>Las Vegas it&rsquo;s awesome to feel the energy in this room all the leaders in</p>
<p>digital experience across Industries it&rsquo;s an amazing Community thank you</p>
<p>thank you a huge thank you from us on all of us at Adobe for being here today</p>
<p>and for the thousands of people joining us online really appreciate you joining</p>
<p>us and to be connecting with you it&rsquo;s all of you together that make Adobe</p>
<p>Summit their digital experience event of the year once again huge thank you to</p>
<p>all of you</p>
<p>now we have a great experience ahead over the next couple of days to provide</p>
<p>a peek into the future the opportunity to learn from each other to network and</p>
<p>to have some fun we&rsquo;ll be joined by leaders from some of</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s foremost brands as well as our own technical experts from Adobe and</p>
<p>our partners and I am certain that they will surprise and Delight you</p>
<p>will also obviously talk about our latest Innovations we have a lot of them</p>
<p>to share with you at this conference today all of these Innovations focused</p>
<p>on helping you succeed in what&rsquo;s really a very Dynamic Market environment</p>
<p>when we think of what&rsquo;s going on in the world today every company</p>
<p>is feeling the pressure to do more with less to quickly show value to customers</p>
<p>and to deliver the profitable growth that is a business imperative today</p>
<p>each one of us we are expected to drive Revenue growth while also taking keeping</p>
<p>a close eye on expenses to improve profitability</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s changing is we are navigating all of these business imperatives at a</p>
<p>time when there&rsquo;s a generational shift in consumer Behavior</p>
<p>consumers customers of every company expect that any company that they work</p>
<p>with will be digital first that everything that they do all those</p>
<p>digital experience will be intuitive to them</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not easy for you as marketers for all of us as marketers customer</p>
<p>experience but easy to address these imperatives</p>
<p>simultaneously but the brands that do that will build a</p>
<p>massive competitive advantage over the next few years</p>
<p>and on Adobe we help you with both we help you with Revenue growth we also</p>
<p>help you with cost efficiencies and you&rsquo;ll see a lot of Innovations today</p>
<p>that address both of those the biggest lever to drive profitable</p>
<p>growth is to address the end-to-end customer</p>
<p>experience when you are focused on profitable</p>
<p>growth every moment you need every moment and every experience with the</p>
<p>customer to work even harder for you and that&rsquo;s why all of them really need to be</p>
<p>connected and brands that are competing on the</p>
<p>basis of experience don&rsquo;t have to compete only on price it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very important for profitable growth and by focusing on experiences that are</p>
<p>fully digital or digitally enabled you&rsquo;ll be able to do more with less</p>
<p>now digital experience is not new every company has the basics of digital</p>
<p>experience in place whether it&rsquo;s digital marketing digital Commerce</p>
<p>but we really are the dawn of a new era one where digital marketing and digital</p>
<p>products are fully converging in the customer experience</p>
<p>which means that you must connect the complete customer experience across all</p>
<p>of your business areas whether it&rsquo;s marketing or product engagement or</p>
<p>stores and locations or sales or customer service all of those need to be</p>
<p>connected together to provide The Full Experience</p>
<p>and doing so will dramatically increase your ability to deliver a personalized</p>
<p>relevant experience across all the touch points in your</p>
<p>customers Journey now this ability to personalize at scale</p>
<p>has led to the new era which we call the era of experience-led growth</p>
<p>where you and your customers derive value from the entire experience Journey</p>
<p>means let growth is all about connecting customer experience across acquisition</p>
<p>engagement retention the entire chain across every touch point in the customer</p>
<p>Journey Adobe we believe we are a natural</p>
<p>partner to help you the profitable growth that comes from</p>
<p>great customer experiences our mission our</p>
<p>means the world to Regional experiences across all of our clouds</p>
<p>to speak more about that and to lay out our strategy and what we are doing to</p>
<p>create the future I have the pleasure of welcoming adobe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>chairman and CEO shantanu Narayan please join me giving a rousing welcome to</p>
<p>shantanur [Music]</p>
<p>thank you Anil good morning and welcome to Summit as he said it is so great to</p>
<p>be back in Las Vegas in person and thank you all so much for joining us here</p>
<p>today in December Adobe celebrated its 40th</p>
<p>anniversary and I was fortunate enough to go around</p>
<p>the world and meet with customers and employees and reflect on adobe&rsquo;s impact</p>
<p>as well as the Innovation that we&rsquo;ve provided to society</p>
<p>when you think about what Adobe has done from inventing desktop publishing</p>
<p>pioneering electronic documents advancing animation imaging video</p>
<p>creating and leading the digital marketing category enabling</p>
<p>collaboration so that we can have more stakeholders involved in the process</p>
<p>with workflows including workfront and frame IO as well as share for review in</p>
<p>our collaborative applications investing in a brand new real-time</p>
<p>customer data interaction platform and infrastructure with the Adobe experience</p>
<p>platform infusing Ai and now into our products as a co-pilot that</p>
<p>helps our customers work faster and smarter</p>
<p>and to most recently introducing task-based creativity with Adobe Express</p>
<p>across many surfaces including the web we have been thrilled to partner with</p>
<p>you to continuously deliver groundbreaking Innovation and expand our</p>
<p>aspirations to bring the best of adobe to an even broader set of customers</p>
<p>around the world purpose has really guided our Innovation</p>
<p>as well as impact over the past four decades</p>
<p>and today we think people more than ever want to engage with businesses and</p>
<p>companies that they can trust and whose values align with theirs</p>
<p>when we think about adobe&rsquo;s purpose the three that come to mind it first starts</p>
<p>with a commitment to have a workplace that reflects the diversity of the world</p>
<p>around us where everyone feels included respected</p>
<p>and has the opportunity to contribute and make an impact</p>
<p>as the creativity company we&rsquo;re uniquely committed to creativity for all</p>
<p>empowering millions of people around the world all ages all backgrounds to access</p>
<p>the tools skills as well as platforms that they need to express themselves and</p>
<p>reach their full potential and share their ideas</p>
<p>but we also take the impact of technology as seriously as the</p>
<p>development of the technology itself and we know that this is a growing area</p>
<p>of focus for all of you and we&rsquo;re so grateful for the trust that you have all</p>
<p>placed in US technology to transform Is our</p>
<p>commitment to advancing the responsible use of technology for the good of our</p>
<p>customers the good of our communities as well as the environment</p>
<p>and our Innovations are truly making an impact across security privacy trust</p>
<p>safety accessibility sustainability as well as AI ethics</p>
<p>in our AI ethics principles have always tried to ensure that our Innovations are</p>
<p>developed with accountability responsibility and transparency</p>
<p>as we reflect on our daily lives it is so clear that digital has and will</p>
<p>continue to reshape how we work how we learn and how we&rsquo;re entertained and this</p>
<p>is happening across every industry from Healthcare to retail to financial</p>
<p>services to education and we think at the core the creation</p>
<p>and consumption of these content and applications is exploding there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>insatiable appetite for dynamic content and applications</p>
<p>work is increasingly becoming hybrid and Global and people are finding new ways</p>
<p>to collaborate and creativity is redefining</p>
<p>productivity and whether it&rsquo;s a school project that you&rsquo;re working on or a</p>
<p>document that you&rsquo;re creating we think that creativity is increasingly more</p>
<p>essential to how everyone brainstorms as well as communicates their ideas</p>
<p>and as consumers we all expect today that the brands that we engage with know</p>
<p>us and they can deliver that personalized compelling experience that</p>
<p>we expect today&rsquo;s buzzwords of artificial</p>
<p>intelligence and machine learning are both powerful but they also require a</p>
<p>really thoughtful approach so that we can amplify and not re</p>
<p>replace the power of human ingenuity these Mass</p>
<p>Trends underscore how more now than ever</p>
<p>these rich and dynamic digital experiences are going to shape every</p>
<p>aspect of Our Lives so adobe&rsquo;s Mission as Anil said is to</p>
<p>change the world through digital experiences</p>
<p>and we want to empower everyone everywhere to imagine create and deliver</p>
<p>any digital experience the great digital experiences starts</p>
<p>with ideas that are developed through collaboration among all of us and</p>
<p>expressed through content and now more than ever creators need</p>
<p>these tools across all surfaces across all media types that give them the power</p>
<p>and precision and speed and ease to deliver the standout content that they</p>
<p>want across applications because every piece of content needs to</p>
<p>be delivered to the right person at the right time to drive that engagement and</p>
<p>value at Adobe we&rsquo;re focused on three massive</p>
<p>opportunities unleashing creativity for all accelerating document productivity</p>
<p>empowering digital businesses and we&rsquo;re focused on ensuring that all</p>
<p>of you can drive growth and profitability for your business to</p>
<p>achieve experience-led growth</p>
<p>as I reflect on the journey that we&rsquo;ve taken as a company over the past four</p>
<p>decades I think we&rsquo;ve always focused on how can</p>
<p>we focus on solving hard technology problems</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve tried to anticipate customer needs</p>
<p>and invest in the building blocks that are critical to transform the</p>
<p>experiences that you deliver across our customers end-to-end Journey with your</p>
<p>brands we started with content that was the</p>
<p>core of the company which I think continues to be a massive investment and</p>
<p>opportunity for every company because every digital experience starts</p>
<p>with content whether that&rsquo;s an image a video an animation a document a 3D</p>
<p>rendering and Adobe will continue to offer the</p>
<p>most comprehensive delightful and Powerful Suite of products to create any</p>
<p>piece of content but understanding how that content</p>
<p>performs is more critical than ever before to realizing the impact and</p>
<p>potential and so we expanded our aspirations and combined Art and Science</p>
<p>investing in analytics and pioneering the digital marketing category as we</p>
<p>know it today in Adobe experience Cloud thanks to all</p>
<p>of you has become the underpinning of every digital business</p>
<p>combining and analyzing trillions of transactions and data sets across all of</p>
<p>our applications when you have content and you have data</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re only a means to serve the customer so we then focused on customers</p>
<p>and how do you do the segmentation how do you acquire customers and how do you</p>
<p>bring to bear the world&rsquo;s best customer data platform</p>
<p>and build natively on the Adobe experience platform adobe&rsquo;s real-time</p>
<p>CDP today unifies customer data across online and offline channels to deliver</p>
<p>these truly personalized experiences at scale</p>
<p>thanks to all your adoption Adobe real-time CDP today delivers over 600</p>
<p>billion predictive insights every year based on customer profiles as all of you</p>
<p>as Brands create over 30 trillion audience activations every single day</p>
<p>with content data and the customer insights we now think it&rsquo;s time to</p>
<p>tackle the artificial distinction that still exists between products and</p>
<p>marketing because increasingly the customer</p>
<p>expectation is that you integrate product and marketing</p>
<p>and so understanding how people engage with and use products is incredibly</p>
<p>critical to marketing success and as a company we Embrace product-led</p>
<p>growth in both our Creative Cloud and our digital Cloud business document</p>
<p>Cloud business and so we&rsquo;re now trying to productize what we have learned all</p>
<p>the insights that we&rsquo;ve got to redefine the product analytics category and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to hear a lot more about it today helping you unify your customer</p>
<p>insights across both marketing as well as product</p>
<p>with content and data combined with these customer insights and with product</p>
<p>insights we all recognize that it&rsquo;s also time to</p>
<p>scale how do we think about artificial intelligence and an area where machines</p>
<p>can really Excel and we&rsquo;ve been at the Forefront of this</p>
<p>with what we have referred to as Adobe Sensei infusing intelligence into all of</p>
<p>our products with features like neural filters for Photoshop</p>
<p>attribution AI in the Adobe experience Cloud as well as liquid mode in Acrobat</p>
<p>REI Innovations have actually won US technical achievement Oscars in imaging</p>
<p>and video and most recently 3D and we&rsquo;re now trying to build the Decades of data</p>
<p>and experience we have and creativity and documents to extend that in a deep</p>
<p>and very meaningful and thoughtful way in generative AI</p>
<p>our belief is that generative AI will accentuate human ingenuity</p>
<p>as a co-pilot and not replace it</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re excited to announce a number of product announcements today in</p>
<p>generative AI technologies that we think will redefine both creativity as well as</p>
<p>the customer experience it&rsquo;s an area that we know is evolving very quickly</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;d like to do is actually invite Anil to join me back on stage</p>
<p>along with the president of our digital media business David wadwani to talk</p>
<p>about the opportunities and the innovations that we&rsquo;re bringing to</p>
<p>Market David [Music]</p>
<p>foreign [Music]</p>
<p>so I think we all agreed David Arnold that generative AI is going to bring</p>
<p>about this incredible new innovation and we have a number of announcements so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get into it David absolutely um so for those of you who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what generative AI is I think it&rsquo;s probably good to just make sure we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>level set generative AI allows you to describe what you want in your own words</p>
<p>and the computer will effectively visualize and generate content to match</p>
<p>those words in fact all the imagery that you&rsquo;ve been seeing uh behind me shortly</p>
<p>all of that is generated with generative AI today we&rsquo;re announcing the beta of</p>
<p>something called Adobe Firefly Firefly is a family of adobe owned</p>
<p>generative models specifically created for Content generation for Creative</p>
<p>output the first model has been trained on hundreds of millions of stock content</p>
<p>from Adobe stock and open licensed content and it&rsquo;s built from the ground</p>
<p>up to be deeply integrated into application and content workflows really</p>
<p>becoming your creative co-pilot as you go and do and build all of your</p>
<p>marketing content we&rsquo;re starting with the generation of images and text</p>
<p>effects and again all of this imagery you see here was created with a text</p>
<p>prompt not with uh with a deep creative tooling and in the coming weeks vectors</p>
<p>and in painting and out painting and video and a lot more 3D content is in</p>
<p>the pipeline you&rsquo;ll start to see us creating and generating that kind of</p>
<p>content as well it&rsquo;s a very long journey from where we are to where we know we</p>
<p>can get and so as doing this as a beta we&rsquo;re inviting all of you to go sign up</p>
<p>for that beta and participate give us feedback along the way but one of the</p>
<p>most exciting applications of generative Ai and Firefly is really in the context</p>
<p>of DX and what all of you can do as marketers</p>
<p>perfect thank you David So in experience Cloud we are integrating with firefly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously the best model for creating content and we&rsquo;re integrating</p>
<p>Firefly directly into the experience Cloud starting with the Adobe experience</p>
<p>manager where you&rsquo;ll be able to generate content that&rsquo;s safe for commercial use</p>
<p>so for example if you&rsquo;re a retailer you had a photo shoot you have the content</p>
<p>in Adobe experience manager assets you can then generate essentially</p>
<p>endless variations based on colors textures Etc and use them in e-commerce</p>
<p>and other applications and with new Innovations in the Adobe</p>
<p>experience manager you&rsquo;ll have powerful insights that will then help you on</p>
<p>which attributes which variations are resonating with your customers you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>actually see that in a demo later this morning</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the integration with firefly we&rsquo;re also announcing a family of Sensei</p>
<p>General AI Services where marketers and customer experience practitioners will</p>
<p>have a co-pilot to help increase your productivity without increasing your</p>
<p>workload will literally start with use cases without natively integrated like</p>
<p>marketing copy generation conversational experiences audience creation Journey</p>
<p>creation as well as caption generation and in real we anticipate that over time</p>
<p>generative AI will really help us reimagine every aspect of marketing</p>
<p>as we said we have all of this data as well as the history of our creative</p>
<p>tools but maybe we can touch a little bit uh David and Arnel on what&rsquo;s unique</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s differentiated about the Adobe Solutions absolutely this has been</p>
<p>an area that we&rsquo;ve been very focused if for those of you who who followed Adobe</p>
<p>and and shot new mentioned this earlier we&rsquo;ve been doing AI in our creative</p>
<p>products for well over a decade and what we&rsquo;re really excited about this moment</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re taking generative AI which is able to create great content but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re putting it together as part of a model Pipeline with our decade of</p>
<p>innovation around imaging video Vector 3D and more and the combination is going</p>
<p>to create some absolutely stunning output</p>
<p>the second area that we&rsquo;ve been very focused on is that we&rsquo;ve trained all of</p>
<p>this content in these models so that the output is safe for commercial use</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of conversation around generative AI as it relates to copyright</p>
<p>as it relates to diversity and inclusion as it relates to the potential to create</p>
<p>harmful content and we wanted to make sure that we were taking all of those</p>
<p>difficult problems in addressing them early in the process and making it safe</p>
<p>for commercial use means that we can go from leveraging generative AI for for</p>
<p>fun and individual projects to leveraging it for commercial use so this</p>
<p>becomes something that is really focused on making it available to all of you</p>
<p>the third area was around integrating with our applications and workflows now</p>
<p>I already talked about this but Creative Cloud document Cloud digital experience</p>
<p>uh and uh and Adobe Express which you&rsquo;ll be learning more about later today all</p>
<p>of these capabilities are all these platforms can now leverage generative Ai</p>
<p>and Firefly directly embedded into their existing experiences</p>
<p>and last but certainly not least it&rsquo;s really about being Creator Centric at</p>
<p>Adobe uh we have introduced something called</p>
<p>the content authenticity initiative a few years ago we now have over 900</p>
<p>organizations that are part of that or uh that initiative and content</p>
<p>credentials is at the Forefront of of everything that we we want the creative</p>
<p>Community to do we want people to get credit for what they create so with</p>
<p>generative AI we&rsquo;re going to make sure that all content created from Firefly is</p>
<p>marked as AI generated content so people know what the origin of that content is</p>
<p>the second thing is we&rsquo;re going to also announce the availability of a do not</p>
<p>train tag so if creative professionals want to create content that they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want Firefly to train on they can simply embed that tag in the content and last</p>
<p>but certainly not least we recognize that all of this training content is</p>
<p>really provided to us from contributors to Adobe stock so as Firefly goes into a</p>
<p>commercial State we&rsquo;ll be announcing a lot more about how we&rsquo;re planning on</p>
<p>sharing the success of that and uh and making sure that contributors get</p>
<p>compensated for their efforts and on the</p>
<p>awesome</p>
<p>on the experience Cloud side I want to pick up on what David said about</p>
<p>integrated workflows that is what makes it really unique both with firefly as</p>
<p>well as the Sensei gen AI Services native integration into the apps that</p>
<p>you use every day whether it&rsquo;s Adobe experience manager or Marketo or</p>
<p>analytics it&rsquo;ll be natively integrated that that is what makes it much more</p>
<p>efficient much more productive rather than having to use a third-party service</p>
<p>where you are essentially integrating between the apps you use every day and</p>
<p>these third-party services the other key differentiator is when it</p>
<p>comes to large language models for text we will work with the best in the</p>
<p>industry and make that available with conversational experiences so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what is really unique about what we are doing with the experience cloud</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re certainly building all of this technology in partnership with a number</p>
<p>of other companies you mentioned large language models so maybe we touch a</p>
<p>little bit on the ecosystem and Anil I&rsquo;ll start with you here right now I</p>
<p>mean who are we partnering with on this endeavor for Content obviously David is</p>
<p>our primary partner Firefly we believe is the best in the industry we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to Crypt for Creative content we&rsquo;re really going to integrate with Firefly</p>
<p>on the large language model side we&rsquo;re working with several of them Microsoft</p>
<p>Azure open AI is one of them that you will see with uh later in this</p>
<p>conference with Marketo in the conversational experiences with Dynamic</p>
<p>chat we&rsquo;re working with flan T5 on the analytics side so we&rsquo;re going to bring</p>
<p>the best of what is in the industry in large language models into the Adobe</p>
<p>experience Cloud yeah and on the creative and document side we are very</p>
<p>excited about what&rsquo;s happening in the space there&rsquo;s so much research being</p>
<p>published every day by others and us but we&rsquo;ve been very focused on the initial</p>
<p>set of Partners so uh we&rsquo;re announcing today a deep partnership with Nvidia now</p>
<p>Nvidia has been a long-standing partner with Adobe around creative for for a</p>
<p>long long time and together we&rsquo;re going to co-develop the next generation of</p>
<p>generative experiences what does this mean this means that between the two</p>
<p>companies we have every part of the technology stack end to end in a way</p>
<p>that nothing can that gets in the way in terms of our imagination our research</p>
<p>and our implementation from the chip to the cloud to the models and to the</p>
<p>applications that all of you use the two companies really have that entire stack</p>
<p>so there are no constraints in terms of the Innovation that we can do the second</p>
<p>one is our long-standing partnership with Microsoft and now Microsoft and</p>
<p>open AI we&rsquo;re very excited about the work that they&rsquo;re doing and we want to</p>
<p>integrate their conversational interfaces with chat GPT and Bing</p>
<p>directly into all of our experiences and because this is such a dynamic</p>
<p>environment we&rsquo;re also making sure that Firefly apis are available for</p>
<p>third-party developers that want to embed what we&rsquo;re doing in their</p>
<p>workflows and their automated process so we&rsquo;re very excited about the</p>
<p>Partnerships we&rsquo;re announcing and the platform to announce even more in the</p>
<p>coming years and we can&rsquo;t wait to embrace embark on this journey with all</p>
<p>of you so how do they all get access when do we deliver this well some of</p>
<p>these Solutions are already in beta you will see a demo later today in a couple</p>
<p>of demos actually and then more sessions at the conference and for Firefly you</p>
<p>can have access today the Firefly beta is available at adobe.com Firefly uh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to be gradually letting people in over the coming weeks so</p>
<p>please go sign up play around with it and give us your feedback</p>
<p>well thank you Arnold and David for sharing everything that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>thank you again all for joining us at Summit enjoy your summit we can&rsquo;t wait</p>
<p>to see what you do with our products and with that we&rsquo;ll hand it back over to you</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll thank you thank you shantanu thank you David</p>
<p>[Applause] [Music]</p>
<p>[Applause] speak a lot more about</p>
<p>AI throughout our demos today and in the super sessions and we have a great panel</p>
<p>discussion tomorrow uh with Amit Angel bamry and Eli Greenfield our CTO digital</p>
<p>media as part of the day two Keynote okay</p>
<p>when you think about generally where I AI along with content and data is</p>
<p>clearly becoming foundational to build experience-led growth</p>
<p>and in order to drive those growth from experiences you need a strategy to</p>
<p>connect and optimize the complete customer experience Journey</p>
<p>keeping the send customer at the center of not only your marketing but all your</p>
<p>channels of Engagement across the entire chain which is custom</p>
<p>a customer acquisition engagement and retention</p>
<p>now when you look at adobe&rsquo;s own business as shantanu talked about this</p>
<p>is something we&rsquo;ve really been focused on to power adobe&rsquo;s own transformation</p>
<p>and our own business for the last several years</p>
<p>Adobe has gone through multiple transformations to become one of the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s leading digital businesses a couple of core principles of these</p>
<p>transformations connecting that complete customer</p>
<p>experience across these areas investing in multiple modes of growth</p>
<p>marketing-led growth product-led growth and obviously a lot of Technology</p>
<p>Innovation over the last 40 years that shantanu talked about</p>
<p>we are taking all of that experience and the</p>
<p>bringing that to you so that you can apply it to your own business and to</p>
<p>drive experience-led growth so how does this work</p>
<p>you have to think of this in an integrated manner across acquisition</p>
<p>engagement retention typically people think of it as a funnel but actually as</p>
<p>you drive the next generation of experience let growth it&rsquo;s really much</p>
<p>more iterative and agile today in most companies you have a</p>
<p>variety of disconnected systems and processes</p>
<p>but the magic really starts to happen when your channels and customers and</p>
<p>touch points when all of those are connected that engagement leads to</p>
<p>experience-led growth and the entire customer journey is</p>
<p>becoming increasingly digital when you think of customer acquisition</p>
<p>for example a lot of the investment today in your marketing investments in</p>
<p>your ad spend is going into digital but you need to ensure that those</p>
<p>Investments are more efficient and more productive than ever before</p>
<p>so that brings me speaking of AD spend to our first big new announcement of a</p>
<p>product announcement of the conference which is the Adobe mix modeler</p>
<p>there it is okay so uh if you think about where your ad spend is going</p>
<p>efficiency is more critical than ever and in a world without third party</p>
<p>cookies or third-party cookies going away with wall Gardens becoming more</p>
<p>common your job of integrating these are efficiently spending your ad dollars is</p>
<p>harder than ever a lot of companies have manual processes</p>
<p>spreadsheets disconnected systems today I&rsquo;m happy to announce that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>introducing a new product the Adobe mix model that will change all of that</p>
<p>with mixed modeler powered by Adobe Sensei marketers have the ability to</p>
<p>measure plan Monitor and adjust their marketing campaigns all within a single</p>
<p>app now you can leverage data from Adobe</p>
<p>customer Journey analytics and mix model will deliver faster and more consistent</p>
<p>insights so that you can optimize the return on your marketing investment</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s across your paid channels your own channels or your own channels</p>
<p>when you think</p>
<p>about digital products and web apps and marketing or increasingly merging into a</p>
<p>connected experience which means that product teams are</p>
<p>playing a vital role in shaping the customer experiences working with</p>
<p>marketing to align go to market and engagement strategies</p>
<p>so as a brand you need to have Insight on product performance in a way that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>integrated across your entire customer Journey</p>
<p>once again Adobe is here for you</p>
<p>today I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce Adobe product Analytics</p>
<p>thank you product Analytics</p>
<p>is purpose-built to provide the insights you need to deliver highly optimized</p>
<p>digital experiences to power product-led growth</p>
<p>and because it&rsquo;s built on the Adobe experience platform</p>
<p>you can be confident that these insights are integrated across all parts of the</p>
<p>customer Journey this empowers product teams to play a</p>
<p>larger role in the overall customer experience</p>
<p>and because product analytics is a self-service solution for product</p>
<p>managers for data scientists you can reduce ad hoc requests to data analysts</p>
<p>saving countless hours of effort and quickly and easily unlock insights on</p>
<p>patterns and changes in customer engagement over time</p>
<p>which will also help you identify growth trends that you see that are noteworthy</p>
<p>across your cohorts</p>
<p>using product analytics surface friction within the product experience enabling</p>
<p>timely changes iterative changes to your current offerings and making</p>
<p>improvements to your roadmap in a continuous manner</p>
<p>this product-led growth is huge in advancing customer engagement and</p>
<p>retention which are the critical elements of</p>
<p>experience-led growth and there&rsquo;s a great demo coming up later in the</p>
<p>keynote showing you this new product analytics offering</p>
<p>experience lead growth is just as relevant in B2B as in b2c use cases</p>
<p>if you think of the modern B2B Journey it spans more channels than ever</p>
<p>and in bit away the way Brands and customers interact has also changed</p>
<p>dramatically buyers now expect to conduct their</p>
<p>research digitally and they want to engage with companies on their terms at</p>
<p>the time that they want to do it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in your account there are many different roles decision makers</p>
<p>buyers influencers in B2B accounts so to respond to these changes B2B</p>
<p>leaders are increasingly driving experience-led growth with a tiered</p>
<p>account strategy for top accounts it&rsquo;s a high touch with</p>
<p>digital enablement and for the long tailor customers it&rsquo;s through chat and</p>
<p>self-service and all the Investments we have made work as well with B2B as they</p>
<p>do with b2c</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s bring all of this to life with a real world example</p>
<p>in the pharmaceutical industry Eli Lilly has been a great leader and has an</p>
<p>amazing vision of experience-led growth for its consumers patients Healthcare</p>
<p>Providers and business customers so let&rsquo;s hear more about that and for</p>
<p>that please join me in welcoming shantanu back in conversation with Dave</p>
<p>Riggs the chairman and CEO of Eli Lilly Dave</p>

<p>[Music] [Applause]</p>
<p>[Music] well Dave first welcome to Adobe Summit</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my pleasure to welcome okay you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>[Laughter] to welcome Dave Riggs the chairman and</p>
<p>CEO of Eli Lilly to Adobe Summit a lilly veteran for more than 25 years</p>

<p>communities around the world helping over 50 million people manage illnesses</p>
<p>like diabetes cancer migraine and autoimmune conditions in the last year</p>
<p>alone his vision to develop a growing</p>
<p>portfolio of Best in Class and first in class pharmaceutical and digital</p>

<p>and more personally I&rsquo;ve had the benefit of having Dave&rsquo;s wisdom as he has served</p>
<p>on the Adobe board for more than five years so welcome Dave and thank you for</p>
<p>joining us at Summit great to be with you today fantastic</p>
<p>well we we started to talk about purpose Dave and I know you&rsquo;re very passionate</p>
<p>about Lily&rsquo;s purpose so maybe we&rsquo;ll start with you know talk to us about</p>
<p>Lily&rsquo;s purpose and why that&rsquo;s so meaningful and appealing yeah well you</p>
<p>know our company will celebrate it&rsquo;s a 147th birthday next month and back to</p>
<p>those early days the company was founded on three simple principles use science</p>
<p>to advance medicine make sure what&rsquo;s in the product is always the same this was</p>
<p>in the days of snake oil salesman but really product quality and then</p>
<p>Integrity in our communication because Healthcare is no place to deceive</p>
<p>customers or whatever so those principals live today of course our</p>
<p>tools have changed dramatically how we create new medicines with science which</p>
<p>is you know really incredible these days Quality Systems and production are very</p>
<p>complicated and your company&rsquo;s helping us with the communication with with</p>
<p>customers but every day you know we wake up and we know why we come to work which</p>
<p>is those 51 million people who count on us to live a better day a better life</p>
<p>extend their life in some cases save their life and so that&rsquo;s important work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a job at Lilly it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s a passion</p>
<p>so tell me a little bit you mentioned 147 years uh you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>celebrating how do you keep the spirit of innovation uh alive in a company for</p>
<p>140 years yeah it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an incredible uh tale and an old American company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kept going and going we&rsquo;ve never merged we&rsquo;re not on the back end of a</p>
<p>hyphen it&rsquo;s the same entity and I think the pride our employees have to solve</p>
<p>problems for patients is the top driver we spend a lot of time listening to</p>
<p>patients and every time we do people leave with a</p>
<p>bounce in their step and they&rsquo;re excited to run back to the lab or to their desk</p>
<p>or to the factory and say let&rsquo;s do this a little better today because as humans</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t help but relate to the challenges people face with health</p>
<p>probably many of you know or or have struggle with that yourselves in this</p>
<p>room and we have a chance to use science and technology to to Aid um Aid people</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s such a driver for us newer is really the advancements in</p>
<p>science which are allowing us to open up so many more opportunities to address</p>
<p>diseases we never thought could be conquered before maybe starting with the</p>
<p>the sequencing of the human genome about 20 years ago unlocked what we call</p>
<p>Target space places where we can make new matter chemicals molecules proteins</p>
<p>that can augment disease and solve problems like you know Alzheimer&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a leading company and hope to have some data here even in the next couple</p>
<p>months on a breakthrough there where it&rsquo;s the only cause of death in America</p>
<p>without a cure or something that even slows it down that&rsquo;s what we get up for</p>
<p>and the possibility to do that across many tough diseases is just expanding</p>
<p>every day so those things drive us and get us excited about innovating for</p>
<p>patients well I&rsquo;d love to spend more time and we will on digital and the</p>
<p>pandemic and the impact but maybe maybe a little bit first on on your personal</p>
<p>Journey as well Dave I know you&rsquo;ve been there for 25 years you&rsquo;ve played</p>
<p>multiple roles marketing and now clearly running the company just a little bit</p>
<p>maybe about your background and you know how how that evolved during your 25</p>
<p>years at Lilly yeah well you know it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve been at the company a long time as</p>
<p>you have at Adobe which has real benefits to really learn the business</p>
<p>and grow within it learn the culture but it&rsquo;s an accidental success story because</p>
<p>I joined the company thinking I&rsquo;d be there two years when I started my wife</p>
<p>was in med school in Indiana and I needed a job in Indiana so I joined Lily</p>
<p>but what I found when I got there was a company filled with really smart and</p>
<p>talented people we talked about purpose and why we come to work that that</p>
<p>infected me in a way I didn&rsquo;t predict and then Lily is also a company that</p>
<p>believes in growing from within talent and the company put me in jobs I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>qualified to do but you have to learn to do and that that drives a lot of growth</p>
<p>I had a chance to work internationally which I really cherished to this day as</p>
<p>a global head of a company um in China in Canada and really learn</p>
<p>you know how Healthcare Works outside this country which is quite different</p>
<p>and then in development and other parts of operation so really exceptional</p>
<p>um kind of accidental career path in a way</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve learned through time to really understand at its core what we do is so</p>
<p>important for CEOs and leaders um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not about how it looks it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whether you can run a complicated organization really effectively whether</p>
<p>it be the bench scientists what happens in our plants or how our sales teams are</p>
<p>out working with customers to solve problems that&rsquo;s what I love to do yeah I</p>
<p>think the whole aspect of transforming ourselves every few years as individuals</p>
<p>also is is what keeps us vibrant but you know switching to the pandemic I mean I</p>
<p>would say that Healthcare was probably perceived as the industry due to</p>
<p>regulatory concerns that hadn&rsquo;t embraced digital maybe touch a little on how the</p>
<p>pandemic changed that and how you think about digital and Healthcare moving</p>
<p>forward yeah of course everything changed during the pandemic to be more</p>
<p>digital and online and accelerated your business a lot of people here were</p>
<p>involved in that but Healthcare probably was one of the lowest starting points</p>
<p>there was almost nothing happening [Music]</p>
<p>um whether it be industry to a customer to Consumer to Physicians or B2B I mean</p>
<p>it was very in-person shoe leather kind of business</p>
<p>um and mass marketing was how we talked to Consumers that changed quite a bit</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a reason it started so poorly which hasn&rsquo;t shifted as fast as</p>
<p>we wanted we have to keep investing one is the regulatory nature you mentioned</p>
<p>so we need HIPAA compliance and privacy and personal information critical the</p>
<p>second is the fragmentation of the market so the transaction itself</p>
<p>requires a consumer a doctor to permit them to use the product they want to use</p>
<p>and then a payer like an insurance company to offset some of that cost all</p>
<p>three have to agree and synchronizing that is pretty complicated task</p>
<p>digitally we have to create that environment still and then the third is</p>
<p>technology is really underdeveloped in healthcare there&rsquo;s just a huge Tech debt</p>
<p>in hospitals doctors offices even in Pharma companies so that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>accelerating now we went from almost no for instance Telehealth visits for</p>
<p>senior primary care doctor to I think 85 percent in that first quarter after in</p>
<p>in Q2 of 2020. it&rsquo;s back down again but starting to grow</p>
<p>um and I think that&rsquo;s a function of uh forcing it and then people learning how</p>
<p>to use it appropriately and we have a similar thing going on and how Pharma</p>
<p>talks to doctors and consumers is we had a surge now I think we&rsquo;re learning how</p>
<p>to use channels and and speak to our customers better</p>
<p>what would you think of Lily you certainly think of this massive</p>
<p>innovation in science that you mentioned how do you think about marketing and</p>
<p>especially as a B2B company I mean you know what&rsquo;s the role of marketing and</p>
<p>digital in marketing I mean it&rsquo;s a key role in some ways it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the thing we</p>
<p>often forget to talk about um but we do four things I think the</p>
<p>world hires us to do four things really well create a new substance that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist before that could augment a disease prove its value in clinical</p>
<p>trials make it at scale and safely with good</p>
<p>quality and then share the benefits so it can be appropriately integrated into</p>
<p>clinical practice and to people&rsquo;s lives to solve their health problems that last</p>
<p>bit is the marketing piece which is how do we communicate and not over</p>
<p>sensationalize on the one hand but on the other hand really change a very</p>
<p>um kind of system with a lot of inertia which is Healthcare there&rsquo;s been studies</p>
<p>of how long it takes for a doctor to adopt a new practice the average in</p>
<p>America is 17 years for a new practice to be adopted in the</p>
<p>market now fortunately drugs are better because we have good marketing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seven or eight years but that&rsquo;s still way too slow and I</p>
<p>think using digital technology to talk to more people with more compelling</p>
<p>messages in the channel they want to hear it from can really help us speed up</p>
<p>that and when you think about it it&rsquo;s not just revenue for Lily or a good</p>
<p>launch it&rsquo;s better health for millions of people</p>
<p>um so you know we we think of marketing as you know key the key Last Leg of that</p>
<p>relay race to deliver the value we get hired to create</p>
<p>when I was sharing with you some of the AI announcements you were making you</p>
<p>were talking about your eyes lit up and you were talking about Ai and the impact</p>
<p>and science maybe you can share with the audience uh how AI is going to impact</p>
<p>Pharma yeah well it feels like a generational moment doesn&rsquo;t it with</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening with generative AI we&rsquo;re using Ai and I think you know an</p>
<p>important way and hope to use it in the marketing sphere coming up uh more</p>
<p>robustly but we are using it to discover new molecules and our challenge is we</p>
<p>have a huge number of possible molecules in the chemical Universe I think it&rsquo;s 10</p>
<p>to the 33. yet we&rsquo;ve only met large enough that&rsquo;s a large number yeah we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>only made ourselves six million compounds in the history of the company</p>
<p>now fortunately someone a couple decades ago was smart enough to annotate and tag</p>
<p>and make a rich data set around those molecules</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve created our own AI engine to learn against those molecules and it</p>
<p>really helps our chemists just as you were saying with the creatives you know</p>
<p>as an aide to help them get started in their work so they throw a new Target at</p>
<p>it with and say what are the potential field of new chemistry we should explore</p>
<p>to look at this and it comes it&rsquo;s interesting to a person it comes up with</p>
<p>some very orthogonal uh different ideas that the human mind does not and then</p>
<p>our scientists we find those ideas and test them and then weed out the best</p>
<p>ones so far pretty compelling results just in a couple years of work so I have</p>
<p>no doubt in 10 years this will be how every drug gets discovered not replacing</p>
<p>people with computers or chemists with computers but rather aiding them and</p>
<p>speeding up that process and so you hear a lot about personalized medicine as</p>
<p>well maybe you can touch on does this actually Usher in the era of</p>
<p>personalized medicine or how does that evolve it won&rsquo;t hurt</p>
<p>um of course personally medicine is kind of a spectrum of things when we use that</p>
<p>phrase on the extreme side you can think of okay I have a I have testing done in</p>
<p>my body and I get a very specific n of one medicine for me</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re probably pretty far from that in many cases except some rare what we call</p>
<p>monogenic or single Gene driven diseases and that&rsquo;s already happening with Gene</p>
<p>therapies right now so there&rsquo;s Gene therapies that can cure childhood</p>
<p>blindness we&rsquo;re working on one for certain specific forms of childhood</p>
<p>deafness right where you could actually cure that in a newborn infant but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still pretty nascent I think we can also think about personalized medicines as</p>
<p>ways to more specifically get medicines that are that are for diseases for</p>
<p>people like you right so we we segment in a way the driver of the disease and</p>
<p>then give a medicine you see that in cancer these days more and more what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the qual therapy you qualify for based on the type of cancer you have and then</p>
<p>we can get a better effect with less side effects so that&rsquo;s another form of</p>
<p>it and I think AI can help both those problems both in the search for</p>
<p>solutions for those really customized medicines but also in population Health</p>
<p>helping the doctors sort what the right pathway is for a patient with a certain</p>
<p>biologic fingerprint disruption I think a lot of the</p>
<p>companies in this room are facing disruption and we touched on you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>a clear Undisputed leader in diabetes and insulin for decades how do you think</p>
<p>about you know generational shifts in technology or disrupting yourself yeah</p>
<p>well in our business um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s an interesting business</p>
<p>because we have we don&rsquo;t have forever products we have patent Express which</p>
<p>are by policy as it&rsquo;s been put together basically in 12 13 14 years every single</p>
<p>bit of Revenue we have today will go to zero</p>
<p>and so we wake up driven by patients but we also wake up driven by our own</p>
<p>extinction because we could make a super profitable Financial Enterprise on the</p>
<p>products we have today and not invest in the Next Generation and in exactly 13 or</p>
<p>14 years we won&rsquo;t be a company so we have to wake up every day and think</p>
<p>about 13 or 14 years from now what will replace or even grow can we increase the</p>
<p>replacement rate so we can actually grow off this base</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve worked hard to compress the product introduction cycle from idea at</p>
<p>the at the lab bench clinical testing making it at scale and then introducing</p>
<p>it and now I&rsquo;m really focused on actually compressing the time to Peak</p>
<p>sales so that again the revenue comes forward and and we can all imagine if</p>
<p>you can you can introduce more products than you lose patent on and you can grow</p>
<p>them faster than the ones they replaced that&rsquo;s a recipe for really exponential</p>
<p>growth and in a way we&rsquo;re replacing ourselves all the time and so</p>
<p>transforming culture I mean culture is such an important part of that and you</p>
<p>know as Leaders when you have this idea of what you want to change I what tips</p>
<p>do you have for the folks here about how you transform and accelerate as you</p>
<p>pointed out culture yeah it&rsquo;s key Challenge and you know I</p>
<p>think in any big company you face this as well you have to always be on that</p>
<p>topic first of all which is um change is coming whether you see it</p>
<p>or not and um I think it was Bill Gates who said we</p>
<p>typically overestimate the change in front of us and underestimate the one we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s just around the corner so I think again that&rsquo;s a reinvention sort of</p>
<p>self-cannibalization idea taking the best of what got you here really the</p>
<p>values of the company the core things you know how to do better than anyone</p>
<p>else but then asking what&rsquo;s next that will give us a Competitive Edge I really</p>
<p>appreciate what you&rsquo;ve done and I thank you so much for all the Innovation well</p>
<p>great to be here as a board member and a customer and a partner thank you thank</p>
<p>you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>foreign [Music]</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>thank you Dave so great to have you here it&rsquo;s a life-changing industry really</p>
<p>appreciate everything that you do and for the Insight you shared here really</p>
<p>appreciate it okay</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s keep going let&rsquo;s go into the next level of how Adobe is powering</p>
<p>experience-led growth in the Enterprise</p>
<p>ation David shantro talked about this a bit personalization at scale is crucial</p>
<p>to deliver experience-led growth meaning delivering relevant experiences in real</p>
<p>time for every customer on every channel both online and offline</p>
<p>we it will be we help you achieve this through five foundational principles</p>
<p>first through a unified customer profile by helping you develop a deeper</p>
<p>understanding of your customer at the foundation of any customer</p>
<p>experience when you take all the consumers and what they are doing</p>
<p>customers are constantly re-evaluating so their products and services</p>
<p>engagement and it&rsquo;s imperative to show how customers that you understand their</p>
<p>needs which means you&rsquo;ll take the idea of it a typical 360 degree customer View</p>
<p>and make that more multi-dimensional it&rsquo;s not enough to know how your</p>
<p>customer responds and reacts to marketing activities across channels you</p>
<p>also need to understand how they interact with digital products like we</p>
<p>were talking about earlier as well as interactions with sales or with call</p>
<p>centers or in person or in stores all of that comes together with the</p>
<p>customer profile that combines your first party data with partner data and</p>
<p>any enrichment that you have from outside data and bringing that together</p>
<p>with a common identity for the customer which may also be powered with data from</p>
<p>third-party identity providers</p>
<p>second</p>
<p>in real time and to do that you have to ingest</p>
<p>customer Behavior combine everything you know about them and then activate those</p>
<p>insights by assembling and delivering the best experience within milliseconds</p>
<p>we do that with real-time activation typically within 250 milliseconds</p>
<p>third key principle delivering deep integration across your customer</p>
<p>experience technology which means integration with your existing</p>
<p>architecture with your existing multech Investments and across your stack and if</p>
<p>these are not integrated you&rsquo;re not going to get that real-time performance</p>
<p>four Best in Class applications that provide comprehensive abilities</p>
<p>self-service capabilities for marketers customer experience practitioners to</p>
<p>personalize at scale and so without that democratization of data and content and</p>
<p>those experiences you can&rsquo;t personalize at the scale required</p>
<p>and finally built-in trust and data governance so that when you have the</p>
<p>customers data you can respect their privacy their preferences and you meet</p>
<p>the regulatory commitment that you have in your industry</p>
<p>when you add up all of these five principles that is what is required in a</p>
<p>customer data platform to take your data Foundation to the next level</p>
<p>and when we started building Adobe experience platform five years ago this</p>
<p>was exactly what we were solving for with our vision at Adobe</p>
<p>we launched the experience Adobe experience platform it&rsquo;s a real time</p>
<p>Cloud scale platform on which we and many of our partners who are in the room</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve really built a vibrant and growing ecosystem</p>
<p>we have delivered Market leading applications we took the market leading</p>
<p>applications we already had integrated them with the platform and we have</p>
<p>natively built new applications that run on top of the Adobe experience platform</p>
<p>and these cut across four key categories marketing planning and workflow content</p>
<p>and commerce</p>
<p>Data Insights and audiences and customer Journeys</p>
<p>through the experience platform and our entire experience Cloud portfolio we</p>
<p>have really provided a tightly integrated foundation for experience</p>
<p>toilet growth and to do so at scale</p>
<p>santro talked about the production the statistics that we now have for the</p>
<p>Adobe experience platform we have over 210 billion Edge Network calls per day</p>
<p>over 600 billion predictive insights were each year</p>
<p>as well as nearly 30 trillion segment evaluations per day that is what we are</p>
<p>seeing in production with Adobe experience platform and our native apps</p>
<p>every day</p>
<p>now let me cover the three key applications native applications we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>built on top of the Adobe experience platform</p>
<p>first real-time CDP which is key to this momentum Brands large and small across</p>
<p>Industries or using Adobe real-time CDP to generate customer profiles that</p>
<p>update in real time as they get signals from their online and offline channels</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re using that to activate personalized campaigns across their</p>
<p>channels and driving growth Adobe real-time CDP is the only CDP</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s natively connected in real time and at massive scale and we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>staying still we&rsquo;re continuing to invest in areas like data collaboration</p>
<p>customer acquisition identity and AI</p>
<p>I talked about the value of deep integration</p>
<p>in addition to building these natively integrated apps on the Ruby experience</p>
<p>platform we are creating seamless Integrations between our platform and</p>
<p>our apps across the experience Cloud for example Commerce we are the first in</p>
<p>Industry to natively connect Adobe Commerce into the platform to drive</p>
<p>experience driven Commerce so if you have a new segment that you generate</p>
<p>within the Adobe Within rtcdp you can use that to power and provide</p>
<p>personalized campaigns and promotions through the Commerce application</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve also integrated on other</p>
<p>directly into the Adobe experience platform</p>
<p>and we have opened it up to Partners so that you get the full benefit of an</p>
<p>ecosystem we now have over 450 Partners integrated into the Adobe experience</p>
<p>platform and through shared services in the</p>
<p>experience platform that power these applications you can effectively go from</p>
<p>collecting a customer signal to taking action and Gathering insights in</p>
<p>milliseconds that is really unique in the industry</p>
<p>our second key analytics again a native app built on</p>
<p>the Adobe experience platform customer Journey analytics connects data</p>
<p>across every channel That Matters to your customers whether it&rsquo;s web or</p>
<p>mobile and as we discussed earlier with new with digital products helps you with</p>
<p>end-to-end visualization and AI driven insights</p>
<p>when you take those insights and Lead that to activation that needs to be</p>
<p>seamless that is really where the Adobe Journey</p>
<p>Optimizer comes in when it comes to experience delivery we</p>
<p>are redefining the market with Adobe Journey optimizer</p>
<p>we launched it last year and it&rsquo;s really been a rocket ship it&rsquo;s the next gen</p>
<p>application for Omni Channel personalized campaigns all in one</p>
<p>product so it helps you run experiments and make</p>
<p>decisions in real time at scale so you can take insights from the</p>
<p>customer Journey analytics publish audiences to the journey Optimizer</p>
<p>activate them and then take the earnings and complete the loop</p>
<p>now this is something that would take multiple systems and you would have to</p>
<p>stitch all of that together instead you get to do it all through one platform</p>
<p>the Adobe experience platform so I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground here but</p>
<p>the best thing to do is to show it all through a demo so that you can see how</p>
<p>all of this works together let me invite for that to Jen Lasser to</p>
<p>take you through a great demo Jen thank you Anil</p>
<p>everyone is becoming hungrier and hungrier for data as they work to</p>
<p>deliver better customer experiences I&rsquo;m so excited to show you how our Adobe</p>
<p>experience Cloud applications Empower Brands to deliver experience-led growth</p>
<p>and enable seamless collaboration from product to marketing to analytics and</p>
<p>Beyond today we&rsquo;re going to take a look at how</p>
<p>Cadillac approaches driver upgrades to their super Cruise autonomous driving</p>
<p>subscription I want to take a moment and thank</p>
<p>General Motors for letting us use their brand to tell this story today and</p>
<p>remind everyone that the data you see here is fictitious to maintain our</p>
<p>customers privacy are you ready to see what I have for you</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll buckle up Let&rsquo;s Take a Ride</p>
<p>the first stop on our trip is in customer Journey analytics our analytics</p>
<p>application built on Adobe experience platform it&rsquo;s here that marketers and</p>
<p>analysts love to analyze their omnichannel data in analysis workspace</p>
<p>well I am thrilled to announce that all of that same Rich omnichannel data is</p>
<p>now available in Adobe product Analytics product teams need to be able to ask and</p>
<p>answer questions of the user experiences they&rsquo;re building and they need to take</p>
<p>the full context of the customer journey into consideration when doing so</p>
<p>and I have to tell you as a product manager myself I do not have time to be</p>
<p>writing SQL who who has time for that I mean really</p>
<p>this new experience introduces guided analyzes that have been tailored for the</p>
<p>jobs that must be done by product owners like myself</p>
<p>you can see some of them here Trends user growth funnel and even more to come</p>
<p>now I often need to assess my monthly active users to determine if my</p>
<p>product&rsquo;s user base is growing so user growth looks like a great place to start</p>
<p>I instantly learn more about my product and my users from this View and notice</p>
<p>my hands were up the entire time this purpose-built experience is doing</p>
<p>all of the heavy lifting for my most critical business questions</p>
<p>some might even say it&rsquo;s doing all the driving for me</p>
<p>from this view I can see if I&rsquo;m getting new users if they&rsquo;re being retained or</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re falling dormant and because Adobe uses an event-based</p>
<p>model for data ingestion I can easily filter to a more critical product event</p>
<p>in my journey let&rsquo;s say those users that use the</p>
<p>navigation panel in the Cadillac lyric now this looks great but if I want to</p>
<p>look at it at a weekly level and set a monthly no problem</p>
<p>now it looks like users of the navigation panel are being retained</p>
<p>really well so this presents a great opportunity of qualified leads that we</p>
<p>can Target with upgrade messaging to the super Cruise subscription</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go ahead and select this audience and make it available for activation</p>
<p>the native connectivity of the Adobe experience Cloud enables me to activate</p>
<p>this audience in both real-time CDP and journey optimizer</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that easy no Integrations no match rates no delays</p>
<p>now it looks like we have a recommendation here from Adobe Sensei</p>
<p>gen AI so let&rsquo;s take a look the first suggestion is to increase the</p>
<p>size of our audience based on Partner data from real-time CDP</p>
<p>that partner data by the way includes new Partnerships with live ramp Merkel</p>
<p>Epsilon and more this sounds like a great idea because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to expand the reach of any campaign or experiment that we target</p>
<p>towards this audience so let&rsquo;s go ahead and apply those</p>
<p>changes that was really easy to navigate</p>
<p>now I want to test some personalized upgrade messaging next to my audience so</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to shift gears into my new experimentation home</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s here that I can see all of the experiments that I&rsquo;m running across my</p>
<p>activation channels we&rsquo;ll go ahead and jump into the upgrade</p>
<p>subscription experiment I set up earlier and we can Target it to that audience</p>
<p>that we just identified</p>
<p>we can also test several unique variants of messages to see which one resonates</p>
<p>the best with our audience let&rsquo;s go ahead and activate this</p>
<p>experiment and then we&rsquo;ll move over to Adobe Journey Optimizer to set up a</p>
<p>journey for our users with journey Optimizer I can orchestrate</p>
<p>a cross-channel journey that reaches our audience no matter how they interact</p>
<p>with Cadillac inbound or outbound</p>
<p>the results of our experiment will also continually inform this journey so that</p>
<p>the right content is served on the right Channel at the right time pretty clutch</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>you guys are getting you guys are picking them up now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s bring this full circle into Adobe product analytics to analyze the impact</p>
<p>of our experiment on super Cruise subscriptions</p>
<p>because Adobe product analytics includes all of the marketing product and full</p>
<p>data from the customer journey I can easily build a funnel that aligns with</p>
<p>my needs we&rsquo;ll start with those users who check</p>
<p>their navigation panel and the Cadillac lyric</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re delivered our upgrade experiment</p>
<p>click through from it and finally subscribe to Super Cruise</p>
<p>look at that conversion rate it looks like our experiment really fueled</p>
<p>subscriptions now if I want to see these critical</p>
<p>product events and how they&rsquo;re performing over time Trends is just a</p>
<p>click away watch how the full context of my funnel</p>
<p>comes with me and now every step of that journey is trended</p>
<p>all the moments that matter with your customer available in one View</p>
<p>This truly is the Cadillac of product analytics tools</p>
<p>now you ready for the last leg of our journey</p>
<p>our customers love to analyze their data deeply in analysis workspace so from any</p>
<p>guided analysis I can simply click open in workspace and everything is brought</p>

<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>good morning good morning Adobe Summit it&rsquo;s so exciting to be here today thank</p>
<p>you to the Adobe team for inviting me to participate I have to tell you that</p>
<p>years ago when I was growing up in London I dreamed of being on the stage</p>
<p>in Las Vegas performing like my heroes like Michael Jackson I never imagined it</p>
<p>would be an audience like this but I&rsquo;m still very excited to be here with you</p>
<p>today my name is Marcus east it&rsquo;s my great privilege to be the chief digital</p>
<p>officer at T-Mobile USA and one of the things that&rsquo;s really important to us is</p>
<p>how we take care of our customers and what I&rsquo;m going to talk to you about</p>
<p>today is how we&rsquo;re leveraging the power of the Adobe ecosystem to do just that</p>
<p>now one of the things that I was reflecting on Backstage was that nearly</p>
<p>30 years ago I wrote a white paper about how what was then called the information</p>
<p>superhighway is going to change the way in which organizations were able to</p>
<p>really embrace the power of technology to change their relationship with their</p>
<p>stakeholders now as a little bit ahead of my time we know that 30 years ago we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have access to the technologies that we have today that have enabled us</p>
<p>to do incredible things particularly around the internet but I&rsquo;m very excited</p>
<p>in fact I&rsquo;ve never been more excited in my career than I am today because we</p>
<p>have the ability to leverage the technology coming from organizations</p>
<p>like Adobe to do incredible work for our customers</p>
<p>so one of the things that we do in the digital team that I&rsquo;m privileged to lead</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re responsible for all of our customer facing and Frontline facing</p>
<p>Technologies and experiences and one of the things that&rsquo;s really interesting for</p>
<p>us is this idea that the last 10 years of the uncarrier have allowed us to be</p>
<p>incredibly successful we&rsquo;ve developed a reputation for taking care of our</p>
<p>customers for crushing customer pain points for making sure they&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>trying to deliver the maximum value to our customers but also making sure that</p>
<p>they have a wonderful experience with us what is happening today is that we are</p>
<p>moving into the new era of the young carrier we are looking at how we can</p>
<p>harness the power of technology to deliver wonderful personalized</p>
<p>experiences powered by the sorts of solutions that you&rsquo;ve heard about today</p>
<p>from Adobe and that makes me very excited as a chief digital officer</p>
<p>because we have the potential to do things that we could only dream of when</p>
<p>I wrote that white paper that I talked about</p>
<p>30 years ago now T-Mobile as a company is uniquely positioned to take advantage</p>
<p>of the things that are available today but we must never lose sight of our</p>
<p>mission our mission as a company is to be the best in the world at connecting</p>
<p>our customers with their world and that doesn&rsquo;t matter who they are or where</p>
<p>they are or what they are doing we always want to make sure that we give</p>
<p>our customers the services that allow them to connect to their world whether</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re out enjoying things with their friends or whether they are traveling on</p>
<p>an airplane and many of you would have taken advantage of T-Mobile services on</p>
<p>your journey here today but the power that the Adobe suite is</p>
<p>unlocking for us gives us a unique opportunity a historic opportunity we</p>
<p>know that we have the best network that&rsquo;s the core of what we do as a</p>
<p>provider in the wireless industry we have a 5G Network that is the Envy of</p>
<p>the world and so we also then have to combine that with the best value and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re known for being a company that always takes care of its customers we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t raise our prices on our customers we give them the best network and the</p>
<p>best value and historically we have always given them the best experience</p>
<p>making sure that whether it is going into a store where they interact with</p>
<p>our renowned Frontline employees or whether they call our care centers that</p>
<p>are known for giving them fantastic care we know that that is something that has</p>
<p>made T-Mobile successful and special today</p>
<p>but our opportunity the opportunity that really excites us is building on all of</p>
<p>that using the solutions and the Technologies available today to take it</p>
<p>to the next level to make sure that this next era of the uncarrier is all about</p>
<p>digital experiences we have used for many years Adobe</p>
<p>experience manager to deliver fantastic websites and app experiences to our</p>
<p>customers and they have loved that and has been an incredible Channel through</p>
<p>which they have been able to interact with us but we&rsquo;re taking it to the next</p>
<p>level we&rsquo;re now embracing the power of the Adobe experience platform to deliver</p>
<p>personalized experiences to them that allow them to get even more from their</p>
<p>relationship with T-Mobile and that is something I could only have dreamed of</p>
<p>30 years ago but it is now at our fingertips and something that we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>able to do our partnership with Adobe that has allowed us to do this is more</p>
<p>than just wonderful technology we have a partner in Adobe that challenges us that</p>
<p>pushes us to always innovate to always be thinking about the ways in which we</p>
<p>can take advantage of the capabilities that are built by Adobe and the</p>
<p>ecosystem that is represented in this room today and use it to do something</p>
<p>incredibly special in this next phase of the young carrier</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll see is a set of experiences that go beyond even what we have</p>
<p>delivered in the past they will be contextual we will use all of the data</p>
<p>and all of the insights that we have developed through our platforms to allow</p>
<p>us to understand exactly what it is our customers are doing to make sure that</p>
<p>that context then becomes part of the capabilities that we use to inform what</p>
<p>we do with our customers we&rsquo;ll also make sure that our experiences are fully</p>
<p>tailored using the power of the Adobe suite making sure that every customer</p>
<p>gets an experience that is just right for them an experience that knows who</p>
<p>they are that can take advantage of all of the data that are available to give</p>
<p>them exactly the data and the information that they need at their</p>
<p>fingertips at any moment in time and then even a step further the ability to</p>
<p>use all of those capabilities to actually drive new products for our</p>
<p>customers in a way that wasn&rsquo;t possible before this phase of the young carrier</p>
<p>what do I mean by that for example a small business customer who maybe wants</p>
<p>to have a combination of Wireless plans and devices and software from third</p>
<p>parties we can use these digital capabilities to unlock those new product</p>
<p>experiences for that for them and to give them an opportunity to configure</p>
<p>things for themselves in a way that wasn&rsquo;t possible before in case you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tell I am incredibly excited about this it&rsquo;s my belief that there&rsquo;s never been a</p>
<p>better time to be a chief digital officer or to be working in this space</p>
<p>and what we are going to do with the Adobe suite of Technologies and products</p>
<p>is going to enable us to drive this next phase of the ant carrier I&rsquo;m personally</p>
<p>super excited about that one of the things that&rsquo;s key for us</p>
<p>though is that we understand that we&rsquo;re the best at taking care of our customers</p>
<p>when it comes to building a 5G Network when it comes to showing customer love</p>
<p>which is one of our values when it comes to making sure that we&rsquo;re the best value</p>
<p>in the industry we know that we are absolutely unrivaled when it comes to</p>
<p>that but when it comes to being able to take advantage of these Technologies we</p>
<p>knew that we needed to work with the best in the industry and that&rsquo;s why we</p>
<p>chose to work with Adobe we understand that through the thought</p>
<p>leadership that adobe has in this space that we&rsquo;re able to actually up our game</p>
<p>to make sure that we&rsquo;re always looking for ways to innovate in a way that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t possible to us beforehand and we&rsquo;re also taking it a step further in</p>
<p>that as well as taking advantage of the wonderful products and experiences that</p>
<p>are available we&rsquo;re working with adobe&rsquo;s Professional Services team to actually</p>
<p>provide us with Hands-On capabilities that are allowing us to accelerate our</p>
<p>adoption of these Technologies which is a critical part of this next phase of</p>
<p>the young carrier so I&rsquo;m personally excited about that I know our team is</p>
<p>excited about that I want to thank everybody that we work with not only at</p>
<p>Adobe but those people that we work with in The Wider Adobe ecosystem we can only</p>
<p>do the things that we do as a company and we can only be successful in the way</p>
<p>that we are through the partnership that we have with many of you and the</p>
<p>relationship that we have with you now I could talk for hours about the work that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing but I&rsquo;ve been want not to do that so I&rsquo;m going to end with a call to</p>
<p>action as I said earlier 30 years ago I dreamed</p>
<p>of being able to build these incredible digital experiences for customers and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my belief that now is the time so it doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are whether</p>
<p>you are an author or a Content producer or a designer or an app developer or a</p>
<p>chief digital officer like myself now is the time to get after your digital</p>
<p>transformation we have a unique window of opportunity where our customers are</p>
<p>familiar with digital where we have through Partnerships with companies like</p>
<p>Adobe the tools and the experiences that allow us to be successful when it comes</p>
<p>to delivering these new experiences and so for all of us the call to action is</p>
<p>embrace your digital transformation now many people have talked about it for a</p>
<p>decade and some even longer now is the time to get after it I&rsquo;m super excited I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t wait to hear more about the products and the experiences coming from</p>
<p>Adobe and its partners and I look forward to coming back to you hopefully</p>
<p>next year to share more insights about this Inc credible transformation Journey</p>
<p>that we are on with our partners at Adobe thank you for your time this</p>
<p>morning and enjoy the rest of the summit take care</p>
<p>foreign [Applause]</p>
<p>thank you Marcus that was awesome and and you and to everyone at T-Mobile we</p>
<p>really appreciate the Deep partnership that you talked about and we will keep a</p>
<p>close eye as you continue to push the envelope on outstanding personalized</p>
<p>experiences keeping the customer at the center</p>
<p>okay we&rsquo;ve talked about personalization scale and how that is key to drive</p>
<p>experience-led growth now something talked about the</p>
<p>insatiable appetite for content content making all the difference the right</p>
<p>headline the right message the right visual the right layout delivered at the</p>
<p>right time to the customer really helps in the personalization at scale</p>
<p>so as true personalization at scale becomes the norm It&rsquo;s Not Unusual for</p>
<p>Brands to be creating managing activating storing literally millions of</p>
<p>assets and that tsunami of content is only</p>
<p>growing we did a study recently we found out in</p>
<p>the last couple of years the need for Content the demand for</p>
<p>Content essentially to drive marketing campaigns has grown by 2x over the last</p>
<p>couple of years I don&rsquo;t think your budgets have doubled</p>
<p>by 2x over the last couple of years now when you think of what&rsquo;s coming in</p>
<p>the same survey we checked that in the next couple of years it&rsquo;ll grow by 5x</p>
<p>the expected content demands from marketing campaigns to drive</p>
<p>personalization will grow by 5x and it&rsquo;s not just volume</p>
<p>the variety of content types the mediums the channels on which you need to</p>
<p>deliberate also continue to grow and it makes it a problem of incredible scale</p>
<p>so one that even the most sophisticated brands are struggling to Grapple with</p>
<p>and so to respond to that it can lead to fragmented systems and teams chaotic</p>
<p>processes a lot of manual effort ending in less than a stellar experience</p>
<p>when you actually drive those campaigns and use activation and with this content</p>
<p>and also results in huge inefficiency for your business</p>
<p>to address these challenges I&rsquo;m happy to share that adobe is reimagining the</p>
<p>future of the entire content process I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce the industry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first comprehensive content supply chain solution</p>
<p>focused on helping you deliver better and more personalized content in real</p>
<p>time which will directly impact your success in driving profitable growth</p>
<p>so to get you there we are connecting natively applications across the Adobe</p>
<p>Creative Cloud and the experience cloud and only Adobe can provide you the</p>
<p>entire range of applications integrated applications and services that are</p>
<p>necessary to address every step of the content process</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s take a little bit of a deeper look at the content process</p>
<p>across Industries there are four typical steps in the content process planning</p>
<p>production delivery and Analysis so we&rsquo;ll go through each one of these</p>
<p>critical stages of the content supply chain</p>
<p>first in planning for many companies content creation is very ad hoc</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty inefficient and slow and frustrating if you can&rsquo;t have the right</p>
<p>content in time for your campaigns so with that in mind we are effectively</p>
<p>closing the gap between the work creatives do</p>
<p>and the outcomes you need to drive those campaigns and we are accomplishing this</p>
<p>by threading the strategy of campaigns into the process of prioritizing and</p>
<p>resourcing the content planning and content production</p>
<p>with Adobe work front our leading marketing workflow application in the</p>
<p>industry you get the benefits of agile with workfront simple boards which let</p>
<p>marketing teams iteratively manage campaigns</p>
<p>now you can create boards with any number of columns or Swim lanes and</p>
<p>organize your projects and tasks with a simple drag and drop</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re also introducing new campaign planning and marketing visualization</p>
<p>capabilities with unified marketing calendar and campaign objects across the</p>
<p>Adobe experience cloud</p>
<p>so with simple boards it gets you with workfront is center of gravity for all</p>
<p>the teams products and processes that you require to activate world-class</p>
<p>campaigns so think of them as like an operational graph that you can use to</p>
<p>model relationships and processes to optimize the end-to-end campaign process</p>
<p>and with workfront you can track all of this work everything about a campaign</p>
<p>through its entire life cycle regardless of the applications that you need to use</p>
<p>along the way so if you&rsquo;re still using spreadsheets</p>
<p>ticketing tools Etc to manage complex campaigns and projects it&rsquo;s really past</p>
<p>time to modernize how you do your content production</p>
<p>that brings me to the Second Step production this is the engine room of</p>
<p>the content process where all the creative magic happens</p>
<p>and with workfront we are helping you streamline the way work gets</p>
<p>orchestrated throughout the process</p>
<p>starts with a single place to intake and prioritize your request an intelligent</p>
<p>resourcing tools that make assignments based on the available bandwidth whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s with your in-house teams or with external agencies and partners that you</p>
<p>use and simple dashboards easy to understand dashboard that show the</p>
<p>status roadblocks and everything you need to keep your content production on</p>
<p>track for your campaigns and since collaboration is a critical</p>
<p>part of enabling the top-notch work work helps teams share ideas tag colleagues</p>
<p>with comments request clarification and kick off reviews and approvals all in</p>
<p>one place and by integrating with Creative Cloud</p>
<p>we can now surface these same capabilities directly in the</p>
<p>applications where most content gets created which is there to be Creative</p>
<p>Cloud</p>
<p>so now we have native Integrations with between work front and Adobe</p>
<p>Photoshop InDesign illustrator Premiere Pro and with after effect so creatives</p>
<p>can see the tasks view comments a lot of time even indirectly in the applications</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re using without having to leave that creative context</p>
<p>so that is a big time saver for creatives I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll actually bring</p>
<p>a smile to the entire marketing and creative groups as well</p>
<p>and Adobe continues to invest in bringing</p>
<p>bringing shantanu talked about we introduce Adobe Express just over a</p>
<p>year ago and it has become a really popular quick</p>
<p>and easy creative tool seamlessly connected to Creative Cloud with</p>
<p>collaboration built in at its core and today</p>
<p>thrilled to announce that we&rsquo;re bringing Adobe Express to the Enterprise</p>
<p>so now Adobe Express will Empower anyone in your organization any user not just</p>
<p>your creative team to create share and review all of your content on brand</p>
<p>including social media posts videos other marketing assets based on the</p>
<p>templates that you have we see tremendous opportunity between</p>
<p>Adobe Express and the Creative Cloud and this native integration between</p>
<p>Adobe Express and the Adobe experience manager assets will also bring the Adobe</p>
<p>Firefly generative AI capabilities that we talked about into experience manager</p>
<p>asset and enable teams to create stunningly</p>
<p>unique unique imagery effects so that you can complement your existing branded</p>
<p>and stock assets and that will help you take your content</p>
<p>production velocity up a notch to a new level</p>
<p>third key step is delivery you can create the most amazing content</p>
<p>in the world but if you can&rsquo;t get it to the campaign to the activation at the</p>
<p>right time through the right Channel it falls flat</p>
<p>Adobe experience manager helps you solve that problem it&rsquo;s our content management</p>
<p>Powerhouse and we&rsquo;ve had a lot of Innovations in</p>
<p>Adobe content experience manager with headless capabilities the cloud service</p>
<p>now we have evolved it into a powerful Suite of composable content services so</p>
<p>that you can deliver high impact personalized experiences across any</p>
<p>channel today I&rsquo;m excited to announce the next</p>
<p>generation of composability in the experience manager</p>
<p>so with this we&rsquo;re truly unlocking content authoring democratizing content</p>
<p>authoring so that you get the velocity to publish at the speed that you need</p>
<p>with experience manager users can cross your Enterprise will now be empowered to</p>
<p>update content across any online Channel including websites and mobile apps</p>
<p>directly from the documents that they created and with the tools that they are</p>
<p>already using whether it&rsquo;s Microsoft Word or Google docs for example</p>
<p>that means without content management expertise</p>
<p>teams can create edit publish all from the same document think about what that</p>
<p>does to your content velocity and they can do all that with proper</p>
<p>security and access controls to ensure that only the people who are</p>
<p>authorized to make those changes can actually make them</p>
<p>that is a game changer when you talk about personalized experiences at scale</p>
<p>making that happen with any content that&rsquo;s a game changer and these same</p>
<p>capabilities also extend to Adobe asset experience manager Farms as well</p>
<p>so for those of you in regulated Industries who are big customers of</p>
<p>adobe experience Farms that is massive when you consider the number of paper to</p>
<p>digital Transformations that are still going on whether it&rsquo;s in financial</p>
<p>services government and verticals like that</p>
<p>finally analysis this is where the process</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re really really medical strengths so for the</p>
<p>first time we are leveraging AI with Adobe Sensei to link content performance</p>
<p>directly with creativity and what does that mean let me explain</p>
<p>so traditionally when you think of content metrics they&rsquo;ve just focused on</p>
<p>the top line like views or clicks which is really important but an incomplete</p>
<p>View today</p>
<p>through the power of Sensei we are enabling you to analyze content</p>
<p>performance at an attribute and an audience segment level by connecting the</p>
<p>Adobe experience manager with the profile that you have in the Adobe</p>
<p>experience platform this means you can now measure aspects</p>
<p>such as you know color objects composition even writing style and see</p>
<p>how they impact performance of the content with different audiences</p>
<p>once again when you look at this entire flow there is no better way to bring all</p>
<p>of this to life than to see it firsthand through a demo so for that I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>pleased to welcome Ben Tepper to the stage to show you our content supply</p>
<p>chain demo Ben</p>
<p>thanks annel content is the lifeblood of a Brand&rsquo;s</p>
<p>identity and it defines the way that all of you interact with your customers and</p>
<p>today I am so excited to share with you how Adobe can help you deliver the</p>
<p>entire content supply chain from content planning and production through delivery</p>
<p>and Analysis and I&rsquo;m going to do this through the lens of one of our the US&rsquo;s</p>
<p>leading retailers Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods and I want to start by letting you know</p>
<p>that all the assets and data that you see are fictitious to respect Dick&rsquo;s</p>
<p>customers privacy so let&rsquo;s get started I&rsquo;m going to begin by planning a spring</p>
<p>campaign in Adobe work front now with the new dashboard view I can easily see</p>
<p>all of my assets my team members my budget all in a single View and in the</p>
<p>calendar view I can see a correlation over time for me and my campaign</p>
<p>managers about what&rsquo;s happening and when if I dive directly into my spring</p>
<p>campaign I can see tasks assigned and aligned across my entire team and I also</p>
<p>see assets from Adobe experience manager so this continuity and centralization</p>
<p>ensures that everyone in my organization is working towards the same goals and</p>
<p>the same kpis now workfront also empowers everyone to</p>
<p>excel in the tools that they&rsquo;re already using so let&rsquo;s talk about content</p>
<p>production and the Adobe Creative Cloud in Creative Cloud we have workfront</p>
<p>natively integrated so I as a designer can use the tools I already love like</p>
<p>Adobe Photoshop here I can see my tasks I can see comments for collaboration I</p>
<p>can easily make edits in Photoshop and as soon as I&rsquo;m done I can easily upload</p>
<p>a brand new proof of this asset to workfront for formal stakeholder</p>
<p>approval so we&rsquo;re doing we&rsquo;re succeeding in the tasks in the tools we&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>using and the same is also true in Adobe Premiere Pro where video teams also have</p>
<p>access to workfront tasks and objectives but we also have integration with frame</p>
<p>i o and what that means is I can see here in my timeline Integrations and</p>
<p>comments from my team what&rsquo;s working directly within the timeline in the</p>
<p>sequences that I&rsquo;m already editing so video production is happening exactly</p>
<p>here and collaboration is happening everywhere</p>
<p>now for many organizations such as dicks the creative teams are focused on</p>
<p>primary campaign imagery such as the ones that you see here in Adobe</p>
<p>experience manager but more and more frequently marketers need to be able to</p>
<p>create and scale on brand content and that my friends is where Adobe Express</p>
<p>comes in Express is the universal tool for creatives and marketers to be able</p>
<p>to create and scale on-brand content in Express I&rsquo;m going to open one of my</p>
<p>images from experience manager and here in Express I can add text I can add</p>
<p>elements more images templates but I also have my shared Creative Cloud</p>
<p>libraries so all the logos colors and fonts that my creative teams are using</p>
<p>are accessible for me here as well but there&rsquo;s something else I also want</p>
<p>to talk about today in the lens of Express and that&rsquo;s Adobe Firefly you</p>
<p>heard a little bit earlier on about Firefly and the breadth of what it can</p>
<p>do now I really want to focus on my campaign imagery for this tent and what</p>
<p>I did before this demo is I trained a man I created a a model on the specific</p>
<p>product because I think this 10 looks good but it would look even better in</p>
<p>different Landscapes wouldn&rsquo;t you agree so now with firefly what I can do is</p>
<p>easily type in a prompt with the text to image generate and</p>
<p>okay you should clout for this this is really cool</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s happening is I&rsquo;m taking all the understandings about that tent</p>
<p>that specific product in High Fidelity and putting it in different locations</p>
<p>and I as a marketer creative can make changes change the style make</p>
<p>modifications we can add other locations as well and so we have the ability to</p>
<p>take this image and put it in different backgrounds</p>
<p>for today we&rsquo;ll stick with this version that we have here and now I want to make</p>
<p>it ready for my different channels and with Express it&rsquo;s easy to add drag and</p>
<p>drop text images I&rsquo;m going to change the color here I think I want to add a</p>
<p>little bit more text for this product page and I think that this looks fine</p>
<p>right it looks okay but we want to apply all of those brand assets that we talked</p>
<p>about before and I want this to look great on all of my channels so we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>apply the brand standards and now I have an asset that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>look great whether it&rsquo;s an advertising web Instagram all of your different</p>
<p>channels this asset is ready to go but there&rsquo;s one other thing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the this asset needs to look in different shapes for depending on the</p>
<p>channel maybe a banner maybe a hero image now this resizing images is often</p>
<p>something that takes a lot of tedious work but now</p>
<p>with Photoshop apis natively an experience manager I hit save and I</p>
<p>create Renditions of that very image for all of my digital channels one click and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done [Applause]</p>
<p>so now my creative team can focus on real creative tasks not these repetitive</p>
<p>tasks so now we&rsquo;ve got content let&rsquo;s move into</p>
<p>the delivery phase of things now the first thing that I want to do in</p>
<p>delivery is come over to experience manager I have a product page here at</p>
<p>this beautiful new editor and experience manager the first thing I&rsquo;ll do is</p>
<p>update this product image with the new one we just created a few moments ago</p>
<p>and as I&rsquo;m looking at the page content here I&rsquo;m wondering what I can do to</p>
<p>drive higher engagement to certain Target audiences well that is where</p>
<p>Adobe Sensei gen AI comes in now Sensei Genai understands the context of this</p>
<p>page as well as my goals as a marketer it gives me suggestions about how I can</p>
<p>improve engagement in my case I&rsquo;m curious about what I can do to drive</p>
<p>engagement for first time or beginner campers so we&rsquo;ll see what we got</p>
<p>so the recommendation here is to change the language around beginner or</p>
<p>first-time campers now it&rsquo;s really important to note that at any point in</p>
<p>time I as a marketer am in complete control I can choose I can approve I can</p>
<p>make modifications and so you&rsquo;ll see here that I am always going to be</p>
<p>creating on brand content so the text that you&rsquo;re about to see generated will</p>
<p>look and align like all the different assets and imagery and text that you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>see across six pages so this is very specific to the brand I can test this</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and save it for today</p>
<p>okay now check out this site using experience</p>
<p>manager now I love this one because it&rsquo;s got great interactivity a lot going on</p>
<p>on it but here&rsquo;s the really cool thing about this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually authoring and editing this in Microsoft Word this is what we call</p>
<p>Next Generation composability it means that content can be created anywhere</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and type on stage which is always fun</p>
<p>and what happens is when I hit save and make that modification I I can easily</p>
<p>see those updates live there we go so what we&rsquo;ve done is we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>made it easy for content to be edited anywhere think about it</p>
<p>so authoring happens everywhere content happens creation happens across the</p>
<p>teams and now what I want to focus on is how we drive people to that site with</p>
<p>Adobe Journey Optimizer I already have Integrations with workfront all the kpis</p>
<p>my timelines it all lines up right here and in terms of creating the creative in</p>
<p>the email editor I simply drag drop done that&rsquo;s it so we&rsquo;ve updated the</p>
<p>metadata and the Assets in a few clicks you can clap if you want</p>
<p>okay thank you now there&rsquo;s one more thing that I want to touch on and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>content performance the analytics and the analysis stage of things</p>
<p>to once our campaign is live now with content performance I can see which</p>
<p>assets are performing well for which audiences that&rsquo;s right this is</p>
<p>experience manager and experience platform working together to understand</p>
<p>which content works well for which audiences and I can dive really deep</p>
<p>into that if I take a look at one of my pages here I see what&rsquo;s happening and</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s happening key keywords of interactions what assets are driving</p>
<p>interactions and what&rsquo;s really important is that as a marketer I could look</p>
<p>across the board what assets are performing well what types of texts are</p>
<p>engaging what aesthetic are my audiences engaging with so now I can build more</p>
<p>and more content like that and what that really means is that I can go to a stock</p>
<p>to find more content Adobe stock or I can work with my creatives to generate</p>
<p>new assets I could even use Firefly to create new assets but most of all all of</p>
<p>these insights come back around to workfront as well so next time I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>plan a campaign and activate I can use these in size</p>
<p>so you have seen now the present and the future of the content supply chain</p>
<p>content planning in a single source of Truth content creation led by creatives</p>
<p>and assisted by Ai authoring and delivery everywhere and finally content</p>
<p>analytics to help you understand not just what&rsquo;s happening and why but also</p>
<p>for whom thank you [Applause]</p>
<p>thank you Ben really cool and you know I&rsquo;ll repeat that we only scratched the</p>
<p>surface here I encourage you to check out the content Innovation super session</p>
<p>after the keynote to go much deeper into the content supply chain how we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bringing all of this together all right we&rsquo;ve talked about data and</p>
<p>content and how working in Perfect Harmony at scale is clearly what you</p>
<p>need to drive growth from experiences doing that with privacy and governance</p>
<p>in mind is key for all of us and perhaps nowhere so than in an industry like</p>
<p>Financial Services</p>
<p>as one of the bedrocks in the industry Prudential Financial knows this really</p>
<p>well so to share more about how Prudential</p>
<p>envisions the role and future of customer experience in a highly</p>
<p>regulated industry I&rsquo;m excited to welcome onto the stage Prudential</p>
<p>financials Chief marketing officer Susan somersil Johnson please join me in</p>
<p>welcoming Susan you welcome</p>
<p>[Music] thank you great to be here</p>
<p>[Music] thanks so much for joining us today</p>
<p>really appreciate it absolutely happy to be here yeah I&rsquo;d like to start maybe</p>
<p>just a little bit about you I mean you are the chief marketing officer at a</p>
<p>global financial institution but interestingly you didn&rsquo;t start your</p>
<p>career as a marketer you started your career as an engineer an engineer an</p>
<p>engineer um and how did you what led you to that and how did you make that pivot</p>
<p>I gotta tell you the story first of all Neil it&rsquo;s great to see you again and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great to see all of you here it&rsquo;s just really exciting the energy is</p>
<p>amazing um yeah I started my career as an</p>
<p>engineer my dad was an engineer I think that&rsquo;s how I was programmed from birth</p>
<p>probably um I um for goodness sake so I was a</p>
<p>mathlete in high school and I don&rsquo;t know how many people know what that is but if</p>
<p>you think of an athlete it&rsquo;s not that so um I at that time when I started my</p>
<p>career I couldn&rsquo;t imagine talking to a group of 10 people much less a group of</p>
<p>ten thousand that you have here so I always encourage people to to embrace</p>
<p>change so so early in my career when I was at Apple one of my mentors said</p>
<p>would you consider a role in marketing and I thought he&rsquo;d lost his mind I I was</p>
<p>I was terrified I didn&rsquo;t have I didn&rsquo;t think I had any aptitude in that area</p>
<p>but so I made the jump and and I&rsquo;m really happy that I did</p>
<p>um so so yes I kind of live in that</p>
<p>intersection between data and content left brain right brain and I&rsquo;m so happy</p>
<p>I made the move and I think a lot of marketers will resonate with this</p>
<p>because I really appreciate the power of marketing of what we do we have such a</p>
<p>loud voice right I mean we have a huge platform and and the way I see it I</p>
<p>always say we can either use that voice to change the way people see our brands</p>
<p>or or maybe and use that voice to change the way people see themselves and their</p>
<p>role in society and and in the world so I love being a marketer that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great to hear your personal story thank you thank you</p>
<p>so maybe talk talk Prudential now I know our audience I&rsquo;m sure is familiar with</p>
<p>the brand everybody has seen the logo many are probably customers themselves</p>
<p>but I know you have a really ambitious strategy that you&rsquo;ve laid out so would</p>
<p>love to hear a little bit more about prudentials vision and strategy and how</p>
<p>marketing is helping shape that sure a very ambitious very ambitious Vision so</p>
<p>yeah I think most people know Prudential our awareness is very high and</p>
<p>especially awareness of our iconic symbol the the rock the Prudential rock</p>
<p>you see here most people know it um so just as an aside it&rsquo;s the eighth</p>
<p>oldest trademark in the world which I didn&rsquo;t know when I joined so it was kind</p>
<p>of a nice benefit as a marketer to have that kind of history behind you so so</p>
<p>most people know us but you may not know all that we do because we&rsquo;ve grown so</p>
<p>much so so I just wanted to um take a step back for a minute so we focus on</p>
<p>investing insurance and Retirement Services we are the largest life insurer</p>
<p>in the US so we have a large Global presence p-gym our Global asset manager</p>
<p>is one of the largest in the world so a lot of people rely on us 50 million</p>
<p>customers over 50 countries and over three billion dollars in in</p>
<p>contributions to society so back to our ambitious vision</p>
<p>when that many people rely on you have to have a big vision and we do and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>to expand access to investing insurance and Retirement services and security and</p>
<p>and I want to tell you what that means because I think I&rsquo;d like you to</p>
<p>internalize it a little bit so you could see how our partnership with Adobe is</p>
<p>helping us so much so I&rsquo;m going to throw out a few big numbers but I really like</p>
<p>you to think about the people behind the numbers so 3.9 billion people don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough life insurance so over 100 million in the U.S</p>
<p>may sound like a large number but but what does that really mean so if you</p>
<p>think about the people behind that what&rsquo;s really common when you read the</p>
<p>stories and talk to the people you get people who work really hard to lift</p>
<p>their families up right you get parents who work their whole lives one job two</p>
<p>jobs and anything happens to one of them the family is plunged back into poverty</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very common if you think about I wanted to talk about retirement</p>
<p>security so 41 percent of people in the world live in fear they won&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough money to retire so again that&rsquo;s a big number right but</p>
<p>what does that mean if you think about it</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re lucky to have a job as they go into retirement they will have to</p>
<p>continue working even when their bodies can&rsquo;t keep up anymore</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re really serious about our vision that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here because we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to expand access to all those people and technology is vital part of that</p>
<p>technology and personalization I can totally imagine every individual</p>
<p>is different every family and every household is different and makes the</p>
<p>personalization even more critical so when I think about know how we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to relate to each one you never know what&rsquo;s going to click exactly yeah so</p>
<p>clearly that that client experience that customer experience front and center for</p>
<p>Prudential so we&rsquo;ve talked a lot about experience-led growth today</p>
<p>how does that resonate with you and with Prudential</p>
<p>it resonates because so Financial firm I think Financial</p>
<p>Services firms in general are really good we excel at product-led growth but</p>
<p>you know some of the macro Trends I just talked about demographic Trends the</p>
<p>lines are now blurring so so you may remember it used to be build it and they</p>
<p>will come right and that has morphed and now it&rsquo;s find out what they want and</p>
<p>give it to them fast right so that&rsquo;s a key pillar of our of</p>
<p>our growth strategy how do we deeply deeply understand what people want so</p>
<p>so I think about it Mass advertising is great</p>
<p>and we use a lot of it a lot of it and it&rsquo;s very effective but</p>
<p>personalization is key if you&rsquo;re going to reach that many people and that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we partner with you that&rsquo;s why we partner with Adobe so closely</p>
<p>because adobe&rsquo;s been revolutionizing creating customer experience at scale</p>
<p>for decades and that&rsquo;s what we need to be able to reach to reach that many</p>
<p>people and when we were talking earlier you talked about some of the examples of</p>
<p>that AI based personalization at scale I thought those were really awesome maybe</p>
<p>you could share some with the audience here on some of those examples I&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>happy to be happy to just just a few examples for you um</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll start with a P gym our Global asset manager so I have about</p>
<p>1700 clients globally and so we&rsquo;re one of the world&rsquo;s largest money managers</p>
<p>for institutional investors put that in perspective for you</p>
<p>um those those institutions protect the assets of millions and millions of</p>
<p>people think like the largest pension Pension funds around the world so when</p>
<p>you have a year like we did last year in the beginning of this year economic</p>
<p>volatility geopolitical volatility what do you think those institutions</p>
<p>need</p>
<p>they need confidence they need information to make the right decisions</p>
<p>fast they need relevant information and they need it fast so so we use Adobe and</p>
<p>our client-centric Journeys to make sure and this worked really well for us</p>
<p>through all the volatility last year that they have what they need when they</p>
<p>when they need it so they can so they can manage that risk</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s just one example I also wanted to talk about insurance because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so important to so many people some some of the world&rsquo;s largest</p>
<p>companies rely on us to protect their employees</p>
<p>so with all types of insurance so so our plan is to use so we&rsquo;re having an ever</p>
<p>increasing um understanding of their employees</p>
<p>needs and so we&rsquo;re using our our client-centered Journeys to make sure</p>
<p>they have the right coverage at the right time you know whether they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having a baby buying a home getting ready to retire they have the right</p>
<p>coverage at the right time and the the last example that I wanted</p>
<p>to give you I wanted to go to Japan for a minute because I think this is</p>
<p>important for for all of us because it&rsquo;s a sign of things to come so the trends</p>
<p>that are happening in Japan you&rsquo;re probably aware are happening at most</p>
<p>places in the world but just Japan is at the Forefront first and that is</p>
<p>declining birth rates aging population so by 2030</p>
<p>one-third of Japan will be people over 65. it&rsquo;s not that far away 20 30. so</p>
<p>what that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s forced us to rethink retirement right what is retirement</p>
<p>security look like people aren&rsquo;t just living longer they&rsquo;re living healthier</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re living productive right so you really have to rethink</p>
<p>um rethink retirement so so we&rsquo;re using Adobe to help us educate</p>
<p>to help us reach people who aren&rsquo;t thinking about that yet across the globe</p>
<p>people who aren&rsquo;t planning and to help Taylor tailor our um our Solutions so</p>
<p>that we can meet meet their needs better I think I think the</p>
<p>the best thing to me from all of this is a brand Builder</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s building our brand right connecting with more people but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also fueling growth which all marketers want to do so we&rsquo;re fueling growth but</p>
<p>also also saving a lot of cost this this year alone we will</p>
<p>decommission 10 platforms 10 platforms think of the cost savings there so you</p>
<p>get the revenue growth and you get the cost savings and that you&rsquo;re replacing</p>
<p>that with the Adobe experience platform and the apps exactly and that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>this year alone and we&rsquo;ll continue to do that that&rsquo;s awesome it&rsquo;s great to hear</p>
<p>so a question about trust and data governance in your industry with the</p>
<p>kind of client relationships that you&rsquo;re forming that is critical the effective</p>
<p>use of data is important but it has to be in the context of trust and and data</p>
<p>governance so we&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts yeah very important and and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a balancing act I think um it&rsquo;s a balancing act to meet customer</p>
<p>expectations but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a bouncing act that we&rsquo;re turning into an advantage</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll start with a fact</p>
<p>personalized experience and content build trust</p>
<p>over half a consumer say they&rsquo;ll stop buying from a brand that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>personalize the experience and add value over half right but they want that in a</p>
<p>privacy first framework so so two things happening as you all</p>
<p>know consumer privacy expectations are rising</p>
<p>also the regulatory the regulatory requirements around</p>
<p>privacy are expanding we look at both of those and and the way we see it that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an opportunity because if if you if you do it right you</p>
<p>can meet customer needs better that personalized personalization they want</p>
<p>build trust and better connections with your brand so I&rsquo;ll give you I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>you an example we partner with one Trust and so they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re integrated with</p>
<p>the Adobe stack and we partner with them on our consents and preferences platform</p>
<p>our goal is to go beyond data management to go beyond regulatory governments and</p>
<p>and build customer experience that build trust so we can provide transparency</p>
<p>better personalized experience all all in a privacy enabled framework</p>
<p>that is built on the consent on the consent the choices of the customer</p>
<p>right built on their their choices so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a win it&rsquo;s a win-win the</p>
<p>customer for us and and I think we just want to</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re all very aware that consumers will share their information</p>
<p>if you add value right they will share more information if you add value so the</p>
<p>way we look at it this allows us to take personalized experience to a whole new</p>
<p>level to build that trust and to build a connection with the brand that makes our</p>
<p>marketing much much more effective awesome great insights any closing</p>
<p>thoughts for our audience here um yeah I would just I I&rsquo;d like to say</p>
<p>Embrace change because it&rsquo;s happening fast when you talk about the five times</p>
<p>change in data needs it&rsquo;s happening fast and in my career I tell you I&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>some pretty big career changes that I talked about and I was terrified in the</p>
<p>process and I&rsquo;m so happy I did now so Embrace change in your careers and in</p>
<p>your lives and it&rsquo;s not going to be easy but you&rsquo;re really gonna appreciate it</p>
<p>thank you awesome thank you so much thanks for your partnership Susan and</p>
<p>and really appreciate you being here appreciate it</p>
