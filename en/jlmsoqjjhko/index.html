Berg here in this video we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about instrumented fasting and discipline so the first thing I&amp;rsquo;m going to say is for those of you they&amp;rsquo;re already doing this I&amp;rsquo;m going to say you are amazing because it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to go 18 hours or you know 20 hours without eating it takes a tremendous amount of discipline so well done on that but those of you that are not doing that I want to try to talk you into it because there&amp;rsquo;s some really cool benefits my message has always been you have the power over food your body your health okay but what do most people do it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite the food is controlling them I was in the airport last night I was watching people in line at the Cinnabon little place they had there there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of people in line that looked healthy there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any slim people there was a lot of overweight people in that line and basically the food manufacturing companies are really smart in that they prey on people&amp;rsquo;s emotions that the sensation of that food it&amp;rsquo;s all short-term they don&amp;rsquo;t think tomorrow they&amp;rsquo;re thinking right now just going there eating that Cinnabon so people live for the sensation of food their whole life is wrapped around this sensation it comes with a package okay I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the sensation of health foods talk about the sensation of junk foods the food manufacturing companies have inserted many chemicals in those foods that keep you highly addictive so what&amp;rsquo;s happening is they&amp;rsquo;re being controlled by this blood sugar trap it&amp;rsquo;s like the sugar it goes down now they&amp;rsquo;re hungry they go eat it goes up they get tired goes down they eat it and this it&amp;rsquo;s just it&amp;rsquo;s literally a trap so in intermittent fasting it&amp;rsquo;s an exercise in self-discipline now we get to intermittent fasting most people are doing it with fairly healthy suits so I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about doing the Cinnabon within intermittent fasting but intermittent fasting is an exercise in self-deploying you think about it it has so many benefits physically like increasing growth hormone by 2,000 percent we growing nerve cells so your cognitive function is amazing high levels of ketosis where your body is so level you&amp;rsquo;re out of the blood sugar issues now now you have this incredible energy that&amp;rsquo;s very sustaining improving your memory improving inflammation improving and cardiovascular function I mean it goes it&amp;rsquo;s amazing but beyond the health there&amp;rsquo;s also a personal increasing your personal power your personal willpower because you&amp;rsquo;re actually putting discipline when you&amp;rsquo;re not eating for a period of time despite all this temptation it really improves your personal willpower which is actually almost equivalent to the body improvement so I want you to look beyond the short-term pleasure of it and look at the long-term benefits on a physical and emotional level of intermittent fasting because I think you&amp;rsquo;ll love it there is some uncomfortableness in the first two weeks because you&amp;rsquo;re adapting to it but you can do it on such a nice gradual increase that it&amp;rsquo;s not that hard but you have to just be really conscious of what you&amp;rsquo;re doing and not randomly just kind of eat what you want okay so you start with three meals a day do that for your period of time without snacks then graduate to you know eating later and later and later the breakfast until the point where you&amp;rsquo;re having no breakfast all you&amp;rsquo;re just doing a lunch and a dinner two meals so I put a link down below of how to do this so the next step is just to start well as of today I&amp;rsquo;m just under 60 pounds total ah since yeah since and so for the women out there you guys I was killing a size 18 women and now I&amp;rsquo;m in a loose size 10 wow that&amp;rsquo;s fantastic you basically have a six pack AB right now right oh yeah absolutely I never I never really had six pack abs let&amp;rsquo;s just say even when I was 170 pounds soccer weight I didn&amp;rsquo;t really it wasn&amp;rsquo;t defined let&amp;rsquo;s just say in terms of that you can kind of see the outside that you never could see the inside now you can definitely see the whole thing especially if I like flex a little bit that&amp;rsquo;s very prominent and you know that definitely feels good I&amp;rsquo;m proud that I&amp;rsquo;ll have to worry about wearing a swim shirt when I go with my kids to the pool or something which I would when I was one 80 pounds 100 pounds of elbow embarrassed in that way but besides just looking better I just feel a hundred percent better yeah it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell how you feel really when you 180 pounds you know you don&amp;rsquo;t feel good but if I could compare somehow get the feeling trapped in a bottle for both feelings at the same time it&amp;rsquo;s so much better now than it right so I thought let me give my body a chance to adapt more than two or three months I did my blood test again and my cluster was at the normal range I was so happy you know like I sorry doctor like you I have two members of my family you know one died of a heart stroke and one is the disabled through the neck down just because of heart disease and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to take that to it because I&amp;rsquo;m going to take start taking tablets I&amp;rsquo;m going to start it oh it&amp;rsquo;s going to open for me other doors like other medications are and but no I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that I wanted to go into ketosis and I got committed and people saw my results hey if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already subscribed press this little button down below okay thanks"><title>Intermittent Fasting Benefits Explained By Dr.Berg ｜ DrEricBergDC |

Berg here in this video we&rsquo;re going to 
talk about instrumented fasting and discipline so  </p><p>the first thing I&rsquo;m going to say is for those 
of you they&rsquo;re already doing this I&rsquo;m going to  </p><p>say you are amazing because it&rsquo;s not easy to go 18 
hours or you know 20 hours without eating it takes  </p><p>a tremendous amount of discipline so well done on 
that but those of you that are not doing that I  </p><p>want to try to talk you into it because there&rsquo;s 
some really cool benefits my message has always  </p><p>been you have the power over food your body your 
health okay but what do most people do it&rsquo;s the  </p><p>opposite the food is controlling them I was in the 
airport last night I was watching people in line  </p><p>at the Cinnabon little place they had there there 
wasn&rsquo;t a lot of people in line that looked healthy  </p><p>there wasn&rsquo;t any slim people there was a lot of 
overweight people in that line and basically the  </p><p>food manufacturing companies are really smart 
in that they prey on people&rsquo;s emotions that the  </p><p>sensation of that food it&rsquo;s all short-term they 
don&rsquo;t think tomorrow they&rsquo;re thinking right now  </p><p>just going there eating that Cinnabon so people 
live for the sensation of food their whole life  </p><p>is wrapped around this sensation it comes with a 
package okay I&rsquo;m not talking about the sensation  </p><p>of health foods talk about the sensation of 
junk foods the food manufacturing companies  </p><p>have inserted many chemicals in those foods that 
keep you highly addictive so what&rsquo;s happening  </p><p>is they&rsquo;re being controlled by this blood sugar 
trap it&rsquo;s like the sugar it goes down now they&rsquo;re  </p><p>hungry they go eat it goes up they get tired goes 
down they eat it and this it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s literally  </p><p>a trap so in intermittent fasting it&rsquo;s an exercise 
in self-discipline now we get to intermittent  </p><p>fasting most people are doing it with fairly 
healthy suits so I&rsquo;m not talking about doing the  </p><p>Cinnabon within intermittent fasting but intermittent 
fasting is an exercise in self-deploying you  </p><p>think about it it has so many benefits physically 
like increasing growth hormone by 2,000 percent  </p><p>we growing nerve cells so your cognitive function 
is amazing high levels of ketosis where your body  </p><p>is so level you&rsquo;re out of the blood sugar issues 
now now you have this incredible energy that&rsquo;s  </p><p>very sustaining improving your memory improving 
inflammation improving and cardiovascular function  </p><p>I mean it goes it&rsquo;s amazing but beyond the health 
there&rsquo;s also a personal increasing your personal  </p><p>power your personal willpower because you&rsquo;re 
actually putting discipline when you&rsquo;re not  </p><p>eating for a period of time despite all this 
temptation it really improves your personal  </p><p>willpower which is actually almost equivalent 
to the body improvement so I want you to look  </p><p>beyond the short-term pleasure of it and look at 
the long-term benefits on a physical and emotional  </p><p>level of intermittent fasting because I think 
you&rsquo;ll love it there is some uncomfortableness  </p><p>in the first two weeks because you&rsquo;re adapting 
to it but you can do it on such a nice gradual  </p><p>increase that it&rsquo;s not that hard but you have to 
just be really conscious of what you&rsquo;re doing and  </p><p>not randomly just kind of eat what you want okay 
so you start with three meals a day do that for  </p><p>your period of time without snacks then graduate 
to you know eating later and later and later the  </p><p>breakfast until the point where you&rsquo;re having 
no breakfast all you&rsquo;re just doing a lunch and  </p><p>a dinner two meals so I put a link down below 
of how to do this so the next step is just to  </p><p>start well as of today I&rsquo;m just under 60 pounds 
total ah since yeah since and so for the women  </p><p>out there you guys I was killing a size 18 women and 
now I&rsquo;m in a loose size 10 wow that&rsquo;s fantastic  </p><p>you basically have a six pack AB right now right 
oh yeah absolutely I never I never really had  </p><p>six pack abs let&rsquo;s just say even when I was 170 
pounds soccer weight I didn&rsquo;t really it wasn&rsquo;t  </p><p>defined let&rsquo;s just say in terms of that you can 
kind of see the outside that you never could see  </p><p>the inside now you can definitely see the whole 
thing especially if I like flex a little bit  </p><p>that&rsquo;s very prominent and you know that definitely 
feels good I&rsquo;m proud that I&rsquo;ll have to worry about  </p><p>wearing a swim shirt when I go with my kids to 
the pool or something which I would when I was  </p><p>one 80 pounds 100 pounds of elbow embarrassed in 
that way but besides just looking better I just  </p><p>feel a hundred percent better yeah it&rsquo;s hard to 
tell how you feel really when you 180 pounds you  </p><p>know you don&rsquo;t feel good but if I could compare 
somehow get the feeling trapped in a bottle for  </p><p>both feelings at the same time it&rsquo;s so much better 
now than it right so I thought let me give my body  </p><p>a chance to adapt more than two or three months 
I did my blood test again and my cluster was at  </p><p>the normal range I was so happy you know like I 
sorry doctor like you I have two members of my  </p><p>family you know one died of a heart stroke and 
one is the disabled through the neck down just  </p><p>because of heart disease and I didn&rsquo;t want to take 
that to it because I&rsquo;m going to take start taking  </p><p>tablets I&rsquo;m going to start it oh it&rsquo;s going to 
open for me other doors like other medications  </p><p>are and but no I don&rsquo;t want to do that I wanted to 
go into ketosis and I got committed and people saw  </p><p>my results hey if you haven&rsquo;t already subscribed
