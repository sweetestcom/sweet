<p>no the vaporizer right here</p>
<p>behind the flashlight</p>
<p>good for you it&rsquo;s a good night light</p>
<p>I am completely sober right now just so you know I know</p>
<p>can you tell</p>
<p>for how long</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s only been</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s creeping up on 3 months now</p>
<p>which is but that&rsquo;s a long even a week for me</p>
<p>no but not in that way but</p>
<p>after a week I feel great</p>
<p>then another week I feel better and</p>
<p>how long has it been since you&rsquo;ve like cut</p>
<p>everything out</p>
<p>even just for a day or 2</p>
<p>I do it all the time yeah you just</p>
<p>smoke all the time no no no no not something I mean</p>
<p>oh you stop</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>need to yeah I don&rsquo;t sometimes I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smoke pot for a week or week or 2</p>
<p>oh okay especially I&rsquo;m not performing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not performing and I&rsquo;m not writing mm hmm</p>
<p>sometimes I just don&rsquo;t feel the need to know</p>
<p>I use it as a tool</p>
<p>like I use weed especially</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I was trying to tell you that</p>
<p>in the news radio</p>
<p>dance but you were giving off</p>
<p>mixed signals fella you were</p>
<p>well you were given off very very very</p>
<p>strong signals that were right on the money</p>
<p>you would just</p>
<p>scream in front of network executives</p>
<p>you fucking freak you&rsquo;re high right now</p>
<p>when you call me little</p>
<p>problems because we would try to do a</p>
<p>scene and we couldn&rsquo;t do the scene because Andy</p>
<p>literally couldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>because I was sorry</p>
<p>oh what are we doing here and you</p>
<p>would just like Andy we have to go home okay we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been here all day rehearsing we got to do this fucking</p>
<p>scene in your</p>
<p>take to the</p>
<p>gills to the gills</p>
<p>we would have fun and you know I</p>
<p>would improvise a lot</p>
<p>and now you see now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun but</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get high and do rehearsals</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get high when you&rsquo;re waiting on</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>yeah you can I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about that</p>
<p>well I mean I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s disrespectful to the people you&rsquo;re working with</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re high</p>
<p>right now and you&rsquo;re working with me but not the same</p>
<p>thing because I&rsquo;m not doing something</p>
<p>where I have to remember and recall</p>
<p>things and do</p>
<p>things in a certain order</p>
<p>I always I was always good I</p>
<p>could always remember my lines and I was always</p>
<p>right I was really</p>
<p>professionally</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember well sometimes you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and a lot of times</p>
<p>you and Paul Sims would</p>
<p>would call me out</p>
<p>when I wasn&rsquo;t high right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible I know like</p>
<p>right now my</p>
<p>energy is so high</p>
<p>I got what just</p>
<p>crying wolf</p>
<p>exactly it is like that</p>
<p>I got sober</p>
<p>these these Twitter followers</p>
<p>calling saying I&rsquo;m on cocaine right now</p>
<p>you know Charlie Sheen</p>
<p>what do you think Charlie Sheen is doing right now</p>
<p>what is he doing is he just drinking</p>
<p>or is he doing drugs I</p>
<p>well after some of I saw the one</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t see the machete</p>
<p>thing what happened with them I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about the machete</p>
<p>thing I saw the</p>
<p>photo but I&rsquo;ve been watching the you stream</p>
<p>I fucking machete in his hand like what is going</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the weirdest</p>
<p>train wreck ever the most unexpected</p>
<p>I love off the tracks into the woods</p>
<p>do you think he&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>no no no I thought but he&rsquo;s my favorite person in the</p>
<p>world right now</p>
<p>because no matter how fucked up</p>
<p>your life is you look at Charlie she and you go I&rsquo;m all</p>
<p>right finally</p>
<p>somebody is</p>
<p>overshadowing me</p>
<p>and it actually helped me get completely</p>
<p>stone cold so I was already sober when it</p>
<p>started happening</p>
<p>just like a</p>
<p>month or maybe a few weeks and it</p>
<p>started happening</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s almost like god shoving</p>
<p>me into my face like a</p>
<p>mirror into my face</p>
<p>because you know</p>
<p>I I&rsquo;ve never gotten that</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t really smoke</p>
<p>crack and I don&rsquo;t do I just</p>
<p>drink beer and I drink wine</p>
<p>by the way this morning</p>
<p>and the reason I&rsquo;m late and it really was me I was late</p>
<p>my and I didn&rsquo;t tell you that I made it</p>
<p>I did tell you</p>
<p>my assistant showed up</p>
<p>walked into my</p>
<p>kitchen I&rsquo;m like here let me get you some</p>
<p>water are you hungry I&rsquo;ll cook you some eggs</p>
<p>and then I hear a boom</p>
<p>and I turn around</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s halfway onto the counter</p>
<p>oh my God he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>fainting he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>light headed</p>
<p>I really need to feed this guy but then boom</p>
<p>right onto the</p>
<p>floor head first</p>
<p>split his head open</p>
<p>blood gushing all over puddling up</p>
<p>on my ex&rsquo;s kitchen</p>
<p>floor in the main</p>
<p>house right you know I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t live</p>
<p>there I live in the shed in the back you know my whole</p>
<p>story right</p>
<p>sort of okay well we&rsquo;ll get into it but</p>
<p>so blood and he&rsquo;s flopping around like a fish on the</p>
<p>floor of a god of and</p>
<p>him and it&rsquo;s just me and him</p>
<p>thank God the kids</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t there there&rsquo;s 4 kids</p>
<p>thank God Lena wasn&rsquo;t there they</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>even when I just recreated the</p>
<p>story for Lena</p>
<p>later that she&rsquo;s the one that lives in the</p>
<p>in the main</p>
<p>house and owns it</p>
<p>but you know I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>I pay for it but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome but any</p>
<p>and the poor kids</p>
<p>only 2 were mine</p>
<p>but anyways</p>
<p>the thing is is that</p>
<p>just me telling her the</p>
<p>story she started crying wow she was crying</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>but I had the foresight to grab a</p>
<p>paper towel</p>
<p>thing shove it</p>
<p>under his head so he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t keep boom boom</p>
<p>boom and he was</p>
<p>his eyes rolled back oh my God</p>
<p>and what is called 9 one one</p>
<p>and I had my finger down his</p>
<p>throat so I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t swallow his tongue</p>
<p>oh my God you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>heard that yeah</p>
<p>and the right away</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put anything in his mouth</p>
<p>what okay okay</p>
<p>and we went on for like</p>
<p>3 minutes I&rsquo;m like this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna die right here</p>
<p>and I got it I</p>
<p>gotta go on joe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so you just left him right no</p>
<p>I waited the paramedics came and</p>
<p>and they say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be fine he&rsquo;s in the hospital right now as we</p>
<p>speak he&rsquo;s in the hospital so is it an epileptic</p>
<p>seizure is that what it is</p>
<p>you know what it is and this is the honest to god&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truth he I made him</p>
<p>I said you can&rsquo;t work for me anymore</p>
<p>because we used to</p>
<p>drink together he was at</p>
<p>the porn awards with me</p>
<p>and that was pretty much one of the last times</p>
<p>the wheels came off I went nuts</p>
<p>there Charlie Sheen was there how long</p>
<p>ago was this</p>
<p>like 3 months ago thank</p>
<p>God and that&rsquo;s why they did a hair test and you know</p>
<p>minimal traces</p>
<p>of cocaine showed up because this goes back in 08:54</p>
<p>months right</p>
<p>but I wanted to</p>
<p>prove that I was</p>
<p>completely clean for at</p>
<p>least a couple</p>
<p>weeks so I did the</p>
<p>urine test completely</p>
<p>clean of all drugs you know this is on</p>
<p>Rumorfix com</p>
<p>oh yeah I didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>they yeah I wanted to do it I said</p>
<p>because these</p>
<p>pictures came up of me doing cocaine I went</p>
<p>those are old</p>
<p>pictures they&rsquo;re putting them up and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to pretend like it&rsquo;s happening right now</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t continue</p>
<p>to be silent</p>
<p>about it cause whenever</p>
<p>shit comes up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like whatever it&rsquo;ll blow over</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t and I</p>
<p>never try to defend myself well you have done so many</p>
<p>things though that for</p>
<p>people that are just speculating</p>
<p>know as to you I mean also enough</p>
<p>to do is bring them a</p>
<p>photo and boom it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>story it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>man and they</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s happening that</p>
<p>day well they of</p>
<p>course they</p>
<p>would though</p>
<p>you you understand how they</p>
<p>would it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>grand conspiracy I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>so what is it like to be the</p>
<p>guy that they call when someone fucking hits the wall</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re the guy man</p>
<p>when Charlie</p>
<p>Sheen hit the wall someone to get Andy Dick on the line</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here it&rsquo;s Nancy</p>
<p>Grace we have Andy Dick</p>
<p>we have stopped our</p>
<p>coverage on dead</p>
<p>babies in Florida</p>
<p>so that we can concentrate on Andy</p>
<p>dan there has been</p>
<p>we have found the</p>
<p>clones of a 2 year old but that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming</p>
<p>land and Dick</p>
<p>is in the studio</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a dead baby in Florida</p>
<p>Nancy you&rsquo;ll find on it</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s on that story</p>
<p>I wonder if she</p>
<p>does babies to make</p>
<p>to make a TV show</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t like me she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>white trash people meth</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s horrible</p>
<p>well she&rsquo;s just an</p>
<p>angry bro she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bitchy little she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem like a pleasure filled</p>
<p>happy fun person</p>
<p>no and her subject matter is so goddamn dark</p>
<p>well show it&rsquo;s dead</p>
<p>babies yeah or she talked</p>
<p>about me once when</p>
<p>the incident went down what did she say in at the</p>
<p>buffalo Wild Wings out buffalo</p>
<p>Wild Columbus</p>
<p>Ohio imagine hey that&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re there with your family</p>
<p>Andy Dick is</p>
<p>drinking on the bar with his</p>
<p>penis out in</p>
<p>front of children</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what happened what happened is</p>
<p>I was drinking a lot</p>
<p>and this is in Temecula</p>
<p>not clean oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>Columbus was you get</p>
<p>arrested for</p>
<p>drinking and</p>
<p>Temecula and you&rsquo;re not an Indian</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done some</p>
<p>crazy shit I was with an Indian</p>
<p>I swear to God</p>
<p>my drummer is an Indian American and</p>
<p>driving up here and a guy had a</p>
<p>motorcycle on he had a jacket and it said</p>
<p>sober Indian on the back of his jacket they&rsquo;re rare</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>taken a picture of that</p>
<p>they love the firewater well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unfortunate</p>
<p>that it just isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really supposedly this is how it goes but without being</p>
<p>too ignorant</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not in their DNA</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>drink it until</p>
<p>white men can</p>
<p>yeah like Asians yeah</p>
<p>like when they can&rsquo;t metabolize the</p>
<p>alcohol right when</p>
<p>Asians drink they turn they get</p>
<p>flushed up and</p>
<p>I read around a lot of fucking</p>
<p>drunk Asians</p>
<p>they get fucks but I</p>
<p>run around drunk</p>
<p>white people</p>
<p>drunk black people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they do some people get fucked</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fucked up</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all been do you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink fuck I</p>
<p>guess I do I</p>
<p>do I do shows and I</p>
<p>had like 15 shots on</p>
<p>stage in Vegas</p>
<p>and I completely</p>
<p>lost I couldn&rsquo;t moss all ability to communicate</p>
<p>I wound up looking I lied</p>
<p>on my back and I was looking around me and there&rsquo;s shot</p>
<p>glasses all the</p>
<p>stage and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still talking</p>
<p>microphone on laying down</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re laying down on</p>
<p>completely ridiculous</p>
<p>still talking in the mic</p>
<p>the problem is those wild</p>
<p>fucking shows are fun they&rsquo;re great</p>
<p>in the audience</p>
<p>because like this is really happening</p>
<p>this is some</p>
<p>theater of humanity</p>
<p>this is real shit</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the only</p>
<p>other person in the</p>
<p>world right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not good to do all the time no not all the time</p>
<p>but every once in a while</p>
<p>to have a show that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the wheels come off</p>
<p>and that fucking car is in the woods hitting</p>
<p>trees bouncing off rocks</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re the only one really laughing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re laughing</p>
<p>hysterically into the</p>
<p>microphone trying to tell</p>
<p>your stories and everyone else is just like</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not good if they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>laughing too</p>
<p>I like when the</p>
<p>wheels go off and everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wheels are off</p>
<p>I want everybody to join me in this little fucked up</p>
<p>party that happened to me in Texas</p>
<p>if you get if you&rsquo;re more</p>
<p>drunk than everybody else that&rsquo;s usually the issue</p>
<p>is there any</p>
<p>states that you can&rsquo;t go to</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>Canada Canada</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not allowed</p>
<p>in Canada I know</p>
<p>I was making a joke</p>
<p>but I really am not allowed in Canada</p>
<p>and the last time I went up</p>
<p>I was going to I was</p>
<p>I had to work</p>
<p>and a dog I was in line for customs</p>
<p>to come in and a dog</p>
<p>somebody had</p>
<p>their dog with them and I&rsquo;m like what a</p>
<p>cute dog hi</p>
<p>and I look up and the guy</p>
<p>holding the</p>
<p>leash was a police officer he&rsquo;s like come with me</p>
<p>the dog just zeroed in</p>
<p>right on me</p>
<p>with his nose</p>
<p>cause I just</p>
<p>smelled like pot I didn&rsquo;t even have it on me</p>
<p>coming out of my pores</p>
<p>dog&rsquo;s harsh</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even talk anymore the dog dry humping me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more barking noise left in its little body</p>
<p>bark barked itself horse</p>
<p>they took me in the back room and and it was it was a</p>
<p>slightly humiliating it was a strip search and</p>
<p>and then and then they found nothing had nothing</p>
<p>and they then they give you this pamphlet why me</p>
<p>he says why me something to that affected oh</p>
<p>basically why</p>
<p>was I violated</p>
<p>and then you looking and it&rsquo;s the way you were dressed</p>
<p>it was the smell of the potty</p>
<p>goddamn dog but I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s like a rape joke why me</p>
<p>dress like that</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have dressed like I mean what</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t just like a hippie he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dressed like a stony slut</p>
<p>and you smell like we did a poor little dog</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an update about my</p>
<p>but I guess I&rsquo;ll check</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fine because I&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>I was talking to him the</p>
<p>whole way here he&rsquo;s fine he&rsquo;s just in the hospital</p>
<p>and so what you were trying to say is that</p>
<p>if you stop drinking abruptly</p>
<p>you will and this is true</p>
<p>every time I&rsquo;ve gone into rehab they say</p>
<p>you need to take this pill and it&rsquo;s called Aladdin</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>why I don&rsquo;t take pills I just don&rsquo;t take pills I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Aladdin I just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like that some shit</p>
<p>they used to give people the back of the cowboy days</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I think that was like something that people</p>
<p>would get addicted to back then</p>
<p>but I tried this allotted</p>
<p>well either</p>
<p>way you take it</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get you don&rsquo;t have seizures</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t take it</p>
<p>or if you don&rsquo;t taper off like</p>
<p>if you want to stop</p>
<p>drinking and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking heavily</p>
<p>like every day and you</p>
<p>wanna stop you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotta just taper off you</p>
<p>gotta like if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking 20 a day</p>
<p>then drink 15</p>
<p>then drink 10 really</p>
<p>yeah oh yeah</p>
<p>or you got it or you</p>
<p>gotta go home</p>
<p>and because you can suck</p>
<p>no no you can die</p>
<p>from the withdrawals my friend</p>
<p>my assistant</p>
<p>could have died he</p>
<p>he hit his head so hard that</p>
<p>alone could have killed him you</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>freaking out and fucking weed is illegal right</p>
<p>yeah incredible</p>
<p>great it&rsquo;s just goddamn incredible yeah</p>
<p>cause if you had the choice between the 2</p>
<p>like if someone said do you want to have a</p>
<p>drink or have some weed</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always weed always</p>
<p>one or the other</p>

<p>into pain go</p>
<p>right up the</p>
<p>street from me that makes</p>
<p>sense who does it I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do it</p>
<p>folks I&rsquo;m gonna do it because I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>drink I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be flopping around on my</p>
<p>kitchen floor yeah</p>
<p>cracking my head open and dying</p>
<p>but anyways back then</p>
<p>20 you know</p>
<p>17 years ago he was</p>
<p>you you know what the word is angry</p>
<p>you were so fucking</p>
<p>angry it was hostile</p>
<p>and you would you</p>
<p>would attack</p>
<p>everybody and anybody even Paul Sims</p>
<p>and and but me</p>
<p>you the girls</p>
<p>would run to</p>
<p>their dressing rooms crying you know that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exaggerating crying</p>
<p>I would run to the bathroom and</p>
<p>punch holes in the wall</p>
<p>on the verge of crying</p>
<p>and and you</p>
<p>would always call me out for being high in</p>
<p>front of people</p>
<p>because you were you were straight edged</p>
<p>and and and the bottom line</p>
<p>just because I</p>
<p>was high dude it was because you were stopping work</p>
<p>no but it&rsquo;s true I never</p>
<p>I was always having fun</p>
<p>you I was afraid of</p>
<p>yeah I know you were having fun but I was</p>
<p>oftentimes having fun in</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s expenses</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that listen I am</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true that I</p>
<p>would get upset very easily at things</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t at nothing</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t you know real</p>
<p>you always had a reason</p>
<p>but my point is</p>
<p>is I didn&rsquo;t want to even go</p>
<p>to work so I was afraid of you well a lot of people are</p>
<p>upset at you Andy you know that</p>
<p>you know that everybody was</p>
<p>upset at you all the time</p>
<p>it was a constant source of struggle I love you dude I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>incredibly talented you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a wild dude and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get that kind of comedy</p>
<p>unless it comes from a real wild</p>
<p>place you know and I love that</p>
<p>about you I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re really fucking</p>
<p>funny I&rsquo;ve always said that</p>
<p>but you got to</p>
<p>understand that that comes at</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>selfish package</p>
<p>a lot of times to</p>
<p>be that wild person and you</p>
<p>oftentimes don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about how</p>
<p>other people are perceiving you</p>
<p>but I know that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been guilty</p>
<p>of that myself and I know that you have too</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re right you know and you can&rsquo;t argue a</p>
<p>professional</p>
<p>environment like that</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re just partying</p>
<p>we were supposed to be doing this show</p>
<p>and if what you&rsquo;re doing disrupts what</p>
<p>other people are doing it becomes a problem and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t love you it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re talented it&rsquo;s not that</p>
<p>I want to be</p>
<p>angry for no reason it&rsquo;s just I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>standing up for what I thought was right</p>
<p>yeah you did though</p>
<p>I hear what he&rsquo;s saying that when I first</p>
<p>moved out you were a different</p>
<p>person you just seemed very different you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>chill now you really are and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of it is the tank</p>
<p>climbing in</p>
<p>the tank I want to get in on a regular basis</p>
<p>has made me reevaluate all the there&rsquo;s a bunch of</p>
<p>different paths that we go down in our personalities</p>
<p>where we automatically</p>
<p>we get into certain</p>
<p>way let me just say that I&rsquo;m a different person too</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure in</p>
<p>17 years I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>stuck back there either well you know I&rsquo;m a lot more</p>
<p>I just I&rsquo;m just more</p>
<p>chill too I</p>
<p>think with intelligence like now</p>
<p>I you know back then I&rsquo;d be arguing</p>
<p>with you but now I&rsquo;m like you know you were right</p>
<p>maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know you were</p>
<p>I would get angry</p>
<p>you would come back and you</p>
<p>would apologize and</p>
<p>would hug it out or something</p>
<p>we were always friends</p>
<p>it was like love hate man yeah</p>
<p>but we always made up we always</p>
<p>never to the</p>
<p>point where I remember I walked into your</p>
<p>dressing room because</p>
<p>I saw it rocking</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>if this trailer&rsquo;s a rock and don&rsquo;t come a</p>
<p>knockin&rsquo;but I took it you know I went the</p>
<p>other way if this</p>
<p>trailer&rsquo;s rockin&rsquo; I</p>
<p>gotta come in and see what the hell&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in here</p>
<p>with his dick in his hand</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Joe I did</p>
<p>not have my</p>
<p>dick in my hand</p>
<p>so Andy you&rsquo;re fucked up</p>
<p>and you had your dick not even</p>
<p>hard it was flaccid</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re pulling on it in your hand</p>
<p>right in front of me</p>
<p>oh so this was like</p>
<p>was like later</p>
<p>after the show that&rsquo;s not it was</p>
<p>I was in the</p>
<p>dressing with my</p>
<p>girlfriend right I was</p>
<p>it was like a</p>
<p>trailer it was like</p>
<p>after the show</p>
<p>yes yes party</p>
<p>okay yeah that was the end of the</p>
<p>night then I can imagine me</p>
<p>look you were doing it for shits and giggles it was fun</p>
<p>you know it was half partying</p>
<p>half you were</p>
<p>crazy half half half I was attracted to you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna lie</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>other fucking dichotomy for me back then</p>
<p>I was sexually</p>
<p>attracted to you</p>
<p>and just as equally</p>
<p>fucking frightened of you</p>
<p>so I wanted to be</p>
<p>with you sexually</p>
<p>mouse was put off all</p>
<p>those barriers for you</p>
<p>buddy you really did you</p>
<p>know like you knew you my</p>
<p>subconscious</p>
<p>date on you</p>
<p>well do you remember the episode</p>
<p>where you guys</p>
<p>wrestled and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the ground rolling around were you</p>
<p>thinking that like this is the hottest</p>
<p>scene ever I</p>
<p>still I still jerk off to yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding I know but listen</p>
<p>well I didn&rsquo;t get to the point</p>
<p>where he took me he took</p>
<p>me by a couch</p>
<p>I was sitting right next to me out of douche chills</p>
<p>do you want a</p>
<p>spray bottle</p>
<p>that was back in the</p>
<p>day spray bottle just in case yeah you got me pre RL</p>
<p>for my soul come on</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not attracted like I was back then I&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>flesh loot I don&rsquo;t know what it is I</p>
<p>think maybe because you smoke a lot of pot now</p>
<p>but you puffed up a little bit you&rsquo;re puffier</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not necessarily you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still muscular and you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>strong as fuck</p>
<p>you could knock me out with one punch</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re more I&rsquo;m not as lean</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re not as disciplined</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t work out you don&rsquo;t care anymore yeah</p>
<p>well I work out but I still look good</p>
<p>like a fucking I was</p>
<p>gonna say back</p>
<p>down I was not you got to eat your I was</p>
<p>pretty disciplined with my diet you looked fucking</p>
<p>this guy with that any clothes on</p>
<p>in fucking credible but he took me to work out</p>
<p>and this is why this is why he looked like that</p>
<p>he would work out every day for how many hours</p>
<p>couple hours a day couple</p>
<p>hours a day like come on Andy cause I was working out</p>
<p>you know look at these guns come on</p>
<p>what did they say to you they say back off</p>
<p>but he took me there let me work out</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s work out you do my workout Andy</p>
<p>I go I couldn&rsquo;t do 20 minutes</p>
<p>and I But I</p>
<p>He was my ride so I had to</p>
<p>stick around and watch him work out him</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s went</p>
<p>3040 minutes into it</p>
<p>he worked out so hard</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s now over in the corner</p>
<p>with his hand on the edge of a giant</p>
<p>garbage can just vomiting</p>
<p>vomiting vomiting</p>
<p>and then he goes</p>
<p>okay I gotta have one more hour to go</p>
<p>like he kept working out he worked out to the</p>
<p>point where you vomit that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>crazy well the only I</p>
<p>threw up the other day the kettlebell work on threw up</p>
<p>you out to the point</p>
<p>if you push yourself</p>
<p>over that line</p>
<p>where every</p>
<p>left your whole body shaking</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not vomiting it&rsquo;s not a workout</p>
<p>your instincts are telling you to stop</p>
<p>you have to push through those instincts</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>the mind has to use the body like it&rsquo;s a car</p>
<p>do you have to be able to stomp on that gas as the</p>
<p>wheels are spinning and trying to get out of the mud</p>
<p>you gotta keep the fucking pedal to the floor</p>
<p>forget about what the engines won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you gotta keep and you gotta</p>
<p>treat your body</p>
<p>like that that&rsquo;s the only way your body really</p>
<p>truly becomes</p>
<p>strong do you take pills dude like creatine all that</p>
<p>steroids and I took a lot of different</p>
<p>stuff now no now I take</p>
<p>human growth hormone and testosterone I go for</p>
<p>hormone replacement therapy</p>
<p>why do you think you need more testosterone</p>
<p>no no I&rsquo;m just worried</p>
<p>about you more</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what it does is you take it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>light dose to cream</p>
<p>where all it does is keep you at healthy levels</p>
<p>see I like soy milk and Ediname</p>
<p>he likes everything that makes you produce</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on birth</p>
<p>control I got nice</p>
<p>tits right now and my pussy boners hard that&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>those 2 things</p>
<p>make you turn you into a woman I know you suck</p>
<p>I like both of those things too and it sucks</p>
<p>it really yeah you got to take some like</p>
<p>tribuluous with that</p>
<p>I so do are</p>
<p>these injections that yeah</p>
<p>the testosterone</p>
<p>is no it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>let me ask you though is</p>
<p>is this stuff is your heart okay yeah</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s your heart</p>
<p>have you had your</p>
<p>heart tested of course what</p>
<p>about bones do</p>
<p>I heard that over time that</p>
<p>weakens your bones does it weaken your bone</p>
<p>in like arthritis or something like that</p>
<p>it probably does wonders for your boner</p>
<p>well it does wonders for your body</p>
<p>like if you get an injection</p>
<p>this is soft</p>
<p>you just get rock hard</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do injections it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cream it&rsquo;s a very do you rub the</p>
<p>cream on your boner no I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give me a little of that you</p>
<p>can certainly</p>
<p>work with that cream</p>
<p>if you jerked off with that</p>
<p>cream did you imagine what</p>
<p>would happen have you ever</p>
<p>like run out</p>
<p>of whatever you jerk off with I like use like</p>
<p>Astral Glide</p>
<p>that would be a good sponsor</p>
<p>well we got</p>
<p>Fleshloop we already have</p>
<p>flashlight oh</p>
<p>we have Fleshloop</p>
<p>fleshloop well I&rsquo;d like to talk to them too</p>
<p>but anyhow have</p>
<p>you ever run out and then you have to use something</p>
<p>you have to go around your</p>
<p>house cause you just need to jerk off</p>
<p>what is the</p>
<p>weirdest thing you&rsquo;ve ever used</p>
<p>the juice that comes</p>
<p>with Bologna</p>
<p>is really good</p>
<p>slimy I&rsquo;m pretty</p>
<p>standard when</p>
<p>it comes to jerking off</p>
<p>the juice that comes with Bologna</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s slimy are</p>
<p>you serious yeah it&rsquo;s like that said</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>Brian that&rsquo;s so typical</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so used to the way he says</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely disgusting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I went</p>
<p>par for the course for a</p>
<p>Brian answer</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so used to it</p>
<p>mine I think the</p>
<p>weirdest was olive oil</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even that weird</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s healthy yeah that</p>
<p>would actually be good for your skin</p>
<p>D H E A and</p>
<p>shit spit I&rsquo;ve used</p>
<p>spits it sucks because I accept</p>
<p>work to get back to this hormone conversation</p>
<p>is kind of an important subject I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I like the jerk off I want to</p>
<p>think about I want to</p>
<p>think about your dick</p>
<p>listen fella</p>
<p>so you can think</p>
<p>about all you like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved them</p>
<p>this is for sure the strangest podcast ever</p>
<p>human growth hormone gay SEC</p>
<p>what happens is as you get</p>
<p>older like say if you have</p>
<p>a hypothyroidism your thyroid stops producing a certain</p>
<p>amount of thyroid hormone they just supplement it</p>
<p>they give you you know</p>
<p>synthroid or whatever</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have that I do have that too yeah</p>
<p>everybody does when you get to a certain age</p>
<p>your your body</p>
<p>stops producing</p>
<p>as much remember you you had you had the yeah I</p>
<p>still have that vitiligo still</p>
<p>but you used to have</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s gone no yeah you went off on my face</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>bonus yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s a supreme that you put on it it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>pro topic ointment</p>
<p>and you have to</p>
<p>catch it right away</p>
<p>and there was some</p>
<p>other stuff you</p>
<p>could do you</p>
<p>could do with</p>
<p>light treatments</p>
<p>and shit like that but I had mine mine is very</p>
<p>mild I heard that it was because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re rapid you&rsquo;re like oh your body&rsquo;s overworking</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s an immune system</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s autoimmune system</p>
<p>yeah they don&rsquo;t know exactly what causes it</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>like Michael Jackson</p>
<p>had a horrible way he had it all over his</p>
<p>whole body I just have it on my knuckles</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t get pigment in your skin</p>
<p>and it just</p>
<p>turns what it is is</p>
<p>your immune</p>
<p>system is fighting</p>
<p>against your pigment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I was saying</p>
<p>so your immune</p>
<p>system is over my</p>
<p>whole body is just in a battle</p>
<p>all the time</p>
<p>his immune system is attacking</p>
<p>things that shouldn&rsquo;t be attacking but</p>
<p>just explain this</p>
<p>human growth hormone</p>
<p>thing when you go for just like</p>
<p>him he attacks</p>
<p>things he shouldn&rsquo;t be attacking</p>
<p>well not anymore though</p>
<p>not since not</p>
<p>since pot thank</p>
<p>God for pot go</p>
<p>and you get</p>
<p>blood test done and they find out what your levels are</p>
<p>testosterone</p>
<p>you should go</p>
<p>I should totally go but</p>
<p>tell you that you&rsquo;re a girl well that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a girl it&rsquo;s the girl</p>
<p>cause girl girls</p>
<p>sense it the girls</p>
<p>sense it and girls love to fuck girls</p>
<p>so you they have the</p>
<p>sense you really</p>
<p>do you really have</p>
<p>huh do you really have man I have</p>
<p>large nipples but not boobies let me can let me see</p>
<p>let me see let me see</p>
<p>anyway what happens is you go and you get a</p>
<p>blood test they find out all your</p>
<p>levels and it makes you feel so much better to get</p>
<p>you know a normal</p>
<p>level of testosterone</p>
<p>normal level</p>
<p>of you know IGF all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>things all these different</p>
<p>things that keep you healthy</p>
<p>should I go in and do this for sure but</p>
<p>for what and everybody goes</p>
<p>great this is</p>
<p>this is what happens look you got it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dying okay I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>40 something years old</p>
<p>45 eventually you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be 60</p>
<p>eventually gonna be dead there&rsquo;s just no stopping that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just how it&rsquo;s always been</p>
<p>how what have you done</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the way it is right</p>
<p>and people go why</p>
<p>would you supplement hormones</p>
<p>well because</p>
<p>it makes your body operate like a younger body</p>
<p>because it gives your body the</p>
<p>things that it&rsquo;s missing mm hmm</p>
<p>and people go</p>
<p>well what happens if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>if you do that you know what if it fucks up your body</p>
<p>first of all there&rsquo;s no evidence that it does and</p>
<p>second of all if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just gonna grow</p>
<p>weak and die</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s not simple to me to me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like a pragmatic choice but how old are you now 43</p>
<p>oh I didn&rsquo;t know we were that</p>
<p>close in age</p>
<p>yeah and you feel like 1,000,000</p>

<p>right vitamins</p>
<p>lots of lots of vegetables lots I mean</p>
<p>I stay really healthy liquefied</p>

<p>i love everything up to the last half hour when they</p>
<p>threw his kids in there for like</p>
<p>so they can</p>
<p>have health insurance or something there was like</p>
<p>no reason for</p>
<p>the last half hour this</p>

<p>but you know yeah it does</p>
<p>it has like five different endings that goes on but</p>
<p>basically just</p>

<p>where i&rsquo;m staying</p>
<p>at a stranger&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house that he had never met</p>
<p>and it was looking down onto a computer screen</p>
<p>and on the computer screen</p>
<p>was the poster for</p>
<p>brokeback mountain</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s freaked me out he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s staying</p>
<p>at some gay guys</p>
<p>house wow isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>weird that i</p>
<p>would freak out</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s funny that you</p>
<p>would freak out</p>
<p>about it why</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you did it happened</p>
<p>to me naturally you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want it to happen to him</p>
<p>is that what it is</p>
<p>i know that i know how straight all my kids are</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t want them</p>
<p>to be to be</p>
<p>taken advantage of</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>think you feel like someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna catch him</p>
<p>while he&rsquo;s vulnerable</p>
<p>or maybe or</p>
<p>slip something in his</p>
<p>drink or some</p>
<p>steroids isn&rsquo;t that like and he&rsquo;s a handsome girl</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that a big thrill</p>
<p>for a lot of gay guys</p>
<p>to get a straight guy to do something</p>
<p>yeah yeah because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what i did</p>
<p>with you every guy</p>

<p>might be one of the straightest guys i&rsquo;ve ever met</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve got to see that boner</p>

<p>i know this</p>
<p>gay guy joe i know this gay guy that does hair</p>
<p>and he goes to people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house to do hair and he</p>
<p>every time he does a guy</p>
<p>he tries to fucking</p>
<p>sleep with the guy or do something</p>
<p>he says that</p>
<p>like one out of five people actually</p>
<p>do it they do like straight guys</p>
<p>dude there was a dude i worked with</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to mention</p>

<p>thank you marijuana it&rsquo;s marijuana it&rsquo;s also the tank</p>
<p>going in the tank</p>
<p>on a regular</p>
<p>basis we&rsquo;re not at your house no</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s real simple there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>place down here in burbank called soothing solutions</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a place in venice that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>place it&rsquo;s called the</p>
<p>float lab and if you go to the</p>
<p>floatlab com</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see what they have there</p>
<p>i want to go to my favorite</p>
<p>place called joe rogan&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>can i go eventually</p>
<p>like do you have to change the</p>
<p>water every time yes</p>
<p>every time no no you don&rsquo;t change the</p>
<p>water every time</p>
<p>it goes through a filter</p>
<p>system oh okay</p>
<p>every time i turn the</p>
<p>thing on how much was it</p>
<p>the tank itself yeah</p>
<p>everything is</p>
<p>about eight thousand dollars</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s not bad but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still very expensive</p>
<p>expensive and but it&rsquo;s laying down long ways yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely invaluable to me you&rsquo;re laying down yeah</p>
<p>okay yeah it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>giant bed like a bed</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like four feet wide and</p>
<p>paid me seven or</p>
<p>eight feet long salt water yeah</p>
<p>oh really 800</p>
<p>pounds of salt is in the</p>
<p>water so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you float you</p>
<p>float and it&rsquo;s heated the same temperature as your skin</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>sensor experience</p>
<p>or no sensor</p>
<p>input rather</p>
<p>the top part of your body is out of the yes exactly and</p>
<p>you can breathe you can</p>
<p>breathe your ears</p>
<p>are underwater</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>other people do</p>
<p>and the guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a friend of mine who set up the tank for me</p>
<p>not only did</p>
<p>he he had this</p>
<p>crazy experience</p>
<p>where he kept waking up</p>
<p>inside of dreams</p>
<p>like he had a</p>
<p>dream and then boom</p>
<p>he would wake up and realize oh my god i was</p>
<p>dreaming then boom and wake up no you were</p>
<p>dreaming again</p>
<p>about waking up from dreaming</p>
<p>like he thought and then he realized it was in the tank</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome you know like you when you</p>
<p>strip away all the input</p>
<p>all the sensory</p>
<p>input you&rsquo;re just left with the mind</p>
<p>outside of the body</p>
<p>your brain literally is unconnected to your</p>
<p>body because it&rsquo;s not getting any information from it</p>
<p>in la it&rsquo;s over simulated</p>
<p>everywhere new york</p>
<p>city in our</p>

<p>you need to try it man that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>point you can</p>

<p>funny about andy</p>
<p>is when i do</p>
<p>open mics you know we&rsquo;re always talking</p>
<p>about different</p>
<p>comics and stuff but</p>
<p>every time we</p>
<p>anyone talks</p>
<p>about andy dick</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always like</p>
<p>dude andy dick was at my</p>
<p>house last night he was just walking around going</p>
<p>hey do you guys got beer and then he just went into the</p>
<p>apartment he hung out for like</p>
<p>five hours like</p>
<p>every single person has a</p>
<p>story like that</p>
<p>did you at one time used to just wander the</p>
<p>just last year</p>
<p>i do these things called someone attack you</p>
<p>did someone beat you up or attack you or something like</p>
<p>that a tmz guy i pushed i pushed his</p>
<p>camera away</p>
<p>and he got mad and</p>
<p>actually i grabbed his mic</p>
<p>snapped it off</p>
<p>and then i was</p>
<p>like talking into it but it wasn&rsquo;t attached</p>
<p>and so what did he do he pushed me over pushed me</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s on it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>so that is not you salt</p>
<p>yeah if i wanted to but you know what</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t win</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d win well no</p>
<p>nobody would believe me was there a</p>
<p>video they&rsquo;re out</p>
<p>you really not</p>
<p>allowed to be just shoving people like that i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>yeah he shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the only way you&rsquo;re supposed to ever</p>
<p>shove someone is if they get in your face</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re protecting yourself i</p>
<p>think yeah i think</p>
<p>when you come up to someone and just</p>
<p>shove he shot me</p>
<p>my back did you hear</p>
<p>about that woman that got</p>
<p>knocked out</p>
<p>i think it was in new york</p>
<p>a guy and a</p>
<p>woman were arguing over a parking spot</p>
<p>and the chick was four feet 11 100</p>
<p>pounds and the guy was a</p>
<p>small guy too he was only like</p>
<p>150 pounds but he</p>
<p>punched her</p>
<p>she hit him a</p>
<p>bunch of times and then he</p>
<p>punched her and</p>
<p>knocked her</p>
<p>unconscious and she fell back and</p>
<p>bounced her head off the concrete</p>
<p>and now she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucked she&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>bleeding in the</p>
<p>brain they had to remove a section</p>
<p>of her brain</p>
<p>all over a fucking parking spot and she started</p>
<p>first though she hit him well supposedly that&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>story but who</p>
<p>knows what will remember the guy was a felon</p>
<p>and he had aggravated assault</p>
<p>charges he had a</p>
<p>bunch of charges already in his past so he was</p>
<p>obviously not a fucking</p>
<p>preacher you know it wasn&rsquo;t a choir boy</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s so sad when you know you hear</p>
<p>about violence over nothing like that</p>
<p>remember a few</p>
<p>maybe five years ago there was that road rage incident</p>
<p>where people i knew one of the people</p>
<p>barely i can&rsquo;t even remember the who he was</p>
<p>and they got out of their cars</p>
<p>to continue</p>
<p>screaming at each</p>
<p>other and then</p>
<p>the one guy took out a</p>
<p>knife and stabbed him oh</p>
<p>right god road rage</p>
<p>a friend of mine</p>
<p>a friend of mine when he was in high school</p>
<p>there was a kid who was imported</p>
<p>to the school from jamaica i came from jamaica</p>
<p>and like imported straight</p>
<p>we was imported he came from another country</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that what it is</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t import students</p>
<p>you import products</p>
<p>so you import this psychopath</p>
<p>this guy anyway</p>
<p>they get in a fight</p>
<p>an argument</p>
<p>about something they go outside</p>
<p>kid pulls out a fucking</p>
<p>giant kitchen knife</p>
<p>like a big jamaican guy a</p>
<p>jamaican guy a jamaican</p>
<p>guy and just stabs the fuck out of this kid</p>
<p>while these</p>
<p>suburban high</p>
<p>school kids are</p>
<p>freaking out and screaming</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s ever seen any violence at all</p>
<p>a little fist fight</p>
<p>this guy pulls out a</p>
<p>knife he&rsquo;s coming straight from jamaica</p>
<p>and just stabs the fuck out of his kid</p>
<p>no he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>die but he was in the hospital for almost a year</p>
<p>like he had to have like 10 different</p>
<p>surgeries his</p>
<p>whole body was just i mean he</p>
<p>stabbed him like four or five</p>
<p>times in the guts</p>
<p>and the guy</p>
<p>literally you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got cut open like a fish i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never be the</p>
<p>same thinking</p>
<p>of stabbing in the guts</p>
<p>what i never did hear</p>

<p>with you on man tv in nineteen ninety four and i</p>
<p>just hung out with you a few times at comedy clubs and</p>
<p>stuff and i went</p>
<p>to see him at the i mean i don&rsquo;t know him enough to be</p>
<p>to be exactly the same with me and</p>
<p>charlie sheen</p>
<p>really hung</p>
<p>out a little little bit</p>
<p>than when i was having my darkest hour</p>
<p>during less than perfect and</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>literally said go into rehab or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fired and i went</p>
<p>then just fire me i mean</p>
<p>it was that dark and</p>
<p>they brought</p>
<p>charlie sheen in</p>
<p>machine they brought</p>
<p>him in talk to you but</p>
<p>he was sober at the time and he really did help me i</p>
<p>started doing</p>
<p>meanings i got sober and he helped me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember i just remember</p>
<p>thinking oh this is cool charlie</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>badass it was a fucking cool and you take a</p>
<p>picture with them put them on your facebook no their</p>
<p>facebook wasn&rsquo;t around yet even</p>
<p>but but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why i reached out to him because i all the</p>
<p>all my people are saying you</p>
<p>gotta help your boy and</p>
<p>the same thing</p>
<p>that my boy and he helped me up and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>who am i being</p>
<p>selfish here so i&rsquo;m called</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know his number i don&rsquo;t know how to</p>
<p>reach him but then</p>
<p>when he was on howard</p>
<p>stern i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>oh i have howard&rsquo;s number i can just call now</p>
<p>right and so i called in but i was calling</p>
<p>i was calling from the shed</p>
<p>and i had a really shitty</p>
<p>connection and</p>
<p>not out oh no</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like oh hey</p>
<p>buddy and we</p>
<p>started to talk</p>
<p>and then oh</p>
<p>shit i could have helped</p>
<p>and then they put then i really</p>
<p>think that you</p>
<p>could have helped</p>
<p>possibly had i got on the</p>
<p>phone because</p>
<p>if i can get over there</p>
<p>and my energy</p>
<p>is infectious if i can get over there</p>
<p>he i could i</p>
<p>think i could get him to stop i tell you what</p>
<p>i got my assistant to stop</p>
<p>drinking then he had you had a fucking</p>
<p>seizure on my</p>
<p>kitchen floor</p>
<p>but i just said that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>the more reasons that you really need to fucking stop</p>
<p>right a long period of time</p>
<p>right but it seems like charlie sheen</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>i mean the way he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>behaving and acting</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got this</p>
<p>crazy like i&rsquo;m invincible</p>
<p>thing going</p>
<p>on yeah something&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happens is that a manic</p>
<p>thing what is that yeah the ego i don&rsquo;t know it i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>i mean he admits he smokes</p>
<p>these rocks</p>
<p>these seven</p>
<p>gram rocks do you know how much that is</p>
<p>that would be</p>
<p>about i would say</p>
<p>to under this</p>
<p>much cocaine</p>
<p>and not just snorting</p>
<p>little smoking</p>
<p>smoking rocks</p>
<p>how he&rsquo;s like an</p>
<p>ox well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna suffer</p>
<p>in his older</p>
<p>years oh yeah</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s suffering right now</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve known you can come back</p>
<p>you can bounce back</p>
<p>i mean i think</p>
<p>people that back in the day had</p>
<p>heavy cocaine</p>
<p>habits and they</p>
<p>almost all developed</p>
<p>neurological problems</p>
<p>like like fucking parkinson&rsquo;s and all kinds of show</p>
<p>guys who have like</p>
<p>heavy duty like hollywood</p>
<p>style smoking it and</p>
<p>they get fucked</p>
<p>with richard pryor</p>
<p>those guys they get fucked up when they get older</p>
<p>oh yeah you know</p>
<p>i was wondering i was</p>
<p>wondering if michael j</p>
<p>foxes even remember he made that</p>
<p>movie bright</p>
<p>lights big city</p>
<p>where i was like</p>
<p>you would remember that</p>
<p>he was like in the bathroom</p>
<p>we dropped in the toilet</p>
<p>and like i wonder if he that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>by the same guy who made american psycho isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it by the</p>
<p>bread east and</p>
<p>ellis didn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>write that as well</p>
<p>i like he did he writes</p>
<p>all those goddamn</p>
<p>crazy dark movies not all of them but he</p>
<p>writes i didn&rsquo;t like american psycho</p>
<p>you did what</p>
<p>the book sue me</p>
<p>i remember getting in an argument with someone</p>
<p>not an argument</p>
<p>but rather a disagreement with someone</p>
<p>about the book</p>
<p>where they were saying all he does is like describe all</p>
<p>these really fucked up scenes</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like man i couldn&rsquo;t disagree more</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s making he&rsquo;s not passing any judgment all the</p>
<p>things he sees and describes to you</p>
<p>but i wouldn&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s just making a</p>
<p>bunch of shit up</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>accurately painting</p>
<p>a character</p>
<p>assessment of a fucking sociopath</p>
<p>a psychopath</p>
<p>like to me it seemed like</p>
<p>he was making</p>
<p>yeah he was making all the</p>
<p>connections the way a psychopath</p>
<p>would make it</p>
<p>i thought it was brilliant</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s a lot of people that don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>those kind of movies</p>
<p>the violence and</p>
<p>the death and the</p>
<p>blood that doesn&rsquo;t bother me</p>
<p>i like that part there&rsquo;s just really</p>
<p>you gotta admit there was no</p>
<p>story less than zero or american psycho</p>
<p>american psycho</p>
<p>less than zero well</p>
<p>american psycho the book had more of a story</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the case you know you try to whittle down</p>
<p>a book into a couple</p>
<p>hours of film it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>what was the last film you liked</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t ask me because i haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>been to a movie in a</p>
<p>while i liked</p>

<p>hang on just here we go</p>
<p>um well you know what when you</p>
<p>drink as much beers i do</p>
<p>right i thought it was something</p>
<p>else i thought you peed on a person or something no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not like that well</p>
<p>the lines that you</p>
<p>boom won&rsquo;t cross</p>
<p>so now you&rsquo;ve been sober for</p>
<p>three months are you doing</p>
<p>a program what are you doing yes what are you doing</p>
<p>the program</p>
<p>alcohol ox anonymous is that what it is</p>
<p>or narcotics anonymous</p>
<p>if it was i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s anonymous oh</p>
<p>but you told me you&rsquo;re doing a program</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like just a</p>
<p>secret p90x let&rsquo;s call it yeah</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call p90x</p>
<p>no no i have i yeah i&rsquo;m doing i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>everything everything</p>
<p>known to man</p>
<p>they can do</p>
<p>everything known i&rsquo;ve always you can assume</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing a</p>
<p>okay i&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by</p>
<p>those those</p>
<p>those programs that try to</p>
<p>reset the way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking they were they approach that they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>would they do they were give you patterns</p>
<p>at the very</p>
<p>least it was positive</p>
<p>thinking that&rsquo;s at the very</p>
<p>least right</p>
<p>at the very most</p>
<p>at the very most i don&rsquo;t know what you believe in</p>
<p>spiritually but at the very most you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>making like a conscious</p>
<p>contact with god</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s at the very most</p>
<p>and then but</p>
<p>at the very</p>
<p>least if it&rsquo;s if it&rsquo;s positive thinking</p>
<p>fuck it that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good enough sure you know if you&rsquo;re praying</p>
<p>then pray prayer at the very least is</p>
<p>positive thoughts you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not sitting there</p>
<p>worrying or</p>
<p>or or or being</p>
<p>angry you&rsquo;re praying you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at the once</p>
<p>again i&rsquo;ll say one more time</p>
<p>at the very</p>
<p>least your positive</p>
<p>thinking remember that back in the 70s</p>
<p>positive thinking yeah yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m writing i love joe rogan</p>
<p>should i write i love joe rogan</p>
<p>stay on the subject</p>
<p>i wanna know</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like what is it like when you go into this</p>
<p>thing and you have to sort of</p>
<p>submit okay i have a problem</p>
<p>you know well the</p>
<p>weird thing for me</p>
<p>about the program and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna say it</p>
<p>again it fucking</p>
<p>works if you</p>
<p>submit and you subscribe and you you let go</p>
<p>and let them</p>
<p>they literally in the program they say let us</p>
<p>think for you let us hold you up let us</p>
<p>be let us love you</p>
<p>until you love yourself and</p>
<p>like let us love you</p>
<p>until you learn to love yourself</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fucking awesome</p>
<p>you get these people in there</p>
<p>fifty years sober</p>
<p>twenty years sober even one year sober</p>
<p>even i have</p>
<p>three months even the guy that has four</p>
<p>months sober</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like wow this guy</p>
<p>i wanna hang out with him he&rsquo;s got one more</p>
<p>month of me</p>
<p>but you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>the guy that has that knows the program inside and now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had three years of sobriety</p>
<p>in a row you</p>
<p>know that that&rsquo;s when i did the antidic show</p>
<p>three years sober i don&rsquo;t know if you know that hmm</p>
<p>three years now</p>
<p>the other thing</p>
<p>is is i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>this is me personally i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna preface</p>
<p>it by saying once</p>
<p>again it works</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen people</p>
<p>get sober and stay sober</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen people</p>
<p>go into the program and if they drop out of the program</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>right right so so but the</p>
<p>thing that that</p>
<p>weirds me out and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing and it&rsquo;s an american</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>they call they call it</p>
<p>a disease okay this is</p>
<p>where i start getting weird</p>
<p>so if alcoholism is a disease</p>
<p>i have a disease</p>
<p>so it has to be treated</p>
<p>and it has to be treated by</p>
<p>in the program there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>things there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>steps and and that&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>treat it like in cancer</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>the i don&rsquo;t know what you</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>when people get cancer and they get radiation or they</p>
<p>or the chemotherapy or whatever like that</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe in all that</p>
<p>stuff i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other ways to do it you know like the gerson</p>
<p>therapy you know</p>
<p>about that but</p>
<p>chemotherapy</p>
<p>is incredibly effective</p>
<p>on people that have cancer</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>people alive</p>
<p>today because</p>
<p>i agree certainly</p>
<p>organic diets and all</p>
<p>those things are</p>
<p>absolutely fantastic for</p>
<p>you but they&rsquo;re pretty goddamn good with chemotherapy</p>
<p>these days it can it can really help yeah</p>
<p>yep you know</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re saying though</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re much better off having a very healthy diet and</p>
<p>nutrient rich diet and you&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>avoid a lot of</p>
<p>stuff well watch the movie</p>
<p>it was a call a beautiful</p>
<p>truth or the beautiful</p>
<p>truth it&rsquo;s about the</p>
<p>curse and therapy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll okay but anyhow</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s the dichotomy that</p>
<p>bugs the fucking</p>
<p>shit out of me the disease</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m diseased</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s just take me</p>
<p>and you dick</p>
<p>so the law look</p>
<p>at that look at that poor fool he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s got a disease</p>
<p>right alcoholism</p>
<p>so then when i&rsquo;m on the streets of hollywood</p>
<p>in the midst</p>
<p>and in the throes</p>
<p>t h r o e s</p>
<p>that when i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>right there in</p>
<p>the middle of my disease</p>
<p>up to my eyeballs in</p>
<p>the sickness of it all and</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about is like</p>
<p>stumbling around and i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know like help me</p>
<p>why do people</p>
<p>laugh at that</p>
<p>and take pictures of it</p>
<p>oh come on you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>dumb you know exactly why they do it but that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>freak show that exactly but that&rsquo;s the economy</p>
<p>if you saw if you saw somebody with</p>
<p>with multiple sclerosis with</p>
<p>those with those</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>that with those</p>
<p>those those um</p>
<p>sticks that you walk with you and go</p>
<p>haha look at him</p>
<p>taking videos</p>
<p>way over simplifying</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s not that simple it&rsquo;s not is something</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s i am</p>
<p>simplifying it&rsquo;s that simple</p>
<p>they that you&rsquo;d have much more sympathy</p>
<p>and much more</p>
<p>compassion for somebody who really does have a disease</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the my point</p>
<p>so so do i have a disease or not you fucking assholes</p>
<p>listen if yeah if you don&rsquo;t feel good</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re sick and if you have issues it&rsquo;s a disease</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a mental disease of addiction it&rsquo;s a disease</p>
<p>any addiction</p>
<p>to jerking off is a disease do you have that how</p>
<p>often do you jerk off</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m pretty good</p>
<p>about it just like once a day no more than once a day</p>
<p>what about your girl</p>
<p>i fuck her every day</p>
<p>whenever i want to</p>
<p>settle down</p>
<p>creepy motherfucker</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sending addiction</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have an addiction</p>
<p>issue in that regard</p>
<p>i have addictions</p>
<p>to games i have addictions i get addictions to</p>
<p>activities what&rsquo;s your favorite game right now</p>

<p>weird so what a</p>
<p>bizarre human</p>

<p>i got this gigantic</p>
<p>queen bed that takes up half the</p>
<p>thing so now i&rsquo;m getting a</p>

<p>i&rsquo;ll send you</p>
<p>pictures you</p>
<p>gonna do like a youtube video</p>
<p>andy dix cribs i</p>
<p>just invite you over</p>
<p>i thought about doing</p>
<p>the you stream you know when you stream</p>
<p>first came out i was on it for</p>
<p>i was addicted</p>
<p>to it i was sober because i was wearing that</p>
<p>ankle thing</p>
<p>there was another</p>
<p>whole year i had somebody</p>
<p>lindsay lohaned</p>
<p>ankle thing she wore it</p>
<p>for a month</p>
<p>i wore that fucking</p>
<p>thing for a year you fuck</p>
<p>a year fucking year it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>horrible they made</p>
<p>you be sober for a year yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not even that i</p>
<p>could have swede</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on that thing</p>
<p>i found that out like</p>
<p>in the last month</p>
<p>i was so fucking</p>
<p>cause there was only a month left</p>
<p>but i was fine have a great day</p>
<p>so you thought that it was only everything</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s only alcohol</p>
<p>then i don&rsquo;t know why i finally said wait a minute</p>
<p>and then i looked online i</p>
<p>asked a bunch of people</p>
<p>and i tested and i was</p>
<p>scared shitless</p>
<p>lindsey went to jail</p>
<p>if you drink on it you go to jail</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like jail jail</p>
<p>is unpleasant what was the</p>
<p>rumor that she had gotten</p>
<p>it from kombucha tea</p>
<p>because kombucha</p>
<p>tea is fermented</p>
<p>but do you remember that</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t remember that but that that would be</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re saying because</p>
<p>kombucha they pulled it off the shelves</p>
<p>gts kombucha they pulled their</p>
<p>hat off i know</p>
<p>about that but even if it&rsquo;s even if it did so they</p>
<p>can tell yeah</p>
<p>because you can tell my name</p>
<p>because mine went</p>
<p>off a couple times when i was performing at nightclubs</p>
<p>because of the booze</p>
<p>vapors just coming up from the</p>
<p>floor what but they</p>
<p>can tell it was so minute</p>
<p>like it wasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>a shot of booze</p>
<p>vapor that comes that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s pretty it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming out of your pool</p>
<p>pretty sensitive yeah</p>
<p>very sensitive</p>
<p>how do you know did you have to wear one no i just know</p>
<p>about it i asked around</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe i wore it for a year you wore</p>
<p>it for a whole year</p>
<p>what did you</p>
<p>get arrested for that you had to wear it for a year</p>
<p>what was it</p>
<p>oh no that was the one i was talking about earlier</p>
<p>in buffalo wild wings into in</p>
<p>temecula and i couldn&rsquo;t talk about it</p>
<p>ever so i could never</p>
<p>tell my side right but the way they describe it</p>
<p>is that i went up to this girl and ripped her top down</p>
<p>and not true at all i might someone&rsquo;s baby</p>
<p>andy dick rips her top down</p>
<p>in the middle of wild wings it didn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>first of all wild wings you know</p>
<p>she shouldn&rsquo;t have been there after hours it&rsquo;s a bar</p>
<p>and what did happen the thing is is that she was 17</p>
<p>she wanted an autograph and a hug and i gave her a hug</p>
<p>and that was it and then she said</p>
<p>that i ripped her</p>
<p>shirt you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say anything creepy to her no</p>
<p>maybe i said oh you&rsquo;re so beautiful i&rsquo;m always</p>
<p>complimenting everybody i always feel</p>
<p>obligated and the thing is that she was like overweight</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t very</p>
<p>attractive so you think and i always feel</p>
<p>obligated to give people compliments</p>
<p>like they need and they want it and it really</p>
<p>validates them if it&rsquo;s coming from a celebrity you</p>
<p>ever feel that</p>
<p>that you feel</p>
<p>obligated to be like</p>
<p>why i definitely feel</p>
<p>obligated to be nice to people but i want to i</p>
<p>think you have a unique opportunity i know</p>
<p>someone to make them feel good</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what i was</p>
<p>doing and then she fucking flipped it around</p>
<p>so she was just</p>
<p>crazy so we nuts</p>
<p>and then and and and it&rsquo;s proven because</p>
<p>her friend called me</p>

<p>and then he</p>
<p>starts he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally just</p>
<p>tripping out and then he goes into a</p>
<p>dream and he&rsquo;s i</p>

<p>giving him a banana</p>
<p>unveiled him go</p>

<p>and then steven reed is</p>
<p>zipping up the zipper and</p>
<p>going you&rsquo;re done</p>
<p>there was nothing</p>
<p>wrong with your</p>
<p>teeth you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>done you&rsquo;re fine move it&rsquo;s such a good episode it</p>
<p>was so hardcore</p>
<p>i love that</p>
<p>show even roots</p>
<p>stuck his dick in</p>
<p>louis c case</p>
<p>mouth as a dentist it must happen</p>
<p>all the time it does it happened to a friend of mine i</p>
<p>wrote a song</p>
<p>about it yeah what happened</p>
<p>he said that he got put</p>
<p>under but then he said that he liked it</p>
<p>and he would go back</p>
<p>he said he got put under</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where the dentist fucked him</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>he said he liked it he kept going back</p>
<p>he said he learned to like it and probably</p>
<p>learn to like if he was out cold how does he</p>
<p>learn to like you wake up with coming right</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t know if he was alcohol i think</p>
<p>if i said that i take it back</p>
<p>i think he just got to the</p>
<p>place where it was he was just so</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>stuff is hardcore</p>
<p>i remember what is it called</p>
<p>nitrous oxide</p>
<p>nitrous oxide</p>
<p>i take it when if i have i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t gone</p>
<p>to the dentist in years i really just i used to</p>
<p>sell it i&rsquo;m afraid of it</p>
<p>but i remember just</p>
<p>i would always say i</p>
<p>would take it on your own without</p>
<p>a dentist no</p>
<p>no no at the dentist&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>i would say</p>
<p>i would feel it and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna i still</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t feel anything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i</p>
<p>would make them</p>
<p>turn it up and i can hear it going</p>
<p>i can hear it</p>
<p>going on i&rsquo;m like i still</p>
<p>i still i really i still feel</p>
<p>completely normal but really i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>starting to roll</p>

<p>who had also been into that</p>
<p>kind of shit he&rsquo;s like into being a shaman and all that</p>
<p>stuff he&rsquo;s drinking his</p>
<p>urine when he&rsquo;s done mushroom trips</p>
<p>and he told me because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you get really high</p>
<p>when you do a mushroom trip</p>
<p>when you urinate the</p>
<p>psilocybin actually comes out in your</p>
<p>urine and then you drink that</p>
<p>again and it reprocessed through</p>
<p>system and you just go bob</p>
<p>boom we just</p>
<p>shoot you through</p>
<p>the wall that&rsquo;s something i</p>
<p>might do yeah it</p>

<p>radio show it&rsquo;s not a big deal</p>
<p>the guy dry heave</p>
<p>dude no name from san francisco</p>
<p>he was all dry heaven when he did it but i just</p>
<p>drank it it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>once you get past it is in your mind in</p>
<p>my mind being</p>
<p>on fear factor for six years dude i saw people</p>
<p>get past some gnarly show there are</p>
<p>things on there</p>
<p>that seem to be illegal</p>
<p>now they were all</p>
<p>legal no like some of</p>
<p>those dead animals or like animal parts</p>
<p>yeah they need to cook</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>everything we did we did did</p>
<p>anybody get sick</p>
<p>ever yeah they got like diarrhea</p>
<p>sec but never like in trouble</p>
<p>but we did have a problem here&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>for the folks at home</p>
<p>if you are allergic to shellfish</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also allergic to roaches</p>
<p>really yeah because i guess</p>
<p>i guess there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shit there that they have that exoskeleton</p>
<p>yeah whatever it is that makes you allergic</p>
<p>am i right about that</p>
<p>their bones are actually on the outside of</p>
<p>their skin sure yeah</p>
<p>i mean that is what a cockroach and a lobster and</p>
<p>shelf i could eat</p>
<p>bugs if they were cooked</p>
<p>because it seemed like a crunchy</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s not the big deal it&rsquo;s on your head you</p>
<p>did a roach</p>
<p>i ate a big madagascar hissing cockroach</p>
<p>it was no big deal</p>
<p>wrong and alive</p>
<p>alive i just</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all in your head i&rsquo;d seen so many people do it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m eating as i&rsquo;m eating i&rsquo;m like there&rsquo;s nothing bad</p>
<p>about this is not that bad at all</p>
<p>tasty doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taste good but it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taste terrible</p>
<p>like i would totally eat a gang of them if i was</p>
<p>starving to death</p>
<p>maybe if i was</p>
<p>starving chew</p>
<p>those motherfuckers no</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t believe it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so bad</p>
<p>let me smell it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not your piss bro</p>
<p>yeah i do want to says not your piss bro</p>
<p>let me i do want to</p>
<p>smell it full of shit i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>throw up just is it warm</p>
<p>you fucking liar it&rsquo;s apple juice you&rsquo;re weak</p>
<p>interrupt our fucking</p>
<p>train of thought for that well he wanted to see me</p>
<p>listen if i</p>
<p>smelled it i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>start driving</p>
<p>what were you talking</p>
<p>about before you came in</p>
<p>the cockroaches oh</p>
<p>i could only eat them if they were cooked</p>
<p>and salted then i</p>
<p>could eat them</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you the flavor is not that bad</p>
<p>the much more</p>
<p>impressive shit was when people</p>
<p>ate like habanero peppers</p>
<p>i can do that yeah i can do it</p>
<p>where sweat is dripping out of my</p>
<p>scalp have you ever</p>
<p>watched those</p>
<p>videos online</p>
<p>where people eat</p>
<p>those ghost chilies</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>sort of a pepper</p>
<p>i forget what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>i forget the actual technical name for it but it was</p>
<p>crazy that&rsquo;s the name of it that&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>heard of it</p>
<p>red band and it&rsquo;s insanely powerful</p>
<p>like many many many times</p>
<p>worse than a habanero</p>
<p>you can die kind of well i don&rsquo;t know if you can die i</p>
<p>guess you probably could</p>
<p>but when people take it they make</p>
<p>videos of them taking it</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re in agony</p>
<p>fucking screaming</p>
<p>screaming agony</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s some people that like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>woman in india</p>
<p>who eats them like their</p>
<p>candy and then</p>
<p>rubs them on her eyes and nothing happens</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>bitch is like immune to it somehow or another</p>
<p>you know i love that</p>
<p>i love that</p>
<p>stuff you know you can get immune to</p>
<p>poison oak yeah by</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>ways and i did it i did i did one of the ways</p>
<p>one of the ways is you pick</p>
<p>and you have to pick it</p>
<p>with like a napkin so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>touch it with your skin</p>
<p>which is weird</p>
<p>but you pick the tiny little baby</p>
<p>red leaves this is poison oak</p>
<p>which is all over california</p>
<p>the tiny little baby red</p>
<p>leaves with a napkin the</p>
<p>shiny shiny oily tiny ones</p>
<p>and you put it</p>
<p>in your mouth a</p>
<p>bunch of them</p>
<p>and chewing</p>
<p>chewing chewing</p>
<p>chewing chewing</p>
<p>chewing and swallow them</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re immune</p>
<p>i did that what uh huh but the better way</p>
<p>which seems better</p>
<p>is you get a</p>
<p>goat i&rsquo;m doing we&rsquo;re doing this in my we have</p>
<p>three acres</p>
<p>i actually have 30 acres</p>

<p>this tall look</p>
<p>look he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>three feet tall</p>
<p>but the thing is is he</p>
<p>he is he&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>these gophers in</p>
<p>these rats i&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>a rat or a gopher and i&rsquo;ve seen the tail</p>
<p>slurp into his</p>
<p>mouth and down his</p>
<p>throat like spaghetti</p>
<p>he just like swallows</p>
<p>these things he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get diseases</p>
<p>to you got to be careful is up there eating rats</p>
<p>can i tell i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>you gotta be careful</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>story red band</p>
<p>i was in the middle</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the middle of talking</p>
<p>about this goddamn</p>
<p>monster you live with</p>
<p>you gotta be real</p>
<p>who is the poison</p>
<p>oak or you do</p>
<p>you get the</p>
<p>go dog listen to this if you have poison oak</p>
<p>get it get some goats let them eat the point</p>
<p>they love poisoning and the go smoke</p>
<p>yeah exactly</p>
<p>but they eat that they eat the roots and all</p>
<p>the pull it out so there&rsquo;s no poison oak in your yard</p>
<p>you drink the goats</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re immune</p>
<p>and you drink the goats</p>
<p>okay shouldn&rsquo;t you you know this for a fact</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re encouraging people to eat</p>
<p>yeah what if the</p>
<p>throat closes up and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you know what</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you say the joe welkin</p>
<p>experience is not responsible for any of</p>
<p>these ideas that any dick has</p>
<p>we do not endorse</p>
<p>them or support them nor have we researched them</p>
<p>and i believe it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have someone looking i did it and it worked</p>
<p>and i have not gotten it</p>
<p>since because i had</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m very susceptible</p>
<p>to it and i&rsquo;ve broken out like like</p>
<p>leper you&rsquo;re so into</p>
<p>health and you&rsquo;re so into like vitamins and supplements</p>
<p>and you always have been used to eat raw cloves</p>
<p>of garlic and when you it&rsquo;s always been oh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>others there&rsquo;s like five cloves of raw</p>
<p>garlic in here so how are you that and then also this</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what is it</p>
<p>do you ever go to therapy</p>
<p>about that shit oh yeah i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>multiple when i was having trouble with lisa</p>
<p>and that other person</p>
<p>i had three therapists at the same time i</p>
<p>would go from one tell</p>
<p>them all different stories</p>
<p>see which one works best</p>
<p>no there was one time</p>
<p>i have an idea i mean how many people go to therapy</p>
<p>in hollywood</p>
<p>for real just because they need an audience</p>
<p>you need someone who wants to</p>
<p>focus 100 on</p>
<p>their thought</p>
<p>of that there&rsquo;s a lot of it dude that&rsquo;s what i used to</p>
<p>think when we were on newsradio</p>
<p>that was the most i had ever known</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>first time i&rsquo;d ever really been around actors and i</p>
<p>never knew how many people were on therapy</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m sure some of</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>are actually getting helped by this but how many of</p>
<p>these people are just</p>
<p>probably every cast</p>
<p>member was going to therapy on</p>
<p>our show right</p>
<p>but i remember one time</p>
<p>one of my therapists this is during the lisa</p>
<p>phase and i was</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t sleep</p>
<p>i would lay there and the</p>
<p>thing is that she was playing us both she was</p>
<p>still seeing me</p>
<p>and seeing him</p>
<p>and i would lay in my bed</p>
<p>shoes at the same time horrible</p>
<p>i was waiting home and</p>
<p>go down on her and she&rsquo;s all salty</p>
<p>no but i would imagine him i would imagine</p>
<p>him i would imagine him going down on her like this</p>
<p>spitting on her pussy so resolve that you know the fly</p>
<p>i like my that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great i forgot that scene what a great flick</p>
<p>well at least he&rsquo;s talented</p>
<p>okay i really have forgiven him it&rsquo;s not his</p>
<p>fault it&rsquo;s not his fault</p>
<p>except the fucking ground</p>
<p>or anything is kind of creepy</p>
<p>trying to come up with i still have</p>
<p>those tapes too</p>
<p>you should release those</p>
<p>maybe listen but with morph</p>
<p>his voice and change his name to mr mr silly pants</p>
<p>and you know people draw</p>
<p>their own conclusions because you&rsquo;ve already talked</p>
<p>about him before this</p>
<p>this one therapist i was i told him</p>
<p>i called him it says this is an emergency um</p>
<p>i really i&rsquo;d like to come in and see you</p>
<p>my girlfriend</p>
<p>at the time actually she we were both in hell she</p>
<p>wrote a suicide note</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gonna commit suicide i really</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what to do cause i</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m responsible and i don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>and he literally said</p>
<p>okay well listen i got a skedaddle</p>
<p>said that phrase they</p>
<p>called you a</p>
<p>drama queen without saying it yeah</p>
<p>i got a skedaddle</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s exactly what it was he just called you a</p>
<p>drama queens like</p>
<p>maybe i was</p>
<p>okay you cried wolf</p>
<p>again how funny is he cry wolf and you have a wolf</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t cry wolf i always</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing it&rsquo;s yeah but it you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>i have a wolf</p>
<p>and people think i cry well</p>
<p>so do you think it&rsquo;s</p>

<p>about you when we were on</p>

<p>things we were talking</p>

<p>gonna bring in a</p>
<p>bunch of people that you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be a part of this</p>
<p>agreement that&rsquo;s your relationship that</p>
<p>never worked out all</p>
<p>based on the</p>
<p>fact that when it</p>
<p>falls apart</p>
<p>just assuming that all of us are</p>
<p>gonna be irrational</p>
<p>and greedy and</p>
<p>occasionally it occasionally</p>
<p>works out to be fair</p>
<p>very occasionally</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>marriage that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>worried about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this divorce</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>idea of being bonded if you&rsquo;re together you&rsquo;re together</p>
<p>who cares if you&rsquo;re together on</p>
<p>paper if you&rsquo;re together legally</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s when you can&rsquo;t get away from each</p>
<p>other it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>the divorce is the most</p>
<p>ridiculous aspect</p>
<p>of marriage</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re married you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>married yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>and you start putting in like you</p>
<p>start putting in you factor in how much lawyers make</p>
<p>and then how the</p>
<p>with my buddy</p>
<p>he had to pay for his wife&rsquo;s lawyer</p>
<p>i had it with the girl i&rsquo;m living with now i said look</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s come to an</p>
<p>agreement and not</p>
<p>bring lawyers in because when you</p>
<p>bring lawyers in you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>food out of our kids</p>
<p>mouth true and you&rsquo;re putting it</p>
<p>up the fucking lawyers ass yeah and i paid</p>
<p>tens of thousands of dollars</p>
<p>maybe up upwards of hundreds how</p>
<p>about my friend paid millions</p>
<p>uh who i&rsquo;m not telling you i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>telling you is a big he&rsquo;s got cash and</p>
<p>he went through</p>
<p>one the more you have the more they can take</p>
<p>two and a half years</p>
<p>he went through a relationship</p>
<p>a divorce where he was paying for two lawyers</p>
<p>at the same time that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;d rather live in the shed</p>
<p>i let my ex</p>
<p>take my money goes</p>
<p>right to her</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like you know what i&rsquo;m done with this fucking shit</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need anything</p>
<p>as long as i have my 52 inch flat screen</p>
<p>plasma whatever hd</p>
<p>all that with the</p>
<p>sound and all and</p>
<p>with this one necessities i</p>
<p>just need the very bare minimums and to be with my kids</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beautiful good food</p>
<p>and then you can have</p>
<p>all the rest of it you fucking cunt</p>
<p>well how did</p>
<p>you get we know it&rsquo;s i know you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>just leave the</p>
<p>world i&rsquo;m fucking</p>

<p>there was one guy i say was saying well</p>
<p>you know i think</p>
<p>neither one of us</p>
<p>completely have our shit together</p>
<p>but obviously you i</p>
<p>think you do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be more</p>
<p>out of control no in real life though you have your</p>
<p>shit together or i keep it together but it&rsquo;s a constant</p>
<p>bound really yeah</p>
<p>what why the pot i&rsquo;m a fucking savage</p>
<p>the pot no i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>violent rage aholic</p>
<p>a nice guy trapped in the body of a violent</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a raging holland</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>i just is frightening i just work out a lot</p>
<p>i have a lot of energy i have a lot of aggressive</p>
<p>energy just always have</p>
<p>loved that i mean</p>
<p>i was attracted</p>
<p>to it ew stop it</p>
<p>disgusting i think</p>
<p>a lot of people are but you know</p>
<p>i keep it completely and totally together</p>
<p>but i do it with</p>
<p>body maintenance i have to make sure i work out a lot</p>
<p>i have to make sure that i get in the tank a lot</p>
<p>you know i think all of</p>
<p>us are struggling no one is just getting through life</p>
<p>everything is perfect that&rsquo;s why you have to</p>
<p>remember that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you have to remember</p>
<p>no you think</p>
<p>about your problems you</p>
<p>think about how</p>
<p>what hell you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>everybody well it&rsquo;s also what</p>
<p>causes your</p>
<p>problems i have way way way less problems now</p>
<p>than i did when i was younger because i</p>
<p>understand life better</p>
<p>understand myself exactly</p>
<p>i understand my own behavior</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you wish that you</p>
<p>could be you</p>
<p>and i could be me with what we know</p>
<p>and how we are and how</p>
<p>i actually think our chemicals</p>
<p>literally changed</p>
<p>we could go back</p>
<p>with with this this this</p>
<p>this knowledge or whatever</p>
<p>these chemicals coursing through our veins</p>
<p>and start over</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t want to start over</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a different</p>
<p>place but i know that i could</p>
<p>i could just</p>
<p>but you know it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>starting over any</p>
<p>i have some</p>
<p>i have that you</p>
<p>have makes you you though</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure you do that</p>
<p>makes you you</p>
<p>get where it</p>
<p>also makes you humble because</p>
<p>quite honestly anybody that wants to be</p>
<p>famous anyone who wants to</p>
<p>be successful you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s an impossible</p>
<p>struggle with ego</p>
<p>you struggle with the idea of</p>
<p>grandiose ideas like</p>
<p>being better than you really are being</p>
<p>this amazing person that deserves</p>
<p>all of this attention you know</p>
<p>the humiliating moments the humbling moments actually</p>
<p>really kind of</p>
<p>round you off so</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do it&rsquo;s impossible to do what i just said</p>
<p>except that</p>
<p>i can do it</p>
<p>what i do now is i say you know what</p>
<p>i am i can do that i can</p>
<p>start right now</p>
<p>with what i know</p>
<p>and with the chemicals that are my natural</p>
<p>who i am i feel different</p>
<p>well you are like a different</p>
<p>learn you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned over the years i can</p>
<p>start over starting now and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also part of shedding</p>
<p>everything off</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t know pun intended the shed</p>
<p>i got rid of</p>
<p>everything i own</p>
<p>i gave it away</p>
<p>it sounds very helpful i had so much</p>
<p>your approach</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>the correct people</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>bad i&rsquo;m doing better than i&rsquo;ve done in years</p>

<p>he was victimizing all</p>
<p>these comics he was</p>
<p>stealing all</p>
<p>their shit nobody wanted to be in the room</p>
<p>when he was in the room nobody wanted to be on</p>
<p>stage they would light the</p>
<p>light up to make sure that you knew that he was on</p>
<p>stage so you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do new material wow</p>
<p>it was crazy and they all got it</p>
<p>was not even</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s valid conversation yeah</p>
<p>you know i mean it all came about</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t want it to</p>
<p>happen it&rsquo;s not something that i was looking forward to</p>
<p>it was totally unpretent</p>
<p>of unplanned</p>
<p>we had no idea it was</p>
<p>going to happen when i had</p>
<p>i remember when it was happening and they</p>
<p>cause i know you and i&rsquo;m like oh this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna be good</p>
<p>cause i knew you were just</p>
<p>gonna get more and more ink</p>
<p>well i wasn&rsquo;t even really that</p>
<p>angry with you brought him down</p>
<p>you brought him</p>
<p>down i know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a really person</p>
<p>but he knows he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>plan that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right all of it</p>
<p>about you know all what it all is like was</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s better off</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exposed as well</p>
<p>you know he was the reason why it happened</p>
<p>in the first place</p>
<p>he was living in some</p>
<p>crazy lie state</p>
<p>where you know</p>
<p>he really believed</p>
<p>his bullshit he wanted that to happen that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>when people do terrible</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>serial killers a lot of them want to get caught</p>
<p>you know a lot of them do shit</p>
<p>because they want to get caught i always</p>
<p>leave a little something</p>
<p>yeah when you do fucked up</p>
<p>things to people man</p>
<p>i think for</p>
<p>real that there&rsquo;s somewhere in the back of your head</p>
<p>that you gotta know that that&rsquo;s affecting you</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>skate away clean</p>
<p>you think he had that sure yeah i</p>
<p>think everybody does fucked up</p>
<p>things like he</p>
<p>denied a complete</p>
<p>total sociopath</p>
<p>eventually he</p>
<p>started giving in</p>
<p>he did yeah</p>
<p>you said watch the</p>
<p>movie i am comic yeah he just flat out</p>
<p>admits it and i am comic</p>
<p>you know i feel bad for the guy what is that</p>
<p>about i am comic mental illness</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s some documentary</p>
<p>about lots of different</p>
<p>comics are you in</p>
<p>it no was never</p>
<p>heard of it</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know i didn&rsquo;t hear</p>

<p>after it was already made</p>
<p>but apparently he&rsquo;s in it</p>
<p>you know whatever man you know</p>
<p>gives a fuck</p>
<p>i made up i</p>
<p>never talked with polly shore</p>
<p>for 20 years</p>
<p>after in the army now i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like him on the set</p>
<p>he was a little bit</p>
<p>like you but</p>
<p>worse because</p>
<p>he was just very</p>
<p>aggressive and just outright mean</p>
<p>and i wasn&rsquo;t used to i was a naive kid</p>
<p>from the suburbs</p>
<p>of chicago i was just this nice guy and</p>
<p>sweet and always full of happy</p>
<p>love and then</p>
<p>he was mean</p>
<p>to me and right in</p>
<p>front of people and on the set</p>
<p>and i just didn&rsquo;t want to ever work with him again but</p>
<p>over the years he</p>
<p>changed and then i</p>
<p>changed now we&rsquo;re friends</p>
<p>again and now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about doing</p>
<p>we did in the army now</p>
<p>and now i actually came up or</p>
<p>an old assistant of mine came up with the idea of doing</p>
<p>in the army again</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been 20 i&rsquo;m telling you amazing no it really</p>
<p>could work because</p>
<p>in the first</p>
<p>movie we&rsquo;re in the reserves</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re in the reserves</p>
<p>you can get called up to active duty at any moment</p>
<p>20 years later</p>
<p>give this away</p>
