What&amp;rsquo;s this brand? Is this a Montclair hat?

So it&amp;rsquo;s sold out dude, you sold out the Montclair hat. So we have no advertising

    <p>Point of privilege sacks wore this hat last week</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this brand? Is this a Montclair hat?</p>
<p>Yeah, and actually did you see that that tweet people it&rsquo;s trending it started trending after I wore it</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sold out dude, you sold out the Montclair hat. So we have no advertising</p>
<p>We I feel like if we&rsquo;re not gonna do any advertising on the show</p>
<p>We should at least get free clothes. We get to pick through them. Wear what we like. I know where&rsquo;s my cut?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my cut as an influencer the tweet basically said that I named drop Laura Piana and sent it through the roof and then</p>
<p>Saks they&rsquo;ve dropped Montclair both brands. Obviously our Italian both entrepreneurs. We know very well</p>
<p>And so I asked that I said Matt, can you basically send this tweet over to that?</p>
<p>So maybe they can give us free</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the grift going boys now. We&rsquo;re talking now. We got some bestie grits. God. No, you speak in my language</p>
<p>Speaking of grits, I do like Montclair the way that your mouth likes Laura Piano</p>
<p>Just so you guys know at the birthday Jason that you missed</p>
<p>Are we allowed to play poker? We had a birthday. We had a surprise birthday party for me</p>
<p>That through it</p>
<p>sack showed up</p>
<p>Free bird showed up their wives showed up. It was incredible. J. Cal basically stiff army. I&rsquo;m very sorry</p>
<p>It was a by the way that came together four days before your birthday. So just show you uh-huh</p>
<p>Well, you know what Kevin Hart showed up. Give us the best one liner, which one landed? Oh, no, Jake</p>
<p>Oh, you have no idea. These guys roasted me. It was fucking incredible. But the best of it was at the end</p>
<p>okay, Hart gets up with no preparation and</p>
<p>Skewers everybody free bird. I mean deep. What do you think of like Kevin&rsquo;s rose Carter? He was so funny</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like my wife walked in here and she looks at me and she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>These these guys</p>
<p>I think but it was so funny. He dropped a line. Of course. Well, he&rsquo;s a ringer. He&rsquo;s a professional</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s maybe the funniest person in the world and then sacks had to come after. Yeah, exactly</p>
<p>Xander I don&rsquo;t know why Xander was the MC but because I was a save Kevin Hart for last</p>
<p>But instead he calls up K Hart in the middle. That&rsquo;s was so tilted</p>
<p>Okay, so wait, so I couldn&rsquo;t make you because I had burning man</p>
<p>The Xander does the emceeing then Kevin Hart you were saying is just to fill in the audience here so they can understand it</p>
<p>Kevin Hart comes in he gives this incredible ad-lib roast and then sacks has to go after him. Yeah</p>
<p>First of all Xander&rsquo;s is funny. That&rsquo;s a great bag. What a sandbag</p>
<p>Xander&rsquo;s as funny as a root canal. He should not have been the MC. So yes, we did miss you Jake</p>
<p>You should have been the MC second K Hart should have been left for last obviously worse, but</p>
<p>Xander being a good liberal couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Censor me outright. So he had me go after K Hart. That&rsquo;s like the next best thing. Did you steal his documents?</p>
<p>Did you steal all his jokes and put them in your I just threw I had all these like jokes written</p>
<p>I just threw him out the window because I can&rsquo;t what am I gonna do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna deliver jokes after Kevin Hart. So I just told a story, you know, Kevin Hart like killed</p>
<p>I mean the room was I mean, that&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s like getting punched by Mike Tyson being like, oh my god that hurt</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like shits Mike Tyson</p>
<p>We were at</p>
<p>The the code conference we had the poker game was the last one after 20</p>
<p>Shut up to Kara Swisher big shot. I want to say to Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher</p>
<p>Because they did the conference many years together. Congratulations on a 20-year run</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna do it. Okay, I was not gonna do it next year</p>
<p>But my friend Jim bank off who runs Vox is gonna run it next year</p>
<p>So congratulations to him and Cara for a great run and all things deep</p>
<p>They you know, they they they had Steve Jobs at the first one first speaker and you can look it up</p>
<p>I got to ask him a question Jake. Oh, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember this, but you and I were there when</p>
<p>gates and jobs</p>
<p>Did that speech together?</p>
<p>Unbelievable. What what an incredible legacy that she documented this code code is incredible</p>
<p>Like I mean the number of the amount of memories I have from that place is incredible</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great. And so we&rsquo;ll see where the poker game goes next year</p>
<p>Probably the only time I think the all-in summit could have been that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s heartbreaking. It&rsquo;s heartbreaking</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;ll be hosting the code conference next year, but</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re looking for an impresario</p>
<p>this is the problem with this pot is we&rsquo;re drawing too many high-profile people in now, but</p>
<p>Interestingly freeberg and I we now have the press</p>
<p>Wants the the press are trying to do a profile of the pod</p>
<p>And so we had three or four different press outlets now</p>
<p>I would say which ones but have all asked us to do like a sit for a profile. We&rsquo;ve said no</p>
<p>But just because why don&rsquo;t we do a profile of them who&rsquo;s to make them the media, you know?</p>
<p>Well, I mean</p>
<p>Our competitors want to do a piece on us. Why would we cooperate?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s gonna be a hit a hit piece. It&rsquo;d probably be hippies. Yeah, of course because we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re stealing</p>
<p>Influence and clicks and views away from them</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s done besides they&rsquo;re ideologically motivated anyway, so they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re message police sex. You don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ideologically motivated</p>
<p>Listen if you contradict the official narrative, then they write a hit piece about you. That&rsquo;s how they try to enforce discipline</p>
<p>But not that is true. It&rsquo;s I like the independent ones</p>
<p>I do have to say like this whole, you know</p>
<p>Substack movement in independent artists or independent journalists becoming even more indie. In fact, Kara Swisher is more Indian now</p>
<p>She left the New York Times</p>
<p>Specifically because they were you know, giving her a hard time about certain guests or certain conversations and now she&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>Doing her pockets independently with Vox publishing it for her</p>
<p>So you see more and more of the voices go independent New Republic is doing a hit piece on me right now</p>
<p>I have no idea why</p>
<p>Me and I CC them and I was like, here&rsquo;s my official comment</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to visit sacks when he&rsquo;s in the White House in 20 years and the guys like so you&rsquo;re saying sacks is writing</p>
<p>For a president. I&rsquo;m saying no. I&rsquo;m saying that you don&rsquo;t understand a joke. That was a joke</p>
<p>Yeah, and then and then after you copied me then they&rsquo;re like, oh, yeah</p>
<p>We were reaching out to David to to get in. No, yeah, and they hadn&rsquo;t reached out to you yet, right?</p>
<p>I had it reached out. Anyway, so they were going a little sneaky sneak. They were trying to get me</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I don&rsquo;t have time. I don&rsquo;t have time to talk to them</p>
<p>You know looks a nice that would be a nice profile. I think nobody reads</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not what it used to be if it were if it were Michael Kinsley running the New Republic</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to you know, take the time, but it&rsquo;s not that anymore. It&rsquo;s just another left-wing rag that&rsquo;s into policing speech</p>
<p>You know, they asked they sent us a bunch of questions like, you know, why questions?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t have them in front of me</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re like they&rsquo;re basically like why did you support the recall of Jason Boudin stuff like that and</p>
<p>My you know PR person got back to him and said have you seen the all-in pod?</p>
<p>Have you read David&rsquo;s like Twitter because he explained this like abundantly for the two years</p>
<p>He was advocating every week. We talked about we talked about this. There&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Sitting there in the transcripts, right? He&rsquo;s like, oh</p>
<p>He talked about in the pod. He the guy didn&rsquo;t listen to the pot. He&rsquo;s like he tweeted about this</p>
<p>No, he just thinks I&rsquo;m like some right-wing donor who was like trying to get chase it kicked out that kind of narrative</p>
<p>You know, so I&rsquo;m like this is a total waste of my time</p>
<p>Go read all my tweets go watch the all-in pod and then come back with any questions. I haven&rsquo;t been answered</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this lazy reporting on the New Republic&rsquo;s part. Why would you do a profile if you didn&rsquo;t actually?</p>
<p>You are having a serious conversation while free bird is fucking around with his background. What is his background? What is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a future city in Saudi Arabia. Who else is planning on doing a hit piece about us. Okay, so the information</p>
<p>reached out and</p>
<p>We said no</p>
<p>Actually on the show right now, I guess I think this way we should deal with all inbound press inquiries</p>
<p>This will tell him no and then discuss it on the pod</p>
<p>If they want to quote</p>
<p>Listen to our pod and then transcribe what we say on this pod or reverse it</p>
<p>My quote for the New Republic is that if Michael Kinsley were still the editor</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to spend my valuable time talking to you, but he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>Fair profile, of course, it&rsquo;s not gonna be fair. There are the speech police now</p>
<p>And the fact he didn&rsquo;t even know the fact he didn&rsquo;t even know that</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t just a donor on the chase of Boudin thing. I was the first person that I&rsquo;m aware of</p>
<p>At least within Silicon Valley who called out chaser Boudin for the horrible job. He was I mean if that was bipartisan, by the way</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like David Sachs is one of the 3% of San Franciscans who are Republican</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s not able to vote for the 69% of people who voted Chesa Boudin out</p>
<p>So like you can&rsquo;t spin that one. You&rsquo;re categorizing me as like just a partisan. That&rsquo;s not really how I come at these issues</p>
<p>Can we go back to your quotes? So that was your comment for New Republic J Cal</p>
<p>Do you have a comment for New York Times? And then no, it started with Eric</p>
<p>I got the affairs Eric newcomer who&rsquo;s awesome who worked at the information started his own sub stack</p>
<p>Which is really good, by the way, and he comes on my other pod. He&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m gonna be a guest on his pod because I promised him and he does my pot</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not gonna be a guest my philosophy is I told him I said you can have me as a guest</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t be more than 10% all in because I don&rsquo;t want it to become an all-in profile</p>
<p>We agreed as a group. We&rsquo;re not doing an all-in profile right now</p>
<p>So up to 10% can be about all in but the other 90% has got to be my other projects and he said totally fine</p>
<p>Um, he understands but he asked first and actually I would be inclined to do with him because he&rsquo;s if we were gonna do it</p>
<p>But then what do they need?</p>
<p>I mean like we create like hours and hours of content and the drama&rsquo;s out here for everybody to like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand. Like what is what do you need our cooperation? I think you want to know you want to maybe frame</p>
<p>And get a couple sleep</p>
<p>No, you want you just want to get a couple of quotes that are unique so that it&rsquo;s worth reading</p>
<p>These poor guys have shoved their heads up each other&rsquo;s asses. Oh, it&rsquo;s like a it&rsquo;s like a serpent</p>
<p>Wow, I&rsquo;ve never hunted serpents. You&rsquo;re clear up here</p>
<p>Clean bill of health sacks. So anyway, Eric newcomer asked and then the information and then Kevin</p>
<p>No, the New York Times just asked right Kevin Ruiz. Oh, yeah. What was a nice in your time?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right your comment my comment in there times is</p>
<p>Yeah, I enjoyed the pod while it lasts we&rsquo;re trying to keep it together</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll say the other big issue is I got approached by a couple of by two different people who wanna</p>
<p>Who want to represent the pod?</p>
<p>They say there&rsquo;s seven and a half million dollars in advertising. We&rsquo;re leaving on the table by the way 150 a week good</p>
<p>To 10 million</p>
<p>Killing me you realize I would have a plane if you guys just let me sell the fucking heads on this thing</p>
<p>I could get like a half dollars in jets. Yeah, you would have a plane if you just one other thing</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing actually different things just do one thing. I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is. You&rsquo;d have a plane if you&rsquo;re smarter</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s not nice sex that&rsquo;s not nice I would have a plane if I got luckier</p>
<p>I will say whoever said this is gonna help our core businesses. And that&rsquo;s the reason I think might have been you tomorrow. I</p>
<p>am raising my fourth fund I</p>
<p>Am doing it 506 e which is public I tweeted about it. I had 1200 people</p>
<p>sign up for the webinar and</p>
<p>This means I might have to increase the size of my fourth venture fund because so many people</p>
<p>Listen to this pod and want to hang out. So thank you to everybody who listens to the pot</p>
<p>I think for you, bro</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just nice, you know, I you know, I struggled to raise the first couple funds</p>
<p>You guys backed me, but like I couldn&rsquo;t break through as a solo GP</p>
<p>With that with the big LPS, but I&rsquo;m hoping to get one big LP this time</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m gonna be oversubscribed with all the high net worth individuals and everything</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d like to get like a memorial Sloan-Kettering or somebody doing cancer research just to feel good about it</p>
<p>You know, I just want to say that I supported J Cal as a friend</p>
<p>In fact, I was the first LP check in your fund, but that does not mean that I endorsed in any way in any way</p>
<p>Anybody else to come in I mean, whatever you&rsquo;re I don&rsquo;t want to say the performance, but you&rsquo;re doing okay</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s leave it at that. Yeah, and I would like you say that I was not the first but I was the biggest</p>
<p>You did you did pretty big. Yeah, absolutely</p>
<p>And I will say that I&rsquo;m still waiting for that moment to join you guys in jail</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;ll just keep coming to your LP meetings and entertaining your thanks pal</p>
<p>Entertaining wait is Jake on an investor in production board. No, we did we have done we&rsquo;ve done a syndicate together</p>
<p>You are you are my smallest investor you</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to work guys</p>
<p>The Queen the passing of the Queen real quick before we start or is that I would like to yeah</p>
<p>I was born in Sri Lanka. I was raised in Canada. So and now I live in the United States</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;ve been a citizen of all three countries. So two of the three countries</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a subject</p>
<p>To the Queen I mean, I&rsquo;m part of the Commonwealth and I just want to say</p>
<p>It was really sad for me like these last couple of days when I would saw that she was sick</p>
<p>and then she had passed I</p>
<p>Gotta be honest with you. Like it really touched me. She is an</p>
<p>Incur I can&rsquo;t describe to you guys</p>
<p>For someone who is part of that realm how important she is as a person and then you know, if you&rsquo;ve seen you know the</p>
<p>the show on Netflix it kind of</p>
<p>Romanticizes a little bit but you know, she has seen 17 prime ministers. She&rsquo;s seen so many presidents</p>
<p>She has seen the history of the world</p>
<p>The modern world being made in front of her</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m a little sad and I think she&rsquo;s an incredible person and even if you don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>Necessarily with monarchies in general. I think you have to be super positive or the history of imperialism</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that are kind of using this moment to be negative, right?</p>
<p>Jamaica wants to become a republic. Australia wants to become a republic. They&rsquo;ll prosecute that in due time</p>
<p>But for right now, I just think that we have to celebrate this</p>
<p>Incredible woman who lived to an incredible age who saw incredible things and who dedicated her entire life</p>
<p>To the public service and lived it totally neutrally which in today&rsquo;s world</p>
<p>Nobody else does everybody else takes the point of the point</p>
<p>Everybody else everybody else tries to basically like, you know, create a schism</p>
<p>She never did that in 70 years as the Queen</p>
<p>Yeah, like very stoic very stoic in a symbol of service not a symbol of dictatorship, right?</p>
<p>I mean there seems to be a very different role that she&rsquo;s taken as a monarch then I think what yeah has maybe historically been</p>
<p>the role</p>
<p>Which is incredible pretty profound, right? It&rsquo;s extraordinary that somebody would put 70 years of service and be that diligent</p>
<p>And I think stoic and in there for her people and to the people who are you know suffering and grieving, you know</p>
<p>That word you said really resonated with me like diligent is such a great word because it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re disciplined</p>
<p>You put in hard work. You&rsquo;re focused on the long-term goal and then you&rsquo;re selfless</p>
<p>Yes, not many people not many people Jake out</p>
<p>You know this exhibit that at all, but then definitely don&rsquo;t exhibit it over 70 years</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s extraordinary and yeah, it&rsquo;s I know a lot of people are grieving right now</p>
<p>So you have somebody as a citizen of the monarchy? I am of the Commonwealth rather</p>
<p>I am pro Queen Elizabeth and it deeply saddens me to see that she passed away. All right, listen, we got to talk about</p>
<p>Winter is coming. I&rsquo;m not talking about Game of Thrones. Let&rsquo;s talk about something serious that&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t like to be too repetitive here, but I think</p>
<p>we correctly</p>
<p>Predicted that you know this if this Ukraine, I think maybe sacks you pointed this out of this. You know, what do you mean?</p>
<p>We came Osabi</p>
<p>All right. Listen, I&rsquo;m trying to give you fucking credit and you interrupted me. Can you just take the fucking win?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re such a miserable bastard. I try to give you one fucking finish finish what you&rsquo;re saying and you cut me off</p>
<p>All right. Listen, we&rsquo;ve been talking about this Ukraine thing sacks correctly predicted if this goes to winter</p>
<p>this is</p>
<p>Going to get acute and of course right on cue here</p>
<p>We have it. Russia has essentially cut off gas to Europe right now by</p>
<p>Claiming that the Nord Stream one the north pipeline that Russia built that goes under the Baltic Sea</p>
<p>They basically say a turbines broken in it</p>
<p>Magically at this point in time right before winter this turbine broke according to Putin and he needs a turbine</p>
<p>And if they give him a turbine he said he&rsquo;s gonna turn it back on</p>
<p>This in the face of Europe saying they were gonna cap the price of Russian gas</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how that works exactly that you tell people what they can charge for gas</p>
<p>But Russian gas shipments, which Germany is particularly</p>
<p>Dependent on have fallen 89% since last year and the price of liquefied natural gas in Europe is</p>
<p>Four times level a year ago in eight times the level of the US</p>
<p>obviously we are have gotten incredibly lucky to find all this natural gas here and we are a huge exporter of</p>
<p>Natural gas and oil in the United States, so we&rsquo;re good</p>
<p>this is the highest power prices have been in three decades and</p>
<p>The perfect storm is not limited to oil and the Russia and the Ukraine war</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s 56 nuclear power plants are running at half-strength</p>
<p>Because of shutdowns over corrosion problems and as we talked about maybe two episodes droughts have undermined hydroelectric power</p>
<p>Because of these that&rsquo;s not the main issue here. The main issue is the well</p>
<p>This is there is a perfect storm here. It&rsquo;s not just that 40% of Europe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Energy consumption comes from Russian natural gas</p>
<p>40% and so you could see variance</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a base load requirement for lighting and electricity and then there&rsquo;s industrial production and then there&rsquo;s heating and cooling</p>
<p>Heating and cooling demand is linearly tied to the number of degrees above or below 65 Fahrenheit on average</p>
<p>And so as the temperature goes up people turn air conditioners on as the temperature goes below 65</p>
<p>They turn their heaters on so there&rsquo;s a linear demand for power consumption at those</p>
<p>so number one is you could kind of you could either cut base load, which is lighting and basic kind of</p>
<p>Operations number two is cut industrial production</p>
<p>Which is already happening a lot of fertilizer plants are shutting down in the country that are dependent on natural in the in the continent</p>
<p>That are dependent on natural gas</p>
<p>And number three is the school at heating and cooling and that really ends up being kind of a market driven function</p>
<p>Which is how pricey is this stuff because there&rsquo;s limited supply</p>
<p>So you could normally in a normal year see fluctuations around 5 10 15 percent</p>
<p>Maybe with good kind of action and behavior</p>
<p>40% of energy being cut is a massive massive</p>
<p>Problem there will be significant price climbs for the kind of variable demand and heating and cooling and so on</p>
<p>But for the price to go up by 6x 7x 8x 10x 15x over normal prices for someone</p>
<p>Is unbearable by the average household unbearable by the average small business unbearable by the average small building</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s causing critical failure</p>
<p>across the economy</p>
<p>across the currencies across debt markets</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s real concern that ultimately the shutting off of 40% of the energy supply</p>
<p>To the continent leading into winter winter is coming where energy demand spikes because of the need for heating is</p>
<p>Going to cause real kind of problems. So there&rsquo;s the cataclysmic problem of people actually being able to heat their homes</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the industrial problem of parts of the economy shutting down and then there&rsquo;s the currency</p>
<p>Problem of the government&rsquo;s needing to step in and bail out industry buy super expensive gas</p>
<p>Give it to their citizens and their businesses at a discounted price and seeing their national and sovereign debts skyrocket</p>
<p>which is now expected to happen and as a result, the British pound is trading at its lowest level since</p>
<p>1985 and as a result people are rushing to the street from Prague to Cologne Germany even in London</p>
<p>Proclaiming that the government&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t doing enough number one to stall the the rate of inflation to make energy prices cheaper through action</p>
<p>By having the government subsidized and number three, which I think was inevitable and is now becoming kind of the surprise factor to the Ukraine crisis</p>
<p>Citizens are saying end this war now</p>
<p>Get to the table with Russia come up with a settlement and get the heck out of the Ukraine, by the way</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not everyone saying it just to be clear, but there is this rising</p>
<p>Rioting protesting behavior happening across Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine war</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re seeing you know</p>
<p>I think a big shift in attitude and a big shift in kind of the societal perception of this war</p>
<p>Particularly in Europe because they&rsquo;re so acutely feeling the effects and we are not in the u.s</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re acutely feeling the effects and they&rsquo;re saying we need to stop this war now. We need to get out of the way</p>
<p>We need to let Russia turn the gas pipeline back on and we need to figure out a resolution</p>
<p>Stop supporting Ukraine. And that&rsquo;s a voice. That was that&rsquo;s a voice that did not exist very loudly</p>
<p>Yeah at the beginning and it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s starting to swell</p>
<p>Running out of food or you know running out of heat to keep your kids warm. I mean, these are pretty acute situations</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the vibe in the Middle East about this? Are they looking at it and seeing it as an opportunity?</p>
<p>Are they looking at it and seeing it as?</p>
<p>You know a manageable crises and what do they consider their participation in this to be?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very structured framework for energy production, which is OPEC and OPEC plus and</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>They have done</p>
<p>not just the Middle East but frankly the Middle East plus</p>
<p>The United States the best job possible to basically get the maximum demand so that there&rsquo;s as much energy as possible</p>
<p>The reasons that Europe are in an energy crisis really should be discussed</p>
<p>Honestly, so number one</p>
<p>an entire continent</p>
<p>Essentially allowed a 16 year old girl to dictate their energy policy</p>
<p>and when Greta Thunberg was able to shame an</p>
<p>entire continent into basically</p>
<p>Walking away from nuclear and not really evaluating how you can actually have energy independence</p>
<p>What they did was they put Europe in an incredibly fragile position and</p>
<p>At the beginning of this war. It wasn&rsquo;t clear</p>
<p>How much damage the lack of Russian energy would do to the European economy, but now it&rsquo;s absolutely clear</p>
<p>How did you not see that?</p>
<p>We said it on the credit. We said it on the pod in February. How did they not?</p>
<p>I mean Trump said it years ago. I mean the first thing we said, how is it not obvious?</p>
<p>The problem is you had these look to be honest</p>
<p>You had these two goofballs</p>
<p>You had a goofball on the left, which was a 16 year old girl who knew nothing and you had a goofball on the right</p>
<p>Which is a president whose language turned people off</p>
<p>Even though the message that he was delivering was a hundred percent right when when Trump went to the United Nations</p>
<p>He was clear. He was precise and in hindsight, and I&rsquo;m saying this as a Democrat. He was right</p>
<p>Oh about the German reliance on Russian gas and and the European reliance on gas</p>
<p>What did they think would happen?</p>
<p>The important thing was was the reaction remember that German delegation snickering while he was laughing</p>
<p>They were laughing but but we&rsquo;re but we&rsquo;re missing the real lesson</p>
<p>the real lesson is that in all of our haste to basically</p>
<p>Overtly judge Trump because of his delivery and his you know, his personal style or whatever</p>
<p>We ran towards a 16 year old person who has no rooting in science or technology</p>
<p>To dictate the energy policy of an entire continent. I mean the she was nominated for a Nobel Prize</p>
<p>Just to remind you guys</p>
<p>This is how insane all of these people were so in an effort to virtue signal to the hilt and beyond</p>
<p>What we essentially did what the entire world did was turn a blind eye to science</p>
<p>And turn a blind eye to mathematics and simple understanding of supply and demand and so now you have a situation where</p>
<p>The entire continent of Europe is probably on the precipice of and the minimum of recession</p>
<p>but frankly, there&rsquo;s a lot of scenarios where it could be meaningfully worse and</p>
<p>I think what it does is ultimately it is forced the Russian endgame and</p>
<p>that Russian endgame is essentially the following which is that</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>will probably be the first to capitulate but</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be the combination of the United States in Europe who negotiate some kind of a settlement</p>
<p>They have to fall and and the reason well without calling it folding</p>
<p>I would just say there&rsquo;s a settlement and the reason the settlement is necessary is you&rsquo;re gonna start to impact</p>
<p>tens of millions of people&rsquo;s lives in an</p>
<p>Incredibly arduous way and</p>
<p>those people are</p>
<p>Asking their leaders to tell them why it&rsquo;s worth it. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>protests all around Europe</p>
<p>people have decided that this war has gotten two or three steps beyond what they thought they were getting into and</p>
<p>that it was</p>
<p>Shining light on a whole set of decisions that never should have been made sacks</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s I think what people most want to know and I&rsquo;ll go to Fribourg after sex Fribourg</p>
<p>I think people gonna want to know</p>
<p>How do they close this gap in terms of the 40% dependency so you can start thinking about that</p>
<p>But sacks, how do we resolve this issue with Russia without enabling them because nobody wants to enable them and reward them for evading countries</p>
<p>but here we are they didn&rsquo;t settle this thing in the whatever nine months we&rsquo;re in now and</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any more cards to play. They need heat. They need</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t freeze to death in Germany</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re gonna have to fold in some way and it doesn&rsquo;t seem like there&rsquo;s any gap that can be closed here in terms</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough firewood to go around. It&rsquo;s all these stories about stockpiling firewood. That doesn&rsquo;t seem practical</p>
<p>Sure, you could reduce consumption by 10 20, maybe 25 percent that does seem reasonable, but there&rsquo;s still a huge gap here</p>
<p>So so what&rsquo;s the endgame sacks? I mean, well first just just to put some numbers on this</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good report by Goldman Sachs called Europe&rsquo;s energy</p>
<p>Crisis is at a tipping point this came out on September 8th</p>
<p>And it says here that the price of natural gas in Europe</p>
<p>It used to just be 20 euros per megawatt hour. It&rsquo;s now above 200 per megawatt hour</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re at 10 times the 10-year average in the market and winter isn&rsquo;t even here</p>
<p>So, you know Europe is the Titanic winter is the iceberg</p>
<p>The main difference between this and the Titanic story is that everyone can see the iceberg and yet no one is really changing course</p>
<p>So Liz trust the new prime minister of the UK so that Ukraine can depend on UK for support in the long term</p>
<p>Olaf Schultz said that Germany will support Ukraine as long as it takes</p>
<p>Macron, you know from France so that NATO will stand together and prevent Russia from winning the war</p>
<p>So, you know leader after leader is doing the opposite of what you and and Chamath have just said</p>
<p>Which is try to figure out a compromise</p>
<p>in fact in the last week or so new information came out about actions Boris Johnson took</p>
<p>Back in March or April when there was remember when there was discussion about a peace deal about a month into the war</p>
<p>It turns out that Boris Johnson went to Ukraine and said no deal do not take the deal</p>
<p>We need to weaken Putin and Russia not compromise with them</p>
<p>so the fact of the matter is that</p>
<p>The European leaders are increasingly out of touch with their own people</p>
<p>The agenda they are serving is not the agenda of or the desire of their people</p>
<p>To basically stay warm in the winter or pay reasonable energy bills. They are serving this larger foreign policy agenda</p>
<p>This is why you&rsquo;re seeing people in the streets in Czechoslovakia and these other countries and this is why the crisis will only grow in</p>
<p>Winter I think you guys are just assuming there&rsquo;s gonna be a compromise. I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true. These leaders are stubborn</p>
<p>So this is why for example, we&rsquo;ve already now seen in the UK Boris Johnson</p>
<p>Lost power, although listrust basically has the same policy</p>
<p>Mario Draghi has basically lost in Italy at Bulgaria replaced their PM</p>
<p>So the leaders the dominoes are starting to fall in Europe and I think there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot more of this and who knows what?</p>
<p>Governments we&rsquo;re gonna end up with in Europe. What&rsquo;s the endgame then? I mean, what do you what do you predict will happen?</p>
<p>You think they&rsquo;re gonna hold their ground and not have a compromise. So Chamath pointed out the mistakes that</p>
<p>These leaders made following Greta Thunberg</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another mistake they&rsquo;ve made which is I think all of these leaders have pulled a Tony Blair</p>
<p>Do you remember Tony Blair? Tony Blair was the Bill Clinton of the UK after Margaret Thatcher</p>
<p>He was the first Labour PM to get elected</p>
<p>He was incredibly talented as a politician and he was very popular in the UK until he did one thing</p>
<p>You know what that one thing was?</p>
<p>He went along with George W Bush&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Iraq war the people of the UK did not want to get involved in that war and Blair acted as W&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lapdog and went along with it and bought into all of the lies about that war and</p>
<p>Today he has zero credibility in the UK. It&rsquo;s really actually a sad story</p>
<p>I think that these European leaders are making a similar kind of mistake with respect to Biden&rsquo;s proxy war against Russia</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s go back. I want to go back to a point you made Jason just an L. Let&rsquo;s turn to free bird</p>
<p>Which is you talked about the fig leaf that the Russians are blaming this on a turbine</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s even really true anymore. I mean the Russians of course is lying. Of course. Yeah</p>
<p>yeah, but but I think the Russians have basically said that</p>
<p>That listen, this is about your sanctions. It&rsquo;s not sanctions. It&rsquo;s sanctions and a turbine. It&rsquo;s like pick one, right?</p>
<p>But but the point I&rsquo;m trying to make it look obviously this is retaliation by the Russians. The problem is the stupidity of</p>
<p>Western leaders in not thinking there&rsquo;s gonna be retaliation</p>
<p>I mean all you&rsquo;re hearing right now from Western leaders is indignation that Russia would play</p>
<p>The only card they have the card that was obvious they were gonna play, you know</p>
<p>Meanwhile, look at what we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got administration officials</p>
<p>Talking about the fact that we have commandos on the ground in Ukraine</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got administration officials bragging about the fact that we are helping to paint targets on the backs of Russian generals</p>
<p>so they can be killed you have administration officials boasting about providing the</p>
<p>Artillery spotting so we could sink the Moscow the the Russian flagship. I&rsquo;ll provide receipts for all these things</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ve got Biden saying that Putin cannot remain in power. You&rsquo;ve got Lindsey Graham saying</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go forward how does it resolve you&rsquo;ve got Lindsey Graham saying these be assassinated like Caesar</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the u.s. Appropriate 40 billion to hold on a second in weapons to Ukraine. So my point is this okay?</p>
<p>The u.s. And the Western Alliance, they are doing everything in Ukraine except pulling the triggers</p>
<p>Okay, they are doing the attack</p>
<p>Okay, so the point is we are in a proxy war with Russia</p>
<p>Yeah, what did you expect was gonna happen?</p>
<p>These leaders are not going to play what should happen going forward. Hold on. So you&rsquo;re in the review forget about playing chess</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not even playing checkers meaning they cannot even anticipate what the Russians are gonna do next</p>
<p>It was imminently predictable imminently predictable that the Russians were going to turn off European gas and create this crisis</p>
<p>So what should they have done what they should have done was work out a bus deal</p>
<p>I know that but we&rsquo;re kind of repeating the same position you have every week here. I&rsquo;m trying to get to going forward</p>
<p>So free bird, what should we do going forward here both on an energy basis and a political basis?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing I get the sort of breakdown of what occurred here in your position sacks</p>
<p>But what do you think free bird should happen going forward? How do we say there&rsquo;s an acute energy shortfall?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just make that up. You can&rsquo;t convert oil into natural gas to heat people&rsquo;s homes</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible structurally right now in the time frame that it&rsquo;s needed. So what should the u.s?</p>
<p>What should the EU be doing now that they&rsquo;re not doing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that there&rsquo;s gonna be this inevitability that we&rsquo;re gonna need to broker a deal with Russia and</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s and what I think you&rsquo;ll see over the next couple of months particularly because winter is coming</p>
<p>is you need to</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of saving face. And so I think I&rsquo;ve always said from the beginning</p>
<p>I think that Putin&rsquo;s calculus is to go as far and as deep as he can go</p>
<p>so that he could eventually negotiate himself back out in a way that leaves him with what he originally wanted in the first place and</p>
<p>I think that there are certain strategic regions and certain strategic assets that it&rsquo;s pretty clear and evident</p>
<p>He wanted and if he&rsquo;s gotten enough in addition to that</p>
<p>He can give up the additional part and he can get sanctions lifted and he can turn gas back on and be left with what</p>
<p>He actually wanted and ultimately get out of this thing</p>
<p>And then the sick the face saving will be from the West will be hey, we got him to give up this</p>
<p>We got him to give up this we got him to agree to non-incursion and there&rsquo;ll be some sort of you know</p>
<p>Hey, we got Putin knocked down a bit and you know, we got him out of there. We did it</p>
<p>We won high five meanwhile Putin smiling because he got exactly what he wanted</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where this is all gonna end up over the next several months</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s if it doesn&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s gonna be significant writing and civil unrest in Europe and</p>
<p>and there will be a significant significant economic effect because so much of Germany and so much of the broader continent is</p>
<p>Dependent on a stable low cost or lower enough cost energy supply for the production of things that are produced in Europe</p>
<p>And if those things can&rsquo;t be produced profitably because the end market won&rsquo;t pay for it</p>
<p>The economy will be shattered</p>
<p>Economies will be shattered and people will be really unhappy</p>
<p>Food will climb and the currency will be destroyed and you know what happens when currencies get destroyed all</p>
<p>Imports become inflated in price and then you have inflation if there isn&rsquo;t a resolution in the next few weeks</p>
<p>There will be civil unrest. There will be a really cataclysmic concerning economic effect</p>
<p>And you think that forces the government&rsquo;s to just fold to Putin and give him some yeah</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know for sure is what are they gonna do from a face-saving move perspective?</p>
<p>What are they gonna say the Ukraine or the the West Alliance Ukraine?</p>
<p>We are gonna have to plow so much money into the Ukraine</p>
<p>To make them feel okay about what we&rsquo;re gonna ask them to do in order to remove</p>
<p>or to end the crisis and so there&rsquo;s gonna be this huge check this huge investment in Ukraine the Western investment in Ukraine the</p>
<p>Support mechanism for the country for the people left behind in order to get this thing resolved</p>
<p>And so my guess is huge amount of money from the West and EU going into Ukraine</p>
<p>Ukraine agrees to let Putin keep some regions some assets</p>
<p>Putin agrees to remove himself from certain regions and give up certain assets sanctions are partially lifted</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re partially lifted enough to get the flow of gas going and to get the economy turning again</p>
<p>Chamath any final thoughts here as we turn around their base here on this of</p>
<p>Lessons learned and how to avoid this you may</p>
<p>You may you may want to find a clip Nick from July where I said the tip of the spear in the fall was going</p>
<p>To be the European energy crisis</p>
<p>Oil is at a hundred and five bucks a barrel. Russia is basically trying to break the back of</p>
<p>Europe by now messing with their nat gas supplies</p>
<p>The German energy minister yesterday said that if that happens it could be a contagion equivalent to Lehman Brothers</p>
<p>With respect to energy</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already starting to see food riots food insecurity energy insecurity rampant inflation</p>
<p>sovereign defaults and</p>
<p>you have to ask yourself like how are we going to really tourniquet this whole thing and prevent a</p>
<p>Much bigger contagion like free bird just talked about if Russia decides to play hardball against</p>
<p>Europe or America</p>
<p>We better hope that it&rsquo;s a mild winter because very quickly you can go from plus 1 million barrels to minus 2 and in a heartbeat</p>
<p>yeah, my final thoughts are the following which is that I think that the</p>
<p>European</p>
<p>System is going to be put under stress because there are really a bunch of different countries with very different incentives right now</p>
<p>Where some countries are in desperate need of energy some countries can probably stave it off for a little bit longer</p>
<p>Other countries are so adamantly focused on their position on</p>
<p>Russia over and above</p>
<p>Any source of energy that they may need or don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>so I just think like this is a really good point to take a step back and realize that in</p>
<p>all of these conflicts</p>
<p>Sadly whenever you have like all of these very complicated countries fighting very complicated wars</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really important to understand what these trade-offs are because ultimately what we&rsquo;re learning in Europe is that</p>
<p>Irrespective of what you morally and ethically believe is right in the Ukraine</p>
<p>The minute that it affects you and Jason you&rsquo;ve said this what is it? Like you&rsquo;re only one meal away from a revolution</p>
<p>So yeah, and I think it would be you&rsquo;re only like five days away from having no heat before people right on the street</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a tad but but that but that&rsquo;s the lesson which is that at the end of the day it is</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in a position of comfort you can focus on</p>
<p>forward-and-outlooking</p>
<p>moral</p>
<p>attributes and ethical perspectives that matter</p>
<p>But the minute that you are affected at home where you cannot take care of your children or heat your house</p>
<p>all bets are off and I think this just goes to show you that</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to sort of engage in proactive foreign policy</p>
<p>You need to make sure that domestically you don&rsquo;t have any Achilles heels and Europe had a massive Achilles heel</p>
<p>Which is energy and then you know the minute that they were well, they stress tested it</p>
<p>Basically, they&rsquo;re gonna have to take this much more seriously going into the next year because they&rsquo;ve enabled a madman</p>
<p>That is the dominant narrative. There is a simplistic binary that has been set up that this is a war between</p>
<p>Autocracy and democracy and that&rsquo;s all there is to it</p>
<p>And my point is that this conflict has always been more complicated than that</p>
<p>okay, and if you really want to understand this conflict you have to go back and understand the history of it and</p>
<p>You know the American media and the British media</p>
<p>They basically act as if this whole thing began on February 24th for a good example of this. There was an excellent piece by</p>
<p>William Perry who is Bill Clinton&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Defense secretary. Okay. He said how the u.s. Lost Russia and how we can restore</p>
<p>Relations and he talks about how we can chart a way forward for peace</p>
<p>Which I think is your question what Perry points out remember again?</p>
<p>He was Clinton&rsquo;s defense secretary in the 1990s. He almost resigned in protest</p>
<p>over NATO expansion eastward</p>
<p>this was basically a contradiction of the verbal assurances that James Baker and and</p>
<p>President George Herbert Walker Bush had given Gorbachev that we would not expand NATO one inch eastward in any event</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when NATO expansion began was the late 90s Perry was against it because like George Kennan like</p>
<p>Former ambassador to the Soviet Union James Matlock. He understood that it would be provocative</p>
<p>It would be seen as a provocative move by Russia. Okay, he was against that policy</p>
<p>The other thing he points out is that in the 1990s the Russian economy collapsed because they moved off of</p>
<p>Soviet system and we did absolutely nothing to help them as a result of that</p>
<p>We bred the conditions for a strong man to emerge who basically</p>
<p>Prioritized the restoration of Russian pride dignity and strength</p>
<p>Okay, so he points out the ways that our policies helped create Putin</p>
<p>I think what he basically suggests in terms of the way forward is look we have to realize that the security architecture of</p>
<p>Europe was crafted in the late 90s and early 2000s at a time when Russia was flat on its back</p>
<p>Okay, what are the Russians basically demanding? What were their demands prior to this war? There were two things</p>
<p>They really didn&rsquo;t like okay. Number one was they didn&rsquo;t know what their doorstep we&rsquo;ve been on</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t want Ukraine admitted to NATO and then number two is they didn&rsquo;t want American missiles</p>
<p>Right on their border that could hit Moscow in five minutes</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>those were their two demands the fact the matter is we never were willing to negotiate at all on those two demands at all and</p>
<p>Instead we basically just claims they were a pretext by the Russians for an invasion. Well look</p>
<p>We never earned the right to call those a pretext if you want to call them a pretext you take those issues off the table</p>
<p>Then if the Russians invade, you know, they&rsquo;re liars</p>
<p>The truth of matter is we refused</p>
<p>We never played that move and so I&rsquo;ll never know I don&rsquo;t disagree with you about that point</p>
<p>Okay, the big lesson here is they need the you the European Union needs to learn</p>
<p>I want to keep going with this because I think this issue is so much deeper</p>
<p>Okay, listen, one of the problems we have in this country is that when a war</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t work out. We just ghost it. We never talk about Afghanistan anymore</p>
<p>We never talk about Iraq anymore. We understand they were gigantic mistakes, but who is analyzing why they happened?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s responsible for the failure the fact the matter is there&rsquo;s been no accountability the same people who drove our</p>
<p>Disastrous foreign policy in the Middle East are the same people who have driven our Ukraine policy in Eastern Europe</p>
<p>There is no military concept. Not just that is the foreign policy elite in this country. Okay</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, so my point is this and you&rsquo;re it sounds to me like you&rsquo;re willing to now say what compromise can we find to</p>
<p>Get out of this war. Okay, my way since I&rsquo;m gonna try and avoid war from the beginning</p>
<p>I do think we did not play the piece of hey if NATO is not here if we don&rsquo;t let them in NATO</p>
<p>And we take that off the table</p>
<p>Will you move these troops back from the border and who we don&rsquo;t know if they ever offered that or not</p>
<p>But I know we do now actually there was there was new information that came out of the last couple of weeks</p>
<p>Okay, obviously they should have offered that. I mean, the real issue here is dependency on</p>
<p>Dictators for energy because if he if he did not have the ability to yank that gas chain if he didn&rsquo;t have that Nord</p>
<p>He would be neutered right? Okay, but we knew that we knew that so so if you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even saying it accurately</p>
<p>If he didn&rsquo;t have Nord it&rsquo;s that doesn&rsquo;t exist without an entire other counterparty agreeing to I agree if Germany</p>
<p>Had kept their nukes going and if they had made other plans, perhaps with them, okay, but</p>
<p>Or the United States. I mean, we don&rsquo;t forget Biden canceled our energy independence the first day. He was in office</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that it&rsquo;s a dictator on the other side. There is a dependency on the other side and that&rsquo;s an issue</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in for energy and dependence since the beginning. I&rsquo;ve been talking about nuclear since the beginning for decades</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking but Jake out one of the challenges is if everyone creates</p>
<p>Independency on all of their supply, then there is no export market for countries that benefit from exports because they have a surplus</p>
<p>And so we see this around the world with food with energy with manufacturing</p>
<p>China a bad thing with oil. That&rsquo;d be a good thing with oil, wouldn&rsquo;t it China? There was no market for it?</p>
<p>If there was no market for oil than a lot of less</p>
<p>A lot of countries that do not have energy stocks</p>
<p>Locally would not be able to acquire energy stocks</p>
<p>Locally would not be able to acquire energy stocks. And so a more free</p>
<p>More does it make sense if you if you&rsquo;re saying if we lowered our use of oil</p>
<p>That would make it cheaper, which means that developing countries would pay less</p>
<p>Jacob, just just let me finish my point for one second</p>
<p>In every country you are either an importer or an exporter</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an importer of manufactured goods or an exporter of manufactured goods. You&rsquo;re an importer of energy</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an exporter of energy an importer of food and exporter of food</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter and we often use this as a way to characterize</p>
<p>The leadership of these countries as being bad when we end up in conflict with them</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that this person is that there&rsquo;s an autocracy on the other side</p>
<p>Or if there&rsquo;s a democracy on the other side at the end of the day</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a global trade agreement, if there&rsquo;s a supply agreement and that supply agreement gets broken</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both parties faults for being dependent on the supply agreement and then allowing conflict</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think what you&rsquo;re saying is accurate and i&rsquo;ll explain why</p>
<p>um reasonable parties</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Who are democracies?</p>
<p>If they get into a trade dispute generally do not invade each other&rsquo;s country. So that&rsquo;s where your argument breaks down</p>
<p>It would be absolutely fantastic. If the lesson the european union learned here was let&rsquo;s not be dependent</p>
<p>What did the united states do to have autocrats? Hold on. Hold on. What did the united states do to iraq?</p>
<p>Okay, did we not invade those countries? I&rsquo;m not talking about that. I&rsquo;m talking about the dependency</p>
<p>You said that democracies do not invade and libya</p>
<p>I said we did two democracies two democracies that are in a trade war are generally not going to invade each other</p>
<p>We invaded afghanistan. Actually, that&rsquo;s 9 11. Okay, and the the first iraq war we invaded we protected. Um</p>
<p>Kuwait, right and so, you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to justify every war the united states has been in i&rsquo;m just talking about in this situation</p>
<p>The eu lowering their dependency and if you were going to lower your dependency on any country you&rsquo;d start with the autocratic ones</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d start with the dictatorships. It&rsquo;s not not logical to you friedberg</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a neoliberal view. Hold on a second. There was a neoliberal view. I&rsquo;d say courted neoliberalism</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called economic interdependence theory, which is that as nations become more interdependent with each other</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re less likely to go to war. China was the perfect example, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the perfect example there was also a belief that as china became richer</p>
<p>They become more democratic that hasn&rsquo;t worked out</p>
<p>So well, i&rsquo;d say economic interdependence theory hasn&rsquo;t worked out so well either</p>
<p>So this is a core failing now you&rsquo;re modifying the theory to say well only economic interdependence among democracy is fine</p>
<p>But that was not the view that was not the view for the last 20 years. It was a core</p>
<p>If we make ourselves dependent on these other countries then somehow it&rsquo;s going to lead to peace</p>
<p>No, it actually has just led to dependency. It was a foolish policy</p>
<p>We should have been energy independent europe should have been energy independent. They should not have made them</p>
<p>I do agree that it was foolish. We&rsquo;re in agreement. Yes, you&rsquo;re disagreeing</p>
<p>No, no, i&rsquo;m not disagreeing with february. I think but but by the way</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not a proponent of people not being energy independent</p>
<p>The reason I think people can be energy independent today is because of technology like nuclear</p>
<p>And I think that all these every country in the world should find a way to get energy independent</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also an advocate of global trade. I am an advocate because I think that global trade enables economic progress</p>
<p>It allows the consumer to get the cheapest product possible</p>
<p>And for the producer to find a market for the products that they make and that there&rsquo;s an element of this which is energy</p>
<p>But energy doesn&rsquo;t need to be a trade traded market as much anymore because of technology</p>
<p>Manufactured goods food. We still haven&rsquo;t cracked the nut on</p>
<p>We are then in agreement freeberg. Yeah</p>
<p>This is sort of an ancillary point, but I just want to say that historically there&rsquo;s been no basis for believing in economic interdependence theory</p>
<p>If you go back to world war one germany and the uk were each other&rsquo;s largest trading partners before world war one</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t stop them from getting into war world war two</p>
<p>I think russia&rsquo;s biggest trading partner was germany up until the moment when hitler invaded them</p>
<p>So listen economic interdependence has never has never madman</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t yeah, but the point is there&rsquo;s very little historical basis for believing that economic interdependence prevents wars</p>
<p>Which by the way that really speaks to the foolishness of our china policy</p>
<p>But look, this is sort of a science question sacks though with it with the china policy because I think this is a very important</p>
<p>discussion we&rsquo;ve discovered which is</p>
<p>Energy independence is one thing and then you have trade which is another and does this actually push off wars?</p>
<p>Do we actually know that we?</p>
<p>We might have actually pushed off a war with china because we make iphones together</p>
<p>Could we have been in a conflict earlier if we weren&rsquo;t so independent and have we actually pushed out a potential conflict?</p>
<p>With taiwan, etc</p>
<p>The interdependence with the benefit of hindsight what we can see</p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight what we can see is that our chinese policy of interdependency really was called constructive engagement</p>
<p>Was a complete and unmitigated disaster. Why?</p>
<p>It was because we made china rich</p>
<p>You go back to the beginning of deng xiaoping beginning getting his economic reforms the average chinese made two dollars a day</p>
<p>Now their economy is roughly the same size as ours</p>
<p>And how are they using their newfound economic wealth to build up their military their navy?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically militarizing the south china sea. They&rsquo;re basically being aggressive towards their neighbors</p>
<p>We fed that chinese tiger until it became a dragon that was capable of challenging us</p>
<p>For global preeminence. That was a foolish foolish strategy. The fact the matter is</p>
<p>That and listen, this is a mistake that economists make is that they only look at whether trade creates surplus as opposed to</p>
<p>the distribution</p>
<p>of those benefits and the fact the matter is</p>
<p>That china benefited disproportionately far more than we did from the china trade over the last</p>
<p>Argument we&rsquo;ve made on this podcast is I think freeberg made it is that we lifted 500 million people</p>
<p>I think I made it as well out of abject poverty in china, but as your point</p>
<p>What yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s going to we have created we have created</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created the return of great power rivalry. We have created a</p>
<p>competitor to the u.s</p>
<p>Who has roughly almost our same size economy?</p>
<p>And that is going to challenge us for privacy and we need diplomacy. We need very sophisticated diplomacy because this situation with china</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not a clear path</p>
<p>Why why is it that you think that we need diplomacy with china when we didn&rsquo;t need it with russia</p>
<p>No, I I do think we did. I fully conceded that we should have avoided</p>
<p>We should have taken note off the table. I said that from day one. Listen, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really important to</p>
<p>Not just say that. Oh, we failed to play chess here that this policy isn&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s not forget how we got into this conflict. We got into this conflict because the administration</p>
<p>Said I think there were four main pillars to</p>
<p>Our current ukraine strategy number one</p>
<p>That ukraine could basically defeat russia if we basically just gave them weapons</p>
<p>That has not happened yet number two</p>
<p>The administration said that sanctions would weaken russia, maybe even destabilize its leadership</p>
<p>And collapse this economy that has not happened</p>
<p>The ruble is at an all-time high and because gas prices have gone up so much their economy has suffered</p>
<p>But on the whole it&rsquo;s still doing pretty well</p>
<p>the third</p>
<p>Contention that was made by advocates of this proxy war is that the sanctions would hurt</p>
<p>Russia more than europe that has not happened. Europe is already hurting more than russia and it&rsquo;s about with winter coming</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to hurt even more and then the last thing</p>
<p>The last contention that was made our support for ukraine would rally</p>
<p>The world around us and would strengthen the western alliance. And I think what we&rsquo;re starting to see</p>
<p>Is that the western alliance is fracturing and you see these gigantic protests in prague and these other countries</p>
<p>so listen, these were the pillars of our</p>
<p>Ukraine policy and they have all turned out to be flawed</p>
<p>And wrong and they&rsquo;re becoming more wrong by the day and yet there is no reappraisal</p>
<p>Of our policy that&rsquo;s coming out of washington or london or paris</p>
<p>None of these leaders are saying that there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re headed for not just an economic crisis, but a political crisis in europe because the fundamental tension</p>
<p>Between the needs of these people which is to basically preserve their economy and to stay warm in their homes</p>
<p>And the ideology of their leaders who are fanatically committed to waging a proxy war against russia instead of finding a diplomatic outcome</p>
<p>That was available last year. It was available in january. It was even available in march or april</p>
<p>That disconnect is the fundamental problem. All right, let&rsquo;s go. Come on. Let&rsquo;s talk about kim k. Come on</p>
<p>There is no word on how much money she&rsquo;s raised for her private equity from from russian oligarchs</p>
<p>But kim will serve as co-founder and co-managing partner</p>
<p>Uh, the firm was co-founded with 16-year carlisle veteran jay</p>
<p>sammons, uh who run day-to-day ops</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>People may not know this but kim founded skims. That&rsquo;s her undergarment company in 2019. It was last valued at 3.2 billion dollars</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>She is obviously got the largest following and is the biggest influencer in the world 329 million followers on instagram alone</p>
<p>Our friend gavin baker, uh responded. Mr. Beast actually. Mr. Beast actually just passed</p>
<p>Okay, so those are</p>
<p>Two examples of people who can put a consumer package good in the world and make it number one instantly gavin</p>
<p>Uh baker a friend of ours, uh tweeted, uh that she adds massive value in this exact regard</p>
<p>Uh, what do you think boys is she gonna have here&rsquo;s why I think here&rsquo;s why I think this is so important go</p>
<p>I I have a really strong belief that in the next 30 years or so</p>
<p>All traditional brands are gonna die</p>
<p>And I think that um what we&rsquo;re seeing happening right now</p>
<p>with the with the power of um</p>
<p>democratized media like us creating a podcast</p>
<p>There are hundreds and now thousands of individuals</p>
<p>Who have stood up and created their own brand and their own presence?</p>
<p>Because of the content that they create on twitch on twitter on youtube, etc</p>
<p>On podcasting and as a result, they become the trusted sources of influence and it&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called influencers</p>
<p>And ultimately these influencers are becoming the brands they can like. Mr</p>
<p>Beast launched a chocolate bar became like the number one chocolate bar in the country</p>
<p>He just opened up a burger restaurant last week</p>
<p>10 000 people showed up number one. No more than that like a hundred thousand or something. It was insane</p>
<p>It was like the number one burger restaurant, uh opening or number one restaurant opening in history</p>
<p>Um, kylie jenner launches a makeup brand takes off becomes this billion dollar brand kim kardashian launches a clothing brand</p>
<p>Becomes a three billion dollar brand. These are not just brands</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re businesses and here&rsquo;s what I think is the most prescient m&amp;a transaction of 2022 and you guys can tell me i&rsquo;m crazy</p>
<p>I think the most important m&amp;a deal of 2022</p>
<p>Was when pen gaming bought barstool sports because it shows that every consumer package good or every consumer services business</p>
<p>Ultimately needs to be a content business and if you don&rsquo;t naturally have content creation in your blood</p>
<p>You have to go and buy a content business or you are going to die</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think all traditional brands that aren&rsquo;t oriented and built around content creation as their primary differentiating foundation</p>
<p>Will not survive and will not be able to compete effectively and instead what we&rsquo;re going to see is influencers</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>individuals that create content build and</p>
<p>Distribute consumer goods and consumer services in a more efficient way because guess what?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got distribution built in distribution is the number one problem with all consumer services and all consumer goods</p>
<p>So I think in the future all advertising</p>
<p>Yeah, all advertising and marketing gets replaced by content creation and content creation direct to consumers through the</p>
<p>Social media platforms becomes the mechanism by which people are aware of and buy goods and services</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think this deal is so important</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s another one of what we&rsquo;re seeing in 2022</p>
<p>Which is the stacking away towards the end of nameless faceless brands and the evolution of the influencer. I think kim kardashian is incredible</p>
<p>She is an incredible</p>
<p>businesswoman</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The fact that she can stand up what will probably be like a multi-billion dollar private equity fund</p>
<p>um, and frankly the companies that she invests in</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>um a really compelling chance of being successful because she can basically pour</p>
<p>So much visibility and notoriety and awareness of a brand</p>
<p>Into that company that that cap table if I was a director, I would say of course give her whatever she wants</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing</p>
<p>And the second thing I would say is that</p>
<p>I think what freeberg says is completely right. I think we&rsquo;re at a point in time where</p>
<p>the biggest thing that if you want to build a consumer business my advice to you as an entrepreneur is</p>
<p>You need to build</p>
<p>direct distribution and scale</p>
<p>Because what that translates into what kim kardashian proves what mr. Beast is proving is it&rsquo;s all about subsidized cac</p>
<p>Where you don&rsquo;t customer cost of that customer acquisition where you are not paying dollars to facebook and google</p>
<p>But instead because you have direct distribution in a relationship with tens or hundreds of millions of users</p>
<p>You can pour them into different experiences</p>
<p>And when you can do that, it&rsquo;s basically virtually zero cost</p>
<p>Your entire margin structure of how you build a consumer business has changed overnight. So that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve proven</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve proven that you need to first build a brand</p>
<p>And then you can put you</p>
<p>Convert that brand into distribution funnel and then to basically pour all kinds of services into it</p>
<p>And one of the services as it turns out is now a private equity fund</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s incredible and I hope she&rsquo;s super successful sax. Do you think this?</p>
<p>influencer, uh</p>
<p>Strategy is here for and going to have a major impact on the venture business. I think it&rsquo;s pretty interesting</p>
<p>Looking at it</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s pretty interesting in the consumer space for the reason freeberg said which is distribution is so hard</p>
<p>So creating a great product is hard distribution is even harder. And this is a realization I had</p>
<p>You know many years ago and which is when I started doing yammer and then you know craft started focusing on sass</p>
<p>Which is at least when you do a b2b product, you know software as a service</p>
<p>You can charge enough money for it that you can get a sales team to pencil</p>
<p>so in other words</p>
<p>You charge an enterprise enough money for the software that you can then pay a salesperson to go out and sell it</p>
<p>So there was always a distribution model built in for b2b</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why i&rsquo;ve always liked that is there&rsquo;s a playbook there where if you just build a good enough</p>
<p>Piece of enterprise software a good enough product. There&rsquo;s always going to be distribution for it</p>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s not true with consumer because consumer products are usually ad based</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t generally charge that much if you can charge at all they have high churn rates and so therefore</p>
<p>B to c only works if you can find a very low cost scalable distribution channel</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what to freeberg&rsquo;s point. I think that&rsquo;s what the kardashians are offering. It&rsquo;s clearly worked for their own products</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll see how extensible it is</p>
<p>But this is really the key challenge with all consumer stuff is just how do you find a very cheap way of distributing it?</p>
<p>in the past the consumer products i&rsquo;ve been involved in</p>
<p>Like paypal or investing in social networks like facebook. They were viral then they were exponentially viral</p>
<p>So they were able to basically grow virally for free</p>
<p>So you either have to have you know extraordinary virality to the product or some other distribution trick</p>
<p>That allows you to scale at low cost because you can&rsquo;t afford a sales team</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re seeing is the base of doing that is to create content. Mr</p>
<p>Beast created content for years before he built a big enough audience to do that</p>
<p>Kim kardashian did content for years before she had a distribution to do that dave portnoy and barstool sports. I mean the guy</p>
<p>dave portnoy</p>
<p>Jason calacanis. Yeah, seriously. I mean portnoy was out uh rating pizza and you know</p>
<p>Now he has all these other kind of you know media and content kind of</p>
<p>Um branches of his platform, but it&rsquo;s all content creation and on top of that content</p>
<p>Not everybody&rsquo;s good at it freeberg. That&rsquo;s the other problem. I get it, but that&rsquo;s not what i&rsquo;m saying and that&rsquo;s my point</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say coca-cola tried to build a content business today. How good would they be? Not very good</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re going to end up dying or they&rsquo;re going to end up needing to buy some really interesting concept</p>
<p>I mean, do you think mr. Beast burger could beat?</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s yes, and that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying. That&rsquo;s my point</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I opened up kind of insane when you think about it if mr. Beast had five thousand franchisees</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is exactly my point that I said at the beginning every traditional brand will get destroyed in 30 years</p>
<p>And they will get destroyed by the influencers that have built an audience through content creation</p>
<p>And now creating businesses on top of that that compete with the traditional incumbents not technology advantaged businesses</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about core consumer goods and services. They also have to be good pen gaming pen gaming does betting</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s no real advantage in betting you build a sports book</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>The reason pen gaming bought barstool is they now have an audience that they can drive to their sports books, right?</p>
<p>And so the same will happen with still have to make a great product though</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>Challenge here is can you also be a product savant?</p>
<p>Can you be a virtuoso in building a product in addition to being an influencer?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s what kim gets right. She makes great product and mr</p>
<p>Beast his first burger was not good. But now this new burger from what I understand is awesome</p>
<p>So you have to have both things switched on I think about think about what&rsquo;s easier and what&rsquo;s harder what&rsquo;s easier</p>
<p>Building an audience of two billion or a billion people that listen or watch you every week or building a great burger</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot harder to build the audience and so</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll bring in a chef if it&rsquo;s a car. It&rsquo;s really hard. Yeah, it&rsquo;s not i&rsquo;m not talking about complicated cars and stuff or electronics</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about basic consumer goods cereal beverages food. Why not?</p>
<p>Um commodity music audio like like all the stuff that&rsquo;s commodity, uh, you know betting I mean this is not a bar</p>
<p>Betting is not a differentiated service offering to consumers. So ultimately, how do you differentiate it&rsquo;s the it&rsquo;s the audience</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;ve now built the brand that you&rsquo;ve built through the audience because of content creation</p>
<p>And so this is why I just want to point out distributed content creation</p>
<p>I think represents one of the most profound investing opportunities over the next decade</p>
<p>Because if you can give individuals the ability to make high quality content</p>
<p>They can scale an audience that that that now can be monetized in a thousand ways</p>
<p>Not just putting friggin ad spots on youtube</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a thousand products you as an as an influencer can build on top of your audience or sell to your audience</p>
<p>Boom, it really changes the whole landscape for cpg and services. Um, and not to bring everything back to mr</p>
<p>beast, but</p>
<p>a large number of his videos he told us, um</p>
<p>He lost money on so the videos at some point started losing him money</p>
<p>And it was an investment in that brand and you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s clearly going to pay off now. I I saw alexis ohanian from</p>
<p>uh, you know reddit fame and</p>
<p>776 to do fun. He went to go see the burger place and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>What like there were at that point in time 10 000 people online. Mr</p>
<p>Beast had to tell people please do not show up which of course</p>
<p>Then 20 000 people show up. Anybody have plugs or anything that they want to get off their chest sacks anything else?</p>
<p>Okay, we got a plug I do</p>
<p>there is a</p>
<p>An epidemic right now of the over prescription</p>
<p>Of amphetamines to children who are diagnosed with adhd</p>
<p>It is</p>
<p>an enormously important issue that</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t just touch kids anymore, but now also touches adults</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>A lot of really kind of bad companies that are over prescribing this stuff get shut down and get sanctioned</p>
<p>Um, so I just wanted to let anybody who&rsquo;s listening. No</p>
<p>And this is me talking my book so take this with a grain of salt but</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a company that i&rsquo;m involved in that has a video game that has been approved by the fda</p>
<p>To be a useful treatment for kids who have been diagnosed with adhd</p>
<p>So if you have an 8 to 11 year old</p>
<p>You can go and talk to your pediatrician to find out about this solution. It&rsquo;s called akili</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called akili</p>
<p>And it will allow you to prescribe to them a video game that they play 30 minutes a day</p>
<p>I just want to make sure people hear the name. It&rsquo;s akili aka ili. So if you do a google search for akili aka</p>
<p>Ili interact go talk to your pediatrician if you are a good child that&rsquo;s dealing with this</p>
<p>Go and read the label have the doctor decide. Okay, so i&rsquo;m not telling you to go do this, but i&rsquo;m asking you</p>
<p>Just look into it</p>
<p>but the idea is that</p>
<p>There are drugs that affect</p>
<p>Your brain and now we are increasingly able to design software</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>exquisitely targets</p>
<p>Certain aspects of your brain and are able to train them</p>
<p>And this is really the first example of such a thing that the fda</p>
<p>Who has reviewed all kinds of?</p>
<p>Clinical data has decided to approve and so it&rsquo;s launching in</p>
<p>The next few weeks we&rsquo;ve already written prescriptions to kids in every single state of the united states</p>
<p>And so to the extent that you&rsquo;re deciding what to do</p>
<p>Or you have a child or you have somebody in your family that is of age 8 to 11 years old that&rsquo;s dealing with this</p>
<p>I would just encourage you to learn about it. That is a plug and you know all the disclaimer</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a great plug</p>
<p>I think we should at the end just talk about some of these we&rsquo;re working on and this is an incredible one</p>
<p>The number of kids</p>
<p>on these, you know</p>
<p>ADHD drugs attention drugs depression anxiety drugs millions. It is out of control</p>
<p>There is and listen, I don&rsquo;t want to tell parents at a parent</p>
<p>But I will say this is becoming a dependency</p>
<p>And the number of drugs I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that new york times story where they put this one girl on 10 drugs</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re prescribing multiple drugs and we don&rsquo;t know exactly what the long-term effects of children using these are and there are other solutions</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not judging any parent</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, not judging any teachers who&rsquo;s advising this but this country and a society needs to really look deeply at this issue and say</p>
<p>Should children because we didn&rsquo;t go on these drugs when we were kids</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t exist and they haven&rsquo;t existed for all of humanity</p>
<p>And we need to think what kind of experiment are we running on 10 20 30 percent of kids in some schools</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re stating something so incredibly important, you know, when you have kids that are preteens and teenagers</p>
<p>Their physiology is changing dramatically and all of a sudden when you introduce a secondary chemical compound into all of that</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exactly right. We don&rsquo;t really know what the outcomes are</p>
<p>And right now I think a lot of people are worried that the over prescription</p>
<p>Of drugs in this kind of condition is going to create a next version of an opioid pandemic</p>
<p>Or epidemic and I think like that&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s exactly the analogy shemoth right now. This statistic is crazy</p>
<p>This is in the new york times express scripts a mail-order pharmacy recently reported that prescriptions of antidepressants for teenagers rose</p>
<p>38 percent from 2015 to 29. We are prescribing these at an alarming rate</p>
<p>I have many parents in my circle who have kids who had what I would consider</p>
<p>modest behavioral issues or modest attention issues and they talked to me about this and they</p>
<p>Felt in multiple cases like they were being bullied or pressured by teachers</p>
<p>to put their kids on behavioral drugs because</p>
<p>Their kids were behaving</p>
<p>10 as badly as I did in middle school or high school</p>
<p>This is being used</p>
<p>I believe this is my personal belief. I know there are some kids who need these drugs or I assume that there are</p>
<p>But I think this is being used to keep kids in their seats and to make it easier</p>
<p>For parents to have to deal with what are normally the hardships of teenager, you know</p>
<p>Teenagers and just be very careful parents</p>
<p>About the extent to which you you know, you might be being pressured perhaps parents have told me they felt bullied</p>
<p>Into giving their kids these drugs. It really is infuriating to me and I think it&rsquo;s really great that you</p>
<p>People should look into it exercise talking to your kids. These things also work</p>
<p>We had a guidance counselor at</p>
<p>at our school</p>
<p>Tell me that they thought that one of my children should just get put on these drugs</p>
<p>and I was like</p>
<p>It was</p>
<p>The most random statement and all I could get from her</p>
<p>Was that she just didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the fact that every now and then?</p>
<p>This kid would just you know be exuberant</p>
<p>Yeah to your point. I want to kill their spirit. I had the same conversation</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into it too much. But you know, I think that these teachers now and i&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s all teachers</p>
<p>They are like it&rsquo;s just easier to manage kids who are on focused energy drugs</p>
<p>And then there are some parents who want their kids to do really good on standardized testing</p>
<p>I would have done better on standardized testing if I was on</p>
<p>Adderall or whatever these attention drugs are we everybody would score 10 better</p>
<p>But what does it do to the quality of your life long term?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question we need to ask about this stuff and we don&rsquo;t have answers for it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be tom cruise on this podcast</p>
<p>But there are other ways to keep</p>
<p>You know kids healthy and to deal with these issues and I think these things are to say they&rsquo;re over prescribed</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a huge understatement. We&rsquo;re going to look at this like the opioid crisis. I guarantee it</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly if you you start dope sick, right and</p>
<p>People thought they were doing the right thing. Oh these people have pain this drug manages pain</p>
<p>And then they found out like oh, yeah, you know what this drug also makes you can make you an addict and could ruin your life</p>
<p>Uh great job on that investment. Um, and I and I hope it works</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you, uh sax anything else, uh any companies in your portfolio</p>
<p>You want to give a shout out to we might as well get something out of this fucking pod since we&rsquo;re leaving</p>
<p>Seven and a half million dollars on the fucking table and you guys won&rsquo;t even let me run all in summit too</p>
<p>So I can get a half milli</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything to plug right now, but no company you invested in you need a plug for how about you super gut?</p>
<p>Can we get some supergut.com in here? These bars taste great. Friedberg. I love this. Thank you</p>
<p>Thank you. I literally just ordered another pack of them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad. Thank you. They&rsquo;re delicious</p>
<p>Super gut do you have supergut.com? By the way, this is where i&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>Yeah, supergut.com, but i&rsquo;m this is actually one of my d2c companies</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m having a lot of these conversations about how do you actually</p>
<p>avoid just buying ads on facebook and</p>
<p>Uh google and how do you actually build an audience, right?</p>
<p>How do you ultimately convert your customers by creating content? And so this was originally unique, right? And then you changed it</p>
<p>Yeah based on the science around. Um</p>
<p>around resistant starch and how it changes the gut biome and so</p>
<p>Um, but this is general i&rsquo;m on the board of a couple of d2c companies and it is universally the conversation right now</p>
<p>Because in the last year</p>
<p>the cost of d2c, uh direct to consumer marketing on facebook and google</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brutal double tripled and a lot of the unit economics are falling apart on d2c businesses because of it</p>
<p>You know costs a lot more to acquire the customer than you make from them</p>
<p>And so everyone&rsquo;s scrambling to figure out okay</p>
<p>How do I acquire customers and that&rsquo;s where this content creation strategy is becoming a critical linchpin for most consumer businesses now</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really important part</p>
<p>I think a couple of us are investors in eight sleep and they were like, please let us advertise on all in</p>
<p>I was like, sorry, no ads, but i&rsquo;ll shout you out here eight sleep. It&rsquo;s great product</p>
<p>I have a plug but I want to save it. So</p>
<p>Like fucking drop a plug for one. No, no, the product hasn&rsquo;t launched yet</p>
<p>Give me like a month</p>
<p>All right</p>
<p>And if anybody wants to be a venture investor</p>
<p>Jason at calacanis.com to come to one of my webinars and see my list fund since we</p>
<p>Started allowing all these plugs. I thought we</p>
<p>It was a setup. It was a setup</p>
<p>I just wanted to do a roundup of plugs so I could get mine in so i was being generous</p>
<p>Worked plan worked. I got you on the hook for yours. What was your what was your plug?</p>
<p>What were you doing your venture fund? I&rsquo;m doing what&rsquo;s fun for and well for plugging stuff</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be over subscribe plug. I&rsquo;ll plug the call</p>
<p>If you want to call it up, we&rsquo;re all in everybody&rsquo;s calling up. Let&rsquo;s you know, we should do a call in</p>
<p>We should all do like an after hours where we take questions from the audience. That would be great</p>
<p>I would do that. Yeah, I would do that. Can I get a point? All right, let&rsquo;s go everybody</p>
<p>This has been all in episode 95. Wait, wait, should we do that? Create more?</p>
<p>Jake out that wasn&rsquo;t that that was another deal you turned down just like the ukraine deal</p>
<p>This is a theme here is that you turn down deals you later regret</p>
<p>Nine months later you admit I was right you should have taken the deal</p>
<p>I should take the quality. Look how hard chamath is crashing right now. Look at him. Look at it. What time is it there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 11 30, right?</p>
<p>Midnight, it&rsquo;s 11 30. It&rsquo;s 11 30. That&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing my life. I lost my voice. I lost my voice</p>
<p>Send us an invite for uh, ama for the four of us on calling calling. I&rsquo;ll do that. Everybody down. Yeah, we should do that</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah, just remember</p>
<p>Maybe yeah live ama live ama with the best</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show up. Maybe I&rsquo;ll show up for snacks</p>
<p>Jake yeah, i&rsquo;ll show up. I&rsquo;d love i&rsquo;d be happy to do it. I&rsquo;m back in the united states tomorrow</p>
