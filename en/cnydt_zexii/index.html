<p>i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s causing all my</p>
<p>inflammation i&rsquo;ve been my doctor won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help i had to fight to get some tests i</p>
<p>thought maybe i had fabry&rsquo;s disease but</p>
<p>that came back negative but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inconclusive</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been taking some of those uh like</p>
<p>vino things that seems to help digesting</p>
<p>a lot of gas so that&rsquo;s where i was kind</p>
<p>of leaning with that i seem like i have</p>
<p>a hard time with like broccoli</p>
<p>especially your pills which by the way i</p>
<p>have almost everything that you sell and</p>
<p>if i don&rsquo;t i&rsquo;ll probably you know half</p>
<p>at it so</p>
<p>last night i actually took too many</p>
<p>pills because i&rsquo;ve been trying to work</p>
<p>on my lip</p>
<p>oops well doc he dropped off again</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s fine i have this is</p>
<p>recorded and i have as much of i have</p>
<p>enough information to tell him</p>
<p>some things to do the the the thing is</p>
<p>though if if you have a</p>
<p>coronary artery calcification test which</p>
<p>actually by the way is one of the best</p>
<p>predictors</p>
<p>for not just heart attacks and heart</p>
<p>deaths but also</p>
<p>all cause mortality so it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>um risk it&rsquo;s a great um</p>
<p>way to</p>
<p>really see how healthy you are and the</p>
<p>thing is if you just get one test you</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t know what it was before so</p>
<p>you just have nothing to compare it to</p>
<p>when when you evaluate something you</p>
<p>always need two</p>
<p>at least two of something right to</p>
<p>evaluate or else you don&rsquo;t know well how</p>
<p>how was i before you have you can you</p>
<p>can compare it based on normal</p>
<p>um and yeah 500 is is too high um i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had people had over a thousand</p>
<p>so it could be a lot better but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing to know um the most important</p>
<p>thing is to</p>
<p>do the right thing and then test it over</p>
<p>time so i would wait two months and</p>
<p>retest it and it should be coming down</p>
<p>and then we know it&rsquo;s working so of</p>
<p>course to remove calcium we want to</p>
<p>remove the actual reason why you have</p>
<p>calcium in the first place which is</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>oxidation things like that so like</p>
<p>vitamin k2</p>
<p>tocatrinals is all really important</p>
<p>going low carb doing fasting all those</p>
<p>things are going to greatly help i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to be releasing a new video this</p>
<p>week</p>
<p>on some advance some additional</p>
<p>advanced um</p>
<p>things that you can find out from your</p>
<p>blood test but you have to get a</p>
<p>you have to get a</p>
<p>an advanced lipid profile to do it and</p>
<p>unfortunately a lot of the</p>
<p>doctors don&rsquo;t really even understand</p>
<p>some of these additional uh</p>
<p>things that go beyond just total</p>
<p>cholesterol ldl hdl</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m going to clarify that</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>give you some</p>
<p>i think the name of this video is going</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>the um</p>
<p>unusual</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>or surprising risk factors that you</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t heard about when you</p>
<p>for a heart attack</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;ll talk about that and some of the</p>
<p>best</p>
<p>things to look at that go way beyond</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>total cholesterol and even ldl so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that being said if you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>something that is irritating you</p>
<p>especially taking a lot of supplements</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>back off them for a while and then just</p>
<p>introduce one at a time to isolate what</p>
<p>what is creating that symptom and then</p>
<p>avoid that for a while and it could be</p>
<p>something related to fiber or who knows</p>
<p>what it could be so</p>
<p>that is the problem of taking a whole</p>
<p>bunch of things at once you really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>what is um</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>making the symptom</p>
<p>okay all right chris we hope that uh</p>
<p>that gives you a nice answer i hope you</p>
<p>log on and watch it and i remind</p>
<p>everybody of course both facebook and</p>
<p>youtube the show is recorded afterwards</p>
<p>and captured so you can watch it in</p>
<p>perpetuity</p>
<p>and terry our producers fingers must be</p>
<p>throbbing because he has really done a</p>
<p>great job for our social media</p>
<p>participants and we&rsquo;ve got a ton of</p>
<p>questions let&rsquo;s start off with blue</p>
<p>games that&rsquo;s apparently the non-degear</p>
<p>that this person uses from youtube i am</p>
<p>a 43 year old female on omad i f healthy</p>
<p>keto and i&rsquo;m suffering from severe</p>
<p>internal body heat or heat intolerance</p>
<p>with little or no sweating ouch doc any</p>
<p>uh remedy</p>
<p>what was the age again that she said</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>yeah i mean</li>
</ol>
<p>it sounds to me like it could be like a</p>
<p>perimenopausal symptom that is not</p>
<p>necessarily a</p>
<p>um you know night sweats but your body</p>
<p>does</p>
<p>the the thermostat uh in your in your</p>
<p>body is actually on the hypothalamus and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s in the same nuclei or the same</p>
<p>nerve bundle is where you have other</p>
<p>things are related to menopause so as</p>
<p>this change occurs</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s could be a little circuitry</p>
<p>problem with temperature and so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what happens is you get an increase</p>
<p>of two hormones one is coming up from</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>hypothalamus the other one&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>from your pituitary so it&rsquo;s called that</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>gonadotropic releasing hormone and also</p>
<p>the luteinizing hormone so</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s like kind of compensating for</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>maybe some changes in the ovary</p>
<p>and if you can normalize those uh things</p>
<p>will probably be a lot better and i</p>
<p>think one of the best remedies for that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>something i&rsquo;m going to reveal in a video</p>
<p>in two days from now uh it&rsquo;s i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>release a video on that and i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to give it away because i always</p>
<p>always do that on the show and then</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t watch my video</p>
<p>so um stay tuned for that video on</p>
<p>the best remedy for perimenopause as</p>
<p>well as menstrual</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that would be my long answer to that</p>
<p>steve well that&rsquo;s good and boy certainly</p>
<p>a lot of the population half of them</p>
<p>roughly that are concerned about that</p>
<p>sort of thing so that&rsquo;s terrific all</p>
<p>right back to youtube serbia</p>
<p>uh is 24 this is unusual or interesting</p>
<p>my tongue gets red</p>
<p>and under the area my tongue is burning</p>
<p>with mesh-like structure forming behind</p>
<p>my lips my stomach always burns after i</p>
<p>eat</p>
<p>i do not do alcohol tobacco or coffee or</p>
<p>tea maybe he should start</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sounds like a severe b12</p>
<p>deficiency</p>
<p>red tongue burning tongue i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a b12 that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a b12 now you could you said</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s say your your diet is really</p>
<p>good well it could be</p>
<p>you have some type of um</p>
<p>something called pernicious anemia which</p>
<p>is a</p>
<p>um or like some autoimmune condition to</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called the intrinsic factor i</p>
<p>would look at my videos on b12 to see</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another genetic video</p>
<p>genetic factor that it&rsquo;s in a video that</p>
<p>i did on</p>
<p>b12 you have to really make sure you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>the wrong version of b12 you want to</p>
<p>take the natural version which is the</p>
<p>methylcobolamine</p>
<p>not the cyanocobolomy</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>watch that video</p>
<p>and see if you can sort that out and one</p>
<p>really interesting thing that you might</p>
<p>want to consider is to do a genetic test</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s becoming more popular you the</p>
<p>genetic tests i really like because you</p>
<p>can find out your weaknesses and it</p>
<p>gives you a lot of data</p>
<p>the problem is trying to find someone to</p>
<p>interpret that data so um</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re out there</p>
<p>um so you have to find someone in in</p>
<p>functional medicine that really</p>
<p>understands</p>
<p>uh what to do with the data</p>
<p>wow well we pray you get over that one</p>
<p>that is really uh awful sounding uh</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good sounding is our first</p>
<p>question of the day this is interesting</p>
<p>doc and there you have it</p>
<p>okay what increases</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t even read that mortality risk</p>
<p>sugar or vegetable oils oh okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right in front of my camera right here</p>
<p>okay yeah what increases your mortality</p>
<p>risk</p>
<p>um sugar or vegetable oils so what</p>
<p>causes a greater</p>
<p>increase in death and deaths</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>seed oils</p>
<p>and vegetables</p>
<p>and we used to think they were so good</p>
<p>for you</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s find out who else is</p>
<p>listening uh besides our great folks in</p>
<p>the green room</p>
<p>and uh terry wants to say a good morning</p>
<p>to all our viewers joining from the uk</p>
<p>canada scotland egypt saudi arabia</p>
<p>belgium trinidad tobago greece japan</p>
<p>algeria cameroon australia france</p>
<p>germany mexico sweden taiwan the</p>
<p>netherlands turkey</p>
<p>philippines macedonia india norway</p>
<p>nigeria hungary poland argentina haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard from them for a while bermuda</p>
<p>brazil switzerland panama portugal</p>
<p>iceland the united arab emirates welcome</p>
<p>folks chile ghana south africa pakistan</p>
<p>iraq new zealand italy peru bulgaria</p>
<p>iran</p>
<p>guyana hong kong croatia i haven&rsquo;t heard</p>
<p>from them while either spain jordan and</p>
<p>all across these united states and i</p>
<p>always accuse terry of not saying canada</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t recall him saying that but</p>
<p>anyway welcome canada in case we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have you in there because i know you all</p>
<p>are listening and then let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>uh social media oh wow he typed even</p>
<p>some more so i may have missed it anyway</p>
<p>amy from youtube why have i stopped</p>
<p>losing weight i&rsquo;ve been on clean keto</p>
<p>and i have been doing extreme workouts</p>
<p>the weight was falling off but now it</p>
<p>stopped help</p>
<p>well you know i always like to um</p>
<p>do a periodic video on that topic</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you know as time goes on i i i</p>
<p>constantly am finding more more</p>
<p>more data more strategies more things to</p>
<p>do to speed up</p>
<p>that result because you can always</p>
<p>improve</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>problem of having a plateaued weight and</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m going to be i just did another</p>
<p>video on it and there&rsquo;s a couple things</p>
<p>that you can look at and of course the</p>
<p>thing that i can&rsquo;t i constantly keep</p>
<p>talking about is to</p>
<p>bring your carbs down to close to zero</p>
<p>as possible fast longer but there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>other things</p>
<p>you can do</p>
<p>especially with fats like</p>
<p>realize that the more dietary fat that</p>
<p>you consume the less</p>
<p>of your own body fat are you gonna</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna use so</p>
<p>uh we want to mobilize your own fat so</p>
<p>in that case you don&rsquo;t want to be taking</p>
<p>extra</p>
<p>like keto bombs or like as desserts mct</p>
<p>oil</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to restrict your fat like</p>
<p>from normal protein but you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to add more fat that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the other thing the other big factor and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to talk about this in the</p>
<p>video</p>
<p>is the stress stress is</p>
<p>similar to eating sugar why because it</p>
<p>releases cortisol what&rsquo;s another name</p>
<p>for cortisol</p>
<p>glucocorticoid it means it&rsquo;s a glucose</p>
<p>controlling hormone</p>
<p>so the more cortisol that increases</p>
<p>the more</p>
<p>sugar that your body your liver makes</p>
<p>and then all sudden that raises insulin</p>
<p>so you can even become a diabetic by</p>
<p>having this spike in cortisol i mean</p>
<p>i know of a person off the hand that um</p>
<p>that took prednisone</p>
<p>which is a type of a synthetic cortisol</p>
<p>and ended up with diabetes and of course</p>
<p>the doctor didn&rsquo;t connect the dots i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like i mean it was it was perfectly</p>
<p>right after that situation</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that is one of the side effects um</p>
<p>that is not really</p>
<p>promoted and</p>
<p>acknowledged when you take these</p>
<p>steroids unfortunately i i took them</p>
<p>every year for many years because of</p>
<p>this darn poison ivy problem that i have</p>
<p>so that kind of messed up my adrenals so</p>
<p>um i</p>
<p>again um</p>
<p>on a positive note if i didn&rsquo;t have all</p>
<p>these physical problems i probably</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even be doing</p>
<p>this podcast right here because i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in it as much as</p>
<p>i am now</p>
<p>yeah doc was the original petri dish and</p>
<p>has poked and prodded himself through</p>
<p>the years in fact i remember you talking</p>
<p>before he used to make these sort of</p>
<p>concoctions and eat them and turn blue</p>
<p>and say nope</p>
<p>not that one</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done every single experiment i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken every supplement to try things and</p>
<p>detox myself and got sick so many times</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i am the</p>
<p>human guinea pig</p>
<p>so well we all thank you for your</p>
<p>sacrifice the audience uh as always is</p>
<p>always on it and you ask them which</p>
<p>increases your mortality risk sugar or</p>
<p>vegetable oils 55</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s vegetable oil and 45 percent</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s sugar any winners</p>
<p>you know this will surprise you in a</p>
<p>video that i will release</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s vegetables</p>
<p>by a factor of of</p>
<p>i mean quite a bit quite a bit there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only really two other things</p>
<p>that are more deadly</p>
<p>than</p>
<p>vegetable oils and that would be</p>
<p>a heavy smoke heavy smoking</p>
<p>as well as um let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>one heavy smoking</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>obesity like i mean</p>
<p>really overweight other than that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>sugar is kind of uh lower on the list</p>
<p>so um stay tuned for that video</p>
<p>but these omega</p>
<p>6 fatty acids are very</p>
<p>pro</p>
<p>inflammatory</p>
<p>and they um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re we need omega-6 fatty acids but</p>
<p>we definitely don&rsquo;t need the ratios of</p>
<p>like an average person has 20 to one 20</p>
<p>omega 6 to only one omega 3 fatty acid</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s like just way off the charts</p>
<p>and so in this in</p>
<p>two videos i&rsquo;m going to be doing this</p>
<p>week i&rsquo;ll be talking about that and what</p>
<p>you can do about to reverse that because</p>
<p>i mean your</p>
<p>body problems could be just a matter</p>
<p>of making this</p>
<p>adjustment of these two fats and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>also going to release a video on the</p>
<p>simple way to do it because so to not</p>
<p>make it too complex</p>
<p>okay here&rsquo;s another interesting name lab</p>
<p>tech 66</p>
<p>from youtube says i believe i am</p>
<p>suffering from exposure to mold i found</p>
<p>a roof leak that wasn&rsquo;t repaired</p>
<p>properly and now i am exhausted with</p>
<p>severe muscle and joint pain chronic</p>
<p>sinus and skin issues what should i do</p>
<p>to address these issues</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>really good remedy that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>growing in your backyard or in the field</p>
<p>down the road somewhere that you can get</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called milk</p>
<p>thistle it&rsquo;s this prickery</p>
<p>huge plant that has</p>
<p>these kind of like purple flowers that</p>
<p>then turn white and you can grab the</p>
<p>seeds out of them grind them up in a</p>
<p>coffee grinder and put them on your</p>
<p>salad</p>
<p>and uh that actually um</p>
<p>here i&rsquo;m giving away the answer to the</p>
<p>next quiz question um that can greatly</p>
<p>neutralize</p>
<p>poisons okay from</p>
<p>mold</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>snake bites</p>
<p>from poisonous mushrooms</p>
<p>and the list goes on and on and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all i&rsquo;m going to say</p>
<p>all right well listen and terry&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>enough of me every week he puts canada</p>
<p>second he just admonished me for that so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll remember that canada you&rsquo;re always</p>
<p>represented thanks to terry rylu from</p>
<p>facebook thank you so much dr berg your</p>
<p>heart is so generous thank you for all</p>
<p>the information you have shared with us</p>
<p>there they go again uh satisfied</p>
<p>customers so it&rsquo;s great to hear all the</p>
<p>successes</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>oh lisa from facebook should someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s recovering from a stroke still be</p>
<p>feeling dizzy every day</p>
<p>well ideally not but it does take some</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really good remedy</p>
<p>that you can take</p>
<p>to recover from stroke and that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>amount of</p>
<p>vitamin e okay and i would the one i</p>
<p>would recommend is the tocatrinos</p>
<p>uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>several studies that show that when you</p>
<p>take the tocotrienols</p>
<p>without the tocopherols</p>
<p>that can actually increase your recovery</p>
<p>from stroke because we have a lot of</p>
<p>brain damage and you need something fat</p>
<p>soluble to penetrate the myelin sheath</p>
<p>and open up the</p>
<p>the vascular part of your brain so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i would recommend and also</p>
<p>the other thing i would do is i would do</p>
<p>a lot of fasting</p>
<p>and then of course with your regular</p>
<p>nutrients</p>
<p>that you need when you fast</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s try another question doc</p>
<p>here you go</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so does lemon acidify or alkalize</p>
<p>our body</p>
<p>okay and maybe that&rsquo;s an appropriate</p>
<p>precursor to cecilia from facebook&rsquo;s</p>
<p>question an oft-asked question please</p>
<p>educate us on how to treat acid reflux</p>
<p>typically what happens is that you have</p>
<p>a weakened</p>
<p>stomach acid situation where your ph</p>
<p>is no longer between one and three it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>four five</p>
<p>even six or even seven</p>
<p>there was a test that i did in my clinic</p>
<p>that you have a person swallow a pill</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on a string and it goes down to</p>
<p>their stomach and you have them lay on</p>
<p>their right side for about</p>
<p>i think 10 minutes and then you pull up</p>
<p>the string and you you measure the ph of</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>of that little capsule which absorbs the</p>
<p>acid</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>it was like one for one people that have</p>
<p>acid reflux their ph was</p>
<p>like five six</p>
<p>sometimes neutral i mean that&rsquo;s crazy so</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have very much stomach acid</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s nothing to</p>
<p>to send signals to the valve on top of</p>
<p>the stomach to keep it closed that valve</p>
<p>so then it stays open and regurgitates</p>
<p>you get acid reflux and heartburn so</p>
<p>the solution is to acidify</p>
<p>the stomach</p>
<p>and what do people do they alkalize the</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>so if you acidify with betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride take about five before a</p>
<p>meal go slow because you might have an</p>
<p>ulcer and then you can um acidify the</p>
<p>stomach and then if you have an ulcer</p>
<p>you have to heal the stomach first with</p>
<p>something like</p>
<p>chlorophyll or wheatgrass juice powder</p>
<p>and then acidify it let&rsquo;s say several</p>
<p>months down the road but steve the</p>
<p>reason why i stopped doing that test</p>
<p>even though it was a great test</p>
<p>is one</p>
<p>one person had a really dry throat</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the capsule got stuck</p>
<p>in her throat so here i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m pulling</p>
<p>pulling the string up like a like a fish</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hooked down there i&rsquo;m pulling</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t come out</p>
<p>and i said you know what i&rsquo;m just going</p>
<p>to cut the string and just swallow it</p>
<p>and just let it go through the other</p>
<p>other way but um i said that&rsquo;s it i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not doing this test anymore because this</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>scaring the heck out of me and that</p>
<p>person awful did you attend the funeral</p>
<p>no she&rsquo;s survived oh thank goodness okay</p>
<p>and uh we have answers already on quiz</p>
<p>question number two and it asks does</p>
<p>lemon acidify or alkalize your body</p>
<p>and our recipients uh</p>
<p>said</p>
<p>our guest said let&rsquo;s respond and excuse</p>
<p>me 77</p>
<p>say lemon alkalizes the body and 23 say</p>
<p>it acidifies the body</p>
<p>so it initially acidifies but the citric</p>
<p>acid</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in citrus</p>
<p>fruits</p>
<p>will um break down pretty quick within</p>
<p>probably an hour and oxidizes to an</p>
<p>alkaline substance so it will alkalize</p>
<p>people this is why</p>
<p>people that have calcium deposits</p>
<p>that have arthritis</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re usually way too alkaline in</p>
<p>the first place and when they take</p>
<p>citrus especially the fruits</p>
<p>oh my gosh about an hour later they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stiff as a board</p>
<p>so they need to</p>
<p>acidify their body and their that</p>
<p>mobilize the calcium because think about</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>like if you go outside and you have your</p>
<p>little faucet that has some calcium</p>
<p>deposits on it that&rsquo;s because the water</p>
<p>is more alkaline</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>when you acidify it especially like</p>
<p>having a really strong acid stomach you</p>
<p>can help</p>
<p>keep the calcium from</p>
<p>forming deposits throughout your body</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a little tip that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar is really good for</p>
<p>arthritis</p>
<p>interesting okay waiting patiently from</p>
<p>uh i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>england texas is rainy uh and rainy you</p>
<p>are on hang on let me push the button</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on with dr berg go ahead with you</p>
<p>your quick question rainey</p>
<p>hi good morning uh i&rsquo;m from ingram texas</p>
<p>oops anyway i&rsquo;m 64 years old</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been doing healthy keto and one</p>
<p>meal a day for over five years</p>
<p>but since the pandemic i increased my</p>
<p>vitamin d</p>
<p>three to three thirty thousand but i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>increase the k2 so i&rsquo;ve been doing this</p>
<p>for about two plus years since march of</p>
<p>2020.</p>
<p>that i knew that keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting is very</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory but i started</p>
<p>developing</p>
<p>arthritic</p>
<p>symptoms in my wrist and my hands</p>
<p>my hips</p>
<p>and so it puzzled me so i&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>possibly uh</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve been taking too much d and</p>
<p>not enough k could that be the reason</p>
<p>why and</p>
<p>can it be reversed</p>
<p>yeah i think i think it can be reversed</p>
<p>and yes i think that&rsquo;s the reason why</p>
<p>because think about it when you</p>
<p>so vitamin d increases the calcium in</p>
<p>the blood by um a factor of like 20x</p>
<p>but if we don&rsquo;t have enough k2 from your</p>
<p>diet that can take it</p>
<p>from your blood to the bone then it kind</p>
<p>of it goes out through the joints it can</p>
<p>aggravate arthritic type problems so i</p>
<p>would</p>
<p>for a while not take any d and just take</p>
<p>k2</p>
<p>until your joints feel better and then</p>
<p>go back to taking both of them together</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i always recommend taking</p>
<p>both of them together and in the um the</p>
<p>ratio</p>
<p>normally is like if you have 10 000 ius</p>
<p>of vitamin d3 you&rsquo;d want about 100</p>
<p>micrograms of k2 in your case you might</p>
<p>want to do</p>
<p>four times the k2</p>
<p>and then like half the vitamin d3 just</p>
<p>to kind of balance you back to where you</p>
<p>need to be</p>
<p>when you know when people talk about</p>
<p>vitamin d as being um like 10 000 i use</p>
<p>which i think is a good maintenance dose</p>
<p>sometimes they freak out they think oh</p>
<p>my gosh it&rsquo;s so much ten thousand i use</p>
<p>well ten thousand i use is really only</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>micrograms which is only</p>
<p>0.25</p>
<p>milligrams so that&rsquo;s like 1 4 of 1</p>
<p>milligram that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what 10 000 i</p>
<p>uses but um</p>
<p>but it sounds like such a big number</p>
<p>so i think uh</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s all you need to do</p>
<p>okay thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome thank you so much for</p>
<p>joining us rainey</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d love to hear back from you uh</p>
<p>to for your continued uh progress</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re striving for health so that</p>
<p>is terrific let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go</p>
<p>back to</p>
<p>uh social media of course tanya</p>
<p>uh from in maryland on facebook i need</p>
<p>help with thinning hair and bald spots i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t find a dermatologist who will</p>
<p>address these issues help</p>
<p>so it sounds like alopecia there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great video i released i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you saw a good tip for</p>
<p>for hair growth um which is basically</p>
<p>jello but of course i would do gelatin i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do just regular the artificial</p>
<p>sweetener type stuff but gelatin which</p>
<p>is also in um collagen supplements um</p>
<p>will help with alopecia and hair loss</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>not 100 of the cases so</p>
<p>there are other factors there&rsquo;s hormonal</p>
<p>issues</p>
<p>uh high dha or dht i&rsquo;m sorry and also</p>
<p>there could be a</p>
<p>trace mineral deficiency possibly so um</p>
<p>of course i&rsquo;m not um</p>
<p>here to promote my products but i do</p>
<p>have a hair formula that you might want</p>
<p>to consider because it has everything in</p>
<p>it but in the meantime</p>
<p>try to get some gelatin</p>
<p>and see if that doesn&rsquo;t just help you</p>
<p>and the last thing i will mention</p>
<p>regardless of whatever symptom you have</p>
<p>including hair loss you always want to</p>
<p>kind of figure out when did this thing</p>
<p>start</p>
<p>and what happened</p>
<p>before right before it okay to get the</p>
<p>clue that you need</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always something in the</p>
<p>background that might have triggered it</p>
<p>to give you</p>
<p>some idea on what to take or what to do</p>
<p>terrific uh let&rsquo;s go to gail</p>
<p>you elmo i had it right before now i</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t say it from facebook i usually</p>
<p>boil a large pot of hibiscus tea and</p>
<p>then put it in the fridge after it cools</p>
<p>will it still keep his properties when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s consumed cold</p>
<p>yeah absolutely</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s good to know so chug</p>
<p>away that nice cold brew you have there</p>
<p>mickey from facebook could you address</p>
<p>oh the issues of premature ejaculation</p>
<p>and low levels of serotonin</p>
<p>well again this i i don&rsquo;t have your</p>
<p>history i would um</p>
<p>uh for example i mean it could be a</p>
<p>problem with um</p>
<p>um what your diet is uh especially when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>issues like erectile dysfunction</p>
<p>premature ejaculation or even low</p>
<p>testosterone</p>
<p>um there could be many different reasons</p>
<p>for that it could be too much</p>
<p>estrogen it could be</p>
<p>that you have insulin resistance in the</p>
<p>arteries</p>
<p>not just in your</p>
<p>in your private parts are a problem but</p>
<p>also in the arteries in the physical the</p>
<p>arteries as well in your heart</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s uh there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>i would watch my videos on the topic</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t have a quick</p>
<p>answer for that</p>
<p>all right well good luck and uh thanks</p>
<p>for your courage and asking the question</p>
<p>that you know involves a lot of people</p>
<p>dmp from youtube i just finished a 21</p>
<p>day</p>
<p>cycle of doxy doxycycline</p>
<p>after being diagnosed with lyme disease</p>
<p>what do i do now thanks for your advice</p>
<p>i feel for you that&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nasty condition and it&rsquo;s a nasty</p>
<p>treatment you you better be putting that</p>
<p>probiotic back into your body for sure</p>
<p>um or that good bacteria immediately and</p>
<p>start consuming</p>
<p>uh foods that will build up like the</p>
<p>fermented vegetables but i would i would</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>watch my video online because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some natural</p>
<p>things to take because even like</p>
<p>sometimes one round of antibiotics</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cut it and they want to have you</p>
<p>continue for</p>
<p>for a long time but there are</p>
<p>natural antibiotics like</p>
<p>garlic</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>oregano oil thyme sage that you can take</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t affect your good bacteria</p>
<p>only the only the pathogen the other</p>
<p>thing is colloidal silver is a really</p>
<p>good remedy</p>
<p>for lime</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good remedy</p>
<p>and no it won&rsquo;t turn your your skin blue</p>
<p>unless you drank a gallon of it but um</p>
<p>the other thing too is that um</p>
<p>this nasty um</p>
<p>spirochite goes in there and hides</p>
<p>into biofilms and spreads to the body so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i could probably spend an hour on what</p>
<p>to do but i think i would watch my</p>
<p>videos and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to just keep working</p>
<p>at it to keep your immune system really</p>
<p>really strong</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the key to the whole thing</p>
<p>all right very good evelyn from youtube</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 60 years old and had a full</p>
<p>hysterectomy ten years ago can you</p>
<p>please do a video on the nutrients women</p>
<p>in our situation need if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>already</p>
<p>well i think i have but i think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good idea to do a video</p>
<p>on hysterectomy i&rsquo;ll give you one tip</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i would there&rsquo;s standard process has a</p>
<p>really good product called</p>
<p>utrophin</p>
<p>pmg okay eutrophin pmg i would find that</p>
<p>product i would take it i would take two</p>
<p>before bed</p>
<p>and it works really really good for</p>
<p>women who had a hysterectomy so um</p>
<p>but i will do a video on that</p>
<p>because i think that&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>all right and i&rsquo;m sure a lot of women</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t uh have had that procedure</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just kind of a standard</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>probably this relates to</p>
<p>having a uterine fibroid in which case i</p>
<p>should probably do a video on that as</p>
<p>well so</p>
<p>boy i am so grateful for my simple</p>
<p>hydraulics i don&rsquo;t have to put up with</p>
<p>all that i tell you what i hats off to</p>
<p>ladies for all that machinery having to</p>
<p>deal with it and now let&rsquo;s deal with the</p>
<p>next question here it is doc</p>
<p>all right true or false</p>
<p>sugar lowers your iq</p>
<p>okay terry&rsquo;s anxious for that answer and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s move on how about to the green</p>
<p>room</p>
<p>and this time we&rsquo;re going to go to</p>
<p>gerardo</p>
<p>from san francisco and gerardo we</p>
<p>appreciate oh hang on just a second doc</p>
<p>let me fix something here</p>
<p>your head&rsquo;s half cut off in that shot</p>
<p>and here we go girardi you&rsquo;re on with dr</p>
<p>byrd</p>
<p>hello dr berg my name is gerardo</p>
<p>from san francisco california</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m 63 years old</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been doing your intermittent</p>
<p>fasting for over 10 weeks now and doing</p>
<p>mostly omad</p>
<p>following the same program you laid out</p>
<p>in your dietary supplements</p>
<p>dietary and supplements taking uh abcd</p>
<p>zinc cod liver oil lemon water</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>exercise you know daily sunlight i lost</p>
<p>15 pounds already after six weeks</p>
<p>and have lots of energy and no more naps</p>
<p>after meals but my sleep is inconsistent</p>
<p>where i wake up two or three times</p>
<p>just like the other person</p>
<p>i have a broken thermostat</p>
<p>i sleep with the eye mask and i did some</p>
<p>tweaks so i</p>
<p>cut down the number of i only wake up</p>
<p>once</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still inconsistent</p>
<p>and yesterday your uh sleep aid and your</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>electrolyte arrived so i took those and</p>
<p>so sleep is uh still uh</p>
<p>i woke up once lots of dreams</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>yeah i</p>
<p>is it my cortisol that uh is my problem</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>uh yeah any suggestions</p>
<p>yes you have a this is a really really</p>
<p>good question because</p>
<p>um you have</p>
<p>a clock</p>
<p>uh not only in your in your brain but in</p>
<p>all the cells as well there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>literally a tiny mechanism that is</p>
<p>controlling the whole circadian rhythm</p>
<p>of your sleep and what the biggest</p>
<p>stimulus of that</p>
<p>is light</p>
<p>and darkness</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>unfortunately the big problem that we</p>
<p>have nowadays is we have an abundance of</p>
<p>light even in the dark we have also a</p>
<p>lot of artificial light so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple things that you can do in</p>
<p>addition to what you&rsquo;re doing that i</p>
<p>think will help you number one</p>
<p>is in the morning if you could go</p>
<p>outside</p>
<p>and watch the sun rise that would be a</p>
<p>very therapeutic thing because that will</p>
<p>at the right time give your retina</p>
<p>what it needs to start to reset the</p>
<p>other thing if you could do this okay</p>
<p>is to watch the sun set</p>
<p>at night because that will tell the it</p>
<p>tells the brain</p>
<p>okay reset the clock those are the two</p>
<p>reset things let&rsquo;s say you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>well then you can get what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>bright light therapy and you can buy a</p>
<p>little lamp and you can expose like</p>
<p>about 30 minutes in the morning to that</p>
<p>bright light maybe that would be good in</p>
<p>the winter too but those two things</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i think will help you um a lot</p>
<p>especially the one early in the morning</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then as far as</p>
<p>the supplement that i that you took from</p>
<p>my this is the sleep aid</p>
<p>i would take</p>
<p>three of those before about 20 minutes</p>
<p>before you go to bed</p>
<p>um not just one</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re having any problem that</p>
<p>usually</p>
<p>will also assist but don&rsquo;t try to don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do everything at once try one thing at a</p>
<p>time so you really can isolate</p>
<p>what is going on um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what i would do</p>
<p>all right sounds like great counsel</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>we have another question answered by the</p>
<p>astute audience true false sugar lowers</p>
<p>your iq and 95</p>
<p>of your uh admirers say it&rsquo;s true and</p>
<p>five percent say it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>you know i just i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i i mainly asked it just to see if</p>
<p>there was that five percent i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>curious about that five percent i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>curious about uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s people out there that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that sugar can lower iq it</p>
<p>actually will</p>
<p>it literally makes your brain</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>not connected to their i mean</p>
<p>disconnects the neurons i mean if you</p>
<p>think about even a diabetic um their iq</p>
<p>goes down</p>
<p>uh by a certain by certain amount of</p>
<p>points</p>
<p>so yeah sugar does destroy the brain</p>
<p>and it does lower</p>
<p>your ability to problem solve</p>
<p>to be creative</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>use the mental processes that you need</p>
<p>to figure things out so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to release a video on the</p>
<p>topic if i haven&rsquo;t already i think i</p>
<p>in fact i don&rsquo;t think i</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if i did release that video</p>
<p>yes i did release the video</p>
<p>i did i just remember um</p>
<p>i think uh</p>
<p>i think that would be a really good</p>
<p>video for you to watch on the cognitive</p>
<p>function</p>
<p>of how to increase it and then what to</p>
<p>do to avoid</p>
<p>that goes beyond just sugar too there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other things you should avoid that</p>
<p>inhibit your cognitive function i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about your ability to put your</p>
<p>attention on something and keep it there</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re constantly filtering out</p>
<p>extra data that you don&rsquo;t need and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the problem is the</p>
<p>the filter mechanisms because when you</p>
<p>actually study something it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like you have your cell phone you have</p>
<p>this you have that</p>
<p>how well can you resist that</p>
<p>additional information</p>
<p>when you have sugar</p>
<p>you lose those inhibitory filters</p>
<p>so now everything kind of goes in and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of distracted easily you you</p>
<p>have this deficit of attention</p>
<p>someday they&rsquo;ll even probably come up</p>
<p>with some label</p>
<p>for some disease on that but uh yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>deficit of attention</p>
<p>what&rsquo;d you say no i&rsquo;m just kidding so uh</p>
<p>boy our viewership is really growing on</p>
<p>youtube and facebook for so thanks</p>
<p>everybody for joining dr berg obviously</p>
<p>his council is welcome and popular and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just great to see that</p>
<p>uh you know continuing on the rise</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see jessica from facebook can you</p>
<p>share some tips on how to address weight</p>
<p>gain while in or during menopause</p>
<p>okay so how to maintain weight gain or</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m guessing she wants to maintain her</p>
<p>weight she doesn&rsquo;t want to lose weight</p>
<p>is that right or she wants to lose</p>
<p>weight let&rsquo;s see let me go back to that</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>oh gain weight i think she would rather</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s see how to address weight gain</p>
<p>i think she wants to lose it okay</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>yeah with menopause</p>
<p>we have a shift we have a shift of</p>
<p>hormones we have</p>
<p>a sudden shift and that&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>shock to the system this sudden shift of</p>
<p>the decrease of estrogen but but more</p>
<p>more decrease in progesterone and so now</p>
<p>your body recruits help from the backup</p>
<p>organ which is the adrenals and then the</p>
<p>adrenals</p>
<p>tend to create the cortisol and the</p>
<p>belly fat and all the other symptoms</p>
<p>that come with it so</p>
<p>we come right back full circle to the</p>
<p>adrenal how do you support a health a</p>
<p>stressed adrenal</p>
<p>i have so many videos on that</p>
<p>if the cortisol is high</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really hard to lose weight so a</p>
<p>couple little tips to lower cortisol</p>
<p>would be to get adequate enough adequate</p>
<p>amount of vitamin d</p>
<p>to do regular exercise to do regular</p>
<p>physical work</p>
<p>also mental stress is probably one of</p>
<p>the biggest</p>
<p>things that is relates to dealing with</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>so you really want to</p>
<p>do what&rsquo;s called a stress detox</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>you know just</p>
<p>kind of don&rsquo;t hang out with anyone that</p>
<p>is stressing you out for a while</p>
<p>and that usually helps</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>i would just identify those individuals</p>
<p>in your life that tend to stress you out</p>
<p>and they usually are bringing you bad</p>
<p>news too so you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>watch the news you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>have too much bad news because it keeps</p>
<p>you from sleeping and it keeps things</p>
<p>stressed and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and that can affect your weight as well</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m flush with excitement because</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s asked me a question cookie</p>
<p>cutter girl from youtube question for</p>
<p>steve can you eat too much nutritional</p>
<p>yeast now don&rsquo;t take my counsel but i</p>
<p>followed dr burke&rsquo;s recommended daily</p>
<p>allowance which is nine of these things</p>
<p>and it works very well for me so you</p>
<p>know as anything i think you can kill</p>
<p>yourself from drinking too much water so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t go crazy but i do trust very</p>
<p>much what dr berg says and i get great</p>
<p>results doc am i on on track here</p>
<p>probably just don&rsquo;t do more than a pound</p>
<p>a day</p>
<p>steve</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t do a pound okay um but i</p>
<p>think nutritional yeast um</p>
<p>it has an interesting flavor so either</p>
<p>you like it or you don&rsquo;t like it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a good source of b vitamins</p>
<p>especially if you get it from</p>
<p>the um without the fortification</p>
<p>or the synthetic additions of the b</p>
<p>vitamins um yes they might work</p>
<p>initially but as a maintenance you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to take anything synthetic um</p>
<p>because i did a video on that i mean the</p>
<p>synthetic vitamins um</p>
<p>basically</p>
<p>mainly from china they&rsquo;re from chemical</p>
<p>companies they may come from the</p>
<p>petroleum so why would you want to put</p>
<p>that in your body but the nutritional</p>
<p>yeast even though the b vitamins</p>
<p>might be lower than</p>
<p>some fortified version of nutritional</p>
<p>yeast there&rsquo;s they still are more</p>
<p>bioavailable and they&rsquo;ll still work</p>
<p>really nice and they um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more of a natural source you</p>
<p>know these microbes</p>
<p>man they just i&rsquo;m so interested in</p>
<p>how these these microbes uh help us</p>
<p>in fact we are totally dependent on</p>
<p>these microbes</p>
<p>for um all sorts of things in our body</p>
<p>for immune protection</p>
<p>digestion</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>making different vitamins</p>
<p>making different chemicals the same</p>
<p>thing with a plant the plant is</p>
<p>dependent on the microbes you can&rsquo;t grow</p>
<p>a healthy plant without microbes the</p>
<p>microbes even</p>
<p>immobilize the minerals in the soil but</p>
<p>they even</p>
<p>invade the roots</p>
<p>and they turn into</p>
<p>this is interesting okay this is i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>getting distracted here but</p>
<p>you can have a pathogen that invades the</p>
<p>root and becomes a friendly microbe and</p>
<p>develops a symbiotic relationship with</p>
<p>that plant it goes right up into the</p>
<p>root up and even to the stem and leaves</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>new</p>
<p>research on how microbes even go are</p>
<p>inside</p>
<p>these plants i mean it makes sense</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re inside our bodies</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>they were</p>
<p>on the planet before the human bodies</p>
<p>and so you have a</p>
<p>um a lot of interesting things with</p>
<p>these bacterial and other microbial life</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>you know i can study for hours</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting okay cookie so uh</p>
<p>uses dr berg uh uh requires on his label</p>
<p>for best results i&rsquo;ve certainly found</p>
<p>that to be true okay patsy from facebook</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been on keto and omad for over a</p>
<p>month but have developed vertigo and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just feeling very lethargic what are</p>
<p>your thoughts dr bird</p>
<p>you know what i think you need more sea</p>
<p>salt</p>
<p>sea salt</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s going to be the answer</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s going to be the simple</p>
<p>answer</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i would also there&rsquo;s the other thing</p>
<p>that if you take sea salt and it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work then you&rsquo;d want to take a ben photo</p>
<p>which is a fat soluble b1 which i</p>
<p>i doubt if you&rsquo;ll really need to do that</p>
<p>after the sea salt but i would start</p>
<p>with the sea salt as a plan plan a</p>
<p>wonderful doc how about another question</p>
<p>and you feared that you might have</p>
<p>touched on this already and there it is</p>
<p>all right what is the primary effect</p>
<p>of milk thistle</p>
<p>climb audit audience why don&rsquo;t we go</p>
<p>back to the green room</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see how about um</p>
<p>we went to her tracy we&rsquo;ve been to there</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see who else do we have here um we</p>
<p>have tracy hang on just a second let me</p>
<p>get her on tracy</p>
<p>prepare yourself yeah because you are on</p>
<p>with dr berg with your quick question</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>hi dr berg i&rsquo;ve learned so much from</p>
<p>your videos thank you for all you do</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been doing standard keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting for about a month</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;m eating two meals a day</p>
<p>i have adrenal fatigue with high</p>
<p>cortisol</p>
<p>my blood sugar after 20 hours of fasting</p>
<p>averages about 105 but my ketones are</p>
<p>0.5</p>
<p>should i still be fasting with the</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue</p>
<p>yes yes because on that scale of ketones</p>
<p>we want to get it up to maybe three</p>
<p>or more so there&rsquo;s different levels of</p>
<p>things you can do the fact that your</p>
<p>blood sugars are over 100 tells me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>either you had some really nasty insulin</p>
<p>resistance that&rsquo;s keeping things from</p>
<p>working like they should</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>so i would definitely um do longer fast</p>
<p>and add exercise those are the two</p>
<p>things that will start pushing the</p>
<p>ketone level</p>
<p>higher and higher and higher but uh</p>
<p>um ideally you want to do that until the</p>
<p>blood sugars come down to about 80 or</p>
<p>less</p>
<p>okay thank you</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>all right thank you so much for your</p>
<p>succinct question there let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>um oh wow quiz how about the quiz</p>
<p>answers so the latest uh quiz question</p>
<p>number four asks what is the primary</p>
<p>effect of milk thistle</p>
<p>and the audience is very cocky they 100</p>
<p>of them say milk thistle heals or cleans</p>
<p>the liver</p>
<p>you know i kind of gave away the answer</p>
<p>there but yes they are all correct</p>
<p>specifically liver protection</p>
<p>it protects the liver against poison a</p>
<p>lot of different poisons</p>
<p>poisons from medications</p>
<p>poisons from</p>
<p>snake by a snake bite poisons from</p>
<p>poisonous mushrooms poison from mold</p>
<p>toxins</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s quite interesting because um</p>
<p>you know i can go outside right now and</p>
<p>i see milk thistle all over the place</p>
<p>and uh so i&rsquo;m gonna be collecting the</p>
<p>seeds as soon as soon as the flower</p>
<p>turns white and i&rsquo;ll be i&rsquo;ll be blending</p>
<p>them up and i&rsquo;ll be putting them in a</p>
<p>little container and consuming them on a</p>
<p>regular basis just</p>
<p>because as the more i study milk thistle</p>
<p>the more i&rsquo;m amazed at what it can do</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like serious liver</p>
<p>protection</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>and also um</p>
<p>good for blood sugars and mood and um</p>
<p>so but what it does to the liver because</p>
<p>so many people have</p>
<p>a toxic liver nowadays</p>
<p>you know why not use a</p>
<p>homemade remedy</p>
<p>like that and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so easy to find the milk thistle</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like all over the place you just</p>
<p>have to look up</p>
<p>what it looks like</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s great and i gave</p>
<p>everybody a quick preview of daniel</p>
<p>somehow his picture popped up so why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we just carry that further and</p>
<p>bring him on to the show daniel you are</p>
<p>on with dr berg for your brief question</p>
<p>daniel can you hear us</p>
<p>um i guess daniel has muted out so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to a full picture of you and go</p>
<p>back to social media while we&rsquo;re waiting</p>
<p>for him to get that together vicki from</p>
<p>facebook i am a nurse and your</p>
<p>information is much more helpful and on</p>
<p>the spot than any of my doctors oh wait</p>
<p>a minute here we&rsquo;ve got him just a</p>
<p>moment uh daniel let&rsquo;s bring it back up</p>
<p>there you go you&rsquo;re on with dr</p>
<p>bergdaniel</p>
<p>we have some technical difficulty with</p>
<p>daniel so daniel i&rsquo;m sorry but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have to put you back in the</p>
<p>green room for a while until we figure</p>
<p>out what your audio problem is so anyway</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that interesting dr berg that</p>
<p>vicki a nurse</p>
<p>has found your information more spot-on</p>
<p>than any of the doctors that is uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hopeful</p>
<p>so thank you for uh that acknowledgement</p>
<p>you know i think sometimes yeah so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see let&rsquo;s see if we can get daniel</p>
<p>daniel can you hear me</p>
<p>daniel can you hear us</p>
<p>uh gee</p>
<p>i think we can hear him but he can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hear us that&rsquo;s probably the issue i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure what it is i spoke with him</p>
<p>earlier and he uh cheerfully addressed</p>
<p>us</p>
<p>but uh hang on just a second i uh</p>
<p>just can&rsquo;t get him to go but we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to give up on him</p>
<p>certainly um let&rsquo;s go to okay so he just</p>
<p>said</p>
<p>he he just said yes so why don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>tell me daniel your question</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>so maybe you can&rsquo;t hear me yeah for some</p>
<p>reason interesting well i&rsquo;m that</p>
<p>saddens both of us</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll uh keep that in mind i tell</p>
<p>you what why don&rsquo;t we go to our final</p>
<p>question as we wait for</p>
<p>daniel uh to uh come about and here it</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>uh yeah but there&rsquo;s a severe delay so</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you go ahead and ask your</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>oh you can hear me now okay great</p>
<p>go ahead</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your question</p>
<p>what you might want to do is type in</p>
<p>your question because either there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>delay or something i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening but yes uh</p>
<p>oh</p>
<p>great so uh yes i&rsquo;ve uh</p>
<p>yes i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;ve been so here&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>bit of background i&rsquo;ve been doing your</p>
<p>uh keto and intermittent fasting for</p>
<p>about uh three and a half</p>
<p>daniel if you can hear us go on with</p>
<p>your question</p>
<p>so steve why don&rsquo;t you just text him to</p>
<p>ask the question in the chat and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>put him on mu because it kind of comes</p>
<p>in and out so</p>
<p>sorry about the delay i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>and and so um i&rsquo;ve lost about 25 pounds</p>
<p>wait the suspense is killing us</p>
<p>yes steve why don&rsquo;t you just put him on</p>
<p>pause and tell him to type in the um</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll go to what about do we let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see did we uh</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;ve got that yeah gone to</p>
<p>everyone now i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see did we get to uh tracy</p>
<p>yeah tracy you there</p>
<p>oh no we did i&rsquo;m here i heard you yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s my question oh good</p>
<p>thank you tracy yeah we&rsquo;re all sort of</p>
<p>caught up here so uh we talked about</p>
<p>rain rain reyna spray did we do rayna we</p>
<p>did</p>
<p>okay we did from texas and she it was</p>
<p>very entertaining</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s see how about um the last</p>
<p>question for the day here it is</p>
<p>yeah all right so let&rsquo;s see uh true or</p>
<p>false the lack of diversity of your</p>
<p>microbiome can contribute to depression</p>
<p>is that true or false</p>
<p>okay and then meanwhile poor daniel</p>
<p>dropped off completely so</p>
<p>we hope daniel when you&rsquo;re watching this</p>
<p>on youtube or facebook please write us</p>
<p>back and type in uh your question and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get oh he just popped back up and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll write him back so audience</p>
<p>climb on that uh question</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s go back to the very</p>
<p>patient folks</p>
<p>on um</p>
<p>social media okay charles from facebook</p>
<p>what are your thoughts about alkaline</p>
<p>water and ionized water</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t um</p>
<p>i really don&rsquo;t have an opinion of</p>
<p>ionized water but alkaline water i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like it unless it&rsquo;s naturally</p>
<p>alkaline from spring water</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what it normally is but when</p>
<p>you start to alkalize water</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>i i just um i actually did the urine</p>
<p>test on</p>
<p>on quite a few people and when they did</p>
<p>the alkaline water their urine ph was a</p>
<p>nine</p>
<p>now normally it should be like five and</p>
<p>a half to six and a half</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when you have nine that&rsquo;s like just off</p>
<p>the charts so i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too high we need that uh ph</p>
<p>in the urine to be a certain level</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>when you start alkalizing the entire</p>
<p>body</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s not the best way to do it</p>
<p>you want to just</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>find out why your body&rsquo;s too acid in the</p>
<p>first place and correct that reason</p>
<p>instead of just alkalizing the whole</p>
<p>body because every part of the body is a</p>
<p>different ph and when you alkalize the</p>
<p>entire body you kind of throw off</p>
<p>everything</p>
<p>so um if you just but if you eat just</p>
<p>eat healthy your body will go back to</p>
<p>the ph it needs to be in</p>
<p>very good ado from facebook what foods</p>
<p>are best for someone with scleroderma</p>
<p>and can it be</p>
<p>cured well you&rsquo;d want foods that are</p>
<p>good um</p>
<p>as an anti-inflammatory so of course</p>
<p>the obvious is to avoid the omega-6 oils</p>
<p>the sugars</p>
<p>the wheat the grains and things like</p>
<p>that but vitamin d is one of the best</p>
<p>remedies for inflammatory skin problems</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>and i do want to say i do have a this is</p>
<p>and this is a little plug for a new my</p>
<p>new liquid vitamin d k2 product it has</p>
<p>zinc</p>
<p>and mct oil</p>
<p>because you know some people don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>capsules and they um also kids have a</p>
<p>hard time with capsules that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>new product to take and</p>
<p>it tastes good too it&rsquo;s like a lemon</p>
<p>mint so i just wanted to</p>
<p>do a plug on my own product but for skin</p>
<p>problems you need vitamin d vitamin d is</p>
<p>uh the best</p>
<p>for inflammatory skin issues</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>you can get it from the sun</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t really have to take a</p>
<p>vitamin e supplement but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in fact kids that um have like uh</p>
<p>scleroderma where they have a psoriasis</p>
<p>or even eczema</p>
<p>throughout the sun it seems to clear up</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>interesting coincidence</p>
<p>interesting well i&rsquo;ll tell you what this</p>
<p>must be</p>
<p>a national dr berg</p>
<p>nurse appreciation day because here we</p>
<p>have another one i&rsquo;m a christina i think</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a nurse in a hospital i&rsquo;m also a</p>
<p>home care nurse and i recommend your</p>
<p>videos to all my patients in regard to</p>
<p>whatever ailments they might have and</p>
<p>she claims as the other one did you are</p>
<p>the best so thanks folks for uh</p>
<p>reporting especially from this no i i</p>
<p>just want to say i really appreciate</p>
<p>that because i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s quite a few doctors that</p>
<p>are watching and</p>
<p>recommending the videos i mean like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just giving helpful tips that anyone</p>
<p>could use especially in the medical</p>
<p>profession</p>
<p>um i mean these things have been tested</p>
<p>we have a well over 5000 success stories</p>
<p>on the website so might as well share</p>
<p>this information</p>
<p>and use it because i don&rsquo;t think anyone</p>
<p>should keep uh</p>
<p>keep their uh information hidden or</p>
<p>secret or mysterious if you have</p>
<p>something that works tell other people</p>
<p>and um that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about yeah i</p>
<p>have a good doctor a good plastic</p>
<p>surgeon buddy and he says many doctors</p>
<p>because of their specialty get tunnel</p>
<p>vision and they just know a lot about</p>
<p>one thing and just you know maybe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re too busy or distracted but they</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t see outside of that tube and</p>
<p>he says it&rsquo;s really excellent to do some</p>
<p>research on the side</p>
<p>so uh anyway i think you&rsquo;re great</p>
<p>and in his case he said so dr berg is is</p>
<p>terrific you know learn a lot from him</p>
<p>if need a face left i can help but</p>
<p>otherwise you know my my knowledge of</p>
<p>medicine is is in a very sort of narrow</p>
<p>channel</p>
<p>yeah and it&rsquo;s also it takes time to dive</p>
<p>in and try to sort things out</p>
<p>unfortunately i have a very strange</p>
<p>strange</p>
<p>interest in</p>
<p>studying</p>
<p>health information</p>
<p>all day</p>
<p>and then trying to understand it and try</p>
<p>to package it in a way that people can</p>
<p>understand so not a lot of people</p>
<p>read</p>
<p>textbooks as a hobby</p>
<p>or for fun</p>
<p>for some reason i just i enjoy that so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>pluses and minuses of my enjoyment</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all the great benefactors of your</p>
<p>energy in that regard okay last question</p>
<p>uh true falser</p>
<p>the lack of diversity in your microbiome</p>
<p>can contribute to depression</p>
<p>and uh 95</p>
<p>of our audience say it&rsquo;s true and five</p>
<p>percent say no way</p>
<p>you know this this i&rsquo;m just curious</p>
<p>about that five percent i just thought</p>
<p>it was common knowledge but</p>
<p>you have this gut brain axis this</p>
<p>connection through the vagus nerve i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>telling you your mood is</p>
<p>hugely</p>
<p>affected by what&rsquo;s happening in your gut</p>
<p>especially after you do an antibiotic i</p>
<p>mean you could literally go into</p>
<p>some anxiety depression so you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh i mean think about what the microbes</p>
<p>are doing they make neurotransmitters</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and they influence a lot of um chemistry</p>
<p>in our body so um</p>
<p>yeah if your gut is really good</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s working and you have</p>
<p>the diversity because your diet&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>and boy you&rsquo;re uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to feel better you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to feel better um in your head so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely a huge connection</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s way bigger than what people</p>
<p>think in fact even um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>research within</p>
<p>especially like on</p>
<p>animal studies okay it&rsquo;s just like in my</p>
<p>studies they put mice</p>
<p>on a um they destroyed their microbes</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>and they experience</p>
<p>symptoms almost identical to autism</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>autistic symptoms</p>
<p>which is a whole different thing but</p>
<p>still it&rsquo;s an interesting connection</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s connected to the microbiome</p>
<p>so if my child had autism you better</p>
<p>believe it i would be fortifying them</p>
<p>with um</p>
<p>probiotics fermented</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>vegetables getting rid of the sugar</p>
<p>i would be all over that well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wonderful dr burke guess what we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>it again we got through all our</p>
<p>questions and uh it&rsquo;s about that time</p>
<p>listen just i want to thank you guys</p>
<p>again you guys have great questions i</p>
<p>appreciate all the comments uh on</p>
<p>my channel i read a lot of them and stay</p>
<p>tuned for some additional really</p>
<p>interesting videos coming up this next</p>
<p>week have a good weekend</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you</p>
