    <p>The following is a conversation with Vijay Kumar.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the top roboticists in the world,</p>
<p>a professor at the University of Pennsylvania,</p>
<p>a dean of pen engineering, former director of Grasp Lab,</p>
<p>or the General Robotics Automation Sensing</p>
<p>and Perception Laboratory at Penn,</p>
<p>that was established back in 1979, that&rsquo;s 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Vijay is perhaps best known for his work</p>
<p>in multi robot systems, robot swarms,</p>
<p>and micro aerial vehicles,</p>
<p>robots that elegantly cooperate in flight</p>
<p>under all the uncertainty and challenges</p>
<p>that the real world conditions present.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Vijay Kumar.</p>
<p>What is the first robot you&rsquo;ve ever built</p>
<p>or were a part of building?</p>
<p>Way back when I was in graduate school,</p>
<p>I was part of a fairly big project</p>
<p>that involved building a very large hexapod.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weighed close to 7,000 pounds,</p>
<p>and it was powered by hydraulic actuation,</p>
<p>or it was actuated by hydraulics with 18 motors,</p>
<p>hydraulic motors, each controlled by an Intel 8085 processor</p>
<p>and an 8086 co processor.</p>
<p>And so imagine this huge monster that had 18 joints,</p>
<p>each controlled by an independent computer,</p>
<p>and there was a 19th computer that actually did</p>
<p>the coordination between these 18 joints.</p>
<p>So I was part of this project,</p>
<p>and my thesis work was how do you coordinate the 18 legs?</p>
<p>And in particular, the pressures in the hydraulic cylinders</p>
<p>to get efficient locomotion.</p>
<p>It sounds like a giant mess.</p>
<p>So how difficult is it to make all the motors communicate?</p>
<p>Presumably, you have to send signals hundreds of times</p>
<p>a second, or at least.</p>
<p>So this was not my work,</p>
<p>but the folks who worked on this wrote what I believe</p>
<p>to be the first multiprocessor operating system.</p>
<p>This was in the 80s, and you had to make sure</p>
<p>that obviously messages got across</p>
<p>from one joint to another.</p>
<p>You have to remember the clock speeds on those computers</p>
<p>were about half a megahertz.</p>
<p>Right, the 80s.</p>
<p>So not to romanticize the notion,</p>
<p>but how did it make you feel to see that robot move?</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it looks like, well, we built this thing</p>
<p>which really should have been much smaller.</p>
<p>And of course, today&rsquo;s robots are much smaller.</p>
<p>You look at Boston Dynamics or Ghost Robotics,</p>
<p>a spinoff from Penn.</p>
<p>But back then, you were stuck with the substrate you had,</p>
<p>the compute you had, so things were unnecessarily big.</p>
<p>But at the same time, and this is just human psychology,</p>
<p>somehow bigger means grander.</p>
<p>People never had the same appreciation</p>
<p>for nanotechnology or nanodevices</p>
<p>as they do for the Space Shuttle or the Boeing 747.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve actually done quite a good job</p>
<p>at illustrating that small is beautiful</p>
<p>in terms of robotics.</p>
<p>So what is on that topic is the most beautiful</p>
<p>or elegant robot in motion that you&rsquo;ve ever seen?</p>
<p>Not to pick favorites or whatever,</p>
<p>but something that just inspires you that you remember.</p>
<p>Well, I think the thing that I&rsquo;m most proud of</p>
<p>that my students have done is really think about</p>
<p>small UAVs that can maneuver in constrained spaces</p>
<p>and in particular, their ability to coordinate</p>
<p>with each other and form three dimensional patterns.</p>
<p>So once you can do that,</p>
<p>you can essentially create 3D objects in the sky</p>
<p>and you can deform these objects on the fly.</p>
<p>So in some sense, your toolbox of what you can create</p>
<p>has suddenly got enhanced.</p>
<p>And before that, we did the two dimensional version of this.</p>
<p>So we had ground robots forming patterns and so on.</p>
<p>So that was not as impressive, that was not as beautiful.</p>
<p>But if you do it in 3D,</p>
<p>suspended in midair, and you&rsquo;ve got to go back to 2011</p>
<p>when we did this, now it&rsquo;s actually pretty standard</p>
<p>to do these things eight years later.</p>
<p>But back then it was a big accomplishment.</p>
<p>So the distributed cooperation</p>
<p>is where beauty emerges in your eyes?</p>
<p>Well, I think beauty to an engineer is very different</p>
<p>from beauty to someone who&rsquo;s looking at robots</p>
<p>from the outside, if you will.</p>
<p>But what I meant there, so before we said that grand,</p>
<p>so before we said that grand is associated with size.</p>
<p>And another way of thinking about this</p>
<p>is just the physical shape</p>
<p>and the idea that you can get physical shapes in midair</p>
<p>and have them deform, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>But the individual components,</p>
<p>the agility is beautiful too, right?</p>
<p>That is true too.</p>
<p>So then how quickly can you actually manipulate</p>
<p>these three dimensional shapes</p>
<p>and the individual components?</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But by the way, you said UAV, unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good term for drones, UAVs, quad copters?</p>
<p>Is there a term that&rsquo;s being standardized?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there is.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to use the word drones.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve often said this, drones to me is a pejorative word.</p>
<p>It signifies something that&rsquo;s dumb,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pre programmed, that does one little thing</p>
<p>and robots are anything but drones.</p>
<p>So I actually don&rsquo;t like that word,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what everybody uses.</p>
<p>You could call it unpiloted.</p>
<p>Unpiloted.</p>
<p>But even unpiloted could be radio controlled,</p>
<p>could be remotely controlled in many different ways.</p>
<p>And I think the right word is,</p>
<p>thinking about it as an aerial robot.</p>
<p>You also say agile, autonomous, aerial robot, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so agility is an attribute, but they don&rsquo;t have to be.</p>
<p>So what biological system,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve also drawn a lot of inspiration with those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen bees and ants that you&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>What living creatures have you found to be most inspiring</p>
<p>as an engineer, instructive in your work in robotics?</p>
<p>To me, so ants are really quite incredible creatures, right?</p>
<p>So you, I mean, the individuals arguably are very simple</p>
<p>in how they&rsquo;re built and yet they&rsquo;re incredibly resilient</p>
<p>as a population.</p>
<p>And as individuals, they&rsquo;re incredibly robust.</p>
<p>So, if you take an ant, it&rsquo;s six legs,</p>
<p>you remove one leg, it still works just fine.</p>
<p>And it moves along.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that he even realizes it&rsquo;s lost a leg.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the robustness at the individual ant level.</p>
<p>But then you look about this instinct</p>
<p>for self preservation of the colonies</p>
<p>and they adapt in so many amazing ways.</p>
<p>You know, transcending gaps by just chaining themselves</p>
<p>together when you have a flood,</p>
<p>being able to recruit other teammates</p>
<p>to carry big morsels of food,</p>
<p>and then going out in different directions looking for food,</p>
<p>and then being able to demonstrate consensus,</p>
<p>even though they don&rsquo;t communicate directly with each other</p>
<p>the way we communicate with each other.</p>
<p>In some sense, they also know how to do democracy,</p>
<p>probably better than what we do.</p>
<p>Yeah, somehow it&rsquo;s even democracy is emergent.</p>
<p>It seems like all of the phenomena that we see</p>
<p>is all emergent.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s no centralized communicator.</p>
<p>There is, so I think a lot is made about that word,</p>
<p>emergent, and it means lots of things to different people.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I think as an engineer, you think about</p>
<p>what element, elemental behaviors</p>
<p>were primitives you could synthesize</p>
<p>so that the whole looks incredibly powerful,</p>
<p>incredibly synergistic,</p>
<p>the whole definitely being greater than some of the parts,</p>
<p>and ants are living proof of that.</p>
<p>So when you see these beautiful swarms</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s biological systems of robots,</p>
<p>do you sometimes think of them</p>
<p>as a single individual living intelligent organism?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same as thinking of our human beings</p>
<p>are human civilization as one organism,</p>
<p>or do you still, as an engineer,</p>
<p>think about the individual components</p>
<p>and all the engineering</p>
<p>that went into the individual components?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>So again, philosophically as engineers,</p>
<p>what we wanna do is to go beyond</p>
<p>the individual components, the individual units,</p>
<p>and think about it as a unit, as a cohesive unit,</p>
<p>without worrying about the individual components.</p>
<p>If you start obsessing about</p>
<p>the individual building blocks and what they do,</p>
<p>you inevitably will find it hard to scale up.</p>
<p>Just mathematically,</p>
<p>just think about individual things you wanna model,</p>
<p>and if you want to have 10 of those,</p>
<p>then you essentially are taking Cartesian products</p>
<p>of 10 things, and that makes it really complicated.</p>
<p>Then to do any kind of synthesis or design</p>
<p>in that high dimension space is really hard.</p>
<p>So the right way to do this</p>
<p>is to think about the individuals in a clever way</p>
<p>so that at the higher level,</p>
<p>when you look at lots and lots of them,</p>
<p>abstractly, you can think of them</p>
<p>in some low dimensional space.</p>
<p>So what does that involve?</p>
<p>For the individual, do you have to try to make</p>
<p>the way they see the world as local as possible?</p>
<p>And the other thing,</p>
<p>do you just have to make them robust to collisions?</p>
<p>Like you said with the ants,</p>
<p>if something fails, the whole swarm doesn&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>Right, I think as engineers, we do this.</p>
<p>I mean, you think about, we build planes,</p>
<p>or we build iPhones,</p>
<p>and we know that by taking individual components,</p>
<p>well engineered components with well specified interfaces</p>
<p>that behave in a predictable way,</p>
<p>you can build complex systems.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s ingrained, I would claim,</p>
<p>in most engineers thinking,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s true for computer scientists as well.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s different here is that you want</p>
<p>the individuals to be robust in some sense,</p>
<p>as we do in these other settings,</p>
<p>but you also want some degree of resiliency</p>
<p>for the population.</p>
<p>And so you really want them to be able to reestablish</p>
<p>communication with their neighbors.</p>
<p>You want them to rethink their strategy for group behavior.</p>
<p>You want them to reorganize.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I think a lot of the challenges lie.</p>
<p>So just at a high level,</p>
<p>what does it take for a bunch of,</p>
<p>what should we call them, flying robots,</p>
<p>to create a formation?</p>
<p>Just for people who are not familiar</p>
<p>with robotics in general, how much information is needed?</p>
<p>How do you even make it happen</p>
<p>without a centralized controller?</p>
<p>So, I mean, there are a couple of different ways</p>
<p>of looking at this.</p>
<p>If you are a purist,</p>
<p>you think of it as a way of recreating what nature does.</p>
<p>So nature forms groups for several reasons,</p>
<p>but mostly it&rsquo;s because of this instinct</p>
<p>that organisms have of preserving their colonies,</p>
<p>their population, which means what?</p>
<p>You need shelter, you need food, you need to procreate,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s basically it.</p>
<p>So the kinds of interactions you see are all organic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all local.</p>
<p>And the only information that they share,</p>
<p>and mostly it&rsquo;s indirectly, is to, again,</p>
<p>preserve the herd or the flock,</p>
<p>or the swarm, and either by looking for new sources of food</p>
<p>or looking for new shelters, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>As engineers, when we build swarms, we have a mission.</p>
<p>And when you think of a mission, and it involves mobility,</p>
<p>most often it&rsquo;s described in some kind</p>
<p>of a global coordinate system.</p>
<p>As a human, as an operator, as a commander,</p>
<p>or as a collaborator, I have my coordinate system,</p>
<p>and I want the robots to be consistent with that.</p>
<p>So I might think of it slightly differently.</p>
<p>I might want the robots to recognize that coordinate system,</p>
<p>which means not only do they have to think locally</p>
<p>in terms of who their immediate neighbors are,</p>
<p>but they have to be cognizant</p>
<p>of what the global environment is.</p>
<p>They have to be cognizant of what the global environment</p>
<p>looks like.</p>
<p>So if I say, surround this building</p>
<p>and protect this from intruders,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re immediately in a building centered</p>
<p>coordinate system, and I have to tell them</p>
<p>where the building is.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re globally collaborating</p>
<p>on the map of that building.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re maintaining some kind of global,</p>
<p>not just in the frame of the building,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s information that&rsquo;s ultimately being built up</p>
<p>explicitly as opposed to kind of implicitly,</p>
<p>like nature might.</p>
<p>Correct, correct.</p>
<p>So in some sense, nature is very, very sophisticated,</p>
<p>but the tasks that nature solves or needs to solve</p>
<p>are very different from the kind of engineered tasks,</p>
<p>artificial tasks that we are forced to address.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s nothing preventing us</p>
<p>from solving these other problems,</p>
<p>but ultimately it&rsquo;s about impact.</p>
<p>You want these swarms to do something useful.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re kind of driven into this very unnatural,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>Unnatural, meaning not like how nature does, setting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably a little bit more expensive</p>
<p>to do it the way nature does,</p>
<p>because nature is less sensitive</p>
<p>to the loss of the individual.</p>
<p>And cost wise in robotics,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re more sensitive to losing individuals.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true, although if you look at the price</p>
<p>to performance ratio of robotic components,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming down dramatically, right?</p>
<p>It continues to come down.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re asymptotically approaching the point</p>
<p>where we would get, yeah,</p>
<p>the cost of individuals would really become insignificant.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s step back at a high level view,</p>
<p>the impossible question of what kind of, as an overview,</p>
<p>what kind of autonomous flying vehicles</p>
<p>are there in general?</p>
<p>I think the ones that receive a lot of notoriety</p>
<p>are obviously the military vehicles.</p>
<p>Military vehicles are controlled by a base station,</p>
<p>but have a lot of human supervision.</p>
<p>But they have limited autonomy,</p>
<p>which is the ability to go from point A to point B.</p>
<p>And even the more sophisticated now,</p>
<p>sophisticated vehicles can do autonomous takeoff</p>
<p>and landing.</p>
<p>And those usually have wings and they&rsquo;re heavy.</p>
<p>Usually they&rsquo;re wings,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s nothing preventing us from doing this</p>
<p>for helicopters as well.</p>
<p>There are many military organizations</p>
<p>that have autonomous helicopters in the same vein.</p>
<p>And by the way, you look at autopilots and airplanes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually very similar.</p>
<p>In fact, one interesting question we can ask is,</p>
<p>if you look at all the air safety violations,</p>
<p>all the crashes that occurred,</p>
<p>would they have happened if the plane were truly autonomous?</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;ll find that in many of the cases,</p>
<p>because of pilot error, we made silly decisions.</p>
<p>And so in some sense, even in air traffic,</p>
<p>commercial air traffic, there&rsquo;s a lot of applications,</p>
<p>although we only see autonomy being enabled</p>
<p>at very high altitudes when the plane is an autopilot.</p>
<p>The plane is an autopilot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a role for the human</p>
<p>and that kind of autonomy is, you&rsquo;re kind of implying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right word is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little dumber than it could be.</p>
<p>Right, so in the lab, of course,</p>
<p>we can afford to be a lot more aggressive.</p>
<p>And the question we try to ask is,</p>
<p>can we make robots that will be able to make decisions</p>
<p>without any kind of external infrastructure?</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>So the most common piece of infrastructure</p>
<p>that airplanes use today is GPS.</p>
<p>GPS is also the most brittle form of information.</p>
<p>If you have driven in a city, try to use GPS navigation,</p>
<p>in tall buildings, you immediately lose GPS.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s not a very sophisticated way</p>
<p>of building autonomy.</p>
<p>I think the second piece of infrastructure</p>
<p>they rely on is communications.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s very easy to jam communications.</p>
<p>In fact, if you use wifi, you know that wifi signals</p>
<p>drop out, cell signals drop out.</p>
<p>So to rely on something like that is not good.</p>
<p>The third form of infrastructure we use,</p>
<p>and I hate to call it infrastructure,</p>
<p>but it is that, in the sense of robots, is people.</p>
<p>So you could rely on somebody to pilot you.</p>
<p>And so the question you wanna ask is,</p>
<p>if there are no pilots, there&rsquo;s no communications</p>
<p>with any base station, if there&rsquo;s no knowledge of position,</p>
<p>and if there&rsquo;s no a priori map,</p>
<p>a priori knowledge of what the environment looks like,</p>
<p>a priori model of what might happen in the future,</p>
<p>can robots navigate?</p>
<p>So that is true autonomy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s true autonomy, and we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>you mentioned like military application of drones.</p>
<p>Okay, so what else is there?</p>
<p>You talk about agile, autonomous flying robots,</p>
<p>aerial robots, so that&rsquo;s a different kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not winged, it&rsquo;s not big, at least it&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>So I use the word agility mostly,</p>
<p>or at least we&rsquo;re motivated to do agile robots,</p>
<p>mostly because robots can operate</p>
<p>and should be operating in constrained environments.</p>
<p>And if you want to operate the way a global hawk operates,</p>
<p>I mean, the kinds of conditions in which you operate</p>
<p>are very, very restrictive.</p>
<p>If you wanna go inside a building,</p>
<p>for example, for search and rescue,</p>
<p>or to locate an active shooter,</p>
<p>or you wanna navigate under the canopy in an orchard</p>
<p>to look at health of plants,</p>
<p>or to look for, to count fruits,</p>
<p>to measure the tree trunks.</p>
<p>These are things we do, by the way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some cool agriculture stuff you&rsquo;ve shown</p>
<p>in the past, it&rsquo;s really awesome.</p>
<p>So in those kinds of settings, you do need that agility.</p>
<p>Agility does not necessarily mean</p>
<p>you break records for the 100 meters dash.</p>
<p>What it really means is you see the unexpected</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to maneuver in a safe way,</p>
<p>and in a way that gets you the most information</p>
<p>about the thing you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>By the way, you may be the only person</p>
<p>who, in a TED Talk, has used a math equation,</p>
<p>which is amazing, people should go see one of your TED Talks.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s very interesting,</p>
<p>because the TED curator, Chris Anderson,</p>
<p>told me, you can&rsquo;t show math.</p>
<p>And I thought about it, but that&rsquo;s who I am.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s our work.</p>
<p>And so I felt compelled to give the audience a taste</p>
<p>for at least some math.</p>
<p>So on that point, simply, what does it take</p>
<p>to make a thing with four motors fly, a quadcopter,</p>
<p>one of these little flying robots?</p>
<p>How hard is it to make it fly?</p>
<p>How do you coordinate the four motors?</p>
<p>How do you convert those motors into actual movement?</p>
<p>So this is an interesting question.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been trying to do this since 2000.</p>
<p>It is a commentary on the sensors</p>
<p>that were available back then,</p>
<p>the computers that were available back then.</p>
<p>And a number of things happened between 2000 and 2007.</p>
<p>One is the advances in computing,</p>
<p>which is, so we all know about Moore&rsquo;s Law,</p>
<p>but I think 2007 was a tipping point,</p>
<p>the year of the iPhone, the year of the cloud.</p>
<p>Lots of things happened in 2007.</p>
<p>But going back even further,</p>
<p>inertial measurement units as a sensor really matured.</p>
<p>Again, lots of reasons for that.</p>
<p>Certainly, there&rsquo;s a lot of federal funding,</p>
<p>particularly DARPA in the US,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t anticipate this boom in IMUs.</p>
<p>But if you look, subsequently what happened</p>
<p>is that every car manufacturer had to put an airbag in,</p>
<p>which meant you had to have an accelerometer on board.</p>
<p>And so that drove down the price to performance ratio.</p>
<p>Wow, I should know this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting, the connection there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why research is very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to predict the outcomes.</p>
<p>And again, the federal government spent a ton of money</p>
<p>on things that they thought were useful for resonators,</p>
<p>but it ended up enabling these small UAVs, which is great,</p>
<p>because I could have never raised that much money</p>
<p>and sold this project,</p>
<p>hey, we want to build these small UAVs.</p>
<p>Can you actually fund the development of low cost IMUs?</p>
<p>So why do you need an IMU on an IMU?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll come back to that.</p>
<p>So in 2007, 2008, we were able to build these.</p>
<p>And then the question you&rsquo;re asking was a good one.</p>
<p>How do you coordinate the motors to develop this?</p>
<p>But over the last 10 years, everything is commoditized.</p>
<p>A high school kid today can pick up</p>
<p>a Raspberry Pi kit and build this.</p>
<p>All the low levels functionality is all automated.</p>
<p>But basically at some level,</p>
<p>you have to drive the motors at the right RPMs,</p>
<p>the right velocity,</p>
<p>in order to generate the right amount of thrust,</p>
<p>in order to position it and orient it in a way</p>
<p>that you need to in order to fly.</p>
<p>The feedback that you get is from onboard sensors,</p>
<p>and the IMU is an important part of it.</p>
<p>The IMU tells you what the acceleration is,</p>
<p>as well as what the angular velocity is.</p>
<p>And those are important pieces of information.</p>
<p>In addition to that, you need some kind of local position</p>
<p>or velocity information.</p>
<p>For example, when we walk,</p>
<p>we implicitly have this information</p>
<p>because we kind of know what our stride length is.</p>
<p>We also are looking at images fly past our retina,</p>
<p>if you will, and so we can estimate velocity.</p>
<p>We also have accelerometers in our head,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re able to integrate all these pieces of information</p>
<p>to determine where we are as we walk.</p>
<p>And so robots have to do something very similar.</p>
<p>You need an IMU, you need some kind of a camera</p>
<p>or other sensor that&rsquo;s measuring velocity,</p>
<p>and then you need some kind of a global reference frame</p>
<p>if you really want to think about doing something</p>
<p>in a world coordinate system.</p>
<p>And so how do you estimate your position</p>
<p>with respect to that global reference frame?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important as well.</p>
<p>So coordinating the RPMs of the four motors</p>
<p>is what allows you to, first of all, fly and hover,</p>
<p>and then you can change the orientation</p>
<p>and the velocity and so on.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a bunch of degrees of freedom</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re complaining about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s six degrees of freedom,</p>
<p>but you only have four inputs, the four motors.</p>
<p>And it turns out to be a remarkably versatile configuration.</p>
<p>You think at first, well, I only have four motors,</p>
<p>how do I go sideways?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not too hard to say, well, if I tilt myself,</p>
<p>I can go sideways, and then you have four motors</p>
<p>pointing up, how do I rotate in place</p>
<p>about a vertical axis?</p>
<p>Well, you rotate them at different speeds</p>
<p>and that generates reaction moments</p>
<p>and that allows you to turn.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually a pretty, it&rsquo;s an optimal configuration</p>
<p>from an engineer standpoint.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple, very cleverly done, and very versatile.</p>
<p>So if you could step back to a time,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve always known flying robots as,</p>
<p>to me, it was natural that a quadcopter should fly.</p>
<p>But when you first started working with it,</p>
<p>how surprised are you that you can make,</p>
<p>do so much with the four motors?</p>
<p>How surprising is it that you can make this thing fly,</p>
<p>first of all, that you can make it hover,</p>
<p>that you can add control to it?</p>
<p>Firstly, this is not, the four motor configuration</p>
<p>is not ours.</p>
<p>You can, it has at least a hundred year history.</p>
<p>And various people, various people try to get quadrotors</p>
<p>to fly without much success.</p>
<p>As I said, we&rsquo;ve been working on this since 2000.</p>
<p>Our first designs were, well, this is way too complicated.</p>
<p>Why not we try to get an omnidirectional flying robot?</p>
<p>So our early designs, we had eight rotors.</p>
<p>And so these eight rotors were arranged uniformly</p>
<p>on a sphere, if you will.</p>
<p>So you can imagine a symmetric configuration.</p>
<p>And so you should be able to fly anywhere.</p>
<p>But the real challenge we had is the strength to weight ratio</p>
<p>is not enough.</p>
<p>And of course, we didn&rsquo;t have the sensors and so on.</p>
<p>So everybody knew, or at least the people</p>
<p>who worked with rotorcrafts knew,</p>
<p>four rotors will get it done.</p>
<p>So that was not our idea.</p>
<p>But it took a while before we could actually do</p>
<p>the onboard sensing and the computation that was needed</p>
<p>for the kinds of agile maneuvering that we wanted to do</p>
<p>in our little aerial robots.</p>
<p>And that only happened between 2007 and 2009 in our lab.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you have to send the signal</p>
<p>maybe a hundred times a second.</p>
<p>So the compute there, everything has to come down in price.</p>
<p>And what are the steps of getting from point A to point B?</p>
<p>So we just talked about like local control.</p>
<p>But if all the kind of cool dancing in the air</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve seen you show, how do you make it happen?</p>
<p>How do you make a trajectory?</p>
<p>First of all, okay, figure out a trajectory.</p>
<p>So plan a trajectory.</p>
<p>And then how do you make that trajectory happen?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think planning is a very fundamental problem</p>
<p>in robotics.</p>
<p>I think 10 years ago it was an esoteric thing,</p>
<p>but today with self driving cars,</p>
<p>everybody can understand this basic idea</p>
<p>that a car sees a whole bunch of things</p>
<p>and it has to keep a lane or maybe make a right turn</p>
<p>or switch lanes.</p>
<p>It has to plan a trajectory.</p>
<p>It has to be safe.</p>
<p>It has to be efficient.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s familiar with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the first step that you have to think about</p>
<p>when you say autonomy.</p>
<p>And so for us, it&rsquo;s about finding smooth motions,</p>
<p>motions that are safe.</p>
<p>So we think about these two things.</p>
<p>One is optimality, one is safety.</p>
<p>Clearly you cannot compromise safety.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking for safe, optimal motions.</p>
<p>The other thing you have to think about is</p>
<p>can you actually compute a reasonable trajectory</p>
<p>in a small amount of time?</p>
<p>Cause you have a time budget.</p>
<p>So the optimal becomes suboptimal,</p>
<p>but in our lab we focus on synthesizing smooth trajectory</p>
<p>that satisfy all the constraints.</p>
<p>In other words, don&rsquo;t violate any safety constraints</p>
<p>and is as efficient as possible.</p>
<p>And when I say efficient,</p>
<p>it could mean I want to get from point A to point B</p>
<p>as quickly as possible,</p>
<p>or I want to get to it as gracefully as possible,</p>
<p>or I want to consume as little energy as possible.</p>
<p>But always staying within the safety constraints.</p>
<p>But yes, always finding a safe trajectory.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement and progress</p>
<p>in the field of machine learning</p>
<p>and reinforcement learning</p>
<p>and the neural network variant of that</p>
<p>with deep reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Do you see a role of machine learning</p>
<p>in, so a lot of the success of flying robots</p>
<p>did not rely on machine learning,</p>
<p>except for maybe a little bit of the perception</p>
<p>on the computer vision side.</p>
<p>On the control side and the planning,</p>
<p>do you see there&rsquo;s a role in the future</p>
<p>for machine learning?</p>
<p>So let me disagree a little bit with you.</p>
<p>I think we never perhaps called out in my work,</p>
<p>called out learning,</p>
<p>but even this very simple idea of being able to fly</p>
<p>through a constrained space.</p>
<p>The first time you try it, you&rsquo;ll invariably,</p>
<p>you might get it wrong if the task is challenging.</p>
<p>And the reason is to get it perfectly right,</p>
<p>you have to model everything in the environment.</p>
<p>And flying is notoriously hard to model.</p>
<p>There are aerodynamic effects that we constantly discover.</p>
<p>Even just before I was talking to you,</p>
<p>I was talking to a student about how blades flap</p>
<p>when they fly.</p>
<p>And that ends up changing how a rotorcraft</p>
<p>is accelerated in the angular direction.</p>
<p>Does he use like micro flaps or something?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not micro flaps.</p>
<p>So we assume that each blade is rigid,</p>
<p>but actually it flaps a little bit.</p>
<p>It bends.</p>
<p>Interesting, yeah.</p>
<p>And so the models rely on the fact,</p>
<p>on the assumption that they&rsquo;re not rigid.</p>
<p>On the assumption that they&rsquo;re actually rigid,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re flying really quickly,</p>
<p>these effects become significant.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re flying close to the ground,</p>
<p>you get pushed off by the ground, right?</p>
<p>Something which every pilot knows when he tries to land</p>
<p>or she tries to land, this is called a ground effect.</p>
<p>Something very few pilots think about</p>
<p>is what happens when you go close to a ceiling</p>
<p>or you get sucked into a ceiling.</p>
<p>There are very few aircrafts</p>
<p>that fly close to any kind of ceiling.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you go close to a wall,</p>
<p>there are these wall effects.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve gone on a train</p>
<p>and you pass another train that&rsquo;s traveling</p>
<p>in the opposite direction, you feel the buffeting.</p>
<p>And so these kinds of microclimates</p>
<p>affect our UAV significantly.</p>
<p>So if you want&hellip;</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re impossible to model, essentially.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re impossible to model,</p>
<p>but the level of sophistication you would need</p>
<p>in the model and the software would be tremendous.</p>
<p>Plus, to get everything right would be awfully tedious.</p>
<p>So the way we do this is over time,</p>
<p>we figure out how to adapt to these conditions.</p>
<p>So early on, we use the form of learning</p>
<p>that we call iterative learning.</p>
<p>So this idea, if you want to perform a task,</p>
<p>there are a few things that you need to change</p>
<p>and iterate over a few parameters</p>
<p>that over time you can figure out.</p>
<p>So I could call it policy gradient reinforcement learning,</p>
<p>but actually it was just iterative learning.</p>
<p>Iterative learning.</p>
<p>And so this was there way back.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s interesting is,</p>
<p>if you look at autonomous vehicles today,</p>
<p>learning occurs, could occur in two pieces.</p>
<p>One is perception, understanding the world.</p>
<p>Second is action, taking actions.</p>
<p>Everything that I&rsquo;ve seen that is successful</p>
<p>is on the perception side of things.</p>
<p>So in computer vision,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made amazing strides in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>So recognizing objects, actually detecting objects,</p>
<p>classifying them and tagging them in some sense,</p>
<p>annotating them.</p>
<p>This is all done through machine learning.</p>
<p>On the action side, on the other hand,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any examples</p>
<p>where there are fielded systems</p>
<p>where we actually learn</p>
<p>the right behavior.</p>
<p>Outside of single demonstration is successful.</p>
<p>In the laboratory, this is the holy grail.</p>
<p>Can you do end to end learning?</p>
<p>Can you go from pixels to motor currents?</p>
<p>This is really, really hard.</p>
<p>And I think if you go forward,</p>
<p>the right way to think about these things</p>
<p>is data driven approaches,</p>
<p>learning based approaches,</p>
<p>in concert with model based approaches,</p>
<p>which is the traditional way of doing things.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a piece,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a role for each of these methodologies.</p>
<p>So what do you think,</p>
<p>just jumping out on topic</p>
<p>since you mentioned autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>what do you think are the limits on the perception side?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked to Elon Musk</p>
<p>and there on the perception side,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using primarily computer vision</p>
<p>to perceive the environment.</p>
<p>In your work with,</p>
<p>because you work with the real world a lot</p>
<p>and the physical world,</p>
<p>what are the limits of computer vision?</p>
<p>Do you think we can solve autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>on the perception side,</p>
<p>focusing on vision alone and machine learning?</p>
<p>So, we also have a spinoff company,</p>
<p>Exxon Technologies that works underground in mines.</p>
<p>So you go into mines, they&rsquo;re dark, they&rsquo;re dirty.</p>
<p>You fly in a dirty area,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s stuff you kick up from by the propellers,</p>
<p>the downwash kicks up dust.</p>
<p>I challenge you to get a computer vision algorithm</p>
<p>to work there.</p>
<p>So we use LIDARs in that setting.</p>
<p>Indoors and even outdoors when we fly through fields,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of potential</p>
<p>for just solving the problem using computer vision alone.</p>
<p>But I think the bigger question is,</p>
<p>can you actually solve</p>
<p>or can you actually identify all the corner cases</p>
<p>using a single sensing modality and using learning alone?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your intuition there?</p>
<p>So look, if you have a corner case</p>
<p>and your algorithm doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>your instinct is to go get data about the corner case</p>
<p>and patch it up, learn how to deal with that corner case.</p>
<p>But at some point, this is gonna saturate,</p>
<p>this approach is not viable.</p>
<p>So today, computer vision algorithms can detect</p>
<p>90% of the objects or can detect objects 90% of the time,</p>
<p>classify them 90% of the time.</p>
<p>Cats on the internet probably can do 95%, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But to get from 90% to 99%, you need a lot more data.</p>
<p>And then I tell you, well, that&rsquo;s not enough</p>
<p>because I have a safety critical application,</p>
<p>I wanna go from 99% to 99.9%.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s even more data.</p>
<p>So I think if you look at wanting accuracy on the X axis</p>
<p>and look at the amount of data on the Y axis,</p>
<p>I believe that curve is an exponential curve.</p>
<p>Wow, okay, it&rsquo;s even hard if it&rsquo;s linear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard if it&rsquo;s linear, totally,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s exponential.</p>
<p>And the other thing you have to think about</p>
<p>is that this process is a very, very power hungry process</p>
<p>to run data farms or servers.</p>
<p>Power, do you mean literally power?</p>
<p>Literally power, literally power.</p>
<p>So in 2014, five years ago, and I don&rsquo;t have more recent data,</p>
<p>2% of US electricity consumption was from data farms.</p>
<p>So we think about this as an information science</p>
<p>and information processing problem.</p>
<p>Actually, it is an energy processing problem.</p>
<p>And so unless we figured out better ways of doing this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is viable.</p>
<p>So talking about driving, which is a safety critical application</p>
<p>and some aspect of flight is safety critical,</p>
<p>maybe philosophical question, maybe an engineering one,</p>
<p>what problem do you think is harder to solve,</p>
<p>autonomous driving or autonomous flight?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting question.</p>
<p>I think autonomous flight has several advantages</p>
<p>that autonomous driving doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So look, if I want to go from point A to point B,</p>
<p>I have a very, very safe trajectory.</p>
<p>Go vertically up to a maximum altitude,</p>
<p>fly horizontally to just about the destination,</p>
<p>and then come down vertically.</p>
<p>This is preprogrammed.</p>
<p>The equivalent of that is very hard to find</p>
<p>in the self driving car world because you&rsquo;re on the ground,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in a two dimensional surface,</p>
<p>and the trajectories on the two dimensional surface</p>
<p>are more likely to encounter obstacles.</p>
<p>I mean this in an intuitive sense, but mathematically true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mathematically as well, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other option on the 2G space of platooning,</p>
<p>or because there&rsquo;s so many obstacles,</p>
<p>you can connect with those obstacles</p>
<p>and all these kind of options.</p>
<p>Sure, but those exist in the three dimensional space as well.</p>
<p>So they do.</p>
<p>So the question also implies how difficult are obstacles</p>
<p>in the three dimensional space in flight?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the downside.</p>
<p>I think in three dimensional space,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re modeling three dimensional world,</p>
<p>not just because you want to avoid it,</p>
<p>but you want to reason about it,</p>
<p>and you want to work in the three dimensional environment,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s significantly harder.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one disadvantage.</p>
<p>I think the second disadvantage is of course,</p>
<p>anytime you fly, you have to put up</p>
<p>with the peculiarities of aerodynamics</p>
<p>and their complicated environments.</p>
<p>How do you negotiate that?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s always a problem.</p>
<p>Do you see a time in the future where there is,</p>
<p>you mentioned there&rsquo;s agriculture applications.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of applications of flying robots,</p>
<p>but do you see a time in the future</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s tens of thousands,</p>
<p>or maybe hundreds of thousands of delivery drones</p>
<p>that fill the sky, delivery flying robots?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of potential</p>
<p>for the last mile delivery.</p>
<p>And so in crowded cities, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>if you go to a place like Hong Kong,</p>
<p>just crossing the river can take half an hour,</p>
<p>and while a drone can just do it in five minutes at most.</p>
<p>I think you look at delivery of supplies to remote villages.</p>
<p>I work with a nonprofit called Weave Robotics.</p>
<p>So they work in the Peruvian Amazon,</p>
<p>where the only highways that are available</p>
<p>are the only highways or rivers.</p>
<p>And to get from point A to point B may take five hours,</p>
<p>while with a drone, you can get there in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So just delivering drugs,</p>
<p>retrieving samples for testing vaccines,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s huge potential here.</p>
<p>So I think the challenges are not technological,</p>
<p>but the challenge is economical.</p>
<p>The one thing I&rsquo;ll tell you that nobody thinks about</p>
<p>is the fact that we&rsquo;ve not made huge strides</p>
<p>in battery technology.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true, batteries are becoming less expensive</p>
<p>because we have these mega factories that are coming up,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all based on lithium based technologies.</p>
<p>And if you look at the energy density</p>
<p>and the power density,</p>
<p>those are two fundamentally limiting numbers.</p>
<p>So power density is important</p>
<p>because for a UAV to take off vertically into the air,</p>
<p>which most drones do, they don&rsquo;t have a runway,</p>
<p>you consume roughly 200 watts per kilo at the small size.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot, right?</p>
<p>In contrast, the human brain consumes less than 80 watts,</p>
<p>the whole of the human brain.</p>
<p>So just imagine just lifting yourself into the air</p>
<p>is like two or three light bulbs,</p>
<p>which makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re going to have to at scale</p>
<p>solve the energy problem then,</p>
<p>charging the batteries, storing the energy and so on.</p>
<p>And then the storage is the second problem,</p>
<p>but storage limits the range.</p>
<p>But you have to remember that you have to burn</p>
<p>a lot of it per given time.</p>
<p>So the burning is another problem.</p>
<p>Which is a power question.</p>
<p>Yes, and do you think just your intuition,</p>
<p>there are breakthroughs in batteries on the horizon?</p>
<p>How hard is that problem?</p>
<p>Look, there are a lot of companies</p>
<p>that are promising flying cars that are autonomous</p>
<p>and that are clean.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re over promising.</p>
<p>The autonomy piece is doable.</p>
<p>The clean piece, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another company that I work with called JetOptra.</p>
<p>They make small jet engines.</p>
<p>And they can get up to 50 miles an hour very easily</p>
<p>and lift 50 kilos.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re jet engines, they&rsquo;re efficient,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a little louder than electric vehicles,</p>
<p>but they can build flying cars.</p>
<p>So your sense is that there&rsquo;s a lot of pieces</p>
<p>that have come together.</p>
<p>So on this crazy question,</p>
<p>if you look at companies like Kitty Hawk,</p>
<p>working on electric, so the clean,</p>
<p>talking to Sebastian Thrun, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crazy dream, you know?</p>
<p>But you work with flight a lot.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned before that manned flights</p>
<p>or carrying a human body is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>So how crazy is flying cars?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;ll be a day</p>
<p>when we have vertical takeoff and landing vehicles</p>
<p>that are sufficiently affordable</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to see a huge amount of them?</p>
<p>And they would look like something like we dream of</p>
<p>when we think about flying cars.</p>
<p>Yeah, like the Jetsons.</p>
<p>The Jetsons, yeah.</p>
<p>So look, there are a lot of smart people working on this</p>
<p>and you never say something is not possible</p>
<p>when you have people like Sebastian Thrun working on it.</p>
<p>So I totally think it&rsquo;s viable.</p>
<p>I question, again, the electric piece.</p>
<p>The electric piece, yeah.</p>
<p>And again, for short distances, you can do it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no reason to suggest</p>
<p>that these all just have to be rotorcrafts.</p>
<p>You take off vertically,</p>
<p>but then you morph into a forward flight.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of interesting designs.</p>
<p>The question to me is, are these economically viable?</p>
<p>And if you agree to do this with fossil fuels,</p>
<p>it instantly immediately becomes viable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real challenge.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible for robots and humans</p>
<p>to collaborate successfully on tasks?</p>
<p>So a lot of robotics folks that I talk to and work with,</p>
<p>I mean, humans just add a giant mess to the picture.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s best to remove them from consideration</p>
<p>when solving specific tasks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to model.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a source of uncertainty.</p>
<p>In your work with these agile flying robots,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s a role for collaboration with humans?</p>
<p>Or is it best to model tasks in a way</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have a human in the picture?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think we should ever think about robots</p>
<p>without human in the picture.</p>
<p>Ultimately, robots are there because we want them</p>
<p>to solve problems for humans.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no general solution to this problem.</p>
<p>I think if you look at human interaction</p>
<p>and how humans interact with robots,</p>
<p>you know, we think of these in sort of three different ways.</p>
<p>One is the human commanding the robot.</p>
<p>The second is the human collaborating with the robot.</p>
<p>So for example, we work on how a robot</p>
<p>can actually pick up things with a human and carry things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like true collaboration.</p>
<p>And third, we think about humans as bystanders,</p>
<p>self driving cars, what&rsquo;s the human&rsquo;s role</p>
<p>and how do self driving cars</p>
<p>acknowledge the presence of humans?</p>
<p>So I think all of these things are different scenarios.</p>
<p>It depends on what kind of humans, what kind of task.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a general theory that we all have for this.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it&rsquo;s also silly to say</p>
<p>that we should think about robots independent of humans.</p>
<p>So to me, human robot interaction</p>
<p>is almost a mandatory aspect of everything we do.</p>
<p>Yes, but to which degree, so your thoughts,</p>
<p>if we jump to autonomous vehicles, for example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big debate between what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>level two and level four.</p>
<p>So semi autonomous and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>And so the Tesla approach currently at least</p>
<p>has a lot of collaboration between human and machine.</p>
<p>So the human is supposed to actively supervise</p>
<p>the operation of the robot.</p>
<p>Part of the safety definition of how safe a robot is</p>
<p>in that case is how effective is the human in monitoring it.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s ultimately not a good approach</p>
<p>in sort of having a human in the picture,</p>
<p>not as a bystander or part of the infrastructure,</p>
<p>but really as part of what&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to make the system safe?</p>
<p>This is harder than it sounds.</p>
<p>I think, you know, if you, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve driven before in highways and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really very hard to have to relinquish control</p>
<p>to a machine and then take over when needed.</p>
<p>So I think Tesla&rsquo;s approach is interesting</p>
<p>because it allows you to periodically establish</p>
<p>some kind of contact with the car.</p>
<p>Toyota, on the other hand, is thinking about</p>
<p>shared autonomy or collaborative autonomy as a paradigm.</p>
<p>If I may argue, these are very, very simple ways</p>
<p>of human robot collaboration,</p>
<p>because the task is pretty boring.</p>
<p>You sit in a vehicle, you go from point A to point B.</p>
<p>I think the more interesting thing to me is,</p>
<p>for example, search and rescue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a human first responder, robot first responders.</p>
<p>I gotta do something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I have to do it in two minutes.</p>
<p>The building is burning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been an explosion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s collapsed.</p>
<p>How do I do it?</p>
<p>I think to me, those are the interesting things</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very, very unstructured.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the role of the human?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of the robot?</p>
<p>Clearly, there&rsquo;s lots of interesting challenges</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a field.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna make a lot of progress in this area.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s an exciting form of collaboration.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>In autonomous driving, the main enemy</p>
<p>is just boredom of the human.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>As opposed to in rescue operations,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally life and death.</p>
<p>And the collaboration enables</p>
<p>the effective completion of the mission.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>In some sense, we&rsquo;re also doing this.</p>
<p>You think about the human driving a car</p>
<p>and almost invariably, the human&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to estimate the state of the car,</p>
<p>they estimate the state of the environment and so on.</p>
<p>But what if the car were to estimate the state of the human?</p>
<p>So for example, I&rsquo;m sure you have a smartphone</p>
<p>and the smartphone tries to figure out what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and send you reminders and oftentimes telling you</p>
<p>to drive to a certain place,</p>
<p>although you have no intention of going there</p>
<p>because it thinks that that&rsquo;s where you should be</p>
<p>because of some Gmail calendar entry</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s trying to constantly figure out who you are,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>If a car were to do that,</p>
<p>maybe that would make the driver safer</p>
<p>because the car is trying to figure out</p>
<p>is the driver paying attention,</p>
<p>looking at his or her eyes,</p>
<p>looking at circadian movements.</p>
<p>So I think the potential is there,</p>
<p>but from the reverse side,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not robot modeling, but it&rsquo;s human modeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more on the human, right.</p>
<p>And I think the robots can do a very good job</p>
<p>of modeling humans if you really think about the framework</p>
<p>that you have a human sitting in a cockpit,</p>
<p>surrounded by sensors, all staring at him,</p>
<p>in addition to be staring outside,</p>
<p>but also staring at him.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a real synergy there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that problem</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the new 21st century form of psychology,</p>
<p>actually AI enabled psychology.</p>
<p>A lot of people have sci fi inspired fears</p>
<p>of walking robots like those from Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>If you just look at shows on Netflix and so on,</p>
<p>or flying robots like those you work with,</p>
<p>how would you, how do you think about those fears?</p>
<p>How would you alleviate those fears?</p>
<p>Do you have inklings, echoes of those same concerns?</p>
<p>You know, anytime we develop a technology</p>
<p>meaning to have positive impact in the world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always the worry that,</p>
<p>you know, somebody could subvert those technologies</p>
<p>and use it in an adversarial setting.</p>
<p>And robotics is no exception, right?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s very easy to weaponize robots.</p>
<p>I think we talk about swarms.</p>
<p>One thing I worry a lot about is,</p>
<p>so, you know, for us to get swarms to work</p>
<p>and do something reliably, it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>But suppose I have this challenge</p>
<p>of trying to destroy something,</p>
<p>and I have a swarm of robots,</p>
<p>where only one out of the swarm</p>
<p>needs to get to its destination.</p>
<p>So that suddenly becomes a lot more doable.</p>
<p>And so I worry about, you know,</p>
<p>this general idea of using autonomy</p>
<p>with lots and lots of agents.</p>
<p>I mean, having said that, look,</p>
<p>a lot of this technology is not very mature.</p>
<p>My favorite saying is that</p>
<p>if somebody had to develop this technology,</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you rather the good guys do it?</p>
<p>So the good guys have a good understanding</p>
<p>of the technology, so they can figure out</p>
<p>how this technology is being used in a bad way,</p>
<p>or could be used in a bad way and try to defend against it.</p>
<p>So we think a lot about that.</p>
<p>So we have, we&rsquo;re doing research</p>
<p>on how to defend against swarms, for example.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s in fact a report by the National Academies</p>
<p>on counter UAS technologies.</p>
<p>This is a real threat,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also thinking about how to defend against this</p>
<p>and knowing how swarms work.</p>
<p>Knowing how autonomy works is, I think, very important.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just politicians?</p>
<p>Do you think engineers have a role in this discussion?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think the days where politicians</p>
<p>can be agnostic to technology are gone.</p>
<p>I think every politician needs to be</p>
<p>literate in technology.</p>
<p>And I often say technology is the new liberal art.</p>
<p>Understanding how technology will change your life,</p>
<p>I think is important.</p>
<p>And every human being needs to understand that.</p>
<p>And maybe we can elect some engineers</p>
<p>to office as well on the other side.</p>
<p>What are the biggest open problems in robotics?</p>
<p>And you said we&rsquo;re in the early days in some sense.</p>
<p>What are the problems we would like to solve in robotics?</p>
<p>I think there are lots of problems, right?</p>
<p>But I would phrase it in the following way.</p>
<p>If you look at the robots we&rsquo;re building,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still very much tailored towards</p>
<p>doing specific tasks and specific settings.</p>
<p>I think the question of how do you get them to operate</p>
<p>in much broader settings</p>
<p>where things can change in unstructured environments</p>
<p>is up in the air.</p>
<p>So think of self driving cars.</p>
<p>Today, we can build a self driving car in a parking lot.</p>
<p>We can do level five autonomy in a parking lot.</p>
<p>But can you do a level five autonomy</p>
<p>in the streets of Napoli in Italy or Mumbai in India?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So in some sense, when we think about robotics,</p>
<p>we have to think about where they&rsquo;re functioning,</p>
<p>what kind of environment, what kind of a task.</p>
<p>We have no understanding</p>
<p>of how to put both those things together.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in the very early days</p>
<p>of applying it to the physical world.</p>
<p>And I was just in Naples actually.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s levels of difficulty and complexity</p>
<p>depending on which area you&rsquo;re applying it to.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have a systematic way of understanding that.</p>
<p>Everybody says, just because a computer</p>
<p>can now beat a human at any board game,</p>
<p>we certainly know something about intelligence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>A computer board game is very, very structured.</p>
<p>It is the equivalent of working in a Henry Ford factory</p>
<p>where things, parts come, you assemble, move on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very, very structured setting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the easiest thing.</p>
<p>And we know how to do that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done a lot of incredible work</p>
<p>at the UPenn, University of Pennsylvania, GraspLab.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now Dean of Engineering at UPenn.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for a new bright eyed undergrad</p>
<p>interested in robotics or AI or engineering?</p>
<p>Well, I think there&rsquo;s really three things.</p>
<p>One is you have to get used to the idea</p>
<p>that the world will not be the same in five years</p>
<p>or four years whenever you graduate, right?</p>
<p>Which is really hard to do.</p>
<p>So this thing about predicting the future,</p>
<p>every one of us needs to be trying</p>
<p>to predict the future always.</p>
<p>Not because you&rsquo;ll be any good at it,</p>
<p>but by thinking about it,</p>
<p>I think you sharpen your senses and you become smarter.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>Number two, it&rsquo;s a corollary of the first piece,</p>
<p>which is you really don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gonna be important.</p>
<p>So this idea that I&rsquo;m gonna specialize in something</p>
<p>which will allow me to go in a particular direction,</p>
<p>it may be interesting,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important also to have this breadth</p>
<p>so you have this jumping off point.</p>
<p>I think the third thing,</p>
<p>and this is where I think Penn excels.</p>
<p>I mean, we teach engineering,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always in the context of the liberal arts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always in the context of society.</p>
<p>As engineers, we cannot afford to lose sight of that.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But I think one thing that people underestimate</p>
<p>when they do robotics</p>
<p>is the importance of mathematical foundations,</p>
<p>the importance of representations.</p>
<p>Not everything can just be solved</p>
<p>by looking for Ross packages on the internet</p>
<p>or to find a deep neural network that works.</p>
<p>I think the representation question is key,</p>
<p>even to machine learning,</p>
<p>where if you ever hope to achieve or get to explainable AI,</p>
<p>somehow there need to be representations</p>
<p>that you can understand.</p>
<p>So if you wanna do robotics,</p>
<p>you should also do mathematics.</p>
<p>And you said liberal arts, a little literature.</p>
<p>If you wanna build a robot,</p>
<p>it should be reading Dostoyevsky.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>So Vijay, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>It was an honor.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It was just a very exciting conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
