content="Video Transcript ﻿all right i&amp;rsquo;m back to answer another question someone wanted to know why am i hungry in the morning while i&amp;rsquo;m on keto and doing intermittent fasting i have done another video on this but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find so i&amp;rsquo;m just going to create a video on this topic and just cover all the different pieces of this puzzle there&amp;rsquo;s really three reasons why you are hungry in the morning if you&amp;rsquo;re doing keto and intermittent fasting the first one involves a hormone called cortisol so about eight o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning and this could actually happen at six o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning up to ten so during that period of time what happens you have a spike in cortisol cortisol or another name for cortisol is glucocorticoids because it affects glucose one of the functions of cortisol which is made by your adrenals is to release glucose from your stored sugar glycogen now in the morning if it&amp;rsquo;s going to release sugar from your liver you&amp;rsquo;re going to get a little spike of sugar and then your insulin is going to come in and bring your sugar down so when it comes down you&amp;rsquo;re going to be hungry now i want to just differentiate between being hungry and having hypoglycemia if you&amp;rsquo;re hungry and you still feel fine you still are strong you&amp;rsquo;re not moody you&amp;rsquo;re not dizzy then just ignore this symptom and just push through it because it&amp;rsquo;s only going to last maybe 10 minutes 15 minutes and it&amp;rsquo;s going to go away now the correct indication of when you should start eating after fasting is when you&amp;rsquo;re truly hungry and you&amp;rsquo;re feeling weak or irritable and dizzy i mean you should definitely eat you don&amp;rsquo;t want to push through that but if it&amp;rsquo;s some slight stomach hunger or grumbling in your stomach just ignore that push through that that&amp;rsquo;s usually temporary and usually this hunger in the morning usually occurs in the very beginning stages of doing ketosis and intermittent fasting all right number two and this is very common the reason why you&amp;rsquo;re hungry in the morning is what you ate the day before especially if it&amp;rsquo;s the night before now two things either you ate too many carbs the night before or you had some snacks either right before bed or sometime in the middle of the day and it could have been some healthy snacks but you&amp;rsquo;re again you&amp;rsquo;re spiking insulin because you ain&amp;rsquo;t so both of those actions will spike insulin to some degree and then create a situation where your blood sugars come down and you&amp;rsquo;re mainly going to feel it the next day either in cravings for carbs or being hungry and this definitely can occur when you consume wine the night before so just realize that it&amp;rsquo;s not that it&amp;rsquo;s not working you just have to push through this and be more consistent today so tomorrow the cravings go away the biggest indication to know that you&amp;rsquo;re doing this correctly is that you have no more hunger and you&amp;rsquo;re not craving anything so that&amp;rsquo;s like a very important thing all right let&amp;rsquo;s go to number three this is simply you haven&amp;rsquo;t done the program long enough sometimes it takes three days to really get into ketosis sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s five and for some people it could be several weeks before you really truly adapt and get into ketosis and your body is very efficient at burning fat a couple things you can do to make this transition more smooth is to increase more fat at the meal increase apple cider vinegar in water before the meal one tablespoon and water before the each meal and to increase your veggies so you get more potassium and magnesium and fiber all three of those things will help stabilize your blood sugars so your hunger goes away but the most important thing you need to know is that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to eat unless you&amp;rsquo;re hungry so if you&amp;rsquo;re not hungry in the morning even though it might be a habit to eat skip it and go as long as you can before you go if you have a question about a product or you&amp;rsquo;re new to keto and you want to know how to begin keto or you&amp;rsquo;re on keto and you need a debug because it&amp;rsquo;s not going as smooth i have a keto consultant standing by to help you this is just for the people in the us hopefully in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&amp;rsquo;s call but i put the number down below so you can call and get some help you"><meta property="og:url" content="https://swiest.com/en/yr-z6lw-ycg/"><meta

someone wanted to know why am i hungry in the  </p><p>morning while i&rsquo;m on keto and doing intermittent 
fasting i have done another video on this but  </p><p>sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to find so i&rsquo;m just going to 
create a video on this topic and just cover all  </p><p>the different pieces of this puzzle there&rsquo;s really 
three reasons why you are hungry in the morning if  </p><p>you&rsquo;re doing keto and intermittent fasting the 
first one involves a hormone called cortisol  </p><p>so about eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning and this 
could actually happen at six o&rsquo;clock in the  </p><p>morning up to ten so during that period of time 
what happens you have a spike in cortisol cortisol  </p><p>or another name for cortisol is glucocorticoids 
because it affects glucose one of the functions  </p><p>of cortisol which is made by your adrenals is to 
release glucose from your stored sugar glycogen  </p><p>now in the morning if it&rsquo;s going to release sugar 
from your liver you&rsquo;re going to get a little spike  </p><p>of sugar and then your insulin is going to come 
in and bring your sugar down so when it comes down  </p><p>you&rsquo;re going to be hungry now i want to just 
differentiate between being hungry and having  </p><p>hypoglycemia if you&rsquo;re hungry and you still feel 
fine you still are strong you&rsquo;re not moody you&rsquo;re  </p><p>not dizzy then just ignore this symptom and just 
push through it because it&rsquo;s only going to last  </p><p>maybe 10 minutes 15 minutes and it&rsquo;s going to go 
away now the correct indication of when you should  </p><p>start eating after fasting is when you&rsquo;re truly 
hungry and you&rsquo;re feeling weak or irritable  </p><p>and dizzy i mean you should definitely 
eat you don&rsquo;t want to push through that  </p><p>but if it&rsquo;s some slight stomach hunger or 
grumbling in your stomach just ignore that  </p><p>push through that that&rsquo;s usually temporary and 
usually this hunger in the morning usually occurs  </p><p>in the very beginning stages of doing ketosis and 
intermittent fasting all right number two and this  </p><p>is very common the reason why you&rsquo;re hungry 
in the morning is what you ate the day before  </p><p>especially if it&rsquo;s the night before now two things 
either you ate too many carbs the night before  </p><p>or you had some snacks either right before 
bed or sometime in the middle of the day and  </p><p>it could have been some healthy snacks but you&rsquo;re 
again you&rsquo;re spiking insulin because you ain&rsquo;t  </p><p>so both of those actions will spike insulin to 
some degree and then create a situation where  </p><p>your blood sugars come down and you&rsquo;re 
mainly going to feel it the next day  </p><p>either in cravings for carbs or being hungry 
and this definitely can occur when you consume  </p><p>wine the night before so just realize 
that it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s not working  </p><p>you just have to push through this and be more 
consistent today so tomorrow the cravings go away  </p><p>the biggest indication to know that you&rsquo;re doing 
this correctly is that you have no more hunger and  </p><p>you&rsquo;re not craving anything so that&rsquo;s like a very 
important thing all right let&rsquo;s go to number three  </p><p>this is simply you haven&rsquo;t done the program long 
enough sometimes it takes three days to really  </p><p>get into ketosis sometimes it&rsquo;s five and for some 
people it could be several weeks before you really  </p><p>truly adapt and get into ketosis and your 
body is very efficient at burning fat a  </p><p>couple things you can do to make this transition 
more smooth is to increase more fat at the meal  </p><p>increase apple cider vinegar in water before the 
meal one tablespoon and water before the each meal  </p><p>and to increase your veggies so you get more 
potassium and magnesium and fiber all three  </p><p>of those things will help stabilize your blood 
sugars so your hunger goes away but the most  </p><p>important thing you need to know is that you don&rsquo;t 
want to eat unless you&rsquo;re hungry so if you&rsquo;re not  </p><p>hungry in the morning even though it might be a 
habit to eat skip it and go as long as you can  </p><p>before you go if you have a question about a 
product or you&rsquo;re new to keto and you want to  </p><p>know how to begin keto or you&rsquo;re on keto and you 
need a debug because it&rsquo;s not going as smooth  </p><p>i have a keto consultant standing by to help you  </p><p>this is just for the people in the us hopefully in 
the future we&rsquo;ll be able to answer everyone&rsquo;s call  </p><p>but i put the number down below so 
you can call and get some help you</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
