<p>Oh, hi.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Hi, I missed you.</p>
<p>Holy shit, Sofia and I don&rsquo;t really spend much time alone.</p>
<p>The wheat of the fact that we spend an entire weekend apart is kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p>1:26</p>
<p>We do not spend time alone.</p>
<p>Ours, is we cry.</p>
<p>We text all the time.</p>
<p>So Sofia went somewhere this weekend.</p>

<p>Get in my way.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;re transitioning to Summer.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s happy in New York.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what the fuck is up?</p>
<p>Every single person after five o&rsquo;clock goes to a rooftop or a bar.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, we all turn into alcoholics in New York City, real.</p>
<p>2:15</p>
<p>Fucking quick come summertime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like right now like right now.</p>

<p>So summer, bozz.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Good thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have my summer bonds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go into an actual deep depression.</p>
<p>So, Sofia and I joined a gym.</p>
<p>Whoa, and well, let&rsquo;s just say That we&rsquo;ve gone, I think almost 10 times, 10 times, and it&rsquo;s been six months.</p>
<p>2:53</p>
<p>So, cheers to that.</p>
<p>So we joined a gym.</p>
<p>We never go and Sofia, and I one night drunkenly.</p>
<p>We lost our debit cards, and they say, night, God, we&rsquo;re hose.</p>
<p>And so we lost our debit cards.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re getting emails from our gym saying, hi, your payment isn&rsquo;t going through.</p>
<p>3:12</p>
<p>Next time.</p>
<p>You come in.</p>
<p>We need to re-up your What your membership safe to say?</p>
<p>We are avoiding the gym, like the motherfuckin viral plague.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I will never go back already one to avoid the gym, just because it&rsquo;s the fucking gym, and now that we owe money.</p>
<p>3:29</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I will see you in 20 22 years from now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never see you again.</p>
<p>Look at me, don&rsquo;t speak to me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you guys have fucking heard of It you&rsquo;ve done it, whatever I double, tap this picture, that was four months old and listen to what I fucking did because you this is about to blow your minds.</p>
<p>I had two and a half minute to figure something out.</p>
<p>8:30</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what do I do?</p>
<p>Do I deactivate my account?</p>
<p>Where do I go?</p>
<p>I changed my name to Sandra Martinelli.</p>
<p>I changed it from Sophia Franklin to Sandra Martinelli.</p>
<p>I changed my profile picture, too.</p>
<p>8:45</p>
<p>A cartoon I put my shit on private.</p>
<p>So you best believe when that bitch went to go look at who looked at her four-month-old picture, whatever Sandra, finally looked at the picture, Sophia Franklin, at their very moment in time entered, the witness protection program.</p>
<p>9:03</p>
<p>Sofia Franklin was dead, Sandra Martinelli was alive, and real and thriving, and that makes me so hot new thing called.</p>
<p>And the best part is is that I was so, To the lie, and so terrified that I was going to get figured out.</p>
<p>9:20</p>
<p>I left it like that for a few days and might friends and family were like, are you having an identity crisis?</p>
<p>What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>Angela Sophia.</p>
<p>Are you good?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Sandra Martinelli now, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Whatever that&rsquo;s fucking brilliant.</p>
<p>9:36</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>Do you know what my advice to anyone?</p>
<p>If you ever double top change your identity on Instagram?</p>
<p>And good luck.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re golden.</p>
<p>So last week, I have to just transition here because I cannot not talked about this last week.</p>
<p>9:55</p>
<p>We address this guy.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s a millionaire and he&rsquo;s got this crazy bitch on his dick.</p>
<p>So left out a very important detail that you kind of are talking to him for a second.</p>
<p>So the reason is story is so relevant is I did make out with him a couple times.</p>
<p>10:10</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never slept with the guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never put a finger in my butt, and then I&rsquo;ve never put my mouth on his way.</p>
<p>Are but we have had some little make-out sessions and he did some weird fucking shit with my ear one time.</p>
<p>And I was like, dude, get the even a do that.</p>
<p>But I told you I&rsquo;m on the way home and over and he was like, he was like blowing in my ear.</p>
<p>10:27</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like who you like that?</p>
<p>Mike actually.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;d rather die, but go for it to holes.</p>
<p>You should go for and what your holes are not one of them.</p>
<p>Say the home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s blowing in my ear and I&rsquo;m like, this is what I Knew You Can Be Rich As Fuck, but I do not like this shit and I&rsquo;m not into it.</p>
<p>10:42</p>
<p>So we said he has a crazy ass girl.</p>
<p>Earl boom done there in Cuba together, even though he doesn&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, this past weekend, again.</p>
<p>I said Sophia and I were not together.</p>
<p>I get a DM, from this guy&rsquo;s account, but not from him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pulling up my phone right now because God speed U, then shave.</p>
<p>11:01</p>
<p>I get a message from his so-called girlfriend.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, this guy has been married, he has kids and now he&rsquo;s like dating serial dating, which is fine.</p>
<p>I would do the same thing.</p>
<p>I got a shit ton of money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fuck bitches, get my money.</p>
<p>Fucking better.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>So I get a message and it This is and then she puts her name.</p>
<p>11:18</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a lying bastard.</p>
<p>Just saying, dot dot dot, his loving girlfriend.</p>
<p>He lies to, I&rsquo;m saving you save me, Jack go fuck yourself, busy donkeys evening.</p>
<p>And then and then we go.</p>
<p>11:34</p>
<p>Look at his Instagram profile.</p>
<p>And what do we see?</p>
<p>Ten back-to-back photos of the two of them?</p>
<p>So in love shit, he would never in his right mind or drunk.</p>
<p>Miners, I might Post in his life.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s going ham and she&rsquo;s posting every pic.</p>
<p>11:50</p>
<p>She has in her photo album of the, two of them.</p>
<p>And the captions were like, oh my, and then puts her name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been more in love the six months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent with you have really touched my soul baked.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s not you.</p>
<p>And his friends were commenting being like they put the bat emoji, and then the fight and then said crazy.</p>
<p>12:08</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re batshit crazy bitch, but the bad emoji and then the poop emoji.</p>
<p>Batshit like his friends were like, Dude, get a hold of your phone.</p>
<p>This girl&rsquo;s fucking taking over hijacking.</p>
<p>And so, I think we said, okay, the girl said, you know, your entire company is taking over our brains were like, oh, wow, she&rsquo;s really pushing it.</p>
<p>12:28</p>
<p>But the fact that she hacked his Instagram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s the last straw for me.</p>
<p>So, if this guy goes back to her, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never let your tongue insert my tongue again.</p>
<p>Yeah, bitch.</p>
<p>And we said guys, love the crazy.</p>
<p>In other levels.</p>
<p>To be a certain threshold of crazy.</p>
<p>12:43</p>
<p>That guys are like, no, no, no, Oh, now you&rsquo;re actually done but honestly, they&rsquo;ll probably be married tomorrow.</p>
<p>So let me just say that this is my thing.</p>
<p>I also probably should have done more investigation, but I have to ask if she&rsquo;s that crazy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even really know what she looks like.</p>
<p>12:59</p>
<p>Like shame on me.</p>
<p>I should have been stalking but I didn&rsquo;t really give a shit.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Is she there are two options.</p>
<p>Is she a nine or a ten that she&rsquo;s so fucking hot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, dude, whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the crazy cuz she&rsquo;s a dime.</p>
<p>Or is she a five or a six?</p>
<p>13:14</p>
<p>And she Is fucking disgusting and that it&rsquo;s like, Slob on my motherfucking not baby.</p>
<p>I will love you till the end.</p>
<p>Which one is it?</p>
<p>Cuz it&rsquo;s got to be one of the two, no issue that hot cheese.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna answer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna be a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>13:31</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s sitting here judging.</p>
<p>But so let me just say, because starting with that, I think you and I can both say we&rsquo;ve had this conversation and we honestly kind of sound like dudes when we talk like this, but all my home girls out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten our DDM sweet.</p>
<p>Like oh my God, you sound like us girls know this shit guys think we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>13:49</p>
<p>They play these games and you know, this is what it comes down to the crazy.</p>
<p>You can get away more with if you&rsquo;re a nine or ten.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We are a five or six.</p>
<p>Not so much the sex if you&rsquo;re a nine or ten years ago five and a six.</p>
<p>If you are a five or six, get your squats in today, bitch.</p>

<p>14:47</p>

<p>I bet you forget it.</p>
<p>We know this guy that was fucking as he considered now.</p>
<p>To put it out there before we continue this conversation, every guy has their definition of a five or six verse or nine or ten.</p>
<p>15:21</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not defying, whatever, whatever.</p>
<p>So this guy&rsquo;s definition of a five.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, I&rsquo;m fucking a five tonight.</p>
<p>He had a little situation set up where this girl was a hard five.</p>
<p>She knew her place.</p>

<p>15:39</p>
<p>So what he had her do, what?</p>
<p>Oh my God, the girl had.</p>
<p>To climb in the window.</p>
<p>She was not allowed to use the front door.</p>
<p>No, she had to climb inside his apartment Window and then she would fuck him but she was not allowed to speak, not a word lay on the bed and do your damn thing.</p>

<p>She knew her place and she&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m gonna crawl right in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get the best dick of my life, because I bet he fucks and then she&rsquo;s out and for her, maybe that&rsquo;s what she needed.</p>
