    <p>Hi friends! We&rsquo;re starting this episode off with a shot because we have a lot to</p>
<p>celebrate a lot of things to be happy about and I&rsquo;m gonna basically run you</p>
<p>through why am I holding it like it&rsquo;s my own prized possession I&rsquo;m gonna run you</p>
<p>through what the fuck&rsquo;s happened this week because my entire reality has just</p>
<p>broken in the best way possible and I&rsquo;m gonna literally like relive the week</p>
<p>with you and tell you all the fucking shit that&rsquo;s happened and then get</p>
<p>vulnerable like I always do and like tell you some other shit but I have to</p>
<p>get ready to go out because I&rsquo;m gonna go celebrate and also I have to go out</p>
<p>because my cousin&rsquo;s birthday so we have a lot of things to cheers about so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take a shot like get the pregame but I have to film a podcast cuz it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Saturday night so I&rsquo;m a little late this week because everything that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>happening I&rsquo;ve been so busy so many good things I don&rsquo;t have a chaser it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>water so we&rsquo;re gonna have to chase for the fucking prayer I guess come on God</p>
<p>help okay cheers to everything I&rsquo;m about to tell you about I feel so</p>
<p>fucking skinny okay let&rsquo;s jump into this so my whole life I&rsquo;ve always felt like</p>
<p>my life has been a gaslight and what I mean by that is like I always have felt</p>
<p>like I make so many shifts internally and so much changes inside of me and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just waiting on my reality to catch up and it&rsquo;s been the most frustrating</p>
<p>experience of my fucking life but after this week I feel like my reality is 20</p>
<p>steps ahead and I&rsquo;m trying to catch up it&rsquo;s like one thing after another and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like bro what the fuck hold pump the brakes but don&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many good things I&rsquo;m like I can&rsquo;t slow down I can&rsquo;t stop like nothing I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want anything that&rsquo;s happening to stop cuz it&rsquo;s so good it&rsquo;s like a positive</p>
<p>overwhelm and I&rsquo;ve never fucking felt that before all I&rsquo;m used to is</p>
<p>disappointment I don&rsquo;t know how to fucking deal with good shit happening</p>
<p>and like so many good things going on that I&rsquo;m so busy and like overwhelmed</p>
<p>but I have a very high tolerance of disappointment because that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking used to but after this week I&rsquo;ve had to learn and like fix my</p>
<p>relationship to good things happening to me but basically my entire reality broke</p>
<p>and the person you see sitting in front of you or sitting on your screen hey or</p>
<p>the person you&rsquo;re listening to is totally new and for the first time a lot</p>
<p>has shifted in me but also outside of me and when I mean by like my entire</p>
<p>reality broke so many of my thought patterns so many of my beliefs about</p>
<p>life my hopes my dreams all this bullshit that just sounds so nice girl</p>
<p>it can happen it&rsquo;s very fucking real and I&rsquo;m as like normal as you can get like</p>
<p>where you get me it&rsquo;s like your little bestie telling you this shit it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re watching all these good things happen to me and I promise it can happen</p>
<p>for you too like I was the person that was watching people&rsquo;s YouTube talking</p>
<p>about how they hit a million followers on social media cuz I hit a million on</p>
<p>tik-tok I was the one that was always watching people&rsquo;s tik-toks like how they</p>
<p>moved away from their hometown I&rsquo;m like how did they figure it out how did they</p>
<p>make money how did people grow on social media and now I am the person that other</p>
<p>people are watching because I did it like when I ran away and moved to</p>
<p>Houston like this was the best decision I ever made in my fucking life</p>
<p>something was just telling me to do it and I did and I just listened and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like holy fuck the things that line up when you pay attention to your intuition</p>
<p>no better feeling but a lot of my beliefs were just broken this week and</p>
<p>the level of support that I feel from you guys is different like it&rsquo;s so much</p>
<p>more different I knew you guys supported me but I dropped my clothing and it</p>
<p>completely sold the fuck out in like three and a half days like sold out like</p>
<p>all of it and I thought like maybe one or two things would sell out like after</p>
<p>a month no bitch every single fucking thing gone</p>
<p>poof out of stock huh but let me rewind a little bit I&rsquo;m gonna take you through</p>
<p>the last four days cuz it hasn&rsquo;t even been a week it&rsquo;s just been the last four</p>
<p>days that have been like whoa cuz I dropped everything on Wednesday so let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go for day one of the launch everything that&rsquo;s happened because so many things</p>
<p>have happened that are related to the launch and the clothing and so many</p>
<p>things are unrelated that are just like weird the coincidences and the things</p>
<p>that are just lining up all at once okay so day one dropped my merch and the</p>
<p>first 20 minutes I got 200 orders I literally was sitting here at my</p>
<p>computer like posting all of my posts online like I was trying to post on all</p>
<p>my different social medias that it&rsquo;s live post the links everywhere and I was</p>
<p>like watching the orders just keep going and I literally was shaking like I</p>
<p>was already like this like I was just in here looking at my computer like bugging</p>
<p>out like I have my phone in my hand I was trying to post my stories I was</p>
<p>trying to post on my social media like oh my god it&rsquo;s dropped yay and like I</p>
<p>had to keep functioning even while I was like freaking the fuck out like I was</p>
<p>already shaking like a fucking little chihuahua not out of fear but just out</p>
<p>of so much overwhelm of like what the fuck is happening I was geeking out like</p>
<p>I was like on a whole bunch of extracurriculars I was on none I was</p>
<p>higher on life for the first time so when I dropped this clothing I truly</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think that many people would buy it I like figured like 500 things would</p>
<p>sell like after a month girl we got 200 orders in the first 20 minutes and at</p>
<p>the end of the day the end of day one there was a thousand orders and some</p>
<p>orders had multiple items and shit I was literally like what the fuck is my</p>
<p>life dude like this doesn&rsquo;t happen to me I watch this happen to other people but</p>
<p>like the fact that it was happening to me I couldn&rsquo;t wrap my mind around it and</p>
<p>something happened to me that revealed a lot about like myself it&rsquo;s kind of my</p>
<p>like emotional switch like I can turn my emotions off like a switch I just turn</p>
<p>them off and I get into fix-it mode it&rsquo;s like it comes from nursing but also like</p>
<p>my childhood and like having to handle certain shit I have the ability to</p>
<p>switch my emotions off and feel nothing and just be strategic and like cold and</p>
<p>focused and do whatever needs to be done like a patient can be dying in front of</p>
<p>me and all the emotions go off and I get into fix-it mode and I will handle the</p>
<p>situation at hand whenever I feel too strongly of any like fear worry anxiety</p>
<p>heartbreak I switch off and I can&rsquo;t control it it just switches off and my</p>
<p>body gets to stimulate like a trauma response I don&rsquo;t fucking know but my</p>
<p>body just switches off and it gets ready to handle anything in front of it I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like fight-or-flight mode I don&rsquo;t flight I fight I deal with the situation so my</p>
<p>body gets ready like that and in the middle of the launch I was so this is</p>
<p>the first time it&rsquo;s ever happened to me I was so overwhelmed with so many</p>
<p>emotions like I was on the verge of tears but like also like freaking out</p>
<p>trying to post everything and then all of a sudden it turned off and I like</p>
<p>went out like I like checked out and like it numbed out and that feeling came</p>
<p>back of like handle it and I was like whoa because this is the first time I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>ever switched off because I was so overwhelmed by positive feelings and I</p>
<p>was like no wait come back come back like never in my life have I ever been</p>
<p>so overwhelmed by joy and happiness that I go numb ever it&rsquo;s always the bad</p>
<p>emotions like the fear the worry like the heartbreak it all switches off for</p>
<p>that but my body switched off because I was so fucking happy and usually what</p>
<p>happens when my body switches off is whatever situation at hand I have to</p>
<p>handle that&rsquo;s caused me to feel so freaked out I&rsquo;ll handle it and then like</p>
<p>a week a month later all of a sudden it&rsquo;s like that situation switches back</p>
<p>on and like I process everything I was feeling and I&rsquo;ll like have a fucking</p>
<p>breakdown and like it all comes back and I have to deal with it and face it and I</p>
<p>literally when I went numb I got so excited because I was like when this</p>
<p>shit switches back on it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;m gonna be so overwhelmed with</p>
<p>happiness and not fear and heartbreak and sadness like I&rsquo;m so excited for when</p>
<p>that shit switches on and when I really truly realize the situation that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going through like I&rsquo;m so fucking excited for it y&rsquo;all get it y&rsquo;all fully</p>
<p>fucking get it but I just want to say thank you like holy fuck like what y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>have just done for me I&rsquo;m like what the hell but I&rsquo;m not even like two steps</p>
<p>into all the good shit that&rsquo;s happened okay we got to keep going so day one we</p>
<p>hit a thousand fucking orders JWoww followed me bitch on tik-tok the</p>
<p>fucking JWoww Ginny Farley followed me and when I posted that I had like 200</p>
<p>sales in 20 minutes on my tik-tok story she fucking commented congratulations</p>
<p>and then I get a notification of an order and it&rsquo;s fucking JWoww she</p>
<p>literally ordered some of my fucking merch and I lost my mind like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fangirl of a fucking nobody but JWoww come on anyone that&rsquo;s like big or famous</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fangirl over nobody I don&rsquo;t give nobody that satisfaction of like oh</p>
<p>you like fangirl over me no but JWoww yeah I will and I was just so in a state</p>
<p>of like what the fuck like little me grew up watching JWoww little me grew up</p>
<p>watching Jersey Shore and loving that shit and like the fact that someone that</p>
<p>I used to watch and respect and look up to so much knows who I am likes me</p>
<p>follows me comments on all my fucking videos and then ordered my fucking merch</p>
<p>what literally I still don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to do it myself I keep saying I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself I&rsquo;ve said it a hundred times the last couple</p>
<p>of days but I don&rsquo;t know what to do like I literally didn&rsquo;t want to go to sleep</p>
<p>on day one because I felt like I was in a dream like all of my limiting beliefs</p>
<p>all of my self-doubt any worry any fear that I had poof was it gone with</p>
<p>everything that happened and I was just like whoa I genuinely did not want the</p>
<p>day to end and I&rsquo;ve never had a day like that in my life I&rsquo;ve always looked</p>
<p>forward to the next day because I&rsquo;m like I get to just fucking like wash my hands</p>
<p>with the day before and like go to the next day it&rsquo;s a new start but I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want the day to end I didn&rsquo;t go to bed till like 5 a.m. because I was so</p>
<p>excited I was just like what the fuck is my new reality like what the fuck is</p>
<p>my new life like this little life I just stepped into as soon as two o&rsquo;clock hit</p>
<p>and all my clothing launched everything flipped and like the life that I stepped</p>
<p>into was one that I really fucking like and I&rsquo;m like holy shit like it&rsquo;s mine</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s my life I still don&rsquo;t know what to do it myself drink I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>I drink that a little too smooth oh my god it&rsquo;s so bad I look like an</p>
<p>alcoholic okay so day one I finally went the fuck to bed I was so goddamn tired</p>
<p>like my adrenaline had been going all day and like you know when you have like</p>
<p>an adrenaline spike you crash I finally crashed and I was up bright and early at</p>
<p>8 a.m. on three hours of fucking sleep because I was so excited to wake up and</p>
<p>like experience the next day and like what the fuck is gonna happen I wake up</p>
<p>and the day goes on and orders keep coming in and I was literally so</p>
<p>fucking blown away because at the end of day two I hit 1,600 orders one thousand</p>
<p>six hundred one six zero zero hey my five hundred I thought I was gonna get</p>
<p>please are you kidding universe laughing at me but day two I started like my</p>
<p>emotions started like picking back up and like I started like tapping back in</p>
<p>and I was like okay like I was taking in the situation for what it was and I just</p>
<p>had a great fucking day and then more influencers that I follow started</p>
<p>ordering my shit and I was like huh like so many people that are like big I</p>
<p>forget that I&rsquo;m big now my god I still think I&rsquo;m just normal as fuck I just</p>
<p>have a couple numbers next to my usernames you know what I mean like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re normal fuck I don&rsquo;t get it I don&rsquo;t see myself as like an influencer I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>claim that shit it&rsquo;s embarrassing but it is what I am at this point so I</p>
<p>literally was like blown away because orders just kept coming in all day like</p>
<p>I was literally like cooking and my phone would be going off like I was</p>
<p>taking a shit and my phone was going off I was like what the fuck like it just</p>
<p>kept going and I was just like in fucking shock all day it was like every</p>
<p>time my phone went off I was so happy and I told y&rsquo;all about the shit I went</p>
<p>through with an ex of mine where I told y&rsquo;all how I got harassed so bad and for</p>
<p>the last two years every time my phone that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s always on do not disturb</p>
<p>every time my phone goes off it was like a panic or like a dread or like when</p>
<p>your stomach drops it&rsquo;s like like what the fuck now like anytime an unknown</p>
<p>number text me my stomach drops still I&rsquo;m still dealing with shit from that</p>
<p>because for like a year every time my phone went off it was more and more</p>
<p>devastation it was more and more harassment it was more and more shit so</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s still something that I deal with is every time my phone goes off I</p>
<p>panic that&rsquo;s why I always have it muted I always have my phone muted and I like</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m doing anything I have it on do not disturb because there&rsquo;s been so many</p>
<p>times where my phone will go off when I&rsquo;m in the middle of something like my</p>
<p>stomach will drop and my heart will like skip a fucking beat for a second</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like god damn it but I left my phone on loud and this whole experience</p>
<p>like repaired my relationship with my phone going off like I was so excited</p>
<p>every time my fucking phone went off and I was just like I can&rsquo;t describe it like</p>
<p>what y&rsquo;all have done for me is so much more than you fucking realize but day 2</p>
<p>was a lot of like influencers and people that I look up to and people that I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think would buy bought and I was just like whoa so we ended the day with</p>
<p>1600 orders and then day 3 is when shit got fucking wild so day 3 I wake up</p>
<p>orders are still trickling in it&rsquo;s like slow now it&rsquo;s like slowed down orders</p>
<p>are like coming in slowly and I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m still getting them but they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>slowing down I&rsquo;m like okay I&rsquo;m finally taking in what&rsquo;s happened I&rsquo;m seeing the</p>
<p>numbers and I&rsquo;m just like what the fuck then I get an email of a confirmation of</p>
<p>a date to be a guest on Drew Afiolo&rsquo;s podcast and if you don&rsquo;t know her you</p>
<p>should you fucking should bitch but I had been talking to them about being on</p>
<p>the podcast and I didn&rsquo;t really think it was gonna like happen and cuz Drew</p>
<p>followed me her boyfriend followed me I fucking love them obsessed with them</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s followed me for like a few months now but I reached out and was like yo I</p>
<p>think we make a killer fucking podcast episode and she reached back out and was</p>
<p>like yes I&rsquo;ll have my team like schedule you and I never heard back for like a</p>
<p>couple weeks I was like oh they forgot and then I got the confirmation email</p>
<p>and they said pick between these two dates and then you&rsquo;re booked on the</p>
<p>podcast and I was like hi what the fuck I literally picked a date and they got</p>
<p>back to me like in three minutes and we&rsquo;re like okay you&rsquo;re booked you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>scheduled here&rsquo;s the outline and I was like this is real like it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m a be on that bitch&rsquo;s podcast so day three we get the fucking confirmation to go on</p>
<p>Drew&rsquo;s podcast what the hell and I go and I have to go book a ticket I have to</p>
<p>go to LA so I can go be on this fucking podcast so I&rsquo;m like shit okay so I start</p>
<p>looking up tickets I got to look up tickets and not be worried about the</p>
<p>cost of it because the orders were coming in and I was like Leo you have</p>
<p>money to spend now you can invest back into your career without stressing like</p>
<p>go buy yourself a fucking ticket and I got to enjoy the experience of being</p>
<p>booked on a huge podcast like that and also enjoy the experience of booking the</p>
<p>flight and not worrying like I got like the most peaceful smooth like I got</p>
<p>accepted I bought the flight and I&rsquo;m like holy shit so I that&rsquo;s another thing</p>
<p>I want to say thank you for like when I just talked about in my last episode</p>
<p>about money makes you happy y&rsquo;all just gave me the ability to like enjoy the</p>
<p>fucking moment and the good things that are happening to me oh my I can&rsquo;t put it</p>
<p>into words but I booked my flight and I made it for like five or six days cuz I</p>
<p>was like I want to see some influences when I&rsquo;m there I got a lot of friends I</p>
<p>got a lot of people that follow me back I have a lot of like little like online</p>
<p>friends so I was like let me go hang out with them a lot of people are in LA so</p>
<p>that excitement was like bugging me the fuck out I was like what the hell&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening right now what you already me I was like huh so the flight is booked</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to LA and I&rsquo;m going on the goddamn podcast but it doesn&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>there so I posted a gym video on my tik-tok because I post like little</p>
<p>mic&rsquo;d ups in the gym and where I just like talk shit when I&rsquo;m at the gym and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fucking fun and y&rsquo;all love it and they always like do pretty well like</p>
<p>I get like around like a million views and I posted one and I talked about my</p>
<p>rainbow sleeve hoodie that I released in the video and I was like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely nothing to be ashamed of about being gay and I want you to fucking</p>
<p>tap into my confidence every time you wear this goddamn hoodie and remember</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothing to fucking be ashamed of and I posted a tik-tok and in</p>
<p>just like a few hours it got like 2 million fucking views and so many people</p>
<p>that were watched the video bought the rainbow sleeve hoodie that I released</p>
<p>because I talked about it in the video and orders like started coming in again</p>
<p>because they had slowed down and like they started picking back up and I was</p>
<p>like what the fuck like I started gaining followers like crazy I started</p>
<p>getting sales like crazy I my fucking video blew to 2 fucking million and I</p>
<p>was just like oh my god like I&rsquo;ve never had a video hit like 2 million views in</p>
<p>like six hours before that was fucking nuts usually it takes a few days but I</p>
<p>just felt like everything was lining up and like I finally felt supported by</p>
<p>like the universe if that makes sense where I do something and then things</p>
<p>keep happening to like help it and I&rsquo;ve never experienced that before like</p>
<p>everything I&rsquo;ve experienced is like I feel prevented I feel held back I feel</p>
<p>fucked with you know I mean like comically and like universally fucked</p>
<p>with ah but I take it back because not this time so by the end of day three I</p>
<p>hit 2,300 orders 2,300 orders I thought I was gonna get 500 five zero zero max</p>
<p>in a month in three fucking days I got 2,300 bro I still can&rsquo;t believe this is</p>
<p>happening and like this happened I still feel like someone&rsquo;s gonna pinch me and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna wake up from a dream like that&rsquo;s how my life feels right now oh my</p>
<p>god so we got to go into day four because day four bitch so day three I</p>
<p>went out with my friends at night and like went to celebrate and just like</p>
<p>hung out drank I woke up a little hungover and I was like fuck so I wake</p>
<p>up on day four which was today to seeing that it sold the fuck out and not just</p>
<p>one thing everything sold out I thought I was gonna sell out of like one or two</p>
<p>things max after like a month bitch by the fourth day every single thing was</p>
<p>sold out every single design every single item sold out gone vanished I was</p>
<p>celebrating cuz I got like a thousand orders and then you&rsquo;re just gonna sell</p>
<p>me out like that oh I gotta go drink again I gotta go celebrate again so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>literally trying to take that in and then I check my phone and I get on</p>
<p>tic-tac and I check my profile and the video I posted yesterday of me at the</p>
<p>gym talking about the rainbow hoodie blew the fuck up even more and I hit a</p>
<p>million fucking followers on tik-tok a million I think I&rsquo;m at like a million</p>
<p>and like 15,000 right now I&rsquo;ve gained like 30 K in the last two days what I</p>
<p>thought I was so broken for so long I thought I was so fucked up I thought I</p>
<p>was so unlovable but a million fucking people like me enough to follow me and</p>
<p>thousands of people like me enough to buy the fucking merch I made the only</p>
<p>thing I can say for this entire past four days is it&rsquo;s the most healing</p>
<p>fucking shit I&rsquo;ve ever experienced like y&rsquo;all healed so much for me and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>put it into words I wish I could just like get a syringe and pull this feeling</p>
<p>out of me so I could inject it into you so you could just feel it I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking describe it but I literally you can&rsquo;t buy it I&rsquo;ve tried to buy</p>
<p>everything you could buy anything money could buy I&rsquo;ve tried to buy it nothing</p>
<p>makes you feel like this and I like literally am in debt to you guys for</p>
<p>the rest of my fucking life I don&rsquo;t care if I don&rsquo;t feel like this forever I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care if it wears off in two days the fact that I just got to feel like</p>
<p>this there&rsquo;s no words there&rsquo;s no words I&rsquo;m not even gonna try I&rsquo;m just gonna</p>
<p>fucking say thank you from the bottom of my heart and the bottom of little Leo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heart because you healed the fuck out of him and I feel it so it does not stop</p>
<p>there I told y&rsquo;all I was overwhelmed next guess who fucking follows me on</p>
<p>tik-tok wild guess Kehlani the artist the singer</p>
<p>on some nights like this I just wanna take you away that one I fucking scream</p>
<p>that song nights like this by Kehlani every time with my friend cat we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>literally been shitty booty ass drunk walking out of the bar and we&rsquo;re just on</p>
<p>the street fucking singing our little hearts out I sound like a fucking whale I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t sing I sound fucked up but I be singing that shit and like and literally</p>
<p>one of my favorite memories is that Okachobe music festival we&rsquo;re walking</p>
<p>back to the tent to go to bed I slept in the car but we&rsquo;re walking back to the</p>
<p>tent and me and cat just get the fucking sing in this song again and we just like</p>
<p>belted it like the whole way back and like broke Kehlani followed me on</p>
<p>zigzag what the literal me like I don&rsquo;t fangirl over nobody I told you but like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple few people I will fangirl over if she&rsquo;s one of them and</p>
<p>Lana Del Rey I&rsquo;m a faggot I&rsquo;m such a fucking faggot but like I said it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t stop there so I posted a tick-tock about me being in LA to my</p>
<p>friends only so on tick-tock only the people that I follow back can see that</p>
<p>video and I talked about being in LA and three other people asked me to be on</p>
<p>their podcast while I&rsquo;m in LA so when I originally was going to LA for Drew&rsquo;s</p>
<p>podcast now I&rsquo;m gonna be on four podcasts total as a guest and I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>like what the fuck and so many people want to hang out with me like other</p>
<p>influencers like when I hang out with me don&rsquo;t worry I&rsquo;m gonna get all the tea on</p>
<p>everybody I&rsquo;m gonna hang out with each one and fuck to find out who&rsquo;s who who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what who&rsquo;s cool who&rsquo;s not and I&rsquo;ll tell you that&rsquo;ll be our little secret but</p>
<p>that was the final kicker of the fucking day like this is today like this is still</p>
<p>today this is day four I&rsquo;m like so in shock still how can you not be all this</p>
<p>shit happening oh my god I&rsquo;m just so used to go things like going wrong I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>able to handle that but I don&rsquo;t have like the skills really to handle things</p>
<p>going right I don&rsquo;t fucking know how to do that I&rsquo;ve never had to deal with so</p>
<p>many things going right I don&rsquo;t know how to handle it but this experience really</p>
<p>made a lot of things clear for me about why I had so many bad things happen in</p>
<p>the past and why I couldn&rsquo;t manifest certain shit for so long right you know</p>
<p>I feel about that shit I wasn&rsquo;t able to handle it I wasn&rsquo;t a match to it who I</p>
<p>was would not have been able to handle the opportunities that are now in front</p>
<p>of me who I was was not good enough for this shit couldn&rsquo;t have handled it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t ready for it like everything that&rsquo;s happened shaped me into someone</p>
<p>who could handle it so now it&rsquo;s manifesting so I just want y&rsquo;all to know</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re trying to achieve something or accomplish something from</p>
<p>my new perspective of being on the other side you&rsquo;re not fucking ready for it and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not a match to it you&rsquo;re being made a match to it so if shit just seems</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s going fucking wrong it&rsquo;s not because everything that&rsquo;s happened for</p>
<p>me in my past has prepared me for what I&rsquo;m going through now and like what I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>facing now like all the opportunities and all the good like I went through all</p>
<p>the bad and sometimes you learn through contrast you experience the bad you</p>
<p>experience the unwanted so that you&rsquo;re aware of what you do want and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>capable of handling it because you&rsquo;ve been through all the bad shit and</p>
<p>everything that I&rsquo;ve tried in the past all the things that have failed I looked</p>
<p>at them like such big failures and I was so fucking heartbroken and discouraged</p>
<p>and I figured this would just be another one and it was the exact opposite but</p>
<p>now I can look back and see how all of my failures in the past were just</p>
<p>orchestrating something so much bigger like this is bigger than I ever fucking</p>
<p>tried to manifest or like believe or dream like this shit is bigger than all</p>
<p>the other things that I tried I didn&rsquo;t even realize it like I genuinely didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even fucking know at the time but nothing that I tried before failed or</p>
<p>went wrong it was a stepping stone and part of the orchestration to get me to</p>
<p>the experience I&rsquo;m having now which I couldn&rsquo;t have fucking asked for if you</p>
<p>told me it exists I didn&rsquo;t know shit like this was fucking possible dude but</p>
<p>I just want to give you that if you&rsquo;re going through shit right now you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>meant to be going through it and nothing is going wrong what&rsquo;s happening is meant</p>
<p>to be happening because it is happening and you know that and I swear to God</p>
<p>come back to this video whenever you&rsquo;re fucking going through shit and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just discouraged keep going keep recommitting it&rsquo;s all happening for you</p>
<p>and I was so resistant to believing that before but now I fucking believe it</p>
<p>because I see how everything I tried before lined up and taught me the skills</p>
<p>and taught me how to handle things and like rise to the occasion because old me</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t have handled none of this shit so many things have gone wrong with</p>
<p>dropping this clothing so much headache so much frustration so much shit that</p>
<p>old me wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to handle because I wasn&rsquo;t disciplined back then I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t able to handle the situation that I&rsquo;m having now and I&rsquo;m handling it and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing fine it is stressful sure but I&rsquo;m capable and I&rsquo;m willing and I&rsquo;m able</p>
<p>to handle it because of what I&rsquo;ve gone through if I never went through it I</p>
<p>would have gotten to this place and it would have fucking bombed just remember</p>
<p>me saying these words what&rsquo;s happening is happening for you you are being lined</p>
<p>up for something bigger I swear to fucking God as someone who&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>through the worst shit you can imagine and failed more times than you can</p>
<p>fucking think it&rsquo;s happening for you I just wish I could look back on like me a</p>
<p>year ago me a month ago and be like dude it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s okay like I know you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through fucking hell but I promise this cut like what you want is coming what</p>
<p>you want is coming times ten like just hold on keep going just keep fucking</p>
<p>going like that fucking fish Dory is that her fucking name just keep swimming</p>
<p>yeah keep doing it keep swimming I don&rsquo;t really know what this episode was</p>
<p>I wanted to share what the fuck I was going through and then say a big fat</p>
<p>ass thank you like a big fat wet thank you cuz you have no fucking idea what</p>
<p>y&rsquo;all have just done for me I don&rsquo;t even think I can fathom it yet my level of</p>
<p>gratitude right now is beyond my own comprehension my and my reality is</p>
<p>beyond my comprehension right now and I don&rsquo;t know beach I&rsquo;m just so like what</p>
<p>the fuck I&rsquo;m just so overwhelmed with so much positive and it&rsquo;s all because of</p>
<p>you guys and I would fucking suck all of you off if I could maybe not maybe just</p>
<p>like a handy or something but my final thought is I just want to tell every</p>
<p>single one of you everything is going to be okay I don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through I don&rsquo;t care how fucking dark it gets do not stop it&rsquo;s gonna be okay I</p>
<p>promise you&rsquo;re gonna be fine it&rsquo;s gonna work out just keep moving keep moving</p>
<p>keep moving keep moving if you get into a very dark spot if you stop you will</p>
<p>stay there if you keep going you will get through it from someone who&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>in the darkest fucking places you can imagine keep your depressed tired</p>
<p>hopeless ass walking there will be things that make you hopeful and there</p>
<p>will be things that line up I promise just remember me saying do not stop do</p>
<p>not stop in a place of fucking darkness keep going and I&rsquo;m gonna end the podcast</p>
