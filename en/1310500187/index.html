    <p>The following is a conversation with Po Shen Lou,</p>
<p>a professor of mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University,</p>
<p>national coach of the USA International Math Olympia team,</p>
<p>and founder of XP that does online education</p>
<p>of basic math and science.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also the founder of Novid,</p>
<p>an app that takes a really interesting approach</p>
<p>to contact tracing,</p>
<p>making sure you stay completely anonymous</p>
<p>and it gives you statistical information about COVID cases</p>
<p>in your physical network of interactions.</p>
<p>So you can maintain privacy, very important,</p>
<p>and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>In my opinion,</p>
<p>we desperately needed solutions like this in early 2020.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, I think,</p>
<p>we will again need it for the next pandemic.</p>
<p>To me, solutions that require large scale,</p>
<p>distributed coordination of human beings</p>
<p>need ideas that emphasize freedom and knowledge.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Jordan Harbinger Show, Onnit, BetterHelp,</p>
<p>Aidsleep, and Element.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that Po and I</p>
<p>filmed a few short videos</p>
<p>about simple, beautiful math concepts</p>
<p>that I will release soon.</p>
<p>It was really fun.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed Po sharing his passion for math with me</p>
<p>in those videos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to do a few more short videos</p>
<p>in the coming months that are educational in nature</p>
<p>on AI, robotics, math, science, philosophy,</p>
<p>or if all else fails,</p>
<p>just fun snippets into my life on music, books, martial arts,</p>
<p>and other random things,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s of interest to anyone at all.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s my conversation with Po Shenlow.</p>
<p>You know, you mentioned you really enjoy flying</p>
<p>and experiencing different people in different places.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about flying for me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have the same experience,</p>
<p>that every time I get on an airplane,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible to me that human beings</p>
<p>have actually been able to achieve this.</p>
<p>And when I look at like what&rsquo;s happening now</p>
<p>with humans traveling out into space,</p>
<p>I see it as all the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible that humans are able to get into a box</p>
<p>and fly in the air and safely and land</p>
<p>in the same, it seems like,</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s taking it for granted.</p>
<p>So when I observe them, it&rsquo;s quite fascinating</p>
<p>because I see that cleanly mapping to the world</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re now in rockets and traveling to the moon,</p>
<p>traveling to Mars, and at the same kind of way,</p>
<p>I can already see the future</p>
<p>where we will all take it for granted.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you have,</p>
<p>you personally, when you fly,</p>
<p>have the same kind of magical experience</p>
<p>of like how the heck did humans actually accomplish this?</p>
<p>So I do, especially when there&rsquo;s turbulence,</p>
<p>which is like on the way here, there was turbulence</p>
<p>and the plane jiggled, even the flight attendant</p>
<p>had to hold onto the side.</p>
<p>And I was just thinking to myself,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing that this happens all the time</p>
<p>and the wings don&rsquo;t fall off,</p>
<p>given how many planes are flying.</p>
<p>But then I often think about it and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>a long time ago, I think people didn&rsquo;t trust elevators</p>
<p>in a 40 story building in New York City.</p>
<p>And now we just take it completely for granted</p>
<p>that you can step into this shaft,</p>
<p>which is 40 floors up and down, and it will just not fail.</p>
<p>Yeah, again, I&rsquo;m the same way with elevators,</p>
<p>but also buildings, when I&rsquo;ll stand on the 40th floor</p>
<p>and wonder how the heck are we not falling right now?</p>
<p>Like how amazing it is with the high winds,</p>
<p>like structurally, just the earthquakes and the vibrations,</p>
<p>I mean, natural vibrations in the ground.</p>
<p>Like how is this, how are all of these,</p>
<p>you go to like New York City, all of these buildings standing.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, one of the most beautiful things,</p>
<p>actually mathematically too, is bridges.</p>
<p>I used to build bridges in high school from like toothpicks,</p>
<p>just like out of the pure joy of like physics,</p>
<p>making some structure really strong.</p>
<p>Understanding like from a civil engineering perspective,</p>
<p>what kind of structure will be stronger</p>
<p>than another kind of structure, like suspension bridges.</p>
<p>And then you see that at scale,</p>
<p>humans being able to span a body of water</p>
<p>with a giant bridge.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s so humbling.</p>
<p>It makes you realize how dependent we are on each other.</p>
<p>Sort of, I talk about love a lot,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certain element in which we little ants</p>
<p>have just a small amount of knowledge</p>
<p>about our particular thing.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re depending on a network of knowledge</p>
<p>that other experts hold.</p>
<p>And then most of our lives,</p>
<p>most of the quality of life we have</p>
<p>has to do with the richness of that network of knowledge,</p>
<p>of that collaboration,</p>
<p>and then sort of the ability to build on top of it,</p>
<p>levels of abstractions.</p>
<p>You start from like bits in a computer,</p>
<p>then you can have assembly, then you can have C++,</p>
<p>or you have an operating system,</p>
<p>then you can have C++ and Python, finally,</p>
<p>some machine learning on top.</p>
<p>All of these are abstractions.</p>
<p>And eventually we&rsquo;ll have AI that runs all of us humans.</p>
<p>But anyway, but speaking of abstractions and programming,</p>
<p>in high school, you wrote some impressive games</p>
<p>for MS DOS.</p>
<p>I got a chance to, in browser somehow,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s magic, I got a chance to play them.</p>
<p>Alien Attack 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hardest part about programming those games?</p>
<p>And maybe can you tell the story about building those games?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I actually tried to do those in high school</p>
<p>because I was just curious if I could.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good starting point for anything, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s like, could you?</p>
<p>But the appealing thing was also,</p>
<p>it was a soup to nuts kind of thing.</p>
<p>So something that has always attracted me is,</p>
<p>I like beautiful ideas, I like seeing beautiful ideas,</p>
<p>but I actually also like seeing execution of an idea</p>
<p>all the way from beginning to end in something that works.</p>
<p>So for example, in high school,</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to grow up in the late 90s</p>
<p>when even a high school student could hope</p>
<p>to make something sort of comparable</p>
<p>to the shareware games that were out there.</p>
<p>I say the word sort of, like still quite far away,</p>
<p>but at least I didn&rsquo;t need to hire a 3D CG artist.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t enough pixels to draw anyway,</p>
<p>even I can draw, right?</p>
<p>Bad art, of course.</p>
<p>But the point is, I wanted to know,</p>
<p>is it possible for me to try to do those things</p>
<p>where back in those days,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t even have an easy way</p>
<p>to draw letters on the screen in a particular font.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t just say import a font, it wasn&rsquo;t like Python.</p>
<p>So for example, back then,</p>
<p>if you played those games in the web browser,</p>
<p>which is emulating the old school computer,</p>
<p>those, even the letters you see,</p>
<p>those are made by individual calls</p>
<p>to draw pixels on the screen.</p>
<p>So you built that from scratch,</p>
<p>almost building a computer graphics library from scratch?</p>
<p>Yes, the primitive that I got to use</p>
<p>was some code I copied off of a book in assembly</p>
<p>of how to put a pixel on a screen in a particular color.</p>
<p>And the programming language was Pascal?</p>
<p>Ah, yeah, the first one was in Pascal,</p>
<p>but then the other ones were in C++ after that.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s the emulation in the browser work, by the way?</p>
<p>Is that trivial?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s pretty cool, you get to play these games</p>
<p>that have a very much 90s feeling to them.</p>
<p>Ah, so it&rsquo;s literally making an MSDOS environment,</p>
<p>which is literally running the old.exe file.</p>
<p>Wow, in the browser.</p>
<p>This is, that could be more amazing than the airplane.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t so much about the video games,</p>
<p>it was more about,</p>
<p>can you build something really cool from scratch?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you did a bunch of programming competitions.</p>
<p>What was your interest, your love for programming?</p>
<p>What did you learn through that experience?</p>
<p>Especially now that as much of your work</p>
<p>has taken a long journey through mathematics.</p>
<p>I think I always was amazed</p>
<p>by how computers could do things fast.</p>
<p>If I wanted to make it an abstract analysis</p>
<p>of why it is that I saw some power in the computer.</p>
<p>Because if the computer can do things</p>
<p>so many times faster than humans,</p>
<p>where the hard part is telling the computer</p>
<p>what to do and how to do it,</p>
<p>if you can master that asking the computer what to do,</p>
<p>then you could conceivably achieve more things.</p>
<p>And those contests I was in,</p>
<p>those were the opposite in some sense</p>
<p>of making a complete product, like a game is a product.</p>
<p>Those contests were effectively write a function</p>
<p>to do something extremely efficiently.</p>
<p>And if you are able to do that,</p>
<p>then you can unlock more of the power of the computer.</p>
<p>But also doing it quickly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a time element from the human perspective</p>
<p>to be able to program quickly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something nice.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s almost like an athletics component</p>
<p>to where you&rsquo;re almost like an athlete</p>
<p>seeking optimal performance as a human being</p>
<p>trying to write these programs.</p>
<p>And at the same time, it&rsquo;s kind of art</p>
<p>because the best way to write a program quickly</p>
<p>is to write a simple program.</p>
<p>You just have a damn good solution.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily you have to type fast.</p>
<p>You have to think through a really clean,</p>
<p>beautiful solution.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you think is the use</p>
<p>of those programming competitions?</p>
<p>Do you think they&rsquo;re ultimately something</p>
<p>you would recommend for students,</p>
<p>for people interested in programming,</p>
<p>or people interested in building stuff?</p>
<p>Yes, I think so because especially with the work</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been doing nowadays,</p>
<p>even trying to control COVID,</p>
<p>something that was very helpful from day one</p>
<p>was understanding that the kinds of computations</p>
<p>we would want to do,</p>
<p>we could conceivably do on like a four core cloud machine</p>
<p>on Amazon Web Services out to a population</p>
<p>which might have hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>or millions of people.</p>
<p>The reason why that was important</p>
<p>to have that back of the envelope calculation</p>
<p>with efficient algorithms</p>
<p>is because if we couldn&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>then we would bankrupt ourselves</p>
<p>before we could get to a big enough scale.</p>
<p>If you think about how you grow anything from small to big,</p>
<p>if in order to grow it from small to big,</p>
<p>you also already need 10,000 cloud servers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never get to big.</p>
<p>And also the nice thing about programming competitions</p>
<p>is that you actually build a thing that works.</p>
<p>So you finish it, there&rsquo;s a completion thing,</p>
<p>and you realize, I think there&rsquo;s a magic to it,</p>
<p>where you realize that it&rsquo;s not so hard</p>
<p>to build something that works.</p>
<p>To have a system that successfully takes in inputs</p>
<p>and produces outputs and solves a difficult problem,</p>
<p>and that directly transfers to building a startup essentially</p>
<p>that can help some aspect of this world</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s mostly based on software engineering.</p>
<p>Things get really tricky</p>
<p>when you have to manufacture stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people like Elon Musk are so impressive</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just software.</p>
<p>Tesla Autopilot is not just software.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you have to actually have factories</p>
<p>that build cars, and there&rsquo;s like a million components</p>
<p>involved in the machinery required</p>
<p>to assemble those cars and so on.</p>
<p>But in software, one person can change the world,</p>
<p>which is incredible.</p>
<p>But on the mathematics side,</p>
<p>what, if you look back, or maybe today,</p>
<p>what made you fall in love with mathematics?</p>
<p>For me, I think I&rsquo;ve always been very attracted</p>
<p>to challenge, as I already indicated</p>
<p>with writing the program.</p>
<p>I guess if I see something that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>or supposed to be impossible,</p>
<p>sometimes I say, maybe I want to see if I can pull that off.</p>
<p>And with the mathematics, the math competitions</p>
<p>presented problems that were hard,</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t know how to start,</p>
<p>but for which I could conceivably try to learn</p>
<p>how to solve them.</p>
<p>So, I mean, there are other things that are hard</p>
<p>called like get something to Mars, get people to Mars.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t, and I still don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that I am able to solve that problem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the math problems struck me</p>
<p>as things which are hard</p>
<p>and with significant amount of extra work,</p>
<p>I could figure it out.</p>
<p>And maybe they would actually even be useful,</p>
<p>like that mathematical skill is the core</p>
<p>of lots of other things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe you could speak to that</p>
<p>because a lot of people say that math is hard</p>
<p>as a kind of negative statement.</p>
<p>It always seemed to me a little bit like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a positive statement</p>
<p>that all things that are worth having in this world,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hard.</p>
<p>I mean, everything that people think about</p>
<p>that they would love to do, whether it&rsquo;s sports,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s art, music, and all the sciences,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be hard</p>
<p>if you want to do something special.</p>
<p>So is there something you could say to that idea</p>
<p>that math is hard?</p>
<p>Should it be made easy or should it be hard?</p>
<p>Ah, so I think maybe I want to dig in a little bit</p>
<p>onto this hard part and say,</p>
<p>I think the interesting thing about the math</p>
<p>is that you can see a question</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t know how to start doing it before.</p>
<p>And over a course of thinking about it,</p>
<p>you can come up with a way to solve it.</p>
<p>And so you can move from a state</p>
<p>of not being able to do something</p>
<p>to a state of being able to do something</p>
<p>where you help to take yourself through that</p>
<p>instead of somebody else spoon feeding you that technique.</p>
<p>So actually here, I&rsquo;m already digging into</p>
<p>maybe part of my teaching philosophy also,</p>
<p>which is that I actually don&rsquo;t want to ever</p>
<p>just tell somebody, here&rsquo;s how you do something.</p>
<p>I actually prefer to say, here&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t quite know how to do it.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually explaining another way</p>
<p>that you could try to do teaching.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m contrasting this to a method of watch me do this,</p>
<p>now practice it 20 times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to say a lot of people consider math to be hard</p>
<p>because maybe they can&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>all of the methods that were taught.</p>
<p>But for me, I look at the hardness</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think of it as a memory hardness.</p>
<p>I think of it as a, can you invent something hardness?</p>
<p>And I think that if we can teach more people</p>
<p>how to do that art of invention in a pure cognitive way,</p>
<p>not as hard as the actual hardware stuff, right?</p>
<p>But like in terms of the concepts</p>
<p>and the thoughts and the mathematics,</p>
<p>teaching people how to invent,</p>
<p>then suddenly actually they might not even find math</p>
<p>to be that tiresomeness hard anymore,</p>
<p>but that rewardingness hard of I have the capability</p>
<p>of looking at something which I don&rsquo;t know what to do</p>
<p>and coming up with how to do it.</p>
<p>I actually think we should be doing that,</p>
<p>giving people that capability.</p>
<p>So hard in the same way that invention is hard,</p>
<p>that is ultimately rewarding.</p>
<p>So maybe you can dig in that a little bit longer,</p>
<p>which is do you see basically the way to teach math</p>
<p>is to present a problem and to give a person a chance</p>
<p>to try to invent a solution</p>
<p>with minimal amount of information first?</p>
<p>Is that basically,</p>
<p>how do you build that muscle of invention in a student?</p>
<p>Yes, so the way that,</p>
<p>I guess I have two different sort of ways</p>
<p>that I try to teach.</p>
<p>Actually, one of them is, in fact, this semester,</p>
<p>because all my classes were remotely delivered,</p>
<p>I even threw them all onto my YouTube channel.</p>
<p>So you can see how I teach at Carnegie Mellon,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d often say, hey, everyone, let&rsquo;s try to do this.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>And that actually changes my role as a professor</p>
<p>from a person who shows up for class</p>
<p>with a script of what I wanna talk through.</p>
<p>I actually, I don&rsquo;t have a script.</p>
<p>The way I show up for classes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that we want to learn how to do,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna do it by improv.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the same method as improv comedy,</p>
<p>which is where you tell me some ideas,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll try to yes and them.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And then together,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna come up with a proof of this concept</p>
<p>where you were deeply involved in creating the proof.</p>
<p>Actually, every time I teach the class,</p>
<p>we do every proof slightly differently</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s based on how the students came up with it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I do it when I&rsquo;m in person.</p>
<p>I also have another line of courses that we make</p>
<p>that is delivered online.</p>
<p>Those things are where I can&rsquo;t do it live,</p>
<p>but the teaching method became also similar.</p>
<p>It was just, here&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s out of reach.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you think about it?</p>
<p>And then automatic hints.</p>
<p>We feed automatically hints through the internet</p>
<p>to go and let the person try to invent.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like a more rigorous prodding of invention.</p>
<p>But you did mention disease and COVID,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been doing some very interesting stuff</p>
<p>from a mathematical, but also software engineering angle</p>
<p>of coming up with ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back to the, I see a problem.</p>
<p>I think I can help.</p>
<p>So you stepped into this world.</p>
<p>Can you tell me about your work there</p>
<p>under the flag of Novid</p>
<p>and both the software and the technical details</p>
<p>of how the thing works?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>So first I want to make sure that I say,</p>
<p>this is actually team effort.</p>
<p>I happen to be the one speaking,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no way this would exist</p>
<p>without an incredible team of people</p>
<p>who inspire me every day to work on this.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll speak on behalf of them.</p>
<p>So the idea was indeed that we stepped forward</p>
<p>in March of last year, when the world started to become,</p>
<p>our part of the world started to become,</p>
<p>our part meaning the United States</p>
<p>started to become paralyzed by COVID.</p>
<p>The shutdown started to happen.</p>
<p>And at that time it started as a figment of an idea,</p>
<p>which was network theory,</p>
<p>which is the area of math that I work in,</p>
<p>could potentially be combined with smartphones</p>
<p>and some kind of health information anonymized.</p>
<p>Exactly how?</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>We tried to crystallize it.</p>
<p>And many months into this work,</p>
<p>we ended up accidentally discovering a new way</p>
<p>to control diseases,</p>
<p>which is now what is the main impetus of all of this work</p>
<p>is to take this idea and polish it</p>
<p>and hopefully have it be useful not only now,</p>
<p>but for future pandemics.</p>
<p>The idea is really simple to describe.</p>
<p>Actually, my main thing in the world</p>
<p>is I come up with obvious observations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that, so I&rsquo;ll explain it now.</p>
<p>Einstein did the same thing</p>
<p>and he wrote a few short papers.</p>
<p>But so the idea is like this.</p>
<p>If we describe how usually people control disease</p>
<p>for a lot of history,</p>
<p>it was that you&rsquo;d find out who was sick,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d find out who they&rsquo;ve been around</p>
<p>and you try to remove all of those people from society</p>
<p>against their will.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>The against their will part</p>
<p>gives you the wrong kind of a feedback loop,</p>
<p>which makes it hard to control the disease</p>
<p>because then the people you&rsquo;re trying to control</p>
<p>keep getting other people sick.</p>
<p>You can see already how I&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>and talking about this feedback loops.</p>
<p>This is actually related to something you said earlier</p>
<p>about even like how skyscrapers stay in the air.</p>
<p>The whole point is control theory.</p>
<p>You actually want to, or even how an airplane stays,</p>
<p>you need to have control loops</p>
<p>which are feedbacking in the right way.</p>
<p>And what we observed was that the feedback control loop</p>
<p>for controlling disease by asking people</p>
<p>to be removed from society against their will</p>
<p>was not working.</p>
<p>It was running against human incentives</p>
<p>and you suddenly are trying to control</p>
<p>seven billion, eight billion people</p>
<p>in ways that they don&rsquo;t individually want</p>
<p>to necessarily do.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>And this is inspired by the fact</p>
<p>that at the core of our team</p>
<p>were user experience designers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually, in fact, the first thing I knew</p>
<p>we needed when we started</p>
<p>was to bring user experience at the core.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But so the idea was suppose hypothetically</p>
<p>there was a pandemic.</p>
<p>What would you want?</p>
<p>You would want a way to be able to live your life</p>
<p>as much as possible and avoid getting sick.</p>
<p>Can we make an app to help you avoid getting sick?</p>
<p>Notice how I&rsquo;ve just articulated the problem.</p>
<p>It is not, can we make an app</p>
<p>so that after you are around somebody who&rsquo;s sick</p>
<p>you can be removed from society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s can we make an app so that you can avoid getting sick.</p>
<p>That would run a positive feed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I want to call it positive or negative</p>
<p>but it would run a good feedback loop.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then how would you do this?</p>
<p>The only problem is that you don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s sick</p>
<p>because especially with this disease</p>
<p>if I see somebody who looks perfectly healthy</p>
<p>the disease spreads two days before you have any symptoms.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s actually not possible.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the network theory comes in.</p>
<p>You caught it from someone.</p>
<p>What if we changed the paradigm</p>
<p>and we said, whenever there&rsquo;s a sickness</p>
<p>tell everybody how many physical relationships</p>
<p>separate them from the sickness.</p>
<p>That is the trivial idea we added.</p>
<p>The trivial idea was the distance between you and a disease</p>
<p>is not measured in feet or seconds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s measured in terms of how many</p>
<p>close physical relationships separate you</p>
<p>like these six degrees of separation like LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Simple idea.</p>
<p>What if we told everyone that?</p>
<p>It turns out that actually unlocks</p>
<p>some interesting behavioral feedback loops</p>
<p>which for example, let me now jump to a non COVID example</p>
<p>to show why this maybe could be useful.</p>
<p>Actually we think it could be quite useful.</p>
<p>Imagine there was Ebola or some hemorrhagic fever.</p>
<p>Imagine it spread through contact through the air.</p>
<p>In fact, pretend, pretend.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a disastrous disease.</p>
<p>It has high fatality rate.</p>
<p>And as you die, you&rsquo;re bleeding out of every orifice.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, not pleasant.</p>
<p>Not pleasant.</p>
<p>So the question is, suppose that such a disease broke</p>
<p>who would want to install an app that would tell them</p>
<p>how many relationships away from them</p>
<p>this disease had struck?</p>
<p>Like a lot of people.</p>
<p>A lot of people.</p>
<p>In fact, almost, I don&rsquo;t want to say almost everyone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very strong statement</p>
<p>but a very large number of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating framing.</p>
<p>Like the more deadly and transmissible the disease</p>
<p>the stronger the incentive to install it in a positive sense</p>
<p>the, in the good feedback loop sense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really good example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good way to frame it.</p>
<p>Cause with COVID, it was not as deadly</p>
<p>as potential pandemics could have been</p>
<p>viruses could have been.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sometimes muddled with how we think about it</p>
<p>but yeah, this is a really good framing.</p>
<p>If the virus was a lot more deadly</p>
<p>you want to create a system that has a set of incentives</p>
<p>that it quickly spreads to the population</p>
<p>where everybody is using it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s contributing in a positive way to the system.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And actually that point you just made</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take credit for that observation.</p>
<p>There was another person I talked to</p>
<p>who pointed out that it&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>that this feedback loop is even more effective</p>
<p>when the disease is worse.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually not a bad characteristic to have</p>
<p>in your feedback loop</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to help civilization keep running.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a really, it&rsquo;s in this dynamic</p>
<p>like people figure out, they dynamically figure out</p>
<p>how bad the disease is.</p>
<p>The more it spreads and the deadlier it is</p>
<p>as the people observe it</p>
<p>as long as the spread of information</p>
<p>like semantic information, natural language information</p>
<p>is closely aligned with the reality of the disease</p>
<p>which is a whole nother conversation, right?</p>
<p>We, that&rsquo;s, we might, maybe we&rsquo;ll chat about that</p>
<p>how we sort of make sure there&rsquo;s not misinformation</p>
<p>while there&rsquo;s accurate information</p>
<p>but that aside, okay, so this is a really nice property.</p>
<p>Right, and just going on on that</p>
<p>actually just talking more about what that could do</p>
<p>and why we&rsquo;re so excited about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that not only would people want to install it</p>
<p>but what would they do if you start to see</p>
<p>that this disease is getting closer and closer?</p>
<p>We surveyed informally people</p>
<p>but they said, as we saw it getting closer, we would hide.</p>
<p>We would try to not have contacts.</p>
<p>But now you notice what this has just achieved.</p>
<p>The whole goal on this whole exercise was</p>
<p>you got the people who might be sick</p>
<p>and you got everyone else, set A and set B.</p>
<p>Set A is the people who might be sick,</p>
<p>set B is everyone else.</p>
<p>And for the entirety of the past</p>
<p>contact tracing approaches, you tried to get set A</p>
<p>to do things that might not be to their liking or their will</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s removing them from society.</p>
<p>We found out that there&rsquo;s two ways</p>
<p>to separate set A from set B.</p>
<p>You can also let the people at set B</p>
<p>at the fringe of set A</p>
<p>attempt to remove themselves from this interface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the symmetry of A and B separation.</p>
<p>Everyone was looking at A, we look at B</p>
<p>and suddenly B is in their incentive to do so.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a virus that jumps from human to human.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a network sometimes called graph</p>
<p>of the spread of a virus.</p>
<p>It hops from person to person to person to person.</p>
<p>And each one of us individuals are sitting</p>
<p>or plopped into that network.</p>
<p>We have close friends and relations and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating</p>
<p>to actually think about this network</p>
<p>and we can maybe talk about the shapes</p>
<p>of this kind of network.</p>
<p>Because I was trying to think exactly this,</p>
<p>like how many people do I,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m kind of an introvert, not kind of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much an introvert.</p>
<p>But so can I be explicit about the kind of people</p>
<p>I meet in regular life?</p>
<p>Say when it was completely opened up, there&rsquo;s no pandemic.</p>
<p>There is a kind of network and there&rsquo;s maybe</p>
<p>in the graph theoretic sense, there&rsquo;s some weights</p>
<p>or something about how close that relationship is</p>
<p>in terms of the frequency of visits,</p>
<p>the duration of visits and all of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying we might want to be,</p>
<p>to create on top of that network,</p>
<p>a spread of information to let you know</p>
<p>as the virus travels through this network,</p>
<p>how close is it getting to you?</p>
<p>And the number of hops away it is on that network</p>
<p>is really powerful information</p>
<p>that creates a positive feedback loop</p>
<p>where you can act essentially anonymously</p>
<p>and on your own.</p>
<p>Like nobody&rsquo;s telling you what to do,</p>
<p>which is really important, is decentralized</p>
<p>and not whatever the opposite of authoritarian is.</p>
<p>But you get to sort of the American way.</p>
<p>You get to choose to do it yourself.</p>
<p>You have the freedom to do it yourself</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re incentivized to do it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re most likely going to do it</p>
<p>to protect yourself against you getting the disease</p>
<p>as the closer it gets to you</p>
<p>based on the information that you have.</p>
<p>But can you maybe elaborate, first of all, brilliant.</p>
<p>Whenever I saw the thing you&rsquo;re working on,</p>
<p>so forget for COVID, this is of course,</p>
<p>really relevant for COVID, but it&rsquo;s also probably relevant</p>
<p>for future diseases as well.</p>
<p>So that was the thing I&rsquo;m nervous about.</p>
<p>I was like, if this whole,</p>
<p>if our society shut down because of COVID,</p>
<p>like what the heck is gonna happen</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a much deadlier disease?</p>
<p>Like this, this is disappointing.</p>
<p>The whole time, 2020, the whole time</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just sitting like this,</p>
<p>like is the incompetence of everybody</p>
<p>except the people developing vaccines.</p>
<p>The biologists are the only ones</p>
<p>that got their stuff together.</p>
<p>But in terms of institutions and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just been terrible.</p>
<p>But this is exactly the power of information</p>
<p>and the power of information</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t limit personal freedom.</p>
<p>So your idea is brilliant.</p>
<p>Okay, mathematically, can you maybe elaborate</p>
<p>what are we talking about?</p>
<p>Like how do you actually make that work?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s involved?</p>
<p>Sure, first I&rsquo;m gonna reply to something you said</p>
<p>about the freedom inside this,</p>
<p>because actually that was the idea.</p>
<p>The idea is this is game theory, right?</p>
<p>And effectively what we did is analogous</p>
<p>to free market economy, as opposed to central planning.</p>
<p>If you just line up the set of incentives correctly</p>
<p>so that people have in their purely selfish behavior</p>
<p>are contributing to the optimization of the global function,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And the point of what we do, I guess in mathematics</p>
<p>is we try to explore the search space</p>
<p>to go and find out as many possibilities as there are.</p>
<p>And in this case, it&rsquo;s an applied search space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the inputs from design,</p>
<p>user experience design and actual people are important.</p>
<p>But you asked about, I guess, the mathematical</p>
<p>or the technical things underpinning it.</p>
<p>So I think the first thing I&rsquo;ll say is</p>
<p>we wanted to make this thing</p>
<p>not require your personal information.</p>
<p>And so in order to do that,</p>
<p>what gave me the confidence to, I guess,</p>
<p>lead our team to run at the beginning</p>
<p>is we saw that this could be done without using GPS information.</p>
<p>So technically what&rsquo;s going on is if two smartphones,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a smartphone app.</p>
<p>If two smartphones have this thing installed,</p>
<p>they just communicate with each other by Bluetooth</p>
<p>to go and find out how far,</p>
<p>they can detect nearby things by Bluetooth.</p>
<p>And then they can find out that these two phones</p>
<p>were approximately such and such distance apart.</p>
<p>And that kind of relative proximity information</p>
<p>is enough to construct this big network.</p>
<p>Okay, so the physical network is constructed</p>
<p>based on proximity that&rsquo;s through Bluetooth</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to specify your exact location,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the proximity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not using the Pythagorean theorem basically.</p>
<p>I mean, if I just knew the GPS coordinates,</p>
<p>we could use the Pythagorean theorem too.</p>
<p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s just how I call it.</p>
<p>Distance formula, whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re not doing</p>
<p>the old Pythagorean based violation of privacy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But so is that enough to form,</p>
<p>to give you enough information about physical connection</p>
<p>to another human being?</p>
<p>Is there a time element there?</p>
<p>Is there, so, okay.</p>
<p>That sounds like a really strong, like low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>Like if you have that,</p>
<p>you could probably go really, really far.</p>
<p>My natural question is,</p>
<p>is there extra information you can add on top of that?</p>
<p>Like the duration of the physical proximity?</p>
<p>So first of all, we actually do estimate the duration,</p>
<p>but the way we estimate the duration</p>
<p>is like how a movie is filmed,</p>
<p>in the sense that every so often, every few minutes,</p>
<p>we check what&rsquo;s nearby.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like how a movie is filmed.</p>
<p>You take lots of snapshots.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no way in a battery efficient way</p>
<p>to really keep track of that proximity.</p>
<p>However, fortunately, we&rsquo;re using probability.</p>
<p>The fact is the paradigm that we&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not super important</p>
<p>if you run into that person only for 10 minutes</p>
<p>at the grocery store.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s a stranger that you run into 10 minutes</p>
<p>in this grocery store,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna be relevant for our paradigm</p>
<p>because our paradigm is not telling you</p>
<p>who were you around before</p>
<p>and might therefore have gotten infected by already.</p>
<p>Ours is about predicting the future.</p>
<p>We change from, I mean, the standard paradigm was</p>
<p>what already happened, quick damage control.</p>
<p>Ours is predict the future.</p>
<p>If you run into that person once in the grocery store today</p>
<p>and never see them again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s irrelevant for predicting the future.</p>
<p>And therefore, for ours, what really matters</p>
<p>is the many hours around the other person,</p>
<p>at which point, if you&rsquo;re scanning every five</p>
<p>to eight minutes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to come out in the problem,</p>
<p>like statistically speaking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to come out as a strong relationship</p>
<p>and a person in the grocery store is going to wash out</p>
<p>is not an important physical relationship.</p>
<p>I mean, this is brilliant.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to make work?</p>
<p>So you said, one, there&rsquo;s a mathematical component</p>
<p>that we just kind of talked about,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the user experience component.</p>
<p>So how difficult does it to go,</p>
<p>just like you built the video game, Alien Attack,</p>
<p>from zero to completion, what&rsquo;s involved?</p>
<p>How difficult is it?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to answer that question</p>
<p>in terms of building the product,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;m also going to acknowledge</p>
<p>that just having an app doesn&rsquo;t make it useful</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s actually maybe the easy part.</p>
<p>If you know what I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like all of this stuff</p>
<p>about rollout adoption and awareness,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s focus on the app part first.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s again, why I said the team is incredible.</p>
<p>So we have a bunch of people who,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say that the technology that we use to make it</p>
<p>is not the standard way you make an app.</p>
<p>If you think about a standard iOS app or Android app,</p>
<p>those are a user interface that contacts a web server</p>
<p>and sends some information back and forth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing some stuff that has to hook</p>
<p>into the operating system of saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go use Bluetooth for something</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t really meant for, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that part.</p>
<p>By the way, what is the app called?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s called Novid, COVID with an N.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>So you have to hook into Bluetooth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying you have to do that beyond the permissions</p>
<p>that are like at the very surface level</p>
<p>provided on the phone?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t want to call them permissions.</p>
<p>I just want to say,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what you usually do with Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Usually with Bluetooth, you say,</p>
<p>do I have headphones nearby?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go and say, do I have headphones nearby?</p>
<p>Or do I have another phone nearby, which is doing something?</p>
<p>And then keep asking that same question.</p>
<p>Keep asking the question.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually not easy.</p>
<p>And I mean, there were some parts of it,</p>
<p>which actually a lot of people had tried unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s known that, for example,</p>
<p>the UK was trying to do something similar.</p>
<p>And the problem they ran into was,</p>
<p>when you program things on iOS,</p>
<p>iOS is very good at making it hard</p>
<p>to do things in the background.</p>
<p>And so there was quite a lot of effort required</p>
<p>to go and make this thing work.</p>
<p>So the whole point, this thing would run in the background</p>
<p>and iOS, I mean, most Android probably as well, right?</p>
<p>But yeah, iOS certainly makes it difficult</p>
<p>for something to run in the background,</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s eating up your battery, right?</p>
<p>Well, we wanted to make sure we didn&rsquo;t eat up the battery.</p>
<p>So that one we can,</p>
<p>we actually are very proud of the fact</p>
<p>that ours uses very little battery.</p>
<p>Actually, even if compared to Apple&rsquo;s own system, so.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>So what else is required to make this thing work?</p>
<p>Right, so the key was that you had to do</p>
<p>a significant amount of work on the actual</p>
<p>mobile app development,</p>
<p>which fortunately the team that we brought</p>
<p>was this kind of general thinkers</p>
<p>where we would dig in deep into the operating system</p>
<p>documentation and the API libraries.</p>
<p>So we got that working.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another angle, which is,</p>
<p>you also need the servers to be able to compute fast enough,</p>
<p>which is tying back to this old school</p>
<p>computer programming competitions and math Olympiads.</p>
<p>In fact, our team that was working on the algorithm</p>
<p>and backend side included several people</p>
<p>who had been in these competitions from before,</p>
<p>which I happen to know because I do coach the team</p>
<p>for the math.</p>
<p>And so we were able to bring people in to build servers,</p>
<p>a server infrastructure in C++ actually,</p>
<p>so that we could support significant numbers of people</p>
<p>without needing tons of servers.</p>
<p>Is there some distributed algorithms working here</p>
<p>or you basically have to keep in the same place</p>
<p>the entire graph as it builds?</p>
<p>Cause especially the more and more people use it,</p>
<p>the bigger, the bigger the graph gets.</p>
<p>I mean, this is very difficult scaling problem, right?</p>
<p>Ah, so that&rsquo;s actually why this computer algorithm</p>
<p>competition stuff was handy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because there are only about seven to eight</p>
<p>giga people in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not that many.</p>
<p>So if you can make your algorithms linear time</p>
<p>or almost linear time, a computer operates in gigahertz.</p>
<p>I only need to do one run, one recalculation every hour</p>
<p>in terms of telling people how far away these dangers are.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I suddenly have 3,600 seconds</p>
<p>and my CPU cores are running in gigahertz.</p>
<p>And at most they&rsquo;re eight giga people.</p>
<p>Well, you skipping over the fact that there&rsquo;s N squared</p>
<p>potential connections between people.</p>
<p>So how do you get around the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>that we, you know, the potential set of relationship</p>
<p>any one of us could have is a billion.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a billion times squared.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the potential amount of data you have to be storing</p>
<p>and computing over and constantly updating.</p>
<p>So the way we dealt with that is we actually expect</p>
<p>that the typical network is very sparse.</p>
<p>The technical term sparse would mean that the average degree</p>
<p>or the average number of connections that a person has</p>
<p>is going to be at most like a hundred strong connections</p>
<p>that you care about.</p>
<p>If you think of it almost in terms of the heavy hitters,</p>
<p>actually in most people&rsquo;s lives,</p>
<p>a hundred, if we just kept track</p>
<p>of their top hundred interactions,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably most of the signal.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saddened to think that I might not be even</p>
<p>in a double digits, but.</p>
<p>Oh, I was intentionally giving a crazy number</p>
<p>to account for college students.</p>
<p>You call, oh, those are the,</p>
<p>who you call on the heavy hitters,</p>
<p>the people who are like the social butterflies.</p>
<p>Yeah, I need to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to know that information about myself,</p>
<p>by the way, that, do you expose the graph,</p>
<p>like how many, like about yourself,</p>
<p>how many connections you have?</p>
<p>We do expose to each person</p>
<p>how many direct connections they have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But for privacy purposes,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t tell anybody who their connections,</p>
<p>like how their connections are interconnected.</p>
<p>Yes, gotcha.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we do expose also to everyone</p>
<p>an interesting chart that says,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s how many people you have</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re connected to directly.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how many at distance two,</p>
<p>meaning via people.</p>
<p>And then here&rsquo;s how many at distance three.</p>
<p>And the reason we do that,</p>
<p>is that actually ends up being a dynamic</p>
<p>that also boosts adoption.</p>
<p>It drives another feedback loop.</p>
<p>The reason is because we saw, actually,</p>
<p>when we deployed this in some universities,</p>
<p>that when people see on their app</p>
<p>that they are indirectly connected to hundreds</p>
<p>or thousands of other people,</p>
<p>they get excited and they tell other people,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s download this app.</p>
<p>But you know, we also saw in those examples,</p>
<p>especially looking at the screenshots people gave,</p>
<p>that is hit as soon as the typical person</p>
<p>has two or three other direct connections on the system.</p>
<p>Because that means that our app</p>
<p>has reached a virality or not of two to three.</p>
<p>The key is we were making a viral app to fight a virus</p>
<p>spreading on the same network that the virus spreads on.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to out virus the virus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>What have you learned from this whole experience</p>
<p>in terms of, let&rsquo;s say for COVID,</p>
<p>but for future pandemics as well,</p>
<p>is it possible to use the power information here</p>
<p>of networked information as a virus spreads and travels</p>
<p>in order to basically keep the society open?</p>
<p>Is it possible for people to protect themselves</p>
<p>with this information?</p>
<p>Or do you still have to have most,</p>
<p>like in this overarching policy</p>
<p>of everybody should stay at home, that kind of thing?</p>
<p>We are trying to answer that question right now.</p>
<p>So the answer is we don&rsquo;t know yet,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually why we&rsquo;re very happy</p>
<p>that now the idea has started to become more widely known.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re already starting to collaborate</p>
<p>with epidemiologists.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m just a mathematician, right?</p>
<p>And a mathematician should not be the person</p>
<p>who is telling everybody, this will definitely work.</p>
<p>But because of the potential power of this approach,</p>
<p>especially the potential power</p>
<p>of this being an end game for COVID,</p>
<p>we have gotten the interest of real researchers.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now working together</p>
<p>to try to actually understand the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Because you see, there&rsquo;s a theory.</p>
<p>So what I can share is the mathematics of,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s some hope that this would work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m talking about end game now.</p>
<p>End game means you have very few cases.</p>
<p>But everywhere, we&rsquo;re always thinking,</p>
<p>once there&rsquo;s few cases, then does that mean we now open up?</p>
<p>Once you open up in the past, then the cases go up again</p>
<p>until you have to lock down again.</p>
<p>And now when we talk about the dynamic process that makes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s guaranteeing you always have cases</p>
<p>until you have the great vaccines,</p>
<p>which is, we both got vaccinated, this is good.</p>
<p>But at the same time, why I&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>this is still important is because we know</p>
<p>that many vaccine makers have said</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re preparing for the next dose next year.</p>
<p>And if we have a perpetual thing</p>
<p>where you just always need a new vaccine every year,</p>
<p>it could actually be beneficial to make sure</p>
<p>we have as many other techniques as possible</p>
<p>for parts of the world that can&rsquo;t afford,</p>
<p>for example, that kind of distribution.</p>
<p>Yeah, so actually, no matter how deadly the virus is,</p>
<p>no matter how many things,</p>
<p>whether you have a vaccine or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still useful to be having this information.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Because to stay home or not, depending on how risk,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan, just like you said, of having the freedom</p>
<p>for you to decide how risk averse you wanna be, right?</p>
<p>Depending on your own conditions,</p>
<p>but also on the state of like what you,</p>
<p>just how dangerously you like to live.</p>
<p>So I think that actually makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And I also think that since we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>when you think of disease spreading,</p>
<p>it spreads in aggregate in the sense that</p>
<p>if there are some people who maybe are more risk tolerant</p>
<p>because of other things in their life,</p>
<p>well, there might also be other people</p>
<p>who are less risk tolerance.</p>
<p>And then those people decide to isolate.</p>
<p>But what matters is in the aggregate</p>
<p>that this R naught of the infection spreading</p>
<p>drops below one.</p>
<p>And so the key is if you can empower people</p>
<p>with that power to make that decision,</p>
<p>you might actually still be able to drive</p>
<p>that R naught down below one.</p>
<p>Yeah, and also, this is me talking,</p>
<p>people get a little bit nervous, I think,</p>
<p>with information somehow mapping to privacy violation.</p>
<p>But first of all, in the approach you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s respecting anonymity.</p>
<p>But I would love to have information</p>
<p>from the very beginning, from March and April of last year,</p>
<p>almost like a map of like where it&rsquo;s risky</p>
<p>and where it&rsquo;s not to go.</p>
<p>And not map based on sort of the exact location of people,</p>
<p>but where people usually hang out kind of thing.</p>
<p>Just, and maybe not necessarily about actual location,</p>
<p>but just maybe activities,</p>
<p>like just to have information about what is good to do</p>
<p>and not, in terms of like safety,</p>
<p>is it okay to run outside and not,</p>
<p>is it okay to go to a restaurant and not,</p>
<p>I just feel like we&rsquo;re operating in the blind.</p>
<p>And then what you had is a very imperfect signal,</p>
<p>which is like basically politicians desperately trying</p>
<p>to make statements about what is safe and not.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what the heck they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of smart scientists telling them stuff.</p>
<p>And the scientists themselves also, very important,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t always know what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Epidemiology is not, is as much an art as a science.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re desperately trying to predict the future,</p>
<p>which nobody can do.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re trying to speak with some level of authority.</p>
<p>I mean, if I were to criticize scientists,</p>
<p>they spoke with too much authority.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to say, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But then they think like, if I say, I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s going to be a distrust.</p>
<p>What they realize is when you&rsquo;re wrong and you say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, it&rsquo;s going to lead to more distrust.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this imperfect, like just chaotic,</p>
<p>messy system of people trying to figure out</p>
<p>with very little information.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re proposing is just a huge amount</p>
<p>of information, and information is power.</p>
<p>Is there challenges with adoption that you see</p>
<p>in the future here?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, maybe we could speak to,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s approaches, I guess, from Google.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different people that have tried</p>
<p>similar kind of ideas.</p>
<p>Not, you have quite a novel idea, actually.</p>
<p>But speaking, the umbrella idea of contact tracing,</p>
<p>is there something you can comment about</p>
<p>why their approaches haven&rsquo;t been fully adopted?</p>
<p>Is there challenges there?</p>
<p>Is there reasons why Novid might be a better idea</p>
<p>moving forward, in general, just about adoption?</p>
<p>Yeah, so first of all, I want to say,</p>
<p>I always have respect for the methods that other people use.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s good to see the other people I&rsquo;ve been trying.</p>
<p>But what we have noticed is that the difference</p>
<p>between our value proposition to the user</p>
<p>and the value proposition to the user delivered</p>
<p>by everything that was made before is that,</p>
<p>unfortunately, the action of installing</p>
<p>a standard contact tracing app will then tell you</p>
<p>after you have already been exposed to the disease</p>
<p>so that you can protect other people from you.</p>
<p>And what that does to your own direct probability</p>
<p>of getting sick, if you think about it,</p>
<p>suppose you were making the decision,</p>
<p>should I or should I not install one of those apps?</p>
<p>What does that do to your own probability of getting sick?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s close to zero.</p>
<p>This is the sad thing you&rsquo;re speaking to, not sad.</p>
<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s the way the world is.</p>
<p>The only incentive there is to just help other people,</p>
<p>I suppose, but a much stronger incentive</p>
<p>is anything that allows you to help yourself.</p>
<p>Yes, so what I&rsquo;m saying is that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say free market capitalism</p>
<p>was not based on altruism, I think it&rsquo;s based on,</p>
<p>if you make a system of incentives</p>
<p>so that everybody trying to maximize their own situation</p>
<p>somehow contributes to the whole,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a game theoretic solution to a very hard problem.</p>
<p>And so this is actually basically mechanism design,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve basically come up with a different mechanism,</p>
<p>different set of incentives,</p>
<p>which incentivizes the adoption,</p>
<p>because actually whenever we&rsquo;ve been rolling it out,</p>
<p>usually the first question we ask people,</p>
<p>like say in a university is,</p>
<p>do you know what Novid does?</p>
<p>And most of them have read about the other apps</p>
<p>and they say, Oh, Novid will tell you</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;ve been around someone so you can quarantine.</p>
<p>And we have to explain to them,</p>
<p>actually, Novid never wants to ask you to quarantine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the principle.</p>
<p>Our principle isn&rsquo;t based on that at all.</p>
<p>We just want to let you know if something is coming close</p>
<p>so that you can protect yourself.</p>
<p>If you want.</p>
<p>If you want, if you want, if you want.</p>
<p>And then the quarantine is like, yes,</p>
<p>in that case, if you&rsquo;re quarantining,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re shutting the door from the inside,</p>
<p>if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, this is brilliant.</p>
<p>So what do you think the future looks like</p>
<p>for future pandemics?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your plan with Novid?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your plan with these set of ideas?</p>
<p>I am actually still an academic and a researcher.</p>
<p>So the biggest work I&rsquo;m working on right now</p>
<p>is to try to build as many collaborations</p>
<p>with other public health researchers at other universities</p>
<p>to actually work on pilot deployments together</p>
<p>in various places.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually ongoing work right now.</p>
<p>And so, for example, if anyone&rsquo;s watching this</p>
<p>and you happen to be a public health researcher</p>
<p>and you want to be involved in something like this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna say, I&rsquo;m still incentive thinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in it for the researchers too.</p>
<p>This could open up an entire new way</p>
<p>of controlling disease.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>I mean, it might actually be true.</p>
<p>And people who are involved in figuring out</p>
<p>how to make this work,</p>
<p>well, it could actually be good for their careers too.</p>
<p>I always have to think like,</p>
<p>if a researcher was getting involved,</p>
<p>what are they getting out of it?</p>
<p>Oh, so you mean like from a research perspective,</p>
<p>you can like publications and sets of ideas</p>
<p>about how to, from a sort of network theory perspective,</p>
<p>understand how we control the spread of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Yes, and what I&rsquo;m doing right now</p>
<p>is this is basically interdisciplinary research</p>
<p>where maybe our side is bringing the technology</p>
<p>and the network theory,</p>
<p>and the missing parts are epidemiology</p>
<p>and public health expertise.</p>
<p>And if the two things start to join,</p>
<p>also because everywhere that you deploy,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say that the world is different</p>
<p>in the Philippines as it is in the United States.</p>
<p>And just the natures of the locality</p>
<p>would mean that someone like me</p>
<p>should not be trying to figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>But if we can work with the researchers</p>
<p>who are based there,</p>
<p>now suddenly we might come up with a solution</p>
<p>that will help scale in parts of the world</p>
<p>where they aren&rsquo;t all getting the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines</p>
<p>which cost like $20 a pop in the US.</p>
<p>So if they want to participate,</p>
<p>who do they reach out to?</p>
<p>Oh, that would just be us.</p>
<p>I mean, the novid.org website has&hellip;</p>
<p>Novid.org.</p>
<p>It has a feedback reach out form.</p>
<p>And actually we are, I mean, again,</p>
<p>this is the DNA of being a researcher.</p>
<p>I am actually very excited by the idea</p>
<p>that this could contribute knowledge</p>
<p>that will outlast all of our generations,</p>
<p>like all of our lifetimes.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Reach out to novid.org.</p>
<p>What about individual people?</p>
<p>Should they install the app and try it out?</p>
<p>Or is this really geographically restricted?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I didn&rsquo;t come on here to tell everyone</p>
<p>to install the app.</p>
<p>I did not come to tell everyone to install the app</p>
<p>because it works best</p>
<p>if your local health authority is working with us.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because, this is back to the game theory.</p>
<p>If anyone could just say, I&rsquo;m positive,</p>
<p>the high school senior prank would be to say that</p>
<p>we have a massive outbreak on finals week.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not have final exams.</p>
<p>So the way that our system works,</p>
<p>it actually borrows some ideas, not borrows,</p>
<p>we came up with them independently.</p>
<p>But this idea is similar to what Google and Apple do,</p>
<p>which is that if the local health authority</p>
<p>is working with this, they can,</p>
<p>for everyone who&rsquo;s positive,</p>
<p>give them a passcode that expires in a short time.</p>
<p>So for ours, if you&rsquo;re on the app and saying, I&rsquo;m positive,</p>
<p>you can either just say that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s called unverified,</p>
<p>or you can enter in one of these codes</p>
<p>that you got from the local health authority.</p>
<p>So basically, for anyone who&rsquo;s watching this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that you should just go and download it</p>
<p>unless you want to go and look at it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>But if you, on the other hand,</p>
<p>if you happen to know anyone at the local health authority,</p>
<p>which is trying to figure out how to handle COVID,</p>
<p>well then, I mean, we&rsquo;d be very happy</p>
<p>to also work with you.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>So the verified there is really important</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re maintaining anonymity.</p>
<p>And because of that,</p>
<p>you have to have some source of verification</p>
<p>in order to make sure that it&rsquo;s not possible to manipulate</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s ultimately about trust and information.</p>
<p>So it could be, verification is really important there.</p>
<p>So basically, individual people should</p>
<p>ask their local health authorities</p>
<p>to sign up to contact you.</p>
<p>I hope this spreads.</p>
<p>I hope this spreads for future pandemics</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m really, it&rsquo;s the amount,</p>
<p>the millions of people who are hurt by this,</p>
<p>I think our response to the virus,</p>
<p>economically speaking,</p>
<p>the number of people who lost their dream,</p>
<p>lost their jobs, but also lost their dream.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs, jobs often give meaning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who financially and psychologically</p>
<p>are suffering because of our,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say, incompetent response to the virus</p>
<p>across the world, but certainly the United States,</p>
<p>that should be the beacon of entrepreneurial hope</p>
<p>for the world.</p>
<p>So I hope that we&rsquo;ll be able to respond</p>
<p>to these kinds of events much better in the future.</p>
<p>And this is exactly the right kind of idea.</p>
<p>And now is the time to do the investment.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s step back to the beauty of mathematics.</p>
<p>Maybe ask the big, silly question first,</p>
<p>which is, what do you find beautiful about mathematics?</p>
<p>I think that being able to look at a complicated problem,</p>
<p>which looks unsolvable,</p>
<p>and then to be able to change the perspective</p>
<p>to come from a different angle</p>
<p>and suddenly see that there&rsquo;s a nice solution.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean that every problem in math</p>
<p>is supposed to be this way,</p>
<p>but I think that these reframings</p>
<p>and changing of perspectives</p>
<p>that cause difficult things to get simplified</p>
<p>and crystallized and factored in certain ways is beautiful.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s related to what we were just talking about</p>
<p>with even this fighting pandemics.</p>
<p>The crystal idea was just quantify proximity</p>
<p>by the number of relationships in the physical network,</p>
<p>instead of just by the feet and meters, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that if you change that perspective,</p>
<p>now all of these things follow.</p>
<p>And so mathematics to me is beautiful</p>
<p>in the pure sense just for that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s quite interesting to see a human civilization</p>
<p>as a network, as a graph,</p>
<p>and our relationships as kind of edges in that graph.</p>
<p>And to then do, outside of just pandemic,</p>
<p>do interesting inferences based on that.</p>
<p>This is true for like Twitter, social networks and so on,</p>
<p>how we expand the kind of things we talk about,</p>
<p>think about sort of politically,</p>
<p>if you have this little bubble, quote unquote,</p>
<p>of ideas that you play with,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice from a recommender system perspective,</p>
<p>how do you jump out of those bubbles?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>YouTube was working on that, Twitter&rsquo;s working on that,</p>
<p>but not always so successfully,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting work</p>
<p>from a mathematical and a psychological,</p>
<p>sociological perspective there within those graphs.</p>
<p>But if we look at the cleanest formulation of that,</p>
<p>of looking at a problem from a different perspective,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also involved</p>
<p>with the International Mathematics Olympiad,</p>
<p>which takes small, clean problems that are really hard,</p>
<p>but once you look at them differently, can become easy.</p>
<p>But that little jump of innovation is the entire trick.</p>
<p>So maybe at the high level,</p>
<p>can you say what is the International Mathematical Olympiad?</p>
<p>Sure, so this is the competition</p>
<p>for people who aren&rsquo;t yet in college, math competition,</p>
<p>which is the most prestigious one in the entire world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Olympics of mathematics,</p>
<p>but only for people who aren&rsquo;t yet in college.</p>
<p>Now, the kinds of questions that they ask you to do</p>
<p>are not computational.</p>
<p>Usually you&rsquo;re not supposed to find that the answer is 42.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Instead, you&rsquo;re supposed to explain why something is true.</p>
<p>And the problem is that at the beginning,</p>
<p>when you look at each of the questions,</p>
<p>first of all, you have four and a half hours</p>
<p>to solve three questions, and this is one day,</p>
<p>and then you have a second day,</p>
<p>which is four and a half hours, three questions.</p>
<p>But when you look at the questions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all asking you,</p>
<p>explain why the following thing is true,</p>
<p>which you&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>And by the way, even though there are six questions,</p>
<p>if you solve any one of them, you&rsquo;re a genius</p>
<p>and you get an honorable mention.</p>
<p>So this is hard to solve.</p>
<p>So what about, is it one person, is it a team?</p>
<p>Ah, so each country can send six people</p>
<p>and the score of the country is actually unofficial.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not an official country versus country system,</p>
<p>although everyone just adds up the point scores</p>
<p>of the six people and they say,</p>
<p>well, now which country stacked up where?</p>
<p>Yeah, so maybe as a side comment,</p>
<p>I should say that there&rsquo;s a bunch of countries,</p>
<p>including the former Soviet Union and Russia,</p>
<p>where I grew up, where this is one of the</p>
<p>most important competitions that the country participates in.</p>
<p>It was a source of pride for a lot of the country.</p>
<p>You look at the Olympic sports,</p>
<p>like wrestling, weightlifting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain sports and hockey</p>
<p>that Russia and the Soviet Union truly took pride in.</p>
<p>And actually the Mathematical Olympiad,</p>
<p>it was one of them for many years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still one of them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think about it this way in the United States.</p>
<p>Maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not nearly as popular in the United States</p>
<p>in terms of its integration into the culture,</p>
<p>into just basic conversation, into the pride.</p>
<p>Like, if you won an Olympic gold medal</p>
<p>or if you win the Super Bowl, you can walk around proud.</p>
<p>I think that was the case</p>
<p>with the Mathematical Olympiad in Russia.</p>
<p>Not as much the case in the United States, I think.</p>
<p>So I just wanna give that a little aside</p>
<p>because beating anybody from Russia,</p>
<p>from the Eastern Republic or from China</p>
<p>is very, very difficult.</p>
<p>Like, if I remember correctly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people, this was a multiyear training process.</p>
<p>They train hard.</p>
<p>And this is everything that they&rsquo;re focused on.</p>
<p>My dad was a participant in this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s as serious as Olympic sports.</p>
<p>You think about like gymnastics,</p>
<p>like young athletes participating in gymnastics.</p>
<p>This is as serious as that, if not more serious.</p>
<p>So I just wanna give that a little bit of context</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about serious high level math,</p>
<p>athletics almost here.</p>
<p>Yeah, and actually I also think that it made sense</p>
<p>from the Soviet Union&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>because if you look at what these people do eventually,</p>
<p>even though, let&rsquo;s look at the USSR&rsquo;s</p>
<p>International Math Olympiad record.</p>
<p>Even though they, I say, even though they won</p>
<p>a lot of awards at the high school thing,</p>
<p>many of them went on to do incredible things</p>
<p>in research mathematics or research other things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s showing the generalization,</p>
<p>generalizability of what they were working on.</p>
<p>Because ultimately we&rsquo;re just playing with ideas</p>
<p>of how to prove things.</p>
<p>And if you get pretty good at inventing creative ways</p>
<p>to turn problems apart, split them apart,</p>
<p>observe neat ways to turn messy things into simple crystals.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re gonna try to solve any real problem</p>
<p>in the real world, that could be a really handy tool too.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it was a bad investment.</p>
<p>I think it clearly worked well for Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is interesting.</p>
<p>People sometimes ask me, you know,</p>
<p>you go up and under communism, you know,</p>
<p>was there anything good about communism?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s difficult for me to talk about it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not, communism is one of those things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s looked down on like without,</p>
<p>in absolutist terms currently.</p>
<p>But you could still, in my perspective,</p>
<p>talk about the actual, forget communism</p>
<p>or whatever the actual term is,</p>
<p>but you know, certain ways that the society functioned</p>
<p>that we can learn lessons from.</p>
<p>And one of the things in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>that was highly prized is knowledge,</p>
<p>not even knowledge, it&rsquo;s wisdom</p>
<p>and the skill of invention, of innovation at a young age.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about a selection process</p>
<p>where you pick the best students in the school</p>
<p>to do the mathematics or to read literature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, everybody did it.</p>
<p>Everybody, it was almost treated</p>
<p>as if anyone could be the next Einstein,</p>
<p>anybody could be the next, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Hemingway, James Joyce.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re forcing an education on the populace</p>
<p>and a rigorous deep education,</p>
<p>like as opposed to kind of like,</p>
<p>oh, we wanna make sure we teach</p>
<p>to the weakest student in the class,</p>
<p>which American systems can sometimes do</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t wanna leave anyone behind.</p>
<p>The Russian system was anyone can be the strongest student</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna teach you the strongest student</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to pretend or force everybody,</p>
<p>even the weakest student to be strong.</p>
<p>And what that results in, it&rsquo;s obviously,</p>
<p>this is what people talk about,</p>
<p>is a huge amount of pressure.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s psychologically very difficult.</p>
<p>This is why people struggle when they go to MIT,</p>
<p>this very competitive environment.</p>
<p>It can be very psychologically difficult,</p>
<p>but at the same time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bringing out the best out of people.</p>
<p>And that mathematics was certainly one of those things.</p>
<p>And exactly what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which kind of clicked with me just now,</p>
<p>as opposed to kind of a spelling bee in the United States,</p>
<p>which I guess you spell, I&rsquo;m horrible at this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a competition about spelling,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not sure, but you could argue</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t generalize well to the future skills.</p>
<p>Mathematics, especially this kind of mathematics</p>
<p>is essentially formalized competition of invention,</p>
<p>of creating new ideas.</p>
<p>And that generalizes really, really well.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s quite brilliantly put.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really think about that.</p>
<p>So this is not just about the competition.</p>
<p>This is about developing minds</p>
<p>that will come to do some incredible stuff in the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, I want to respond</p>
<p>to a couple of things there.</p>
<p>The first one, this one, which is this notion</p>
<p>of whether or not that is possible</p>
<p>in a non authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually why I spent some of my efforts</p>
<p>before the COVID thing,</p>
<p>actually trying to work towards there.</p>
<p>The reason is because if you think about it,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say in America,</p>
<p>lots of people are pretty serious</p>
<p>about training very hard for football,</p>
<p>or baseball, or basketball.</p>
<p>Basketball is very, very accessible,</p>
<p>but lots of people are doing that.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, actually, I think that what was going on</p>
<p>with the authoritarian thing was at least the message</p>
<p>that was universally sent was being a good thinker</p>
<p>and a creator of ideas is a good thing.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why that message can&rsquo;t be sent everywhere.</p>
<p>And I think it actually should be.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing.</p>
<p>The second thing is what you commented about this thing</p>
<p>about the generalizable skill</p>
<p>and what could people do with Olympiads afterwards.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually my interest in the whole thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just coach students how to do problems.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m not even the best person for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the best at solving these problems.</p>
<p>There are other people who are much better</p>
<p>at making problems and teaching people how to solve problems.</p>
<p>In fact, when the Mathematical Association of America,</p>
<p>which is the group which is in charge</p>
<p>of the US participation in these Olympiads,</p>
<p>when they were deciding whether or not to put me in</p>
<p>back in 2013 as the head coach,</p>
<p>I had a conversation with their executive director</p>
<p>where I commented that we might do worse</p>
<p>because my position was I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, I actually didn&rsquo;t want to focus on winning.</p>
<p>I said, if you&rsquo;re going to let me work</p>
<p>with 60 very strong minds as picked through this system,</p>
<p>because the coach works with these,</p>
<p>gets to run a camp for these students.</p>
<p>I said, I&rsquo;m actually not going to define my success</p>
<p>in terms of winning this contest.</p>
<p>I said, I wanted to maximize the number of the students</p>
<p>that I read about in the New York Times in 20 years.</p>
<p>And the executive director</p>
<p>of the Mathematical Association of America</p>
<p>was fully in support of this</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s also how their philosophy is.</p>
<p>So in America, the way we run this</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re actually not just training to win,</p>
<p>even though the students are very good</p>
<p>and they can win anyway.</p>
<p>One reason, for example, I went and even did the COVID thing</p>
<p>involving quite a few of them</p>
<p>is so that hopefully some of them get ideas</p>
<p>because in 20, 30 years, I won&rsquo;t have the energy</p>
<p>or the insight to solve problems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have another catastrophe.</p>
<p>And hopefully some of these people will step up and do it.</p>
<p>And ultimately have that longterm impact.</p>
<p>I wonder if this is scalable to,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s such a great metric for education,</p>
<p>not how to get an A on the test, but how to have,</p>
<p>how to be on the cover of New York Times</p>
<p>for inventing something new.</p>
<p>And do you think that&rsquo;s generalizable to education</p>
<p>beyond just this particular Olympia?</p>
<p>Like, even you saying this feels like a rare statement,</p>
<p>almost like a radical statement as a goal for education.</p>
<p>So actually the way I teach my classes at Carnegie Mellon,</p>
<p>which I will admit right away is not equivalent</p>
<p>to the average in the world,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s already not just the top 60 in the country</p>
<p>as picked by something.</p>
<p>Let me just explain.</p>
<p>I have exams in my class, which are 90% of the grade.</p>
<p>So the exams are the whole thing,</p>
<p>or most of the whole thing.</p>
<p>And the way that I let students prepare for the exams</p>
<p>is I show them all the problems I&rsquo;ve ever given</p>
<p>on the previous exams.</p>
<p>And the exam that they will take is open notes.</p>
<p>They can take all the notes they want</p>
<p>on the previous problems.</p>
<p>And the guarantee is that the exam problems this time</p>
<p>will have no overlap with anything</p>
<p>you have seen me give in the past,</p>
<p>as well as no overlap with anything I taught in the class.</p>
<p>So the entire exam is invention.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how I go, right?</p>
<p>My point is I have explained to people when I teach you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to have remembered a method I showed you.</p>
<p>I want you to have learned enough about this area</p>
<p>that if you face a new question,</p>
<p>which I came up with the night before</p>
<p>by thinking about like,</p>
<p>what could I ask that I have never asked before?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s cute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the answer is.</p>
<p>Aha, that&rsquo;s an exam problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I do before the exam.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s what I want them to learn.</p>
<p>And the first exam, usually people have a rough time</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, what kind of crazy class is this?</p>
<p>The professor doesn&rsquo;t teach you anything for the exam.</p>
<p>But then by the second or third,</p>
<p>and by the time they finished the class,</p>
<p>they have learned how to solve anything in the area.</p>
<p>How to invent.</p>
<p>How to invent in that area, yeah.</p>
<p>Can we walk back to the Mathematical Olympiad?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the scoring and format like?</p>
<p>And also what does it take to win?</p>
<p>So the way it works is that each of the six students</p>
<p>do the problems and there are six problems.</p>
<p>All the problems are equally weighted.</p>
<p>So each one&rsquo;s worth seven points.</p>
<p>That means that your maximum score</p>
<p>is six problems times seven points,</p>
<p>which is the nice number of 42.</p>
<p>And now the way that they&rsquo;re scored by the way</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s partial credit.</p>
<p>So the question is asking you,</p>
<p>explain why this weird fact is true.</p>
<p>Okay, if you explain why you get seven points.</p>
<p>If you make minor mistake, maybe you get six points.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t succeed in explaining why,</p>
<p>but you explain some other true fact,</p>
<p>which is along the way of proving it,</p>
<p>then you get partial credit.</p>
<p>And actually now this is tricky</p>
<p>because how do you score such a thing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like the answer was 72</p>
<p>and you wrote 71 and it&rsquo;s close, right?</p>
<p>The answer is 72 and you wrote 36.</p>
<p>Oh, but that&rsquo;s pretty close</p>
<p>because maybe you&rsquo;re just off by it.</p>
<p>By the way, they&rsquo;re not numerical anyway,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just giving some numerical analog</p>
<p>to the way the scoring might work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all essays.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I guess I have some role</p>
<p>as well as some other people</p>
<p>who helped me in the US delegation for coaches.</p>
<p>We actually debate with the country which is organizing it.</p>
<p>The country which is organizing the Olympiad</p>
<p>brings about 50 people to help judge the written solutions.</p>
<p>And you schedule these half hour appointments</p>
<p>where the delegation from one country</p>
<p>sits down at a table like this.</p>
<p>Opposite side is two or three people from the host country.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just looking over these exam papers</p>
<p>saying, well, how many points is this worth</p>
<p>based on some rubric that has been designed?</p>
<p>And this is a negotiation process</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re not trying to bargain</p>
<p>and get the best score we can.</p>
<p>In fact, sometimes we go to this table</p>
<p>and we will say, we think we want less than what you gave us.</p>
<p>This is how our, these are our principles.</p>
<p>If you give us too much, we say, no, you gave us too much.</p>
<p>We do that.</p>
<p>However, the reason why this is an interesting process</p>
<p>is because if you can imagine every country</p>
<p>which is participating has its own language.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re trying to grade the Mongolian scripts</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re written in Mongolian,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t read Mongolian, which most people don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>then the coaches are explaining to you,</p>
<p>this is what the student has written.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite interesting process.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like a jury.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You have, in the American legal system,</p>
<p>you have a jury that where they&rsquo;re deliberating,</p>
<p>but unlike a jury, there&rsquo;s the members of the jury</p>
<p>speaking different languages sometimes.</p>
<p>Yes. That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to know what to do</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s probably really, really competitive.</p>
<p>But your sense is that ultimately people,</p>
<p>like how do you prevent manipulation here, right?</p>
<p>Well, we just hope that it&rsquo;s not happening.</p>
<p>So we write in English.</p>
<p>Therefore, everything that the US does,</p>
<p>everyone can look at.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for you to manipulate.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t manipulate.</p>
<p>We only hope that other people aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But at the same time, as you see, our philosophy was,</p>
<p>we want to use this as a way to develop general talent.</p>
<p>And although we do this for the six people who go</p>
<p>to the International Math Olympiad,</p>
<p>we really want that everyone at any,</p>
<p>touched at any stage of this process</p>
<p>get some skills that can help to contribute more later.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you can say something insightful</p>
<p>to this question,</p>
<p>but what do you think makes a really hard math problem</p>
<p>on this Olympiad, maybe in the courses you teach</p>
<p>or in general?</p>
<p>What makes for a hard problem?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;m sure, a lot of really difficult problems.</p>
<p>What makes a hard problem?</p>
<p>So I could quantify it by the number of leaps of insight</p>
<p>of changes of perspective that are along the way.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>This is like a very theoretical computer science</p>
<p>way of looking at it, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that each reframing of the problem</p>
<p>and using of some tool,</p>
<p>I actually call that a leap of insight.</p>
<p>When you say, oh, wow, now I see,</p>
<p>I should kind of put these plugs into those sockets</p>
<p>like so, and suddenly I get to use that machine.</p>
<p>Oh, but I&rsquo;m not done yet.</p>
<p>Now I need to do it again.</p>
<p>Each such step is a large possible,</p>
<p>large fan out in the search space.</p>
<p>The number of these tells you the exponent.</p>
<p>The base of the exponent is like how big,</p>
<p>how many different possibilities you could try.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually why,</p>
<p>like if you have a three insight problem,</p>
<p>that is not three times as hard as a one insight problem,</p>
<p>because after you&rsquo;ve made the one insight,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear that that was the right track necessarily.</p>
<p>Well, unless you&rsquo;re very into it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a branching of possibility.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s problems like on the math Olympia</p>
<p>that requires more than one insight?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Those are the hard ones.</p>
<p>And also I can tell you how you can tell.</p>
<p>So this is how I also taught myself math</p>
<p>when I was in college.</p>
<p>So if you are taking a, not taught myself,</p>
<p>I was taking classes, of course,</p>
<p>but I was trying to read the textbook</p>
<p>and I found out I was very bad at reading math textbooks.</p>
<p>A math textbook has a long page of stuff that is all true,</p>
<p>which after you read the page,</p>
<p>you have no idea what you just read.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is just a good summary of a math textbook.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s not clear why anything was done that way.</p>
<p>And yes, everything is true,</p>
<p>but how the heck did anyone think of that?</p>
<p>So the way that I taught myself math eventually was,</p>
<p>the way I read a math textbook</p>
<p>is I would look at the theorem statement.</p>
<p>I would look at the length of the proof</p>
<p>and then I would close the book</p>
<p>and attempt to reproof it myself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>The length of the proof is telling you</p>
<p>the number of insights,</p>
<p>because the length of the proof is linear</p>
<p>in the number of insights.</p>
<p>Each insight takes space.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if I know that it&rsquo;s a short proof,</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s only one insight.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m doing my own way of solving the problem,</p>
<p>like finding the proof,</p>
<p>I quit if I have to do too many plugins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s equivalent to a math contest.</p>
<p>In a math contest I look,</p>
<p>is it problem one, two, or three?</p>
<p>That tells me how many insights there are.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>Linear in the number.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible that that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Approximately, approximately.</p>
<p>Approximately, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if somebody out there</p>
<p>is gonna try to formally prove this.</p>
<p>Oh no, I mean, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>There are cases where maybe it&rsquo;s not quite linear,</p>
<p>but in general.</p>
<p>Well, some of it&rsquo;s notation too,</p>
<p>and some of it is style and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but within a textbook.</p>
<p>Within the same book.</p>
<p>Within the same book with the same.</p>
<p>Within the same book on the same subject.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is what I was using.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Because you know, if it&rsquo;s a two page proof,</p>
<p>you just know this is gonna be insane, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the scary thing about insights.</p>
<p>You look like Andrew Wiles</p>
<p>working on the Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem,</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Something seems like a good idea,</p>
<p>and you have that idea,</p>
<p>and it feels like this is a leap,</p>
<p>like a totally new way to see it,</p>
<p>but you have no idea if it&rsquo;s at all useful.</p>
<p>Even if you think it&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>you have no idea if this is like going to go down a path</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely counterproductive</p>
<p>or not productive at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the crappy thing about invention,</p>
<p>is like I have, I&rsquo;m sure you do.</p>
<p>I have a lot of really good ideas every single day,</p>
<p>but like, and I&rsquo;ll go inside my head along them,</p>
<p>along that little trajectory,</p>
<p>but it could be just a total waste.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, you know what that feels like?</p>
<p>It just feels like patience is required,</p>
<p>not to get excited at any one thing.</p>
<p>So I think this is interesting</p>
<p>because you raised Andrew Wiles.</p>
<p>He spent seven years attacking the same thing, right?</p>
<p>And so I think that what attracts</p>
<p>professional researchers to this</p>
<p>is because even though it&rsquo;s very painful</p>
<p>that you keep fighting with something,</p>
<p>when you finally find the right insights</p>
<p>and string them together,</p>
<p>it feels really good, so.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also like short term,</p>
<p>it feels good to, whether it&rsquo;s real or not,</p>
<p>to pretend like you&rsquo;ve solved something</p>
<p>in the sense like you have an insight</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a sense like this might be the insight</p>
<p>that solves it.</p>
<p>So at least for me, I just enjoy that rush of positivity</p>
<p>even though I know statistically speaking</p>
<p>is probably going to be a dead end.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the same way, I&rsquo;m the same way.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s how I know whether</p>
<p>I might want to keep thinking about this general problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if I still see that I&rsquo;m getting some insights,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at a dead end yet.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s also where I learned something</p>
<p>from my PhD advisor.</p>
<p>Actually, he was a real big inspiration on my life.</p>
<p>His name is Benny Sudakov.</p>
<p>In fact, he grew up in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>He was from Georgia, but he&rsquo;s an incredible person.</p>
<p>But one thing I learned was choose the problems to work on</p>
<p>that might matter if you succeed.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s why, for example, we dug into COVID.</p>
<p>It was just, well, suppose we succeed</p>
<p>in finding some interesting insight here.</p>
<p>Well, it actually matters.</p>
<p>That is worth a laugh.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think COVID, the way you&rsquo;re approaching COVID</p>
<p>has two interesting possibilities.</p>
<p>One, it might help with COVID or another pandemic,</p>
<p>but two, I mean, just this whole network theory space,</p>
<p>you might unlock some deep understanding</p>
<p>about the interaction with human beings.</p>
<p>That might have nothing to do with the pandemic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a space of possible impacts</p>
<p>that may be direct or indirect.</p>
<p>And the same thing is with Andrew Wiles&rsquo;s proof.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand, but apparently the pieces of it</p>
<p>are really impactful for mathematics,</p>
<p>even if the main theorem is not.</p>
<p>So along the way, the insights you have</p>
<p>might be really powerful for unexpected reasons.</p>
<p>So I like what you said.</p>
<p>This is something that I learned from another friend of mine.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very famous researcher.</p>
<p>All these people are more famous than I am.</p>
<p>His name is Jacob Fox.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Jacob Fox at Stanford.</p>
<p>Also a very big inspiration for me.</p>
<p>We were both grad students together at the same time.</p>
<p>Well, most importantly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re good at selecting good friends.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah, well, that&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>You gotta find good people to learn things from.</p>
<p>But his thing was, he often said,</p>
<p>if you solve a math problem and have this math proof,</p>
<p>math problem for him is like a proof, right?</p>
<p>So suppose you came up with this proof.</p>
<p>He always asks, what have we learned from this</p>
<p>that we could potentially use for something else?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, did you solve the problem</p>
<p>that was supposed to be famous?</p>
<p>And is there something new in the course of solving this</p>
<p>that you had to invent</p>
<p>that we could now use as a tool elsewhere?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s this funny effect</p>
<p>where just looking at different fields</p>
<p>where people discover parallels.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll prove something, it&rsquo;ll be a totally new result.</p>
<p>And then somebody later realizes</p>
<p>this was already done 30 years ago</p>
<p>in another discipline, in another way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Now, we did this offline</p>
<p>in another illustration he showed to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see the different perspectives</p>
<p>on a problem.</p>
<p>It kind of points like there&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>very few novel ideas that everything else,</p>
<p>that most of us are just looking at different perspective</p>
<p>on the same idea.</p>
<p>And it makes you wonder this old silly question</p>
<p>that I have to ask you is,</p>
<p>do you think mathematics is discovered or invented?</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re creating new idea?</p>
<p>Are we building a set of knowledge</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s distinct from reality?</p>
<p>Or are we actually like,</p>
<p>is math almost like a shovel</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re digging to like this core set of truths</p>
<p>that were always there all along?</p>
<p>So I personally feel like it&rsquo;s discovered.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s also because I guess the way that</p>
<p>I like to choose what questions to work on</p>
<p>are questions that maybe we&rsquo;ll get to learn something about</p>
<p>why is this hard?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m often attracted to questions</p>
<p>that look simple, but are hard, right?</p>
<p>And what could you possibly learn from that?</p>
<p>Sort of like probably the attraction</p>
<p>of Fermat&rsquo;s last theorem, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>simple statement, why is it so hard?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m more on the discovered side.</p>
<p>And I also feel like if we ever ran into</p>
<p>an intelligent other species in the universe,</p>
<p>probably if we compared notes,</p>
<p>there might be some similarities between both of us</p>
<p>realizing that pi is important.</p>
<p>Because you might say, why, why humans,</p>
<p>do humans like circles more than others?</p>
<p>I think stars also like circles.</p>
<p>I think planets like circles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not perfect circles,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, the concept of a circle</p>
<p>is just point and constant distance.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t get any simpler than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that like an alien species</p>
<p>will have, depending on different cognitive capabilities</p>
<p>and different perception systems,</p>
<p>will be able to see things</p>
<p>that are much different than circles.</p>
<p>And so if it&rsquo;s discovered,</p>
<p>it will still be pointing at a lot of same</p>
<p>geometrical concepts, mathematical concepts,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting to think of how many things</p>
<p>we would have to still align,</p>
<p>not just based on notation, but based on understanding,</p>
<p>like just like some basic mathematical concepts,</p>
<p>like how much work is there going to be</p>
<p>in trying to find a common language?</p>
<p>I mean, this is, I think Stephen Wolfram and his son</p>
<p>helped with the movie Arrival,</p>
<p>like the developing an alien language,</p>
<p>like how would aliens communicate with humans?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating,</p>
<p>because like math seems to be the most promising thing,</p>
<p>but even like math,</p>
<p>like how do you visualize mathematical ideas?</p>
<p>It feels like there has to be an interactive component,</p>
<p>just like we have a conversation.</p>
<p>There has to be, this is something we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I think, think about often, which is like,</p>
<p>with somebody who doesn&rsquo;t know anything about math,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know anything about English</p>
<p>or any other natural language,</p>
<p>how would we describe,</p>
<p>we talked offline about visual proofs.</p>
<p>How would we, through visual proofs, have a conversation</p>
<p>where we say something, here&rsquo;s the concept,</p>
<p>the way we see it, does that make sense to you?</p>
<p>And like, can you mess with that concept</p>
<p>to make it sense for you?</p>
<p>And then go back and forth in this kind of way.</p>
<p>So purely through mathematics,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s possible to have those kinds of experiments</p>
<p>with like tribes on earth that don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no common language.</p>
<p>Through math, like draw a circle</p>
<p>and see what they do with it, right?</p>
<p>Do some of these visual proofs,</p>
<p>like the summation of the odds and adds up to the squares.</p>
<p>Yes, I wonder how difficult that is</p>
<p>before one or the other species murders themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I hope that the curiosity for knowledge</p>
<p>will overpower the greedy,</p>
<p>this is back to our game theory thing,</p>
<p>that the curiosity of like discovering math together</p>
<p>will overpower the desire for resources</p>
<p>and ultimately like willing to commit violence</p>
<p>in order to gain those resources.</p>
<p>I think as we progress,</p>
<p>become more and more intelligent as a species,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping we would value more and more of the knowledge</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll come up with clever ways</p>
<p>to gain more resources so we won&rsquo;t be so resource starved.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hopeful message for when we finally meet aliens.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The cool thing about the Math Olympiad,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know work from Francois Chollet</p>
<p>from Google, he came up with this kind of IQ test slash,</p>
<p>it kind of has similar aspects to it</p>
<p>that also the Math Olympiad does for AI.</p>
<p>So he came up with these tests</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re very simple for humans,</p>
<p>but very difficult for AI to illustrate exactly</p>
<p>why we&rsquo;re just not good at seeing a totally new problem.</p>
<p>Sorry, AI systems are not good at looking at a new problem</p>
<p>that requires you to detect</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a symmetry of some kind,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a pattern that hasn&rsquo;t seen before.</p>
<p>The pattern is like obvious to us humans,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not so obvious to find that kind of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re inventing a pattern that&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>in order to then find a solution.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment on that.</p>
<p>If you can comment on, but from an AI perspective</p>
<p>and from a math problem perspective,</p>
<p>what do you think is intelligence?</p>
<p>What do you think is the thing</p>
<p>that allows us to solve that problem?</p>
<p>And how hard is it to build a machine to do that?</p>
<p>Asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I guess, you see,</p>
<p>because if I just think of the raw search space, it&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And if I think about what makes somebody</p>
<p>good at doing these things, they have this heuristic sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a good chess player of saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not keep analyzing down this way</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some heuristic reason</p>
<p>why that&rsquo;s a bad way to go.</p>
<p>Where did they get that heuristic from?</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Because that, if you asked them to explain to you,</p>
<p>they could probably say something in words</p>
<p>that sounds like it makes sense,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing that&rsquo;s only a part</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s really going on in their brain</p>
<p>of evaluating that position.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>If you ask Gary Kasparov, what is good,</p>
<p>or why is this position good, he will say something,</p>
<p>but probably not approximating everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on inside.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s basically a function being computed,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to articulate what that function is.</p>
<p>Now, the question is, could a computer get as good</p>
<p>at computing these kinds of heuristic functions?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not enough of an expert to understand,</p>
<p>but one bit of me has always been a little bit curious</p>
<p>of whether or not the human brain has a particular tendency</p>
<p>due to its wiring to come up with certain kinds of things,</p>
<p>which is just natural due to the way</p>
<p>that the topology of the neurons and whatever is there,</p>
<p>for which if you tried to just build from scratch</p>
<p>a computer to do it,</p>
<p>would it naturally have different tendencies?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is just me being completely ignorant</p>
<p>and just saying a few ideas.</p>
<p>Well, this is a good thing that mathematics shows</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t have to be,</p>
<p>so math and physics or mathematical physics</p>
<p>operates in a world that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>than our descendants of eight brains operate in.</p>
<p>So it allows us to have multiple, many, many dimensions.</p>
<p>It allows us to work on weird surfaces.</p>
<p>I would like topology as a discipline is just weird to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really complicated,</p>
<p>but it allows us to work in that space,</p>
<p>the differential geometry and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s totally outside of our natural day to day</p>
<p>four dimensional experience,</p>
<p>3D dimensional with time experience.</p>
<p>So math gives me hope that we can discover</p>
<p>the processes of intelligence outside the limited nature</p>
<p>of our own human experiences.</p>
<p>But you said that you&rsquo;re not an expert.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of funny.</p>
<p>I find that we know so little about intelligence</p>
<p>that I honestly think like almost children are more expert</p>
<p>at creating artificial intelligence systems than adults.</p>
<p>I feel like we know so little,</p>
<p>we really need to think outside the box.</p>
<p>And those little,</p>
<p>I found people should check out</p>
<p>Francois Chollet&rsquo;s little exams,</p>
<p>but even just solving math problems,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever done this for yourself,</p>
<p>but when you solve a math problem,</p>
<p>you kind of then trace back and try to figure out</p>
<p>where did that idea come from?</p>
<p>Like what was I visualizing in my head?</p>
<p>How did I start visualizing it that way?</p>
<p>Why did I start rotating that cube in my head in that way?</p>
<p>Like what is that?</p>
<p>If I were to try to build a program that does that,</p>
<p>where did that come from?</p>
<p>So this is interesting.</p>
<p>So I try to do this to teach middle school students</p>
<p>how to learn how to create and think and invent.</p>
<p>And the way I do it</p>
<p>is there are these math competition problems</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m working in collaboration</p>
<p>with the people who run those.</p>
<p>And I will turn on my YouTube live</p>
<p>and for the first time,</p>
<p>look at those questions and live solve them.</p>
<p>The reason I do this is to let the middle school students</p>
<p>and the high school students and the adults</p>
<p>whoever wants to watch,</p>
<p>just see what exactly goes on through someone&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>as they go and attempt to invent what they need to do</p>
<p>to solve the question.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve actually thought about that.</p>
<p>I think that, first of all, as a teacher,</p>
<p>I think about that because whenever I want to explain</p>
<p>to a student how to do something,</p>
<p>I want to explain how it made sense,</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s intuitive to do the following things</p>
<p>and why the wrong things are wrong.</p>
<p>Not just why this one short fast way,</p>
<p>well, why this is the right way, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So my point is I&rsquo;m actually always thinking about that.</p>
<p>Like how would you think about these things?</p>
<p>And then I eventually decided the easiest way</p>
<p>to expose this would just be to go live on YouTube</p>
<p>and just say, I&rsquo;ve never seen any of these questions before.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get, that&rsquo;s anxiety inducing for me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get trapped in a kind of like little dead ends</p>
<p>of confusion, even on middle school problems?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what the comments are for.</p>
<p>The live comments come in and students say, try this.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually pretty good.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll never get stuck.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m willing to go on camera and say,</p>
<p>guess what, Potion Dough can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But then what ends up happening is you will then see</p>
<p>how maybe somebody saying something and I look at the chat</p>
<p>and I say, aha, that actually looks useful.</p>
<p>Now that also shows how not all ideas,</p>
<p>not all suggestions are the same power, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Because if I actually do get stuck,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go fishing through the chat, if you&rsquo;ve got any ideas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can speak to this,</p>
<p>but is there a moment for the middle school students,</p>
<p>maybe high school as well,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like a turning point for them</p>
<p>where they maybe fall in love with mathematics</p>
<p>or they get it?</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about like discovering</p>
<p>that moment and trying to grab them to get them</p>
<p>to understand that mathematics is something,</p>
<p>no matter what they wanna do in life</p>
<p>could be part of their life?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I actually do think that the middle school</p>
<p>is exactly the right time</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the place</p>
<p>where your mathematical understanding</p>
<p>gets just sophisticated enough</p>
<p>that you can start doing interesting things.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re early on and counting,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not very good at teaching you new insights.</p>
<p>My wife is pretty good at that.</p>
<p>But somehow once you get to this part</p>
<p>where you know what a fraction is</p>
<p>and when you know how to add and how to multiply</p>
<p>and what the area of a triangle is,</p>
<p>at that point to me, the whole world opens up</p>
<p>and you can start observing</p>
<p>there are really nifty coincidences,</p>
<p>the things that made the Greek mathematicians</p>
<p>and the ancient mathematicians excited.</p>
<p>Actually back then it was exciting</p>
<p>to discover the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just homework.</p>
<p>So is there,</p>
<p>which discipline do you think</p>
<p>has the most exciting coincidences?</p>
<p>So is it geometry?</p>
<p>Is it algebra?</p>
<p>Or is it calculus?</p>
<p>Well, you see, you&rsquo;re asking me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m the guy who gets the most excited</p>
<p>when the combinatorics shows up in the geometry.</p>
<p>Is it, okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the combinatorics in the geometry.</p>
<p>So first of all, the nice thing about geometry,</p>
<p>this is the same nice thing about computer vision</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s visual.</p>
<p>So geometry, you can draw circles and triangles and stuff.</p>
<p>So it naturally presents itself</p>
<p>to the visual proof, right?</p>
<p>But also the nice thing about geometry,</p>
<p>I think for me is the earliest class,</p>
<p>the earliest discipline where there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most amenable to the exploration,</p>
<p>the invention through proofs.</p>
<p>The idea of proofs I think is most easily shown in geometry</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so visual, I guess.</p>
<p>So that to me is like,</p>
<p>if I were to think about</p>
<p>when I first fell in love with math, it would be geometry.</p>
<p>And sadly enough, that&rsquo;s not used.</p>
<p>Geometry only has a little,</p>
<p>appears briefly in the journey of a student.</p>
<p>And it kind of disappears.</p>
<p>And not until much later,</p>
<p>which there may be like differential geometry,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where else it shows up.</p>
<p>For me in computer science,</p>
<p>like you could start to think about</p>
<p>like computational geometry or even graph theory</p>
<p>as a kind of geometry.</p>
<p>You could start to think about it visually,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s pretty tricky.</p>
<p>But yeah, it was always,</p>
<p>that was the most beautiful one.</p>
<p>Everything else, I guess calculus can be kind of visual too.</p>
<p>That can be pretty beautiful.</p>
<p>But is there something you try to look for in the student</p>
<p>to see like, how can I inspire them at this moment?</p>
<p>Or is this like individual student to student?</p>
<p>Is there something you could say there?</p>
<p>So first of all,</p>
<p>I really think that every student</p>
<p>can pick up all of this skill.</p>
<p>I really do think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something only for a few.</p>
<p>And so if I&rsquo;m looking for a student,</p>
<p>actually oftentimes what I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m looking at a particular student,</p>
<p>the question is,</p>
<p>how can we help you feel like</p>
<p>you have the power to invent also?</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of people</p>
<p>are used to thinking about math</p>
<p>as something where the teacher will show you what to do</p>
<p>and then you will do it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I think that the key is to show that they have some,</p>
<p>let them see that they have some power to invent.</p>
<p>And at that point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often starting by trying to give a question</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t know how to do.</p>
<p>You want to find these questions</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t know how to do,</p>
<p>that they can think about,</p>
<p>and then they can solve.</p>
<p>And then suddenly they say,</p>
<p>my gosh, I&rsquo;ve had a situation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had an experience where I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>And after a while, I did.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give on how to learn math</p>
<p>for people, whether it&rsquo;s a middle school,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s somebody as an adult</p>
<p>kind of gave up on math maybe early on?</p>
<p>I actually think that these math competition problems,</p>
<p>middle school and high school are really good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually very hard.</p>
<p>So if you haven&rsquo;t had this kind of experience before</p>
<p>and you grab a middle school math competition problem</p>
<p>from the state level,</p>
<p>which is used to decide who represents the state</p>
<p>in the country, in the United States, for example,</p>
<p>those are pretty tricky.</p>
<p>And even if you are a professional,</p>
<p>maybe not doing mathematical things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not a middle school student, you&rsquo;ll struggle.</p>
<p>So I find that these things really do teach you things</p>
<p>by trying to work on these questions.</p>
<p>Is there a Googleable term that you could use</p>
<p>for the organization, for the state competitions?</p>
<p>Ah, yeah.</p>
<p>So there are a number of different ones</p>
<p>that are quite popular.</p>
<p>One of them is called Math Counts, M A T H C O U N T S.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big tournament,</p>
<p>which actually has a state level.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a mathleague.org,</p>
<p>mathleague, L E A G U E dot org,</p>
<p>also has this kind of tiered tournament structure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the American math competitions, AMC 8.</p>
<p>AMC also has AMC 10, that&rsquo;s for 10th grade and below</p>
<p>and AMC 12.</p>
<p>These are all run by the Mathematical Association</p>
<p>of America.</p>
<p>And these are all ways to find old questions.</p>
<p>What about the daily challenges that you run?</p>
<p>What are those about?</p>
<p>We do that too.</p>
<p>But I mean, the difference was ours isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that one&rsquo;s not free.</p>
<p>So I should actually probably be careful.</p>
<p>The things that I&rsquo;ve just mentioned are also not free.</p>
<p>Not all of those things I mentioned just now</p>
<p>are free either.</p>
<p>Well, people can figure out what is free and what&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but this is really nice to know what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>But can you speak a little bit to the daily challenges?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually what we did when,</p>
<p>I guess I was thinking about,</p>
<p>how would I try to develop that skill in people</p>
<p>if we had the power to architect the entire system ourselves?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s called the daily challenge with Po Shan Luo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not free because that&rsquo;s actually how I pay</p>
<p>for everything else I do.</p>
<p>So that was the idea.</p>
<p>But the concept was, aha, now let&rsquo;s invent from scratch.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re gonna go from scratch</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna use technology,</p>
<p>what if we made every single lesson</p>
<p>something where first I say,</p>
<p>hey, here&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Recorded, of course, not live.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, I say,</p>
<p>hey, here&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we think about this?</p>
<p>But I know you don&rsquo;t know how to do it.</p>
<p>So now you think,</p>
<p>and a minute later a hint pops on the screen.</p>
<p>But you still think.</p>
<p>And a minute later a big hint pops on the screen.</p>
<p>You still think.</p>
<p>And then finally, after the three minutes,</p>
<p>hopefully you got some ideas you tried to answer.</p>
<p>And then suddenly there&rsquo;s like this</p>
<p>pretty extended explanation of,</p>
<p>oh yeah, so here&rsquo;s like multiple different ways</p>
<p>that you can do the question.</p>
<p>And by accident, you also just learned this other concept.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Is this targeted towards middle school students,</p>
<p>high school students?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s targeted towards middle school students</p>
<p>with competitions.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of high school students</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t do competitions in middle school</p>
<p>where they would also learn how to think.</p>
<p>If you can see the whole concept was,</p>
<p>can we teach people how to think?</p>
<p>How would you do that?</p>
<p>You need to give people the chance to,</p>
<p>on their own, invent without that kid in the front row</p>
<p>answering every question in two seconds.</p>
<p>And people can find it, I think, what daily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s daily.potionlo.com.</p>
<p>But if you go to find my website,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to find it.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Can we zoom out a little bit in the,</p>
<p>so day to day, week to week, month to month,</p>
<p>year to year, what does the lifelong educational process</p>
<p>look like, do you think?</p>
<p>For yourself, but for me,</p>
<p>what would you recommend in the world of mathematics</p>
<p>or sort of as opposed to studying for a test,</p>
<p>but just like lifelong expanding of knowledge</p>
<p>in that skill for invention?</p>
<p>I think I often articulate this as,</p>
<p>can you always try to do more than you could do in the past?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that comes in many ways.</p>
<p>And I will say it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>if one wants to build that with mathematics,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also great to use that philosophy</p>
<p>with all other things.</p>
<p>In fact, if I just think of myself, I just think,</p>
<p>what do I know now that I didn&rsquo;t know a year ago</p>
<p>or a month ago or a week ago?</p>
<p>And not just know,</p>
<p>but what do I have the capability of doing?</p>
<p>And if you just have that attitude, it brings more.</p>
<p>See, the thing is, there&rsquo;s also a habit,</p>
<p>like it is a skill, like I&rsquo;ve been using Anki,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an app for helps you memorize things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve actually, a few months ago,</p>
<p>started doing this daily of setting aside time</p>
<p>to think about an idea that&rsquo;s outside of my work.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s say, it&rsquo;s all over the place, by the way,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say politics, like gun control.</p>
<p>Is it good to have a lot of guns or not in society?</p>
<p>And just, I&rsquo;ve set aside time every day,</p>
<p>I do at least 10 minutes, but I try to do 30,</p>
<p>where I think about a problem.</p>
<p>And I kind of outline it for myself from scratch,</p>
<p>from not looking anything up,</p>
<p>just thinking about it, using common sense.</p>
<p>And I think the practice of that is really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the daily routine of it, it&rsquo;s the discipline of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that I figured something out</p>
<p>from thinking about gun control,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more that that muscle is built too,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that thinking muscle.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of interested in, you know, math has,</p>
<p>because especially because I&rsquo;ve gotten specialized</p>
<p>into machine learning,</p>
<p>and because I love programming so much,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost touch with math a little bit</p>
<p>to where I feel quite sad about it,</p>
<p>and I want to fix that.</p>
<p>Even just not math, like pure knowledge math,</p>
<p>but math, like these middle school problems,</p>
<p>the challenges, right?</p>
<p>Is that something you see a person</p>
<p>be able to do every single day,</p>
<p>kind of just practice every single day for years?</p>
<p>So I can give an answer to that,</p>
<p>that gives a practical way you could do it,</p>
<p>assuming you have kids.</p>
<p>So, no, you can do it yourself.</p>
<p>Step one, get kids.</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m just saying this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just thinking out loud right now,</p>
<p>what could I do to suggest?</p>
<p>Because what I have noticed is that, for example,</p>
<p>if you do have kids who are in elementary school</p>
<p>or middle school, if you yourself go and look</p>
<p>at those middle school math problems</p>
<p>to think about interesting ways</p>
<p>that you can teach your elementary school</p>
<p>or middle school kid, it works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my wife did.</p>
<p>She never did any of those contests before,</p>
<p>but now she knows quite a lot about them.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t teach her anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>She just was messing around with them</p>
<p>and taught herself all of that stuff.</p>
<p>And that had the automatic daily.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always thinking, how do you make it practical, right?</p>
<p>And the way to make it practical</p>
<p>is if the timer on the automatically daily</p>
<p>is that you are going to automatically daily</p>
<p>do something with your own kid.</p>
<p>Now it feeds back.</p>
<p>And that includes the whole lesson</p>
<p>that if you wanna learn something, you should teach it.</p>
<p>Oh, I strongly believe that.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that.</p>
<p>So I currently don&rsquo;t have kids.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, maybe I should just get kids</p>
<p>to help me with the math thing.</p>
<p>But outside of that,</p>
<p>I do want to do great math into daily practice.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll definitely check out the daily challenges</p>
<p>and see, because what is it?</p>
<p>Grant Sanderson, we talked about offline,</p>
<p>the three blue and brown.</p>
<p>He speaks to this as well,</p>
<p>that his videos aren&rsquo;t necessarily,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t speak to the thing that I&rsquo;m referring to,</p>
<p>which is the daily practice.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more almost tools of inspiration.</p>
<p>They kind of show you the beauty</p>
<p>of a particular problem in mathematics,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not a daily ritual.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in search of that daily ritual mathematics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not trivial to find,</p>
<p>but I hope to find that</p>
<p>because I think math gives you a perspective on the world</p>
<p>that enriches everything else.</p>
<p>So I like what you said about the daily also,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s also one reason</p>
<p>why I put my Carnegie Mellon class online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not every day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s every other day.</p>
<p>Semester is almost over.</p>
<p>But the idea was, I guess my philosophy was,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m already doing the class,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just put it there, right?</p>
<p>But I do know that there are people</p>
<p>who have been following it,</p>
<p>who are not in my class at all,</p>
<p>who have just been following it because,</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s combinatorics.</p>
<p>And the value of that is you could,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really need to know calculus to follow it,</p>
<p>if that makes sense.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually something that people could follow.</p>
<p>So again, and that one&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>So that one&rsquo;s just there on YouTube.</p>
<p>Well, speaking of combinatorics,</p>
<p>what is it, what do you find interesting,</p>
<p>what do you find beautiful about combinatorics?</p>
<p>So combinatorics to me is the study of things</p>
<p>where they might be more finite and more discreet.</p>
<p>What I mean is like, if I look at a network,</p>
<p>actually a lot of times the combinatorics</p>
<p>will boil down to something,</p>
<p>and the combinatorics I think about</p>
<p>might be something related to graphs or networks.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very discreet because if you have a node,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that you have 0.7 of a node</p>
<p>and 0.3 of a node over there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got one node,</p>
<p>and then you jump one step to go to the next node.</p>
<p>So that notion is different from say, calculus,</p>
<p>which is very continuous,</p>
<p>where you go and say, I have this speed,</p>
<p>which is changing over time.</p>
<p>And now what&rsquo;s the distance I&rsquo;ve traveled?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the notion of an integral,</p>
<p>where you have to think of subdividing time</p>
<p>into very, very small pieces.</p>
<p>So the kinds of things that you do</p>
<p>when you reason about these finite discreet structures</p>
<p>often might be iterative, algorithmic, inductive.</p>
<p>These are ideas where I go from one step to the next step</p>
<p>and so on and make progress.</p>
<p>I guess I actually personally like all kinds of math.</p>
<p>My area of research just ended up in here</p>
<p>because I met a really interesting PhD advisor,</p>
<p>potential, that&rsquo;s honestly the reason</p>
<p>I went into that direction.</p>
<p>I met a really interesting guy.</p>
<p>He seemed like he did good stuff, interesting stuff,</p>
<p>and he looked like he cared about students.</p>
<p>And I said, let me just go and learn whatever you do,</p>
<p>even though my prior practice and preparation</p>
<p>before my PhD was not combinatorics,</p>
<p>but analysis, the continuous stuff.</p>
<p>So the annoying thing about combinatorics</p>
<p>and discreet stuff is it&rsquo;s often really difficult to solve</p>
<p>from a sort of running time complexity perspective.</p>
<p>Could you speak to the idea of complexity analysis</p>
<p>of problems, do you find it useful, do you find it interesting?</p>
<p>Do you find that lens of studying the difficulty</p>
<p>of how difficult the computer science problem is</p>
<p>a useful lens onto the world?</p>
<p>Oh, very much so.</p>
<p>Because if you want to make something practical</p>
<p>which has large numbers of people using it,</p>
<p>the computational complexity to me is almost question one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, again, that&rsquo;s at the origin</p>
<p>of when we started doing this stuff with disease control.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, the deep questions</p>
<p>that were running through my mind were,</p>
<p>would we be able to support a large population</p>
<p>with only one server?</p>
<p>And if the answer is no, we can&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have enough money.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there the question is very much</p>
<p>linear time versus anything slower than linear time.</p>
<p>As a very specific thing, you have a bunch</p>
<p>of really interesting papers.</p>
<p>If I could ask, maybe we could pull out some cool insights</p>
<p>at the high level.</p>
<p>Can you describe the data structure of a voting tree</p>
<p>and what are some interesting results on it?</p>
<p>You have a paper that I noticed on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is an example of, I guess,</p>
<p>how in math we might say here&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>kind of a question that we just can&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to understand enough about.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s something else going on here.</p>
<p>And the way to describe this is you could imagine</p>
<p>trying to hold elections where if you have</p>
<p>only two candidates, that&rsquo;s kind of easy.</p>
<p>You just run them against each other</p>
<p>and see who gets more votes.</p>
<p>But as you know, once you have more candidates,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to decide who wins the election.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an entire voting theory around this.</p>
<p>So a theoretical question became,</p>
<p>what if you made like a system of runoffs,</p>
<p>like a system of head to head contests,</p>
<p>which is structured like a tree,</p>
<p>almost looking like a circuit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using that way of thinking because it&rsquo;s sort of like</p>
<p>in electrical engineering or computer science,</p>
<p>you might imagine having a bunch of leads</p>
<p>that carry signal, which are going through AND gates</p>
<p>and OR gates and whatnot.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve managed to compute beautiful things.</p>
<p>This is just from a purely abstract point of view.</p>
<p>What if the inputs are candidates?</p>
<p>And for every two candidates, it is known</p>
<p>which of the candidates is more popular than the other.</p>
<p>Now can you build some kind of a circuit board</p>
<p>which says, first candidate number four</p>
<p>will play against five and see who wins and so on.</p>
<p>Okay, so now what would be a nice outcome, right?</p>
<p>This is a general question of,</p>
<p>could I make a big circuit board to feed an election into?</p>
<p>Like maybe one nice outcome would be whoever wins</p>
<p>at least is preferred over a lot of people.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So for example, if you ran in 1,024 candidates,</p>
<p>ideally we would like a guarantee that says</p>
<p>that the winner beats a lot of people.</p>
<p>Actually in any system where there are 1,024 candidates,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always a candidate who beats</p>
<p>at least 512 of the others.</p>
<p>This is a mathematical fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s actually always a person who beats</p>
<p>at least half of the other people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make sense of that mathematical fact.</p>
<p>Is this supposed to be obvious?</p>
<p>No, but I can explain it.</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The way it works is that, think of it this way.</p>
<p>Every time I think, imagine I have all these candidates</p>
<p>and everyone is competing,</p>
<p>everyone is like compared with everyone else at some point.</p>
<p>Well, think of it this way.</p>
<p>Whenever there&rsquo;s a comparison, somebody gets a point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one who is better than the other one.</p>
<p>My claim is there&rsquo;s somebody whose score</p>
<p>is at least half of how many other people there are.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m just trying to,</p>
<p>like my intuition is very close to that being true,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t at first, that&rsquo;s not an obvious fact.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And it feels like a beautiful fact.</p>
<p>Well, let me explain it this way.</p>
<p>Imagine that for every match,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t give one point, but you gave two points.</p>
<p>You gave one point to each person.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re really doing.</p>
<p>We really want to give one point to the winner of the match,</p>
<p>but instead we&rsquo;ll just give two.</p>
<p>If you gave two points to everyone on every matchup,</p>
<p>actually everyone has the same number of points.</p>
<p>And the number of points they get</p>
<p>is how many other people there are.</p>
<p>Does that sort of make sense?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like saying.</p>
<p>No, no, everything you&rsquo;re saying makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>So the point is if for every comparison between two people,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m doing for every two people,</p>
<p>I gave one point to each person,</p>
<p>your score, everyone&rsquo;s score is the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how many other people there are.</p>
<p>Now we only make one change.</p>
<p>For each matchup, you give one point only to the winner.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re awarding half the points.</p>
<p>So now the deal is if in the original situation,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s score was equal,</p>
<p>which is how many other people there are.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s only half the number of points to go around.</p>
<p>So what ends up happening is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always going to be,</p>
<p>like the average number of points per person</p>
<p>is going to be half of how many other people there are.</p>
<p>And somebody is gonna be above average.</p>
<p>Somebody is going to be above that.</p>
<p>At least average.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is this notion of expected value,</p>
<p>that if I have a random variable,</p>
<p>which has an expected value,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be some possibility</p>
<p>in the probability space</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re at least as big as the expected value.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you describe it like that, it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re first saying in this little circuit</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s going to be one candidate better than half,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>Math, this is nice.</p>
<p>Okay, so you have this,</p>
<p>but ultimately you&rsquo;re trying to with a voting tree,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re trying this,</p>
<p>but to have a circuit that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;d like it to be small.</p>
<p>That achieves the same kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, the smaller it is,</p>
<p>if we look at practically speaking,</p>
<p>the lower the cost of running the election,</p>
<p>of running through, of computing the circuit.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>But actually at this point,</p>
<p>the reason the question was interesting</p>
<p>is because there was no good guarantee</p>
<p>that the winner of that circuit</p>
<p>would have like have beaten a lot of people.</p>
<p>Let me give an example.</p>
<p>The best known circuit,</p>
<p>when we started thinking about this,</p>
<p>was the circuit called candidate one</p>
<p>plays against candidate two,</p>
<p>candidate three plays against four,</p>
<p>and then the winners play against each other.</p>
<p>And then by the way, five plays against six,</p>
<p>seven against eight, the winners play against each other.</p>
<p>You understand, it&rsquo;s like a giant binary tree.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a binary, like a balanced binary tree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a balanced binary tree.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, up to 1,024,</p>
<p>everyone going up to find the winner.</p>
<p>Well, you know what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a system in the world</p>
<p>where it could just be</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a candidate called number one,</p>
<p>that just beats like 10 other people,</p>
<p>just the 10 that they need to be on their way up</p>
<p>and they lose to everyone else.</p>
<p>But somehow they would get all the way up.</p>
<p>My point is it is possible to outsmart that circuit</p>
<p>in one weird way of the world,</p>
<p>which makes that circuit a bad one</p>
<p>because you want to say,</p>
<p>I will use this circuit for all elections.</p>
<p>And you might have a system of inputs that go in there</p>
<p>where the winner only beat 10 other people,</p>
<p>which is the people they had to beat on the way up.</p>
<p>So you want to have a circuit where there&rsquo;s as many,</p>
<p>like the final result is as strong as possible.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so what ideas do you have for that?</p>
<p>So we actually only managed to improve it</p>
<p>to square root of N.</p>
<p>So if N is number of vertices,</p>
<p>N over two would be the ideal.</p>
<p>We got it to square root of N.</p>
<p>Versus log base two.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, that is halfway.</p>
<p>It could be a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Could be a big improvement.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a, okay, cool.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say with words</p>
<p>about what kind of circuit, what that looks like?</p>
<p>I can give an idea of one of the tools inside,</p>
<p>but the actual execution ends up being more complicated.</p>
<p>But one of the widgets inside this</p>
<p>is building a system where you have like a candidate</p>
<p>who plays, like one part of the whole huge, huge tree</p>
<p>is that that same candidate, let&rsquo;s call them seven.</p>
<p>Seven plays against somebody,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make up some numbers.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call the others like letters.</p>
<p>So seven plays against A.</p>
<p>Seven&rsquo;s also gonna play against B separately.</p>
<p>And the winners of each of those will play each other.</p>
<p>By the way, seven&rsquo;s also gonna play C.</p>
<p>Seven&rsquo;s gonna play D.</p>
<p>And the winners are gonna play each other.</p>
<p>We call this seven against all.</p>
<p>Well, seven against like everyone from a bunch of.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some nice overlap between the matchups</p>
<p>that somehow has a nice feature to it.</p>
<p>Yes, and I can tell you the nice feature</p>
<p>because if at the base of this giant tree,</p>
<p>at the base of this giant circuit,</p>
<p>like this is a widget.</p>
<p>We build the things out of widgets.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just describing one widget.</p>
<p>But in the base of this widget,</p>
<p>you have lots of things which are seven against someone,</p>
<p>seven against someone, seven against someone.</p>
<p>In fact, every matchup at the bottom</p>
<p>is seven against someone.</p>
<p>What that means is</p>
<p>if seven actually beat everyone they were matched up against,</p>
<p>well, seven would rise to the top.</p>
<p>So one possibility is if you see a seven</p>
<p>emerge from the top,</p>
<p>you know that seven actually beat everyone</p>
<p>they were against.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if anyone else is on top,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it F.</p>
<p>If F is on top, how did F get there?</p>
<p>Well, F beat seven on the way at the beginning.</p>
<p>So the point is the outcome of this circuit</p>
<p>has a certain property.</p>
<p>If you see a seven,</p>
<p>you know that the seven actually beat a person</p>
<p>but the seven actually beat a bazillion people.</p>
<p>If you see anyone else,</p>
<p>at least you know they beat seven.</p>
<p>Yeah, then you can prove that it has a nice property.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say,</p>
<p>perhaps going completely outside</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>is how we may</p>
<p>have mathematical ideas</p>
<p>of improving the electoral process?</p>
<p>That one, no.</p>
<p>No, I can&rsquo;t give you that one.</p>
<p>I mean, is there, like, do you ever see it as,</p>
<p>do you see as there being a lot of opportunities</p>
<p>for improving how we vote?</p>
<p>Like from your, I don&rsquo;t know if you saw parallels,</p>
<p>but, you know, it seems like if,</p>
<p>this actually kind of maps to your sort of COVID work,</p>
<p>which is there&rsquo;s a network effect, right?</p>
<p>It seems like we should be able to apply similar kind</p>
<p>of effects of how we decide other things in our lives.</p>
<p>And one of the big decisions we&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>is who represents us in government.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about like mathematically</p>
<p>about those kinds of systems?</p>
<p>I think a little bit about those,</p>
<p>because where I went to college,</p>
<p>the way we voted for student government</p>
<p>was based on this, is it called ranked choice?</p>
<p>Where you eliminate the bottom</p>
<p>and there was runoff elections.</p>
<p>So that was the first time I ever saw that.</p>
<p>And I thought that made sense.</p>
<p>The only problem is it doesn&rsquo;t seem so easy</p>
<p>to get something that makes sense adopted</p>
<p>as the new voting system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole nother, that&rsquo;s not a math solution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, well, it&rsquo;s math in the sense that it&rsquo;s game theory.</p>
<p>So you have to come up with incentive,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mechanism design.</p>
<p>You have to figure out how to trick us</p>
<p>despite our basic human nature</p>
<p>to adopt solutions that are better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole nother conversation, I think.</p>
<p>Can you just, cause it sounded really cool,</p>
<p>talk a little bit about stochastic coalescence</p>
<p>and you have a paper on showing that,</p>
<p>so you could describe what it is,</p>
<p>but I guess it&rsquo;s a super linear, super logarithmic time</p>
<p>and you came up with some kind of trick</p>
<p>that make it faster.</p>
<p>Can you just talk about it a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this was something which came up</p>
<p>when I was at Microsoft Research for a summer.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m putting that context because that shows</p>
<p>that it has some practical motivation at some point.</p>
<p>Actually, I think it&rsquo;s still.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p>It can be beautiful and it&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the easiest way to describe this is</p>
<p>suppose you got like a big crowd of people</p>
<p>and everybody knows how many hours of sleep</p>
<p>they got last night.</p>
<p>And you wanna know how many total hours of sleep</p>
<p>were gotten by this big crowd of people.</p>
<p>At the beginning, you might say,</p>
<p>that sounds like a linear time algorithm</p>
<p>of saying, hey, how many hours you got?</p>
<p>How many you got?</p>
<p>Add, add, add.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a way to do this</p>
<p>if you remember that there are people</p>
<p>and they presumably know how to add.</p>
<p>You could make a distributed algorithm</p>
<p>to make this happen.</p>
<p>For example, while we&rsquo;re thinking of these trees,</p>
<p>imagine you had 1,024 people.</p>
<p>If you could just say, hey, person number one</p>
<p>and person number two, you will add your hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Person number two will go away</p>
<p>and person number one is gonna remember the sum.</p>
<p>Person three and four add up</p>
<p>and person three takes charge of remembering it.</p>
<p>Person four goes away.</p>
<p>Now this like person one knows the sum of these two.</p>
<p>Person three knows the sum of those two.</p>
<p>They talk.</p>
<p>You see what I mean?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going up this tree,</p>
<p>same tree that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Built up a tree from the bottom up.</p>
<p>Yeah, build up a tree from the bottom up.</p>
<p>And the beautiful thing is</p>
<p>since everyone&rsquo;s doing stuff in parallel,</p>
<p>the amount of time it takes to get the total sum</p>
<p>is actually just the number of layers in the tree,</p>
<p>which is 10.</p>
<p>So now that&rsquo;s logarithmic time</p>
<p>to add up the number of hours that people slept today.</p>
<p>Sounds fantastic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one problem.</p>
<p>How do you decide who&rsquo;s person number one</p>
<p>and person number two?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So if, for example, you just went out into the downtown</p>
<p>and said, hey, get these thousand people, go.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re gonna go and say,</p>
<p>and by the way, you&rsquo;re one and you&rsquo;re two and you&rsquo;re three,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s linear time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cheating.</p>
<p>So now the question is how to do this</p>
<p>in a distributed way.</p>
<p>And there were some people who proposed</p>
<p>a very elegant algorithm and they wanted to analyze it.</p>
<p>So I came in onto the analyze side,</p>
<p>but the elegant algorithm was like this.</p>
<p>It was like, well, we don&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>what this big tree is.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t any big tree.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s gonna happen is first,</p>
<p>everyone is going to decide right now.</p>
<p>Oh, one important thing.</p>
<p>Everyone is going to,</p>
<p>at the very beginning of the whole game,</p>
<p>they will have delegated responsibility to themselves</p>
<p>as the one who knows the sum so far.</p>
<p>So the point is there&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>people are all gonna have like a pointer which says,</p>
<p>you are the one who knows my,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve taken care of my ticket, my number.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the representative for this particular piece</p>
<p>of knowledge.</p>
<p>And at the very beginning, you&rsquo;re your own representative.</p>
<p>The thing has to start simple, right?</p>
<p>So at the beginning, you&rsquo;re your own representative.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pointing to yourself, got it.</p>
<p>Yup, yup.</p>
<p>And now the way this works is that at every time step,</p>
<p>someone blares a ding dong on the town clock or whatever.</p>
<p>And each person flips a coin themselves to decide,</p>
<p>am I going to hunt for somebody to give my number to</p>
<p>and let them represent me?</p>
<p>Or am I going to sit here and wait for someone to come?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, they flipped their coin.</p>
<p>Some of the people start asking other people saying,</p>
<p>hey, I would like you to be my representative.</p>
<p>Here is my number.</p>
<p>But the problem is that there&rsquo;s limited bandwidth</p>
<p>of the people who are getting asked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you can&rsquo;t get,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t go out to prom with five people.</p>
<p>But this is not what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re adding numbers, okay?</p>
<p>But you can only add one number.</p>
<p>So the person who has suddenly gotten asked</p>
<p>by all these people,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;ll have to decide who they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to take it from.</p>
<p>And they randomly just choose one.</p>
<p>When they randomly choose one,</p>
<p>all the others are rejected</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t get to delegate anything in that round.</p>
<p>But now if this person has absorbed this one who said,</p>
<p>okay, here, you take charge of my number.</p>
<p>This person now updates their pointer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in charge.</p>
<p>And this person adds the two numbers.</p>
<p>That was the first round.</p>
<p>In the next round, when they do the coin flipping,</p>
<p>this person doesn&rsquo;t flip anymore</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just delegating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that anyone who has the pointers themselves,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a person who is in charge</p>
<p>of some number of informations,</p>
<p>they flip the coin to decide,</p>
<p>should I find other people who are agents?</p>
<p>Or should I wait for people to ask me?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>This is somebody else&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>And then now the idea is, okay,</p>
<p>if you just keep doing this process,</p>
<p>what ends up happening?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and also by the way,</p>
<p>if you decide that you want to go reach out</p>
<p>to other people, here&rsquo;s the catch.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re one of these agents saying,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m going to go look for someone.</p>
<p>You have no idea who in this crowd is an agent</p>
<p>or somebody who delegated it to someone else.</p>
<p>You just pick a random person.</p>
<p>When you pick the random person,</p>
<p>if it lands on someone and the person says,</p>
<p>oh, I actually delegated it to someone,</p>
<p>then you follow the point.</p>
<p>You walk up the delegation chain.</p>
<p>Walk up the delegation chain.</p>
<p>And you can do like path compression in the algorithm</p>
<p>to make it so you don&rsquo;t consistently</p>
<p>do lots of walking up.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is that what ends up happening</p>
<p>is that you end up reaching out.</p>
<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re one of the ones reaching out,</p>
<p>you can think of it as each agent is responsible</p>
<p>for some number of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re the leader of a bunch.</p>
<p>As the process is evolving, you have these lumps.</p>
<p>Each lump has an agent.</p>
<p>And when the agent reaches out,</p>
<p>they reach out to another lump</p>
<p>where the probability of them hitting that lump</p>
<p>is proportional to the size of the lump.</p>
<p>That is the one funny thing about this process.</p>
<p>This is not that they can reach out</p>
<p>to a uniformly random lump</p>
<p>where every lump has the same chance</p>
<p>of getting reached out to.</p>
<p>The bigger the lump is,</p>
<p>the more likely it is that you end up reaching that lump.</p>
<p>Which is a problem?</p>
<p>Let me explain why that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Because you see, you&rsquo;re hoping</p>
<p>that this has a small number of steps,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s a bad situation that could happen.</p>
<p>Imagine if you had like,</p>
<p>there are n people that you&rsquo;re adding up.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have exactly square root of n lumps left,</p>
<p>of which almost all of them are just one person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s still their own boss, their own manager.</p>
<p>Except one giant one.</p>
<p>Now what&rsquo;s gonna happen?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a huge bottleneck</p>
<p>because every round the giant one</p>
<p>can only absorb one of the others.</p>
<p>And now you suddenly have time</p>
<p>which is about square root of n.</p>
<p>The square root of n is chosen</p>
<p>because that is one where the lumps are such</p>
<p>that you really are limited by this large one</p>
<p>slowly sucking up the rest of them.</p>
<p>So the heart of the question became,</p>
<p>well, but is that just so unusual</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t usually happen?</p>
<p>Because remember you start with everyone</p>
<p>just being independent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a lot of lumps of size one.</p>
<p>How naturally do the big lumps emerge?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so what that heart of the proof was,</p>
<p>was showing that that was a joint work with Eyal Lubezki.</p>
<p>That one was showing that actually in that thing</p>
<p>the lumps do kind of get out of whack.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not the purely logarithmic number of steps.</p>
<p>But if you make one very slight change,</p>
<p>which is if you are one of the agents</p>
<p>and you have just been propositioned,</p>
<p>possibly relayed along by a couple of different people.</p>
<p>If you just say, don&rsquo;t take a random one,</p>
<p>but accept the smallest lump.</p>
<p>That actually does enough to even the whole economy.</p>
<p>Distributes the lump size.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating how</p>
<p>with the distributed algorithms,</p>
<p>a little adjustment can make all the difference</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, by the way, this does,</p>
<p>back to our voting conversation,</p>
<p>this makes me think of like,</p>
<p>these networking systems are so fascinating to study.</p>
<p>They immediately spring to mind ideas</p>
<p>of how to have representation.</p>
<p>Like maybe as opposed to me voting for a president,</p>
<p>I want to vote for like,</p>
<p>for you, Paul, to represent me,</p>
<p>maybe on a particular issue.</p>
<p>And then you will delegate that further.</p>
<p>And then we naturally construct those kinds of networks</p>
<p>because that feels like I can have a good conversation</p>
<p>with you and figure out that you know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and I can delegate it to you.</p>
<p>And in that way, construct a representative government,</p>
<p>a representative decision maker.</p>
<p>That feels really nice as opposed to like us,</p>
<p>like a tree of height one or something,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like everybody&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>it feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of room for layers</p>
<p>of representation to form organically from the bottom up.</p>
<p>I wonder if there are systems like that.</p>
<p>This is the cool thing about the internet</p>
<p>and the digital space where we&rsquo;re so well connected,</p>
<p>just like with the Novid app to distribute information</p>
<p>about the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>We can in the same way, in a distributed sense,</p>
<p>form anything like any kind of knowledge bases</p>
<p>that are formed in a decentralized way</p>
<p>and in a hierarchical way,</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of old way</p>
<p>where there is no mechanism for large scale,</p>
<p>fast distributed transactional information.</p>
<p>This is really interesting.</p>
<p>This is where almost like network graph theory,</p>
<p>becomes practical.</p>
<p>Most of that exciting work was done in the 20th century,</p>
<p>but most of the application will be in the 21st,</p>
<p>which is cool to think about.</p>
<p>Let me ask the most ridiculous question.</p>
<p>You think P equals NP?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I would say,</p>
<p>I know there are enough people who have very strong interest</p>
<p>in trying to show that it is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about government agencies.</p>
<p>For security purposes.</p>
<p>And most computer scientists,</p>
<p>we should say believe that P equals NP.</p>
<p>My question almost like,</p>
<p>this is back to our aliens discussion.</p>
<p>You want to think outside the box,</p>
<p>the low probability event,</p>
<p>what is the world,</p>
<p>what kind of discoveries would lead us to prove</p>
<p>that P does not equal to NP?</p>
<p>Like there could be giant misunderstandings</p>
<p>or gaps in our knowledge about computer science,</p>
<p>about theoretical computer science, about computation,</p>
<p>which allow us to think like flatten all problems.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don&rsquo;t know the answer to this question.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very interesting, but I actually,</p>
<p>I know, let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>By being at Carnegie Mellon</p>
<p>and being around the theoretical computer scientists,</p>
<p>I know enough about what I don&rsquo;t know to say.</p>
<p>To be humble.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the wrong person to answer this question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great one.</p>
<p>Well, Scott Aaronson, who&rsquo;s now here at UT Austin,</p>
<p>he used to be at MIT,</p>
<p>puts the probability of P not equals to NP at 3%.</p>
<p>I always love it when you ask,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very rare in science and academics</p>
<p>because most folks are humble</p>
<p>in the face of the mystery,</p>
<p>the uncertainty of everything around us.</p>
<p>To have both the humor and the guts to say like,</p>
<p>what are the chance that there&rsquo;s aliens in our galaxy,</p>
<p>intelligent alien civilizations?</p>
<p>As opposed to saying, I don&rsquo;t know, it could be zero.</p>
<p>It could be, depending on the fact, you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s 2.5%.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something very pleasant about just having,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the number thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s powered to the number.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like 42.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why 42?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s a powerful number.</p>
<p>And then everything,</p>
<p>this is the power of human psychology</p>
<p>is once you have the number 42,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that the number has meaning,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s placed in a book with humor around it,</p>
<p>it has the meme effect of actually creating reality.</p>
<p>I mean, you could say that 42 has a strong contribution</p>
<p>of helping us colonize Mars</p>
<p>because it created,</p>
<p>it gave the whatever existential crisis to many of us,</p>
<p>including Elon Musk when he was young,</p>
<p>reading a book like that.</p>
<p>And then now 42 is now part of his humor</p>
<p>that he doesn&rsquo;t shut up about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s constantly joking about.</p>
<p>And that humor is spreading through our minds</p>
<p>and somehow this like silly number just had an effect.</p>
<p>In that same way, after Scott told me like the 3% chance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stuck in my head.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s been having a ripple effect</p>
<p>in everybody else.</p>
<p>The believing that P is not equal to NP,</p>
<p>Scott almost as a joke saying it&rsquo;s 3%</p>
<p>is actually motivating a large number of researchers</p>
<p>to work on it.</p>
<p>3% is high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very high.</p>
<p>Because for the potential impact that that would have.</p>
<p>But then 3% is not that high because it&rsquo;s only,</p>
<p>you know, like we&rsquo;re not very good.</p>
<p>I feel like humans are only able to really think about</p>
<p>like 1%, 50%.</p>
<p>And we kind of, I think a lot of people around 3%</p>
<p>up to 50% like in our minds.</p>
<p>Like 3% at this point.</p>
<p>It could happen.</p>
<p>And it could happen and it&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>Like half the time it&rsquo;ll probably happen.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not very good at that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing with the pandemic</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re not the exponential growth</p>
<p>that we also talked about offline</p>
<p>is something that we can&rsquo;t quite intuit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something we probably should</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re to predict the future, to anticipate the future</p>
<p>and to understand how to create technologies</p>
<p>that let us sort of control the future.</p>
<p>Can I ask you for some recommendations</p>
<p>maybe for books or movies in your life?</p>
<p>Long ago when you were baby Po or today</p>
<p>that you found insightful or you learned a lot from</p>
<p>what you would recommend to others.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I think I don&rsquo;t necessarily have an exact name</p>
<p>of these old things, but I was generally inspired</p>
<p>by stories, true or fictional of campaigns.</p>
<p>For example, like the Lord of the rings, that&rsquo;s a campaign.</p>
<p>But the thing that always inspired me was</p>
<p>it could be possible for somebody who&rsquo;s crazy enough</p>
<p>to go up against adversity after adversity,</p>
<p>and it succeeds.</p>
<p>I mean, those are false, those are fictitious.</p>
<p>But I also spent a lot of time, I guess, reading about,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I was interested somehow</p>
<p>in like World War II history for whatever reason.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a campaign which is much more brutal.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, the idea of difficulty, strategy,</p>
<p>fighting even when things,</p>
<p>in that case it was really fighting,</p>
<p>but just pushing on even when things are difficult.</p>
<p>I guess these are the kinds of general stories</p>
<p>that made me, I guess, want to work on things</p>
<p>that would be hard and where it could be a campaign.</p>
<p>It could be that you work on something for a year,</p>
<p>multiple years, because that was the point, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, it starts with a single person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the interesting thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve obviously been, don&rsquo;t shut up about it recently</p>
<p>about World War II, especially on the Hitler side</p>
<p>and the Stalin side.</p>
<p>Some of that has really affected my own family.</p>
<p>The roots of my family very much.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to think that it was just an idea</p>
<p>and one person decided to do stuff</p>
<p>and it just builds and builds and builds.</p>
<p>And you can truly have an impact on the world,</p>
<p>both horrendous and exceptionally positive and inspiring.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a agency of us individuals.</p>
<p>Sometimes we think we&rsquo;re just reacting to the world,</p>
<p>but we have the full power to actually change the world.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give to young folks?</p>
<p>We talked, we gave a bunch of advice</p>
<p>on middle school, high school mathematics.</p>
<p>Is there more general advice you would give</p>
<p>about how to succeed in life,</p>
<p>how to learn for high school students,</p>
<p>for college students, career or life in general?</p>
<p>So I think the first one would be</p>
<p>to make sure that you&rsquo;re learning to invent</p>
<p>and to make sure you&rsquo;re not just learning how to mimic.</p>
<p>Because a lot of times you learn how to do X</p>
<p>by watching somebody do X and then repeating X</p>
<p>many times with different inputs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just been very generic in explaining this.</p>
<p>But I guess this is just my own attitude towards the world.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like ever following anyone&rsquo;s directions exactly.</p>
<p>Even if you told me this is the way to do your homework</p>
<p>is to write in pencil, I would say,</p>
<p>but I think pen is nice, let&rsquo;s try, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been that kind of a funny person.</p>
<p>But I do encourage that if you can learn how to invent</p>
<p>as your core skill, then you can do a lot.</p>
<p>But then the second piece that comes with that</p>
<p>is something I learned from my PhD advisor,</p>
<p>which was, well, make sure that what you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>is big enough.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, I usually advise to people</p>
<p>once they have learned how to invent,</p>
<p>ideally don&rsquo;t just try to settle for something comfortable,</p>
<p>try to see if you can aim for something which is hard,</p>
<p>which might involve a campaign, which might be important,</p>
<p>which might make a difference.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more of, I guess, rather than worrying</p>
<p>what if you didn&rsquo;t achieve that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also the regret of what if I didn&rsquo;t try?</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s how I operate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t operate based on did I succeed or fail?</p>
<p>It was hard anyway.</p>
<p>If I did this novid thing and the whole thing failed,</p>
<p>would I feel terrible?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a very hard problem.</p>
<p>But would I have had the regret of not jumping in?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that different mentality of don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about the failing part as much of the,</p>
<p>make sure you give yourself the shot</p>
<p>at those potentially unbounded opportunities.</p>
<p>You almost make it sound like there&rsquo;s a meaning to it all.</p>
<p>Let me ask the big ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Or maybe the easier version of that</p>
<p>is what brings your life joy?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just answer that one personally.</p>
<p>For me, I&rsquo;m a little bit weird.</p>
<p>I sort of, I guess you can tell by now.</p>
<p>See the pen and pencil discussion from earlier, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, my thing is, I guess I personally</p>
<p>just wanted to maximize a certain score,</p>
<p>which was for how many person years</p>
<p>after I&rsquo;m no longer here anymore,</p>
<p>did what I do mattered?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s necessarily attributed to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, did it matter?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I wanted.</p>
<p>I guess that is very inspired by how scientists work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why do we keep talking about Newton?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because Newton discovered some interesting things.</p>
<p>And so Newton&rsquo;s score is pretty high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be infinity, right?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s infinity, but pretty high.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going for, so person years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going for like triple digits.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going for, so like Newton is like four digits,</p>
<p>probably like a thousand years or personal lifetimes.</p>
<p>How do you like to think, well, what are we?</p>
<p>Sorry, I meant people times years.</p>
<p>People times.</p>
<p>So then it&rsquo;s like, actually his is huge.</p>
<p>His is like going to be billions or trillions, trillions.</p>
<p>But I guess for me, I actually changed the metric</p>
<p>after a while.</p>
<p>And the reason is because you may have seen,</p>
<p>I found some simple way to solve quadratic equations</p>
<p>that is easier than every textbook.</p>
<p>So my score might already be not bad,</p>
<p>which is why I decided then let&rsquo;s change it</p>
<p>into the number of hours in the lifetimes as well.</p>
<p>So the way I was doing it before is that</p>
<p>if a person was sort of remembering or using</p>
<p>or appreciating what I had done</p>
<p>for like 10 years of their life.</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>That would count as 10.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So if there was one person who for 10 years remembered</p>
<p>or appreciated something I did,</p>
<p>that counts as a score of 10 and we add up overall people.</p>
<p>And then, and that was with the hypothesis</p>
<p>that the score would be very finite in the sense</p>
<p>that if I didn&rsquo;t come up with anything</p>
<p>that might potentially help a lot of generations</p>
<p>in a forever way, then your score will be finite</p>
<p>because at some point it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t remember that you made like nice bottles</p>
<p>or something, right?</p>
<p>But then after the quadratic equation thing,</p>
<p>it was that there&rsquo;s some chance</p>
<p>that that actually might make it into textbooks.</p>
<p>And if it makes it in textbooks,</p>
<p>the chance that there&rsquo;ll be an easier way discovered</p>
<p>is actually quite small.</p>
<p>So in that case, then the score might get bigger.</p>
<p>I was just saying the score might actually already</p>
<p>have been achieved in a non trivial way.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s fun to think about,</p>
<p>cause it could be different.</p>
<p>You can achieve a high score by a small number of people</p>
<p>using it for most of their lifetime</p>
<p>and then generations and generations.</p>
<p>Or you can have, if we do dissipate,</p>
<p>if we do split colonize, become multi planetary species,</p>
<p>you could have that little,</p>
<p>a clever way to solve differential equations,</p>
<p>spread through like trillions of people</p>
<p>as they spread throughout the galaxy.</p>
<p>And they would only use it each one,</p>
<p>a few hours in their lifetime,</p>
<p>but their kids will use it,</p>
<p>the kids of kids will use it, it will spread</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have that impact in that kind of way.</p>
<p>Yes, so that&rsquo;s why I renormalized it</p>
<p>because I was like, well, that&rsquo;s kind of dumb</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s the importance of that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll save people 15 minutes.</p>
<p>But, so what I meant is I didn&rsquo;t want to count that</p>
<p>as the main score.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m gonna have to try to come up</p>
<p>with some kind of device that everyone would want to use,</p>
<p>maybe to make coffee,</p>
<p>cause coffee seems to be the prevalent</p>
<p>performance enhancing chemical that everyone uses.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll have to think about those kinds of metrics.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you see that&rsquo;s just giving an idea</p>
<p>of I guess what I found meaningful in general,</p>
<p>like whether or not it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>whether or not that quadratic thing is important or not.</p>
<p>The general idea was I wanted to do things</p>
<p>that would outlast me.</p>
<p>And that was what inspired me</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just how I choose what problems to work on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a kind of immortality is ideas</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve invented living on long after you</p>
<p>in the minds of others.</p>
<p>And humans are ultimately not,</p>
<p>are like meat vehicles that carry ideas for brief</p>
<p>for just a few years may not be the important thing.</p>
<p>It might be the ideas that we carry with us</p>
<p>and invent new ones.</p>
<p>Like we get a bunch of baby ideas in our head.</p>
<p>We borrow them from others</p>
<p>and then maybe we invent a new one</p>
<p>and that new one might have a life of its own.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fun to think about that idea</p>
<p>of living for many centuries to come</p>
<p>unless we destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>But maybe AI will borrow it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll remember Po as like that one human</p>
<p>that helped us out before we of course killed him</p>
<p>and the rest of human civilization.</p>
<p>On that note, Po, this is a huge honor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the great educators</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever gotten a chance to interact with.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s truly an honor that you would talk with me today.</p>
<p>It means especially a lot that you would travel a lot</p>
<p>to Austin to talk to me.</p>
<p>It really means a lot.</p>
<p>So thank you so much.</p>
<p>Keep on inspiring.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m one of your many, many students.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a real honor for me to talk to you</p>
<p>and to get this chance to have this really</p>
<p>intellectual conversation through all of these topics.</p>
<p>Thanks, Po.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Po Chenlo</p>
<p>and thank you to Jordan Harmer, the show,</p>
<p>Onnit, BetterHelp, AidSleep and Element.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies</p>
<p>but not the madness of people.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
