Good afternoon everyone. I&amp;rsquo;m Ann Harrison.
I&amp;rsquo;m the Dean of the Haas School of Business.
Welcome to today&amp;rsquo;s Dean&amp;rsquo;s Speaker Series
cosponsored by the Berkeley Culture Initiative.
This is an incredible honor to introduce today&amp;rsquo;s speaker,
Indra Nooyi.
There is so much that I could say about Indra
as the first woman of color and immigrant
to run a Fortune 50 company,
Nooyi is certainly among
the world&amp;rsquo;s most admired business leaders.'>

    <p>(audience murmuring)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good afternoon everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Dean of the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series</p>
<p>cosponsored by the Berkeley Culture Initiative.</p>
<p>This is an incredible honor to introduce today&rsquo;s speaker,</p>
<p>Indra Nooyi.</p>
<p>There is so much that I could say about Indra</p>
<p>as the first woman of color and immigrant</p>
<p>to run a Fortune 50 company,</p>
<p>Nooyi is certainly among</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s most admired business leaders.</p>
<p>We are just so honored to have you here with us today.</p>
<p>As CEO of PepsiCo,</p>
<p>a role she served in from 2006 to 2019,</p>
<p>Indra was the chief architect of performance with purpose.</p>
<p>PepsiCo&rsquo;s pledge to do what&rsquo;s right for the business</p>
<p>by being responsive to the needs of the world around us.</p>
<p>This included limiting its environmental footprint</p>
<p>and empowering its associates and people</p>
<p>in the communities it serves.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, Indra directed</p>
<p>PepsiCo&rsquo;s global strategy and she led its transformation,</p>
<p>leading a number of mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming CEO,</p>
<p>she served as PepsiCo&rsquo;s President and CFO beginning in 2001</p>
<p>when she was also named to the company&rsquo;s board of directors.</p>
<p>Today Indra serves on a number of boards including Amazon,</p>
<p>Philips, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</p>
<p>and the Partnership for Public Service.</p>
<p>She has received, get this,</p>
<p>15 honorary degrees and numerous awards.</p>
<p>Including the government of India&rsquo;s Padma Bhushan,</p>
<p>one of the country&rsquo;s highest civilian honors.</p>
<p>In 2019, her portrait was inducted</p>
<p>into the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery.</p>
<p>Indra has been named to the top of more lists</p>
<p>than we have time to talk about today.</p>
<p>Forbes World&rsquo;s 100 Most Powerful Women,</p>
<p>Fortune&rsquo;s List of the Most Powerful Woman.</p>
<p>Forbes Most Powerful Moms and the list goes on.</p>
<p>In 2018, she was named one of the best CEOs in the world</p>
<p>by CEO World Magazine.</p>
<p>Today she stands strongly behind efforts to initiate policy</p>
<p>for family friendly workplace initiatives</p>
<p>and a care infrastructure that addresses the needs</p>
<p>of essential workers for whom</p>
<p>it is not possible to work from home.</p>
<p>Thank you so much Indra for taking the time to speak today.</p>
<p>I am so looking forward to this conversation</p>
<p>and a very special thank you for providing a copy</p>
<p>for everyone in the audience.</p>
<p>Can you all raise the book so she can see that you have it?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Indra] Oh thank you, thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>This.</p>
<ul>
<li>So the audience have your new book,</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;My Life in Full: Work, Family, and Our Future&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now going to turn the conversation</p>
<p>over to Jenny Chapman and Samir Srivastava</p>
<p>who are the codirectors of the Berkeley Culture Initiative</p>
<p>and who will lead today&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you Ann and good afternoon everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see you.</p>
<p>This is a really lovely day for me.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be an Indra Nooyi groupie</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve tracked her career for awhile.</p>
<p>I hope this won&rsquo;t make you creeped out, but.</p>
<p>And I talk about her career and her leadership all the time</p>
<p>in my executive leadership classes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really a wonderful experience</p>
<p>to have a chance to interact with her directly.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m gonna do</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m gonna dive into the questions.</p>
<p>Samir and I are gonna trade off in asking questions</p>
<p>and at the last part of the hour,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to invite a couple of audience members</p>
<p>to ask questions.</p>
<p>Our first question really starts at the beginning</p>
<p>of your book really which is you know,</p>
<p>you moved from India to pursue an MBA</p>
<p>at the Yale School of Management and I&rsquo;m interested</p>
<p>in how your early childhood experiences</p>
<p>effected your motivation to do that</p>
<p>and how you thought that,</p>
<p>how you identified that as a possible path</p>
<p>and then additionally, what was the biggest surprise for you</p>
<p>in moving to the U.S.?</p>
<ul>
<li>Jenny and Samir, thank you for hosting me</li>
</ul>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a privilege to be at the Haas School.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading all the rankings and the writeups</p>
<p>of all the business schools and I must tell you,</p>
<p>the Haas School is, flag is flying very, very high.</p>
<p>So thank you for inviting me to speak to your students.</p>
<p>In many ways, people who read my book say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I can see myself in your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so I have a story that&rsquo;s very common</p>
<p>for people who grew up in the time that I did.</p>
<p>At the same time, they go,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come you were allowed to do as much</p>
<p>&ldquo;as you accomplished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So let me talk about both.</p>
<p>In many ways, I grew up in a very traditional,</p>
<p>conservative south Indian household in the 50s and 60s.</p>
<p>Because I was born eight years after independence</p>
<p>and the remarkable thing about my growing up</p>
<p>and where I won the lottery of life</p>
<p>was that I was born into a family</p>
<p>where the men in the household believed</p>
<p>women should be allowed to study</p>
<p>and do whatever they wanted to do.</p>
<p>And even more,</p>
<p>they kept pushing and prodding us to dream big, to soar,</p>
<p>to imagine anything you wanted to be</p>
<p>because they were gonna make it happen for you.</p>
<p>Now you would expect that the mother of the household,</p>
<p>you know in typical homes the mother is very strong</p>
<p>would put an end to all this and say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m gonna get the girls married off at age 18.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was a normal marriageable age.</p>
<p>My mother was conflicted.</p>
<p>She would&rsquo;ve loved to have been a CEO herself</p>
<p>if she knew what it was</p>
<p>but she wasn&rsquo;t even given the opportunity to go to college.</p>
<p>And so on the one hand,</p>
<p>she had her foot on the brake which said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gotta get you guys married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand,</p>
<p>she had her foot on the accelerator which said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey why don&rsquo;t you dream and soar</p>
<p>&ldquo;and do whatever you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I think that heavier foot on the accelerator</p>
<p>from three people allowed me and my sister</p>
<p>to actually do whatever we wanted.</p>
<p>My sister took a very traditional path</p>
<p>of being a great student.</p>
<p>I was a decent student but I did wild things</p>
<p>like playing in the women&rsquo;s cricket team and climbing trees</p>
<p>and playing in a rock band and doing all that stuff.</p>
<p>The interesting thing was in our family,</p>
<p>nobody knew what business was.</p>
<p>Nobody knew what it was.</p>
<p>So everybody was either an engineer or a lawyer</p>
<p>or a doctor or worked for the government</p>
<p>and that was a dream career.</p>
<p>Nine to five job, weekends off.</p>
<p>You have a steady paycheck</p>
<p>and then my sister gets admitted</p>
<p>to one of the best business schools in India</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden, life changes</p>
<p>because if she went to that business school,</p>
<p>I had to go to another business school</p>
<p>because otherwise I don&rsquo;t want to be viewed</p>
<p>as the failed sibling.</p>
<p>So this inter-sibling rivalry</p>
<p>pushed me to do other things and then you know,</p>
<p>one thing led to another.</p>
<p>I went to business school in India when I was too young.</p>
<p>I graduated from business school in India when I was 20</p>
<p>which is impossible to mature.</p>
<p>So I worked in India for two years</p>
<p>and then watched how business</p>
<p>and society interacted constantly and how we are losing</p>
<p>that whole societal issues when we teach business</p>
<p>and Yale had just opened its Business School</p>
<p>to the Masters in Public and Private Management</p>
<p>and I applied on a whim knowing that I wouldn&rsquo;t get in</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t have money to go.</p>
<p>And somehow I got admitted and got a bunch of loans</p>
<p>and scholarships and the rest is history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great, thank you Indra.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I want to fast forward now to a later point in your life.</p>
<p>One that many people here in the room can relate to</p>
<p>which is when you were at the Yale School of Management</p>
<p>and you were interviewing for summer internships</p>
<p>and at the time Indra</p>
<p>was under some significant budget constraints</p>
<p>and had to go shopping for clothes</p>
<p>and just on the budget she had,</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t put together an appropriate outfit</p>
<p>for interviewing and for the job.</p>
<p>So she ended up wearing a sari</p>
<p>for that entire summer internship</p>
<p>and was the only person in the office dressed that way.</p>
<p>So thinking about that story Indra</p>
<p>which really stuck in my mind in reading your book,</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you to comment a little bit</p>
<p>about how you navigated the tension</p>
<p>between trying to fit in to corporate life in America</p>
<p>but also standing out and being true to yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well it was interesting</li>
</ul>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an important part of the story.</p>
<p>I bought a really god-awful pantsuit</p>
<p>which in retrospect was just so bad but that&rsquo;s all I knew.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I had the financial resources for</p>
<p>and I showed up in the interview room</p>
<p>with all the people dressed in brilliant business clothes</p>
<p>and everybody had a sartorial seizure</p>
<p>because they couldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that somebody could walk in dressed the way I did</p>
<p>and I conducted myself</p>
<p>with great confidence in the interview.</p>
<p>The first interview I was in</p>
<p>and I was sure I wouldn&rsquo;t get the job.</p>
<p>I came out crying and I spoke to the development office</p>
<p>and I said, &ldquo;Why is everybody laughing at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;Have you looked yourself in the mirror?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Well, this is all I have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all the money I had,</p>
<p>&ldquo;nobody taught me how to buy clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because those days there was no support system</p>
<p>for international students and she said to me, she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, what would you wear in India</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you were going to an interview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d wear a sari and I have a whole bunch of saris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;You know go ahead and wear the sari</p>
<p>&ldquo;to your next interview</p>
<p>&ldquo;and if they can&rsquo;t hire you for who you are,</p>
<p>&ldquo;then it&rsquo;s their loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next day I had an interview with Booz Allen Hamilton,</p>
<p>I wore a sari and the funny part is I got the job.</p>
<p>The first job I interviewed for</p>
<p>with those god-awful clothes, I got that job.</p>
<p>And I got the consulting job too.</p>
<p>So you know this again showed</p>
<p>I had come to a new environment</p>
<p>of meritocracy if you want to call it that.</p>
<p>So when I was doing my summer job in good ol&rsquo; Chicago,</p>
<p>I had no money to buy clothes.</p>
<p>Because you have to get a paycheck to buy clothes.</p>
<p>And I still didn&rsquo;t know how to go shopping for clothes.</p>
<p>So I wore saris through the entire summer job</p>
<p>and I actually declined to go visit the client</p>
<p>because I said the client was in Indianapolis</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t want to create any jarring moment</p>
<p>where they focused on this exotic being</p>
<p>walking in with a sari.</p>
<p>So I chose to do all the work from the office</p>
<p>and let the rest of the team go off and meet the client</p>
<p>and I think the key thing Samir is,</p>
<p>I was drawing attention to the work I was doing</p>
<p>rather than how I was dressed and where I came from</p>
<p>or what I looked like or how I sounded.</p>
<p>I said those are all immaterial, I can change those things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just focus on the work</p>
<p>and as long as I do a good job on the core assignment,</p>
<p>forget everything else.</p>
<p>And I must give credit to Booz Allen</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the way they treated me.</p>
<p>I was the only person in, as they put it, costume</p>
<p>in the entire Chicago office and not once</p>
<p>did one person ask me any uncomfortable questions</p>
<p>or make me feel bad.</p>
<p>They really, truly were inclusive</p>
<p>and included me in every meeting in the office</p>
<p>and treated me like one of their own.</p>
<ul>
<li>So on the topic of inclusiveness which is a big one</li>
</ul>
<p>and I think our students are feeling the weight</p>
<p>and the heaviness of needing really to,</p>
<p>to become leaders of inclusive environments</p>
<p>which is not straightforward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very complex undertaking.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for business leaders</p>
<p>in terms of creating inclusive environments</p>
<p>where all people feel that they have a seat at the table?</p>
<ul>
<li>No I think you&rsquo;ve gotta look at this whole issue</li>
</ul>
<p>as a go for talent rather than saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to hire for quotas</p>
<p>&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m trying to hire just to be socially responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mean we all want to go for talent</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re looking for the best and brightest,</p>
<p>the only request I have is think like an economist</p>
<p>and cast your net wide</p>
<p>to draw from the entire talent pool and don&rsquo;t start off</p>
<p>by saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want people of color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to recruit from this group of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>Say I&rsquo;m gonna draw from the entire pool</p>
<p>and I honestly believe that if you approach hiring</p>
<p>on a blind basis in terms of blindness to backgrounds.</p>
<p>Or ethnicities or looks or whatever,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll end up with a very different workforce</p>
<p>than if you started off saying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want group,</p>
<p>group that comes from this background or this gender</p>
<p>or this orientation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we get there though, that&rsquo;s my challenge.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we get people to really sort of put</p>
<p>a blindfold and interview people</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the way we have to approach talent.</p>
<p>Especially at a point when we are so short of great talent</p>
<p>and women in particular are just killing it in schools</p>
<p>and colleges and universities and professional schools.</p>
<p>Getting all the top grades.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hungry, they want economic freedom,</p>
<p>they want the power of the purse.</p>
<p>Why not let them soar</p>
<p>and why not draw from the whole population?</p>
<p>I just think the whole mindset has to change.</p>
<p>And I think we all have to accept</p>
<p>that having people who look like you and think like you</p>
<p>and talk like you around the table</p>
<p>may lead to easier decision making</p>
<p>but not necessarily rich decision making</p>
<p>and I think we have to focus on</p>
<p>what kind of voice around the table leads</p>
<p>to a rich decision outcome?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s diverse voices.</p>
<p>Research has showed that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great, thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now jumping ahead a little bit further</p>
<p>to the time when you were CEO at PepsiCo.</p>
<p>Among the most consequential sets of decisions you made</p>
<p>had to do with mergers and acquisitions</p>
<p>and the integration of acquired companies.</p>
<p>So Tropicana for example, Quaker Oats.</p>
<p>And as you thought about those processes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious if you could say a little bit more</p>
<p>about what role culture played in your assessment</p>
<p>of a target organization</p>
<p>and then how you thought about</p>
<p>and what lessons you learned about cultural integration</p>
<p>post-merger?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me start with Tropicana</p>
<p>which we bought way back in 1997 or 1998.</p>
<p>PepsiCo was what they call a fun for you company</p>
<p>and as we launched diet products,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re a little bit of a better for you company</p>
<p>but at that point we had nothing</p>
<p>that fell into the area of good for you.</p>
<p>Anything with positive nutrition.</p>
<p>So Tropicana was our first foray into good for you.</p>
<p>And the biggest fear we had was</p>
<p>we would make the good for you a fun for you product</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna talk about the mistakes we made.</p>
<p>So when we bought Tropicana</p>
<p>which was based in Bradenton, Florida.</p>
<p>The first thing that Roger Enrico said is,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody from Frito-Lay or Pepsi should go visit Tropicana</p>
<p>&ldquo;because you will destroy their culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he was very judicious</p>
<p>as who was allowed to go to Bradenton and visit them</p>
<p>and talk to them and give them ideas</p>
<p>because if you start to deploy the fun for you culture,</p>
<p>pretty soon it&rsquo;s buy one get one free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing the packaging</p>
<p>to be more fun for you kind of packaging.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you the bad part of the story</p>
<p>and then what we had to do to reverse it.</p>
<p>For the first two or three years,</p>
<p>we managed to keep it inside</p>
<p>and not allow people to tinker with it.</p>
<p>A couple of years after the acquisition,</p>
<p>in the context of people movement,</p>
<p>we moved some people from Frito-Lay to Tropicana.</p>
<p>Overnight we went to dropping prices,</p>
<p>buy one get one free.</p>
<p>A lot of trade spending.</p>
<p>I mean literally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s remarkable how a strong culture can go in and destroy.</p>
<p>Well I shouldn&rsquo;t say destroy.</p>
<p>Radically change another culture of a smaller company</p>
<p>which had years of a good for you culture.</p>
<p>First thing they did.</p>
<p>Second thing is when you let the Pepsi guys go in,</p>
<p>they look to that Tropicana brand and say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, if you could only launch</p>
<p>&ldquo;a Tropicana soda it would be awesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they launched a Tropicana soda and guess what?</p>
<p>That business became several hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden,</p>
<p>Tropicana was in the fun for you and good for you space.</p>
<p>And no brand can live in two diametrically opposite spaces</p>
<p>as Tropicana existed.</p>
<p>In fact it confused the consumer.</p>
<p>So one of the things I had to do when I became CEO</p>
<p>was shut down the Tropicana soda business</p>
<p>and take Tropicana back to its good for you credentials.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll say to you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just what you do to an acquired company</p>
<p>right after an acquisition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what you do to nurture it and sustain it</p>
<p>and enhance it over time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason you bought the company</p>
<p>as opposed to starting it on your own.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to be very cognizant</p>
<p>of what you paid the acquisition premium for</p>
<p>and how you amortize the premium</p>
<p>and what part culture plays in that premium amortization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks, that&rsquo;s super interesting backstory.</li>
</ul>
<p>A major theme in your book is</p>
<p>the role organizations can and should play</p>
<p>in supporting working parents.</p>
<p>Right, something that you know personally.</p>
<p>And so a question is,</p>
<p>what would you have leaders do</p>
<p>to foster this support within their organizations?</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll rewind a bit and then hit play.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just look at corporate pyramids okay?</p>
<p>And I look at how steep they are.</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>Anybody who thinks it&rsquo;s a cylinder is wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very steep pyramid.</p>
<p>If I look at PepsiCo, at the entry level,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about 15,000 managers.</p>
<p>Entry level managers.</p>
<p>And by the time you get to one level below the CEO,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s about 15 or 16 people.</p>
<p>One person becomes the CEO.</p>
<p>So think of how the pyramid narrows</p>
<p>and in every stage in the process,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to outdo people to last right?</p>
<p>The world is changing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta be a lifelong student</p>
<p>and while being a lifelong student within the job,</p>
<p>you have to outperform the other people</p>
<p>who are all trying to move up the pyramid and last</p>
<p>and get to the top.</p>
<p>Now between the second and third layer is the prime age</p>
<p>where people have to really show their mettle.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the age at which people</p>
<p>who want to have families will often have kids.</p>
<p>So I often say the biological clock</p>
<p>and the career clock is in conflict with each other.</p>
<p>Especially for women.</p>
<p>So what happens is we have the biggest attrition</p>
<p>in the second or third layers of the company.</p>
<p>Which is a tragedy because we bring in</p>
<p>such outstanding women but lose them</p>
<p>because they have to choose between career and family,</p>
<p>is a problem.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t parachute in women CEOs.</p>
<p>You have to grow them.</p>
<p>Which means you&rsquo;ve got to build that pipeline</p>
<p>and right now the pipeline is broken.</p>
<p>So the big aha for me was when people said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you replace yourself with a woman CEO?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have two problems.</p>
<p>One is I had brought up women CEO, built the pipeline.</p>
<p>They left early to take on the CEOship of smaller companies</p>
<p>which is much less of a challenge</p>
<p>than a big global company like PepsiCo.</p>
<p>The second is there weren&rsquo;t enough of them.</p>
<p>Because they too had left the company.</p>
<p>Earlier to go have you know,</p>
<p>a family which I appreciate and I support</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>We say family is female.</p>
<p>So a female always leaves to go have a family.</p>
<p>First problem.</p>
<p>Problem number two is we never have good return ramps</p>
<p>to bring women back if they took time off to have kids.</p>
<p>We have on ramps and we have off ramps,</p>
<p>the return ramp is not well-developed.</p>
<p>The third problem we have is we somehow think</p>
<p>that you have to separate family and work</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no way to integrate the two.</p>
<p>I beg to differ.</p>
<p>I actually think if you provide support strategies</p>
<p>for young family builders, so they can keep their job,</p>
<p>their paid jobs while caring for their families,</p>
<p>you can actually deploy all the extraordinary talent</p>
<p>in the growth of the GDP.</p>
<p>So what do we need to do?</p>
<p>Paid leave is something, it&rsquo;s a human issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a political issue.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s being tossed around</p>
<p>like a political issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a human issue.</p>
<p>We need children, we need families.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t have children, we won&rsquo;t have population growth,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t be able to support the aging.</p>
<p>So we ought to look at having children</p>
<p>as a national imperative.</p>
<p>Not as a discretional activity.</p>
<p>So paid leave is essential.</p>
<p>Flexible work hours.</p>
<p>The great thing about COVID</p>
<p>is it taught us what flexibility is.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not jump to say</p>
<p>you can have infinite flexibility</p>
<p>or everybody comes home.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know yet what the resting point</p>
<p>for the future of work is.</p>
<p>We have to experiment and figure out</p>
<p>what the right resting point is</p>
<p>and of course the third thing that I am just shocked</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have enough of is quality,</p>
<p>affordable, available childcare</p>
<p>and if we don&rsquo;t really think about that</p>
<p>in a more systematic way as a country,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;re going to enable young family builders</p>
<p>to have a family and engage in paid work.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.</p>
<p>Some people would say families should figure out themselves</p>
<p>what childcare they want.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the executive level or the front lines.</p>
<p>You know, even the executive levels,</p>
<p>we have a choice to be flexible.</p>
<p>You take a factory worker or a nurse or a senior caregiver,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have any flexibility.</p>
<p>They have to show up at work.</p>
<p>If they have kids,</p>
<p>how are they supposed to take care of those kids</p>
<p>on a salary that is just below living wage?</p>
<p>When the childcare costs as much as 70%</p>
<p>of your salary sometimes.</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So I think this is a moment of reckoning.</p>
<p>Everybody knows we have a problem.</p>
<p>But nobody is willing to act on it</p>
<p>because it keeps getting pushed down the priority list</p>
<p>but I think as a country, we have to think through,</p>
<p>between companies.</p>
<p>Small and medium size enterprises, between government,</p>
<p>between NGOs, every entity.</p>
<p>We have to think about how to make childcare</p>
<p>a national priority</p>
<p>if we want to fill the 11 million jobs</p>
<p>that are open right now.</p>
<p>And more importantly, as the population ages,</p>
<p>if we want a workforce to take care of the aging,</p>
<p>we better start worrying about childcare</p>
<p>for women in particular who do most of those jobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if one reads your book,</p>
<p>one will see there are several themes</p>
<p>that you are really passionate about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about working parents.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also healthier eating.</p>
<p>The climate and then the environment</p>
<p>and in each Of these cases,</p>
<p>you as a leader had some personal passions</p>
<p>but there were also external forces operating on PepsiCo</p>
<p>and I wonder if you could talk a little bit</p>
<p>about how these two forces,</p>
<p>the internal and the external came together</p>
<p>in helping you choose when and how</p>
<p>to tackle these issues in the context of Pepsi.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well you know, PepsiCo has certainly undertook</li>
</ul>
<p>a fairly significant transformation</p>
<p>in the performance of purpose.</p>
<p>But the first thing I&rsquo;d say to you is</p>
<p>transforming a company when there is a problem</p>
<p>is much easier because the burning platform</p>
<p>gives you a reason to transform,</p>
<p>than transforming a successful company.</p>
<p>And my observation is that</p>
<p>transforming a company in trouble,</p>
<p>you can articulate the case inside out.</p>
<p>Transforming a company that&rsquo;s successful,</p>
<p>you have to make the case outside in, or future back.</p>
<p>So in our case,</p>
<p>I looked at, I had teams looking at the big mega trends</p>
<p>that are going to impact</p>
<p>the consumer products industries,</p>
<p>food and beverage and PepsiCo in particular</p>
<p>and based on 10 mega trends I thought</p>
<p>were going to be significant we went about saying</p>
<p>how we were going to transform the company.</p>
<p>The were three mega trends that were significant,</p>
<p>that were gonna take time, money, capabilities</p>
<p>and risks to make happen.</p>
<p>The first was transforming the portfolio</p>
<p>to have an equal mix of fun for you</p>
<p>as is better for you and good for you.</p>
<p>So really transforming a portfolio that was iconic</p>
<p>but was perhaps a step behind the times</p>
<p>because a consumer was shifting to health and wellness.</p>
<p>That was a risky move.</p>
<p>Required new R and D because we were tinkering with formulae</p>
<p>but I must say that was perhaps the most important part</p>
<p>of the transformation we had to get done.</p>
<p>The second was the environmental issues.</p>
<p>You know, our products are sold in foil bags.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sold in one way plastic.</p>
<p>You know one way plastic was the dominant lay filter</p>
<p>for a company like PepsiCo</p>
<p>and most of the beverage companies.</p>
<p>Yet, there were real concerns about landfills,</p>
<p>about plastics washing up on shores, littering,</p>
<p>the sides of roads</p>
<p>and we had to commit to reducing plastic,</p>
<p>reducing water use in our plants.</p>
<p>We had many, many plants in water distressed areas.</p>
<p>How can we justify using two and a half of liters of water</p>
<p>per liter of Pepsi?</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So we had to reduce the water usage</p>
<p>and with as many trucks we had on the road,</p>
<p>we have to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, putting in solar fields</p>
<p>and going to renewables for our plants, piece of cake.</p>
<p>Going to hybrid trucks, easy.</p>
<p>For Pepsi it&rsquo;s harder because the package is heavier,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t go to hybrids.</p>
<p>But Frito-Lay, overnight they went to hybrid trucks.</p>
<p>Plastics, we went on a longterm plan</p>
<p>to reduce plastics consumption in our facilities,</p>
<p>in our packaging.</p>
<p>And water usage,</p>
<p>you know we put all the scientists to work</p>
<p>on waterless washing, using light and things like that.</p>
<p>All kinds of interesting technologies came about.</p>
<p>The third big plank that was a big work in process</p>
<p>was people.</p>
<p>You know, people didn&rsquo;t for consumer products.</p>
<p>They wanted to work for tech, financial services.</p>
<p>So we had to attract them into PepsiCo</p>
<p>and what we did when we talked about performance</p>
<p>and purpose and talent sustainability</p>
<p>being a part of purpose was,</p>
<p>it gave people a reason to come to Pepsi</p>
<p>because we said to them,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna create an environment</p>
<p>&ldquo;where you can bring your whole self to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cost of hiring pales in comparison</p>
<p>with the cost of losing somebody after you&rsquo;ve trained them.</p>
<p>So we wanted to retain people in our industry,</p>
<p>in our company and we wanted to get the best and brightest.</p>
<p>And we wanted to allow them to have a family,</p>
<p>still work in PepsiCo.</p>
<p>So we set up onsite and near site childcare.</p>
<p>We gave people flexible hours.</p>
<p>You know we did everything possible to make people feel like</p>
<p>they could have a family.</p>
<p>They could have a life and a livelihood,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>And that worked well.</p>
<p>You know, all the feedback one got was that</p>
<p>people loved the onsite and near site childcare.</p>
<p>They loved the flexibility we gave them.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, not infinite flexibility.</p>
<p>We still needed them in the office</p>
<p>so that we could get to know them,</p>
<p>build a culture, have innovation thrive</p>
<p>but on the margins we gave them enough flexibility</p>
<p>to make home life happen and had I stayed around longer,</p>
<p>I might have tried putting it in all our factories</p>
<p>but I was exhausted.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I wanted to stay on the performance with purpose focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>We at the Haas School</p>
<p>developed four defining leadership principles that,</p>
<p>that we really focus on and adhere to.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually etched in our building</p>
<p>if we can ever welcome you to the Haas School.</p>
<p>Confidence without attitude, students always,</p>
<p>beyond yourself and.</p>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Did they say it?</p>
<p>What did I leave out?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question the status quo. - Question the status quo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question the status quo. - Okay, times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just was testing, making sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Samir] Jenny did all of them by the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of our students know about these and there&rsquo;s a,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>we took a stand and it actually differentiated us</p>
<p>among the top 10 business schools</p>
<p>and our students who are there now</p>
<p>had to write part of their admissions application</p>
<p>about the way that they connected with</p>
<p>our defining leader principles</p>
<p>and we have about 180 of our processes</p>
<p>connected to the defining leader principles and so forth.</p>
<p>So there is a you know, a brand component to it.</p>
<p>An external reputation component</p>
<p>and also an internal culture component.</p>
<p>I guess I want to understand how performance with purpose</p>
<p>played that kind of role at Pepsi.</p>
<p>Can you talk a little bit about your motivation</p>
<p>for creating this orientation,</p>
<p>how the organizational culture fit with this redirection</p>
<p>of Pepsi&rsquo;s strategy</p>
<p>and really how you led through the establishment</p>
<p>of performance with purpose</p>
<p>and kind of embedded it into the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance with purpose did not fit with PepsiCo culture</li>
</ul>
<p>because it was a radical transformation</p>
<p>in so many dimensions</p>
<p>and I was not sure if it was going to succeed</p>
<p>but I knew that it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And I think, as I looked at the mega trends</p>
<p>and looked at the whole issue.</p>
<p>Future back.</p>
<p>For the company to remain successful</p>
<p>for decades into the future I knew we had to change.</p>
<p>There was no, no doubt in my mind</p>
<p>and I made the case to the board</p>
<p>in a well thought through document</p>
<p>and they bought into it and they said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, this is the way you&rsquo;ve got to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I had to sell it inside the company.</p>
<p>Typically when you sell these big transformation programs</p>
<p>that are longterm in nature,</p>
<p>that could go through some bumps along the way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to appeal to people&rsquo;s heart</p>
<p>as much as to their heads.</p>
<p>So I framed the whole agenda,</p>
<p>not just as you know, mega trends and future back.</p>
<p>I related to every one of them.</p>
<p>I would say to them,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, look at the products you consume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you shifted your consumption to health and wellness?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of products do you feed your kids?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like a landfill today</p>
<p>&ldquo;to be the foundation of your home tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause that&rsquo;s the way you&rsquo;ve got to think about it.</p>
<p>So when you start to make it very personal to people,</p>
<p>all of a sudden they go,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I want to make the world a better place</p>
<p>&ldquo;for my children and children&rsquo;s children</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, we have to make changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the only way to go.</p>
<p>So even our skeptical divisions got on the bandwagon</p>
<p>and said absolutely, fully buy into it.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re articulating the rationale</p>
<p>for a change program,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just make a presentation</p>
<p>and just deliver it deadpan.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to make your missionary zeal</p>
<p>come out of your body and you almost have to go there</p>
<p>and make such a passionate case for it</p>
<p>and you might just have one or two chances, not too many.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t story tell,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t really get to people&rsquo;s innermost feelings,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never be able to get them to change.</p>
<p>In the first, I would say four to five years</p>
<p>of the transformation.</p>
<p>Inside the company I managed to convert most people.</p>
<p>Not just me, I had a whole bunch of opinion leaders</p>
<p>who were, my senior management.</p>
<p>Walman and Adam did it.</p>
<p>Our investors were more skeptical</p>
<p>and this is where you know,</p>
<p>it confused the hell out of me.</p>
<p>We teach corporate finance in business schools.</p>
<p>We teach discounted cash flow.</p>
<p>DCF has three parts.</p>
<p>Short term cash flow, longterm cash flow and terminal value.</p>
<p>Yet we only focus on the first three years of cash flow.</p>
<p>Investors only care about the first three quarters.</p>
<p>What has happened?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same people who come out of business schools</p>
<p>and go on to be in investing jobs.</p>
<p>Why have they forgotten the longterm cashflow</p>
<p>and the terminal value?</p>
<p>Which unfortunately has a disproportionate impact</p>
<p>on the valuation of a company</p>
<p>and if you deliver extraordinary short term value</p>
<p>without investing for the longterm,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a boom splat.</p>
<p>Investors like boom splats</p>
<p>because they sell out before a splat</p>
<p>and they buy before the boom and ride the alpha.</p>
<p>That is a wrong way to create shareholder value.</p>
<p>So we have to drill that into all new students.</p>
<p>So I come back and I say</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna manage all three pieces</p>
<p>of the discounted cashflow which we all celebrate,</p>
<p>how do you ensure that the company&rsquo;s cash flows</p>
<p>stay robust for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by judiciously balancing level and duration over times.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re reinvesting in the company</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re constantly renewing it.</p>
<p>I would love Samir for you to teach a course</p>
<p>on the failed corporations and why did they fail?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a course that&rsquo;s taught anywhere that I know.</p>
<p>One semester, take every failed corporation</p>
<p>in the last 30 years and ask the question,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they do wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Study it and it&rsquo;d give you volumes</p>
<p>about how they knew a technology was going to upend them.</p>
<p>Yet they didn&rsquo;t invest</p>
<p>because they had an old model they had to protect.</p>
<p>The toughest thing to do, old model you have to protect.</p>
<p>As they would say, if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they kept telling me.</p>
<p>So the first three or four,</p>
<p>maybe five years of my CEOship were very painful.</p>
<p>Because people didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>why I had to make the change.</p>
<p>Even though I articulated, I&rsquo;m talking about outsiders.</p>
<p>But they did not want to go through this transition.</p>
<p>Give me, give me, give me everything you can today.</p>
<p>That was the sentiment.</p>
<p>In the second five years they said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, she was so prescient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did everything right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come we didn&rsquo;t see these trends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>Except you practiced them,</p>
<p>you just didn&rsquo;t want companies to practice them.</p>
<p>And then the last two years, they handed me all the awards</p>
<p>but I wish they supported me in the first four or five years</p>
<p>because those were the toughest years.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re a new CEO</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to make change</p>
<p>and that was a time that no, I had enough criticism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>If you want to make major change happen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gotta be resilient, you&rsquo;ve gotta be courageous,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gotta be able to face the criticism.</p>
<p>And our board faced it, I faced it</p>
<p>but we stayed resilient and together.</p>
<ul>
<li>So we have a great idea for a new elective course</li>
</ul>
<p>on failed corporations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I just add,</li>
</ul>
<p>also you might want to add into that course</p>
<p>exotic financial instruments doomed to die.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Samir] I think that might merit its own elective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well that is true too, absolutely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So Indra, just sticking</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>with the performance with a purpose,</p>
<p>I think we can all back at the changes you made</p>
<p>and acknowledge that you&rsquo;ve moved Pepsi</p>
<p>in a positive direction.</p>
<p>Both in terms of society, health and so on</p>
<p>and yet you could imagine a skeptic or a critic saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did Pepsi go far enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We still have an obesity epidemic in this country.</p>
<p>We still have a climate change crisis and as you look back,</p>
<p>do you think that you pushed as far</p>
<p>and as hard as you could have or do you think that maybe</p>
<p>there were some opportunities left on the table still.</p>
<ul>
<li>PepsiCo cannot be the only company doing it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The industry has to change</p>
<p>because this is an industry that has been pushing for years</p>
<p>to process food more and more and more for several reasons.</p>
<p>One, it improves shelf life.</p>
<p>It reduces costs</p>
<p>and by adding more fat, sugar and salt</p>
<p>you can add more flavor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been the formuLa forever for industry.</p>
<p>So you know,</p>
<p>here I am coming to this industry</p>
<p>and people are already calling me Mother Theresa</p>
<p>and I go in front of the manufacturers</p>
<p>and retailer organization</p>
<p>and I make this impassioned plea to them saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to change as an industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if we committed to reducing the calories</p>
<p>&ldquo;that we put out to the consumer without sacrificing taste?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So after a lot of tugging and pulling,</p>
<p>the industry comes together.</p>
<p>Manufacturers and retailers.</p>
<p>We agree to take out one and a half trillion calories</p>
<p>from the U.S. diet in five years.</p>
<p>And in three years we take out</p>
<p>four and a half trillion calories.</p>
<p>In five years we take out six trillion calories.</p>
<p>Measured by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</p>
<p>which was our biggest critic.</p>
<p>So as an industry we did the right thing right?</p>
<p>But as PepsiCo,</p>
<p>I would have loved to reduce the sugar even more</p>
<p>but at the end of the day I can&rsquo;t tell consumers</p>
<p>how to eat and drink.</p>
<p>What you can do is nudge them to the right behaviors</p>
<p>and you know we had Cass Sunstein come in</p>
<p>who wrote the book Nudge</p>
<p>which I will honestly urge you all to read.</p>
<p>We had Cass Sunstein come and tell us</p>
<p>how to nudge consumers to better choices.</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;ll give you one experiment we did.</p>
<p>In a city with a bunch of stores</p>
<p>where there was a very high obesity level,</p>
<p>this is PepsiCo doing it on its own</p>
<p>even though we were a fraction of what people are consuming.</p>
<p>We decided to price up the regular Pepsi by 20%.</p>
<p>So the Diet Pepsi had a much lower value and we thought,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, pricing is a nudge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So people look at this and go,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll buy the cheaper product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People would go searching in the store</p>
<p>for the regular Pepsi at the higher price</p>
<p>and before they used to be line priced.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s nothing to do with price.</p>
<p>We almost have to educate people</p>
<p>how to eat and drink healthy</p>
<p>and when they&rsquo;ve been in food deserts</p>
<p>for as long as they have,</p>
<p>all of a sudden overnight</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just turn on this lever called pricing and say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a new choice for you, low price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a comprehensive change that has to be done.</p>
<p>Fix the food deserts.</p>
<p>Teach people how to cook and eat.</p>
<p>Improve the quality of school lunches.</p>
<p>So I would say PepsiCo could&rsquo;ve gone further and we did.</p>
<p>The amount of salt we reduced in our salty snacks</p>
<p>was astounding but if I told you, you&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah now I see why it tastes different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We reduced sugar in all of our cold products</p>
<p>but the real thing is to make a difference in society</p>
<p>companies have to come together like we did</p>
<p>but more importantly,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s critically important that we educate consumers</p>
<p>about eating right, living right.</p>
<p>The pandemic should&rsquo;ve been a wake up call.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interesting, thank you for that.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have one final question</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re going to hand it over to two students</p>
<p>who are going to ask questions.</p>
<p>So our final question is kind of a catchall.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already talked about some of these</p>
<p>but given your success in so many different industries,</p>
<p>in so many different roles.</p>
<p>Is there anything else you want to say</p>
<p>about your biggest lesson in building</p>
<p>and sustaining a strong, effective culture.</p>
<p>This is our focus in the Berkeley Culture Initiative.</p>
<p>And any additional thoughts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like to leave our students with.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the single biggest challenge for any leader</li>
</ul>
<p>is developing pipeline of leaders.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one thing people don&rsquo;t do very well.</p>
<p>I think you know, we don&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>the performance appraisal process seriously enough</p>
<p>and we do a perfunctory job giving feedback</p>
<p>as opposed to a sincere, deep feedback process</p>
<p>where we write down what they do well,</p>
<p>what could they do better?</p>
<p>What do they have to demonstrate next year?</p>
<p>How are you going to help them get to this next stage?</p>
<p>Because a leader&rsquo;s legacy might be the business</p>
<p>or the financial performance they leave behind</p>
<p>but a much more lasting legacy</p>
<p>is the pipeline of leaders you&rsquo;ve left behind</p>
<p>and I think that that&rsquo;s not getting the attention</p>
<p>it deserves unless you have a failed CEO succession.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it gets the time and attention.</p>
<p>So one of the things I would plead with boards of directors,</p>
<p>I plead with senior executives is</p>
<p>really focus on pipeline building</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>the last two or three years at succession,</p>
<p>when succession starts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta build a pipeline for 25 years and say</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a group of people who could be CEO in 25 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watch them, nurture them, develop them,</p>
<p>put them through assignments and then take them out</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll make it</p>
<p>and put others in into the pipeline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funnel that has to be managed for multiple years</p>
<p>and handed off from leader to leader</p>
<p>and if that is not embedded in the DNA of a company,</p>
<p>I think CEOs are being let off the hook.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great, so let me go ahead and invite Conso and Drew,</li>
</ul>
<p>our two student speakers to come up with their questions</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll have some time after their questions</p>
<p>for audience Q and A.</p>
<p>So if you have a question for Indra you&rsquo;d like to ask,</p>
<p>please queue up behind the microphone at the back</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll turn to you next.</p>
<p>Conso.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I look here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Or should I look up there?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Samir] You can look out to the audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah. - Okay, cool.</p>
<p>Awesome, so first I just wanna say</p>
<p>thank you so much for coming to speak with us.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>My mother went to medical school in Uganda in the 70s</p>
<p>and one thing she reflects on is how women</p>
<p>in her class on average outperformed the men</p>
<p>and therefore a steerer too</p>
<p>but then as both began to get married, that flipped</p>
<p>and something you talk about is the importance of you know,</p>
<p>helping women in lower levels of management</p>
<p>move up the pyramid to senior management</p>
<p>rather than falling off.</p>
<p>So what is one thing or two,</p>
<p>that you would like to tell the women in this room</p>
<p>and listening in</p>
<p>as we embark on our own managerial pursuits,</p>
<p>especially in the context of balancing family and career?</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing I&rsquo;ll say to all the women in the room</li>
</ul>
<p>and all the young family builders, not just women</p>
<p>is that family, having a family is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Teaches you about love in a profound way but it is a tether.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tether for life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lovely tether but it&rsquo;s a tether.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to go into it</p>
<p>knowing that that&rsquo;s what families are for.</p>
<p>Great support mechanism but it&rsquo;s a tether.</p>
<p>Do not say that,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could&rsquo;ve had a family</p>
<p>&ldquo;but I really wanted my career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think companies you know,</p>
<p>government organizations, NGOs,</p>
<p>everybody has a responsibility</p>
<p>to provide a support system for you.</p>
<p>You do not have to make that choice</p>
<p>because we need you in the workforce.</p>
<p>We have a huge gap in available people and talent</p>
<p>to you know, power the economy.</p>
<p>So we need all of you in the workforce.</p>
<p>So no longer think of yourselves</p>
<p>as a discretionary pair of hands,</p>
<p>you are a necessary pair of hands.</p>
<p>And therefore you know, demand, dialogue</p>
<p>with all the people that need to be talked to</p>
<p>about providing the support structure.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s childcare,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s flexible work hours, whether it&rsquo;s paid leave.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incumbent on leadership</p>
<p>to put these mechanisms in place</p>
<p>because we need all of you in the workforce.</p>
<p>I sincerely believe it.</p>
<p>Now if you don&rsquo;t want to be in the paid workforce</p>
<p>and you choose to be a stay at home mother,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also okay, that&rsquo;s your choice.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t do it because you don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Samir] Thank you, Drew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi Indra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello. - One thing that I find</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>extremely problematic is that most of the burden</p>
<p>to create change and dismantle the unfair systems</p>
<p>that we have in place in our society</p>
<p>fall largely on women and people of color.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interested in your perspective</p>
<p>on how we can get buy-in from those in power</p>
<p>to uplift and sometimes even relinquish their own power</p>
<p>to make way for those who have historically been excluded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tough one.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know, you have to be very secure in senior levels</p>
<p>to allow people to push you off your perch.</p>
<p>And you say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push me off my perch because it&rsquo;s the right thing</p>
<p>&ldquo;for the company or it&rsquo;s gonna make the company</p>
<p>&ldquo;a better place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will tell you one thing, how can we make change?</p>
<p>I think women can be more united in working together</p>
<p>to make change happen.</p>
<p>I think in many ways,</p>
<p>women tend to be competitive rather than united</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d say that for different ethnic groups too.</p>
<p>If everybody spoke with a voice,</p>
<p>at least the majority spoke with a voice</p>
<p>and advocated for change,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;d see change faster</p>
<p>than having splintered points of view.</p>
<p>Then people exploit those differences.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t disagree with you that</p>
<p>there are enough barriers rather than tailwinds</p>
<p>for people to move ahead.</p>
<p>But the only way to address them is the power of unity</p>
<p>rather than divisiveness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you. - Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go ahead and take some questions from the audience.</p>
<p>If you could just tell your name</p>
<p>and then go ahead and ask your question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi my name is Rajiv Mashar and I&rsquo;m currently a senior</li>
</ul>
<p>studying computer science and business here at Cal</p>
<p>and my question for you is you know,</p>
<p>consumers often don&rsquo;t really know what they&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>or they may have unconscious realization of needs</p>
<p>and may not actually be able to you know,</p>
<p>correctly express them.</p>
<p>So how do you listen to consumers</p>
<p>and to what extent do you even listen to their needs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh that&rsquo;s a fascinating question.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know, I spent years at Motorola</p>
<p>and when I was at Motorola in 1986 to 90,</p>
<p>the cellphone had just been launched right?</p>
<p>And the cellphone that we had,</p>
<p>the DynaTAC was this massive device</p>
<p>that weighed about a ton</p>
<p>and it was just like a spacecraft telephone.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden one day, one of the marketing guys,</p>
<p>brilliant marketing person in Motorola</p>
<p>comes to see us with a flip phone.</p>
<p>This tiny little Razr, you know the flip phone?</p>
<p>Compact and all of us looked at it and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh come on, the consumer will reject it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re used to carrying out this DynaTAC.</p>
<p>They like the weight of the phone.</p>
<p>They like the untethered device.</p>
<p>This guy kept saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, as long as you can get the semiconductor technology</p>
<p>&ldquo;and battery technology to progress,</p>
<p>&ldquo;this is the phone of the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this gets to your point.</p>
<p>How do you know what the consumer needs are</p>
<p>and how do you develop a product?</p>
<p>My general observation is the following.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s technology-driven.</p>
<p>As long as you know there is a way</p>
<p>to make consumers&rsquo; life easier, you lead the consumer.</p>
<p>If it is not technology-driven, but more style-driven,</p>
<p>then the consumer leads you.</p>
<p>So you almost have to think about what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;re not gonna offer a product that&rsquo;s flaky</p>
<p>but as long as you think</p>
<p>it can make a consumer&rsquo;s life better,</p>
<p>go off and take a chance with the product.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Rajiv] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, this is Ushing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently a full-time MBA student</p>
<p>for a Haas Class of 2022.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very humbling experience today.</p>
<p>I actually wrote about your achievement</p>
<p>in my application essays to Haas.</p>
<p>So. - Okay, thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So my question is, in your.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Indra] And you still got in, okay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughs)</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<ul>
<li>So in your sharing you mentioned a lot</li>
</ul>
<p>about the power of storytelling and I could still remember,</p>
<p>in one of your interview was about the CSR responsibility</p>
<p>and water usage of PepsiCo.</p>
<p>You weave in the story when you grew up in India.</p>
<p>There was extreme water supplies</p>
<p>and that story continued to stalk in my head right now.</p>
<p>So my question is how do you actually cultivate</p>
<p>the capability for storytelling</p>
<p>and then make it impactful enough</p>
<p>to nudge people to transform their actions?</p>
<ul>
<li>All right, that&rsquo;s a great question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stories that come from the heart,</p>
<p>that come from lived experiences, that are authentic</p>
<p>are real stories.</p>
<p>If you pluck your story from a book</p>
<p>or take somebody else&rsquo;s story and just say it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s contrived.</p>
<p>So you have to be very careful how you choose a story.</p>
<p>You have to be very careful how you choose humor</p>
<p>because sometimes a joke falls flat</p>
<p>because you haven&rsquo;t internalized it and contextualized it.</p>
<p>So what you need to do is journalize your stories.</p>
<p>You know, make a journal of interesting stories</p>
<p>that you know, you have from your life</p>
<p>from which you can derive a lesson just keep it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll never know when you can use it okay?</p>
<p>And just collect a history of stories</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t borrow stories from others</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re using a story somebody told you</p>
<p>to illustrate a point.</p>
<p>Always talk from your own experience and you know,</p>
<p>I remember when we had our shareholders meeting.</p>
<p>These water activists would show up.</p>
<p>From Boston or outside of Boston.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d come with hundreds of letters</p>
<p>to say PepsiCo is using too much water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to change.</p>
<p>And they would demand time in the shareholders&rsquo; meeting</p>
<p>to make a point.</p>
<p>And I would look at all of them and say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have any of you lived in a water distressed area?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Let me give you my experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I lived through my entire childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think cares more about water, you or me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live it, I feel it every day</p>
<p>&ldquo;when we use too much water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So trust me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna reduce this water footprint enormously.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got to have that level of conviction</p>
<p>coming out of your story.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ushing] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, thank you so much for speaking with us today.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Suyesh, I&rsquo;m a fourth-year undergrad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m studying industrial engineering and business</p>
<p>at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>So I know you&rsquo;ve had a career that&rsquo;s spanned</p>
<p>more than 40 years</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve worked across companies like Motorola,</p>
<p>BCG, Johnson &amp; Johnson and obviously PepsiCo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious to know a little bit more</p>
<p>about one piece of feedback</p>
<p>that you probably got in your early career</p>
<p>that has maybe shaped or even defined</p>
<p>the rest of your professional journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>You know one of the things I had to learn very quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>is how to give feedback and for anything.</p>
<p>I remember when I was at Motorola,</p>
<p>we were in a meeting and a presentation was done</p>
<p>and everybody gave their feedback.</p>
<p>When it came to me I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that was a terrible strategy presentation</p>
<p>&ldquo;because the strategy and the financials don&rsquo;t link.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So obviously this is a failed presentation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
<p>And I was so proud of myself</p>
<p>because I made the point in an impactful way.</p>
<p>I got on the plane to go back home, the CEO said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, come back to the back of the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we went there and he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what you did in the meeting?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took the student meeting</p>
<p>&ldquo;and you destroyed it in the last five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way you gave the feedback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You threw a hand grenade in that whole meeting</p>
<p>&ldquo;and those people are going to hate you for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the fact right, what I said?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strategy and the financials didn&rsquo;t relate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the content</p>
<p>&ldquo;of what you said, it&rsquo;s how you said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because I came from a cultural upbringing</p>
<p>where everybody said it like it was.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Now even right about the fact when we were kids,</p>
<p>we would put on plays for the parents,</p>
<p>halfway through the play they would walk out saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do better the next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>We were never told we did a good job.</p>
<p>So you sit there and now the CEO is telling me,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I would have said is the following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve said, you know so and so,</p>
<p>&ldquo;your strategy was very well thought through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And really it&rsquo;s disruptive</p>
<p>&ldquo;and this is the right way to think about the industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have we from corporate</p>
<p>&ldquo;put too many constraints on you through the financials</p>
<p>&ldquo;that makes you struggle to balance the strategy</p>
<p>&ldquo;and the financials?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or you could&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look as a company you have to deliver these financials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What aspects of the strategy can we back off from</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;and can we still accomplish the goal of gaining share?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he said you&rsquo;ve got to frame this in a more palatable way</p>
<p>as opposed to a dead cat between the eyes way.</p>
<p>Took me a long time to learn that skill,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.</p>
<p>Culturally, I was not used to it but you know,</p>
<p>little nuggets like this here and there shaped me</p>
<p>to be a much better person.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome. - Great.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So we&rsquo;re almost out of time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go ahead and hear the last two questions</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll give Indra a chance to respond</p>
<p>to one or both of them.</p>
<p>Just tell us your names and your last two,</p>
<p>and your question please.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi my name is Joseph</li>
</ul>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a cofounder of a company called Tame</p>
<p>which is a B2B marketplace for convenience store owners</p>
<p>to buy inventory and I actually have two questions.</p>
<p>One is how. - Can you ask one of them?</p>
<p>Right now, thanks. - Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>How do we get large brands and companies to partner with us</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not that big</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have as much leverage on the customer side</p>
<p>which is the convenience store aspect of it?</p>
<p>And how do we get these companies</p>
<p>to kind of change their old ways</p>
<p>and work with a newer company essentially?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Samir] Great thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>And let&rsquo;s hear the final, final question.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, so my name is Rajir Sharma.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually in</p>
<p>the Berkeley Masters of Financial Engineering Program.</p>
<p>The question that I. - Wow.</p>
<ul>
<li>That I wanted to ask was</li>
</ul>
<p>that with a lot of young professionals</p>
<p>going into the industry,</p>
<p>a common trend that we&rsquo;ve seen is that after pandemic,</p>
<p>a lot of people were actually like,</p>
<p>even after being offered a one-time bonus,</p>
<p>surplus salaries, they were not able to take it</p>
<p>just because there was no work life balance,</p>
<p>there was a lot of mental stress.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to ask you,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your code for a near perfect work life balance</p>
<p>or is it a myth?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh so let me take the first question and then come to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know, big brands,</p>
<p>by virtue of the fact that they&rsquo;re big brands</p>
<p>believe they can do it all themselves</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t really need to partner with anybody else</p>
<p>because partnering with other people is time consuming</p>
<p>and it takes away from our core job</p>
<p>of growing the big brand</p>
<p>and unless there is a clearly articulated need</p>
<p>to partner with somebody,</p>
<p>big brands don&rsquo;t like to partner with anyone.</p>
<p>And big brands have extraordinary talent</p>
<p>behind the big brand</p>
<p>so that they can grow the business themselves.</p>
<p>So the small company has to articulate a reason</p>
<p>why the big brand has to partner with them</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gotta be a compelling reason</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a hard one to do.</p>
<p>So I hate to throw some cold water on you</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>Now let me come to your second question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that when I was you know,</p>
<p>coming up the corporate ladder, there was no technology.</p>
<p>The smartphone had not even been invented.</p>
<p>Internet was in its early stages.</p>
<p>There was no Zoom or Teams or any of these technologies.</p>
<p>So everything had to be done in person.</p>
<p>I had to travel around the world.</p>
<p>If my kids&rsquo; school called, I had to rush over.</p>
<p>So there was no work life balance.</p>
<p>It was always work life juggling.</p>
<p>You started the day with one set of priorities,</p>
<p>by midday it was a different set of priorities,</p>
<p>by the end of the day it was a completely different</p>
<p>set of priorities.</p>
<p>We were always hoping that the balls</p>
<p>that you were tossing in the air, they didn&rsquo;t fall.</p>
<p>So it was a juggling act all the time</p>
<p>and you built a support structure around you</p>
<p>to pick up whatever you dropped.</p>
<p>Today with all these technologies,</p>
<p>there is hope that you can have work life balance.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to travel as much.</p>
<p>You can come into the office</p>
<p>three or four times of the week,</p>
<p>three or four days of the week</p>
<p>and perhaps spend a day at home working from home</p>
<p>and still somehow manage to have a life.</p>
<p>So I actually believe because of technology,</p>
<p>we can go from work life juggling</p>
<p>to kind of sort of work life balancing.</p>
<p>And everybody&rsquo;s getting more sensitized to this right now.</p>
<p>My only plea is,</p>
<p>as we have discussions about the future of work,</p>
<p>rather than just focusing on robotics and automation</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence, let&rsquo;s put family</p>
<p>in the center of future of work discussions.</p>
<p>Why does the school start at eight and end at three</p>
<p>while offices start at nine and go to five?</p>
<p>Makes no sense.</p>
<p>You know let&rsquo;s start to rethink every aspect</p>
<p>of life as we know it and think about</p>
<p>how to make family center to the future of work</p>
<p>as opposed to leaving it on the fringe</p>
<p>and I think if we did that sort of thinking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll make everybody&rsquo;s life easier</p>
<p>and this discussion of overwhelming stress and you know,</p>
<p>all kinds of mental illnesses can actually be addressed</p>
<p>because we are creating a more holistic society</p>
<p>and in many ways,</p>
<p>putting the human back in humanity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jenny, are you there?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am. - Did you want to conclude</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the session?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh okay, great, yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>That was brilliant and full of insights.</p>
<p>Indra you&rsquo;re just a treasure</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re so incredibly grateful</p>
<p>that you took the time to talk with us</p>
<p>and with our wonderful, amazing students.</p>
<p>So thank you on behalf of the School</p>
<p>and our student body for joining us today.</p>
<p>Can we have a round of applause?</p>
<p>(audience applauds)</p>
<p>Okay. - Thank you.</p>
<p>And to you, to Samir, to the Dean.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for having me</p>
<p>and keep the Haas flag flying high.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will. - it&rsquo;s a good school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much Indra. - And just a final note,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>we have a number of partners</p>
<p>from our Berkeley Culture Initiative</p>
<p>joining us today virtually and I wanted to say to them</p>
<p>and to our students, the Berkeley Culture Initiative</p>
<p>will have its annual conference in January this year.</p>
<p>Hopefully live.</p>
<p>We hope some of you will be able to attend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful two-day event</p>
<p>with incredible companies in the mix</p>
<p>and sort of the cutting edge academic research</p>
<p>all blended together.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also undertaking our first,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re calling mega study</p>
<p>which is a study of organizational culture</p>
<p>and looking at the impact of culture</p>
<p>on bottom line financial performance.</p>
<p>We hope to be the foundational study in this domain.</p>
<p>So stay tuned for more on that.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone, thank you Indra.</p>
<p>Have a great day. - Thanks everyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>And we&rsquo;ll see you soon. - Thanks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you very much. (audience applauds)</p>
