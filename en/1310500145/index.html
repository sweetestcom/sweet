    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis,</p>
<p>his fourth time on the podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor at MIT</p>
<p>and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group.</p>
<p>Since this is episode number 142,</p>
<p>and 42, as we all know,</p>
<p>is the answer to the ultimate question of life,</p>
<p>the universe, and everything,</p>
<p>according to the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy,</p>
<p>we decided to talk about this unanswerable question</p>
<p>of the meaning of life</p>
<p>in whatever way we two descendants of apes could muster,</p>
<p>from biology, psychology, to metaphysics, and to music.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor,</p>
<p>followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>
<p>Thanks to Grammarly,</p>
<p>which is a service for checking spelling, grammar,</p>

<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note,</p>
<p>let me say that the opening 40 minutes of the conversation</p>
<p>are all about the many songs</p>
<p>that formed the soundtrack to the journey</p>
<p>of Manolis&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>It was a happy accident for me to discover</p>
<p>yet another dimension of depth</p>
<p>to the fascinating mind of Manolis.</p>
<p>I include links to YouTube versions</p>
<p>of many of the songs we mentioned in the description,</p>
<p>and overlay lyrics on occasion.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re just listening to this</p>
<p>without listening to the songs or watching the video,</p>
<p>I hope you still might enjoy, as I did,</p>
<p>the passion that Manolis has for music,</p>
<p>his singing of the little excerpts from the songs,</p>
<p>and in general, the meaning we discuss</p>
<p>that we pull from the different songs.</p>
<p>If music is not your thing,</p>
<p>I do give timestamps to the less musical</p>
<p>and more philosophical parts of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this little experiment</p>
<p>and conversation about music and life.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Manolis Callas.</p>
<p>You mentioned Leonard Cohen and the song Hallelujah</p>
<p>as a beautiful song.</p>
<p>So what are the three songs</p>
<p>you draw the most meaning from about life?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me started.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s really countless songs that have marked me,</p>
<p>that have sort of shaped me in periods of joy</p>
<p>and in periods of sadness.</p>
<p>My son likes to joke that I have a song</p>
<p>for every sentence he will say,</p>
<p>because very often I will break into a song</p>
<p>with a sentence he&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>My wife calls me the radio</p>
<p>because I can sort of recite hundreds of songs</p>
<p>that have really shaped me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be very hard to just pick a few.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna tell you a little bit</p>
<p>about my song transition as I&rsquo;ve grown up.</p>
<p>In Greece, it was very much about,</p>
<p>as I told you before, the misery, the poverty,</p>
<p>but also overcoming adversity.</p>
<p>So some of the songs that have really shaped me</p>
<p>are Charis Alexiou, for example,</p>
<p>is one of my favorite singers in Greece.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also really just old traditional songs</p>
<p>that my parents used to listen to.</p>
<p>Like one of them is Ani Moun Plousios,</p>
<p>which is basically, oh, if I was rich.</p>
<p>And the song is painting this beautiful picture</p>
<p>about all the noises that you hear in the neighborhood,</p>
<p>his poor neighborhood, the train going by,</p>
<p>the priest walking to the church</p>
<p>and the kids crying next door and all of that.</p>
<p>And he says, with all of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having trouble falling asleep and dreaming.</p>
<p>If I was rich, and then he was breaking to that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this juxtaposition between the spirit</p>
<p>and the sublime and then the physical and the harsh reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not having troubles, not being miserable.</p>
<p>So basically rich to him just means</p>
<p>out of my misery, basically.</p>
<p>And then also being able to travel,</p>
<p>being able to sort of be the captain of a ship</p>
<p>and see the world and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just such beautiful imagery.</p>
<p>So many of the Greek songs, just like the poetry</p>
<p>we talked about, they acknowledge the cruelty,</p>
<p>the difficulty of life, but are longing for a better life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>And another one is Ftokhologia.</p>
<p>And this is one of those songs that has like a fast</p>
<p>and joyful half and a slow and sad half.</p>
<p>And it goes back and forth between them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Ftokhologia, jefse na kathemou dragoouzi.</p>
<p>So poor, you know, basically it&rsquo;s the state of being poor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if there&rsquo;s a word for that in English.</p>
<p>And then fast part is ta kerya sou megalosan</p>
<p>ke ponesan ke matosan.</p>
<p>So, and then it&rsquo;s like, oh, you know,</p>
<p>basically like the state of being poor and misery,</p>
<p>you know, for you, I write all my songs, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then the fast part is in your arms,</p>
<p>grew up and suffered and, you know, stood up and,</p>
<p>you know, rose, men with clear vision.</p>
<p>This whole concept of taking on the world</p>
<p>with nothing to lose because you&rsquo;ve seen the worst of it.</p>
<p>This imagery of psilaki parizopoula harastakorizopoula.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s describing the young men as cypress trees.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably one of my earliest exposure</p>
<p>to a metaphor, to sort of, you know,</p>
<p>this very rich imagery.</p>
<p>And I love about the fact that I was reading a story</p>
<p>to my kids the other day and it was dark.</p>
<p>And my daughter who&rsquo;s six is like,</p>
<p>oh, can I please see the pictures?</p>
<p>And Jonathan, who&rsquo;s eight, so my daughter Cleo is like,</p>
<p>oh, let&rsquo;s look at the pictures.</p>
<p>And my son Jonathan, he&rsquo;s like, but Cleo,</p>
<p>if you look at the pictures, it&rsquo;s just an image.</p>
<p>If you just close your eyes and listen, it&rsquo;s a video.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s basically showing just how much more</p>
<p>the human imagination has besides just a few images</p>
<p>that, you know, the book will give you.</p>
<p>And then another one, oh gosh,</p>
<p>this one is really like miserable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Sto Perigiali, To Krifo.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically describing how vigorously</p>
<p>we took on our life and we pushed hard</p>
<p>towards a direction that we then realized</p>
<p>was the wrong one.</p>
<p>And again, these songs give you so much perspective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no songs like that in English</p>
<p>that will basically sort of just smack you in the face</p>
<p>about sort of the passion and the force and the drive.</p>
<p>And then it turns out, we just followed the wrong life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, wow.</p>
<p>Okay, so that was you.</p>
<p>All right, so that&rsquo;s like before 12.</p>
<p>So growing up in sort of this horrendously miserable</p>
<p>sort of view of romanticism, of suffering.</p>
<p>So then my preteen years is like, you know,</p>
<p>learning English through songs.</p>
<p>So basically, you know,</p>
<p>listening to all the American pop songs</p>
<p>and then memorizing them vocally</p>
<p>before I even knew what they meant.</p>
<p>So, you know, Madonna and Michael Jackson</p>
<p>and all of these sort of really popular songs</p>
<p>and, you know, George Michael and just songs</p>
<p>that I would just listen to the radio and repeat vocally.</p>
<p>And eventually as I started learning English,</p>
<p>I was like, oh wow, this thing I&rsquo;ve been repeating,</p>
<p>I now understand what it means.</p>
<p>Without relistening it to it,</p>
<p>but just with re repeating it, it was like, oh.</p>
<p>Again, Michael Jackson&rsquo;s Man in the Mirror</p>
<p>is teaching you that it&rsquo;s your responsibility</p>
<p>to just improve yourself.</p>
<p>You know, if you wanna make the world a better place,</p>
<p>take a look at yourself and make the change.</p>
<p>This whole concept of, again, I mean,</p>
<p>all of these songs, you can listen to them shallowly</p>
<p>or you can just listen to them and say,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s deeper meaning here.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a certain philosophy of song</p>
<p>as a way of touching the psyche.</p>
<p>So if you look at regions of the brain,</p>
<p>people have lost their language ability</p>
<p>because they have an accident in that region of the brain</p>
<p>can actually sing because it&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>the symmetric region of the brain.</p>
<p>And that again, teaches you so much</p>
<p>about language evolution and sort of the duality</p>
<p>of musicality and, you know, rhythmic patterns</p>
<p>and eventually language.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of why songs developed?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of suggesting that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that there is something important</p>
<p>about our connection with song and with music</p>
<p>on the level of the importance of language.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just possible.</p>
<p>In my view, language comes after music.</p>
<p>Language comes after song.</p>
<p>No, seriously.</p>
<p>Like basically, my view of human cognitive evolution</p>
<p>is rituals.</p>
<p>If you look at many early cultures,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s rituals around every stage of life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s organized dance performances around mating.</p>
<p>And if you look at mate selection,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an evolutionary drive right there.</p>
<p>So basically, if you&rsquo;re not able to string together</p>
<p>a complex dance as a bird, you don&rsquo;t get a mate.</p>
<p>And that actually forms this development</p>
<p>for many song learning birds.</p>
<p>Not every bird knows how to sing.</p>
<p>And not every bird knows how to learn a complicated song.</p>
<p>So basically, there&rsquo;s birds that simply have</p>
<p>the same few tunes that they know how to play.</p>
<p>And a lot of that is inherent and genetically encoded.</p>
<p>And others are birds that learn how to sing.</p>
<p>And if you look at a lot of these exotic birds of paradise</p>
<p>and stuff like that,</p>
<p>the mating rituals that they have are enormously amazing.</p>
<p>And I think human mating rituals of ancient tribes</p>
<p>are not very far off from that.</p>
<p>And in my view, the sequential formation of these movements</p>
<p>is a prelude to the cognitive capabilities</p>
<p>that ultimately enable language.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just an accidental precursor to intelligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, sexually selected.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s sexually selected and it&rsquo;s a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s required for intelligence.</p>
<p>And even as language has now developed,</p>
<p>I think the artistic expression is needed,</p>
<p>like badly needed by our brain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that, oh, our brain can kind of,</p>
<p>you know, take a break and go do that stuff.</p>
<p>No, I mean, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember</p>
<p>that scene from, oh gosh,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s that Jack Nicholson movie in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.</p>
<p>A dull boy.</p>
<p>The Shining.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this amazing scene where he&rsquo;s constantly</p>
<p>trying to concentrate and what&rsquo;s coming out</p>
<p>of the typewriter is just gibberish.</p>
<p>And I have that image as well when I&rsquo;m working.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, basically all of these crazy,</p>
<p>you know, huge number of hobbies that I have,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not just tolerated by my work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re required by my work.</p>
<p>This ability of sort of stretching your brain</p>
<p>in all these different directions</p>
<p>is connecting your emotional self and your cognitive self.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a prerequisite to being able</p>
<p>to be cognitively capable.</p>
<p>At least in my view.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder if the world without art and music,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just making me realize that perhaps</p>
<p>that world would be not just devoid of fun things</p>
<p>to look at or listen to, but devoid of all the other stuff.</p>
<p>All the bridges and rockets and science.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Creativity is not disconnected from art.</p>
<p>And you know, my kids, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>I could be doing the full math treatment to them.</p>
<p>No, they play the piano and they play the violin</p>
<p>and they play sports.</p>
<p>I mean, this whole, you know, sort of movement</p>
<p>and going through mazes and playing tennis</p>
<p>and, you know, playing soccer and avoiding obstacles</p>
<p>and all of that,</p>
<p>that forms your three dimensional view of the world.</p>
<p>Being able to actually move and run and play</p>
<p>in three dimensions is extremely important for math,</p>
<p>for, you know, stringing together complicated concepts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same underlying cognitive machinery</p>
<p>that is used for navigating mazes and for navigating theorems</p>
<p>and sort of solving equations.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t, you know, I can&rsquo;t have a conversation</p>
<p>with my students without, you know,</p>
<p>sort of either using my hands</p>
<p>or opening the whiteboard in Zoom</p>
<p>and just constantly drawing.</p>
<p>Or, you know, back when we had in person meetings,</p>
<p>just the whiteboard on my own.</p>
<p>The whiteboard, yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Michael Jackson, man,</p>
<p>Mirror, Careless Whisper with George Michael,</p>
<p>which is a song I like.</p>
<p>You can say Careless Whisper.</p>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>I like that one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too popular for you.</p>
<p>I had recorded, no, no, no,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s an amazing song for me.</p>
<p>I had recorded a small part of it</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s played at the tail end of the radio.</p>
<p>And I had a tape where I only had part of that song</p>
<p>and I just played it over and over and over again,</p>
<p>just so beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so heartbreaking.</p>
<p>That song is almost Greek.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I know, and George Michael is Greek.</p>
<p>Is he Greek?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Greek, of course.</p>
<p>George Michaelides, I mean, he&rsquo;s Greek.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I did not know this.</p>
<p>Now you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry to offend you so deeply not knowing this.</p>
<p>So, okay, so what&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So anyway, so we&rsquo;re moving to France</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m 12 years old.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m getting into the songs of Gainsbourg.</p>
<p>So Gainsbourg is this incredible French composer.</p>
<p>He is always seen on stage,</p>
<p>like not even pretending to try to please,</p>
<p>just like with his cigarette,</p>
<p>just like rrrr mumbling his songs.</p>
<p>But the lyrics are unbelievable.</p>
<p>Like basically entire sentences will rhyme.</p>
<p>He will say the same thing twice and you&rsquo;re like, whoa.</p>
<p>And in fact, another, speaking of Greek,</p>
<p>a French Greek, George Mustaky,</p>
<p>this song is just magnificent.</p>
<p>Avec ma gueule de m√©t√®que, de juif errant, de patre grecque.</p>
<p>So with my face of m√©t√®que is actually a Greek word.</p>
<p>A Greek word, it&rsquo;s a French word for a Greek word.</p>
<p>But met comes from meta,</p>
<p>and then ec from Ikea, from ecology, which means home.</p>
<p>So m√©t√®que is someone who has changed homes for a migrant.</p>
<p>So with my face of a migrant, and you&rsquo;ll love this one.</p>
<p>De juif errant, de patre grecque,</p>
<p>of a meandering Jew, of Greek pastor.</p>
<p>So again, the Russian Greek,</p>
<p>the Jewish Orthodox connection, so.</p>
<p>Aime mes cheveux au quatre vents,</p>
<p>with my hair in the four wings.</p>
<p>Avec mes yeux tous d√©lav√©s qui me donnent l√©reux de r√™ver.</p>
<p>Avec, with my eyes that are all washed out,</p>
<p>who give me the pretense of dreaming,</p>
<p>but who don&rsquo;t dream that much anymore.</p>
<p>With my hands of thief, of musician,</p>
<p>and who have stolen so many gardens.</p>
<p>With my mouth that has drunk,</p>
<p>that has kissed, and that has bitten,</p>
<p>without ever pleasing its hunger.</p>
<p>With my skin that has been rubbed</p>
<p>in the sun of all the summers,</p>
<p>and anything that was wearing a skirt.</p>
<p>With my heart, and then you have to listen to this verse,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so beautiful.</p>
<p>Avec mon coeur qui a su faire souffrir autant qu il a souffert.</p>
<p>Qui a su faire.</p>
<p>With my heart that knew how to make suffer</p>
<p>as much as it suffered,</p>
<p>but was able to, that knew how to make,</p>
<p>in French it&rsquo;s actually su faire,</p>
<p>that knew how to make.</p>
<p>Qui a su faire souffrir autant qu il a souffert.</p>
<p>Verses that span the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just beautiful.</p>
<p>Do you know, on a small tangent,</p>
<p>do you know Jacques Brel?</p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p>And then Ne Me Kite Pas, those songs.</p>
<p>That song gets me every time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a cover of that song</p>
<p>by one of my favorite female artists.</p>
<p>Not Nina Simone.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Modern?</p>
<p>Carol Emerald.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s from Amsterdam.</p>
<p>And she has a version of Ne Me Kite Pas</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;s actually added some English lyrics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really beautiful.</p>
<p>But again, Ne Me Kite Pas is just so,</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s, you know, the promises,</p>
<p>the volcanoes that will restart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>I love, there&rsquo;s not many songs</p>
<p>that show such depth of desperation</p>
<p>for another human being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so powerful.</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>Je t offrirai des perles de pluie</p>
<p>venant de pays o√π il ne pleut pas.</p>
<p>And then high school.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m starting to learn English.</p>
<p>So I moved to New York.</p>
<p>So Sting&rsquo;s Englishman in New York.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Magnificent song.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s if manners maggoth manners someone said</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;s the hero of the day.</p>
<p>It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile.</p>
<p>Be yourself no matter what they say.</p>
<p>And then takes more than combat gear to make a man.</p>
<p>Takes more than a license for a gun.</p>
<p>Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can.</p>
<p>A gentleman will walk but never run.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s again, you&rsquo;re talking about songs</p>
<p>that teach you how to live.</p>
<p>I mean, this is one of them.</p>
<p>Basically says, it&rsquo;s not the combat gear that makes a man.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the part where he says, there you go.</p>
<p>Gentleness so brighty are rare in this society.</p>
<p>At night a candle&rsquo;s brighter than the sun.</p>
<p>So beautiful.</p>
<p>He basically says, well, you just might be the only one.</p>
<p>Modesty propriety can lead to notoriety.</p>
<p>You could end up as the only one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it basically tells you,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to be like the others.</p>
<p>Be yourself, show kindness, show generosity.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t, you know, don&rsquo;t let that anger get to you.</p>
<p>You know, the song Fragile.</p>
<p>How fragile we are, how fragile we are.</p>
<p>So again, as in Greece, I didn&rsquo;t even know what that meant.</p>
<p>How fragile we are, but the song was so beautiful.</p>
<p>And then eventually I learned English</p>
<p>and I actually understand the lyrics.</p>
<p>And the song is actually written after the Contras</p>
<p>murdered Ben Linder in 1987.</p>
<p>And the US eventually turned against supporting</p>
<p>these guerrillas.</p>
<p>And it was just a political song,</p>
<p>but so such a realization that you can&rsquo;t win</p>
<p>with violence basically.</p>
<p>And that song starts with the most beautiful poetry.</p>
<p>So if blood will flow when flesh and steel are one,</p>
<p>drying in the color of the evening sun,</p>
<p>tomorrow&rsquo;s rain will wash the stains away,</p>
<p>but something in our minds will always stain.</p>
<p>Perhaps this final act was meant</p>
<p>to clinch a lifetime&rsquo;s argument</p>
<p>that nothing comes through violence</p>
<p>and nothing ever could.</p>
<p>For all those born beneath an angry star,</p>
<p>lest we forget how fragile we are.</p>
<p>Damn, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s poetry.</p>
<p>It was beautiful.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s using the English language</p>
<p>is just such a refined way with deep meanings,</p>
<p>but also words that rhyme just so beautifully</p>
<p>and evocations of when flesh and steel are one.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just mind boggling.</p>
<p>And then of course the refrain that everybody remembers</p>
<p>is on and on the rain will fall, et cetera.</p>
<p>But like this beginning.</p>
<p>Tears from a star, wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And again, tears from a star, how fragile we are.</p>
<p>I mean, just these rhymes are just flowing so naturally.</p>
<p>Something, it seems that more meaning comes</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a rhythm that, I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>That probably connects to exactly what you were saying.</p>
<p>And if you pay close attention,</p>
<p>you will notice that the more obvious words</p>
<p>sometimes are the second verse</p>
<p>and the less obvious are often the first verse</p>
<p>because it makes the second verse flow much more naturally</p>
<p>because otherwise it feels contrived.</p>
<p>Oh, you went and found this like unusual word.</p>
<p>In Dark Moments, the whole album of Pink Floyd</p>
<p>and the movie just marked me enormously</p>
<p>as a teenager, just the wall.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one song that never actually made it</p>
<p>into the album that&rsquo;s only there in the movie</p>
<p>about when the tigers broke free</p>
<p>and the tigers are the tanks of the Germans.</p>
<p>And it just describes, again, this vivid imagery.</p>
<p>It was just before dawn, one miserable morning in Black 44</p>
<p>when the forward commander was told to sit tight</p>
<p>when he asked that his men be withdrawn.</p>
<p>And the generals gave thanks</p>
<p>as the other ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while.</p>
<p>And the Anzio bridgehead was held</p>
<p>for the price of a few hundred ordinary lives.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a theme that keeps coming back in Pink Floyd</p>
<p>with Us Versus Them.</p>
<p>Us and them, God only knows</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what we would choose to do.</p>
<p>For work he cried from the rear</p>
<p>and the front rows died from another song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this whole concept of Us Versus Them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that theme of Us Versus Them again</p>
<p>where the child is discovering how his father died</p>
<p>when he finds an old and a found it one day</p>
<p>in a drawer of old photographs hidden away.</p>
<p>And my eyes still grow damp to remember</p>
<p>his majesty&rsquo;s sign with his own rubber stamp.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so ironic because it seems the way</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s writing it that he&rsquo;s not crying</p>
<p>because his father was lost.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s crying because kind old King George</p>
<p>took the time to actually write mother a note</p>
<p>about the fact that his father died.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so ironic because it basically says</p>
<p>we are just ordinary men and of course we&rsquo;re disposable.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you know the root of the word pioneers</p>
<p>but you had a chess board here earlier, a pawn.</p>
<p>In French, it&rsquo;s a pigeon.</p>
<p>They are the ones that you send to the front</p>
<p>to get murdered, slaughtered.</p>
<p>This whole concept of pioneers</p>
<p>having taken this whole disposable ordinary men</p>
<p>to actually be the ones that we&rsquo;re now treating as heroes.</p>
<p>So anyway, there&rsquo;s this juxtaposition of that.</p>
<p>And then the part that always just strikes me</p>
<p>is the music and the tonality totally changes.</p>
<p>And now he describes the attack.</p>
<p>It was dark all around.</p>
<p>There was frost in the ground.</p>
<p>When the tigers broke free</p>
<p>and no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers company.</p>
<p>They were all left behind.</p>
<p>Most of them dead.</p>
<p>The rest of them dying.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how the high command took my daddy from me.</p>
<p>And that song, even though it&rsquo;s not in the album,</p>
<p>explains the whole movie.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s this movie of misery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this movie of someone being stuck in their head</p>
<p>and not being able to get out of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other movie that I think has captured so well</p>
<p>this prison that is someone&rsquo;s own mind.</p>
<p>And this wall that you&rsquo;re stuck inside</p>
<p>and this feeling of loneliness.</p>
<p>And sort of, is there anybody out there?</p>
<p>And you know, sort of, hello, hello.</p>
<p>Is there anybody in there?</p>
<p>Just nod if you can hear me.</p>
<p>Is there anyone home?</p>
<p>Come on, yo.</p>
<p>I hear you&rsquo;re feeling down.</p>
<p>Just one minute, I hear you nodding in again.</p>
<p>Anyway, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, the prison of your mind.</p>
<p>So those are the darker moments.</p>
<p>Exactly, these are the darker moments.</p>
<p>Yeah, in the darker moments, the mind does feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re trapped alone in a room with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s this scene in the movie</p>
<p>which like, where he just breaks out with his guitar</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this prostitute in the room.</p>
<p>She starts throwing stuff and then he like, you know</p>
<p>breaks the window, he throws the chair outside.</p>
<p>And then you see him laying in the pool</p>
<p>with his own blood, like, you know, everywhere.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s these endless hours spent</p>
<p>fixing every little thing and lining it up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this whole sort of mania versus, you know</p>
<p>you can spend hours building up something</p>
<p>and just destroy it in a few seconds.</p>
<p>One of my turns is that song.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I feel cold as a tourniquet</p>
<p>right as a manor.</p>
<p>Dry as a funeral drum.</p>
<p>And then the music also is like, run to the bedroom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a suitcase on the left.</p>
<p>There you find my favorite acts.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look so frightened.</p>
<p>This is just a passing phase.</p>
<p>One of my bad days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>I need to rewatch it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so, you&rsquo;re making me realize.</p>
<p>But imagine watching this as a teenager.</p>
<p>It like ruins your mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like so many, it&rsquo;s such harsh imagery.</p>
<p>And then, you know, anyway, so there&rsquo;s the dark moment.</p>
<p>And then again, going back to Sting</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s the political songs, Russians.</p>
<p>And I think that song should be a new national anthem</p>
<p>for the US, not for Russians, but for red versus blue.</p>
<p>Mr. Khrushchev says we will bury you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t subscribe to this point of view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be such an ignorant thing to do</p>
<p>if the Russians love their children too.</p>
<p>What is it doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically saying the Russians</p>
<p>are just as humans as we are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that they&rsquo;re gonna let their children die.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>How can I save my innocent boy</p>
<p>from Oppenheimer&rsquo;s deadly toy?</p>
<p>And now that&rsquo;s the new national anthem, are you reading?</p>
<p>There is no monopoly of common sense</p>
<p>on either side of the political fence.</p>
<p>We share the same biology</p>
<p>regardless of ideology.</p>
<p>Believe me when I say to you,</p>
<p>I hope the Russians love their children too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a winnable war.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lie we don&rsquo;t believe anymore.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s beautiful, right?</p>
<p>And for God&rsquo;s sake, America, wake up.</p>
<p>These are your fellow Americans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re your fellow biology.</p>
<p>There is no monopoly of common sense</p>
<p>on either side of the political fence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no crisper, simpler way to say</p>
<p>Russians love their children too, the common humanity.</p>
<p>And remember what I was telling you,</p>
<p>I think in one of our first podcasts</p>
<p>about the daughter who&rsquo;s crying for her brother</p>
<p>to come back for more.</p>
<p>And then the Virgin Mary appears and says,</p>
<p>who should I take instead?</p>
<p>This Turk, here&rsquo;s his family, here&rsquo;s his children.</p>
<p>This other one, he just got married, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that basically says, no.</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at the Lord of the Rings,</p>
<p>the enemies are these monsters, they&rsquo;re not human.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we always do.</p>
<p>We always say, they&rsquo;re not like us, they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not humans, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this dehumanization that has to happen</p>
<p>for people to go to war.</p>
<p>If you realize just how close we are genetically,</p>
<p>one with the other, this whole 99.9% identical,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t bear weapons against someone who&rsquo;s like that.</p>
<p>And the things that are the most meaningful to us</p>
<p>in our lives at every level is the same on all sides,</p>
<p>on both sides.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that we&rsquo;re genetically the same.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re ideologically the same.</p>
<p>We love our children, we love our country.</p>
<p>We will fight for our family.</p>
<p>So, and the last one I mentioned last time we spoke,</p>
<p>which is Joni Mitchell&rsquo;s Both Sides Now.</p>
<p>So she has three rounds, one on clouds, one on love,</p>
<p>and one on life.</p>
<p>And on clouds she says,</p>
<p>Rows and flows of angel hair</p>
<p>And ice cream castles in the air</p>
<p>And feather canyons everywhere</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at clouds that way</p>
<p>But now they only block the sun</p>
<p>They rain and snow on everyone</p>
<p>So many things I would have done</p>
<p>But clouds got in my way</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve looked at clouds from both sides now</p>
<p>From up and down</p>
<p>And still somehow it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Clouds illusions I recall</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know clouds at all</p>
<p>And then she goes on about love,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s super, super happy,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s about misery and loss and about life,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s about winning and losing and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But now old friends are acting strange</p>
<p>They shake their heads, they say I&rsquo;ve changed</p>
<p>Well, something&rsquo;s lost and something&rsquo;s gained</p>
<p>In living every day</p>
<p>So again, that&rsquo;s growing up and realizing that,</p>
<p>well, the view that you had as a kid</p>
<p>is not necessarily that you have as an adult.</p>
<p>Remember my poem from when I was 16 years old</p>
<p>of this whole, you know,</p>
<p>children dance now all in row and then in the end,</p>
<p>even though the snow seems bright,</p>
<p>without you have lost their light,</p>
<p>sun that sang and moon that smiled.</p>
<p>So this whole concept of, if you have love</p>
<p>and if you have passion,</p>
<p>you see the exact same thing from a different way.</p>
<p>You can go out running in the rain</p>
<p>or you could just stay in and say,</p>
<p>ah, sucks, I won&rsquo;t be able to go outside now.</p>
<p>Those sides.</p>
<p>Anyway, and the last one is,</p>
<p>last, last one I promise, Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p>This is amazing by the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad we stumbled on how much joy you have</p>
<p>in so many avenues of life and music is just one of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>But yes, Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p>Going back to Leonard Cohen,</p>
<p>since that&rsquo;s where you started.</p>
<p>So Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s Dance Me to the End of Love.</p>
<p>That was our opening song in our wedding with my wife.</p>
<p>Oh no, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>As we came out to greet the guests,</p>
<p>it was Dance Me to the End of Love.</p>
<p>And then another one, which is just so passionate always</p>
<p>and we always keep referring back to it is I&rsquo;m Your Man.</p>
<p>And it goes on and on about sort of,</p>
<p>I can be every type of lover for you.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really beautiful in marriage</p>
<p>is that we live that with my wife every day.</p>
<p>You can have the passion, you can have the anger,</p>
<p>you can have the love, you can have the tenderness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so many gems in that song.</p>
<p>If you want a partner, take my hand.</p>
<p>Or if you want to strike me down in anger,</p>
<p>here I stand, I&rsquo;m your man.</p>
<p>Then if you want a boxer, I will step into the ring for you.</p>
<p>If you want a driver, climb inside.</p>
<p>Or if you want to take me for a ride, you know you can.</p>
<p>So this whole concept of you want to drive, I&rsquo;ll follow.</p>
<p>You want me to drive, I&rsquo;ll drive.</p>
<p>And the difference I would say between like that</p>
<p>and Nemaki Tapa is this song, he&rsquo;s got an attitude.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, he&rsquo;s proud of his ability</p>
<p>to basically be any kind of man for as long as opposed</p>
<p>to the Jacques Brel like desperation of what do I have to be</p>
<p>for you to love me, that kind of desperation.</p>
<p>But notice there&rsquo;s a parallel here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a verse that is perhaps not paid attention</p>
<p>to as much which says, ah, but a man never got a woman back,</p>
<p>not by begging on his knees.</p>
<p>So it seems that the I&rsquo;m your man</p>
<p>is actually an apology song in the same way</p>
<p>that Nemaki Tapa is an apology song.</p>
<p>Nemaki Tapa basically says I&rsquo;ve screwed up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, baby.</p>
<p>And in the same way that the Careless Whisper</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m screwed up.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna dance again.</p>
<p>Guilty feet have got no rhythm.</p>
<p>So this is an apology song, not by begging on his knees</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;d crawl to you, baby, and I&rsquo;d fall at your feet</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d howl at your beauty like a dog in heat</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d claw at your heart and I&rsquo;d tear at your sheet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say please.</p>
<p>And then the last one is so beautiful.</p>
<p>If you want a father for your child</p>
<p>or only want to walk with me a while across the sand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m your man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the last verses which basically says</p>
<p>you want me for a day?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be there.</p>
<p>Do you want me to just walk?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be there.</p>
<p>You want me for life?</p>
<p>Do you want a father for your child?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be there too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Remember how I told you I was gonna finish</p>
<p>with a lighthearted song?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Last one.</p>
<p>You ready?</p>
<p>So Alison Krauss and Union Station,</p>
<p>country song, believe it or not, the lucky one.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never identified as much</p>
<p>with the lyrics of a song as this one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>My friend, Serafim Batoglou,</p>
<p>is the guy who got me to genomics in the first place.</p>
<p>I owe enormously to him.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s another Greek.</p>
<p>We actually met dancing, believe it or not.</p>
<p>So we used to perform Greek dances.</p>
<p>I was the president of the International Students Association.</p>
<p>So we put on these big performances</p>
<p>for 500 people at MIT.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a picture on the MIT Tech</p>
<p>where Serafim, who&rsquo;s like a bodybuilder,</p>
<p>was holding me on his shoulder.</p>
<p>And I was like doing maneuvers in the air, basically.</p>
<p>So anyway, this guy, Serafim,</p>
<p>we were driving back from a conference.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this Russian girl</p>
<p>who was describing how every member of her family</p>
<p>had been either killed by the communists</p>
<p>or killed by the Germans or killed by the,</p>
<p>like, she had just like, you know, misery,</p>
<p>like death and, you know, sickness and everything.</p>
<p>Everyone was decimated in her family.</p>
<p>She was the last standing member.</p>
<p>And we stopped at a, Serafim was driving</p>
<p>and we stopped at a rest area.</p>
<p>And he takes me aside and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Manolis, we&rsquo;re gonna crash.</p>
<p>Get her out of my car.</p>
<p>And then he basically says,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m only reassured because you&rsquo;re here with me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, what do you mean?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, you know, he&rsquo;s like, from your smile,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re the luckiest man on the planet.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this really funny thing</p>
<p>where I just feel freaking lucky all the time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a question of attitude.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not any luckier than any other person,</p>
<p>but every time something horrible happens to me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, and in fact, even in that song,</p>
<p>the song about sort of, you know,</p>
<p>walking on the beach and this, you know,</p>
<p>sort of taking our life the wrong way</p>
<p>and then, you know, having to turn around.</p>
<p>At some point he&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>in the fresh sand, we wrote her name.</p>
<p>So how nicely that the wind blew and the writing was erased.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s this whole sort of,</p>
<p>not just saying, oh, bummer, but, oh, great.</p>
<p>I just lost this.</p>
<p>This must mean something, right?</p>
<p>This horrible thing happened,</p>
<p>it must open the door to a beautiful chapter.</p>
<p>So, so Allison Krauss is talking about the lucky one.</p>
<p>So I was like, oh my God, she wrote a song for me.</p>
<p>And she goes, you&rsquo;re the lucky one, I know that now,</p>
<p>as free as the wind blowing down the road,</p>
<p>loved by many, hated by none, I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>you were lucky because you know what you&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>not the care in the world, not the worry inside.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s going to be all right</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re the lucky one.</p>
<p>And then she goes, you&rsquo;re the lucky one,</p>
<p>always having fun, a jack of all trades,</p>
<p>a master of none.</p>
<p>You look at the world with the smiling eyes</p>
<p>and laugh at the devil as his train rolls by.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a song and a one night stand.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be looking at a happy man</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re the lucky one.</p>
<p>It basically says, if you just don&rsquo;t worry too much,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t try to be a one trick pony,</p>
<p>if you just embrace the fact</p>
<p>that you might suck at a bunch of things,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re just gonna try a lot of things.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another verse that says,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re blessed I guess,</p>
<p>but never knowing which road you&rsquo;re choosing,</p>
<p>to you the next best thing</p>
<p>to playing and winning is playing and losing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful</p>
<p>because he basically says,</p>
<p>if you try your best,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still playing,</p>
<p>if you lose, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You had an awesome game.</p>
<p>And again, superficially,</p>
<p>it sounds like a super happy song.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the last verse basically says,</p>
<p>no matter where you are, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll be.</p>
<p>You can bet your luck won&rsquo;t follow me.</p>
<p>Just give you a song and then one night stand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be looking at a happy man.</p>
<p>And then in the video of the song,</p>
<p>she just walks away or he just walks away</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And it basically tells you</p>
<p>that freedom comes at a price.</p>
<p>Freedom comes at the price of non commitment.</p>
<p>This whole sort of birds who love</p>
<p>or birds who cry,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t really love unless you cry.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just be the lucky one,</p>
<p>the happy boy, la la la,</p>
<p>and yet have a long term relationship.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, on one hand,</p>
<p>I identify with the shallowness of this song,</p>
<p>of you know, you&rsquo;re the lucky one,</p>
<p>jack of all trades, a master or none.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>I identify with a lesson of,</p>
<p>well, you can&rsquo;t just be the happy,</p>
<p>merry, go lucky all the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to embrace loss</p>
<p>and sometimes you have to embrace suffering.</p>
<p>And sometimes you have to embrace that.</p>
<p>If you have a safety net,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really committing enough.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, you know,</p>
<p>basically you&rsquo;re allowing yourself to slip.</p>
<p>But if you just go all in</p>
<p>and you just, you know,</p>
<p>let go of your reservations,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you truly will get somewhere.</p>
<p>So anyway, that&rsquo;s like the,</p>
<p>I managed to narrow it down to what, 15 songs?</p>
<p>Thank you for that wonderful journey</p>
<p>that you just took us on,</p>
<p>the darkest possible places of Greek song</p>
<p>to ending on this country song.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard it before,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I feel the same way,</p>
<p>depending on the day,</p>
<p>is this the luckiest human on earth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to that,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right, it needs to be,</p>
<p>we need to now return to the muck of life</p>
<p>in order to be able to truly enjoy it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>What do you mean muck?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s muck?</p>
<p>The messiness of life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The things that were,</p>
<p>things don&rsquo;t turn out the way you expect it to.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, to feel like you&rsquo;re in the right place,</p>
<p>to feel lucky,</p>
<p>is like focusing on the beautiful consequences.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But then that feeling of things being different</p>
<p>than you expected,</p>
<p>that you stumble in all the kinds of ways,</p>
<p>that seems to be,</p>
<p>needs to be paired with the feeling of luck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s basically one way,</p>
<p>the only way not to make mistakes,</p>
<p>is to never do anything.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Basically, you have to embrace the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll be wrong so many times.</p>
<p>In so many research meetings,</p>
<p>I just go off on a tangent and say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s think about this for a second.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just crazy for me,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a computer scientist,</p>
<p>to just tell my biologist friends,</p>
<p>what if biology kind of worked this way?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they humor me.</p>
<p>They just let me talk.</p>
<p>And rarely has it not gone somewhere good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m always right,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always something worth exploring further,</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re an outsider with humility</p>
<p>and knowing that I&rsquo;ll be wrong a bunch of times,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll challenge your assumptions,</p>
<p>and often take us to a better place,</p>
<p>is part of this whole sort of messiness of life.</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t try and lose and get hurt</p>
<p>and suffer and cry and just break your heart</p>
<p>and all these feelings of guilt and,</p>
<p>wow, I did the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s part of life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just something that,</p>
<p>if you are a doer, you&rsquo;ll make mistakes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a criticizer, yeah, sure,</p>
<p>you can sit back and criticize everybody else</p>
<p>for the mistakes they make.</p>
<p>Or instead, you can just be out there making those mistakes.</p>
<p>And frankly, I&rsquo;d rather be the criticized one</p>
<p>than the criticizer.</p>
<p>Yeah, brilliantly put.</p>
<p>Every time somebody steals my bicycle,</p>
<p>I say, well, no, my son&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why do they steal our bicycle, dad?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, aren&rsquo;t you happy that you have bicycles</p>
<p>that people can steal?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you happy that you have bicycles that people can steal?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather be the person stolen from than the stealer.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not the critic that counts.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ve just talked amazingly</p>
<p>about life from the music perspective.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about life from, human life,</p>
<p>from perhaps other perspective and its meaning.</p>
<p>So this is episode 142.</p>
<p>There is perhaps an absurdly deep meaning</p>
<p>to the number 42 that our culture has elevated.</p>
<p>So this is a perfect time to talk about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about it already,</p>
<p>but do you think this question that&rsquo;s so simple</p>
<p>and so seemingly absurd has value</p>
<p>of what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Is it something that raising the question</p>
<p>and trying to answer it, is that a ridiculous pursuit</p>
<p>or is there some value?</p>
<p>Is it answerable at all?</p>
<p>So first of all, I feel that we owe it to your listeners</p>
<p>to say why 42?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So of course the Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</p>
<p>came up with 42 as basically a random number.</p>
<p>Just, you know, the author just pulled it out of a hat</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s admitted so.</p>
<p>He said, well, 42 just seemed like just random numbers any.</p>
<p>But in fact, there&rsquo;s many numbers that are linked to 42.</p>
<p>So 42, again, just to summarize,</p>
<p>is the answer that these super mega computer</p>
<p>that had computed for a million years</p>
<p>with the most powerful computer in the world</p>
<p>had come up with.</p>
<p>At some point, the computer says,</p>
<p>I have an answer.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re not gonna like it.</p>
<p>Like, what is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 42.</p>
<p>And then the irony is that they had forgotten, of course,</p>
<p>what the question was.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So now they have to build a bigger computer</p>
<p>to figure out what the question is,</p>
<p>to which the answer is 42.</p>
<p>So as I was turning 42,</p>
<p>I basically sort of researched</p>
<p>why 42 is such a cool number.</p>
<p>And it turns out that,</p>
<p>and I put together this little passage</p>
<p>that was explaining to all those guests</p>
<p>to my 42nd birthday party</p>
<p>why we were talking about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>And basically talked about how 42</p>
<p>is the angle at which light reflects off of water</p>
<p>to create a rainbow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so beautiful because the rainbow</p>
<p>is basically the combination of sort of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been raining, but there&rsquo;s hope</p>
<p>because the sun just came out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very beautiful number there.</p>
<p>So 42 is also the sum of all rows and columns</p>
<p>of a magic cube that contains all consecutive integers</p>
<p>starting at one.</p>
<p>So basically, if you take all integers</p>
<p>between one and however many vertices there are,</p>
<p>the sums is always 42.</p>
<p>42 is the only number left under 100</p>
<p>for which the equation of X to the cube</p>
<p>plus Y to the cube plus Z to the cube is N</p>
<p>and was not known to not have a solution.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s the only one that actually has a solution.</p>
<p>42 is also one, zero, one, zero, one, zero in binary.</p>
<p>Again, the yin and the yang,</p>
<p>the good and the evil,</p>
<p>one and zero, the balance of the force.</p>
<p>42 is the number of chromosomes for the giant panda.</p>
<p>And the giant panda, I know it&rsquo;s totally random.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a suspicious symbol of great strength</p>
<p>coupled with peace, friendship, gentle temperament,</p>
<p>harmony, balance, and friendship</p>
<p>whose black and white colors again symbolize yin and yang.</p>
<p>The reason why it&rsquo;s the symbol for China</p>
<p>is exactly the strength, but yet peace and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So 42 chromosomes.</p>
<p>It takes light 10 to the minus 42 seconds</p>
<p>to cross the diameter of a proton</p>
<p>connecting the two fundamental dimensions</p>
<p>of space and time.</p>
<p>42 is the number of times a piece of paper</p>
<p>should be folded to reach beyond the moon,</p>
<p>which is what I assume my students mean</p>
<p>when they ask that their paper reaches for the stars.</p>
<p>I just tell them just fold it a bunch of times.</p>
<p>42 is the number of messier object, 42, which is Orion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the most famous galaxies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s I think also the place where we can actually see</p>
<p>the center of our galaxy.</p>
<p>42 is the numeric representation of the star symbol</p>
<p>in ASCII, which is very useful</p>
<p>when searching for the stars.</p>
<p>And also a reg exp for life, the universe and everything.</p>
<p>So star, in Egyptian mythology, the goddess Maat</p>
<p>which was personifying truth and justice</p>
<p>would ask 42 questions to every dying person.</p>
<p>And those answering successfully would become stars</p>
<p>continued to give life and fuel universal growth.</p>
<p>In Judaic tradition, God ascribe the 42 lettered name</p>
<p>and trusted only to the middle age pious meek</p>
<p>free from bad temper, sober and not insistent on his rights.</p>
<p>And in Christian tradition, there&rsquo;s 42 generations</p>
<p>from Abraham, Isaac, that we talked about,</p>
<p>the story of Isaac, Jacob, eventually Joseph, Mary and Jesus.</p>
<p>In Kabbalistic tradition, Elocha, which is 42</p>
<p>is the number with which God creates the universe</p>
<p>starting with 25, let there be and ending with 70, good.</p>
<p>So 25 plus, you know, 17, there&rsquo;s a 42 chapter sutra,</p>
<p>which is the first Indian religious tradition</p>
<p>which is the first Indian religious scripture</p>
<p>which was translated to Chinese,</p>
<p>thus introducing Buddhism to China from India.</p>
<p>The 42 line Bible was the first printed book</p>
<p>marking the age of printing in the 1450s</p>
<p>and the dissemination of knowledge</p>
<p>eventually leading to the enlightenment.</p>
<p>A yeast cell, which is called a single cell eukaryote</p>
<p>and the subject of my PhD research</p>
<p>has exactly 42 million proteins.</p>
<p>Anyway, so there&rsquo;s a series of 42.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on fire with this, these are really good.</p>
<p>So I guess what you&rsquo;re saying is just a random number.</p>
<p>Yeah, basically.</p>
<p>So all of these are backronyms.</p>
<p>So, you know, after you have the number,</p>
<p>you figure out why that number.</p>
<p>So anyway, so now that we&rsquo;ve spoken about Y42,</p>
<p>why do we search for meaning?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re asking, you know, will that search</p>
<p>ultimately lead to our destruction?</p>
<p>And my thinking is exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>So basically that asking about meaning</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s so inherent to human nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that makes life beautiful</p>
<p>that makes it worth living.</p>
<p>And that searching for meaning is actually the point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the finding it.</p>
<p>I think when you found it, you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever be satisfied that, you know, I&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>So I like to say that life is lived forward</p>
<p>but it only makes sense backward.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t remember whose quote that is,</p>
<p>but the whole search itself is the meaning.</p>
<p>And what I love about it is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a double search going on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a search in every one of us</p>
<p>through our own lives to find meaning.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a search which is happening</p>
<p>for humanity itself to find our meaning.</p>
<p>And we as humans like to look at animals and say,</p>
<p>of course they have a meaning.</p>
<p>Like a dog has its meaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a bunch of instincts, you know,</p>
<p>running around, loving everything.</p>
<p>You know, remember our joke with a cat and the dog.</p>
<p>Yeah, cat has no meaning.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>So, and I&rsquo;m noticing the yin yang symbol right here</p>
<p>with this whole panda, black and white and the 0102.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on fire with that 42.</p>
<p>Some of those are gold ASCII value for a star symbol.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>So basically in my view, the search for meaning</p>
<p>and the act of searching for something more meaningful</p>
<p>is life&rsquo;s meaning by itself.</p>
<p>The fact that we kind of always hope that,</p>
<p>yes, maybe for animals that&rsquo;s not the case,</p>
<p>but maybe humans have something that we should be doing</p>
<p>and something else.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about procreation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about dominance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about strength and feeding, et cetera.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re the one species that spends such a tiny,</p>
<p>little minority of its time feeding</p>
<p>that we have this enormous, huge cognitive capability</p>
<p>that we can just use for all kinds of other stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where art comes in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the healthy mind comes in</p>
<p>with exploring all of these different aspects</p>
<p>that are just not directly tied to a purpose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not directly tied to a function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just the playing of life.</p>
<p>The, you know, not for particular reason.</p>
<p>Do you think this thing we got,</p>
<p>this mind is unique in the universe</p>
<p>in terms of how difficult it is to build?</p>
<p>Is it possible that we&rsquo;re the most beautiful thing</p>
<p>that the universe has constructed?</p>
<p>Both the most beautiful and the most ugly,</p>
<p>but certainly the most complex.</p>
<p>So look at evolutionary time.</p>
<p>The dinosaurs ruled the earth for 135 million years.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been around for a million years.</p>
<p>So one versus 135.</p>
<p>So dinosaurs were extinct, you know,</p>
<p>about 60 million years ago</p>
<p>and mammals that had been happily evolving</p>
<p>as tiny little creatures for 30 million years</p>
<p>then took over the planet and then, you know,</p>
<p>dramatically radiated about 60 million years ago.</p>
<p>Out of these mammals came the neocortex formation.</p>
<p>So basically the neocortex,</p>
<p>which is sort of the outer layer of our brain</p>
<p>compared to our quote unquote reptilian brain,</p>
<p>which we share the structure of with all of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have that and yet they ruled the planet.</p>
<p>So how many other planets have still, you know,</p>
<p>mindless dinosaurs where strength</p>
<p>was the only dimension ruling the planet?</p>
<p>So there was something weird that annihilated the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>And again, you could look at biblical things</p>
<p>of sort of God coming and wiping out his creatures</p>
<p>to make room for the next ones.</p>
<p>So the mammals basically sort of took over the planet</p>
<p>and then grew this cognitive capability</p>
<p>of this general purpose machine.</p>
<p>And primates push that to extreme</p>
<p>and humans among primates have just exploded that hardware.</p>
<p>But that hardware is selected for survival.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s selected for procreation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s initially selected with his very simple</p>
<p>Darwinian view of the world of random mutation,</p>
<p>ruthless selection, and then selection</p>
<p>for making more of yourself.</p>
<p>If you look at human cognition,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gone down a weird evolutionary path</p>
<p>in the sense that we are expanding</p>
<p>an enormous amount of energy on this apparatus</p>
<p>between our ears that is wasting, what,</p>
<p>15% of our bodily energy, 20%,</p>
<p>like some enormous percentage of our calories</p>
<p>go to function our brain.</p>
<p>No other species makes that big of a commitment.</p>
<p>That has basically taken energetic changes</p>
<p>for efficiency on the metabolic side for humanity</p>
<p>to basically power that thing.</p>
<p>And our brain is both enormously more efficient</p>
<p>than other brains, but also, despite this efficiency,</p>
<p>enormously more energy consuming.</p>
<p>So, and if you look at just the sheer folds</p>
<p>that the human brain has, again, our skull could only</p>
<p>grow so much before it could no longer go</p>
<p>through the pelvic opening and kill the mother</p>
<p>at every birth, so, but yet the folds continued</p>
<p>effectively creating just so much more capacity.</p>
<p>The evolutionary context in which this was made</p>
<p>is enormously fascinating, and it has to do with</p>
<p>other humans that we have now killed off</p>
<p>or that have gone extinct.</p>
<p>And that has now created this weird place of humans</p>
<p>on the planet as the only species</p>
<p>that has this enormous hardware.</p>
<p>So that can basically make us think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something very weird and unique</p>
<p>that happened in human evolution that perhaps</p>
<p>has not been recreated elsewhere. Maybe the asteroid</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t hit, you know, sister earth,</p>
<p>and dinosaurs are still ruling, and, you know,</p>
<p>any kind of proto human is squished</p>
<p>and eaten for breakfast basically.</p>
<p>However, we&rsquo;re not as unique as we like to think</p>
<p>because there was this enormous diversity</p>
<p>of other human like forms.</p>
<p>And once you make it to that stage where you have</p>
<p>a neocortex like explosion of, wow, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>competing on intelligence, and we&rsquo;re not competing</p>
<p>on social structures, and we&rsquo;re not competing</p>
<p>on larger and larger groups, and being able to</p>
<p>coordinate and being able to have empathy,</p>
<p>the concept of empathy, the concept of an ego,</p>
<p>the concept of a self, of self awareness,</p>
<p>comes probably from being able to project</p>
<p>another person&rsquo;s intentions,</p>
<p>another person&rsquo;s intentions to understand</p>
<p>what they mean when you have these large cognitive groups,</p>
<p>large social groups.</p>
<p>So me being able to sort of create a mental model</p>
<p>of how you think may have come before I was able</p>
<p>to create a personal mental model of how do I think.</p>
<p>So this introspection probably came after this sort</p>
<p>of projection and this empathy, which basically means,</p>
<p>you know, passion, pathos, suffering,</p>
<p>but basically sensing.</p>
<p>So basically empathy means feeling what you&rsquo;re feeling,</p>
<p>trying to project your emotional state</p>
<p>onto my cognitive apparatus.</p>
<p>And I think that is what eventually led</p>
<p>to this enormous cognitive explosion</p>
<p>that happened in humanity.</p>
<p>So, you know, life itself in my view is inevitable</p>
<p>on every planet.</p>
<p>Inevitable. Inevitable.</p>
<p>But the evolution of life to self awareness and cognition</p>
<p>and all the incredible things that humans have done,</p>
<p>you know, that might not be as inevitable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your intuition.</p>
<p>So if you were to sort of estimate and bet some money on it,</p>
<p>if we reran Earth a million times,</p>
<p>would what we got now be the most special thing</p>
<p>and how often would it be?</p>
<p>So scientifically speaking, how repeatable is this experiment?</p>
<p>So this whole cognitive revolution?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>Basically, I feel that the longevity of, you know,</p>
<p>dinosaurs suggests that it was not quite inevitable</p>
<p>that we humans eventually made it.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re also implying one thing here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, you&rsquo;re implying that humans</p>
<p>also don&rsquo;t have this longevity.</p>
<p>This is the interesting question.</p>
<p>So with the Fermi Paradox, the idea that the basic question</p>
<p>is like, if the universe has a lot of alien life forms in it,</p>
<p>why haven&rsquo;t we seen them?</p>
<p>And one thought is that there&rsquo;s a great filter</p>
<p>or multiple great filters that basically would destroy</p>
<p>intelligent civilizations.</p>
<p>Like this thing that we, you know, this multifolding brain</p>
<p>that keeps growing may not be such a big feature.</p>
<p>It might be useful for survival,</p>
<p>but it like takes us down a side road</p>
<p>that is a very short one with a quick dead end.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>So I think the universe is enormous,</p>
<p>not just in space, but also in time.</p>
<p>And the pretense that, you know, the last blink</p>
<p>of an instant that we&rsquo;ve been able to send radio waves</p>
<p>is when somebody should have been paying attention</p>
<p>to our planet is a little ridiculous.</p>
<p>So my, you know, what I love about Star Wars</p>
<p>is a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like some distant future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>What I love about it is that basically says,</p>
<p>you know, evolution and civilization</p>
<p>are just so recent in, you know, on earth.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s countless other planets</p>
<p>that have probably all kinds of life forms,</p>
<p>multicellular perhaps, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But the fact that humanity has only been listening</p>
<p>and emitting for just this tiny little blink</p>
<p>means that any of these, you know, alien civilizations</p>
<p>would need to be paying attention</p>
<p>to every single insignificant planet out there.</p>
<p>And, you know, again, I mean, the movie Contact</p>
<p>and the book is just so beautiful.</p>
<p>This whole concept of we don&rsquo;t need to travel physically.</p>
<p>We can travel as light.</p>
<p>We can send instructions for people to create machines</p>
<p>that will allow us to beam down light</p>
<p>and recreate ourselves.</p>
<p>And in the book, you know, the aliens actually take over.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not as friendly.</p>
<p>But, you know, this concept that we have to eventually</p>
<p>go and conquer every planet.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that, yes,</p>
<p>we will become a galactic species.</p>
<p>So you have a hope, well, you said think, so.</p>
<p>Oh, of course, of course.</p>
<p>I mean, now that we&rsquo;ve made it so far.</p>
<p>So you feel like we&rsquo;ve made it.</p>
<p>Oh gosh, I feel that, you know, cognition,</p>
<p>the cognition as an evolutionary trait</p>
<p>has won over in our planet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that we&rsquo;ve made it.</p>
<p>So basically humans have won the battle for, you know,</p>
<p>dominance.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the case with dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, yes, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some claims of intelligence.</p>
<p>And if you look at Jurassic Park, yeah, sure, whatever.</p>
<p>But, you know, they just don&rsquo;t have the hardware for it.</p>
<p>And humans have the hardware.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that mammals have</p>
<p>a dramatically improved hardware</p>
<p>for cognition over dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Like basically there&rsquo;s universes where strength won out.</p>
<p>And in our planet, in our, you know,</p>
<p>particular version of whatever happened in this planet,</p>
<p>cognition won out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a privilege, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like living in Boston instead of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, some middle age place</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s like hitting each other</p>
<p>with, you know, weapons and sticks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re back to the Lucky Ones song.</p>
<p>I mean, we are the lucky ones.</p>
<p>But the flip side of that is that this hardware</p>
<p>also allows us to develop weapons</p>
<p>and methods of destroying ourselves.</p>
<p>Again, I want to go back to Pinker</p>
<p>and the better angels of our nature.</p>
<p>The whole concept that civilization</p>
<p>and the act of civilizing</p>
<p>has dramatically reduced violence, dramatically.</p>
<p>If you look, you know, at every scale,</p>
<p>as soon as organization comes,</p>
<p>the state basically owns the right to violence.</p>
<p>And eventually the state gives that right</p>
<p>of governance to the people,</p>
<p>but violence has been eliminated by that state.</p>
<p>So this whole concept of central governance</p>
<p>and people agreeing to live together</p>
<p>and share responsibilities and duties</p>
<p>and, you know, all of that</p>
<p>is something that has led so much to less violence,</p>
<p>less death, less suffering, less, you know, poverty,</p>
<p>less, you know, war.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, we have the capability to destroy ourselves,</p>
<p>but the arc of civilization</p>
<p>has led to much, much less destruction,</p>
<p>much, much less war and much more peace.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s blips back and forth</p>
<p>and, you know, there are setbacks,</p>
<p>but again, the moral arc of the universe.</p>
<p>But it seems to just, I probably imagine</p>
<p>there were two dinosaurs back in the day</p>
<p>having this exact conversation</p>
<p>and they look up to the sky</p>
<p>and there seems to be something like an asteroid</p>
<p>going towards Earth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, while it&rsquo;s very true</p>
<p>that the arc of our society of human civilization</p>
<p>seems to be progressing towards a better, better life</p>
<p>for everybody in the many ways that you described,</p>
<p>things can change in a moment.</p>
<p>And it feels like it&rsquo;s not just us humans</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living through a pandemic.</p>
<p>You could imagine that a pandemic would be more destructive</p>
<p>or there could be asteroids that just appear</p>
<p>out of the darkness of space,</p>
<p>which I recently learned it&rsquo;s not that easy</p>
<p>to actually detect them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So 48, what happens in 48 years?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>2068, Apophis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an asteroid that&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>In 48 years, it has very high chance</p>
<p>of actually wiping us out completely.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So we have 48 years to get our act together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like some distant, distant hypothesis.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, sure, they&rsquo;re hard to detect</p>
<p>but this one we know about, it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>So how do you feel about that?</p>
<p>Why are you still so optimistic?</p>
<p>Oh gosh, I&rsquo;m so happy with where we are now.</p>
<p>This is gonna be great.</p>
<p>Seriously, if you look at progress,</p>
<p>if you look at, again, the speed with which knowledge</p>
<p>has been transferred, what has led to humanity</p>
<p>making so many advances so fast?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what has led to humanity making so many advances</p>
<p>is not just the hardware upgrades,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also the software upgrades.</p>
<p>So by hardware upgrades, I basically mean our neocortex</p>
<p>and the expansion and these layers</p>
<p>and folds of our brain and all of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hardware.</p>
<p>The software hasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, the hardware hasn&rsquo;t changed much</p>
<p>in the last, what, 70,000 years.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last time,</p>
<p>if you take a person from ancient Egypt</p>
<p>and you bring them up now, they&rsquo;re just as equally fit.</p>
<p>So hardware hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>What has changed is software.</p>
<p>What has changed is that we are growing up in societies</p>
<p>that are much more complex.</p>
<p>This whole concept of neoteny basically allows</p>
<p>our exponential growth.</p>
<p>The concept that our brain has not fully formed,</p>
<p>has not fully stabilized itself until after our teenage years.</p>
<p>So we basically have a good 16 years, 18 years</p>
<p>to sort of infuse it with the latest</p>
<p>and greatest in software.</p>
<p>If you look at what happened in ancient Greece,</p>
<p>why did everything explode at once?</p>
<p>My take on this is that it was the shift</p>
<p>from the Egyptian and hieroglyphic software</p>
<p>to the Greek language software.</p>
<p>This whole concept of creating abstract notions,</p>
<p>of creating these layers of cognition</p>
<p>and layers of meaning and layers of abstraction</p>
<p>for words and ideals and beauty and harmony.</p>
<p>How do you write harmony in hieroglyphics?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as, you know,</p>
<p>sort of expressing these ideals of peace and justice</p>
<p>and, you know, these concepts of,</p>
<p>or even, you know, macabre concepts of doom, et cetera.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the language for it.</p>
<p>Your brain has trouble getting at that concept.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that these software upgrades</p>
<p>for human language, human culture,</p>
<p>human environment, human education</p>
<p>have basically led to this enormous explosion of knowledge.</p>
<p>And eventually after the enlightenment,</p>
<p>and as I was mentioning the 42 line Bible</p>
<p>and the printed press, the dissemination of knowledge,</p>
<p>you basically now have this whole horizontal dispersion</p>
<p>of ideas in addition to the vertical inheritance of genes.</p>
<p>So the hardware improvements happen</p>
<p>through vertical inheritance.</p>
<p>The software improvements happen</p>
<p>through horizontal inheritance.</p>
<p>And the reason why human civilization exploded</p>
<p>is not a hardware change anymore,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really a software change.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re looking at now where we are today,</p>
<p>look at coronavirus.</p>
<p>Yes, sure, it could have killed us a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>it would have, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because in January, we published the genome.</p>
<p>A month later, less than a month later,</p>
<p>the first vaccine designs were done.</p>
<p>And now less than a year later, 10 months later,</p>
<p>we already have a working vaccine that&rsquo;s 90% efficient.</p>
<p>I mean, that is ridiculous by any standards.</p>
<p>And the reason is sharing.</p>
<p>So the asteroid, yes, could wipe us out in 48 years,</p>
<p>but 48 years?</p>
<p>I mean, look at where we were 48 years ago, technologically.</p>
<p>I mean, how much more we understand</p>
<p>the basic foundations of space is enormous.</p>
<p>The technological revolutions of digitization,</p>
<p>the amount of compute power we can put</p>
<p>on any nail size hardware is enormous.</p>
<p>And this is nowhere near ending.</p>
<p>We all have our little problems going back and forth</p>
<p>on the social side and on the political side,</p>
<p>on the sort of human side and the societal side,</p>
<p>but science has not slowed down.</p>
<p>Science is moving at a breakneck pace ahead.</p>
<p>So, you know, Elon is now putting rockets out</p>
<p>from the private space.</p>
<p>I mean, that now democratization of space exploration</p>
<p>is, you know, gonna revolutionize everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna explode, continue.</p>
<p>In the same way that every technology has exploded,</p>
<p>this is the shift to space technology exploding.</p>
<p>So 48 years is infinity from now</p>
<p>in terms of space capabilities.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not worried at all.</p>
<p>Are you excited by the possibility of a human,</p>
<p>well, one, a human stepping foot on Mars</p>
<p>and two, possible colonization of not necessarily Mars,</p>
<p>but other planets and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>for people living in space?</p>
<p>Inevitable.</p>
<p>Inevitable. Inevitable.</p>
<p>Would you do it?</p>
<p>Or do you kind of like Earth? Of course, of course.</p>
<p>You know, how many?</p>
<p>How many people will you wait?</p>
<p>Will you wait for, I think it was about</p>
<p>when the Declaration of Independence was signed,</p>
<p>about two to three million people lived here.</p>
<p>So would you move like before?</p>
<p>Would you be like on the first boat?</p>
<p>Would you be on the 10th boat?</p>
<p>Would you wait until the Declaration of Independence?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be on the short list</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll be old by then.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll probably get a bunch of younger people.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s the wisdom and the,</p>
<p>then again, you are the lucky one.</p>
<p>But wisdom can be transferred horizontally.</p>
<p>I gotta tell you, you are the lucky one.</p>
<p>So you might be on the list.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, I kind of feel like I would love</p>
<p>to see Earth from above, just to watch our planet.</p>
<p>I mean, just, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>you can watch a live feed of the space station.</p>
<p>Watching Earth is magnificent,</p>
<p>like this blue tiny little shield.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so thin, our atmosphere.</p>
<p>Like if you drive to New York,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically in outer space.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so thin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, again, such a privilege</p>
<p>to be on this planet, such a privilege.</p>
<p>But I think our species is in for big, good things.</p>
<p>I think that, you know,</p>
<p>we will overcome our little problems</p>
<p>and eventually come together as a species.</p>
<p>I feel that we&rsquo;re definitely on the path to that.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s just not permeated</p>
<p>through the whole universe yet.</p>
<p>I mean, through the whole world yet,</p>
<p>through the whole Earth yet,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely permeating.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve talked about humans as special.</p>
<p>How exactly are we special relative to the dinosaurs?</p>
<p>So I mentioned that there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>this dramatic cognitive improvement that we&rsquo;ve made,</p>
<p>but I think it goes much deeper than that.</p>
<p>So if you look at a lion attacking a gazelle</p>
<p>in the middle of the Serengeti,</p>
<p>the lion is smelling the molecules in the environment.</p>
<p>Its hormones and neuro receptors</p>
<p>are sort of getting it ready for impulse.</p>
<p>The target is constantly looking around and sensing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually been in Kenya and I&rsquo;ve kind of seen the hunt.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve kind of seen the sort of game of waiting</p>
<p>and the mitochondria in the muscles of the lion</p>
<p>are basically ready for, you know, jumping.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re expensing an enormous amount of energy.</p>
<p>The grass as it&rsquo;s flowing</p>
<p>is constantly transforming solar energy into chloroplasts,</p>
<p>you know, through the chloroplast into energy,</p>
<p>which eventually feeds the gazelle</p>
<p>and eventually feeds the lions.</p>
<p>And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So as humans, we experience all of that,</p>
<p>but the lion only experiences one layer.</p>
<p>The mitochondria in its body</p>
<p>are only experiencing one layer.</p>
<p>The chloroplasts are only experiencing one layer.</p>
<p>The, you know, photoreceptors and the smell receptors</p>
<p>and the chemical receptors,</p>
<p>like the lion always attacks against the wind</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s not smelled.</p>
<p>Like all of these things are one layer at a time.</p>
<p>And we humans somehow perceive the whole stack.</p>
<p>So going back to software infrastructure</p>
<p>and hardware infrastructure,</p>
<p>if you design a computer,</p>
<p>you basically have a physical layer that you start with.</p>
<p>And then on top of that physical layer,</p>
<p>you have, you know, the electrical layer.</p>
<p>And on top of the electrical layer,</p>
<p>you have basically gates and logic and an assembly layer.</p>
<p>And on top of the assembly layer,</p>
<p>you have your, you know, higher order,</p>
<p>higher level programming.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>you have your deep learning routine, et cetera.</p>
<p>And on top of that,</p>
<p>you eventually build a cognitive system that&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>I want you to now picture this cognitive system</p>
<p>becoming not just self aware,</p>
<p>but also becoming aware of the hardware that it&rsquo;s made of</p>
<p>and the atoms that it&rsquo;s made of and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s as if your AI system,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this beautiful scene in 2001 Odyssey of Space,</p>
<p>where Hull, after Dave starts disconnecting him,</p>
<p>is starting to sing a song about daisies, et cetera.</p>
<p>And Hull is basically saying, Dave, I&rsquo;m losing my mind.</p>
<p>I can feel I&rsquo;m losing my mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>This concept of self awareness of knowing</p>
<p>that the hardware is no longer there is amazing.</p>
<p>And in the same way humans who have had accidents</p>
<p>are aware that they&rsquo;ve had accidents.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this self awareness of AI</p>
<p>that is, you know, this beautiful concept about,</p>
<p>you know, sort of the eventual cognitive leap</p>
<p>to self awareness.</p>
<p>But imagine now the AI system</p>
<p>actually breaking through these layers</p>
<p>and saying, wait a minute,</p>
<p>I think I can design a slightly better hardware</p>
<p>to get me functioning better.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what basically humans are doing.</p>
<p>So if you look at our reasoning layer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s built on top of a cognitive layer.</p>
<p>And the reasoning layer we share with AI,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Like there is another thing on the planet</p>
<p>that can integrate equations and it&rsquo;s manmade,</p>
<p>but we share computation with them.</p>
<p>We share this cognitive layer of playing chess.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not alone anymore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not the only thing on the planet that plays chess.</p>
<p>Now we have AI that also plays chess.</p>
<p>But in some sense that that particular organism,</p>
<p>AI as it is now only operates in that layer.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then most animals operate</p>
<p>in the sort of cognitive layer that we&rsquo;re all experiencing.</p>
<p>A bat is doing this incredible integration of signals,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not aware of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically constantly sending echo location waves</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s receiving them back.</p>
<p>And multiple bats in the same cave</p>
<p>are operating at slightly different frequencies</p>
<p>and with slightly different pulses.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all sensing objects</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing motion planning</p>
<p>in their cognitive hardware,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not even aware of all of that.</p>
<p>All they know is that they have a 3D view of space</p>
<p>around them, just like any gazelle walking through,</p>
<p>you know, the desert.</p>
<p>And any baby looking around is aware of things</p>
<p>without doing the math of how am I processing</p>
<p>all of these visual information, et cetera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just aware of the layer that you live in.</p>
<p>I think if you look at this, at humanity,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve basically managed through our cognitive layer,</p>
<p>through our perception layer, through our senses layer,</p>
<p>through our multi organ layer, through our genetic layer,</p>
<p>through our molecular layer, through our atomic layer,</p>
<p>through our quantum layer,</p>
<p>through even the very fabric of the space time continuum</p>
<p>unite all of that cognitively.</p>
<p>So as we&rsquo;re watching that scene in the Serengeti,</p>
<p>we as scientists, we as educated humans,</p>
<p>we as, you know, anyone who&rsquo;s finished high school</p>
<p>are aware of all of this beauty</p>
<p>of all of these different layers interplaying together.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s something very unique</p>
<p>in perhaps not just the galaxy, but maybe even the cosmos.</p>
<p>This species that has managed to in space</p>
<p>cross through these layers from the enormous</p>
<p>to the infinitely small.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I love about particle physics.</p>
<p>The fact that it actually unites everything.</p>
<p>The very small and the very big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only through the very big</p>
<p>that the very small gets formed.</p>
<p>Like basically every atom of gold</p>
<p>results from the fusion that happened</p>
<p>of increasingly large particles before that explosion</p>
<p>that then disperses it through the cosmos.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only through understanding the very large</p>
<p>that we understand the very small and vice versa.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in space.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the time direction.</p>
<p>As you are watching the Kilimanjaro mountain,</p>
<p>you can kind of look back through time</p>
<p>to when that volcano was exploding</p>
<p>and growing out of the tectonic forces.</p>
<p>As you drive through Death Valley,</p>
<p>you see these mountains on their side</p>
<p>and these layers of history exposed.</p>
<p>We are aware of the eons that have happened on earth</p>
<p>and the tectonic movements on earth.</p>
<p>The same way that we&rsquo;re aware of the Big Bang</p>
<p>and the early evolution of the cosmos.</p>
<p>And we can also see forward in time</p>
<p>as to where the universe is heading.</p>
<p>We can see Apophis in 2068 coming over,</p>
<p>looking ahead in time.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be magician stuff in ancient times.</p>
<p>So what I love about humanity and its role in the universe</p>
<p>is that if there&rsquo;s a God watching,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, finally, somebody figured it out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been building all these beautiful things</p>
<p>and somebody can appreciate it.</p>
<p>And figured me out from God&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>meaning become aware of, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>to think of the world in this way as layers</p>
<p>and us humans are able to convert those layers</p>
<p>into ideas that you can then combine, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re doing some kind of conversion.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And last time you asked me about</p>
<p>whether we live in a simulation, for example.</p>
<p>I mean, realize that we are living in a simulation.</p>
<p>We are, the reality that we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>without any sort of person programming this is a simulation.</p>
<p>Like basically what happens inside your skull?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this integration of sensory inputs</p>
<p>which are translated into perceptory signals,</p>
<p>which are then translated into a conceptual model</p>
<p>of the world around you.</p>
<p>And that exercise is happening seamlessly.</p>
<p>And yet, you know, if you think about sort of, again,</p>
<p>this whole simulation and Neo analogy,</p>
<p>you can think of the reality that we live in as a matrix,</p>
<p>as the matrix, but we&rsquo;ve actually broken through the matrix.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually traversed the layers.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have to take a pill, like we didn&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>Morpheus didn&rsquo;t have to show up</p>
<p>to basically give us the blue pill or the red pill.</p>
<p>We were able to sufficiently evolve cognitively</p>
<p>through the hardware explosion</p>
<p>and sufficiently evolve scientifically</p>
<p>through the software explosion</p>
<p>to basically get at breaking through the matrix,</p>
<p>realizing that we live in a matrix</p>
<p>and realizing that we are this thing in there.</p>
<p>And yet that thing in there has a consciousness</p>
<p>that lives through all these layers.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re the only species.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the only thing that we even can think of</p>
<p>that has actually done that,</p>
<p>that has sort of permeated space and time scales</p>
<p>and layers of abstraction plowing through them</p>
<p>and realizing what we&rsquo;re really, really made of.</p>
<p>And the next frontier is of course, cognition.</p>
<p>So we understand so much of the cosmos,</p>
<p>so much of the stuff around us,</p>
<p>but the stuff inside here, finding the basis for the soul,</p>
<p>finding the basis for the ego, for the self,</p>
<p>the self awareness, when does the spark happen</p>
<p>that basically sort of makes you you?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really the next frontier.</p>
<p>So in terms of these peeling off layers of complexity,</p>
<p>somewhere between the cognitive layer</p>
<p>and the reasoning layer or the computational layer,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still some stuff to be figured out there.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the final frontier</p>
<p>of sort of completing our journey through that matrix.</p>
<p>And maybe duplicating it in other versions of ourselves</p>
<p>through AI, which is another very exciting possibility.</p>
<p>What I love about AI and the way that it operates right now</p>
<p>is the fact that it is unpredictable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s emergent behavior</p>
<p>in our cognitively capable artificial systems</p>
<p>that we can certainly model,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t encode directly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a key difference.</p>
<p>So we like to say, oh, of course,</p>
<p>this is not really intelligent because we coded it up.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve just put in these little parameters there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like six billion parameters</p>
<p>and once you&rsquo;ve learned them,</p>
<p>we kind of understand the layers.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s an oversimplification.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, oh, of course, humans,</p>
<p>we understand humans, they&rsquo;re just made out of neurons</p>
<p>and layers of cortex and there&rsquo;s a visual area.</p>
<p>But every human is encoded</p>
<p>by a ridiculously small number of genes</p>
<p>compared to the complexity of our cognitive apparatus.</p>
<p>20,000 genes is really not that much</p>
<p>out of which a tiny little fraction</p>
<p>are in fact encoding all of our cognitive functions.</p>
<p>The rest is emergent behavior.</p>
<p>The rest is the cortical layers</p>
<p>doing their thing in the same way</p>
<p>that when we build these conversational systems</p>
<p>or these cognitive systems or these deep learning systems,</p>
<p>we put the architecture in place,</p>
<p>but then they do their thing.</p>
<p>And in some ways,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creating something that has its own identity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s creating something that&rsquo;s not just,</p>
<p>oh yeah, it&rsquo;s not the early AI</p>
<p>where if you hadn&rsquo;t programmed</p>
<p>what happens in the grocery bags</p>
<p>when you have both cold and hot and hard and soft,</p>
<p>the system wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>No, no, you basically now just program the primitives</p>
<p>and then it learns from that.</p>
<p>So even though the origins are humble,</p>
<p>just like it is for our genetic code,</p>
<p>for AI, even though the origins are humble,</p>
<p>the result of it being deployed into the world</p>
<p>is infinitely complex.</p>
<p>And yet, it&rsquo;s not yet able to be cognizant</p>
<p>of all the other layers of its,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not able to think about space and time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not able to think about the hardware in which it runs,</p>
<p>the electricity in which it runs yet.</p>
<p>So if you look at humans,</p>
<p>we basically have the same cognitive architecture</p>
<p>as monkeys, as the great apes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a ton more of it.</p>
<p>If you look at GPT3 versus GPT2,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s the same architecture, just more of it.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s able to do so much more.</p>
<p>So if you start thinking about sort of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the future of that, GPT4 and GPT5,</p>
<p>do you really need fundamentally different architectures</p>
<p>or do you just need a ton more hardware?</p>
<p>And we do have a ton more hardware.</p>
<p>Like these systems are nowhere near</p>
<p>what humans have between our ears.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s something to be said</p>
<p>about stay tuned for emergent behavior.</p>
<p>We keep thinking that general intelligence</p>
<p>might just be forever away,</p>
<p>but it could just simply be that</p>
<p>we just need a ton more hardware</p>
<p>and that humans are just not that different</p>
<p>from the great apes, except for just a ton more of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting that in the AI community,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a human centric fear,</p>
<p>but the notion that GPT10 will achieve general intelligence</p>
<p>is something that people shy away from,</p>
<p>that there has to be something totally different</p>
<p>and new added to this.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s not seriously considered that</p>
<p>this very simple thing, this very simple architecture,</p>
<p>when scaled, might be the thing</p>
<p>that achieves super intelligence.</p>
<p>And people think the same way about humanity</p>
<p>and human consciousness.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh, consciousness might be quantum,</p>
<p>or it might be, you know, some nonphysical thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, or it could just be a lot more</p>
<p>of the same hardware that now is sufficiently capable</p>
<p>of self awareness just because it has the neurons to do it.</p>
<p>So maybe the consciousness that is so elusive</p>
<p>is an emergent behavior of you basically string together</p>
<p>all these cognitive capabilities that come from running,</p>
<p>from seeing, for reacting,</p>
<p>from predicting the movement of a fly</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re catching it through the air.</p>
<p>All of these things are just like great lookup tables</p>
<p>encoded in a giant neural network.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m oversimplifying, of course,</p>
<p>the complexity and the diversity of the different types</p>
<p>of excitatory and inhibitory neurons,</p>
<p>the wave forms that sort of shine through</p>
<p>the connections across all these different layers,</p>
<p>the amalgamation of signals, et cetera.</p>
<p>The brain is enormously complex.</p>
<p>I mean, of course.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s a small number of primitives</p>
<p>encoded by a tiny number of genes,</p>
<p>which are self organized and shaped by their environment.</p>
<p>Babies that are growing up today</p>
<p>are listening to language from conception.</p>
<p>Basically, as soon as the auditory apparatus forms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already getting shaped to the types of signals</p>
<p>that are out in the real world today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like, oh, have an Egyptian be born</p>
<p>and then ship them over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, no, that Egyptian would be listening in</p>
<p>to the complexity of the world and then getting born</p>
<p>and sort of seeing just how much more complex the world is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a combination of the underlying hardware,</p>
<p>which if you think about as a geneticist,</p>
<p>in my view, the hardware gives you an upper bound</p>
<p>of cognitive capabilities,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the environment that makes those capabilities shine</p>
<p>and reach their maximum.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re a combination of nature and nurture.</p>
<p>The nature is our genes and our cognitive apparatus.</p>
<p>And the nurture is the richness of the environment</p>
<p>that makes that cognitive apparatus reach its potential.</p>
<p>And we are so far from reaching our full potential, so far.</p>
<p>I think that kids being born a hundred years from now,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be looking at us now and saying</p>
<p>what primitive educational systems they had.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe people were not wired</p>
<p>into this virtual reality from birth as we are now,</p>
<p>cause like they&rsquo;re clearly inferior and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I basically think that our environment</p>
<p>will continue exploding and our cognitive capabilities,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like, oh, we&rsquo;re only using 10% of our brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re using 100% of our brain,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still constrained by how complex</p>
<p>our environment is.</p>
<p>So the hardware will remain the same, but the software,</p>
<p>in a quickly advancing environment,</p>
<p>the software will make a huge difference</p>
<p>in the nature of like the human experience,</p>
<p>the human condition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think that humans will look</p>
<p>very different a hundred years from now,</p>
<p>just because the environment changed,</p>
<p>even though we&rsquo;re still the same great apes,</p>
<p>the descendant of apes.</p>
<p>At the core of this is kind of a notion of ideas</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people, including you,</p>
<p>eloquently about this topic,</p>
<p>but Richard Dawkins talks about the notion of memes</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say this notion of ideas,</p>
<p>multiplying, selecting in the minds of humans.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about ideas from that perspective,</p>
<p>ideas as organisms themselves</p>
<p>that are breeding in the minds of humans?</p>
<p>I love the concept of memes.</p>
<p>I love the concept of these horizontal transfer of ideas</p>
<p>and sort of permeating through our layer</p>
<p>of interconnected neural networks.</p>
<p>So you can think of sort of the cognitive space</p>
<p>that has now connected all of humanity,</p>
<p>where we are now one giant information</p>
<p>and idea sharing network,</p>
<p>well beyond what was thought to be ever capable</p>
<p>when the concept of a meme was created by Richard Dawkins.</p>
<p>So, but I wanna take that concept</p>
<p>just into another twist,</p>
<p>which is the horizontal transfer of humans with fellowships.</p>
<p>And the fact that as people apply to MIT</p>
<p>from around the world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a selection that happens,</p>
<p>not just for their ideas,</p>
<p>but also for the cognitive hardware</p>
<p>that came up with those ideas.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t just ship ideas around anymore.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t evolve in a vacuum.</p>
<p>The ideas themselves influence the distribution</p>
<p>of cognitive systems, i.e. humans and brains</p>
<p>around the planet.</p>
<p>Yeah, we ship them to different locations</p>
<p>based on their properties.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So those cognitive systems that think of physics,</p>
<p>for example, might go to CERN</p>
<p>and those that think of genomics</p>
<p>might go to the Broad Institute.</p>
<p>And those that think of computer science</p>
<p>might go to, I don&rsquo;t know, Stanford or CMU or MIT.</p>
<p>And you basically have this co evolution now</p>
<p>of memes and ideas</p>
<p>and the cognitive conversational systems</p>
<p>that love these ideas and feed on these ideas</p>
<p>and understand these ideas and appreciate these ideas</p>
<p>now coming together.</p>
<p>So you basically have students coming to Boston to study</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the place</p>
<p>where these types of cognitive systems thrive.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re selected based on their cognitive output</p>
<p>and their idea output.</p>
<p>But once they get into that place,</p>
<p>the boiling and interbreeding of these memes</p>
<p>becomes so much more frequent.</p>
<p>That what comes out of it is so far beyond</p>
<p>if ideas were evolving in a vacuum</p>
<p>of an already established hardware,</p>
<p>cognitive interconnection system of the planet,</p>
<p>where now you basically have the ideas</p>
<p>shaping the distribution of these systems.</p>
<p>And then the genetics kick in as well.</p>
<p>You basically have now these people</p>
<p>who came to be a student kind of like myself</p>
<p>who now stuck around and are now professors</p>
<p>bringing up our own genetically encoded</p>
<p>and genetically related cognitive systems,</p>
<p>mine are eight, six and three years old,</p>
<p>who are now growing up in an environment</p>
<p>surrounded by other cognitive systems of a similar age</p>
<p>with parents who love these types of thinking and ideas.</p>
<p>And you basically have a whole interbreeding now</p>
<p>of genetically selected transfer of cognitive systems</p>
<p>where the genes and the memes are co evolving</p>
<p>the same soup of ever improving knowledge</p>
<p>and societal inter fertilization,</p>
<p>cross fertilization of these ideas.</p>
<p>So this beautiful image.</p>
<p>So this is shipping these actual meat cognitive systems</p>
<p>to physical locations.</p>
<p>They tend to cluster in the biology ones,</p>
<p>and the biology ones cluster in a certain building too.</p>
<p>So like within that there&rsquo;s clusters on top of clusters,</p>
<p>top of clusters.</p>
<p>What about in the online world?</p>
<p>Is that, do you also see that kind of,</p>
<p>because people now form groups on the internet</p>
<p>that they stick together so they can sort of,</p>
<p>these cognitive systems can collect themselves</p>
<p>and breed together in different layers of spaces.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t just have to be physical space.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>So basically there&rsquo;s the physical rearrangement,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the conglomeration</p>
<p>of the same cognitive system.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t need to be, i.e. human.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t need to belong to only one community.</p>
<p>So yes, you might be a member</p>
<p>of the computer science department,</p>
<p>but you can also hang out in the biology department.</p>
<p>But you might also go online into,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, poetry department readings</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Or you might be part of a group</p>
<p>that only has 12 people in the world,</p>
<p>but that are connected through their ideas</p>
<p>and are now interbreeding these ideas in a whole other way.</p>
<p>So this coevolution of genes and memes</p>
<p>is not just physically instantiated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also sort of rearranged in this cognitive space as well.</p>
<p>And sometimes these cognitive systems hold conferences</p>
<p>and they all gather around</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like one of them is like talking</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all like listening</p>
<p>and then they discuss and then they have free lunch</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>No, but then that&rsquo;s where you find students</p>
<p>where when I go to a conference,</p>
<p>I go through the posters where I&rsquo;m on a mission.</p>
<p>Basically my mission is to read and understand</p>
<p>what every poster is about.</p>
<p>And for a few of them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll dive deeply and understand everything,</p>
<p>but I make it a point to just go poster after poster</p>
<p>in order to read all of them.</p>
<p>And I find some gems and students that I speak to</p>
<p>that sometimes eventually join my lab.</p>
<p>And then sort of you&rsquo;re sort of creating this permeation</p>
<p>of the transfer of ideas, of ways of thinking</p>
<p>and very often of moral values, of social structures,</p>
<p>of just more imperceptible properties</p>
<p>of these cognitive systems</p>
<p>that simply just cling together.</p>
<p>Basically, I have the luxury at MIT</p>
<p>of not just choosing smart people,</p>
<p>but choosing smart people who I get along with,</p>
<p>who are generous and friendly and creative and smart</p>
<p>and excited and childish in their uninhibited behaviors</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So you basically can choose yourself to surround,</p>
<p>you can choose to surround yourself</p>
<p>with people who are not only cognitively compatible,</p>
<p>but also imperceptibly</p>
<p>through the meta cognitive systems compatible.</p>
<p>And again, when I say compatible, not all the same.</p>
<p>Sometimes, not sometimes, all the time.</p>
<p>The teams are made out of complimentary components,</p>
<p>not just compatible, but very often complimentary.</p>
<p>So in my own team, I have a diversity of students</p>
<p>who come from very different backgrounds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole spectrum of biology to computation,</p>
<p>of course, but within biology, there&rsquo;s a lot of realms.</p>
<p>Within computation, there&rsquo;s a lot of realms.</p>
<p>And what makes us click so well together</p>
<p>is the fact that not only do we have a common mission,</p>
<p>a common passion and a common view of the world,</p>
<p>but that we&rsquo;re complimentary in our skills,</p>
<p>in our angles with which we come at it and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of what makes it click.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating that the stickiness</p>
<p>of multiple cognitive systems together</p>
<p>includes both the commonality,</p>
<p>so you meet because there&rsquo;s some common thing,</p>
<p>but you stick together because you&rsquo;re different</p>
<p>in all the useful ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And my wife and I, I mean, we adore each other to pieces,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also extremely different in many ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s beautiful. Careful.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gonna be listening to this.</p>
<p>But I love that about us.</p>
<p>I love the fact that I&rsquo;m living out there</p>
<p>in the world of ideas and I forget what day it is.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, well, at 8 a.m.,</p>
<p>the kids better be to school.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I do get yelled at, but I need it.</p>
<p>Basically, I need her as much as she needs me.</p>
<p>And she loves interacting with me and talking.</p>
<p>I mean, last night, we were talking about this</p>
<p>and I showed her the questions</p>
<p>and we were bouncing ideas off each other.</p>
<p>And it was just beautiful.</p>
<p>We basically have these, basically,</p>
<p>cognitive, let it all loose kind of dates</p>
<p>where we just bring papers</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re bouncing ideas, et cetera.</p>
<p>So we have extremely different perspectives,</p>
<p>but very common goals and interests and anyway.</p>
<p>What do you make of the communication mechanism</p>
<p>that we humans use to share those ideas?</p>
<p>Because one essential element of all of this</p>
<p>is not just that we&rsquo;re able to have these ideas,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also able to share them.</p>
<p>We tend to, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but we seem to use language to share the ideas.</p>
<p>Maybe we share them in some much deeper way</p>
<p>than language, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But what do you make of this whole mechanism</p>
<p>that ghaf on the matlid is to the human condition?</p>
<p>So some people will tell you</p>
<p>that your language dictates your thoughts</p>
<p>and your thoughts cannot form outside language.</p>
<p>I tend to disagree.</p>
<p>I see thoughts as much more abstract</p>
<p>as basically when I dream, I don&rsquo;t dream in words.</p>
<p>I dream in shapes and forms and three dimensional space</p>
<p>with extreme detail.</p>
<p>I was describing, so when I wake up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night, I actually record my dreams.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write them down in a Dropbox file.</p>
<p>Other times I&rsquo;ll just dictate them in audio.</p>
<p>And my wife was giving me a massage the other day</p>
<p>cause like my left side was frozen</p>
<p>and I started playing the recording.</p>
<p>And as I was listening to it, I was like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember any of that.</p>
<p>And it was like, of course.</p>
<p>And then the entire thing came back.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s no way any other person</p>
<p>could have recreated that entire sort of</p>
<p>three dimensional shape and dream and concept.</p>
<p>And in the same way, when I&rsquo;m thinking of ideas,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many ideas I can&rsquo;t put to words.</p>
<p>I mean, I will describe them with a thousand words,</p>
<p>but the idea itself is much more precise</p>
<p>or much more sort of abstract</p>
<p>or much more something difference,</p>
<p>either less abstract or more abstract.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s either, basically there&rsquo;s just the projection</p>
<p>that happens from the three dimensional ideas</p>
<p>into let&rsquo;s say a one dimensional language.</p>
<p>And the language certainly gives you the apparatus</p>
<p>to think about concepts</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t realize existed before.</p>
<p>And with my team, we often create new words.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, now we&rsquo;re gonna call these</p>
<p>the regulatory plexus of a gene.</p>
<p>And that gives us now the language</p>
<p>to sort of build on that as one concept</p>
<p>that you then build upon with all kinds of other things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this coevolution again of ideas and language,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not one to one with each other.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about language itself, words, sentences.</p>
<p>This is a very distant construct</p>
<p>from where language actually begun.</p>
<p>So if you look at how we communicate,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m speaking, my eyes are shining</p>
<p>and my face is changing through all kinds of emotions.</p>
<p>And my entire body composition posture is reshaped.</p>
<p>And my intonation, the pauses that I make,</p>
<p>the softer and the louder and the this and that</p>
<p>are conveying so much more information.</p>
<p>And if you look at early human language,</p>
<p>and if you look at how the great apes</p>
<p>communicate with each other, there&rsquo;s a lot of grunting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of posturing, there&rsquo;s a lot of emotions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of sort of shrieking, et cetera.</p>
<p>They have a lot of components of our human language,</p>
<p>just not the words.</p>
<p>So I think of human communication</p>
<p>as combining the ape component,</p>
<p>but also of course the GPT3 component.</p>
<p>So basically there&rsquo;s the cognitive layer</p>
<p>and the reasoning layer that we share</p>
<p>with different parts of our relatives.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the AI relatives,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the grunting relatives.</p>
<p>And what I love about humanity is that we have both.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just a conversational system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a grunting, emotionally charged,</p>
<p>weirdly interconnected system</p>
<p>that also has the ability to reason.</p>
<p>And when we communicate with each other,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much more than just language.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much more than just words.</p>
<p>It does seem like we&rsquo;re able to somehow transfer</p>
<p>even more than the body language.</p>
<p>It seems that in the room with us</p>
<p>is always a giant knowledge base of shared experiences,</p>
<p>different perspectives on those experiences,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, the knowledge of who the last three,</p>
<p>four presidents in the United States was,</p>
<p>and just all the 9 11, the tragedies in 9 11,</p>
<p>all the beautiful and terrible things</p>
<p>that happen in the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re somehow both in our minds</p>
<p>and somehow enrich the ability to transfer information.</p>
<p>What I love about it is I can talk to you</p>
<p>about 2001 Odyssey of Space</p>
<p>and mention a very specific scene</p>
<p>and that evokes all these feelings that you had</p>
<p>when you first watched it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both visualizing that and maybe in different ways.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But in that, yeah, and not only that,</p>
<p>but the feeling is brought back up,</p>
<p>just like you said, with the dreams.</p>
<p>We both have that feeling arise in some form</p>
<p>as you bring up the child facing his own mortality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating that we&rsquo;re able to do that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about Neuralink for a second.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the concept of Neuralink?</p>
<p>The concept of Neuralink is that I&rsquo;m gonna take</p>
<p>whatever knowledge is encoded in my brain</p>
<p>directly transfer it into your brain.</p>
<p>So this is a beautiful, fascinating,</p>
<p>and extremely sort of appealing concept,</p>
<p>but I see a lot of challenges surrounding that.</p>
<p>The first one is we have no idea</p>
<p>how to even begin to understand</p>
<p>how knowledge is encoded in a person&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>I mean, I told you about this paper that we had recently</p>
<p>with Li Hui Cai and Asaf Marko</p>
<p>that basically was looking at these engrams</p>
<p>that are formed with combinations of neurons</p>
<p>that cofire when a stimulus happens,</p>
<p>where we can go into a mouse</p>
<p>and select those neurons that fire by marking them</p>
<p>and then see what happens when they first fire.</p>
<p>And then select the neurons that fire again</p>
<p>when the experience is repeated.</p>
<p>These are the recall neurons,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the memory consolidation neurons.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re starting to understand a little bit</p>
<p>of sort of the distributed nature of knowledge encoding</p>
<p>and experience encoding in the human brain</p>
<p>and in the mouse brain.</p>
<p>And the concept that we&rsquo;ll understand</p>
<p>that sufficiently one day</p>
<p>to be able to take a snapshot</p>
<p>of what does that scene from Dave losing his mind,</p>
<p>of Khal losing his mind and talking to Dave,</p>
<p>how is that seen and coded in your mind?</p>
<p>Imagine the complexity of that.</p>
<p>But now imagine, suppose that we solve this problem.</p>
<p>And the next enormous challenge is how do I go</p>
<p>and modify the next person&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>to now create the same exact neural connections?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an enormous challenge right there.</p>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s not just reading, it&rsquo;s now writing.</p>
<p>And again, what if something goes wrong?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna even think about that, that&rsquo;s number two.</p>
<p>And number three, who says that the way</p>
<p>that you encode Dave, I&rsquo;m losing my mind</p>
<p>and I encode Dave, I&rsquo;m losing my mind</p>
<p>is anywhere near each other.</p>
<p>Basically, maybe the way that I&rsquo;m encoding it</p>
<p>is twisted with my childhood memories of running through</p>
<p>the pebbles in Greece, and yours is twisted</p>
<p>with your childhood memories growing up in Russia.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way that I can take my encoding</p>
<p>and put it into your brain,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll A, mess things up,</p>
<p>and B, be incompatible with your own unique experiences.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s telepathic communication from human to human.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, you&rsquo;re reminding us</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s two biological systems</p>
<p>on both ends of that communication.</p>
<p>The easier, I guess, maybe half as difficult thing to do</p>
<p>in the hope with Neuralink is that we can communicate</p>
<p>with an AI system, so where one side of that</p>
<p>is a little bit more controllable,</p>
<p>but even just that is exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about two neuronal systems talking to each other.</p>
<p>Suppose that GPT4 tells GPT3, hey,</p>
<p>give me all your knowledge, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ready, I have 10 times more hardware,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready, just feed me.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s GPT3 gonna do?</p>
<p>Is it gonna say, oh, here&rsquo;s my 10 billion parameters?</p>
<p>No. No way.</p>
<p>The simplest way, and perhaps the fastest way</p>
<p>for GPT3 to transfer all its knowledge</p>
<p>to its older body that has a lot more hardware</p>
<p>is to regenerate every single possible human sentence</p>
<p>that it can possibly create.</p>
<p>Just keep talking.</p>
<p>Keep talking and just reencode it all together.</p>
<p>So maybe what language does is exactly that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking one generative cognitive model,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s running it forward to emit utterances</p>
<p>that kind of make sense in my cognitive frame,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s reencoding them into yours</p>
<p>through the parsing of that same language.</p>
<p>And I think the conversation might actually be</p>
<p>the most efficient way to do it,</p>
<p>so not just talking, but interactive,</p>
<p>so talking back and forth, asking questions, interrupting.</p>
<p>So GPT4 will constantly be interrupting.</p>
<p>Annoying. Annoying, yeah.</p>
<p>But the beauty of that is also that</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re interrupting each other,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all kinds of misinterpretations that happen,</p>
<p>that basically when my students speak,</p>
<p>I will often know that I&rsquo;m misunderstanding</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying, and I&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>hold that thought for a second.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I think I understood,</p>
<p>which I know is different from what you said.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll say that, and then someone else</p>
<p>in the same Zoom meeting</p>
<p>will basically say, well, here&rsquo;s another way</p>
<p>to think about what you just said.</p>
<p>And then by the third iteration,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re somewhere completely different,</p>
<p>that if we could actually communicate</p>
<p>with full neural network parameters back and forth</p>
<p>of that knowledge and idea and coding,</p>
<p>would be far inferior,</p>
<p>because the reencoding with our own,</p>
<p>as we said last time, emotional baggage</p>
<p>and cognitive baggage from our unique experiences</p>
<p>through our shared experiences, distinct encodings,</p>
<p>in the context of all our unique experiences,</p>
<p>is leading to so much more diversity of perspectives.</p>
<p>And again, going back to this whole concept of these,</p>
<p>entire network of all of human cognitive systems</p>
<p>connected to each other,</p>
<p>and sort of how ideas and memes permeate through that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of what really creates a whole new level</p>
<p>of human experience through this reasoning layer</p>
<p>and this computational layer</p>
<p>that obviously lives on top of our cognitive layer.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re one of these aforementioned cognitive systems,</p>
<p>mortal, but thoughtful, and you&rsquo;re connected to a bunch,</p>
<p>like you said, students, your wife, your kids.</p>
<p>What do you, in your brief time here on Earth,</p>
<p>this is a Meaning of Life episode,</p>
<p>so what do you hope this world will remember you as?</p>
<p>What do you hope your legacy will be?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of legacy as much as maybe most people.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s kind of funny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m consciously living the present.</p>
<p>Many students tell me, oh, give us some career advice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m the wrong person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never made a career plan.</p>
<p>I still have to make one.</p>
<p>I, it&rsquo;s funny to be both experiencing the past,</p>
<p>and the present, and the future,</p>
<p>but also consciously living in the present,</p>
<p>and just, there&rsquo;s a conscious decision we can make</p>
<p>to not worry about all that,</p>
<p>which again, goes back to the I&rsquo;m the lucky one kind of thing</p>
<p>of living in the present and being happy winning,</p>
<p>and being happy losing,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a sort of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy losing, and there&rsquo;s a certain freedom</p>
<p>that comes with that, but again,</p>
<p>a certain sort of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>ephemerity of living for the present,</p>
<p>but if you, if you stay back from all of that,</p>
<p>where basically my current modus operandi</p>
<p>is live for the present, make every day</p>
<p>the best you can make,</p>
<p>and just make the local blip of local maxima</p>
<p>of the universe, of the awesomeness of the planet,</p>
<p>and the town, and the family that we live in,</p>
<p>both academic family and biological family,</p>
<p>make it a little more awesome</p>
<p>by being generous to your friends,</p>
<p>being generous to the people around you,</p>
<p>being kind to your enemies,</p>
<p>and just showing love all around.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be upset at people if you truly love them.</p>
<p>If somebody yells at you and insults you</p>
<p>every time you say the slightest thing,</p>
<p>and yet when you see them, you just see them with love,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a beautiful feeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, I&rsquo;m feeling exactly like</p>
<p>when I look at my three year old who&rsquo;s like screaming,</p>
<p>even though I love her and I want her good,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s still screaming and saying, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I love you, genuinely love you,</p>
<p>but I can sort of kind of see that your brain</p>
<p>is kind of stuck in that little mode of anger.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s plenty of people out there who don&rsquo;t like me,</p>
<p>and I see them with love as a child</p>
<p>that is stuck in a cognitive state</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re eventually gonna snap out of,</p>
<p>or maybe not, and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that aspect of sort of experiencing life</p>
<p>with the best intentions.</p>
<p>And I love when I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>I had a friend who was like one of the smartest people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever met who would basically say,</p>
<p>oh, I love it when I&rsquo;m wrong</p>
<p>because it makes me feel human.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so beautiful.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s really one of the smartest people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>And she was like, oh, it&rsquo;s such a good feeling.</p>
<p>And I love being wrong, but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about self improvement.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about sort of how do I</p>
<p>not make the most mistakes, but attempt the most rights</p>
<p>and do the fewest wrongs,</p>
<p>but with the full knowledge that this will happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one aspect.</p>
<p>So through this life in the present,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really funny is,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve experienced more and more</p>
<p>really thanks to you and through this podcast,</p>
<p>is this enormous number of people who will basically comment,</p>
<p>wow, I&rsquo;ve been following this guy for so many years now,</p>
<p>or wow, this guy has inspired so many of us</p>
<p>in computation biology and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know any of that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m only discovering this now</p>
<p>through these sort of sharing our emotional states</p>
<p>and our cognitive states with a wider audience,</p>
<p>where suddenly I&rsquo;m sort of realizing that,</p>
<p>wow, maybe I&rsquo;ve had a legacy.</p>
<p>Like basically I&rsquo;ve trained generations of students</p>
<p>from MIT and I&rsquo;ve put all of my courses freely online</p>
<p>since 2001.</p>
<p>So basically all of my video recordings of my lectures</p>
<p>have been online since 2001.</p>
<p>So countless generations of people from across the world</p>
<p>will meet me at a conference and say,</p>
<p>like I was at this conference where somebody heard my voice</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, I know this voice,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to your lectures.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just such a beautiful thing where</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re sharing widely and who knows</p>
<p>which students will get where</p>
<p>from whatever they catch out of these lectures,</p>
<p>even if what they catch is just inspiration</p>
<p>and passion and drive.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this intangible legacy quote unquote</p>
<p>that every one of us has through the people we touch.</p>
<p>One of my friends from undergrad basically told me,</p>
<p>oh, my mom remembers you vividly</p>
<p>from when she came to campus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I didn&rsquo;t even meet her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, no, but she sort of saw you interacting</p>
<p>with people and said, wow,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s exuding this positive energy.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that aspect of sort of just motivating people</p>
<p>with your kindness, with your passion, with your generosity</p>
<p>and with your just selflessness of just give,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter where it goes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to conferences where basically people will,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask them a question and then they&rsquo;ll come back to,</p>
<p>or there was a conference where I asked somebody a question</p>
<p>and they said, oh, in fact, this entire project</p>
<p>was inspired by your question three years ago</p>
<p>at the same conference.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, wow.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, there&rsquo;s also the ripple effect.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re speaking to the direct influence of inspiration</p>
<p>or education, but there&rsquo;s also the follow on things</p>
<p>that happen to that and there&rsquo;s this ripple</p>
<p>that from you just this one individual first drop.</p>
<p>And from every one of us, from everyone,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I love about humanity.</p>
<p>The fact that every one of us shares genes</p>
<p>and genetic variants with very recent ancestors</p>
<p>with everyone else.</p>
<p>So even if I die tomorrow, my genes are still shared</p>
<p>through my cousins and through my uncles</p>
<p>and through my immediate family.</p>
<p>And of course I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have my own children,</p>
<p>but even if you don&rsquo;t, your genes are still permeating</p>
<p>through all of the layers of your family.</p>
<p>So your genes will have the legacy there, yeah.</p>
<p>Every one of us.</p>
<p>Number two, our ideas are constantly intermingling</p>
<p>with each other.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no person living in the planet</p>
<p>a hundred years from now who will not be directly impacted</p>
<p>by every one of the planet living here today</p>
<p>through genetic inheritance and through meme inheritance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool to think that your ideas, Manolis Callas,</p>
<p>would touch every single person on this planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just mine, Joe Smith, who&rsquo;s looking at this</p>
<p>right now, his ideas will also touch everybody.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this interconnectedness of humanity.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m also a professor.</p>
<p>So my day job is legacy.</p>
<p>My day job is training, not just the thousands of people</p>
<p>who watch my videos on the web,</p>
<p>but the people who are actually in my class,</p>
<p>who basically come to MIT to learn from a bunch of us.</p>
<p>The cognitive systems that were shipped to this particular</p>
<p>location in space.</p>
<p>And who will then disperse back</p>
<p>into all of their home countries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes America the beacon of the world.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just export goods.</p>
<p>We export people.</p>
<p>Cognitive systems.</p>
<p>We export people who are born here.</p>
<p>And we also export training that people born elsewhere</p>
<p>will come here to get and will then disseminate,</p>
<p>not just whatever knowledge they got,</p>
<p>but whatever ideals they learned.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s a legacy of the US</p>
<p>that you cannot stop with political isolation.</p>
<p>You cannot stop with economic isolation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that will continue to happen</p>
<p>through all the people we&rsquo;ve touched through our universities.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the students who took my classes,</p>
<p>who are basically now going off and teaching their classes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve trained generations of computational biologists.</p>
<p>No one in genomics who&rsquo;s gone through MIT</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t taken my class.</p>
<p>So basically there&rsquo;s this impact through,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many people in biotechs who are like,</p>
<p>hey, I took your class.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what got me into the field like 15 years ago.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the academic family that I have.</p>
<p>So the students who are actually studying with me,</p>
<p>who are my trainees.</p>
<p>So this sort of mentorship of ancient Greece.</p>
<p>So I basically have an academic family and we are a family.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this such strong connection,</p>
<p>this bond of you&rsquo;re part of the Kelly&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>So I have a biological family at home</p>
<p>and I have an academic family on campus.</p>
<p>And that academic family</p>
<p>has given me great grandchildren already.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve trained people who are now professors at Stanford,</p>
<p>CMU, Harvard, WashU, I mean, everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>And these people have now trained people</p>
<p>who are now having their own faculty jobs.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s basically people who see me</p>
<p>as their academic grandfather.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so beautiful</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have to wait for the 18 years</p>
<p>of cognitive hardware development</p>
<p>to sort of have amazing conversation with people.</p>
<p>These are fully grown humans, fully grown adult</p>
<p>who are cognitively super ready and who are shaped by,</p>
<p>and I see some of these beautiful papers and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I can see the touch of our lab in those papers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so beautiful.</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re like, I spent hours with these people</p>
<p>teaching them not just how to do a paper, but how to think.</p>
<p>And this whole concept of, you know,</p>
<p>the first paper that we write together</p>
<p>is an experience with every one of these students.</p>
<p>So, you know, I always tell them</p>
<p>to write the whole first draft</p>
<p>and they know that I will rewrite every word.</p>
<p>But the act of them writing it</p>
<p>and what I do is these like joint editing sessions</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m like, let&rsquo;s coedit.</p>
<p>And with this coediting, we basically have&hellip;</p>
<p>Creative destruction.</p>
<p>So I share my Zoom screen</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just thinking out loud as I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re learning from that process</p>
<p>as opposed to like come back two days later</p>
<p>and they see a bunch of red on a page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of, well, that&rsquo;s not how you write this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how you think about this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, you know, what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p>Like this morning was having,</p>
<p>yes, this morning between six and 8 a.m.</p>
<p>I had a two hour meeting</p>
<p>going through one of these papers</p>
<p>and then saying, what&rsquo;s the point here?</p>
<p>Why do you even show that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a bunch of points on a graph.</p>
<p>No, what you have to do is extract the meaning,</p>
<p>do the homework for them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this nurturing, this mentorship</p>
<p>that sort of creates now a legacy,</p>
<p>which is infinite because they&rsquo;ve now gone off on the,</p>
<p>you know, and all of that is just humanity.</p>
<p>Then of course there&rsquo;s the papers I write</p>
<p>because yes, my day job is training students,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a research university.</p>
<p>The way that they learn is through the mens and manus,</p>
<p>mind and hand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the practical training of actually doing research.</p>
<p>And that research is a beneficial side effect</p>
<p>of having these awesome papers</p>
<p>that will now tell other people how to think.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this paper we just posted recently on MedArchive</p>
<p>and one of the most generous and eloquent comments about it</p>
<p>was like, wow, this is a masterclass in scientific writing,</p>
<p>in analysis, in biological interpretation, and so forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so fulfilling from a person I&rsquo;ve never met</p>
<p>or heard about.</p>
<p>Can you say the title of the paper, Brian Chen?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the title,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s single cell dissection of schizophrenia reveals.</p>
<p>So the two points that we found</p>
<p>was this whole transcriptional resilience.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some individuals who are schizophrenic,</p>
<p>but they have an additional cell type</p>
<p>or an additional cell state, which we believe is protective.</p>
<p>And that cell state when they have it</p>
<p>will cause other cells to have normal gene expression patterns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And then that cell is connected</p>
<p>with some of the PV interneurons</p>
<p>that are basically sending these inhibitory brainwaves</p>
<p>through the brain.</p>
<p>And basically there&rsquo;s another component of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a set of master regulators that we discovered</p>
<p>who are controlling many of the genes</p>
<p>that are differentially expressed.</p>
<p>And these master regulators are themselves</p>
<p>genetic targets of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>And they are themselves involved</p>
<p>in both synaptic connectivity</p>
<p>and also in early brain development.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this sort of interconnectedness</p>
<p>between synaptic development axis</p>
<p>and also this transcriptional resilience.</p>
<p>So, I mean, we basically made up a title</p>
<p>that combines all these concepts.</p>
<p>You have all these concepts,</p>
<p>all these people working together,</p>
<p>and ultimately these minds condense it down</p>
<p>into a beautifully written little document</p>
<p>that lives on forever. Exactly.</p>
<p>And that document now has its own life.</p>
<p>Our work has 120,000 citations.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not just people who read it.</p>
<p>These are people who used it</p>
<p>to write something based on it.</p>
<p>I mean, that to me is just so fulfilling</p>
<p>to basically say, wow, I&rsquo;ve touched people.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think of my legacy as I live every day.</p>
<p>I just think of the beauty of the present</p>
<p>and the power of interconnectedness.</p>
<p>And just, I feel like a kid in a candy shop</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m just like constantly,</p>
<p>where do I, what package do I open first?</p>
<p>And, you know. You&rsquo;re the lucky one.</p>
<p>A jack of all trades, a master of none.</p>
<p>I think for a Meaning of Life episode,</p>
<p>we would be amiss if we did not have at least a poem or two.</p>
<p>Do you mind if we end in a couple of poems?</p>
<p>Maybe a happy, maybe a sad one.</p>
<p>I would love that.</p>
<p>So thank you for the luxury.</p>
<p>The first one is kind of,</p>
<p>I remember when you were talking with Eric Weinstein</p>
<p>about this comment of Leonard Cohen that says,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really care for music, do you?</p>
<p>In Hallelujah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically kind of like mocking its reader.</p>
<p>So one of my poems is a little like that.</p>
<p>So I had just broken up with my girlfriend</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this other friend who was coming to visit me.</p>
<p>And she said, I will not come unless you write me a poem.</p>
<p>And I was like, writing a poem on demand.</p>
<p>So this poem is called Write Me a Poem.</p>
<p>It goes, write me a poem, she said with a smile.</p>
<p>Make sure it&rsquo;s pretty, romantic and rhymes.</p>
<p>Make sure it&rsquo;s worthy of that bold flame,</p>
<p>that love uniting us beyond a mere game.</p>
<p>And she took off without more words,</p>
<p>rushed for the bus and traveled the world.</p>
<p>A poem, I thought, this is sublime.</p>
<p>What better way for passing the time?</p>
<p>What better way to count up the hours</p>
<p>before she comes back to my lonely tower?</p>
<p>Waiting for joy to fill up my heart,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s write a poem for when we&rsquo;re apart.</p>
<p>How does a poem start, I inquired.</p>
<p>Give me a topic, cook up a style.</p>
<p>Throw in some cute words, oh, here and there.</p>
<p>Throw in some passion, love and despair.</p>
<p>Love, three eggs, one pound of flour,</p>
<p>three cups of water and bake for an hour.</p>
<p>Love is no recipe as I understand.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just cook up a poem on demand.</p>
<p>And as I was twisting all this in my mind,</p>
<p>I looked at the page, by golly, it rhymed.</p>
<p>Three roses, white chocolate, vanilla powder,</p>
<p>some beautiful rhymes and maybe a flower.</p>
<p>No, be romantic, the young girl insisted.</p>
<p>Do this, do that, don&rsquo;t be so silly.</p>
<p>You must believe it straight from your heart.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t feel it, we&rsquo;re better apart.</p>
<p>Oh, my sweet thing, what can I say?</p>
<p>You bring me the sun all night and all day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the stars and the moon and the birds way up high.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re my evening sweet song, my morning blue sky.</p>
<p>You are my muse, your spell has me caught.</p>
<p>You bring me my voice and scatter my thoughts.</p>
<p>To put that loving writing in vain, I can try.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m with you, my wings want to fly.</p>
<p>So I put down the pen and drop my defenses.</p>
<p>Give myself to you and fill up my senses.</p>
<p>The baffled king composing, that was beautiful.</p>
<p>What I love about it is that I did not</p>
<p>bring up a dictionary of rhymes.</p>
<p>I did not sort of work hard.</p>
<p>So basically when I write poems, I just type.</p>
<p>I never go back, I just.</p>
<p>So when my brain gets into that mode,</p>
<p>it actually happens like I wrote it.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, so the rhymes just kind of.</p>
<p>The rhymes just kind of come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an emergent phenomenon.</p>
<p>I just get into that mode and then it comes up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically, you know, as you got it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically saying it&rsquo;s no recipe</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m throwing in the recipes</p>
<p>and as I&rsquo;m writing it, I&rsquo;m like, you know.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very introspective in this whole concept.</p>
<p>So anyway, there&rsquo;s another one many years earlier</p>
<p>that is, you know, darker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically this whole concept of let&rsquo;s be friends.</p>
<p>I was like, ugh, you know.</p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s be friends, just like, you know.</p>
<p>So the last words are shout out,</p>
<p>I love you or send me to hell.</p>
<p>So the title is Burn Me Tonight.</p>
<p>Lie to me, baby.</p>
<p>Lie to me now.</p>
<p>Tell me you love me.</p>
<p>Break me a vow.</p>
<p>Give me a sweet word, a promise, a kiss.</p>
<p>Give me the world, a sweet taste to miss.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let me lay here, inert, ugly, cold,</p>
<p>with nothing sweet felt and nothing harsh told.</p>
<p>Give me some hope, false, foolish, yet kind.</p>
<p>Make me regret, I&rsquo;ll leave you behind.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t pity my soul or torture it right.</p>
<p>Treat it with hatred.</p>
<p>Start up a fight.</p>
<p>For it&rsquo;s from mildness that my soul dies</p>
<p>when you cover your passion in a bland friend&rsquo;s disguise.</p>
<p>Kiss me now, baby.</p>
<p>Show me your passion.</p>
<p>Turn off the lights and rip off your fashion.</p>
<p>Give me my life&rsquo;s joy this one night.</p>
<p>Burn all my matches for one blazing light.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think of tomorrow and let today fade.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try and protect me from love&rsquo;s cutting blade.</p>
<p>Your razor will always rip off my veins.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t spare me the passion to spare me the pains.</p>
<p>Kiss me now, honey, or spit in my face.</p>
<p>Throw me an insult I&rsquo;ll gladly embrace.</p>
<p>Tell me now clearly that you never cared.</p>
<p>Say it now loudly like you never dared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to hear it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to die.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to burn and start a new life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready to face the rough burning truth</p>
<p>rather than waste the rest of my youth.</p>
<p>So tell me, my lover, should I stay or go?</p>
<p>The answer to love is one, yes or no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no I like you, no let&rsquo;s be friends,</p>
<p>shout out I love you, or send me to hell.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end</p>
<p>a discussion of the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Whatever the heck the meaning is,</p>
<p>go all in as that poem says.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Douglas Adams in his book,</p>
<p>Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy.</p>
<p>On the planet Earth, man had always assumed</p>
<p>that he was more intelligent than dolphins</p>
<p>because he had achieved so much.</p>
<p>The wheel, New York, wars, and so on,</p>
<p>whilst all the dolphins had ever done</p>
<p>was muck about in the water having a good time.</p>
<p>But conversely, the dolphins had always believed</p>
<p>that they were far more intelligent than man</p>
<p>for precisely the same reasons.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
