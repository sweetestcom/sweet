<p>former FBI hostage and crisis negotiator</p>
<p>and author of Never Split the Difference,</p>
<p>Negotiating As If Your Life Depended on It.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Shopify for e-commerce,</p>
<p>Indeed for hiring great teams,</p>
<p>and Insight Tracker for biological data.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to work with our team,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always hiring.</p>

<p>And now, on to the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting,</p>
<p>but if you must skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Shopify,</p>
<p>a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere</p>
<p>with a great-looking online store</p>
<p>that brings your ideas to life</p>
<p>and tools to manage day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>And it also taunts me, Lex,</p>
<p>for being a lazy person</p>
<p>because I should have already set up</p>
<p>a little shop for selling merch,</p>
<p>which people have been asking me for.</p>
<p>Just a couple of T-shirts</p>
<p>that allow you to celebrate a thing you&rsquo;re into,</p>
<p>which I love doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m into a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of a large number of podcasts.</p>
<p>I wear their merch.</p>
<p>I wear their shirts, bands.</p>
<p>I have more Metallica shirts than they can count.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just wonderful to share</p>
<p>the thing that brings you joy</p>
<p>with the rest of the world,</p>
<p>and then it starts a conversation,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>you love Metallica, too?</p>
<p>I love Metallica.</p>
<p>And then the rest of the conversation</p>
<p>somehow flourishes with even a greater vigor</p>
<p>than it otherwise might have.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s a catalyst for the initial spark</p>
<p>of a conversation</p>
<p>that shares a kind of thread.</p>
<p>You start at the thread,</p>
<p>and the thread creates a garden.</p>

<p>Please, I need your help.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Indeed,</p>
<p>a hiring website.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used them many times</p>
<p>for the many hiring efforts I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>for the teams I&rsquo;ve led in the past.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently actually had to write</p>
<p>a few recommendation letters</p>
<p>for people who I&rsquo;ve worked with in the past,</p>
<p>and I really enjoy doing that</p>
<p>because it reminds me how awesome the people are.</p>
<p>It kind of takes me back to those times.</p>
<p>And those months, those years</p>
<p>that you get to spend together</p>
<p>on a difficult problem,</p>
<p>and you get to solve it together,</p>
<p>the camaraderie of that,</p>
<p>the struggles of that,</p>
<p>the passions of that,</p>
<p>the ups and downs</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re really hopeful one day,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s all these problems,</p>
<p>and you think the ideas you were doing</p>
<p>are totally stupid,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not gonna work out,</p>
<p>and you kind of like can&rsquo;t quite figure out</p>
<p>the puzzle of it,</p>
<p>and you might have to start over completely,</p>
<p>you have to backtrack,</p>
<p>all of that,</p>
<p>the full mess of that,</p>
<p>and you get to share in that together.</p>
<p>And ultimately,</p>
<p>at least for the things I&rsquo;ve worked on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a mission,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a dream</p>
<p>to understand something deeply,</p>
<p>or to help a large number of people.</p>
<p>And that just gives a whole</p>
<p>journey of struggle together meaning.</p>
<p>I mention that because</p>
<p>the process of building up a team,</p>
<p>the process of hiring a team,</p>
<p>is so important</p>
<p>because a great team is so important,</p>
<p>not just the success of the company,</p>
<p>or a research group,</p>
<p>or anything you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>relationships.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also just a source of happiness.</p>
<p>So use the best tools for the job</p>
<p>of building the team,</p>
<p>and Indeed is an incredible tool.</p>

<p>when you&rsquo;re growing your own business,</p>

<p>This show is also brought to you by</p>
<p>Insight Tracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>An interesting small scale example of that,</p>
<p>perhaps you can hear it from my nose at the moment,</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;ve started getting allergies</p>
<p>as nature wakes up</p>
<p>from its winter slumber.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s already a year ago,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit over than that,</p>
<p>I got a test for different things I&rsquo;m allergic to,</p>
<p>and they put different things on your skin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this grid,</p>
<p>and you get to see what are the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re allergic to based on</p>
<p>that little grid cell of the skin</p>
<p>having an allergic reaction.</p>
<p>And I was not allergic to most things,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a few that stood out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that interesting little data point, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably true that over time that changes.</p>
<p>Maybe across a period of months and years</p>
<p>based on the medication you take,</p>
<p>based on environmental conditions,</p>
<p>based on your diet, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;d be nice to do that same test</p>
<p>over and over and over</p>
<p>to get a sense of how my allergic reaction</p>
<p>to the world around me changes, okay?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million things like this,</p>
<p>and the core to you making a good effective decision</p>
<p>on what you should do with your life,</p>
<p>lifestyle, health, diet, whatever,</p>
<p>is to ground that in data.</p>
<p>So the core to the allergy thing is data.</p>
<p>The core to everything InsideTracker does is data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about personalized data,</p>
<p>driven advice for how to make your life better.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Chris Voss.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>What is it like negotiating for a hostage</p>
<p>with a kidnapper?</p>
<p>What is the toughest part of that process?</p>
<p>The toughest part is if it looks bad from the beginning,</p>
<p>and you gotta engage in a process anyway.</p>
<p>What are the factors that make it bad?</p>
<p>What that makes you nervous,</p>
<p>that if you were to observe a situation</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s general negotiation</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a hostage negotiation,</p>
<p>what makes you think that this is going to be difficult?</p>
<p>If they wanna make it look like they&rsquo;re negotiating,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Like in the 2004 timeframe,</p>
<p>al-Qaeda in Iraq was executing people on camera</p>
<p>for the publicity,</p>
<p>and they wanted to make it look like they were negotiating.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;d come on and they&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t get all the women out of,</p>
<p>Iraqi women out of the jails in Iraq in 72 hours,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna kill a hostage.</p>
<p>That was one of the demands in one of the cases</p>
<p>in that timeframe.</p>
<p>Now, first of all, even if we&rsquo;d have been willing,</p>
<p>the U.S. government, the coalition</p>
<p>would have been willing to do that,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to happen in 72 hours.</p>
<p>So is it an impossible ask from the beginning?</p>
<p>And so then that looks really bad.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re trying to make it look</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re talking reasonably, but they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So your hostage is in bad shape there.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;ve made a demand that you just,</p>
<p>even if you wanted to do, you couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>So then what makes that very difficult is,</p>
<p>in kidnappings especially,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re working with family members, you&rsquo;re coaching people.</p>
<p>Bad guys are in touch with family members,</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re not directly in touch with family members,</p>
<p>the other thing that al-Qaeda was doing at that time</p>
<p>was they didn&rsquo;t give us a way to talk to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making statements in the media,</p>
<p>but then not leaving their phone number, if you will.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one more thing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re intentionally blocking you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking you to do something you can&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not giving you a way to talk to them.</p>
<p>So you gotta get with the family</p>
<p>and discuss with the family how you&rsquo;re gonna approach things.</p>
<p>Now the family definitely wants to know,</p>
<p>is this gonna help?</p>
<p>So a bunch of cases like that in that timeframe.</p>
<p>And you gotta be honest with them, it&rsquo;s a long shot.</p>
<p>Our chances here are slim and none.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s slim and none, I&rsquo;ll take slim,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still very, very slim.</p>
<p>And there were a number of people that were killed</p>
<p>in that timeframe before the tide finally got turned</p>
<p>and it was hard dealing with families at the time.</p>
<p>Can you negotiate in public</p>
<p>versus like a direct channel in private?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Bad guys pick the media.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making statements in the media.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s a big clue.</p>
<p>Their channel of choice tells you an awful lot.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re choosing the media,</p>
<p>then that means there&rsquo;s people they&rsquo;re trying to appeal to.</p>
<p>That means in their view,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s such a thing as good media.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s good media, there&rsquo;s bad media.</p>
<p>How do you make it bad?</p>
<p>And we made it bad for them.</p>
<p>It just, unfortunately,</p>
<p>it had to go through a number of iterations</p>
<p>before they got the message and quit.</p>
<p>In that negotiation,</p>
<p>do you think about the value of human life?</p>
<p>Is there a dollar figure?</p>
<p>How do you enumerate, not enumerate,</p>
<p>quantify the value of human life?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s like beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>So that was the first lesson on any hostage negotiation,</p>
<p>really any negotiation.</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is to you,</p>
<p>matters what it is to the other side.</p>
<p>One of the things, especially in your conversation</p>
<p>I listened to with Andrew.</p>
<p>By the way, you guys,</p>
<p>another thing I really liked about that conversation,</p>
<p>first of all, I think the world of him.</p>
<p>Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>Yeah, Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>And you released it on my birthday.</p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p>It was a nice birthday present to me.</p>
<p>I tried to title it perfectly just for you, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, nice job, thank you.</p>
<p>But empathy is in the eye of the beholder</p>
<p>in every negotiation,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s over a car, a house,</p>
<p>collaboration in your company with the bad guys.</p>
<p>How does the other side see it?</p>
<p>Now, the nice thing about kidnapping for ransom,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s an actual ransom demand,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an actual demand,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a mercenary&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna take what they could get.</p>
<p>And they tend to be really good</p>
<p>at figuring out how much money somebody has.</p>
<p>So, and again, I&rsquo;ll keep drawing business analogies.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking for a job with an employer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a market price of the job,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s what the employer can pay you.</p>
<p>Now, maybe the market price of the job market&rsquo;s 150 grand.</p>
<p>Employer can pay you 120, but it&rsquo;s a great job.</p>
<p>We were talking about Elon a minute ago.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;d work minimum wage to follow him around.</p>
<p>That would be worth it.</p>
<p>What are the value other than the dollars?</p>
<p>And how hard is it to get the dollars?</p>
<p>And how quickly can you get to them?</p>
<p>These are all things that the bad guys are good,</p>
<p>in kidnapping, are good at figuring out.</p>
<p>So, the value of human life to them</p>
<p>is gonna be what can they get.</p>
<p>A crazy thing in the kidnap business.</p>
<p>We used to get asked by FBI leadership,</p>
<p>when is this gonna be over?</p>
<p>And the answer would be when the bad guys</p>
<p>feel like they&rsquo;ve gotten everything they can.</p>
<p>Now, dissecting that statement,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about when they feel</p>
<p>like they got everything they can.</p>
<p>So, the key to kidnapping negotiations are the feelings.</p>
<p>And the bad guys, we&rsquo;re talking about feelings.</p>
<p>Kidnappers&rsquo; feelings.</p>
<p>Which drives everything.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what human endeavor it is.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not reason, it&rsquo;s emotion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as reason.</p>
<p>I should say, for a little bit of context,</p>
<p>I just talked yesterday with a guy named Sam Harris.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know Sam.</p>
<p>But Sam, and because I was preparing</p>
<p>for a conversation with you,</p>
<p>I talked to him about empathy versus reason.</p>
<p>And he lands heavily on reason.</p>
<p>Empathy is somewhere between useless and erroneous</p>
<p>and leads you astray and is not effective.</p>
<p>That reason is the only way forward.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s draw some fine lines there.</p>
<p>And the two fine lines I would draw is,</p>
<p>first, what is your definition of empathy?</p>
<p>And then secondly, how do people actually</p>
<p>make up their minds?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna flip it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go with how people make up their minds.</p>
<p>You make up your mind based on what you care about.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>That makes reason emotion-based.</p>
<p>What do you care about?</p>
<p>You start with what you care about.</p>
<p>You see some guy swimming out off the coast of the ocean</p>
<p>and you see a shark coming up behind him.</p>
<p>Who are you cheering for?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s Adolf Hitler out there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re cheering for the shark.</p>
<p>You might actually feel bad for the shark</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna taste bad.</p>
<p>Who do you care about?</p>
<p>You mean the human will taste bad?</p>
<p>Yeah, he eats Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna leave a bad taste in your mouth,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re a shark.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re making up your mind on every circumstance</p>
<p>is based on what you care about.</p>
<p>So then what does that do to reason?</p>
<p>Your reason is based on what you care about</p>
<p>from the beginning.</p>
<p>Now then, empathy.</p>
<p>If you define it as sympathy,</p>
<p>which it was never meant to be sympathy, ever.</p>
<p>Etymology, I think is the word.</p>
<p>I keep getting etymology and entomology mixed up.</p>
<p>Etymology being, right, where words came from,</p>
<p>the origin, entomology being bugs.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So I like etymology.</p>
<p>Where did something come from?</p>
<p>I also like entomology.</p>
<p>Anyway, etymology.</p>
<p>My understanding from my research,</p>
<p>the original definition of empathy</p>
<p>was an interpretation of a German word</p>
<p>where people were trying to figure out</p>
<p>what the artist was trying to convey.</p>
<p>It was about assessing art.</p>
<p>And so it was always about understanding</p>
<p>where somebody was coming from,</p>
<p>but not sharing, necessarily, that same thing.</p>
<p>So then when I was with DFBI</p>
<p>and I first started collaborating with Harvard,</p>
<p>Bob Mnookin wrote a book, Beyond Winning,</p>
<p>second chapter is The Tension</p>
<p>Between Empathy and Assertiveness.</p>
<p>Still the best chapter on empathy I&rsquo;ve ever read anywhere.</p>
<p>And Bob writes in his book,</p>
<p>Bob was the head of the program on negotiation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also agreed to be interviewed</p>
<p>for a documentary about me and my company</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t been released yet,</p>
<p>but it should be released sometime this year.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the name of the documentary?</p>
<p>Tactical Empathy.</p>
<p>Good name.</p>
<p>So Bob&rsquo;s definition of empathy said</p>
<p>not agreeing or even liking the other side.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even gotta like them, don&rsquo;t gotta agree with them.</p>
<p>Just straight understanding where they&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>and articulating it,</p>
<p>which requires no agreement whatsoever.</p>
<p>That becomes a very powerful tool,</p>
<p>like ridiculously powerful,</p>
<p>and if sympathy or compassion or agreement are not included,</p>
<p>you can be empathic with anybody.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this</p>
<p>when I was getting ready to sit down and talk to you,</p>
<p>because you use the word empathy a lot.</p>
<p>Putin.</p>
<p>I can be empathic with Putin, easy, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with where he&rsquo;s coming from.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with his methodology.</p>
<p>Early on, the Ukraine-Russian War,</p>
<p>I saw an article that was very dismissive of Russia</p>
<p>that said, Russia&rsquo;s basically Europe&rsquo;s gas station.</p>
<p>And I thought, all right.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in charge and the way you feed your people</p>
<p>is via an industry that the entire world is trying to quit,</p>
<p>the whole world is trying to get out of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s how you feed your people,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t come up with an answer to that,</p>
<p>the people that you&rsquo;ve taken responsibility for</p>
<p>are gonna die alone in the cold and the dark.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna freeze and they&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>All right, so that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I agree</p>
<p>with where he&rsquo;s coming from or any of his means.</p>
<p>But how does this guy see things in his distorted world?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna get through to somebody like that</p>
<p>in a conversation unless you can demonstrate to them</p>
<p>you understand where they&rsquo;re coming from,</p>
<p>whether or not you agree.</p>
<p>Early 90s, last century, I&rsquo;m a last century guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an old dude.</p>
<p>Refer to myself as a last century guy.</p>
<p>Also a deeply flawed human.</p>
<p>So terrorist case, New York City,</p>
<p>civilian court, terrorism does not have to be tried</p>
<p>in military tribunals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very bad idea.</p>
<p>It was always bad.</p>
<p>The FBI was always against it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready.</p>
<p>We have Muslims testifying in open court</p>
<p>against a legitimate Muslim cleric.</p>
<p>The guy that was on trial had the credentials</p>
<p>as a legitimate Muslim cleric.</p>
<p>The people that were testifying against him</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think he should be advocating</p>
<p>for the murder of innocent people.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d sit down with them, Arab Muslims, Egyptians, mostly.</p>
<p>And I would say to them,</p>
<p>you believe that there&rsquo;s been a succession</p>
<p>of American governments for the last 200 years</p>
<p>that are anti-Islamic?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d shake their head and go, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;d be the start of the conversation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s empathy.</p>
<p>You believe this to be the case.</p>
<p>I never said I agreed.</p>
<p>I never said I disagreed.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d showed them that I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of their beliefs.</p>
<p>I was so unafraid of them</p>
<p>that I was willing to just state them</p>
<p>and not disagree or contradict.</p>
<p>Because I would say that and then I&rsquo;d shut up</p>
<p>and let them react.</p>
<p>And I never had to say, here&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>I never gave my point of view.</p>
<p>Every single one of them that testified, that&rsquo;s empathy.</p>
<p>Not agreeing with where the other side is coming from.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how Sam would define it,</p>
<p>but common vernacular is it&rsquo;s sympathy and it&rsquo;s compassion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when it becomes useless.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a gray area, maybe you can comment on it,</p>
<p>is sometimes a drop of compassion</p>
<p>helps make that empathy more effective in the conversation.</p>
<p>So you just saying you believe X</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t quite form a strong of a bond with the other person.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re imagining it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m imagining it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining you need to show</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re on the same side.</p>
<p>That you need to signal a little bit</p>
<p>about your actual beliefs, at least in that moment.</p>
<p>Even if that signaling is not as deep as it sounds.</p>
<p>But at first, basically patting the person on the back</p>
<p>and saying, we&rsquo;re on the same side, brother.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what most people,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re really learning the concept,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the basic human reaction.</p>
<p>And in application,</p>
<p>especially in highly adversarial situations,</p>
<p>like I need a regular guy, Muslim,</p>
<p>but how&rsquo;s that guy gonna say, buy it,</p>
<p>if I like, you know, dude, I&rsquo;m on your side.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>I feel you.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>People get conned by that so much.</p>
<p>Like if we&rsquo;re on opposite sides of the table</p>
<p>and I try to act like I&rsquo;m not on the opposite side</p>
<p>of the table, that makes me disingenuous.</p>
<p>So I would rather be honest.</p>
<p>My, you know, my currency&rsquo;s integrity.</p>
<p>And at some point in time, if you go like,</p>
<p>you know where I&rsquo;m coming from?</p>
<p>My answer&rsquo;s gonna be like, look,</p>
<p>I can agree on maybe where we&rsquo;re going,</p>
<p>but if we&rsquo;re talking about, you know,</p>
<p>am I on your side now?</p>
<p>As a human being, I wanna see you survive and thrive,</p>
<p>not at my expense.</p>
<p>I think the world is full of opportunity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p>
<p>I got more than enough reason for saying that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough here for both of us.</p>
<p>So I got no problem with you getting yours.</p>
<p>You know, just don&rsquo;t take it out of my hand.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna be honest about it,</p>
<p>about both of those things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in you taking it out of my hide.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s plenty here for both of us.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t need to be on your side,</p>
<p>except in a human sense.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, do I have to side with you over the war?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Or how we&rsquo;re distributing the stock</p>
<p>or how much you get paid or how much you make off this car.</p>
<p>I think people, my experience as a layman</p>
<p>is that empathy&rsquo;s not got a downside,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t need me to act like I&rsquo;m on your side</p>
<p>for us to make a great deal.</p>
<p>Great deal.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll talk about two things,</p>
<p>a great deal and a great conversation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re often going to be the same thing,</p>
<p>but at times, they&rsquo;re going to be different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you mentioned Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>There is some Zoom level at which you do wanna say</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on the same side.</p>
<p>You said the human level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to say, kind of Zoom out</p>
<p>and say that we&rsquo;re all in this together,</p>
<p>not we Slavic people, we Europeans, but we human beings.</p>
<p>On the same planet.</p>
<p>Same planet.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Several years ago, and his name has evidently been mud now,</p>
<p>but he was very nice to me,</p>
<p>lawyer here in town named Tom Girardi,</p>
<p>and no shortage of bad reporting on him now.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea if any of it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I do know that in my interaction with him,</p>
<p>he was always a gentleman to me and was very generous.</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;d get into conversations with people,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d always say, let&rsquo;s look at 10 years from now</p>
<p>where we could both be in a phenomenal place together.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s work our way back from there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then I saw him do it in simulations.</p>
<p>I was teaching at USC, we were at a function together,</p>
<p>and a gentleman at the time told me who he was</p>
<p>and he was really influential.</p>
<p>So I walked up to the guy, Colt, and I said,</p>
<p>hey, how about coming and talking to my class at USC?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know me other than the fact</p>
<p>that we had a mutual acquaintance,</p>
<p>and he graciously consented to come in.</p>
<p>And he said, what do you want me to talk about?</p>
<p>I said, look, dude, just from your success here,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you talk about.</p>
<p>Either I&rsquo;m gonna agree or I&rsquo;m gonna disagree</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna learn from it.</p>
<p>My students are gonna learn from it.</p>
<p>So students wanna role play with him.</p>
<p>They dispute, let&rsquo;s do a negotiation.</p>
<p>Every single time, he&rsquo;d go to pick a point in the future</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re both happy 10 years, 20 years from now,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s work our way back.</p>
<p>Now, hostage negotiator, same thing.</p>
<p>I call into a bank, bad guy picks up on the phone,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna say, I want you to live.</p>
<p>I wanna see you survive this.</p>
<p>Whatever else goes with that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s pick a point in the future</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re both good with, and then we work our way back.</p>
<p>And people make also, we were talking before</p>
<p>about emotion and what you care about.</p>
<p>People make their decisions</p>
<p>based on their vision of the future, without question.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a Hindu temple in the United States</p>
<p>has been or being assembled same way</p>
<p>that the Hindu temples were in India 1,000 years ago,</p>
<p>by hand, volunteers, by hand.</p>
<p>These people are knocking themselves on</p>
<p>for a place in paradise, a vision of the future.</p>
<p>What you will go through today</p>
<p>if the future portends what you want,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll go through incredible things today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a vision of the future.</p>
<p>So you have to try to paint a vision of the future</p>
<p>that the person you&rsquo;re negotiating with will like.</p>
<p>Just tough to do.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out what their vision of the future is,</p>
<p>and then remove yourself as a threat.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>If we can collaborate together at all,</p>
<p>if you think that I could do anything at all</p>
<p>to help you to that point,</p>
<p>and integrity&rsquo;s my currency,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna lie to you,</p>
<p>which gets back before,</p>
<p>did I lie to you about whether or not I&rsquo;m on your side?</p>
<p>You know, right now, at the moment,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on opposite sides of the fence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not gonna stop us from being together in the future.</p>
<p>Inside, you&rsquo;re gonna say,</p>
<p>well, you didn&rsquo;t lie to me about today.</p>
<p>Maybe you won&rsquo;t lie to me about tomorrow.</p>
<p>So going back to world leaders, for example,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Vladimir Zelensky</p>
<p>or Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think it closes off their mind</p>
<p>to show that you have a different opinion?</p>
<p>Depending upon when you showed it.</p>
<p>Are you arguing from the beginning,</p>
<p>or are you displaying understanding from the beginning?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it stops you from being adversarial.</p>
<p>There was a thing about Mnuchin&rsquo;s chapter in his book,</p>
<p>The Tension Between Empathy and Assertiveness.</p>
<p>I remember reading that name of the chapter,</p>
<p>thinking like, eh, you know.</p>
<p>In my business, there is no tension.</p>
<p>And then I got into it, and I read,</p>
<p>I thought, this is a red herring.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s drawing people in,</p>
<p>because his entire chapter is that empathy</p>
<p>puts you in a position to assert,</p>
<p>and that there is no tension.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sequencing issue.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, again, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it was written for lawyers.</p>
<p>Yeah, sequencing issue.</p>
<p>The timing is everything.</p>
<p>So you emphasize the importance of,</p>
<p>in terms of sequencing and priority of listening,</p>
<p>of truly listening to the other person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, what&rsquo;d you say?</p>
<p>That was a bad joke, sorry.</p>
<p>I forgot.</p>
<p>Your timing is just perfect.</p>
<p>How do you listen?</p>
<p>How do you truly listen to another human being?</p>
<p>How do you notice them?</p>
<p>How do you really hear them?</p>
<p>I always hated the term active listening.</p>
<p>If anything, it&rsquo;s proactive.</p>
<p>And as soon as you start to try to anticipate</p>
<p>where somebody&rsquo;s going, you&rsquo;re dialed in more.</p>
<p>Because along the way,</p>
<p>either you&rsquo;re congratulating yourself for being right,</p>
<p>or when suddenly they say something that surprises you,</p>
<p>you really notice it.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s not what I expected.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dialed in, you&rsquo;re listening.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s proactive.</p>
<p>And then one of the reasons,</p>
<p>we named the book Tactical Empathy.</p>
<p>Named the book, never split the difference,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re talking about tactical empathy.</p>
<p>Calibrated emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it calibrated by?</p>
<p>First, it was experienced as hostage negotiators,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve come to find out</p>
<p>that our experience as hostage negotiators</p>
<p>is backed up by neuroscience.</p>
<p>Another reason why I listen</p>
<p>to Andrew Huberman&rsquo;s podcast all the time.</p>
<p>Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy on the neuroscience.</p>
<p>And so then emotional intelligence</p>
<p>calibrated by what we know about neuroscience.</p>
<p>What do we know about neuroscience?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll talk about it from a layman&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>and to even say we&rsquo;s an arrogant thing,</p>
<p>human beings.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do the research.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scooping up as much of it as I can as a layman.</p>
<p>The brain&rsquo;s largely negative.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s ample evidence.</p>
<p>People will argue with you as to what the wiring is</p>
<p>and what does what, and the limbic system,</p>
<p>and all of that, but the brain is basically 75% negative.</p>
<p>As a layman, I make that contention, number one.</p>
<p>Number two, the best way to deactivate negativity</p>
<p>is by calling it out, and I could say,</p>
<p>look, I don&rsquo;t want you to be offended</p>
<p>by what I&rsquo;m getting ready to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a denial.</p>
<p>Your guard is up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting ready to get mad.</p>
<p>If I say, what I&rsquo;m getting ready to say</p>
<p>is probably gonna offend you.</p>
<p>Now you relax a little bit, and you go,</p>
<p>all right, what is it?</p>
<p>And then I say it, whatever it is,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be like, oh, that wasn&rsquo;t that bad,</p>
<p>because we knew from hostage negotiation</p>
<p>by calling out the negativity, deactivate it,</p>
<p>and then a number of neuroscience experiments</p>
<p>have been done right and left</p>
<p>by calling out negativity, deactivating the negativity.</p>
<p>So calling out ahead of time,</p>
<p>so like acknowledging that this is,</p>
<p>that this is, ahead of time, that this is going to hurt.</p>
<p>The experiments that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>have been when the negativity was inflicted,</p>
<p>and then having a person that it was being inflicted upon</p>
<p>simply identify it.</p>
<p>Just identify.</p>
<p>Yeah, what are you feeling?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m angry, and the anger goes away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough, because I&rsquo;ve had a few,</p>
<p>and again, we&rsquo;re dancing between things,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve had a few conversations</p>
<p>where anger arose in the guests I spoke with.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure identifying it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like leaning into it and going into the depths,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to the depths of some emotional,</p>
<p>psychological thing they&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not sure I want to explore that iceberg</p>
<p>with the little ship we got.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, you have to decide.</p>
<p>Do you want to avoid it,</p>
<p>or do you want to lean into it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the elephant in the room.</p>
<p>It is an elephant in the room.</p>
<p>It is an elephant, especially when,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the big difference</p>
<p>between conversations and negotiations.</p>
<p>Negotiation, ultimately,</p>
<p>is looking for closure and resolution.</p>
<p>I think general conversations like this is more exploring.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not necessarily a goal.</p>
<p>Like if you were to put,</p>
<p>like if I had to put a goal for this conversation,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no real goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s curiously exploring ideas.</p>
<p>So that gives you freedom to not call out the elephant.</p>
<p>For time, you could be like,</p>
<p>all right, let&rsquo;s go to the next room, get a snack,</p>
<p>and come back to the elephant.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right, so I&rsquo;d make a tiny adjustment</p>
<p>on the negotiation definition.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Because you said, I think, seeking closure.</p>
<p>You used two words, and closure was one of them.</p>
<p>Goals, maybe another.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, what is negotiation?</p>
<p>Well, I would say seeking collaboration.</p>
<p>Because closure kind of puts a little bit</p>
<p>of a finality to it, and a real problem,</p>
<p>and any negotiation&rsquo;s always implementation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we say yes, I say, yes is nothing without how.</p>
<p>And yes, at its very best,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only a temporary aspiration, it&rsquo;s aspirational.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually counterfeit.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re looking for, huh?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>Yes is usually counterfeit, it&rsquo;s aspirational.</p>
<p>Without the how.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a good line.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on it.</p>
<p>I was practicing.</p>
<p>I was in front of the mirror before I came in.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>I was in front of the mirror before I came in today.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing pretty good.</p>
<p>Okay, you got a bright future ahead of you.</p>
<p>You should write a book or something, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Your book is excellent, by the way.</p>
<p>Thanks, appreciate that.</p>
<p>What am I doing here, anyway?</p>
<p>This, on Earth, in general.</p>
<p>On you, with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re collaborating.</p>
<p>Why me, though?</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you wanna talk to me?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard you speak in a few places.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating human.</p>
<p>I think on Clubhouse and different places.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I listen to some YouTube stuff,</p>
<p>and this is just, you meet people that are interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I love doing with this podcast,</p>
<p>is just exploring the mind of an interesting person.</p>
<p>You notice people.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a homeless person outside of 7-Eleven.</p>
<p>I notice, who are you?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at the resumes and the credentials</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just being able to notice a person.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve been leafing through the different choices</p>
<p>of the podcast, the young lady that OnlyFans</p>
<p>and the sex workers, that&rsquo;s a fascinating human being.</p>
<p>I wanna know what makes that person tech at 1,000%.</p>
<p>The fascinating thing about her</p>
<p>is her worldview is almost entirely different than mine,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s always interesting to talk to a person</p>
<p>who just is happy, flourishing, but sees the world</p>
<p>and the set of values she has is completely different,</p>
<p>and is also not argumentative,</p>
<p>is accepting of other worldviews.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to explore that.</p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding.</p>
<p>I would agree.</p>
<p>And then, yeah, thought-provoking,</p>
<p>because I consider myself,</p>
<p>the word I was looking for before was abundant.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an abundant world, so I&rsquo;m pretty optimistic.</p>
<p>I consider myself, I don&rsquo;t know happy exactly describes it,</p>
<p>but yeah, so then if I&rsquo;m happy, optimistic, abundant,</p>
<p>I got a worldview, and then you run into somebody</p>
<p>that has a vastly different worldview,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re happy, and they think it&rsquo;s abundant, too.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, what is going on in your head,</p>
<p>or mine, or what am I missing?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And the pie grows, which is useful for kinda negotiation</p>
<p>when you paint a picture of a future,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re optimistic about that future.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kinda feeling like we&rsquo;re both gonna win here.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>We live in a world where both people can win.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in point of fact, that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>although a lot of people want us to think otherwise,</p>
<p>mostly because of the negativity</p>
<p>that I was talking about before.</p>
<p>So the brain is generally cynical.</p>
<p>Yeah, my description of it is</p>
<p>the pessimistic caveman survived,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re descendants of the pessimists.</p>
<p>The optimistic guy got eaten by a saber-toothed tiger.</p>
<p>Yeah, but on the flip side,</p>
<p>the optimists seem to be the ones</p>
<p>that actually build stuff these days.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the switch.</p>
<p>So at what point in time do we catch on?</p>
<p>Because the difference between survival and success mindset,</p>
<p>the success mindset is highly optimistic.</p>
<p>So where do we switch, or how do we stay switched</p>
<p>from survival to success?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the challenge.</p>
<p>Yeah, somewhere we stopped being eaten by saber-toothed tigers</p>
<p>and started building bridges and buildings</p>
<p>and computers and companies.</p>
<p>We started to experience,</p>
<p>we got enough data back to collaborate,</p>
<p>and we stopped listening to our amygdala</p>
<p>and we started listening to our gut.</p>
<p>Let me just return briefly to terrorists.</p>
<p>What do you think about the policy</p>
<p>of not negotiating with terrorists?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not the policy, first of all.</p>
<p>Now, everybody thinks that&rsquo;s the policy.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been the policy since 2002</p>
<p>when Bush 43 signed a National Security</p>
<p>Presidential Directive, NSPD, at the time it was NSPD 12,</p>
<p>which basically said, we won&rsquo;t make concessions.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean we won&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in Colombia at the same time</p>
<p>and I have been intimately involved</p>
<p>with the signing of him signing that document.</p>
<p>I knew exactly what it said</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t inherit it from somebody else.</p>
<p>He signed it and I&rsquo;m in Colombia</p>
<p>and the number two in the embassy says,</p>
<p>last night on TV, the President of the United States said,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t negotiate with terrorists.</p>
<p>Are you calling a President of the United States a liar?</p>
<p>And I remember thinking like, all right,</p>
<p>so he probably said that</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not on the document that he signed.</p>
<p>So I said, look, I&rsquo;m familiar with what he&rsquo;s signed</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not what it says.</p>
<p>Well, and so the argument,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s always been the soundbite that everybody likes.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t negotiate with terrorists.</p>
<p>Depends upon your definition of negotiation.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just communication,</p>
<p>we negotiate with them all the time, number one.</p>
<p>And number two, like every President</p>
<p>has made some boneheaded deal with the bad guys.</p>
<p>Like Obama released five high-level Taliban leaders</p>
<p>from Guantanamo in exchange for an AWOL soldier</p>
<p>that we immediately threw in jail.</p>
<p>And I thought that was a horrible deal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s putting terrorists back on the battlefield.</p>
<p>And then Trump turned around and topped it</p>
<p>by putting 5,000 terrorists back on the battlefield.</p>
<p>So we haven&rsquo;t had a President that has stuck to that</p>
<p>on either side of the aisle</p>
<p>since people started throwing that out as a soundbite.</p>
<p>What do you think of that negotiation?</p>
<p>Forget terrorists, but the global negotiation,</p>
<p>like with Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>the recent negotiation over prisoners,</p>
<p>the exchange, the Brady and Geithner.</p>
<p>Is there a way to do that negotiation successfully?</p>
<p>First of all, I agree with the idea</p>
<p>that she was wrongfully detained</p>
<p>and that she didn&rsquo;t deserve to be in jail</p>
<p>and that there should be no second-class citizens ever.</p>
<p>And whether you&rsquo;re a WNBA player</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just some bonehead</p>
<p>that walked into the wrong situation,</p>
<p>your government should not abandon you ever, ever.</p>
<p>Now, what they do in the meantime,</p>
<p>there should have been a negotiation.</p>
<p>They were desperate to make a deal at a bad time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d been offered far better deals</p>
<p>than prisoner swaps earlier and turned them down.</p>
<p>And then he gets turned up.</p>
<p>And thank God for Brittany Griner</p>
<p>that the public got enough attention.</p>
<p>They kept pressure on the administration.</p>
<p>They made a deal.</p>
<p>Now, governments wanna make those kind of deals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine as long as it,</p>
<p>because that was basically a political negotiation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting 5,000 Taliban back on a battlefield.</p>
<p>That ain&rsquo;t negotiating with another government.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting five of them back on a battlefield.</p>
<p>That ain&rsquo;t negotiating with another government.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s directly contradicting this thing that you claimed.</p>
<p>And those were all bad deals.</p>
<p>Now, was the Brittany Griner thing a bad deal?</p>
<p>I think it was great for her.</p>
<p>If I was in the middle of it, it would have been better.</p>
<p>And she still would have come home.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some technical aspects of that negotiation.</p>
<p>What do you think is the value, just to linger on it,</p>
<p>of meeting in person for the negotiation?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great idea.</p>
<p>Can I just follow that tangent along?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a war in Ukraine now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been going on over a year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, for me personally, given my life stories,</p>
<p>is a deeply personal one.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m returning back to that area of the world.</p>
<p>I was there.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelensky said he doesn&rsquo;t want to talk</p>
<p>to Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Do you think they could get in a room together</p>
<p>and say you were there in a room with Putin and Zelensky</p>
<p>and Biden is sitting in the back drinking a cocktail,</p>
<p>or maybe he is at the table participating?</p>
<p>How is it possible through negotiation,</p>
<p>through the art of conversation,</p>
<p>to find peace in this very tense geopolitical conflict?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s eminently possible.</p>
<p>I think getting people together in person</p>
<p>has always been a good idea.</p>
<p>Now, how many times, who&rsquo;s getting them together,</p>
<p>under what circumstances,</p>
<p>and how many times are you getting them together?</p>
<p>The documentary, The Human Factor,</p>
<p>about the Mideast peace negotiations,</p>
<p>mostly through the 90s,</p>
<p>mostly into the Clinton administration,</p>
<p>got kicked off under Bush 41,</p>
<p>and then the documentary continues through Trump,</p>
<p>but just touching, basically, on it.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re getting Arafat</p>
<p>and the different Israeli prime ministers</p>
<p>together in person.</p>
<p>And these guys do not want to talk to each other,</p>
<p>and depending upon the prime minister,</p>
<p>the mere thought of being on the same planet with Arafat</p>
<p>was offensive.</p>
<p>And they started getting these guys together</p>
<p>in person regularly,</p>
<p>and they started seeing each other as human beings,</p>
<p>and they started realizing</p>
<p>that there was enough room on the planet for them,</p>
<p>and that people dying was stupid.</p>
<p>And they would slowly work things out</p>
<p>by getting these guys together in person.</p>
<p>So how long does it take?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s hosting it?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>But the skill of achieving that thing</p>
<p>that you talk about a lot, which is empathy,</p>
<p>and I would say, in that case,</p>
<p>not just empathy, but empathy plus a bit,</p>
<p>you might disagree with this,</p>
<p>but a drop of compassion in there?</p>
<p>I think compassion is helpful,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not essential.</p>
<p>Like, if you just know where I&rsquo;m coming from,</p>
<p>like, the feeling of being understood.</p>
<p>Yeah, heard and understood, that&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>Is, yeah, and again,</p>
<p>I know I picked the vast majority of this up</p>
<p>on Andrew&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>but I picked it up in other places,</p>
<p>because early on,</p>
<p>when we were putting a book together with Tal Roz,</p>
<p>the writer, my son, uncredited co-author,</p>
<p>so the book&rsquo;s really a collaboration between me,</p>
<p>my son, Brandon, and Tal Roz,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re driving for that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You know, when somebody feels like what you&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>is completely their position, they say that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Not you&rsquo;re right, but that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So Tal says, you know, I think what&rsquo;s happening here</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re triggering a subtle epiphany in somebody.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, all right, I&rsquo;ll buy that.</p>
<p>So I start looking up the neuroscience</p>
<p>of the feeling of epiphany,</p>
<p>getting a hit of oxytocin and serotonin.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is a bonding drug.</p>
<p>You bond to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t bond to you.</p>
<p>When you feel completely understood by me, you bond to me.</p>
<p>Then in one of the relationship podcasts</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m listening to on Andrew,</p>
<p>it says oxytocin inclines people to tell the truth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more honest.</p>
<p>All right, so you feel deeply understood by me,</p>
<p>you bond to me, and you start getting more honest with me.</p>
<p>Serotonin, the neurochemical satisfaction.</p>
<p>Epiphany, you feel oxytocin and serotonin being understood.</p>
<p>All right, I got you bonding to me,</p>
<p>I got you being more honest with me,</p>
<p>and I got you feeling more satisfied so you want less.</p>
<p>What more do you want out of a negotiation?</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s already with leaders</p>
<p>and great negotiators, there&rsquo;s walls built up,</p>
<p>defense mechanisms against that, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re resisting.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re resisting this basic chemistry,</p>
<p>but yes, you should have that.</p>
<p>You should work towards that kind of empathy.</p>
<p>And I personally believe, I don&rsquo;t actually understand why,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve observed it time and time again,</p>
<p>but getting in a room together</p>
<p>and really talking, whether privately or publicly,</p>
<p>but really talking.</p>
<p>And like this, so I&rsquo;ll comment on this.</p>
<p>So right now, this is being recorded,</p>
<p>and a few folks will hear this,</p>
<p>but when you really do a good job</p>
<p>of this kind of conversation, you forget there&rsquo;s cameras.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s much better than there being</p>
<p>even a third person in the room,</p>
<p>but often when world leaders meet,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s press or there&rsquo;s others in the room.</p>
<p>As man to man or man to woman,</p>
<p>you have to meet like in a saloon,</p>
<p>just the two of you and talk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some intimacy and power to that,</p>
<p>to achieve that if you&rsquo;re also willing</p>
<p>to couple that with empathy,</p>
<p>to really hear the other person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a deep, deep intimacy that happens.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>because we get asked this in a black swan group all the time,</p>
<p>how didn&rsquo;t Zoom, that&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have the same visual feedback on Zoom.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Like you and I, I see you from the waist up right now.</p>
<p>If we were on Zoom, I&rsquo;d be looking at you from the waist up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not wearing pants, yeah, with the internet.</p>
<p>I apologize for that.</p>
<p>Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You only see a small portion.</p>
<p>Usually, that&rsquo;s usually where I go,</p>
<p>but anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re both at Ridiculousness.</p>
<p>I appreciate it.</p>
<p>But what makes us different in person?</p>
<p>I actually think there&rsquo;s energy that we&rsquo;re unable,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the instrumentation to define yet.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a feel.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an actual energetic feel that changes.</p>
<p>And just because we don&rsquo;t, again,</p>
<p>just because we can&rsquo;t measure it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would love to figure out what that is.</p>
<p>Folks that are working on virtual reality</p>
<p>are trying to figure out what that is.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, everybody was on Zoom.</p>
<p>Zoom and Microsoft, everybody was trying to figure out</p>
<p>how do we replicate that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand how to replicate that</p>
<p>because it sure is not fun to travel across the world</p>
<p>just to talk to Snowden or Putin or Zelensky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to do it over Zoom, but it&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go in a room with Putin.</p>
<p>You would go in a room?</p>
<p>I would, yeah, 1,000%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d get a that&rsquo;s right out of him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Well, first you would give him a that&rsquo;s right, probably.</p>
<p>Ah, getting and giving, see?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the issue that trips everybody up in negotiation.</p>
<p>The difference between hearing and speaking,</p>
<p>the same words are vastly different.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m looking for is the responses</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting out of you.</p>
<p>First, that&rsquo;s right, especially.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t appreciate what that really means,</p>
<p>hearing it is unsatisfying.</p>
<p>So those two words are really important to you.</p>
<p>You talk about this in your book.</p>
<p>Why is that so?</p>
<p>What does that&rsquo;s right mean?</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Well, it means that what you just heard</p>
<p>you think is unequivocably the truth.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s dead on, it hit the target, it&rsquo;s a bullseye.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been a topic of discussion,</p>
<p>especially between my son and I, a lot, like what happens?</p>
<p>This oxytocin bonding moment.</p>
<p>And his contention has always been like,</p>
<p>Donald Trump is the poster child of what it means</p>
<p>because Donald Trump&rsquo;s an address in an audience,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;s in a debate with Hillary</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s giving a speech someplace.</p>
<p>And when the people that are devoted to him,</p>
<p>when they believe that what he&rsquo;s just said</p>
<p>is completely right, it&rsquo;s insightful,</p>
<p>they look at him or they look at the TV</p>
<p>and they go, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what people say when they&rsquo;re bought in</p>
<p>to what they just heard.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re not convinced of the way</p>
<p>that Donald Trump&rsquo;s followers are bonded to him,</p>
<p>and he also just like this, in my view,</p>
<p>destroys the idea of common ground.</p>
<p>Because when he first started to run for president,</p>
<p>the pundits all said, ah, he&rsquo;s a New Yorker.</p>
<p>Nobody in the Republican Party&rsquo;s gonna like him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s middle America, you know, it&rsquo;s blue collar,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s regular common folks, factory workers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna like Trump because he&rsquo;s from New York</p>
<p>and he went to Wharton, he&rsquo;s an Ivy leaguer</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a son of a wealthy real estate mogul</p>
<p>and he had a million dollars handed to him</p>
<p>when he got out of college.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s born with a silver spoon in his mouth.</p>
<p>The rank and file Republicans</p>
<p>are never gonna accept this guy based on common ground.</p>
<p>Look how smart that was.</p>
<p>Do you think he&rsquo;s a good negotiator?</p>
<p>Do you think Donald Trump is a good negotiator?</p>
<p>No, I think he&rsquo;s a great marketer.</p>
<p>If you look at his negotiation track record,</p>
<p>all right, so I started following Donald Trump</p>
<p>in the 80s when I was in New York.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a last century guy, he&rsquo;s a last century guy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got mutual acquaintances.</p>
<p>The minister that married him to Marla Maples</p>
<p>was a friend of mine, a close friend of mine</p>
<p>and in 1998, I threw a fundraiser in his apartment</p>
<p>at Trump Tower that he attended.</p>
<p>So, no shortage of mutual friends.</p>
<p>We went to the same church.</p>
<p>Still have mutual acquaintances, friends.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, and I&rsquo;ve watched his track record</p>
<p>in negotiation history, which is exactly</p>
<p>his track record with North Korea.</p>
<p>Where are we with North Korea?</p>
<p>What was the deal that he made with North Korea?</p>
<p>See, your answer is the same as everybody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Well, I remember it started out with a lot of fanfare,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>Because nothing ever happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more public fanfare, so marketing-minded</p>
<p>presentation of the relationship.</p>
<p>Starts out with a bang, if he doesn&rsquo;t cut the deal</p>
<p>in a short period, a really short period of time,</p>
<p>he moves on, and everybody wonders what had happened</p>
<p>because there was so much fanfare at the beginning.</p>
<p>Now, at the beginning, him even opening that dialogue</p>
<p>with North Korea was masterful.</p>
<p>Like, I was such a fan.</p>
<p>When you got a president of the United States</p>
<p>that is willing to sit down and talk</p>
<p>with the leader of another nation,</p>
<p>when every other president, all their advisors</p>
<p>are saying, the leader of North Korea is beneath you,</p>
<p>you cannot dignify him by responding to him directly,</p>
<p>and consequently, the Trump administration</p>
<p>inherits a can of worms that has been simmering</p>
<p>for 30 years.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t get a sense of that.</p>
<p>And he opened up a dialogue where nobody else</p>
<p>was capable of opening a dialogue,</p>
<p>and then it just went away.</p>
<p>Nobody knows what happened.</p>
<p>And there was no deal made.</p>
<p>Now, great negotiators make deals.</p>
<p>What do you think about these accusations</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s a narcissist?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a narcissist, does that help you or hurt you?</p>
<p>Is there a more popular term these days than narcissist?</p>
<p>Like, everybody&rsquo;s a narcissist.</p>
<p>Everybody you don&rsquo;t like is a narcissist.</p>
<p>Like, the homeless guy down on the corner,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a narcissist, that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s lost meaning for you a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, and first of all, most psychological terms,</p>
<p>as a hostage negotiator, and really,</p>
<p>we were never into psychology.</p>
<p>And we steered away from it,</p>
<p>because psychology, at best, is a soft science.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not informed these days,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not informed by real studies or neuroscience,</p>
<p>the guys that I&rsquo;m impressed with these days,</p>
<p>psychologists and neuroscientists,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m interested in that guy or gal.</p>
<p>But then, psychology convention.</p>
<p>Do you get them all together and they all agree?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But also, the interesting thing about psychology</p>
<p>is each individual person is way more complicated</p>
<p>than the category psychology tries to create.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about the human brain.</p>
<p>The moment you classify somebody as a narcissist</p>
<p>or depressed or bipolar or insane in any kind of way,</p>
<p>for some reason, you give yourself a convenient excuse</p>
<p>not to see them as a complicated human being,</p>
<p>to empathize with them.</p>
<p>I had that when I was talking to,</p>
<p>I did an interview with Kanye West,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a lot of popular opinions</p>
<p>about him being mentally unwell and so on.</p>
<p>And I felt that that kind of way of thinking</p>
<p>is a very convenient way of thinking,</p>
<p>to ignore the fact that he&rsquo;s a human being</p>
<p>that, again, wants to be understood and heard.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only way you can have that conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree completely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I feel so close to you now.</p>
<p>It might be because I&rsquo;m not wearing pants.</p>
<p>All right, so what we&rsquo;re-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re funnier than I am, that bothers me.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll say something stupid soon enough.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>But you said, we were talking about terrorists</p>
<p>and not negotiating with terrorists.</p>
<p>Is there something-</p>
<p>Nice job going all the way back</p>
<p>to where that rabbit hole started.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re Alice in Wonderland right now.</p>
<p>Is there something about walking the way</p>
<p>of not negotiating?</p>
<p>Is there power in that?</p>
<p>All right, so it depends upon whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing it with integrity or a tactic to start with.</p>
<p>And then also, hostage negotiators are successful</p>
<p>93% of the time, kind of across the board.</p>
<p>Which means that the 7% of the time is gonna go bad.</p>
<p>And that was my old boss, Gary Nessner.</p>
<p>I learned so much from Gary.</p>
<p>But a phrase that he used over and over and over again</p>
<p>until I finally worked the case and went bad</p>
<p>was, this is gonna be the best chance of success.</p>
<p>Best chance of success.</p>
<p>And then something went bad,</p>
<p>and I remember thinking like,</p>
<p>well, best chance of success is no guarantee of success.</p>
<p>So your question is, are there negotiations</p>
<p>you should walk away from?</p>
<p>If you got no shot at success, then don&rsquo;t negotiate.</p>
<p>And you have to accept the fact</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some deals you&rsquo;re never gonna make.</p>
<p>You know, we teach in my company,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a sin to not get the deal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sin to take a long time to not get the deal.</p>
<p>And you know, Gary, in his infinite wisdom,</p>
<p>you know, they realized that there was something</p>
<p>called suicide by cop,</p>
<p>and that it might have,</p>
<p>Gary was very much into clusters of behavior.</p>
<p>He kept us away from psychological terms,</p>
<p>and there would be clusters of behavior</p>
<p>that would be high-risk indicators.</p>
<p>And he wrote a block of instruction</p>
<p>called high-risk indicators,</p>
<p>which meant if you start seeing this stuff show up,</p>
<p>this thing&rsquo;s probably going bad.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna need to recognize that</p>
<p>from the very beginning and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same way in business and personal life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to the head of a marketing company</p>
<p>I have tremendous respect for.</p>
<p>I admire what this guy and his company does.</p>
<p>Started from scratch.</p>
<p>He borrowed space in the back of a drugstore</p>
<p>to start his company.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s hugely successful.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s laying out to me</p>
<p>that he finally had to confront a potential client</p>
<p>and walk away from him.</p>
<p>And he said, how do you think I handled this?</p>
<p>My answer was 1,000% correct.</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact,</p>
<p>the behavior that he indicated, he&rsquo;s a type,</p>
<p>and you should have walked away sooner than you did</p>
<p>because this guy was playing you the whole time.</p>
<p>Al-Qaeda, 2004, they&rsquo;re playing us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not negotiating.</p>
<p>We called them out on it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re negotiating.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t say it exactly like that,</p>
<p>but that was absolutely the approach.</p>
<p>Confront people on their behavior in a respectful way.</p>
<p>And signal that you&rsquo;re willing to walk away.</p>
<p>And mean it, 1,000%.</p>
<p>And mean it.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that terrifying?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s scary because you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to really walk away.</p>
<p>Or do you have to really want to walk away?</p>
<p>Well, this gets core values, your view of reality.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s an abundant world, it&rsquo;s not scary to walk away.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a finite world with limited opportunities,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s horrifying.</p>
<p>But you have to use that worldview</p>
<p>to be willing to actually walk away.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It could be walking away from a lot of money.</p>
<p>It could be walking away from something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna hurt people.</p>
<p>Because if you lose a hostage.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, but if they&rsquo;re not gonna let the hostage out.</p>
<p>Suicide by cop, they ain&rsquo;t letting them go.</p>
<p>The 7%, how do most negotiations fail?</p>
<p>The bad guys were never there to make a deal</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>If it was suicide by cop.</p>
<p>If they were there to, if they&rsquo;re on a killing journey,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an Israeli phrase.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re on a killing journey,</p>
<p>and the actions that they&rsquo;re currently engaged in</p>
<p>are part of that killing journey.</p>
<p>Killing journey.</p>
<p>Is there advice you can give about,</p>
<p>you mentioned Israel, Palestine, the Middle East.</p>
<p>Taking on a few conversations on that topic.</p>
<p>Is there hope for that part of the world?</p>
<p>And from that hope, is there some advice you could lend?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s hope.</p>
<p>And then I got friends on both sides.</p>
<p>And also, when I got my, after I left the FBI,</p>
<p>most people listening to this</p>
<p>probably not gonna remember who Rodney Dangerfield was.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s a comedian.</p>
<p>Still doesn&rsquo;t get any respect, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and.</p>
<p>New Yorker?</p>
<p>Is he a New Yorker?</p>
<p>I think he was a New York guy.</p>
<p>Or like Jersey or something, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he did a movie a long time ago</p>
<p>called Back to School.</p>
<p>He went back to school.</p>
<p>He was an old guy, Back to School.</p>
<p>So I went back to school after I left the FBI.</p>
<p>I did get a master&rsquo;s at Harvard Kennedy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m running across</p>
<p>people on both sides of that.</p>
<p>And when they could talk,</p>
<p>they said, let&rsquo;s start from the promise</p>
<p>that we both sides want a better life for our kids.</p>
<p>Which is this version that I was telling you earlier</p>
<p>from Tom Girardi.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pick a point in the future</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re both happy with.</p>
<p>And they found that they could talk.</p>
<p>All right, so it might not be better for us.</p>
<p>How do we make it better for our kids?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the hope derives from.</p>
<p>Because I think both sides ultimately</p>
<p>want it to be better for their kids,</p>
<p>which is why they still engage in interactions,</p>
<p>and which is why I think the leadership,</p>
<p>regardless of how compromised</p>
<p>they might be on either side.</p>
<p>There are few straight players in the game</p>
<p>in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Or anywhere for that matter.</p>
<p>But they want a better future for their kids.</p>
<p>You get people to agree</p>
<p>that you want a better future for your kids,</p>
<p>now you can start talking about,</p>
<p>well, how do we work our way back from that?</p>
<p>And then, all right,</p>
<p>so we got a mutual point in the future.</p>
<p>The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations</p>
<p>are also, for me, interesting.</p>
<p>Because you mentioned Clubhouse</p>
<p>about almost two years ago now.</p>
<p>When Israel was shelling Gaza.</p>
<p>They hit the UPI office.</p>
<p>They were hitting,</p>
<p>they got fed up with the rocket attacks from Hamas.</p>
<p>And of course Hamas is putting rockets in the UPI office,</p>
<p>or the AP office, whichever press office it was there.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that office gonna be there otherwise?</p>
<p>Hamas is running a show.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna run that office</p>
<p>unless you let them store weapons there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just part of the game.</p>
<p>And are they gonna store them</p>
<p>in specially designated ammunition dumps?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re gonna put them in schools,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna put them in hospitals,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna put them in all places</p>
<p>that when Israel hits them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna look really bad.</p>
<p>So after a while,</p>
<p>Israel gets fed up and they start shelling Gaza,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re hitting these places.</p>
<p>Friend of mine, Nicole Benham,</p>
<p>is hosting rooms on Clubhouse,</p>
<p>and she says, you gotta come on.</p>
<p>The vitriol is killing me.</p>
<p>These are all turning into screaming matches.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s talking to anybody.</p>
<p>I said, all right, cool.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go on, we&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And watch, we won&rsquo;t have a single argument.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll invite people on from both sides.</p>
<p>There was one rule.</p>
<p>Before you started to describe</p>
<p>what you thought of the other side,</p>
<p>you had to say, before I disagree with you,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I think your position is.</p>
<p>And you gotta continue to state the other side&rsquo;s position</p>
<p>until they agree that you&rsquo;ve got it.</p>
<p>Now, what happened?</p>
<p>No agreement and no arguments.</p>
<p>That was what we were really going for.</p>
<p>We wanted to show that people on both sides,</p>
<p>in one of their emotional timeframes,</p>
<p>if your only requirement was</p>
<p>you had to state the other side&rsquo;s position first,</p>
<p>nobody got out of control.</p>
<p>Did it work?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p>We wanted to show people that you can have conversations</p>
<p>that do not devolve into screaming matches with vitriol,</p>
<p>talking about how you&rsquo;re dedicated</p>
<p>to the destruction of the other side.</p>
<p>Just first, see if you can outline</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really impressive</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve just, having seen on Clubhouse,</p>
<p>people, which part of the reason I liked Clubhouse,</p>
<p>you get to hear voices from all sides,</p>
<p>they were emotionally intense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was, I mean, I&rsquo;m sweating just</p>
<p>in the buildup of your story here.</p>
<p>I thought it could go to hell,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying it kind of worked.</p>
<p>Not one person lost control.</p>
<p>Now, of the two sides,</p>
<p>the people that were speaking on behalf of the Israelis</p>
<p>were a little better at articulating</p>
<p>supportive positions for the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Most of the people that want to speak up</p>
<p>on behalf of the Palestinians,</p>
<p>they just, they&rsquo;d want to start doing like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing this, and I&rsquo;d say, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>You can go there, just not yet.</p>
<p>Before you go there, you can say that all you want.</p>
<p>Before you go there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to try to articulate to them</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>They got to tell you you got it right.</p>
<p>And what would consistently happen</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a leveling out of a person</p>
<p>to try to see the other side&rsquo;s perspective and articulate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enormously beneficial to the person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to do it,</p>
<p>which was really the point that we were trying to make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting exercise.</p>
<p>I mean, by way of advice,</p>
<p>so if it works at clubhouse,</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a voice app where you can be anonymous.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really regular people,</p>
<p>but regular people who can also be anonymous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it can be chaos.</p>
<p>If it works there, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>For when you sit down for a conversation</p>
<p>and cross the table from somebody,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have them even steel man the other side.</p>
<p>Have them just state the other side.</p>
<p>Just explain your understanding of it.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And every now and then I would jump in.</p>
<p>Like somebody supporting Israel,</p>
<p>whoever the heck they were,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d say a couple things.</p>
<p>And the Palestinian guy would be like,</p>
<p>or gal or supportive of them would say,</p>
<p>you know, you missed some stuff.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, let me jump in.</p>
<p>First of all, I know what the Nakba is.</p>
<p>The Nakba is a catastrophe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the day Israel was born.</p>
<p>You, you know, for the rest of the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the birth of Israel, for you it&rsquo;s the Nakba.</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;ve got members of your family</p>
<p>that is still walking around</p>
<p>carrying keys to the front door of the house</p>
<p>they abandoned.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d be like, yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, you feel bad that in point of fact,</p>
<p>that in World War II,</p>
<p>the world stood back and watched</p>
<p>while the Nazis threw the Jews off a building.</p>
<p>The only problem was they landed on you.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d be like, yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>So articulating, you know, deeply</p>
<p>what the other side feels is transformative</p>
<p>for both people involved in the process.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the toughest negotiation you&rsquo;ve ever been a part of</p>
<p>or maybe observed or heard of?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a difficult case just stands out to you</p>
<p>or maybe just one of many?</p>
<p>Well, the stuff we went through with Al-Qaeda</p>
<p>in and around Iraq, Iraq and Saudi,</p>
<p>first one was in Saudi in 2004 timeframe.</p>
<p>The hardest part about that was working with family members</p>
<p>and not deceiving them about the possibility outcome.</p>
<p>Yeah, how do you talk to family members?</p>
<p>Is that part of the negotiation?</p>
<p>Yeah, empathy, learning empathy the hard way.</p>
<p>And then being able to take it up to higher levels</p>
<p>because at its base level,</p>
<p>a guy that we&rsquo;re working with now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coaching us in the US</p>
<p>and is a business partner, his name is Jonathan Smith.</p>
<p>He pointed out to us that there&rsquo;s a shoe-ha-ree concept.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with shoe-ha-ree?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a martial arts concept.</p>
<p>And shoe is, do it exactly as the master&rsquo;s</p>
<p>telling you to do it.</p>
<p>Wax on, wax off, karate kid stuff.</p>
<p>A-ha is when you&rsquo;ve done the repetitions enough times,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting a feel for it</p>
<p>and you begin to see the same lessons</p>
<p>coming from other masters.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing the same thing show up in other places.</p>
<p>And at the re-level, you&rsquo;re still in the discipline</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re making up your own rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost a flow state.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t realize that you&rsquo;re making up your own rules.</p>
<p>And if somebody asks you where you learned that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably say, my sensei taught it to me.</p>
<p>My master taught it to me.</p>
<p>This will come back around to negotiating</p>
<p>with families pretty quick.</p>
<p>We did this once because there&rsquo;s a bunch of people</p>
<p>that we coach, business people that are scared</p>
<p>of the amount of money that they&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re not coaching them regularly.</p>
<p>One of these guys, Michael, we&rsquo;re interviewing him</p>
<p>for a social media posting about two years ago.</p>
<p>And Michael says, yeah, you gotta gather data</p>
<p>with your eyes.</p>
<p>And I went, ooh, I like that.</p>
<p>I said, where did you hear that before?</p>
<p>And he goes, I don&rsquo;t know, I heard it from you, I think.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember saying that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve heard that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in re.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s this got to do with families?</p>
<p>Empathy at its base level and a shoe level,</p>
<p>I learned it on the Suicide Hotline,</p>
<p>is saying like, you sound angry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just calling out the elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Your emotions, what&rsquo;s driving you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m throwing a label on your affect.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying you sound, or it sounds like you are,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the basic Karate Kid wax on,</p>
<p>wax off approach.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of hostage negotiators</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll tell you empathy doesn&rsquo;t work at home.</p>
<p>Not true.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve never gotten out of shoe.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting ready to talk to your significant other.</p>
<p>And you want to go someplace</p>
<p>that you know is going to make her angry.</p>
<p>You want to go do something.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s real negotiation right there.</p>
<p>You could say to her, you sound angry,</p>
<p>in which case she&rsquo;s going to blow up</p>
<p>because her reaction is, you made me angry, bozo.</p>
<p>Can you act like you&rsquo;re an innocent third party?</p>
<p>Or that you were independent of how I feel bad?</p>
<p>And you learn a little bit more,</p>
<p>and you say the high level is,</p>
<p>this is probably going to make you angry.</p>
<p>And then what I did with families,</p>
<p>I knew how they felt before I walked in the door.</p>
<p>I knew that they were scared to death.</p>
<p>You find out that your husband, your father, your brother,</p>
<p>has been grabbed by Al-Qaeda,</p>
<p>who are in the business of chopping people&rsquo;s heads off,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be horrified.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t walk into them and go like, you sound angry.</p>
<p>Of course I&rsquo;m angry, you idiot.</p>
<p>But knowing what they are,</p>
<p>I used to walk into families&rsquo; houses,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d say, I know you&rsquo;re angry.</p>
<p>Now, what are the circumstances</p>
<p>dictate that they should also feel?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to feel abandoned by their government.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to feel totally alone.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be scared.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to be angry</p>
<p>because they feel the government abandoned them.</p>
<p>Now, there in point of fact, is this an accurate statement?</p>
<p>That their loved one voluntarily went into a war zone</p>
<p>and voluntarily went someplace</p>
<p>their government told them not to go.</p>
<p>Are the facts that the government abandoned them?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact,</p>
<p>the government tried to get them to not go,</p>
<p>and they went anyway.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t change how they felt in a moment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d walk into a house and I&rsquo;d go, I know you&rsquo;re angry.</p>
<p>I know you feel abandoned and alone,</p>
<p>and I know you&rsquo;re horrified,</p>
<p>and I know you feel the United States government</p>
<p>has abandoned you.</p>
<p>And they would look at me and go like,</p>
<p>yeah, what do we do now?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready to rock.</p>
<p>Is there, with Al-Qaeda or in general,</p>
<p>is there a language barrier too?</p>
<p>It could be just barriers</p>
<p>of different communication styles.</p>
<p>I mean, you got like a New Yorker way about it.</p>
<p>That might make somebody from like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Laguna Beach uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Do you feel that language barrier in communication</p>
<p>is that language and communication style</p>
<p>in itself creating a barrier?</p>
<p>You got a barrier when you think that your way is the way.</p>
<p>Sure, that&rsquo;s the biggest barrier.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that happens all the time.</p>
<p>When people talk about,</p>
<p>what about cross-cultural negotiations?</p>
<p>What hand do I gotta shake hands with</p>
<p>so that I can get my way?</p>
<p>Well, if you strip it all down,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all basically the same blank slate when we were born.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s got a limbic system.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s limbic system works pretty much the same way.</p>
<p>People are driven by the same sorts of decisions.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s this affect my future?</p>
<p>What am I at risk of losing?</p>
<p>How does this affect my identity?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an Al-Qaeda kidnapper.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a New York City businessman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a tobacco farmer in the South.</p>
<p>All making those same decisions based on those same things.</p>
<p>So as soon as I start to navigate that,</p>
<p>and I tailor my approach, which is what empathy is,</p>
<p>to how you see things.</p>
<p>So I can be the biggest goofball ever</p>
<p>from if you live in the South,</p>
<p>yeah, maybe I&rsquo;m a New Yorker,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m somebody from LA, or somebody from Chicago.</p>
<p>But my geography is foreign to you,</p>
<p>but as soon as I start dialing in</p>
<p>on how you see things, suddenly you&rsquo;re listening.</p>
<p>What about the three voices you talk about?</p>
<p>The different voices you can use in that communication?</p>
<p>Right, the assertive voice, direct and honest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a natural born assertive.</p>
<p>Natural born.</p>
<p>I thought we&rsquo;re all blank slate,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re born.</p>
<p>Yeah, stop catching me on what I said.</p>
<p>How dare you accuse me of what I&rsquo;ve said?</p>
<p>To quote Bono, I stand accused of what I&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>the things I&rsquo;ve said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a few good lines.</p>
<p>So assertive voice, you&rsquo;re born that way.</p>
<p>Which one, what are the other ones?</p>
<p>Analyst.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an analyst.</p>
<p>And I can tell you&rsquo;re assertive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an analyst voice?</p>
<p>Well, an analyst is close to the</p>
<p>Smarter?</p>
<p>More thoughtful?</p>
<p>No, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>Look, you ever do a decision tree?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, you like it too, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>So decision trees, you know, I&rsquo;m a computer scientist,</p>
<p>so I like mathematical, systematic ways</p>
<p>of seeing the world.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an analyst.</p>
<p>You think Donald Trump would ever say that?</p>
<p>Unlikely.</p>
<p>Well, is he more the assertive kind?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a natural born assertive, yeah.</p>
<p>Are all New Yorkers like this?</p>
<p>Is there something in the water?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a crazy thing.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s an affect that a city can have.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, New York&rsquo;s northeast, not just New York,</p>
<p>but the northeast is a little more,</p>
<p>the affect of the area, of the culture of the area.</p>
<p>The individual&rsquo;s still boiled down into</p>
<p>the three types, cross the board.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the third one?</p>
<p>Accommodator, smiling, optimistic, hopeful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a thousand percent convinced that the phrase</p>
<p>hope is not a strategy is designed at people&rsquo;s frustration</p>
<p>over a third of the population being accommodators</p>
<p>that are hope-driven.</p>
<p>I hope this works out.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re very relationship, on the surface,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very relationship oriented.</p>
<p>They tend to appear to be very positive, and they are,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really built around hope.</p>
<p>And the idea is you can adopt these three voices.</p>
<p>You can, yeah, you can learn them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all learnable.</p>
<p>Analysts are often mistaken for accommodators,</p>
<p>because, as you said before,</p>
<p>analysts are more introspective, more analytical.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at the systems at work,</p>
<p>and if they like to learn,</p>
<p>they notice that accommodators make more deals</p>
<p>than they make.</p>
<p>They also notice that there&rsquo;s a higher failure rate</p>
<p>of the deals, but since they notice stuff</p>
<p>and they think about it, they catch on faster</p>
<p>than assertives do, that the pleasant nature</p>
<p>of an accommodator contributes strongly</p>
<p>to them making deals.</p>
<p>Like my daughter-in-law is an analyst.</p>
<p>You know, another descriptor we have in that,</p>
<p>an analyst are assassins.</p>
<p>You know, an analyst will snipe you from 1,000 yards out</p>
<p>in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>and you never know what hits you,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really happy with that.</p>
<p>But how has assertiveness, the assertive voice,</p>
<p>served you in negotiation?</p>
<p>Poorly.</p>
<p>The assertive voice is almost always counterproductive.</p>
<p>It feels like getting hit in the face with a brick,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s almost always counterproductive.</p>
<p>So for me to be more effective,</p>
<p>especially in a negotiation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to slow down and smile.</p>
<p>You know, I heard that Teddy Roosevelt</p>
<p>was a good negotiator and that he was extremely stubborn,</p>
<p>and perhaps the right term for that would be assertive,</p>
<p>but he picked his battles.</p>
<p>Is there some value to holding strong,</p>
<p>to a principle?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t even know if,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the opposite of empathy.</p>
<p>Are there times when you can just stick,</p>
<p>be extremely stubborn to your principles,</p>
<p>to a negotiation?</p>
<p>Oh, we do it all the time.</p>
<p>We just, you know, we&rsquo;re just nice about it.</p>
<p>Okay, it helps to be nice, you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Well, yes, because I need you to hear me.</p>
<p>And the assertive tone of voice,</p>
<p>so when we do our training,</p>
<p>typically we do an exercise called 60 seconds or she dies.</p>
<p>And I play the bad guy bank robber,</p>
<p>and I ask you to be the hostage negotiator.</p>
<p>And your job is to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you the four real world constraints,</p>
<p>and then you got to try and negotiate me out of the bank.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re doing this,</p>
<p>now the first voice that I always use in that exercise</p>
<p>is the assertive voice,</p>
<p>which is the commanding voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the voice that all police officers</p>
<p>are taught to use in the street.</p>
<p>Issue loud and clear commands.</p>
<p>You know, it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>to me, I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m attacking you.</p>
<p>I just feel like I&rsquo;m being direct and honest and clear.</p>
<p>You on the other hand feel attacked.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re doing this exercise in Austin</p>
<p>a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>The first participant has an Apple watch on.</p>
<p>He tells us afterwards that sitting still,</p>
<p>not even answering,</p>
<p>when he first gets hit in the face</p>
<p>with the assertive voice,</p>
<p>his heart rate jumped to 170,</p>
<p>which is a typical fight or flight reaction.</p>
<p>I come at you like I&rsquo;m fighting you.</p>
<p>Your fight flight mechanisms all kick into gear,</p>
<p>which clouds your thinking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re automatically dumber in the moment.</p>
<p>So if I want to make a great long-term deal with you,</p>
<p>highly profitable,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m agnostic to you being profitable.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d be profitable, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to make money for me.</p>
<p>Me making you dumber will always hurt me.</p>
<p>Me making you feel attacked will always hurt me.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s never a value in being,</p>
<p>in you making me afraid.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never a long-term value in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another thing that Tal Roz,</p>
<p>when we were writing a book,</p>
<p>braced me on</p>
<p>because he said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s scientific data out there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called strategic umbrage.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>Well, whether or not it&rsquo;s scientific,</p>
<p>I would call that into question.</p>
<p>But he said, there&rsquo;s studies out there</p>
<p>that show that strategic umbrage works.</p>
<p>And another thing that I also enjoy,</p>
<p>you probably get tired of me saying</p>
<p>wonderful things about Andrew.</p>
<p>He taught me-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never enough wonderful things</p>
<p>to say about the great Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>the host of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>that everybody should subscribe to.</p>
<p>You should talk to Andrew.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re funnier than he is, though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you that.</p>
<p>Hear that, Andrew?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s funny accidentally.</p>
<p>He makes me laugh all the time.</p>
<p>Not when he&rsquo;s trying to be funny.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a really,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of the people in this world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s truly legit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a really strong scientist</p>
<p>and a really strong communicator</p>
<p>and a good human being.</p>
<p>Those together don&rsquo;t come often.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice to see.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a treasure, national treasure.</p>
<p>Anyway, you were saying?</p>
<p>Well, he sort of taught me how to think about data</p>
<p>and studies and science</p>
<p>and also from different books</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s turned me on to.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really helped me think about this stuff.</p>
<p>So the studies about strategic umbrage</p>
<p>were done, the ones that I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>that show it&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>There were simulated negotiations with college students.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s the problem with that.</p>
<p>A simulated negotiation with a college student.</p>
<p>College students are gonna sit down</p>
<p>as part of their assignment.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna sit down one time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna sit down for 45 minutes</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna think that</p>
<p>if they didn&rsquo;t come to a deal at all,</p>
<p>that they failed.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no ongoing implementation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a deal</p>
<p>and then they walk away of a pretend situation.</p>
<p>So they got no actual real skin in the game.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no deal on earth.</p>
<p>Do you sit down and come to agreement 45 minutes</p>
<p>and never see each other again</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s the implementation of the deal,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s only payment.</p>
<p>So the data is flawed based on the way it was collected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a highly flawed study.</p>
<p>And all data is flawed, as you know, as a scientist.</p>
<p>You just gotta be aware of what the flaws are</p>
<p>and decide whether or not that destroys the study</p>
<p>or what do you think?</p>
<p>Take a look at the data.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as perfect data.</p>
<p>Look at the data, see what you think of it.</p>
<p>The data that says the strategic umbrage works</p>
<p>is based on flawed circumstances.</p>
<p>Can you explain strategic umbrage?</p>
<p>Getting mad, scaring the other side into a deal.</p>
<p>Getting mad at using anger strategically</p>
<p>to bully the other side into an agreement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice to hear, in some sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to hear that empathy is the right way</p>
<p>in almost all situations.</p>
<p>Best chance is success.</p>
<p>Not that it works every time,</p>
<p>just it works more than anything else does.</p>
<p>What is the technique of mirroring?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of cool stuff in your book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just kinda jump around.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s mirroring?</p>
<p>Mirroring is like, it&rsquo;s one of the most fun skills</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the simplest to execute.</p>
<p>You just repeat one to three-ish words</p>
<p>of what somebody said.</p>
<p>Usually the last one to three words.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve found about it is</p>
<p>the people that really like mirroring</p>
<p>love it because it&rsquo;s so simple</p>
<p>and so effortless and invisible.</p>
<p>They typically, for lack of a better term,</p>
<p>tend to be both high IQ and high EQ.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not a high IQ guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an average dude.</p>
<p>I like to think that I can learn.</p>
<p>In EQ, emotional intelligence is a skill you can build</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m always working on building it.</p>
<p>But a lot of really regular average people</p>
<p>will be like, mirroring, that&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why they don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>But when I find somebody that loves to mirror,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always ask them, how&rsquo;d you score on IQ?</p>
<p>And typically, their IQ&rsquo;s pretty high.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know why that combination</p>
<p>attracts people to mirroring</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nine skills.</p>
<p>Eight from hostage negotiation</p>
<p>and the ninth really was tone of voice</p>
<p>and we just define that as a skill.</p>
<p>And each one is different and focuses</p>
<p>on different components of the conversation.</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t like to mirror.</p>
<p>They find it so awkward.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t particularly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly strong in mirroring.</p>
<p>I gotta do it intentionally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good at labeling.</p>
<p>But does it almost always work?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels maybe awkward, but there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true, there&rsquo;s gotta be ways to signal</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re truly listening.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>I think you can do body language, you can,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to signal that,</p>
<p>but mirroring is probably just this trivial little hack.</p>
<p>It kinda is.</p>
<p>You know what, there&rsquo;s a situation,</p>
<p>I had a conversation with Stephen Kodkin,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s this historian, and he would say my name</p>
<p>a lot throughout the conversation.</p>
<p>He would be like, well, you have to understand, Lex,</p>
<p>is that, and for some reason</p>
<p>that was making me feel really good.</p>
<p>I was like, he cares about me.</p>
<p>And I wonder if that key, if everyone has that key,</p>
<p>that could be the name, just using people&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>could be powerful.</p>
<p>Using the name is really context-driven.</p>
<p>It can be extremely powerful with someone who&rsquo;s genuine,</p>
<p>and it comes across in their demeanor,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s used in a way that you can tell</p>
<p>is meant to encourage you as opposed to exploit you.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And the people that are really into exploiting</p>
<p>will also use it and do the same thing.</p>
<p>So you have to be, you have to avoid using the things</p>
<p>that people that are exploiters, manipulators use,</p>
<p>because it might signal to others</p>
<p>that this person is trying to trick me.</p>
<p>Gotta be very conscious of it, yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s labeling that you mentioned, the thing you like?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I said earlier,</p>
<p>that old progression from you sound angry</p>
<p>to this is probably gonna make you angry</p>
<p>to I know you&rsquo;re angry.</p>
<p>Labeling is hanging a label on an emotion or an affect,</p>
<p>and then just calling it out.</p>
<p>Is that almost always good?</p>
<p>Could it be a source of frustration</p>
<p>when a person&rsquo;s being angry</p>
<p>and you kind of put a label on it?</p>
<p>Call out the elephant.</p>
<p>Is it possible that that will lead to escalation</p>
<p>of that feeling versus a resolution?</p>
<p>Well, what would make it bad?</p>
<p>Like, if I&rsquo;m pointing out like that blatantly obvious,</p>
<p>like if I say, look, I need you to get up</p>
<p>and go down to the bank and make the deposit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m talking to my, somebody works in my company.</p>
<p>I need you to get on the phone with this person</p>
<p>and make the appointment.</p>
<p>And they go, sounds like you want me to talk to this person.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be annoying.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just so absurdly obvious</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no insight in your label at all.</p>
<p>And as soon as you&rsquo;re demonstrating an awareness</p>
<p>or a subtlety or an insight, either to you or to them,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re making progress.</p>
<p>So the only time a label</p>
<p>could ever potentially be counterproductive</p>
<p>is like if you weren&rsquo;t actually listening</p>
<p>and the label indicates that you&rsquo;re not listening.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m teaching at USC and I&rsquo;m teaching labels.</p>
<p>And one of the kids in a class,</p>
<p>he just wants to take the skills and make his deals</p>
<p>and just hustle them.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just looking for a hustle.</p>
<p>So he writes up a paper about,</p>
<p>he goes, there&rsquo;s some malls,</p>
<p>I think over by Palm Springs or someplace,</p>
<p>some malls, a lot of people go to buy suits.</p>
<p>So he goes in there</p>
<p>and he immediately starts a bargaining</p>
<p>that my book teaches with no empathy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, throws a price to the guy</p>
<p>and the guy&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>And he throws another price to the guy</p>
<p>and the guy&rsquo;s like, no.</p>
<p>And then he says to the guy behind the counter,</p>
<p>sounds like we can make a deal.</p>
<p>Like, no, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I just shot down everything that you just said.</p>
<p>If anything, it sounds like we&rsquo;re never gonna make a deal.</p>
<p>But he tried to use this label for manipulation.</p>
<p>Now, the guy didn&rsquo;t get mad on the other side,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, clearly this dude is not listening to me.</p>
<p>And at the core of everything,</p>
<p>you have a bunch of like, almost like hacks,</p>
<p>like techniques you can use,</p>
<p>but at the core of it is empathy.</p>
<p>At the core of it is empathy, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main thing.</p>
<p>You can be able to just sit there and listen.</p>
<p>And perceive.</p>
<p>Yeah, and look for insights.</p>
<p>You know what, I like silence.</p>
<p>Or like, you&rsquo;re both sitting there chilling</p>
<p>with a drink, looking up at the stars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a moment, the silence makes you kind of zoom out</p>
<p>and realize you&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>As opposed to playing a game,</p>
<p>or some kind of like chess game of negotiation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in it together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some intimacy to the silence.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;ll ask a question</p>
<p>and just let the other person sit there</p>
<p>in silence before they answer.</p>
<p>Or vice versa, they ask me a question,</p>
<p>I sit there in silence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big, feels like a big intimate thing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the other two types,</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;ve experienced that, are afraid of it.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m actually gonna do is,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, I&rsquo;m really comfortable with silence,</p>
<p>I think, because I&rsquo;ve experienced its effectiveness,</p>
<p>and also my son Brandon,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s the king of dynamic silence.</p>
<p>He coaches people, he says,</p>
<p>go silent, count thousands to yourself.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stop till you run out of numbers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also good, full of good lines.</p>
<p>He is, that he is.</p>
<p>And so, there&rsquo;s so much to it.</p>
<p>But the other two types are natural wiring against it</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;ve experienced it.</p>
<p>And your gut intuition&rsquo;s giving you data</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve experienced it.</p>
<p>But your amygdala&rsquo;s kicking into gear,</p>
<p>again, sorry, I realize it&rsquo;s more complicated than that,</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;ve experienced it.</p>
<p>So, accommodators, hope-based.</p>
<p>How do they signal fury?</p>
<p>The silent treatment.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>So when you go silent,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re scared to death you&rsquo;re furious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s how they indicate it.</p>
<p>The assertive thinks that you as the analyst went silent</p>
<p>because you wanted to talk some more.</p>
<p>When a point of fact,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re either, you&rsquo;re thinking or,</p>
<p>and I love your description,</p>
<p>the feeling of intimacy in silence</p>
<p>and experiencing the moment.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m actually going to factor that</p>
<p>into trying to get,</p>
<p>the accommodators love shared intimacy.</p>
<p>They would love to experience a moment.</p>
<p>And I can see that being very compelling</p>
<p>than be willing to cross that chasm</p>
<p>and experience silence and see how it works for them.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s nerve-wracking,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s intimate.</p>
<p>Because you start thinking,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the other person thinking?</p>
<p>Are we actually going to do this?</p>
<p>Are we going to sit here for 10 seconds and count?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s tricks to it, I guess,</p>
<p>like Brandon says is to just count it out</p>
<p>and realize through data that there&rsquo;s intimacy to it.</p>
<p>I had a friend of mine,</p>
<p>he lost his voice because of singing.</p>
<p>So he couldn&rsquo;t, the doctor says he can&rsquo;t talk for a week,</p>
<p>just to heal the voice, the vocal cords.</p>
<p>But he hung out with other people, with friends,</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t talk to them.</p>
<p>He just hung out.</p>
<p>And he said it was really intimate.</p>
<p>They both didn&rsquo;t talk to each other.</p>
<p>They just sat there and enjoyed time together.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s a wake-up call.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing to try maybe with people in your life.</p>
<p>Just hang out and don&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>As an experiment, don&rsquo;t say anything the entire day.</p>
<p>But hang, spend time with them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried it myself.</p>
<p>It seems, it&rsquo;s kind of like a silent retreat,</p>
<p>but more active as part of regular everyday life.</p>
<p>Anyway, is there other interesting techniques</p>
<p>we can talk about here?</p>
<p>So for example, creating the illusion of control.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s principally by asking what and how questions.</p>
<p>Because people love to tell others what to do</p>
<p>or how to do it.</p>
<p>It does a lot.</p>
<p>That was really the way, when the book was first written,</p>
<p>that we really thought about what and how questions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s giving the other side the illusion of control.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot more to it than that,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve discovered.</p>
<p>I mean, it triggers deep thinking.</p>
<p>It wears people down.</p>
<p>Deep thinking can be exhausting.</p>
<p>And you want, so what&rsquo;s the role of exhaustion</p>
<p>in negotiation?</p>
<p>Is that ultimately what?</p>
<p>You gotta be careful with that.</p>
<p>Some people exhaust intentionally.</p>
<p>One of my negotiation heroes, a guy now</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s unfortunately suffering from dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>John Domenico Pico is the UN hostage negotiators</p>
<p>that got all the Western hostages out of Beirut in the 80s.</p>
<p>And he wrote a book called Man Without a Gun.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m acquainted with Johnny at this point in time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he has any memory of who I am at all.</p>
<p>But he writes in his book,</p>
<p>one of the great secrets of negotiation</p>
<p>is exhausting the other side.</p>
<p>Political negotiations, that could be Johnny,</p>
<p>was very deferential.</p>
<p>It was in the middle of, in the 80s leading up</p>
<p>to about 1986-ish.</p>
<p>Every negotiation involving warring parties</p>
<p>in the Middle East that you can imagine.</p>
<p>He was in Cyprus.</p>
<p>He was in Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran.</p>
<p>The Iranian government had tremendous trust in him</p>
<p>as a Westerner, a representative of the UN.</p>
<p>Got all the Westerners out of Beirut.</p>
<p>And he was just ridiculously patient.</p>
<p>And which the other side would often find exhausting.</p>
<p>So exhaustion can be a component</p>
<p>of finding resolution in a negotiation.</p>
<p>If it tamps down the negative emotions,</p>
<p>often exhaustion will tamp down negative emotions.</p>
<p>The real trick is really getting negative emotions</p>
<p>out of the way.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re dumber in a negative frame of mind.</p>
<p>So the goal is always positive emotion,</p>
<p>as you talk about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re always chasing together.</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the that&rsquo;s right is about.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Whatever you&rsquo;re triggering,</p>
<p>whatever the chemistry you&rsquo;re triggering in your brain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, yeah, yeah, we&rsquo;re doing good here.</p>
<p>I think so, long-term, for long-term success, absolutely.</p>
<p>How is the word fair used and abused?</p>
<p>The F-bomb.</p>
<p>The F-bomb, as you call it.</p>
<p>How is it used and abused in negotiation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually used, it&rsquo;s most frequently used as a weapon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s abused as a point of manipulation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what people say when they feel backed into a corner</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t come up with any legitimate reason</p>
<p>as to why they&rsquo;re being backed into a corner.</p>
<p>Like nobody uses the word F, the F-bomb.</p>
<p>Nobody uses the word fair</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve got criteria to back them up.</p>
<p>So consequently, when somebody starts dropping it,</p>
<p>you got to realize the other side&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>no legitimate outside criteria.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re feeling very vulnerable.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t explain it, but they feel defensive.</p>
<p>And saying, hey, look, I&rsquo;ve given you a fair offer</p>
<p>is a way for me to knock you off your game</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not aware of it.</p>
<p>So a lot of cutthroat negotiations,</p>
<p>negotiators are going to use it on you</p>
<p>to knock you off your game.</p>
<p>The NFL strike probably now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a good 10 years ago.</p>
<p>And maybe even longer than that.</p>
<p>One of the sticking points was the owners</p>
<p>were not opening their books to the players.</p>
<p>Players wanted to see the numbers.</p>
<p>And in order to not open their books,</p>
<p>they just sent a rep to the press conference</p>
<p>saying we&rsquo;ve given players a fair offer.</p>
<p>Well, if it was fair, you&rsquo;d open your books.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you gave them a fair offer</p>
<p>and it was justified by what was in your books,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d open them to prove your point.</p>
<p>So what ends up happening though,</p>
<p>that well, the owners gave the players a fair offer</p>
<p>starts to get picked up in the media.</p>
<p>And then it starts getting repeated.</p>
<p>And now that different people on a player&rsquo;s side</p>
<p>are going like, yeah, maybe they have given us a fair offer.</p>
<p>It caused people to be insecure about their own position.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an enormously powerful word</p>
<p>that can be used and abused.</p>
<p>And it almost always comes up in every negotiation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shocking the number of times it comes up</p>
<p>with people who don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>how or why it&rsquo;s coming up.</p>
<p>So usually it&rsquo;s a signal of a not a good place</p>
<p>in the negotiation.</p>
<p>Without question, I&rsquo;m completely convinced</p>
<p>that if the person is using the word</p>
<p>as a means of getting what they want,</p>
<p>then either accidentally or on purpose,</p>
<p>either in their gut or they know they&rsquo;ve got a bad position</p>
<p>or their gut is afraid that they are.</p>
<p>Do I use the word?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ll say is I want you to feel</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve treated you fairly.</p>
<p>And if any given point in time</p>
<p>you think I&rsquo;m not treating you fairly,</p>
<p>I want you to stop me and we&rsquo;re gonna address it.</p>
<p>Big ridiculous question, but how do you close the deal?</p>
<p>How do you take the negotiation to its end?</p>
<p>Is it implementation ultimately?</p>
<p>You gotta pivot to agreed upon implementation</p>
<p>to really move out of the negotiation.</p>
<p>And I may say, how do you wanna proceed?</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t know, I might say,</p>
<p>no warranted question, is it a ridiculous idea</p>
<p>if I share with you some ideas of how to proceed?</p>
<p>And then you agree on the actual steps</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the implementation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the philosophical agreement,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actual steps.</p>
<p>The big problem in all negotiations</p>
<p>is a lack of discussion of next steps.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s deep.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the best negotiator you&rsquo;ve ever met?</p>
<p>Yeah, actually probably my son, Brandon.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s ridiculously talented.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s ridiculously talented.</p>
<p>And yeah, he&rsquo;s, you know, and what was it,</p>
<p>Coyle&rsquo;s book, The Talent Code,</p>
<p>says that people just noticed it</p>
<p>and started getting good at it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a child prodigy,</p>
<p>just got interested when they were a kid.</p>
<p>I mean, Brandon started learning how to negotiate</p>
<p>when he was two years old.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been in it and immersed in it,</p>
<p>you know, since he could make complete sentences,</p>
<p>even before he could make complete sentences.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ridiculously talented.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his future?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he want to do?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna, he has been involved,</p>
<p>he run and built my company,</p>
<p>and now he&rsquo;s gonna be an affiliated licensee,</p>
<p>run his own operation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pretty much gonna end up doing very much,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna open his entrepreneurial opportunities</p>
<p>to do whatever he wants and not have his dad say no.</p>
<p>And do a better job than his dad.</p>
<p>Most likely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you see some of the techniques</p>
<p>that you talk about as manipulative?</p>
<p>Manipulation is whether or not</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to exploit you or hurt you.</p>
<p>Am I trying to manipulate a bank robber</p>
<p>into letting me save his life?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So manipulation is like, what am I trying to do to you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but you don&rsquo;t see the negative connotation.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to bring a better future,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not manipulation?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m trying to bring a better future,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m being genuine and honest,</p>
<p>like, I compliment you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If my compliment is genuine,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not manipulation.</p>
<p>But if I think,</p>
<p>you got a pair of shoes</p>
<p>that are the dumbest looking things I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>And I go, wow, those are great shoes.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s manipulation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s guys like Warren Buffett</p>
<p>who are big on integrity and honesty.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of lying in effective?</p>
<p>Lying is just a bad idea.</p>
<p>Lying is just a bad idea for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really good chance the other side</p>
<p>is a better liar than you are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna spot it right off the bat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Secondly, they could be luring you into a trap</p>
<p>to see if you will lie.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the chances are they&rsquo;re gonna find out</p>
<p>that you lied to them eventually is really high.</p>
<p>And then the penalties and the taxes</p>
<p>are gonna be way higher than what you had in the first place.</p>
<p>So long-term, you wanna have a reputation</p>
<p>as somebody with integrity.</p>
<p>And the more you lie,</p>
<p>the harder it is to maintain that reputation.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And word&rsquo;s gonna get out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>we can just return to that question.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a good conversation</p>
<p>and a good negotiation?</p>
<p>Can we, because I think just reading your work,</p>
<p>listening to you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense I have that the thing we&rsquo;re doing now</p>
<p>and just conversation on podcasts and so on</p>
<p>is different than negotiation.</p>
<p>It feels like the purpose is different.</p>
<p>And yet having some of the same awareness</p>
<p>of the value of empathy is extremely important.</p>
<p>But it feels like the goals are different.</p>
<p>Or no?</p>
<p>Really close, fine line.</p>
<p>I mean, I ruled in here,</p>
<p>not having any expectations,</p>
<p>not looking for anything</p>
<p>other than to have an interesting conversation.</p>
<p>And to hear what was behind the questions</p>
<p>that you were asking me</p>
<p>and what interests you.</p>
<p>And then also your description of silence</p>
<p>and the power of silence.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;m gonna take away as a learning point</p>
<p>and help learn to teach others.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t come in here,</p>
<p>I suppose a negotiation is when we&rsquo;re both aware</p>
<p>of a problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s no problem in the room.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Just to solve.</p>
<p>Except maybe like the human condition and.</p>
<p>Insight, you know, wisdom.</p>
<p>Insight.</p>
<p>Learning.</p>
<p>How do you train to become better at negotiating?</p>
<p>In business, in life?</p>
<p>Yeah, just small stakes practice for high stakes results.</p>
<p>I mean, decide what kind of negotiating resonates with you.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean, small stakes practice for high stakes</p>
<p>or small stakes?</p>
<p>So small, little, incremental,</p>
<p>like picking up girls at a bar?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>Well, it can be.</p>
<p>For some people, that&rsquo;s high stakes practice.</p>
<p>Well, you know, labeling mirrors.</p>
<p>What are the basic tools of great negotiation?</p>
<p>Labeling, mirroring, paraphrasing, summarizing.</p>
<p>So you start labeling and mirroring people</p>
<p>that you just have regular interactions with</p>
<p>just to gain a feel for whether or not</p>
<p>you can read somebody&rsquo;s affect</p>
<p>or how accurate your read is to get better at it.</p>
<p>And so, you know, label the Lyft driver</p>
<p>or the grocery store clerk</p>
<p>or the person behind the airline counter at the airport.</p>
<p>So putting a label on their affect.</p>
<p>Or throwing something at them that,</p>
<p>because negotiation is a perishable skill.</p>
<p>Emotional intelligence is perishable.</p>
<p>So seeing if you can indicate</p>
<p>that you understand their label.</p>
<p>One of my favorite labels to throw out on somebody,</p>
<p>which, you know, maybe re-level,</p>
<p>I might look at somebody who looks distressed</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go, tough day?</p>
<p>So several years ago, I&rsquo;m at the counter at LAX.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m waiting in line to get to the counter.</p>
<p>And the lady behind the counter</p>
<p>is clearly making it a point to not meet my eyes</p>
<p>so that I don&rsquo;t approach.</p>
<p>And she looks, and so, like,</p>
<p>you know when you&rsquo;re next in line</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re making sure that you don&rsquo;t meet eyes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking to myself,</p>
<p>all right, so they&rsquo;re having a bad day.</p>
<p>So I walk up and as soon as I approach the counter,</p>
<p>I go, tough day?</p>
<p>And she kind of snaps around.</p>
<p>And she goes, no, no, no, how can I help you?</p>
<p>And goes out of her way to help me.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m practicing, but I also know it made her feel better.</p>
<p>It relieved some of the stress.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m going through TSA.</p>
<p>Want to look for people who are having a tough day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good place to find them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good place to find them, practice.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m rolling through the line</p>
<p>and I realize I haven&rsquo;t tossed a label out</p>
<p>on any one of these guys.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this guy watching the bags</p>
<p>come out of the x-ray machine.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just kind of got an indifferent look on his face.</p>
<p>And I go, tough day?</p>
<p>And he kind of goes, I can see from his body language,</p>
<p>like, no.</p>
<p>And I go, just another day, huh?</p>
<p>And he goes, yeah, just another day.</p>
<p>You know, he felt seen.</p>
<p>But I missed, and I&rsquo;m practicing.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to stay sharp.</p>
<p>So these are the small-</p>
<p>Just a few words.</p>
<p>With just a few words, you&rsquo;re trying to like,</p>
<p>quickly localize the effect.</p>
<p>And put a label on it.</p>
<p>Very, very, very analytically said.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not letting it go.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Does the same apply to just conversation in general?</p>
<p>Just how to get better at conversation?</p>
<p>I think a lot of people struggle.</p>
<p>They have insecurities,</p>
<p>they have anxiety about conversation.</p>
<p>As funny as this is to say,</p>
<p>I have a lot of anxiety about conversation.</p>
<p>Is that, you basically do the same kind of practice,</p>
<p>practice some of the techniques in your book?</p>
<p>Yeah, genuinely.</p>
<p>Just trying to make sure you heard somebody out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best conversation you&rsquo;ve ever been in?</p>
<p>Except this one, of course.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>What, I mean, not the best conversation,</p>
<p>but what stands out to you?</p>
<p>As conversation that changed you as a person, maybe?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s probably been a lot of them along the way.</p>
<p>I mean, but one that I remember on a regular basis,</p>
<p>actually there&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p>But when I was in the Bureau, I&rsquo;m at Quantico,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m there for an in-service.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another guy from New York,</p>
<p>a buddy of mine named Lionel.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re both trying to decide whether or not</p>
<p>we want to be, try to get into profiling or negotiation.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re both about human dynamics,</p>
<p>and both of us really like human dynamics.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re sitting around talking about it,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about several things,</p>
<p>and he labels me.</p>
<p>And I knew he didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing.</p>
<p>I think he was just, he had picked it up.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d been talking about my family quite a few things.</p>
<p>And he said to me, and I never said this directly,</p>
<p>that we were close.</p>
<p>But he said to me,</p>
<p>it sounds like your family&rsquo;s really close.</p>
<p>And I can remember in a moment, like this feeling,</p>
<p>just like I felt great in the moment.</p>
<p>I mean, what he said just drew together</p>
<p>everything that I&rsquo;d been saying,</p>
<p>and nailed the essence of it.</p>
<p>And I have a very clear recollection</p>
<p>of how good that felt in a moment.</p>
<p>So a couple years later, I&rsquo;m on a suicide hotline.</p>
<p>Now I got this line in the back of my head.</p>
<p>You know, line, technique, reaction, read,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>Guy calls in on a hotline,</p>
<p>and I could tell the dude is rattled by his tone of voice.</p>
<p>I mean, just amped up.</p>
<p>And he goes, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to put a lid on the day.</p>
<p>I need your help putting a lid on the day.</p>
<p>I gotta put a lid on the day.</p>
<p>And I go, you sound anxious.</p>
<p>And he goes, yeah.</p>
<p>And it came down a little bit.</p>
<p>And it was a guy that was telling me about,</p>
<p>he was battling a disease of paranoia.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s gonna go on a car trip</p>
<p>with his family the next day.</p>
<p>And he knew that on the car trip,</p>
<p>he was gonna twist himself into knots.</p>
<p>And so the night before, he&rsquo;s twisting himself into knots.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s laying out everything that he&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>to try to beat paranoia</p>
<p>and how much his family&rsquo;s helping him.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s going on a car trip with the family</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna take him to see a doctor.</p>
<p>And so I hit him with the same thing</p>
<p>that my buddy Lionel said.</p>
<p>I said, it sounds like your family&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>He goes, yeah, we are close.</p>
<p>And he leveled out a little bit more.</p>
<p>And then he started ticking off all the things</p>
<p>that he was doing to try to beat paranoia.</p>
<p>And he sounded determined.</p>
<p>And so I said, you sound determined.</p>
<p>And he goes, yeah, I am determined.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be fine tomorrow, thanks.</p>
<p>And that was all I said.</p>
<p>So those two conversations,</p>
<p>which are overlapping conversations,</p>
<p>those two things really stick out in my mind.</p>
<p>Do those things, through all the different negotiations</p>
<p>and conversations you&rsquo;ve had,</p>
<p>do they kind of echo throughout?</p>
<p>Like you basically&hellip;</p>
<p>Because when you empathize with other human beings,</p>
<p>you start to realize we&rsquo;re all the same.</p>
<p>And so you can start to pick little phrases here and there</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve heard from others, little experiences.</p>
<p>They were all about,</p>
<p>like we all want to be close with other human beings.</p>
<p>We all want love.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re all deeply lonely inside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for connection.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, if we&rsquo;re honest about it.</p>
<p>And so all humans have that same,</p>
<p>all the same different components of,</p>
<p>well, it makes them tick.</p>
<p>So do you kind of see yourself basically</p>
<p>just saying the same things</p>
<p>to connect with another human being?</p>
<p>Yeah, there aren&rsquo;t that many different things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re looking for understanding on,</p>
<p>or connection on, or satisfaction of.</p>
<p>There just aren&rsquo;t that many of them, regardless.</p>
<p>And so yeah, you&rsquo;re looking for it to manifest itself</p>
<p>in some form or another.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re willing to take a guess on whether or not</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re seeing or hearing.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to me</p>
<p>to be better at these conversations?</p>
<p>To me and to other people that do kind of interviews</p>
<p>and podcasts and so on.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Because I really care about empathy as well.</p>
<p>Is there a kind of,</p>
<p>as a lifelong journey in this process?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I would advise you to take that approach,</p>
<p>which is the approach that you&rsquo;re taking.</p>
<p>You care about it, you&rsquo;re very curious about it.</p>
<p>You see it as a lifelong journey.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fascinated by it.</p>
<p>You enjoy learning about it.</p>
<p>And you definitely do see it as a lifelong journey,</p>
<p>as opposed to, this is what I can,</p>
<p>if I can acquire this, then I can manipulate people.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I fall in love with people I talk to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of deep connection,</p>
<p>and it lingers with you,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m preparing.</p>
<p>The more material there is in a person,</p>
<p>the more you get to fall in love with them ahead of time.</p>
<p>You get to really understand, not understand,</p>
<p>but what I mean by fall in love is-</p>
<p>Well, appreciate, huh?</p>
<p>Appreciate, but also become deeply curious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean by fall in love.</p>
<p>You appreciate the things you know,</p>
<p>but you start to see, like Alice in Wonderland,</p>
<p>you start to see that there&rsquo;s all this cool stuff</p>
<p>you can learn if you keep interacting with them.</p>
<p>And then when you show up and you actually meet,</p>
<p>you realize, it&rsquo;s like more and more and more and more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like in physics, the more you learn,</p>
<p>the more you realize you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>And then it can also be heartbreaking</p>
<p>because you have to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Goodbye, I hate goodbyes.</p>
<p>I hate goodbyes.</p>
<p>Seems terminal, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, it reminds me that I&rsquo;m gonna die one day.</p>
<p>Like things end, good things end, it sucks.</p>
<p>But then it makes the moment more delicious, you know,</p>
<p>that you do get to spend together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, I just wanna, I completely forgot,</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you about this, the 738 55% rule.</p>
<p>This is really interesting.</p>
<p>Does this, is there at all truth to it?</p>
<p>That 7% of a message is conveyed from the words used,</p>
<p>38% from the tone of voice, and 55% from body language.</p>
<p>Is there really truth to that?</p>
<p>All right, so Albert Mehrabian,</p>
<p>I think is the name of the UCLA professor</p>
<p>that originally proposed the 738 55 ratio</p>
<p>and discussed it in terms of that it wasn&rsquo;t the message,</p>
<p>but how much, he called it liking.</p>
<p>Like, are you, not that you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the meaning is coming across,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re liking of the message.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been extrapolated heavily by people like me</p>
<p>to this meaning of the meaning in 738 55,</p>
<p>from liking to the meaning.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve seen regularly is people that communicate</p>
<p>verbally, if their speakers, Tony Robbins, 738 55 guy,</p>
<p>he throws the ratio out there.</p>
<p>Go, that&rsquo;s it exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly how the message comes across.</p>
<p>This is how we gotta balance it.</p>
<p>This is how we gotta do it.</p>
<p>Those that communicate principally in writing,</p>
<p>the meaning of the words are much more important to them.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re deeply uncomfortable with seven being the words.</p>
<p>Because the content, the words, the meaning of the words,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re writing, it&rsquo;s so important</p>
<p>that you hate to poo-poo it that way.</p>
<p>So I, first of all, I 1000% believe it&rsquo;s an accurate ratio,</p>
<p>but the real critical issue is,</p>
<p>not what the ratio of those three things are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the message when they&rsquo;re out of line?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the message when the tone of voice</p>
<p>is out of line with the words?</p>
<p>Like it don&rsquo;t matter what your ratio is.</p>
<p>You got a problem if their tone does not match their words.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard to really put a measure on exactly.</p>
<p>Even in writing, there&rsquo;s a tone.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not just, even in writing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the words.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the words, but there&rsquo;s like a style</p>
<p>underneath the whole thing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something like body language,</p>
<p>the presentation of the whole thing.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, I&rsquo;m a big fan</p>
<p>of constraint mediums of communication,</p>
<p>which writing is, or voice, like Clubhouse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a personality to a human being</p>
<p>when you just hear their voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, you could say it&rsquo;s the tone of voice,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s like, you can like, what is it?</p>
<p>The imagination fills in the rest.</p>
<p>Like when I&rsquo;m listening to somebody,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m imagining some amorphous being, right,</p>
<p>doing things.</p>
<p>When they get angry, I&rsquo;m imagining anger.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what exactly I&rsquo;m visualizing.</p>
<p>Well, and so you may be thinking of a funny story,</p>
<p>because we were talking about your buddy, Elon, before.</p>
<p>And I told you about that I&rsquo;d interacted</p>
<p>with some of the senior executives.</p>
<p>So I know that they love working with him,</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s an interesting guy,</p>
<p>and they realize that he can be funny,</p>
<p>and he jokes around.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re telling me,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on this conference call, just words,</p>
<p>and a guy on the other end of the line</p>
<p>says something that was wrong, but wasn&rsquo;t bad.</p>
<p>And so they said, they&rsquo;re on a phone,</p>
<p>and Elon goes, you&rsquo;re fired.</p>
<p>And then everybody in the room with him</p>
<p>can see that he&rsquo;s joking.</p>
<p>But the person on the other side can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and they all go, wait, wait, wait, wait,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t see your look on your face right now.</p>
<p>You gotta stop, you gotta stop,</p>
<p>because the guy on the other side is dying right now.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re joking.</p>
<p>So there was, you know, there were the words</p>
<p>and the tone of voice,</p>
<p>but it lacked the visual to go with it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was probably funny.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it was very funny at the time.</p>
<p>Maybe not to him.</p>
<p>Just as an interesting task,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re following along</p>
<p>the developments of large language models,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been something called Chad GPT.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just more and more sophisticated</p>
<p>and effective and impressive chatbots, essentially,</p>
<p>that can talk.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re becoming more and more human-like.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible in the future</p>
<p>that AI will be able to be better negotiators than humans?</p>
<p>Do you think about that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Well, so definition of better versus less flawed.</p>
<p>Like, you know, chatbots have been out there for a long time</p>
<p>and probably about five years ago now,</p>
<p>a company approached us</p>
<p>because they were doing a negotiation chatbot.</p>
<p>And they said two things.</p>
<p>First of all, I said, you know, why are you talking to us?</p>
<p>Said, well, in point of fact,</p>
<p>we already spoke to the people that are teaching,</p>
<p>quote, the Harvard methodology.</p>
<p>And, you know, the rational approach to negotiation</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Rational approach just does not work.</p>
<p>Our chatbots are not getting anywhere.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re showing in around about 80% of the interactions</p>
<p>a higher success outcome with these chatbots.</p>
<p>And they showed me what they were doing.</p>
<p>And it was still a lot deeply flawed</p>
<p>emotional intelligence-wise.</p>
<p>But the reason why that they were having</p>
<p>higher success rates is the chatbots</p>
<p>were never in a bad mood.</p>
<p>And you could reach out for a chatbot</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>So if you were talking to somebody that was never upset</p>
<p>and was always available,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna have a higher success rate.</p>
<p>Negotiations go bad when people</p>
<p>are in a negative frame of mind.</p>
<p>So the natural ability of a chatbot to be positive</p>
<p>is just going to give you a higher success rate.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;re not gonna get mad and argue with you.</p>
<p>You know, you say to a chatbot,</p>
<p>you know, your price is too high.</p>
<p>Chatbot is designed to come back with a smiley face.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You say to a person, your price is too high.</p>
<p>They go, how dare you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to make a living.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re gonna go off the deep end.</p>
<p>Unfortunately or fortunately,</p>
<p>I think the way chatbots are going now,</p>
<p>they will come back negative</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re becoming more and more human-like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>To be able to pass the Turing test,</p>
<p>you have to be negative.</p>
<p>You have to be an asshole.</p>
<p>You have to have boundaries.</p>
<p>You have to be insecure.</p>
<p>You have to have some uncertainty.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the difference between having boundaries</p>
<p>and being negative.</p>
<p>Like I can, you threw a proposal to me.</p>
<p>You know, before I say no,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say, look, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>That just doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna set up a real clear boundary</p>
<p>without being negative.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So, and a lot of people really struggle</p>
<p>with setting boundaries without being negative,</p>
<p>without name-calling, without indignation,</p>
<p>without getting upset.</p>
<p>But see, there&rsquo;s a, when you are,</p>
<p>when you show that you&rsquo;re not getting upset,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just seeing that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a flawed human</p>
<p>that has underneath it a temper,</p>
<p>underneath it the ability to get upset,</p>
<p>but chooses not to get upset.</p>
<p>And a chatbot has to demonstrate that.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not just going to be cold</p>
<p>and, you know, be this kind of corporate,</p>
<p>blank, empty, sort of like vapid creature</p>
<p>that just says, oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for saying that.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s basically, you have to,</p>
<p>the chatbot has to be able to be mean</p>
<p>and choose not to be.</p>
<p>Interesting, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to see that play out</p>
<p>and see how it plays out.</p>
<p>But I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is to be a good negotiator,</p>
<p>you have to have the capacity to be a bad person</p>
<p>and choose not to.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>See, I think you just gotta have the capacity</p>
<p>to set a boundary and stick to it.</p>
<p>Interesting, because I think it&rsquo;s hard for me</p>
<p>to trust a person who&rsquo;s not aware of their own demons.</p>
<p>Because if you say you don&rsquo;t have any demons,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t have any flaws, I can&rsquo;t trust you.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, first of all, it&rsquo;s a lie, right?</p>
<p>So, somebody&rsquo;s lying.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back to lying.</p>
<p>Yes, so you have to have a self-awareness about that.</p>
<p>But to be able to control it,</p>
<p>demonstrate to be able to control it.</p>
<p>I mean, this is humans.</p>
<p>I just think humans, intelligent, effective humans,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able to do this well.</p>
<p>And chatbots are not yet.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re moving in that direction.</p>
<p>So, it makes me think about what is actually required</p>
<p>for effective negotiation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what AI systems do, is they make you ask yourself,</p>
<p>what is it that makes humans special in any discipline?</p>
<p>What is it that makes humans special at chess and Go games,</p>
<p>which AI systems are able to beat humans at now?</p>
<p>What is it that makes them effective at negotiation?</p>
<p>What does it make them effective at</p>
<p>at something that&rsquo;s extremely difficult,</p>
<p>which is navigating physical spaces?</p>
<p>So, doing things that we take for granted,</p>
<p>like making yourself a cup of coffee,</p>
<p>is exceptionally difficult problem for robots.</p>
<p>Because of all the complexities involved</p>
<p>in navigating physical reality.</p>
<p>We have so much common sense reasoning built in,</p>
<p>just about how gravity works,</p>
<p>about how objects move,</p>
<p>what kind of objects there are in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really difficult to describe,</p>
<p>because it all seems so damn trivial, but it&rsquo;s not trivial.</p>
<p>Because a lot of that we just learn as babies.</p>
<p>We keep running into things, and we&rsquo;ll learn about that.</p>
<p>And so, AI systems help us understand,</p>
<p>what is it that makes humans really,</p>
<p>what is the wisdom we have in our heads?</p>
<p>And negotiation, to me, is super interesting.</p>
<p>Because negotiation is not, it&rsquo;s about business,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about geopolitics, it&rsquo;s about running government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically negotiating, how do we,</p>
<p>the different policies, different bills,</p>
<p>and programs, and so on.</p>
<p>How do we allocate money?</p>
<p>How do we reallocate resources?</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That seems like AI, in the future, could be better at that.</p>
<p>But maybe not.</p>
<p>Maybe you have to be a messy, weird,</p>
<p>insecure, uncertain human,</p>
<p>and debate each other, and yell at each other on Twitter.</p>
<p>Maybe you have to have the red and the blue teams</p>
<p>that yell at each other,</p>
<p>in the process of figuring out what is true.</p>
<p>Maybe AI systems will not be able to do that,</p>
<p>and figure out the full mess of human civilization.</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the two thoughts that I had along the way was,</p>
<p>I mean, anytime you&rsquo;re talking about systems or scaling,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re talking, my belief is chatbots, systems,</p>
<p>things that don&rsquo;t require decision-making,</p>
<p>just following the instructions,</p>
<p>at least 80% of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Now, the remaining percentage, whatever it is,</p>
<p>does it require the human interaction, and what&rsquo;s required?</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m not like, I am not pro-conflict,</p>
<p>and I also know that there&rsquo;s a case to be made</p>
<p>in the creative world,</p>
<p>that some of the best thinking came out of conflict.</p>
<p>Reading interviews of Bono, you too.</p>
<p>You know, their admiration for some of the Beatles'</p>
<p>best music came when they were fighting with each other.</p>
<p>And the song One, which is, I believe,</p>
<p>from the album Octoon Baby.</p>
<p>Those guys were fighting.</p>
<p>I mean, they were on the verge of breaking up.</p>
<p>And their appreciation that conflict</p>
<p>could create something beautiful.</p>
<p>And then when I was in the crisis negotiation unit,</p>
<p>you know, my last seven years in the FBI,</p>
<p>there was a guy named Vince, brilliant dude,</p>
<p>brilliant, brilliant negotiator.</p>
<p>And he and I used to argue all the time.</p>
<p>And then when we had a change in the guy who was in charge,</p>
<p>the guy who was in charge took me off to the side,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, you know, I can&rsquo;t take you</p>
<p>and Vince fighting all the time.</p>
<p>And I said, well, I got news for you.</p>
<p>I think we come up with much better stuff</p>
<p>as a result of our battles.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, Vince said the same thing to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, so if we don&rsquo;t have a problem fighting,</p>
<p>why do you have a problem?</p>
<p>But, you know, there is something there</p>
<p>that sometimes the most difficult insights,</p>
<p>you rack your brains as to why someone is so dug in</p>
<p>on something that you think is so wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe there&rsquo;s something to it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something to it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about conflict, even drama,</p>
<p>that might be a feature, not a bug of our society.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Do you think there will always be war in the world?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there will always be a need for negotiators</p>
<p>and negotiating.</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why do you think there will always be war?</p>
<p>Is it, what&rsquo;s your intuition about human nature there?</p>
<p>Yeah, just because we&rsquo;re basically 75% negative.</p>
<p>And then, for lack of a better term,</p>
<p>I call it two lines of code.</p>
<p>Like somewhere when you, everybody, when we were little,</p>
<p>somebody planted in two lines into our head.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know when it got in there.</p>
<p>But somebody said something to us that stuck.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of people</p>
<p>that had some really negative garbage dumped in their brain</p>
<p>when they were little.</p>
<p>And just based on the numbers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What kind of opportunity they were given afterwards.</p>
<p>Did they ever have an epiphany moment</p>
<p>when they genuinely believed</p>
<p>they can get themselves out of it?</p>
<p>Like what is it, one of Joe Dispenza&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>is Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, like how do you get at that two lines of code</p>
<p>that either mean or well-intentioned,</p>
<p>but stupidly speaking, adults said to you</p>
<p>at the wrong moment and planted in your brain?</p>
<p>Like how, the chances of everybody on Earth</p>
<p>getting that out, even a majority of people on Earth</p>
<p>getting that out of their heads is really small.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today</p>
<p>about how to have a career</p>
<p>they could be proud of or a life?</p>
<p>Maybe somebody in high school, college,</p>
<p>trying to figure out their way in this world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a take on a cliche of do what you love.</p>
<p>But if you figure out your ideals</p>
<p>and pursue your ideals</p>
<p>and stick to them when it costs you.</p>
<p>Like a guy I admire very much, Michael McGill,</p>
<p>runs this Operation Crisp video in Atlanta.</p>
<p>In one of his talks, he would say,</p>
<p>core values are what you stick to that costs you money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a value that really matters to you</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s costing you.</p>
<p>And stick to your values.</p>
<p>Now, when I was in the FBI, I worked really hard at,</p>
<p>you know, the number one core mission of the FBI</p>
<p>is to protect and defend the American people.</p>
<p>So I could pursue that value at all times, which I did,</p>
<p>or I could follow the rules.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have time to do both.</p>
<p>When did you know you found what you love?</p>
<p>When did you fall in love with whatever this process is</p>
<p>that is negotiating?</p>
<p>I think it was in a conversation on the suicide hotline</p>
<p>that I was telling you about earlier</p>
<p>with the guy who was paranoid.</p>
<p>When I thought, I can have that significant of an impact</p>
<p>on another human being in this short of a period of time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
<p>How hard is it to talk somebody off the ledge?</p>
<p>So this question, this is a big question.</p>
<p>Why the hell live at all?</p>
<p>How do you have that kind of deeply philosophical,</p>
<p>deeply psychological, and also practical conversation</p>
<p>with somebody and convince them they should stick around?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s more clearing the clutter in their head</p>
<p>and let them make up their own mind.</p>
<p>That was what volunteering on a suicide hotline</p>
<p>was really about.</p>
<p>Just let me see how quickly I can clear out</p>
<p>the clutter in your head,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re willing to have it cleared out.</p>
<p>Did you call here,</p>
<p>because you were actually looking for help,</p>
<p>or did you call here to fulfill some other agenda?</p>
<p>So are you willing to clear the clutter in your head?</p>
<p>Not everybody is.</p>
<p>So once you clear out the clutter,</p>
<p>is it at least a somewhat hopeful chance</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll continue for another day?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like, if you step back,</p>
<p>like very few people that commit suicide</p>
<p>physically are up against it that hard.</p>
<p>Like most of them, by and large,</p>
<p>are pretty intact, physically human beings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re struggling with emotional stuff.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an emotional issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a physical issue.</p>
<p>So if you were to be a complete mercenary,</p>
<p>like a guy I&rsquo;m a very big fan of,</p>
<p>a guy named Mark Pollack, a born great athlete,</p>
<p>lost his eyesight and then became paralyzed.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s an emotional leader.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s about helping people thrive and live great lives.</p>
<p>Like Mark was born, he was a spectacular athlete.</p>
<p>And first he lost his sight in one eye,</p>
<p>then he lost his sight in the other eye,</p>
<p>and then he fell out a window in a tragic experience.</p>
<p>Like if there was ever a dude that was saying,</p>
<p>like, living sucks.</p>
<p>You know, and if there&rsquo;s any doubt in my mind,</p>
<p>something worse happens to me every few years.</p>
<p>But Mark&rsquo;s about being alive and inspiring other people.</p>
<p>So the hard part with navigating</p>
<p>with somebody who&rsquo;s tossing it in</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a chemical imbalance</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;re interpreting the world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clutter in their head.</p>
<p>Like can you help clear that clutter in their head?</p>
<p>And help them by themselves,</p>
<p>inspire them to reinterpret that world</p>
<p>as one worth living in.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life, Bruce Walsh?</p>
<p>Why live?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good reason?</p>
<p>Well, I have very strong religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Spiritual.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t, 1,000%.</p>
<p>If you were to try to confine me in a box,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be a Christian.</p>
<p>I have tremendous respect for the Jewish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any religion&rsquo;s got it nailed, exactly.</p>
<p>Again, I keep mentioning, I&rsquo;m kind of a Bono Christian.</p>
<p>I think Bono is like what,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna butcher it,</p>
<p>but my belief in Jesus is what I&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>after Christianity leaves a room.</p>
<p>You know, the dogma of man&rsquo;s application</p>
<p>of spiritual beliefs.</p>
<p>So, but that being said, I truly believe</p>
<p>that my life was a gift and there&rsquo;s a purpose here,</p>
<p>and for my creator decided that I woke up in the morning</p>
<p>because he still had some cool,</p>
<p>interesting things for me to do.</p>
<p>And you have gratitude for having the opportunity</p>
<p>to live that day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you do one heck of a good job</p>
<p>at living those days.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your work.</p>
<p>I appreciate the person you are.</p>
<p>Thank you for just everything you&rsquo;ve done today</p>
<p>for just being empathic, honestly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a great listener.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a great conversationalist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just an honor to meet you and to talk to you.</p>
<p>This was really awesome, Chris.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Chris Voss.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>Let us never negotiate out of fear,</p>
<p>but let us never fear to negotiate.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
