    <p>So are we supposed to start the podcast?</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Better.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s been a year.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>You went to the Grand Caymans.</p>
<p>You went to Paris and London.</p>
<p>Paris and London.</p>
<p>And we were separated for like eight days.</p>
<p>I was very, very sad.</p>
<p>I think I did text you halfway through and I was like, I&rsquo;m embarrassed to tell you that</p>
<p>I miss you.</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>You texted me on like day four and it was really sweet.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It warmed my cold black heart like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>Cold black heart.</p>
<p>So Pumps, what have you had it with?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve had it with, Jennifer, is universal and that is personal space invaders.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand as an adult, particularly if you&rsquo;re married and or have children, how</p>
<p>that continues to be a problem.</p>
<p>Because my children, if I were in people&rsquo;s faces like that, would tell me, back the fuck</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Like get back.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re too close.</p>
<p>But I have people that like, as I start moving back-</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of confused.</p>
<p>Are you talking about your children invading your personal space?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying like as somebody that has a child, if I were a personal space invader, they would</p>
<p>shoo my ass.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s one in particular that I&rsquo;m thinking of that, I mean, I have backed up</p>
<p>and backed up and she keeps coming and she keeps coming and I&rsquo;m like backed up against</p>
<p>the wall.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I just want to throw my hands up and be like, I surrender.</p>
<p>Like get out of my face.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand how people can not realize their personal space invaders, especially</p>
<p>if the person you&rsquo;re talking to keeps backing up.</p>
<p>I mean, subtly, but you&rsquo;re backed up and then all of a sudden I&rsquo;m up against a wall and</p>
<p>I mean, we could French kiss, we&rsquo;re so close.</p>
<p>It drives me crazy.</p>
<p>And in fact, when I see this person, I like try to hide.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s like for the personal space invader, it&rsquo;s like the self-fulfilling</p>
<p>prophecy that they have that nobody wants to be around them.</p>
<p>And then they start inching closer, inching closer, and then they make it come true.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because they manifest it.</p>
<p>They manifest it because I have people that are around me from time to time in business</p>
<p>that are total personal space invaders.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the biggest offender of all, personal space invader plus chronic halitosis.</p>
<p>That is the worst.</p>
<p>These people are the worst.</p>
<p>It is so bad and everybody in the world knows this.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, again, why isn&rsquo;t somebody close to them telling them, A, you have chronic</p>
<p>halitosis.</p>
<p>Chew gum, get a mint.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very good about asking people if we&rsquo;re in close quarters, like if we&rsquo;re in a car</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re traveling and we&rsquo;re talking, like, oh my God, is my breath bad?</p>
<p>Just tell me and I&rsquo;ll put a mint in or something.</p>
<p>So the people with the chronic halitosis, again, why aren&rsquo;t the people that live with</p>
<p>them, their nearest and dearest, i.e. kids, husbands, wives, telling them?</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;ve just given up.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s like, you know.</p>
<p>Do you think Roman Welch would give up on you if you were in people&rsquo;s faces everywhere</p>
<p>he went with your horrible breath?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying you have horrible breath.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that I think sometimes some people are so set in their ways that you get</p>
<p>to a point where you just throw your hands up in the air and it&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t fix this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a prime example.</p>
<p>Josh Welch talking about his hair 24-7, 365.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t make him stop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried very ‚Äì I&rsquo;m like, okay, you got a haircut.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>When we were in Paris, he got his haircut.</p>
<p>We had to hear about it building up to the haircut, after the haircut, and at least three</p>
<p>to five times per day post haircut for the remainder of our vacation.</p>
<p>So I have just given up on this.</p>
<p>But wouldn&rsquo;t you think that like if you had bad breath ‚Äì</p>
<p>Logically, yes, but they&rsquo;re still out there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m offering a ‚Äì I guess it just defies logic.</p>
<p>It defies logic.</p>
<p>I agree with 100% of everything you say.</p>
<p>I think these people, the chronic halitosis personal space invaders, should not be allowed</p>
<p>to leave the house.</p>
<p>Yet they are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re leaving, and you&rsquo;ve got some gal backing you up to a wall that&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>French kiss you.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s telling her to stay at home.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t understand a lot of what goes on with the general public, which is why I have</p>
<p>become more and more agoraphobic as my life has gone on.</p>
<p>But the personal space invaders plus chronic halitosis and then, you know, like sometimes</p>
<p>somebody has like a booger.</p>
<p>I always tell when people have boogers.</p>
<p>You do.</p>
<p>You always tell people.</p>
<p>I always tell if people&rsquo;s pants are unzipped.</p>
<p>They have food in their teeth.</p>
<p>Like even if I don&rsquo;t know them, I&rsquo;m like, hey, girlfriend, food in your teeth.</p>
<p>I just think that that&rsquo;s being a good person.</p>
<p>The person that lets you run around with lipstick on your teeth or your fly unzipped, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a good person.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never ever tell you one time I was at DHS or juvenile court, which I don&rsquo;t practice</p>
<p>in juvenile court very much.</p>
<p>And I have no idea what&rsquo;s going on because everybody that&rsquo;s there like works in the building.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rarity for like a private attorney to be out there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m out there prancing around like, you know, the princess of the legal community.</p>
<p>And the clerk, the judge goes off the bench for a minute and the clerk comes, says, Ms.</p>
<p>Sullivan, can I see you in the back?</p>
<p>And I was like, oh God, I fucked something up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done something wrong.</p>
<p>Like what is going on?</p>
<p>So I go back there and she goes, your fly is unzipped.</p>
<p>Which thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That was a thank you.</p>
<p>That was a public service.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That was really helpful.</p>
<p>So I think the question is, what do we do moving forward?</p>
<p>I think what we could make a pact to do, you, me, Kylie, and the listener, is when somebody</p>
<p>is personal space invading, is immediately say, stop invading my personal space.</p>
<p>And if you have a personal space invader plus chronic halitosis, you can double down on</p>
<p>that and say, you need to back up and you need to go scrape your tongue, brush your</p>
<p>teeth, rinse with Listerine, visit the dentist, and then circle back with me.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll be happy to hear what you have to say.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So maybe we just need to be more blunt.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re not blunt enough.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would never say, oh, my God, you&rsquo;re in my space and your breath is terrible.</p>
<p>I just wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But you just said that you tell anybody if they have something in their mouth, something</p>
<p>in their teeth, something.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know why I don&rsquo;t tell the personal space invader, like, just take a step back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give it some thought.</p>
<p>But I do want to circle back to something you were talking about, the Josh Welts incessant</p>
<p>talking about his haircut.</p>
<p>What are the tips that you use to kind of get that conversation out of the everyday</p>
<p>mainstream?</p>
<p>I completely ignore it.</p>
<p>I mean, I complete he starts talking about his hair and I just completely act like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not speaking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feed it at all.</p>
<p>I just completely ignore it.</p>
<p>And he even went as far as to suggest that the haircuts in New York or in Paris are so</p>
<p>superior to those in Oklahoma City that he&rsquo;s giving strong consideration to flying to New</p>
<p>York once every four to six weeks to get a haircut.</p>
<p>To which my 20-year-old son Dylan said, dad, that is the dumbest, most impractical thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever heard in my life.</p>
<p>Well, I think that I appreciate what Dylan said, but what really should have been said</p>
<p>is you are the biggest fucking entitled brat.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever say that out loud again, ever.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever say it out loud.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Well, okay, Kylie.</p>
<p>So now we have some tips on the pickleball.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just, when the pickleball conversation, Kyle and I are just going to look at each</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just going to act like you&rsquo;re not here.</p>
<p>Do you want to hear what I&rsquo;ve had it with?</p>
<p>I would love to hear what you&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>So the entire eight days that I was in Europe, I paid a lot of attention to the Europeans.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>To the Parisians and the Londoners.</p>
<p>And there was one thing that I never saw, not one time.</p>
<p>And I took the tube, I walked the streets, I did public transportation.</p>
<p>I was out amongst the people all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a much better traveler than I am day-to-day liver in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>There was one thing I never noticed, not one time.</p>
<p>I think I know what it is.</p>
<p>Can I get to guess?</p>
<p>Do I get to guess?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There is an oversized beverage that you do not see.</p>
<p>These beverages that you schlep around with you everywhere you go, they don&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>You go to a restaurant and if you happen to drink sugary drinks, like a Coke, you get</p>
<p>a small bottle and a glass and there&rsquo;s no free refill.</p>
<p>Nobody schlepping around these big giant water bottle caps.</p>
<p>And they walk everywhere.</p>
<p>They walk a million times more than we do.</p>
<p>They walk everywhere.</p>
<p>Are you sure no one had a Stanley cap?</p>
<p>Not one fucking person.</p>
<p>I am 100% positive about it.</p>
<p>As I started the story, I paid rock solid attention to those around me and I was looking</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>Nobody walks around with beverages.</p>
<p>Well, you know, that&rsquo;s interesting because when we were in Grand Cayman, I too noticed</p>
<p>that nobody like served big drinks.</p>
<p>You had to ask for a refill, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But you will be happy to learn that the four girlfriends that I went with, we all took</p>
<p>our Stanley caps with us so that we were able to still enjoy our oversized beverages.</p>
<p>So y&rsquo;all like took your beverages down there with you and then you took them everywhere</p>
<p>with you on the trip?</p>
<p>I think I was the only one that took it everywhere with me.</p>
<p>But when we would go down to the beach, we all loaded up our Stanleys.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to tell you this.</p>
<p>It will be a cold fucking day in hell before I ever am caught dead with a Stanley cap.</p>
<p>It really fucking chaps my hide that you have found a posse that enables this egregious</p>
<p>consumption of yours.</p>
<p>It is to everybody that went to the Grand Cayman with pumps, go eat a bag of dicks because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s enabling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessary to drink that much 24-7 nonstop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it, had it, had it, had it.</p>
<p>And as you well know, I take all of my supplies for my tea on all trips.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m abundantly aware.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m abundantly a listener.</p>
<p>When we travel, we go to Mexico every Thanksgiving together, the minute we check into the hotel</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>The minute in our hotel room, this is like a house that we rent and it has a kitchen.</p>
<p>She is down there, I mean, just ravaging through the cabinets, finding things to make this</p>
<p>tea and then she has to make the tea and then she refrigerates part of it.</p>
<p>It is so disturbing that you cannot even like just go in and like enjoy the room for a second,</p>
<p>look at the view, look at the swimming pool, kind of look at your bedroom and have a little</p>
<p>conversation.</p>
<p>It is like this fix, like a crackhead that has walked in the Sahara Desert for 500 miles</p>
<p>that just bumped into their crack dealer.</p>
<p>That is what it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>So the fact that you are traveling with others like you, number one, is disturbing, but number</p>
<p>two shows you what an integral part I play in your life to not-</p>
<p>To stand up against the over drinking.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>That at least there&rsquo;s somebody in your life that says you don&rsquo;t need to consume so much</p>
<p>all the goddamn time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not normal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uniquely American and it must end.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I would like to welcome everybody.</p>
<p>Boy, we were worked up on that intro.</p>
<p>You were worked up on that intro.</p>
<p>What about you and the personal space invaders?</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>You went on for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Yours was 10 minutes long.</p>
<p>Mine was five, Missy.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>The personal space invading, it makes me crazy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I would like to welcome everybody to I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>It is a place where we come to air petty grievances with each other, with others out into the world,</p>
<p>and sometimes with the listener.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ian Sheehy.</p>
<p>We call her Pumps and she is the star of our show.</p>
<p>Kylie is here with us today.</p>
<p>Richard is here with us today.</p>
<p>And we have an in-studio guest.</p>
<p>Which is so exciting.</p>
<p>So listener, for those of you that don&rsquo;t know, I am an interior designer when I&rsquo;m not the</p>
<p>co-star to the main star of I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>The supporting star.</p>
<p>The supporting star.</p>
<p>I am a high-end interior designer and I work with a gentleman named Kyle Bunting who makes</p>
<p>these fabulous cowhide rugs.</p>
<p>And when you hear cowhide, listener, don&rsquo;t think country and western because that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what this is.</p>
<p>For those of you that watch our TikToks and Instagrams and YouTube, you can see the blue</p>
<p>wallpaper wall behind us.</p>
<p>That is all cowhide made for us by Kyle Bunting.</p>
<p>And I have been doing business with Kyle for over 10 years.</p>
<p>And he has come up to Oklahoma City to do some business with me and to be a guest on</p>
<p>our podcast.</p>
<p>We snagged him to do it.</p>
<p>We need a male perspective.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get Kyle in here.</p>
<p>Kyle, welcome.</p>
<p>Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>To Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>To I&rsquo;ve Had It Podcast.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you tell us, you make these rugs and you sell them all over the world.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Can you tell the listener, are there any A-list celebs that you can kiss and tell where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been public?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>None?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done work for Jen Welch.</p>
<p>That is a D-lister.</p>
<p>That is as far as it&rsquo;s going to go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What about&hellip;</p>
<p>No, she&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a C-lister.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m teaser.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>At least a C-lister.</p>
<p>At least a C-minus.</p>
<p>No, you know how it is.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of part of how this thing works.</p>
<p>What about&hellip;</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you do some for like a bougie retail store in Paris?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You know, I did do something that is public.</p>
<p>It was a stunt rug.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I made a&hellip;</p>
<p>The company was on the Kardashians about a decade ago.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And the producers called and said, hey, we got this idea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to have this domestic disaster.</p>
<p>And our idea is one of the girls drops like a bowl of pasta on the Kyle Bunning carpet</p>
<p>and Chris freaks out and this whole thing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, but we don&rsquo;t want to destroy the rug.</p>
<p>So what do you think we should do?</p>
<p>So we made a stunt rug.</p>
<p>It was like a small version of the same carpet and they closed up on it and they dumped the</p>
<p>pasta on it and we got a bunch of notoriety from it.</p>
<p>So I have made carpets for the Kardashians.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I could talk about that one, but that&rsquo;s as far as you go.</p>
<p>And I have a famous one because I&rsquo;ve seen it in the person&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>The Flaming Lips.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The chairs you&rsquo;ve done for the Flaming Lips.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen those in person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I first saw your work because I thought, oh my God, this is nuts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we did a carpet for Elton John.</p>
<p>That was my big one.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Did you get to meet him?</p>
<p>And that was published so I can&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I never get to meet these people.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>You know, but all in the game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, Kyle and I work in an industry that is basically comprised of women and gay men.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You think?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Kyle is a good looking guy, lives in Austin, Texas, travels all over the country in Europe.</p>
<p>And Kyle, I have to tell you, so a lot of my friends, because they hear me say, Kyle</p>
<p>Bunting, Kyle Bunting, let&rsquo;s do a Kyle Bunting rug here, Kyle Bunting wallpaper there.</p>
<p>So, they Google you or they get on your Instagram and they say, does Kyle have a boyfriend?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so cute.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, never heard that before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a new one.</p>
<p>Yeah, that happens all the time.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s just part of the design business.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reasonably manicured, wake up, maybe take care of yourself a little bit, a little</p>
<p>reverse stereotype maybe.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Straight guy thinking, you know, thinking he&rsquo;s a gay guy.</p>
<p>I thought Pumps was gay way before.</p>
<p>But even when we first went to dinner, I just assumed you were gay, I never asked, but I</p>
<p>just assumed.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re at dinner, you&rsquo;re manicured, you&rsquo;re groomed well, cute outfit, good hair, all</p>
<p>of that.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m thinking 100%.</p>
<p>So, then you start talking about your kids.</p>
<p>I was like, oh, that&rsquo;s so cool.</p>
<p>He adopted kids, you know, great.</p>
<p>And then it wasn&rsquo;t until later in the evening, and I think I leaned over to Jennifer, like</p>
<p>dessert was coming.</p>
<p>I was like, so Kyle&rsquo;s not gay?</p>
<p>She was like, no, Kyle&rsquo;s not gay.</p>
<p>And I was like, oh, well, I thought he was, but I mean, you thought I was gay.</p>
<p>Does this benefit you out in the dating world?</p>
<p>Listener, Kyle is divorced, single, dad.</p>
<p>Do you think it makes you more approachable to a woman?</p>
<p>Well, it definitely makes me more approachable to a man.</p>
<p>No doubt about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all the time, like, hey, fellas, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think there might be something to that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the, it might be more about the business that we&rsquo;re in, like you have something</p>
<p>that women are generally interested in, design and something you can relate to.</p>
<p>And so I think, I think that&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never hurt to be a designer, but he ever said, God, you know, could you be a fireman</p>
<p>or like a contract or something masculine?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, you know, I just do design.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it works.</p>
<p>Josh Welch, who is a friend of yours, is total metrosexual.</p>
<p>So he gets a lot, especially when we were on the TV show, he&rsquo;ll get this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a gay vibe from Josh.</p>
<p>And I kind of, I personally like a more manicured man that likes to go shopping with me.</p>
<p>I mean, Josh and I love to go shopping.</p>
<p>Pumps is a terrible companion for me to shop.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get on to Kyle thinking you were gay.</p>
<p>I think this is.</p>
<p>Well, I want to talk, I mean, you know, I&rsquo;m trying to not wave the gay card, but I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>talk about shopping.</p>
<p>So you say you&rsquo;re not gay, but you do like to shop.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s kind of like the funny thing, like, I mean, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, these are like</p>
<p>interesting stereotypes, right?</p>
<p>Like that we carry and we think we&rsquo;ve shed them all.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of a, what are you like a little under the radar one?</p>
<p>Because for me, it&rsquo;s, I like to shop because I like to see, you know, what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in design and fashion and what&rsquo;s forward.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m touching textiles and fabrics, you know, and thinking about where it comes from.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of part of the game, you know, that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>You need to know these things and be in front of it.</p>
<p>And it just happens to be, you know, nice to buy pretty things too.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I love.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m addicted to buying bags for.</p>
<p>Like man purses?</p>
<p>Kyle, recently.</p>
<p>No, the women, if I, the relationships that I&rsquo;m in, I&rsquo;m in a, I&rsquo;m a real good.</p>
<p>You get bags, you get all sorts of great stuff.</p>
<p>Listener and Pumps and Kylie, Kyle sent me a Christmas gift and I&rsquo;m very difficult to</p>
<p>shop for because I make my own money and I buy what I want when I want to.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have to ask anybody for permission.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I get, if I want something, I can go buy it.</p>
<p>And so Kyle sends me this gift and I&rsquo;m like, oh, that poor soul.</p>
<p>I open it up and it is this fabulous Alexander McQueen clutch that is, I mean, 12 out of</p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>I called him and I&rsquo;m like, oh, it&rsquo;s, it takes a lot for me to be effusive over a gift.</p>
<p>I was like, Kyle, I am genuinely telling you, you crushed it.</p>
<p>You knocked it out of the ballpark.</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>I mean, even Josh was like, he nailed it.</p>
<p>Like that is a great gift.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t, it didn&rsquo;t hurt that it had brass knuckles on it so you could, you know, take</p>
<p>care of people.</p>
<p>It does have brass knuckles like that you can attach your hand to.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>And so it is a nice little thing.</p>
<p>Like if somebody, we were just talking about personal space invaders before you got in</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a great, I could, we should get you one of these clutches, Pumps, because</p>
<p>you could use that.</p>
<p>Just knock the personal space invader completely out.</p>
<p>Just knock them out.</p>
<p>Kyle, I want to move on to this whole, you know, Pumps is single, you&rsquo;re single and this</p>
<p>whole post divorce dating world, it seems to focus on women and it seems like, and maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just because I&rsquo;m a woman and that&rsquo;s what shows up in my algorithm.</p>
<p>But as a man out there in the wilderness, a Gen Xer, walk us through your dating journey</p>
<p>post divorce and what that has been like for a man that often is confused with a gay</p>
<p>man.</p>
<p>Good looking, works in the design world, great gift giver, deep in the heart of Texas.</p>
<p>Tell us what this looks like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like, you know, you can, online dating is kind of interesting because you can just</p>
<p>put, you know, I&rsquo;m straight, believe it or not, and try to clear the deck.</p>
<p>But, you know, I think that, you know, people that have been divorced, I mean, it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>You meet people and there&rsquo;s children and then there&rsquo;s jobs and just all sorts of strange</p>
<p>stuff and blending things.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a lot of crazy in the field.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of crazy.</p>
<p>And I think we talked about this, you and I once, about like social media and I think</p>
<p>it kind of warps perspectives.</p>
<p>It does weird things to what would otherwise be like normal stuff.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, when you&rsquo;re in the seventh grade, you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;ll see you after lunch.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, you know, you see him after lunch, but, you know, somebody swipes right if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>online dating and they&rsquo;re like, he hasn&rsquo;t, you know, swiped right like I did.</p>
<p>You get all anxious and you wait on these things.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people that get a little lost in it all.</p>
<p>Have you ever bumped into people, you know, on an online dating app?</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I went on, you know, I went on Bumble and you have these interesting things.</p>
<p>You kind of, you&rsquo;re running into profiles of people and you&rsquo;d be like, oh, that&rsquo;s somebody</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Oh, she&rsquo;s a friend of mine.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>No big deal.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then you have, oh, she works for me.</p>
<p>Oh God, that&rsquo;s, you know, so-and-so down the hall.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There she is.</p>
<p>There she is.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, oh, I went out with her, hope she finds somebody.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re kind of like, oh, you know, there&rsquo;s God, oh God, I dated her for a couple</p>
<p>of months.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And she dumped me.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, I should try to do that again and see what happens.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like, you know, the mother load of emotional reaction, which is bumping</p>
<p>into your ex-wife.</p>
<p>So walk us through this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re swiping through Bumble.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so what do you do?</p>
<p>Like one direction is a yes, one direction is a no, and you&rsquo;re swiping and then pops</p>
<p>up your ex-wife.</p>
<p>I remember it was one night I was in a hotel or something and I was just like, well, you</p>
<p>know, why not take a look?</p>
<p>Might as well.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe somebody will say, I&rsquo;m amazing, I love guys in the design business, I&rsquo;m looking</p>
<p>to move to Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>I mean, I was hoping for everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a great lay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I&rsquo;ve just, I cook, you know, I&rsquo;ll do what you say.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever you want it to be, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m swiping along and then, you know, boom, there&rsquo;s my ex-wife.</p>
<p>Which was, so, you know, running into your ex online is kind of like a big one.</p>
<p>But it was kind of funny because, you know, that&rsquo;s inevitable, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re just going to be back in looking for someone.</p>
<p>But to see your ex is an emotional experience you can&rsquo;t truly describe that people can relate</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>But I was in the profile.</p>
<p>You were in the profile photo?</p>
<p>Yeah, which is super weird, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like, I was in it.</p>
<p>Like a couple&rsquo;s photo?</p>
<p>I remember going, oh, you know, damn, there she is.</p>
<p>And I started looking at the pictures and I&rsquo;m like, there I am.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like my hand coming around her hip or like on a shoulder.</p>
<p>It was like, I was cut out of every single one of them.</p>
<p>Oh, you were chomped.</p>
<p>Okay, wait, you were chomped, but your hand was in it.</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>It was like the Addams Family.</p>
<p>You know, like the hand, I was like on a shoulder or, you know, you could see some fingers around</p>
<p>a hip or something.</p>
<p>Oh, that is great.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll never forget it because it was, it was like, oh, and then you, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like anything when you get, you step back and you stop and you go, okay, kind of look</p>
<p>at this and you read it.</p>
<p>And it perfectly summarized my ex, her description.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I was, that was my next question.</p>
<p>Was the summary accurate?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The summary was just dead on.</p>
<p>It said, and I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>
<p>It said, not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>Got nothing else to say.</p>
<p>So Ponce, do you remember when our show launched and Kyle was so sweet and he was like, Hey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to come up to Oklahoma city.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get a big table and invite whoever you want to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take you and your friends to dinner.</p>
<p>And we found a like restaurant that had the TV so that we could all watch it.</p>
<p>And so Kyle, I&rsquo;m going to let you take the story from here.</p>
<p>Tell the listener what happened.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m pretty comfortable at stuff like this, but now I&rsquo;m feeling a little awkward.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my version of the story.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re having this lovely dinner, just like Jen described.</p>
<p>And Jen had a single friend who either she wanted me to meet very casually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to set you up, just maybe you&rsquo;ll like her.</p>
<p>I make space at the table and I&rsquo;m like, Hey, sit next to me.</p>
<p>You know, how are you?</p>
<p>And you know, just kind of make conversation.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, Hey, so are you hungry?</p>
<p>Would you like something to eat?</p>
<p>And she goes, Oh God, that&rsquo;s so nice.</p>
<p>Now mind you, it&rsquo;s like 10, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 10 o&rsquo;clock and there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s been a reasonable amount of wine.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, Oh, that&rsquo;s so nice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>Let me order something real quick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, Yeah, of course, please do.</p>
<p>And so the waiter comes over and she, you know, whispers something to him for dinner.</p>
<p>And then about 15 minutes later, she gets up and says, God, well, Hey, thank you.</p>
<p>You know, some kind of single mom thing, like the babysitter, my kids, you know, the meter.</p>
<p>I mean, it was just some kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Gotta wash my hair.</p>
<p>Some kind of dumb excuse.</p>
<p>Like, I gotta go.</p>
<p>But it was lovely to meet you because there was, like we were talking about earlier, there</p>
<p>was&hellip;</p>
<p>Eh, it&rsquo;s not here, right?</p>
<p>No spark.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t looking for that.</p>
<p>But point being is she gets up to leave and I look over and I watch her leave and I look</p>
<p>over by the&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in this private dining room and there&rsquo;s this like a little credenza.</p>
<p>And on the corner of the credenza is this massive to-go bag.</p>
<p>Like with like styrofoam boxes popping out of the top, you know, like where you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pinch the handle and they have to kind of tape it together and you end up hugging it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And she picks it up and she just rolls out of the restaurant with a massive box.</p>
<p>And I remember the waiter, I look at him and he just kind of goes, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry, dude.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he gave me like that, I&rsquo;m so sorry, dude, like puppy dog eyes kind of thing.</p>
<p>And then when he brings me the check, I&rsquo;m like, you got to tell me, what&rsquo;s the damage</p>
<p>on there?</p>
<p>And he goes, man, I never seen something like that.</p>
<p>So she&hellip;</p>
<p>It was like sides and dessert and appetizers.</p>
<p>It was like a porterhouse, I mean, I was like, what?</p>
<p>So, but yeah, that was&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>No, you know, I&rsquo;m not sorry.</p>
<p>You know, I always kind of laugh with you, like, you know, I ain&rsquo;t had it with a lot</p>
<p>of stuff, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally real positive.</p>
<p>But even something like that, I mean, I guess I should have had it with it.</p>
<p>But I look at things like that as like great stories and experience.</p>
<p>It was worth it in every way, because you kind of grow, you know, when things are hard,</p>
<p>you get better.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Kyle, we cannot thank you enough for joining us and giving us a male perspective on things.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>And I mean, not the gay male perspective.</p>
<p>The straight male.</p>
