    <p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to another all in podcast. We just got the show notes,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m ripping them up because the president has the Rona. We knew this was a possibility.</p>
<p>We had an incredible docket brewing, but as fate loves irony, we found out on Wednesday night,</p>
<p>I believe, just in a brief timeline here, Wednesday night, Hope Hicks, his personal assistant,</p>
<p>got the Rona. And then, of course, President Trump announced late last night that he,</p>
<p>in fact, had the Rona and that his wife, Melania, also had the coronavirus.</p>
<p>So with us today to discuss all things tech, politics, and coronavirus, David Friedberg,</p>
<p>David Sachs, and Bestie C. Chamath Palihapitiya are with us. I guess maybe we&rsquo;ll just drop it</p>
<p>right to you, Friedberg. You are our science kid here in the class. What is, when we look at the</p>
<p>president&rsquo;s physique, he&rsquo;s clinically obese. Technically, I&rsquo;m not saying that to be cruel,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a 74-year-old who&rsquo;s clinically obese and snorts Adderall. We don&rsquo;t know that. That&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a claim. But seriously, what is the prognosis here? And then, I understand he&rsquo;s now got a</p>
<p>experimental treatment, was just announced an hour ago at the taping of this on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>And of course, we wish them all the greatest speedy recovery, etc. But let&rsquo;s get into the</p>
<p>facts here. I think the overall mortality rate for someone of his age is in, call it the two to</p>
<p>four percent range, right? And for someone with, you know, he&rsquo;s not known to have diabetes or high</p>
<p>blood pressure, but generally, you can kind of say there&rsquo;s some risk factors maybe associated.</p>
<p>So, a couple points. But the reality is the treatment that he got is one that&rsquo;s not available</p>
<p>to the public and is effectively like creating these, you know, taking these antibodies to the</p>
<p>coronavirus. And he got eight grams of this immunoglobulin therapy that is basically a bunch</p>
<p>of antibodies that will eliminate the virus. And they&rsquo;re not widely available. They&rsquo;re not publicly</p>
<p>available, these treatments. But, you know, based on the early trials and the general experience</p>
<p>with using synthetic and, you know, polyclonal antibodies for infectious disease like this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty effective. And he should kind of, you know, recover pretty quickly, I would imagine.</p>
<p>So, him dying would basically be a two-outer, him getting this special treatment makes it</p>
<p>a one-outer, if we were talking about this in poker terms. Chamath, when you look at this turn</p>
<p>of events and you saw the news, what was your first thought? That it&rsquo;s now basically a hundred</p>
<p>percent guaranteed that we will have all of the most transparent data about coronavirus soon. So,</p>
<p>for example, you know, we&rsquo;ve been in this position where we&rsquo;ve been debating hydroxychloroquine,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been debating these, you know, all of these different regimens. And the reality is,</p>
<p>the President of the United States, if he doesn&rsquo;t get the absolute top-notch care,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all in some ways fucked. So, it&rsquo;s probably likely that he&rsquo;s going to get the thing that</p>
<p>folks know to work. And then it&rsquo;ll be hard for everybody else to not want to ask for that.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s going to be even harder for everybody to then not get some version of it. And so,</p>
<p>I think probably we&rsquo;re going to de-escalate a little bit of mask stuff, of testing stuff,</p>
<p>of, you know, what the right course of care is. And, you know, frankly, I&rsquo;ll be honest with you,</p>
<p>I hope, you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t vote for him, but I hope he&rsquo;s well. I don&rsquo;t want anything to happen</p>
<p>to the guy. And I hope that he recovers and it, you know, he kicks it in the ass and that</p>
<p>whatever he took to get better, everybody else can get it too.</p>
<p>All right, Sax, coming around the horn here, talking about the political ramifications of</p>
<p>this. You were feeling that Trump was likely to lose, but here we are with the October surprise.</p>
<p>And I hate to make this handicapping of the election, but this certainly is going to have</p>
<p>some impact. So, with your Rain Man mind, and when you go through this deck of cards here,</p>
<p>what does your brain, how do you assess this as the Rain Man? Is this going to be a net positive</p>
<p>for his election results? A negative, neutral? Handicap this for us in your mind. You must be</p>
<p>thinking through this. And again, disclaimers, we all want him to get better. Nobody wishes him</p>
<p>well. I&rsquo;m sure some people do, but nobody wishes him well. I&rsquo;m seeing a lot of glee, frankly,</p>
<p>on Twitter. Yeah. A lot of people saying, I told you so, or karma&rsquo;s a bitch or something like that.</p>
<p>You know, sort of implying that Trump getting this was a moral failing, you know. And, you know,</p>
<p>certainly a lot of people are kind of reveling in it. Well, he was certainly careless. I mean,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t wear masks. He said he didn&rsquo;t like to wear masks. So, he was careless.</p>
<p>Do you wear a mask inside your house?</p>
<p>No, but if I was in walking around at a debate or something like that,</p>
<p>if I was on an airplane with 20 people, yeah, I would wear a mask.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there were certainly a lot of precautions around the president,</p>
<p>I mean, more than most people. I mean, any of us could get it from anybody, you know. If,</p>
<p>you know, our wife happens to go out to meet a friend for lunch or something like that,</p>
<p>and then brings it back. So, there&rsquo;s almost no amount of carefulness you can do to completely</p>
<p>avoid this unless you&rsquo;re willing to kind of lock yourself alone somewhere. So, I just, you know,</p>
<p>this idea that somehow getting COVID is a moral failing is what I would take issue with. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>altogether unlike the crazy things that the religious right was saying in the 1980s, like,</p>
<p>you know, about AIDS, like when, you know, Jerry Falwell said it was God&rsquo;s punishment or something</p>
<p>like that, trying to imply that‚Ä¶ They called it the gay plague. I mean,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call it what it is. They basically said‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Right. They implied somehow that this was, you know, some sort of just comeuppance,</p>
<p>you know, or something like that. Retribution from God for being gay.</p>
<p>Retribution, exactly, exactly. And, you know, the virus doesn&rsquo;t know who it&rsquo;s infecting,</p>
<p>obviously. It doesn&rsquo;t target sinners or whatever. And so, I just think that, you know, all this</p>
<p>sort of gleeful sort of blaminess going around is inappropriate, and I think it could really backfire</p>
<p>if Trump rapidly gets better. I mean, if Trump is better in, say, a week and is hitting the campaign</p>
<p>trail again, you know, what previously will have appeared to be a moral failing, it could now be</p>
<p>argued would be a moral strength since he, you know, overcame it so easily. And so, I think that</p>
<p>if he rapidly recovers from this and hits the campaign trail again, it&rsquo;s going to make him look</p>
<p>strong. I think that if he has a hard time with the virus, if it&rsquo;s enervating,</p>
<p>the way that I think it took out Boris Johnson, I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard British commentators say that</p>
<p>Boris Johnson&rsquo;s just not even the same, doesn&rsquo;t have the same level of energy even now than he</p>
<p>did before the virus, then I would think it could really hurt Trump in the last, you know,</p>
<p>couple months of this campaign. I mean, guys, look, I think we all know people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you guys do, I do, who have gone through this, and they all say the same thing, which is</p>
<p>this thing really sucks. Now, there are all these people that say, Oh, it&rsquo;s like dancing on tulips or</p>
<p>daffodils. I&rsquo;ve never encountered a single person like that. I see that. I see that maybe on Twitter</p>
<p>or a friend of a friend, but all of my friends who&rsquo;ve gotten it, they have really struggled</p>
<p>through it. Some of these people are older, some of these people are younger. Some of these people</p>
<p>are healthy, some of these people are not. And consistently, they say the same thing, which is</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a couple of days where it literally feels like your chest is being pounded inside you,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t move, you&rsquo;re just in pain. And then afterwards, the aftermath is you&rsquo;re at, you know,</p>
<p>50 6070% of your lung capacity, like it does something for a couple of weeks. I mean, Doc</p>
<p>sales is a friend of ours. And he was very public with his experience. He tried to avoid it as best</p>
<p>he could, he got hit with it, he got hit hard. And he said he felt like he was gonna die was the worst</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s ever experienced. I have friends that still complain two, three, four months after the fact</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re at 50 60% of cardiovascular capacity. And, you know, these, these people that I that I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>specifically thinking about were really healthy going into Coronavirus. And so I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s something none of us want. I don&rsquo;t think you would want to wish this on anybody.</p>
<p>You know, especially frankly, the President of the United States as a role. And so I think folks</p>
<p>just need to sort of like, class up here and hope that we figure out that he gets the best care and</p>
<p>then be we all know what it is, and then see that we can get access to it too. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>honestly, I think that&rsquo;s all we should be wishing him off.</p>
<p>Did you see Did you see the letter they published on what he&rsquo;s getting?</p>
<p>So they did the go ahead and read it.</p>
<p>The doctor published it was not too long ago, right? Jason, I saw it on your</p>
<p>just happened like an hour ago. I tweeted it. Yes. So he got eight grams of polyclonal antibodies.</p>
<p>This is the Regeneron formulation. So basically, they&rsquo;ve isolated the antibodies that neutralize</p>
<p>Coronavirus that patients have presented in their body. And then they use recombinant</p>
<p>DNA technology to produce those antibodies synthetically. So it&rsquo;s a bunch of antibody</p>
<p>proteins. And then they turn it into an injection into a formula that they can put in your body.</p>
<p>And you now have effectively neutralizing antibodies. So they gave him eight grams,</p>
<p>which is a pretty high dose. And it gets, you know, goes in intravenously, you can have</p>
<p>sometimes an allergic reaction to that, but it seems like he was fine from that,</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t announce an allergic reaction. And then, you know, the antibodies are now in his</p>
<p>bloodstream, and they bind to the virus. So any virus that&rsquo;s floating around immediately gets</p>
<p>wiped out, it gets eliminated from the body. So theoretically, this is the way we should treat all</p>
<p>infectious disease. And I do think that, by the way, I do, and I&rsquo;ve written about this, I think</p>
<p>that is the future of infectious disease is we&rsquo;re all going to get a polyclonal cocktail every year,</p>
<p>instead of getting a flu shot, you get a bunch of antibodies to all the new stuff that&rsquo;s emerging.</p>
<p>And it was this, David, just think about this, there was so much raging debate that got politicized</p>
<p>between the left between the right between different folks of people who believed in</p>
<p>different things around what the right course of care was, there was no single source of truth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say this again, when you treat the President of the United States, and he gets</p>
<p>better. That is canonical single source of truth. I&rsquo;m sorry, but there can be no debate after that,</p>
<p>that the smartest people with the access to all of the research, I mean, let&rsquo;s be clear,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t think a call went out last night before they deployed the nuclear warhead stuff to all of</p>
<p>the R&amp;D labs and all the big pharma companies and said, What do you got? And the answer came back</p>
<p>at the top of the ticket was this Regeneron cocktail. Yeah, they had, they definitely</p>
<p>have made that call before to prep for this. But yeah, totally great. Now, when you say</p>
<p>it highlights what the future of infectious disease treatment is and should be, which is that</p>
<p>all of us should be getting a booster shot every year of synthetically produced antibodies that</p>
<p>will counteract any new infectious disease floating around in the world. And we&rsquo;re getting to the</p>
<p>point in the next 1015 years that that should be reality for everyone. Well, I think we Yeah,</p>
<p>it highlights that. But it also highlights that in the absence of the most powerful man in the</p>
<p>world getting the sickness, that we&rsquo;re all going to basically bitch and point fingers about what</p>
<p>the right solution is. And so it can&rsquo;t be the case that the next time there&rsquo;s a crazy illness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s floating around in society, we need to go and target, you know, five or six of the leaders</p>
<p>of the G8, plus the Pope, plus this plus that Beyonce, heaven forbid, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, this is crazy. Yeah, this can&rsquo;t this can&rsquo;t be how we find single source of truth.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I think if I think, politically speaking, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of upside here</p>
<p>for Trump, if he does get better in a week, I mean, if these polyclonal antibodies work,</p>
<p>then and he emerges from the White House, you know, if it is a fiddle in a week,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna say the curious here, you know, I was right, we don&rsquo;t even need a vaccine,</p>
<p>the curious here, it&rsquo;s over. And, and all the I told you, so is my my</p>
<p>far off would that be from the truth, David? Well, the polyclonal polyclonal antibodies work,</p>
<p>I mean, it then it&rsquo;s just a matter of scaling them. Can it be scale freeberg? Is this easily</p>
<p>scalable? Yes. But by the way, I&rsquo;ll just point out the challenge with this is a lot of people</p>
<p>north of 15% will have because antibodies, remember, they&rsquo;re a protein. And if your cells</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make that protein, they look like a foreign protein when they show up in your body.</p>
<p>And so very often, when you get a foreign antibody treatment like this,</p>
<p>you will have some sort of allergic reaction, because your body will react and attack that</p>
<p>protein. And so it&rsquo;s not as simple as just saying, hey, we should just scale this up and give it to</p>
<p>everyone. Because the clinical trials that are going on with it are to figure out what percentage</p>
<p>of people what&rsquo;s the right way to treat people, what&rsquo;s the right way to protect them from</p>
<p>anaphylactic shock, all that sort of stuff that comes along with this sort of thing. So it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that simple. We&rsquo;re making that freeberg, you would admit that many of those questions,</p>
<p>the answer, the answers to many of those questions must have been well in hand,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just zero way. Oh, Regeneron&rsquo;s been running these trials since March. 100%.</p>
<p>Yeah, 100%. I can tell you for sure, when Trump got this treatment, I guarantee they gave him</p>
<p>Benadryl. And they gave him a steroid shot. And they probably gave him a little bit of cortisone</p>
<p>or they had it on the side. Because that&rsquo;s kind of like the standard sort of regimen you would use</p>
<p>when you get this sort of, you know, synthesized or convalescent plasma type treatment. And,</p>
<p>you know, he comes out of this thing on the other end, and he&rsquo;s fine. But But that treatment</p>
<p>regimen is required. So it&rsquo;s, you know, you sit down in an ID booth, and you get a fucking ID,</p>
<p>and you get shots to go along with it. So it&rsquo;s not as simple as just shipping it out to everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>home and giving them that treatment. You know, it only Am I correct that only 300 or so people</p>
<p>have gotten this to date? Is that correct with the trial? I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that. I know</p>
<p>that convalescent plasma, which is call it the poor man&rsquo;s version of this treatment, which is</p>
<p>instead of synthesizing the antibodies, you&rsquo;re taking the actual antibodies from other people</p>
<p>that have had COVID and recovered, you&rsquo;re isolating those antibodies, and you&rsquo;re injecting</p>
<p>them in other people&rsquo;s bodies. So that is what convalescent plasma is, it is effectively a soup</p>
<p>of all the antibodies from recovered patients. polyclonal antibodies is the synthesized version</p>
<p>of those isolated antibodies, where we use fermentation systems and bioengineered cells</p>
<p>to make those antibodies, then we isolate them, and we and we use any chance that the president</p>
<p>would make a bad decision here, because he would get to dictate his treatment as a powerful person,</p>
<p>like Steve Jobs did, tragically, I saw a doctor saying this is one of the problems with powerful</p>
<p>people is that they actually can, you know, make a bad decision, because doctors will let them have</p>
<p>too much of a say. And is that possible in this situation? You think? I think the answer is no,</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t put out a letter saying he got bleach and UV light.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t go with his own treatment protocol. And also, I was just gonna say and also,</p>
<p>you know, it eliminated all of the other less nonsensical, but equally sort of question mark</p>
<p>treatments. And so you know, I think they went right to the answer, which would only have been</p>
<p>really possible. If the best docs basically said, this is what we&rsquo;re doing. And I think David</p>
<p>mentioned this earlier, that it had been decided well in advance. I think that&rsquo;s a good insight.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a protocol that was written down months ago, vetted and revetted</p>
<p>probably every week or every month as they get as they got more data. And so the minute it happened,</p>
<p>there was nothing to talk about. And I suspect that that is probably what happened. Because</p>
<p>there is no way you&rsquo;d want to be, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of like being a pilot, like, you follow a</p>
<p>systematic set of rules to deal with the overwhelming majority of boundary conditions.</p>
<p>And this seemed like a pretty obvious boundary condition, you would have wanted to have a</p>
<p>protocol for well in advance. So, okay, so I want to just do one handicapping here,</p>
<p>sacks, I&rsquo;ll have you take this one off the bat. Because this was the chatter on Twitter. Number</p>
<p>one, the first two, I think are just crazy conspiracy. There is he got it on purpose,</p>
<p>or he&rsquo;s lying. Put those aside for a second, you can answer them if you want to. But the third one</p>
<p>is, hey, what happens if he&rsquo;s incapacitated and cannot run? Or, God forbid he died. And</p>
<p>so if he&rsquo;s on a ventilator, if he cannot leave the hospital, he&rsquo;s in ICU.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a question. The 25th Amendment deals with that. Yeah, so it goes to Pence.</p>
<p>And if Pence cannot do it for whatever reason, but he&rsquo;s I think he&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>Okay, I was actually going to refer to the election, though, what happens to the election</p>
<p>if in the next three, four weeks, he&rsquo;s in ICU? What happens then?</p>
<p>Oh, that I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, I would assume it&rsquo;s up to the party to make a change to his ballot if they wanted to,</p>
<p>but I think if he&rsquo;s in the ICU, he stays on the ballot.</p>
<p>So we would literally have an election with him on a ventilator or him. I mean, if he was</p>
<p>unconscious, could he, could people still go vote for him? This is a possibility.</p>
<p>I think these are very low probability outcomes. I think the most likely outcome here is that</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s got the best care, he&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s probably like at least 50% that this is over</p>
<p>for him in about a week. And it redounds to his political advantage. I think there&rsquo;s probably a</p>
<p>40% chance that, you know, he&rsquo;s got more like a three or four week case, which I think would</p>
<p>hurt him because he just wouldn&rsquo;t be able to campaign. And then there&rsquo;s maybe like a five</p>
<p>or 10% chance of something more serious.</p>
<p>I wonder if he&rsquo;s got, if he, even if he recovers in a week,</p>
<p>the odds are pretty high that he&rsquo;ll have, you know, a long tail of fatigue, right? And so</p>
<p>if he, if he doesn&rsquo;t change his, if he changes his strategy and just does things remotely and</p>
<p>whatnot, and doesn&rsquo;t do rallies anymore, you know, and he doesn&rsquo;t really come out and say</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fatigued, but there&rsquo;s this behavioral change. Does that change things do you think?</p>
<p>I think he needs to be able to campaign and hold these rallies. I think that&rsquo;s an essential part</p>
<p>of his election strategy, but also it&rsquo;s always been his way of, you know, going over the heads</p>
<p>of the media that hates him and talking directly to people and rallying his base and field testing</p>
<p>his ideas. There was that period when during lockdowns, when he just stopped doing rallies</p>
<p>for several months and it really felt like he was adrift. So yeah, I think if he can&rsquo;t do rallies,</p>
<p>I think, you know, that could easily swing the election a couple of points and cause him to lose.</p>
<p>I think Saksipu is a hundred percent right.</p>
<p>I was in Indiana last week and there were a bunch of folks in the neighborhood where I was staying</p>
<p>and I was walking my dog and they were walking their dog. So we were all kind of walking side</p>
<p>by side and they all were ramping up to go to a Trump rally. They were super excited about this,</p>
<p>this moment to go hear what he has to say. They sounded like they were kind of in this undecided</p>
<p>camp, but they wanted to go to the rally to hear what he had to say and kind of experience that</p>
<p>Trump moment. It was a real kind of ground level, I think, proof point for your statement around</p>
<p>like, you know, people really need to feel and because that&rsquo;s a big part of his kind of MO,</p>
<p>is that ground level experience.</p>
<p>It is. And I think it was one of the reasons why no one saw his election coming in 2016</p>
<p>is if you turned on the TV and just listened to the commentators, I mean, aside from maybe Fox,</p>
<p>it seemed like everyone just hated him. But if you attended the rallies, you would see that he</p>
<p>was reaching a lot of people, tens of thousands of people at each event and he was flying around</p>
<p>doing three events a day, tremendously energetic. So yeah, I think it would hurt him a lot.</p>
<p>But look, if he&rsquo;s back on the stump a week from now, you&rsquo;re probably going to see all sorts of</p>
<p>people on the right saying, you know, I told you so and God healed him and, you know, he must be</p>
<p>the chosen one or, you know, who knows? We could be seeing a Weekend at Bernie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>moment here. Even if he&rsquo;s just tired, they&rsquo;ll prop him up on a big stick and hold him up in</p>
<p>front of the crowds and then put him back in the airplane and fly him back home.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll know if he&rsquo;s too tired because, you know, he gets up there and he talks for like an</p>
<p>hour and a half. An hour and a half? He&rsquo;s done two or three.</p>
<p>An hour and a half is short for him.</p>
<p>Is it possible we could be talking about Trump having less energy than Biden in a debate,</p>
<p>which I think is a good segue here. Are there going to be two more presidential debates? And</p>
<p>what was our take on the absolutely embarrassing shit show that we saw on Tuesday night, which was</p>
<p>supposed to be the topic today that we&rsquo;re going to lead off, which was the debate, which seems</p>
<p>unimportant now.</p>
<p>It feels like a year ago.</p>
<p>How do you expect us to comment on something that happened so long ago?</p>
<p>It was 72 hours ago. I mean, come on, people.</p>
<p>Oh my God. It feels like years.</p>
<p>2020 is so exhausting. I think I&rsquo;ve aged 30 years in one year. It&rsquo;s like three decades.</p>
<p>That debate was just a dumpster fire. You know, the way that I thought about it was-</p>
<p>Wrong. Wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not true. I mean, imagine-</p>
<p>No, no, I agree. It was a disaster for Trump. It was a disaster for Trump.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Sax. Explain, because he&rsquo;s your boy. Are you now not going to vote for him</p>
<p>after that performance?</p>
<p>Just to clarify for the audience, I&rsquo;m not pro-Trump. I&rsquo;m just anti-</p>
<p>Just voting for him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m anti-hysteria. I always support the side that seems least hysterical to me at any given time.</p>
<p>Did you vote for Trump last election? Yes or no? Or would you be comfortable even saying that?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be surprised if I told you who I voted for.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Okay, so onto the debate. I think both Biden and Trump both had a trap to avoid.</p>
<p>I think Biden&rsquo;s trap was appearing senile. I think Trump&rsquo;s trap was appearing unhinged. I would say</p>
<p>that Biden avoided his trap, and Trump did not. By constantly attacking Biden, interrupting him,</p>
<p>it was counterproductive. I mean, what you want to do with Biden is let the man talk. He&rsquo;s a gaffe</p>
<p>machine. You know, let him talk, let him say things that will get him in trouble. Instead,</p>
<p>by constantly interrupting him, Trump kind of let him off the hook.</p>
<p>Now look, I mean, both of their bases, it&rsquo;s like a sporting event. They&rsquo;re just going to</p>
<p>root for the side they already came to support. But I don&rsquo;t think Trump helped himself with the</p>
<p>few percent of independents who are still out there looking to make a decision.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re totally right. It was really surprising because if he had just left him</p>
<p>to his own devices, you would have let it play out. But I thought Biden, to be honest,</p>
<p>there were some moments he was fabulous. So I thought he was excellent on race. I thought he</p>
<p>was incredible in the moment that he basically stood up to Trump about his son, Hunter,</p>
<p>and he looks in the camera and he basically says, look, I love my son, my son&rsquo;s had troubles,</p>
<p>and I support, I mean, amazing. And so like in those moments, it&rsquo;s so hard to not see that guy</p>
<p>as presidential. And I don&rsquo;t, meaning like it&rsquo;s easy for Democrats or people that are voting for</p>
<p>him like me, but I think if you were a Republican, you got to look at that guy and say, man, that is</p>
<p>a decent dude. Yeah, I thought he did. He did in certain key moments, he did fabulously well.</p>
<p>And in other moments where there were traps, he actually got built up because Trump kept</p>
<p>interrupting and Joe was smart enough to stop talking so that it amplified the sense that</p>
<p>Trump was interrupting him. Trump, to me, seemed pathetic and scared. That was my,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s scared of losing. He felt like a bully who had been laughed at by the whole class,</p>
<p>like nobody takes him seriously. The moderator, what&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>Chris Wallace.</p>
<p>Chris Wallace. The moderator was kind of like, what are you doing, sir, please? I think Chris</p>
<p>Wallace, I mean, I know people are critical of him, but Chris Wallace is like, sir, please,</p>
<p>just trying to appeal to basic decency and Trump just not getting it made Trump look so bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I think, confirmed with people say the demographic he has to win is white women</p>
<p>in a lot of these swing states. I mean, I don&rsquo;t think women want to vote. I&rsquo;m not gonna speak</p>
<p>for all women here. But my understanding is women don&rsquo;t like guys like that who interrupt</p>
<p>constantly and who are belligerent and badgering. And they kind of like a great dad who defended to</p>
<p>your point, Chamath, you know, his son and said, hey, listen, my son&rsquo;s got problems. My other son</p>
<p>died. And we&rsquo;re here. I really think I really think and I and I and we talked about this a</p>
<p>little bit before, but the surface area in terms of policy between the Republicans and the Democrats</p>
<p>now are virtually non existent. So look, if you unpack foreign policy, they both hate Russia,</p>
<p>they both hate China, they both need India, and the Middle East is irrelevant because we&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>to a carbon neutral, alternative energy world. They also don&rsquo;t need Russia as an example. So</p>
<p>all of this stuff that used to matter before in so much of the foreign policy that dictate how</p>
<p>Americans would fight wars, spend money, you know, incite democracy, protect certain leaders,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all out the window. And they both think about it the same way because the surface area is so</p>
<p>similar. That&rsquo;s number one. What about what about the economy?</p>
<p>So number two, economically, they&rsquo;re so similar, because they both want to spend trillions of</p>
<p>dollars just under a different label. You know, one is sort of under a Green New Deal, and the</p>
<p>other is called an infrastructure bill or whatever it is. And then number three, they will both have</p>
<p>the same Federal Reserve that is tied to the hip of Treasury, who is already committed to be trillions</p>
<p>of dollars a year and Hawk backing up all the debt that basically exists. And so if you put all these</p>
<p>things together, it&rsquo;s a popularity contest. And this is why I think Joe Biden has an advantage</p>
<p>because in a popularity contest where you&rsquo;re just picking the figure that you would, you know,</p>
<p>either have a beer with or feel the most comfortable with, there&rsquo;s an element of this,</p>
<p>which is like, it&rsquo;s just a decent human being. It&rsquo;s easier for Biden to get that across than</p>
<p>it is for Trump. And when Trump behaves that way, it just violates some simple rules of decency.</p>
<p>Like there were in the debate against Hillary Clinton, he didn&rsquo;t act this way. And he was more</p>
<p>it was like watching like a show, like you were kind of like tuning in to see</p>
<p>what the theatrics would be, or in the debates in the primaries in 2016, against the Republicans,</p>
<p>it was theatrical. Here, it was just, it was it was just kind of not, it was, it was pretty</p>
<p>sex in that way, sacks, you think the Democrats put up the right candidate, because if you did</p>
<p>put up Elizabeth Warren, if you did put up a Bernie Sanders, or God forbid, both of them at</p>
<p>the same time, it would be a very stark contrast, you would have the socialist ticket that wants to,</p>
<p>you know, ban the billionaires and stop capitalism and kneecap it and spend a bunch of money</p>
<p>on redistribution of wealth. And here Biden doesn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s never said redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s never said ban the billionaires. He&rsquo;s pro capitalism feels like a safer bet to the majority</p>
<p>of Americans that they did the Democrats actually do a good job putting Biden up there.</p>
<p>I think so. I think he is the most now that we know he&rsquo;s not senile. I mean, I think there was</p>
<p>some real question about that going into the debate. I think he proved in that debate that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not. And you know, he&rsquo;s always kind of had the decency card that Jamal talks about.</p>
<p>Now that we know he&rsquo;s not senile, I think he&rsquo;s he is the the Democrats most electable candidate</p>
<p>because he is more centrist than certainly in Elizabeth Warren or some of the other</p>
<p>candidates that you mentioned. Elizabeth Warren would have moved the election to be about substance.</p>
<p>And in many ways, strategically, no, but think about this. If you basically converge on roughly</p>
<p>the same strategy with different labels, you make the election one of style. And there are a lot of</p>
<p>people who really want decency back in the presidency more so than they want anything</p>
<p>else because they already come into the election with a level of skepticism that policy, a won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>change that fast and be to the extent it changes doesn&rsquo;t affect them. And so, you know, for years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been electing people we like, and this is probably the most extreme test of that idea.</p>
<p>I think I think there was like, I mean, like, if you think about that debate, you could probably</p>
<p>simplify it down into the audience being part of three camps, they either know who they&rsquo;re voting</p>
<p>for Trump, they know who they&rsquo;re voting for Biden. And then some folks who are kind of maybe</p>
<p>built, they&rsquo;re changeable. And for the folks that are changeable, there&rsquo;s a diversity of objectives,</p>
<p>right? There are some folks who care about the decency, some folks who care about policy,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day, I think you go into this debate with an expectation of Trump,</p>
<p>and an expectation of Biden. And I would say that Trump was flat to down relative to expectation,</p>
<p>and Biden was flat to up. And so that&rsquo;s where I would kind of give the ticker to</p>
<p>Jen, sorry, I don&rsquo;t want to interrupt. But I just want to read you this headline,</p>
<p>President Trump will be admitted to Walter Reed Medical Center on Friday, for a few days.</p>
<p>Yeah, I read that.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Well, his doctor said it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re out of an abundance of caution. They just want to</p>
<p>have him in a place where he can be treated. If and as he needs it, that may be a cover story.</p>
<p>I think that look, if you don&rsquo;t buy that, I think he&rsquo;s in trouble.</p>
<p>It is very strange.</p>
<p>When you get a treatment, when you get a treatment like he got today,</p>
<p>you know, eight grams of immunoglobulin therapy like that. It sucks. I&rsquo;ve had this treatment,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had immunoglobulin therapy before. And you get knocked out, you&rsquo;re on all these steroids,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on all this anti allergy stuff. You&rsquo;re a mess for a day or two. And you know, you want</p>
<p>to get like IVs and stuff that give you all sorts of stuff to go with it. I got to imagine that</p>
<p>after getting that therapy, he&rsquo;s going to need to be in some degree of care. And I would imagine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably better to just do that around doctors and with all the equipment than trying</p>
<p>to, you know, kind of bring everything into the White House. So, I don&rsquo;t read it as negatively.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, do you think it could be like an anaphylactic?</p>
<p>He might be having some reaction. Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>Like I said, a large percentage of people that get these antibody therapies have</p>
<p>some sort of allergic response. It&rsquo;s all the way from anaphylactic to</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m having my throat closing. Hey, I feel I&rsquo;m getting flushed. I&rsquo;m getting a fever. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all sorts of ways that this can kind of present. So the world is changing so fast that we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even complete a podcast without being obsolete. Can I say one other thing? What did you guys</p>
<p>think about the fact this is a little morbid, so you can we can choose not to talk about it. But</p>
<p>the stock market basically did nothing today on the news that the most important person in the</p>
<p>free world, theoretically. I think you just answered your own question, Chamath. I can chime</p>
<p>in on this one is I don&rsquo;t think that people perceive that Trump is good or bad for the</p>
<p>economy either way, and that the economy is separated now from politics, because they think</p>
<p>Biden or Trump are going to have the same policies, which you said before, they have the same</p>
<p>policies. So why does it matter? If Trump were to tragically die, it would not make a difference in</p>
<p>the American economy. It&rsquo;s not going to affect people buying iPhones. It might shake people</p>
<p>psychologically. But I don&rsquo;t think in a massive way, because he&rsquo;s almost out of office. So I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s all baked in. That&rsquo;s why the market didn&rsquo;t win. What do you think, Sax?</p>
<p>I want to disagree slightly with the idea this election doesn&rsquo;t matter. I think it will matter</p>
<p>a lot if the Democrats win the Senate, as well as the presidency, because then they will have</p>
<p>one party control, and they can pass as much legislation as they want. And I think a lot of</p>
<p>things will get signed. And I think the Biden presidency could be very consequential, at least</p>
<p>for two years, while all this legislation is passed, even if he&rsquo;s not out in front saying</p>
<p>very much. I mean, the significance will be in the pen to sign the legislation. If the Republicans</p>
<p>hold on to the Senate, but Biden wins the presidency, I agree with you that it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to be a tremendously consequential election, because we&rsquo;ll have gridlock and divided government</p>
<p>again. And so I think a lot hinges on whether Biden wins with or without the Senate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with you. The only thing that I will say is that I think that Biden will drag</p>
<p>the country, especially if it&rsquo;s a, you know, up and down democratic ticket, back to the 80s and</p>
<p>90s, more to the sort of the George Baker School of diplomacy and governance. And I think that if</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know him to know this, but I think that if he really were to have a legacy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I would suspect that part of again, because he&rsquo;s mentioned that, you know,</p>
<p>why did he run? He said the pivotal moment was like Charlottesville and Trump&rsquo;s reaction to</p>
<p>Charlottesville. I think Biden is really moored by this concept of decency. And I think that if,</p>
<p>if he were there, and he thought to himself, I&rsquo;m going to be here for four years, because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the right responsible thing to do, but no more. I don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re going to see a bunch of</p>
<p>crazy legislation pass, I think Biden&rsquo;s gonna say, guys, this is what I expect to do. By the</p>
<p>way, did you? Because and I and I think I would bet on that because of what he said at the beginning</p>
<p>of the debate. He&rsquo;s like, I am the Democratic Party. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys remember that.</p>
<p>That was incredible. That was a very Darth Sidious, Emperor move when he said,</p>
<p>I think he was trying to basically say like, firewall, the far left, or the far left,</p>
<p>the socialist left and say, that rhetoric is not what I was elected on. I was elected on</p>
<p>my platform. I am the party. This is what I believe. And everybody else will have to toe the</p>
<p>line. And by the way, in the end, that&rsquo;s not such a bad thing. Yeah. It&rsquo;s a man.</p>
<p>I agree. I think that that was a really important moment for him is for him to say,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;m in charge here, because the Republicans have been making the argument that he&rsquo;s a Trojan</p>
<p>horse for all these like far left elements. And so, it was very important for him to come</p>
<p>forward and say, no, I&rsquo;m the one leading this ticket. Now, that being said, and I think it</p>
<p>would be a great thing for the country if Biden brought the Democratic Party back to more of a,</p>
<p>you know, Bill Clinton to, you know, Obama type centrism, or, you know, center leftism,</p>
<p>I guess you could say, as opposed to this sort of like crazy, you know, woke Marxism or Maoism,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it. But I&rsquo;m very skeptical that he will, because I think Biden</p>
<p>has always positioned himself throughout his career as being at the center of the Democratic</p>
<p>Party. And I think he moves as the Democratic Party moves. I agree he&rsquo;s not going to be all</p>
<p>the way to the left of the Democratic Party, but those left elements will drag his sort of center</p>
<p>further to the left, and we&rsquo;ll end up with sort of a compromise. And I think at the end of the day,</p>
<p>if the Democrats win Congress, he&rsquo;ll sign whatever they pass.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure. I really, I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>
<p>The White House is not that far away. It looks like it&rsquo;s a 30 minute drive</p>
<p>from Walter Reed sending a helicopter. Is that normal? Because he drove there last time.</p>
<p>Would that be indicative of this is an emergency type situation sending marine one as opposed to</p>
<p>just driving there for 20 minutes? I think they get like, they&rsquo;d be there&rsquo;d be a lot of liability</p>
<p>if he had an actual medical emergency. And they were just like, yeah, we&rsquo;re gonna send him for a</p>
<p>few days out of an abundance of caution. The fact that they said out of an abundance of caution,</p>
<p>I think if there is an emergency, you can&rsquo;t get away with saying that.</p>
<p>Oh, you can, for sure they would lie.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;ll come out later, right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying the Trump administration was above lying about the situation?</p>
<p>Well, if he&rsquo;s unconscious, they got to swear Pence in.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons why you got to be careful.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;s unconscious. I&rsquo;m just saying, is sending marine one like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just thinking out loud here, is sending a helicopter for a 20 minute ride than a motorcade</p>
<p>like seems a little intense?</p>
<p>I would take a helicopter to the 7-Eleven if I had a helicopter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking a helicopter down to the poker game?</p>
<p>Now that is something I would say.</p>
<p>Okay. This is, I think, a good jumping off point to an interesting discussion that blew up on</p>
<p>Twitter earlier this week, which is, we can&rsquo;t keep up with all the politics, the rhetoric,</p>
<p>the vitriol, and this polarization. So, Coinbase co-founder and CEO, Brian Armstrong,</p>
<p>wrote a letter saying, hey, listen, if you want to talk about politics, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Not at my company anymore. We&rsquo;re going to have a no politics rule, no debating this stuff,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to be ultra, ultra focus, focused, I&rsquo;m sorry, at work.</p>
<p>And you can check your politics at the door. When you read this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve come out in support of Brian Armstrong. What was your take on his position about leave</p>
<p>your politics at the door when you get to work? And then we&rsquo;ll go to you, Jamal.</p>
<p>I think what Brian, so I did compliment it, his manifesto, and I think-</p>
<p>Are you an investor?</p>
<p>I am. I&rsquo;m a small investor in Coinbase, and I&rsquo;m friendly with Brian. And so, I certainly</p>
<p>like the idea of defending him against unfair attacks, but I also genuinely like the manifesto.</p>
<p>And I think his argument kind of boils down to three components. I think, number one,</p>
<p>that having these debates on every issue, whatever the issue du jour is, pulls the company&rsquo;s focus</p>
<p>away from its core mission, which he really emphasized. And that mission is challenging</p>
<p>enough in its own right. Second, he was saying that, and this is something I&rsquo;ve said before</p>
<p>as well, which is just that politics is just increasingly divisive in our society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just inherently divisive. And therefore, it&rsquo;s corrosive to team cohesion. And the more</p>
<p>you have of that in your company, the worse it is for the team. And I think the third thing</p>
<p>he mentioned, which I thought was really interesting, is that the freewheeling</p>
<p>debate or discussion of politics like that we&rsquo;re having here, but we kind of have our</p>
<p>own little safe zone here, it risks hurt feelings or misunderstandings that can become HR issues,</p>
<p>because people can then complain about it being- They feel unsafe.</p>
<p>They feel unsafe, and they report it. And so, that&rsquo;s a further distraction to the corporation.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d save that moment for this podcast, I&rsquo;ll be honest. There was a couple of moments I</p>
<p>thought I&rsquo;d save. Well, I think one of the reasons why this pod sort of works is because we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>friends and we&rsquo;ve created a safe space for us to have these conversations, but the workplace is</p>
<p>very different. And what I read Brian trying to do is to reimpose a true safe space by saying,</p>
<p>leave your politics at the door. Now, I think he&rsquo;s been deliberately misconstrued by critics</p>
<p>who want to say that, well, you have to leave your conscience at the door. That&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not saying that you can&rsquo;t have your own political views or contribute to causes that</p>
<p>you like, but you just got to do it on your own time. Kind of like Mr. Han said in Fast Times at</p>
<p>Ridgemont High, do that on your own time. And that makes sense to me.</p>
<p>I think about this from the point of view of one of the employees working at one of these companies</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t want to be a party to the debate. If I&rsquo;m an engineer at Google or Coinbase, I go into</p>
<p>work, and I am captive, right? I don&rsquo;t have the option of not showing up to work. If I go to a</p>
<p>rally, I have the option of saying, I&rsquo;m going to go to this rally and walk away because I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>the speaker, or I&rsquo;m going to go to the rally because I want to participate in this dialogue</p>
<p>or this debate. I can&rsquo;t do that at work. So it&rsquo;s unfair for work, which is a place that I as an</p>
<p>employee have to go to every day to be a forum for people to express themselves on political points</p>
<p>that I may or may not agree with, but more importantly, may or may not want to actually</p>
<p>be a party to the discussion around. And I think that&rsquo;s the most important thing to note here is</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s not about enabling the free speech of the employees that want to debate. It&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>the protecting the workspace for the employees that don&rsquo;t want to debate and don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>exposed to that. And that&rsquo;s really important. As Chamath is a person of color who, you know,</p>
<p>have, I&rsquo;m sure some has some strong feelings about what we&rsquo;ve seen in terms of police shootings,</p>
<p>or maybe in your own personal life experience facing racism. Again, as a person of color,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on the workplace? Is it? Is it possible for you to leave that at the door?</p>
<p>That was the criticism I think I saw from the, you know, people who were supportive of BLM. And</p>
<p>they said the background here was, they were trying to get Brian to explicitly say Black Lives Matter,</p>
<p>and to, you know, have the company rally behind that. And that he didn&rsquo;t, he didn&rsquo;t want to have</p>
<p>that be part of the work environment, and that he was offering people four to six months severance</p>
<p>if they would leave if they don&rsquo;t like the new rules. So what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>I think that this whole thing became a quagmire unnecessarily. I think that he showed a lot of</p>
<p>naivety. And, frankly, like, a little bit of stupidity, really. It was really poorly written.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s been so misunderstood and misconstrued. In my opinion, I think a lot of</p>
<p>what he had to say was valid. But when it was so poorly presented, and, you know, the, the essay was</p>
<p>like, eight minutes, and it was rambling, and the mission was like, you know, 97% down on the,</p>
<p>you know, and it&rsquo;s just like, it was a convoluted fucking mess. So if I had to do it again, if I were</p>
<p>him, or if I was his advisor, and he had asked me, you know, to proofread the essay, what I would</p>
<p>have said is more of the following, which is our mission, which is, you know, I think to create</p>
<p>financial liberty or something, something like that, you guys can find out what it is for the</p>
<p>whole world is unbelievably important. We will talk about every issue through the lens of achieving</p>
<p>our mission. And we will be disciplined about saying which things matter and which things don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So for example, if somebody says, Listen, I really believe in spaying and neutering dogs,</p>
<p>the right answer shouldn&rsquo;t be Hey, shut the fuck up. It says, Okay,</p>
<p>um, how does that allow us to maximize our users? How does that allow us to achieve our mission?</p>
<p>Why does it allow us to achieve our mission? And if you ask the question, why, four or five times</p>
<p>in a very first principles way, you&rsquo;ll get to the answer. So I would have rather said,</p>
<p>we are going to train people how to understand what builds up to our mission, and what is</p>
<p>otherwise something that you should leave at home. And in that context, there are a lot of</p>
<p>things actually, that are political that need to be brought, especially into a company like Coinbase,</p>
<p>which is working in crypto, which is all about eliminating the financial barriers of people that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have access to it, like you are trying to dismantle an extremely exclusionary part of the</p>
<p>economy. And so there are potentially many movements that matter. And those movements</p>
<p>in countries in which you will want to gain users may look like political movements.</p>
<p>Well, and that was jack Dorsey&rsquo;s point he</p>
<p>so I just think, yeah, so I just think it was a it was a, it was kind of a</p>
<p>two super fit. It was very Silicon Valley esque reaction. It was emotional. It was a little</p>
<p>insecure. And it to me, it missed the mark, because there was a lot of validity in what he</p>
<p>was saying, but presented in an kind of in a lens of, you know, Silicon Valley bullshit,</p>
<p>and it was not well thought through. So if he had rewritten it, and he had said 99% of what he said,</p>
<p>but through the lens of why we&rsquo;re going to think about a first principles way of defining how</p>
<p>everything ladders into the mission, he will train his employees. Instead, what he created</p>
<p>was a schism at a decision point. And I&rsquo;m not sure that that&rsquo;s how you maximize value in 2020</p>
<p>as a CEO, because at the end of the day, you have to deal with an entire population cohort,</p>
<p>that is that are in their 20s, early 30s, teenagers that will eventually want to work for you.</p>
<p>And whether we like it or not, they&rsquo;re different. And one of the things you need to do if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to run an enormous company is understand the psychology of your employees, understand the</p>
<p>psychology of how movements and decisions are organized, and then play to win. And it&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>different than anybody else. If you want to be in the job, you know, to be the starting point</p>
<p>guard for the Warriors, you got to know how to fucking pass the ball. And if you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>the power forward, you have to know how to do a certain set of things that are different than</p>
<p>that. And so I would sort of have framed it there, because I think there was a lot of goodness in</p>
<p>what he said, but presented in a pretty shitty manner. I think it&rsquo;s good. He brought up the topic,</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s a tactical issue here. And he he could have laid out the ground rules for I think,</p>
<p>to your point, Chamath, of how we should talk about politics at work. And what are the ground</p>
<p>rules? I think the number one issue here, which people don&rsquo;t talk about, is that Slack, and email</p>
<p>and forums inside of companies have created a massive distraction. And when somebody goes into</p>
<p>the random channel, which is built into Slack, and I know this is in the weeds. But I have seen</p>
<p>this happen at multiple companies. Now, Slack infects a company, somebody creates a room about</p>
<p>a topic, whether it&rsquo;s Trump, or police violence, or immigration, whatever it is. And then people</p>
<p>want to sound off on that. And now you&rsquo;ve got an electronic form, where people are talking about</p>
<p>highly charged issues that makes people feel unsafe. And so what I told my companies was,</p>
<p>the two companies I run, you could talk about politics, if you want to go for a walk with</p>
<p>somebody and have coffee or lunch, and you want to have a two hour discussion about it, go for it.</p>
<p>Please do not put this in electronic form, because it&rsquo;s a massive distraction. And there&rsquo;ll be a</p>
<p>record that could create downstream human resources issues. So your report sacks,</p>
<p>I have a suggestion. And this is an organizational design experiment. And maybe somebody listening</p>
<p>will implement at their company, allow 100% free form debate about anything. One condition,</p>
<p>you literally need to have a soapbox. And like in the 1880s Hyde Park in London,</p>
<p>yeah, you put the soapbox someplace in a safe space where you can go and you can talk and people</p>
<p>who want to listen will listen. And people who need to work can work. And people who don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to listen don&rsquo;t have to be forced. What&rsquo;s the digital version of that that you&rsquo;re saying a</p>
<p>literal room, a literal campus, a literal place in your office, you put the soap, you have a</p>
<p>soapbox, you grab it, you put it on the ground, you stand on it, and you say it. And if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not willing to do that, then you know, it&rsquo;s okay. Are you saying that there&rsquo;s no digital version of</p>
<p>that? Because what I&rsquo;m saying is that two things. One is the digital version is actually training</p>
<p>people to ask why? Why does it matter? Now, the reason why it&rsquo;s important to ask that is because</p>
<p>somebody may say, I&rsquo;ll use Jason&rsquo;s example that he loves, we need to support the Uyghurs in China,</p>
<p>the best way to do that is to proliferate our software in the following way, because it will</p>
<p>free them from enslavement of the Chinese, and it will give them access to financial independence.</p>
<p>Wow. I mean, okay, that seems to be paying off the mission. So if you would, if so, you got to</p>
<p>give freedom for people to come up with these ideas, because it may the first version of this</p>
<p>idea may not actually be what the final version is, and the final version may be the killer</p>
<p>feature. So on the digital forum, in the slacks, it should be why? That&rsquo;s a very respectful question.</p>
<p>But David, it should not be in any digital forum, because it leads to chaos, because we see that on</p>
<p>Twitter. And what&rsquo;s happening is the Twitter derangement that we all suffer from is now</p>
<p>infected inside the communication system that runs the operating system of the company.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Since you agree with me, go ahead, Saks.</p>
<p>Yes, I do agree with you on this one. So look, I mean, Chamath is right that I&rsquo;m sure Chamath</p>
<p>would have written a better letter. But I think we understand the gist of what Brian was trying to</p>
<p>say. And actually, I thought it took a lot of courage to write it. And what he&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>saying is that politics has become so divisive in our society that, I mean, it&rsquo;d be nice if we could</p>
<p>have these reasonable debates the way that we&rsquo;re having this discussion inside companies, we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to have these artificial restrictions. But we do, we have to, you know, it&rsquo;s the same reason,</p>
<p>you know, that we have the separation of church and state is because people can stop killing each</p>
<p>other over religious wars. And so finally, we had, you know, the Treaty of Westphalia to stop it. And</p>
<p>what Brian&rsquo;s basically proposing is a treaty for the workplace, because we cannot get along</p>
<p>around politics.</p>
<p>But David, he is the CEO of an $8 billion company,</p>
<p>could he not have hired somebody to edit that essay?</p>
<p>Okay, well, I mean, look, I just, to me,</p>
<p>like if it&rsquo;s meaning if it&rsquo;s seriously, well thought through, and if it was as important</p>
<p>as Westphalia, you would probably have a couple of proofreaders.</p>
<p>Corporate, corporate version. Okay, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It could have been polished for sure. Here is Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s response. And I&rsquo;ll have you guys</p>
<p>respond to it. I think it&rsquo;s in your wheelhouse in terms of what you said, Chamath. Bitcoin,</p>
<p>aka crypto is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system,</p>
<p>which negatively affects so much of our society, important to at least acknowledge and connect the</p>
<p>related societal issues your customers face daily. This leaves people behind.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s right, you have to view this problem, not through the lens of your own emotions,</p>
<p>not even through the lens of the frustrations of your employees, you have to help shift the</p>
<p>discussion to say, why does this achieve our mission? And just constantly in a thoughtful,</p>
<p>respectful way, ask why and by the fourth or fifth why it will either be something that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter, and you can dismiss it quickly, or something that actually is rooted in fact,</p>
<p>and probably is something you need to pay attention to. And maybe the way that the</p>
<p>conversation started was probably not with the right language that people given the chance would</p>
<p>have framed it differently. Okay, the worst take, according to the internet&rsquo;s Twitter&rsquo;s ability to</p>
<p>ratio people, which is when you get more comments than likes, which is not normally how it works,</p>
<p>people actually taking the time to explain to you how bad your take was, as opposed to liking it</p>
<p>is what a ratio is, if you don&rsquo;t know, goes to Dick Costolo, who&rsquo;s a friend of ours.</p>
<p>Me first capitalists who think you can separate society from business are going to be the first</p>
<p>people lined up against the wall and shot in the revolution. I&rsquo;ll be happy. I mean, that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enough to get you ratioed and have this thing go supernova. I mean, Mike Cernovich is</p>
<p>retweeting this and losing, like his mind over it, you know, that the former CEO of Twitter is</p>
<p>inciting violence. He&rsquo;s a comedian as well. Dick Costolo. So I think he&rsquo;s joking here.</p>
<p>But he adds the explanation point. I&rsquo;ll happily provide video commentary.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my disagreement with Dick and with Jack is ultimately the societal value of a company</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come from whatever platitudes or political statements as its CEO makes, but rather from the</p>
<p>quality of its products and the impact of its products. And in that sense, Dick and Jack are</p>
<p>living in a glass house. I mean, Twitter is a sewer of political diatribe and polemical hate.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know anyone who feels better, you know, after spending time on Twitter.</p>
<p>You know, if Facebook is like cigarettes, you know, I don&rsquo;t know what Twitter is. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like fentanyl or something. Yeah. So, so, so ultimately, you know, maybe Jack should spend his</p>
<p>time figuring out how to make Twitter into a less socially divisive product instead of, you know,</p>
<p>because just issuing what platitudes is not going to do it. I agree with the, I agree with that. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think platitudes does it. All I&rsquo;m saying is, you have to view it through the lens of,</p>
<p>I want to become the most relevant company possible and achieve the most impact. And I</p>
<p>think that there are a lot of times where some of these issues, when presented politically,</p>
<p>underlying it is actually some feature or some capability, or some way of seeing the problem</p>
<p>that unlocks more demand that can help you win and not knowing a priori what the answers to those</p>
<p>questions are. It&rsquo;s important to train people on a framework versus say you can&rsquo;t talk because I</p>
<p>guarantee you what will happen is somebody with some killer feature will be too scared to say</p>
<p>something because they&rsquo;re not sure how to say it well. And you and I both know because we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>many companies that have gone through that cycle. Those companies decay and die.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;d be great if a policy like this wasn&rsquo;t necessary. I mean, it&rsquo;s I agree it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>suboptimal, but I think it&rsquo;s caused by the fact that people just can&rsquo;t get along around politics</p>
<p>anymore. Yeah. Friedberg, what is your take on ultimately how Coinbase winds up the year or two</p>
<p>after this? Do they get more resumes of hyper talented people who want to embrace a politics,</p>
<p>social issue free workplace? Or do millennials and you know, Gen Z and this next group of talented</p>
<p>folks say I don&rsquo;t want to work for somebody who doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about these issues at work?</p>
<p>And then at the production board where you have a factory where you build companies? Do you have</p>
<p>some rule around this yourself? Or thoughts about how you run your companies?</p>
<p>I think the more clearly you define culture, the more successful your company will be.</p>
<p>And right or wrong about whether or not you enable the debate in the discussion and how you define</p>
<p>the forums for kind of political discussion within your company. The fact that there is</p>
<p>a clear definition and delineation around this point, I think removes the uncertainty. And I</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;ll do exactly what he&rsquo;s hoping to do, which is to get people to leave and to attract</p>
<p>other people that better fit with that cultural model. I want to put my game face on. I want to</p>
<p>go to work and I want to win the game. I&rsquo;m here to play. I&rsquo;m not here to fuck around. I&rsquo;m not here</p>
<p>to do other stuff. I want this job because I believe in this mission. And I want this company</p>
<p>to succeed in what it&rsquo;s trying to do. And I think other places that allow people to run around and,</p>
<p>you know, do things that they may or may not appreciate other people doing, or if you have</p>
<p>this kind of low definition kind of culture, where some people are happy, some people are unhappy,</p>
<p>it all kind of, you know, slows things down. And I wouldn&rsquo;t kind of encourage anyone to</p>
<p>let that happen. I think it&rsquo;s really important to just define how it is you want to operate,</p>
<p>be really clear about the rules and the boundaries. And then</p>
<p>that I that I agree with as well. I mean, I think it&rsquo;s very much within his right. And I think it</p>
<p>took it I do applaud his courage in doing it. I just think that it misses the mark because I think</p>
<p>it was too emotional. I think he can do a 2.0 version and just keep building on the manifesto</p>
<p>and say, hey, based on the feedback I got, here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re going to do it. No discussion. He on the</p>
<p>Reed Hastings put out that fantastic PowerPoint that I think we all know really well, the cultural</p>
<p>playbook from Netflix. And when did he put that out? Like, almost a decade ago?</p>
<p>No, two decades ago was 2000 2001.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s continued to refine it, right? If you look at there&rsquo;s recent iterations of it,</p>
<p>and they continue to kind of do a better job of defining, you know, how do they intend to operate</p>
<p>with people? And I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s only continue to reinforce the innovation that drives that</p>
<p>company into the hundred billion dollar plus valuation it&rsquo;s earned.</p>
<p>Yes. And if you, if there&rsquo;s one important thing, which is that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>meaningful difference in the average age of a Netflix employee and the average age</p>
<p>of a Silicon Valley company. Now that may be also part of it as well.</p>
<p>I think the one thing that Brian could clarify is that you don&rsquo;t have to check your conscience</p>
<p>at the door. You it&rsquo;s not, we&rsquo;re not saying that you can&rsquo;t have political views. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>allowed to say things on Twitter or take political stands or donate to whoever you want. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that the company itself is going to be a demilitarized zone. You know, we&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to bring, we&rsquo;re not going to bring these contentious, divisive debates that really</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t related to our core mission inside the company. So we can all work better. So we can</p>
<p>all work better as a team towards the reason that we all joined this company.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s totally fair. But you know, all I&rsquo;m saying, all I&rsquo;m saying, again, I&rsquo;ll just say it</p>
<p>again. That is such an important thing to say. You could have had a proofread a couple of times.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Could have been, could have come across the way you&rsquo;re saying it.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have to be written by GPT-3. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Also, I think that it was the, the dunk he did afterwards where he&rsquo;s like, and</p>
<p>by the way, if you don&rsquo;t like it, here&rsquo;s four months severance, get the fuck out.</p>
<p>That was a pretty aggressive move as well. I don&rsquo;t know how you guys felt.</p>
<p>I think I like the gangster nature of it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s like, if I&rsquo;m on the team and I believe in what he just said,</p>
<p>I feel great that he&rsquo;s flushing the shit out. And if I don&rsquo;t agree with it, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>fuck yeah, I&rsquo;ll take it. You know, like it&rsquo;s really clear. And I think the clear cut definition</p>
<p>of culture is what every company needs to kind of pursue. And it&rsquo;s an ongoing pursuit,</p>
<p>and you can always do a better job with it.</p>
<p>And culture is what you choose not to do as much as it is what you do, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk about politics.</p>
<p>I think Friedberg is totally right. It takes a lot of courage to say, here&rsquo;s what I believe.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, if you don&rsquo;t believe in it, then it&rsquo;s okay for you to leave. And</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a severance package that takes a lot of courage. So I applaud him for that.</p>
<p>I mean, look, it&rsquo;s a free country, and we all have limited time. We should all go work on</p>
<p>the mission that is most important and inspiring to us. And Coinbase has a very specific mission</p>
<p>that Brian&rsquo;s defining. He&rsquo;s trying to find it clearly. And if that mission is important and</p>
<p>inspiring to you, then go work there. And if it&rsquo;s not, then go work at the place where the mission</p>
<p>does inspire you. And it may be a startup or maybe a political organization, whatever it is,</p>
<p>go do that thing that&rsquo;s most meaningful to you. That&rsquo;s kind of my interpretation of what he was</p>
<p>saying. All right, as we wrap here, it was hard for me to interpret because it was so poorly</p>
<p>written. Well, also, I mean, it was also like a huge bomb on Twitter. And people&rsquo;s reaction to</p>
<p>it was based upon, I think, how they feel at this moment in time. And a lot of people feel this is</p>
<p>why I&rsquo;m sorry, but communications is important. How you say things, what you say, style is really</p>
<p>important. So whether it&rsquo;s Biden or Brian, take the time, get it right.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right. So 2021 is going to be upon us before we know it. And I wanted to wrap here with</p>
<p>each of your feelings on the economy, technology and politics, economy, technology, politics,</p>
<p>how do you feel about 2021? Are you optimistic, pessimistic, neutral on those? Economy,</p>
<p>politics? Have you guys ever been to Magic Mountain? Or Disneyland? You ever get in one</p>
<p>of those log rides? And it&rsquo;s like raging rapids or roaring waters or whatever they&rsquo;re called?</p>
<p>Sure. And it&rsquo;s just fucking like you hop in and this thing just takes off down the river.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, nothing summarizes better for me. But in so many ways, is that where I feel we are</p>
<p>right now? We&rsquo;ve all jumped on a bunch of fucking logs, and we&rsquo;re shooting down this rapid river.</p>
<p>And I think a big part of what I&rsquo;m feeling and Chamath is in the middle of this. But there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this extraordinary velocity of capital right now. And when I say that, I just mean capital is moving</p>
<p>in large amounts very freely. And that creates like once in a generation kind of opportunity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in part because the Fed has dropped interest rates to zero. So there&rsquo;s all these trillions of</p>
<p>dollars moving markets, there&rsquo;s a change in outlook and the world is being shifted in so</p>
<p>many ways. This is this really amazing moment that I think we can all be afraid of because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re on a fucking roaring rapid on a log trying to stay afloat. But there is so much happening</p>
<p>in these markets that we kind of operate in. There&rsquo;s never been a better time to get your</p>
<p>business funded or to take your company public, or to get customers to make quick decisions and</p>
<p>change their behavior, whether they&rsquo;re a consumer or an enterprise customer. Money and decisions</p>
<p>are happening at a money&rsquo;s moving at a faster pace than we&rsquo;ve ever seen and decisions are</p>
<p>happening at a faster pace than we&rsquo;ve ever seen. That&rsquo;s my general sentiment. I don&rsquo;t think it</p>
<p>stops going into 2021. There&rsquo;s just another kind of floodgate about to open with this election one</p>
<p>way or the other. But these we&rsquo;re in the middle of this kind of raging rapids right now. And it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a pretty, it&rsquo;s a pretty scary, but also kind of exciting kind of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s so well said keen. Well, I really agree with you. I, I think that it&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>you used to take a second to make a $1 decision and a minute to take $100 decision, the amount</p>
<p>of money being flooded into the economy now allows you to make $100 decision in a second,</p>
<p>right? So like the order of magnitude of the mental barrier that it takes</p>
<p>has changed. And I agree with you. I was thinking earlier this week that it&rsquo;s really incredible time</p>
<p>to be alive for one very in one very specific way, which is obviously there&rsquo;s stuff that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening that&rsquo;s really turbulent. But there is a chance that a bunch of us can really</p>
<p>like, change things in a meaningful way. And I find it exciting. So I&rsquo;m generally like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super bullish on the economy, super bullish on tech. And I think I&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>kind of like, reasonably optimistic about politics, I think that we&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>our civility soon. And, and I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s going to happen or how it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>get triggered. But I think honestly, like the election of Biden will go such a long way to just,</p>
<p>um, you know, just showing what is rewarded, and then to figure out how to reward the folks that</p>
<p>were supporting Trump in the first place, for purposes of economic, you know, pushback,</p>
<p>could be a nice de escalation, in fact, and maybe an olive branch of Biden can bring that</p>
<p>Republican Party into the conversation. Yeah. And sax sax had this really beautiful thing that he</p>
<p>posted on Twitter, which was like, you know, a lot of San Francisco&rsquo;s dysfunction is really going</p>
<p>to spread wealth throughout the rest of the country. Because a lot of cities that were</p>
<p>shut out of all these tech gains will now see it. And now you can imagine all kinds of people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy that I, you know, follow on Twitter, he lives in Bowie, Maryland, he&rsquo;s a engineer at</p>
<p>VMware, this black guy, and he was just talking about how he got promoted, and he&rsquo;s now a principal</p>
<p>engineer. And, you know, and I just thought, like, this is really fucking cool, like there&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be all this redistribution of opportunity all around the country. And that&rsquo;ll happen because</p>
<p>of Coronavirus, because of people&rsquo;s frustration with California, because, you know, of a handful</p>
<p>of us, how fed up we&rsquo;ve gotten with the culture of Silicon Valley, including, by the way, right,</p>
<p>what Brian Armstrong wrote, which was, which, again, still very important. And so we&rsquo;ll all</p>
<p>be better off for that. So I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m pretty optimistic.</p>
<p>Sachs Tech Economy Politics 2021.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m super bullish about, you know, how about the entrepreneurial energy in the American</p>
<p>economy. It&rsquo;s 100 times greater than when we started out our careers in this business,</p>
<p>you know, 20 years ago, in terms of the number of companies that get funded, the ideas,</p>
<p>the tools that are available, the funding. I mean, when you think about it, this might be the</p>
<p>first time in human history where money is chasing the, like throwing money at the ideas. I mean,</p>
<p>throughout history, until I&rsquo;d say the last 10, 20 years ago, you know, the people who had no money,</p>
<p>but had great ideas, always had to go hat in hand to go find the capital. And now it&rsquo;s completely</p>
<p>the other way around. There&rsquo;s so many VCs, and they&rsquo;re all racing around trying to find the</p>
<p>people with ideas. And so- It was worse than that,</p>
<p>they had to go give their ideas to a big company and take a salary.</p>
<p>Right. Like so Tesla, you know, Nikola Tesla, the original inventor didn&rsquo;t profit at all from his</p>
<p>ideas, you know. And so that was pretty common. And so just this, just how entrepreneurial</p>
<p>the US economy has become, I&rsquo;m very, the new economy is completely taken over and I&rsquo;m bullish</p>
<p>on that. I think the, you know, the tweet that Chamath was referencing, you know, I said that</p>
<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s loss is going to be America&rsquo;s gain, the rest of America&rsquo;s gain, because</p>
<p>middle America was really left out of the new economy. It&rsquo;s just not where it was taking place.</p>
<p>And so, you know, globalization really gutted industrial America, agricultural America,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t get to participate in the enormous wealth creation of the last two or three decades.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, I guess, you know, because of what San Francisco has done</p>
<p>in terms of driving out companies, I think the companies are going to be, you know,</p>
<p>tech companies are going to be all over the US now.</p>
<p>Yeah, totally. It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s fucking awesome.</p>
<p>Should be super interesting. And so let&rsquo;s just lay the odds as we wrap here on Biden winning.</p>
<p>Biden, 65, 35, approaching 70, 30.</p>
<p>Okay. David, you got a handicap for me on Biden winning?</p>
<p>What do you think, Sax?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the betting line is like, somewhere in the 60 to 70% range. And so you&rsquo;d have to say</p>
<p>that the betting markets are probably, you know, pretty accurate. I guess, you know, probably there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a 70% chance of him winning if I had to bet on that line. I&rsquo;d probably take the 30% underdog,</p>
<p>because I think, you know, there&rsquo;s all, things are so in so much turmoil right now that anything</p>
<p>could still happen.</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s a chance that Trump could win?</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s probably bigger than 30%. Yeah, it&rsquo;s probably bigger,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s slightly bigger than what the betting markets are giving him credit for.</p>
<p>Friedberg, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Probably right. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t have anything to add to that.</p>
<p>All right. Any spackulation that we want to end with, Chamath, on the, I just noticed that Emile</p>
<p>from Uber is doing a spack. Mark Pincus is doing a spack. Everybody&rsquo;s doing spacks now.</p>
<p>Any spackulation on what we&rsquo;re going to see in that market?</p>
<p>Nope. God bless them. And I love you all, besties.</p>
<p>All right, besties.</p>
<p>Back to the grind.</p>
<p>Back to the grind. We&rsquo;ll see you next time. You know what to do, share this podcast with</p>
<p>your friends. If you&rsquo;d like to advertise on the All In podcast, you can&rsquo;t. And so the best you</p>
<p>can do is write a review or clip it, and we&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the All In podcast. Bye-bye.</p>
