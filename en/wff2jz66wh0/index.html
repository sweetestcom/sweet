symptoms did</p><p>you have when you&rsquo;re a heavy like what</p><p>kind of we said you felt bad was it</p><p>fatigue was it memory what was it um</p><p>well it was</p><p>I really was had no stamina which I have</p><p>you know been better off you know and</p><p>previously like I said I have a physical</p><p>job clean homes I also have a little</p><p>farm you know come family farm so you</p><p>know I&rsquo;m hauling feed bags and throwing</p><p>him around and I&rsquo;m fairly strong but I</p><p>would just like then go sit down</p><p>and you know if there was many stairs or</p><p>anything I mean I could do it but I was</p><p>very winded and I could tell it was it</p><p>was worse than I had imagined from you</p><p>know previous exertion so I was kind of</p><p>getting worried that I really had</p><p>something wrong with me but now I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>go to the doctor I had no pant you know</p><p>blood panels done or anything but I want</p><p>to tell you that since you know I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been you know watching the videos and</p><p>everything that you have that about</p><p>maybe 18 months ago I had I was having</p><p>an eye problem still I am but what they</p><p>said to me was are you diabetic and then</p><p>I thought well no I&rsquo;m not I haven&rsquo;t been</p><p>to the doctor how do I know by this very</p><p>fast growing cataract in one of my eyes</p><p>and since I went I mean it&rsquo;s completely</p><p>clouded I&rsquo;m blind in one eye basically</p><p>and so I do need to you know get that</p><p>taken care of that I&rsquo;m hoping and that</p><p>will be one of my questions for you if</p><p>you think with the with some of your the</p><p>NAC drops and changing my diet if it can</p><p>ever be fully reversed but sorry to get</p><p>off on it - you know I think let&rsquo;s not</p><p>let&rsquo;s talk about that right now</p><p>do you have any at all sensation</p><p>tingling burning numbness in your</p><p>fingers or your toes no okay good</p><p>cataracts usually are related to blood</p><p>sugars but it&rsquo;s also a very severe b1</p><p>deficiency</p><p>I have nutritional yeast tablets that</p><p>are non fortified</p><p>there really may have some b12 but</p><p>that&rsquo;s probably a good source to be one</p><p>I would probably take six of those a day</p><p>and and those drops and then continue on</p><p>the eating plan because I think and I&rsquo;m</p><p>not making any claim sir I think that</p><p>can greatly improve your situation</p><p>I&rsquo;m not saying a hundred percent but</p><p>maybe but I would go in that direction</p><p>because especially because think about</p><p>what happens with the diabetic the eyes</p><p>are the first to go and a lot of</p><p>diabetics have cataracts and the B</p><p>vitamins get depleted with sugar yes and</p><p>so I&rsquo;m just really I never knew all of</p><p>this till I started watching your videos</p><p>and then you know reading more about</p><p>what causes them and that now I feel</p><p>terrible that this could have been</p><p>prevented and and the other thing that</p><p>stuck in my mind was so I went through</p><p>the whole test to have the surgery last</p><p>the end of last year but I didn&rsquo;t want</p><p>to meet I hadn&rsquo;t met my deductible and I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t want to meet at that end of the</p><p>year so I thought huh I&rsquo;ll wait till the</p><p>beginning of the year then my new</p><p>insurance didn&rsquo;t take that doctor so</p><p>which is why I have not gotten it done</p><p>yet but I remember sitting in his office</p><p>thinking and I asked him that like well</p><p>what has cost this he&rsquo;s not the one that</p><p>said it it was like an optometrist so</p><p>they sent me to the ophthalmologist and</p><p>I said well I grew up in Florida I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been in the Sun my whole life and he</p><p>said this isn&rsquo;t from the Sun and I</p><p>thought oh but you know he didn&rsquo;t really</p><p>go any farther than that but he said but</p><p>if you have it in one you will have it</p><p>in the other it&rsquo;s just a matter of time</p><p>and I just left the office being like</p><p>depressed because having one vision in</p><p>one eye because now I mean I can see</p><p>light but no color it&rsquo;s completely</p><p>opaque I guess that&rsquo;s the right word and</p><p>because of how your eyes work together</p><p>I&rsquo;m like feeling like I&rsquo;m cross-eyed all</p><p>the time anyway so</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t the main reason because I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>realize it at the time but now I&rsquo;m</p><p>really thinking is it was cost for my</p><p>diet yeah I mean it&rsquo;s uh never know that</p><p>well I think it&rsquo;s the most obvious thing</p><p>and the the challenge of the medical</p><p>profession is they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re stuck in</p><p>this well we don&rsquo;t know yet we have to</p><p>do research this L is this big it&rsquo;s a</p><p>big lack of connection between what you</p><p>put in your mouth and then because they</p><p>don&rsquo;t understand through therapy</p><p>everyone they it gets worse so like well</p><p>you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s inevitable it&rsquo;s nothing you</p><p>can do the point is that if you do some</p><p>research just type in cataracts and b1</p><p>deficiency and you&rsquo;ll find all this</p><p>interesting data but if you actually had</p><p>years of become becoming depleted that</p><p>lack of b1 affects the chemistry of all</p><p>sorts of things in all the cells so you</p><p>know sometimes it&rsquo;ll affect the feet</p><p>sometimes it affects the retina</p><p>sometimes it affects the lens of the eye</p><p>just affects everyone differently but I</p><p>think you&rsquo;re on the right track I would</p><p>like you can see what it is right now I</p><p>would continue this and just see if it</p><p>improves over the next few months with</p><p>what you do but the body the body can</p><p>change I mean you&rsquo;d be surprised I had</p><p>one guy he came to my office and he laid</p><p>on the table and his arms and his legs</p><p>completely went dead when he had lay</p><p>down he wasn&rsquo;t even concerned about that</p><p>I&rsquo;m like aren&rsquo;t you worried about the</p><p>guys no it&rsquo;s fine so because even he</p><p>stands up he can just pound them and get</p><p>him back to work so I found out what</p><p>he&rsquo;s eating he&rsquo;s having pancakes a big</p><p>stack of pancakes the best not the</p><p>problem it&rsquo;s the cup 12 ounce cup of</p><p>maple syrup which is high fructose corn</p><p>syrup He pours on there and that&rsquo;s what</p><p>he consumes for his breakfast I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>want to talk about his lunches dinner so</p><p>I told him I said dude that&rsquo;s going to</p><p>kill you that is gonna kill you but he</p><p>just he just wasn&rsquo;t aware he wasn&rsquo;t</p><p>interested at that point he was a</p><p>typical guy like you have to be nearly</p><p>dead well anyway months later he came my</p><p>office with glasses I walked in the room</p><p>and he had dark glasses on</p><p>and he had a cane and his sister was</p><p>with him he was blind now he&rsquo;s living a</p><p>life of Darkness I&rsquo;m like completely</p><p>unavailable I mean if you would have</p><p>just done something you know wake up I</p><p>mean take care of your body you got to</p><p>live in your body so then he came in he</p><p>wanted to do something about it</p><p>can you help me I&rsquo;m like no it&rsquo;s too far</p><p>gone what were were you you know months</p><p>ago that&rsquo;s not gonna happen to you but</p><p>getting back to your weight like you</p><p>were 190 like what are you now I&rsquo;m right</p><p>now i&rsquo;m 154 wow that&rsquo;s incredible yeah</p><p>and so I&rsquo;ve had a little ways to go just</p><p>for my personal preference but I feel so</p><p>much better in so many other ways except</p><p>for my I you know more stamina just feel</p><p>healthier in general and um you know I</p><p>just don&rsquo;t know why that we are not told</p><p>this this is why it&rsquo;s hard for me to</p><p>believe but but the interesting thing is</p><p>that my mom was a diabetes education</p><p>nurse before she retired and did she</p><p>ever tell me any thing about sugar</p><p>no she liked when I would be dieting at</p><p>different times she would say oh well</p><p>you know complex carbohydrates missus</p><p>the peanut butter with the cracker and</p><p>I&rsquo;m thinking why but now why the cracker</p><p>you know and so I never heard it from</p><p>her she taught people not her fault</p><p>because I&rsquo;m sure she was you know had to</p><p>go to her seee classes to eat you</p><p>classes by the sugar you know that&rsquo;s</p><p>funded by big sugar I&rsquo;m sure of what she</p><p>you know the food pyramid and all that</p><p>um and I&rsquo;m yeah it&rsquo;s not her fault but</p><p>I&rsquo;m just wondering like I had never</p><p>heard that but fat you know some fats in</p><p>moderation are okay here I&rsquo;m cutting</p><p>every all the fat out and not worrying</p><p>about the carbs you know or the you</p><p>know sugar</p><p>so it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s amazing to me like</p><p>there&rsquo;s even certain doctors that are</p><p>saying the problem is the saturated fats</p><p>you have to get off the saturated fats</p><p>sugars are okay yeah so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p><p>frustrating but unfortunately yeah we&rsquo;re</p><p>basically in this kind of a trap</p><p>of getting the wrong information and we</p><p>keep getting worse and you almost have</p><p>to stumble on it you know here and there</p><p>and because if you even search on how to</p><p>get healthy how to lose weight on the</p><p>internet the top page is WebMD I mean it</p><p>just goes right to the list it&rsquo;s hard to</p><p>find the truth on on health when you do</p><p>searches on the internet so right well</p><p>now I my mom has to I be just so you</p><p>know and it&rsquo;s very hard although I we</p><p>don&rsquo;t live in the same city so and I do</p><p>talk to her every day but it&rsquo;s hard for</p><p>me because I&rsquo;m not an expert to educate</p><p>the educator because I just think that</p><p>she has that&rsquo;s just you know she&rsquo;s kind</p><p>of old school that way and you know when</p><p>I&rsquo;m hearing you know about what they had</p><p>for dinner or whatever and my brother</p><p>goes over there sometimes and there&rsquo;s</p><p>lots of cookie wrappers like why are you</p><p>even eating those you know like I she</p><p>shouldn&rsquo;t be so anyway um you know I&rsquo;ve</p><p>got to figure out how to address that in</p><p>a way that can you know they don&rsquo;t have</p><p>internet or I&rsquo;d be sending her to your</p><p>channel I mean you know they&rsquo;re old</p><p>school they don&rsquo;t have a smartphone it</p><p>sounds like the more educated the more</p><p>educated someone is the harder it is to</p><p>them to be willing to learn something so</p><p>yeah I&rsquo;m gonna take these people that</p><p>have like really so-called trained in</p><p>the wrong information they&rsquo;ve such fixed</p><p>ideas it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s tough I mean it&rsquo;s</p><p>run into them all the time I know I</p><p>could only imagine it especially if your</p><p>mom taught it like it&rsquo;d be like well</p><p>wait a second um I taught this you know</p><p>so yeah no I&rsquo;m just trying to you know</p><p>maybe be an example she hasn&rsquo;t seen me</p><p>in a long time so but</p><p>I mean I&rsquo;ve told her I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ve cut</p><p>this out or cut that out but I haven&rsquo;t</p><p>even I did at the beginning of year get</p><p>a membership to a gym with a friend of</p><p>mine but then I just you know heard in</p><p>one of your videos you know don&rsquo;t work</p><p>out too hard because of the cortisol you</p><p>know just walk or you know do do some</p><p>cardio but don&rsquo;t do anything too</p><p>strenuous because it&rsquo;s you know maybe</p><p>later on when you get where you want to</p><p>be um so I haven&rsquo;t been there too often</p><p>but I have you know do see this friend</p><p>of mine that we joined together and I</p><p>have lost a lot of weight and she has</p><p>lost probably not very much but she</p><p>hasn&rsquo;t really changed her diet so but</p><p>she was very impressed so I you know</p><p>gave her sent her a few links to</p><p>different videos to watch because I just</p><p>think until people do it you do not</p><p>realize how it works and I probably</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t have either and it&rsquo;s I mean I</p><p>can follow directions and I can stick to</p><p>things if I see results I guess that was</p><p>the thing that really helped me is</p><p>because you know it took a few several</p><p>weeks but you know it was 2 pounds 2</p><p>more pounds um it was enough and it</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t just the weight it was the way my</p><p>clothes were fitting which was you know</p><p>I knew something was going on with that</p><p>but I was just feeling so much better</p><p>and you know most of the cravings have</p><p>gone every now and then I think about a</p><p>Publix cupcake and I wonder if they</p><p>taste the same but I just don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s not</p><p>worth it to me and I&rsquo;ve had family</p><p>members say are you just never gonna eat</p><p>sugar again and I&rsquo;m like maybe you know</p><p>probably because it&rsquo;s bad for you but</p><p>you know I don&rsquo;t get on my Bandstand but</p><p>they just said well I don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>deprive myself and I&rsquo;m thinking of being</p><p>healthy but you know that&rsquo;s just where I</p><p>am in my mind and they&rsquo;re not there so</p><p>hey well can I show you something yes so</p><p>that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I</p><p>personally I like ice cream so I I now</p><p>have a nice</p><p>there&rsquo;s no sugar we&rsquo;re working on trying</p><p>to get in the grocery stores but it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna take a long time but the point is</p><p>that when you eat the problem with sugar</p><p>is it has 23 grams 20 actually 36 grams</p><p>of sugar that&rsquo;s even per serving that&rsquo;s</p><p>1/2 of a cup you know so so we&rsquo;ll have a</p><p>zero sugar and I just sent it to one of</p><p>my diabetic patients who is recovering</p><p>and doing great so I had her test it it</p><p>barely increased her blood Sugar&rsquo;s so</p><p>that&rsquo;s cool so anyway like well we know</p><p>now we have to put some chocolate in</p><p>there so I want to show you this right</p><p>here I don&rsquo;t know if you can see it see</p><p>this right here oh yes this here is I</p><p>found an artesian chocolate artist spade</p><p>he&rsquo;s an artist because he he makes the</p><p>best chocolate and I wanted him to make</p><p>it with a monk fruit which actually has</p><p>it&rsquo;s better than Steven because there&rsquo;s</p><p>no not to taste okay I&rsquo;ve seen that at</p><p>the store from the extractor it&rsquo;s with</p><p>the stevia monk fruit and I wondered</p><p>it&rsquo;s a really good sugar a bit pricey</p><p>but it&rsquo;s a really good sugar because it</p><p>has no aftertaste it&rsquo;s really sweet so</p><p>anyway we&rsquo;ve made the chocolate zero</p><p>sugars so I really like it so when I&rsquo;m</p><p>done with this Skype I&rsquo;m gonna go</p><p>upstairs to my staff and I&rsquo;m gonna give</p><p>them samples and see if they like it but</p><p>I&rsquo;m trying to find you know an</p><p>alternative so a person wouldn&rsquo;t have to</p><p>give up everything they can actually</p><p>have just alternative type things I mean</p><p>like Halloween for example did you have</p><p>any trick-or-treaters no well I live out</p><p>on property so I have a gate so now so I</p><p>mean I think the trick-or-treaters that</p><p>came to my house last year basically</p><p>we&rsquo;re gonna tour the paper my house</p><p>because we gave these little toys and</p><p>pens and they&rsquo;re like what is this you</p><p>know so it&rsquo;s really hard to have some</p><p>alternative stuff so I mean sooner or</p><p>later I mean we start off eating sugar</p><p>at such an early age and we just keep</p><p>feeding these kids and you know I I&rsquo;m</p><p>like the perfect example and then we get</p><p>older and we wondering like why is our</p><p>body just going downhill so there has to</p><p>be some substitute verses you can&rsquo;t ever</p><p>eat sugar again</p><p>that&rsquo;s the point but like what are there</p><p>have you noticed that your cognitive</p><p>function is improved at all yes I would</p><p>say so I think that I mean of course if</p><p>you know you&rsquo;re tired you might not be</p><p>as sharp but definitely so I just feel</p><p>sharper in general I think because I</p><p>just feel you know when I get up in the</p><p>morning I&rsquo;m ready to go and I do get</p><p>tired you know but I get up early so you</p><p>know by 10:00 o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;m kind of shot</p><p>but yes that is definitely better and</p><p>then what about when do you eat what&rsquo;s</p><p>your first meal of the day what times</p><p>well if I&rsquo;m home you probably like it</p><p>around 11 ish um like if I&rsquo;m gonna be</p><p>home for the day and that I did have a</p><p>question for you about that because I</p><p>always try to get in my kale shake so I</p><p>know a lot of people eat that with their</p><p>breakfast um sometimes I just have that</p><p>for breakfast I mean that&rsquo;s enough so</p><p>I&rsquo;m not gonna eat it if I&rsquo;m you know</p><p>more if I&rsquo;m not hungry but the problem</p><p>but um I just</p><p>my question is because I am trying to do</p><p>the intermittent fasting but like like</p><p>this morning well I was a little hungry</p><p>and I wanted to get the kale shaken and</p><p>now I won&rsquo;t probably be home till 5:00</p><p>or 6:00 so I&rsquo;m gonna try not to eat</p><p>anything you know at all till I get home</p><p>but I didn&rsquo;t have anything else you know</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t have eggs so I don&rsquo;t know if</p><p>that&rsquo;s gonna last me but um I just</p><p>wondered like if you have that for a</p><p>snack I mean I know you don&rsquo;t promote</p><p>snacking but if I was to have a snack</p><p>you know if I just couldn&rsquo;t make it does</p><p>that raise your blood sugar</p><p>not too much not too much I mean if you</p><p>take it like what I do in the morning</p><p>good amount of the time is I&rsquo;ll get up I</p><p>get a bit like five but then about 8</p><p>o&rsquo;clock</p><p>I&rsquo;ll take I freeze my kale it&rsquo;s all</p><p>chopped I put it in the blender</p><p>I actually fill the blender one third</p><p>filled I have a pretty powerful blender</p><p>I&rsquo;ll put a cup of blueberries I&rsquo;ll put</p><p>two teaspoons of the lemon wheatgrass</p><p>just because</p><p>give it a little bit of a sweet fill the</p><p>whole thing with water blend it up for</p><p>four minutes and then I don&rsquo;t fill the</p><p>whole thing up with water just like</p><p>right above the 1/3 because it&rsquo;ll raise</p><p>the foam will come up so I&rsquo;ll blend it</p><p>performance more four minutes and I&rsquo;ll</p><p>actually take I have the big mason jars</p><p>which is it&rsquo;ll make three and a half of</p><p>those Wow</p><p>so I&rsquo;ll drink two of them I&rsquo;ll give one</p><p>to my wife if she wants it and that&rsquo;s my</p><p>kind of my greens for the whole day</p><p>like if I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;ll do that which is</p><p>tremendous amount of greens I might have</p><p>a little salad later but you can do it</p><p>in the morning and then have your lunch</p><p>and then your dinner and it&rsquo;s really</p><p>like I would say it&rsquo;s two and a half</p><p>meals because it&rsquo;s not gonna spike</p><p>insulin okay oh it&rsquo;s gonna be minor that</p><p>makes me feel better because I was I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t want to cut that out but</p><p>sometimes I&rsquo;m not home at lunch to have</p><p>it then but I need something in the</p><p>morning but I might not want that and</p><p>eggs or I don&rsquo;t have time to make it all</p><p>so when I eat my eggs and bacon and</p><p>cheese for its really my late morning</p><p>which is about twelve my breakfast</p><p>I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m like I can&rsquo;t eat a lot of</p><p>salad or greens at that point so I might</p><p>have my greens either later in the</p><p>afternoon</p><p>or for dinner or I&rsquo;ll have them early in</p><p>the morning so so you do two meals a day</p><p>yeah and give me an example of if you</p><p>weren&rsquo;t gonna do like cat what what</p><p>would you eat for your lunch sometimes</p><p>I&rsquo;ll have a lot of times I&rsquo;ll have</p><p>celery with peanut butter a little</p><p>peanut butter or eggs trying to think</p><p>I&rsquo;m salad you know I try to mix it up a</p><p>little bit I could sometimes I could eat</p><p>the same thing you know day after day so</p><p>but usually or I may just have a big you</p><p>know two or three eggs and a little</p><p>bacon just just kind of depends by I</p><p>didn&rsquo;t eat a lot of celery because</p><p>I like it and it with a little peanut</p><p>butter it&rsquo;s a great meal and people will</p><p>probably say well that&rsquo;s not gonna hold</p><p>me but I think after you&rsquo;ve gotten used</p><p>to eating less because I&rsquo;m really not</p><p>that hungry so that&rsquo;s what I like so</p><p>what do you have for dinner um usually</p><p>you know some kind of lean meat chicken</p><p>or maybe some kind of hamburger</p><p>you know usually something on the grill</p><p>some kind of lean meat</p><p>well it&rsquo;s not always lean chicken or</p><p>hamburger meat loaf I make meatloaf with</p><p>pork rinds that&rsquo;s a favorite and</p><p>vegetable or salad or both just have</p><p>eliminated the starch where I used to</p><p>always when I planned my meal think Oh</p><p>know what first side rice-a-roni know</p><p>and my daughter sometimes when she comes</p><p>to visit well she&rsquo;s used to it now but</p><p>um you know you just get used to eating</p><p>that for so long you think that&rsquo;s what</p><p>you should eat anyway I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p><p>miss it we do eat a lot of salads I get</p><p>the big box from like Walmart of the</p><p>organic spring mix or something so we do</p><p>eat a lot of that and I go through</p><p>several bills bags of kale a week</p><p>awesome</p><p>no sweets no desserts although I do</p><p>sometimes make a cheesecake because you</p><p>can have cream cheese with a little</p><p>stevia and eggs and that&rsquo;s pretty nice</p><p>it&rsquo;s pretty good is that uh yeah I like</p><p>to take um</p><p>grass-fed whipping cream put a little</p><p>stevia in there and whip it up it&rsquo;s like</p><p>I mean that&rsquo;s a dessert right there</p><p>right good yes it definitely makes me</p><p>more</p><p>what&rsquo;s the word creative creative</p><p>because um you know I do I do still like</p><p>sweet but I definitely don&rsquo;t crave them</p><p>and I have I don&rsquo;t really think I&rsquo;ll</p><p>fall off that wagon anytime soon just</p><p>because it&rsquo;s so it was just so bad for</p><p>me</p><p>and I just I never realized how bad it&rsquo;s</p><p>like a conspiracy oh yeah I know and</p><p>it&rsquo;s sometimes it takes a health problem</p><p>to motivate people I mean honestly I had</p><p>to get to the point where my eyes were</p><p>bloodshot and fatigued before I said</p><p>okay maybe I should change I mean you&rsquo;re</p><p>awesome I probably would have kept going</p><p>but this is awesome Sean I really</p><p>appreciate just kind of sharing your</p><p>story I think it&rsquo;ll just help people to</p><p>realize that they can do it there&rsquo;s</p><p>another way and I would say one for one</p><p>every single person that I talked to</p><p>once they get to this state they&rsquo;re not</p><p>going back because that now they know</p><p>the difference in like why would I go</p><p>back to sugar right and I guess what I&rsquo;m</p><p>wondering and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just like</p><p>the pharmaceuticals you know when</p><p>there&rsquo;s so much money to be lost why</p><p>aren&rsquo;t we telling you know kids young</p><p>not to do this because I just never</p><p>thought it was the only harmful that</p><p>would come to me would be a cavity not</p><p>diabetes or you know a cataract or you</p><p>know the laundry list of other problems</p><p>from it&rsquo;s not just overeating I mean yes</p><p>I was overweight but it was like you</p><p>said at the cellular level what what was</p><p>happening from from the sugar and you</p><p>know it feeds probably cancer so anyway</p><p>I really wish I had heard sooner but</p><p>anybody that will listen I&rsquo;m not</p><p>obnoxious but I I want them to know that</p><p>there&rsquo;s a you know it&rsquo;s easier if</p><p>there&rsquo;s an easier way but you do have to</p><p>stick to it I think that brings up just</p><p>a key point that I want to talk about</p><p>just real briefly is that my whole thing</p><p>is I just like to help people that want</p><p>how</p><p>so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m always telling people</p><p>spread the word start telling your</p><p>friends and there&rsquo;s certain people that</p><p>are ready and willing and interested</p><p>other people are not so that&rsquo;s totally</p><p>fine you could do what you want but</p><p>those people that are interested in</p><p>being educated on a better way to do it</p><p>those are the people that I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m</p><p>interested in working with so definite</p><p>we just have to spread the word because</p><p>there are people out there that are</p><p>interested willing they want to get</p><p>better and they want to try a new thing</p><p>and they&rsquo;re sick of being tired and fat</p><p>and enflamed you know right yes that&rsquo;s</p><p>that&rsquo;s I would say that&rsquo;s probably what</p><p>I was I&rsquo;m sure I had all kinds of</p><p>inflammation and you know every part of</p><p>my body and so it just sort of</p><p>manifested itself with my eye problem</p><p>but I just know I was definitely I was</p><p>just so sluggish well you saw my picture</p><p>I sent in I mean not only did I lose</p><p>weight but it I feel like I act younger</p><p>but I think I look younger which I&rsquo;m</p><p>sure there&rsquo;s some connection there I</p><p>think so you get healthy on the inside</p><p>it shows up on the outside so what we&rsquo;ll</p><p>have to do is do another video and let&rsquo;s</p><p>say four months okay and then we&rsquo;ll talk</p><p>about your I talk about your weight and</p><p>and just see how much will this compare</p><p>this video to the next one so we&rsquo;ll do</p><p>like a transition I think that&rsquo;d be a</p><p>great video yes that&rsquo;d be great can I</p><p>ask you one question</p><p>I know in one of your twelve several of</p><p>your videos you talked about autoimmune</p><p>because you know how it manifests itself</p><p>in different ways but you have to get to</p><p>the source of the problem well my mom</p><p>who has has diabetes but she also has</p><p>sarcoidosis which is the autoimmune</p><p>problem that affects her lung it can</p><p>affect your heart but with her it&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot of scarring in the lung so my</p><p>question is she&rsquo;s has to take prednisone</p><p>she was diagnosed with this in 2000 so</p><p>and it&rsquo;s you know she&rsquo;s really struggled</p><p>with it you know a difference she&rsquo;s been</p><p>in the hospital numerous times for</p><p>pneumonia which you always have to I</p><p>mean it doesn&rsquo;t cost pneumonia but</p><p>because your lungs are so compromised</p><p>she ends up sometimes in the ICU but my</p><p>question is and I don&rsquo;t know I haven&rsquo;t</p><p>really asked her about this I&rsquo;m not sure</p><p>if her diabetes was caused from</p><p>long-term prednisone use but if it is</p><p>can that I mean she can&rsquo;t stop taking</p><p>prednisone because that&rsquo;s what controls</p><p>the inflammation but I guess my question</p><p>is could that be could her diabetes be</p><p>reversed if she eliminated the cookies</p><p>waffles muffins you know your whole list</p><p>of sweets breads or no because of the</p><p>prednisone well do you know do you know</p><p>what prednisone is a hormone you know</p><p>which one it is</p><p>cortisol you know what gland makes it um</p><p>the adrenals mm-hmm so here she is</p><p>taking an adrenal hormone to help</p><p>suppress her sarcoid or sarcoidosis</p><p>right right because it&rsquo;s an</p><p>anti-inflammatory and also it helps it&rsquo;s</p><p>given to almost every autoimmune case so</p><p>that&rsquo;s interesting like you&rsquo;re taking</p><p>something to give to support the adrenal</p><p>to help your autoimmune simply because</p><p>the actual root cause is the weak in</p><p>adrenal in the first place because it&rsquo;s</p><p>that hormone naturally cortisol is not</p><p>working to to regulate the immune system</p><p>so at some point something shifted</p><p>probably related to stress or something</p><p>and then what happened is the immune</p><p>system started doing a self attack and</p><p>now she&rsquo;s stuck doing that and yes</p><p>taking prednisone one of the big side</p><p>effects is it turns your muscles into</p><p>sugar it increases the sugar way way up</p><p>and it burns out the cells of the</p><p>pancreas causing diabetes and it&rsquo;s right</p><p>in Cybil encyclopedia for endocrinology</p><p>page 86 it talks to right about the</p><p>relationship between high levels of</p><p>cortisone or prednisone and diabetes</p><p>so yeah that&rsquo;s probably what caused it</p><p>now she would have to be really willing</p><p>to you know try different ways support</p><p>the adrenals with nutrition for a period</p><p>of time changed the diet get on in a</p><p>minute fasting that will then stimulate</p><p>a toughie gene start cleaning up all the</p><p>inflammation and old cells and start</p><p>reversing this process I think she could</p><p>if she was willing to make changes but</p><p>yeah it&rsquo;s um I mean you can see the down</p><p>little effect from stress to drug to</p><p>diabetes to so you have to I mean it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s not that complex when you</p><p>understand some of these key points but</p><p>all right okay well I it&rsquo;s definitely</p><p>worth looking into</p><p>for her if I could just get her mind to</p><p>shift about it because who wants to be</p><p>sick but I think she&rsquo;s about giving up</p><p>that that&rsquo;s this will be her quality of</p><p>life which is really not too good right</p><p>yeah give it a shot see if she&rsquo;s willing</p><p>to look at it I think that&rsquo;s the key is</p><p>uh will you please watch a video or</p><p>something and see what she says right</p><p>I&rsquo;ll let you know okay great well thanks</p><p>a lot I appreciate it all your help and</p><p>what you&rsquo;re doing for everyone my</p><p>friends Wendy by the way Wendy Patton oh</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve interviewed her</p><p>or not but um I know sometimes she&rsquo;s on</p><p>your life you know she asks question on</p><p>your live show wendypatton but anyway</p><p>she&rsquo;s the one that um has been you know</p><p>spreading the word so I have her to</p><p>thank because you know that&rsquo;s why I try</p><p>to tell people because it you know I</p><p>just I don&rsquo;t know why it stuck in my</p><p>mind about you know that day with her</p><p>but it definitely is life-changing for</p><p>me because I just can hardly believe it</p><p>um but it&rsquo;s but it works that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>well Thank You Wendy for spreading the</p><p>word because look what happened look</p><p>what you created right here that&rsquo;s</p><p>awesome</p><p>all right you have a great Oh I&rsquo;ll let</p><p>up talk to you in a few months</p><p>okay good okay thank you you&rsquo;re
