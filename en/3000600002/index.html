    <ul>
<li>So, good afternoon everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the dean of the Haas School of Business.</p>
<p>Welcome to today&rsquo;s Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series.</p>
<p>As you may know, our flagship dean speaker series</p>
<p>invites preeminent business leaders to share their insights</p>
<p>with our community.</p>
<p>I am so excited today,</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how excited I am</p>
<p>to welcome two exceptional leaders</p>
<p>who are actually members of our very own faculty.</p>
<p>They are trailblazing women in their fields</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re using their academic chops for the public good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with Ulrike.</p>
<p>Ulrike Malmendier is the Edward J. and Mollie Arnold</p>
<p>professor of finance at Haas,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s also a professor in the economics department.</p>
<p>She received a PhD in business economics</p>
<p>from Harvard University and a PhD in law</p>
<p>from the University of Bonn.</p>
<p>Ulrike studies economics and finance with a behavioral lens.</p>
<p>She looks at why and how people make mistakes</p>
<p>and why often decisions are biased</p>
<p>and deviate from the classical economic paradigm.</p>
<p>Her work stands out for its originality and creativity.</p>
<p>An example is her Depression Baby paper.</p>
<p>In it she shows that the economic conditions that prevailed</p>
<p>when you were younger actually influenced your views</p>
<p>on money for life.</p>
<p>In 2013, Ulrike was awarded the prestigious</p>
<p>Fischer Black Prize from the American Finance Association.</p>
<p>That is given to the top finance scholar in the world</p>
<p>every other year under the age of 40.</p>
<p>That is the top prize in finance.</p>
<p>All the famous names you know in finance,</p>
<p>people like Fischer Black, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>get that award.</p>
<p>She also received UC Berkeley&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Distinguished Teaching Award.</p>
<p>Last year, Ulrike was appointed</p>
<p>to Germany&rsquo;s Council of Economic Experts,</p>
<p>which is the top advisory board to the national government.</p>
<p>As part of that council,</p>
<p>she is spending time with the heads of states</p>
<p>of all the major European countries.</p>
<p>The council has just issued its annual recommendations,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll hear more about in a moment.</p>
<p>Please welcome Professor Malmendier.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>So let me turn to Catherine.</p>
<p>Catherine Wolfram is the Cora Jane Flood</p>
<p>Professor of Business Administration at Haas.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s also served as our associate dean</p>
<p>for academic affairs</p>
<p>before she left regretfully for Washington.</p>
<p>She also served as the faculty director</p>
<p>of the Energy Institute at Haas.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s an affiliated member of ARE</p>
<p>in the College of Natural Resources.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s part of the Energy and Resource Group at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>And she was the program director</p>
<p>for the National Bureau of Economic Research&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Environment Energy Economics Program,</p>
<p>which is a top national program in the US</p>
<p>looking at environment and energy issues.</p>
<p>Catherine is a two-time winner of our Cheit Award</p>
<p>for Excellence in Teaching.</p>
<p>She received a PhD in economics from MIT</p>
<p>and a bachelor&rsquo;s from Harvard University.</p>
<p>Catherine&rsquo;s work focuses on the economics of energy markets,</p>
<p>energy policy, climate change, and environmental regulation.</p>
<p>In March, 2021, she was appointed</p>
<p>as deputy assistant secretary</p>
<p>for Climate and Energy Economics</p>
<p>in the US Department of Treasury,</p>
<p>which as you know,</p>
<p>is led by Haas Professor Emeritus Janet Yellen.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s currently a visiting professor</p>
<p>at Harvard&rsquo;s Kennedy School.</p>
<p>Welcome Professor Wolfram.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be saying this,</p>
<p>this is completely off the record,</p>
<p>but they are both being recruited by top schools</p>
<p>whose names you can only imagine.</p>
<p>One of them is a little further down on the peninsula,</p>
<p>and then the other school&rsquo;s like Harvard.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re having a terrible time at Harvard.</p>
<p>So, following today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we will have time for audience questions.</p>
<p>So please think of questions that you might have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start with questions for Ulrike.</p>
<p>Ulrike, you have a thriving academic career.</p>
<p>You live in Berkeley, 5,600 miles from Berlin.</p>
<p>Now, how did you get to be appointed</p>
<p>to Germany&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisors</p>
<p>and why did you wanna do it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, that&rsquo;s an excellent question</li>
</ul>
<p>because it started off from me writing a big op-ed,</p>
<p>why no self-respecting economist</p>
<p>should ever join the German Council of Economic Experts.</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>And the occasion was I&rsquo;d gotten a prize</p>
<p>from the Association of German Economists</p>
<p>and was talking about policy advising</p>
<p>and complained that whenever we have a new administration</p>
<p>come in, you know, I remember very much when Obama came in,</p>
<p>next thing I know, half of my department gets emptied up</p>
<p>because people go to Washington</p>
<p>and now it happened again under Biden.</p>
<p>Germany doesn&rsquo;t have that tradition</p>
<p>of really trying to seek out the top minds,</p>
<p>and I feel very much that this should change.</p>
<p>And next thing I know, I got a call from,</p>
<p>at that time the Chancellor Angela Merkel,</p>
<p>whether I would want to join</p>
<p>the Council of Economic Experts.</p>
<p>And I answered, &ldquo;Well, did you read the article?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But since then, people were saying,</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s a little bit differently organized,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s independent, you decide a little bit yourself,</p>
<p>you know who&rsquo;s in there and so on.</p>
<p>If you really want to change it, be part of it.</p>
<p>And that was the big motivation.</p>
<ul>
<li>I see.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you all hear where she said</p>
<p>that she got a phone call from Angela Merkel?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Her team, her team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, so next question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that the council is known</p>
<p>traditionally as the council of the &ldquo;five wise men,&rdquo;</p>
<p>but this time around there are actually three women</p>
<p>on the council, one of them being yourself.</p>
<p>Now, as a woman in the male dominated field</p>
<p>of economics and finance,</p>
<p>do you feel that you bring a different perspective</p>
<p>to the role?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, so I do think it was a big mistake</li>
</ul>
<p>to leave out an entire agenda</p>
<p>from this type of policy advising.</p>
<p>You mentioned my research on experience effects.</p>
<p>I do think what we&rsquo;ve lived through in our lives shapes us</p>
<p>and we bring a different perspective to the table.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s good, it has changed</p>
<p>so that the wise men are now also a lot of women.</p>
<p>At the same time I would want to emphasize that</p>
<p>what has changed mostly is the, you know,</p>
<p>how economics has changed, much more evidence-based</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know whether you can really gender</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re working right now, but I&rsquo;m glad it has changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>So let me talk about another aspect of your background</li>
</ul>
<p>that&rsquo;s different from a lot of other economists.</p>
<p>You are a pioneer in the area</p>
<p>of behavioral economics and finance.</p>
<p>How is that different from classical economics</p>
<p>and how has that affected</p>
<p>what you bring to this important role?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, it&rsquo;s quite interesting</li>
</ul>
<p>how it interacts with all thoughts of economic questions.</p>
<p>So obviously one big topic on the table this year</p>
<p>was inflation, not only here in the US but also in Europe.</p>
<p>And exactly the topic you brought up early on,</p>
<p>how experiences, times we lived through tend to stay with us</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s very relevant for inflation experiences.</p>
<p>So when inflation, you know, was scratching the two digit,</p>
<p>the 10% real in Germany, I was not happy.</p>
<p>But what I kept telling policy makers,</p>
<p>not only let&rsquo;s not only think about, you know,</p>
<p>fixing it right now, but let&rsquo;s keep in mind</p>
<p>that there might be long run implications</p>
<p>if we stay there too long.</p>
<p>People get risk adverse,</p>
<p>they get different attitudes toward saving and investment.</p>
<p>And there was lots of interest in hearing that.</p>
<p>Another quick example is labor markets.</p>
<p>Germany, like many countries in Europe</p>
<p>have this demographic problem</p>
<p>that leads to not having enough labor force</p>
<p>and how do we now attract people into the country?</p>
<p>How do we help people to find the type of jobs</p>
<p>and train for the type of jobs that are future oriented?</p>
<p>Traditional economics, as you know, incentives,</p>
<p>punish, carrot or punishment.</p>
<p>And so as a behavioral economist, I get often asked,</p>
<p>well, what other means could we use?</p>
<p>Like involving peers, involving nudges,</p>
<p>involving lowering the threshold</p>
<p>to get being mentored about maybe changing your career.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually amazing how interested policy.</p>
<p>Every politician I meet will start with,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you as a behavioral economist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ah, interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you as a behavioral economist,</p>
<p>you just put out your first annual report</p>
<p>on this Council of Economic Advisors.</p>
<p>This is kind of a big question,</p>
<p>but maybe you can give us the 30 second answer</p>
<p>on how is Germany doing overall?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll try.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not as badly as some have worried about last fall,</p>
<p>in particular with the energy crisis,</p>
<p>with the war in Ukraine and what&rsquo;s happening to oil prices.</p>
<p>People are very concerned about what would happen</p>
<p>to the German economy.</p>
<p>We at the council were a little more optimistic.</p>
<p>Lots of things were going on there</p>
<p>that German industries have still lots of demand</p>
<p>for their products, which I haven&rsquo;t quite worked through.</p>
<p>Maybe partly because of supply chain issues.</p>
<p>German consumers were forced to, they save a lot anyhow,</p>
<p>but they were forced to save even more</p>
<p>during the COVID crisis.</p>
<p>And so we were predicting that that will buffer a little bit</p>
<p>the strain of, you know, the economic downturn</p>
<p>that was about to come due to the energy crisis.</p>
<p>And I think so far we are right.</p>
<p>So mildly optimistic.</p>
<ul>
<li>I see.</li>
</ul>
<p>So did you have specific policy recommendations</p>
<p>that you spearheaded?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I mean,</li>
</ul>
<p>so we always pick like 3, 4, 5, 6, like main topics.</p>
<p>One is inflation.</p>
<p>They are, you know, the ECB decides</p>
<p>how to set interest rates.</p>
<p>But we put a lot of emphasis into this theme</p>
<p>of thinking about long run implications</p>
<p>if we stay up at this relatively high levels of inflation.</p>
<p>We also warned the German government not to be too generous</p>
<p>with the physical on the physical side.</p>
<p>I think in the US that didn&rsquo;t necessarily always go well.</p>
<p>Maybe the checks that were distributed during COVID</p>
<p>could have been fine-tuned a little bit more.</p>
<p>So we were arguing a lot for fine-tuning,</p>
<p>for finding those folks who really need the support</p>
<p>on the industry side and on the consumer side.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re being heard there.</p>
<p>In terms of the labor markets,</p>
<p>I already alluded to us again,</p>
<p>having a little bit of a behavioral push</p>
<p>to kind of lower the threshold to help people to retrain,</p>
<p>to find career path, which are future oriented.</p>
<p>We going away from just punishment, stopping support,</p>
<p>but going to the workplace,</p>
<p>having a different type of mentoring in place.</p>
<p>I think that got a lot of good reception.</p>
<p>And then of course we worked a lot on energy topics</p>
<p>and how to help Germany get through this period</p>
<p>of very high prices without throwing incentives</p>
<p>out of the window, right?</p>
<p>So the immediate instinct of governments, of people,</p>
<p>of politicians want to be reelected is,</p>
<p>oh, let&rsquo;s just put a price cap at a very low level.</p>
<p>And so people can just, you know,</p>
<p>heat their places at prices.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have their gas bills, their energy bills explode.</p>
<p>The problem is you destroy incentives if you do that, right?</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t pay more than you used to pay,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s no incentive to save energy</p>
<p>and that was very urgently needed</p>
<p>in light of the reduced supply of energy</p>
<p>from Russia in particular.</p>
<p>So lots of talks about how one could do that</p>
<p>with lump sum payments and keeping the incentives up.</p>
<p>It was frustrating but I think we prevailed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well maybe you could talk a little bit more about that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inflation is a really big topic in the US</p>
<p>as it is in Europe.</p>
<p>In the Eurozone inflation rates right now</p>
<p>are four times higher than what the European Central Bank</p>
<p>would like them to be.</p>
<p>What are you proposing in order to get inflation down</p>
<p>since you don&rsquo;t wanna hurt incentives?</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, so first of all there is the monetary side, right?</li>
</ul>
<p>So central banks react as they did and do here in the US</p>
<p>by raising rates and just having a voice out there</p>
<p>saying that it&rsquo;s important to keep raising interest rates</p>
<p>to combat rising inflation,</p>
<p>I think played some role.</p>
<p>I mean we definitely, you know,</p>
<p>had meetings with Christine Lagarde</p>
<p>and other people of the ECB and kind of made sure</p>
<p>because do you remember, team transitory people thinking</p>
<p>this might like, you know, not last</p>
<p>and might worry too much.</p>
<p>So our voice was there in the mix.</p>
<p>Now on the physical side, however,</p>
<p>governments want to help consumers</p>
<p>who are dealing with these increasing prices.</p>
<p>And I was in the chancellory on the day</p>
<p>Germany passed this 200 billion package</p>
<p>to support consumers and industries in Germany</p>
<p>to get through this period of energy crisis</p>
<p>and high prices.</p>
<p>And I literally remember them basically</p>
<p>running a victory lap and then throwing the document down</p>
<p>and they passed it through</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called the doppervom syndrome.</p>
<p>Like I dunno, like they&rsquo;re very proud of the thing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Of course we do need support.</p>
<p>But if you just now distribute money</p>
<p>not thinking very much about who really needs it,</p>
<p>you push this additional money into the economy,</p>
<p>well that will only, you know, stimulate prices</p>
<p>to go up further because people can afford</p>
<p>paying those prices.</p>
<p>So going to, you know,</p>
<p>the secretary in Treasury</p>
<p>and also in the Economics and Climate department</p>
<p>and kind of discussing how important it is to be targeted,</p>
<p>which by the way needs a better</p>
<p>data infrastructure in Germany.</p>
<p>One big thing we are pushing for</p>
<p>to find out which consumers really need the support</p>
<p>and which are the industries</p>
<p>which will long term survive this price,</p>
<p>say twice as high as US prices</p>
<p>was one thing we are very involved in.</p>
<p>But then, I mean, just a funny little anecdote.</p>
<p>In December specifically,</p>
<p>the government wanted to help people</p>
<p>to get through the winter where the energy,</p>
<p>the bill would be really high.</p>
<p>And they basically wanted to pay the bill</p>
<p>for people who are heating with gas.</p>
<p>And I understand the impulse.</p>
<p>But if you say I&rsquo;m paying your December bill,</p>
<p>then there are no incentives to save, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, you just heat and open the window</p>
<p>at the same time, you know, the government is paying.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve helped design a structure.</p>
<p>I mean it was actually not the council,</p>
<p>but it was the commission.</p>
<p>But one of my colleagues is on that commission</p>
<p>carefully designed like a scheme where they said,</p>
<p>well we basically gonna subsidize you</p>
<p>but in the reality we&rsquo;re paying 1/12ths</p>
<p>of your past consumption.</p>
<p>In December, still from the first kilowatt hour on</p>
<p>you have incentives to save that money.</p>
<p>You know, if you don&rsquo;t consume amount,</p>
<p>you get the money back.</p>
<p>And so they worked and worked in convincing the politician.</p>
<p>At some point, one, what would be the US</p>
<p>like person just below the secretary,</p>
<p>kind of whose background is in law apparently said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, but you know, it&rsquo;s so complicated,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we just pay the December bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re like, no.</p>
<p>So you have to be at the right place at the right moment</p>
<p>and say, &ldquo;Well remember incentives.</p>
<p>You know, we went over that,&rdquo; and then luckily it passed.</p>
<p>(Ulrike laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow, that&rsquo;s a great story.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit more about energy.</p>
<p>So Germany has been able to</p>
<p>dramatically slash its dependency on Russian gas</p>
<p>in part because of these amazing policies</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re in the middle of designing,</p>
<p>but also in part by building a new import terminal</p>
<p>for liquid natural gas.</p>
<p>So is this an overall sustainable strategy?</p>
<ul>
<li>In the long term I mean, renewables are the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with the completely faulty Russian plan in place,</p>
<p>it was supposed to be a crutch to get us</p>
<p>to a bigger role for renewables.</p>
<p>Like to use gas kind of to get there.</p>
<p>I think right now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very impressed how our politicians</p>
<p>managed to pull it off to get these</p>
<p>L and G terminals to work at that fast pace.</p>
<p>I do hope that more broadly people in Germany</p>
<p>will take note that, you know,</p>
<p>approval processes can be much faster</p>
<p>than they have been in Germany in the past</p>
<p>and apply this also, you know,</p>
<p>to wind energy and solar energy,</p>
<p>which often gets kind of stuck in these like</p>
<p>long approval processes.</p>
<p>But I do think in general this process of transformation</p>
<p>to renewables is still very much what we have in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow, that&rsquo;s great to hear.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here at Berkeley we understand what you mean</p>
<p>by long approval processes.</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>So let me ask you, this is the last question</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask you before we turn to Catherine.</p>
<p>So even though the EU is clearly pushing the US</p>
<p>to tackle climate change,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not so happy with how the US is doing that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been pushback from Germany and the EU</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re using subsidies to promote clean energy,</p>
<p>at least in President Biden&rsquo;s Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>In fact, the two of you were talking about this</p>
<p>in the Green Room about using subsidies as a tool.</p>
<p>Can you talk a little bit more about that?</p>
<p>Is that going to lead to a trade war?</p>
<ul>
<li>That was apparently the first reaction</li>
</ul>
<p>of our treasury secretary.</p>
<p>He has since then clarified</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not wanting or anticipating a trade war.</p>
<p>So there is serious concern</p>
<p>and honestly disappointment about this distortion.</p>
<p>As much as everybody in Europe is super excited</p>
<p>about the US turning to green energy,</p>
<p>trying to get, you know, green hydrogen sources of energy</p>
<p>kind of off the ground, establishing a network</p>
<p>and also taking note that, you know,</p>
<p>Europe should have done that long ago, right?</p>
<p>We were into this much longer than the US</p>
<p>and so now it looks as if the US might be leapfrogging ahead</p>
<p>and this is to be applauded, this is inspiring,</p>
<p>this is fantastic, this is great news for,</p>
<p>you know, this earth.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>maybe in particular in Europe where we work so hard</p>
<p>to think about subsidizing not too much,</p>
<p>not distorting competition</p>
<p>between the different EU member countries,</p>
<p>it was a huge disappointment</p>
<p>when people read the fine print, so to speak.</p>
<p>Say, &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re gonna support electric vehicles</p>
<p>and electric battery production,&rdquo; but it has to actually,</p>
<p>the final assembly has to be in the US,</p>
<p>it has to be produced 80% in the US</p>
<p>like when these details kind of came out.</p>
<p>So that has been a big disappointment.</p>
<p>I think the US and Europe are trying to work</p>
<p>and find ways to make this</p>
<p>kind of disadvantaging of European industries less severe,</p>
<p>which I very much support.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to keep talking</p>
<p>rather than throwing words like trade war into the round.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you know,</p>
<p>it comes at a moment where</p>
<p>Europe is already grappling with a situation</p>
<p>where in the long run energy prices for sure, you know,</p>
<p>in the gas oil realm will be significantly higher</p>
<p>than in the US.</p>
<p>And that means that a lot of companies are thinking about</p>
<p>leaving Europe, going to the US among other places</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very tough for Europe</p>
<p>and Europe has to think hard now about</p>
<p>what are our comparative advantages,</p>
<p>what should we support?</p>
<p>Where is it long-term sustainable?</p>
<p>Where could we be leaders?</p>
<p>I personally think rather than getting in a trade war</p>
<p>or even a subsidization war,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working closely with my French colleagues</p>
<p>who actually, by the way, at least some of them</p>
<p>are also at Berkeley.</p>
<p>The current leader used to be at Berkeley.</p>
<p>I still know him from Berkeley, Camille Londer.</p>
<p>My French colleagues are very much,</p>
<p>well if they do bio American, we do bio European</p>
<p>and you know, you kind of can see where that&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>I rather think we should step back and focus on</p>
<p>where we could be leaders on and which industries,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s knowledge work related or even car related,</p>
<p>you know, we might leverage advantages we have</p>
<p>and kind of think more into the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow, thank you so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that Europe is excited</p>
<p>that America is moving aggressively</p>
<p>on the climate change front.</p>
<p>But as you point out, very disappointed</p>
<p>that the form it&rsquo;s taking is through subsidies and not,</p>
<p>for example through a carbon tax.</p>
<p>Catherine, would you like to comment on that?</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, so I, yeah, I think at a high level,</li>
</ul>
<p>these issues of trade and how the US and the EU</p>
<p>either work together or work against one another</p>
<p>are super important.</p>
<p>Climate change is of course a global problem.</p>
<p>We need to solve it as a global community.</p>
<p>So we need to solve it multilaterally</p>
<p>and I guess I see there being kind of two paths forward.</p>
<p>The bad path is that we get into subsidy wars,</p>
<p>the subsidy wars, we don&rsquo;t kind of push things down</p>
<p>a learning curve, but we end up competing</p>
<p>for scarce resources like lithium</p>
<p>and then we have to subsidize even more.</p>
<p>And ultimately, you know, along the bad path,</p>
<p>if the EU ends up giving up on carbon pricing</p>
<p>because the US isn&rsquo;t doing carbon pricing,</p>
<p>that would be a bad outcome.</p>
<p>You know, the European Union has a cap and trade program</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been very effective in driving down emissions</p>
<p>in the power and industrial sector.</p>
<p>I think the good path though is that we figure out</p>
<p>that we can work together</p>
<p>and that we can actually use trade</p>
<p>to help address climate change.</p>
<p>So one thing that I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about lately</p>
<p>is methane emissions.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the very dirty countries</p>
<p>in terms of methane are Turkmenistan, Iran, Iraq.</p>
<p>We would wait forever</p>
<p>if we wanted to have every country kind of decide on its own</p>
<p>to address climate change.</p>
<p>Iran and Iraq are not gonna be</p>
<p>kind of high on the list to do it.</p>
<p>Iran is one of the very few countries</p>
<p>that is not signed on to the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>
<p>But if the US and the EU can get together and say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iran, we don&rsquo;t really want your oil,</p>
<p>or you gotta kind of clean up your act</p>
<p>in terms of the methane emissions associated with your oil,</p>
<p>otherwise we&rsquo;re not gonna import it,&rdquo;</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a way in which we could use trade</p>
<p>and kind of use our communal buying power</p>
<p>to make some real change in terms of climate change.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think these trade and climate issues</p>
<p>are super, super important and policy makers</p>
<p>have kind of the bad path that they could go down,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a good path</p>
<p>and hopefully they&rsquo;ll choose the latter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, let&rsquo;s just step back for a second</li>
</ul>
<p>and maybe you could just tell us</p>
<p>what made you decide to go to Washington?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, sure.</li>
</ul>
<p>So like a lot of my colleagues,</p>
<p>I wanted to be relevant to policymakers</p>
<p>and I wanted to have my research influence decisions,</p>
<p>but I figured I really should probably understand</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like to be a policymaker</p>
<p>and see how the sausage is made.</p>
<p>So when Janet Yellen was appointed as treasury secretary,</p>
<p>I reached out to her actively.</p>
<p>So, if anyone is interested in policy,</p>
<p>I guess I would firmly encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t wait for them to come to you.</p>
<p>Life in DC is so, so hectic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going a million miles an hour.</p>
<p>I used to think that they would kind of</p>
<p>scan the whole field of environmental economics</p>
<p>and pick like the best person who is the exact right match.</p>
<p>But you need to kind of raise your hand and say, &quot;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready, I&rsquo;d like to be there.&quot;</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s 11:00 PM at night and the guy has</p>
<p>the job of finding somebody to fill the role.</p>
<p>If you volunteered, then it&rsquo;s attractive.</p>
<p>So basically there had been a position in treasury</p>
<p>working on environmental issues</p>
<p>during the Obama administration,</p>
<p>not during the Trump administration</p>
<p>that the environmental position got eradicated.</p>
<p>But I reached out to her and I said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re interested in having that position again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to fill it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it worked out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow, that&rsquo;s a really important lesson for all of us,</li>
</ul>
<p>being proactive, right?</p>
<p>Not waiting for them to call you, you call them.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great for us all to hear that.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you a question</p>
<p>back to this conversation about subsidies.</p>
<p>Why do you think the Biden administration is so reluctant</p>
<p>to put a price on carbon?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah. (all laughing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, there was a small window of opportunity</p>
<p>and a bunch of people said that there were 49 senators</p>
<p>that would&rsquo;ve been okay with the carbon price.</p>
<p>There was a small window</p>
<p>when Jen Psaki from the podium said&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the concerns was that Biden had made this pledge</p>
<p>not to raise taxes on people</p>
<p>who made less than $400,000 a year.</p>
<p>And so there was the question,</p>
<p>well, if we have carbon pricing,</p>
<p>would that be a violation of that pledge?</p>
<p>But Jen Psaki from the podium said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not a violation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So there was some movement for it,</p>
<p>but in the end, Senator Manchin had a lot of sway</p>
<p>and Senator Manchin did not like carbon pricing.</p>
<p>So here we are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you. Thank you for that insight.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the US Treasury might not sound like the obvious place</p>
<p>to make a difference in climate policy,</p>
<p>but it turns out that your timing was really fortuitous.</p>
<p>So tell us a little bit about how you did that</p>
<p>and tell us about your work on the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sure, so when I started talking to treasury,</li>
</ul>
<p>it was the end of December, 2020.</p>
<p>The Georgia elections hadn&rsquo;t happened yet,</p>
<p>and the war in Ukraine hadn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>So after I started talking to them,</p>
<p>the two Georgia elections went the Democrat&rsquo;s way,</p>
<p>which meant that they could use</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called budget reconciliation</p>
<p>to pass a climate legislation.</p>
<p>Budget reconciliation basically meant that</p>
<p>any of the climate activities had to go through treasury,</p>
<p>had to be in the tax code.</p>
<p>So treasury ended up playing a super, super important role</p>
<p>in designing the provisions or, you know,</p>
<p>commenting for sure on the provisions</p>
<p>that were in the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>So it was a different office.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an office of tax policy</p>
<p>and since a lot of the actions</p>
<p>were happening through the tax code,</p>
<p>they were really the ground zero or the center</p>
<p>of the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>And actually, I can remember for instance,</p>
<p>those of you that are following the discussions</p>
<p>about green hydrogen and what counts as green hydrogen,</p>
<p>there are people in the office of tax policy saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, it&rsquo;s gonna be really hard</p>
<p>to define what counts as green hydrogens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I got kind of a front row seat</p>
<p>to the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t claim that I was part of it</p>
<p>since I wasn&rsquo;t in that office.</p>
<p>The second thing that happened was the war in Ukraine,</p>
<p>the invasion by Russia almost a year ago.</p>
<p>And there again, you know,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t think of treasury being central</p>
<p>to thinking about energy policy,</p>
<p>but treasury is very important in thinking about sanctions.</p>
<p>So treasury has an Office of Terrorism Financing</p>
<p>and Financial Crimes.</p>
<p>It kind of sounds like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the office for financing terrorism,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re against financing terrorism.</p>
<p>But they run sanctions,</p>
<p>they run the sanctions program.</p>
<p>And so I got very, very involved</p>
<p>in designing and implementing the price cap on Russian oil.</p>
<p>And that was absolutely fascinating</p>
<p>just to see it go from a memo.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t take credit for the idea,</p>
<p>but I definitely take credit for writing the early memo</p>
<p>and, you know, pushing it hard</p>
<p>through the actual implementation.</p>
<p>So that was really, really fascinating to see.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ann] Tell us more how you did that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean, I didn&rsquo;t do it by myself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There were definitely other people at treasury,</p>
<p>but you do kind of see the power of the personality.</p>
<p>The head of the Office of Terrorism Financing</p>
<p>and Financial Crimes is a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>And she, you know, she would go to her counterparts</p>
<p>in the UK and Berlin and just say, okay.</p>
<p>You know, she&rsquo;s petite and smiles,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re gonna do and it would get done.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>And why did they agree to this price cap?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So one thing about the price cap is,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I guess I should step back and explain a bit</p>
<p>what it does for those of you that that haven&rsquo;t followed it.</p>
<p>Basically the idea is to put a cap on the price</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s paid to Russia for exports of Russian oil.</p>
<p>And the way that&rsquo;s enforced</p>
<p>is by saying that the EU companies, the UK companies,</p>
<p>the US companies can&rsquo;t insure,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t transport oil out of Russia</p>
<p>if the price is above the price cap.</p>
<p>And so right now for crude oil, the price cap is $60.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s kind of working.</p>
<p>There are definitely some exports out of Russia</p>
<p>that are above that cap,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not traveling on Greek tankers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not being insured by UK companies.</p>
<p>So, you know, basically,</p>
<p>actually now I&rsquo;m forgetting what the question was.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ann] You were telling us how you made this happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, how we made it happen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So one thing that&rsquo;s useful is that it&rsquo;s a solution</p>
<p>to kind of how, so basically Russia is,</p>
<p>what there&rsquo;s, McClean had this phrase to describe Russia.</p>
<p>Russia is a petrol station masquerading as a country.</p>
<p>So Russia&rsquo;s, you know, huge, huge share</p>
<p>of the government finances</p>
<p>come from the export of natural gas and the export of oil.</p>
<p>And so early on in the war, there was the position</p>
<p>that we need to be really careful about energy markets</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t want to sanction, for instance, banks</p>
<p>that are actively involved in the energy trade.</p>
<p>And so we were trying not to royal energy markets,</p>
<p>but in the meantime, Russia was just minting money</p>
<p>because the oil prices, gas prices had gone up</p>
<p>because of this war that they had started.</p>
<p>So it was just kind of particularly galling</p>
<p>that they were making more money off the war</p>
<p>that they had created.</p>
<p>So the strategy that&rsquo;s typically taken,</p>
<p>if there are countries that are, you know, Iran,</p>
<p>that are doing things that the US government doesn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>is an outright embargo.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say we don&rsquo;t want anybody</p>
<p>to be buying oil from Iran.</p>
<p>We just couldn&rsquo;t do that in the case of Russia.</p>
<p>Russia is too big an oil exporter/</p>
<p>That would&rsquo;ve driven the price of oil up dramatically</p>
<p>if the US had kind of tried to impose an embargo</p>
<p>or you know, even worse if a coalition of countries.</p>
<p>And so the price cap is its kind of middle ground</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t do an embargo,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t let Russia continue to mint money</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s try to keep the oil coming out of Russia</p>
<p>but limit the revenues that Russia is getting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ann] Has that happened? Has it been effective?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the million dollar question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It went into effect in December for crude oil</p>
<p>and then in February for the petroleum products.</p>
<p>The way at treasury we framed it</p>
<p>was that the price cap had two goals.</p>
<p>One goal was to reduce Russia&rsquo;s revenues</p>
<p>and the other was to keep global oil markets stable</p>
<p>and not to cause a global recession</p>
<p>because oil prices had really spiked.</p>
<p>And so I think by those two metrics, it&rsquo;s going well.</p>
<p>Russia, if you look at the statements coming out</p>
<p>of the Ministry of Finance there for instance,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hurting.</p>
<p>They are talking about implementing one-off business taxes</p>
<p>because their revenues from oil exports have gone down.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, that&rsquo;s a very promising development</p>
<p>in terms of trying to limit their ability</p>
<p>to have money to buy tanks and pay soldiers</p>
<p>and oil markets are quite calm.</p>
<p>So Russia made a statement last week</p>
<p>that they were gonna cut production</p>
<p>by about 500,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p>And we were always nervous about that at treasury,</p>
<p>about them reacting to the price cap by cutting production.</p>
<p>But the oil markets, they went up a little bit,</p>
<p>but now they&rsquo;re back down today with the inflation print.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think by those two metrics so far</p>
<p>it has been successful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, congratulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>So let me just step back and ask another question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of off that path.</p>
<p>So you were an academic before you went to Washington.</p>
<p>How is the culture different in Washington?</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s 180 degrees different.</li>
</ul>
<p>So one thing Ann, I think you&rsquo;ll appreciate,</p>
<p>deans are kind of the bosses of professors,</p>
<p>but not really the bosses of professors.</p>
<p>I was the deputy assistant secretary.</p>
<p>The assistant secretary was my boss,</p>
<p>and my boss would call me occasionally, not all the time,</p>
<p>Friday night at 8:00 PM say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want something by Saturday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I had to, you know, I had to do it.</p>
<p>So, you know, one thing is the hierarchy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely hierarchical in DC.</p>
<p>The other thing is just the language.</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s the English language.</p>
<p>But for instance in DC</p>
<p>you say that you wanna table something.</p>
<p>In common parlance that means like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna put that idea aside, right?</p>
<p>And DC table means like, put it on the table,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re moving forward with this.</p>
<p>So, and all the acronyms, I mean they&rsquo;re, yeah just yeah,</p>
<p>lots of learning new language, new culture for sure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I like the idea of asking for something</li>
</ul>
<p>on Friday night and having it appear on my desk</p>
<p>on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>(all laughing)</p>
<p>Yes, so let me ask you a different question.</p>
<p>So knowing you well</p>
<p>and knowing the amazing amount of publications and research</p>
<p>and travel all over the world you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>in energy and regulation, you have a very deep knowledge</p>
<p>of the energy, probably deeper</p>
<p>than many Washington policymakers.</p>
<p>So how was your expertise received?</p>
<ul>
<li>So for one thing,</li>
</ul>
<p>I was a deputy assistant secretary,</p>
<p>it did not matter that I was a professor</p>
<p>or I was a grad student.</p>
<p>I was defined by my position in DC</p>
<p>and not by, you know,</p>
<p>what I had done before necessarily.</p>
<p>I definitely, yeah, it&rsquo;s a little bit striking.</p>
<p>I would think, well, come on, I wrote a paper on that.</p>
<p>Why are you questioning what I&rsquo;m saying about that?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the way,</p>
<p>it is the hierarchy.</p>
<p>But, you know, I definitely was able to,</p>
<p>I had connections in the economics field</p>
<p>and so I could call friends that I knew that, you know,</p>
<p>can you gimme an answer to this in the next four hours?</p>
<p>That was definitely something that was useful.</p>
<p>So I drew on my network certainly, but yeah,</p>
<p>your standing in the academic field</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily carry over to standing in DC.</p>
<ul>
<li>So we now have the opportunity to field questions</li>
</ul>
<p>from all of you.</p>
<p>First before we move to the question/</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to ask if you have questions to go to the mic</p>
<p>and identify yourself and then ask the question</p>
<p>to Ulrike or Catherine or both of them.</p>
<p>But before we get to questions,</p>
<p>can we just do a round of applause for these amazing women?</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just amazing to me to have three women up here</p>
<p>and doing incredible.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll exclude myself.</p>
<p>These two women are doing amazing things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so thrilled.</p>
<p>So questions from the floor?</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you all for being here.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of weird walking all the way back</p>
<p>just to say hi again.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super amazing to meet everybody here.</p>
<p>As business people&hellip;</p>
<p>My name is Julian,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a second year MBA full-time student.</p>
<p>As business people policy seems sometimes to be a little bit</p>
<p>outside of our world, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million questions that I can ask you guys,</p>
<p>but maybe the question I wanna ask you guys the most is,</p>
<p>what is the most misunderstood thing about your job</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like people to understand?</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll start.</li>
</ul>
<p>So somebody said to me when I was coming in to government,</p>
<p>they said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a hidden army here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guess as an academic you think,</p>
<p>well this would be a good policy idea,</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t this being done?</p>
<p>And I think a lot of the issue is</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s just not enough capacity there to do it.</p>
<p>That there are a lot of good ideas that yeah,</p>
<p>they just need somebody in government to kind of take it,</p>
<p>take the bull by the horns and drive it through.</p>
<p>And if that doesn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s not the right person that&rsquo;s really motivated</p>
<p>to do that, it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>One thing that I, you know,</p>
<p>one of the kind of translations that I started to do</p>
<p>was millions to billions.</p>
<p>Like a hundred million dollar program in government is tiny.</p>
<p>That, yeah, that&rsquo;s just kind of something</p>
<p>that is a nuisance that people have to deal with it,</p>
<p>they have to deal with it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, to also chime in.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, quite similar.</p>
<p>I think what I had completely misunderstood about</p>
<p>politics and policy is, Catherine used the word</p>
<p>like how the sausage is made.</p>
<p>I kind of had this impression that has some deep thinking</p>
<p>and careful preparation and ultimately a bunch of guys</p>
<p>get into a room and then later there&rsquo;s the law initiative.</p>
<p>And that was a little shocking.</p>
<p>But then it also showed how if you are at the right place,</p>
<p>if you can be in the room, you know, you can help.</p>
<p>You can help just by explaining things a little bit.</p>
<p>Partly very basic things.</p>
<p>But also it&rsquo;s often, you know, as you said, like motivation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that people are necessarily</p>
<p>like fiercely against or for it.</p>
<p>If just somebody goes there and presents the thing</p>
<p>and has the right idea ready at the right moment,</p>
<p>it will happen.</p>
<p>And so that aspect had really not been clear to me.</p>
<p>And it is kind of motivating, again, going back to teaching.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes I feel like, okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna teach again, like basic incentive,</p>
<p>like moral hazard, asymmetric information.</p>
<p>Well, turns out if you can explain those well</p>
<p>you can do a lot of good in the world.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like all motivated to, you know,</p>
<p>teach folks to take all this eco knowledge with you</p>
<p>and if you engage in policy.</p>
<p>So, that was another aspect I hadn&rsquo;t expected.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello, I&rsquo;m Farnam.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m second year PhD student at Haas.</p>
<p>So I was wondering how did you realize</p>
<p>you are ready to go into that direction?</p>
<p>Because you could have done that 10 years ago</p>
<p>because you were already an expert then.</p>
<p>So that is my question. Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Catherine] Go ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I ever felt ready.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I also took note of what Catherine said earlier,</p>
<p>you know, you just need to go out there</p>
<p>and like make yourself be seen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lesson I learned,</p>
<p>although I didn&rsquo;t quite do it myself.</p>
<p>I mean, people did call me up in the end</p>
<p>and I was really thinking.</p>
<p>So the first answer is, I didn&rsquo;t necessarily feel ready,</p>
<p>but on the other hand I was thinking</p>
<p>when I had the opportunity and I thought about doing this</p>
<p>and possibly changing nothing, you know,</p>
<p>being very frustrated was like administrative hurdles</p>
<p>or unwillingness to get things done.</p>
<p>I was thinking, well, it&rsquo;s a little dramatic,</p>
<p>but like from the deathbed perspective,</p>
<p>which we like to assume like, you know,</p>
<p>would you like looking back</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think you should have tried at least?</p>
<p>And just kind of assuming this perspective of</p>
<p>at least I want to have told myself I tried,</p>
<p>I have something to contribute,</p>
<p>I might fail and the probability of failure</p>
<p>might be bigger than 50%, but I want to do it.</p>
<p>So just getting clarity about that was key for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ever really ready in some ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>People talk about how the first couple months in government</p>
<p>is like drinking from a fire hose and to me,</p>
<p>there was definitely that aspect, but I also felt like</p>
<p>it was sometimes like running through a sprinkler, you know,</p>
<p>one of those sprinklers that goes back and forth</p>
<p>and like sometimes a sprinkler was over there</p>
<p>and I was over there.</p>
<p>I mean it was just, yeah,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of learning that happens</p>
<p>when you get there.</p>
<p>And I think for that reason,</p>
<p>going kind of early and often,</p>
<p>if you wanna be part of policy, getting in,</p>
<p>learning the language, learning the ropes,</p>
<p>learning you know, how the legislative branch</p>
<p>interacts with executive branch.</p>
<p>One thing I learned for sure is the power of the PR,</p>
<p>public affairs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely pushed to journalists</p>
<p>what we want them to say or you know,</p>
<p>what stories we want them to cover</p>
<p>or just kind of learning all of those things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t get exposed to in an academic environment.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you should go</p>
<p>even if you think you&rsquo;re not ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, thanks so much for taking the time</li>
</ul>
<p>to be here with us today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Zofia, I&rsquo;m a second year undergrad</p>
<p>studying data science here at Berkeley.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also Polish,</p>
<p>so the German connection is super close</p>
<p>to sort of me and my heart and my connection</p>
<p>to my home country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also the founder of a foundation</p>
<p>called Girls Future Ready.</p>
<p>So for the past five years we&rsquo;ve helped over 80,000 girls</p>
<p>from Central Eastern Europe be prepared for</p>
<p>being future ready in their future careers.</p>
<p>So you both talk a lot about this idea of, you know,</p>
<p>being in the room where it happens</p>
<p>and having an impact on what&rsquo;s happening around the world.</p>
<p>How do you get into that room,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re a young person?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m 20,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in activism since I was 14</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a huge struggle when it comes to</p>
<p>either being a woman or being a young woman specifically.</p>
<p>What is your biggest piece of advice</p>
<p>when it comes to getting in that room</p>
<p>and having the influence that you&rsquo;re looking for?</p>
<ul>
<li>This is gonna be very specific to policy,</li>
</ul>
<p>but in some ways I&rsquo;m an anomaly</p>
<p>because I was not involved with the campaign.</p>
<p>I reached out to Yellen after the election had been won</p>
<p>and after the, you know,</p>
<p>after some of the people had been seated.</p>
<p>But I think getting involved early in the campaigns</p>
<p>is really important.</p>
<p>Also, one thing I noticed for sure</p>
<p>is it didn&rsquo;t really matter which campaign you were part of,</p>
<p>there were definitely people that had high ranking jobs</p>
<p>that had been part of the Buttigieg</p>
<p>or the Kamala Harris campaigns.</p>
<p>So you know, everything gets consolidated</p>
<p>in the general election and people that have been,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a matter of kind of picking the right horse.</p>
<p>Even if you work for a different campaign you can, yeah,</p>
<p>you can be part of the administration.</p>
<p>So I guess maybe trying to scale up a little bit,</p>
<p>like get involved early.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Zofia] Baby steps is what you&rsquo;re trying to say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yep, yep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Zofia] Cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah and I would add to that,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great if you found your thing</p>
<p>you are motivated to work on, you care about,</p>
<p>you want to improve in the world</p>
<p>and then do this one additional step</p>
<p>and kind of find who in which ministry</p>
<p>kind of is working on these topics.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to start with the secretary</p>
<p>and talking to him or her right away, you know.</p>
<p>You might find some kind of groups which is kind of</p>
<p>working around this theme and we reach out to them</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in people,</p>
<p>I mean who are informed not kind of coming up</p>
<p>with random opinions based on like newspaper articles.</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of that as well.</p>
<p>So we are maybe a little specific in kind of coming from,</p>
<p>you know, academia and having this whole academic career</p>
<p>and like having the expert status right away.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so much hunger for people</p>
<p>who have concrete ideas and tips</p>
<p>and like putting in the work</p>
<p>of trying to get to that person.</p>
<p>Like imagine you know, Catherine looking for like</p>
<p>some answer within four hours or so.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve established the connection to her,</p>
<p>she might come to you when she needs this answer quickly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something which I feel</p>
<p>for too long I didn&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>you know, that I could provide my knowledge that way.</p>
<p>I regret that, that I wasn&rsquo;t seeking out more earlier.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Zofia] Totally. Thanks ladies so much. Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Adrienne Openuloper, been working in MBA</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and I have a question on a topic</p>
<p>specifically to the carbon quantitative easing.</p>
<p>So in the topic carbon quantitative easing is a method</p>
<p>to like gain money for the carbonizing the world.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts as policy makers and as academics</p>
<p>on that specific topic?</p>
<ul>
<li>So if I heard the question correctly,</li>
</ul>
<p>you were talking about the policy of quantitative easing</p>
<p>which was implemented during the time</p>
<p>which are different from now</p>
<p>when the kind of inflation rate was very low</p>
<p>and kind of was very successful way</p>
<p>for both in the US and in Europe</p>
<p>of getting through this period of low inflation.</p>
<p>The big,</p>
<p>I dunno what you mean was what we were taught about it,</p>
<p>but right now it&rsquo;s obviously not what we want.</p>
<p>We want tightening.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, specifically to carbon.</li>
</ul>
<p>So like the definition is a conventional monetary policy</p>
<p>that is featured as a proposal, international climate policy</p>
<p>called Global Carbon Rewards.</p>
<p>So like a global, a carbon money</p>
<p>in order to create some easing with a future view.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you have come across this,</p>
<p>but it is around. - [Ulrike] I haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>Have you? - No I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m curious to follow up with you</p>
<p>to learn more about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, thank you so much for being here today</li>
</ul>
<p>and speaking with us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been highly informative.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m Cleo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a senior in Berkeley Haas and I lived in Germany</p>
<p>when Trump was president</p>
<p>and when Merkel was a chancellor.</p>
<p>So the politics were highly different</p>
<p>and it was very interesting to learn about</p>
<p>the different perspectives.</p>
<p>Professor Malmendier, can you please talk about</p>
<p>how on a cultural perspective</p>
<p>or maybe in terms of policy differences,</p>
<p>how the German economic responses to inflation</p>
<p>and the Ukrainian war the past couple years</p>
<p>have perhaps differed from what you&rsquo;ve noticed</p>
<p>in the United States?</p>
<p>And could you elaborate on those nuances?</p>
<ul>
<li>So the reactions to the increasing inflation rates</li>
</ul>
<p>and the Ukrainian war are actually much less different</p>
<p>than I, you know, the time when you lived in Germany,</p>
<p>the differences between German politics and US politics</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m kind of&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Cleo] That&rsquo;s a good thing for the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m actually happy that we are converging somewhat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s, yeah like, I mean just to kind of compare a little bit</p>
<p>the US and the Europe perspective</p>
<p>on those two things however.</p>
<p>So I mean for starters on the inflation side</p>
<p>we have in Europe we have the ECB Monetary Policy</p>
<p>is made at the EU level, it&rsquo;s decided at the EU level.</p>
<p>And then you have all these member countries</p>
<p>who may do all sorts of stuff on their physical policy side,</p>
<p>which may or may not be consistent with the Monetary Policy</p>
<p>and may or may not make the life of Christine Lagarde</p>
<p>harder or easier.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting difference.</p>
<p>It has been particularly interesting to see</p>
<p>in on the inflation side how, you know,</p>
<p>the US was some month ahead and with inflation increasing</p>
<p>and possibly reacted a little bit too slowly</p>
<p>in kind of reacting to that</p>
<p>and Europe had the benefit of kind of watching that</p>
<p>and like being behind and so you would&rsquo;ve thought</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on it right away,</p>
<p>but they completely followed US as example</p>
<p>and like waited for my days a couple of months too long</p>
<p>before kind of they jumped on, all right,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem we have to deal with.</p>
<p>But yeah, the main difference is kind of this, you know,</p>
<p>ECB doesn&rsquo;t have the dual goal of the Fed here,</p>
<p>which has to care about both inflation and about the,</p>
<p>you know, output gap, the labor markets kind of side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only about stability of money and nevertheless</p>
<p>of course it has to be in the back of the mind</p>
<p>of the ECB president that she doesn&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>kill the economy, which Ann asked me about</p>
<p>already not like in the best shape ever</p>
<p>without declaring it an official goal.</p>
<p>And then also how to make sure</p>
<p>that the European Monetary Union doesn&rsquo;t break apart</p>
<p>if we do something very drastic, you know?</p>
<p>Many of us worry about the high debt quotas</p>
<p>of certain countries in the US, in the EU</p>
<p>and so how do you factor that in?</p>
<p>On the Ukraine war,</p>
<p>I have been mostly fascinated by</p>
<p>the different discussion in the public.</p>
<p>So for example, I dunno whether some of you follow that</p>
<p>on Twitter, there was like this whole group</p>
<p>of macroeconomists, German macroeconomists</p>
<p>but also other ones who are like strongly arguing</p>
<p>for an embargo against the Russian gas,</p>
<p>like a complete embargo.</p>
<p>And the public debate revolved all around that</p>
<p>and people were super interested in that</p>
<p>and back and forth was different argument.</p>
<p>And so how much people would get into</p>
<p>the nitty gritty of that was a strike in contrast.</p>
<p>Also we mentioned the IRA.</p>
<p>You know, in my role, I get invited to talk shows a lot</p>
<p>and so there might be some, you know,</p>
<p>10:00 PM or 11:00 PM talk show and you know,</p>
<p>the secretary or the treasury secretary might be there</p>
<p>and somebody of the position and some journalists and me</p>
<p>and apparently people switch on the TV</p>
<p>and would like to hear about the nitty gritty</p>
<p>about which batteries are subsidized or not</p>
<p>and are discussing about that, very different culture.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of, as I&rsquo;m flying back and forth,</p>
<p>that fascinates me a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Cleo] That&rsquo;s super interesting. Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>And thank you both so much.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, thank you very much for being here today.</li>
</ul>
<p>Myself and many of my classmates as MBAs</p>
<p>are probably going to be mostly engaging with policy</p>
<p>from the private sector side and in the United States</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely a understanding</p>
<p>or at least a preconception that most businesses</p>
<p>get their foot in the door through political contributions.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if you had any thoughts</p>
<p>on how we might better engage with the policy side,</p>
<p>both responsibly and effectively?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I mean we&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about</li>
</ul>
<p>the Inflation Reduction Act</p>
<p>and there are explicit calls for comments</p>
<p>and the companies are submitting comments.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s definitely one approach.</p>
<p>We also had a number, I mean, for instance,</p>
<p>working on the price cap on Russian oil,</p>
<p>we had a number of conversations with business leaders,</p>
<p>with people in the insurance industry</p>
<p>just to try to figure out like how the industry works</p>
<p>and how they might react to this novel policy approach.</p>
<p>I think a lot of those ended up</p>
<p>being organized through lobbyists.</p>
<p>So yeah, kind of having somebody on the ground in DC</p>
<p>who has their ear to the ground and knows, you know,</p>
<p>the week that we&rsquo;re talking about something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s relevant to that, to your company&rsquo;s interest,</p>
<p>that does seem important.</p>
<p>I mean, in DC timing is everything.</p>
<p>I thought about this from the perspective as an academic,</p>
<p>but it just, I now know that if you put out a paper</p>
<p>in the week that people are talking about abortion</p>
<p>and your paper is about climate, it&rsquo;s not gonna land.</p>
<p>If you put it out in the week</p>
<p>that people are talking about climate,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll get traction.</p>
<p>So definitely having somebody on the ground</p>
<p>that knows the week that they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>the issue that&rsquo;s relevant to your company seems important.</p>
<ul>
<li>And I would also want to add to that,</li>
</ul>
<p>that&rsquo;s of course more the German perspective,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know exactly how things are, you know,</p>
<p>work in Washing.</p>
<p>You having that, you know,</p>
<p>that that being on your mind is a really good thing.</p>
<p>And like you asking like what processes,</p>
<p>what mechanisms could be changed</p>
<p>to make sure that we&rsquo;re not having politicians be influenced</p>
<p>too much by certain perspectives from the business</p>
<p>or the anti business side,</p>
<p>I think is a really good thing.</p>
<p>So I found sometimes things kind of fall into place</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the way we do think.</p>
<p>I remember when I still thinking about</p>
<p>whether or not to accept this position</p>
<p>and the Secretary of Economics and Climate,</p>
<p>Robert Habeck called me up and I was talking about</p>
<p>this theme we had today that I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>for good economists to be in the room</p>
<p>and that I regret that Germany</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t implemented this more broadly.</p>
<p>He was saying yes indeed.</p>
<p>So every week I&rsquo;m talking to my Dux CEOs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking about, you know,</p>
<p>that they have to leave Germany,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all too expensive and like explain what the issues are</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m learning a lot,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m always wondering why are there not</p>
<p>any of my economists in the room</p>
<p>or some economists in the room who have like,</p>
<p>who are not necessarily captured by one side</p>
<p>or the other side.</p>
<p>And so not sure he has changed this,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s at least discussion about changing,</p>
<p>like who should be in the room of these discussions,</p>
<p>who might be able to provide a counterpoint.</p>
<p>And so people like you,</p>
<p>your generation going out</p>
<p>and trying to change the mechanism</p>
<p>would be a really great thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Speaker 1] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think we have time for one last question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi. Thank you both for being here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Paul Love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a senior at the Undergraduate Business School.</p>
<p>What I found very interesting in the talk</p>
<p>was kind of this discussion on the, you know,</p>
<p>somewhat like the distortion of incentives.</p>
<p>The example in Germany being, you know,</p>
<p>you open your window and you put the heater on full blast</p>
<p>if the government&rsquo;s gonna cover your energy bill.</p>
<p>I guess just sort of drawing on that, you know, belief</p>
<p>and almost that core tenant of behavioral economics,</p>
<p>when you think about policy making perhaps in other aspects,</p>
<p>you know, whether that be in Germany</p>
<p>or whether that be in the US,</p>
<p>how much of a factor almost is that,</p>
<p>and is there some concern</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re perhaps going down this road where, you know,</p>
<p>at times it can feel like the electorate</p>
<p>feels like that they can vote themselves</p>
<p>all of the dollars and you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s almost this culture of access and you know,</p>
<p>overspending in some sense?</p>
<p>So just curious from both of your perspectives, I guess,</p>
<p>how much is this thought of as a concern in policy making?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that.</p>
<p>So one aspect I picked up from what you said is</p>
<p>the kind of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation part.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re doing what&rsquo;s in your incentive,</p>
<p>you vote for it, you go for it.</p>
<p>And on the other hand you might do things</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s your value and you care about it.</p>
<p>And in fact in behavioral economics,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the debate where the extrinsic motivation</p>
<p>can sometimes kill intrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>And a lot of politicians think about that.</p>
<p>I mentioned Robert Habeck</p>
<p>and one of the first conversation I had with him</p>
<p>was discussing with him a paper in an Israeli childcare</p>
<p>where they show that extrinsic motivation</p>
<p>and he loves that paper and has cited it since then.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of thinking about it,</p>
<p>but what I do want to avoid</p>
<p>is that we contrast one with the other.</p>
<p>So sure we might, you know,</p>
<p>keep the window closed and not have the heater on</p>
<p>and the window open because we say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the moment, we have to get through the winter,</p>
<p>we gonna show it to Russia that we can do that,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and so on and so intrinsic motivation is great.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that financial incentives help too,</p>
<p>and that people will, you know, elect politicians</p>
<p>that will represent their incentives.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both at work and just ignoring one versus the other</p>
<p>is a mistake.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one lesson I, yeah, I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to communicate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have the last word, Catherine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way I experienced that was through gas prices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>People are very, very focused on gas prices</p>
<p>in the administration.</p>
<p>Ron Klain would tweet about gas prices daily practically,</p>
<p>and it did kind of strike me,</p>
<p>is this self-fulfilling?</p>
<p>Is the fact that the administration</p>
<p>is devoting so much attention to gas prices</p>
<p>part of why everyone&rsquo;s focused on gas prices?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question,</p>
<p>but yeah, I do think it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>You know, how much is politics reactive</p>
<p>and how much is politics driving the conversation really.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Paul] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, on that note,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>we are so, so lucky to have these two luminaries here today.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give them an incredible round of applause.</p>
<p>(audience clapping)</p>
