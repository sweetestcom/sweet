going to talk about the salad bloating syndrome you&amp;rsquo;ll find this in any medical disease textbook and i&amp;rsquo;m just kidding because i just made it up right now but it is a situation that comes up now and then i would say about 10 to 15 of the time now as you know i recommend a lot of vegetables between seven to ten cups so and occasionally someone will start bloating and then my name is mud so i want to talk about if you start consuming more salads or vegetables and you start bloating there are four situations going on that we have to do something about okay number one you may have something called sibo small intestinal bacteria overgrowth this is a situation where the bacteria the friendly bacteria that should normally be in the large intestine is not there it&amp;rsquo;s in the small intestine and it&amp;rsquo;s robbing all of the nutrients that are supposed to be absorbed in the small intestine ninety percent of all the food nutrients should be absorbed in the small intestine that&amp;rsquo;s the first part well if you have the majority of bacteria in that location they&amp;rsquo;re going to compete for this nutrition and take this away from you not to mention you&amp;rsquo;re going to start fermenting fiber in the wrong place in your small intestine and you&amp;rsquo;re going to just bloat you&amp;rsquo;re gonna feel very very uncomfortable so and if you have sibo and i put a link down below on a video that describes it more in depth and there&amp;rsquo;s also a test that you can do i would recommend you avoid plant foods for a while for about two months you may want to go on a carnivore diet and take betaine hydrochloride which is going to acidify your stomach take about 5 to 10 of these tablets before each meal and take some oregano oil okay so that&amp;rsquo;s what i would recommend for that situation the second situation is where you have leaky gut that is where the lining of the gut is there&amp;rsquo;s holes in it and you have increased permeability and so all sorts of things can go through that hole and create a reaction with your immune system but primarily it&amp;rsquo;s going to be the lectins in the vegetables so that&amp;rsquo;s going to create an immune reaction it&amp;rsquo;s going to be in the night shades so that would be tomatoes bell pepper eggplant it&amp;rsquo;s definitely going to be very high in beans legumes especially peanuts and grains of course you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be consuming grains if you&amp;rsquo;re on the ketogenic diet so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about that so if you have this severe leaky gut situation and you tried vegetables it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work i would recommend doing more carnivore but make sure that your meats are pasture-raised grass-fed okay because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to consume meats that have been fed grains which are high on omega-6 which also are loaded with lectins that could be a big problem so we want grass-fed grass-finished meats now as far as consuming fats in general you want to avoid all the seed oils for sure it&amp;rsquo;s highly inflammatory the fats that are real safe that are really healing for the gut are the saturated fats as in lard which is pig fat and i&amp;rsquo;m not talking about the pigs that are processed by conventional means i&amp;rsquo;m talking about like something that you would probably order for online that&amp;rsquo;s a lot healthier that&amp;rsquo;s from a farmer that feeds these animals correctly and and doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve the factory farming and then we have talo which is b-fat which is actually very healing for the gut it will not increase inflammation and so you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be afraid of those fats in fact you want to probably cook more with them and stews maybe in sausages and in soups but it&amp;rsquo;s very important to have fatty protein and almost double the fat to your protein ratios in weight not calories if you look at calories it&amp;rsquo;d be like over 80 percent fat to protein so we&amp;rsquo;re talking about weight so like a two to one ratio in very low carbohydrates i created a video on leaky gut i put the link down below the third situation is you just don&amp;rsquo;t have enough good bacteria and so i recommended this to several people and it worked like a charm by taking some probiotics when you consume the salad and it seems to work but make sure that the probiotic that you consume is a non-dairy probiotic it takes a certain quantity of microbes to digest a lot of fiber if you overwhelm the large intestine with too much fiber without enough microbes you&amp;rsquo;re going to get bloating all right so that&amp;rsquo;s a little tip take some probiotics it seems to work all right last scenario you&amp;rsquo;re just sensitive to certain vegetables like broccoli brussels sprouts and there&amp;rsquo;s there&amp;rsquo;s could be quite a few personally i cannot consume broccoli it will rip my intestines up it creates a lot of bloating and pain cabbage i can do cabbage cabbage is very unique cabbage is really good for ulcers it&amp;rsquo;s good for gastritis you might do very well in cabbage but you may not but chances are you probably will be so that would be a really safe vegetable for most people and then just regular lettuce or even arugula pretty safe so you want to focus on those vegetables and maybe not too many cruciferous type vegetables hey before you go real quick i have a course entitled how to bulletproof your immune system it&amp;rsquo;s a free course i want you to take it and here&amp;rsquo;s why here&amp;rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone is focused on this over here avoiding your environment but what about here what about strengthening your immune system that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s missing this course will show you how to bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate and resist your environment much better by strengthening your own immune system i put a link down in the description right down below check it out and get signed up today"><title>Do You Have Salad Bloating Syndrome？ ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

the salad bloating syndrome  </p><p>you&rsquo;ll find this in any medical disease 
textbook and i&rsquo;m just kidding because i  </p><p>just made it up right now but it is a situation 
that comes up now and then i would say about  </p><p>10 to 15 of the time now as you know i 
recommend a lot of vegetables between  </p><p>seven to ten cups so and occasionally someone 
will start bloating and then my name is mud so  </p><p>i want to talk about if you start consuming 
more salads or vegetables and you start bloating  </p><p>there are four situations going on that we have 
to do something about okay number one you may have  </p><p>something called sibo small intestinal bacteria 
overgrowth this is a situation where the bacteria  </p><p>the friendly bacteria that should 
normally be in the large intestine  </p><p>is not there it&rsquo;s in the small intestine and it&rsquo;s 
robbing all of the nutrients that are supposed to  </p><p>be absorbed in the small intestine ninety percent 
of all the food nutrients should be absorbed in  </p><p>the small intestine that&rsquo;s the first part well if 
you have the majority of bacteria in that location  </p><p>they&rsquo;re going to compete for this nutrition and 
take this away from you not to mention you&rsquo;re  </p><p>going to start fermenting fiber in the wrong place 
in your small intestine and you&rsquo;re going to just  </p><p>bloat you&rsquo;re gonna feel very very uncomfortable so 
and if you have sibo and i put a link down below  </p><p>on a video that describes it more in depth 
and there&rsquo;s also a test that you can do  </p><p>i would recommend you avoid plant foods for a 
while for about two months you may want to go on  </p><p>a carnivore diet and take betaine hydrochloride 
which is going to acidify your stomach  </p><p>take about 5 to 10 of these tablets before each 
meal and take some oregano oil okay so that&rsquo;s  </p><p>what i would recommend for that situation the 
second situation is where you have leaky gut  </p><p>that is where the lining of the gut is there&rsquo;s 
holes in it and you have increased permeability  </p><p>and so all sorts of things can go through that 
hole and create a reaction with your immune system  </p><p>but primarily it&rsquo;s going to be the lectins in the 
vegetables so that&rsquo;s going to create an immune  </p><p>reaction it&rsquo;s going to be in the night shades 
so that would be tomatoes bell pepper eggplant  </p><p>it&rsquo;s definitely going to be very high in beans 
legumes especially peanuts and grains of course  </p><p>you&rsquo;re not going to be consuming grains if you&rsquo;re 
on the ketogenic diet so we don&rsquo;t have to worry  </p><p>about that so if you have this severe leaky gut 
situation and you tried vegetables it doesn&rsquo;t work  </p><p>i would recommend doing more carnivore but make 
sure that your meats are pasture-raised grass-fed  </p><p>okay because you don&rsquo;t want to consume meats that 
have been fed grains which are high on omega-6  </p><p>which also are loaded with lectins that could be 
a big problem so we want grass-fed grass-finished  </p><p>meats now as far as consuming fats in general 
you want to avoid all the seed oils for sure  </p><p>it&rsquo;s highly inflammatory the fats that are real 
safe that are really healing for the gut are the  </p><p>saturated fats as in lard which is pig fat and 
i&rsquo;m not talking about the pigs that are processed  </p><p>by conventional means i&rsquo;m talking about like 
something that you would probably order for  </p><p>online that&rsquo;s a lot healthier that&rsquo;s from a farmer 
that feeds these animals correctly and and doesn&rsquo;t  </p><p>involve the factory farming and then we have talo 
which is b-fat which is actually very healing for  </p><p>the gut it will not increase inflammation and 
so you don&rsquo;t want to be afraid of those fats in  </p><p>fact you want to probably cook more with them and 
stews maybe in sausages and in soups but it&rsquo;s very  </p><p>important to have fatty protein and almost double 
the fat to your protein ratios in weight not  </p><p>calories if you look at calories it&rsquo;d be like 
over 80 percent fat to protein so we&rsquo;re talking  </p><p>about weight so like a two to one ratio in very 
low carbohydrates i created a video on leaky gut  </p><p>i put the link down below the third situation 
is you just don&rsquo;t have enough good bacteria  </p><p>and so i recommended this to several people and 
it worked like a charm by taking some probiotics  </p><p>when you consume the salad and it seems to work 
but make sure that the probiotic that you consume  </p><p>is a non-dairy probiotic it takes a certain 
quantity of microbes to digest a lot of fiber  </p><p>if you overwhelm the large intestine with too 
much fiber without enough microbes you&rsquo;re going  </p><p>to get bloating all right so that&rsquo;s a little tip 
take some probiotics it seems to work all right  </p><p>last scenario you&rsquo;re just sensitive to certain 
vegetables like broccoli brussels sprouts and  </p><p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s could be quite a few personally i 
cannot consume broccoli it will rip my intestines  </p><p>up it creates a lot of bloating and pain cabbage 
i can do cabbage cabbage is very unique cabbage  </p><p>is really good for ulcers it&rsquo;s good for gastritis 
you might do very well in cabbage but you may not  </p><p>but chances are you probably will be so that would 
be a really safe vegetable for most people and  </p><p>then just regular lettuce or even arugula pretty 
safe so you want to focus on those vegetables and  </p><p>maybe not too many cruciferous type vegetables hey 
before you go real quick i have a course entitled  </p><p>how to bulletproof your immune system it&rsquo;s a 
free course i want you to take it and here&rsquo;s why  </p><p>here&rsquo;s you here is your environment everyone 
is focused on this over here avoiding  </p><p>your environment but what about here what about 
strengthening your immune system that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s  </p><p>missing this course will show you how to 
bulletproof yourself and so you can tolerate  </p><p>and resist your environment much better by 
strengthening your own immune system i put  </p><p>a link down in the description right down
