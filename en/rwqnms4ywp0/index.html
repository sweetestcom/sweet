Berg here in this video we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about potassium in relationship to your cardiovascular system this little video is based on a really cool article that I put down there to download if you have any cardiovascular problems you need to read this article this is called the new guideline for potassium replacement in clinical practice so it&amp;rsquo;s a group of cardiologists who formed the National Council on potassium and they show the importance of potassium for the cardiovascular system so I want to just kind of cover some of the summaries in what potassium can do first of all if you have a potassium deficiency the name of that disorder is called hypokalemia and you can remember by kale kale right hypokalemia that&amp;rsquo;s low potassium now if you have a potassium deficiency you might feel tired leg cramps muscle weakness constipated tremor because potassium is intimately involved with muscle physiology neurophysiology and cardiovascular physiology so you can also have atrial fibrillation which is a rhythm problem of the heart high blood pressure in fact in most cases of high blood pressure there is a potassium deficiency and what do they give you a diuretic what is diuretics do most of them deplete potassium so it&amp;rsquo;s like a never-ending cycle and then also if you&amp;rsquo;re low on potassium you will have a higher pulse rate potassium lowers your pulse rate okay so now the question is how could you possibly get a potassium deficiency right well here are some of the causes one is maybe too much sodium because when you increase sodium you naturally decrease potassium because they work together but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not potassium maybe it&amp;rsquo;s low manganese or magnesium sir magnesium so when you magnesium is necessary to keep potassium in the right balance and that comes from the vegetables all right insulin high insulin so let&amp;rsquo;s say you have insulin resistance or you&amp;rsquo;re diabetic you know that you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be able to absorb potassium that well and that&amp;rsquo;s why you there&amp;rsquo;s always a diamond fluid choose in fact it takes potassium to heal the insulin dysfunction you can almost correct insulin resistance and improve your blood Sugar&amp;rsquo;s by taking potassium fascinating and then of course too much sugar from the spike insulin will actually deplete potassium too many refined carbs will do it that&amp;rsquo;s why if you consume a lot of sugar all of a sudden your pulse rate starts going higher also high cortisol that&amp;rsquo;s the stress also in a camera a medication called prednisone that can also deplete your potassium of course you have the diarrhea and vomiting to some degree and then also a condition called alkalosis alkalosis is when your body is just too alkaline and I know you&amp;rsquo;ve been taught that people need to just alkalize the body and all this stuff well actually when you go through a lot of stress and you have high levels of cortisol your adrenal body type your pH becomes more on the alkaline side your blood pH becomes excessively alkaline and that&amp;rsquo;s called PAL Colossus and one of the symptoms is a potassium deficiency interesting right surgery in trauma when they do a major abdominal surgery you you&amp;rsquo;re always watching for potassium because that potassium goes down when you&amp;rsquo;re under the SIRT under surgery and you&amp;rsquo;re already deficient potassium you can create some serious problems with the heart so that&amp;rsquo;s why they used to give you a potassium IV when you go through surgery and then trauma I remember I had a bike accident went over the handlebars and I let in the cement and my potassium just went down to zero and I think because when you when you go through stress it spikes adrenaline adrenaline will decrease potassium too and then we have low hydrochloric acid when you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough acid your stomach you can&amp;rsquo;t absorb potassium and then you have potassium problems so it takes potassium to keep the stomach acids correct and also taking potassium will help you digest and create stomach acids so so in other words low potassium can create low hydrochloric acid but then adding acid back in can help you absorb potassium drinking too much water or can deplete your potassium because water is not necessarily filled with electrolytes so you take too much water you drink a gallon and you deplete the last bit of potassium you have and then you end up why with all sorts of dehydration problems right diuretic that&amp;rsquo;s another cause of potassium deficiencies and that comes from when you&amp;rsquo;re on high blood pressure they give you the relic and then you become the task and deficient and then you state you continue to have high blood pressure crazy so in this article that I want you to download these doctors are recommending potassium to prevent and even correct a lot of the cardiovascular problems and potassium has the potential to creep your arteries elastic decrease the risk of the stroke and potassium can protect the kidney and even the heart so this whole idea that if you have a kidney problem you absolutely must stay away from potassium is not necessarily true unless it&amp;rsquo;s a severe case now how do you get potassium beet tops okay but if you don&amp;rsquo;t like the DB tops you just need to start to increase your salad to seven to ten cups of salad why because it takes that much potassium and we need a lot like close to forty seven hundred milligrams potassium is also good for rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory conditions so you can see this mineral is vital so for more information about nutrition and health and how to create a healthy body check out my website at dr."><title>Causes & Symptoms of Potassium Deficiency – Dr. Berg ｜ DrEricBergDC | SWIEST</title>

Berg here in this video we&rsquo;re going 
to talk about potassium in relationship to your  </p><p>cardiovascular system this little video 
is based on a really cool article that  </p><p>I put down there to download if you have any 
cardiovascular problems you need to read this  </p><p>article this is called the new guideline for 
potassium replacement in clinical practice  </p><p>so it&rsquo;s a group of cardiologists who formed the 
National Council on potassium and they show the  </p><p>importance of potassium for the cardiovascular 
system so I want to just kind of cover some of  </p><p>the summaries in what potassium can do first 
of all if you have a potassium deficiency the  </p><p>name of that disorder is called hypokalemia and 
you can remember by kale kale right hypokalemia  </p><p>that&rsquo;s low potassium now if you have a potassium 
deficiency you might feel tired leg cramps muscle  </p><p>weakness constipated tremor because potassium 
is intimately involved with muscle physiology  </p><p>neurophysiology and cardiovascular physiology so 
you can also have atrial fibrillation which is a  </p><p>rhythm problem of the heart high blood pressure in 
fact in most cases of high blood pressure there is  </p><p>a potassium deficiency and what do they give you a 
diuretic what is diuretics do most of them deplete  </p><p>potassium so it&rsquo;s like a never-ending cycle and 
then also if you&rsquo;re low on potassium you will  </p><p>have a higher pulse rate potassium lowers your 
pulse rate okay so now the question is how could  </p><p>you possibly get a potassium deficiency right 
well here are some of the causes one is maybe  </p><p>too much sodium because when you increase sodium 
you naturally decrease potassium because they work  </p><p>together but maybe it&rsquo;s not potassium maybe it&rsquo;s 
low manganese or magnesium sir magnesium so when  </p><p>you magnesium is necessary to keep potassium 
in the right balance and that comes from the  </p><p>vegetables all right insulin high insulin so let&rsquo;s 
say you have insulin resistance or you&rsquo;re diabetic  </p><p>you know that you&rsquo;re not going to be able to 
absorb potassium that well and that&rsquo;s why you  </p><p>there&rsquo;s always a diamond fluid choose in fact it 
takes potassium to heal the insulin dysfunction  </p><p>you can almost correct insulin resistance and 
improve your blood Sugar&rsquo;s by taking potassium  </p><p>fascinating and then of course too much sugar from 
the spike insulin will actually deplete potassium  </p><p>too many refined carbs will do it that&rsquo;s why if 
you consume a lot of sugar all of a sudden your  </p><p>pulse rate starts going higher also high cortisol 
that&rsquo;s the stress also in a camera a medication  </p><p>called prednisone that can also deplete your 
potassium of course you have the diarrhea and  </p><p>vomiting to some degree and then also a condition 
called alkalosis alkalosis is when your body is  </p><p>just too alkaline and I know you&rsquo;ve been taught 
that people need to just alkalize the body and  </p><p>all this stuff well actually when you go through a 
lot of stress and you have high levels of cortisol  </p><p>your adrenal body type your pH becomes more on the 
alkaline side your blood pH becomes excessively  </p><p>alkaline and that&rsquo;s called PAL Colossus and one of 
the symptoms is a potassium deficiency interesting  </p><p>right surgery in trauma when they do a major 
abdominal surgery you you&rsquo;re always watching  </p><p>for potassium because that potassium goes down 
when you&rsquo;re under the SIRT under surgery and  </p><p>you&rsquo;re already deficient potassium you can create 
some serious problems with the heart so that&rsquo;s why  </p><p>they used to give you a potassium IV when you 
go through surgery and then trauma I remember  </p><p>I had a bike accident went over the handlebars 
and I let in the cement and my potassium just  </p><p>went down to zero and I think because when you 
when you go through stress it spikes adrenaline  </p><p>adrenaline will decrease potassium too and then 
we have low hydrochloric acid when you don&rsquo;t  </p><p>have enough acid your stomach you can&rsquo;t absorb 
potassium and then you have potassium problems  </p><p>so it takes potassium to keep the stomach acids 
correct and also taking potassium will help you  </p><p>digest and create stomach acids so so in other 
words low potassium can create low hydrochloric  </p><p>acid but then adding acid back in can help 
you absorb potassium drinking too much water  </p><p>or can deplete your potassium because water is 
not necessarily filled with electrolytes so you  </p><p>take too much water you drink a gallon and you 
deplete the last bit of potassium you have and  </p><p>then you end up why with all sorts of dehydration 
problems right diuretic that&rsquo;s another cause of  </p><p>potassium deficiencies and that comes from when 
you&rsquo;re on high blood pressure they give you the  </p><p>relic and then you become the task and deficient 
and then you state you continue to have high blood  </p><p>pressure crazy so in this article that I want 
you to download these doctors are recommending  </p><p>potassium to prevent and even correct a lot of 
the cardiovascular problems and potassium has the  </p><p>potential to creep your arteries elastic decrease 
the risk of the stroke and potassium can protect  </p><p>the kidney and even the heart so this whole idea 
that if you have a kidney problem you absolutely  </p><p>must stay away from potassium is not necessarily 
true unless it&rsquo;s a severe case now how do you get  </p><p>potassium beet tops okay but if you don&rsquo;t like the 
DB tops you just need to start to increase your  </p><p>salad to seven to ten cups of salad why because it 
takes that much potassium and we need a lot like  </p><p>close to forty seven hundred milligrams potassium 
is also good for rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory  </p><p>conditions so you can see this mineral is 
vital so for more information about nutrition  </p><p>and health and how to create a healthy body check
