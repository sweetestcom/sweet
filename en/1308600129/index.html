    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re discussing water.</p>
<p>Now, to some of you, water might seem like a boring topic,</p>
<p>but I assure you that water is anything but a boring topic.</p>
<p>In fact, water as a substance is incredibly interesting</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons that I&rsquo;ll explain today.</p>
<p>In fact, we are going to discuss</p>
<p>the physics and chemistry of water,</p>
<p>and I promise to make it accessible to anyone and everyone,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you have a physics or chemistry background.</p>
<p>And I will discuss how your body needs and utilizes water,</p>
<p>depending on what type of water you drink,</p>
<p>the temperature of that water, when you drink the water,</p>
<p>and indeed, how you drink that water.</p>
<p>Now, water is actually a pretty controversial topic.</p>
<p>In fact, in preparing for this episode,</p>
<p>which took me several months, in fact,</p>
<p>I ran into highly contradictory information</p>
<p>and had to go on some real deep dives</p>
<p>in order to ferret out</p>
<p>the best and most accurate knowledge for you.</p>
<p>I also found that there are generally</p>
<p>two camps of people out there</p>
<p>in terms of how they think about water</p>
<p>and the consumption of water.</p>
<p>One camp, generally speaking,</p>
<p>is of the mind that tap water is completely safe.</p>
<p>Perhaps it needs a little bit of filtering,</p>
<p>but that in most areas of the world,</p>
<p>if it runs out of the tap,</p>
<p>and unless there&rsquo;s a warning sign directly above the faucet,</p>
<p>that you can drink the tap water.</p>
<p>The other camp seems to be the camp</p>
<p>that does not trust anything that comes out of the tap</p>
<p>and is excited by, and in fact, relies on things</p>
<p>like reverse osmosis, deuterium depleted,</p>
<p>hydrogen rich, or other forms of water</p>
<p>that sometimes can be very expensive</p>
<p>or at least involve some substantial steps</p>
<p>in order to clean, filter, alter the chemistry of,</p>
<p>or in some other way adjust</p>
<p>before they are willing to consume it.</p>
<p>So today, what we&rsquo;re going to try and do</p>
<p>is to address all the stances around water.</p>
<p>For instance, we will discuss whether or not</p>
<p>tap water is indeed safe,</p>
<p>and I will give you some tools that will allow you</p>
<p>to address whether or not</p>
<p>the water coming out of your tap is safe,</p>
<p>as well as some tools that will allow you to address</p>
<p>how to clean that water</p>
<p>if indeed it does need filtering and cleaning,</p>
<p>in particular for things like fluorides</p>
<p>and endocrine disruptors,</p>
<p>which it turns out are quite prominent in a lot,</p>
<p>not all, but a lot of tap water sources.</p>
<p>I will also talk about the more, quote unquote,</p>
<p>esoteric forms of water that I mentioned a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>So I will go systematically through the list</p>
<p>of distilled, reverse osmosis, spring water,</p>
<p>deuterium depleted water, high pH water.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are already screaming out</p>
<p>as you hear this, oh no,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to tell us that pH water</p>
<p>can alter the pH of our body in helpful ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you that,</p>
<p>but I will tell you that the alkalinity</p>
<p>or acidity of the water,</p>
<p>that is the pH of the water that you drink,</p>
<p>has a profound impact on your ability</p>
<p>to absorb and utilize that water</p>
<p>and the impact that those water molecules have</p>
<p>on specific biological systems.</p>
<p>So it turns out pH is very important,</p>
<p>but not for the reasons</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve probably heard about previously.</p>
<p>I will talk about how the temperature of water</p>
<p>that you drink does indeed turn out to be important</p>
<p>for the rate of absorption of that water</p>
<p>and its impact on the cells, tissues,</p>
<p>and organs of your body and thereby your health.</p>
<p>And I will talk about various zero cost</p>
<p>and low cost tools that you can use</p>
<p>in order to get the most out of the water that you drink.</p>
<p>And finally, I will talk about</p>
<p>when and how to hydrate your body best.</p>
<p>Before we dive into today&rsquo;s topic,</p>
<p>I want to share with you some very interesting results</p>
<p>that were just published</p>
<p>on the use of deliberate cold exposure to benefit fat loss.</p>
<p>Now, deliberate cold exposure is a topic</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered before on this podcast.</p>
<p>We have an entire episode about that</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve linked in the show note captions.</p>
<p>Deliberate cold exposure can be done by way of cold showers</p>
<p>or immersion in cold or ice water up to the neck.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s typically the ways that it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>It has been shown to reduce inflammation,</p>
<p>to increase metabolism.</p>
<p>And I think some of the most exciting results</p>
<p>that have been published are the results,</p>
<p>certainly in humans,</p>
<p>showing that deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can increase the release of so-called catecholamines,</p>
<p>which are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.</p>
<p>And those increases in those three molecules</p>
<p>are quite long lasting and lead to substantial increases</p>
<p>in mood and focus throughout the day.</p>
<p>Now, many people out there</p>
<p>hear about deliberate cold exposure and cringe.</p>
<p>Other people hear about it and cringe</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve heard that deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>especially by way of immersion in water,</p>
<p>can block the adaptation to strength or hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is yes, indeed,</p>
<p>there are data showing that if one gets into very cold water</p>
<p>up to the neck in the six hours, anytime that is,</p>
<p>in the six hours after strength or hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>that some of the strength and hypertrophy increases</p>
<p>that one would observe are blocked</p>
<p>by that deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>However, after six hours does not seem to be a problem.</p>
<p>So it can be done on other days</p>
<p>besides the strength and hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>It can be done before strength and hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>It can be done after endurance work.</p>
<p>And I should mention that it does not appear</p>
<p>that cold showers disrupt the adaptations</p>
<p>to strength and hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>even if they are done immediately</p>
<p>after strength or hypertrophy training.</p>
<p>Okay, with that said,</p>
<p>many people do enjoy the effects of deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>in particular for those increases in mood and alertness</p>
<p>that are the consequence of those increases</p>
<p>in the catecholamines, dopamine,</p>
<p>norepinephrine, and epinephrine.</p>
<p>And again, those increases are very long lasting.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just during the exposure to cold,</p>
<p>it is for several hours, up to four,</p>
<p>maybe even five or six hours,</p>
<p>depending on how cold</p>
<p>and how long the deliberate cold exposure happens to be.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s a lot to say</p>
<p>and explore about deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;ll just refer you to the episode</p>
<p>on deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the mechanisms</p>
<p>and the positive health outcomes,</p>
<p>some of the controversies within the data, et cetera,</p>
<p>within that episode.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I definitely want to share with you</p>
<p>the results of this recent study that just came out.</p>
<p>The title of this study is</p>
<p>Impact of Cold Exposure on Life Satisfaction</p>
<p>and Physical Composition of Soldiers.</p>
<p>The reason this study is very interesting</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s one of the few studies that used,</p>
<p>I should say explored both deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>by immersion in cold water,</p>
<p>as well as deliberate cold exposure by way of cold showers</p>
<p>as it relates to weight loss.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s already data out there</p>
<p>on the effects of deliberate cold exposure and metabolism.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m mainly referring to the beautiful work</p>
<p>of Dr. Susanna Soberg and colleagues in Scandinavia</p>
<p>that showed that people that do 11 minutes total</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure by immersion in cold water</p>
<p>up to the neck per week.</p>
<p>So 11 minutes per week total</p>
<p>spread out across some different sessions</p>
<p>by way of getting into water</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uncomfortably cold up to the neck</p>
<p>and then getting out</p>
<p>and then doing that several times per week</p>
<p>to hit that 11 minutes or more threshold.</p>
<p>And this is very important.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come up in a moment in the context of this new study</p>
<p>and warming up not by getting into a warm shower,</p>
<p>which is frankly what I do after my cold showers</p>
<p>or getting into the ice bath or cold water immersion,</p>
<p>but rather forcing their body to warm up naturally</p>
<p>by using its own metabolic abilities.</p>
<p>In those studies,</p>
<p>they observed substantial increases in brown fat stores,</p>
<p>which are fat stores that you really want</p>
<p>around the heart and clavicles,</p>
<p>increases in metabolism that were quite dramatic,</p>
<p>in my opinion,</p>
<p>and that could be very beneficial</p>
<p>for allowing people to feel more comfortable</p>
<p>at cold temperatures when they&rsquo;re not in cold water</p>
<p>and on and on.</p>
<p>So lots of benefits shown in that study.</p>
<p>In this study,</p>
<p>what I thought was particularly interesting is again,</p>
<p>they explored both immersion in cold water</p>
<p>and cold showers and the duration of cold exposure</p>
<p>that they found led to substantial fat loss,</p>
<p>especially around the abdomen</p>
<p>was very brief deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Let me give you a few details about this study.</p>
<p>The study involved 49 subjects</p>
<p>that include both males and females.</p>
<p>This is also really important.</p>
<p>The beautiful work of Susanna Soberg and colleagues,</p>
<p>as far as I know,</p>
<p>only looked at males.</p>
<p>This study looked at males and females.</p>
<p>They were 19 to 30 years old</p>
<p>and there basically were two groups.</p>
<p>People either were assigned to get deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>or they were not assigned to deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>The form of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>involved one session per week of cold immersion</p>
<p>in cold water up to the neck.</p>
<p>And to just give you a sense of how cold it was,</p>
<p>it was three degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>which translates to about 37 and a half degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty darn cold,</p>
<p>but it was only for two minutes.</p>
<p>So one session at three degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>otherwise known as 37.4 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>for two minutes every week, once a week.</p>
<p>In addition, the same subjects</p>
<p>did five cold showers per week</p>
<p>or a minimum of five cold showers per week.</p>
<p>And those cold showers were slightly warmer</p>
<p>than the immersion in cold water condition.</p>
<p>So they were 10 degrees Celsius approximately</p>
<p>or 50 degrees Fahrenheit, still pretty cold.</p>
<p>And the duration of that cold water exposure in the shower</p>
<p>was just for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is interesting to me</p>
<p>because many people don&rsquo;t have access</p>
<p>to cold water immersion.</p>
<p>They might not have an ice bath or any place they can do that</p>
<p>but most people do have access</p>
<p>to a cold shower of some sort.</p>
<p>Plus, I think most people could do</p>
<p>probably one ice bath per week</p>
<p>or find a place where they could get</p>
<p>into cold water safely.</p>
<p>Now I should point out that some people</p>
<p>will not do well going into 37.5 degree Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>AKA three degrees Celsius water,</p>
<p>having never done anything like this before.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to try and employ</p>
<p>these sorts of protocols that were used in the study,</p>
<p>I do recommend that you ease into it</p>
<p>over the course of a week or so</p>
<p>and become somewhat adapted</p>
<p>to the shock of cold water exposure.</p>
<p>So maybe start at 50 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>kind of ease your way back</p>
<p>in terms of the cold water immersion especially.</p>
<p>Now, another critical feature of this study</p>
<p>is as with the beautiful work by Susanna Soberg,</p>
<p>the subjects were told to warm up naturally</p>
<p>after the deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>So they basically hung out</p>
<p>outside of the cold water immersion</p>
<p>or outside of the cold shower for 10 minutes</p>
<p>after they were exposed to the cold</p>
<p>in their bathing suit</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m assuming they were wearing something.</p>
<p>But the point is that you are not going</p>
<p>from deliberate cold exposure directly into a hot shower</p>
<p>or a sauna or something of that sort.</p>
<p>So again, their bodies were forced to heat up again,</p>
<p>naturally after the deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>but after the 10 minute period,</p>
<p>they were able to do whatever they wanted essentially,</p>
<p>reclothe, take a warm shower and so on</p>
<p>and go about their day.</p>
<p>Now, the results of this deliberate cold exposure protocol,</p>
<p>again, two minutes in cold immersion</p>
<p>at three degrees Celsius, 37.5 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>plus five cold showers per week of two minutes long,</p>
<p>a little bit warmer,</p>
<p>10 degrees Celsius, 50 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Now, the deliberate cold exposure used in this study</p>
<p>caused many different statistically</p>
<p>significant positive changes.</p>
<p>They had a very extensive questionnaire</p>
<p>that related to mood,</p>
<p>everything from levels of anxiety to sexual satisfaction</p>
<p>and on and on.</p>
<p>In fact, they saw a statistically significant improvement</p>
<p>in sexual satisfaction</p>
<p>in the subjects that were exposed to deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>not in the control group.</p>
<p>Although they didn&rsquo;t look at this,</p>
<p>chances are those improvements in sexual satisfaction</p>
<p>were the downstream consequence of the known increases</p>
<p>in testosterone and free testosterone</p>
<p>that occur in both men and women</p>
<p>who do this sorts of deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Again, testosterone being an important hormone</p>
<p>for libido in both men and women.</p>
<p>They also saw improvements in regulation of anxiety,</p>
<p>which I think is very interesting,</p>
<p>given that the deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>often causes people anxiety,</p>
<p>but here and in other studies,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen it can lead to a better ability</p>
<p>to buffer against anxiety</p>
<p>in the normal happenings of everyday life.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting and significant results</p>
<p>that they found in the study, however,</p>
<p>were that in particular in men,</p>
<p>there was a reduction in waist circumference</p>
<p>following eight weeks of this deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>as well as a 5.5% on average,</p>
<p>5.5% reduction in abdominal fat</p>
<p>that was quite statistically significant</p>
<p>when compared to the other groups.</p>
<p>Now, why there was no observed reduction in abdominal fat</p>
<p>or waist circumference in the female subjects isn&rsquo;t clear,</p>
<p>could have to do with just the way</p>
<p>that body fat is stored and metabolized</p>
<p>in females versus males.</p>
<p>That is going to be a topic for future exploration.</p>
<p>So I do think this study is very interesting</p>
<p>because when you look at the landscape of science</p>
<p>and discussion around deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a general consensus now</p>
<p>that deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>can change one&rsquo;s sense of mood and wellbeing</p>
<p>through the increases in catecholamines</p>
<p>that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>But the impact on metabolism itself</p>
<p>has been somewhat controversial</p>
<p>because the overall changes in metabolism</p>
<p>that are observed while statistically significant</p>
<p>in many studies have not ever really been shown</p>
<p>to translate into weight loss or body fat loss</p>
<p>in any kind of specific way.</p>
<p>And of course, a great advantage of this study</p>
<p>is that by exploring soldiers,</p>
<p>they were able to really hold constant</p>
<p>a number of other features,</p>
<p>like the amount of daily activity</p>
<p>that those soldiers are exposed to,</p>
<p>their diet, their living conditions,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So at least insofar as human studies are done,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very well-controlled study.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link to the study in the show note captions.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are thinking</p>
<p>about employing the protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s used in this particular paper</p>
<p>or combining it with existing</p>
<p>deliberate cold exposure protocols,</p>
<p>to me, it seems pretty straightforward</p>
<p>and a pretty minimal time investment,</p>
<p>just two minutes of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>by way of water immersion up to the neck</p>
<p>and five times a week of 30 seconds each</p>
<p>of deliberate cold exposure by way of cold shower.</p>
<p>And just a quick mention about cold showers,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to use cold showers</p>
<p>to do deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to stand under the shower itself,</p>
<p>and essentially have it hit your head,</p>
<p>the back of your neck and your upper back,</p>
<p>which is where most of your brown fat stores</p>
<p>are concentrated.</p>
<p>It turns out that cold exposure</p>
<p>to those regions of the body in particular</p>
<p>are going to trigger the adaptation</p>
<p>of increased brown fat stores,</p>
<p>which involves increases in mitochondria in those fat.</p>
<p>Again, this is not the blubbery fat beneath the skin.</p>
<p>This is the fat that acts as kind of an oil in the furnace</p>
<p>that is your thermogenic properties of your body</p>
<p>to generate heat and burn off</p>
<p>so-called white adipose tissue elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>Now, anyone that understands the laws of physics</p>
<p>and thermodynamics will be saying,</p>
<p>wait, in order to get fat loss,</p>
<p>you need to have a caloric deficit.</p>
<p>Calories in, calories out still applies.</p>
<p>And yes, that&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>We can only conclude on the basis of the results</p>
<p>of this study that the people that lost body fat</p>
<p>were indeed in a caloric deficit,</p>
<p>presumably because all other factors</p>
<p>were held more or less constant in this group of soldiers,</p>
<p>presumably because the deliberate cold exposure itself</p>
<p>elevated metabolism,</p>
<p>thereby increasing the calories out component</p>
<p>of the calories in, calories out equation,</p>
<p>which of course governs the rules of weight loss</p>
<p>and body fat loss as well.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes custom nootropics.</p>
<p>Now, nootropics is a word that I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it because it means smart drugs.</p>
<p>And as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>we know that we have brain circuits for focus,</p>
<p>brain circuits that enable creativity,</p>
<p>brain circuits that allow task switching, and on and on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s really no such thing</p>
<p>as a brain circuit for being smart.</p>
<p>Now, Thesis understands this</p>
<p>and has designed custom nootropics</p>
<p>that are designed to get your brain and body</p>
<p>into the optimal state for the specific types of work</p>
<p>that is physical or cognitive work that you want to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than a year now,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s completely changed the way that I approach work.</p>
<p>I typically take the clarity formula</p>
<p>prior to doing any kind of cognitive work,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll take their energy formula often before workouts.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try</p>
<p>your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and take their brief three-minute quiz.</p>
<p>That quiz will allow them</p>
<p>to send you four different trial formulas</p>
<p>that you can use for a month,</p>
<p>and then you can iterate with them</p>
<p>to find the ideal nootropic formulas for you.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by HVMN Ketone IQ.</p>
<p>Ketone IQ is a ketone supplement</p>
<p>that increases blood ketones.</p>
<p>Now, many people have heard of the ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>and indeed, the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>has been useful for many people out there.</p>
<p>However, most people out there, including myself,</p>
<p>do not follow a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>That is, I eat carbohydrates.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to note</p>
<p>that even if you are not on a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>you can benefit from increasing your blood ketones.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll use ketone IQ after lunch</p>
<p>or in the afternoon with some coffee</p>
<p>or sometimes first thing in the morning</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m particularly hungry and I want to do exercise</p>
<p>or I want to do cognitive work,</p>
<p>but I want to delay my first meal.</p>
<p>Using ketone IQ allows me to curb my hunger</p>
<p>and gives me a lot of focus and energy,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because ketones</p>
<p>are one of the brain&rsquo;s preferred fuels for cognitive work.</p>
<p>In fact, ketones have been shown</p>
<p>to be associated with forebrain function,</p>
<p>which is associated with context switching,</p>
<p>focus, and formulations of strategies, et cetera,</p>
<p>all the sorts of things that are important</p>
<p>for doing deliberate focused work or physical performance.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about water,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s start off by answering the question,</p>
<p>what is water?</p>
<p>Water is of course H2O.</p>
<p>Most everybody knows that from an early age,</p>
<p>but what H2O means is that each molecule of water</p>
<p>consists of two hydrogens and one oxygen.</p>
<p>Now the physical arrangement of those two hydrogens</p>
<p>and one oxygen turns out to be really important</p>
<p>for how water functions in the body</p>
<p>and frankly elsewhere in our world and life.</p>
<p>If you were to make a peace symbol,</p>
<p>that is to put up your index finger</p>
<p>and your middle finger simultaneously,</p>
<p>in fact, I&rsquo;m going to recommend you do that now,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re using your hands for something else important,</p>
<p>in which case do it later.</p>
<p>Well, if you make that peace symbol</p>
<p>and you look at your hand,</p>
<p>you have a pretty good impression</p>
<p>of what an individual water molecule consists of,</p>
<p>which is H2O, two hydrogens and an oxygen.</p>
<p>And with that peace symbol,</p>
<p>the fingers or the tips of your fingers rather</p>
<p>are going to represent the hydrogens.</p>
<p>Your fingers, that is the length of each of those fingers</p>
<p>is going to represent the electron bonds to the oxygen</p>
<p>and the palm of your hand</p>
<p>and the fingers that are down</p>
<p>are going to represent the oxygen, okay?</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s important about that visual impression</p>
<p>or visual image of the individual water molecule</p>
<p>is that it is polarized.</p>
<p>That is the hydrogens over on one side,</p>
<p>both of them are over on one side</p>
<p>and the oxygen is over on another.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really important about water molecules</p>
<p>being polarized is that they can bind to one another</p>
<p>by way of that polarization.</p>
<p>And this has to do with something</p>
<p>that we all kind of learned in chemistry at one point,</p>
<p>but many of us forgot.</p>
<p>Maybe we didn&rsquo;t even understand it the first time around,</p>
<p>which is that positives and negatives attract.</p>
<p>So when you have individual water molecules,</p>
<p>they have the opportunity to interact</p>
<p>and essentially bind to one another.</p>
<p>And they bind through what are called covalent bonds.</p>
<p>Covalent bonds are relatively weak bonds.</p>
<p>And so as a consequence, water can change its conformation.</p>
<p>However, covalent bonds are strong enough</p>
<p>that water actually can maintain some structure</p>
<p>and that structure will vary, of course,</p>
<p>depending on its temperature.</p>
<p>So what you need to know about water is that indeed,</p>
<p>it consists of lots of individual H2Os</p>
<p>and those H2Os can arrange themselves in different ways.</p>
<p>And that temperature is a strong determinant</p>
<p>of the arrangement of those water molecules.</p>
<p>That is, they&rsquo;re bonding to one another.</p>
<p>And in fact, even they&rsquo;re spacing between those bonds.</p>
<p>So again, even if you don&rsquo;t have any chemistry,</p>
<p>stay with me because you&rsquo;ll definitely understand this.</p>
<p>Water can exist in at least three forms</p>
<p>and maybe four forms.</p>
<p>We know that it can be liquid, of course.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really normally what we think of</p>
<p>when we think of water.</p>
<p>It can be gas, so we think of steam, right?</p>
<p>So if you heat it up, it takes on a,</p>
<p>not a semi-solid or a semi-liquid form.</p>
<p>It takes on this property of steam or gas, okay?</p>
<p>So when you see steam or when you breathe on a cold day</p>
<p>through your mouth or through your nose</p>
<p>and you see your air,</p>
<p>those are water molecules that are condensing,</p>
<p>that is bonding in certain ways</p>
<p>based on differences in temperature</p>
<p>between the inside of your body and the outside air.</p>
<p>And of course it can be a solid, it can be ice.</p>
<p>Now, ice is fascinating and important</p>
<p>in understanding how water works.</p>
<p>And this will become relevant later</p>
<p>when we think about how water works within the body as well,</p>
<p>especially how different temperatures of water</p>
<p>impact the health and behavior of our cells.</p>
<p>And the most important point to understand</p>
<p>about water in its solid state</p>
<p>is that unlike most substances,</p>
<p>when water is in its solid state,</p>
<p>it is actually less dense than when it&rsquo;s in its liquid state.</p>
<p>So just think about that.</p>
<p>Most substances, like most metals for instance,</p>
<p>when they are in a solid state,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more dense than when they&rsquo;re in a liquid state.</p>
<p>So for instance, if they&rsquo;re in a solid state,</p>
<p>they will sink in a container filled with their liquid form,</p>
<p>not water.</p>
<p>Water is very interesting because as you cool water</p>
<p>and water transitions from a liquid to a solid,</p>
<p>it still binds.</p>
<p>That is, it could form bonds</p>
<p>between those different molecules of water,</p>
<p>but the spacing between those H2Os,</p>
<p>so again, those peace symbols with hands,</p>
<p>if you had a bunch of those,</p>
<p>if you had a thousand hands all making peace symbols,</p>
<p>they can bond to one another.</p>
<p>But when it&rsquo;s cold,</p>
<p>those bonds are actually made further apart</p>
<p>from one another.</p>
<p>As a consequence, ice, as we all know, floats in water.</p>
<p>In other words, put very simply,</p>
<p>water is unusual and special in that in its solid form,</p>
<p>ice, it is actually less dense</p>
<p>than when it&rsquo;s in its liquid form.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why ice floats in water.</p>
<p>Now this is important, not just to our biology,</p>
<p>but to all of life.</p>
<p>Because if you think about it,</p>
<p>if it were not the case that water is less dense</p>
<p>in its solid form, ice, than it is in its liquid form,</p>
<p>the bottoms of our oceans</p>
<p>would be covered with thick sheets of ice.</p>
<p>And if that were the case,</p>
<p>you can be absolutely sure</p>
<p>that life would not exist on our planet the way that it does</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a good chance</p>
<p>that we would not exist as a species</p>
<p>because so much of what allows us to exist on this planet</p>
<p>and the other animals to exist on this planet</p>
<p>relies on photosynthesis pathways</p>
<p>and plants that are dependent on the sun</p>
<p>and interactions with the oceans and lakes</p>
<p>and other bodies of water.</p>
<p>And of course, the ice caps are vitally important.</p>
<p>That is the presence of ice, especially at the poles,</p>
<p>but elsewhere in bodies of water as well.</p>
<p>So called icebergs are a critical part of the ecosystem</p>
<p>that allows for everything from photosynthesis</p>
<p>to the ability of certain animals</p>
<p>to extract food from each other</p>
<p>and from their local resources.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a whole discussion to be had there,</p>
<p>but the important point for now</p>
<p>is that the physical properties of the bonds between water</p>
<p>that are made and changed depending on temperature</p>
<p>turn out to be essential</p>
<p>for us to be present on this planet at all</p>
<p>and for our cells to function in the ways that they do</p>
<p>for sake of health and for sake of disease.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll explore this later</p>
<p>when we talk about the critical relationship</p>
<p>between temperature, pH,</p>
<p>which is the relationship between alkalinity, how basic,</p>
<p>or acidity, how acid a given liquid,</p>
<p>or in this case, we&rsquo;re gonna be talking about water is,</p>
<p>and the ways that our cells can or can&rsquo;t use water.</p>
<p>So I realized that this is a fairly in-depth</p>
<p>for those of you that don&rsquo;t have much of a background</p>
<p>in chemistry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it really top contour,</p>
<p>but if you can make a peace symbol</p>
<p>or if you can just imagine a peace symbol in your mind</p>
<p>and realize that that&rsquo;s a water molecule</p>
<p>and that those water molecules can bind to one another</p>
<p>through bonds that are relatively strong,</p>
<p>but weak enough that they can be broken if they need to,</p>
<p>and that the temperature</p>
<p>that those water molecules are exposed to</p>
<p>changes the distance between those bonds,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what allows ice to float in water,</p>
<p>then you are gonna have no problem</p>
<p>with the remainder of the discussion today.</p>
<p>In fact, you will also have the ability</p>
<p>to understand things that you&rsquo;ve observed many times over,</p>
<p>but perhaps have never thought about</p>
<p>or really understood, which are, for instance,</p>
<p>that water has a certain level of surface tension.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;ve ever been to the ocean</p>
<p>and the waves are coming in,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll notice is if you walk on the dry sand</p>
<p>or gravel, pebbles, that is, of the ocean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the pebbles move down or the sand moves down,</p>
<p>it depresses a little bit due to the weight of your body,</p>
<p>but as you get closer to the water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna sink deeper</p>
<p>because that sand is more saturated with water,</p>
<p>but at some point,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t be able to actually walk on top of the water,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>It has been said that Jesus walked on water,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the so-called Jesus Christ lizard,</p>
<p>so named because it can actually walk</p>
<p>on the surface of water.</p>
<p>A leaf can float on the surface of water.</p>
<p>Under some conditions,</p>
<p>a coin can float on the surface of water.</p>
<p>If you make coffee in the morning,</p>
<p>you can actually take a spoonful of that hot coffee</p>
<p>and pour a little bit on the surface of your coffee</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll notice that it will bead up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get little round spheres of water.</p>
<p>Those are little water molecules bound to one another</p>
<p>that spin on top of the surface before they sink under.</p>
<p>That has everything to do with the bonding between water</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dependent on temperature,</p>
<p>but also as with the difficulty for essentially everybody</p>
<p>to walk on water or for animals to walk on water,</p>
<p>the surface tension of water allows certain things</p>
<p>to float there or to stay at the surface,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a very thin layer of water molecules</p>
<p>at the surface of water that are more dense</p>
<p>than the water that resides at deeper depths</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why most things, including us, sink in water.</p>
<p>We are more dense than water.</p>
<p>Now, I did mention earlier</p>
<p>that there are three forms of water.</p>
<p>Those are the ones that we all are familiar with,</p>
<p>the solid, liquid, and gas forms of water.</p>
<p>However, there are data mainly from Gerald Pollack&rsquo;s</p>
<p>laboratory at the University of Washington</p>
<p>that have described the so-called fourth phase of water,</p>
<p>which is structured water.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get into this a little bit later</p>
<p>because structured water has really been a prominent topic</p>
<p>in the, let&rsquo;s call it the water health aficionados.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a heavily debated topic</p>
<p>as to whether or not structured water</p>
<p>is somehow better for ourselves,</p>
<p>if it exists within our bodies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into that in full detail later,</p>
<p>but the whole notion of structured water</p>
<p>is that in the presence of certain solids or certain liquids</p>
<p>the conformation of water, that is the water molecules,</p>
<p>actually change somewhat.</p>
<p>This has been demonstrated.</p>
<p>Whether or not it has relevance</p>
<p>to the biological function of our body is a different issue,</p>
<p>but we know that there is this fourth phase of water</p>
<p>called structured water.</p>
<p>Structured water is a fairly complicated topic,</p>
<p>but we can make it very simple</p>
<p>for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that opposite poles attract,</p>
<p>that is positives and negatives attract,</p>
<p>and typically things that are negatively charged</p>
<p>when presented with another negative charge</p>
<p>either repel or don&rsquo;t attract.</p>
<p>Things that are positively charged</p>
<p>in the presence of another positive charge</p>
<p>also tend to repel.</p>
<p>This is the basis of magnets,</p>
<p>either sticking to one another</p>
<p>or repelling from one another.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the idea that human beings</p>
<p>who are opposites attract,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a different episode</p>
<p>that we need to do in the future.</p>
<p>The point here is that structured water</p>
<p>is a unique condition in which the local environment</p>
<p>that these water molecules happen to be in</p>
<p>allows positive charges between different water molecules</p>
<p>to attract one another.</p>
<p>So again, whereas normally it&rsquo;s positive and negatives</p>
<p>that attract, in the configuration</p>
<p>that we call structured water,</p>
<p>positives and positives attract</p>
<p>and form bonds that are stronger</p>
<p>than the typical bonds that would be formed</p>
<p>between water molecules.</p>
<p>And just as a kind of prelude to our discussion</p>
<p>about structured water,</p>
<p>as it may or may not relate to health later,</p>
<p>there are a number of people that believe</p>
<p>that within the body,</p>
<p>because of the presence of certain liquids and solids,</p>
<p>that the water within our cells,</p>
<p>and in particular within the interactions</p>
<p>with so-called organelles,</p>
<p>organelles are things like mitochondria,</p>
<p>the Golgi apparatus, they have fancy names.</p>
<p>These are the things within cells</p>
<p>that allow cells to do everything from make proteins</p>
<p>to traffic proteins out to the surface of cells,</p>
<p>things like neurotransmitters and receptors and so on.</p>
<p>A lot of people who are interested in structured water</p>
<p>as it relates to biological function</p>
<p>have hypothesized or like to debate rather,</p>
<p>whether or not in the body,</p>
<p>water is not just present in its liquid form</p>
<p>or gaseous form.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s not present in its solid form</p>
<p>unless you gulp down some ice cubes, for instance.</p>
<p>But there is a cohort of people out there,</p>
<p>including some fairly accomplished scientists</p>
<p>that believe that within the body,</p>
<p>the organelles of our cells act as a substrate</p>
<p>for water to exist in this fourth form,</p>
<p>this structured water form.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s led to this whole niche industry</p>
<p>of people who are proponents</p>
<p>of consuming so-called structured water.</p>
<p>Again, we&rsquo;ll get to that a little bit later.</p>
<p>So now you know what individual water molecules consist of</p>
<p>when you hear H2O,</p>
<p>hopefully you&rsquo;ll get that visual image in your mind</p>
<p>of an individual water molecule being the peace symbol</p>
<p>and a bunch of those binding to one another</p>
<p>through these relatively weak bonds,</p>
<p>but strong enough that certain things can take place</p>
<p>like surface tension.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that surface tension of water</p>
<p>may relate to either standard bonds between water</p>
<p>or this fourth phase.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s heavily debated still.</p>
<p>But we certainly know that, for instance,</p>
<p>if you were to take a piece of wax paper or glass</p>
<p>and you were to pour some water on it,</p>
<p>you would notice that the water would bead up</p>
<p>or kind of aggregate at particular locations.</p>
<p>When you see that beading up</p>
<p>or the aggregation of water molecules</p>
<p>on a particular surface, you&rsquo;re seeing two things.</p>
<p>This is actually kind of fun.</p>
<p>The next time you see it, you&rsquo;ll know that the aggregation,</p>
<p>the beading up of water with itself,</p>
<p>so individual water molecules or many water molecules</p>
<p>kind of aggregating at one location</p>
<p>and making a bead of water,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s due to these bonds,</p>
<p>these covalent bonds occurring between water molecules.</p>
<p>But also you&rsquo;ll notice that on a vertical pane of glass,</p>
<p>say in rain or on your windshield,</p>
<p>that the water will look almost like it&rsquo;s sticking</p>
<p>to the glass.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because there are actually bonds</p>
<p>between the water molecules that have beaded up themselves</p>
<p>and the glass.</p>
<p>So water can not just bind to itself,</p>
<p>it can also bind to certain surfaces.</p>
<p>And the fact that perhaps if you drive your car,</p>
<p>if you were to tap the window,</p>
<p>or if a big enough bead of water formed on a window</p>
<p>that it would start to drip down,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because those bonds with the surface are strong,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not so strong that it stick at that location.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s quite different than water</p>
<p>that is in its solid form, ice,</p>
<p>that can actually really adhere.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had to scrape ice off a windshield,</p>
<p>so for those of you who live in cold regions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re familiar with this,</p>
<p>have to scrape ice off a windshield,</p>
<p>you realize that the bonds between water in its solid form</p>
<p>and different surfaces is quite a bit stronger</p>
<p>than the bonds between different water molecules</p>
<p>with each other,</p>
<p>or the bonds between water and different surfaces</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re warmer.</p>
<p>So I do realize that for a lot of people listening,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be a pretty deep dive</p>
<p>into the chemistry and physical properties of water.</p>
<p>But all you really need to know</p>
<p>is that these water molecules are incredibly versatile</p>
<p>and can bind to each other</p>
<p>and can bind to different surfaces</p>
<p>and can allow things to float or to sink</p>
<p>or even to move across surfaces of water</p>
<p>based on the three, perhaps four different states</p>
<p>that water can be in.</p>
<p>And that versatility that you observe in the natural world</p>
<p>on window panes and rain and clouds and hail and ice</p>
<p>and snow and scraping ice off your windshield</p>
<p>in the cold of winter and perspiration and so on,</p>
<p>all of that is fine and good,</p>
<p>but realize that almost all of those same sorts</p>
<p>of properties of water become extremely relevant</p>
<p>when thinking about how your body actually utilizes water.</p>
<p>And the key thing here is that temperature</p>
<p>and the so-called alkalinity or acidity,</p>
<p>that is the pH of water,</p>
<p>turn out to be very important determinants</p>
<p>of how water is used by the cells of your body.</p>
<p>In fact, as I&rsquo;ll describe in a moment,</p>
<p>we have entire sets of biological mechanisms</p>
<p>solely devoted to trying to get water into our cells</p>
<p>in very specific ways, including at specific rates</p>
<p>and to use water in different ways</p>
<p>because as you&rsquo;ve probably heard before,</p>
<p>we are mostly water.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s kind of interesting to me</p>
<p>and what I found researching this episode</p>
<p>is that the percentages of our cells and bodies</p>
<p>that are purported to be water is a pretty broad range.</p>
<p>Some people will say we&rsquo;re 55% water.</p>
<p>Other people will say we&rsquo;re 70% water.</p>
<p>Some people say we&rsquo;re 95% water.</p>
<p>The exact percentage doesn&rsquo;t matter so much</p>
<p>and really just boils down to whether or not</p>
<p>the person that&rsquo;s stating that percentage</p>
<p>is talking about how much water is present</p>
<p>in our cells and body at a given moment</p>
<p>versus how much water was involved in the process</p>
<p>of creating the sorts of proteins</p>
<p>and other things of our body that are required</p>
<p>to have hair cells, skin cells, brain cells, et cetera.</p>
<p>So if you really want a number out there,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give you a single number.</p>
<p>If you want to be accurate, it&rsquo;s going to have to be a range</p>
<p>and basically we are anywhere from 70% to 90% water</p>
<p>depending on how you define being water.</p>
<p>That is whether or not you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>water being present in cells in its liquid form</p>
<p>or maybe in this fourth structure water form</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re of the mind that that exists within us</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;re talking about water</p>
<p>that was used to create a given protein</p>
<p>like a receptor or a neurotransmitter</p>
<p>or whether or not you&rsquo;re talking about the water</p>
<p>just being water as H2O, okay?</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s very easy to go down that rabbit hole</p>
<p>and this is part of the reason</p>
<p>why there&rsquo;s such a wide discrepancy of assertions</p>
<p>as to how much of us is water, but let&rsquo;s be direct.</p>
<p>Most of our body is water and there isn&rsquo;t a single</p>
<p>other molecule in the universe that we can look to</p>
<p>and say that it has as important a role</p>
<p>in our health and biology and frankly,</p>
<p>our presence of life on earth at all than water.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens now called AG1</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day is that it gets me</p>
<p>the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important, it&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal</p>
<p>and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number</p>
<p>of adaptogens, vitamins and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>

<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Okay, so now at a minimum, everyone out there</p>
<p>should understand that water has a particular structure.</p>
<p>So when you hear H2O, you can kind of imagine that structure</p>
<p>and that the water molecules can change their conformation.</p>
<p>That is, they can bind to other water molecules</p>
<p>and it turns out they can bind to other things</p>
<p>and actually change the conformation of other things.</p>
<p>A good example of that is something we&rsquo;re all familiar with,</p>
<p>which is water&rsquo;s ability to dissolve certain substances</p>
<p>like sugar or salt.</p>
<p>And that is because salt molecules or sugar molecules</p>
<p>are what we call hydrophilic, they like water.</p>
<p>And when we say they like water,</p>
<p>it just means that the chemical structure of salt, sodium</p>
<p>or the chemical structure of say sucrose, like table sugar,</p>
<p>can actually interact with the hydrogens and oxygens</p>
<p>of water and can change those salt molecules</p>
<p>or sugar molecules, turning them from solid into liquid,</p>
<p>essentially creating what are called solutes,</p>
<p>which is basically the dissolving of solids</p>
<p>into a liquid solutions.</p>
<p>In fact, water is one of the best solvents on the planet.</p>
<p>In fact, water is better at dissolving many solids</p>
<p>than is acid, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how incredible water is.</p>
<p>And there are a number of reasons</p>
<p>related to the chemistry of water that can explain that.</p>
<p>But as we transition from talking about the physics</p>
<p>and chemistry of water to how water actually behaves</p>
<p>within our body and contributes to our health</p>
<p>or to disease, depending on the case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to understand that molecules</p>
<p>such as sugar and salt can be hydrophilic</p>
<p>or as we know, oil and water don&rsquo;t mix.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because oil&rsquo;s lipids are so-called hydrophobic.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s hydrophobic?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just think, ah, phobic.</p>
<p>Certain molecules such as lipids</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t dissolve well in water.</p>
<p>And we all intuitively understand that.</p>
<p>If you take some olive oil, for instance,</p>
<p>and you put it into a little glass of water,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll likely float or beat up or form a little spherical</p>
<p>or amoeba-like shapes within the water.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because oil lipids are hydrophobic.</p>
<p>So different substances out there</p>
<p>are either going to be more hydrophilic,</p>
<p>that is, they are going to have a greater propensity</p>
<p>to interact with water and bind with the different aspects</p>
<p>of the water molecules, or hydrophobic,</p>
<p>to have less of a propensity to interact with</p>
<p>and bind with water molecules.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve sort of been alluding to this numerous times</p>
<p>throughout this podcast already,</p>
<p>the temperature of water and the pH,</p>
<p>that is the alkalinity or acidity of water,</p>
<p>will have a strong impact on whether or not</p>
<p>a hydrophilic or hydrophobic substance</p>
<p>will have a greater or lesser tendency</p>
<p>to interact with water.</p>
<p>You all know this intuitively as well.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to dissolve,</p>
<p>say, a big tablespoon of sugar in very cold water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that the grains don&rsquo;t dissolve as quickly</p>
<p>as when you take that big tablespoon of sugar</p>
<p>and put it into a warm or hot cup of water.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because the temperature of water</p>
<p>actually changes how well that sugar molecule</p>
<p>is able to change its conformation</p>
<p>and interact with the water molecules.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you want to get something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really hydrophilic into an aqueous,</p>
<p>that is a water-containing solution,</p>
<p>the temperature is also going to strongly impact that.</p>
<p>Now, there are a near infinite number of examples</p>
<p>of how temperature and pH impact</p>
<p>the tendency of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances</p>
<p>to dissolve in water or not.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to go into all those details,</p>
<p>but as we migrate from our discussion</p>
<p>about the physics and chemistry of water</p>
<p>into how water behaves within our body,</p>
<p>which is what we&rsquo;re going to do now,</p>
<p>and then as we continue into the third part</p>
<p>of our discussion, which is why and how</p>
<p>certain types of water that some of you are familiar with,</p>
<p>like different pH water, distilled water,</p>
<p>reverse osmosis water,</p>
<p>why those different types of water are thought to,</p>
<p>and in some cases do, in fact,</p>
<p>change the ways that our cells function</p>
<p>for better or for worse,</p>
<p>all of that will come together and make sense for you.</p>
<p>Okay, so all the cells of your body, every cell,</p>
<p>even your bones, that is the osteoblasts</p>
<p>and the other cells within your bones,</p>
<p>your bone marrow, your red blood cells,</p>
<p>your white blood cells, your neurons,</p>
<p>your nerve cells, your liver cells, your kidney cells,</p>
<p>all of them require water.</p>
<p>In order to get the proper amount of water into those cells,</p>
<p>there are basically two ways</p>
<p>that water can access those cells.</p>
<p>Now, if we zoom out for a second and ask ourselves,</p>
<p>how does water actually get into the body?</p>
<p>Most of us just think,</p>
<p>oh, well, we drink that water into our body.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s the main way.</p>
<p>We can also breathe water molecules</p>
<p>into our body through humid air.</p>
<p>When you hydrate your cells,</p>
<p>that is when you&rsquo;re bringing water into your cells,</p>
<p>that water needs to move from your gut</p>
<p>and into the bloodstream</p>
<p>and eventually into the individual cells,</p>
<p>whatever cell type that may be.</p>
<p>And there are basically two ways</p>
<p>that water can access those cells.</p>
<p>The first way has been known about for a very long time,</p>
<p>and that is so-called diffusion.</p>
<p>Now, the outside of most cells</p>
<p>is made up of fatty stuff, lipid.</p>
<p>So for instance, neurons, nerve cells</p>
<p>have a lipid bilayer, it&rsquo;s two layers of fat.</p>
<p>And you already know that fat, lipid, is very hydrophobic.</p>
<p>Now, that turns out to be not a problem,</p>
<p>but a solution for how water can get</p>
<p>across that lipid barrier.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It is the fact that water can change its conformation</p>
<p>and lipids can change their conformation just enough</p>
<p>so that the bonds between water</p>
<p>and the bonds between those hydrophobic lipids can interact,</p>
<p>allowing the water molecule</p>
<p>to basically pass through the lipid</p>
<p>because it can bond very weakly,</p>
<p>or in some cases, not at all,</p>
<p>but very weakly to those lipids,</p>
<p>and then be pushed through to the other side.</p>
<p>Really incredible if you think about it.</p>
<p>If there was too much of a hydrophobic relationship</p>
<p>between the lipid and the water,</p>
<p>the water would come up to the surface</p>
<p>of that fatty outside of our cells,</p>
<p>and then would be repelled away from it,</p>
<p>or would just stay there right at the surface.</p>
<p>And that would be no good</p>
<p>because we actually need that water</p>
<p>to diffuse across the cell membranes,</p>
<p>or actually it&rsquo;s a double cell membrane,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, two layers.</p>
<p>So water and lipids of cells can interact</p>
<p>with just enough affinity</p>
<p>that the water molecule can diffuse</p>
<p>across those cell membrane barriers.</p>
<p>But, and this is an important but,</p>
<p>the diffusion of water molecules</p>
<p>across those lipid barriers on the outsides of cells</p>
<p>is a fairly slow process</p>
<p>compared to the other way that water accesses cells.</p>
<p>And this other way that water accesses cells</p>
<p>is really something that was just discovered</p>
<p>about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So this is a fairly recent discovery,</p>
<p>but it turns out to be a fundamental discovery,</p>
<p>which is the presence of what are called aquaporin channels.</p>
<p>Aquaporin channels are basically portals</p>
<p>through the membrane that allow water molecules</p>
<p>to move very quickly across cell membranes</p>
<p>at a rate of about 1,000,000 H2Os,</p>
<p>1,000,000 water molecules per second.</p>
<p>And the way that water molecules move across</p>
<p>the cell membrane through those aquaporin channels</p>
<p>is very interesting.</p>
<p>The inside of those channels,</p>
<p>and the way I think of these is they&rsquo;re literally tubes</p>
<p>stuck through the membranes of cells.</p>
<p>The insides of those channels are very hydrophobic,</p>
<p>allowing those water molecules to just jut really quickly,</p>
<p>almost as if in your mind,</p>
<p>you can just imagine as if it was lubricated for the water,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s not really lubricated.</p>
<p>The water molecules can move through in single file,</p>
<p>a million per second.</p>
<p>Now, why would you need two ways</p>
<p>for water to get across cell membranes?</p>
<p>One fairly slow through basic diffusion.</p>
<p>And again, diffusion, folks,</p>
<p>is the movement of things from a gradient</p>
<p>of higher concentration to lower concentration.</p>
<p>We just think about this as things tend to run downhill</p>
<p>from higher concentration to lower concentration.</p>
<p>They try and create equilibrium across space.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you had a bunch of marbles</p>
<p>on one side of a box,</p>
<p>just imagine that these were water molecules.</p>
<p>Because of the charges between those hydrogens and oxygens,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tendency for those marbles to spread out</p>
<p>and essentially take on a fairly even conformation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically just diffusion across a space.</p>
<p>Water molecules will also move from higher concentration</p>
<p>to lower concentration across cell membranes.</p>
<p>And then you have these portals,</p>
<p>these tubes or these channels, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>these aquaporin channels</p>
<p>where water molecules can move very quickly.</p>
<p>Now, the reason why biology seems to have created</p>
<p>these aquaporin channels,</p>
<p>and again, I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase,</p>
<p>but the most logical explanation</p>
<p>is that we have many tissues within our body</p>
<p>that often need water very quickly</p>
<p>or need to release water very quickly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about a couple of these,</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s look at what the actual distribution</p>
<p>of aquaporin channels is throughout the body.</p>
<p>What is an area of your body that on occasion</p>
<p>will need to move water very quickly out of it?</p>
<p>You can use your imagination here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just tell you that, for instance,</p>
<p>your tear glands or tear ducts</p>
<p>need to release tears very quickly.</p>
<p>So you need to take water that&rsquo;s stored in your body,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s an emotional experience,</p>
<p>or if you look at a very bright light, for instance,</p>
<p>or God forbid, if you get some sort of irritant in your eye,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to start to tear up.</p>
<p>And those tears are the release of fluid</p>
<p>from those tear ducts.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s going to be the very rapid release</p>
<p>of water from those tear ducts</p>
<p>through so-called aquaporin channels.</p>
<p>And in fact, aquaporin channels are heavily expressed.</p>
<p>There are many of them in the cells</p>
<p>of the so-called lacrimal glands that release tears.</p>
<p>In addition, we need to absorb water from the gut.</p>
<p>And the gut has a lining, endothelial lining,</p>
<p>and other cell linings, mucosal lining,</p>
<p>and water needs often to move very quickly</p>
<p>from our stomach into the rest of the body.</p>
<p>And one way that is accomplished</p>
<p>is through aquaporin channels</p>
<p>that are expressed all along your gut.</p>
<p>So the discovery of these aquaporin channels</p>
<p>is really highly significant</p>
<p>in terms of understanding the different ways</p>
<p>that water can interact with</p>
<p>and get into the cells of your body.</p>
<p>Now, there are aquaporin channels,</p>
<p>not just in the lacrimal glands that allow for tearing</p>
<p>or within the gut, but in many tissues within your body.</p>
<p>And they even have different distributions</p>
<p>within those tissues.</p>
<p>In fact, as one looks at the expression</p>
<p>of the different aquaporin channels,</p>
<p>because it turns out there are different forms of them,</p>
<p>across all the cells and tissues of the body,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really no single tissue within the body</p>
<p>except perhaps the bones of your body,</p>
<p>and perhaps the ligaments to some extent</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have these aquaporin channels.</p>
<p>Some of you out there</p>
<p>may have heard of the so-called fascia.</p>
<p>Fascia and sheath muscles</p>
<p>are unique kind of connective tissue</p>
<p>that gives some pliability and yet some rigidity</p>
<p>that allow for a lot of the physical abilities</p>
<p>of your musculoskeletal system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible tissue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do an entire episode about fascia at some point.</p>
<p>Fascinating, fascinating tissue.</p>
<p>Fascia even contain aquaporin channels.</p>
<p>So the role of aquaporin channels in fascia</p>
<p>probably relates to our specific needs</p>
<p>to be able to use specific muscle groups</p>
<p>in particular ways at particular times.</p>
<p>In other words, if you&rsquo;re sleeping or lying down or sitting,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not using your musculoskeletal system</p>
<p>as much as if you&rsquo;re running</p>
<p>or performing some repetitive behavior.</p>
<p>It turns out that the aquaporin channels</p>
<p>in certain tissues like the fascia can be used</p>
<p>when we transition from low mobility states</p>
<p>to high mobility states,</p>
<p>allowing more perfusion or access of water</p>
<p>into particular cells of the body when we need it.</p>
<p>So just fascinating, fascinating channels,</p>
<p>these aquaporin channels.</p>
<p>And again, only discovered fairly recently.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re still learning new things</p>
<p>about our biology all the time.</p>
<p>Now, a very important feature of the aquaporin channel</p>
<p>is that the movement of water molecules</p>
<p>across the cell membrane through those aquaporin channels</p>
<p>is strongly dependent on the temperature of water</p>
<p>and the pH of water.</p>
<p>This becomes especially important in our description</p>
<p>and our deep dive into so-called alkaline water</p>
<p>or higher pH water a little bit later.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll just give you a little teaser for now</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sure that a number of people</p>
<p>are wondering about this.</p>
<p>If you go into the store or even a convenience store,</p>
<p>you will see pH water.</p>
<p>Now, every water has a pH, right?</p>
<p>Lower numbers mean more acidic,</p>
<p>higher numbers mean more alkaline or more basic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see pH water that is 7.4, you&rsquo;ll see 7.8,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see 9.8, you&rsquo;ll see a huge range of these things.</p>
<p>And there are many, many different claims</p>
<p>about how the pH of water is important</p>
<p>for regulating the pH of the body.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the real story.</p>
<p>The pH of your body, that is the pH of the cells</p>
<p>at different locations in your body</p>
<p>is strongly, strongly homeostatically regulated.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>It means it doesn&rsquo;t change that much,</p>
<p>which means that you have very specific</p>
<p>biological mechanisms that ensure the pH is maintained,</p>
<p>for instance, in the skin cells of your skin,</p>
<p>in the retinal cells of your eye, in your brain cells.</p>
<p>Now, it is true that across the body,</p>
<p>different cells and tissues have fairly widely varying pH.</p>
<p>Now, it has been said that the pH of bodily tissues</p>
<p>is generally between 7.2 and 7.4.</p>
<p>However, if you were to look at the pH of your gut,</p>
<p>and keep in mind that your gut is not just your stomach,</p>
<p>your gut is the entire pathway</p>
<p>ranging from your throat all the way down</p>
<p>to where you excrete things out of your body.</p>
<p>That entire pathway has different pH levels</p>
<p>depending on where you are</p>
<p>along the gut and intestinal pathway.</p>
<p>And in fact, having much lower,</p>
<p>that is more acidic pH at certain locations</p>
<p>along your gut pathway is what allows those gut microbiota,</p>
<p>those little microorganisms of which you have trillions</p>
<p>that are important for regulating everything</p>
<p>from neurotransmitter production to hormone production</p>
<p>that allow them to flourish and do well.</p>
<p>That said, except under conditions of hemorrhage</p>
<p>or changes in blood volume that are of a dangerous level</p>
<p>that can lead to seizure or even death,</p>
<p>the pH of the rest of the cells of your body</p>
<p>and also those gut cells doesn&rsquo;t change that much</p>
<p>on a moment to moment basis.</p>
<p>So if somebody tells you</p>
<p>that you should drink alkaline water or alkalized water</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s sometimes called,</p>
<p>in order to keep your body more alkaline and less acidic,</p>
<p>there is essentially no basis for that</p>
<p>at a macroscopic level or even at a local level.</p>
<p>Now, what that does not mean</p>
<p>is that the pH of the water that you drink is not important.</p>
<p>In fact, if the pH of the water that you drink is too low,</p>
<p>that is if the water that you consume is too acidic,</p>
<p>it will not move as quickly from your gut</p>
<p>into the other regions of your body</p>
<p>and therefore the other cells of your body</p>
<p>that require that water</p>
<p>will not be able to access it as readily.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably experienced this</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve consumed certain water</p>
<p>and it feels like it&rsquo;s sloshing around in your stomach</p>
<p>or it feels like it&rsquo;s just somehow staying there</p>
<p>or you feel its presence more, not just as volume,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost as if you can feel the little waves of water</p>
<p>along the inside of your gut.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes that can relate to temperature,</p>
<p>but oftentimes that can relate to the pH of that water.</p>
<p>And it turns out it is true that water</p>
<p>that is more alkaline, that is pHs of 7.4 or higher</p>
<p>can move more readily across the aquaporin channel.</p>
<p>And in terms of absorption of water</p>
<p>from the endothelial lining</p>
<p>and the other cell type lining of your gut</p>
<p>into the rest of your body,</p>
<p>it is true that higher pH water,</p>
<p>provided that pH isn&rsquo;t too high,</p>
<p>is going to be absorbed more quickly,</p>
<p>which partially explains why some people have an affinity</p>
<p>for this higher pH water.</p>
<p>Now, this is not to say that you need to consume</p>
<p>high pH water in order to hydrate your body properly.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear about that.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested</p>
<p>in what the value of elevated pH water is,</p>
<p>it largely has to do with this accelerated absorption.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll talk about a little bit later,</p>
<p>there is also growing evidence</p>
<p>that it can adjust the function of certain cells</p>
<p>that are within your immune system</p>
<p>and thereby reduce certain inflammatory responses.</p>
<p>So I realize as I&rsquo;m saying this,</p>
<p>some people out there are probably thinking,</p>
<p>oh no, this guy&rsquo;s like a pH water proponent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s saying we have to drink alkaline water</p>
<p>or buy very fancy water.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be clear, that is not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also not saying that you need</p>
<p>to purchase very expensive water</p>
<p>in order to derive the maximum benefits</p>
<p>from the water that you drink.</p>
<p>It turns out there are a few things that you can do</p>
<p>by way of temperature and by way of filtering water</p>
<p>and a few other tricks that I&rsquo;ll tell you a little bit later</p>
<p>that will allow you to increase the absorption rate</p>
<p>of water in the gut,</p>
<p>which turns out to be a very interesting</p>
<p>but also potentially important thing to do</p>
<p>for not just reducing inflammation,</p>
<p>but also making sure that you&rsquo;re getting proper hydration</p>
<p>of different cell types in your body,</p>
<p>including rapid hydration of your brain cells,</p>
<p>which as we&rsquo;ll also talk about in a few moments</p>
<p>can greatly enhance cognitive function.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve talked about how water can get into cells.</p>
<p>There are two ways, diffusion and movement</p>
<p>through these aquaporin channels.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve earmarked the discussion that the temperature</p>
<p>and the pH of water, that is the confirmation of water.</p>
<p>And here, I really want to embed this in people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>that when we talk about temperature of water</p>
<p>and pH of water,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re really talking about the arrangement of those H2Os,</p>
<p>those water molecules.</p>
<p>So keep that in mind.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered how water can get into cells</p>
<p>through those two different ways,</p>
<p>diffusion and through the aquaporin channels.</p>
<p>What we haven&rsquo;t talked about</p>
<p>is what happens to water once it&rsquo;s in cells.</p>
<p>And this is very simple to explain.</p>
<p>Once water is inside of cells,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be incorporated</p>
<p>into the different proteins and organelles.</p>
<p>Again, organelles are things like mitochondria,</p>
<p>the nucleus of the cells,</p>
<p>which contains the DNA and so forth,</p>
<p>in different ways, depending on which proteins are there</p>
<p>and how hydrophilic or hydrophobic those proteins are,</p>
<p>or in some case, aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an entire landscape</p>
<p>of protein to water specific interactions,</p>
<p>none of which we need to go into in any specific detail now.</p>
<p>But the one thing that we do need to realize</p>
<p>and keep in mind as we go forward</p>
<p>is that many of the biological processes in our body</p>
<p>that involve the movement of molecules,</p>
<p>such as water and interactions with proteins</p>
<p>are going to involve the bonding or lack of bonding</p>
<p>between water molecules and proteins.</p>
<p>And anytime we&rsquo;re talking about bonding</p>
<p>of one thing to the next at the level of chemistry</p>
<p>or biology for that matter,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re really the same thing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about whether or not there are electrons</p>
<p>present or whether or not there are charges</p>
<p>that are opposite or the same and on and on.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever heard of so-called reactive oxygen species,</p>
<p>what are ROSs or reactive oxygen species,</p>
<p>or so-called free radicals or antioxidants,</p>
<p>all of that is really just describing</p>
<p>the presence or absence of charges</p>
<p>that are bound or unbound.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you hear about free radicals,</p>
<p>sounds pretty wild, right?</p>
<p>Free radicals, what are free radicals?</p>
<p>Free radicals can damage cells.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t always damage cells,</p>
<p>but they can damage cells</p>
<p>because they are essentially free electrons.</p>
<p>They are a charge that&rsquo;s sitting out there,</p>
<p>not bound to anything,</p>
<p>and therefore can interact with the molecular structure</p>
<p>of certain proteins and change those structures</p>
<p>by binding to them or interfering</p>
<p>with the normal binding processes of those proteins</p>
<p>to water or to other things.</p>
<p>And in that way, cause damage to those proteins</p>
<p>and potentially damage to cells.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately, our cells have ways to deal</p>
<p>with those free radicals,</p>
<p>and those are called antioxidants.</p>
<p>Antioxidants are molecules that can arrive in different forms.</p>
<p>Sometimes we think of antioxidants as vitamins,</p>
<p>but they are also present in other things as well,</p>
<p>that essentially bind up those free radicals</p>
<p>or repair the bonds between cells</p>
<p>so that the proteins are no longer undergoing these,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call them bad conformations</p>
<p>that damage the functioning of our cells.</p>
<p>So there are many different theories of aging.</p>
<p>There are many different theories of disease,</p>
<p>but there is not a single disease either of brain or body</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t in some way involve the generation</p>
<p>of what are called reactive oxygen species,</p>
<p>these free radicals and the damaging of cells</p>
<p>at the level of their individual organelles and so forth,</p>
<p>nor is there a single disease of brain or body</p>
<p>that has not been shown to benefit</p>
<p>from having some antioxidant interference</p>
<p>get in the way of that oxidative process.</p>
<p>So I realized today is pretty thick with nomenclature.</p>
<p>For those of you that haven&rsquo;t already realized it,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re learning here is organic chemistry.</p>
<p>So you can feel pretty good about the fact</p>
<p>that if you can understand the water molecule</p>
<p>and understand a little bit about what free electron is,</p>
<p>which is basically a charge that&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>that can potentially do damage,</p>
<p>and the interactions of things like reactive oxygen species</p>
<p>and the ability of stable bonds to buffer against</p>
<p>or repair certain damage to cells</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re describing it here,</p>
<p>well, then what you&rsquo;re essentially thinking about</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re talking about is organic chemistry.</p>
<p>Now, since this is a discussion about chemistry</p>
<p>as a service to try and understand</p>
<p>the biological effects of water,</p>
<p>keep in mind that water itself, believe it or not,</p>
<p>can act as an antioxidant</p>
<p>provided that it&rsquo;s bonding to things in the proper way,</p>
<p>which requires that it get into cells</p>
<p>in the proper amounts and rates,</p>
<p>which requires that the temperature and pH of that water</p>
<p>be correct and provided that there&rsquo;s enough water there</p>
<p>and that that water isn&rsquo;t bound to other things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not containing solutes that are damaging</p>
<p>and potentially that it&rsquo;s carrying some of the good things</p>
<p>such as sodium or that there&rsquo;s potassium present.</p>
<p>Again, the so-called electrolytes</p>
<p>that allow cells to function well.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s a bit of a trench of information</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want people to get overwhelmed or confused.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to do here is paint a picture</p>
<p>of the biology of water,</p>
<p>understanding that when you ingest water,</p>
<p>drinking it down or when you breathe water vapors</p>
<p>in the steam room or on a humid day,</p>
<p>that water is entering your system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s accessing your cells through these two mechanisms,</p>
<p>diffusion across cell membranes</p>
<p>or movement through aquaporin channels,</p>
<p>and then once inside those cells,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s able to interact with and change the conformation</p>
<p>of different proteins and accelerate or slow down</p>
<p>different cellular reactions,</p>
<p>everything from normal metabolism to blood pressure</p>
<p>to damaged cells, depending on a number</p>
<p>of different features of that water,</p>
<p>as well as what the cells happen to be doing</p>
<p>at any given moment.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I&rsquo;d like to turn our attention</p>
<p>to how water, depending on its temperature, its pH,</p>
<p>how much we drink or how little we drink,</p>
<p>when we drink that water, et cetera,</p>
<p>how that can impact the health, disease,</p>
<p>and repair of different cells, tissues,</p>
<p>and organs of our body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just take a brief moment</p>
<p>and thank one of our podcast sponsors,</p>
<p>which is InsideTracker.</p>
<p>InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform</p>
<p>that analyzes data from your blood and DNA</p>
<p>to help you better understand your body</p>
<p>and help you reach your health goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a believer in getting regular blood work done</p>
<p>for the simple reason that blood work is the only way</p>
<p>that you can monitor the markers such as hormone markers,</p>
<p>lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,</p>
<p>that impact your immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>One major challenge with blood work, however,</p>
<p>is that most of the time, it does not come back</p>
<p>with any information about what to do</p>
<p>in order to move the values for hormones, metabolic factors,</p>
<p>lipids, et cetera, into the ranges that you want.</p>
<p>With InsideTracker, changing those values</p>
<p>becomes very straightforward</p>
<p>because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use</p>
<p>to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,</p>
<p>supplement-based approaches that you can use</p>
<p>in order to move those values into the ranges</p>
<p>that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.</p>
<p>InsideTracker now includes a measurement</p>
<p>of apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB, in their ultimate plan.</p>
<p>ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>and therefore, there&rsquo;s extreme value</p>
<p>to knowing your ApoB levels.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how much water, or more generally speaking,</p>
<p>how much fluid each and all of us should drink each day,</p>
<p>and how much fluid to drink</p>
<p>depending on our specific activities and environment.</p>
<p>Now, this is perhaps the most commonly asked question</p>
<p>when the topic of water comes up.</p>
<p>How much water do I need to drink?</p>
<p>The other thing that comes up is a question,</p>
<p>which is, can&rsquo;t we just follow our natural thirst?</p>
<p>That is, can&rsquo;t we just pay attention to when we&rsquo;re thirsty</p>
<p>and then drink fluids?</p>
<p>And then that leads to the other question,</p>
<p>which is, does the color of our urine provide any indication</p>
<p>as to whether or not we are under-hydrated, over-hydrated,</p>
<p>or hydrating correctly?</p>
<p>So let me answer each of these things one at a time.</p>
<p>And in the backdrop, I want to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that there are many, many, if not dozens,</p>
<p>hundreds of studies pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that when we are dehydrated,</p>
<p>our brain doesn&rsquo;t function as well,</p>
<p>and our body doesn&rsquo;t function as well.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m attempting to do in that statement</p>
<p>is throw a net around the enormous number of studies</p>
<p>that have shown that even a slight state of dehydration,</p>
<p>even 2% dehydration,</p>
<p>can lead to a significant and meaningful impact,</p>
<p>that is, a negative impact on our ability to, for instance,</p>
<p>carry out endurance-type behaviors.</p>
<p>So our ability to run on a treadmill</p>
<p>and stop at the point where we feel like we can&rsquo;t continue</p>
<p>is going to be negatively impacted.</p>
<p>That is, we will be able to perform less work</p>
<p>for less period of time</p>
<p>when we are even slightly dehydrated.</p>
<p>Likewise, our strength is reduced</p>
<p>by even slight dehydration.</p>
<p>Likewise, our cognitive performance,</p>
<p>including memory, focus, creative thinking,</p>
<p>flexible thinking of different kinds,</p>
<p>are all significantly impaired</p>
<p>when we are in states of dehydration.</p>
<p>Now, that raises an additional question</p>
<p>that deserves attention,</p>
<p>which is how do we actually measure dehydration?</p>
<p>Now, you hear different things.</p>
<p>Like if you pinch the skin on the top of your hand</p>
<p>and it takes more than three seconds</p>
<p>to lay down again flat, then you&rsquo;re dehydrated.</p>
<p>You hear that.</p>
<p>You hear, okay, if you are to press on your fingernail</p>
<p>and see a change in the color of the tissue</p>
<p>just below your fingernail, which indeed does happen,</p>
<p>and it does not go back to its original color</p>
<p>within one to three seconds, then you&rsquo;re dehydrated.</p>
<p>You hear things like this.</p>
<p>If your ankles are swollen when you&rsquo;re wearing socks,</p>
<p>you take off the socks</p>
<p>and you can see the imprint of the socks</p>
<p>on your lower limbs, that means you&rsquo;re dehydrated.</p>
<p>You hear this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>and you should probably be wondering, is any of that true?</p>
<p>To some extent, it is true,</p>
<p>although it can vary quite a bit by how old you are,</p>
<p>whether or not the skin on the top of your hand</p>
<p>tends to be looser or not,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re leaner or not.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>those are not absolutely objective measures of dehydration.</p>
<p>Now, it is true that if normally</p>
<p>you can pinch the skin on the top of your hand</p>
<p>and it returns to its normal flattened position</p>
<p>within about one to two or three seconds,</p>
<p>and it does not do that within five or more seconds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a decent probability</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a little bit dehydrated,</p>
<p>that you need to ingest some fluid,</p>
<p>or that if you press down on your nail</p>
<p>and you see the depression causes a transition</p>
<p>from kind of a pink color to a white color,</p>
<p>and then you release,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t go back to its original pinkish color</p>
<p>within a few seconds,</p>
<p>well, then there&rsquo;s a chance that you&rsquo;re dehydrated.</p>
<p>But again, these are not perfect measures</p>
<p>of dehydration.</p>
<p>You may be surprised to learn,</p>
<p>and I was surprised to learn</p>
<p>that most of the basis for these statements,</p>
<p>like even a 2% dehydration state</p>
<p>can lead to significant reductions</p>
<p>in cognitive or physical performance</p>
<p>are based on not direct measures of hydration,</p>
<p>but rather on measures of reductions in water intake,</p>
<p>which is a different thing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s saying that ordinarily,</p>
<p>a person of a given body weight</p>
<p>needs X amount of fluid per day,</p>
<p>and when they get even just 2% less</p>
<p>than that amount of fluid,</p>
<p>then their cognitive and or physical performance is impaired</p>
<p>rather than focusing on dehydration of tissues, right?</p>
<p>Now, that might seem like a subtle distinction,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually a meaningful distinction</p>
<p>when you think about it.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s a meaningful distinction</p>
<p>that we can leverage toward understanding</p>
<p>how much water or fluid we need to drink each day.</p>
<p>Now, there, we can really point to some solid numbers</p>
<p>that, believe it or not,</p>
<p>are fairly independent of body weight.</p>
<p>Now, I say independent of body weight,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the amount of fluid</p>
<p>that most healthy adults need at rest.</p>
<p>What do I mean by at rest?</p>
<p>I mean, when not exercising</p>
<p>and when not in extremely hot environments.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m leaving aside you desert ultramarathoners</p>
<p>or people that are doing any kind of movement</p>
<p>or living in environments that are very, very hot.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m mainly referring to people</p>
<p>that live most of their daily life in indoor environments.</p>
<p>Could be air conditioned or not air conditioned,</p>
<p>heated or not heated.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re trying to arrive at here</p>
<p>are some numbers that can work across the board</p>
<p>because, of course, there are an infinite number</p>
<p>of different conditions</p>
<p>that each and all of you are existing in.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not going to attempt to give you a body weight</p>
<p>by activity, by environment, by humidity formula calculation.</p>
<p>In fact, no such calculation exists.</p>
<p>However, there are formulas</p>
<p>that can put you into very stable frameworks.</p>
<p>That is levels of water intake for periods of rest</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not exercising</p>
<p>and for when you are exercising</p>
<p>that will ensure that you are hydrating</p>
<p>with the one exception being if you are exercising</p>
<p>or if you are living in very, very hot conditions</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not heat adapted to those conditions.</p>
<p>So what are those numbers?</p>
<p>In other words, what is the answer to the question</p>
<p>of how much fluid do we need each day?</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m referring to fluid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not distinguishing between water,</p>
<p>caffeinated beverages, soda, tea, and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll discuss that in a moment.</p>
<p>We can reasonably say that for every hour</p>
<p>that you are awake in the first 10 hours of your day,</p>
<p>this is important, in the first 10 hours of your day,</p>
<p>you should consume on average eight ounces of fluid.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that are using the metric system,</p>
<p>not ounces, eight ounces of fluid</p>
<p>is approximately 236 milliliters of water.</p>
<p>And for those of you that exist in the metric system</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t used to thinking about ounces and vice versa,</p>
<p>just think about a typical can of soda</p>
<p>in the United States is 12 ounces.</p>
<p>In Europe, sometimes the cans of soda</p>
<p>are a little bit smaller.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole discussion unto itself,</p>
<p>but eight ounces of fluid, that is 236,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say 240 milliliters,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t need to be too precise here,</p>
<p>of fluid on average every hour</p>
<p>for the first 10 hours of your day,</p>
<p>which translates to an average of 80 ounces of fluid</p>
<p>for the first 10 hours of your day,</p>
<p>or 2,360 milliliters of water.</p>
<p>In other words, approximately two liters of water</p>
<p>plus a little bit more for the first 10 hours of your day.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be very clear that this does not mean</p>
<p>that you need to ingest eight ounces</p>
<p>or 236 milliliters of fluid on the hour,</p>
<p>every hour for the first 10 hours of your day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not saying that.</p>
<p>And in fact, most people are going to find</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to ingest water in boluses.</p>
<p>That is, they&rsquo;re going to have perhaps 16 ounces of water,</p>
<p>500 milliliters of water at one portion of the day,</p>
<p>and then maybe a couple hours of later</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll drink some more water or some more coffee or soda</p>
<p>or some other beverage at another portion of the day.</p>
<p>I do think, however, it&rsquo;s important for most of us</p>
<p>to take a step back and ask ourselves</p>
<p>whether or not independent of any other activity</p>
<p>or environmental conditions,</p>
<p>whether or not we are in fact ingesting 80 ounces</p>
<p>or basically 2.4 liters of water</p>
<p>for that 10 hours of the day</p>
<p>that spans from the time we wake up</p>
<p>until 10 hours later.</p>
<p>Now, why am I setting this 10-hour framework?</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m setting this 10-hour framework</p>
<p>is that it turns out that your fluid requirements,</p>
<p>even just at rest, are vastly different</p>
<p>in the time from when you wake up</p>
<p>until about 10 hours later</p>
<p>as compared to the later evening and nighttime.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m referring to people</p>
<p>that are not doing night shifts.</p>
<p>But if you are requesting a number</p>
<p>of how much fluid to drink,</p>
<p>independent of our needs for fluid for exercise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be eight ounces of fluid</p>
<p>or 240 milliliters of fluid on average for every hour</p>
<p>from the time we wake up until 10 hours later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the simple formulation</p>
<p>that should basically ensure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting sufficient baseline hydration</p>
<p>for the cells and tissues of your body.</p>
<p>Now, if you are engaging in exercise,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s endurance exercise</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s resistance training exercise,</p>
<p>you are going to need additional fluids</p>
<p>in order to maximize the effects of that exercise</p>
<p>and to avoid dehydration.</p>
<p>And there too, we have some excellent numbers</p>
<p>that we can look to,</p>
<p>excellent because they arrive from research.</p>
<p>And this is largely peeled from the episode</p>
<p>that I did with Dr. Andy Galpin,</p>
<p>professor of kinesiology at Cal State Fullerton.</p>
<p>We did a six-episode series all about exercise,</p>
<p>everything from strength training, hypertrophy, endurance,</p>
<p>nutrition, supplementation, recovery,</p>
<p>everything related to exercise.</p>
<p>You can find all of that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>And one of the components of those episodes</p>
<p>that was discussed,</p>
<p>but that some of you may have not heard,</p>
<p>is that there is a simple formula</p>
<p>for how much fluid to ingest on average.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is on average when you&rsquo;re exercising.</p>
<p>And I refer to this as the so-called Galpin equation.</p>
<p>The Galpin equation states</p>
<p>that you should take your body weight in pounds,</p>
<p>divide that by 30,</p>
<p>and that will give you the number of ounces of fluid</p>
<p>to ingest every 15 to 20 minutes on average</p>
<p>while exercising, okay?</p>
<p>Your body weight in pounds divided by 30</p>
<p>equals the number of ounces of fluid to consume</p>
<p>on average every 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>When I say on average, what I mean is</p>
<p>it is not the case that you need to stop</p>
<p>every 15 or 20 minutes and consume that volume of fluid.</p>
<p>You could sip it from moment to moment.</p>
<p>You could wait half an hour or an hour</p>
<p>and then consume a larger bolus of fluid,</p>
<p>a larger amount.</p>
<p>Although it is recommended for performance sake</p>
<p>that you sip or consume beverages</p>
<p>fairly consistently throughout your training.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s ability to do that is going to depend</p>
<p>on a number of things like gastric emptying time,</p>
<p>whether or not the particular exercise you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s running or jumping</p>
<p>is compatible with ingesting fluid on a regular basis</p>
<p>or whether or not you need to do it at different intervals</p>
<p>than every 15, 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s every five minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s every half hour.</p>
<p>You have to adjust for you.</p>
<p>But if you were to take the hour of exercise</p>
<p>or the half hour of exercise or the three hours of exercise</p>
<p>and ask how much fluid to ingest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be that Galpin equation</p>
<p>of body weight in pounds divided by 30</p>
<p>equals the number of ounces for every 15 or 20 minutes.</p>
<p>And of course I can already hear screaming from the back,</p>
<p>what about for those of us who follow the metric system?</p>
<p>And there there&rsquo;s a simple translation</p>
<p>of the Galpin equation,</p>
<p>which is that you need approximately</p>
<p>two milliliters of water per kilogram of body weight</p>
<p>every 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Again, the Galpin equation converted into the metric system</p>
<p>is going to be two milliliters of water</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight</p>
<p>every 15 to 20 minutes on average.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a number of you are asking</p>
<p>whether or not hydration prior to exercise</p>
<p>is also important.</p>
<p>It absolutely is.</p>
<p>And if you follow the numbers that I talked about before,</p>
<p>approximately eight ounces or 240 milliliters</p>
<p>of fluid intake per hour in the first 10 hours of waking,</p>
<p>that should establish a good baseline</p>
<p>of hydration heading into exercise,</p>
<p>which then prompts the next question I often get,</p>
<p>which is, is the amount of water that needs to be consumed</p>
<p>according to the Galpin equation during exercise</p>
<p>on top of or separate from,</p>
<p>that is, does it replace the amount of fluid</p>
<p>that one needs at a basic level,</p>
<p>that eight ounces or 240 milliliters?</p>
<p>And there, the answer sort of goes both ways.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re going to exercise,</p>
<p>then obviously follow the Galpin equation in some way.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t need to be ultra specific about this.</p>
<p>These are ballpark figures that will ensure hydration.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve set them a little bit higher</p>
<p>perhaps than needed to ensure more hydration</p>
<p>rather than less.</p>
<p>But basically the short answer is</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re exercising for about an hour,</p>
<p>most people are exercising for an hour or two,</p>
<p>probably not more than that.</p>
<p>Most of my workouts are,</p>
<p>and certainly the resistance training workouts</p>
<p>last about an hour.</p>
<p>Well, then you can replace the eight ounces</p>
<p>or the 240 milliliters of water</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required at baseline with what you consume</p>
<p>according to the Galpin equation</p>
<p>during that bout of exercise.</p>
<p>A common question is if you are exercising</p>
<p>in a heated environment, indoor or outdoor,</p>
<p>or you are somebody who tends to sweat a lot.</p>
<p>And by the way, we can all get better at sweating</p>
<p>by sweating more.</p>
<p>Sweat is an adaptation.</p>
<p>So if you sit in the sauna more,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get better at sweating.</p>
<p>If you exercise more,</p>
<p>especially if you wear more layers</p>
<p>or if you do it in hotter temperatures</p>
<p>or more humid temperatures,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get better at sweating over time.</p>
<p>And sweating is an adaptation that helps cool your body.</p>
<p>If you are sweating a lot or you&rsquo;re in heat,</p>
<p>how much fluid should you ingest?</p>
<p>In general, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say</p>
<p>that you may want to increase the values</p>
<p>on the Galpin equation by about 50 to 100%.</p>
<p>So either increased by 50% or double those numbers</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a very hot environment</p>
<p>or sweating an awful lot.</p>
<p>If you are sitting in the sauna,</p>
<p>I highly recommend consuming at least eight ounces</p>
<p>and probably more like 16 ounces of fluid.</p>
<p>So that translates again to about 240 or about 480.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just round up 500 milliliters of fluid</p>
<p>for every 20 to 30 minutes that you are in a hot sauna.</p>
<p>And then of course people ask, well, how hot?</p>
<p>And it, okay, that starts getting really detailed</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t distinguish between dry saunas and wet saunas.</p>
<p>And again, too many variables,</p>
<p>but I would double your fluid intake</p>
<p>for that hot environment exercise</p>
<p>or for that hot environment sauna sit.</p>
<p>Also, if you are feeling dehydrated, okay,</p>
<p>what does feeling dehydrated mean?</p>
<p>That actually has a definition</p>
<p>that we can get into a little bit later,</p>
<p>but what we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is if you are feeling as if your throat is dry,</p>
<p>you are quote unquote parched or you&rsquo;re very thirsty.</p>
<p>Well, then there&rsquo;s absolutely no problem</p>
<p>with ingesting more fluids, 16 ounces of fluid</p>
<p>or 500 milliliters of fluid per hour</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re feeling parched.</p>
<p>My read of the literature is that thirst</p>
<p>is a reasonable guide for when we tend to be dehydrated.</p>
<p>However, it is the case that our thirst</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really keep up with our body&rsquo;s level of dehydration.</p>
<p>And we know that based on some really nice studies</p>
<p>that have explored the amount of fluid intake</p>
<p>compared to the amount of urination,</p>
<p>compared to the amount of physical output,</p>
<p>compared to the environment that one happens to be in.</p>
<p>These are sort of older studies in the realm of physiology,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the basic rule of thumb</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to work for most people.</p>
<p>If you are feeling parched, consume fluids.</p>
<p>Ideally, you consume fluids that don&rsquo;t contain caffeine</p>
<p>or other diuretics, diuretics being substances</p>
<p>that cause the release,</p>
<p>the urination of fluid from the body.</p>
<p>And, or if you are consuming caffeine either prior to</p>
<p>or after bouts of exercise, or even just at work,</p>
<p>or you work in a air conditioned</p>
<p>or otherwise dry, cool, or hot environment</p>
<p>that you try and include some sodium.</p>
<p>And ideally sodium, potassium, magnesium,</p>
<p>the electrolytes in that beverage.</p>
<p>So it could be a little pinch of sea salt</p>
<p>with some lemon to adjust the taste a little bit.</p>
<p>It could be an electrolyte drink of element</p>
<p>or some other sort.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different types out there.</p>
<p>For most people drinking pure water.</p>
<p>And I realized that many people do just like the taste</p>
<p>of pure water.</p>
<p>Chances are you&rsquo;re going to have enough electrolytes</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re sweating quite a bit</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re exercising quite a lot.</p>
<p>And under conditions where you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>very few carbohydrates,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to excrete more fluid.</p>
<p>If you are ingesting caffeine,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s from tea or coffee,</p>
<p>I highly recommend increasing your non-caffeine fluid intake</p>
<p>about two to one for every volume of caffeine.</p>
<p>So in other words, if you have a six ounces</p>
<p>or eight ounces of coffee,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want 12 to 16 ounces of fluid,</p>
<p>ideally fluid with electrolytes,</p>
<p>or a little pinch of salt</p>
<p>in order to offset that dehydration.</p>
<p>Hopefully those will provide good rules of thumb</p>
<p>for what people want to do</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re just moving about their day.</p>
<p>Again, underscored by the fact</p>
<p>that even slight levels of dehydration</p>
<p>can really impair our cognitive and physical performance</p>
<p>largely by creating fatigue,</p>
<p>but more often than not by creating brain fog.</p>
<p>You know, I get so many questions about brain fog.</p>
<p>Why do I have brain fog?</p>
<p>Why do I have brain fog?</p>
<p>There is a vast literature showing that quality hydration,</p>
<p>meaning hydration that matches the demands of humidity</p>
<p>and output as described in the equations</p>
<p>that we went over a little bit before</p>
<p>really can enhance clarity of focus and overall energy.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about why that is,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just allude to it a little bit here.</p>
<p>The reason why ingesting sufficient fluids</p>
<p>can enhance our ability to focus</p>
<p>and in fact can reduce brain fog</p>
<p>and can increase physical vigor and output</p>
<p>is not mysterious to us.</p>
<p>We know that there are two mechanisms</p>
<p>by which fluid intake triggers elevated levels of alertness.</p>
<p>And it all has to do with the so-called sympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>which is a real mouthful,</p>
<p>but basically the sympathetic arm</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>as many of you heard me talk about before,</p>
<p>is the aspect of your nervous system</p>
<p>that makes you more alert.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with emotional sympathy.</p>
<p>It has to do with a bunch of neurons</p>
<p>in the middle of your spinal cord</p>
<p>called the sympathetic chain ganglia</p>
<p>and some other related neural networks in your body,</p>
<p>as well as regions of your brain,</p>
<p>like the locus coeruleus that release things</p>
<p>like epinephrine and norepinephrine and make you more alert.</p>
<p>And in a kind of magnificent arrangement,</p>
<p>or I think magnificent arrangement,</p>
<p>when we have fluid in our gut</p>
<p>and when our cells are well hydrated,</p>
<p>and believe it or not,</p>
<p>when our bladder contains fluid within it,</p>
<p>there is an elevation in activity</p>
<p>of the sympathetic nervous system by way of two pathways.</p>
<p>One is mechanical.</p>
<p>In fact, we have so-called stretch receptors</p>
<p>in our bladder and in our gut.</p>
<p>These stretch receptors have fancy names</p>
<p>like TRP, trip channels, as they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>or piezo, which are these stretch sensing channels.</p>
<p>This is the beautiful work of many laboratories,</p>
<p>but in particular, David Julius and Ardem Petapuchin.</p>
<p>David Julius is at UC San Francisco.</p>
<p>Ardem is at the Scripps Institute.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve discovered a bunch of channels in cells</p>
<p>that sends things from cold</p>
<p>to different mechanical pressure,</p>
<p>including expansion of tissues, so-called mechanosensation.</p>
<p>And basically what it all boils down to</p>
<p>is that when our bladder has some fluid in it,</p>
<p>when our stomach has some fluid in it,</p>
<p>and when our cells are sufficiently hydrated,</p>
<p>they send information about the mechanical presence</p>
<p>of that distention.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m not talking about being overly full</p>
<p>or full chock-a-block full of fluid</p>
<p>or your bladder feeling really, really full.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that in a moment.</p>
<p>But when we are sufficiently hydrated,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a mechanical signature of that,</p>
<p>which is the expansion of our tissues</p>
<p>because it has more fluid in it.</p>
<p>And there are chemical signals as well,</p>
<p>which is the movement of water</p>
<p>across those aquaporin channels is actually understood.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a biological level by our cells</p>
<p>and sends information to the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with so-called sympathetic arousal</p>
<p>and makes us more alert.</p>
<p>This is actually what wakes us up</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>If we have consumed too much fluid prior to sleep</p>
<p>and we need to urinate, we wake up.</p>
<p>This is a mechanism that is not adequately developed</p>
<p>in babies and young children.</p>
<p>This is why babies, young children often will wet their bed.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, in both humans and in dogs,</p>
<p>our ability to control urination voluntarily</p>
<p>is something that we actually learn.</p>
<p>Babies just pee in their diaper.</p>
<p>Dogs just pee on the floor until they&rsquo;re housebroken</p>
<p>or until a child learns to hold on to their urine</p>
<p>until they go to the bathroom,</p>
<p>in a bathroom or particularly appropriate location,</p>
<p>outdoors or otherwise.</p>
<p>The point is that hydration of the body</p>
<p>is signaled to the brain.</p>
<p>When we have enough fluid in the tissues of our body,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve consumed enough fluid,</p>
<p>even if it hasn&rsquo;t already arrived to the cells</p>
<p>and tissues of our body,</p>
<p>that is signaled to the brain in the form of alertness.</p>
<p>And that alertness is what translates</p>
<p>to the enhanced cognitive abilities that we have</p>
<p>when we are well hydrated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also what translates to our enhanced physical abilities</p>
<p>when we are challenged with physical tasks.</p>
<p>So when you look out on the landscape of all these studies</p>
<p>that have shown impairments in physical</p>
<p>or cognitive performance</p>
<p>under conditions of even slight dehydration,</p>
<p>that all makes sense because our cells need fluid</p>
<p>and we need water,</p>
<p>but it also prompts the question of,</p>
<p>well, does being well hydrated</p>
<p>actually make our brain and body function better</p>
<p>in the context of physical and cognitive performance?</p>
<p>And indeed the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Now, earlier we were talking about these equations</p>
<p>that you can apply.</p>
<p>And again, I really want to emphasize</p>
<p>that these equations were not meant to be followed</p>
<p>down to the decimal point.</p>
<p>They were really meant and are meant as crude</p>
<p>but sufficient guides for you to make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting enough hydration</p>
<p>depending on your levels of activity and at rest.</p>
<p>If you recall, when we talked about those equations,</p>
<p>I said you need about eight ounces</p>
<p>or 240 milliliters of fluid per hour</p>
<p>for the first 10 hours of your day after waking.</p>
<p>Now, why did I say for the first 10 hours?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that the filtration of fluids</p>
<p>from your body, which is accomplished of course</p>
<p>by your kidneys and by way of your bladder</p>
<p>and the excretion of fluid out urethra,</p>
<p>so-called urination,</p>
<p>is strongly, strongly circadian dependent,</p>
<p>meaning the cells of your kidney</p>
<p>and the cells even of your gut.</p>
<p>In fact, all the cells of your body,</p>
<p>but especially the cells of your kidney</p>
<p>which filter the fluid that comes into your body</p>
<p>and that makes certain hormones like vasopressin,</p>
<p>which is antidiuretic hormone,</p>
<p>all of that functioning of the kidney</p>
<p>is under strong regulation</p>
<p>by so-called circadian clock genes.</p>
<p>Circadian clock genes are genes</p>
<p>that are expressed in every cell,</p>
<p>but that in certain cells of the body</p>
<p>very strongly impact whether or not that organ,</p>
<p>in this case the kidney,</p>
<p>is going to be activated, meaning functioning,</p>
<p>at a very high level or at a reduced level.</p>
<p>And we can make all of this very simple</p>
<p>by simply stating what&rsquo;s contained</p>
<p>in this beautiful review that I&rsquo;ll provide a link to</p>
<p>if you want to learn more</p>
<p>called Circadian Rhythms in the Kidney.</p>
<p>And basically what is known</p>
<p>is that for the first 10 hours after waking,</p>
<p>your kidney is filtering fluid within your body</p>
<p>at a very rapid rate.</p>
<p>There are a number of different cell types that do that,</p>
<p>but they are basically taking that fluid,</p>
<p>pulling out any contaminants,</p>
<p>using hormones such as antidiuretic hormone,</p>
<p>vasopressin to adjust whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to hold on to fluid</p>
<p>or release more fluid from your body in the form of urine,</p>
<p>depending on the salt concentration,</p>
<p>depending on how much fluid you need,</p>
<p>your work output, the conditions you&rsquo;re in, all of that.</p>
<p>However, at about 10 hours after waking,</p>
<p>your kidney really starts to reduce</p>
<p>its overall level of functioning.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that your kidney</p>
<p>cannot filter fluid 11 or 12 or 16 hours after waking,</p>
<p>but it becomes far less efficient at doing so.</p>
<p>And thank goodness it does</p>
<p>because you do not want your kidney filtering fluid</p>
<p>at the same rate at midnight,</p>
<p>assuming you wake up at say seven or eight or 9 a.m.,</p>
<p>that it was filtering fluid at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>In fact, we can say that if you want to reduce</p>
<p>your nighttime waking in order to urinate,</p>
<p>which is a common, common question and concern</p>
<p>that many people have,</p>
<p>how can I avoid waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to urinate, and there I say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s perfectly normal to wake up once,</p>
<p>maybe twice each night to urinate.</p>
<p>But if you want to reduce the number of times</p>
<p>that you wake up in order to urinate across the night,</p>
<p>maybe even make that number zero times,</p>
<p>you will greatly benefit by doing three things.</p>
<p>First of all, make sure that you&rsquo;re hydrating sufficiently</p>
<p>during the daytime per the equations</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>That will ensure that you are not excessively thirsty</p>
<p>in the evening and therefore consuming a lot more fluid.</p>
<p>Second, and related to that first point,</p>
<p>is that you do want to reduce your fluid intake at night,</p>
<p>provided you hydrated sufficiently throughout the day.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>the rate at which fluid moves from your gut</p>
<p>and into the cells and tissues of your body,</p>
<p>and then from your bladder into urine,</p>
<p>is determined not just by the volume of fluid you ingest,</p>
<p>but also the rate at which you ingest that fluid.</p>
<p>And you might be thinking, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>That makes no sense at all, right?</p>
<p>If I drink a ton of fluid slowly,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it still mean that I&rsquo;m going to urinate a ton?</p>
<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>It also stands to reason that you might ask,</p>
<p>if I ingest very little fluid, but I do it very fast,</p>
<p>is it going to be the case</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to urinate it out very quickly?</p>
<p>Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>The point is that the fluid filtration systems of your body</p>
<p>that range from the gut to the bladder,</p>
<p>and include the kidney of course,</p>
<p>depend not just on the volume,</p>
<p>but on the rate of fluid that you ingest.</p>
<p>Because of those mechanosensors</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>if you gulp down a bunch of fluids,</p>
<p>you are going to excrete those fluids more quickly</p>
<p>than if you sip them slowly.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sip them slowly.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what I recommend.</p>
<p>Throughout the day when you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to get your adequate yield of water or other beverages,</p>
<p>feel free to gulp that fluid or sip it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a gulper, not a sipper,</p>
<p>but many of you are going to be sippers, not gulpers.</p>
<p>Consume fluid at the rate that feels right to you,</p>
<p>but feel comfortable gulping that fluid.</p>
<p>However, in the evening,</p>
<p>if you are somebody who has challenges</p>
<p>with waking up excessively in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>reduce your fluid intake,</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;ve hydrated properly throughout the day.</p>
<p>And I suggest consuming no more than five,</p>
<p>maybe eight ounces of fluid</p>
<p>between the time of 10 hours after waking</p>
<p>and when you go to sleep.</p>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re very thirsty or you under hydrate</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s very hot, feel free to ingest more fluid, please.</p>
<p>But most people will find</p>
<p>that if they reduce their fluid intake</p>
<p>to about five ounces or less of fluid</p>
<p>in that later part of the day,</p>
<p>after 10 hours of having woken up and before sleep,</p>
<p>and they sip those beverages as opposed to gulping them,</p>
<p>that they will have fewer bouts</p>
<p>of waking up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>to go to the restroom and ideally zero.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about tap water.</p>
<p>And here I have to take a deep breath,</p>
<p>not a deep gulp, but a deep breath,</p>
<p>because in researching tap water</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s contained in tap water in different regions,</p>
<p>not just in the US, but around the world,</p>
<p>I confess the picture is a pretty scary one.</p>
<p>I want to be clear, I&rsquo;m not somebody</p>
<p>who naturally orients towards fear or conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>However, in researching tap water for this episode,</p>
<p>by way of looking at the peer-reviewed research,</p>
<p>meta-analyses, reviews, specific research articles</p>
<p>where specific hypotheses were tested,</p>
<p>and in talking with experts in toxicology and so on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty grim picture, frankly,</p>
<p>when one looks at what&rsquo;s contained in most tap water</p>
<p>and whether or not the compounds</p>
<p>that are contained in tap water</p>
<p>are present in sufficient concentrations</p>
<p>to negatively impact our health.</p>
<p>And the bad news is that much, if not all tap water,</p>
<p>believe it or not, much, if not all tap water</p>
<p>contains things that are bad for the biology of our cells.</p>
<p>There is a silver lining, however,</p>
<p>and the silver lining is that very simple steps</p>
<p>that are very inexpensive can be used</p>
<p>to adjust that tap water to make it not just safe to drink,</p>
<p>but that makes it perfectly fine to drink.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the good news, and we&rsquo;ll get to that in a moment.</p>
<p>If you are somebody who is interested</p>
<p>in whether or not tap water contains things</p>
<p>like endocrine disruptors, hormone disruptors</p>
<p>that can negatively impact reproductive health</p>
<p>in males or females or both,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a wonderful review,</p>
<p>wonderful because it&rsquo;s so thorough,</p>
<p>although the news isn&rsquo;t great,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very thorough, which is great,</p>
<p>which is entitled</p>
<p>Endocrine Disruptors in Water</p>
<p>and Their Effects on the Reproductive System.</p>
<p>This is a review from 2020 that analyzes water</p>
<p>from a bunch of different sources within the world</p>
<p>and essentially focuses on a few key components.</p>
<p>First of all, it focuses on the concentration of minerals,</p>
<p>that is magnesium and calcium within water.</p>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t realize this, but so-called hard water,</p>
<p>sounds terrible, right?</p>
<p>But hard water is water that contains magnesium and calcium,</p>
<p>which turns out to be a good thing.</p>
<p>Some water contains more magnesium and calcium,</p>
<p>other water contains less.</p>
<p>They looked at the presence of magnesium and calcium</p>
<p>because that is going to impact the pH of water.</p>
<p>In general, the higher concentrations of magnesium</p>
<p>and calcium in water, the higher the pH,</p>
<p>that is the more alkaline that water is</p>
<p>and the lower levels of magnesium and calcium,</p>
<p>the more acidic or lower pH that water tends to be.</p>
<p>The other thing that this review addresses</p>
<p>is the concentration of so-called DBPs,</p>
<p>dog, bulldog, porcupines, DBPs,</p>
<p>which are disinfection byproducts contained in water.</p>
<p>So obviously local governments, the government,</p>
<p>wants your drinking water to be clean.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want contaminants in it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want sewage in that water.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want chemical contaminants</p>
<p>that are going to make people immediately sick.</p>
<p>So they treat water, water treatment plants,</p>
<p>treat water with disinfection products</p>
<p>and those disinfection products</p>
<p>create things called disinfection byproducts.</p>
<p>And the presence of those DBPs</p>
<p>or disinfectant byproducts can strongly impact</p>
<p>the pH of water by way of changing the concentrations</p>
<p>of magnesium and calcium.</p>
<p>Put differently, I do believe that governments</p>
<p>are trying to provide people with clean water,</p>
<p>but in doing so, oftentimes we&rsquo;ll introduce things</p>
<p>to that water that are not good for us.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s very clear that DBPs can cause endocrine disruption</p>
<p>in ways that are not good for reproductive health.</p>
<p>I did a very long, in fact, four and a half hour episode</p>
<p>on fertility and vitality.</p>
<p>That was male and female fertility, by the way,</p>
<p>and vitality that again, you can find it hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>that talks about all the biological processes</p>
<p>involved in the generation of healthy eggs and sperm</p>
<p>and creating a healthy embryos,</p>
<p>implantation embryos and so forth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that DBPs have been shown</p>
<p>to disrupt ovarian function,</p>
<p>spermatogenesis and fertility outcomes.</p>
<p>Even at concentrations of DBPs</p>
<p>that are present in drinking water</p>
<p>that comes from the tap.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean that you shouldn&rsquo;t drink tap water?</p>
<p>Well, the answer to that is a, it depends.</p>
<p>What does it depend on?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on several things.</p>
<p>First of all, I highly recommend that everybody go online</p>
<p>and put in your zip code and ask for a water analysis</p>
<p>of water that comes out of the tap in that zip code.</p>
<p>This is something that is readily available online,</p>
<p>at least to my knowledge, and unfortunately,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no specific one site that I can send everyone to</p>
<p>to get an in-depth analysis of the drinking water</p>
<p>that comes out of your tap.</p>
<p>However, I highly recommend that you go online</p>
<p>and put in your zip code or municipal area code</p>
<p>and figure out whether or not your water contains</p>
<p>X amount of DBPs or Y amount of DBPs.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you&rsquo;re going to get a bunch of values back</p>
<p>and unless you&rsquo;re a toxicologist,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not going to know what those values mean.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re really looking for</p>
<p>is whether or not there are high, low,</p>
<p>or moderate levels of fluoride in that drinking water.</p>
<p>Why do I say that?</p>
<p>Well, there are studies that show that the concentration</p>
<p>of fluoride in drinking water is of particular concern</p>
<p>for the thyroid hormone system of the body.</p>
<p>Now, thyroid hormone has a lot of different roles</p>
<p>in brain and body, and thyroid hormone is very important</p>
<p>for everything from metabolism to levels of energy</p>
<p>when thyroid levels are disrupted</p>
<p>or if the thyroid receptors are disrupted,</p>
<p>it can lead to depression.</p>
<p>When thyroid hormones are optimized,</p>
<p>it can lead to optimal mood if there is such a thing.</p>
<p>But in other words, it helps keep your mood elevated.</p>
<p>It relates to everything from sleep to reproduction.</p>
<p>Thyroid hormone is involved in many, many things,</p>
<p>including bone health and tissue health generally.</p>
<p>So essentially every biological process in your body</p>
<p>is impacted by thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a study that I&rsquo;d like to highlight,</p>
<p>which was published in 2018.</p>
<p>And the title of the study is</p>
<p>Impact of Drinking Water Fluoride</p>
<p>on Human Thyroid Hormones.</p>
<p>This was a case control study,</p>
<p>so this is not an extensive analysis of many individuals.</p>
<p>However, what it shows is that fluoride</p>
<p>negatively impacts thyroid stimulating hormone</p>
<p>and so-called T3 levels.</p>
<p>So you have thyroid hormone T3 and T4,</p>
<p>even in the standard concentrations that are present of,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s an important number, 0.5 milligrams per liter.</p>
<p>Okay, so if you can get ahold</p>
<p>of the fluoride concentrations in your tap water</p>
<p>and find out whether or not the concentrations</p>
<p>are at, below, or exceed 0.5 milligrams per liter,</p>
<p>what you will find is that even just 0.5 milligrams</p>
<p>per liter of water can disrupt thyroid function.</p>
<p>And this is going to be a particular concern</p>
<p>for people to have familial,</p>
<p>so genetically related thyroid issues,</p>
<p>or that are concerned with keeping</p>
<p>your thyroid hormone levels healthy,</p>
<p>which I think is everybody.</p>
<p>So I am telling you that you should try</p>
<p>and get ahold of some data about the water</p>
<p>that comes out of your tap,</p>
<p>if you intend on drinking tap water,</p>
<p>and probably even if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>just know what&rsquo;s in your drinking water.</p>
<p>Your local government should provide that information</p>
<p>and or it should be readily available online.</p>
<p>And in particular, I think it&rsquo;s worthwhile</p>
<p>to address how much fluoride is present</p>
<p>in your drinking water.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t want to create a lot of scare.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to trigger fear here.</p>
<p>I do think, however, by way of reading this review,</p>
<p>by way of reading the paper</p>
<p>that I just referred to a moment ago,</p>
<p>again, links to these are going to be provided</p>
<p>in the show note captions,</p>
<p>that there is extensive evidence</p>
<p>that elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water</p>
<p>are simply not good for us.</p>
<p>Now that could open a whole discussion</p>
<p>of why fluoride is in our drinking water</p>
<p>in the first place at all.</p>
<p>But leaving that aside,</p>
<p>it seems to me that most everybody should know</p>
<p>how much fluoride is in their drinking water.</p>
<p>And ideally, everybody, yes, everybody</p>
<p>is filtering their drinking water.</p>
<p>Now, that raises the question</p>
<p>of how best to filter drinking water.</p>
<p>And that brings an answer of,</p>
<p>it depends on a couple of things.</p>
<p>First of all, how healthy or unhealthy</p>
<p>do you know yourself to be?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who has no health issues,</p>
<p>you have plenty of vigor, you&rsquo;re sleeping well at night,</p>
<p>you have no autoimmune disease,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not aware of any health concern, minor or major,</p>
<p>well then perhaps you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t want to filter your water.</p>
<p>I would argue that why wouldn&rsquo;t you employ</p>
<p>some very low or even zero cost approach</p>
<p>to filtering your water?</p>
<p>There are going to be other individuals</p>
<p>who are suffering particular ailments of brain or body,</p>
<p>or both, that absolutely should be filtering</p>
<p>their drinking water if they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>their drinking water from their tap</p>
<p>because it is pretty well established now</p>
<p>that tap water contains a lot</p>
<p>of these disinfectant byproducts,</p>
<p>as well as in most cases,</p>
<p>exceeding the threshold of fluoride</p>
<p>that we know to be healthy for us.</p>
<p>How should you filter your tap water?</p>
<p>Well, you have everything ranging</p>
<p>from the so-called Brita type filters,</p>
<p>so these are going to be carbon type filters</p>
<p>or other filters that you essentially put</p>
<p>over a container or a compartment</p>
<p>where you can pour the water over it</p>
<p>and it goes into the compartment below.</p>
<p>Will those work?</p>
<p>Are they sufficient to filter out</p>
<p>the disinfectant byproducts?</p>
<p>The general answer is yes,</p>
<p>provided you change the filters often enough.</p>
<p>However, it is not thought, unfortunately,</p>
<p>not thought that they filter out sufficient fluoride.</p>
<p>So what I highly recommend is,</p>
<p>depending on your budget,</p>
<p>that you go online and you search</p>
<p>for at-home water filters that can filter out fluoride.</p>
<p>There are a number of straightforward</p>
<p>and inexpensive tools to do that.</p>
<p>And here, I don&rsquo;t have any relationship</p>
<p>to any of the water filters</p>
<p>or things that I&rsquo;m going to mention now.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no brand code or affiliation here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply trying to direct you to resources</p>
<p>that will allow you to filter your tap water</p>
<p>for it to be more safe for you to consume</p>
<p>in a way that meets your budget</p>
<p>with the understanding that people have</p>
<p>very different disposable incomes.</p>
<p>So the range of costs here is going to be pretty tremendous.</p>
<p>I just want to get that out of the way first.</p>
<p>You know, there are water filters</p>
<p>that you can use repeatedly.</p>
<p>So these are what I&rsquo;ll refer to as pitcher filters</p>
<p>that are less than $100.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that that&rsquo;s a one-time purchase</p>
<p>except for the replacement of the filters,</p>
<p>which fortunately doesn&rsquo;t have to be done too often.</p>
<p>So there are different filters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to one that I found</p>
<p>that is at least by my read of the lowest possible cost.</p>
<p>So this is the so-called clearly filtered water pitcher</p>
<p>with affinity filtration.</p>
<p>So this is a filter that can adequately remove fluoride,</p>
<p>lead, BPAs, glyphosates, hormones,</p>
<p>and some of the other harmful things</p>
<p>that are contained in most tap water.</p>
<p>Again, I do realize that for some people,</p>
<p>even an 80 US dollar cost is going to be prohibitive,</p>
<p>but do realize that what you&rsquo;re doing here</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re purchasing a unit</p>
<p>that can be used repeatedly over and over.</p>
<p>The reason why it&rsquo;s lower cost</p>
<p>than some of the different filtration approaches</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment</p>
<p>are that you can&rsquo;t really put all the drinking water</p>
<p>that you would use, say, for an entire week</p>
<p>or for an entire month in one pitcher.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to repeatedly pour water</p>
<p>into the pitcher in order to filter it.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>the range on water filter costs</p>
<p>for filters that can adequately remove fluoride</p>
<p>and all the other things that you want</p>
<p>out of your tap water is immense.</p>
<p>In fact, you can find whole house water filters</p>
<p>that are $2,000 or more.</p>
<p>Again, these are going to be filters</p>
<p>that are going to be in your garage</p>
<p>or in a laundry room that are going to basically pull</p>
<p>from the piping system of your house</p>
<p>and deliver purified water.</p>
<p>Technically, it&rsquo;s not purified,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s removing these contaminants and fluoride</p>
<p>from all the sinks in your house.</p>
<p>So you could effectively drink</p>
<p>from any or all things in your house.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what explains the higher cost.</p>
<p>I think most people are probably not going</p>
<p>to have the disposable income</p>
<p>or have the opportunity to include</p>
<p>one of these whole house filters.</p>
<p>Although if you do have the means</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important to you, you could do that.</p>
<p>And then there are going to be</p>
<p>what I would call intermediate systems.</p>
<p>So systems that cost somewhere between 200 and $500.</p>
<p>Probably one of the more common ones</p>
<p>or popular ones is a so-called Berkey filter system.</p>
<p>These are filter systems that again,</p>
<p>remove the things that you want removed from your tap water,</p>
<p>and they can do it at higher volumes.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re typically countertop units.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t require any plugin typically,</p>
<p>or they only require brief plugin and electricity.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to filter out many, many liters</p>
<p>or tens of liters of water</p>
<p>so that you can always have access</p>
<p>to that clean filtered water at any time of day or night</p>
<p>without having to pour over into the pitcher.</p>
<p>So I mentioned these different options,</p>
<p>because again, I realized that people</p>
<p>have different levels of disposable income.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there&rsquo;s no tablet or simple mechanism</p>
<p>that can be purchased as a transportable pill</p>
<p>that you can just simply throw in water</p>
<p>and remove the contaminants.</p>
<p>If anyone is aware of one that can adequately remove fluoride</p>
<p>and other contaminants,</p>
<p>please put in the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be the best place</p>
<p>so that I and everyone else can see it.</p>
<p>But hopefully the mention</p>
<p>of the different filtration systems that I mentioned</p>
<p>will give you some choices that I would hope would fall</p>
<p>within the range that one could potentially afford.</p>
<p>An important note about filtration.</p>
<p>Just as in our body,</p>
<p>there are mechanisms to signal mechanical changes</p>
<p>and chemical changes that occur in our gut, in our brain,</p>
<p>et cetera, elsewhere.</p>
<p>And in general, both mechanical and chemical changes</p>
<p>are signaled across the body to invoke different changes,</p>
<p>whether or not those are a response of the immune system</p>
<p>or to make us more alert or more asleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>So too, filtration capitalizes</p>
<p>on mechanical and chemical filtration.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is when you run a fluid,</p>
<p>water or any other fluid through a filter,</p>
<p>those filters are doing two things.</p>
<p>They are physically constraining</p>
<p>which molecules can go through by creating portals, pores</p>
<p>that allow certain size molecules to go through</p>
<p>and not others.</p>
<p>And almost always they contain certain chemicals themselves.</p>
<p>Those filters have been treated with certain chemicals</p>
<p>that neutralize certain other chemicals.</p>
<p>So you may be wondering how, when you filter water,</p>
<p>magnesium and calcium could get through, but fluoride doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because these filters</p>
<p>have been very cleverly designed</p>
<p>in order to neutralize fluoride</p>
<p>or to prevent large molecules such as sediment and dirt,</p>
<p>which is kind of easy to imagine being filtered,</p>
<p>but also to allow certain small molecules like calcium,</p>
<p>which is small-ish or magnesium, which is small-ish</p>
<p>to still pass through into our drinking water.</p>
<p>And this is wonderful because what it means is that</p>
<p>by filtering our water using any of the methods</p>
<p>that we talked about before,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still going to get whatever magnesium and calcium</p>
<p>is present in that water</p>
<p>while still adequately removing the fluoride</p>
<p>and other disinfectant byproducts.</p>
<p>Now, what if you can&rsquo;t afford any of those options?</p>
<p>Okay, well, here you have an interesting zero cost option.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as good as the other ones of filtering that water,</p>
<p>but it is an option.</p>
<p>And I do think it&rsquo;s important to give options to people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t have any disposable income</p>
<p>for the purpose of filtering their water,</p>
<p>which is to draw a gallon or five gallons</p>
<p>or maybe even more tap water out of the tap</p>
<p>and put it into some container, some vessel.</p>
<p>So it could be one gallon, five gallon, 10 gallon container.</p>
<p>And then to let that tap water sit for some period of time</p>
<p>to allow some of the sediment to drop to the bottom.</p>
<p>Now you might say, well, there&rsquo;s no sediment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing contained in that tap water</p>
<p>and isn&rsquo;t fluoride diluted in the water?</p>
<p>And indeed the answer to that is yes.</p>
<p>However, there is some evidence that letting tap water</p>
<p>sit out at room temperature and outside the pipes</p>
<p>that deliver that water can help remove some,</p>
<p>if not all of the contaminants in that water.</p>
<p>If however, you are filtering the water</p>
<p>using any of the methods that I talked about</p>
<p>a few moments ago, you do not need to do this, okay?</p>
<p>I realize there&rsquo;s a whole world out there</p>
<p>of people who insist on putting their water in the sun</p>
<p>or only keeping it in certain containers</p>
<p>and putting it out for a few days before they ingest it.</p>
<p>That to me seems a bit extreme.</p>
<p>If you want to do that, be my guest,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think most people need to do that.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that for people</p>
<p>who have zero disposable income to devote</p>
<p>to paying for any kind of filtration system</p>
<p>for their tap water, that taking that tap water</p>
<p>and putting into some container at room temperature</p>
<p>and keeping it at room temperature</p>
<p>for a half day or a day or more,</p>
<p>and then pouring off the top two thirds of that water</p>
<p>into another container and consuming the water</p>
<p>from that second container is going to remove some,</p>
<p>not all of the contaminants</p>
<p>that one would need to be concerned about.</p>
<p>And here I should mention something</p>
<p>that I neglected to mention a few moments ago.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to do this zero cost option</p>
<p>and let the water sit out for a bit,</p>
<p>you would want that water to sit uncapped.</p>
<p>Sorry, I should have mentioned that before, uncapped.</p>
<p>Of course, trying to keep things</p>
<p>from falling into that water.</p>
<p>In fact, you could even put a little bit of cloth above it.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want things falling into that water,</p>
<p>but you want certain things to be able to evaporate off.</p>
<p>And you also want some of the sediment to drop down.</p>
<p>And the reason why this process of letting water sit out</p>
<p>would work at all is because many of the contaminants</p>
<p>contained within water are not present</p>
<p>because of the source of that water</p>
<p>or even the treatment of that water,</p>
<p>but rather because of the pipes that that water arrives</p>
<p>to your glass or the pot that you have from.</p>
<p>Okay, and here again,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an infinite number of variables.</p>
<p>So some people are living in buildings</p>
<p>for which the pipes are very, very old,</p>
<p>but very, very clean, believe it or not.</p>
<p>Some people are living in newer buildings and structures</p>
<p>that have new pipes,</p>
<p>but for which the seals between those pipes</p>
<p>contain things that are not good for you to consume.</p>
<p>So by letting water sit out for a while,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to remove some of the contaminants</p>
<p>present within the pipes of your home and the building,</p>
<p>and even the pipes that lead to your home or apartment.</p>
<p>Now, some people get really obsessed</p>
<p>with this whole tap water thing</p>
<p>and really want to find out all the details about the pipes</p>
<p>and what sorts of hard metals and how much magnesium</p>
<p>and how much calcium are present in their water.</p>
<p>There are ways that you can test your drinking water</p>
<p>for those sorts of things.</p>
<p>Most people I realize, including myself,</p>
<p>are simply not going to do that.</p>
<p>If you want to know what I do,</p>
<p>I tend to drink water that is filtered</p>
<p>through one of these lower cost filters,</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m going to be consuming a lot of fluid,</p>
<p>I will drink certain kinds of fluid that later I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing an experiment for sake of this episode,</p>
<p>looking at so-called molecular hydrogen water,</p>
<p>which sounds very fancy and esoteric</p>
<p>and almost a little wacky,</p>
<p>but it turns out it has largely to do</p>
<p>with the amount of magnesium and calcium</p>
<p>and the pH of that water.</p>
<p>So if you are somebody who has a very low budget</p>
<p>or simply just wants to spend a very small amount of money</p>
<p>and try and still drink tap water,</p>
<p>there is absolutely a way to do that safely,</p>
<p>but it does require a few of these steps.</p>
<p>So on the topic of magnesium and calcium,</p>
<p>this relates, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>to the quote-unquote hardness of water.</p>
<p>So what of the hardness of water?</p>
<p>You know, is it better to have more magnesium and calcium</p>
<p>in your water or less?</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t like the taste of hard water.</p>
<p>They prefer the taste of water</p>
<p>that has less magnesium and calcium.</p>
<p>However, there I would encourage you to take a step back</p>
<p>and consider some of the literature.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll mention a paper in particular</p>
<p>now published in 2019,</p>
<p>which describes the quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Regulations for Calcium, Magnesium,</p>
<p>or Hardness in Drinking Water&rsquo;</p>
<p>in the European Union Member States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turns out in Europe, they do very detailed water analysis,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s present in a number</p>
<p>of really high-quality scientific publications.</p>
<p>This was a paper published</p>
<p>in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology,</p>
<p>and they cite a number of different references</p>
<p>in the introduction that, for instance,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m quoting,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Statistically significant inverse association</p>
<p>between magnesium and cardiovascular mortality.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now again, that&rsquo;s an association.</p>
<p>This is not causal,</p>
<p>but higher magnesium in water,</p>
<p>lower cardiovascular mortality.</p>
<p>They go on to say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The highest exposure category,&rsquo;</p>
<p>which are people consuming drinking water</p>
<p>with magnesium contents of 8.3 to 19.4 milligrams per liter.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, when you get your water analysis,</p>
<p>you can compare against some of these values.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Was significantly associated with decreased likelihood</p>
<p>of cardiovascular mortality by 25%</p>
<p>compared with people consuming magnesium content</p>
<p>of 2.5 to 8.2 milligrams per liter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Okay, so what this basically shows,</p>
<p>and by the way, the reference to that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also provide a link to in the show note caption.</p>
<p>What this basically states</p>
<p>is that higher magnesium-containing water,</p>
<p>and it turns out higher magnesium</p>
<p>and calcium-containing water,</p>
<p>so-called harder water,</p>
<p>may not taste as good to you,</p>
<p>but turns out to be better for you.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not it can prevent you</p>
<p>from getting cardiovascular disease, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>In fact, I would probably just state no,</p>
<p>it probably won&rsquo;t prevent you from cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>You still need to do all the other things</p>
<p>that are important for avoiding cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>and cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<p>For that and what to do</p>
<p>in order to avoid cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to listen to the episode</p>
<p>with Dr. Peter Atiyah that&rsquo;s coming out in a few weeks</p>
<p>that gets deep into that topic</p>
<p>and the actionable items</p>
<p>for avoiding cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>But basically, as this study quotes,</p>
<p>there is a growing consensus among epidemiologists</p>
<p>and epidemiological evidence,</p>
<p>along with clinical and nutritional evidence,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s strong enough to suggest</p>
<p>that new guidance should be issued</p>
<p>in terms of how these different sources of tap water</p>
<p>should enhance, not deplete,</p>
<p>the amount of magnesium and calcium in that water.</p>
<p>Now, this ought to raise a very important question</p>
<p>in all of your minds, which is,</p>
<p>why is it that magnesium and calcium concentrations</p>
<p>are relevant to cardiovascular disease?</p>
<p>Is it something about what magnesium does in cells</p>
<p>or what calcium does in cells?</p>
<p>Are we all magnesium and calcium deficient?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>The major effect by which magnesium and calcium in water</p>
<p>are likely to impact things like blood pressure,</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>and other aspects of cellular function</p>
<p>turn out to be somewhat cryptic,</p>
<p>but we can make that cryptic aspect very clear</p>
<p>by saying that when we have more magnesium in particular,</p>
<p>but also calcium present in our water, so-called hard water,</p>
<p>you increase the amount of hydrogen in that water.</p>
<p>It becomes what we call hydrogen-rich,</p>
<p>and the pH of that water is increased.</p>
<p>Now, again, this does not mean</p>
<p>that we are trying to change the pH of the cells of our body</p>
<p>in any kind of meaningful way.</p>
<p>In fact, we don&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>We want the pH of the cells of our body</p>
<p>to stay in particular ranges, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>but having more magnesium and more calcium in our water,</p>
<p>that is increasing the hardness of our water,</p>
<p>changes the pH of that water,</p>
<p>and it turns out that the elevated pH of water,</p>
<p>that is pH of water that tends to be</p>
<p>somewhere between high sevens,</p>
<p>so we could say 7.9 up to even nine or 9.2,</p>
<p>is going to be more readily absorbed</p>
<p>and is going to more favorably impact</p>
<p>the function of our cells than lower pH water.</p>
<p>Again, I want to restate this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a little bit concerned</p>
<p>that maybe a clip of this is going to be taken</p>
<p>and sent elsewhere,</p>
<p>and someone will get the impression that I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>that we actually want to drink high pH water,</p>
<p>that we all need to buy expensive high pH water.</p>
<p>It turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>If you are consuming tap water from a location</p>
<p>where levels of magnesium are sufficiently high</p>
<p>in that tap water, again,</p>
<p>where the level of magnesium is 8.3 to 19.4 milligrams</p>
<p>per liter of water,</p>
<p>that is if the water coming out of your tap is hard enough,</p>
<p>well then chances are you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to enhance the pH of that water</p>
<p>or change its magnesium concentration.</p>
<p>If however, the water that you&rsquo;re drinking from the tap,</p>
<p>filtered or not, I would hope filtered,</p>
<p>contains less than 8.3 milligrams per liter of magnesium,</p>
<p>well then chances are the pH of that water</p>
<p>is going to be low enough</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not going to be lending itself</p>
<p>to some of the favorable health components</p>
<p>that higher pH water can.</p>
<p>Notice I did not say that lower pH,</p>
<p>aka more acidic water is bad for you.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>I said that higher pH water can be good for you.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about how and why higher pH water</p>
<p>can be good for you,</p>
<p>and some of the best,</p>
<p>and in fact, very inexpensive sources</p>
<p>of higher pH magnesium enhanced,</p>
<p>or simply tap water that contains sufficient magnesium</p>
<p>can be used and accessed.</p>
<p>Many of you are probably wondering whether or not</p>
<p>you can simply boil your tap water</p>
<p>and thereby decontaminate the tap water.</p>
<p>There I want to caution you.</p>
<p>It turns out that some of the contaminants present in water</p>
<p>are actually made worse by heating water.</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t want to open up,</p>
<p>you know, a whole catalog of different fears.</p>
<p>I, like all of you, I presume, use water to cook,</p>
<p>pasta, rice, because I&rsquo;m an omnivore.</p>
<p>I do consume those things.</p>
<p>I confess if I make your beurre mat√©,</p>
<p>or any kind of tea or coffee,</p>
<p>I tend to use a higher quality water source than tap water,</p>
<p>even if that tap water is filtered,</p>
<p>because I like the taste far more</p>
<p>if I use a really good source of water.</p>
<p>And again, because I&rsquo;m not consuming those beverages</p>
<p>in enormous volumes,</p>
<p>that becomes a relatively inexpensive endeavor.</p>
<p>But I would caution people against using boiling</p>
<p>or heating of water as the only method</p>
<p>to decontaminate their tap water,</p>
<p>and instead to also rely on some of the filtration systems</p>
<p>that I talked about before.</p>
<p>And as long as we&rsquo;re talking about the temperature of water,</p>
<p>there is sort of an ongoing debate online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a huge debate,</p>
<p>but a number of people engaged in this debate</p>
<p>as to whether or not drinking really cold water</p>
<p>or room temperature water is better for you</p>
<p>or worse for you.</p>
<p>This is a tough one to resolve.</p>
<p>It turns out that if water is very, very cold,</p>
<p>that is, if you drink it and you can feel that cold water</p>
<p>making its way down to your gut,</p>
<p>and you can actually feel it as cold within your gut,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s sort of a back of the envelope,</p>
<p>or I should say direct within the gut measure</p>
<p>of cold versus body temperature water,</p>
<p>that it is going to be slower to absorb.</p>
<p>That is, you&rsquo;re going to feel it sloshing around</p>
<p>in your stomach for a bit longer</p>
<p>than if you were to consume water that is slightly warmer.</p>
<p>Now, that is not to say that you should ingest warm water</p>
<p>or room temperature water.</p>
<p>However, many people find that when they drink</p>
<p>very cold water or ice water,</p>
<p>that indeed it can alter the kind of sensation</p>
<p>of the lining of their stomach in ways that,</p>
<p>at least to them, feel like it&rsquo;s altering their digestion.</p>
<p>And that makes sense.</p>
<p>The cells that line the gut are very temperature sensitive.</p>
<p>You want this, so for a number of reasons,</p>
<p>including not consuming food that is excessively hot</p>
<p>or cold or damaging your gut.</p>
<p>But in general, most people know the temperature of fluid</p>
<p>that they want to ingest</p>
<p>and ingest that temperature of fluid.</p>
<p>So most people, for instance, on a cold day</p>
<p>want a warm or hot fluid.</p>
<p>Does that mean that you&rsquo;re not going to absorb</p>
<p>that warm or hot fluid?</p>
<p>No, of course it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to absorb that fluid one way or the other.</p>
<p>So drink fluids at the temperatures</p>
<p>that are to your liking in that moment.</p>
<p>In other words, what you desire in that moment.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t worry so much</p>
<p>about trying to avoid cold beverages</p>
<p>or trying to make sure that you&rsquo;re always consuming</p>
<p>room temperature water as opposed to cold water.</p>
<p>So now with your understanding of hard water,</p>
<p>soft water, magnesium,</p>
<p>the relationship between magnesium, calcium,</p>
<p>and the pH of water.</p>
<p>And remember our earlier conversation</p>
<p>where we talked about how higher pH water</p>
<p>is actually going to move out of the gut</p>
<p>and into the body a bit more readily</p>
<p>and across those aquaporin channels more readily</p>
<p>than lower pH, more acidic water.</p>
<p>Well, that raises the question</p>
<p>of whether or not all these different forms of water</p>
<p>that are out there, reverse osmosis water,</p>
<p>distilled water, double distilled water,</p>
<p>deuterium depleted water,</p>
<p>alkaline water, as it&rsquo;s often called,</p>
<p>whether or not any or all of that</p>
<p>has meaningful health outcomes.</p>
<p>Here we can address some of those items pretty quickly.</p>
<p>For instance, distilled water and double distilled water</p>
<p>is essentially distilled of,</p>
<p>that is it has magnesium and calcium removed from it.</p>
<p>So my recommendation would be to not drink distilled water.</p>
<p>There may be specific circumstances</p>
<p>where somebody has very high levels of blood magnesium</p>
<p>or calcium or calcium stores within the body</p>
<p>that would necessitate them drinking only distilled water,</p>
<p>but that seems like a very isolated kind of niche case.</p>
<p>So in general, consuming distilled water</p>
<p>is just simply not necessary.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of reverse osmosis water,</p>
<p>what is reverse osmosis water?</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis water is water</p>
<p>that has been passed repeatedly</p>
<p>through a series of filters</p>
<p>that are designed to remove the kinds of contaminants</p>
<p>we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>So some of the basic contaminants</p>
<p>like disinfectant byproducts, fluoride,</p>
<p>and some other large and small molecules</p>
<p>that leaves the water ideally</p>
<p>still containing magnesium and calcium.</p>
<p>Although there&rsquo;s some evidence that reverse osmosis water</p>
<p>can deprive water of some of the magnesium and calcium.</p>
<p>So if you are going to use reverse osmosis filters</p>
<p>and drink reverse osmosis water,</p>
<p>you want to make sure that you&rsquo;re still getting</p>
<p>the magnesium concentrations present in that water</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>But in general, reverse osmosis water is considered safe,</p>
<p>but, and for many people, this is going to be an important,</p>
<p>but very expensive to access.</p>
<p>The reverse osmosis filters require a lot of changing</p>
<p>of the filters, purchasing reverse osmosis water</p>
<p>in its stable form within containers.</p>
<p>These are typically glass containers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be pretty expensive</p>
<p>and prohibitive for most people.</p>
<p>That said, there are a number of people out there</p>
<p>that really like the taste of reverse osmosis water.</p>
<p>They report it as feeling more smooth.</p>
<p>They think of reverse osmosis water as,</p>
<p>quote unquote, giving them energy.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, there&rsquo;s no direct studies</p>
<p>of the subjective sensation of water in the mouth</p>
<p>and in the gut and its relative health effects.</p>
<p>Again, the smoothness of water as one drinks it</p>
<p>and goes down the gut really has no direct relationship</p>
<p>to the, quote unquote, hardness or softness of water.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s going to shock a number of you.</p>
<p>You probably think, well, hard water</p>
<p>is going to be hard to drink.</p>
<p>And it turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>In fact, many people find that with elevated levels</p>
<p>of magnesium and calcium in water,</p>
<p>it actually tastes smoother or softer in their mouth.</p>
<p>So hard water tastes smooth or soft.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s all very counterintuitive,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s important to point this out</p>
<p>because a number of times you&rsquo;ll hear or read</p>
<p>about filtering water so that it tastes smoother and better.</p>
<p>And oftentimes that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>because the, quote unquote, hardness of water,</p>
<p>that is the concentrations of magnesium</p>
<p>and calcium are actually increasing.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s curious</p>
<p>about reverse osmosis water,</p>
<p>and you can afford the filters</p>
<p>or the reverse osmosis water already pre-filtered,</p>
<p>please be my guest, you know, drink it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not trying to prevent anyone from drinking it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no peer reviewed evidence that I am aware of</p>
<p>that conclusively shows that drinking reverse osmosis water</p>
<p>is far better for us than drinking other types of water,</p>
<p>provided the other types of water</p>
<p>are adequately filtered of fluoride</p>
<p>and the sorts of disinfectant byproducts</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>So what about hydrogen water?</p>
<p>You may have heard of this or hydrogen enriched water</p>
<p>or electrolyzed reduced water</p>
<p>as a way to access hydrogen enriched water.</p>
<p>All this might sound pretty crazy to some of you.</p>
<p>Now, fortunately for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>we can take a number of the different categories of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it unique categories of water</p>
<p>that have been described, including deuterium depleted water.</p>
<p>And by the way, deuterium is something that relates</p>
<p>to the presence of hydrogen ions in water.</p>
<p>And put very simply, water that is extracted from sources</p>
<p>that are closer to sea level</p>
<p>tend to have more deuterium in them</p>
<p>than water that is extracted from sources</p>
<p>further from sea level.</p>
<p>So up in the mountains, for instance,</p>
<p>and from springs further away from oceans.</p>
<p>As you get closer to sea level,</p>
<p>the sources of water separate from seawater</p>
<p>tend to have more deuterium,</p>
<p>which relates to the enrichment</p>
<p>or lack of hydrogen within that water</p>
<p>or free hydrogen within that water.</p>
<p>I warned you, this was all going to sound pretty niche</p>
<p>and that we were going to get a little bit</p>
<p>into the chemistry,</p>
<p>but now I&rsquo;m going to make it all very simple for you,</p>
<p>at least for the non-aficionado.</p>
<p>Electrolyzed reduced water,</p>
<p>which is a method of using electricity</p>
<p>to alter the conformation of the water molecules</p>
<p>and their rates of movement as well,</p>
<p>as well as so-called hydrogen-rich water</p>
<p>or hydrogen-enriched water or deuterium-depleted water,</p>
<p>all have the property of having higher levels of pH</p>
<p>than other forms of water, such as distilled water,</p>
<p>reverse osmosis water, and generally higher pH</p>
<p>than the kind of water that comes out of your tap,</p>
<p>unless you live in a region where your tap water</p>
<p>has very high levels of magnesium in it,</p>
<p>which does occur in certain regions of the world,</p>
<p>but is not that common.</p>
<p>More typically, the water that comes out of your tap</p>
<p>does not have enough magnesium,</p>
<p>meaning not as much magnesium in it as you would like.</p>
<p>And this, I believe, explains</p>
<p>in a fairly straightforward way</p>
<p>why there is such an appeal of these pH-enhanced</p>
<p>or alkaline waters or electrolyzed reduced water</p>
<p>or deuterium-depleted water.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons,</p>
<p>but first of all,</p>
<p>anytime someone is consuming a specialized form of water,</p>
<p>chances are it&rsquo;s going to be filtered</p>
<p>of the disinfectant byproducts, fluoride,</p>
<p>and the other things that you really don&rsquo;t want in water.</p>
<p>So already the water is going to be cleaner</p>
<p>than would be coming out of the tap.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to indirectly explain</p>
<p>a number of the so-called health benefits,</p>
<p>both subjective and perhaps even objective,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ll talk about,</p>
<p>that can result from consuming these other,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say more esoteric forms of water,</p>
<p>at least not of simple tap water.</p>
<p>However, if you look at hydrogen or hydrogen-enriched water,</p>
<p>you really need to take a step back and ask, what is that?</p>
<p>You know, what are we really talking about?</p>
<p>Because it turns out</p>
<p>that you can create hydrogen-enriched water</p>
<p>by putting tablets of magnesium itself,</p>
<p>small amounts of magnesium, dissolving those in water.</p>
<p>It will give off a kind of gaseous solution.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a bunch of bubbling in there.</p>
<p>You certainly want to dilute that tablet</p>
<p>and then consume the water.</p>
<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve heard about and read</p>
<p>from these commercial sources,</p>
<p>you do want to consume that water</p>
<p>within about five to 15 minutes</p>
<p>after that tablet completes dissolving.</p>
<p>Now, why would you do this?</p>
<p>And I should say that I have now started doing this,</p>
<p>not because I necessarily think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s so necessary or so beneficial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about my experience in a moment.</p>
<p>I did it in anticipation of this episode</p>
<p>because I was researching water</p>
<p>and hydrogen-enriched water and all these alkaline waters.</p>
<p>And what became very clear to me</p>
<p>based on reading a fantastic two-part review,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very extensive review entitled,</p>
<p>at least the first part is entitled</p>
<p>Electrolyzed Reduced Water,</p>
<p>Molecular Hydrogen is the Exclusive Agent</p>
<p>Responsible for the Therapeutic Effects.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a second part to this review.</p>
<p>This is how extensive it is,</p>
<p>entitled Electrolyzed Reduced Water.</p>
<p>Number two, Safety Concerns and Effectiveness</p>
<p>as a Source of Hydrogen Water.</p>
<p>What this review,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve linked to in the show notes,</p>
<p>points to is that all of the health benefits</p>
<p>of these different forms of water</p>
<p>that you hear about out there,</p>
<p>deuterium depleted, hydrogen-enriched, et cetera,</p>
<p>all seem to boil down, no pun intended,</p>
<p>no boiling included, I should say,</p>
<p>to the elevation in hydrogen that translates into,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the really meaningful change,</p>
<p>the elevation in pH that occurs</p>
<p>when you hydrogen-enrich water.</p>
<p>Now, there are not a lot of clinical studies</p>
<p>looking at hydrogen-enriched water,</p>
<p>but there are starting to be more than a few.</p>
<p>And one that I&rsquo;d like to point out</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ll link to was published fairly recently,</p>
<p>which is entitled,</p>
<p>Hydrogen-Rich Water Reduces Inflammatory Responses</p>
<p>and Prevents Apoptosis.</p>
<p>Apoptosis is a naturally occurring cell death</p>
<p>during development and is generally used</p>
<p>to describe cell death of the body.</p>
<p>Sometimes this can be good cell death, by the way,</p>
<p>removing cells that need to be removed.</p>
<p>Again, the title of the paper is</p>
<p>Hydrogen-Rich Water Reduces Inflammatory Responses</p>
<p>and Prevents Apoptosis of Peripheral Blood Cells</p>
<p>in Healthy Adults, a Randomized Double Blind Control Trial.</p>
<p>Now, this paper looked at the effects</p>
<p>of drinking 1.5 liters per day of hydrogen-enriched water</p>
<p>for a period of four weeks.</p>
<p>They did find significant positive benefits</p>
<p>of reduced inflammation,</p>
<p>and they found these changes by way of analyzing things</p>
<p>like interleukin-6 and some of the other interleukins,</p>
<p>which are markers of inflammation.</p>
<p>They controlled very nicely for the fact</p>
<p>that people were still consuming other forms of water</p>
<p>and liquid and coffee, et cetera,</p>
<p>although they made sure that they weren&rsquo;t consuming</p>
<p>too much coffee and soda</p>
<p>in addition to this hydrogen-enriched water.</p>
<p>But what this paper shows is that indeed,</p>
<p>increasing the free hydrogen in water</p>
<p>can improve certain health metrics in these cells.</p>
<p>And this is in keeping with some of the subjective reports</p>
<p>that people have stated out there,</p>
<p>and that I myself experienced.</p>
<p>I have to say that by drinking hydrogen-rich water,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll tell you how to do</p>
<p>fairly inexpensively in a moment,</p>
<p>you do get the subjective experience of having more energy,</p>
<p>of feeling better, quote-unquote.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind, of course,</p>
<p>the placebo effect is a very real and powerful effect,</p>
<p>so it could just be placebo.</p>
<p>Although in this paper,</p>
<p>they did, of course, include a placebo group,</p>
<p>so people didn&rsquo;t know if they were getting</p>
<p>hydrogen-rich water or non-hydrogen-rich water.</p>
<p>I should also mention that the improvements</p>
<p>in health metrics that they observed in this study</p>
<p>were only observed for individuals older than 30 years old.</p>
<p>Why that is, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The conclusions these authors came to</p>
<p>in terms of how these individuals older than 30</p>
<p>achieved lower levels,</p>
<p>or I should say reduced levels of inflammation,</p>
<p>and improved markers of other aspects of biological function</p>
<p>is that the hydrogen water</p>
<p>improved the biological antioxidant potential</p>
<p>of certain cell types.</p>
<p>And again, the cell types that they mainly focused on</p>
<p>were these peripheral blood cells in this particular study.</p>
<p>Now, how could this be?</p>
<p>Why would this be?</p>
<p>Well, this goes back to our earlier discussion</p>
<p>about reduction in reactive oxygen species,</p>
<p>so-called ROSs,</p>
<p>and reductions in free radicals that can damage cells.</p>
<p>So if all of this is sounding very convoluted,</p>
<p>I can understand why.</p>
<p>However, what I like about this study</p>
<p>and the two reviews that I mentioned a moment ago</p>
<p>is that these studies don&rsquo;t really say</p>
<p>that hydrogen-rich water is what&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>What these studies really point to</p>
<p>is that the changes in pH of water,</p>
<p>that enhancing the hydrogen in water can create,</p>
<p>is what leads to the enhanced either absorption</p>
<p>and or ability of cells to utilize that higher pH water.</p>
<p>Again, not by changing the pH of the body or of cells,</p>
<p>but simply because higher pH water,</p>
<p>or we could perhaps more accurately state,</p>
<p>less acidic water,</p>
<p>that is harder water that contains more magnesium</p>
<p>and calcium seems to be more readily used</p>
<p>by the cells of the body.</p>
<p>And therefore, it&rsquo;s very likely that the individuals</p>
<p>in this study were achieving higher</p>
<p>or more efficient levels of hydration.</p>
<p>Okay, so if any of this is confusing,</p>
<p>let me be very clear.</p>
<p>I do not believe that we all need to drink</p>
<p>deuterium-depleted water,</p>
<p>or that we all need to drink electrolyzed reduced water,</p>
<p>nor do I necessarily believe</p>
<p>that we all need to drink hydrogen-rich water.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s very clear to me</p>
<p>that all these different forms of water are better absorbed</p>
<p>and therefore lead to better and more efficient hydration,</p>
<p>and therefore can reduce inflammation, blood pressure,</p>
<p>and improve a number of other health metrics</p>
<p>because of the elevated pH</p>
<p>that all of these different purification</p>
<p>or water treatment methods achieve.</p>
<p>And that elevated pH, again,</p>
<p>is not changing the pH of the cells and tissues</p>
<p>and organs of your body.</p>
<p>You actually don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>Rather, that elevated pH is simply making the water</p>
<p>less acidic than it would be otherwise.</p>
<p>So the simple takeaway is this.</p>
<p>If your tap water contains sufficient magnesium</p>
<p>per the values that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to hydrogen-enrich your water.</p>
<p>I do, however, suggest that you at least analyze your water</p>
<p>or look at some of the professional analysis of water</p>
<p>that you can achieve online,</p>
<p>and filter out disinfectant byproducts and fluorides,</p>
<p>et cetera, from that magnesium,</p>
<p>or I should say sufficiently magnesium-containing water.</p>
<p>Okay, put simply, if your tap water has enough magnesium,</p>
<p>filter it, but drink it,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;re doing just fine.</p>
<p>If, however, the levels of magnesium in your tap water</p>
<p>are not above that value that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>in that case, I do think,</p>
<p>and I can completely understand why,</p>
<p>enriching the amount of hydrogen in that water</p>
<p>can make that water not only more palatable, right,</p>
<p>give you the sensation that it&rsquo;s softer or smoother</p>
<p>or more enjoyable to drink</p>
<p>than more acidic water would be,</p>
<p>but also that that water is going to be far more effective</p>
<p>in being absorbed and hydrating the cells</p>
<p>and tissues of your body,</p>
<p>which turns out to be very important for an enormous range,</p>
<p>perhaps every biological function</p>
<p>within your brain and body.</p>
<p>So how can you hydrogen enrich your water?</p>
<p>That actually can be done fairly inexpensively.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing that, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>as part of an experiment in preparation for this episode,</p>
<p>because it turns out that the water</p>
<p>that comes out of my tap has very little magnesium in it</p>
<p>and very little calcium as well.</p>
<p>The way to create hydrogen rich water</p>
<p>is you can simply purchase molecular hydrogen tablets,</p>
<p>which in reality are just magnesium tablets</p>
<p>that dissolve in water and create a free hydrogen</p>
<p>that can interact with the other water molecules.</p>
<p>Now, the chemistry behind it has been substantiated</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll provide a link in the show note captions</p>
<p>to a paper that gets into some fairly extensive detail</p>
<p>about the way that having an additional hydrogen</p>
<p>in your water can adjust the flow of electrons</p>
<p>and the adjustment of free radicals.</p>
<p>But keep in mind, again, this is all through increases</p>
<p>in the pH of your water.</p>
<p>And please keep in mind that you can&rsquo;t simply take</p>
<p>any other or any old magnesium tablet or capsule</p>
<p>and put it into water.</p>
<p>The configuration of the magnesium in these capsules</p>
<p>and tablets is such that it allows a rapid dissolving</p>
<p>of the tablet and the activation of the free hydrogen</p>
<p>that can interact with the water molecules.</p>
<p>Again, there are only a few scientific studies</p>
<p>exploring the real biological effects</p>
<p>of these activated hydrogen waters.</p>
<p>The dissolvable tablets are the far less expensive way</p>
<p>to go than purchasing pre-packaged</p>
<p>and sealed hydrogen water.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t recommend those brands</p>
<p>because they are quite expensive</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not clear how stable the activated</p>
<p>or free hydrogen is in those waters.</p>
<p>In any case, this is certainly not something</p>
<p>that everyone needs to do.</p>
<p>I mention it because I have had a good experience</p>
<p>with it myself.</p>
<p>I also will mention again that I have no business</p>
<p>or affiliation to any of these products.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link to a few of them</p>
<p>in the show note captions for those of you</p>
<p>that want to experiment.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling you this.</p>
<p>For those of you that want to experiment</p>
<p>with raising the pH of your water</p>
<p>without having to purchase what is ordinarily</p>
<p>quite expensive, higher pH water,</p>
<p>you can do this with these dissolvable magnesium tablets.</p>
<p>My experience with them has been quite good.</p>
<p>In fact, I plan to continue to use them</p>
<p>once or twice a day.</p>
<p>This is not the sort of thing that you need to do</p>
<p>in all the water that you drink.</p>
<p>I want to repeat, even if you go down this path</p>
<p>and you find that you really like</p>
<p>the activated hydrogen tablet approach,</p>
<p>it is not the case that you want to put these</p>
<p>in all of your water.</p>
<p>And you certainly don&rsquo;t want to put them</p>
<p>in carbonated waters of any kind</p>
<p>that will lead to a lot of gastric discomfort,</p>
<p>nor do you want to put them into hot liquids of any kind.</p>
<p>So again, this is the sort of thing that you do once</p>
<p>or twice, maybe three times a day,</p>
<p>and you can find out for yourself</p>
<p>and sort of measure subjectively</p>
<p>whether or not you like the experience</p>
<p>and whether or not you, quote unquote, feel better.</p>
<p>Now, earlier in the episode,</p>
<p>we were discussing structured water</p>
<p>or this fourth phase of water.</p>
<p>I know a number of people out there are curious</p>
<p>as to whether or not ingesting structured water</p>
<p>is somehow better for us</p>
<p>than ingesting non-structured water.</p>
<p>All I can say about this is that</p>
<p>it is a very controversial thing</p>
<p>to suggest that structured water</p>
<p>is somehow more biologically effective</p>
<p>or better for us than non-structured water.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways</p>
<p>that one can create structured water.</p>
<p>They involve some pretty extensive</p>
<p>and expensive at-home systems,</p>
<p>ranging anywhere from a couple of hundred dollars</p>
<p>to a couple of thousand dollars or more.</p>
<p>To be quite direct,</p>
<p>when one goes into the peer-reviewed scientific literature,</p>
<p>one will not find, that is,</p>
<p>there is essentially no real evidence</p>
<p>that ingesting structured water</p>
<p>leads to any specific desired biological outcomes.</p>
<p>Now, as I say that, I&rsquo;m sure there are people out there</p>
<p>who have still had tremendous experiences</p>
<p>ingesting structured water.</p>
<p>Whether or not that&rsquo;s due to a placebo effect</p>
<p>or a real effect of ingesting structured water isn&rsquo;t clear.</p>
<p>Just to give you a sense of what my stance is</p>
<p>on things like structured water,</p>
<p>I think that they are interesting and intriguing,</p>
<p>but as a scientist,</p>
<p>in the absence of any quality peer-reviewed data at present,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really suggest that people go out</p>
<p>and start ingesting structured water,</p>
<p>nor that they adhere to the claims</p>
<p>that structured water is going to be really, really good</p>
<p>for them compared to other forms of water.</p>
<p>That said, I do think that there&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>and open space for further exploration</p>
<p>of the biological effects of structured water,</p>
<p>given the fact that structured water does exist,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone debates that,</p>
<p>and the fact that the different structures of water</p>
<p>in this fourth phase of water, as we&rsquo;re calling it,</p>
<p>has been shown to interface with solids</p>
<p>and other aspects of liquids</p>
<p>and can do so within organelles of cells,</p>
<p>so different components of cells</p>
<p>that control different functions, including mitochondria.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a potential there.</p>
<p>Whether or not there&rsquo;s a promise there</p>
<p>is another question entirely.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to shut the door on structured water.</p>
<p>I think this is an open question</p>
<p>that I hope there will be more data</p>
<p>to answer those questions in the not-too-distant future,</p>
<p>and meanwhile, if any of you are aware</p>
<p>of good clinical studies exploring the biological effects</p>
<p>of structured water in either animal models or humans,</p>
<p>please put those references in the comments on YouTube,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m very curious as to how this area</p>
<p>of biological effects of structured water</p>
<p>is evolving and continues to evolve.</p>
<p>So today we discussed water, and admittedly,</p>
<p>we went into a lot of detail about the physics</p>
<p>and chemistry of water in its various forms,</p>
<p>and we talked about hydration,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s the main reason</p>
<p>why many of you are interested in or concerned about water.</p>
<p>We also talked about contaminants in tap water,</p>
<p>which unfortunately do exist and are very prominent</p>
<p>in essentially all regions of the world,</p>
<p>so please do get some information</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s coming out of your tap.</p>
<p>I also want to throw in one other piece of information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really critical that I learned about</p>
<p>when researching this episode,</p>
<p>which is the quality of water that comes out of your tap</p>
<p>is not just dictated by the source that it comes from,</p>
<p>external to your home or apartment,</p>
<p>your pipes are also important,</p>
<p>and that filter or that little mesh</p>
<p>that sits at the faucet head is also very important.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t pay attention to that,</p>
<p>but it turns out that a lot of debris and contaminants</p>
<p>can be derived from that little filter</p>
<p>that most people just simply aren&rsquo;t cleaning often enough.</p>
<p>So here, I&rsquo;m not trying to tell you that the metal</p>
<p>or the plastic that that filter is made of is a problem.</p>
<p>More often than not,</p>
<p>contaminants are showing up in water</p>
<p>because people aren&rsquo;t cleaning those filters often enough.</p>
<p>And in fact, prior to researching this episode,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t ever think to clean that filter.</p>
<p>I looked underneath my faucet,</p>
<p>and while that filter didn&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>particularly filled with debris,</p>
<p>I did find that when I took it off</p>
<p>and I looked at the other side,</p>
<p>there was quite a lot of debris.</p>
<p>So if you are going to consume tap water,</p>
<p>you definitely want to consider the source,</p>
<p>the pipes in your building or apartment,</p>
<p>the ones that lead right up to your glass or jug</p>
<p>that you would put that water into,</p>
<p>and also that mesh that that water passes through</p>
<p>as it goes into that glass or jug.</p>
<p>We also talked about how much water to drink.</p>
<p>I hope that we finally resolve that question.</p>
<p>For those of you that have been wondering about that,</p>
<p>the Galpin equation is a wonderful approach</p>
<p>to how much water to consume during exercise.</p>
<p>And by providing these other formulas</p>
<p>of about eight ounces or 240 milliliters of water per hour</p>
<p>for the 10 hours from waking until post-waking on average,</p>
<p>remember it&rsquo;s averages,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to consume them every hour on the hour,</p>
<p>and no need to be neurotic.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can achieve better levels of hydration,</p>
<p>which we know can lead to reductions in blood pressure,</p>
<p>improvements in appetite, mood, and focus.</p>
<p>And I really think that it&rsquo;s the improvements</p>
<p>in cognitive focus and physical ability,</p>
<p>both endurance, strength,</p>
<p>and other forms of kind of readiness in the body,</p>
<p>readiness to perform work in the body,</p>
<p>that really are best supported by the hydration literature.</p>
<p>And then of course,</p>
<p>we went through the different forms of water</p>
<p>that you hear about out there,</p>
<p>and addressed which ones are going to be beneficial or not,</p>
<p>and perhaps more importantly,</p>
<p>why any of them would be beneficial.</p>
<p>Thinking about that from the perspective of biologists</p>
<p>and the chemistry of water.</p>
<p>And I do hope that by arriving at this point</p>
<p>in the episode now,</p>
<p>that you have a much better understanding</p>
<p>of the chemistry and physics of water,</p>
<p>and the way that water can powerfully impact your biology.</p>

<p>On various episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like improving sleep,</p>
<p>supporting hormones, improving focus, and so on.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to have partnered</p>
<p>with Momentous Supplements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>are the very highest quality,</p>
<p>and are used with various sports teams,</p>
<p>and various studies through the Department of Defense,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>tend to be in single-ingredient formulations.</p>
<p>Single-ingredient formulations are absolutely essential</p>
<p>if you are going to develop the most cost-effective</p>
<p>and biologically effective supplement regimen for you,</p>
<p>because, simply put,</p>
<p>they allow you to adjust the dosage</p>
<p>of individual ingredients,</p>
<p>to alternate days that you take different ingredients,</p>
<p>to cycle them, and so forth.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentous Supplements</p>
<p>are available internationally,</p>
<p>which many other supplements are not.</p>
