    <p>Whatever reality is, it&rsquo;s not what you see.</p>
<p>What you see is just an adaptive fiction.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Donald Hoffman,</p>
<p>professor of cognitive sciences at UC Irvine,</p>
<p>focusing his research on evolutionary psychology,</p>
<p>visual perception, and consciousness.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of over 120 scientific papers</p>
<p>on these topics and his most recent book</p>
<p>titled The Case Against Reality,</p>
<p>Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.</p>
<p>I think some of the most interesting ideas in this world,</p>
<p>like those of Donald Hoffman&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>attempt to shake the foundation</p>
<p>of our understanding of reality,</p>
<p>and thus they take a long time to internalize deeply.</p>
<p>So proceed with caution.</p>
<p>Questioning the fabric of reality</p>
<p>can lead you to either madness or to truth.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is, you won&rsquo;t know which is which.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Donald Hoffman.</p>
<p>In your book, The Case Against Reality,</p>
<p>Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes,</p>
<p>you make the bold claim that the world we see</p>
<p>with our eyes is not real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even an abstraction of objective reality.</p>
<p>It is completely detached from objective reality.</p>
<p>Can you explain this idea?</p>
<p>Right, so this is a theorem</p>
<p>from evolution by natural selection.</p>
<p>So the technical question that I and my team asked was,</p>
<p>what is the probability that natural selection</p>
<p>would shape sensory systems</p>
<p>to see true properties of objective reality?</p>
<p>And to our surprise,</p>
<p>we found that the answer is precisely zero,</p>
<p>except for one kind of structure</p>
<p>that we can go into if you want to.</p>
<p>But for any generic structure</p>
<p>that you might think the world might have,</p>
<p>a total order, a topology, metric,</p>
<p>the probability is precisely zero</p>
<p>that natural selection would shape any sensory system</p>
<p>of any organism to see any aspect of objective reality.</p>
<p>So in that sense, what we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>is what we need to see</p>
<p>to stay alive long enough to reproduce.</p>
<p>So in other words, we&rsquo;re seeing what we need</p>
<p>to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.</p>
<p>So the evolutionary process,</p>
<p>the process that took us from the origin of life on Earth</p>
<p>to the humans that we are today,</p>
<p>that process does not maximize for truth,</p>
<p>it maximizes for fitness, as you say, fitness beats truth.</p>
<p>And fitness does not have to be connected to truth,</p>
<p>is the claim.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you have an approach</p>
<p>towards zero of probability</p>
<p>that we have evolved human cognition,</p>
<p>human consciousness, whatever it is,</p>
<p>the magic that makes our mind work,</p>
<p>evolved not for its ability to see the truth of reality,</p>
<p>but its ability to survive in the environment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>So most of us intuitively think that surely</p>
<p>the way that evolution will make our senses more fit</p>
<p>is to make them tell us more truths,</p>
<p>or at least the truths we need to know</p>
<p>about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the standard view, and it was the view I took.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s sort of what we&rsquo;re taught</p>
<p>or just even assume.</p>
<p>It was just sort of like the intelligent assumption</p>
<p>that we would all make.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have to just wave our hands.</p>
<p>Evolution of a natural selection</p>
<p>is a mathematically precise theory.</p>
<p>John Maynard Smith in the 70s</p>
<p>created evolutionary game theory.</p>
<p>And we have evolutionary graph theory</p>
<p>and even genetic algorithms that we can use to study this.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t have to wave our hands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of theorem and proof and or simulation</p>
<p>before you get the theorems and proofs.</p>
<p>And a couple of graduate students of mine,</p>
<p>Chester Mark and Brian Marion,</p>
<p>did some wonderful simulations that tipped me off</p>
<p>that there was something going on here.</p>
<p>And then I went to a mathematician, Chetan Prakash,</p>
<p>and Manish Singh, and some other friends of mine,</p>
<p>Chris Fields.</p>
<p>But Chetan was the real mathematician behind all this.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s proved several theorems</p>
<p>that uniformly indicate that with one exception,</p>
<p>which has to do with probability measures,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no, the probability is zero.</p>
<p>The reason there&rsquo;s an exception for probability measures,</p>
<p>so called sigma algebras or sigma additive classes,</p>
<p>is that for any scientific theory,</p>
<p>there is the assumption that needs to be made</p>
<p>that whatever structure,</p>
<p>whatever probabilistic structure the world may have</p>
<p>is not unrelated to the probabilistic structure</p>
<p>of our perceptions.</p>
<p>If they were completely unrelated,</p>
<p>then no science would be possible.</p>
<p>So this is technically the map from reality to our senses</p>
<p>has to be a so called measurable map,</p>
<p>has to preserve sigma algebras.</p>
<p>But that means it could be infinite to one,</p>
<p>and it could collapse all sorts of event information.</p>
<p>But other than that, there&rsquo;s no requirement</p>
<p>in standard evolutionary theory</p>
<p>for fitness payoff functions, for example,</p>
<p>to preserve any specific structures of objective reality.</p>
<p>So you can ask the technical question.</p>
<p>This is one of the avenues we took.</p>
<p>If you look at all the fitness payoffs</p>
<p>from whatever world structure you might want to imagine.</p>
<p>So a world with say a total order on it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got end states and they&rsquo;re totally ordered.</p>
<p>And then you can have a set of maps from that world</p>
<p>into a set of payoffs, say from zero to a thousand</p>
<p>or whatever you want your payoffs to be.</p>
<p>And you can just literally count all the payoff functions</p>
<p>and just do the combinatorics and count them.</p>
<p>And then you can ask the precise question,</p>
<p>how many of those payoff functions preserve the total order?</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for,</p>
<p>or how many preserve the topology?</p>
<p>And you just count them and divide.</p>
<p>So the number that are homomorphisms</p>
<p>versus the total number, and then take the limit</p>
<p>as the number of states in the world</p>
<p>and the number of payoff values goes very large.</p>
<p>And when you do that, you get zero every time.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a million things to ask here.</p>
<p>But first of all, just in case people</p>
<p>are not familiar with your work,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s sort of linger on the big bold statement here,</p>
<p>which is the thing we see with our eyes</p>
<p>is not some kind of limited window into reality.</p>
<p>It is completely detached from reality,</p>
<p>likely completely detached from reality.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying 100% likely.</p>
<p>Okay, so none of this is real in the way we think is real.</p>
<p>In the way we have this intuition,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like this table is some kind of abstraction,</p>
<p>but underneath it all, there&rsquo;s atoms.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an entire century of physics</p>
<p>that describes the functioning of those atoms</p>
<p>and the quirks that make them up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many Nobel Prizes about particles and fields</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff that slowly builds up</p>
<p>to something that&rsquo;s perceivable to us,</p>
<p>both with our eyes, with our different senses as this table.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s also ideas of chemistry</p>
<p>that over layers of abstraction, from DNA to embryos,</p>
<p>the cells that make the human body.</p>
<p>So all of that is not real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real experience,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a real adaptive set of perceptions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an adaptive set of perceptions, full stop.</p>
<p>We want to think that the perceptions are real.</p>
<p>So their perceptions are real as perceptions, right?</p>
<p>We are having our perceptions,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve assumed that there&rsquo;s a pretty tight relationship</p>
<p>between our perceptions and reality.</p>
<p>If I look up and see the moon,</p>
<p>then there is something that exists in space and time</p>
<p>that matches what I perceive.</p>
<p>And all I&rsquo;m saying is that if you take evolution</p>
<p>by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded.</p>
<p>That our perceptions are there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not there to show you the truth.</p>
<p>In fact, the way I think about it is</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there to hide the truth</p>
<p>because the truth is too complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like if you&rsquo;re trying to use your laptop</p>
<p>to write an email, right?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re doing is toggling voltages in the computer,</p>
<p>but good luck trying to do it that way.</p>
<p>The reason why we have a user interface</p>
<p>is because we don&rsquo;t want to know that quote unquote truth,</p>
<p>the diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.</p>
<p>If you had to know all that truth,</p>
<p>your friends wouldn&rsquo;t hear from you.</p>
<p>So what evolution gave us was perceptions</p>
<p>that guide adaptive behavior.</p>
<p>And part of that process, it turns out,</p>
<p>means hiding the truth and giving you eye candy.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between hiding the truth</p>
<p>and forming abstractions,</p>
<p>layers upon layers of abstractions</p>
<p>over low level voltages and transistors</p>
<p>and chips and programming languages</p>
<p>from assembly to Python that then leads you</p>
<p>to be able to have an interface like Chrome</p>
<p>where you open up another set of JavaScript and HTML</p>
<p>programming languages that lead you</p>
<p>to have a graphical user interface</p>
<p>and which you can then send your friends an email.</p>
<p>Is that completely detached from the zeros and ones</p>
<p>that are firing away inside the computer?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Of course, when I talk about the user interface</p>
<p>on your desktop, there&rsquo;s this whole sophisticated</p>
<p>backstory to it, right?</p>
<p>That the hardware and the software</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s allowing that to happen.</p>
<p>Evolution doesn&rsquo;t tell us the backstory, right?</p>
<p>So the theory of evolution is not going to be adequate</p>
<p>to tell you what is that backstory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna say that whatever reality is,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the interesting thing,</p>
<p>it says whatever reality is, you don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>You see a user interface,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t tell you what that user interface is,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s built, right?</p>
<p>Now, we can try to look at certain aspects</p>
<p>of the interface, but already we&rsquo;re gonna look at that</p>
<p>and go, okay, before I would look at neurons</p>
<p>and I was assuming that I was seeing something</p>
<p>that was at least partially true.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m realizing that it could be like looking</p>
<p>at the pixels on my desktop or icons on my desktop</p>
<p>and good luck going from that to the data structures</p>
<p>and then the voltages and I mean, good luck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just no way.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting about this is that</p>
<p>our scientific theories are precise enough</p>
<p>and rigorous enough to tell us certain limits,</p>
<p>but, and even limits of the theories themselves,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not going to tell us what the next move is</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where scientific creativity comes in.</p>
<p>So the stuff that I&rsquo;m saying here, for example,</p>
<p>is not alien to physicists.</p>
<p>The physicists are saying precisely the same thing</p>
<p>that space time is doomed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve assumed that space time is fundamental.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve assumed that for several centuries</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been very useful.</p>
<p>So all the things that you were mentioning,</p>
<p>the particles and all the work that&rsquo;s been done,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all been done in space time,</p>
<p>but now physicists are saying space time is doomed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as space time fundamentally</p>
<p>in the laws of physics.</p>
<p>And that comes actually out of gravity</p>
<p>together with quantum field theory,</p>
<p>which just comes right out of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a theorem of those two theories put together,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t tell you what&rsquo;s behind it.</p>
<p>So the physicists know that their best theories,</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s gravity and quantum field theory put together</p>
<p>entail that space time cannot be fundamental</p>
<p>and therefore particles in space time cannot be fundamental.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just irreducible representations</p>
<p>of the symmetries of space time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they are.</p>
<p>So we have, so space time, so we put the two together.</p>
<p>We put together what the physicists are discovering</p>
<p>and we can talk about how they do that.</p>
<p>And then we, the new discoveries</p>
<p>from evolution of a natural selection.</p>
<p>Both of these discoveries are really in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>And what both are saying is space time</p>
<p>has had a good ride.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been very useful.</p>
<p>Reductionism has been useful, but it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s time for us to go beyond.</p>
<p>When you say space time is doomed,</p>
<p>is it the space, is it the time,</p>
<p>is it the very hard coded specification of four dimensions?</p>
<p>Or are you specifically referring</p>
<p>to the kind of perceptual domain</p>
<p>that humans operate in, which is space time?</p>
<p>You think like there&rsquo;s a 3D, like our world</p>
<p>is three dimensional and time progresses forward.</p>
<p>Therefore, three dimensions plus one, 4D.</p>
<p>What exactly do you mean by space time?</p>
<p>And what do you mean by space time is doomed?</p>
<p>Great, great.</p>
<p>So this is, by the way, not my quote.</p>
<p>This is from, for example, Nima Arkanihaim Ed</p>
<p>at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.</p>
<p>Ed Witten, also there.</p>
<p>David Gross, Nobel Prize winner.</p>
<p>So this is not just something the cognitive scientists,</p>
<p>this is what the physicists are saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, the physicists, they&rsquo;re space time skeptics.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, they&rsquo;re saying that,</p>
<p>and I can say exactly why they think it&rsquo;s doomed.</p>
<p>But what they&rsquo;re saying is that,</p>
<p>because your question was what aspect of space time,</p>
<p>what are we talking about here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both space and time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re union into space time as an Einstein&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s doomed.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re basically saying that even quantum theory,</p>
<p>this is with Nima Arkanihaim Ed, especially.</p>
<p>So Hilbert spaces will not be fundamental either.</p>
<p>So that the notion of Hilbert space,</p>
<p>which is really critical to quantum field theory,</p>
<p>quantum information theory,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to figure</p>
<p>in the fundamental new laws of physics.</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>is some new mathematical structures beyond space time,</p>
<p>beyond Einstein&rsquo;s four dimensional space time</p>
<p>or super symmetric version,</p>
<p>geometric algebra signature two comma four kind of.</p>
<p>There are different ways that you can represent it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re finding new structures.</p>
<p>And then by the way, they&rsquo;re succeeding now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re finding, they found something</p>
<p>called the amplituhedron.</p>
<p>This is Nima and his colleagues,</p>
<p>the cosmological polytope.</p>
<p>So there are these like polytopes,</p>
<p>these polyhedra in multi dimensions,</p>
<p>generalizations of simplices that are coding for,</p>
<p>for example, the scattering amplitudes of processes</p>
<p>in the Large Hadron Collider and other colliders.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re finding that if they let go of space time,</p>
<p>completely, they&rsquo;re finding new ways</p>
<p>of computing these scattering amplitudes</p>
<p>that turn literally billions of terms into one term.</p>
<p>When you do it in space and time,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the wrong framework,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a user interface from,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not from the evolutionary point of view,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just user interface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a deep insight into the nature of reality.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s missing deep symmetry</p>
<p>is something called a dual conformal symmetry,</p>
<p>which turns out to be true of the scattering data,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t see it in space time.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s making the computations way too complicated</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to compute all the loops</p>
<p>in the Feynman diagrams and all the Feynman integrals.</p>
<p>So see the Feynman approach to the scattering amplitudes</p>
<p>is trying to enforce two critical properties of space time,</p>
<p>locality and unitarity.</p>
<p>And so by, when you enforce those,</p>
<p>you get all these loops and multiple,</p>
<p>different levels of loops.</p>
<p>And for each of those,</p>
<p>you have to add new terms to your computation.</p>
<p>But when you do it outside of space time,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have the notion of unitarity.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the notion of locality.</p>
<p>You have something deeper</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s capturing some symmetries</p>
<p>that are actually true of the data.</p>
<p>And, but then when you look at the geometry</p>
<p>of the facets of these polytopes,</p>
<p>then certain of them will code for unitarity and locality.</p>
<p>So it actually comes out of the structure</p>
<p>of these deep polytopes.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re finding is there&rsquo;s this whole new world.</p>
<p>Now beyond space time that is making explicit symmetries</p>
<p>that are true of the data</p>
<p>that cannot be seen in space time.</p>
<p>And that is turning the computations</p>
<p>from billions of terms to one or two or a handful of terms.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re getting insights into symmetries</p>
<p>and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not doing something silly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not adding up all these loops in space time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing something far deeper.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t know what this world is about.</p>
<p>Also, they&rsquo;re in an interesting position</p>
<p>where we know that space time is doomed.</p>
<p>And I should probably tell you why it&rsquo;s doomed,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re saying about why it&rsquo;s doomed.</p>
<p>But they need a flashlight to look beyond space time.</p>
<p>What flashlight are we gonna use</p>
<p>to look into the dark beyond space time?</p>
<p>Because Einstein&rsquo;s theory and quantum theory</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tell us what&rsquo;s beyond them.</p>
<p>All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,</p>
<p>space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,</p>
<p>10 to the minus 43 seconds.</p>
<p>Beyond that, space time doesn&rsquo;t even make sense.</p>
<p>It just has no operational definition.</p>
<p>So, but it doesn&rsquo;t tell you what&rsquo;s beyond.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re just looking for deep structures</p>
<p>like guessing is really fun.</p>
<p>So these really brilliant guys, generic brilliant men</p>
<p>and women who are doing this work, physicists,</p>
<p>are making guesses about these structures,</p>
<p>informed guesses, because they&rsquo;re trying to ask,</p>
<p>well, okay, what deeper structure could give us</p>
<p>the stuff that we&rsquo;re seeing in space time,</p>
<p>but without certain commitments</p>
<p>that we have to make in space time, like locality.</p>
<p>So they make these brilliant guesses.</p>
<p>And of course, most of the time you&rsquo;re gonna be wrong,</p>
<p>but once you get one or two that start to pay off</p>
<p>and then you get some lucky breaks.</p>
<p>So they got a lucky break back in 1986.</p>
<p>Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor</p>
<p>took the scattering amplitude for two gluons coming in</p>
<p>at high energy and four gluons going out at low energy.</p>
<p>So that kind of scattering thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like apparently for people who are into this,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of something that happens so often</p>
<p>you need to be able to find it and get rid of those</p>
<p>cause you already know about that and you need to.</p>
<p>So you needed to compute them.</p>
<p>It was billions of terms and they couldn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>even though for the supercomputers couldn&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>for the many billions or millions of times per second</p>
<p>they needed to do it.</p>
<p>So the experimentals begged the theorists,</p>
<p>please, you got it.</p>
<p>And so Park and Taylor took the billions of terms,</p>
<p>hundreds of pages and miraculously turned it into nine.</p>
<p>And then a little bit later,</p>
<p>they guessed one term expression</p>
<p>that turned out to be equivalent.</p>
<p>So billions of terms reduced to one term,</p>
<p>that so called famous Park Taylor formula, 1986.</p>
<p>And that was like, okay, where did that come from?</p>
<p>This is a pointer into a deep realm, beyond space and time,</p>
<p>but no one, I mean, what can you do with it?</p>
<p>And they thought maybe it was a one off,</p>
<p>but then other formulas started coming up.</p>
<p>And then eventually Neymar, Connie, Hamid and his team</p>
<p>found this thing called the amplituhedron,</p>
<p>which really sort of captures the whole,</p>
<p>a big part of the whole ball of wax.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they would say, no, there&rsquo;s plenty more to do.</p>
<p>So I won&rsquo;t say they did it all by any means.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at the cosmological polytope as well.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s remarkable to me is that two pillars</p>
<p>of modern science, quantum field theory with gravity</p>
<p>on the one hand and evolution by natural selection</p>
<p>on the other, just in the last 20 years</p>
<p>have very clearly said space time has had a good run.</p>
<p>Reductionism has been a fantastic methodology.</p>
<p>So we had a great ontology of space time,</p>
<p>a great methodology of reductionism.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for a new trick.</p>
<p>But now you need to go deeper and show,</p>
<p>but by the way, this doesn&rsquo;t mean we throw away</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;ve done, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>Every new idea that we come up with beyond space time</p>
<p>must project precisely into space time.</p>
<p>And it better give us back everything that we know</p>
<p>and love in space time or generalizations,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not gonna be taken seriously and it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>So we have a strong constraint on whatever we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>beyond space time, it needs to project into space time.</p>
<p>And whatever this deeper theory is,</p>
<p>it may not itself have evolution by natural selection.</p>
<p>This may not be part of this deeper realm.</p>
<p>But when we take whatever that thing is beyond space time</p>
<p>and project it into space time,</p>
<p>it has to look like evolution by natural selection</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a strong constraint on this work.</p>
<p>So even the evolution by natural selection</p>
<p>and quantum field theory could be interfaces</p>
<p>into something that doesn&rsquo;t look anything like,</p>
<p>like you mentioned.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting to think that evolution</p>
<p>might be a very crappy interface</p>
<p>into something much deeper.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both telling us that the framework that you&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>can only go so far and it has to stop.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something beyond.</p>
<p>And the very framework that is space and time itself.</p>
<p>Now, of course, evolution by natural selection</p>
<p>is not telling us about like Einstein&rsquo;s relativistic</p>
<p>space time.</p>
<p>So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling us more about our perceptual space and time,</p>
<p>which we have used as the basis for creating</p>
<p>first Newtonian space versus time</p>
<p>as a mathematical extension of our perceptions.</p>
<p>And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further.</p>
<p>So the relationship between what evolution is telling us</p>
<p>and what the physicists are telling us is that</p>
<p>in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space time</p>
<p>are formulated as sort of rigorous extensions</p>
<p>of our perceptual space,</p>
<p>making it mathematically rigorous</p>
<p>and laying out the symmetries that they find there.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of the relationship between them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the perceptual space time</p>
<p>that evolution is telling us</p>
<p>is just a user interface effectively.</p>
<p>And then the physicists are finding</p>
<p>that even the mathematical extension of that</p>
<p>into the Einsteinian formulation has to be as well,</p>
<p>not the final story, there&rsquo;s something deeper.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces</p>
<p>as we march forward from Newtonian physics</p>
<p>to quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>These are all, in your view, interfaces.</p>
<p>Are we getting closer to objective reality?</p>
<p>How do we know if these interfaces in the process of science,</p>
<p>the reason we like those interfaces</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re predictive of some aspects,</p>
<p>strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality.</p>
<p>Is that completely deviating</p>
<p>from our understanding of that reality</p>
<p>or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?</p>
<p>Well, of course, one critical constraint</p>
<p>on all of our theories</p>
<p>is that they are empirically tested</p>
<p>and pass the experiments that we have for them.</p>
<p>So no one&rsquo;s arguing against experiments being important</p>
<p>and wanting to test all of our current theories</p>
<p>and any new theories on that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all there.</p>
<p>But we have good reason to believe</p>
<p>that science will never get a theory of everything.</p>
<p>Everything, everything.</p>
<p>Everything, everything, right.</p>
<p>A final theory of everything, right.</p>
<p>I think that my own take is, for what it&rsquo;s worth,</p>
<p>is that G√∂del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem</p>
<p>sort of points us in that direction,</p>
<p>that even with mathematics,</p>
<p>any finite axiomatization that&rsquo;s sophisticated enough</p>
<p>to be able to do arithmetic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to show that there&rsquo;ll be statements that are true,</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t be proven,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be deduced from within that framework.</p>
<p>And if you add the new statements to your axioms,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;ll be always new statements that are true,</p>
<p>but can&rsquo;t be proven with a new axiom system.</p>
<p>And the best scientific theories in physics, for example,</p>
<p>and also now evolution, are mathematical.</p>
<p>So our theories are gonna be,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna have their own assumptions</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be mathematically precise.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ll be theories, perhaps,</p>
<p>of everything except those assumptions,</p>
<p>because the assumptions are,</p>
<p>we say, please grant me these assumptions.</p>
<p>If you grant me these assumptions,</p>
<p>then I can explain this other stuff.</p>
<p>So you have the assumptions that are like miracles,</p>
<p>as far as the theory is concerned.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not explained.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the starting points for explanation.</p>
<p>And then you have the mathematical structure</p>
<p>of the theory itself, which will have the G√∂del limits.</p>
<p>And so my take is that reality,</p>
<p>reality, whatever it is, is always going to transcend</p>
<p>any conceptual theory that we didn&rsquo;t come up with.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always gonna be mystery at the edges.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Contradictions and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And truths.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this idea that is brought up</p>
<p>in the financial space of settlement of transactions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often talked about in cryptocurrency, especially.</p>
<p>So you could do, you know, money, cash,</p>
<p>is not connected to anything.</p>
<p>It used to be connected to gold, to physical reality,</p>
<p>but then you can use money to exchange,</p>
<p>to exchange value, to transact.</p>
<p>So when it was on the gold standard,</p>
<p>the money would represent some stable component of reality.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it more effective to avoid things like hyperinflation</p>
<p>if we generalize that idea?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it better to connect your,</p>
<p>whatever we humans are doing</p>
<p>in the social interaction space with each other,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it better from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p>to connect it to some degree to reality</p>
<p>so that the transactions are settled</p>
<p>with something that&rsquo;s universal,</p>
<p>as opposed to us constantly operating</p>
<p>in something that&rsquo;s a complete illusion?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it easy to hyperinflate that?</p>
<p>Like where you really deviate very, very far away</p>
<p>from the underlying reality,</p>
<p>or do you not never get in trouble for this?</p>
<p>Can you just completely drift far, far away</p>
<p>from the underlying reality and never get in trouble?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question, on the financial side,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two levels at least</p>
<p>that we could take your question.</p>
<p>One is strictly like evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>of financial systems, and that&rsquo;s pretty interesting.</p>
<p>And there the decentralized idea,</p>
<p>the DeFi kind of idea in cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>may make good sense</p>
<p>from just an evolutionary psychology point of view.</p>
<p>Having human nature being what it is,</p>
<p>putting a lot of faith in a few central controllers</p>
<p>depends a lot on the veracity of those</p>
<p>and trustworthiness of those few central controllers.</p>
<p>And we have ample evidence time and again</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s often betrayed.</p>
<p>So it makes good evolutionary sense, I would say,</p>
<p>to have a decentralized,</p>
<p>I mean, democracy is a step in that direction, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a monarch now telling us what to do,</p>
<p>we decentralize things, right?</p>
<p>Because if the monarch,</p>
<p>if you have Marcus Aurelius as your emperor, you&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>If you have Nero, it&rsquo;s not so great.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>So democracy is a step in that direction,</p>
<p>but I think the DeFi thing is an even bigger step</p>
<p>and is going to even make the democratization even greater.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one level of it.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that power corrupts</p>
<p>and absolute power corrupts absolutely</p>
<p>is also a consequence of evolution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also a feature, I think, right?</p>
<p>You can argue from the long span of living organisms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice for power to corrupt for you to,</p>
<p>so mad men and women throughout history</p>
<p>might be useful to teach us a lesson about ourselves.</p>
<p>We can learn from our negative example, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Power does corrupt and I think that you can think about that</p>
<p>again from an evolutionary point of view.</p>
<p>But I think that your question was a little deeper</p>
<p>when that was, does the evolutionary interface idea</p>
<p>sort of unhinge science from some kind of important test</p>
<p>for the theories, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that anything goes</p>
<p>in scientific theory, but there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t see the truth,</p>
<p>is there no way to tether our theories and test them?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s no problem there.</p>
<p>We can only test things in terms of what we can measure</p>
<p>with our senses in space and time.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to have to continue to do experiments</p>
<p>and, but we&rsquo;re going to re,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to understand a little bit differently</p>
<p>what those experiments are.</p>
<p>We had thought that when we see a pointer</p>
<p>on some machine in an experiment,</p>
<p>that the machine exists, the pointer exists</p>
<p>and the values exist even when no one is looking at them</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re an objective truth.</p>
<p>And our best theories are telling us no,</p>
<p>the pointers are just pointers</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you have to rely on</p>
<p>for making your judgments.</p>
<p>But even the pointers themselves</p>
<p>are not the objective reality.</p>
<p>So, and I think G√∂del is telling us that,</p>
<p>not that anything goes, but as you develop</p>
<p>new axiom systems, you will find out what goes</p>
<p>within that axiom system</p>
<p>and what testable predictions you can make.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re untethered.</p>
<p>We continue to do experiments.</p>
<p>What I think we won&rsquo;t have that we want</p>
<p>is a conceptual understanding</p>
<p>that gives us a theory of everything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s final and complete.</p>
<p>I think that this is, to put it another way,</p>
<p>this is job security for scientists.</p>
<p>Our job will never be done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s job security for neuroscience.</p>
<p>Because before we thought that when we looked in the brain,</p>
<p>we saw neurons and neural networks</p>
<p>and action potentials and synapses and so forth.</p>
<p>And that was it, that was the reality.</p>
<p>Now we have to reverse engineer that.</p>
<p>We have to say, what is beyond space time?</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>What is a dynamical system beyond space time?</p>
<p>That when we project it into Einstein&rsquo;s space time,</p>
<p>gives us things that look like neurons</p>
<p>and neural networks and synapses.</p>
<p>So we have to reverse engineer it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s gonna be lots more work for neuroscience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be far more complicated</p>
<p>and difficult and challenging.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s wonderful, that&rsquo;s what we need to do.</p>
<p>We thought neurons exist when they are perceived</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In the same way that if I show you,</p>
<p>when I say they don&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>I should be very, very concrete.</p>
<p>If I draw on a piece of paper,</p>
<p>a little sketch of something that is called the Necker cube,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a little line drawing of a cube, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a flat piece of paper.</p>
<p>If I execute it well, and I show it to you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see a 3D cube and you&rsquo;ll see it flip.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll see one face in front,</p>
<p>sometimes you&rsquo;ll see the other face in front.</p>
<p>But if I ask you, which face is in front</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t look?</p>
<p>The answer is, well, neither face is in front</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no cube.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a flat piece of paper.</p>
<p>So when you look at the piece of paper,</p>
<p>you perceptually create the cube.</p>
<p>And when you look at it,</p>
<p>then you fix one face to be in front and one face to be.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean when I say it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Space time itself is like the cube.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a data structure that your sensory systems construct,</p>
<p>whatever your sensory systems mean now,</p>
<p>because we now have to not even take that for granted.</p>
<p>But there are perceptions that you construct on the fly</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re data structures in a computer science sense,</p>
<p>and you garbage collect them when you don&rsquo;t need them.</p>
<p>So you create them and garbage collect them.</p>
<p>But is it possible that it&rsquo;s mapped well</p>
<p>in some concrete, predictable way to objective reality?</p>
<p>The sheet of paper, this two dimensional space,</p>
<p>or we can talk about space time,</p>
<p>maps in some way that we maybe don&rsquo;t yet understand,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll one day understand what that mapping is,</p>
<p>but it maps reliably.</p>
<p>It is tethered in that way.</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>And so the new theories that the physicists are finding</p>
<p>beyond space time have that kind of tethering.</p>
<p>So they show precisely how you start with an epileptic hedron</p>
<p>and how you project this high dimensional structure</p>
<p>into the four dimensions of space time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a precise procedure that relates the two.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing the same thing</p>
<p>with the cosmological polytopes.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re the ones that are making the most concrete</p>
<p>and fun advances going beyond space time.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re tethering it, right?</p>
<p>They say this is precisely the mathematical projection</p>
<p>from this deeper structure into space time.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ll say about, as a non physicist,</p>
<p>what I find interesting is that they&rsquo;re finding just geometry,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no notion of dynamics.</p>
<p>Right now, they&rsquo;re just finding</p>
<p>these static geometric structures, which is impressive.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not putting them down.</p>
<p>This is what they&rsquo;re doing is unbelievably complicated</p>
<p>and brilliant and adventurous, it&rsquo;s all those things.</p>
<p>And beautiful from a human aesthetic perspective</p>
<p>because geometry is beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re finding symmetries that are true of the data</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t be seen in space time.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m looking for a theory beyond space time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a dynamical theory.</p>
<p>I would love to find, and we can talk about that</p>
<p>at some point, a theory of consciousness</p>
<p>in which the dynamics of consciousness itself</p>
<p>will give rise to the geometry</p>
<p>that the physicists are finding beyond space time.</p>
<p>If we can do that,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;d have a completely different way</p>
<p>of looking at how consciousness is related</p>
<p>to what we call the brain or the physical world</p>
<p>more generally, right?</p>
<p>Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues,</p>
<p>well, 99% of them are trying to,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re assuming space time is fundamental.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re assuming that particles are fundamental,</p>
<p>quarks, gluons, leptons, and so forth.</p>
<p>Elements, atoms, and so forth are fundamental</p>
<p>and that therefore neurons and brains</p>
<p>are part of objective reality.</p>
<p>And that somehow when you get matter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s complicated enough,</p>
<p>it will somehow generate conscious experiences</p>
<p>by its functional properties.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re panpsychist, maybe you,</p>
<p>in addition to the physical properties of particles,</p>
<p>you add your consciousness property as well.</p>
<p>And then you combine these physical and conscious properties</p>
<p>to get more complicated ones.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re all doing it within space time.</p>
<p>All of the work that&rsquo;s being done on consciousness</p>
<p>and its relationship to the brain</p>
<p>is all assumed something that our best theories</p>
<p>are telling us is doomed, space time.</p>
<p>Why does that particular assumption bother you the most?</p>
<p>So you bring up space time.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just one useful interface</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve used for a long time.</p>
<p>Surely there&rsquo;s other interfaces.</p>
<p>Is space time just one of the big ones</p>
<p>that you, to build up people&rsquo;s intuition</p>
<p>about the fact that they do assume a lot of things strongly?</p>
<p>Or is it in fact the fundamental flaw</p>
<p>in the way we see the world?</p>
<p>Well, everything else that we think we know</p>
<p>are things in space time.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And so when you say space time is doomed,</p>
<p>this is a shot to the heart of the whole framework,</p>
<p>the whole conceptual framework that we&rsquo;ve had in science.</p>
<p>Not to the scientific method,</p>
<p>but to the fundamental ontology</p>
<p>and also the fundamental methodology,</p>
<p>the ontology of space time and its contents,</p>
<p>and the methodology of reductionism,</p>
<p>which is that as we go to smaller scales in space time,</p>
<p>we will find more and more fundamental laws.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s been very useful for space and time for centuries,</p>
<p>reductionism for centuries.</p>
<p>But now we realize that that&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Reductionism is in fact dead, as is space time.</p>
<p>What exactly is reductionism?</p>
<p>What is the process of reductionism</p>
<p>that is different than some of the physicists</p>
<p>that you mentioned that are trying to think,</p>
<p>trying to let go of the assumption of space time?</p>
<p>Looking beyond, isn&rsquo;t that still trying to come up</p>
<p>with a simple model that explains this whole thing?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it still reducing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful question,</p>
<p>because it really helps to clarify two different notions,</p>
<p>which is scientific explanation on the one hand,</p>
<p>and a particular kind of scientific explanation on the other,</p>
<p>which is the reductionist.</p>
<p>So the reductionist explanation is saying,</p>
<p>I will start with things that are smaller in space time</p>
<p>and therefore more fundamental,</p>
<p>where the laws are more fundamental.</p>
<p>So we go to just smaller and smaller scales.</p>
<p>Whereas in science more generally,</p>
<p>we just say like when Einstein</p>
<p>did the special theory of relativity,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s saying, let me have a couple of postulates.</p>
<p>I will assume that the speed of light is universal</p>
<p>for all observers in uniform motion,</p>
<p>and that the laws of physics,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re for uniform motion are,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a reductionist.</p>
<p>Those are saying, grant me these assumptions.</p>
<p>I can build this entire concept of space time out of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a reductionist thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to smaller and smaller scales of space.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re coming up with these deep, deep principles.</p>
<p>Same thing with his theory of gravity, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the falling elevator idea, right?</p>
<p>So this is not a reductionist kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something different.</p>
<p>So simplification is a bigger thing than just reductionism.</p>
<p>Reductionism has been a particularly useful</p>
<p>kind of scientific explanation,</p>
<p>for example, in thermodynamics, right?</p>
<p>Where the notion that we have of heat,</p>
<p>some macroscopic thing like temperature and heat,</p>
<p>it turns out that Neil Boltzmann and others discovered,</p>
<p>well, hey, if we go to smaller and smaller scales,</p>
<p>we find these things called molecules or atoms.</p>
<p>And if we think of them as bouncing around</p>
<p>and having some kind of energy,</p>
<p>then what we call heat really can be reduced to that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a particularly useful kind of reduction,</p>
<p>is a useful kind of scientific explanation</p>
<p>that works within a range of scales within space time.</p>
<p>But we know now precisely where that has to stop.</p>
<p>At 10 to the minus 33 centimeters</p>
<p>and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.</p>
<p>And I would be impressed</p>
<p>if it was 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to comprehend</p>
<p>either of those numbers, frankly.</p>
<p>Just a small aside,</p>
<p>because I am a computer science person,</p>
<p>I also find cellular automata beautiful.</p>
<p>And so you have somebody like Stephen Wolfram,</p>
<p>who recently has been very excitedly exploring</p>
<p>a proposal for a data structure</p>
<p>that could be the numbers that would make you</p>
<p>a little bit happier in terms of scale,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very, very, very, very tiny.</p>
<p>So do you like this space of exploration</p>
<p>of really thinking, letting go of space time,</p>
<p>letting go of everything and trying to think</p>
<p>what kind of data structures</p>
<p>could be underneath this whole mess?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re thinking about these as outside of space time,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s what we have to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what our best theories are telling us.</p>
<p>You now have to think outside of space time.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I should back up and say,</p>
<p>we know that Einstein surpassed Newton, right?</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that there&rsquo;s not good work</p>
<p>to do on Newton.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all sorts of Newtonian physics</p>
<p>that takes us to the moon and so forth,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s lots of good problems</p>
<p>that we want to solve with Newtonian physics.</p>
<p>The same thing will be true of space time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re gonna stop using space time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll continue to do all sorts of good work there.</p>
<p>But for those scientists who are really looking</p>
<p>to go deeper, to actually find the next,</p>
<p>just like what Einstein did to Newton,</p>
<p>what are we gonna do to Einstein?</p>
<p>How do we get beyond Einstein and quantum theory</p>
<p>to something deeper?</p>
<p>Then we have to actually let go.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re gonna do like this automata kind of approach,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s critical that it&rsquo;s not automata in space time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s automata prior to space time,</p>
<p>from which we&rsquo;re going to show how space time emerges.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing automata within space time,</p>
<p>well, that might be a fun model,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the radical new step that we need.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the space time emerges from that whatever system.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re saying, it&rsquo;s a dynamical system.</p>
<p>Do we even have an understanding what dynamical means</p>
<p>when we go beyond?</p>
<p>When you start to think about dynamics,</p>
<p>it could mean a lot of things.</p>
<p>Even causality could mean a lot of things</p>
<p>if we realize that everything&rsquo;s an interface.</p>
<p>Like how much do we really know is an interesting question.</p>
<p>Because you brought up neurons,</p>
<p>I gotta ask you yet another tangent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a paper I remember a while ago looking at</p>
<p>called Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?</p>
<p>And I just enjoyed that thought experiment</p>
<p>that they provided, which is they basically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a couple of neuroscientists,</p>
<p>Eric Jonas and Conrad Cording,</p>
<p>who use the tools of neuroscience</p>
<p>to analyze a microprocessor, so a computer chip.</p>
<p>Now, if we lesion it here, what happens and so forth,</p>
<p>and if you go and lesion in a computer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, very clear that lesion experiments on computers</p>
<p>are not gonna give you a lot of insight into how it works.</p>
<p>And also the measurement devices and the kind of sort of,</p>
<p>just using the basic approaches of neuroscience,</p>
<p>collecting the data, trying to intuit</p>
<p>about the underlying function of it.</p>
<p>And that helps you understand that</p>
<p>our scientific exploration of concepts,</p>
<p>depending on the field,</p>
<p>are maybe in the very, very early stages.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it leaves us astray,</p>
<p>perhaps it does sometimes,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not anywhere close to some fundamental mechanism</p>
<p>that actually makes a thing work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can sort of comment on that</p>
<p>in terms of using neuroscience</p>
<p>to understand the human mind and neurons.</p>
<p>Are we really far away potentially</p>
<p>from understanding in the way we understand</p>
<p>the transistors enough to be able to build a computer?</p>
<p>So one thing about understanding</p>
<p>is you can understand for fun.</p>
<p>The other one is to understand so you could build things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you really have to understand.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>In fact, what got me into the field at MIT</p>
<p>was work by David Marr on this very topic.</p>
<p>So David Marr was a professor at MIT,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;d done his PhD in neuroscience,</p>
<p>studying just the architectures of the brain.</p>
<p>But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum.</p>
<p>He realized that his work, as rigorous as it was,</p>
<p>left him unsatisfied</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t know what the cerebellum was for</p>
<p>and why it had that architecture.</p>
<p>And so he went to MIT and he was in the AI lab there.</p>
<p>And he said, he had this three level approach</p>
<p>that really grabbed my attention.</p>
<p>So when I was an undergrad at UCLA,</p>
<p>I read one of his papers in a class and said,</p>
<p>who is this guy?</p>
<p>Because he said, you have to have a computational theory.</p>
<p>What is being computed and why?</p>
<p>An algorithm, how is it being computed?</p>
<p>What are the precise algorithms?</p>
<p>And then the hardware,</p>
<p>how does it get instantiated in the hardware?</p>
<p>And so to really do neuroscience, he argued,</p>
<p>we needed to have understanding at all those levels.</p>
<p>And that really got me.</p>
<p>I loved the neuroscience, but I realized this guy was saying,</p>
<p>if you can&rsquo;t build it, you don&rsquo;t understand it effectively.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I went to MIT.</p>
<p>And I had the pleasure of working with David</p>
<p>until he died just a year and a half later.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been that idea that with neuroscience,</p>
<p>we have to have, in some sense, a top down model</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s being computed and why</p>
<p>that we would then go after.</p>
<p>And the same thing with the, you know,</p>
<p>trying to reverse engineer a computing system</p>
<p>like your laptop.</p>
<p>We really need to understand</p>
<p>what the user interface is about</p>
<p>and what are keys on the keyboard for and so forth.</p>
<p>You need to know why to really understand</p>
<p>all the circuitry and what it&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p>Now, we don&rsquo;t, evolution of a natural selection</p>
<p>does not tell us the deeper question that we&rsquo;re asking,</p>
<p>the answer to the deeper question, which is why?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this deeper reality and what&rsquo;s it up to and why?</p>
<p>All it tells us is that whatever reality is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not what you see.</p>
<p>What you see is just an adaptive fiction.</p>
<p>So just to linger on this fascinating, bold question</p>
<p>that shakes you out of your dream state.</p>
<p>Does this fiction still help you in building intuitions</p>
<p>as literary fiction does about reality?</p>
<p>The reason we read literary fiction</p>
<p>is it helps us build intuitions and understanding</p>
<p>in indirect ways sneak up to the difficult questions</p>
<p>of human nature, great fiction.</p>
<p>Same with this observed reality.</p>
<p>Does this interface that we get, this fictional interface,</p>
<p>help us build intuition about deeper truths</p>
<p>of how this whole mess works?</p>
<p>Well, I think that each theory that we propose</p>
<p>will give its own answer to that question, right?</p>
<p>So when the physicists are proposing these structures</p>
<p>like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytope,</p>
<p>associahedron and so forth beyond space time,</p>
<p>we can then ask your question for those specific structures</p>
<p>and say, how much information, for example,</p>
<p>does evolution by natural selection</p>
<p>and the kinds of sensory systems that we have right now</p>
<p>give us about this deeper reality?</p>
<p>And why did we evolve this way?</p>
<p>We can try to answer that question from within the deep.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not gonna be a general answer.</p>
<p>I think what we&rsquo;ll have to do is posit</p>
<p>these new deeper theories</p>
<p>and then try to answer your question</p>
<p>within the framework of those deeper theories,</p>
<p>knowing full well that there&rsquo;ll be an even deeper theory.</p>
<p>So is this paralyzing though?</p>
<p>Because how do we know we&rsquo;re not completely adrift</p>
<p>out to sea, lost forever from,</p>
<p>so like that our theories are completely lost.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s all,</p>
<p>if we can never truly deeply introspect to the bottom,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s always just turtles on top of turtles infinitely,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that paralyzing for the scientific mind?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting that you say introspect</p>
<p>to the bottom.</p>
<p>Because there is one,</p>
<p>again, this isn&rsquo;t the same spirit of what I said before,</p>
<p>which is it depends on what answer you give</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s beyond space time,</p>
<p>what answer we would give to your question, right?</p>
<p>So, but one answer that is interesting to explore</p>
<p>is something that spiritual traditions have said</p>
<p>for thousands of years, but haven&rsquo;t said precisely.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t take it seriously in science</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s made precise,</p>
<p>but we might be able to make it precise.</p>
<p>And that is that they&rsquo;ve also said something like</p>
<p>space and time aren&rsquo;t fundamental,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re Maya, they&rsquo;re illusion.</p>
<p>And, but that if you look inside, if you introspect</p>
<p>and let go of all of your particular perceptions,</p>
<p>you will come to something that&rsquo;s beyond conceptual thought.</p>
<p>And that is, they claim,</p>
<p>being in contact with the deep ground of being</p>
<p>that transcends any particular conceptual understanding.</p>
<p>If that is correct, and I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>but, and I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not correct,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, if that&rsquo;s correct,</p>
<p>then it would be the case that as scientists,</p>
<p>because we also are in touch with this ground of being,</p>
<p>we would then not be able</p>
<p>to conceptually understand ourselves all the way,</p>
<p>but we could know ourselves just by being ourselves.</p>
<p>And so we would, there would be a sense</p>
<p>in which there is a fundamental grounding</p>
<p>to the whole enterprise,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not separate from the enterprise.</p>
<p>This is the opposite of the impersonal third person science.</p>
<p>This would make science go personal all the way down.</p>
<p>And, but nevertheless, scientific,</p>
<p>because the scientific method would still be</p>
<p>what we would use all the way down</p>
<p>for the conceptual understanding.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I still don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you went all the way down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about it,</p>
<p>is getting the cliche statement of be yourself.</p>
<p>It is somehow digging at a deeper truth of reality,</p>
<p>but you still don&rsquo;t know when you get to the bottom.</p>
<p>A lot of people, they&rsquo;ll take psychedelic drugs</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll say, well, that takes my mind to certain places</p>
<p>where it feels like that is revealing</p>
<p>some deeper truth of reality,</p>
<p>but you still, it could be interfaces on top of interfaces.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, in your view of this, you really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s Gato&rsquo;s incompleteness</p>
<p>is that you really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>My own view on it, for what it&rsquo;s worth,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know the right answer,</p>
<p>but my own view on it right now is that it&rsquo;s never ending.</p>
<p>I think that there will never,</p>
<p>that this is great, as I said before,</p>
<p>great job security for science.</p>
<p>And that we, if this is true,</p>
<p>and if consciousness is somehow important</p>
<p>or fundamental in the universe,</p>
<p>this may be an important fundamental fact</p>
<p>about consciousness itself,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a never ending exploration</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on in some sense.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Push back on the job security.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So maybe as we understand this kind of idea</p>
<p>deeper and deeper,</p>
<p>we understand that the pursuit is not a fruitful one.</p>
<p>Then maybe we need to,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t see aliens everywhere,</p>
<p>is you get smarter and smarter and smarter,</p>
<p>you realize that exploration is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other fun ways to spend your time than exploring.</p>
<p>You could be sort of living maximally</p>
<p>in some way that&rsquo;s not exploration.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of video games you can construct</p>
<p>and put yourself inside of them</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t involve you going outside of the game world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feeling, from my human perspective,</p>
<p>what seems to be fun is challenging yourself</p>
<p>and overcoming those challenges.</p>
<p>So you can constantly artificially generate challenges</p>
<p>for yourself, like Sisyphus and his boulder,</p>
<p>just, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So the scientific method</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always reaching out to the stars,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always trying to figure out</p>
<p>the puzzle on the bottom puzzle,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always trying to get to the bottom turtle.</p>
<p>Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s infinite pursuit,</p>
<p>we agree to start deviating from that pursuit</p>
<p>and start enjoying the here and now</p>
<p>versus the looking out into the unknown always.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s looking out into the unknown</p>
<p>as a early activity for a species that&rsquo;s evolved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just sort of saying, pushing back,</p>
<p>as you probably got a lot of scientists excited</p>
<p>in terms of job security,</p>
<p>I could envision where it&rsquo;s not job security,</p>
<p>where scientists become more and more useless.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re like the holders of the ancient wisdom</p>
<p>that allows us to study our own history,</p>
<p>but not much more than that, just to push back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good pushback.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put one in there for the scientists again,</p>
<p>but sure, but then I&rsquo;ll take the other side too.</p>
<p>So when Faraday did all of his experiments</p>
<p>with magnets and electricity and so forth,</p>
<p>he came up with all this wonderful empirical data</p>
<p>and James Clerk Maxwell looked at it</p>
<p>and wrote down a few equations,</p>
<p>which we can now write down in a single equation,</p>
<p>the Maxwell equation if we use geometric algebra,</p>
<p>just one equation.</p>
<p>That opened up unbelievable technologies.</p>
<p>People are zooming and talking to each other</p>
<p>around the world, the whole electronics industry.</p>
<p>There was something that transformed our lives</p>
<p>in a very positive way.</p>
<p>With the theories beyond space time,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s one potential, right now,</p>
<p>most of the galaxies that we see, we can see them,</p>
<p>but we know that we could never get to them</p>
<p>no matter how fast we traveled.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going away from us at the speed of light or beyond.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t ever get to them.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all this beautiful real estate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just smiling and waving at us</p>
<p>and we can never get to it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s if we go through space time.</p>
<p>But if we recognize that space time</p>
<p>is just a data structure, it&rsquo;s not fundamental.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not little things inside space time.</p>
<p>Space time was a little data structure in our perceptions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the other way around.</p>
<p>Once we understand that,</p>
<p>and we get equations for the stuff that&rsquo;s beyond space time,</p>
<p>maybe we won&rsquo;t have to go through space time.</p>
<p>Maybe we can go around it.</p>
<p>Maybe I can go to Proxima Centauri</p>
<p>and not go through space.</p>
<p>I can just go right there directly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a data structure.</p>
<p>We can start to play with it.</p>
<p>So I think that for what it&rsquo;s worth,</p>
<p>my take would be that the endless sequence of theories</p>
<p>that we could contemplate building</p>
<p>will lead to an endless sequence of new remarkable insights</p>
<p>into the potentialities, the possibilities</p>
<p>that would seem miraculous to us.</p>
<p>And that we will be motivated to continue the exploration</p>
<p>partly just for the technological innovations</p>
<p>that come out.</p>
<p>But the other thing that you mentioned though,</p>
<p>what about just being?</p>
<p>What if we decide instead of all this doing and exploring,</p>
<p>what about being?</p>
<p>My guess is that the best scientists will do both</p>
<p>and that the act of being will be a place</p>
<p>where they get many of their ideas</p>
<p>and that they then pull into the conceptual realm.</p>
<p>And I think many of the best scientists,</p>
<p>like Einstein comes to mind, right?</p>
<p>Where these guys say, look,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come up with these ideas by a conceptual analysis.</p>
<p>I was thinking in vague images</p>
<p>and it was just something nonconceptual.</p>
<p>And then it took me a long, long time</p>
<p>to pull it out into concepts</p>
<p>and then longer to put it into math.</p>
<p>But the real insights didn&rsquo;t come from data.</p>
<p>The real insights didn&rsquo;t come from just slavishly</p>
<p>playing with equations.</p>
<p>They came from a deeper place.</p>
<p>And so there may be this going back and forth</p>
<p>between the complete nonconceptual</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s essentially no end to the wisdom</p>
<p>and then conceptual systems</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s the girdle limits that we have to that.</p>
<p>And that may be, if consciousness is important</p>
<p>and fundamental, that may be what consciousness,</p>
<p>at least part of what consciousness is about</p>
<p>is this discovering itself, discovering its possibilities,</p>
<p>so to speak, and we can talk about what that might mean,</p>
<p>by going from the nonconceptual to the conceptual</p>
<p>and back and forth.</p>
<p>So you get better and better and better at being.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let me ask you just to linger on the evolutionary,</p>
<p>because you mentioned evolutionary game theory</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really where you,</p>
<p>the perspective from which you come</p>
<p>to form the case against reality.</p>
<p>At which point in our evolutionary history</p>
<p>do we start to deviate the most from reality?</p>
<p>Is it way before life even originated on Earth?</p>
<p>Is it in the early development from bacteria and so on?</p>
<p>Or is it when some inklings of what we think of</p>
<p>as intelligence or maybe even complex consciousness</p>
<p>started to emerge?</p>
<p>So where did this deviation,</p>
<p>just like with the interfaces in a computer,</p>
<p>you start with transistors and then you have assembly</p>
<p>and then you have C, C++, then you have Python,</p>
<p>then you have GUIs, all that kind,</p>
<p>you have layers upon layers.</p>
<p>When did we start to deviate?</p>
<p>Well, David Marr, again, my advisor at MIT,</p>
<p>in his book, Vision,</p>
<p>suggested that the more primitive sensory systems</p>
<p>were less realistic, less theoretical,</p>
<p>but that by the time you got to something</p>
<p>as complicated as the humans,</p>
<p>we were actually estimating the true shapes</p>
<p>and distances to objects and so forth.</p>
<p>So his point of view, and I think it was probably,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an uncommon view among my colleagues</p>
<p>that, yeah, the sensory systems of lower creatures</p>
<p>may just not be complicated enough</p>
<p>to give them much, much truth.</p>
<p>But as you get to 86 million neurons,</p>
<p>you can now compute the truth,</p>
<p>or at least the parts of the truth that we need.</p>
<p>When I look at evolutionary game theory,</p>
<p>one of my graduate students, Justin Mark,</p>
<p>did some simulations using genetic algorithms.</p>
<p>So there he was just exploring,</p>
<p>we start off with random organisms,</p>
<p>random sensory genetics and random actions.</p>
<p>And the first generation was unbelievably,</p>
<p>it was a foraging situation.</p>
<p>They were foraging for resources.</p>
<p>Most of them stayed in one place,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do anything important.</p>
<p>But we could then just look at how the genes evolved.</p>
<p>And what we found was,</p>
<p>what he found was that basically you never even saw</p>
<p>the truth organisms even come on the stage.</p>
<p>If they came up, they were gone in one generation,</p>
<p>they just weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So they came and went even just in one generation.</p>
<p>They just are not good enough.</p>
<p>The ones that were just tracking,</p>
<p>their senses just were tracking the fitness payoffs</p>
<p>were far more fit than the truth seekers.</p>
<p>So an answer at one level,</p>
<p>I want to give an answer at a deeper level,</p>
<p>but just with evolutionary game theory,</p>
<p>because my attitude as a scientist is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe any of our theories.</p>
<p>I take them very, very seriously.</p>
<p>I study them, I look at their implications,</p>
<p>but none of them are the gospel.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just the latest ideas that we have.</p>
<p>And so the reason I study evolutionary game theory</p>
<p>is because that&rsquo;s the best tool we have right now</p>
<p>in this area.</p>
<p>There is nothing else that competes.</p>
<p>And so as a scientist, it&rsquo;s my responsibility</p>
<p>to take the best tools and see what they mean.</p>
<p>And the same thing the physicists are doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking the best tools</p>
<p>and looking at what they entail.</p>
<p>But I think that science now has enough experience</p>
<p>to realize that we should not believe our theories</p>
<p>in the sense that we&rsquo;ve now arrived.</p>
<p>In 1890, a lot of physicists thought we&rsquo;d arrived.</p>
<p>They were discouraging bright young students</p>
<p>from going into physics, because it was all done.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely the wrong attitude forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the wrong attitude forever.</p>
<p>The attitude we should have is a century from now,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be looking at us and laughing</p>
<p>at what we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And we just have to assume that that&rsquo;s going to be the case.</p>
<p>Just know that everything that we think</p>
<p>is so brilliant right now, our final theory.</p>
<p>A century from now, they&rsquo;ll look at us</p>
<p>like we look at the physicists of 1890 and go,</p>
<p>how could they have been so dumb?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to make that mistake.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not doctrinaire about any</p>
<p>of our current scientific theories.</p>
<p>I am doctrinaire about this.</p>
<p>We should use the best tools we have right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p>And with humility.</p>
<p>Well, so let me ask you about game theory.</p>
<p>I love game theory, evolutionary game theory.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m always suspicious of it, like economics.</p>
<p>When you construct models,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too easy to construct things that oversimplify</p>
<p>just because we, our human brains,</p>
<p>enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables</p>
<p>that somehow represent organisms or represent people</p>
<p>and running a simulation that then allows you</p>
<p>to build up intuition and then it feels really good</p>
<p>because you can get some really deep</p>
<p>and surprising intuitions.</p>
<p>But how do you know your models aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the assumptions underlying your models</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t some fundamentally flawed?</p>
<p>And because of that,</p>
<p>your conclusions are fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>So I guess my question is what are the limits</p>
<p>in your use of game theory, evolution game theory,</p>
<p>your experience with it?</p>
<p>What are the limits of game theory?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve gotten some pushback from professional colleagues</p>
<p>and friends who have tried to rerun simulations</p>
<p>and try to, the idea that we don&rsquo;t see the truth</p>
<p>is not comfortable and so many of my colleagues</p>
<p>are very interested in trying to show that we&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And so the idea would be to say that somehow</p>
<p>we did something, as you&rsquo;re suggesting,</p>
<p>maybe something special that wasn&rsquo;t completely general.</p>
<p>We got some little special part of the whole search space</p>
<p>in evolutionary game theory in which this happens to be true</p>
<p>but more generally organisms would evolve</p>
<p>to see the truth.</p>
<p>So the best pushback we&rsquo;ve gotten is from a team at Yale.</p>
<p>And they suggested that if you use</p>
<p>thousands of payoff functions,</p>
<p>so we in our simulations, we just use a couple,</p>
<p>one or two, because it was our first simulations, right?</p>
<p>So that would be a limit.</p>
<p>We had one or two payoff functions,</p>
<p>we showed the result of those,</p>
<p>at least for the genetic algorithms.</p>
<p>And they said, if you have 20,000 of them,</p>
<p>then we can find these conditions in which</p>
<p>truth seeing organisms would be the ones</p>
<p>that evolved and survived.</p>
<p>And so we looked at their simulations</p>
<p>and it certainly is the case that you can find</p>
<p>special cases in which truth can evolve.</p>
<p>So when I say it&rsquo;s probability zero,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>It can happen, in fact, it could happen infinitely often.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just probability zero.</p>
<p>So probability zero things can happen infinitely often.</p>
<p>When you say probability is zero, you mean probability</p>
<p>close to zero.</p>
<p>To be very, very precise.</p>
<p>So for example, if I have a unit square on the plane</p>
<p>and I use a measure on a probability measure</p>
<p>in which the area of a region is this probability.</p>
<p>Then if I draw a curve in that unit square,</p>
<p>it has measure precisely zero,</p>
<p>precisely not approximately, precisely zero.</p>
<p>And yet it has infinitely many points.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an object that for that probability measure</p>
<p>has probability zero, and yet there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>infinitely many points in it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean when I say that things</p>
<p>that are probability zero can happen</p>
<p>infinitely often in principle.</p>
<p>Yeah, but infinity, as far as, and I look outside often,</p>
<p>I walk around and I look at people.</p>
<p>I have never seen infinity in real life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking, I&rsquo;ve been looking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t notice it, infinitely small or the infinitely big.</p>
<p>And so the tools of mathematics,</p>
<p>you could sort of apply the same kind of criticism</p>
<p>that it is a very convenient interface into our reality.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big debate in mathematics,</p>
<p>the intuitionists versus the ones who take,</p>
<p>for example, the real numbers as real.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fun discussion.</p>
<p>Nicholas Giesen, a physicist,</p>
<p>has really interesting work recently</p>
<p>on how if you go with intuitionist mathematics,</p>
<p>you could effectively quantize Newton,</p>
<p>and you find that the Newtonian theory</p>
<p>and quantum theory aren&rsquo;t that different</p>
<p>once you go with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really quite interesting.</p>
<p>So the issue he raises is a very, very deep one,</p>
<p>and one that I think we should take quite seriously,</p>
<p>which is how should we think about the reality</p>
<p>of the contours hierarchy?</p>
<p>Aleph one, aleph two, and all these different infinities</p>
<p>versus just a more algorithmic approach, right?</p>
<p>So where everything&rsquo;s computable,</p>
<p>in some sense, everything&rsquo;s finite,</p>
<p>as big as you want, but nevertheless finite.</p>
<p>So yeah, that ultimately boils down to</p>
<p>whether the world is discrete or continuous</p>
<p>in some general sense.</p>
<p>And again, we can&rsquo;t really know,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just a mind breaking thought,</p>
<p>just common sense reasoning,</p>
<p>that something can happen,</p>
<p>and as yet, probability of it happening is 0%.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t compute for common sense computer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is where you have to be a sharp mathematician</p>
<p>to really, and I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Sharp is one word.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is common sense computer is,</p>
<p>I mean that in a very kind of,</p>
<p>in a positive sense,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve been talking about perception systems</p>
<p>and interfaces, if we are to reason about the world,</p>
<p>we have to use the best interfaces we got.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not exactly sure that game theory</p>
<p>is the best interface we got for this.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>In application of mathematics, tricks and tools</p>
<p>in mathematics, the game theory is the best we got</p>
<p>when we are thinking about the nature of reality</p>
<p>and fitness functions and evolution, period.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a fair rejoinder,</p>
<p>and I think that that was the tool that we used.</p>
<p>And if someone says, here&rsquo;s a better mathematical tool</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s why, this mathematical tool</p>
<p>better captures the essence of Darwin&rsquo;s idea,</p>
<p>John Maynard Smith didn&rsquo;t quite get it</p>
<p>with evolutionary game theory.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this thing.</p>
<p>Now there are tools like evolutionary graph theory,</p>
<p>which generalize evolutionary game theory,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s quantum game theory.</p>
<p>So you can use quantum tools like entanglement,</p>
<p>for example, as a resource in games</p>
<p>that change the very nature of the solutions,</p>
<p>the optimal solutions of the game theory.</p>
<p>Well, the work from Yale is really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really interesting challenge of these ideas</p>
<p>where, okay, if you have a very large number</p>
<p>of fitness functions, or let&rsquo;s say you have</p>
<p>a nearly infinite number of fitness functions</p>
<p>or a growing number of fitness functions,</p>
<p>what kind of interesting things start to emerging</p>
<p>if you are to be an organism?</p>
<p>If to be an organism that adapts means</p>
<p>having to deal with an ensemble of fitness functions.</p>
<p>Right, and so we&rsquo;ve actually redone some of our own work</p>
<p>based on theirs, and this is the back and forth</p>
<p>that we expect in science, right?</p>
<p>And what we found was that in their simulations,</p>
<p>they were assuming that you couldn&rsquo;t carve the world</p>
<p>up into objects, and so we said,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s relax that assumption.</p>
<p>Allow organisms to create data structures</p>
<p>that we might call objects,</p>
<p>and an object would be you take,</p>
<p>you would do hierarchical clustering</p>
<p>of your fitness payoff functions,</p>
<p>the ones that have similar shapes.</p>
<p>If you have 20,000 of them, maybe these 50</p>
<p>are all very, very similar,</p>
<p>so I can take all the perception, action, fitness stuff</p>
<p>and make that into a data structure,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll call that a unit or an object.</p>
<p>And as soon as we did that,</p>
<p>then all of their results went away.</p>
<p>It turned out they were the special case</p>
<p>and that the organisms that were allowed</p>
<p>to only see, that were shaped to see only fitness payoffs</p>
<p>were the ones that were.</p>
<p>So the idea is that objects then,</p>
<p>what are objects from an evolutionary point of view?</p>
<p>This bottle, we thought that when I saw a bottle,</p>
<p>it was because I was seeing a true object</p>
<p>that existed whether or not it was perceived.</p>
<p>Evolutionary theories suggest a different interpretation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a data structure that is encoding</p>
<p>a convenient way of looking at various fitness payoffs.</p>
<p>I can use this for drinking.</p>
<p>I could use it as a weapon, not a very good one.</p>
<p>I could be somewhere with head with it.</p>
<p>If my goal is mating, this is pointless.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m seeing for, what I&rsquo;m coding here</p>
<p>is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get.</p>
<p>When I pick up an apple,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m getting a different set of actions and payoffs.</p>
<p>When I pick up a rock, I&rsquo;m getting, so for every object,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m getting is a different set of payoff functions</p>
<p>and with various actions.</p>
<p>And so once you allow that,</p>
<p>then what you find is once again that truth goes extinct</p>
<p>and the organisms that just get an interface</p>
<p>are the ones that win.</p>
<p>But the question, just sneaking up on, this is fascinating.</p>
<p>From where do fitness functions originate?</p>
<p>What gives birth to the fitness functions?</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a giant black box</p>
<p>that just keeps giving you fitness functions,</p>
<p>what are we trying to optimize?</p>
<p>You said that water has different uses than an apple.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these objects.</p>
<p>What are we trying to optimize?</p>
<p>And why is not reality a really good generator</p>
<p>of fitness functions?</p>
<p>So each theory makes its own assumptions and says,</p>
<p>grant me this, then I&rsquo;ll explain that.</p>
<p>So evolutionary game theory says,</p>
<p>grant me fitness payoffs, right?</p>
<p>And grant me strategies with payoffs.</p>
<p>And I can write down the matrix</p>
<p>for this strategy interacts with that strategy.</p>
<p>These are the payoffs that come up.</p>
<p>If you grant me that,</p>
<p>then I can start to explain a lot of things.</p>
<p>Now you can ask for a deeper question like,</p>
<p>okay, how does physics evolve biology</p>
<p>and where do these fitness payoffs come from, right?</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a completely different enterprise.</p>
<p>And of course, evolutionary game theory then</p>
<p>would be not the right tool for that.</p>
<p>It would have to be a deeper tool</p>
<p>that shows where evolutionary game theory comes from.</p>
<p>My own take is that there&rsquo;s gonna be a problem</p>
<p>in doing that because space time isn&rsquo;t fundamental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a user interface.</p>
<p>And that the distinction that we make</p>
<p>between living and nonliving</p>
<p>is not a fundamental distinction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an artifact of the limits of our interface, right?</p>
<p>So this is a new wrinkle and this is an important wrinkle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so nice to take space and time as fundamental</p>
<p>because if something looks like it&rsquo;s inanimate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s inanimate and we can just say it&rsquo;s not living.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s much more complicated.</p>
<p>Certain things are obviously living.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking with you, I&rsquo;m obviously interacting</p>
<p>with something that&rsquo;s alive and conscious.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve let go of the word obviously</p>
<p>in this conversation.</p>
<p>I think nothing is obvious.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s obvious, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But when we get down to like an ant,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obviously living, but I&rsquo;ll say it appears to be living.</p>
<p>But when we get down to a virus, now people wonder</p>
<p>and when we get down to protons,</p>
<p>people say it&rsquo;s not living.</p>
<p>And my attitude is look, I have a user interface.</p>
<p>Interface is there to hide certain aspects of reality</p>
<p>and others to, it&rsquo;s an uneven representation,</p>
<p>put it that way.</p>
<p>Certain things just get completely hidden.</p>
<p>Dark matter and dark energy are most of the energy</p>
<p>and matter that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Our interface just plain flat out hides them.</p>
<p>The only way we get some hint is because</p>
<p>gravitational things are going wrong within our,</p>
<p>so most things are outside of our interface.</p>
<p>The distinction between living and nonliving</p>
<p>is not fundamental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an artifact of our interface.</p>
<p>So if we really, really want to understand</p>
<p>where evolution comes from,</p>
<p>to answer the question, the deep question you asked,</p>
<p>I think the right way we&rsquo;re gonna have to do that</p>
<p>is to come up with a deeper theory than space time</p>
<p>in which there may not be the notion of time</p>
<p>and show that whatever this dynamics of that deeper theory</p>
<p>is, by the way, I&rsquo;ll talk about how you could have dynamics</p>
<p>without time, but the dynamics of this deeper theory,</p>
<p>when we project it into, in certain ways,</p>
<p>then we do get space time and we get what appears</p>
<p>to be evolution by natural selection.</p>
<p>So I would love to see evolution by natural selection,</p>
<p>nature, red and tooth and claw, people fighting,</p>
<p>animals fighting for resources and the whole bit,</p>
<p>come out of a deeper theory in which perhaps</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all cooperation, there&rsquo;s no limited resources</p>
<p>and so forth, but as a result of projection,</p>
<p>you get space and time, and as a result of projection,</p>
<p>you get nature, red and tooth and claw,</p>
<p>the appearance of it, but it&rsquo;s all an artifact</p>
<p>of the interface.</p>
<p>I like this idea that the line between living</p>
<p>and nonliving is very important</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the thing that would emerge</p>
<p>before you have evolution, the idea of death.</p>
<p>So that seems to be an important component</p>
<p>of natural selection, and if that emerged,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s also asking the question,</p>
<p>I guess, that I ask, where do fitness functions come from?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like asking the old meaning of life question, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the why, why, why?</p>
<p>And one of the big underlying whys,</p>
<p>okay, you can start with evolution on Earth,</p>
<p>but without living, without life and death,</p>
<p>without the line between the living and the dead,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have evolution.</p>
<p>So what if underneath it, there&rsquo;s no such thing</p>
<p>as the living and the dead?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, like this concept of an organism, period.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a living organism that&rsquo;s defined</p>
<p>by a volume in space time that somehow interacts,</p>
<p>that over time maintains its integrity somehow.</p>
<p>It has some kind of history, it has a wall of some kind.</p>
<p>The outside world, the environment,</p>
<p>and then inside, there&rsquo;s an organism.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re defining an organism,</p>
<p>and also you define that organism</p>
<p>by the fact that it can move, and it can become alive,</p>
<p>which you kind of think of as moving,</p>
<p>combined with the fact that it&rsquo;s keeping itself</p>
<p>separate from the environment,</p>
<p>so you can point out that thing is living,</p>
<p>and then it can also die.</p>
<p>That seems to be all very powerful components of space time</p>
<p>that enable you to have something</p>
<p>like natural selection and evolution.</p>
<p>Well, and there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting work,</p>
<p>some of it by collaborators of Carl Friston and others,</p>
<p>where they have Bayes net kind of stuff</p>
<p>that they build on the notion of a Markov blanket.</p>
<p>So you have some states within this network</p>
<p>that are inside the blanket, then you have the blanket,</p>
<p>and then the states outside the blanket.</p>
<p>And the states inside this Markov blanket</p>
<p>are conditionally independent of the states</p>
<p>outside the blanket conditioned on the blanket.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re looking at is that the dynamics inside</p>
<p>of the states inside the Markov blanket</p>
<p>seem to be trying to estimate properties of the outside</p>
<p>and react to them in a way.</p>
<p>So it seems like you&rsquo;re doing probabilistic inferences</p>
<p>in ways that might be able to keep you alive.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s interesting work going on in that direction.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is something slightly different,</p>
<p>and that is, like, when I look at you,</p>
<p>all I see is skin, hair, and eyes, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I see.</p>
<p>But I know that there&rsquo;s a deeper reality.</p>
<p>I believe that there&rsquo;s a much deeper reality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the whole world of your experiences,</p>
<p>your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams.</p>
<p>In some sense, the face that I see</p>
<p>is just a symbol that I create, right?</p>
<p>And as soon as I look away, I delete that symbol.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t delete you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t delete the conscious experience,</p>
<p>the whole world of your&hellip;</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m only deleting an interface symbol.</p>
<p>But that interface symbol is a portal, so to speak.</p>
<p>Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal</p>
<p>into your beliefs, into your conscious experiences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we can have a conversation.</p>
<p>Your consciousness is genuinely affecting mine,</p>
<p>and mine is genuinely affecting yours,</p>
<p>through these icons, which I create on the fly.</p>
<p>I mean, I create your face.</p>
<p>When I look, I delete it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t create you, your consciousness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s there all the time, but I do&hellip;</p>
<p>So now, when I look at a cat,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m creating something that I still call living,</p>
<p>and I still think is conscious.</p>
<p>When I look at an ant, I create something</p>
<p>that I still would call living, but maybe not conscious.</p>
<p>When I look at something I call a virus,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m not even sure I would call it living.</p>
<p>And when I look at a proton, I would say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s not alive at all.</p>
<p>It could be that I&rsquo;m nevertheless interacting</p>
<p>with something that&rsquo;s just as conscious as you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the proton is conscious.</p>
<p>The face that I&rsquo;m creating when I look at you,</p>
<p>that face is not conscious.</p>
<p>That face is a data structure in me.</p>
<p>That face is an experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an experiencer.</p>
<p>Similarly, a proton is something that I create</p>
<p>when I look or do a collision</p>
<p>in the Large Hadron Collider or something like that.</p>
<p>But what is behind the entity in space time?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got this space time interface,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve just got this entity that I call a proton.</p>
<p>What is the reality behind it?</p>
<p>Well, the physicists are finding these big, big structures.</p>
<p>The amplitude hadron, the sociahedron,</p>
<p>cause what&rsquo;s behind those?</p>
<p>Could be consciousness, what I&rsquo;m playing with.</p>
<p>In which case, when I&rsquo;m interacting with a proton,</p>
<p>I could be interacting with consciousness.</p>
<p>Again, to be very, very clear,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy to misunderstand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying a proton is conscious.</p>
<p>Just like I&rsquo;m not saying your face is conscious.</p>
<p>Your face is a symbol I create and then delete as I look.</p>
<p>So your face is not conscious,</p>
<p>but I know that that face in my interface,</p>
<p>the Lex Friedman face that I create,</p>
<p>is an interface symbol that&rsquo;s a genuine portal</p>
<p>into your consciousness.</p>
<p>The portal is less clear for a cat,</p>
<p>even less clear for an ant.</p>
<p>And by the time we get down to a proton,</p>
<p>the portal is not clear at all.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not interacting</p>
<p>with consciousness, it just means my interface gave up.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some deeper reality that we have to go after.</p>
<p>So your question really forces out a big part</p>
<p>of this whole approach that I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this portal and consciousness.</p>
<p>I wonder why you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>your portal is not as good to a cat,</p>
<p>to a cat&rsquo;s consciousness than it is to a human.</p>
<p>Does it have to do with the fact that you&rsquo;re human</p>
<p>and just similar organisms, organisms of similar complexity</p>
<p>are able to create portals better to each other?</p>
<p>Or is it just as you get more and more complex,</p>
<p>you get better and better portals?</p>
<p>Well, let me answer one aspect of it</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m more confident about,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll speculate on that.</p>
<p>Why is it that the portal is so bad with protons?</p>
<p>Well, and elementary particles more generally.</p>
<p>So quarks, leptons and gluons and so forth.</p>
<p>Well, the reason for that is because those are just</p>
<p>symmetries of space time.</p>
<p>More technically, they&rsquo;re irreducible representations</p>
<p>of the Poincare group of space time.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just literally representations</p>
<p>of the data structure of space time that we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re not very much insightful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just almost entirely tied</p>
<p>to the data structure itself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re telling you only something about the data structure,</p>
<p>not behind the data structure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when we get to higher levels</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re starting to, in some sense,</p>
<p>build portals to what&rsquo;s behind space time.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s more and more complexity built</p>
<p>on top of the interface of space time with the cat.</p>
<p>So you can actually build a portal, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, this interface of face and hair and so on, skin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some syncing going on between humans though,</p>
<p>where we synced, like you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>a pretty good representation of the ideas in my head</p>
<p>and starting to get a foggy view of my memories in my head.</p>
<p>Even though this is the first time we&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>you start to project your own memories.</p>
<p>You start to solve like a giant hierarchy of puzzles</p>
<p>about a human, because we&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of similarities, a lot of it rhymes.</p>
<p>So you start to make a lot of inferences</p>
<p>and you build up this model of a person.</p>
<p>You have a pretty sophisticated model</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on underneath.</p>
<p>Again, I just, I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to construct these models about each other</p>
<p>and nevertheless be very distant from an underlying reality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work on this.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some interesting work called signaling games</p>
<p>where they look at how people can coordinate</p>
<p>and come to communicate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting work that was done</p>
<p>by some colleagues and friends of mine,</p>
<p>Louis Narens, Natalia Komarova, and Kimberly Jamieson,</p>
<p>where they were looking at evolving color words.</p>
<p>So you have a circle of colors, the color circle,</p>
<p>and they wanted to see if they could get people to cooperate</p>
<p>and how they carved the color circle up into a circle.</p>
<p>Two units of words.</p>
<p>And so they had a game theoretic kind of thing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d had people do.</p>
<p>And what they found was that when they included,</p>
<p>so most people are trichromats,</p>
<p>you have three kinds of cone photoreceptors,</p>
<p>but there are some, a lot of men,</p>
<p>7% of men are dichromats.</p>
<p>They might be missing the red cone photoreceptor.</p>
<p>They found that the dichromats had an outsized influence</p>
<p>on the final ways that the whole space of colors</p>
<p>was carved up and labels attached.</p>
<p>You needed to be able to include the dichromats</p>
<p>in the conversation.</p>
<p>And so they had a bigger influence</p>
<p>on how you made the boundaries of the language.</p>
<p>And I thought that was a really interesting kind of insight</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s going to be, again, a game,</p>
<p>perhaps a game where evolutionary or genetic algorithm</p>
<p>kind of thing that goes on in terms of learning</p>
<p>to communicate in ways that are useful.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, you can use game theory to actually explore</p>
<p>that are signaling games.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of brilliant work on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing it, but there&rsquo;s work out there.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s okay, let us tackle once more</p>
<p>and perhaps several more times</p>
<p>after the big topic of consciousness.</p>
<p>Okay, this very beautiful, powerful things</p>
<p>that perhaps is the thing that makes us human, what is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of consciousness in,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say even just the thing we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>which is the formation of this interface, any kind of ways</p>
<p>you want to kind of start talking about it.</p>
<p>Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say.</p>
<p>99% are, again, assuming that space time is fundamental,</p>
<p>particles and space time, matter is fundamental,</p>
<p>and most are reductionist.</p>
<p>And so the standard approach to consciousness</p>
<p>is to figure out what complicated systems of matter</p>
<p>with the right functional properties</p>
<p>could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the general idea, right?</p>
<p>So maybe you have to have neurons,</p>
<p>maybe only if you have neurons, but that might not be enough.</p>
<p>They have to certain kinds of complexity</p>
<p>in their organization and their dynamics,</p>
<p>certain kind of network abilities, for example.</p>
<p>So there are those who say, for example,</p>
<p>that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse</p>
<p>of quantum states of microtubules and neurons, certainly.</p>
<p>So this is Hamroff and Penrose, that&rsquo;s kind of.</p>
<p>So you start with something physical,</p>
<p>a property of quantum states of neurons,</p>
<p>of microtubules and neurons,</p>
<p>and you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse</p>
<p>of those is consciousness or conscious experiences.</p>
<p>Or integrated information theory.</p>
<p>Again, you start with something physical,</p>
<p>and if it has the right kind of functional properties,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something they call phi,</p>
<p>with the right kind of integrated information,</p>
<p>then you have consciousness.</p>
<p>Or you can be a panpsychist, Philip Goff, for example,</p>
<p>where you might say, well,</p>
<p>in addition to the particles and space and time,</p>
<p>those particles are not just matter,</p>
<p>they also could have, say, a unit of consciousness.</p>
<p>And so, but once again, you&rsquo;re taking space and time</p>
<p>and particles as fundamental,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re adding a new property to them,</p>
<p>say, consciousness, and then you have to talk about how</p>
<p>when a proton and an electron get together</p>
<p>to form hydrogen, then how those consciousnesses</p>
<p>merge to or interact to create the consciousness</p>
<p>of hydrogen and so forth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s attention schema theory,</p>
<p>which again, this is how neural network processes</p>
<p>representing to the network itself,</p>
<p>its attentional processes, that could be consciousness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s global workspace theory,</p>
<p>and neuronal global workspace theory.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many, many theories of this type.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s common to all of them is they assume</p>
<p>that space time is fundamental.</p>
<p>They assume that physical processes</p>
<p>and space time is fundamental.</p>
<p>Panpsychism adds consciousness as an additional thing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost dualist in that regard.</p>
<p>And my attitude is our best science is telling us</p>
<p>that space time is not fundamental.</p>
<p>So why is that important here?</p>
<p>Well, for centuries, deep thinkers thought of earth, air,</p>
<p>fire, and water as the fundamental elements.</p>
<p>It was a reductionist kind of idea.</p>
<p>Nothing was more elemental than those,</p>
<p>and you could sort of build everything up from those.</p>
<p>When we got the periodic table of elements,</p>
<p>we realized that, of course,</p>
<p>we want to study earth, air, fire, and water.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s combustion science for fire.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sciences for all these other things,</p>
<p>water and so forth.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna do science with these things,</p>
<p>but fundamental, no, no.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something fundamental,</p>
<p>those are the wrong building blocks.</p>
<p>Earth has many, many different kinds of elements</p>
<p>that project into the one thing that we call earth.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t understand that there&rsquo;s silicon,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s iron,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s all these different kinds of things</p>
<p>that project into what we call earth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hopelessly lost.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not fundamental, you&rsquo;re not gonna get there.</p>
<p>And then after the periodic table,</p>
<p>then we came up with quarks, leptons, and gluons,</p>
<p>the particles of the standard model of physics.</p>
<p>And so we actually now know</p>
<p>that if you really want to get fundamental,</p>
<p>the periodic table isn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for chemistry,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just wonderful for chemistry,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re trying to go deep fundamental,</p>
<p>what is the fundamental science?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to go to quarks, leptons,</p>
<p>and gluons and so forth.</p>
<p>Well, now we&rsquo;ve discovered space time itself is doomed.</p>
<p>Quarks, leptons, and gluons</p>
<p>are just irreducible representations</p>
<p>of the symmetries of space time.</p>
<p>So the whole framework</p>
<p>on which consciousness research is being based right now</p>
<p>is doomed.</p>
<p>And for me, these are my friends and colleagues</p>
<p>that are doing this, they&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re absolutely, they&rsquo;re brilliant.</p>
<p>I, my feeling is I&rsquo;m so sad</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re stuck with this old framework</p>
<p>because if they weren&rsquo;t stuck with earth, air, fire,</p>
<p>and water, you could actually make progress.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter how smart you are.</p>
<p>If you start with earth, air, fire, and water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get anywhere, right?</p>
<p>Can I actually just,</p>
<p>because the word doomed is so interesting,</p>
<p>let me give you some options, multiple choice quiz.</p>
<p>Is space time, we could say is reality</p>
<p>the way we perceive it doomed,</p>
<p>wrong or fake?</p>
<p>Because doomed just means it could still be right</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re now ready to go deeper.</p>
<p>It would be that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not wrong, it&rsquo;s not a complete deviation</p>
<p>from a journey toward the truth.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s like earth, air, fire, and water is not wrong.</p>
<p>There is earth, air, fire, and water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a useful framework, but it&rsquo;s not fundamental.</p>
<p>Right, well, there&rsquo;s also wrong,</p>
<p>which is they used to believe, as I recently learned,</p>
<p>that George Washington was the president,</p>
<p>the first president of the United States,</p>
<p>was bled to death for something</p>
<p>that could have been easily treated</p>
<p>because it was believed that you can get,</p>
<p>actually, I need to look into this further,</p>
<p>but I guess you get toxins out or demons out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re getting out</p>
<p>with the bleeding of a person.</p>
<p>So that ended up being wrong,</p>
<p>but widely believed as a medical tool.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also possible that our assumption of space time</p>
<p>is not just doomed, but is wrong.</p>
<p>Well, if we believe that it&rsquo;s fundamental, that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>But if we believe it&rsquo;s a useful tool, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But bleeding somebody to death</p>
<p>was believed to be a useful tool.</p>
<p>And that was wrong.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just not fundamental.</p>
<p>It was very, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s cases</p>
<p>in which bleeding somebody would work,</p>
<p>but it would be a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of cases.</p>
<p>So it could be that it&rsquo;s wrong,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a side road that&rsquo;s ultimately leading</p>
<p>to a dead end as opposed to a truck stop or something</p>
<p>that you can get off of.</p>
<p>My feeling is not the dead end kind of thing.</p>
<p>I think that what the physicists are finding</p>
<p>is that there are these structures beyond space time,</p>
<p>but they project back into space time.</p>
<p>And so space time, when they say space time is doomed,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re explicit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s doomed in the sense</p>
<p>that we thought it was fundamental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fundamental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a useful, absolutely useful and brilliant data structure,</p>
<p>but there are deeper data structures</p>
<p>like cosmological polytope and space time is not fundamental.</p>
<p>What is doomed in the sense that it&rsquo;s wrong</p>
<p>is reductionism.</p>
<p>Which is saying space time is fundamental, essentially.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>The idea that somehow being smaller in space and time</p>
<p>or space time is a fundamental nature of reality,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just wrong.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a useful heuristic</p>
<p>for thermodynamics and so forth.</p>
<p>And in several other places,</p>
<p>reductionism has been very useful,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s in some sense an artifact</p>
<p>of how we use our interface.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re saying size doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Okay, this is very important for me to write down.</p>
<p>Ultimately. Ultimately, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful for theories like thermodynamics</p>
<p>and also for understanding brain networks</p>
<p>in terms of individual neurons and neurons</p>
<p>in terms of chemical systems inside cells.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all very, very useful,</p>
<p>but the idea that we&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>to the more fundamental nature of reality, no.</p>
<p>When you get all the way down in that direction,</p>
<p>you get down to the quarks and gluons,</p>
<p>what you realize is what you&rsquo;ve gotten down to</p>
<p>is not fundamental reality,</p>
<p>just the irreducible representations of a data structure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve gotten down to.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re always stuck inside the data structure.</p>
<p>So you seem to be getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>I went from neural networks to neurons,</p>
<p>neurons to chemistry, chemistry to particles,</p>
<p>particles to quarks and gluons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting closer and closer to the real.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m getting closer and closer to the actual structure</p>
<p>of the data structure of space and time,</p>
<p>the irreducible representations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re getting closer to,</p>
<p>not to a deeper understanding of what&rsquo;s beyond space time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also refer, we&rsquo;ll return again</p>
<p>to this question of dynamics</p>
<p>because you keep saying that space time is doomed,</p>
<p>but mostly focusing on the space part of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting to see why time gets the bad cred too</p>
<p>because how do you have dynamics without time</p>
<p>is the thing I&rsquo;d love to talk to you a little bit about.</p>
<p>But let us return your brilliant whirlwind overview</p>
<p>of the different theories of consciousness</p>
<p>that are out there.</p>
<p>What is consciousness if outside of space time?</p>
<p>If we think that we want to have a model of consciousness,</p>
<p>we as scientists then have to say,</p>
<p>what do we want to write down?</p>
<p>What kind of mathematical modeling</p>
<p>are we gonna write down, right?</p>
<p>And if you think about it, there&rsquo;s lots of things</p>
<p>that you might want to write down about consciousness.</p>
<p>For all the complicated subject.</p>
<p>So most of my colleagues are saying,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s start with matter or neurons</p>
<p>and see what properties of matter</p>
<p>could create consciousness.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying that that whole thing is out.</p>
<p>Space time is doomed, that whole thing is out.</p>
<p>We need to look at consciousness qua consciousness.</p>
<p>In other words, not as something that arises</p>
<p>in space and time, but perhaps as something</p>
<p>that creates space and time as a data structure.</p>
<p>So what do we want?</p>
<p>And here again, there&rsquo;s no hard and fast rule,</p>
<p>but what you as a scientist have to do</p>
<p>is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions</p>
<p>that are gonna allow you to boot up a comprehensive theory.</p>
<p>That is the trick.</p>
<p>So what do I want?</p>
<p>So what I chose to do was to have three things.</p>
<p>I said that there are conscious experiences.</p>
<p>Feeling of headache, the smell of garlic,</p>
<p>experiencing the color red.</p>
<p>There are, those are conscious,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the primitive of the theory.</p>
<p>And the reason I want few primitives, why?</p>
<p>Because those are the miracles of the theory, right?</p>
<p>The primitives, the assumptions of the theory</p>
<p>are the things you&rsquo;re not going to explain.</p>
<p>Those are the things you assume.</p>
<p>And those experiences, you particularly mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a subjectiveness to them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing when people refer</p>
<p>to the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>is it feels like something to look at the color red, okay.</p>
<p>Exactly right, it feels like something to have a headache</p>
<p>or to feel upset to your stomach.</p>
<p>It feels like something.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m going to grant that in this theory,</p>
<p>there are experiences and they&rsquo;re fundamental in some sense.</p>
<p>So conscious experience.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not derived from physics.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not functional properties of particles.</p>
<p>They are sui generis, they exist.</p>
<p>Just like we assume space time exists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now saying space time is just a data structure.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t exist independent of conscious experiences.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt once again,</p>
<p>but should we be focusing in your thinking on humans alone?</p>
<p>Or is there something about in relation</p>
<p>to other kinds of organisms that have</p>
<p>a sufficiently high level of complexity?</p>
<p>Or even, or is there some kind of generalization</p>
<p>of the panpsychist idea that all consciousness permeates,</p>
<p>all matter?</p>
<p>Outside of the usual definition</p>
<p>of what matter is inside space time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s beyond human consciousness.</p>
<p>Human consciousness, from my point of view,</p>
<p>would be one of a countless variety of consciousnesses.</p>
<p>And even within human consciousness,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s countless variety of consciousnesses within us.</p>
<p>I mean, you have your left and right hemisphere.</p>
<p>And apparently if you split the corpus callosum,</p>
<p>the personality of the left hemisphere</p>
<p>and the religious beliefs of the left hemisphere</p>
<p>can be very different from the right hemisphere.</p>
<p>And their conscious experiences can be disjoint.</p>
<p>One could have one conscious experience.</p>
<p>They can play 20 questions.</p>
<p>The left hemisphere can have an idea in its mind</p>
<p>and the right hemisphere has to guess.</p>
<p>And it might not get it.</p>
<p>So even within you,</p>
<p>there is more than just one consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lots of consciousnesses.</p>
<p>So the general theory of consciousness that I&rsquo;m after</p>
<p>is not just human consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be just consciousness.</p>
<p>And I presume human consciousness is a tiny drop</p>
<p>in the bucket of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.</p>
<p>That said, I should clarify that the black hole</p>
<p>of consciousness is the home cat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure cats lack, is the embodiment of evil</p>
<p>and lack all capacity for consciousness or compassion.</p>
<p>So I just want to lay that on the table.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the theory I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any good evidence, but it&rsquo;s just an intuition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a shout out.</p>
<p>Sorry to distract.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first assumption.</p>
<p>The first assumption, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The second assumption is that</p>
<p>these experiences have consequences.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to say that conscious experiences</p>
<p>can trigger other conscious experiences somehow.</p>
<p>So really in some sense, there&rsquo;s two basic assumptions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some kind of causality.</p>
<p>Is there a chain of causality?</p>
<p>Does this relate to dynamics?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say there&rsquo;s a probabilistic relationship.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to be as nonspecific to begin with</p>
<p>and see where it leads me.</p>
<p>So what I can write down are probability spaces.</p>
<p>So a probability space, which contains</p>
<p>the conscious experiences that this consciousness can have.</p>
<p>So I call this a conscious agent, this technical thing.</p>
<p>Annika Harris and I&rsquo;ve talked about this</p>
<p>and she rightly cautions me that people will think</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m bringing in a notion of a self or agency</p>
<p>and so forth when I say conscious agent.</p>
<p>So I just want to say that I use the term conscious agent</p>
<p>merely as a technical term.</p>
<p>There is no notion of self in my fundamental definition</p>
<p>of a conscious agent.</p>
<p>There are only experiences and probabilistic relationships</p>
<p>of how they trigger other experiences.</p>
<p>So the agent is the generator of the conscious experience?</p>
<p>The agent is a mathematical structure</p>
<p>that includes a probability measure,</p>
<p>the probability space of a possible conscious experiences</p>
<p>and a Markovian kernel, which describes how</p>
<p>if this agent has certain conscious experiences,</p>
<p>how that will affect the experiences</p>
<p>of other conscious agents, including itself.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think of that as a self?</p>
<p>No, there is no notion of a self here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no notion of really of an agent.</p>
<p>But is there a locality?</p>
<p>Is there an organism?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no space.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no.</p>
<p>So this is, these are conscious units, conscious entities.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re distinct in some way</p>
<p>because they have to interact.</p>
<p>Well, so here&rsquo;s the interesting thing.</p>
<p>When we write down the mathematics,</p>
<p>when you have two of these conscious agents interacting,</p>
<p>the pair satisfy a definition of a conscious agent.</p>
<p>So they are a single conscious agent.</p>
<p>So there is one conscious agent.</p>
<p>But it has a nice analytic decomposition</p>
<p>into as many conscious agents as you wish.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a nice interface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very useful scientific interface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scale free or if you like a fractal like approach</p>
<p>to it in which we can use the same unit of analysis</p>
<p>at all scales in studying consciousness.</p>
<p>But if I want to talk about,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no notion of learning, memory, problem solving,</p>
<p>intelligence, self, agency.</p>
<p>So none of that is fundamental.</p>
<p>So, and the reason I did that was</p>
<p>because I want to assume as little as possible.</p>
<p>Everything I assume is a miracle in the theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you explain, it&rsquo;s something you assume.</p>
<p>So I have to build networks of conscious agents.</p>
<p>If I want to have a notion of a self,</p>
<p>I have to build a self.</p>
<p>I have to build learning, memory, problem solving,</p>
<p>intelligence and planning, all these different things.</p>
<p>I have to build networks of conscious agents to do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a trivial theorem that networks of conscious agents</p>
<p>are computationally universal, that&rsquo;s trivial.</p>
<p>So anything that we can do with neural networks</p>
<p>or automata, you can do with networks of conscious agents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s trivial.</p>
<p>But you can also do more.</p>
<p>The events in the probability space need not be computable.</p>
<p>So the Markovian dynamics is not restricted</p>
<p>to computable functions</p>
<p>because the very events themselves need not be computable.</p>
<p>So this can capture any computable theory.</p>
<p>Anything we can do with neural networks,</p>
<p>we can do with conscious agent networks.</p>
<p>But it leaves open the door for the possibility</p>
<p>of noncomputable interactions between conscious agents.</p>
<p>So if we want a theory of memory, we have to build it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of different ways you could build.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve actually got a paper,</p>
<p>Chris Fields took the lead on this.</p>
<p>And we have a paper called Conscious Agent Networks</p>
<p>where Chris takes the lead and shows how to use</p>
<p>these networks of conscious agents to build memory</p>
<p>and to build primitive kinds of learning.</p>
<p>But can you provide some intuition</p>
<p>of what conscious networks,</p>
<p>networks of conscious agents helps you?</p>
<p>First of all, what that looks like.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t just mean mathematically.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe that might help build up intuition.</p>
<p>But how that helps us potentially solve</p>
<p>the hard problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>Or is that baked in, that that exists?</p>
<p>Can you solve the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>why it tastes delicious when you eat a delicious ice cream</p>
<p>with networks of conscious agents?</p>
<p>Or is that taken as an assumption?</p>
<p>So the standard way the hard problem is thought of</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re assuming space and time and particles</p>
<p>or neurons, for example.</p>
<p>These are just physical things that have no consciousness.</p>
<p>And we have to explain how the conscious experience</p>
<p>of the taste of chocolate could emerge from those.</p>
<p>So the typical hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>is that problem, right?</p>
<p>How do you boot up the taste of chocolate,</p>
<p>the experience of the taste of chocolate from neurons, say,</p>
<p>or the right kind of artificial intelligence circuitry?</p>
<p>How do you boot that up?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s typically what the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>means to researchers.</p>
<p>Notice that I&rsquo;m changing the problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to boot up conscious experiences</p>
<p>from the dynamics of neurons or silicon</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that that&rsquo;s the wrong problem.</p>
<p>My hard problem would go in the other direction.</p>
<p>If I start with conscious experiences,</p>
<p>how do I build up space and time?</p>
<p>How do I build up what I call the physical world?</p>
<p>How do I build up what we call brains?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m saying consciousness</p>
<p>is not something that brains do.</p>
<p>Brains are something that consciousness makes up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s among the experience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an ephemeral experience in consciousness.</p>
<p>I look inside, so to be very, very clear,</p>
<p>right now, I have no neurons.</p>
<p>If you looked, you would see neurons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a data structure that you would create on the fly,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very useful one.</p>
<p>As soon as you look away,</p>
<p>you garbage collect that data structure,</p>
<p>just like that Necker cube that I was talking about</p>
<p>on the piece of paper.</p>
<p>When you look, you see a 3D cube you created on the fly.</p>
<p>As soon as you look away, that&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>When you say you, you mean a human being scientist.</p>
<p>Right now, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>More generally, it&rsquo;ll be conscious agents,</p>
<p>because as you pointed out,</p>
<p>am I asking for a theory of consciousness</p>
<p>only about humans?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s consciousness,</p>
<p>which human consciousness is just a tiny sliver.</p>
<p>But you are saying that there is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a useful data structure.</p>
<p>How many other data structures are there?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I said you human.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s another Earth,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s another alien civilization</p>
<p>and doing these kinds of investigations,</p>
<p>would they come up with similar data structures?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>What is the space of data structures,</p>
<p>I guess is what I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental,</p>
<p>consciousness is all there is,</p>
<p>then the only thing that mathematical structure</p>
<p>can be about is possibilities of consciousness.</p>
<p>And that suggests to me</p>
<p>that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses,</p>
<p>and a vanishingly small fraction of them</p>
<p>use space time data structures</p>
<p>and the kinds of structures that we use.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an infinite variety of data structures.</p>
<p>Now, this is very similar</p>
<p>to something that Max Tegmark has said,</p>
<p>but I want to distinguish it.</p>
<p>He has this level four multiverse idea.</p>
<p>He thinks that mathematics is fundamental.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the fundamental reality.</p>
<p>And since there&rsquo;s an infinite variety of,</p>
<p>endless variety of mathematical structures,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an infinite variety of multiverses in his view.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying something similar in spirit,</p>
<p>but importantly different.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an infinite variety</p>
<p>of mathematical structures, absolutely.</p>
<p>But mathematics isn&rsquo;t the fundamental reality</p>
<p>in this framework.</p>
<p>Consciousness is,</p>
<p>and mathematics is to consciousness</p>
<p>like bones are to an organism.</p>
<p>You need the bones.</p>
<p>So mathematics is not divorced from consciousness,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the entirety of consciousness by any means.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s an infinite variety of consciousnesses</p>
<p>and signaling games that consciousnesses could interact via.</p>
<p>And therefore worlds, your common worlds,</p>
<p>data structures that they can use to communicate.</p>
<p>So space and time is just one of an infinite variety.</p>
<p>And so I think that what we&rsquo;ll find is that</p>
<p>as we go outside of our little space time bubble,</p>
<p>we will encounter utterly alien forms</p>
<p>of conscious experience that we may not be able</p>
<p>to really comprehend in the following sense.</p>
<p>If I ask you to imagine a color</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve never seen before,</p>
<p>does anything happen?</p>
<p>Nothing happens.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just one color.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking for just a color.</p>
<p>We actually know, by the way,</p>
<p>that apparently there are women called tetraphams</p>
<p>who have four color receptors, not just three.</p>
<p>And Kimberly Jameson and others who&rsquo;ve studied these women</p>
<p>have good evidence that they apparently have</p>
<p>a new dimension of color experience</p>
<p>that the rest of us don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So these women are apparently living in a world of color</p>
<p>that you and I can&rsquo;t even concretely imagine.</p>
<p>No man can imagine them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And yet they&rsquo;re real color experiences.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>now take that little baby step,</p>
<p>oh, there are women who have color experiences</p>
<p>that I could never have.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s shocking.</p>
<p>Now take that infinite.</p>
<p>There are consciousnesses where every aspect</p>
<p>of their experiences is like that new color.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something utterly alien to you.</p>
<p>You have nothing like that.</p>
<p>And yet these are all possible varieties</p>
<p>of conscious experience.</p>
<p>And when you say there&rsquo;s a lot of consciousnesses,</p>
<p>as a singular consciousness,</p>
<p>basically the set of possible experiences you can have</p>
<p>in that subjective way,</p>
<p>as opposed to the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>Because you say that, you know,</p>
<p>having a extra color receptor,</p>
<p>ability to have new experiences</p>
<p>that somehow a different consciousness,</p>
<p>is there a way to see that as all the same consciousness,</p>
<p>the subjectivity itself?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because when we have two of these conscious agents</p>
<p>interacting, the mathematics,</p>
<p>they actually satisfy the definition of a conscious agent.</p>
<p>So in fact, they are a single conscious agent.</p>
<p>So in fact, one way to think about what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m postulating with my colleagues,</p>
<p>Chaiton and Chris and others,</p>
<p>Robert Pretner and so forth.</p>
<p>There is one big conscious agent, infinitely complicated.</p>
<p>But fortunately, we can, for analytic purposes,</p>
<p>break it down all the way to,</p>
<p>in some sense, the simplest conscious agent,</p>
<p>which has one conscious experience, one.</p>
<p>This one agent can experience red 35, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it experiences.</p>
<p>You can get all the way down to that.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s possible that consciousness,</p>
<p>whatever that is,</p>
<p>is much more, is fundamental,</p>
<p>or at least much more in the direction of the fundamental</p>
<p>than is space time as we perceive it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the proposal.</p>
<p>And therefore, what I have to do,</p>
<p>in terms of the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>is to show how dynamical systems of conscious agents</p>
<p>could lead to what we call space and time</p>
<p>and neurons and brain activity.</p>
<p>In other words, we have to show how you get space time</p>
<p>and physical objects entirely from a theory</p>
<p>of conscious agents outside of space time,</p>
<p>with the dynamics outside of space time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, and I can tell you how we plan to do that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<p>Okay, the magic of it, that chocolate is delicious.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a mathematical kind of thing</p>
<p>that we could say here, how it can emerge</p>
<p>within this system of networks of conscious agents,</p>
<p>but is there going to be at the end of the proof</p>
<p>why chocolate is so delicious?</p>
<p>Or no?</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m going to ask different kinds of dumb questions</p>
<p>to try to sneak up.</p>
<p>Oh, well, that&rsquo;s the right question, and when I say</p>
<p>that I took conscious experiences as fundamental,</p>
<p>what that means is, in the current version of my theory,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not explaining conscious experiences</p>
<p>where they came from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the miracle, that&rsquo;s one of the miracles.</p>
<p>So I have two miracles in my theory.</p>
<p>There are conscious experiences, like the taste of chocolate,</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a probabilistic relationship.</p>
<p>When certain conscious experiences occur,</p>
<p>others are more likely to occur.</p>
<p>Those are the two miracles that are possible.</p>
<p>Is it possible to get beyond that</p>
<p>and somehow start to chip away</p>
<p>at the miracleness of that miracle,</p>
<p>that chocolate is delicious?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got my hands full with what I&rsquo;m doing right now,</p>
<p>but I can just say at top level how I would think about that.</p>
<p>That would get at this</p>
<p>consciousness without form.</p>
<p>This is really tough, because it&rsquo;s consciousness without form</p>
<p>versus the various forms that consciousness takes</p>
<p>for the experiences that it has.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So when I write down a probability space</p>
<p>for these conscious experiences, I say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a probability space</p>
<p>for the possible conscious experiences, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like when I write down a probability space</p>
<p>for an experiment.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna flip a coin twice, right?</p>
<p>And I want to look at the probabilities of various outcomes.</p>
<p>So I have to write down a probability space.</p>
<p>There could be heads, heads, heads, tails,</p>
<p>tails, heads, tails, tails.</p>
<p>So any class of probability you&rsquo;re told,</p>
<p>write down your probability space.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t write down your probability space,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get started.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my probability space for consciousness.</p>
<p>How do I want to interpret that structure?</p>
<p>The structure is just sitting there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a dynamics that happens on it, right?</p>
<p>Experiences appear and then they disappear,</p>
<p>just like heads appears and disappears.</p>
<p>So one way to think about that fundamental</p>
<p>probability space is that corresponds</p>
<p>to consciousness without any content.</p>
<p>The infinite consciousness that transcends</p>
<p>any particular content.</p>
<p>Well, do you think of that as a mechanism,</p>
<p>as a thing, like the rules that govern the dynamics</p>
<p>of the thing outside of space time?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that, if you think consciousness is fundamental,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that essentially getting like,</p>
<p>it is solving the hard problem,</p>
<p>which is like from where does this thing pop up,</p>
<p>which is the mechanism of the thing popping up,</p>
<p>whatever the consciousness is,</p>
<p>the different kinds and so on, that mechanism.</p>
<p>And also, the question I want to ask is how tricky</p>
<p>do you think it is to solve that problem?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve solved a lot of difficult problems</p>
<p>throughout the history of humanity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably more problems to solve left</p>
<p>than we&rsquo;ve solved by like an infinity.</p>
<p>But along that long journey of intelligent species,</p>
<p>when will we solve this consciousness one?</p>
<p>Which is one way to measure the difficulty of the problem.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give two answers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one problem I think we can solve,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t solved yet.</p>
<p>And that is the reverse</p>
<p>of what my colleagues call the hard problem.</p>
<p>The problem of how do you start with conscious experiences</p>
<p>in the way that I&rsquo;ve just described them and the dynamics</p>
<p>and build up space and time and brains,</p>
<p>that I think is a tough technical problem,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in principle solvable.</p>
<p>So I think we can solve that.</p>
<p>So we would solve the hard problem,</p>
<p>not by showing how brains create consciousness,</p>
<p>but how networks of conscious agents</p>
<p>create what we call the symbols that we call brains.</p>
<p>So that I think.</p>
<p>But does that allow you to, so that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting idea.</p>
<p>Consciousness creates the brain,</p>
<p>not the brain creates consciousness.</p>
<p>But does that allow you to build the thing?</p>
<p>My guess is that it will enable unbelievable technologies.</p>
<p>Once, and I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>I think it plugs into the work</p>
<p>that the physicists are doing.</p>
<p>So this theory of consciousness will be even deeper</p>
<p>than the structures that the physicists are finding,</p>
<p>like the amplituhedron.</p>
<p>But the other answer to your question is less positive.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I think that there is no such thing</p>
<p>as a theory of everything.</p>
<p>So that I think that the theory that my team is working on,</p>
<p>this conscious agent theory, is just a 1.0 theory.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using probability spaces and Markovian curls.</p>
<p>I can easily see people now saying,</p>
<p>well, we can do better if we go to category theory.</p>
<p>And we can get a deeper, perhaps more interesting.</p>
<p>And then someone will say,</p>
<p>well, now I&rsquo;ll go to topoi theory.</p>
<p>So I imagine that there&rsquo;ll be conscious agents,</p>
<p>five, 10, 3 trillion, 0.0, but I think it will never end.</p>
<p>I think ultimately this question</p>
<p>that we sort of put our fingers on of,</p>
<p>how does the formless give birth to form,</p>
<p>to the wonderful taste of chocolate?</p>
<p>I think that we will always go deeper and deeper,</p>
<p>but we will never solve that.</p>
<p>That in some sense, that will be a primitive.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just the limits of my current imagination.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just say my imagination right now</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t peer that deep.</p>
<p>By the way, I&rsquo;m saying this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to discourage some brilliant 20 year old</p>
<p>who then later on proves me dead wrong.</p>
<p>I hope to be proven dead wrong.</p>
<p>Just like you said, essentially from now,</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;re saying now, everything you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>all your theories will be laughing stock.</p>
<p>They will respect the puzzle solving abilities</p>
<p>and how much we were able to do with so little.</p>
<p>But outside of that, you will all be just,</p>
<p>the silliness will be entertainment for a teenager.</p>
<p>Especially the silliness when we thought</p>
<p>that we were so smart and we knew it all.</p>
<p>So it would be interesting to explore your ideas</p>
<p>by contrasting, you mentioned Annika, Annika Harris,</p>
<p>you mentioned Philip Goff.</p>
<p>So outside of, if you&rsquo;re not allowed to say</p>
<p>the fundamental disagreement is the fact</p>
<p>that space time is fundamental.</p>
<p>What are interesting distinctions</p>
<p>between ideas of consciousness</p>
<p>between you and Annika, for example?</p>
<p>You guys have, you&rsquo;ve been on a podcast together,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure in private you guys</p>
<p>have some incredible conversations.</p>
<p>So where are some interesting sticking points,</p>
<p>some interesting disagreements,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say with Annika first.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;ll be a few other people.</p>
<p>Well, Annika and I just had a conversation this morning</p>
<p>where we were talking about our ideas</p>
<p>and what we discovered really in our conversation</p>
<p>was that we&rsquo;re pretty much on the same page.</p>
<p>It was really just about consciousness.</p>
<p>Our ideas about consciousness</p>
<p>are pretty much on the same page.</p>
<p>She rightly has cautioned me to,</p>
<p>when I talk about conscious agents,</p>
<p>to point out that the notion of agency</p>
<p>is not fundamental in my theory.</p>
<p>The notion of self is not fundamental</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>I can use this network of conscious agents,</p>
<p>I now use as a technical term,</p>
<p>conscious agent is a technical term</p>
<p>for that probability space with the Markovian dynamics.</p>
<p>I can use that to build models of a self</p>
<p>and to build models of agency,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not fundamental.</p>
<p>So she has really been very helpful</p>
<p>in helping me to be a little bit clear about these ideas</p>
<p>and not say things that are misleading.</p>
<p>This is the interesting thing about language, actually,</p>
<p>is that language, quite obviously,</p>
<p>is an interface to truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fascinating that individual words</p>
<p>can have so much ambiguity</p>
<p>and the specific choices of a word</p>
<p>within a particular sentence,</p>
<p>within the context of a sentence,</p>
<p>can have such a difference in meaning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite fascinating,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re talking about topics</p>
<p>like consciousness, because it&rsquo;s a very loaded term.</p>
<p>It means a lot of things to a lot of people</p>
<p>and the entire concept is shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>So a combination of the fact that it&rsquo;s a loaded term</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a lot of mystery,</p>
<p>people can just interpret it in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And so you have to be both precise</p>
<p>and help them avoid getting stuck</p>
<p>on some kind of side road of miscommunication,</p>
<p>lost in translation because you used the wrong word.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, because for a lot of people,</p>
<p>consciousness is ultimately connected to a self.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s our experience of consciousness</p>
<p>is very, it&rsquo;s connected to this ego.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, I mean, what else could it possibly be?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even, how do you begin to comprehend,</p>
<p>to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not connected to like this particular organism?</p>
<p>I have a way of thinking about this whole problem now</p>
<p>that comes out of this framework that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>So we can imagine a dynamics of consciousness,</p>
<p>not in space and time, just abstractly.</p>
<p>It could be cooperative for all we know.</p>
<p>It could be very friendly, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And you can set up a dynamics, a Markovian dynamics</p>
<p>that is so called stationary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a technical term,</p>
<p>which means that the entropy effectively is not increasing.</p>
<p>There is some entropy, but it&rsquo;s constant.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no increasing entropy.</p>
<p>And in that sense, the dynamics is timeless.</p>
<p>There is no entropic time, but it&rsquo;s a trivial theorem,</p>
<p>three line proof that if you have a stationary</p>
<p>Markovian dynamics, any projection that you make</p>
<p>of that dynamics by conditional probability.</p>
<p>And if you want, I can state a little bit more,</p>
<p>even more mathematically precisely</p>
<p>for some readers or listeners.</p>
<p>But if any projection you take by conditional probability,</p>
<p>the induced image of that Markov chain</p>
<p>will have increasing entropy.</p>
<p>You will have entropic time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be very, very precise.</p>
<p>I have a Markov chain X1, X2 through Xn</p>
<p>where Xn, n goes to infinity, right?</p>
<p>The entropy H, capital H of Xn is equal to the entropy H</p>
<p>of Xn minus one for all n.</p>
<p>So the entropy is the same.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a theorem that H of Xn,</p>
<p>say given X sub one is greater than or equal to</p>
<p>H of Xn minus one given X1.</p>
<p>Sure, where does the greater come from?</p>
<p>Because with the theorem, the three line proof,</p>
<p>H of Xn given X1 is greater than or equal to H of Xn</p>
<p>given X1 and X2 because conditioning reduces.</p>
<p>But then H of Xn minus one given X1, X2</p>
<p>is equal to H of Xn given X2,</p>
<p>Xn minus one given X2 by the Markov property.</p>
<p>And then because it&rsquo;s stationary, it&rsquo;s equal to H of X.</p>
<p>I have to write it down.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s a three line proof.</p>
<p>Sure, but the assumption of stationarity,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using a lot of terms that people won&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some kind of, some Markovian dynamics</p>
<p>is basically trying to model some kind of system</p>
<p>with some probabilities and there&rsquo;s agents</p>
<p>and they interact in some kind of way</p>
<p>and you can say something about that system</p>
<p>as it evolves stationarity.</p>
<p>So a stationary system is one that has certain properties</p>
<p>in terms of entropy, very well.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s stationary or not.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what the properties.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you have to kind of take assumptions</p>
<p>and see, okay, well, what does the system behave like</p>
<p>under these different properties?</p>
<p>The more constraints, the more assumptions you take,</p>
<p>the more interesting, powerful things you can say,</p>
<p>but sometimes they&rsquo;re limiting.</p>
<p>That said, we&rsquo;re talking about consciousness here.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How does that, you said cooperative, okay, competitive.</p>
<p>It just, I like chocolate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting here, I have a brain, I&rsquo;m wearing a suit.</p>
<p>It sure as hell feels like I&rsquo;m myself.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, what, am I tuning in?</p>
<p>Am I plugging into something?</p>
<p>Am I a projection, a simple, trivial projection</p>
<p>into space time from some much larger organism</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t possibly comprehend?</p>
<p>How the hell, you&rsquo;re saying some,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building up mathematical intuitions, fine, great.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m having an existential crisis here</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna die soon.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll die pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So I wanna figure out why chocolate&rsquo;s so delicious.</p>
<p>So help me out here.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just keep sneaking up to this.</p>
<p>Right, so the whole technical thing was to say this.</p>
<p>Even if the dynamics of consciousness is stationary</p>
<p>so that there is no entropic time,</p>
<p>any projection of it, any view of it</p>
<p>will have the artifact of entropic time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a limited resource.</p>
<p>Limited resources, so that the fundamental dynamics</p>
<p>may have no limits, limited resources whatsoever.</p>
<p>Any projection will have certainly time</p>
<p>as a limited resource</p>
<p>and probably lots of other limited resources.</p>
<p>Hence, we could get competition and evolution</p>
<p>and nature, red and tooth and claw</p>
<p>as an artifact of a deeper system</p>
<p>in which those aren&rsquo;t fundamental.</p>
<p>And in fact, I take it as something</p>
<p>that this theory must do at some point</p>
<p>is to show how networks of conscious agents,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not resource limited,</p>
<p>give rise to evolution by natural selection</p>
<p>via a projection.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand how the limited resources</p>
<p>that give rise to,</p>
<p>so first the thing gives rise to time,</p>
<p>that gives rise to limited resource,</p>
<p>that gives rise to evolution by natural selection,</p>
<p>how that has to do with the fact that chocolate&rsquo;s delicious?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not gonna do that directly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna get to this notion of self.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s gonna give you?</p>
<p>The notion of self.</p>
<p>Oh, the evolution gives you the notion of self.</p>
<p>And also of a self separate from other selves.</p>
<p>So the idea would be that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s competition, it has life and death,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So it won&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>as I said, I don&rsquo;t think that I can tell you</p>
<p>how the formless gives rise</p>
<p>to the experience of chocolate.</p>
<p>Right now, my current theory says</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the miracles I&rsquo;m assuming.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So my theory can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And the reason my theory can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>is because Hoffman&rsquo;s brain can&rsquo;t do it right now.</p>
<p>But the notion of self, yes.</p>
<p>The notion of self can be an artifact</p>
<p>of the projection of it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one conscious agent.</p>
<p>Because anytime conscious agents interact,</p>
<p>they form a new conscious agent.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one conscious agent.</p>
<p>Any projection of that one conscious agent</p>
<p>gives rise to time,</p>
<p>even if there wasn&rsquo;t any time in that one conscious agent.</p>
<p>And it gives rise, I want to,</p>
<p>now I haven&rsquo;t proven this.</p>
<p>So this is, so now this is me guessing</p>
<p>where the theory is going to go.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no paper on this yet.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m speculating.</p>
<p>My guess is I&rsquo;ll be able to show,</p>
<p>or my brighter colleagues working with me</p>
<p>will be able to show</p>
<p>that we will get evolution of a natural selection,</p>
<p>the notion of individual selves,</p>
<p>individual physical objects and so forth</p>
<p>coming out as a projection of this thing.</p>
<p>And that the self, this then will be really interesting</p>
<p>in terms of how it starts to interact</p>
<p>with certain spiritual traditions, right?</p>
<p>Where they will say that there is a notion of self</p>
<p>that needs to be let go,</p>
<p>which is this finite self</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s competing with other selves</p>
<p>to get more money and prestige and so forth.</p>
<p>That self in some sense has to die.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a deeper self,</p>
<p>which is the timeless being</p>
<p>that precludes, not precludes,</p>
<p>but precedes any particular conscious experiences,</p>
<p>the ground of all experience.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s that notion of a deep capital self.</p>
<p>But our little capital, lowercase s selves</p>
<p>could be artifacts of projection.</p>
<p>And it may be that what consciousness is doing</p>
<p>in this framework is, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s projected itself down into a self</p>
<p>that calls itself dawn</p>
<p>and a self that calls itself lax.</p>
<p>And through conversations like this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s trying to find out about itself</p>
<p>and eventually transcend the limits</p>
<p>of the dawn and lax little icons that it&rsquo;s using</p>
<p>and that little projection of itself.</p>
<p>Through this conversation,</p>
<p>somehow it&rsquo;s learning about itself.</p>
<p>So that thing dressed me up today</p>
<p>in order to understand itself.</p>
<p>And in some sense, you and I are not separate</p>
<p>from that thing and we&rsquo;re not separate from each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I have to question the fashion choices</p>
<p>on my end then.</p>
<p>All right, so you mentioned you agree</p>
<p>in terms of consciousness on a lot of things with Anika.</p>
<p>Is there somebody, friend or friendly foe</p>
<p>that you disagree with in some nuanced, interesting way</p>
<p>or some major way about consciousness,</p>
<p>about these topics of reality that you return to?</p>
<p>Often, it&rsquo;s like Christopher Hitchens</p>
<p>with Rabbi David Wolpe have had interesting conversations</p>
<p>through years that added to the complexity</p>
<p>and the beauty of their friendship.</p>
<p>Is there somebody like that that over the years</p>
<p>has been a source of disagreement with you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s strengthened your ideas?</p>
<p>Hmm, my ideas have been really shaped by several things.</p>
<p>One is the physicalist framework</p>
<p>that my scientific colleagues, almost to a person,</p>
<p>have adopted and that I adopted too.</p>
<p>And the reason I walked away from it was</p>
<p>because it became clear that we couldn&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>with unconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness.</p>
<p>Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist?</p>
<p>So a physicalist, I would say as someone</p>
<p>who takes space time and the objects within space time</p>
<p>as ontologically fundamental.</p>
<p>Right, and then reductionist is saying</p>
<p>the smaller, the more fundamental.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a methodological thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s saying within space time,</p>
<p>as you go to smaller and smaller scales in space,</p>
<p>you get deeper and deeper laws, more and more fundamental</p>
<p>laws and the reduction of temperature</p>
<p>to particle movement was an example of that.</p>
<p>But I think that the reason that worked</p>
<p>was almost an artifact of the nature of our interface.</p>
<p>That was for a long time and your colleagues,</p>
<p>including yourself, were physicalists</p>
<p>and now you broke away.</p>
<p>Broke away because I think you can&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>with unconscious ingredients and boot up consciousness.</p>
<p>And so even with Roger Penrose</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like a gray area.</p>
<p>Right, and here&rsquo;s the challenge I would put</p>
<p>to all of my friends and colleagues</p>
<p>who give one specific conscious experience</p>
<p>that you can boot up, right?</p>
<p>So if you think that it&rsquo;s integrated information</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve asked this of Giulio Tononi a couple times</p>
<p>back in the 90s and then just a couple years ago.</p>
<p>I asked Giulio, okay, so great, integrated information.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all interested in explaining</p>
<p>some specific conscious experiences.</p>
<p>So what is, you know, pick one, the taste of chocolate.</p>
<p>What is the integrated information precise structure</p>
<p>that we need for chocolate and why does that structure</p>
<p>have to be for chocolate and why is it</p>
<p>that it could not possibly be vanilla?</p>
<p>Is there any, I asked him, is there any one specific</p>
<p>conscious experience that you can account for?</p>
<p>Because notice, they&rsquo;ve set themselves the task</p>
<p>of booting up conscious experiences from physical systems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the task they&rsquo;ve set themselves.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I understand your intuition,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>just because they can&rsquo;t find a way to boot it up yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>No, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>It just means that they haven&rsquo;t done it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s principled.</p>
<p>The reason is principled,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m happy that they&rsquo;re exploring it.</p>
<p>But the fact is, the remarkable fact is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not one theory.</p>
<p>So integrated information theory,</p>
<p>orchestrated collapse of microtubules,</p>
<p>global workspace theory.</p>
<p>These are all theories of consciousness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a single theory that can give you</p>
<p>a specific conscious experience that they say,</p>
<p>here is the physical dynamics or the physical structure</p>
<p>that must be the taste of chocolate</p>
<p>or whatever one they want.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s just hard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My attitude is, okay, no one said</p>
<p>you had to start with neurons or physical systems</p>
<p>and boot up consciousness.</p>
<p>You guys are just taking that.</p>
<p>You chose that problem.</p>
<p>So since you chose that problem,</p>
<p>how much progress have you made?</p>
<p>Well, when you&rsquo;ve not been able to come up</p>
<p>with a single specific conscious experience</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve had these brilliant people</p>
<p>working on it for decades now,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not really good progress.</p>
<p>Let me ask you to play devil&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>Can you try to steel man, steel man meaning</p>
<p>argue the best possible case for reality?</p>
<p>The opposite of your book title.</p>
<p>So, or maybe just stick into consciousness.</p>
<p>Can you take the physicalist view?</p>
<p>Can you steel man the physicalist view</p>
<p>for a brief moment playing devil&rsquo;s advocate too?</p>
<p>Or steel man the person you used to be?</p>
<p>Right, right. She&rsquo;s a physicalist.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good, like saying that you might be wrong</p>
<p>right now, what would be a convincing argument for that?</p>
<p>Well, I think the argument I would give</p>
<p>that I believed was, look,</p>
<p>when you have very simple physical systems,</p>
<p>like a piece of dirt,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not much evidence of life or consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when you get really complicated physical systems</p>
<p>like that have brains and really,</p>
<p>the more complicated the brains,</p>
<p>the more it looks like there&rsquo;s consciousness</p>
<p>and the more complicated that consciousness is.</p>
<p>Surely that means that simple physical systems</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t create much consciousness or if maybe not any,</p>
<p>or maybe panpsychists,</p>
<p>they create the most elementary kinds</p>
<p>of simple conscious experiences,</p>
<p>but you need more complicated physical systems to boot up,</p>
<p>to create more complicated consciousnesses.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the intuition</p>
<p>that drives most of my colleagues.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that this concept of complexity</p>
<p>is ill defined when you ground it to space time.</p>
<p>Oh, I think it&rsquo;s well defined</p>
<p>within the framework of space time, right?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s ill defined relative to what you need</p>
<p>to actually understand consciousness</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re grounding complexity in just in space time.</p>
<p>Oh, got you, right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I&rsquo;m saying is if it were true</p>
<p>that space time was fundamental,</p>
<p>then I would have to agree</p>
<p>that if there is such a thing as consciousness,</p>
<p>given the data that we&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that somehow it&rsquo;s the complexity of the dynamics</p>
<p>or organization, the function of the physical system</p>
<p>that somehow is creating the consciousness.</p>
<p>So under those assumptions, yes,</p>
<p>but when the physicists themselves are telling us</p>
<p>that space time is not fundamental, then I can understand.</p>
<p>See, then the whole picture starts to come into focus.</p>
<p>Why, my colleagues are brilliant, right?</p>
<p>These are really smart people.</p>
<p>I mean, Francis Crick worked on this</p>
<p>for the last 20 years of his life.</p>
<p>These are not stupid people.</p>
<p>These are brilliant, brilliant people.</p>
<p>The fact that we&rsquo;ve come up</p>
<p>with not a single specific conscious experience</p>
<p>that we can explain and no hope.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one that says, oh, I&rsquo;m really close.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have it for you in a year.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s just like, there&rsquo;s this fundamental gap.</p>
<p>So much so that Steve Pinker in one of his writings says,</p>
<p>look, he likes the global workspace theory,</p>
<p>but he says the last dollop of the theory</p>
<p>in which there&rsquo;s something it&rsquo;s like to,</p>
<p>he says, we may have to just stipulate that as a brute fact.</p>
<p>Pinker is brilliant, right?</p>
<p>He understands the state of play</p>
<p>on this problem of the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>starting with physicalist assumptions</p>
<p>and then trying to put up consciousness.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve set yourself the problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting with physical stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not conscious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get the taste of chocolate out</p>
<p>as maybe some kind of function of the dynamics of that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve not been able to do that.</p>
<p>And so Pinker is saying, we may have to punt.</p>
<p>We may have to just stipulate that last bit.</p>
<p>He calls it the last dollop.</p>
<p>And just stipulate it as a bare fact of nature</p>
<p>that there is something it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Well, from my point of view as the physical,</p>
<p>the whole point, the whole promise of the physicalist</p>
<p>was we wouldn&rsquo;t have to stipulate.</p>
<p>I was gonna start with the physical stuff</p>
<p>and explain where the consciousness came from.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to stipulate consciousness,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t I just stipulate consciousness</p>
<p>and not stipulate all the physical stuff too?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m stipulating less.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, okay, I agree.</p>
<p>Which is the panpsychist perspective.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s actually what I call</p>
<p>the conscious realist perspective.</p>
<p>Consciousness.</p>
<p>Panpsychists are effectively dualists, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s physical stuff</p>
<p>that really is fundamental and then consciousness stuff.</p>
<p>So I would go with Pinker and say, look,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just stipulate the consciousness stuff,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not gonna stipulate the physical stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna actually now show how to boot up</p>
<p>the physical stuff from just the consciousness stuff.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll stipulate less.</p>
<p>Is it possible, so if you stipulate less,</p>
<p>is it possible for our limited brains to visualize reality</p>
<p>as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper?</p>
<p>Is it possible to visualize somehow?</p>
<p>With the tools of math, with the tools of computers,</p>
<p>with the tools of our mind, are we hopelessly lost?</p>
<p>You said there&rsquo;s ways to intuit what&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>using mathematics and probability</p>
<p>and sort of a Markovian dynamics, all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not visualizing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a kind of building intuition.</p>
<p>But is it possible to visualize</p>
<p>in the way we visualize so nicely in space time</p>
<p>in four dimensions, in three dimensions, sorry.</p>
<p>Well, we really are looking through a two dimensional screen</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s what we intuit to be a three dimensional world</p>
<p>and also inferring dynamic stuff, making it 4D.</p>
<p>Anyway, is it possible to visualize some pretty pictures</p>
<p>that give us a deeper sense of the truth of reality?</p>
<p>I think that we will incrementally be able to do that.</p>
<p>I think that, for example, the picture that we have</p>
<p>of electrons and photons interacting and scattering,</p>
<p>it may have not been possible</p>
<p>until Faraday did all of his experiments</p>
<p>and then Maxwell wrote down his equations.</p>
<p>And we were then sort of forced by his equations</p>
<p>to think in a new way.</p>
<p>And then when Planck in 1900,</p>
<p>desperate to try to solve the problem</p>
<p>of black body radiation,</p>
<p>what they call the ultraviolet catastrophe</p>
<p>where Newton was predicting infinite energies</p>
<p>where there weren&rsquo;t infinite energies</p>
<p>in black body radiation.</p>
<p>And he in desperation proposed packets of energy.</p>
<p>Then once you&rsquo;ve done that,</p>
<p>and then you have an Einstein come along five years later</p>
<p>and show how that explains the photoelectric effect.</p>
<p>And then eventually in 1926, you get quantum theory.</p>
<p>And then you get this whole new way of thinking</p>
<p>that was, from the Newtonian point of view,</p>
<p>completely contradictory and counterintuitive, certainly.</p>
<p>And maybe if Giesen is right, not contradictory.</p>
<p>Maybe if you use intuitionist math, they&rsquo;re not contradictory,</p>
<p>but still, certainly you wouldn&rsquo;t have gone there.</p>
<p>And so here&rsquo;s a case where the experiments</p>
<p>and then a desperate mathematical move,</p>
<p>sort of we use those as a flashlight into the deep fog.</p>
<p>And so that science may be the flashlight into the deep fog.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s still possible to visualize</p>
<p>in the, like we talk about consciousness</p>
<p>from a self perspective experience it.</p>
<p>Hold that idea in our mind,</p>
<p>the way you can experience things directly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve evolved to experience things in this 3D world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very rich experience.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re thinking mathematically,</p>
<p>you still in the end of the day have to project it down</p>
<p>to a low dimensional space to make conclusions.</p>
<p>Your conclusions will be a number or a line</p>
<p>or a plot or a visual.</p>
<p>So I wonder like how we can really touch some deep truth</p>
<p>in a subjective way, like experience it,</p>
<p>really feel the beauty of it, you know,</p>
<p>in the way that humans feel beauty.</p>
<p>Right, are we screwed?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>I think that we get little hints of it</p>
<p>from psychedelic drugs and so forth.</p>
<p>We get hints that there are certain interventions</p>
<p>that we can take on our interface.</p>
<p>I apply this chemical,</p>
<p>which is just some element of my interface</p>
<p>to this other, to a brain I ingested.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden I seem like I&rsquo;ve opened new portals</p>
<p>into conscious experiences.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s very, very suggestive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the black body radiation doing something</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t expect, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go to infinity</p>
<p>when we thought it was gonna go to infinity</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re forced to propose these quanta.</p>
<p>So once we have a theory of conscious agents</p>
<p>and this projection to space,</p>
<p>I should say, I should sketch what I think</p>
<p>that projection is.</p>
<p>But then I think we can then start</p>
<p>to ask specific questions.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re taking DMT or you&rsquo;re taking LSD</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>now that we have this deep model</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve reverse engineered space and time</p>
<p>and physical particles,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve pulled them back to this theory of conscious agents.</p>
<p>Now we can ask ourselves in this idealized future,</p>
<p>what are we doing to conscious agents</p>
<p>when we apply five MEO DMT?</p>
<p>What are we doing?</p>
<p>Are we opening a new portal, right?</p>
<p>So when I say that, I mean,</p>
<p>I have a portal into consciousness</p>
<p>that I call my body of Lex Friedman that I&rsquo;m creating.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a genuine portal, not perfect,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a genuine portal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely communicating with your consciousness.</p>
<p>And we know that we have one technology</p>
<p>for building new portals.</p>
<p>We know one technology and that is having kids.</p>
<p>Having kids is how we build new portals into consciousness.</p>
<p>It takes a long time.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate that?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh, you mean like?</p>
<p>Your son and your daughter didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>That was a portal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having contact with consciousness</p>
<p>that you never would have had before,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;ve got a son or a daughter.</p>
<p>You went through this physical process,</p>
<p>they were born, then there was all the training.</p>
<p>But is that portal yours?</p>
<p>So when you have kids, are you creating new portals</p>
<p>that are completely distinct from the portals</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve created with other consciousness?</p>
<p>Like can you elaborate on that?</p>
<p>To which degree are the consciousness of your kids</p>
<p>a part of you?</p>
<p>Well, so every person that I see,</p>
<p>that symbol that I see, the body that I see,</p>
<p>is a portal potentially for me to interact</p>
<p>with a consciousness.</p>
<p>And each consciousness has a unique character.</p>
<p>We call it a personality and so forth.</p>
<p>So with each new kid that&rsquo;s born,</p>
<p>we come in contact with a personality</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>And a version of consciousness</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>At a deeper level, as I said,</p>
<p>the theory says there&rsquo;s one agent.</p>
<p>So this is a different projection of that one agent.</p>
<p>But so that&rsquo;s what I mean by a portal</p>
<p>is within my own interface, my own projection,</p>
<p>can I see other projections of that one consciousness?</p>
<p>So can I get portals in that sense?</p>
<p>And I think we will get a theory of that,</p>
<p>that we will get a theory of portals</p>
<p>and then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting.</p>
<p>Are they actually creating new portals or not?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not, we should nevertheless then understand</p>
<p>how we could create a new portal, right?</p>
<p>Maybe we have to just study what happens</p>
<p>when we have kids.</p>
<p>We know that that technology creates new portals.</p>
<p>So we have to reverse engineer that and then say,</p>
<p>okay, could we somehow create new portals de novo?</p>
<p>With something like brain computer interfaces, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, maybe just a chemical or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably more complicated than a chemical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think that the psychedelics may,</p>
<p>because they might be affecting this portal</p>
<p>in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up.</p>
<p>In other words, maybe once we understand</p>
<p>what this thing is a portal, your body is a portal,</p>
<p>and understand all of those complexities,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll realize that that portal can be shifted</p>
<p>to different parts of the deeper consciousness</p>
<p>and can be used to create new portals.</p>
<p>And give new windows on it.</p>
<p>And so in that way, maybe yes,</p>
<p>psychedelics could open up new portals</p>
<p>in the sense that they&rsquo;re taking something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already a complex portal</p>
<p>and just tweaking it a bit.</p>
<p>Well, but creating is a very powerful difference</p>
<p>between morphing.</p>
<p>Right, right, tweaking versus creating, I agree.</p>
<p>But maybe it gives you intuition</p>
<p>to at least the full space of the kinds of things</p>
<p>that this particular system is capable of.</p>
<p>I mean, the idea of the consciousness creates brains.</p>
<p>I mean, that breaks my brain because,</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m still a physicalist in that sense</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just much easier to intuit the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s practical to think there&rsquo;s a neural network</p>
<p>and what are the different ways</p>
<p>fascinating capabilities can emerge</p>
<p>from this neural network.</p>
<p>I agree, it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
<p>And so you start to,</p>
<p>and then present to yourself the problem of,</p>
<p>okay, well, how does consciousness arise?</p>
<p>How does intelligence arise?</p>
<p>How does emotion arise?</p>
<p>How does memory arise?</p>
<p>How do we filter within the system</p>
<p>all the incoming sensory information</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to allocate attention</p>
<p>in different interesting ways?</p>
<p>How do all those mechanisms arise?</p>
<p>To say that there&rsquo;s other fundamental things</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand outside of space time</p>
<p>that are actually core to how this whole thing works</p>
<p>is a bit paralyzing because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re not 10% done, we&rsquo;re like 0.001% done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the immediate feeling.</p>
<p>Certainly understand that.</p>
<p>My attitude about it is,</p>
<p>if you look at the young physicists</p>
<p>who are searching for these structures beyond space time,</p>
<p>like amplitude and so forth,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re having a ball.</p>
<p>Space time, that&rsquo;s what the old folks did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the older generation did.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing something that really is fun and new</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re having a blast</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re finding all these new structures.</p>
<p>So I think that we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>succeed in getting a new deeper theory.</p>
<p>I can just say what I&rsquo;m hoping with the theory</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m working on, I&rsquo;m hoping to show</p>
<p>that I could have this timeless dynamics of consciousness,</p>
<p>no entropic time.</p>
<p>I take a projection and I show how this timeless dynamics</p>
<p>looks like the Big Bang</p>
<p>and the entire evolution of space time.</p>
<p>In other words, I see how my whole space time interface.</p>
<p>So not just the projection</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just look like space time,</p>
<p>you can explain the whole from the origin of the universe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have to do</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the physicists understand.</p>
<p>When they go beyond space time to the amplitude heat</p>
<p>and the cosmological polytope,</p>
<p>they ultimately know that they have to get back</p>
<p>the Big Bang story and the whole evolution,</p>
<p>that whole story where there were no living things.</p>
<p>There was just a point and then the explosion</p>
<p>and then just particles at high energy</p>
<p>and then eventually the cooling down</p>
<p>and the differentiation and finally matter condenses</p>
<p>and then life and then consciousness.</p>
<p>That whole story has to come out of something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deeper and without time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re up to.</p>
<p>So the whole story that we&rsquo;ve been telling ourselves</p>
<p>about Big Bang and how brains evolved in consciousness</p>
<p>will come out of a much deeper theory.</p>
<p>And yeah, for someone like me, it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>But for the younger generation, this is like, oh wow,</p>
<p>all the low cherries aren&rsquo;t picked.</p>
<p>This is really good stuff.</p>
<p>This is really new fundamental stuff that we can do.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t wait to read the papers of the younger generation</p>
<p>and I wanna see them.</p>
<p>Kids these days with their non space time assumptions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just interesting looking at the philosophical tradition</p>
<p>of this difficult ideas you struggle with.</p>
<p>If you look like somebody like Emmanuel Kant,</p>
<p>what are some interesting agreements and disagreements</p>
<p>you have with a guy about the nature of reality?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot in agreement, right?</p>
<p>So Kant was an idealist, transcendental idealist</p>
<p>and he basically had the idea</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t see nature as it is.</p>
<p>We impose a structure on nature.</p>
<p>And so in some sense, I&rsquo;m saying something similar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that, by the way,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t call myself an idealist.</p>
<p>I call myself a conscious realist</p>
<p>because idealism has a long history.</p>
<p>A lot of different ideas come under idealism</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of debates and so forth.</p>
<p>It tends to be identified with, in many cases,</p>
<p>anti science and anti realism.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want either connection with my ideas</p>
<p>and so I just called mine conscious realism</p>
<p>with an emphasis on realism and not anti realism.</p>
<p>But one place where I would, of course,</p>
<p>disagree with Kant was that he thought</p>
<p>that Euclidean space time was a priori, right?</p>
<p>We just know that that&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>So he went too far on that.</p>
<p>But in general, the idea that we don&rsquo;t start with space time,</p>
<p>that space and time is in some sense</p>
<p>the forms of our perceptions.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>And I would say that there&rsquo;s a lot in common</p>
<p>with Berkeley in that regard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of ingenious arguments in Berkeley.</p>
<p>Leibniz in his monodology understood very clearly</p>
<p>that the hard problem was not solvable.</p>
<p>He posed the hard problem and basically dismissed it.</p>
<p>He just said, you can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>And so if he came here and saw where we are,</p>
<p>he said, look, guys, I told you this 300 years ago.</p>
<p>And he had his monodology.</p>
<p>He was trying to do something like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different from what I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>but he had these things that were not in space and time,</p>
<p>these monads.</p>
<p>He was trying to build something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to build a theory of conscious agents.</p>
<p>My guess is that if he came here,</p>
<p>I could just, if he saw what I was doing,</p>
<p>he would say, he would understand it</p>
<p>and immediately take off with it</p>
<p>and go places that I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He would have no problem with this.</p>
<p>Right, there would be overlap of the spirit</p>
<p>of the ideas would be totally overlapping.</p>
<p>But his genius would then just run with it</p>
<p>far faster than I could.</p>
<p>I love the humility here.</p>
<p>So let me ask you about sort of practical implications</p>
<p>of your ideas to our world, our complicated world.</p>
<p>When you look at the big questions of humanity,</p>
<p>of hate, war, what else is there?</p>
<p>Evil, maybe there&rsquo;s the positive aspects of that,</p>
<p>of meaning, of love.</p>
<p>What is the fact that reality is an illusion perceived?</p>
<p>What is the conscious realism when applied to daily life?</p>
<p>What kind of impact does it have?</p>
<p>A lot, and it&rsquo;s sort of scary.</p>
<p>We all know that life is ephemeral</p>
<p>and spiritual traditions have said wake up to the fact</p>
<p>that anything that you do here is going to disappear.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s even more ephemeral than perhaps we&rsquo;ve thought.</p>
<p>I see this bottle because I create it right now.</p>
<p>As soon as I look away,</p>
<p>that data structure has been garbage collected.</p>
<p>That bottle, I have to recreate it every time I look.</p>
<p>So I spend all my money and I buy this fancy car.</p>
<p>That car, I have to keep recreating it</p>
<p>every time I look at it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that ephemeral.</p>
<p>So all the things that we invest ourselves in,</p>
<p>we fight over, we kill each other over,</p>
<p>we have wars over, these are all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like people in a virtual reality simulation, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this Porsche and we all see the Porsche.</p>
<p>Well, that Porsche exists when I look at it.</p>
<p>I turn my headset and I look at it.</p>
<p>And then if Joe turns his headset the right way,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll see his Porsche.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even the same Porsche that I see.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s creating his own Porsche.</p>
<p>So these things are exceedingly ephemeral.</p>
<p>And now just imagine saying that that&rsquo;s my Porsche.</p>
<p>Well, you can agree to say that it&rsquo;s your Porsche,</p>
<p>but really the Porsche only exists as long as you look.</p>
<p>So this all of a sudden,</p>
<p>what the spiritual traditions have been saying</p>
<p>for a long, long time,</p>
<p>this gets cashed out in mathematically precise science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s saying ephemeral, yes.</p>
<p>In fact, it lasts for a few milliseconds,</p>
<p>a few hundred milliseconds while you look at it.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>So the whole idea, why are we fighting?</p>
<p>Why do we hate?</p>
<p>We fight over possessions</p>
<p>because we think that we&rsquo;re small little objects</p>
<p>inside this preexisting space time.</p>
<p>We assume that that mansion and that car</p>
<p>exists independent of us.</p>
<p>And that somehow we, these little things</p>
<p>can have our sense of self and importance</p>
<p>enhanced by having that special car</p>
<p>or that special house or that special person.</p>
<p>When in fact, it&rsquo;s just the opposite.</p>
<p>You create that mansion every time you look.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re something far deeper than that mansion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the entity which can create that mansion on the fly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing to the mansion</p>
<p>except what you create in this moment.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden, when you take this point of view,</p>
<p>it has all sorts of implications</p>
<p>for how we interact with each other,</p>
<p>how we treat each other.</p>
<p>And again, a lot of things</p>
<p>that spiritual traditions have said, it&rsquo;s a mixed bag.</p>
<p>Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag.</p>
<p>So let me just be right up front about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not promoting any particular,</p>
<p>but they do have some insights.</p>
<p>Yeah, they have wisdom.</p>
<p>They have certain wisdom.</p>
<p>They have, I can point to nonsense.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into it,</p>
<p>but I can also point to lots of nonsense.</p>
<p>So the issue is to then to look for the key insights.</p>
<p>And I think they have a lot of insights</p>
<p>about the ephemeral nature of objects in space and time</p>
<p>and not being attached to them, including our own bodies.</p>
<p>And reversing that I&rsquo;m not this little thing,</p>
<p>a little consciousness trapped in the body.</p>
<p>And the consciousness itself is only a product of the body.</p>
<p>So when the body dies, the consciousness disappears.</p>
<p>It turns completely around.</p>
<p>The consciousness is fundamental.</p>
<p>The body, my hand exists right now</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m looking at it.</p>
<p>My hand is gone.</p>
<p>I have no hand.</p>
<p>I have no brain.</p>
<p>I have no heart.</p>
<p>If you looked, you&rsquo;ll see a heart.</p>
<p>Whatever I am is this really complicated thing</p>
<p>in consciousness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I am.</p>
<p>All the stuff that I thought I was</p>
<p>is something that I create on the fly and delete.</p>
<p>So this is completely radical restructuring</p>
<p>of how we think about possessions, about identity,</p>
<p>about survival of death and so forth.</p>
<p>This is completely transformative.</p>
<p>But the nice thing is that this whole approach</p>
<p>of conscious agents, unlike the spiritual traditions,</p>
<p>which have said in some cases similar things,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve said it imprecisely.</p>
<p>This is mathematics.</p>
<p>We can actually now begin to state precisely,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the mathematical model of consciousness,</p>
<p>conscious agents, here&rsquo;s how it maps onto space time,</p>
<p>which I should sketch really briefly.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why things are ephemeral</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s why you shouldn&rsquo;t be worried</p>
<p>about the ephemeral nature of things</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not a little tiny entity</p>
<p>inside space and time, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the author of space and time.</p>
<p>The I and the am and the I am</p>
<p>is all kind of emerging through this whole process</p>
<p>of evolution and so on that&rsquo;s just surface waves</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a much deeper ocean</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to figure out here.</p>
<p>So how does, you said some of the stuff</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about maps to space time,</p>
<p>how does it map to space time?</p>
<p>So just a very, very high level and I&rsquo;ll keep it brief.</p>
<p>The structures that the physicists are finding,</p>
<p>like the amplituhedron, it turns out</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just static structure, they&rsquo;re polytopes.</p>
<p>But they, remarkably, most of the information in them</p>
<p>is contained in permutation matrices.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a matrix, like an end by end matrix</p>
<p>that just has zeros and ones.</p>
<p>That contains almost all of the information</p>
<p>and you can, they have these plebic graphs</p>
<p>and so forth that they use to boot up the scattering.</p>
<p>You can compute those scattering amplitudes</p>
<p>almost entirely from these permutation matrices.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just, now from my point of view,</p>
<p>I have this conscious agent dynamics.</p>
<p>It turns out that the stationary dynamics</p>
<p>that I was talking about,</p>
<p>where the entropy isn&rsquo;t increasing,</p>
<p>all the stationary dynamics are sketched out</p>
<p>by permutation matrices.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s so called Burkhoff polytope.</p>
<p>All the vertices of this polytope,</p>
<p>all the points are permutation matrices.</p>
<p>All the internal points are Markovian kernels</p>
<p>that have the uniform measure as a stationary measure.</p>
<p>Now I need to intuit a little better</p>
<p>what the heck you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So basically, there&rsquo;s some complicated thing</p>
<p>going on with the network of conscious agents</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s mappable to this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying a two dimensional matrix</p>
<p>that scattering has to do with what?</p>
<p>With our perception, like that&rsquo;s like photon stuff?</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>to sort of dig into detail.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do just the high level thing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the high level is the long term behavior</p>
<p>of the conscious agent dynamics.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the projection of just looking</p>
<p>at the long term behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping we&rsquo;ll give rise to the amplituhedron.</p>
<p>The amplituhedron then gives rise to space time.</p>
<p>So then I can just use their link</p>
<p>to go all the way from consciousness</p>
<p>through its asymptotics to,</p>
<p>through the amplituhedron into space time</p>
<p>and get the map all the way into our interface.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you mentioned the permutation matrix</p>
<p>because it gives you a nice thing to try to generate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s the connection with the amplituhedron.</p>
<p>The permutation matrices are the core of the amplituhedron</p>
<p>and it turns out they&rsquo;re the core</p>
<p>of the asymptotic description of the conscious agents.</p>
<p>So not to sort of bring up the idea of a creator,</p>
<p>but I like, first of all, I like video games</p>
<p>and you mentioned this kind of simulation idea.</p>
<p>First of all, do you think of it as an interesting idea,</p>
<p>this thought experiment that will live in a simulation?</p>
<p>And in general, do you think we&rsquo;ll live in a simulation?</p>
<p>So the Nick Bostrom&rsquo;s idea about the simulation</p>
<p>is typically couched in a physicalist framework.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So there is the bottom level,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some programmer in a physical space time</p>
<p>and they have a computer that they&rsquo;ve programmed</p>
<p>really cleverly where they&rsquo;ve created conscious entities.</p>
<p>So you have the hard problem of consciousness, right?</p>
<p>The standard hard problem.</p>
<p>How could a computer simulation create a conscious,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t explained by that simulation theory.</p>
<p>But then the idea is that the next level,</p>
<p>the entities that are created in the first level simulation</p>
<p>then can write their own simulations</p>
<p>and you get this nesting.</p>
<p>So the idea that this is a simulation is fine,</p>
<p>but the idea that it starts with a physicalist base,</p>
<p>I think, isn&rsquo;t fine.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s different properties here.</p>
<p>The partial rendering, and to me that&rsquo;s the interesting idea</p>
<p>is not whether the entirety of the universe is simulated,</p>
<p>but how efficiently can you create interfaces</p>
<p>that are convincing to all other entities</p>
<p>that can appreciate such interfaces?</p>
<p>How little does it take?</p>
<p>Because you said like partial rendering</p>
<p>or like temporal, ephemeral rendering of stuff.</p>
<p>Only render the tree falling in the forest</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s somebody there to see it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think,</p>
<p>how can you do that super efficiently</p>
<p>without having to render everything?</p>
<p>And that to me is one perspective on the simulation,</p>
<p>just like it is with video games,</p>
<p>where a video game doesn&rsquo;t have to render</p>
<p>every single thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the thing that the observer is looking at.</p>
<p>Right, there is actually, that&rsquo;s a very nice question.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s whole groups of researchers</p>
<p>that are actually studying in virtual reality,</p>
<p>what is the sort of minimal requirements on the system?</p>
<p>How does it have to operate</p>
<p>to give you an immersion experience,</p>
<p>to give you the feeling that you have a body,</p>
<p>to get you to take it real?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a lot of really good work</p>
<p>on that right now.</p>
<p>And it turns out it doesn&rsquo;t take that much.</p>
<p>You do need to get the perception action loop tight</p>
<p>and you have to give them the perceptions</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re expecting if you want them to.</p>
<p>But if you can lead them along,</p>
<p>if you give them perceptions</p>
<p>that are close to what they&rsquo;re expecting,</p>
<p>you can then maybe move their reality around a bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a tricky engineering problem,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re trying to create a product</p>
<p>that costs little, but that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it feels like an engineering problem,</p>
<p>not a deeply scientific problem.</p>
<p>Or meaning, obviously it&rsquo;s a scientific problem,</p>
<p>but as a scientific problem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that difficult to trick us descendants of apes.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s a case for just us, you know, our own,</p>
<p>if this is a virtual reality</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re experiencing right now.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s something you can try for yourself.</p>
<p>If you just close your eyes</p>
<p>and look at your experience in front of you,</p>
<p>be aware of your experience in front of you,</p>
<p>what you experience is just like a modeled dark gray,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s all sort of, there&rsquo;s some dynamics to it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just dark gray.</p>
<p>But now I ask you, instead of having your attention forward,</p>
<p>put your attention backward.</p>
<p>What is it like behind you with your eyes closed?</p>
<p>And there, it&rsquo;s like nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>So what is going on here?</p>
<p>What am I experiencing back there?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I guess it&rsquo;s the absence of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even like darkness or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even darkness.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no qualia to it.</p>
<p>And yet there is a sense of being.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the interesting thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of being back.</p>
<p>So I close my, when I put my attention forward,</p>
<p>I have the qualia of a gray model thing.</p>
<p>But when I put my attention backward,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no qualia at all, but there is a sense of being.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I personally, now you haven&rsquo;t been to that side of the room.</p>
<p>I have been to that side of the room.</p>
<p>So for me, memories, I start playing the engine</p>
<p>of memory replay, which is like,</p>
<p>I take myself back in time and think about that place</p>
<p>where I was hanging out in that part.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I see what I&rsquo;m behind.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting quirk of humans too,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to, we&rsquo;re collecting these experiences</p>
<p>and we can replay them in interesting ways</p>
<p>whenever we feel like it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like being there,</p>
<p>but not really, but almost.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And yet we can go our entire lives in this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about the minimal thing for VR.</p>
<p>We can go our entire lives and not realize</p>
<p>that all of my life, it&rsquo;s been like nothing behind me.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even aware that all of our lives,</p>
<p>if you just pay attention to us behind me,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like, oh, holy smoke, it&rsquo;s totally scary.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like nothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no qualia there at all.</p>
<p>How did I not notice that my entire life?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you could see this with children, right?</p>
<p>Though with persistence, you could do the peekaboo game.</p>
<p>You can hide from them and appear and they&rsquo;re fully tricked.</p>
<p>And in the same way, we&rsquo;re fully tricked.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing behind us and we assume there is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>These theories are pretty heavy.</p>
<p>You as a human being, as a mortal human being,</p>
<p>how has these theories been to you personally?</p>
<p>Like, are there good days and bad days</p>
<p>when you wake up and look in the mirror</p>
<p>and the fact that you can&rsquo;t see anything behind you?</p>
<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s rendered,</p>
<p>like, is there interesting quirks?</p>
<p>Nietzsche with his, if you gaze long into the abyss,</p>
<p>the abyss gazes into you.</p>
<p>How has these theories, these ideas,</p>
<p>changed you as a person?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been very, very difficult.</p>
<p>And this stuff is not just abstract theory building</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s about us.</p>
<p>Sometimes I realize that there&rsquo;s this big division in me.</p>
<p>My mind is doing all this science</p>
<p>and coming up with these conclusions</p>
<p>and the rest of me is not integrating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, I don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t believe this.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems, so as I start to take it seriously,</p>
<p>I get scared myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, but it&rsquo;s very much,</p>
<p>then I read these spiritual traditions</p>
<p>and realize they&rsquo;re saying very, very similar things.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a lot of convergence.</p>
<p>So for me, I have,</p>
<p>the first time I thought it might be possible</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not seeing the truth was in 1986.</p>
<p>It was from some mathematics we were doing.</p>
<p>And when that hit me, it hit me like a ton of bricks.</p>
<p>I had to sit down.</p>
<p>It was, it really, it was scary.</p>
<p>It was really a shock to the system.</p>
<p>And then to realize that everything</p>
<p>that has been important to me,</p>
<p>like, you know, getting a house,</p>
<p>getting a car, getting a reputation and so forth.</p>
<p>Well, that car is just like the car I see</p>
<p>in the virtual reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just there when you perceive it and it&rsquo;s not there.</p>
<p>So the whole question of, you know,</p>
<p>what am I doing and why?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worthwhile doing in life?</p>
<p>Clearly, getting a big house and getting a big car.</p>
<p>I mean, we all knew that we were gonna die.</p>
<p>So we tend not to know that.</p>
<p>We tend to hide it, especially when we&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>Before age 30, we don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>But we factually maybe know that you kind of</p>
<p>are supposed to, yeah.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll figure something out and we&rsquo;ll be the generation</p>
<p>that is the first one that doesn&rsquo;t have to die.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of thing.</p>
<p>But when you really face the fact that you&rsquo;re going to die,</p>
<p>and then when I start to look at it from this point of view</p>
<p>that, well, this thing was an interface to begin with.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m really, is what I&rsquo;m really gonna be doing,</p>
<p>just taking off a headset.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been playing in a virtual reality game all day</p>
<p>and I got lost in the game and I was fighting over a Porsche.</p>
<p>And I shot some guys up and I punctured their tires</p>
<p>and I got the Porsche.</p>
<p>Now I take the headset off and what was that for?</p>
<p>Nothing, it was just, it was a data structure</p>
<p>and the data structure is gone.</p>
<p>So all of the wars, the fighting and the reputations</p>
<p>and all this stuff, it&rsquo;s just a headset.</p>
<p>So my theory says that intellectually,</p>
<p>my mind, my emotions rebel all over the place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I, you know, and so I have to meditate.</p>
<p>I meditate a lot.</p>
<p>What percent of the day would you say you spend</p>
<p>as a physicalist sort of living life,</p>
<p>pretending your car matters, your reputation matters?</p>
<p>Like how much, what&rsquo;s that Tom Waits song,</p>
<p>I like my town with a little drop of poison.</p>
<p>How much poison do you allow yourself to have?</p>
<p>I think my default mode is physicalist.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s just the default.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not being conscious, consciously attentive.</p>
<p>Then intellectually consciously attentive,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re still,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re tasting coffee and not thinking</p>
<p>or drinking or just taking in the sunset,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not being intellectual,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still experiencing it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s when you turn on the introspective machine,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you can start.</p>
<p>And turn off the thinker,</p>
<p>when I actually just start looking without thinking.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when I feel like I,</p>
<p>all of a sudden I&rsquo;m starting to see through.</p>
<p>Sort of like, okay, part of the addiction to the interface</p>
<p>is all the stories I&rsquo;m telling about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important for me to get that,</p>
<p>really important to do that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m telling all these stories and so I&rsquo;m all wrapped up.</p>
<p>Almost all of the mind stuff that&rsquo;s going on in my head</p>
<p>is about attachment to the interface.</p>
<p>And so what I found is that the,</p>
<p>essentially the only way to really detach</p>
<p>from the interface is to literally let go</p>
<p>of thoughts altogether.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, even my identity,</p>
<p>my whole history, my name, my education,</p>
<p>all this stuff is almost irrelevant</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just now here is the present moment.</p>
<p>And this is the reality right now.</p>
<p>And all of that other stuff is an interface story.</p>
<p>But this conscious experience right now,</p>
<p>this is the only reality as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>The rest of it&rsquo;s a story.</p>
<p>But that is, again, not my default.</p>
<p>That is, I have to make a really conscious choice</p>
<p>to say, okay, I know intellectually</p>
<p>this is all an interface.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take the headset off and so forth.</p>
<p>And then immediately sink back into the game</p>
<p>and just be out there playing the game and get lost in it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m always lost in the game</p>
<p>unless I literally consciously choose to stop thinking.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it terrifying to acknowledge</p>
<p>that, to look beyond the game?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>It really is scary because I&rsquo;m so attached.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attached to this body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attached to the interface.</p>
<p>Are you ever worried about breaking your brain a bit?</p>
<p>Meaning like, it&rsquo;s, I mean, some of these ideas,</p>
<p>some of these ideas, when you think about reality,</p>
<p>even with like Einstein, just realizing,</p>
<p>you said interface, just realizing that light,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a speed of light</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t go faster than the speed of light</p>
<p>and what kind of things black holes can do with light,</p>
<p>even that can mess with your head.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s still space time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big mess, but it&rsquo;s still just space time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a property of our interface.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still like, even Einstein realized</p>
<p>that this particular thing,</p>
<p>some of the stories we tell ourselves</p>
<p>is constructing interfaces</p>
<p>that are oversimplifying the way things work</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>The stories are nice.</p>
<p>Stories are nice.</p>
<p>I mean, just like video games, they&rsquo;re nice.</p>
<p>Right, but Einstein was a realist, right?</p>
<p>He was a famous realist in the sense</p>
<p>that he was very explicit in a 1935 paper</p>
<p>with Podolsky and Rosen, the EPR paper, right?</p>
<p>They said, if without in any way disturbing a system,</p>
<p>I can predict with probability one,</p>
<p>the outcome of a measurement,</p>
<p>then there exists in reality that element, right?</p>
<p>That value that, and we now know from quantum theory</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s idea of local realism is strictly speaking false.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so we can predict, we can set up,</p>
<p>in quantum theory, you can set up,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum Bayesianism,</p>
<p>where he scouts this out.</p>
<p>It was done by other people,</p>
<p>but he gives a good presentation of this,</p>
<p>where they have a sequence of something</p>
<p>like nine different quantum measurements that you can make.</p>
<p>And you can predict with probability one</p>
<p>what a particular outcome will be,</p>
<p>but you can actually prove that it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>that the value existed before you made the measurement.</p>
<p>So you know with probability one what you&rsquo;re gonna get,</p>
<p>but you also know with certainty</p>
<p>that that value was not there</p>
<p>until you made the measurement.</p>
<p>So we know from quantum theory</p>
<p>that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.</p>
<p>And that is built into what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>with this theory of consciousness.</p>
<p>If consciousness is fundamental,</p>
<p>space time itself is an act of fact creation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interface that we create, consciousness creates,</p>
<p>plus all the objects in it.</p>
<p>So local realism is not true.</p>
<p>Quantum theory has established that.</p>
<p>Also noncontextual realism is not true.</p>
<p>And that fits in perfectly with this idea</p>
<p>that consciousness is fundamental.</p>
<p>These things are, these exist as data structures</p>
<p>when we create them.</p>
<p>As Chris Fuchs says, the act of observation</p>
<p>is an act of fact creation.</p>
<p>But I must say on a personal level,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having to spend,</p>
<p>I spend a couple hours a day</p>
<p>just sitting in meditation on this</p>
<p>and facing the rebellion in me</p>
<p>that goes to the core,</p>
<p>it feels like it goes to the core of my being,</p>
<p>rebellion against these ideas.</p>
<p>So here it&rsquo;s very, very interesting</p>
<p>for me to look at this because,</p>
<p>so here I&rsquo;m a scientist and I&rsquo;m a person.</p>
<p>The science is really clear.</p>
<p>Local realism is false.</p>
<p>Noncontextual realism is false.</p>
<p>Space time is doomed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very clear.</p>
<p>It couldn&rsquo;t be clearer.</p>
<p>And my emotions rebel left and right.</p>
<p>When I sit there and say, okay,</p>
<p>I am not something in space and time.</p>
<p>Something inside of me says, you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>Of course you are.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m completely attached to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely attached to all this stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attached to my body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attached to the headset.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attached to my car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attached to people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m attached to all of it.</p>
<p>And yet I know as an absolute fact,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna walk away from all of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna die.</p>
<p>In fact, I almost died last year.</p>
<p>COVID almost killed me.</p>
<p>I sent a goodbye text to my wife.</p>
<p>So I thought I was done.</p>
<p>You really did.</p>
<p>I sent her a goodbye.</p>
<p>I was in the emergency room and it had attacked my heart</p>
<p>and it had been at 190 beats per minute for 36 hours.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t last much longer.</p>
<p>I knew I couldn&rsquo;t, they couldn&rsquo;t stop it.</p>
<p>So that was it.</p>
<p>So I texted her goodbye from the emergency room.</p>
<p>I love you, goodbye kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was it.</p>
<p>So, so.</p>
<p>Were you afraid?</p>
<p>God, it scares the hell out of you, right?</p>
<p>But there was, you&rsquo;re just feeling so bad anyway</p>
<p>that sort of you&rsquo;re scared, but you&rsquo;re just feeling so bad</p>
<p>that in some sense you just want it to stop anyway.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been there and faced it just a year ago.</p>
<p>How did that change you, by the way?</p>
<p>Having this intellectual reality that&rsquo;s so challenging</p>
<p>that you meditate on, it&rsquo;s just an interface.</p>
<p>And one of the hardest things to come to terms with</p>
<p>is that that means that it&rsquo;s gonna end.</p>
<p>How did that change you having come so close</p>
<p>to the reality of it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just an intellectual reality,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a reality of death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s forced, I&rsquo;ve meditated for 20 years now.</p>
<p>And I would say averaging three or four hours a day.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s put a new urgency,</p>
<p>but urgency is not the right word</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s riveted my attention, I&rsquo;ll put it that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really riveted my attention and I&rsquo;ve really paid,</p>
<p>I spent a lot more time looking up</p>
<p>what spiritual traditions say.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, by the way, again, not taking it with the,</p>
<p>take it all with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I think it&rsquo;s stupid for me</p>
<p>to ignore it.</p>
<p>So I try to listen to the best ideas</p>
<p>and to sort out nonsense from,</p>
<p>and we all have to do it for ourselves, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>So what makes sense?</p>
<p>And I have the advantage of some science</p>
<p>so I can look at what science says</p>
<p>and try to compare with spiritual tradition.</p>
<p>I try to sort it out for myself.</p>
<p>But then I also look and realize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s another aspect to me,</p>
<p>which is this whole emotional aspect.</p>
<p>The, I seem to be wired up</p>
<p>as evolutionary psychology says I&rsquo;m wired up, right?</p>
<p>All these defensive mechanisms, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inclined to lie if I need to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m inclined to be angry, to protect myself,</p>
<p>to have an in group and an out group,</p>
<p>to try to make my reputation as big as possible,</p>
<p>to try to demean the out group.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these things</p>
<p>that evolutionary psychology is spot on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really bright about the human condition.</p>
<p>And yet I think evolution, as I said, evolutionary theory</p>
<p>is a projection of a deeper theory</p>
<p>where there may be no competition.</p>
<p>So how, so I&rsquo;m in this very interesting position</p>
<p>where I feel like, okay,</p>
<p>according to my own theory, I&rsquo;m consciousness.</p>
<p>And maybe this is what it means</p>
<p>for consciousness to wake up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like I have,</p>
<p>I feel like I have real skin in the game.</p>
<p>It really is scary.</p>
<p>I really was scared when I was about to die.</p>
<p>It really was hard to say goodbye to my wife.</p>
<p>It really, it really pained.</p>
<p>And to then look at that and then look at the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna walk away from this anyway</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just an interface.</p>
<p>How do I, so it&rsquo;s trying to put all this stuff together</p>
<p>and really grok it, so to speak,</p>
<p>not just intellectually, but grok it at an emotional level.</p>
<p>Yeah, what are you afraid of,</p>
<p>you silly evolved organism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gotten way too attached to the interface?</p>
<p>What are you really afraid of?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Is there a&hellip;</p>
<p>Very personal, you know, it&rsquo;s very, very personal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, speaking of the text,</p>
<p>what do you think is this whole love thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of love in our human condition?</p>
<p>This interface thing we have,</p>
<p>is this somehow interweaved,</p>
<p>interconnected with consciousness?</p>
<p>This attachment we have to other humans</p>
<p>and this deep, like some quality to it</p>
<p>that seems very interesting, peculiar.</p>
<p>Well, there are two levels I would think about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s love in the sexual sense</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s love in a deeper sense.</p>
<p>And in the sexual sense,</p>
<p>we can give an evolutionary account of that and so forth.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s pretty clear to people.</p>
<p>In this deeper sense, right?</p>
<p>So of course, I love my wife in a sexual sense,</p>
<p>but there is a deeper sense as well.</p>
<p>When I was saying goodbye to her,</p>
<p>there was a much deeper love that was really at play there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one place where I think</p>
<p>that the mixed bag from spiritual traditions</p>
<p>has something right.</p>
<p>When they say, love your neighbor as yourself,</p>
<p>that in some sense, love is fundamental.</p>
<p>I think that they&rsquo;re onto something,</p>
<p>something very, very deep and profound.</p>
<p>And every once in a while,</p>
<p>I can get a personal glimpse of that,</p>
<p>especially when I&rsquo;m in the space with no thought.</p>
<p>When I can really let go of thoughts,</p>
<p>I get little glimpses of a love</p>
<p>in the sense that I&rsquo;m not separate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a love in the sense that I&rsquo;m not different from that.</p>
<p>If you and I are separate, then I can fight you.</p>
<p>But if you and I are the same, if there&rsquo;s a union there.</p>
<p>The togetherness of it, yeah.</p>
<p>What, who&rsquo;s God?</p>
<p>All those gods, the stories that have been told</p>
<p>throughout history, you said through the spiritual traditions.</p>
<p>What do you think that is?</p>
<p>Is that us trying to find that common thing at the core?</p>
<p>Well, in many traditions, not all.</p>
<p>The one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister.</p>
<p>We tend to think of God as a being.</p>
<p>But I think that that&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>I think the closest way to think about God is being, period.</p>
<p>Not a being, but being, the very ground of being itself is God.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the deep, and from my point of view,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the ground of consciousness.</p>
<p>So the ground of conscious being is what we might call God.</p>
<p>But the word God has always been,</p>
<p>for example, you don&rsquo;t believe the same God as my God,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna fight you, or we&rsquo;ll have wars over,</p>
<p>because the being, the specific being that you call God</p>
<p>is different from the being that I call God,</p>
<p>and so we fight.</p>
<p>Whereas if it&rsquo;s not a being, but just being,</p>
<p>and you and I share a being,</p>
<p>then you and I are not separate,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no reason to fight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both part of that one being,</p>
<p>and loving you is loving myself,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all part of that one being.</p>
<p>The spiritual traditions that point to that,</p>
<p>I think are pointing in a very interesting direction,</p>
<p>and that does seem to match with the mathematics</p>
<p>of the conscious agent stuff</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been working on as well,</p>
<p>that it really fits with that, although that wasn&rsquo;t my goal.</p>
<p>Is there, you mentioned,</p>
<p>you mentioned that the young physicists that you talk to,</p>
<p>or whose work you follow, have quite a lot of fun</p>
<p>breaking with the traditions of the past,</p>
<p>the assumptions of the past.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people today,</p>
<p>in high school, in college, not just physicists,</p>
<p>but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of,</p>
<p>how they can have a life they can be proud of,</p>
<p>how to make their way in the world,</p>
<p>from the lessons, from the wins and the losses</p>
<p>in your own life, what little insights could you pull out?</p>
<p>I would say the universe is a lot more interesting</p>
<p>than you might expect, and you are a lot more special</p>
<p>and interesting than you might expect.</p>
<p>You might think that you&rsquo;re just a little, tiny,</p>
<p>irrelevant, 100 pound, 200 pound person</p>
<p>in a vast billions of light years across space,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>You are, in some sense, the being that&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>that space all the time, every time you look.</p>
<p>So, waking up to who you really are,</p>
<p>outside of space and time,</p>
<p>as the author of space and time,</p>
<p>as the author of everything that you see.</p>
<p>The author of space and time, sorry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the author of space and time,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m the author of space and time,</p>
<p>and space and time is just one little data structure.</p>
<p>Many other consciousnesses are creating</p>
<p>other data structures, they&rsquo;re authors</p>
<p>of various other things.</p>
<p>So, realizing, and then realizing that,</p>
<p>I had this feeling growing up, going to college,</p>
<p>reading all these textbooks, oh man, it&rsquo;s all been done.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;d just been there 50 years ago,</p>
<p>I could have discovered this stuff,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all in the textbooks now.</p>
<p>Well, believe me, the textbooks are gonna look silly</p>
<p>in 50 years, and it&rsquo;s your chance</p>
<p>to write the new textbook.</p>
<p>So, of course, study the current textbooks.</p>
<p>You have to understand them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to progress until you understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s been done, but then,</p>
<p>the only limit is your imagination, frankly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only limit.</p>
<p>The greatest books, the greatest textbooks</p>
<p>ever written on Earth are yet to be written.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life from your limited interface?</p>
<p>Can you figure it all out, like why?</p>
<p>So, you said the universe is kind of trying to figure</p>
<p>itself out through us.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the closest I&rsquo;ve come.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ll give you, so I will say that I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s my guess, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good first sentence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good starting point.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s gonna be a profound part</p>
<p>of the final answer is to start with the I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible that that&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>to start with the I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental</p>
<p>and if G√∂del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem holds here,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s infinite variety of structures</p>
<p>for consciousness to some sense explore,</p>
<p>that maybe that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>This is something that Annika and I talked about a little bit</p>
<p>and she doesn&rsquo;t like this way of talking about it.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m gonna have to talk with her some more</p>
<p>about this way of talking.</p>
<p>But right now I&rsquo;ll just put it this way</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll have to talk with her more</p>
<p>and see if I can say it more clearly.</p>
<p>But the way I&rsquo;m talking about it now is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense in which there&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the experiences or forms</p>
<p>that come out of being.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one deep, deep mystery.</p>
<p>And the question that you asked, what is it all about?</p>
<p>Somehow it&rsquo;s related to that.</p>
<p>Why does being, why doesn&rsquo;t it just stay without any forms?</p>
<p>Why do we have experiences?</p>
<p>Why not just have, when you close your eyes</p>
<p>and pay attention to what&rsquo;s behind you, there&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s being.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we just stop there?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t we just stop there?</p>
<p>Why did we create all tables and chairs</p>
<p>and the sun and moon and people?</p>
<p>All this really complicated stuff, why?</p>
<p>And all I can guess right now,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll probably kick myself in a couple of years</p>
<p>and say that was dumb, but all I can guess right now</p>
<p>is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself</p>
<p>by knowing what it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So here I am, I&rsquo;m not this body.</p>
<p>And I sort of saw that, it was sort of in my face</p>
<p>when I sent a text goodbye.</p>
<p>But then as soon as I&rsquo;m better, it&rsquo;s sort of like,</p>
<p>okay, I sort of don&rsquo;t wanna go there, right?</p>
<p>I, okay, so I just, so I am my body.</p>
<p>I go back to the standard thing, I am my body</p>
<p>and then I want to get that car.</p>
<p>And even though I was just about to die a year ago,</p>
<p>so that comes rushing back.</p>
<p>So consciousness immerses itself fully</p>
<p>into a particular headset.</p>
<p>Gets lost in it and then slowly wakes up.</p>
<p>Just so it can escape and that is the waking up,</p>
<p>but it needs to have a negative.</p>
<p>It needs to know what it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It needs to know what you are.</p>
<p>You have to say, oh, I&rsquo;m not that, I&rsquo;m not that.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t important, that wasn&rsquo;t important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>Don, let me just say that because I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>a long term fan of yours and we&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to have a conversation during this very difficult moment</p>
<p>in your life, let me just say you&rsquo;re a truly special person</p>
<p>and I for one, I know there&rsquo;s a lot of others that agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;re still here with us on this earth</p>
<p>if for a short time.</p>
<p>So whatever, whatever the universe,</p>
<p>whatever plan it has for you that brought you close</p>
<p>to death to maybe enlighten you some kind of way,</p>
<p>I think it has an interesting plan for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the truly special humans</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a huge honor that you would sit</p>
<p>and talk with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Lex.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that, thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Donald Hoffman.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description and now, let me leave you</p>
<p>with some words from Albert Einstein,</p>
<p>relevant to the ideas discussed in this conversation.</p>
<p>Time and space are modes by which we think</p>
<p>and not conditions in which we live.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
