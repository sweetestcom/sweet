    <p>The following is a conversation with Dan Carlin,</p>
<p>host of Hardcore History and Common Sense Podcasts.</p>
<p>To me, Hardcore History is one of,</p>
<p>if not the greatest podcast ever made.</p>
<p>Dan and Joe Rogan are probably the two main people</p>
<p>who got me to fall in love with the medium of podcasting</p>
<p>as a fan and eventually as a podcaster myself.</p>
<p>Meeting Dan was surreal.</p>
<p>To me, he was not just a mere human like the rest of us,</p>
<p>since his voice has been a guide</p>
<p>through some of the darkest moments</p>
<p>of human history for me.</p>
<p>Meeting him was like meeting Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>Stalin, Hitler, Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>and all of the most powerful leaders in history all at once</p>
<p>in a crappy hotel room in the middle of Oregon.</p>
<p>It turns out that he is in fact just a human</p>
<p>and truly one of the good ones.</p>
<p>This was a pleasure and an honor for me.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor,</p>
<p>followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>
<p>First is Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>the all in one drink that I start every day with</p>
<p>to cover all my nutritional bases.</p>
<p>Second is SimpliSafe,</p>
<p>a home security company I use to monitor</p>
<p>and protect my apartment.</p>
<p>Third is Magic Spoon,</p>
<p>low carb, keto friendly cereal that I think is delicious.</p>
<p>And finally, Cash App,</p>
<p>the app I use to send money to friends for food and drinks.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living through one of the most challenging moments</p>
<p>in American history.</p>
<p>To me, the way out is through reason and love.</p>
<p>Both require a deep understanding of human nature</p>
<p>and of human history.</p>
<p>This conversation is about both.</p>
<p>I am, perhaps hopelessly, optimistic about our future.</p>
<p>But, if indeed we stand at the precipice</p>
<p>of the great filter, watching our world consumed by fire,</p>
<p>think of this little podcast conversation</p>
<p>as the appetizer to the final meal before the apocalypse.</p>

<p>And now, finally, here&rsquo;s my conversation</p>
<p>with the great Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the highest philosophical question.</p>
<p>Do you think human beings are fundamentally good,</p>
<p>or are all of us capable of both good and evil,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the environment that molds how we,</p>
<p>the trajectory that we take through life?</p>
<p>How do we define evil?</p>
<p>Evil seems to be a situational</p>
<p>eye of the beholder kind of question.</p>
<p>So, if we define evil, maybe I can get a better idea of,</p>
<p>and that could be a whole show, couldn&rsquo;t it, defining evil.</p>
<p>But when we say evil, what do we mean?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a slippery one, but I think there&rsquo;s some way</p>
<p>in which your existence, your presence in the world,</p>
<p>leads to pain and suffering and destruction</p>
<p>for many others in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So, you steal the resources and you use them</p>
<p>to create more suffering than there was before in the world.</p>
<p>So, I suppose it&rsquo;s somehow deeply connected</p>
<p>to this other slippery word, which is suffering.</p>
<p>As you create suffering in the world,</p>
<p>you bring suffering to the world.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem, I think, with it,</p>
<p>because I fully see where you&rsquo;re going with that,</p>
<p>and I understand it.</p>
<p>The problem is the question of the reason</p>
<p>for inflicting suffering.</p>
<p>So, sometimes one might inflict suffering</p>
<p>upon one group of individuals</p>
<p>in order to maximize a lack of suffering</p>
<p>with another group of individuals,</p>
<p>or one who might not be considered evil at all</p>
<p>might make the rational, seemingly rational choice</p>
<p>of inflicting pain and suffering</p>
<p>on a smaller group of people</p>
<p>in order to maximize the opposite of that</p>
<p>for a larger group of people.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the dark things about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken and read the work of Stephen Kotkin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with the historian,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s basically a Stalin, a Joseph Stalin scholar.</p>
<p>And one of the things I realized,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where to put Hitler, but with Stalin,</p>
<p>it really seems that he was sane</p>
<p>and he thought he was doing good for the world.</p>
<p>I really believe from everything I&rsquo;ve read about Stalin</p>
<p>that he believed that communism is good for the world.</p>
<p>And if you have to kill a few people along the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you said, the small groups,</p>
<p>if you have to sort of remove the people</p>
<p>that stand in the way of this utopian system of communism,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s actually good for the world.</p>
<p>And it didn&rsquo;t seem to me</p>
<p>that he could even consider the possibility</p>
<p>that he was evil.</p>
<p>He really thought he was doing good for the world.</p>
<p>And that stuck with me because he&rsquo;s one of the most,</p>
<p>is to our definition of evil,</p>
<p>he seems to have brought more evil onto this world</p>
<p>than almost any human in history.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m fascinated with the concept,</p>
<p>so fascinated by it that the very first</p>
<p>hardcore history show we ever did,</p>
<p>which was a full 15 or 16 minutes,</p>
<p>was called Alexander versus Hitler.</p>
<p>And the entire question about it was the motivations, right?</p>
<p>So if you go to a court of law because you killed somebody,</p>
<p>one of the things they&rsquo;re going to consider</p>
<p>is why did you kill them, right?</p>
<p>And if you killed somebody, for example, in self defense,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be treated differently</p>
<p>than if you malicious killed somebody</p>
<p>maliciously to take their wallet, right?</p>
<p>And in the show, we wondered,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t really make pronouncements,</p>
<p>but we wondered about if you believe Hitler&rsquo;s writings,</p>
<p>for example, Mein Kampf, which is written by a guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a political figure who wants to get,</p>
<p>so I mean, it&rsquo;s about as believable</p>
<p>as any other political tract would be.</p>
<p>But in his mind, the things that he said that he had to do</p>
<p>were designed for the betterment of the German people, right?</p>
<p>Whereas Alexander the Great, once again,</p>
<p>this is somebody from more than 2000 years ago,</p>
<p>so with lots of propaganda in the intervening years,</p>
<p>but one of the views of Alexander the Great</p>
<p>is that the reason he did what he did</p>
<p>was to, for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>write his name in a more permanent graffiti</p>
<p>on the pages of history, right?</p>
<p>In other words, to glorify himself.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>does that make Alexander a worse person than Hitler</p>
<p>because Hitler thought he was doing good,</p>
<p>whereas Alexander, if you believe the interpretation,</p>
<p>was simply trying to exalt Alexander.</p>
<p>So the motivations of the people doing these things,</p>
<p>it seems to me, matter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you can just sit there and go,</p>
<p>the only thing that matters is the end result,</p>
<p>because that might&rsquo;ve been an unintentional byproduct,</p>
<p>in which case, that person,</p>
<p>had you been able to show them the future,</p>
<p>might have changed what they were doing.</p>
<p>So were they evil or misguided or wrong or made the wrong?</p>
<p>So, and I hate to do that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s certain people like Hitler</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t feel deserve the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>At the same time, if you&rsquo;re fascinated</p>
<p>by the concept of evil and you delve into it deeply enough,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to want to understand</p>
<p>why these evil people did what they did.</p>
<p>And sometimes it can confuse the hell out of you.</p>
<p>You know, who wants to sit there</p>
<p>and try to see things from Hitler&rsquo;s point of view</p>
<p>to get a better understanding</p>
<p>and sort of commiserate with.</p>
<p>So, but I&rsquo;m, obviously, first history show,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated with the concept.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>if we put ourselves in the mindset</p>
<p>of some of the people that have led,</p>
<p>created so much suffering in the world,</p>
<p>that all of them had their motivations were,</p>
<p>had good intentions underlying them?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s simply because there&rsquo;s so many,</p>
<p>I mean, the law of averages would suggest</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>I guess it is pure evil possible,</p>
<p>meaning you, again, it&rsquo;s slippery,</p>
<p>but you, the suffering is the goal.</p>
<p>Suffering, intentional suffering.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that, and I think that there&rsquo;s historical</p>
<p>figures that one could point,</p>
<p>but that gets to the deeper question of,</p>
<p>are these people sane?</p>
<p>Do they have something wrong with them?</p>
<p>Are they twisted from something in their youth?</p>
<p>You know, these are the kinds of things</p>
<p>where you start to delve into the psychological makeup</p>
<p>of these people.</p>
<p>In other words, is anybody born evil?</p>
<p>And I actually believe that some people are.</p>
<p>I think the DNA can get scrambled up in ways.</p>
<p>I think the question of evil is important too,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s an eye of the beholder thing.</p>
<p>I mean, if Hitler, for example, had been successful</p>
<p>and we were today on the sixth or seventh leader</p>
<p>of the Third Reich, since I think his entire history</p>
<p>would be viewed through a different lens,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the way we do things, right?</p>
<p>Genghis Khan looks different to the Mongolians</p>
<p>than he does to the residents of Baghdad, right?</p>
<p>And I think, so an eye of the beholder question,</p>
<p>I think comes into all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>As you said, it&rsquo;s a very slippery question.</p>
<p>Where do you put, as somebody who&rsquo;s fascinated</p>
<p>by military history, where do you put violence</p>
<p>in terms of the human condition?</p>
<p>Is it core to being human or is it just a little tool</p>
<p>that we use every once in a while?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna respond to your question with a question.</p>
<p>What do you see the difference being</p>
<p>between violence and force?</p>
<p>Let me go farther.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that violence is something</p>
<p>that we have to put up with as human beings forever,</p>
<p>that we must resign ourselves to violence forever.</p>
<p>But I have a much harder time seeing us</p>
<p>able to abolish force.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be some ground</p>
<p>where if those two things are not the same,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know that maybe they are,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s certainly some crossover.</p>
<p>And I think force, you&rsquo;re an engineer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll understand this better than I did,</p>
<p>but think about it as a physical law.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t stop something from moving</p>
<p>in a certain direction without pushing back</p>
<p>in that same direction, I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>that you can have a society or a civilization</p>
<p>without the ability to use a counter force</p>
<p>when things are going wrong,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s on an individual level, right?</p>
<p>A person attacks another person,</p>
<p>so you step in to save that person,</p>
<p>or even at the highest levels of politics or anything else,</p>
<p>a counter force to stop the inertia</p>
<p>or the impetus of another movement.</p>
<p>So I think that force is a simple,</p>
<p>almost law of physics in human interaction,</p>
<p>especially at the civilizational level.</p>
<p>I think civilization requires a certain amount of,</p>
<p>if not violence, then force.</p>
<p>And again, they&rsquo;ve talked, I mean,</p>
<p>it goes back into St. Augustine,</p>
<p>all kinds of Christian beliefs about the proper use of force</p>
<p>and people have philosophically tried to decide</p>
<p>between can you have sort of an ahimsa,</p>
<p>Buddhists sort of, we will be nonviolent toward everything</p>
<p>and exert no force, or there&rsquo;s a reason to have force</p>
<p>in order to create the space for good.</p>
<p>I think force is inevitable.</p>
<p>Now, we can talk, and I&rsquo;ve not come up</p>
<p>to the conclusion myself, if there is a distinction</p>
<p>to be made between force and violence.</p>
<p>I mean, is a nonviolent force enough,</p>
<p>or is violence when done for the cause of good</p>
<p>a different thing than violence done</p>
<p>either for the cause of evil, as you would say,</p>
<p>or simply for random reasons?</p>
<p>I mean, we humans lack control sometimes.</p>
<p>We can be violent for no apparent reason or goal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, you look at the criminal justice system alone</p>
<p>and the way we interact with people</p>
<p>who are acting out in ways that we as a society</p>
<p>have decided is intolerable.</p>
<p>Can you deal with that without force</p>
<p>and at some level violence?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Can you maintain peacefulness without force?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Just to be a little bit more specific</p>
<p>about the idea of force, do you put force</p>
<p>as general enough to include force in the space of ideas?</p>
<p>So you mentioned Buddhism or religion or just Twitter.</p>
<p>I can think of no things farther apart than that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is the battles we do in the space of ideas</p>
<p>of the great debates throughout history,</p>
<p>do you put force into that?</p>
<p>Or do you, in this conversation,</p>
<p>are we trying to right now keep it to just physical force</p>
<p>in saying that you have an intuition</p>
<p>that force might be with us much longer than violence?</p>
<p>I think the two bleed together.</p>
<p>So take, because it&rsquo;s always my go to example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid and I&rsquo;m sure that the listeners all hate it,</p>
<p>but take Germany during the 1920s, early 1930s,</p>
<p>before the Nazis came to power.</p>
<p>And they were always involved in some level of force,</p>
<p>beating up in the streets or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>But think about it more like an intellectual discussion</p>
<p>until a certain point.</p>
<p>It would be difficult, I imagine,</p>
<p>to keep the intellectual counter force of ideas</p>
<p>from at some point degenerating</p>
<p>into something that&rsquo;s more coercion, counter force,</p>
<p>if we want to use the phrases we were just talking about.</p>
<p>So I think the two are intimately connected.</p>
<p>I mean, actions follow thought, right?</p>
<p>And at a certain point, I think,</p>
<p>especially when one is not achieving the goals</p>
<p>that they want to achieve through a peaceful discussion</p>
<p>or argumentation or trying to convince the other side,</p>
<p>that sometimes the next level of operations</p>
<p>is something a little bit more physically imposing,</p>
<p>if that makes sense.</p>
<p>We go from the intellectual to the physical.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it too easily spills over into violence.</p>
<p>Yes, and one leads to the other often.</p>
<p>So you kind of implied perhaps a hopeful message.</p>
<p>Let me ask it in the form of a question.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll always have war?</p>
<p>I think it goes to the first question too.</p>
<p>So for example, what do you do?</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s play with nation states now,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t know that nation states</p>
<p>are something we should think of</p>
<p>as a permanent construct forever.</p>
<p>But how is one nation state</p>
<p>supposed to prevent another nation state</p>
<p>from acting in ways that it would see</p>
<p>as either detrimental to the global community</p>
<p>or detrimental to the interest of their own nation state?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve had this question</p>
<p>of going back to ancient times,</p>
<p>but certainly in the 20th century,</p>
<p>this has come up quite a bit.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole Second World War argument</p>
<p>sometimes revolves around the idea</p>
<p>of what the proper counterforce should be.</p>
<p>Can you create an entity, a league of nations,</p>
<p>the United Nations, a one world entity maybe even</p>
<p>that alleviates the need for counterforce</p>
<p>involving mass violence and armies and navies</p>
<p>and those things?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an open discussion we&rsquo;re still having.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to think through that</p>
<p>because having something like a United Nations,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s usually a centralized control.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s humans at the top,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s committees and usually like leaders</p>
<p>emerge as singular figures</p>
<p>that then can become corrupted by power.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a really important,</p>
<p>it feels like a really important thought experiment</p>
<p>and something to really rigorously think through.</p>
<p>How can you construct systems of government</p>
<p>that are stable enough to push us towards less and less war</p>
<p>and less and less unstable and another tough word,</p>
<p>another tough word which is unfair of application of force?</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s really at the core of the question</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to figure out as humans,</p>
<p>as our weapons get better and better and better</p>
<p>destroying ourselves,</p>
<p>it feels like it&rsquo;s important to think about</p>
<p>how we minimize the over application</p>
<p>or unfair application of force.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other elements that come into play too.</p>
<p>You and I are discussing this</p>
<p>at the very high intellectual level of things,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a tail wagging the dog element to this.</p>
<p>So think of a society of warriors,</p>
<p>a tribal society from a long time ago.</p>
<p>How much do the fact that you have warriors in your society</p>
<p>and that their reason for existing,</p>
<p>what they take pride in, what they train for,</p>
<p>what their status in their own civilization,</p>
<p>how much does that itself</p>
<p>drive the responses of that society, right?</p>
<p>How much do you need war to legitimize warriors?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the old argument that you get to</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve had this in the 20th century too,</p>
<p>that the creation of arms and armies</p>
<p>creates an incentive to use them, right?</p>
<p>And that they themselves can drive that incentive</p>
<p>as a justification for their reasons for existence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we start to talk about the interactivity</p>
<p>of all these different elements of society upon one another.</p>
<p>So when we talk about governments and war,</p>
<p>well, you need to take into account</p>
<p>the various things those governments have put into place</p>
<p>in terms of systems and armies and things like that</p>
<p>to protect themselves, right?</p>
<p>For reasons we can all understand,</p>
<p>but they exert a force on your range of choices, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making me realize that in my upbringing</p>
<p>and I think upbringing of many, warriors are heroes.</p>
<p>To me, I don&rsquo;t know where that feeling comes from,</p>
<p>but to sort of die fighting</p>
<p>is an honorable way to die, it feels like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had a problem with this</p>
<p>because as a person interested in military history,</p>
<p>the distinction is important</p>
<p>and I try to make it at different levels.</p>
<p>So at base level, the people who are out there</p>
<p>on the front lines doing the fighting,</p>
<p>to me, those people can be compared with police officers</p>
<p>and firemen and people, fire persons,</p>
<p>but I mean, people that are involved</p>
<p>in an ethical attempt to perform a task</p>
<p>which ultimately one can see in many situations</p>
<p>as being a saving sort of task, right?</p>
<p>Or if nothing else, a self sacrifice</p>
<p>for what they see as the greater good.</p>
<p>Now, I draw a distinction between the individuals</p>
<p>and the entity that they&rsquo;re a part of,</p>
<p>a military, and I certainly draw a distinction</p>
<p>between the military and then the entire,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word, military industrial complex</p>
<p>that that service is a part of.</p>
<p>I feel a lot less moral attachment</p>
<p>to those upper echelons than I do the people on the ground.</p>
<p>The people on the ground could be any of us</p>
<p>and have been in a lot of,</p>
<p>we have a very professional sort of military now</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a very, a subset of the population,</p>
<p>but in other periods of time, we&rsquo;ve had conscription</p>
<p>and drafts and it hasn&rsquo;t been a subset of the population,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been the population, right?</p>
<p>And so it is the society oftentimes going to war</p>
<p>and I make a distinction between those warriors</p>
<p>and the entities either in the system</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a part of the military</p>
<p>or the people that control the military</p>
<p>at the highest political levels.</p>
<p>I feel a lot less moral attachment to them</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m much harsher about how I feel about them.</p>
<p>I do not consider the military itself to be heroic</p>
<p>and I do not consider the military industrial complex</p>
<p>to be heroic.</p>
<p>I do think that is a tail wagging the dog situation.</p>
<p>I do think that draws us into looking at military endeavors</p>
<p>as a solution to the problem much more quickly</p>
<p>than we otherwise might.</p>
<p>And to be honest, to tie it all together,</p>
<p>I actually look at the victims of this</p>
<p>as the soldiers we were talking about.</p>
<p>If you set a fire to send firemen into to fight,</p>
<p>then I feel bad for the firemen.</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;ve abused the trust</p>
<p>that you give those people, right?</p>
<p>So when people talk about war,</p>
<p>I always think that the people that we have to make sure</p>
<p>that a war is really necessary in order to protect</p>
<p>are the people that you&rsquo;re gonna send over there</p>
<p>to fight that.</p>
<p>The greatest victims in our society of war</p>
<p>are often the warriors.</p>
<p>So in my mind, when we see these people coming home</p>
<p>from places like Iraq,</p>
<p>a place where I would have made the argument</p>
<p>and did at the time that we didn&rsquo;t belong.</p>
<p>To me, those people are victims</p>
<p>and I know they don&rsquo;t like to think about themselves</p>
<p>that way because it runs totally counter to the ethos.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re sending people to protect this country&rsquo;s shores,</p>
<p>those are heroes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sending people to go do something</p>
<p>that they otherwise probably don&rsquo;t need to do</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re there for political reasons</p>
<p>or anything else you wanna put in</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not defense related,</p>
<p>well then you&rsquo;ve made victims of our heroes.</p>
<p>And so I feel like we do a lot of talk</p>
<p>about our troops and our soldiers and stuff</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t treat them as valuable</p>
<p>as the rhetoric makes them sound.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we would be much more careful</p>
<p>about where we put them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna send my son,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have a son, I have daughters,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re gonna send my son into harm&rsquo;s way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to demand that you really need</p>
<p>to be sending him into harm&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to be angry at you</p>
<p>if you put him into harm&rsquo;s way if it doesn&rsquo;t warrant it.</p>
<p>And so I have much more suspicion about the system</p>
<p>that sends these people into these situations</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re required to be heroic</p>
<p>than I do the people on the ground</p>
<p>that I look at as either the people</p>
<p>that are defending us in situations</p>
<p>like the Second World War, for example,</p>
<p>or the people that turn out to be the individual victims</p>
<p>of a system where they&rsquo;re just a cog in a machine</p>
<p>and the machine doesn&rsquo;t really care as much about them</p>
<p>as the rhetoric and the propaganda would insinuate.</p>
<p>Yeah, and as my own family history,</p>
<p>it would be nice if we could talk about</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a gray area in the places</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gray area in everything.</p>
<p>In everything.</p>
<p>But when that gray area is part of your own blood,</p>
<p>as it is for me, it&rsquo;s worth shining a light on somehow.</p>
<p>Sure, give me an example of what you mean.</p>
<p>So you did a program of four episodes</p>
<p>of Ghosts of the Ostfront.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I was born in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I was raised in Moscow.</p>
<p>My dad was born and raised in Kiev.</p>
<p>My grandmother, who just recently passed away,</p>
<p>was raised in Ukraine.</p>
<p>A city.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small city on the border between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>I have a grandfather born in Kiev.</p>
<p>In Kiev.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the timing of everything,</p>
<p>as you might be able to connect, is she survived.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the most badass woman I&rsquo;ve ever encountered in my life</p>
<p>and most of the warrior spirit I carry is probably from her.</p>
<p>She survived Polar Mor, the Ukrainian starvation</p>
<p>of the 30s.</p>
<p>She was a beautiful teenage girl</p>
<p>during the Nazi occupation of,</p>
<p>so she survived all of that.</p>
<p>And of course, family that everybody,</p>
<p>and so many people died through that whole process.</p>
<p>And one of the things you talk about in your program</p>
<p>is that the gray area is, even with the warriors,</p>
<p>it happened to them, just like as you&rsquo;re saying now,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>So my grandfather on the other side,</p>
<p>he was a machine gunner that was in Ukraine that.</p>
<p>In the Red Army?</p>
<p>In the Red Army, yeah.</p>
<p>And they threw, like the statement was that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s obvious or not,</p>
<p>but the rule was there&rsquo;s no surrender.</p>
<p>So you better die.</p>
<p>So you, I mean, you&rsquo;re basically,</p>
<p>the goal was when he was fighting</p>
<p>and he was lucky enough,</p>
<p>one of the only to survive by being wounded early on</p>
<p>is there was a march of Nazis towards, I guess, Moscow.</p>
<p>And the whole goal in Ukraine was to slow every,</p>
<p>to slow them into the winter.</p>
<p>I mean, I view him as such a hero</p>
<p>and he believed that he&rsquo;s indestructible,</p>
<p>which is survivor bias.</p>
<p>And that, you know, bullets can&rsquo;t hurt him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what everybody believed.</p>
<p>And of course, basically everyone that,</p>
<p>he quickly rose to the ranks, let&rsquo;s just put it this way,</p>
<p>because everybody died.</p>
<p>It was just bodies dragging these heavy machine guns,</p>
<p>like always, you know, always slowly retreating,</p>
<p>shooting and retreating, shooting and retreating.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, he was a hero to me, like I always,</p>
<p>I grew up thinking that he was the one</p>
<p>that sort of defeated the Nazis, right?</p>
<p>And, but the reality that there could be another perspective,</p>
<p>which is all of this happened to him</p>
<p>by the incompetence of Stalin, the incompetence</p>
<p>and men of the Soviet Union being used like pawns</p>
<p>in a shittily played game of chess, right?</p>
<p>So like the one narrative is of him as a victim,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re kind of describing.</p>
<p>And then somehow that&rsquo;s more paralyzing and that&rsquo;s more,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it feels better to think of him as a hero</p>
<p>and as Russia, Soviet Union saving the world.</p>
<p>I mean, that narrative also,</p>
<p>is in the United States that the United States was key</p>
<p>in saving the world from the Nazis.</p>
<p>It feels like that narrative is powerful for people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, and I carry it still with me,</p>
<p>but when I think about the right way</p>
<p>to think about that war,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s the correct narrative.</p>
<p>Let me suggest something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a line that a Marine named Eugene Sledge had to say</p>
<p>once and I keep it on my phone because it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it makes a real distinction.</p>
<p>And he said, the front line is really where the war is.</p>
<p>And anybody, even a hundred yards behind the front line</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s really like.</p>
<p>Now, the difference is, is there are lots of people miles</p>
<p>behind the front line that are in danger, right?</p>
<p>You can be in a medical unit in the rear</p>
<p>and artillery could strike you, planes could strike me.</p>
<p>You could be in danger,</p>
<p>but at the front line, there are two different things.</p>
<p>One is that, and at least,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing a lot of reading on this right now</p>
<p>and reading a lot of veterans accounts.</p>
<p>James Jones, who wrote books like From Here to Eternity,</p>
<p>fictional accounts of the Second World War,</p>
<p>but he based them on his own service.</p>
<p>He was at Guadalcanal, for example, in 1942.</p>
<p>And Jones had said that the evolution of a soldier</p>
<p>in front line action requires a lot of</p>
<p>front line action requires an almost surrendering</p>
<p>to the idea that you&rsquo;re going to live,</p>
<p>that you become accustomed to the idea</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to die.</p>
<p>And he said, you&rsquo;re a different person</p>
<p>simply for considering that thought seriously,</p>
<p>because most of us don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But what that allows you to do is to do that job</p>
<p>at the front line, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too concerned about your own life,</p>
<p>you become less of a good guy at your job, right?</p>
<p>The other thing that the people in the 100 yards</p>
<p>at the front line do that the people</p>
<p>in the rear medical unit really don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>is you kill and you kill a lot, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just, oh, there&rsquo;s a sniper back here</p>
<p>so I shot him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s we go from one position to another</p>
<p>and we kill lots of people.</p>
<p>Those things will change you.</p>
<p>And what that tends to do, not universally,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve read accounts from Red Army soldiers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very patriotic, right?</p>
<p>But a lot of that patriotism comes through years later</p>
<p>as part of the nostalgia and the remembering.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re down at that front 100 yards,</p>
<p>it is often boiled down to a very small world.</p>
<p>So your grandfather, was it your grandfather?</p>
<p>Grandfather.</p>
<p>At the machine gun, he&rsquo;s concerned about his position</p>
<p>and his comrades and the people</p>
<p>who he owes a responsibility to.</p>
<p>And those, it&rsquo;s a very small world at that point.</p>
<p>And to me, that&rsquo;s where the heroism is, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not fighting for some giant world,</p>
<p>civilizational thing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s fighting to save the people next to him.</p>
<p>And his own life at the same time</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re saving him too.</p>
<p>And that there is a huge amount of heroism to that.</p>
<p>And that gets to our question about force earlier.</p>
<p>Why would you use force?</p>
<p>Well, how about to protect these people</p>
<p>on either side of me, right?</p>
<p>Their lives.</p>
<p>Now, is there hatred?</p>
<p>Yeah, I hated the Germans for what they were doing.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I got a note from a poll</p>
<p>not that long ago.</p>
<p>And I have this tendency to refer to the Nazis, right?</p>
<p>The regime that was, and he said,</p>
<p>why do you keep calling them Nazis?</p>
<p>He says, say what they were.</p>
<p>They were Germans.</p>
<p>And this guy wanted me to not absolve Germany</p>
<p>by saying, oh, it was this awful group of people</p>
<p>that took over your country.</p>
<p>He said, the Germans did this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that bitterness where he says,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not forget what they did to us</p>
<p>and what we had to do back, right?</p>
<p>So for me, when we talk about these combat situations,</p>
<p>the reason I call these people heroic is because of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fighting to defend things we could all understand.</p>
<p>I mean, if you come after my brother</p>
<p>and I take a machine gun and shoot you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna overrun me,</p>
<p>I mean, that becomes a situation</p>
<p>where we talked about counterforce earlier.</p>
<p>Much easier to call yourself a hero</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re saving people</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re saving this town right behind you.</p>
<p>And you know, if they get through your machine gun,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna burn these villages.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna throw these people out</p>
<p>in the middle of winter, these families.</p>
<p>That to me is a very different sort of heroism</p>
<p>than this amorphous idea of patriotism.</p>
<p>And you know, patriotism is a thing</p>
<p>that we often get used with, right?</p>
<p>People manipulate us through love of country and all this</p>
<p>because they understand</p>
<p>that this is something we feel very strongly,</p>
<p>but they use it against us sometimes</p>
<p>in order to whip up a war fever or to get people.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a great line</p>
<p>and I wish I could remember it in its entirety</p>
<p>that Herman Goering had said about how easy it was</p>
<p>to get the people into a war.</p>
<p>He says, you know, you just appeal to their patriotism,</p>
<p>you, I mean, there&rsquo;s buttons that you can push</p>
<p>and they take advantage of things like love of country</p>
<p>and the way we have a loyalty and an admiration</p>
<p>to the warriors who put their lives on the line.</p>
<p>These are manipulatable things in the human species</p>
<p>that reliably can be counted on to move us</p>
<p>in directions that in a more sober, reflective state of mind</p>
<p>we would consider differently.</p>
<p>It gets the, I mean, you get this war fever up</p>
<p>and people wave flags and they start denouncing the enemy</p>
<p>and they start signing, you know, we&rsquo;ve seen it over</p>
<p>and over and over again in ancient times this happened.</p>
<p>But the love of country is also beautiful.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t seen it in America as much.</p>
<p>So people in America love their country,</p>
<p>like this patriotism is strong in America,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as strong as I remember,</p>
<p>even with my sort of being younger,</p>
<p>the love of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Now, was it the Soviet Union this requires a distinction</p>
<p>or was it mother Russia?</p>
<p>What it really was, was the communist party.</p>
<p>Okay, so it was the system in place, okay.</p>
<p>The system in place, like loving,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t quite deeply synchronized exactly what you love.</p>
<p>I think you love that like populist message of the worker,</p>
<p>of the common man, the common person.</p>
<p>Let me draw the comparison then.</p>
<p>And I often say this, that the United States</p>
<p>like the Soviet Union is an ideological based society, right?</p>
<p>So you take a country like France,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter which French government you&rsquo;re in now.</p>
<p>The French have been the French for a long time, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not based on an ideology, right?</p>
<p>Whereas what unites the United States is an ideology,</p>
<p>freedom, liberty, the constitution.</p>
<p>This is what draws, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the e pluribus unum kind of the idea, right?</p>
<p>That out of many one, well, what binds</p>
<p>all these unique different people?</p>
<p>The shared beliefs, this ideology.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was the same way.</p>
<p>Cause as you know, the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>Russia was merely one part of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And if you believe the rhetoric until Stalin&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>everybody was going to be united</p>
<p>under this ideological banner someday, right?</p>
<p>It was a global revolution.</p>
<p>So ideological societies are different.</p>
<p>And to be a fan of the ideological framework and goal,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a Liberty person, right?</p>
<p>I would like to see everybody in the world</p>
<p>have my system of government,</p>
<p>which is part of a bias, right?</p>
<p>Because they might not want that.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s better for everyone</p>
<p>cause I think it&rsquo;s better for me.</p>
<p>At the same time, when the ideology,</p>
<p>if you consider, and you know,</p>
<p>this stems from ideas of the enlightenment</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a bias there.</p>
<p>So my bias are toward the, but you feel,</p>
<p>and this is why you say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to bring freedom to Iraq.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to bring freedom to here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to bring freedom</p>
<p>because we think we&rsquo;re spreading to you</p>
<p>something that is just undeniably positive.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to free you and give you this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to wipe my own bias away from there, right?</p>
<p>Cause if I were in Iraq, for example,</p>
<p>I would want freedom, right?</p>
<p>But if you then leave and let the Iraqis vote</p>
<p>for whomever they want,</p>
<p>are they going to vote for somebody that will,</p>
<p>I mean, you know, you look at Russia now</p>
<p>and I hear from Russians quite a bit</p>
<p>because so much of my views on Russia</p>
<p>and the Soviet Union were formed in my formative years.</p>
<p>And, you know, we were not hearing from many people</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union back then, but now you do.</p>
<p>You hear from Russians today who will say,</p>
<p>your views on Stalin are archaic and cold.</p>
<p>You know, so you try to reorient your beliefs a little bit,</p>
<p>but it goes to this idea of,</p>
<p>if you gave the people in Russia a free and fair vote,</p>
<p>will they vote for somebody who promises them</p>
<p>a free and open society</p>
<p>based on enlightenment democratic principles?</p>
<p>Or will they vote for somebody,</p>
<p>we in the US would go, what are they doing?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re voting for some strong man who&rsquo;s just good.</p>
<p>You know, so I think it&rsquo;s very hard to throw away</p>
<p>our own biases and preconceptions.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s an all eye of the beholder kind of thing.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re talking about ideological societies,</p>
<p>it is very difficult to throw off</p>
<p>all the years of indoctrination</p>
<p>into the superiority of your system.</p>
<p>I mean, listen, in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>Marxism one way or another was part of every classrooms.</p>
<p>You know, you could be studying geometry</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll throw Marxism in there somehow,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what united the society.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what gave it a higher purpose.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what made it in the minds of the people</p>
<p>who were its defenders,</p>
<p>a superior, morally superior system.</p>
<p>And we do the same thing here.</p>
<p>In fact, most people do, but see, you&rsquo;re still French,</p>
<p>no matter what the ideology or the government might be.</p>
<p>So in that sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny that there would be a cold war</p>
<p>with these two systems,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re both ideologically based systems</p>
<p>involving peoples of many different backgrounds</p>
<p>who are united under the umbrella of the ideology.</p>
<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s brilliantly put.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a funny position that in my formative years,</p>
<p>I came here when I was 13,</p>
<p>is when I, you know, teenage is your first love or whatever,</p>
<p>is I fell in love with the American set of ideas</p>
<p>of freedom and individuals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re compelling, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>Yes. They&rsquo;re compelling, yes.</p>
<p>But I also remember, it&rsquo;s like you remember</p>
<p>like maybe an ex girlfriend or something like that.</p>
<p>I also remember loving as a very different human,</p>
<p>the Soviet idea, like we had the national anthem,</p>
<p>which is still, I think the most badass national anthem,</p>
<p>which is the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>like saying we&rsquo;re the indestructible nation.</p>
<p>I mean, just the words are so,</p>
<p>like Americans words are like, oh, we&rsquo;re nice.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re freedom,</p>
<p>but like a Russian Soviet Union national anthem was like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bad motherfuckers.</p>
<p>Nobody will destroy us.</p>
<p>I just remember feeling pride in a nation as a kid,</p>
<p>like dumb not knowing anything</p>
<p>because we all had to recite the stuff.</p>
<p>It was, there&rsquo;s a uniformity to everything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s pride underlying everything.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think about all the destructive nature</p>
<p>of the bureaucracy, the incompetence,</p>
<p>the, you know, all the things that come</p>
<p>with the implementation of communism,</p>
<p>especially around the eighties and nineties.</p>
<p>But I remember what it&rsquo;s like to love that set of ideas.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in a funny place of like,</p>
<p>remember like switching the love</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m, you know,</p>
<p>I kind of joke around about being Russian,</p>
<p>but you know, my longterm monogamous relationship</p>
<p>is now with the idea, the American ideal.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m stuck with it in my mind,</p>
<p>but I remember what it was like to love it.</p>
<p>And I think about that too,</p>
<p>when people criticize China or they criticize</p>
<p>the current state of affairs with how Stalin is remembered</p>
<p>and how Putin is to know that the,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t always wear the American ideal of individualism,</p>
<p>radical individualism and freedom</p>
<p>in analyzing the ways of the world elsewhere.</p>
<p>Like in China, in Russia, that it does,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t take yourself too seriously,</p>
<p>as Americans all do, as I do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a beautiful love to have for your government,</p>
<p>to believe in the nation, to let go of yourself</p>
<p>and your rights and your freedoms,</p>
<p>to believe in something bigger than yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually, that&rsquo;s a kind of freedom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re actually liberating yourself.</p>
<p>If you think like life is suffering,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving into the flow of the water,</p>
<p>the flow, the way of the world</p>
<p>by giving away more power from yourself</p>
<p>and giving it to what you would conceive as,</p>
<p>as the power of the people together,</p>
<p>together we&rsquo;ll do great things</p>
<p>and really believing in the ideals of what,</p>
<p>in this case, I don&rsquo;t even know what you would call Russia,</p>
<p>but whatever the heck that is,</p>
<p>authoritarian, powerful state, powerful leader,</p>
<p>believing that can be as beautiful</p>
<p>as believing the American ideal.</p>
<p>Not just that, let me add to what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very, I spend a lot of time</p>
<p>trying to get out of my own biases.</p>
<p>It is a fruitless endeavor longterm,</p>
<p>but you try to be better than you normally are.</p>
<p>One of the critiques that China,</p>
<p>and I always, as an American,</p>
<p>I tend to think about this as their government, right?</p>
<p>This is a rationale that their government puts forward.</p>
<p>But what you just said is actually,</p>
<p>if you can make that viewpoint beautiful</p>
<p>is kind of a beautiful way of approaching it.</p>
<p>The Chinese would say that what we call human rights</p>
<p>in the United States and what we consider</p>
<p>to be everybody&rsquo;s birthright around the world</p>
<p>is instead Western rights.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the words they use, Western rights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fundamentally Western oriented,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go back to the enlightenment based ideas,</p>
<p>on what constitutes the rights of man.</p>
<p>And they would suggest that that&rsquo;s not internationally</p>
<p>and always applicable, right?</p>
<p>That you can make a case, and again, I don&rsquo;t believe this.</p>
<p>This runs against my own personal views,</p>
<p>but that you could make a case</p>
<p>that the collective wellbeing of a very large group</p>
<p>of people outweighs the individual needs</p>
<p>of any single person, especially if those things</p>
<p>are in conflict with each other, right?</p>
<p>If you cannot provide for the greater good</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s so individualistic,</p>
<p>well then really what is the better thing to do, right?</p>
<p>Is suppress individualism so everybody&rsquo;s better off?</p>
<p>I think trying to recognize how someone else might see that</p>
<p>is important if we want to, you know,</p>
<p>you had talked about eliminating war.</p>
<p>We talk about eliminating conflict.</p>
<p>The first need to do that is to try to understand</p>
<p>how someone else might view something differently</p>
<p>than yourself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m famously one of those people who buys in</p>
<p>to the ideas of traditional Americanism, right?</p>
<p>And look, what a lot of people who live today,</p>
<p>I mean, they would seem to think that things like patriotism</p>
<p>requires a belief in the strong military</p>
<p>and all these things we have today,</p>
<p>but that is a corruption of traditional Americanism,</p>
<p>which viewed all those things with suspicion</p>
<p>in the first hundred years of the Republic</p>
<p>because they saw it as an enemy to the very things</p>
<p>that Americans celebrated, right?</p>
<p>How could you have freedom and liberty</p>
<p>and individualistic expression</p>
<p>if you had an overriding military</p>
<p>that was always fighting wars</p>
<p>and the founders of this country looked to other examples</p>
<p>like Europe, for example,</p>
<p>and saw that standing militaries, for example,</p>
<p>standing armies were the enemy of liberty.</p>
<p>Well, we have a standing army now</p>
<p>and one that is totally interwoven in our entire society.</p>
<p>If you could go back in time and talk to John Quincy Adams,</p>
<p>right, early president of the United States</p>
<p>and show him what we have now,</p>
<p>he would think it was awful and horrible</p>
<p>and that somewhere along the line,</p>
<p>the Americans had lost their way</p>
<p>and forgotten what they were all about.</p>
<p>But we have so successfully interwoven</p>
<p>this modern military industrial complex</p>
<p>with the traditional benefits</p>
<p>of the American system and ideology</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;ve become intertwined in our thinking,</p>
<p>whereas 150 years ago, they were actually considered</p>
<p>to be at opposite polarities and a threat to one another.</p>
<p>So when you talk about the love of the nation,</p>
<p>I tend to be suspicious of those things.</p>
<p>I tend to be suspicious of government.</p>
<p>I tend to try very hard to not be manipulated</p>
<p>and I feel like a large part of what they do</p>
<p>is manipulation and propaganda.</p>
<p>And so I think a healthy skepticism of the nation state</p>
<p>is actually 100% Americanism</p>
<p>in the traditional sense of the word.</p>
<p>But I also have to recognize,</p>
<p>as you so eloquently stated,</p>
<p>Americanism is not necessarily universal at all.</p>
<p>And so I think we have to try to be more understanding.</p>
<p>See, the traditional American viewpoint</p>
<p>is that if a place like China</p>
<p>does not allow their people individual human rights,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re being denied something.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re being denied and 100 years ago,</p>
<p>they would have said they&rsquo;re God given rights.</p>
<p>Man is born free and if he&rsquo;s not free,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of something done to him, right?</p>
<p>The government has taken away his God given rights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting excited just listening to that.</p>
<p>Well, but I mean, I think the idea that this is universal</p>
<p>is in and of itself a bias.</p>
<p>Now, do I want freedom for everybody else?</p>
<p>I sure do.</p>
<p>But the people in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>who really bought into that</p>
<p>wanted the workers of the world to unite</p>
<p>and not be exploited by the greedy blood sucking people</p>
<p>who worked them to death and pocketed all of the fruits</p>
<p>of their labor.</p>
<p>If you frame it that way,</p>
<p>that sounds like justice as well, you know?</p>
<p>So it is an eye of the beholder sort of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about Vladimir Putin,</p>
<p>sort of while we&rsquo;re in this feeling and wave of empathy</p>
<p>and trying to understand others that are not like us.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I started this podcast</p>
<p>is because I believe that there&rsquo;s a few people</p>
<p>I could talk to.</p>
<p>Some of it is ego.</p>
<p>Some of it is stupidity.</p>
<p>Is there some people I could talk to</p>
<p>that not many others can talk to?</p>
<p>The one person I was always thinking about</p>
<p>was Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Do you still speak the language?</p>
<p>I speak the language very well.</p>
<p>That makes it even easier.</p>
<p>I mean, you might be appointed for that job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the context in which I&rsquo;m asking you this question.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>from a historical context?</p>
<p>Have you studied him?</p>
<p>Have you thought about him?</p>
<p>Yes, studied is a loaded word.</p>
<p>And again, I find it hard sometimes</p>
<p>to not filter things through an American lens.</p>
<p>So as an American,</p>
<p>I would say that the Russians should be allowed</p>
<p>to have any leader that they want to have.</p>
<p>But what an American would say is,</p>
<p>but there should be elections, right?</p>
<p>So if the Russians choose Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>and they keep choosing him, that&rsquo;s their business.</p>
<p>Where as an American, I would have a problem</p>
<p>is when that leader stops letting the Russians</p>
<p>make that decision.</p>
<p>And we would say, well, now you&rsquo;re no longer</p>
<p>ruling by the consent of the governed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve become the equivalent of a person</p>
<p>who may be oppressing your people.</p>
<p>You might as well be a dictator, right?</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a difference between a freely elected</p>
<p>and reelected and reelected and reelected dictator, right?</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s what they want.</p>
<p>And look, it would be silly to broad brush the Russians</p>
<p>like it would be silly to broad brush anyone, right?</p>
<p>Millions and millions of people</p>
<p>with different opinions amongst them all.</p>
<p>But they seem to like a strong person at the helm.</p>
<p>And listen, there&rsquo;s a giant chunk of Americans</p>
<p>who do too in their own country.</p>
<p>But an American would say, as long as the freedom of choice</p>
<p>is given to the Russians to decide this</p>
<p>and not taken away from them, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to say he was freely elected,</p>
<p>but a long time ago and we&rsquo;ve done away with elections</p>
<p>since then is a different story too.</p>
<p>So my attitude on Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>is if that&rsquo;s who the Russian people want</p>
<p>and you give them the choice, right?</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s only there because they keep electing him,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very different story.</p>
<p>When he stops offering them the option</p>
<p>of choosing him or not choosing him,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when it begins to look nefarious</p>
<p>to someone born and raised with the mindset</p>
<p>and the ideology that is an integral part of yours truly.</p>
<p>And that I can&rsquo;t, you can see gray areas</p>
<p>and nuance all you like, but it&rsquo;s hard to escape.</p>
<p>And you alluded to this too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to escape what was indoctrinated</p>
<p>into your bones in your formative years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, your bones are growing, right?</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t go back.</p>
<p>So to me, this is so much a part of who I am</p>
<p>that I have a hard time jettisoning that and saying,</p>
<p>oh no, Vladimir Putin not being elected anymore,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too much of a product of my upbringing to go there.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>But of course there&rsquo;s, like we were saying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gray areas, which is, I believe,</p>
<p>I have to think through this,</p>
<p>but I think there is a point at which Adolf Hitler</p>
<p>became the popular choice in Nazi Germany in the 30s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, in the same way, from an American perspective,</p>
<p>you can start to criticize some in a shallow way,</p>
<p>some in a deep way.</p>
<p>The way that Putin has maintained power</p>
<p>is by controlling the press.</p>
<p>So limiting one other freedom that we Americans value,</p>
<p>which is the freedom of the press or freedom of speech</p>
<p>that he, it is very possible.</p>
<p>Now things are changing now,</p>
<p>but for most of his presidency,</p>
<p>he was the popular choice and sometimes by far.</p>
<p>And I have, I actually don&rsquo;t have real family in Russia</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t love Putin.</p>
<p>The only people who write to me about Putin</p>
<p>and not liking him are like sort of activists</p>
<p>who are young, right?</p>
<p>But like to me, they&rsquo;re strangers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about them.</p>
<p>The people I do know who have a big family in Russia,</p>
<p>they love Putin.</p>
<p>They&hellip;</p>
<p>Do they miss elections?</p>
<p>Would they want the choice to prove it at the ballot box?</p>
<p>And, or are they so in love with him</p>
<p>that they wouldn&rsquo;t wanna take a chance</p>
<p>that someone might vote him out?</p>
<p>No, they don&rsquo;t think of it this way.</p>
<p>And they are aware of the incredible bureaucracy</p>
<p>and corruption that is lurking in the shadows,</p>
<p>which is true in Russia.</p>
<p>Everywhere.</p>
<p>But like, there&rsquo;s something about the Russian,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a remnants, corruption is so deeply part of the Russian,</p>
<p>so the Soviet system that even the overthrow of the Soviet,</p>
<p>the breaking apart of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and Putin coming and reforming a lot of the system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still deeply in there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re aware of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the, like the love for Putin</p>
<p>is partially grounded in the fear of what happens</p>
<p>when the corrupt take over, the greedy take over.</p>
<p>And they see Putin as the stabilizer,</p>
<p>as like a hard like force that says&hellip;</p>
<p>A counter force.</p>
<p>Counter force that get your shit together.</p>
<p>Like basically, from the Western perspective,</p>
<p>Putin is terrible, but from the Russian perspective,</p>
<p>Putin is the only thing holding this thing together</p>
<p>before it goes, if it collapses.</p>
<p>Now, from the, like Gary Kasparov has been loud on this,</p>
<p>a lot of people from the Western perspective say,</p>
<p>well, if it has to collapse, let it collapse.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s easier said than done</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have to live through that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so anyone worrying about their family about&hellip;</p>
<p>And they also remember the inflation</p>
<p>and the economic instability</p>
<p>and the suffering and the starvation</p>
<p>that happened in the 90s with the collapse</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And they saw the kind of reform</p>
<p>and the economic vibrancy that happened</p>
<p>when Putin took power,</p>
<p>that they think like, this guy&rsquo;s holding it together.</p>
<p>And they see elections as potentially</p>
<p>being mechanisms by which the corrupt people</p>
<p>can manipulate the system unfairly,</p>
<p>as opposed to letting the people speak with their voice.</p>
<p>They somehow figure out a way to manipulate the elections,</p>
<p>to elect somebody like one of them Western revolutionaries.</p>
<p>And so I think one of the beliefs</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important to the American system</p>
<p>is the belief in the electoral system</p>
<p>that the voice of the people can be heard</p>
<p>in the various systems of government,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s judicial, whether it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, basically the assumption is</p>
<p>that the system works well enough</p>
<p>for you to be able to elect the popular choice.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s a couple of things</p>
<p>that come to mind on that.</p>
<p>The first one has to do with the idea of oligarchs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a belief in political science,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s not the overall belief,</p>
<p>but that every society is sort of an oligarchy really,</p>
<p>if you break it down, right?</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re talking about are some of the people</p>
<p>who would form an oligarchic class in Russia,</p>
<p>and that Putin is the guy who can harness</p>
<p>the power of the state to keep those people in check.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, in a system like that,</p>
<p>a strong man system, right?</p>
<p>Where you have somebody who can hold the reins</p>
<p>and steer the ship when the ship is violently in a storm,</p>
<p>is the succession.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not creating a system</p>
<p>that can operate without you,</p>
<p>then that terrible instability and that terrible future</p>
<p>that you justify the strong man for</p>
<p>is just awaiting your future, right?</p>
<p>I mean, unless he&rsquo;s actively building the system</p>
<p>that will outlive him and allow successors</p>
<p>to do what he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>then what you&rsquo;ve done here is create a temporary,</p>
<p>I would think, a temporary stability here,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the same problem you have in a monarchy, right?</p>
<p>Where you have this one king and he&rsquo;s particularly good,</p>
<p>or you think he&rsquo;s particularly good,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s gonna turn that job over</p>
<p>to somebody else down the road,</p>
<p>and the system doesn&rsquo;t guarantee</p>
<p>because no one&rsquo;s really worked on,</p>
<p>and again, you would tell me,</p>
<p>if Putin is putting into place,</p>
<p>I know he&rsquo;s talked about it over the years,</p>
<p>putting into place a system that can outlive him</p>
<p>and that will create the stability</p>
<p>that the people in Russia like him for when he&rsquo;s gone,</p>
<p>because if the oligarchs just take over afterwards,</p>
<p>then one might argue,</p>
<p>well, we had 20 good years of stability,</p>
<p>but I mean, I would say</p>
<p>that if we&rsquo;re talking about a ship of state here,</p>
<p>the guy steering the ship, maybe,</p>
<p>if you wanted to look at it from the Russian point of view,</p>
<p>has done a great job, maybe, just saying,</p>
<p>but the rocks are still out there,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not going to be at the helm forever,</p>
<p>so one would think that his job is to make sure</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s going to be someone</p>
<p>who can continue to steer the ship</p>
<p>for the people of Russia after he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Now, let me ask, because I&rsquo;m curious,</p>
<p>and ignorant, so is he doing that, do you think?</p>
<p>Is he setting it up so that when there is no Putin,</p>
<p>the state is safe?</p>
<p>From the beginning, that was the idea,</p>
<p>whether one of the fascinating things,</p>
<p>now, I read every biography,</p>
<p>English written biography on Putin,</p>
<p>so I need to think more deeply,</p>
<p>but one of the fascinating things</p>
<p>is how did power change Vladimir Putin?</p>
<p>He was a different man when he took power than he is today.</p>
<p>I actually, in many ways, admire the man that took power.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s very different than Stalin and then Hitler</p>
<p>at the moment they took power.</p>
<p>I think Hitler and Stalin were both,</p>
<p>in our previous discussion,</p>
<p>already on the trajectory of evil.</p>
<p>I think Putin was a humble, loyal, honest man</p>
<p>when he took power.</p>
<p>The man he is today is worth thinking about and studying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an old line, though,</p>
<p>about absolute power corrupting, absolutely.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s kind of a line.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful quote,</p>
<p>but you have to really think about it.</p>
<p>Like, what does that actually mean?</p>
<p>Like, one of the things I still have to do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been focusing on securing the conversation, right?</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t gone through a dark place yet</p>
<p>because I feel like I can&rsquo;t do the dark thing for too long.</p>
<p>So I really have to put myself in the mind of Putin</p>
<p>leading up to the conversation.</p>
<p>But for now, my sense is he took power</p>
<p>when Yeltsin gave him,</p>
<p>one of the big sort of acts of the new Russia</p>
<p>was for the first time in its history,</p>
<p>a leader could have continued being in power</p>
<p>and chose to give away power.</p>
<p>That was the George Washington.</p>
<p>Right, we in the United States</p>
<p>would look at that as absolute positive, yeah.</p>
<p>A sign of good things, yes.</p>
<p>And so that was a huge act.</p>
<p>And Putin said that that was the defining thing</p>
<p>that will define Russia for the 21st century,</p>
<p>that act, and he will carry that flag forward.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why in rhetoric, he, after two terms,</p>
<p>he gave away power.</p>
<p>To Medvedev, but it was a puppet, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yes, but it was,</p>
<p>but like still the story was being told.</p>
<p>I think he believed it early on.</p>
<p>I think he, I believe he still believes it,</p>
<p>but I think he&rsquo;s deeply suspicious</p>
<p>of the corruption that lurks in the shadows.</p>
<p>And I do believe that,</p>
<p>like as somebody who thinks clickbait journalism is broken,</p>
<p>journalists annoy the hell out of me.</p>
<p>Clickbait journalism&rsquo;s working perfectly.</p>
<p>Journalism&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>Journalism.</p>
<p>Clickbait thing&rsquo;s working great.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So I understand from Putin&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>that journalism, journalists can be seen</p>
<p>as the enemy of the state,</p>
<p>because people think journalists write these deep,</p>
<p>beautiful philosophical pieces</p>
<p>about criticizing the structure of government</p>
<p>and the proper policy where, you know,</p>
<p>the steps that we need to take to make a greater nation.</p>
<p>No, they, they&rsquo;re unfairly take stuff out of context.</p>
<p>They, they&rsquo;re critical in ways</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like shallow and not interesting.</p>
<p>They, they call you a racist or sexist,</p>
<p>or they make up stuff all the time.</p>
<p>So I can put myself in the mindset of a person</p>
<p>that thinks that it is okay to remove</p>
<p>that kind of shallow fake news voice from the system.</p>
<p>The problem is, of course, that is a slippery slope</p>
<p>to then you remove all the annoying people from the system,</p>
<p>and then you change what annoying means,</p>
<p>which annoying starts becoming a thing</p>
<p>that like anyone who opposes the system.</p>
<p>I mean, I get, I get the slippery,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s obvious that it becomes a slippery slope,</p>
<p>but I can also put myself in the mindset</p>
<p>of the people that see it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>to remove the liars from the system,</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s good for Russia.</p>
<p>And, okay, so herein lies, and this again,</p>
<p>the traditional American perspective,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve had yellow, so called yellow journalism</p>
<p>since the founding of the Republic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nothing new.</p>
<p>But, but the problem then comes into play,</p>
<p>when you remove journalists, even, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a broad brush thing,</p>
<p>because you remove both the crappy ones who are lying,</p>
<p>and the ones who are telling the truth too,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re left with simply the approved government journalists,</p>
<p>right, the ones who are towing the government&rsquo;s line,</p>
<p>in which case the truth as you see it</p>
<p>is a different kind of fake news, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fake news from the government,</p>
<p>instead of the clickbait news,</p>
<p>and oh yeah, maybe truth mixed into all that too,</p>
<p>in some of the outlets.</p>
<p>The problem I always have with our system</p>
<p>here in the United States right now</p>
<p>is trying to tease the truth out from all the falsehoods.</p>
<p>And look, I&rsquo;ve got 30 years in journalism.</p>
<p>My job used to be to go through, before the internet,</p>
<p>all the newspapers, and find the,</p>
<p>I used to know all the journalists by name,</p>
<p>and I could pick out, you know, who they were,</p>
<p>and I have a hard time picking out the truth</p>
<p>from the falsehoods, so I think constantly,</p>
<p>how are people who don&rsquo;t have all this background,</p>
<p>who have lives, or who are trained in other specialties,</p>
<p>how do they do it?</p>
<p>But if the government is the only approved outlet for truth,</p>
<p>a traditional American,</p>
<p>and a lot of other traditional societies</p>
<p>based on these ideas of the Enlightenment</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>would see that as a disaster waiting to happen,</p>
<p>or a tyranny in progress.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Oh, it totally makes sense,</p>
<p>and I would agree with you, I still agree with you,</p>
<p>but it is clear that something about the freedom</p>
<p>of the press and freedom of speech in today,</p>
<p>like literally the last few years</p>
<p>with the internet is changing,</p>
<p>and the argument, you know,</p>
<p>you could say that the American system</p>
<p>of freedom of speech is broken,</p>
<p>because the, here&rsquo;s the belief I grew up on,</p>
<p>and I still hold, but I&rsquo;m starting to be sort of</p>
<p>trying to see multiple views on it.</p>
<p>My belief was that freedom of speech results</p>
<p>in a stable trajectory towards truth always.</p>
<p>So like truth will emerge.</p>
<p>That was my sort of faith and belief</p>
<p>that yeah, there&rsquo;s going to be lies all over the place,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll be like a stable thing that is true,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s carried forward to the public.</p>
<p>Now it feels like it&rsquo;s possible to go towards a world</p>
<p>where nothing is true,</p>
<p>where truth is something that groups of people</p>
<p>convince themselves of,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s multiple groups of people,</p>
<p>and the idea of some universal truth,</p>
<p>as I suppose is the better thing,</p>
<p>is something that we can no longer exist under.</p>
<p>Like some people believe that the Green Bay Packers</p>
<p>is the best football team,</p>
<p>and some people can think the Patriots,</p>
<p>and they deeply believe it</p>
<p>to where they call the other groups liars.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s fun for sports,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fun for favorite flavors of ice cream,</p>
<p>but they might believe that about science,</p>
<p>about the various aspects of politics,</p>
<p>various aspects of sort of different policies</p>
<p>within the function of our government.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s not just like</p>
<p>some weird thing we&rsquo;ll complain about,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;ll be the nature of things,</p>
<p>like truth is something we can no longer have.</p>
<p>Well, and let me de romanticize</p>
<p>the American history of this too,</p>
<p>because the American press was often just as biased,</p>
<p>just as, I mean, I always looked to the 1970s</p>
<p>as the high watermark of the American journalistic,</p>
<p>in the post Watergate era,</p>
<p>where it was actively going after the abuses</p>
<p>of the government and all these things.</p>
<p>But there was a famous speech, very quiet though,</p>
<p>very quiet, given by Katherine Graham,</p>
<p>who was a Washington Post editor, I believe.</p>
<p>And I actually, somebody sent it to me,</p>
<p>we had to get it off of a journalism,</p>
<p>like a J store kind of thing.</p>
<p>And she, at a luncheon,</p>
<p>assured to the government people at the luncheon,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry, this is not gonna be something</p>
<p>that we make a trend.</p>
<p>Because the position of the government</p>
<p>is still something that was carried,</p>
<p>that the newspapers were the water,</p>
<p>and the newspapers were the big thing</p>
<p>up until certainly the late 60s, early 70s.</p>
<p>The newspapers were still the water carrier</p>
<p>of the government, right?</p>
<p>And they were the water carriers</p>
<p>of the owners of the newspaper.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s not pretend there was some angelic, wonderful time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying to me,</p>
<p>cause I was the one who brought it up,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not pretend there was any super age</p>
<p>of truthful journalism and all that.</p>
<p>And I mean, you go to the revolutionary period</p>
<p>in American history,</p>
<p>and it looks every bit as bad as today, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hopeful message, actually.</p>
<p>So things may not be as bad as they look.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s look at it more like a stock market,</p>
<p>and that you have fluctuations in the truthfulness</p>
<p>or believability of the press.</p>
<p>And there are periods where it was higher</p>
<p>than other periods.</p>
<p>The funny thing about the so called clickbait era,</p>
<p>and I do think it&rsquo;s terrible,</p>
<p>but I mean, it resembles earlier eras to me.</p>
<p>So I always compare it to when I was a kid growing up,</p>
<p>when I thought journalism was as good as it&rsquo;s ever gotten.</p>
<p>It was never perfect.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also something that you see very rarely</p>
<p>in other governments around the world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a reason that journalists</p>
<p>are often killed regularly in a lot of countries.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because they report on things</p>
<p>that the authorities do not want reported on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always thought that</p>
<p>that was what journalism should do.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s gotta be truthful,</p>
<p>otherwise it&rsquo;s just a different kind of propaganda, right?</p>
<p>Can we talk about Genghis Khan?</p>
<p>Genghis Khan?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>By the way, is it Genghis Khan or Genghis Khan?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either Genghis Khan or Chinggis Khan.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go with Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;ll be able to say</p>
<p>with any certain, last certain thing I&rsquo;ll say about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know, GIF versus GIF.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know about those things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it ever got started the wrong way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So first of all, your episodes on Genghis Khan</p>
<p>for many people are the favorite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think about events</p>
<p>that had so much like in their ripples,</p>
<p>had so much impact on so much of human civilization.</p>
<p>In your view, was he an evil man?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go start a discussion of evil.</p>
<p>Another way to put it is I&rsquo;ve read he&rsquo;s much loved</p>
<p>in many parts of the world like Mongolia.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve also read arguments that say</p>
<p>that he was quite a progressive for the time.</p>
<p>So where do you put him?</p>
<p>Is he a progressive or is he an evil destroyer of humans?</p>
<p>As I often say, I&rsquo;m not a historian,</p>
<p>which is why what I try to bring</p>
<p>to the Hardcore History podcasts are these sub themes.</p>
<p>So each show has, and they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>I try to kind of soft pedal them.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not always like really right in front</p>
<p>of your face.</p>
<p>In that episode, the soft peddling sub theme had to do</p>
<p>with what we referred to as a historical arsonist.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because some historians have taken the position</p>
<p>that sometimes, and most of this is earlier stuff,</p>
<p>historians don&rsquo;t do this very much anymore,</p>
<p>but these were the wonderful questions I grew up with</p>
<p>that blend, it&rsquo;s almost the intersection</p>
<p>between history and philosophy.</p>
<p>And the idea was that sometimes the world has become</p>
<p>so overwhelmed with bureaucracy or corruption</p>
<p>or just stagnation that somebody has to come in</p>
<p>or some group of people or some force has to come in</p>
<p>and do the equivalent of a forest fire</p>
<p>to clear out all the dead wood</p>
<p>so that the forest itself can be rejuvenated</p>
<p>and society can then move forward.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of these periods where the historians</p>
<p>of the past will portray these figures who come in</p>
<p>and do horrific things as creating an almost service</p>
<p>for mankind, right?</p>
<p>Creating the foundations for a new world</p>
<p>that will be better than the old one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a recurring theme.</p>
<p>And so this was the sub theme of the Khan&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>because otherwise you don&rsquo;t need me to tell you the story</p>
<p>of the Mongols, but I&rsquo;m gonna bring up</p>
<p>the historical arsonist element.</p>
<p>And, but this gets to how the Khan has been portrayed,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>If you wanna say, oh yes, he cleared out the dead wood</p>
<p>and made for, well, then it&rsquo;s a positive thing.</p>
<p>If you say, my family was in the forest fire that he set,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna see it that way.</p>
<p>Much of what Genghis Khan is credited with</p>
<p>on the upside, right?</p>
<p>So things like religious toleration,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll say, well, he was religiously,</p>
<p>the Mongols were religiously tolerant.</p>
<p>And so this makes them almost like a liberal reformer</p>
<p>kind of thing.</p>
<p>But this needs to be seen within the context</p>
<p>of their empire, which was very much</p>
<p>like the Roman viewpoint,</p>
<p>which is the Romans didn&rsquo;t care at a lot of time</p>
<p>what your local people worshiped.</p>
<p>They wanted stability.</p>
<p>And if that kept stability and kept you paying taxes</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t require the legionaries to come in,</p>
<p>then they didn&rsquo;t care, right?</p>
<p>And the Khans were the same way.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;re practicing</p>
<p>as long as it doesn&rsquo;t disrupt their empire</p>
<p>and cause them trouble.</p>
<p>But what I always like to point out is yes,</p>
<p>but the Khan could still come in with his representatives</p>
<p>to your town, decide your daughter was a beautiful woman</p>
<p>that they wanted in the Khan&rsquo;s concubine,</p>
<p>and they would take them.</p>
<p>So how liberal an empire is this, right?</p>
<p>So many of the things that they get credit for</p>
<p>as though there&rsquo;s some kind of nice guys</p>
<p>may in another way of looking at it</p>
<p>just be a simple mechanism of control, right?</p>
<p>A way to keep the empire stable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not doing it out of the goodness of their heart.</p>
<p>They have decided that this is the best.</p>
<p>And I love because the Mongols were what we would call</p>
<p>a pagan people now.</p>
<p>I love the fact that they, and I think we call it,</p>
<p>I forgot the term we used, had to do with,</p>
<p>like they were hedging their bets religiously, right?</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know which God was the right one.</p>
<p>So as long as you&rsquo;re all praying for the health of the Khan,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re maximizing the chances that whoever the gods are,</p>
<p>they get the message, right?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s been portrayed as something</p>
<p>like a liberal empire.</p>
<p>And the idea of Mongol universality</p>
<p>is more about conquering the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like saying, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna bring stability to the world by conquering it.</p>
<p>Well, what if that&rsquo;s Hitler, right?</p>
<p>He could make the same case,</p>
<p>or Hitler wasn&rsquo;t really the world conqueror like that</p>
<p>because he wouldn&rsquo;t have been trying</p>
<p>to make it equal for all peoples.</p>
<p>But my point being that it kind of takes</p>
<p>the positive moral slant out of it</p>
<p>if their motivation wasn&rsquo;t a positive moral slant</p>
<p>to the motivate, and the Mongols didn&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p>And I think the way that it&rsquo;s portrayed is like,</p>
<p>and I always like to use this analogy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like shooting an arrow</p>
<p>and painting a bull&rsquo;s eye around it afterwards, right?</p>
<p>How do we justify and make them look good in a way</p>
<p>that they themselves probably,</p>
<p>and listen, we don&rsquo;t have the Mongol point of view per se.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something called the secret history</p>
<p>of the Mongols, and there&rsquo;s things written down</p>
<p>by Mongolian overlords through people</p>
<p>like Persian and Chinese scribes later.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have their point of view,</p>
<p>but it sure doesn&rsquo;t look like this was an attempt</p>
<p>to create some wonderful place</p>
<p>where everybody was living a better life</p>
<p>than they were before.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s later people putting a nice rosy spin on it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an aspect to it, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m projecting sort of my idea</p>
<p>of what it would take to conquer so much land</p>
<p>is the ideology is emergent.</p>
<p>So if I were to guess,</p>
<p>the Mongols started out as exceptionally,</p>
<p>as warriors who valued excellence in skill of killing,</p>
<p>not even killing, but like the actual practice of war.</p>
<p>And you can start out small,</p>
<p>and you can grow and grow and grow.</p>
<p>And then in order to maintain the stability</p>
<p>of the things over which of the conquered lands,</p>
<p>you developed a set of ideas with which you can,</p>
<p>like you said, establish control, but it was emergent.</p>
<p>And it seems like the core first principle idea</p>
<p>of the Mongols is just to be excellent warriors.</p>
<p>That felt to me like the starting point.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t some ideology.</p>
<p>Like with Hitler and Stalin,</p>
<p>with Hitler, there was an ideology</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with war underneath it.</p>
<p>It was more about conquering.</p>
<p>It feels like the Mongols started out more organically,</p>
<p>I would say, like this phenomenon started emergently,</p>
<p>and they were just like similar to the Native Americans</p>
<p>with the Comanches, like the different warrior tribes</p>
<p>that Joe Rogan&rsquo;s currently obsessed with,</p>
<p>that led me to look into it more.</p>
<p>They seem to just start out just valuing the skill</p>
<p>of fighting whatever the tools of war they had,</p>
<p>which were pretty primitive,</p>
<p>but just to be the best warriors</p>
<p>they could possibly be, make a science out of it.</p>
<p>Is that crazy to think that there was no ideology behind it</p>
<p>in the beginning?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna back up a second.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the line said about the Romans,</p>
<p>that they create a wasteland and call it peace.</p>
<p>That is, but there&rsquo;s a lot of conquerors like that, right?</p>
<p>Where you will sit there, and listen,</p>
<p>historians forever have, it&rsquo;s the famous trade offs</p>
<p>of empire, and they&rsquo;ll say, well,</p>
<p>look at the trade that they facilitated,</p>
<p>and look at the religion, all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but they come at the cost of all those peoples</p>
<p>that they conquered forcibly and by force,</p>
<p>integrated into their empire.</p>
<p>The one thing we need to remember about the Mongols</p>
<p>that makes them different than, say, the Romans,</p>
<p>and this is complex stuff and way above my pay grade,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m fascinated with it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more like the Comanches that you just brought up,</p>
<p>is that the Mongols are not a settled society, okay?</p>
<p>They come from a nomadic tradition.</p>
<p>Now, several generations later,</p>
<p>when you have Kublai Khan as the emperor of China,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s beginning to be a different thing, right?</p>
<p>And the Mongols, when their empire broke up,</p>
<p>the ones that were in settled,</p>
<p>the so called settled societies, right, Iran,</p>
<p>places like that, they will become more like,</p>
<p>over time, the rulers of those places were traditionally,</p>
<p>and the Mongols in, say, the Khaganate of the Golden Horde,</p>
<p>which is still in their traditional nomadic territories,</p>
<p>will remain traditionally more Mongol,</p>
<p>but when you start talking about who the Mongols were,</p>
<p>I try to make a distinction.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not some really super special people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just the latest confederacy in an area</p>
<p>that saw nomadic confederacies going back</p>
<p>to the beginning of recorded history.</p>
<p>The Scythians, the Sarmatians, the Avars,</p>
<p>the Huns, the Magyars, I mean, these are all the nomadic,</p>
<p>you know, the nomads of the Eurasian steppe</p>
<p>were huge, huge players in the history of the world</p>
<p>until gunpowder nullified their traditional weapons system,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve been fascinated with</p>
<p>because their traditional weapons system</p>
<p>is not one you could copy,</p>
<p>because you were talking about being the greatest warriors</p>
<p>you could be.</p>
<p>Every warrior society I&rsquo;ve ever seen values that.</p>
<p>What the nomads had of the Eurasian steppe</p>
<p>was this relationship between human beings and animals</p>
<p>that changed the equation.</p>
<p>It was how they rode horses.</p>
<p>And societies like the Byzantines,</p>
<p>which would form one flank of the steppe</p>
<p>and then all the way on the other side you had China,</p>
<p>and below that you had Persia,</p>
<p>these societies would all attempt</p>
<p>to create mounted horsemen who used archery.</p>
<p>And they did a good job,</p>
<p>but they were never the equals of the nomads</p>
<p>because those people were literally raised in the saddle.</p>
<p>They compared them to centaurs.</p>
<p>The Comanches, great example,</p>
<p>considered to be the best horse riding warriors</p>
<p>in North America.</p>
<p>The Comanches, I always love watching, there&rsquo;s paintings.</p>
<p>George Catlin, the famous painter</p>
<p>who painted the Comanches, illustrated it.</p>
<p>But the Mongols and the Scythians and the Avars</p>
<p>and all these people did it too,</p>
<p>where they would shoot from underneath the horse&rsquo;s neck,</p>
<p>hiding behind the horse the whole way.</p>
<p>You look at a picture of somebody doing that,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>This is what the Byzantines couldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>and the Chinese couldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>It was a different level of harnessing</p>
<p>a human animal relationship</p>
<p>that gave them a military advantage</p>
<p>that could not be copied, right?</p>
<p>It could be emulated, but they were never as good, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they always hired these people.</p>
<p>They hired mercenaries from these areas</p>
<p>because they were incomparable, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the combination of people who were shooting bows</p>
<p>and arrows from the time they were toddlers,</p>
<p>who were riding from the time they were,</p>
<p>who rode all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, the Huns were bow legged, the Romans said,</p>
<p>because they were never,</p>
<p>they ate, slept, everything in the saddle.</p>
<p>That creates something that is difficult to copy.</p>
<p>And it gave them a military advantage.</p>
<p>I enjoy reading actually about</p>
<p>when that military advantage ended.</p>
<p>So 17th and 18th century,</p>
<p>when the Chinese on one flank and the Russians on the other</p>
<p>are beginning to use firearms and stuff</p>
<p>to break this military power of these various Khans.</p>
<p>The Mongols were simply the most dominating</p>
<p>and most successful of the Confederacies.</p>
<p>But if you break it down,</p>
<p>they really formed the nucleus at the top of the pyramid,</p>
<p>of the apex of the food chain.</p>
<p>And a lot of the people that were known as Mongols</p>
<p>were really lots of other tribes, non Mongolian tribes,</p>
<p>that when the Mongols conquer you,</p>
<p>after they killed a lot of you,</p>
<p>they incorporated you into their Confederacy</p>
<p>and often made you go first.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna fight somebody,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna make these people go out in front</p>
<p>and suck up all the arrows</p>
<p>before we go in and finish the job.</p>
<p>So to me, and I guess a fan of the Mongols would say</p>
<p>that the difference and what made the Mongols different</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the weapon system or the fighting</p>
<p>or the warriors or the armor or anything,</p>
<p>it was Genghis Khan.</p>
<p>And if you go look at the other really dangerous,</p>
<p>from the outside world&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>dangerous step, nomadic Confederacies from past history</p>
<p>was always when some great leader emerged</p>
<p>that could unite the tribes.</p>
<p>And you see the same thing in Native American history</p>
<p>to a degree too.</p>
<p>You had people like Attila, right?</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s one called Tumen.</p>
<p>You go back in history and these people</p>
<p>make the history books because they caused</p>
<p>an enormous amount of trouble for their settled neighbors</p>
<p>that normally, I mean, Chinese Byzantine and Persian</p>
<p>approaches to the steppe people were always the same.</p>
<p>They would pick out tribes to be friendly with,</p>
<p>they would give them money, gifts, hire them,</p>
<p>and they would use them against the other tribes.</p>
<p>And generally Byzantine,</p>
<p>especially in Chinese diplomatic history</p>
<p>was all about keeping these tribes separated.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let them form confederations of large numbers of them</p>
<p>because then they&rsquo;re unstoppable.</p>
<p>Attila was a perfect example.</p>
<p>The Huns were another large,</p>
<p>the Turks, another large confederacy of these people.</p>
<p>And they were devastating when they could unite.</p>
<p>So the diplomatic policy was don&rsquo;t let them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what made the Mongols different</p>
<p>is Genghis Khan united them.</p>
<p>And then unlike most of the tribal confederacies,</p>
<p>they were able to hold it together for a few generations.</p>
<p>To linger on the little thread that you started pulling</p>
<p>on this man, Genghis Khan, that was a leader.</p>
<p>Temujin, yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think makes a great leader?</p>
<p>Maybe if you have other examples throughout history</p>
<p>and great, again, let&rsquo;s use that term loosely.</p>
<p>Meaning.</p>
<p>Now I was gonna ask for a definition.</p>
<p>Great uniter of whether it&rsquo;s evil or good,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Is there somebody who stands out to you,</p>
<p>Alexander the Great talking about military or ideologies,</p>
<p>some people bring up FDR or, I mean,</p>
<p>you could be the founding fathers of this country,</p>
<p>or we can go to, was he man of the century up there?</p>
<p>Hitler of the 20th century and Stalin</p>
<p>and these people had really amassed the amount of power</p>
<p>that probably has never been seen</p>
<p>in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Is there somebody who stands out to you</p>
<p>by way of trying to define what makes a great uniter,</p>
<p>great leader in one man or woman, maybe in the future?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>And one I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about,</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s take Alexander the Great as an example,</p>
<p>because Alexander fascinated the world of his time,</p>
<p>fascinated, ever since people have been fascinated</p>
<p>with the guy.</p>
<p>But Alexander was a hereditary monarch, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He was handed the kingdom.</p>
<p>Which is fascinating.</p>
<p>Right, but he did not need to rise from nothing</p>
<p>to get that job.</p>
<p>In fact, he reminds me of a lot of other leaders</p>
<p>of Frederick the Great, for example, in Prussia.</p>
<p>These are people who inherited</p>
<p>the greatest army of their day.</p>
<p>Alexander, unless he was an imbecile,</p>
<p>was going to be great no matter what,</p>
<p>because I mean, if you inherit the Wehrmacht,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to do something with it, right?</p>
<p>Alexander&rsquo;s father may have been greater, Philip.</p>
<p>Philip II was the guy who literally did create</p>
<p>a strong kingdom from a disjointed group of people</p>
<p>that were continually beset by their neighbors.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the one that reformed that army,</p>
<p>took things that he had learned from other Greek leaders</p>
<p>like the Theban leader at Paminondas,</p>
<p>and then laboriously over his lifetime</p>
<p>stabilized the frontiers, built this system.</p>
<p>He lost an eye doing it.</p>
<p>His leg was made lame.</p>
<p>I mean, this was a man who looked like he built the empire</p>
<p>and led from the front ranks.</p>
<p>I mean, and then who may have been killed by his son,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know who assassinated Philip,</p>
<p>but then handed the greatest army</p>
<p>the world had ever seen to his son,</p>
<p>who then did great things with it.</p>
<p>You see this pattern many times.</p>
<p>So in my mind, I&rsquo;m not sure Alexander</p>
<p>really can be that great when you compare him</p>
<p>to people who arose from nothing.</p>
<p>So the difference between what we would call</p>
<p>in the United States the self made man</p>
<p>or the one who inherits a fortune.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an old line that, it&rsquo;s a slur,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about rich people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like he was born on third base</p>
<p>and thought he hit a triple, right?</p>
<p>Philip was born at home plate and he had to hit.</p>
<p>Alexander started on third base.</p>
<p>And so I try to draw a distinction between them.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan is tough because there&rsquo;s two traditions.</p>
<p>The tradition that we grew up with here</p>
<p>in the United States and that I grew up learning</p>
<p>was that he was a self made man.</p>
<p>But there is a tradition,</p>
<p>and it may be one of those things that&rsquo;s put after the fact</p>
<p>because a long time ago, whether or not you had blue blood</p>
<p>in your veins was an important distinction.</p>
<p>And so the distinction that you&rsquo;ll often hear</p>
<p>from Mongolian history is that this was a nobleman</p>
<p>who had been deprived of his inheritance.</p>
<p>So he was a blue blood anyway.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which is true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly, I mean, when you look at a Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>you have to go, that is a wicked amount of things</p>
<p>to have achieved.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very impressive as a figure.</p>
<p>Attila is very impressive as a figure.</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s an interesting figure.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of those people,</p>
<p>you know, the more you study about Hitler,</p>
<p>the more you wonder where the defining moment was.</p>
<p>Because if you look at his life,</p>
<p>I mean, Hitler was a relatively common soldier</p>
<p>in the First World War.</p>
<p>I mean, he was brave.</p>
<p>He got some decorations.</p>
<p>In fact, the highest decoration he got</p>
<p>in the First World War was given to him by a Jewish officer.</p>
<p>And he often didn&rsquo;t talk about that decoration,</p>
<p>even though it was the more prestigious one</p>
<p>because it would open up a whole can of worms</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t wanna get into.</p>
<p>But Hitler&rsquo;s, I mean, if you said who was Hitler today,</p>
<p>one of the top things you&rsquo;re gonna say</p>
<p>is he was an anti Semite.</p>
<p>Well, then you have to draw a distinction</p>
<p>between general regular anti Semitism</p>
<p>that was pretty common in the era</p>
<p>and something that was a rabid level of anti Semitism.</p>
<p>But Hitler didn&rsquo;t seem to show a rabid level</p>
<p>of anti Semitism until after</p>
<p>or at the very end of the First World War.</p>
<p>So if this is a defining part of this person&rsquo;s character</p>
<p>and much of what we consider to be his evil</p>
<p>stems from that, what happened to this guy</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s an adult, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already fought in the war to change him so.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s almost like the old,</p>
<p>there was always a movie theme.</p>
<p>Somebody gets hit by something on the head</p>
<p>and their whole personality changes, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it almost seems something like that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think I call that necessarily a great leader.</p>
<p>To me, the interesting thing about Hitler</p>
<p>is what the hell happened to a nondescript person</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t really impress anybody with his skills.</p>
<p>And then in the 1920s, it&rsquo;s all of a sudden,</p>
<p>as you said, sort of the man of the hour, right?</p>
<p>So that to me is kind of,</p>
<p>I have this feeling that Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t really know,</p>
<p>was an impressive human being from the get go.</p>
<p>And then he was raised in this environment</p>
<p>with pressure on all sides.</p>
<p>So you start with this diamond and then you polish it</p>
<p>and you harden it his whole life.</p>
<p>Hitler seemed to be a very unimpressive gemstone</p>
<p>most of his life, and then all of a sudden.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think I can label great leaders.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always fascinated by that idea that,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to remember who the quote was by that,</p>
<p>that great men, oh, Lord Acton.</p>
<p>So great men are often not good men.</p>
<p>And that in order to be great,</p>
<p>you would have to jettison many of the moral qualities</p>
<p>that we normally would consider a Jesus or a Gandhi,</p>
<p>or, you know, these qualities that one looks at</p>
<p>as the good upstanding moral qualities</p>
<p>that we should all aspire to as examples, right?</p>
<p>The Buddha, whatever it might be,</p>
<p>those people wouldn&rsquo;t make good leaders</p>
<p>because what you need to be a good leader</p>
<p>often requires the kind of choices</p>
<p>that a true philosophical diogenes moral man wouldn&rsquo;t make.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have an answer to your question.</p>
<p>How about that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long way of saying, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Just linger a little bit.</p>
<p>It does feel like from my study of Hitler</p>
<p>that the time molded the man versus Genghis Khan,</p>
<p>where it feels like he, the man molded his time.</p>
<p>Yes, and I feel that way</p>
<p>about a lot of those nomadic Confederacy builders,</p>
<p>that they really seem to be these figures</p>
<p>that stand out as extraordinary in one way or another.</p>
<p>Remembering, by the way,</p>
<p>that almost all the history of them were written</p>
<p>by the enemies that they so mistreated</p>
<p>that they were probably never gonna get any good press.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t write themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a caveat.</p>
<p>We should always add to basically all of human history.</p>
<p>Nomadic or Native American peoples</p>
<p>or tribal peoples anywhere</p>
<p>generally do not get the advantage</p>
<p>of being able to write the history of their heroes.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ve recently almost done</p>
<p>with the rise and the fall of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the historical descriptions</p>
<p>of Hitler&rsquo;s rise to power, Nazi&rsquo;s rise to power.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few philosophical things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to ask you to see if you can help.</p>
<p>Like one of the things I think about</p>
<p>is how does one be a hero in 1930s Nazi Germany?</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a hero?</p>
<p>What do heroic actions look like?</p>
<p>I think about that because I think about</p>
<p>how I move about in this world today.</p>
<p>That we live in really chaotic, intense times</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t think you wanna draw any parallels</p>
<p>between Nazi Germany and modern day</p>
<p>in any of the nations we can think about.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not out of the realm of possibility</p>
<p>that authoritarian governments take hold,</p>
<p>authoritarian companies take hold.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to think that I could be</p>
<p>in my little small way and inspire others</p>
<p>to take the heroic action before things get bad.</p>
<p>And I kind of try to place myself</p>
<p>in what would 1930s Germany look like?</p>
<p>Is it possible to stop a Hitler?</p>
<p>Is it even the right way to think about it?</p>
<p>And how does one be a hero in it?</p>
<p>I mean, you often talk about that living through</p>
<p>a moment in history is very different</p>
<p>than looking at that history,</p>
<p>looking when you look back.</p>
<p>I also think about it, would it be possible</p>
<p>to understand what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>that the bells of war are ringing?</p>
<p>It seems that most people didn&rsquo;t seem to understand,</p>
<p>you know, late into the 30s that war is coming.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>On the United States side, inside Germany,</p>
<p>like the opposing figures,</p>
<p>the German military didn&rsquo;t seem to understand this.</p>
<p>Maybe the other countries, certainly France</p>
<p>and England didn&rsquo;t seem to understand this.</p>
<p>That kind of tried to put myself into 90s, 30s Germany</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m Jewish, which is another little twist on the whole.</p>
<p>Like what would I do?</p>
<p>What should one do?</p>
<p>Do you have interesting answers?</p>
<p>So earlier we had talked about Putin</p>
<p>and we had talked about patriotism</p>
<p>and love of country and those sorts of things.</p>
<p>In order to be a hero in Nazi Germany</p>
<p>by our views here, you would have had to have been</p>
<p>anti patriotic to the average German&rsquo;s viewpoint</p>
<p>in the 1930s, right?</p>
<p>You would have to have opposed your own government</p>
<p>and your own country.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very, it would be a very weird thing</p>
<p>to go to people in Germany and say,</p>
<p>listen, the only way you&rsquo;re gonna be seen</p>
<p>as a good German and a hero to the country</p>
<p>that will be your enemies is we think</p>
<p>you should oppose your own government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a strange position to put the people</p>
<p>in a government saying you need to be against your leader,</p>
<p>you need to oppose your government&rsquo;s policies,</p>
<p>you need to oppose your government,</p>
<p>you need to hope and work for its downfall.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t sound patriotic.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t sound patriotic here in this country</p>
<p>if you made a similar argument.</p>
<p>I will go away from the 1930s and go to the 1940s</p>
<p>to answer your question.</p>
<p>So there is movements like the White Rose Movement</p>
<p>in Germany, which involved young people really,</p>
<p>and from various backgrounds, religious backgrounds often,</p>
<p>who worked openly against the Nazi government</p>
<p>at a time when power was already consolidated,</p>
<p>the Gestapo was in full force and they execute people</p>
<p>who are against the government.</p>
<p>And these young people would go out</p>
<p>and distribute pamphlets and many of them got their heads</p>
<p>cut off with guillotines for their trouble.</p>
<p>And they knew that that was gonna be the penalty.</p>
<p>That is a remarkable amount of bravery and sacrifice</p>
<p>and willingness to die, and almost not even willingness</p>
<p>because they were so open about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost a certainty, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredibly moving to me.</p>
<p>So when we talk, and we had talked earlier</p>
<p>about sort of the human spirit and all that kind of thing,</p>
<p>there are people in the German military who opposed</p>
<p>and worked against Hitler, for example.</p>
<p>But to me, that&rsquo;s almost cowardly compared</p>
<p>to what these young people did in the White Rose Movement</p>
<p>because those people in the Wehrmacht, for example,</p>
<p>who were secretly trying to undermine Hitler,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not really putting their lives on the line</p>
<p>to the same degree.</p>
<p>And so I think when I look at heroes,</p>
<p>and listen, I remember once saying</p>
<p>there were no conscientious objectors in Germany</p>
<p>as a way to point out to people</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t have a choice,</p>
<p>you know, you were gonna serve in there.</p>
<p>And I got letters from Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses who said,</p>
<p>yes, there were.</p>
<p>And we got sent to the concentration camps.</p>
<p>Those are remarkably brave things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to have your own set of standards and values.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another thing to say, oh no,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to display them in a way</p>
<p>that with this regime, that&rsquo;s a death sentence.</p>
<p>And not just for me, for my family, right?</p>
<p>In these regimes, there was not a lot of distinction made</p>
<p>between father and son and wives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a remarkable sacrifice to make.</p>
<p>And far beyond what I think I would even be capable of.</p>
<p>And so the admiration comes from seeing people</p>
<p>who appear to be more morally profound</p>
<p>than you are yourself.</p>
<p>So when I look at this, I look at that kind of thing</p>
<p>and I just say, wow.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is if you&rsquo;d have gone</p>
<p>to most average Germans on the street in 1942</p>
<p>and said, what do you think of these people?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna think of them as traitors</p>
<p>who probably got what they deserved.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the eye of the beholder thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the power of the state to sow propagandize values</p>
<p>and morality in a way that favors the state</p>
<p>that you can turn people who today we look at</p>
<p>as unbelievably brave and moral</p>
<p>and crusading for righteousness</p>
<p>and turn them into enemies of the people.</p>
<p>So, I mean, in my mind, it would be people like that.</p>
<p>See, I think, so hero is a funny word</p>
<p>and we romanticize the notion,</p>
<p>but if I could drag you back to 1930s Germany from 1940s.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I feel like the heroic actions that doesn&rsquo;t accomplish much</p>
<p>is not what I&rsquo;m referring to.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many heroes I look up to that,</p>
<p>like David Goggins, for example,</p>
<p>the guy who runs crazy distances.</p>
<p>He runs for no purpose except for the suffering in itself.</p>
<p>And I think his willingness to challenge the limits</p>
<p>of his mind is heroic.</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m looking for a different term,</p>
<p>which is how could Hitler have been stopped?</p>
<p>My sense is that he could have been stopped</p>
<p>in the battle of ideas where people,</p>
<p>millions of people were suffering economically</p>
<p>or suffering because of the betrayal of World War I</p>
<p>in terms of the love of country</p>
<p>and how they felt they were being treated.</p>
<p>And a charismatic leader that inspired love</p>
<p>and unity that&rsquo;s not destructive could have emerged.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the battle should have been fought.</p>
<p>I would suggest that we need to take into account</p>
<p>the context of the times that led to Hitler&rsquo;s rise of power</p>
<p>and created the conditions where his message resonated.</p>
<p>That is not a message that resonates at all times, right?</p>
<p>It is impossible to understand the rise of Hitler</p>
<p>without dealing with the First World War</p>
<p>and the aftermath of the First World War</p>
<p>and the inflationary terrible depression in Germany</p>
<p>and all these things and the dissatisfaction</p>
<p>with the Weimar Republic&rsquo;s government,</p>
<p>which was often seen as something put into,</p>
<p>which it was put into place by the victorious powers.</p>
<p>Hitler referred to the people that signed those agreements</p>
<p>that signed the armistice as the November criminals.</p>
<p>And he used that as a phrase</p>
<p>which resonated with the population.</p>
<p>This was a population that was embittered.</p>
<p>And even if they weren&rsquo;t embittered,</p>
<p>the times were so terrible.</p>
<p>And the options for operating within the system</p>
<p>in a non radical way seemed totally discredited, right?</p>
<p>You could work through the Weimar Republic,</p>
<p>but they tried and it wasn&rsquo;t working anyway.</p>
<p>And then the alternative to the Nazis</p>
<p>who were bully boys in the street</p>
<p>were communist agitators</p>
<p>that to the average conservative Germans seem no better.</p>
<p>So you have three options</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an average German person.</p>
<p>You can go with the discredited government</p>
<p>put in power by your enemies that wasn&rsquo;t working anyway.</p>
<p>You could go with the Nazis</p>
<p>who seemed like a bunch of super patriots</p>
<p>calling for the restoration of German authority,</p>
<p>or you could go with the communists.</p>
<p>And the entire thing seemed like a litany of poor options.</p>
<p>And in this realm, Hitler was able to triangulate,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>He came off as a person</p>
<p>who was going to restore German greatness</p>
<p>at a time when this was a powerful message.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t need German greatness restored,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t resonate, right?</p>
<p>So the reason that your love idea and all this stuff,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think would have worked in the time period</p>
<p>is because that was not a commodity</p>
<p>that the average German was in search of then.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting to think about</p>
<p>whether greatness can be restored through mechanisms,</p>
<p>through ideas that are not so,</p>
<p>from our perspective today, so evil.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right term is.</p>
<p>But the war continued in a way.</p>
<p>So remember that when Germany,</p>
<p>when Hitler is rising to power,</p>
<p>the French are in control of parts of Germany, right?</p>
<p>The Ruhr, one of the main industrial heartlands of Germany,</p>
<p>was occupied by the French.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s never this point</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re allowed to let the hate dissipate, right?</p>
<p>Every time maybe things were calming down,</p>
<p>something else would happen to stick the knife in</p>
<p>and twist it a little bit more,</p>
<p>from the average German&rsquo;s perspective, right?</p>
<p>The reparations, right?</p>
<p>So if you say, okay, well, we&rsquo;re gonna get back on our feet,</p>
<p>the reparations were crushing.</p>
<p>These things prevented the idea of love or brotherhood</p>
<p>and all these things from taking hold.</p>
<p>And even if there were Germans who felt that way,</p>
<p>and there most certainly were,</p>
<p>it is hard to overcome the power of everyone else.</p>
<p>You know, what I always say</p>
<p>when people talk to me about humanity</p>
<p>is I believe on individual levels,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re capable of everything and anything,</p>
<p>good, bad, or indifferent.</p>
<p>But collectively, it&rsquo;s different, right?</p>
<p>And in the time period that we&rsquo;re talking about here,</p>
<p>messages of peace on earth and love your enemies</p>
<p>and all these sorts of things</p>
<p>were absolutely deluged and overwhelmed</p>
<p>and drowned out by the bitterness, the hatred,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s be honest,</p>
<p>the sense that you were continually being abused</p>
<p>by your former enemies.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people in the Allied side</p>
<p>that realized this and said, we&rsquo;re setting up the next war.</p>
<p>This is, I mean, they understood</p>
<p>that you can only do certain things</p>
<p>to collective human populations</p>
<p>for a certain period of time</p>
<p>before it is natural for them to want to.</p>
<p>And there are, you can see German posters from the region,</p>
<p>Nazi propaganda posters that show them</p>
<p>breaking off the chains of their enemies.</p>
<p>And I mean, Germany awake, right?</p>
<p>That was the great slogan.</p>
<p>So I think love is always a difficult option.</p>
<p>And in the context of those times,</p>
<p>it was even more disempowered than normal.</p>
<p>Well, this goes to the,</p>
<p>just to linger on it for a little longer,</p>
<p>the question of the inevitability of history.</p>
<p>Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?</p>
<p>Do you think this kind of force that you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that there was a pain and it was building,</p>
<p>there was a hatred that was building,</p>
<p>do you think there was a way to avert?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s two questions.</p>
<p>Could have been a lot worse and could have been better</p>
<p>in the trajectory of history in the 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>The most logical, see, we had started this conversation,</p>
<p>it brings a wonderful bow tie into the discussion</p>
<p>and buttons it up nicely.</p>
<p>We had talked about force and counter force earlier.</p>
<p>The most obvious and much discussed way</p>
<p>that Hitler could have been stopped</p>
<p>has nothing to do with Germans.</p>
<p>When he remilitarized the Rhineland,</p>
<p>everyone talks about what a couple of French divisions</p>
<p>would have done had they simply gone in and contested.</p>
<p>And this was something Hitler was extremely,</p>
<p>I mean, it might&rsquo;ve been the most nervous time</p>
<p>in his entire career because he was afraid</p>
<p>that they would have responded with force</p>
<p>and he was in no position to do anything about it</p>
<p>if they did.</p>
<p>So this is where you get the people who say,</p>
<p>and Churchill&rsquo;s one of these people too,</p>
<p>where they talk about that he should have been stopped</p>
<p>militarily right at the very beginning when he was weak.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think&hellip;</p>
<p>Listen, there were candidates in the Catholic Center Party</p>
<p>and others in the Weimar Republic</p>
<p>that maybe could have done things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s beyond my understanding of specific German history</p>
<p>to talk about it intelligently.</p>
<p>But I do think that had the French responded militarily</p>
<p>to Hitler&rsquo;s initial moves into that area,</p>
<p>that he would have been thwarted.</p>
<p>And I think he himself believed,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m remembering my reading,</p>
<p>that this would have led to his downfall.</p>
<p>So the potential&hellip;</p>
<p>See, what I don&rsquo;t like about this</p>
<p>is that it almost legitimizes military intervention</p>
<p>at a very early stage</p>
<p>to prevent worse things from happening,</p>
<p>but it might be a pretty clear cut case.</p>
<p>But it shows we pointed out that there was a lot of sympathy</p>
<p>on the part of the allies for the fact that</p>
<p>the Germans probably should have Germany back</p>
<p>and this is traditional German land.</p>
<p>I mean, they were trying, in a funny way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like the love and the sense of justice</p>
<p>on the allies part may have actually stayed their hand</p>
<p>in a way that would have prevented</p>
<p>much, much, much worse things later.</p>
<p>But if the times were such</p>
<p>that the message of a Hitler resonated,</p>
<p>then simply removing Hitler from the equation</p>
<p>would not have removed the context of the times.</p>
<p>And that means one of two things,</p>
<p>either you could have had another one</p>
<p>or you could have ended up in a situation equally bad</p>
<p>in a different direction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that means</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to imagine anything could be worse</p>
<p>than what actually occurred, but history&rsquo;s funny that way.</p>
<p>And Hitler&rsquo;s always everyone&rsquo;s favorite example</p>
<p>of the difference between the great man theory of history</p>
<p>and the trends and forces theories of history, right?</p>
<p>The times made a Hitler possible</p>
<p>and maybe even desirable to some.</p>
<p>If you took him out of the equation,</p>
<p>those trends and forces are still in place, right?</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>If you take him out and the door is still open,</p>
<p>does somebody else walk through it?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s mathematically speaking,</p>
<p>the probability of charismatic leaders emerge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so torn on that at this point.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another way to look at it.</p>
<p>The institutional stability of Germany</p>
<p>in that time period was not enough to push back.</p>
<p>And there are other periods in German history.</p>
<p>I mean, that Hitler arose in, arisen in 1913,</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t get anywhere</p>
<p>because Germany&rsquo;s institutional power</p>
<p>is enough to simply quash that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that Germany was unstable anyway</p>
<p>that prevented a united front</p>
<p>that would have kept radicalism from getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>A tricky question on this,</p>
<p>just to stay on this a little longer</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not sure how to think about it,</p>
<p>is the World War II versus the Holocaust.</p>
<p>We were talking just now</p>
<p>about the way that history unrolls itself</p>
<p>and could Hitler have been stopped?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t quite know what to think about Hitler</p>
<p>without the Holocaust.</p>
<p>And perhaps in his thinking,</p>
<p>how essential the antisemitism</p>
<p>and the hatred of Jews was.</p>
<p>It feels to me that,</p>
<p>I mean, we were just talking about</p>
<p>where did he pick up his hatred of the Jewish people?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stories in Vienna and so on</p>
<p>that it almost is picking up the idea</p>
<p>of antisemitism as a really useful tool,</p>
<p>as opposed to actually believing it in its core.</p>
<p>Do you think World War II as it turned out</p>
<p>and Hitler as he turned out</p>
<p>would be possible without antisemitism?</p>
<p>Could we have avoided the Holocaust?</p>
<p>Or was it an integral part of the ideology</p>
<p>of fascism and the Nazis?</p>
<p>Not an integral part of fascism</p>
<p>because Mussolini really, I mean,</p>
<p>Mussolini did it to please Hitler,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t an integral part.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting to me is that that&rsquo;s the big anomaly</p>
<p>in the whole question because antisemitism</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t need to be a part of this at all, right?</p>
<p>Hitler had a conspiratorial view of the world.</p>
<p>He was a believer that the Jews controlled things, right?</p>
<p>The Jews were responsible for both Bolshevism on one side</p>
<p>and capitalism on the other, they ruled the banks.</p>
<p>I mean, United States was a Jewified country, right?</p>
<p>Bolshevism was a Jewified sort of a political.</p>
<p>In other words, he saw Jews everywhere</p>
<p>and he had that line about it.</p>
<p>The Jews of Europe force another war to Germany,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pay the price or whatever,</p>
<p>but then you have to believe that they&rsquo;re capable of that.</p>
<p>The Holocaust is a weird, weird sidebar to the whole thing.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always found interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sidebar that weakened Germany</p>
<p>because look at the First World War.</p>
<p>The Jews fought for Germany, right?</p>
<p>Who was the most important?</p>
<p>And this is a very arguable point,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the first one that pops into my head.</p>
<p>Who was the most important Jewish figure</p>
<p>that would have maybe been on the German side</p>
<p>had the Germans had a non antisemitic?</p>
<p>Well, listen, that whole part.</p>
<p>Yes, it was Einstein, but the whole,</p>
<p>I should point out that to say Germany or Europe</p>
<p>or Russia or any of those things were not antisemitic</p>
<p>is to do injustice to history, right?</p>
<p>Pogroms, I mean, it&rsquo;s standard operating procedure.</p>
<p>What you see in the Hitlerian era</p>
<p>is an absolute huge spike, right?</p>
<p>Cause the government has a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>that the Jews have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because Hitler both thought of them as weak</p>
<p>and super powerful at the same time, right?</p>
<p>And as an outsider people that weakened Germany,</p>
<p>the whole idea of the blood</p>
<p>and how that connects to Darwinism</p>
<p>and all that sort of stuff is just weird, right?</p>
<p>A real outlier, but Einstein,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just play with Einstein.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s no antisemitism in Germany</p>
<p>or none above the normal level, right?</p>
<p>The baseline level, does Einstein leave</p>
<p>along with all the other Jewish scientists?</p>
<p>And what does Germany have as increased technological</p>
<p>and intellectual capacity if they stay, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that actually weakened that state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tragic flaw in the Hitlerian worldview,</p>
<p>but it was so, and let me, you had mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>like maybe it was not integral to his character.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a wonderful tool for power.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, and really not at the beginning,</p>
<p>this guy became absolutely obsessed with this.</p>
<p>With the conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>And Jews, and he surrounded himself</p>
<p>with people and theorists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna use that word really, really sort of loosely,</p>
<p>who believed this too.</p>
<p>And so you have a cabal of people</p>
<p>who are reinforcing this idea</p>
<p>that the Jews control the world.</p>
<p>He called it international jewelry</p>
<p>was a huge part of the problem.</p>
<p>And because of that, they deserved to be punished.</p>
<p>They were an enemy within all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nutty conspiracy theory</p>
<p>that the government of one of the most,</p>
<p>I mean, the big thing with Germany was culture, right?</p>
<p>They were a leading figure in culture and philosophy</p>
<p>and all these kinds of things.</p>
<p>And that they could be overtaken</p>
<p>with this wildly wickedly weird conspiracy theory</p>
<p>and that it would actually determine things.</p>
<p>I mean, Hitler was taking vast amounts of German resources</p>
<p>and using it to wipe out this race</p>
<p>when he needed them for all kinds of other things</p>
<p>to fight a war of annihilation.</p>
<p>So that is the weirdest part of the whole Nazi phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the darkest possible silver lining to think about</p>
<p>is that the Holocaust may have been</p>
<p>and the hatred of the Jewish people</p>
<p>may have been the thing that avoided Germany</p>
<p>getting the nuclear weapons first.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a wonderful historical ironic twist</p>
<p>that if it weren&rsquo;t so overlaid with tragedy,</p>
<p>a thousand years from now will be seen</p>
<p>as something really kind of funny.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think as you&rsquo;ve talked.</p>
<p>So the seeds of his own destruction, right?</p>
<p>The tragic flaw.</p>
<p>And my hope is, this is a discussion I have</p>
<p>with my dad as a physicist,</p>
<p>is that evil inherently contains with it</p>
<p>that kind of incompetence.</p>
<p>So my dad&rsquo;s discussion, so he&rsquo;s a physicist</p>
<p>and an engineer, his belief is that at this time</p>
<p>in our history, the reason we haven&rsquo;t had nuclear</p>
<p>like terrorist blow up a nuclear weapon somewhere</p>
<p>in the world is that the kind of people</p>
<p>that would be terrorists are simply not competent enough</p>
<p>at their job of being a destructive.</p>
<p>So like, there&rsquo;s a kind of, if you plot it,</p>
<p>the more evil you are, the less able you are.</p>
<p>And by evil, I mean, purely just like we said,</p>
<p>if we were to consider the hatred of Jewish people as evil,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s sort of detached from reality,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like just this pure hatred of something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grounded on things, conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s evil, then the more you sell yourself,</p>
<p>the more you give into these conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>the less capable you are at actually engineering,</p>
<p>which is very difficult, engineering nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and effectively deploying them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a hopeful message that the destructive people</p>
<p>in this world are by their worldview incompetent</p>
<p>in creating the ultimate destruction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with that.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>I straight up don&rsquo;t agree with that.</p>
<p>So why are we still here?</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t we destroyed ourselves?</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t the terrorists blown, it&rsquo;s been many decades.</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t we destroyed ourself to this point?</p>
<p>Well, when you say it&rsquo;s been many decades, many decades,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like saying in the life of 150 year old person,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been doing well for a year.</p>
<p>The problem with all these kinds of equations,</p>
<p>and it was Bertrand Russell, right?</p>
<p>The philosopher who said so.</p>
<p>He said, it&rsquo;s unreasonable to expect a man to walk</p>
<p>on a tight rope for 50 years.</p>
<p>I mean, the problem is that this is a long game.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s remember that up until relatively recently,</p>
<p>what would you say, 30 years ago,</p>
<p>the nuclear weapons in the world</p>
<p>were really tightly controlled.</p>
<p>That was one of the real dangers</p>
<p>in the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Remember the worry that all of a sudden</p>
<p>you were gonna have bankrupt former Soviet Republic</p>
<p>selling nuclear weapons to terrorists and whatnot.</p>
<p>I would suggest, and here&rsquo;s another problem is that</p>
<p>when we call these terrorists evil,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy for an American, for example,</p>
<p>to say that Osama bin Laden is evil.</p>
<p>Easy for me to say that.</p>
<p>But one man&rsquo;s terrorist is another man&rsquo;s freedom fighter</p>
<p>as the saying goes, and to other people, he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>What Osama bin Laden did,</p>
<p>and the people that worked with him,</p>
<p>we would call evil genius.</p>
<p>The idea of hijacking planes</p>
<p>and flying them into the buildings like that,</p>
<p>and that he could pull that off,</p>
<p>and that still boggles my mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still, it&rsquo;s funny, I&rsquo;m still stunned by that.</p>
<p>And yet, the idea, here&rsquo;s the funny part,</p>
<p>and I hesitate to talk about this</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t wanna give anyone ideas,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need nuclear weapons</p>
<p>to do incredibly grave amounts of danger.</p>
<p>I mean, what one can of gasoline and a BIC lighter can do</p>
<p>in the right place and the right time,</p>
<p>and over and over and over again</p>
<p>can bring down societies.</p>
<p>This is the argument behind the importance of the stability</p>
<p>that a nation state provides.</p>
<p>So when we went in and took out Saddam Hussein,</p>
<p>one of the great counter arguments</p>
<p>from some of the people who said,</p>
<p>this is a really stupid thing to do,</p>
<p>is that Saddam Hussein was the greatest anti terror weapon</p>
<p>in that region that you could have</p>
<p>because they were a threat to him.</p>
<p>So he took that, and he did it in a way</p>
<p>that was much more repressive than we would ever be, right?</p>
<p>And this is the old line</p>
<p>about why we supported right wing death squad countries,</p>
<p>because they were taking out people</p>
<p>that would inevitably be a problem for us if they didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and they were able to do it</p>
<p>in a way we would never be able to do, supposedly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pretty good at that stuff,</p>
<p>just like the Soviet Union was behind the scenes</p>
<p>and underneath the radar.</p>
<p>But the idea that the stability created</p>
<p>by powerful and strong centralized leadership</p>
<p>allowed them, it&rsquo;s almost like outsourcing</p>
<p>anti terror activities, allowed them to,</p>
<p>for their own reasons.</p>
<p>I mean, you see the same thing</p>
<p>in the Syria situation with the Assads.</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t have an ISIS in that area</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a threat to the Assad government</p>
<p>who will take care of that for you,</p>
<p>and then that helps us by not having an ISIS.</p>
<p>So I would suggest one, that the game is still on</p>
<p>on whether or not these people get nuclear weapons</p>
<p>in their hands.</p>
<p>I would suggest they don&rsquo;t need them</p>
<p>to achieve their goals, really.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is if you start thinking</p>
<p>like the Joker in Batman, the terrorist ideas,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny, I guess I would be a great terrorist</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just full of those ideas.</p>
<p>Oh, you could do this, you could,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scary to think of how vulnerable we are.</p>
<p>But the whole point is that you as the Joker</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do the terrorist actions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the theory that&rsquo;s so hopeful to me with my dad,</p>
<p>is that all the ideas, your ability to generate good ideas,</p>
<p>forget nuclear weapons, how you can disrupt the power grid,</p>
<p>how you can disrupt the, attack our psychology,</p>
<p>attack like with a can of gasoline, like you said,</p>
<p>somehow disrupt the American system of ideas.</p>
<p>That coming up with good ideas there.</p>
<p>Are we saying evil people can&rsquo;t come up</p>
<p>with evil genius ideas?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>We have this Hollywood story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think history backs that up.</p>
<p>I mean, I think you can say with the nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>it does, but only because they&rsquo;re so recent.</p>
<p>But I mean, evil genius, I mean, that&rsquo;s almost proverbial.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, okay, so to push back for the fun of it, or.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean to, I don&rsquo;t want you to leave this</p>
<p>in a terrible mood because I push back</p>
<p>on every hopeful idea you had,</p>
<p>but I tend to be a little cynical about that stuff.</p>
<p>But that goes to the definition of evil, I think,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not so sure human history</p>
<p>has a lot of evil people being competent.</p>
<p>I do believe that they mostly,</p>
<p>like in order to be good at doing</p>
<p>what may be perceived as evil,</p>
<p>you have to be able to construct an ideology</p>
<p>around which you truly believe</p>
<p>when you look in the mirror by yourself,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re doing good for the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s difficult to construct an ideology</p>
<p>where destroying the lives of millions</p>
<p>or disrupting the American system,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already contradicting myself as I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I was just gonna say, people have done this already, yes.</p>
<p>So, but then it&rsquo;s the question of like,</p>
<p>about aliens with the idea that</p>
<p>if the aliens are all out there,</p>
<p>why haven&rsquo;t they visited us?</p>
<p>The same question, if it&rsquo;s so easy to be evil,</p>
<p>not easy, if it&rsquo;s possible to be evil,</p>
<p>why haven&rsquo;t we destroyed ourselves?</p>
<p>And your statement is from the context of history,</p>
<p>the game is still on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just been a few years</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;ve found the tools to destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>And one of the challenges of our modern time</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t often think about this pandemic</p>
<p>kind of revealed is how soft we&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>in terms of our deep dependence on the system.</p>
<p>So somebody mentioned to me,</p>
<p>what happens if power goes out for a day?</p>
<p>What happens if power goes out for a month?</p>
<p>Oh, for example, the person that mentioned this</p>
<p>was a Berkeley faculty that I was talking with.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an astronomer who&rsquo;s observing solar flares.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very possible that a solar flare,</p>
<p>they happen all the time to different degrees.</p>
<p>To knock out your cell phones.</p>
<p>Yeah, to knock out the power grid for months.</p>
<p>So like, just as a thought experiment,</p>
<p>what happens if just power goes out</p>
<p>for a week in this country?</p>
<p>Like the electromagnetic pulses and the nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things, yeah.</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s an act of nature.</p>
<p>And even just the act of nature will reveal</p>
<p>like a little. The fragility of it all.</p>
<p>And then the evil can emerge.</p>
<p>I mean, the kind of things that might happen</p>
<p>when power goes out, especially during a divisive time.</p>
<p>Well, you won&rsquo;t have food.</p>
<p>At baseline level, that would mean</p>
<p>that the entire supplies chain begins to break down.</p>
<p>And then you have desperation.</p>
<p>And desperation opens the door to everything.</p>
<p>Can I ask a dark question?</p>
<p>As opposed to the other things we&rsquo;ve been talking about?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a thread, a hopeful message.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;ll be a hopeful message on this one too.</p>
<p>You may have the wrong guess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>If you were to bet money on the way</p>
<p>that human civilization destroys itself,</p>
<p>or it collapses in some way that is,</p>
<p>where the result would be unrecognizable to us</p>
<p>as anything akin to progress, what would you say?</p>
<p>Is it nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>Is it some societal breakdown</p>
<p>through just more traditional kinds of war?</p>
<p>Is it engineered pandemics, nanotechnology?</p>
<p>Is it artificial intelligence?</p>
<p>Is it something we can&rsquo;t even expect yet?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of how we humans will destroy ourselves?</p>
<p>Or might we live forever?</p>
<p>I think what governs my view of this thing</p>
<p>is the ability for us to focus ourselves collectively.</p>
<p>And that gives me the choice of looking at this</p>
<p>and saying, what are the odds we will do X versus Y, right?</p>
<p>So go look at the 62 Cuban Missile Crisis,</p>
<p>where we looked at the potential of nuclear war</p>
<p>and we stared right in the face of that.</p>
<p>To me, I consider that to be,</p>
<p>you wanna talk about a hopeful moment?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the rare times in our history</p>
<p>where I think the odds were overwhelmingly</p>
<p>that there would be a nuclear war.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not the super Kennedy worshiper that,</p>
<p>I grew up in an era where he was,</p>
<p>especially amongst people in the Democratic Party,</p>
<p>he was almost worshiped.</p>
<p>And I was never that guy, but I will say something.</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy by himself probably made decisions</p>
<p>that saved a hundred million or more lives</p>
<p>because everyone around him thought he should be</p>
<p>taking the road that would have led to those deaths.</p>
<p>And to push back against that is,</p>
<p>when you look at it now, I mean, again,</p>
<p>if you were a betting person,</p>
<p>you would have bet against that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s rare, right?</p>
<p>So when we talk about how the world will end,</p>
<p>the fact that one person actually had that in their hands</p>
<p>meant that it wasn&rsquo;t a collective decision.</p>
<p>It gave, remember I said,</p>
<p>I trust people on an individual level,</p>
<p>but when we get together, we&rsquo;re more like a herd</p>
<p>and we devolved down to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>That was something where the higher ethical ideas</p>
<p>of a single human being could come into play</p>
<p>and make the decisions that influence the events.</p>
<p>But when we have to act collectively,</p>
<p>I get a lot more pessimistic.</p>
<p>So take what we&rsquo;re doing to the planet.</p>
<p>And we talk about it always now in terms of climate change,</p>
<p>which I think is far too narrow.</p>
<p>Look at, and I always get very frustrated</p>
<p>when we talk about these arguments about,</p>
<p>is it happening?</p>
<p>Is it human?</p>
<p>Just look at the trash, forget climate for a second.</p>
<p>We are destroying the planet because we&rsquo;re not taking care</p>
<p>of it and because what it would do to take care of it</p>
<p>would require collective sacrifices</p>
<p>that would require enough of us to say, okay.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t get enough of us to say, okay,</p>
<p>because too many people have to be on board.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not John F. Kennedy making one decision from one man.</p>
<p>We have to have 85% of us or something around the world.</p>
<p>Not just, you can&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re gonna stop doing damage</p>
<p>to the world here in the United States if China does it.</p>
<p>So the amount of people that have to get on board</p>
<p>that train is hard.</p>
<p>You get pessimistic hoping for those kinds of shifts</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s right, you know, Krypton&rsquo;s about to explode.</p>
<p>We have, and so I think if you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a gambling man&rsquo;s view of this,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s gotta be the odds on favorite</p>
<p>because it requires such a UNAM.</p>
<p>I mean, and the systems maybe aren&rsquo;t even in place, right?</p>
<p>The fact that we would need intergovernmental bodies</p>
<p>that are completely discredited now on board</p>
<p>and you would have to subvert the national interests</p>
<p>of nation states, I mean, the amount of things</p>
<p>that have to go right in a short period of time</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t have 600 years to figure this out, right?</p>
<p>So to me, that looks like the most likely</p>
<p>just because the things we would have to do</p>
<p>to avoid it seem the most unlikely.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I believe, call me naive,</p>
<p>in just like you said with the individual,</p>
<p>I believe that charismatic leaders,</p>
<p>individual leaders will save us.</p>
<p>Like this.</p>
<p>What if you don&rsquo;t get them all at the same time?</p>
<p>What if you get a charismatic leader in one country</p>
<p>but under, or what if you get a charismatic leader</p>
<p>in a country that doesn&rsquo;t really matter that much?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a ripple effect.</p>
<p>So it starts with one leader</p>
<p>and their charisma inspires other leaders.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like one ant queen steps up</p>
<p>and then the rest of the ant starts behaving.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s like little other spikes</p>
<p>of leaders that emerge.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s where collaboration emerges.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that like when you heat up the system</p>
<p>and shit starts getting really chaotic,</p>
<p>then the leader, whatever this collective intelligence</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve developed, the leader will emerge.</p>
<p>Like there.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s just as much of a chance though</p>
<p>that the leader would emerge and say,</p>
<p>the Jews are the people who did all this.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Is that the idea that they would come up,</p>
<p>you have a charismatic leader</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going to come up with the rights</p>
<p>or she is going to come up with the right solution</p>
<p>as opposed to totally coming up with the wrong solution.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is you could be right,</p>
<p>but a lot of things have to go the right way.</p>
<p>But my intuition about the evolutionary process</p>
<p>that led to the creation of human intelligence</p>
<p>and consciousness on earth results</p>
<p>in the power of like, if we think of it,</p>
<p>just the love in the system versus the hate in the system,</p>
<p>that the love is greater.</p>
<p>The human kindness potential in the system</p>
<p>is greater than the human hatred potential.</p>
<p>And so the leader that is in the time when it&rsquo;s needed,</p>
<p>the leader that inspires love and kindness</p>
<p>is more likely to emerge and will have more power.</p>
<p>So you have the Hitlers of the world that emerge,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually in a grand scheme of history</p>
<p>are not that impactful.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s weird to say,</p>
<p>but not that many people died in World War II.</p>
<p>If you look at the full range of human history,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s up to a hundred million, whatever that is,</p>
<p>with natural pandemics too,</p>
<p>you can have those kinds of numbers,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still a percentage.</p>
<p>I forget what the percentage is,</p>
<p>maybe three, 5% of the human population on earth.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a little bit focused on a different region,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not destructive</p>
<p>to the entirety of human civilization.</p>
<p>So I believe that the charismatic leaders,</p>
<p>when time is needed, that do good for the world</p>
<p>in the broader sense of good</p>
<p>are more likely to emerge</p>
<p>than the ones that say, kill all the Jews.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible though, and this is just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about this all of 30 seconds,</p>
<p>but I mean, it seems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re betting money here on the 21st century,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna win?</p>
<p>I think maybe you&rsquo;ve divided this</p>
<p>into too much of a black and white dichotomy,</p>
<p>this love and good on one side and this evil on another.</p>
<p>Let me throw something that might be more</p>
<p>in the center of that linear balancing act,</p>
<p>self interest, which may or may not be good.</p>
<p>The good version of it we call enlightened self interest.</p>
<p>The bad version of it we call selfishness.</p>
<p>But self interest to me seems like something more likely</p>
<p>to impact the outcome than either love on one side</p>
<p>or evil on the other.</p>
<p>Simply a question of what&rsquo;s good for me</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s good for my country</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s good from my point of view</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s good for my business.</p>
<p>I mean, if you tell me, and maybe I&rsquo;m a coal miner</p>
<p>or maybe I own a coal mine.</p>
<p>If you say to me, we have to stop using coal</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hurting the earth,</p>
<p>I have a hard time disentangling that greater good question</p>
<p>from my right now good feeding my family question, right?</p>
<p>So I think maybe it&rsquo;s gonna be a much more banal thing</p>
<p>than good and evil, much more a question</p>
<p>of we&rsquo;re not all going to decide at the same time</p>
<p>that the interests that we have are aligned.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Totally, but I mean, I&rsquo;ve looked at Ayn Rand</p>
<p>and objectivism and kind of really thought like,</p>
<p>how bad or good can things go</p>
<p>when everybody&rsquo;s acting selfishly?</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;re just talking two aunts here</p>
<p>with microphones talking about.</p>
<p>But like the question is when this spreads,</p>
<p>so what do I mean by love and kindness?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s human flourishing on earth</p>
<p>and throughout the cosmos.</p>
<p>It feels like whatever the engine that drives human beings</p>
<p>is more likely to result in human flourishing.</p>
<p>And people like Hitler are not good for human flourishing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean by good is there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s an intuition that kindness</p>
<p>is an evolutionary advantage.</p>
<p>I hate those terms.</p>
<p>I hate to reduce stuff to evolutionary biology always,</p>
<p>but it just seems like for us to multiply</p>
<p>throughout the universe, it&rsquo;s good to be kind to each other.</p>
<p>And those leaders will always emerge to save us</p>
<p>from the Hitlers of the world that wanna kind of</p>
<p>burn the thing down with a flamethrower.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the intuition.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about, you brought up evolution several times.</p>
<p>Let me play with that for a minute.</p>
<p>I think going back to animal times,</p>
<p>we are conditioned to deal with overwhelming threats</p>
<p>right in front of us.</p>
<p>So I have quite a bit of faith in humanity</p>
<p>when it comes to impending doom right outside our door.</p>
<p>If Krypton&rsquo;s about to explode,</p>
<p>I think humanity can rouse themselves to great,</p>
<p>and would give power to the people who needed it</p>
<p>and be willing to make the sacrifices.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what makes, I think,</p>
<p>the pollution slash climate change</p>
<p>slash screwing up your environment threat</p>
<p>so particularly insidious is it happens slowly, right?</p>
<p>It defies fight and flight mechanisms.</p>
<p>It defies the natural ability we have to deal</p>
<p>with the threat that&rsquo;s right on top of us.</p>
<p>And it requires an amount of foresight</p>
<p>that while some people would be fine with that,</p>
<p>most people are too worried and understandably,</p>
<p>I think too worried about today&rsquo;s threat</p>
<p>rather than next generation&rsquo;s threat or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>So I mean, when we talk about when you had said,</p>
<p>what do you think the greatest threat is?</p>
<p>I think with nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>I think could we have a nuclear war?</p>
<p>We darn right could,</p>
<p>but I think that there&rsquo;s enough of an inertia</p>
<p>where against that because people understand instinctively,</p>
<p>if I decide to launch this attack against China</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m India,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have 50 million dead people tomorrow.</p>
<p>Whereas if you say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a whole planet of dead people</p>
<p>in three generations if we don&rsquo;t start now,</p>
<p>I think the evolutionary way that we have evolved</p>
<p>mitigates maybe against that.</p>
<p>In other words, I think I would be pleasantly surprised</p>
<p>if we could pull that off.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be like, I&rsquo;m the sight predicting doom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun that way.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re both,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m over the top on the love thing.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m over the top on the doom.</p>
<p>So it makes for a fun chat, I think.</p>
<p>So one guy that I&rsquo;ve talked to several times</p>
<p>is slowly becoming a friend is a guy named Elon Musk.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big fan of hardcore history,</p>
<p>especially Genghis Khan series of episodes,</p>
<p>but really all of it,</p>
<p>him and his girlfriend Grimes listen to it, which is.</p>
<p>I know Elon.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know Elon?</p>
<p>Okay, awesome.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like relationship goals,</p>
<p>like listen to hardcore history on the weekend</p>
<p>with your loved one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let me, if I were to look at the guy</p>
<p>from a perspective of human history,</p>
<p>it feels like he will be a little speck that&rsquo;s remembered.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>You think about like the people,</p>
<p>what will we remember from our time?</p>
<p>Who are the people we&rsquo;ll remember,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the Hitlers or the Einsteins,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to be?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to predict when you&rsquo;re in it,</p>
<p>but it seems like Elon</p>
<p>will be one of those people remembered.</p>
<p>And if I were to guess what he&rsquo;s remembered for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the work he&rsquo;s doing with SpaceX</p>
<p>and potentially being the person.</p>
<p>Now we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but the being the person</p>
<p>who launched a new era of space exploration.</p>
<p>If we look centuries from now,</p>
<p>if we are successful as human beings surviving long enough</p>
<p>to venture out into the, you know, toward the stars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to ask you this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what your opinions are,</p>
<p>but do you think humans will be a multi planetary species</p>
<p>in the long arc of history?</p>
<p>Do you think Elon will be successful in his dream?</p>
<p>And he doesn&rsquo;t shy away from saying it this way, right?</p>
<p>He really wants us to colonize Mars first</p>
<p>and then colonize other Earth like planets</p>
<p>in other solar systems throughout the galaxy.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope that we humans will venture out</p>
<p>towards the stars?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>And this actually, again, dovetails</p>
<p>to what we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>I actually, first of all, I toured SpaceX</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to get your mind around</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s doing what it took governments to do before.</p>
<p>Yes. Okay.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s incredible that we&rsquo;re watching individual companies</p>
<p>and stuff doing this.</p>
<p>Doing it faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, and pushing the envelope, right?</p>
<p>Faster than the governments at the time we&rsquo;re moving.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of people who I think,</p>
<p>who think Elon is overrated and you have no idea, right?</p>
<p>When you go see it, you have no idea.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s actually not what I&rsquo;m most impressed with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Tesla I&rsquo;m most impressed with.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because in my mind,</p>
<p>we just talked about what I think is the greatest threat,</p>
<p>the environmental stuff.</p>
<p>And I talked about our inability maybe all at the same time</p>
<p>to be willing to sacrifice our self interests</p>
<p>in order for the goal.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna put words in Elon&rsquo;s mouth,</p>
<p>so you can talk to him if you want to.</p>
<p>But in my mind, what he&rsquo;s done is recognize that problem.</p>
<p>And instead of building a car that&rsquo;s a piece of crap,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s good for the environment so you should drive it,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying to create a car that if you&rsquo;re only motivated</p>
<p>by your self interest, you&rsquo;ll buy it anyway.</p>
<p>And it will help the environment and help us transition away</p>
<p>from one of the main causes of damage.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things this pandemic</p>
<p>and the shutdown around the world has done</p>
<p>is show us how amazingly quickly</p>
<p>the earth can actually rejuvenate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing clear skies in places species come</p>
<p>and you would have thought it would have taken decades</p>
<p>for some of this stuff.</p>
<p>So what if to name just one major pollution source,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have the pollution caused by automobiles, right?</p>
<p>And if you had said to me, Dan,</p>
<p>what do you think the odds of us transitioning away</p>
<p>from that were 10 years ago,</p>
<p>I would have said, well, people aren&rsquo;t gonna do it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s inefficient, it&rsquo;s this, it&rsquo;s that,</p>
<p>nobody wants to, but what if you created a vehicle</p>
<p>that was superior in every way</p>
<p>so that if you were just a self oriented consumer,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d buy it because you wanted that car.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to get around that problem</p>
<p>of people not wanting to, I think he&rsquo;s identified that.</p>
<p>And as he&rsquo;s told me before,</p>
<p>when the last time a car company was created</p>
<p>that actually, blah, blah, blah, he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so I happen to feel that even though he&rsquo;s pushing</p>
<p>the envelope on the space thing,</p>
<p>I think somebody else would have done that someday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure because of the various things he&rsquo;s mentioned,</p>
<p>how difficult it is to start there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that the industries that create vehicles</p>
<p>for us would have gone where he&rsquo;s going to lead them</p>
<p>if he didn&rsquo;t force them there through consumer demand</p>
<p>by making a better car that people wanted anyway.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll follow, they&rsquo;ll copy, they&rsquo;ll do all those things.</p>
<p>And yet who was gonna do that?</p>
<p>So I hope he doesn&rsquo;t hate me for saying this,</p>
<p>but I happen to think the Tesla idea</p>
<p>may alleviate some of the need to get off this planet</p>
<p>because the planet&rsquo;s being destroyed, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna colonize Mars probably anyway</p>
<p>if we live long enough.</p>
<p>And I think the Tesla idea, not just Elon&rsquo;s version,</p>
<p>but ones that follow from other people</p>
<p>is the best chance of making sure we&rsquo;re around long enough</p>
<p>to see Mars colonized.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>And one other thing from my perspective,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m now starting a company,</p>
<p>I think the interesting thing about Elon</p>
<p>is he serves as a beacon of hope, like pragmatically speaking</p>
<p>for people that, sort of to push back</p>
<p>on our Doom conversation from earlier,</p>
<p>that a single individual could build something</p>
<p>that allows us as self interested individuals</p>
<p>to gather together in a collective way</p>
<p>to actually alleviate some of the dangers</p>
<p>that face our world.</p>
<p>So it gives me hope as an individual</p>
<p>that I can build something that can actually have impact</p>
<p>that counteracts the Stalins and the Hitlers</p>
<p>and all the threats that face that human civilization faces,</p>
<p>that an individual has that power.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t believe that the individual has that power</p>
<p>in the halls of government.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t feel like any one presidential candidate</p>
<p>can rise up and help the world, unite the world.</p>
<p>It feels like from everything I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re right with Tesla,</p>
<p>it can bring the world together to do good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really powerful mechanism</p>
<p>of whatever you say about capitalism,</p>
<p>that you can build companies that start,</p>
<p>it starts with a single individual.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a collective that grows around that,</p>
<p>but the leadership of a single individual,</p>
<p>their ideas, their dreams, their vision</p>
<p>can catalyze something that takes over the world</p>
<p>and does good for the entire world.</p>
<p>But if I think, but again, I think the genius of the idea</p>
<p>is that it doesn&rsquo;t require us</p>
<p>to go head to head with human nature, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually built human nature into the idea</p>
<p>by basically saying, I&rsquo;m not asking you</p>
<p>to be an environmental activist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking you to sacrifice to make it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna sell you a car you&rsquo;re going to like better.</p>
<p>And by buying it, you&rsquo;ll help the environment.</p>
<p>That takes into account our foibles as a species</p>
<p>and actually leverages that to work for the greater good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the sort of thing that does turn off</p>
<p>my little doom caster cynicism thing a little bit</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re actually hitting us where we live, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not, you can take somebody</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t even believe the environment&rsquo;s a problem,</p>
<p>but they want a Tesla.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re inadvertently helping anyway.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the genius of the idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m telling you, that&rsquo;s one way to make love</p>
<p>a much more efficient mechanism of change than hate.</p>
<p>Making it in your self interest to love somebody.</p>
<p>Making it in your self interest, creating a product</p>
<p>that leads to more love than hate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna wanna love your neighbor</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna make a fortune.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, okay, I get it.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he said.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;m on board.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Elon said love is the answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, exactly what he meant.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s try something difficult.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve recorded an episode of Steering Into the Iceberg</p>
<p>on your Common Sense program.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That has started a lot of conversations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite moving, it was quite haunting.</p>
<p>Got me a lot of angry emails.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I did something I haven&rsquo;t done in 30 years.</p>
<p>I endorsed a political candidate</p>
<p>from one of the two main parties</p>
<p>and there were a lot of disillusioned people</p>
<p>because of that.</p>
<p>I guess I didn&rsquo;t hear it as an endorsement.</p>
<p>I just heard it as the similar flavor of conversation</p>
<p>as you have in hardcore history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost the speaking about modern times</p>
<p>in the same voice as you speak about</p>
<p>when you talk about history.</p>
<p>So it was just a little bit of a haunting view</p>
<p>of the world today.</p>
<p>I know we were just wearing our doom caster.</p>
<p>Let me put that right back on, are you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I like the term doom caster.</p>
<p>How do we get love to win?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the way out of this?</p>
<p>Is there some hopeful line that we can walk</p>
<p>to avoid something, and I hate to use the terminology,</p>
<p>but something that looks like a civil war,</p>
<p>not necessarily a war of force,</p>
<p>but a division to a level where it doesn&rsquo;t any longer feel</p>
<p>like a United States of America with an emphasis on United.</p>
<p>Is there a way out?</p>
<p>I read a book a while back.</p>
<p>I want to say George Friedman, the Stratfor guy wrote it.</p>
<p>It was something called The Next Hundred Years,</p>
<p>I think it was called.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking, I didn&rsquo;t agree with any of it.</p>
<p>And one of the things I think he said in the book</p>
<p>was that the United States was going to break up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going from memory here.</p>
<p>He might not have said that at all,</p>
<p>but something was stuck in my memory about that.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking,</p>
<p>but I think some of the arguments were connected</p>
<p>to the differences that we had</p>
<p>and the fact that those differences are being exploited.</p>
<p>So we talked about media earlier</p>
<p>and the lack of truth and everything.</p>
<p>We have a media climate that is incentivized</p>
<p>to take the wedges in our society and make them wider.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no countervailing force to do the opposite</p>
<p>or to help.</p>
<p>So there was a famous memo</p>
<p>from a group called Project for a New American Century.</p>
<p>And they took it down,</p>
<p>but the Wayback Machine online still has it.</p>
<p>And it happened before 9 11,</p>
<p>spawned all kinds of conspiracy theories</p>
<p>because it was saying something to the effect of,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m really paraphrasing here,</p>
<p>but you know that the United States</p>
<p>needs another Pearl Harbor type event</p>
<p>because those galvanize a country</p>
<p>that without those kinds of events periodically</p>
<p>is naturally geared towards pulling itself apart.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s those periodic events</p>
<p>that act as the countervailing force</p>
<p>that otherwise is not there.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>then we are naturally inclined towards pulling ourselves apart.</p>
<p>So to have a media environment</p>
<p>that makes money off widening those divisions,</p>
<p>which we do.</p>
<p>I mean, I was in talk radio</p>
<p>and it has those people,</p>
<p>the people that used to scream at me</p>
<p>cause I wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But I mean, we would have these terrible conversations</p>
<p>after every broadcast</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;d be in there with the program director</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re yelling at me about heat.</p>
<p>Heat was the word they create more heat.</p>
<p>Well, what is heat, right?</p>
<p>Heat is division, right?</p>
<p>And they want the heat,</p>
<p>not because they&rsquo;re political,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not Republicans or Democrats either.</p>
<p>We want listeners</p>
<p>and we want engagement and involvement.</p>
<p>And because of the constructs of the format,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to get it.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t have me giving you like on a podcast</p>
<p>an hour and a half or two hours</p>
<p>where we build a logical argument</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re with me the whole way,</p>
<p>your audience is changing every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>So whatever points you make to create interest</p>
<p>and intrigue and engagement have to be knee jerk right now.</p>
<p>Things, they told me once</p>
<p>that the audience has to know</p>
<p>where you stand on every single issue</p>
<p>within five minutes of turning on your show.</p>
<p>In other words, you have to be part</p>
<p>of a linear set of political beliefs</p>
<p>so that if you feel A about subject A,</p>
<p>then you must feel D about subject D.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even need to hear your opinion on it</p>
<p>cause if you feel that way about A,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna feel that way about D.</p>
<p>This is a system that is designed</p>
<p>to pull us apart for profit,</p>
<p>but not because they wanna pull us apart, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a byproduct of the profit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one little example of 50 examples in our society</p>
<p>that work in that same fashion.</p>
<p>So what that project</p>
<p>for a new American century document was saying</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re naturally inclined towards disunity</p>
<p>and without things to occasionally ratchet</p>
<p>the unity back up again,</p>
<p>so that we can start from the baseline again</p>
<p>and then pull ourselves apart till the next Pearl Harbor,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll pull yourself apart,</p>
<p>which I think was,</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what the George Friedman book was saying</p>
<p>that I disagreed with so much at the time.</p>
<p>So in answer to your question about civil wars,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t have the same kind of civil war</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have a geographical division</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as clear cut as the one we had before, right?</p>
<p>You had a basically north south line and some border states.</p>
<p>It was set up for that kind of a split.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re divided within communities, within families,</p>
<p>within gerrymandered voting districts and precincts, right?</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t disengage.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re stuck with each other.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s a civil war now,</p>
<p>for lack of a better word,</p>
<p>what it might seem like is the late 1960s, early 1970s,</p>
<p>where you had the bombings</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s call it domestic terrorism and things like that,</p>
<p>because that would seem to be something</p>
<p>that once again, you don&rsquo;t even need a large chunk</p>
<p>of the country pulling apart.</p>
<p>10% of people who think it&rsquo;s the end times</p>
<p>can do the damage.</p>
<p>Just like we talked about terrorism before</p>
<p>and a can of gas and a big lighter,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in a bunch of places</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t give anybody ideas</p>
<p>where a can of gas and a big lighter</p>
<p>would take a thousand houses down before you could blink.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>That terrorist doesn&rsquo;t have to be from the Middle East,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to have some sort of a fundamentalist</p>
<p>or religious agenda.</p>
<p>It could just be somebody really pissed off</p>
<p>about the election results.</p>
<p>So once again, if we&rsquo;re playing an odds game here,</p>
<p>everybody has to behave for this to work right.</p>
<p>Only a few people have to misbehave</p>
<p>for this thing to go sideways.</p>
<p>And remember, for every action,</p>
<p>there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t even have to have those people</p>
<p>doing all these things.</p>
<p>All they have to do is start a tit for tat retribution cycle.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an escalation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it creates a momentum of its own,</p>
<p>which leads fundamentally,</p>
<p>if you follow the chain of events down there</p>
<p>to some form of dictatorial government</p>
<p>as the only way to create stability, right?</p>
<p>You want to destroy the Republic and have a dictator,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you do.</p>
<p>And there are parallels to Nazi Germany,</p>
<p>the burning of the Reichstag, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the doom caster again, aren&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p>And some of it could be manufactured</p>
<p>by those seeking authoritarian power.</p>
<p>Absolutely, like the Reichstag fire was</p>
<p>or the Polish soldiers that fired over the border</p>
<p>before the invasion in 1939.</p>
<p>To fight the devil&rsquo;s advocate with an angel&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>I would say just as our conversation about Elon,</p>
<p>it feels like individuals have power to unite us,</p>
<p>to be that force of unity.</p>
<p>So you mentioned the media.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re one of the great podcasters in history.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan is like a long form, whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not podcasting, it&rsquo;s actually whatever the, yeah.</p>
<p>Very infrequent is what it is, no matter what it is.</p>
<p>But the basic process of it is you go deep</p>
<p>and you stay deep and the listener stays</p>
<p>with you for a long time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just looking at the numbers,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re almost three hours in.</p>
<p>And from previous episodes, I can tell you</p>
<p>that about 300,000 people are still listening</p>
<p>to the sound of our voice three hours in.</p>
<p>So usually it&rsquo;s 300 to 500,000 people listen</p>
<p>and they tune out.</p>
<p>Congratulations, by the way, that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan is like 10 times that.</p>
<p>And so he has power to unite.</p>
<p>You have power to unite.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few people with voices</p>
<p>that it feels like they have power to unite.</p>
<p>Even if you quote unquote endorse a candidate and so on,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still, it feels to me that speaking of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna keep saying love,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s love and maybe unity more practically speaking</p>
<p>that like sanity, that like respect</p>
<p>for those you don&rsquo;t agree with or don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>So empathy, just a few voices of those can help us avoid</p>
<p>the really importantly, not avoid the singular events,</p>
<p>like you said, of somebody starting a fire and so on,</p>
<p>but avoid the escalation of it.</p>
<p>The preparedness of the populace to escalate those events,</p>
<p>to turn a singular event and a single riot or a shooting</p>
<p>or like even something much more dramatic than that,</p>
<p>to turn that into something that creates</p>
<p>like ripples that grow as opposed to ripples that fade away.</p>
<p>And so like, I would like to put responsibility</p>
<p>on somebody like you and on me in some small way.</p>
<p>And Joe, being cognizant of the fact</p>
<p>that a lot of very destructive things</p>
<p>might happen in November.</p>
<p>And a few voices can save us is the feeling I have.</p>
<p>Not by saying who you should vote for</p>
<p>or any of that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but really by being the voice of calm</p>
<p>that like calms the seas from</p>
<p>or whatever the analogy is from boiling up.</p>
<p>Because I truly am worried about,</p>
<p>this is the first time this year when I,</p>
<p>I sometimes, I somehow have felt</p>
<p>that the American project will go on forever.</p>
<p>When I came to this country, I just believed,</p>
<p>and I still think I&rsquo;m young, but like,</p>
<p>I have a dream of creating a company</p>
<p>that will do a lot of good for the world.</p>
<p>And I thought that America is the beacon of hope</p>
<p>for the world and the ideas of freedom,</p>
<p>but also the idea of empowering companies</p>
<p>that can do some good for the world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just worried about this America that filled me,</p>
<p>a kid that came from, our family came from nothing</p>
<p>and from Russia as it was, Soviet Union as it was,</p>
<p>to be able to do anything in this new country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just worried about it.</p>
<p>And it feels like a few people</p>
<p>can still keep this project going.</p>
<p>Like people like Elon, people like Joe.</p>
<p>Is there, do you have a bit of that hope?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching this experiment with social media right now.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even mean social media,</p>
<p>really expand that out to,</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like we&rsquo;re all guinea pigs right now,</p>
<p>watching, you know, I have two kids and just watching,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a three year space between the two of them,</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s 18, the other&rsquo;s 15.</p>
<p>And just, you know, when I was a kid,</p>
<p>a person who was 18 and 15 would not be that different,</p>
<p>just three years difference, more maturity.</p>
<p>But their life experiences,</p>
<p>you would easily classify those two people</p>
<p>as being in the same generation.</p>
<p>Now, because of the speed of technological change,</p>
<p>there is a vast difference between my 18 year old</p>
<p>and my 15 year old, and not in a maturity question,</p>
<p>just in what apps they use, how they relate to each other,</p>
<p>how they deal with their peers, their social skills,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things where you turn around and go,</p>
<p>this is uncharted territory, we&rsquo;ve never been here,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s gonna be interesting to see</p>
<p>what effect that has on society.</p>
<p>Now, as that relates to your question,</p>
<p>the most upsetting part about all that</p>
<p>is reading how people treat each other online.</p>
<p>And you know, there&rsquo;s lots of theories about this,</p>
<p>the fact that some of it is just for trolling laughs,</p>
<p>that some of it is just people are not interacting</p>
<p>face to face, so they feel free</p>
<p>to treat each other that way.</p>
<p>And I, of course, I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how,</p>
<p>if this is how we have always been as people, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always been this way, but we&rsquo;ve never had the means</p>
<p>to post our feelings publicly about it,</p>
<p>or if the environment and the social media</p>
<p>and everything else has provided a change</p>
<p>and changed us into something else.</p>
<p>Either way, when one reads how we treat one another</p>
<p>and the horrible things we say about one another online,</p>
<p>which seems like it shouldn&rsquo;t be that big of deal,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just words, but they have a cumulative effect.</p>
<p>I mean, when you, I was reading Meghan Markle,</p>
<p>who I don&rsquo;t know a lot about,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too much of the pop side of culture</p>
<p>for me to pay lip, but I read a story the other day</p>
<p>where she was talking about the abuse she took online</p>
<p>and how incredibly overwhelming it was</p>
<p>and how many people were doing it.</p>
<p>And you think to yourself, okay, this is something</p>
<p>that people who are in positions</p>
<p>of what you were discussing earlier</p>
<p>never had to deal with.</p>
<p>Let me ask you something, and boy, this is the ultimate</p>
<p>doomcaster thing of all time to say.</p>
<p>When you think of historical figures</p>
<p>that push things like love and peace</p>
<p>and creating bridges between enemies,</p>
<p>when you think of what happened to those people,</p>
<p>first of all, they&rsquo;re very dangerous.</p>
<p>Every society in the world has a better time,</p>
<p>easier time dealing with violence and things like that</p>
<p>than they do nonviolence.</p>
<p>Nonviolence is really difficult for governments</p>
<p>to deal with, for example.</p>
<p>What happens to Gandhi and Jesus and Martin Luther King?</p>
<p>And you think about all those people, right?</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re that, it&rsquo;s ironic, isn&rsquo;t it,</p>
<p>that these people who push for peaceful solutions</p>
<p>are so often killed, but it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re effective.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re killed, the effectiveness is diminished.</p>
<p>Why are they killed?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re effective, and the only way to stop them</p>
<p>is to eliminate them, because they&rsquo;re charismatic leaders</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t come around every day,</p>
<p>and if you eliminate them from the scene,</p>
<p>the odds are you&rsquo;re not gonna get another one for a while.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is the very things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about, which would have the effect</p>
<p>you think it would, right?</p>
<p>They would destabilize systems in a way</p>
<p>that most of us would consider positive,</p>
<p>but those systems have a way of protecting themselves,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And so I feel like history shows,</p>
<p>see, history&rsquo;s pretty pessimistic, I think, by and large.</p>
<p>If only because we can find so many examples</p>
<p>that just sound pessimistic.</p>
<p>But I feel like people who are dangerous</p>
<p>to the way things are tend to be removed.</p>
<p>Yes, but there&rsquo;s two things to say.</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re right, that history,</p>
<p>I feel like the ripples that love leaves in history</p>
<p>are less obvious to detect,</p>
<p>but are actually more transformational.</p>
<p>Like in this. Well, one could make a case about,</p>
<p>I mean, if you wanna talk about the long term value</p>
<p>of a Jesus, a Gandhi, but yeah, yes,</p>
<p>those people&rsquo;s ripples are still affecting people today.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you feel those ripples</p>
<p>through the general improvement of the quality of life</p>
<p>that we see throughout the generations.</p>
<p>Like you feel the ripples through the growth.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, I&rsquo;ll go along with you on that, okay.</p>
<p>But I would, even if that&rsquo;s not true,</p>
<p>I tend to believe that, and by the way,</p>
<p>the company that I&rsquo;m working on as a competitor</p>
<p>is exactly attacking this, which is a competitor to Twitter.</p>
<p>I think I can build a better Twitter as a first step.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long story in there.</p>
<p>I think a three year old child could build a better,</p>
<p>and this is not to denigrate you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure yours would be better than a three year old,</p>
<p>but Twitter is so, and listen, Facebook too,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really awful platforms for intellectual discussion</p>
<p>and meaningful discussion, and I&rsquo;m on it.</p>
<p>So let me just say, I&rsquo;m part of the problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re new to this, so it wasn&rsquo;t obvious at the time</p>
<p>how to do it, it&rsquo;s now, and now a three year old can do it.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that we live in a time where the tools</p>
<p>that people that are interested in providing love,</p>
<p>like the weapons of love are much more powerful.</p>
<p>So like the one nice thing about technology</p>
<p>is it allows anyone to build a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more powerful than any government.</p>
<p>So that could be very destructive,</p>
<p>but it could be also very positive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I tend to believe that somebody like Elon</p>
<p>that wants to do good for the world,</p>
<p>somebody like me and many like me</p>
<p>could have more power than any one government.</p>
<p>And by power, I mean the power to effect change,</p>
<p>which is different from Gandhi.</p>
<p>What do you do with government,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean to interrupt you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll forget my train of thought, I&rsquo;m getting old.</p>
<p>But I mean, how do you deal with the fact</p>
<p>that already governments who are afraid of this</p>
<p>are walling off their own internet systems</p>
<p>as a way to create firewalls simply to prevent you</p>
<p>from doing what you&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s an old line</p>
<p>that if voting really changed anything,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d never allow it.</p>
<p>If love through a modern day successor to Twitter</p>
<p>would really do what you want it to do,</p>
<p>and this would destabilize governments,</p>
<p>do you think that governments would take countermeasures</p>
<p>to squash that love before it got too dangerous?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several answers.</p>
<p>One, first of all, I don&rsquo;t actually,</p>
<p>to push back on something you said earlier,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think love is as much of an enemy of the state</p>
<p>as one would think.</p>
<p>Different states have different views.</p>
<p>I think the states want power,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t always think that love is in tension with power.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not just about love,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about rationality, it&rsquo;s reason, it&rsquo;s empathy,</p>
<p>all of those things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily think there always have to be</p>
<p>by definition in conflict with each other.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one sense is I feel like basically</p>
<p>you can Trojan horse love into behind,</p>
<p>but you have to be good at it.</p>
<p>This is the thing,</p>
<p>is you have to be conscious of the way these states think.</p>
<p>So the fact that China bans certain services and so on,</p>
<p>that means the companies weren&rsquo;t eloquent,</p>
<p>whoever the companies are,</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t actually good at infiltrating.</p>
<p>I think, isn&rsquo;t that a song, like love is a battlefield?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all a cap editor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a game, and you have to be good at the game.</p>
<p>And just like Elon, we said with Tesla</p>
<p>and saving the environment.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not just by getting on a stage</p>
<p>and saying it&rsquo;s important to save the environment,</p>
<p>is by building a product that people can&rsquo;t help but love</p>
<p>and then convincing Hollywood stars to love it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a game to be played.</p>
<p>Okay, so let me build on that</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s a way to see this.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And so it has to do with a story about the 1960s.</p>
<p>In the vast scheme of things, the 1960s looks like</p>
<p>a revival of neo romantic ideas, right?</p>
<p>I had a buddy of mine several years,</p>
<p>well, two decades older than I was who was in the 60s,</p>
<p>went to the protest, did all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And we were talking about it and I was romanticizing it.</p>
<p>He said, don&rsquo;t romanticize it.</p>
<p>He goes, let me tell you, most of the people</p>
<p>that went to those protests and did all those things,</p>
<p>all they were there was to meet girls and have a good time.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t so,</p>
<p>but it became in vogue to have all,</p>
<p>in other words, let&rsquo;s talk about your empathy and love.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna, in my opinion,</p>
<p>grab that great mass of people that are only in it</p>
<p>for their interest in whatever.</p>
<p>But if meeting girls for a young teenage guy</p>
<p>requires you to feign empathy,</p>
<p>requires you to read deeper subjects</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what people are into,</p>
<p>you can almost, as a silly way to be trendy,</p>
<p>you could make maybe empathy trendy, love trendy,</p>
<p>solutions that are the opposite of that,</p>
<p>the kind of things that people inherently</p>
<p>will not put up with.</p>
<p>In other words, the possibility exists</p>
<p>to change the zeitgeist and reorient it in a way</p>
<p>that even if most of the people aren&rsquo;t serious about it,</p>
<p>the results are the same.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Absolutely. Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve found a meeting of the moments.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Creating incentives that encourage the best</p>
<p>and the most beautiful aspects of human nature.</p>
<p>Even against our will.</p>
<p>It all boils down to meeting girls and boys.</p>
<p>Once again, you&rsquo;re getting to the bottom</p>
<p>of the evolutionary motivations</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re always on safe ground when you do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little difficult for me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s actually difficult for you</p>
<p>to listen to me say complimenting you,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s difficult for both of us, okay?</p>
<p>So, but you and I, as I mentioned to you,</p>
<p>I think off mic, been friends for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just been one way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two way now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the beauty of podcasting.</p>
<p>Now, just been fortunate enough</p>
<p>with this particular podcast</p>
<p>that I see it in people&rsquo;s eyes when they meet me,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been friends with me for a few years now.</p>
<p>And we become fast friends actually after we start talking.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s one way in the vet in that first moment.</p>
<p>You know, like there&rsquo;s something about</p>
<p>the especially hardcore history that,</p>
<p>you know, I do some crazy challenges and running and stuff.</p>
<p>I remember in particular, probably don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>One of my favorite episodes, the painful tainment one.</p>
<p>Some people hate that episode.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s too real.</p>
<p>Yeah, they can&rsquo;t listen to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my darkest one.</p>
<p>We wanted to set a baseline.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the baseline.</p>
<p>But I remember listening to that</p>
<p>when I ran 22 miles for me, that was a long distance.</p>
<p>Holy cow, that&rsquo;s painful tainment right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it just pulls you in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something so powerful</p>
<p>about this particular creation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s bigger than you actually, that you&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>I think anything that is successful like that,</p>
<p>like Elon&rsquo;s stuff too, it becomes bigger than you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re hoping for, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt you, I apologize.</p>
<p>I guess a question I have, if you look in the mirror,</p>
<p>but you also look at me,</p>
<p>what advice would you give to yourself and to me</p>
<p>and to other podcasters, maybe to Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>about this journey that we&rsquo;re on?</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s something special.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>But it feels like podcasting is special.</p>
<p>What advice, and I&rsquo;m relatively new to it,</p>
<p>what advice do you have for people</p>
<p>that are carrying this flame and traveling this journey?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m often asked for advice by new podcasters,</p>
<p>people just starting out.</p>
<p>And so I have sort of a tried and true list</p>
<p>of do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have advice or suggestions for you or for Joe.</p>
<p>Joe doesn&rsquo;t need anything from me.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s figured it out, right?</p>
<p>I mean, he hasn&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still a confused kid, curious about the world.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the genius of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it work, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Joe&rsquo;s brand is, right?</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>by the time you reach the stage that you&rsquo;re at,</p>
<p>or Joe&rsquo;s at, they don&rsquo;t need it.</p>
<p>They have figured this out.</p>
<p>The people that sometimes need help are brand new people</p>
<p>trying to figure out what do I do with my first show</p>
<p>and how do I talk into them?</p>
<p>And I have standard answers for that.</p>
<p>But you found your niche.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t need me to tell you what to do.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I might ask you questions</p>
<p>about how you do what you do, right?</p>
<p>Well, I guess there&rsquo;s specific things</p>
<p>like we were talking offline about monetization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating one.</p>
<p>Very difficult as an independent, yeah.</p>
<p>And one of the things that Joe is facing</p>
<p>with, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>but he joined Spotify with a $100 million deal</p>
<p>for going exclusive on their platform.</p>
<p>The idea of exclusivity that,</p>
<p>one, I don&rsquo;t give a damn about money personally,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m single, and I like living in a shitty place.</p>
<p>So I enjoy, so I guess it makes it easy.</p>
<p>You get the freedom, right, to not care, yeah.</p>
<p>Freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s freedom.</p>
<p>Not saving for anybody&rsquo;s college.</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so on that point, but I also,</p>
<p>okay, maybe it&rsquo;s romanticization,</p>
<p>but I feel like podcasting is pirate radio.</p>
<p>And when I first heard about Spotify partnering up with Joe,</p>
<p>I was like, you know, fuck the man.</p>
<p>I said, I even, I drafted a few tweets and so on,</p>
<p>just like attacking Spotify, then I calmed myself down</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t lock up this special thing we have.</p>
<p>But then I realized that maybe</p>
<p>that these are vehicles for just reaching more people</p>
<p>and actually respecting podcasters more and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean by it&rsquo;s unclear what the journey is</p>
<p>because you also serve as beacon for,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s like millions, one million plus podcasters.</p>
<p>I wonder what the journey is.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense,</p>
<p>are you romantic in the same kind of way</p>
<p>in feeling that, because you have a roots in radio too.</p>
<p>Do you feel that podcasting is pirate radio</p>
<p>or is the Spotify thing one possible avenue?</p>
<p>Are you nervous about Joe as a fan, as a friend of Joe</p>
<p>or is this a good thing for us?</p>
<p>So my history of how I got involved</p>
<p>in podcasting is interesting.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I was in radio and then I started a company</p>
<p>back in the era where the dot com boom was happening</p>
<p>and everybody was being bought up</p>
<p>and it just seemed like a great idea, right?</p>
<p>I did it with six other people</p>
<p>and the whole goal of the company was,</p>
<p>we had to invent the term.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure everybody, there&rsquo;s other places</p>
<p>that invented it at the same time.</p>
<p>But what we were pitching to investors</p>
<p>was something called amateur content.</p>
<p>So this is before YouTube, before podcasting,</p>
<p>before all this stuff.</p>
<p>And my job was to be the evangelist.</p>
<p>And I would go to these people and talk</p>
<p>and sing the praises of all the ways</p>
<p>that amateur content was gonna be great.</p>
<p>And I never got a bite.</p>
<p>And they all told me the same thing.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t gonna take off</p>
<p>cause anybody who&rsquo;s good is already gonna be making money</p>
<p>at this.</p>
<p>And I kept saying, forget that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about scale here.</p>
<p>If you have millions of pieces of content</p>
<p>being made every week, a small percentage</p>
<p>is gonna be good no matter what, right?</p>
<p>16 year olds will know what other 16 year olds like.</p>
<p>I kept pushing this nobody bit.</p>
<p>But the podcast grew out of that</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re talking about amateur content in 1999,</p>
<p>well then you&rsquo;re already, you&rsquo;re ahead of the game</p>
<p>in terms of not seeing where it&rsquo;s gonna go financially</p>
<p>but seeing where it&rsquo;s going to go technologically.</p>
<p>And so when we started the podcast in 2005</p>
<p>and it was the political one, not hardcore history,</p>
<p>which was an outgrowth of the old radio show,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have any financial ideas.</p>
<p>We were simply trying to get our handle on the technology</p>
<p>and how you distribute it to people and all that.</p>
<p>And it was years later that we tried to figure out,</p>
<p>okay, how can we get enough money</p>
<p>to just support us while we&rsquo;re doing this?</p>
<p>And the cheap and the easy way</p>
<p>was just to ask listeners to donate like a PBS kind of model.</p>
<p>And that was the original model.</p>
<p>So then once we started down that,</p>
<p>we figured out other models and there&rsquo;s the advertising thing</p>
<p>and that we sell the old shows.</p>
<p>And so all these became ways for us to support ourselves.</p>
<p>But as podcasting matured</p>
<p>and as more operating systems developed</p>
<p>and phones were developed and all these kinds of things,</p>
<p>every one of those developments,</p>
<p>which actually made it easier for people to get the podcast</p>
<p>actually made it more complex to make money off of them.</p>
<p>So while our audience was building,</p>
<p>the amount of time and effort we had to put</p>
<p>into the monetization side began to skyrocket.</p>
<p>So to get back to your Spotify question,</p>
<p>to use just one example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who are doing similar things.</p>
<p>In this day and age, we used to just sell MP3 files.</p>
<p>And all you had to have was an MP3 player,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cheap and dirty.</p>
<p>Now, every time there&rsquo;s an OS upgrade,</p>
<p>something breaks for us.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re having, I mean, my choices are at this point</p>
<p>to start hiring staff, more staff,</p>
<p>and then be a human resources manager.</p>
<p>I mean, the pirate radio side of this</p>
<p>was the pirate radio side of this</p>
<p>because you didn&rsquo;t need anybody,</p>
<p>but you know, you or you and another,</p>
<p>I mean, you could just do this lean and mean,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s becoming hard to do it lean and mean now.</p>
<p>So if somebody like a Spotify comes in and says,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;ll handle that stuff for you.</p>
<p>In the past, I would just say,</p>
<p>F off, we don&rsquo;t need you, I don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>And I definitely am not making what we could make on this,</p>
<p>but what we would have to do to make that is onerous to me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s becoming onerous to me day to day anyway.</p>
<p>And so if somebody were to come in and say,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;ll pick that up for you,</p>
<p>we will not interfere with your content at all,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t, and in my case, you can&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>we need to show a month because that ain&rsquo;t happening, right?</p>
<p>So I mean, everybody&rsquo;s design is different, right?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t, you know, there&rsquo;s not one size fits all,</p>
<p>but I guess as a long time pirate podcaster,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been looking to partner with people,</p>
<p>but nobody&rsquo;s right for us to partner with.</p>
<p>I mean, so I&rsquo;m always looking for ways</p>
<p>to take that side of it off my plate</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not interested in that side.</p>
<p>All I wanna do is the shows,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really at this point,</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t call yourself an artist</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s something to be decided by others.</p>
<p>But I mean, we&rsquo;re trying to do art</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something very satisfying in that.</p>
<p>But the part that I can&rsquo;t stand</p>
<p>is the increasing amount of time</p>
<p>the monetization question takes upon us.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a case to be made, I guess is what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>that if a partnership with some outside firm</p>
<p>enhances your ability to do the art</p>
<p>without disenhancing your ability to do the art,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, the word I&rsquo;m looking for here is it&rsquo;s enticing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like big companies.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m afraid of whatever strings might come with that.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m Joe Rogan and I&rsquo;m talking about subjects</p>
<p>that can make public companies a little nervous,</p>
<p>I would certainly be careful.</p>
<p>But at the same time, people who are not in this game</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand the problems that literally,</p>
<p>I mean, just all the operating systems, all the podcatchers,</p>
<p>every time some new podcatcher comes up,</p>
<p>makes it easier to get the podcast,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something we have to account for on the back end.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not exactly the technological wizard of all time.</p>
<p>So I think it is maybe, maybe the short answer is,</p>
<p>is that as the medium develops,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s becoming something that you have to consider,</p>
<p>not because you wanna sell out,</p>
<p>but because you wanna keep going.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s becoming harder and harder to be pirate like</p>
<p>in this environment.</p>
<p>The thing that convinced me, especially inside Spotify,</p>
<p>is that they understand,</p>
<p>so if you walk into this whole thing with some skepticism,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re saying, of big companies,</p>
<p>then it works because Spotify understands the magic</p>
<p>that makes podcasting, or they appear to in part,</p>
<p>at least they understand enough to respect Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>And despite what, I don&rsquo;t know if you,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s the internet and there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>with opinions on the internet.</p>
<p>Really? Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not heard about that.</p>
<p>And they have opinions about Joe and Spotify.</p>
<p>But the reality is, there&rsquo;s two things</p>
<p>in private conversation with Joe,</p>
<p>and in general, there&rsquo;s two important things.</p>
<p>One, Spotify literally doesn&rsquo;t tell Joe anything.</p>
<p>Like all the people that think that Spotify</p>
<p>is somehow pushing Joe in this direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a contractual, didn&rsquo;t he insist upon that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the contract.</p>
<p>But also, companies have a way of,</p>
<p>even with the contract. They sure do.</p>
<p>To be marketing people, hey, I know we&rsquo;re not forcing you.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I hate that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>You and Joe are the same,</p>
<p>and Spotify is smart enough</p>
<p>not to send a single email of that kind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really smart.</p>
<p>And they leave them be.</p>
<p>There is meetings inside Spotify that people complain,</p>
<p>but those meetings never reach Joe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like company stuff.</p>
<p>And the idea that Spotify is different than pirate radio,</p>
<p>the difficult thing about podcasting</p>
<p>is nobody gives a damn about your podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re alone in this.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s fans and stuff, but nobody.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s looking out for you.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>And the nice thing about Spotify</p>
<p>is they want Joe&rsquo;s podcast to succeed even more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Joe talked about</p>
<p>is that&rsquo;s the difference between YouTube and Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify wants to be the Netflix of podcasting.</p>
<p>And they, like what Netflix does</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t want to control you in any way,</p>
<p>but they want to create a platform where you can flourish.</p>
<p>Even more.</p>
<p>Because your interests are aligned.</p>
<p>Interests are aligned.</p>
<p>So let me bring up something that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make a distinction</p>
<p>because not all companies who do this are the same.</p>
<p>And you brought up YouTube and Spotify,</p>
<p>but to me, YouTube is at least more like Spotify</p>
<p>than some of these smaller.</p>
<p>The term is walled garden, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard the term walled garden?</p>
<p>Yes. Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been around podcasting so long now</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve seen rounds of consolidation over the years</p>
<p>and they come in waves and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll get, and I&rsquo;m not going to mention any names,</p>
<p>but up until recently,</p>
<p>the consolidation was happening with relatively small firms</p>
<p>compared to people like Spotify.</p>
<p>And the problem was,</p>
<p>is that by deciding to consolidate your materials</p>
<p>in a walled garden,</p>
<p>you are walling yourself off from audience, right?</p>
<p>So your choice is I&rsquo;m going to accept this amount of money</p>
<p>from this company,</p>
<p>but the loss is going to be a large chunk of my audience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a catch 22</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re negotiating power with that company</p>
<p>is based on your audience size.</p>
<p>So signing up with them diminishes your audience size,</p>
<p>you lose negotiating power.</p>
<p>But when you get to the level of the Spotify</p>
<p>to just pick them out, there&rsquo;s other players,</p>
<p>but you brought up Spotify specifically,</p>
<p>these are people who can potentially,</p>
<p>potentially enhance your audience over time.</p>
<p>And so the risk to you is lower</p>
<p>because if you decide in a year or two,</p>
<p>whatever the licensing agreements term is,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re done with them and you want to leave,</p>
<p>instead of how you would have been</p>
<p>with some of these smaller walled gardens,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re walking away with a fraction of the audience</p>
<p>you walked in with,</p>
<p>you have the potential to walk out</p>
<p>with whatever you got in the original deal,</p>
<p>plus a larger audience,</p>
<p>because their algorithms and everything</p>
<p>are designed to push people to your content</p>
<p>if they think you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>So it takes away some of the downside risk,</p>
<p>which alleviates,</p>
<p>and if you can write an agreement like Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>I mean, where you&rsquo;ve protected your freedom</p>
<p>to put the content out the way you want.</p>
<p>So, and if some of the downside risk is mitigated,</p>
<p>and if you eliminate the problem of trying to monetize</p>
<p>and stay up with the latest tech,</p>
<p>then it might be worth it.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m scared of things like that,</p>
<p>but at the same time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to not be an idiot about it,</p>
<p>and I can be an idiot about it.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;ve been doing it as independently</p>
<p>for as long as I have,</p>
<p>the inertia of that has a force all its own,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m inhibited enough in what I&rsquo;m trying to do</p>
<p>on this other end,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s opened me at least to listening to people.</p>
<p>But listen, at the same time, I love my audience,</p>
<p>and it sounds like a cliche,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re literally the reason I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>So I wanna make sure that whatever I do,</p>
<p>if I can, is in keeping with a relationship</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve developed with these people over 15 years.</p>
<p>But like you said, no matter what you do,</p>
<p>you are, because see, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t sign up with one of those companies</p>
<p>to make it easier for them to get your stuff on this hand,</p>
<p>they might yell at you for how difficult it is,</p>
<p>because the new operating system just updated,</p>
<p>and you said, I can&rsquo;t get your stuff.</p>
<p>So either way, you&rsquo;re opening yourself up to ridicule</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>All of that makes it easier to go,</p>
<p>well, if the right deal came along,</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t screwing me,</p>
<p>and they weren&rsquo;t screwing my audience, and blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I mean, again, in this business,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about cutting edge technology</p>
<p>that is ever changing,</p>
<p>and as you said, a million podcasts and growing,</p>
<p>I think you have to try to maintain flexibility,</p>
<p>and especially if they can mitigate the downside risk,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be an idiot to not at least try to stay up</p>
<p>on the current trends.</p>
<p>And look, I&rsquo;m watching Joe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going, okay, let&rsquo;s see how it goes for Joe.</p>
<p>I mean, if he&rsquo;s like, ah, this is terrible,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting out of this,</p>
<p>you go, okay, those people are off the list.</p>
<p>So Joe&rsquo;s put himself out as a guinea pig,</p>
<p>and the rest of us guinea pigs appreciate it.</p>
<p>As a huge, as a fan of your show,</p>
<p>and as a fan of Netflix, the people there,</p>
<p>I think I can speak for like millions of people</p>
<p>in hope that hardcore history comes to Netflix,</p>
<p>or if Spotify becomes the Netflix of podcasting,</p>
<p>then to Spotify.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something at its best</p>
<p>that they bring out the, you said artists,</p>
<p>so I can say it,</p>
<p>is they bring out the best out of the artists.</p>
<p>They remove some of the headache,</p>
<p>and somehow like they put at their best,</p>
<p>Netflix, for example, is able to enforce</p>
<p>and find the beauty and the power</p>
<p>in the creations that you make even better than you.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t interfere with the creations,</p>
<p>but they somehow, it&rsquo;s a branding thing probably too.</p>
<p>Yeah, but interfering would be,</p>
<p>that would be a no go for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, absolutely.</p>
<p>That can&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why Netflix is masterful.</p>
<p>They seem to not interfere with the talent,</p>
<p>as opposed to, I could throw other people under the bus,</p>
<p>like Amazon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of places under the bus</p>
<p>that could be thrown, absolutely.</p>
<p>So I would love, I know there&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>people screaming yes right now.</p>
<p>In terms of hardcore history on Netflix,</p>
<p>it would be awesome.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t love asking this question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s asked probably the most popular question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unanswerable.</p>
<p>So let me try to ask it in a way</p>
<p>that you would actually answer it,</p>
<p>which is, of course, you said</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t release shows very often.</p>
<p>And the question is, or the requests and the questions is,</p>
<p>well, can you tell Dan to do one on the Civil War?</p>
<p>Can you tell Dan to do one on the Napoleon Bonaparte?</p>
<p>Can you tell him to do one?</p>
<p>Every topic, and you&rsquo;ve spoken to this.</p>
<p>Actually, your answer about the Civil War</p>
<p>is quite interesting.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you knew what my answer</p>
<p>about the Civil War was.</p>
<p>As a military historian, you enjoy, in particular,</p>
<p>when there is differences in the armies,</p>
<p>as opposed to contrasts.</p>
<p>With the Civil War, which blew my mind</p>
<p>when I heard you say there&rsquo;s not an interesting,</p>
<p>a deep, intricate contrast between the two opposing sides.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Roman Civil Wars,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s legionary against legionary.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve also said that the shows you work on</p>
<p>are ones where you have some roots</p>
<p>of fundamental understanding about that period.</p>
<p>And so, when you work on a show,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically pulling at those strings further</p>
<p>and refreshing your mind and learning.</p>
<p>You have definitely done the research.</p>
<p>Wow, these are words out of my mouth.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But is there something like shower thoughts on Reddit?</p>
<p>Is there some ideas that are lingering in your head</p>
<p>about possible future episodes?</p>
<p>Is there things that, whether you&rsquo;re not committing</p>
<p>to anything, but whether you&rsquo;re gonna do it or not,</p>
<p>is there something that makes you think,</p>
<p>hmm, that&rsquo;ll be interesting to pull at that thread</p>
<p>a little bit?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we have things we keep in our back pocket</p>
<p>for later.</p>
<p>So, Blueprint for Armageddon, the first World War series</p>
<p>we did, that was in my back pocket the whole time.</p>
<p>And when the centennial of the war happened,</p>
<p>it just seemed to be the likely time to bring out what was.</p>
<p>That was a hell of a series.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably one of my favorite series.</p>
<p>Take my rear end, man.</p>
<p>I have to tell you.</p>
<p>Psychologically, you mean?</p>
<p>Well, just, you know, when you get to these,</p>
<p>I think, I&rsquo;m guessing here, I think it&rsquo;s 26 hours,</p>
<p>all pieces together.</p>
<p>Think about, and we don&rsquo;t do scripts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s improvised.</p>
<p>So, think about what, I had somebody write on Twitter</p>
<p>just yesterday saying, he said something like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not seeing the dedication here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only getting 2.5 shows out a year.</p>
<p>And I wanted to say, man, you have no idea what,</p>
<p>the only people who understand really</p>
<p>are other history podcasters.</p>
<p>And even they don&rsquo;t generally do 26 hours.</p>
<p>You know, that was a two year endeavor.</p>
<p>As I said, the first show we ever did was like 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I could crank out one of those a month.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re doing, I mean, the last show we did</p>
<p>on the fall of the Roman Republic was five and a half hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a book, right?</p>
<p>And it was part six or something.</p>
<p>So, I mean, you just do the math.</p>
<p>And it felt like you were, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>on World War I, it felt like you were emotionally</p>
<p>pulled in to it.</p>
<p>Like, it felt taxing.</p>
<p>I was gonna say, that&rsquo;s a good thing though,</p>
<p>because that, you know, and I think we said during the show,</p>
<p>that was the feeling that the people at the time have.</p>
<p>And I think at one point we said,</p>
<p>if this is starting to seem gruesomely repetitive,</p>
<p>now you know how the people at the time felt.</p>
<p>So in other words, that had sort of inadvertently,</p>
<p>because when you improvise a show,</p>
<p>some of these things are inadvertent,</p>
<p>but it had inadvertently created the right climate</p>
<p>for having a sense of empathy with the storyline.</p>
<p>And to me, those are the serendipitous moments</p>
<p>that make this art and not some sort of paint by the numbers</p>
<p>kind of endeavor, you know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, to me, that wouldn&rsquo;t have happened</p>
<p>had we scripted it out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s mostly, you just bring the tools of knowledge</p>
<p>to the table and then in large part improvise,</p>
<p>like the actual wording?</p>
<p>I always say we make it like they made things</p>
<p>like spinal tap and some of those other things</p>
<p>where the material, so I do have notes about things</p>
<p>like on page 427 of this book, you have this quote,</p>
<p>so that I know, aha, I&rsquo;m at the point</p>
<p>where I can drop that in.</p>
<p>And sometimes I&rsquo;ll write notes saying,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where you left off yesterday, so I remember.</p>
<p>But in the improvisation, you end up throwing a lot out.</p>
<p>And so like, but it allows us to go off on tangents,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ll try things.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll sit there and go,</p>
<p>I wonder what this would sound like.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll spend two days going down that road</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll listen to it and go, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, you know, like writers do this all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called killing your babies, right?</p>
<p>You got, can&rsquo;t, you know, but people go,</p>
<p>so this guy goes, I&rsquo;m not seeing the dedication.</p>
<p>He has no idea how many things we&rsquo;re throwing out.</p>
<p>I did an hour and a half,</p>
<p>I had an hour and a half into The Current Show</p>
<p>about two months ago.</p>
<p>And I listened to it and I just went, you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>Boom, out the window.</p>
<p>There goes six weeks of work, right?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Do you trust your, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>do you trust your judgment on that?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Our show is a little different than other people&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan called it evergreen content.</p>
<p>In other words, my political show is like a car you buy.</p>
<p>And the minute you drive it off the lot,</p>
<p>it loses half its value, right?</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s not current anymore.</p>
<p>These shows are just as good or just as bad</p>
<p>five years from now as they are when we,</p>
<p>although the standards on the internet changed.</p>
<p>So when I listen to my old shows,</p>
<p>I cringe sometimes cause the standards</p>
<p>are so much higher now.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re creating evergreen content,</p>
<p>you have two audiences to worry about.</p>
<p>You have the audience that&rsquo;s waiting for the next show</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve already heard the other ones</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re impatient and they&rsquo;re telling you on Twitter,</p>
<p>where is it?</p>
<p>But you have show,</p>
<p>the show is also for people five years from now</p>
<p>who haven&rsquo;t discovered it yet</p>
<p>and who don&rsquo;t care a wit for how long it took</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re gonna be able to download the whole,</p>
<p>and all they care about is quality.</p>
<p>And so what I always tell new podcasters is,</p>
<p>they always say, I read all these things,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very important you have a release schedule.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not more important</p>
<p>than putting out a good piece of work.</p>
<p>And the audience will forgive me if it takes too long,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really good when you get it.</p>
<p>They will not forgive me if I rush it</p>
<p>to get it out on time and it&rsquo;s a piece of crap.</p>
<p>So for us, and this is why when you brought up</p>
<p>a Spotify deal or anything else,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t interfere with this at all</p>
<p>because my job here, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned is quality</p>
<p>and everything else goes by the wayside</p>
<p>because the only thing people care about longterm,</p>
<p>the only thing that gives you longevity is how good is it?</p>
<p>How good is that book?</p>
<p>If you read J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s work tomorrow,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t care how long it took him to write it,</p>
<p>all you care is how good is it today?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we try to think too.</p>
<p>And I feel like if it&rsquo;s good, if it&rsquo;s really good,</p>
<p>everything else falls into place and takes care of itself.</p>
<p>And so sometimes to push back, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done it to you a thousand times,</p>
<p>so you can get me back, please.</p>
<p>Sometimes the deadline, some of the greatest movies</p>
<p>and books have been, you think about like Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>I forget which one, notes from underground or something.</p>
<p>He needed the money, so he had to write it real quick.</p>
<p>Sometimes the deadline creates is powerful</p>
<p>at taking a creative mind of an artist</p>
<p>and just like slapping it around</p>
<p>to force some of the good stuff out.</p>
<p>Now, the problem with history, of course,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s different definitions of good</p>
<p>that like it&rsquo;s not just about which you talk about,</p>
<p>which is the storytelling,</p>
<p>the richness of the storytelling.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re, again, not to compliment you too much,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re one of the great storytellers of our time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m sure if you put in a jail cell</p>
<p>and forced like somebody pointed a gun at you,</p>
<p>you could tell one hell of a good story,</p>
<p>but you still need the facts of history</p>
<p>or not necessarily the facts,</p>
<p>but like making sure you&rsquo;re painting the right full picture,</p>
<p>not perfectly right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I meant about the audience</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t understand what a history podcast,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just riff and be wrong.</p>
<p>So let me both oppose what you just said</p>
<p>and back up what you just said.</p>
<p>So I have a book that I wrote, right?</p>
<p>And in a book you have a hard deadline, right?</p>
<p>So Harper Collins had a hard deadline on that book.</p>
<p>So when I released it, I was mad</p>
<p>because I would have worked on it a lot longer,</p>
<p>which is my style, right?</p>
<p>Get it right.</p>
<p>But we had a chapter in that book</p>
<p>entitled pandemic prologue question mark.</p>
<p>And it was the book about the part about the black death</p>
<p>and the 1918 flu and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I was just doing an interview</p>
<p>with a Spanish journalist this morning who said,</p>
<p>did you ever think how lucky you got on that?</p>
<p>And first of all, lucky on a pandemic, it strikes you.</p>
<p>But had I had my druthers,</p>
<p>I would have kept that book working</p>
<p>in my study for months more</p>
<p>and the pandemic would have happened.</p>
<p>And that would have looked like a chapter</p>
<p>I wrote after the fact.</p>
<p>I would have had to rewrite the whole thing.</p>
<p>So that argues for what you said.</p>
<p>At the same time, I would have spent months more</p>
<p>working on it because to me,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t look the way I wanted it to look yet.</p>
<p>Can you drop a hint of the things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re keeping on the shelves?</p>
<p>Oh, the Alexander the Great podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked around, I talked to somebody the other day,</p>
<p>he said, do you know that the very first word</p>
<p>in your very first podcast, in the title,</p>
<p>the very first thing that anybody ever saw</p>
<p>with hardcore history is the word Alexander.</p>
<p>Because the show&rsquo;s entitled Alexander versus Hitler.</p>
<p>I have talked around the career.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done show after,</p>
<p>I talked about his mother in one episode.</p>
<p>I talked about the funeral games after his death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked around this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve specifically left this giant Alexandrian size hole</p>
<p>in the middle,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna do that show one day</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to lovingly enjoy talking about</p>
<p>this crazily interesting figure of Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the ones that&rsquo;s on the back pocket list.</p>
<p>And what we try to do is whenever this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing Second World War in Asia and the Pacific now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on part five, whenever the heck we finish this,</p>
<p>the tendency is to then pick a very different period</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve had it and the audience has had it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>So I will eventually get to the Alexander saga.</p>
<p>What about just one last kind of little part of this is,</p>
<p>what about the other half of that first 10 minute,</p>
<p>15 minute episode?</p>
<p>Which is, so you&rsquo;ve done quite a bit about the World War.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done quite a bit about Germany.</p>
<p>Will you ever think about doing Hitler and the Man?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because I talked earlier</p>
<p>about how I don&rsquo;t like to go back to the old shows</p>
<p>cause our standards have changed so much.</p>
<p>Well, a long time ago,</p>
<p>one of my standards for not getting five hour podcasts done</p>
<p>or not getting too deeply into them</p>
<p>was to flip around the interesting points.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t realize we were gonna get an audience</p>
<p>that wanted the actual history.</p>
<p>We thought we could just go with,</p>
<p>assume the audience knew the details</p>
<p>and just talk about the weird stuff</p>
<p>that only makes up one part of the show now.</p>
<p>So we did a show called Nazi tidbits.</p>
<p>And it was just little things about,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s totally out of date now.</p>
<p>Like, you know, you can still buy them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re out of date.</p>
<p>Where we dealt a little with it.</p>
<p>You know, it would be interesting,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll give you another example.</p>
<p>I mean, history is not stagnant, as you know.</p>
<p>And we had talked about Stalin earlier</p>
<p>and Ghost of the Ostfront was done years ago.</p>
<p>And people will write me from Russia now and say,</p>
<p>well, your portrayal of Stalin is totally out of,</p>
<p>out of, it&rsquo;s outdated because there&rsquo;s all this new stuff</p>
<p>from the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And you do, you turn around and you go, okay, they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And so when you talk about Hitler,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very interesting to think about</p>
<p>how I would do a Hitler show today</p>
<p>versus how I did one 10 years ago.</p>
<p>And you would think, well, what&rsquo;s new?</p>
<p>I mean, it happens a lot, but there&rsquo;s lots of new stuff</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s lots of new scholarship.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I would think that would be</p>
<p>an interesting one to do someday.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not in the back pocket,</p>
<p>but yeah, that&rsquo;d be interesting.</p>
<p>I have a disproportionate amount of power</p>
<p>because I trapped you somehow in a room and,</p>
<p>and thereby.</p>
<p>During a pandemic.</p>
<p>So like my hope will be stuck in your head,</p>
<p>but after Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>which would be an amazing podcast,</p>
<p>I hope you do give a return to Hitler,</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, which to me,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a contemporary book, basically.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>And I, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by a person who was there.</p>
<p>Shira, yeah.</p>
<p>I really loved that study of the man of Hitler.</p>
<p>And I would love to hear your study</p>
<p>of certain aspects of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps even an episode that&rsquo;s like more focused</p>
<p>on a very particular period.</p>
<p>I just feel like you can tell a story that it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Hitler is one of the most studied people.</p>
<p>And I still feel like all the stories</p>
<p>or most of the stories haven&rsquo;t been told.</p>
<p>Oh, and there&rsquo;s, listen, I&rsquo;ve got three books at home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on all the publishers lists now.</p>
<p>And they just, there&rsquo;s young Hitler,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this Hitler, there&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been reading these books</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve read about Hitler.</p>
<p>I read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</p>
<p>My mother thought I needed to go to a psychologist</p>
<p>because I read it when I was six.</p>
<p>And she said, there&rsquo;s something wrong with the boy.</p>
<p>And, but, but she was right.</p>
<p>She was absolutely right.</p>
<p>But, but you would think that,</p>
<p>that something like that is pretty established fact.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s new stuff coming out all the time.</p>
<p>And needless to say,</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s been investigating this guy forever.</p>
<p>And sometimes it takes years to get the translations.</p>
<p>I took five years of German in school.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t read any of it.</p>
<p>So, I mean, and he is,</p>
<p>when you talk about fascinating figures,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s so, the whole thing is so twistedly weird.</p>
<p>There was a, it came out a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Somebody found a tape of him talking to,</p>
<p>I want to say it was General,</p>
<p>the Finnish General Mannerheim, right?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s just in a very normal conversation</p>
<p>of the sort we&rsquo;re having now.</p>
<p>And, you know, the Hitler tapes,</p>
<p>when you hear him normally he&rsquo;s ranting and raving.</p>
<p>But this was a very sedate.</p>
<p>And I wish I&rsquo;d understood the German well enough</p>
<p>to really get a feel,</p>
<p>because I was reading what Germans said.</p>
<p>And they say, wow, you can really hear the Southern accent.</p>
<p>You know, little things</p>
<p>that only a native speaker would hear.</p>
<p>And I remember thinking,</p>
<p>this is such a different side of this twisted character.</p>
<p>And you would think you would always,</p>
<p>you would think that this was information</p>
<p>that was out in the rise and fall of the Third Reich,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And so this goes along with that stuff</p>
<p>about new stuff coming out all the time.</p>
<p>Alexander, new stuff coming out all the time.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Well, at least interpretations rather than factual data.</p>
<p>And those color your,</p>
<p>those give depth to your understanding.</p>
<p>Yes, and you want that because of the historiography.</p>
<p>People love that.</p>
<p>And that was a byproduct of my lack of credentials,</p>
<p>where we thought we&rsquo;re gonna bring in the historians,</p>
<p>and we call them audio footnotes,</p>
<p>right away for me to say, listen, I&rsquo;m not a historian,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll quote this guy who is so you can trust him.</p>
<p>But then we would quote other people</p>
<p>who had different views.</p>
<p>And people didn&rsquo;t realize that, you know,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not history majors,</p>
<p>that historians don&rsquo;t always agree on this stuff</p>
<p>and that they have disagreements and they love that.</p>
<p>So I love the fact that there&rsquo;s more stuff out there</p>
<p>because it allows us to then bring in other points of view</p>
<p>and sort of maybe three dimensionalize</p>
<p>or flesh out the story a little bit more.</p>
<p>Two last questions.</p>
<p>One really simple, one absurdly ridiculous,</p>
<p>and perhaps also simple.</p>
<p>First, who has been and is he real?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that for an answer?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like asking me, is Harvey the White Rabbit real?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s carrots all around the production room,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know what that means.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people demanded that I prove,</p>
<p>I somehow figure out a way to prove the existence.</p>
<p>If I said he was real, people would say, no, he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And if I said he was, if he wasn&rsquo;t real,</p>
<p>they would say, yes, he is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a Santa Claus Easter bunny kind of vibe there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, what is real anyway?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I told him if he exists.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The most absurd question, I&rsquo;m very sorry.</p>
<p>Very sorry, but then again, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>You study history, human history.</p>
<p>Have you been able to make sense of why the hell</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re here on this spinning rock?</p>
<p>Does any of it even make sense?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>What I look at sometimes that I find interesting</p>
<p>is certain consistencies that we have over time.</p>
<p>History doesn&rsquo;t repeat, but it has a constant,</p>
<p>and the constant is us.</p>
<p>Now we change.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier the wickedly weird time we live in</p>
<p>with what social media is doing to us as guinea pigs,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a new element, but we&rsquo;re still people</p>
<p>who are motivated by love, hate, greed, envy, sex.</p>
<p>I mean, all these things that would have connected us</p>
<p>with the ancients, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the part that always makes history sound</p>
<p>like it rhymes, you know?</p>
<p>And when you put the constant, the human element,</p>
<p>and you mix it with systems that are similar,</p>
<p>so one of the reasons that the ancient Roman Republic</p>
<p>is something that people point to all the time</p>
<p>as something that seems like we&rsquo;re repeating history</p>
<p>is because you have humans, just like you had then,</p>
<p>and you have a system that resembles the one we have here.</p>
<p>So you throw the constant in with a system</p>
<p>that is somewhat similar, and you begin to see things</p>
<p>that look like they rhyme a little.</p>
<p>So for me, I&rsquo;m always trying to figure out more about us,</p>
<p>and when you show us in 500 years ago in Asia,</p>
<p>and 800 years ago in Africa,</p>
<p>and you look at all these different places</p>
<p>that you put the guinea pig in,</p>
<p>and you watch how the guinea pig responds</p>
<p>to the different stimuli and challenges,</p>
<p>I feel like it helps me flesh out a little bit more</p>
<p>who we are in the long timeline.</p>
<p>Not who we are today, specifically,</p>
<p>but who we&rsquo;ve always been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a personal quest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not meant to educate anybody else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that fascinates me.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s, in that common humanity</p>
<p>throughout history of the guinea pig,</p>
<p>is there a why underneath it all?</p>
<p>Or is it somehow, like, it feels like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an experiment of some sort?</p>
<p>Oh, now you&rsquo;re into it.</p>
<p>Elon Musk and I talked about this,</p>
<p>the simulation thing, right?</p>
<p>Nick Bostrom&rsquo;s, yeah, the idea that there&rsquo;s some kid,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re the equivalent of an alien&rsquo;s ant farm, you know?</p>
<p>And we hope he doesn&rsquo;t throw a tarantula in</p>
<p>just to see what happens.</p>
<p>I think the whys elude us.</p>
<p>And I think that what makes philosophy and religion</p>
<p>and those sorts of things so interesting</p>
<p>is that they grapple with the whys.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not wise enough to propose a theory</p>
<p>in myself, but I&rsquo;m interested enough</p>
<p>to read all the other ones out there.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s put it this way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any definitive why</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been agreed upon,</p>
<p>but the various theories are fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, whatever it is, whoever the kid is</p>
<p>that created this thing, the ant farm,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Well, so far, a little bit twisted</p>
<p>and perverted and sadistic, maybe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it fun, I think.</p>
<p>But then again, that&rsquo;s the Russian perspective.</p>
<p>I was just gonna say.</p>
<p>It is the Russian perspective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes the Russian.</p>
<p>So Russian history, one day I&rsquo;ll do some Russian history.</p>
<p>I took it in college.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ant farm, baby.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an ant farm with a very, very frustrated</p>
<p>young teenage alien kid.</p>
<p>Dan, I can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already complimented you way too much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>This has been an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge gift, your gift of humanity.</p>
<p>I hope you.</p>
<p>Oh, let me cut you off and just say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done a wonderful job.</p>
<p>This has been fun for me.</p>
<p>The questions, and more importantly,</p>
<p>the questions can come from anybody.</p>
<p>The counter statements, your responses have been wonderful.</p>
<p>You made this a very fun intellectual discussion for me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well, let me have the last word and say,</p>
<p>I agree with Elon and despite the doom caster say</p>
<p>that I think we&rsquo;ve concluded definitively</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get a chance to respond</p>
<p>that love is in fact the answer and the way forward.</p>
<p>So thanks so much, Dan.</p>
