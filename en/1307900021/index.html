It&amp;rsquo;s Hardcore History.
ATTENTION.
‚ô™‚ô™
So, the conversation that you&amp;rsquo;re about to listen to
was done through a format that I ripped off
from the people that we&amp;rsquo;re talking with,
because I was on their podcast not that long ago,
and I remember thinking that the way
that they put it together structurally
was fantastic for three people,
because when you have three people in a conversation,
it can get unwieldy sometimes.'>

    <p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History.</p>
<p>ATTENTION.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>So, the conversation that you&rsquo;re about to listen to</p>
<p>was done through a format that I ripped off</p>
<p>from the people that we&rsquo;re talking with,</p>
<p>because I was on their podcast not that long ago,</p>
<p>and I remember thinking that the way</p>
<p>that they put it together structurally</p>
<p>was fantastic for three people,</p>
<p>because when you have three people in a conversation,</p>
<p>it can get unwieldy sometimes.</p>
<p>I thought they did a great job.</p>
<p>The show, I thought, went fantastic,</p>
<p>and in fact, I liked it so much</p>
<p>that I thought I&rsquo;d like to do a version of sort of</p>
<p>a part two, if you will, on our own podcast.</p>
<p>So, perhaps it&rsquo;s fair to say part one is available</p>
<p>from the archives of the Rest is History podcast,</p>
<p>and, well, this is part two.</p>
<p>Uh, the guests on the program, the hosts of that podcast,</p>
<p>Dominic Sandbrook and Tom Holland,</p>
<p>both writers, TV presenters, radio hosts.</p>
<p>I mean, they have very varied careers.</p>
<p>And, uh, while Dominic&rsquo;s point of emphasis</p>
<p>is usually more in the 1970s, 1980s,</p>
<p>sometimes Churchill stuff,</p>
<p>Tom Holland rolls around in the mud</p>
<p>that we like to roll around in often,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve used his books for, uh, research materials.</p>
<p>I think we used, uh, Persian Fire</p>
<p>for the Persian shows. We definitely used his book</p>
<p>on the fall of the Roman Republic, Rubicon,</p>
<p>for our Fall of the Roman Republic series.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got a recent work out on the impact of,</p>
<p>I guess you could say, Christian thinking</p>
<p>on Western society called Dominion.</p>
<p>All of it worth your time, and as a podcast,</p>
<p>the Rest is History is absolutely worth your time.</p>
<p>And if you go, if you haven&rsquo;t already,</p>
<p>and delve into their archives, tons of fun stuff on offering.</p>
<p>So, check that out if you like what you&rsquo;re about to hear.</p>
<p>If you like what you&rsquo;re about to hear, remember,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of part two of an ongoing conversation.</p>
<p>Check out part one on their podcast</p>
<p>when you have a chance. And without further ado,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just call this part two.</p>
<p>‚ô™</p>
<p>All right, gentlemen, I&rsquo;m considering this part two</p>
<p>of the earlier discussion that we had on your program.</p>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;m gonna throw some questions out there,</p>
<p>and you feel free to take them in any direction you want.</p>
<p>But since I have two Brits with me,</p>
<p>when my mom was working in London when I was a kid,</p>
<p>I was about five or six years old,</p>
<p>and I was completely enamored with King Arthur at the time.</p>
<p>And yet, even at five or six, I could tell</p>
<p>that there was a bunch of nonsense involved in the story.</p>
<p>But I was under the impression that you could just stop</p>
<p>passers-by on the street in London</p>
<p>and ask them for the true story.</p>
<p>And as you can imagine, I still am unsatisfied</p>
<p>with the answers I got.</p>
<p>So, I thought I would tap into the brain trust here</p>
<p>and ask you guys your opinion,</p>
<p>and it may differ from each other.</p>
<p>Do you think that the King Arthur legend is rooted</p>
<p>in any sort of reality, or is this a fabricated myth</p>
<p>from the get-go?</p>
<p>Tom, do you want to go first?</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve got strong views on this.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think that Arthur, a historical Arthur, existed,</p>
<p>is the kind of blunt and brutal truth.</p>
<p>And it saddens me to say that, because I would always rather</p>
<p>that there was some kind of root of reality</p>
<p>at the base of a myth.</p>
<p>But having said that, I think that the way</p>
<p>that the story has evolved, it&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>different kind of resonances in different periods of time.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, tracing where the story comes from</p>
<p>actually tells you quite a lot about medieval history,</p>
<p>early medieval history, the beginnings of Britain,</p>
<p>the beginnings of England, the forging of medieval culture.</p>
<p>So in that sense, I think Arthur is a really fascinating topic</p>
<p>of historical inquiry.</p>
<p>But I think that kind of burrowing around,</p>
<p>assuming that there is some real Arthur at the base of it,</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s a fantasy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with Tom, Dan.</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t think there was anybody called Arthur,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think any historian or archaeologist</p>
<p>or ethnographer or whatever will ever</p>
<p>uncover a single individual who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at the heart of the legend.</p>
<p>But I completely agree with Tom that the legend itself</p>
<p>is clearly, like all legends, it&rsquo;s rooted in something.</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t invented as a fiction.</p>
<p>So it clearly draws on folk memories, on myths.</p>
<p>It tells you an enormous amount, not so much maybe</p>
<p>about what we now call England in the Dark Ages, I would say,</p>
<p>but the way that later generations thought</p>
<p>of that period and the way they thought of themselves.</p>
<p>And I guess the myth is more interesting than the man now,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I mean, if there were a figure like Arthur,</p>
<p>he must have been a, what would you say, Tom,</p>
<p>a kind of Romano-British warlord or something.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately, how interesting</p>
<p>is that compared with the legend of Arthur</p>
<p>and the way that&rsquo;s accumulated over time, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>What do you think, Dan?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m riffing off what you guys just said,</p>
<p>because if this is a part of Englishness,</p>
<p>if we could call it that, then how do we?</p>
<p>Well, but Dan, actually, that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating about it is that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>about Englishness so much, although it becomes that,</p>
<p>because, of course, the English are the enemies.</p>
<p>Right, I was just going to say, that&rsquo;s exactly where I was</p>
<p>going, if this is a guy fighting the Anglo-Saxons, which</p>
<p>are a key component of the blending that will eventually</p>
<p>happen, how is this guy anything other</p>
<p>than some sort of Romano-Celtic hero or something like that?</p>
<p>In other words, how did he get wrapped up</p>
<p>into English history when, like you said,</p>
<p>here he is fighting the Saxon invaders who</p>
<p>are going to fuse with the various kingdoms</p>
<p>to create what we think of as England, correct?</p>
<p>Well, there are all these traditions</p>
<p>that are floating around, but the guy who really compiles</p>
<p>them is a bloke called Geoffrey of Monmouth, who is writing</p>
<p>as a Welshman, essentially.</p>
<p>And his book is, Arthur is a key figure, but not the only one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a story about how Britain</p>
<p>is founded by Brutus, who is a refugee Trojan who</p>
<p>comes to Britain and fights various giants.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very much the level at which this is operating.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that that&rsquo;s not historical,</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m getting from you.</p>
<p>OK, just double-checking.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, alas.</p>
<p>England is still a nation of giants, Dan.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve heard from every Englishman, yes.</p>
<p>Geoffrey is basically casting the English, the Sassanachs,</p>
<p>the Saxons, as the enemy.</p>
<p>But of course, by this point, you</p>
<p>have Norman kings of England, descended</p>
<p>from William the Conqueror.</p>
<p>And they end up conquering Wales, so the kings of England.</p>
<p>And so those Welsh traditions get absorbed into the,</p>
<p>they become the matter of Britain.</p>
<p>And the kings of England see themselves</p>
<p>as the rulers of the whole of Britain.</p>
<p>So just as they absorb the mountains and the valleys</p>
<p>of Wales into their kingdom, so also</p>
<p>do they end up absorbing these traditions about King Arthur.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you have Edward I, who</p>
<p>is the king who conquers Wales.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s obsessed by Arthur.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s the guy who goes to Glastonbury and claims</p>
<p>the family&rsquo;s tomb.</p>
<p>And digs up the tomb that supposedly has the, yeah.</p>
<p>And the monks were maybe involved</p>
<p>in that for a little bit of, you know, Glastonbury publicity</p>
<p>and whatnot.</p>
<p>And then, of course, it works.</p>
<p>There are further twists on that,</p>
<p>because at the beginning of the 15th century,</p>
<p>sorry, the 16th century, I guess,</p>
<p>when you have the advent of the Tudors.</p>
<p>So obviously, Henry Tudor landing in 1485,</p>
<p>beating Richard III of the Battle of Bosworth.</p>
<p>The idea of the Tudors as the heirs to Arthur</p>
<p>is really important to them.</p>
<p>So Henry VII&rsquo;s son, who famously, you know,</p>
<p>dies at Ludlow Castle, paving the way for Henry VIII</p>
<p>to become king, he&rsquo;s called Arthur.</p>
<p>Henry VIII loves the story of King Arthur.</p>
<p>I mean, am I not right in thinking, Tom,</p>
<p>that Henry VIII repairs the great painting</p>
<p>of the round table and has it done</p>
<p>for the visit of the emperor?</p>
<p>For the visit of the king?</p>
<p>Yes, he does.</p>
<p>Yeah, and one of the things that&rsquo;s also fact,</p>
<p>so as Dominic says, it has political capital.</p>
<p>Because in a way, Arthur is a very, very famous</p>
<p>British export, English export, at a time</p>
<p>when England is really quite a peripheral kingdom</p>
<p>to the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Arthur is a name that matters.</p>
<p>The matter of Britain is something</p>
<p>that resonates through all the courts of Europe.</p>
<p>So the upstart Tudors, by laying claim to that,</p>
<p>are, you know, they&rsquo;re aggrandizing</p>
<p>their own dynasty, and they&rsquo;re aggrandizing their kingdom.</p>
<p>But I think also the way that Henry VIII repairs</p>
<p>this supposed round table that&rsquo;s hanging in Winchester</p>
<p>shows the way in which it&rsquo;s not just us who are romanticizing</p>
<p>these stories.</p>
<p>People were doing it in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>And so my favorite example of that</p>
<p>is Tintagel, this incredibly romantic castle in Cornwall.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of one of the jewels in the Cornish tourist</p>
<p>industry.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a jewel because it looks exactly what you would</p>
<p>imagine King Arthur&rsquo;s birthplace would look like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on a kind of rocky island.</p>
<p>The waves are crashing into the rocks.</p>
<p>There are kind of beautiful bridges that span it.</p>
<p>It looks like something from a medieval romance.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it was designed to look like.</p>
<p>It was built by the brother of Henry III, who</p>
<p>is Edward I&rsquo;s son, Richard, Duke of Cornwall.</p>
<p>And he builds it to look like King Arthur&rsquo;s castle.</p>
<p>So even then, they&rsquo;re kind of constructing and fashioning</p>
<p>the myth.</p>
<p>And now, of course, when tourists go to Tintagel,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re buying into a medieval idea of what</p>
<p>a medieval castle looked like.</p>
<p>So there are just kind of reflection</p>
<p>after reflection after reflection,</p>
<p>all these kind of mirrors held up to each other,</p>
<p>which is what makes it such a brilliant, brilliant story.</p>
<p>And I think one other element, obviously, is that in 1707,</p>
<p>England and Scotland officially become Great Britain,</p>
<p>the Kingdom of Great Britain.</p>
<p>And at that point, I think Arthur does become,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s both a British hero and an English one</p>
<p>because England and Britain, certainly</p>
<p>in the minds of the English, become</p>
<p>equated with each other.</p>
<p>So one of the most famous books ever</p>
<p>written about British history, or indeed English history,</p>
<p>which most of your listeners, I&rsquo;m guessing,</p>
<p>will seem like gibberish to them,</p>
<p>is the book called 1066 and All That, a comic book</p>
<p>by Sellers and Yeatman at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
<p>One of the jokes in that book, so it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>a parody of the history that kids were taught in, I guess,</p>
<p>would you say Edwardian schools, Tom, early 20th century</p>
<p>schools, one of the jokes in it is that Alfred,</p>
<p>the book constantly mixes up King Arthur and Alfred</p>
<p>the Great.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s what even now, lots of people</p>
<p>kind of mix the two of them up, don&rsquo;t they, Tom?</p>
<p>They have a sort of sense that they fought invaders,</p>
<p>they did stuff with candles and timekeeping,</p>
<p>they were good Christian kings, all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, I think actually, I mean, I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s intriguing that they make that joke because I think</p>
<p>actually one of the models for Geoffrey Monmouth&rsquo;s portrayal</p>
<p>of Arthur is Alfred&rsquo;s grandson, Athelstan,</p>
<p>who is the English king who essentially creates</p>
<p>the kingdom of England.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the first really to make the princes of Wales</p>
<p>pay the English crown tribute.</p>
<p>And his history of Britain ends with the coming</p>
<p>to power of Athelstan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as though this is where British history stops</p>
<p>because the English have completely taken over.</p>
<p>And actually, the portrayal of Arthur</p>
<p>in Geoffrey Monmouth&rsquo;s history has lots</p>
<p>of echoes of Athelstan.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like Geoffrey is trying</p>
<p>to supply a British mirror image of Athelstan.</p>
<p>So the short answer to your question, Dan, is&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s funny because I remember</p>
<p>buying books in London as a kid, Arthur&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>In Search of Arthur&rsquo;s Britain, all these kind of things</p>
<p>where it seemed as though the British themselves were trying</p>
<p>to get a handle on what this was.</p>
<p>And I remember that the book was very unsatisfying</p>
<p>because instead of giving me a yes or no answer,</p>
<p>it sort of just took you through the post</p>
<p>Romano-British, you know, myths and countryside and all that.</p>
<p>But you folks mentioned the Normans a minute ago.</p>
<p>So let me bring you into something that I said recently</p>
<p>and let me get your opinion on it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated with the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>nowadays, if you try to fight a modern army against an army</p>
<p>from 30 years ago, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>But for most of human history, with technology moving</p>
<p>either as slowly as it did or with these sort of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it ebbs and flows of capabilities, right?</p>
<p>So someone from an earlier era could have a military</p>
<p>that was more capable from someone perhaps</p>
<p>in a later era, which is, of course, anathema now.</p>
<p>I had said that I thought that Julius Caesar&rsquo;s Romans would</p>
<p>have defeated William the Conqueror&rsquo;s Normans.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s, you know, centuries and centuries</p>
<p>and centuries between the two.</p>
<p>Took some flack for that.</p>
<p>Do you folks have an opinion on that?</p>
<p>I have an opinion on that.</p>
<p>I would say Julius Caesar would undoubtedly have beaten</p>
<p>the Normans, undoubtedly.</p>
<p>So the Normans, I guess they&rsquo;re a big innovation.</p>
<p>Tom knows more about this than I do.</p>
<p>So once I&rsquo;ve spoken, Tom will tell me where I&rsquo;ve gone wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re absolutely bang on the money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a big innovation as knights, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Mounted cavalry, basically, sort of armored cavalry,</p>
<p>I guess you would say.</p>
<p>Yeah, and lances, the ability to use lances.</p>
<p>Big spears, Alexander the Great had big spears, Tom,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve discussed on our own podcast many times.</p>
<p>So I would say that the Romans would have won</p>
<p>because they had infinitely superior logistics.</p>
<p>They gave much more thought to military strategy.</p>
<p>They had a more resilient political structure behind them.</p>
<p>You know, they had these incredibly well-trained,</p>
<p>well-disciplined professional troops.</p>
<p>And what are the Normans?</p>
<p>I mean, the Normans are, if you were being harsh</p>
<p>about the Normans, you would say they&rsquo;re a war band.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re just slightly superior Vikings.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t they, Tom?</p>
<p>Frank, you know, French-flied Vikings.</p>
<p>I think that Norman cavalry is incredibly proficient.</p>
<p>And as a kind of, you know, a Norman boy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trained to the saddle and you are raised</p>
<p>to handle a lance from the saddle</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very difficult thing to do, apparently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried it, but it doesn&rsquo;t come easily.</p>
<p>So they are very, very formidable cavalry.</p>
<p>But I agree with Dominic and I completely agree with you, Dan.</p>
<p>I think Caesar&rsquo;s legions would have wiped the floor</p>
<p>with the Normans because they were</p>
<p>the most lethal fighting force that the world</p>
<p>up to that point had seen.</p>
<p>And in due course, they would become even more lethal</p>
<p>because they would become these kind of professional armies.</p>
<p>And I think that really the only way to defeat</p>
<p>that class of infantry was the way that the Parthians did</p>
<p>against Crassus&rsquo; army in the desert,</p>
<p>which is to have kind of vast, open, blank expanse of land</p>
<p>and have very, very mobile horse archers.</p>
<p>But I think otherwise, the Romans are always going</p>
<p>to defeat the Normans, not least because of course,</p>
<p>infantry against cavalry, that&rsquo;s what you get at Hastings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of, you know,</p>
<p>the elephant against the whale kind of situation.</p>
<p>But Caesar had great cavalry.</p>
<p>I mean, Caesar recruited Gallic cavalry,</p>
<p>he recruited archers, he had all kinds of auxiliaries</p>
<p>who would have been part of the mix as well.</p>
<p>And as a Roman commander, he would have been</p>
<p>perfectly happy to sacrifice them.</p>
<p>Whereas the Romans probably&hellip;</p>
<p>Tom, don&rsquo;t the Romans have much larger numbers anyway?</p>
<p>Because of the logistics, they can support greater numbers.</p>
<p>Their military machine is far greater.</p>
<p>And also you mentioned Hastings.</p>
<p>I mean, the Normans, they don&rsquo;t wind up with the Saxons.</p>
<p>Yeah, they almost lose at Hastings.</p>
<p>And the Saxon, I mean, the Anglo-Saxon heavy infantry</p>
<p>was reputedly the best in Europe,</p>
<p>which is why after Hastings,</p>
<p>so many of them go to Constantinople</p>
<p>and serve as the bodyguards of the emperor.</p>
<p>Yeah, but even so, I mean,</p>
<p>the Anglo-Saxon military cannot compare</p>
<p>for professionalism or training or discipline to the Romans.</p>
<p>Well, and that army had just come from fighting</p>
<p>in the north too.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even the best example of an Anglo-Saxon army,</p>
<p>was it?</p>
<p>Right, so I think if&hellip;</p>
<p>I think if it, you know, it&rsquo;s a close run thing at Hastings</p>
<p>against Harold&rsquo;s army,</p>
<p>I think they would have been annihilated</p>
<p>by Caesar&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>And that is centuries and centuries beforehand.</p>
<p>So what do you think accounts for that?</p>
<p>And what makes it so,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m fascinated with the fact</p>
<p>that the dynamic is so different today</p>
<p>than it was throughout military history, right?</p>
<p>Where armies from centuries previously could have,</p>
<p>I mean, Alexander&rsquo;s army would have given,</p>
<p>I would say, many of the later armies ago.</p>
<p>There was a book by Arthur Farrell.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve forgotten the title at hand,</p>
<p>but at the very end of it, he had talked about,</p>
<p>he tried to imagine Napoleon trying to fight Alexander.</p>
<p>And he said, if you could discount the effect</p>
<p>of firearms on a morale level,</p>
<p>that that even might be a near run thing.</p>
<p>What do you folks think about taking it</p>
<p>that far into the recent past?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s technology, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s technology that makes the difference.</p>
<p>So, I mean, essentially the,</p>
<p>so the evolution, you know, the discovery of iron,</p>
<p>say, as opposed to bronze,</p>
<p>an Iron Age army is going to defeat a Bronze Age army.</p>
<p>Because of the difference in the metals?</p>
<p>Yes, because the effect of an iron sword</p>
<p>is going to be lethal on a bronze sword, for instance.</p>
<p>And likewise, the development, say, of the stirrup</p>
<p>facilitates a quality of cavalry</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t have before that.</p>
<p>And obviously the development of gunpowder</p>
<p>completely changes the equation.</p>
<p>But if you are measuring, say, a Roman legion</p>
<p>against any kind of army that is pre-gunpowder,</p>
<p>say, from the first or second centuries AD,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re at their most professional,</p>
<p>I think that they are likely to win</p>
<p>simply because they have the mass infrastructure</p>
<p>of this vast empire behind them.</p>
<p>And that empire essentially,</p>
<p>that empire is conquered by the legions,</p>
<p>but it comes to exist purely to keep the legions going.</p>
<p>So you could describe the Roman Empire</p>
<p>almost as a series of military bases,</p>
<p>you know, with a tax base attached.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially how the Roman Empire functions.</p>
<p>And when you have that amount of money,</p>
<p>that amount of professionalism,</p>
<p>basically anyone that you meet is likely to be defeated.</p>
<p>And even when the Roman armies do lose,</p>
<p>they do get defeated, they always come back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute premise of Roman military doctrine</p>
<p>that the Romans never lose.</p>
<p>So even if the Germans wipe out some armies</p>
<p>or the Judeans wipe out some armies,</p>
<p>the Romans will come back</p>
<p>and they will inflict devastating punishment.</p>
<p>And nobody basically can withstand them.</p>
<p>And that includes the Parthians.</p>
<p>You know, apart from Carrie,</p>
<p>basically the Romans know that they always</p>
<p>have the beating of the Parthians.</p>
<p>So Tom, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t one make the case though,</p>
<p>that Carrie, it was bad generalship too.</p>
<p>I mean, there was some, yeah.</p>
<p>You could, yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to interrupt you, Dominic.</p>
<p>No, no, go ahead.</p>
<p>I was going to say that what Tom was saying,</p>
<p>I completely agree with Tom&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>And I think military success is often a question</p>
<p>of technology and political organization.</p>
<p>And I think we tend to,</p>
<p>because we emphasize so often generals and battles,</p>
<p>we lose sight of the fact that,</p>
<p>I mean, Tom said infrastructure.</p>
<p>And I think infrastructure is absolutely key.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a brilliant book about the Second World War</p>
<p>by a guy, an American who&rsquo;s based in Britain</p>
<p>called Philip, he&rsquo;s called Phillips Payson O&rsquo;Brien.</p>
<p>And he basically argued that in the Second World War,</p>
<p>all the battles are completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>And if you tell the story, talking about the battles,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing, you know, why the allies won,</p>
<p>which is all about logistics and infrastructure.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, anybody,</p>
<p>tons of your listeners, I imagine,</p>
<p>will have played computer strategy games,</p>
<p>where, you know, you know that if you&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>if the spreadsheet is working</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got all your resources</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got your logistics all sorted out,</p>
<p>then in a way it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if you lose a couple of battles</p>
<p>because you can, you know, you can recover from that.</p>
<p>And I think actually the Roman political organization,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, was so robust, so resilient,</p>
<p>so effective, so efficient,</p>
<p>that it was just infinitely better, wasn&rsquo;t it, Tom,</p>
<p>than the organization of Western European medieval kingdoms.</p>
<p>Much more sophisticated, much more reliable tax base,</p>
<p>you know, sort of, it&rsquo;s seasoned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s professionalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pure professionalism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not some bloke who&rsquo;s a nobleman</p>
<p>who spends his time kind of, you know,</p>
<p>molesting the daughters of the local peasants.</p>
<p>And then once every now and again,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s called on to fight the French or the English</p>
<p>or whoever it might be.</p>
<p>Of course, he spent all his time in the saddle and all that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the same as somebody who spent his life</p>
<p>in Roman military bases, as Tom says,</p>
<p>you know, trudging up and down the roads,</p>
<p>practicing, training, being drilled.</p>
<p>You know, I think there&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>And being forged, yeah, and it&rsquo;s the drill as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the drill, for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the being forged into a single unit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why really, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only when states in Europe are able</p>
<p>to raise sufficient taxes again to keep professional armies</p>
<p>and therefore to have them drilled</p>
<p>and to operate as entities</p>
<p>that you start to get anything approximating</p>
<p>to the professionalism.</p>
<p>Exactly, and that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t get that drill</p>
<p>and all that stuff without the political organization.</p>
<p>And so what I would say, I&rsquo;m sure Tom would agree,</p>
<p>is that the Roman Empire at its height</p>
<p>or the Roman system at its height</p>
<p>represents a kind of apogee of organization</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a long period of fragmentation.</p>
<p>And then I guess, what would you say, Tom,</p>
<p>the early modern period?</p>
<p>You get organized, European states organizing,</p>
<p>raising taxes at a level comparable to that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why Napoleon, for example,</p>
<p>who was able to draw on the power of nationalism</p>
<p>in a way that people hadn&rsquo;t really done</p>
<p>so powerfully before that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why Napoleon undoubtedly would have given the Romans</p>
<p>a very good run for their money</p>
<p>in a way that I don&rsquo;t think, you know,</p>
<p>Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s army, as much as excited</p>
<p>as they would have been about reading their Bibles.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t think they would have.</p>
<p>But I think also, talking about Napoleon</p>
<p>and also thinking about the armies</p>
<p>in the American Civil War,</p>
<p>the idea of citizen armies,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also a crucial part of the way</p>
<p>that legions are organized.</p>
<p>So a legio, a legion, was literally a levy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Roman people in arms.</p>
<p>And in time, as, you know, the empire gets larger and larger</p>
<p>and you need more and more legiones,</p>
<p>more and more legions,</p>
<p>that sense slightly starts to diminish.</p>
<p>But say in the first century AD,</p>
<p>the Roman Republic has collapsed.</p>
<p>But if you want a microcosm of Rome</p>
<p>as it was in the Republic,</p>
<p>this idea of a kind of a body of men</p>
<p>who are, their strength lies in their coherence,</p>
<p>in their discipline, in their sense of comradeship.</p>
<p>You would go to a legionary base to find that.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t go to Rome.</p>
<p>And that sense of a kind of a martial civic identity</p>
<p>is what the French Revolutionary Army, Napoleonic armies,</p>
<p>the armies in the American Civil War,</p>
<p>and then the citizen armies in the First World War.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a crucial part of what makes them so lethal.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting because you would think,</p>
<p>you would think that if the Romans were beating you</p>
<p>all the time,</p>
<p>that you would simply try to copy what they did, right?</p>
<p>We all know that phalanxes spread across the ancient world</p>
<p>once that became a popular way of war.</p>
<p>And we know that there were things</p>
<p>like imitation legionaries that were created</p>
<p>once the Romans started to show</p>
<p>that the Roman way of war was so dominant,</p>
<p>but it never quite lived up to the original.</p>
<p>And it reminded me of, for example,</p>
<p>the early history of modern battleships</p>
<p>where certain countries could produce battleships</p>
<p>and other countries would buy battleships</p>
<p>from countries who could make them</p>
<p>because this was going to be the equivalent</p>
<p>of their Roman legionaries.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t have battleships, you couldn&rsquo;t compete.</p>
<p>And yet the states that couldn&rsquo;t build their own</p>
<p>never quite seemed to rise to the level</p>
<p>of the states that could.</p>
<p>Why do you think that certain kinds</p>
<p>of military technologies are transferable</p>
<p>and other kinds of military technologies aren&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Is it because they&rsquo;re wedded to the society or the system?</p>
<p>Or, I mean, somebody like Victor Davis Hanson</p>
<p>back in the day would have said it&rsquo;s a cultural question,</p>
<p>you know, the Western way of war and all this.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on why certain kinds</p>
<p>of military technology aren&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I mean, barbed wire is transferable.</p>
<p>Roman legionaries seems to not be.</p>
<p>Steppe cavalry, you know, Mongol, Hun,</p>
<p>Scythian cavalry not really transferable.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on that?</p>
<p>Well, surely the answer to that is that barbed wire</p>
<p>is transferable because barbed wire is just a very simple,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s just a very simple thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a device.</p>
<p>Whereas a Roman legionary is a political</p>
<p>and cultural construct.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t just, it&rsquo;s a bit like,</p>
<p>I would say trying to copy a Roman legionary</p>
<p>or indeed a kind of, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>an early 20th century dreadnought or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like thinking you can transplant it</p>
<p>from one society to another is like thinking</p>
<p>you can just pitch up in any given part of the world</p>
<p>and implant the, you know, Western style democracy</p>
<p>or something because these things are not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not sort of, I would say,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not accessories that you pick up</p>
<p>at the shopping mall.</p>
<p>They are an expression, a reflection</p>
<p>of a political and cultural sort of landscape.</p>
<p>So in that sense, I would completely agree with Victor</p>
<p>David, what&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>Victor Davis Hanson.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would completely agree with that.</p>
<p>I think there was a Western way of war.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obviously rooted in Western, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say by the 20th century,</p>
<p>Western democratic industrial civilization.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just transplant something as complicated</p>
<p>as a battleship or indeed a legionary</p>
<p>from one setting to another.</p>
<p>Whereas barbed wire, which is relatively simple,</p>
<p>you can.</p>
<p>What do you think, Tom?</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re a technologically advanced</p>
<p>civilization, then you&rsquo;re going to have more lethal weaponry.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s always the way.</p>
<p>I mean, you talked about computer games.</p>
<p>If you play something like Civilization,</p>
<p>where you start off with a band of hunter-gatherers</p>
<p>and then you end up flying to Alpha Centauri,</p>
<p>that, you know, you know that going</p>
<p>to war with a phalanx against a squadron of tanks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re absolutely going to be flattened.</p>
<p>And I think that we can see that actually playing out</p>
<p>in front of our eyes at the moment in Ukraine,</p>
<p>where the Russian armed forces had the kit.</p>
<p>But because a lot of that kit derived from Western sources,</p>
<p>now that they are subject to sanctions,</p>
<p>their ability to source that kit is diminishing.</p>
<p>And the more it diminishes, so they</p>
<p>have to kind of start shopping around in Tehran or wherever</p>
<p>to try and find the drones or whatever that they need.</p>
<p>And you realize the degree to which military proficiency</p>
<p>is a reflection of industrial proficiency,</p>
<p>technological proficiency.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the West has always</p>
<p>been ahead of the game for so long,</p>
<p>is that since the Industrial Revolution, at least,</p>
<p>maybe before that, it&rsquo;s always been at the cutting edge.</p>
<p>And perhaps one of the unsettling things,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the West at the moment,</p>
<p>is the notion that perhaps that age is fading, not with Russia,</p>
<p>but with China.</p>
<p>OK, you guys bring up now the first tangent of the program</p>
<p>here, because you bring up something</p>
<p>that I find fascinating.</p>
<p>I remember as a kid, we were wargaming,</p>
<p>and we would talk about the 1973 conflicts in the Middle East</p>
<p>and this idea at the time, and you folks have certainly</p>
<p>studied this, that the handheld weapons of infantry</p>
<p>were going to make tanks obsolete,</p>
<p>and that you could already see that being foreshadowed</p>
<p>in the 73 war.</p>
<p>Well, of course, tanks sort of made a comeback,</p>
<p>and the long struggle between offense and defense</p>
<p>that you can see going back to armor</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things in the Middle Ages came into play,</p>
<p>and tanks sort of got a second lease on life.</p>
<p>If you guys had to guess, are we seeing the predictions of 73</p>
<p>finally coming true now with Ukraine and drones</p>
<p>and better handheld weapons that are anti-tank weapons,</p>
<p>or is this going to be another case of a premature writing off</p>
<p>of armor?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of stuff on debate, actually,</p>
<p>on social media about this, Dan.</p>
<p>The arguments that I think there were a lot of people</p>
<p>who were overpraising the Russians</p>
<p>before the war started, who were great enthusiasts for tanks</p>
<p>and said, oh, the Russians, you know,</p>
<p>their brute force is unparalleled</p>
<p>and all this sort of thing.</p>
<p>And then there was all this sort of amateur footage</p>
<p>of Ukrainians with kind of, you know,</p>
<p>sort of stuff they&rsquo;d built in their kitchen,</p>
<p>taking out a tank or whatever.</p>
<p>Hauling them off with tractors.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, the death of the tank has been predicted many times,</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t it, since the invention of the tank?</p>
<p>In fact, there were tank skeptics</p>
<p>even when the tank was invented.</p>
<p>I would guess that tanks, I mean,</p>
<p>it feels to me such a 20th century weapon of warfare.</p>
<p>And I would guess that in a world of drones</p>
<p>and van-held, you know, anti-tank sort of launchers</p>
<p>or whatever, I would guess that in 2050,</p>
<p>will tanks play such a part as they do now?</p>
<p>I would think not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t envy defence secretaries</p>
<p>at the moment having to decide how they slice and dice</p>
<p>their defence budgets, kind of knowing that a wrong punt</p>
<p>and you might be stuck with completely obsolete equipment.</p>
<p>Well, that brings up-</p>
<p>But if you were the Pentagon, Tom,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t invest in tanks,</p>
<p>would you, if you were the-</p>
<p>Yeah, but if I&rsquo;m the Pentagon, I can afford to, you know,</p>
<p>waste a lot of money.</p>
<p>Right, you can hedge your bets.</p>
<p>We have plenty of tanks, yeah.</p>
<p>But that then brings the question</p>
<p>from the land warfare element to the naval warfare element.</p>
<p>Could one say the same about surface vessels?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about big, slow, large targets.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p>
<p>Well, I guess we&rsquo;ll have to wait for the Chinese to invent-</p>
<p>I know, the Straits of Taiwan looms, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>To find that out.</p>
<p>Yeah, and actually, we in Britain are the worst people to ask</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re, of course, completely-</p>
<p>because we still have very strongly</p>
<p>the romance of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>So in the 1980s, which is really my period,</p>
<p>Britain was very close to basically scrapping</p>
<p>most of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>And then the Falklands War happened</p>
<p>and we ended up keeping far more of it than we&rsquo;d planned to.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re sort of slightly-</p>
<p>I mean, if people from the Royal Navy listen to this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be appalled to hear this.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re kind of stuck with it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a bit of an albatross</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re very unlikely to use it in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got two huge aircraft carriers</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think we can actually afford to send to sea</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t have the necessary flotilla</p>
<p>that would guard these aircraft carriers</p>
<p>from being attacked by underwater missiles or whatever.</p>
<p>However, however, we have two aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>The French have one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that we shouldn&rsquo;t be overtaken</p>
<p>by the French.</p>
<p>Essentially, that is justification enough.</p>
<p>Well, but you guys bring up now an interesting point.</p>
<p>And I think it applies to the tank question too.</p>
<p>So if I say to American military people</p>
<p>that the tanks are obsolete and you can see</p>
<p>that this lesson&rsquo;s being taught in Ukraine, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>and one can make the same thing maybe about surface vessels</p>
<p>on the high seas,</p>
<p>they will counter with the line that this is a system,</p>
<p>not a weapon, and that the system requires things</p>
<p>like infantry that would fan out, you know,</p>
<p>on either side of the armored columns</p>
<p>to prevent people from being able to get close enough</p>
<p>to use handheld weapons.</p>
<p>They would say that in order to prevent, for example,</p>
<p>your aircraft carriers being destroyed by, you know,</p>
<p>surface-to-surface anti-ship missiles,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an entire system involved.</p>
<p>You have, you know, picket ships and everything else.</p>
<p>Could one make the case that some of this</p>
<p>is poor handling of the entire system</p>
<p>rather than criticism of an individual weapon?</p>
<p>Well, Dan, I don&rsquo;t in any way want to imply</p>
<p>that I am in any way a military expert.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re treating you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re going to be&hellip;</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re advertising you as that.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the United States,</p>
<p>it does seem that there is a problem,</p>
<p>which is that essentially the U.S.</p>
<p>is preparing for two kinds of war.</p>
<p>The first is the kind of war that they&rsquo;ve been fighting over</p>
<p>the past 30 years.</p>
<p>So the 9-11 wars in Afghanistan, in Iraq, whatever,</p>
<p>where all kinds of the amazing kit that you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>is essentially useless</p>
<p>because the people that you&rsquo;re fighting, the enemy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all so asymmetrical</p>
<p>that in a way you have to invest all your money</p>
<p>in intelligence and counterinsurgency</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose it&rsquo;s a lesson in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The other is, of course,</p>
<p>that the U.S. is preparing for a superpower conflict,</p>
<p>first with the Soviet Union and now, I suppose, with China.</p>
<p>And again, the prospect of that is so horrendous</p>
<p>that the exchange of a few nuclear missiles</p>
<p>would, again, render all the tanks</p>
<p>and the aircraft carriers and so on useless.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the U.S. is the number one superpower</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a number one superpower</p>
<p>because it has the most proficient military.</p>
<p>So in a way, it&rsquo;s a kind of badge of superpower status.</p>
<p>But it seems to me a badge that you can never really use.</p>
<p>I mean, you can never bring to bear</p>
<p>with the full intensity, perhaps,</p>
<p>that in a kind of a dream campaign you would</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re never going to be fighting</p>
<p>those kind of campaigns.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see vast tank armies</p>
<p>clashing in the plains of China, Tom?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t. Do you?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s very implausible.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>When are they going to use all these tanks?</p>
<p>And there was a kind of brief upsurge of dread, I suppose,</p>
<p>that maybe this is what we faced in Europe,</p>
<p>that Russian tanks would drive across the Ukrainian plain</p>
<p>and then perhaps into Poland or, you know,</p>
<p>and who knows where they might stop.</p>
<p>But I think that that prospect now is looking</p>
<p>fairly improbable as well.</p>
<p>Well, which brings us to one of the reasons</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s fairly improbable.</p>
<p>And I would say nuclear weapons come into play.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been having discussions with people about this lately.</p>
<p>And I find it appalling the willingness.</p>
<p>You know, when we were all, we&rsquo;re all from a generation</p>
<p>where thinking about nuclear weapons</p>
<p>was something that was on our mind immensely more often</p>
<p>and more deeply than it&rsquo;s on anyone&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Well, maybe maybe it&rsquo;s changed in the past year.</p>
<p>But but two years ago, three years ago,</p>
<p>I would find an appalling lack of let&rsquo;s call it respect,</p>
<p>maybe, for what these weapons can do if.</p>
<p>And I had written this down to potentially talk about.</p>
<p>But if we could imagine what a nuclear bomb or missile</p>
<p>being used today, filmed with iPhones,</p>
<p>you know, from on the ground in full living color with sound,</p>
<p>what this really meant.</p>
<p>I feel like it might be the kind of thing</p>
<p>where you would you would you would fully understand.</p>
<p>I mean, I mean, let&rsquo;s put it this had we never used nuclear</p>
<p>weapons in the Second World War, atomic bomb doesn&rsquo;t get dropped</p>
<p>on Hiroshima and we have nuclear weapons,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve never seen what they had done.</p>
<p>I would imagine it would be much more likely</p>
<p>that they would be used.</p>
<p>Had nuclear weapons been used after the Second World War?</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s just say 20 years afterwards.</p>
<p>Do you think that would be something that would prevent</p>
<p>or or or inhibit their use more?</p>
<p>This is a weird way to phrase this question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out maybe the value of having an object</p>
<p>lesson versus the theoretical idea of, oh, we</p>
<p>have these terrible weapons and they&rsquo;ll do terrible things.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t even imagine what that might mean.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful and I&rsquo;m sure you guys have seen something</p>
<p>like this. There&rsquo;s a wonderful thing online where you can see</p>
<p>how far the blast radius of a big nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Paris or something that they use.</p>
<p>Or maybe you could you could choose the city and you can see</p>
<p>exactly how far the damage is.</p>
<p>Do you think when we&rsquo;re talking about unimaginable weapons like</p>
<p>this, that they almost lose their ability to deter because</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t even imagine what we&rsquo;re talking about here?</p>
<p>So, Dan, are you basically implying that Hiroshima and</p>
<p>Nagasaki are too far distant to serve as object lessons?</p>
<p>Now, I here&rsquo;s what I would suggest.</p>
<p>I would suggest that if you look and I know you guys probably</p>
<p>done this, too, if you look at the example, there are so few.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, as a former television news reporter, they</p>
<p>used to teach you the value of pictures and sound and stuff</p>
<p>like that to have black and white photos or the tiny little</p>
<p>things that we have.</p>
<p>Imagine the imagine if we had iPhones at Hiroshima and</p>
<p>Nagasaki and the different levels of intensity that</p>
<p>something like that would have on our collective psyche</p>
<p>versus. And also, let&rsquo;s be honest, if you&rsquo;re a Second</p>
<p>World War, what&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m looking for?</p>
<p>Aficionado. It sounds so strange to say you&rsquo;re a Second</p>
<p>World War buff or something.</p>
<p>But I mean, there is so much violence and so much disaster</p>
<p>from the strategic bombing campaigns and everything else</p>
<p>that it all sort of blends together.</p>
<p>But had there been a nuclear weapon used in 1958, for</p>
<p>example, with color photos and I feel like the object I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a generation has to almost learn these</p>
<p>things over and over or we forget them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s a question there, gentlemen, but</p>
<p>maybe pick up from where I left off.</p>
<p>I think there are actually two different issues there.</p>
<p>So one is our fear of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>But the other one, which I don&rsquo;t think is the question</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re asking, but I think is just as interesting, actually,</p>
<p>is about the way in which as a society, we regard moving color</p>
<p>images as so close to us.</p>
<p>So we say, look at the Beatles in the Peter Jackson</p>
<p>documentary. They look just like us.</p>
<p>Yes, they do.</p>
<p>You know, and then we look at people from the Second World</p>
<p>War and we say, you know, they look ridiculous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re wearing old fashioned clothes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re moving jerkily in the back, black and white footage</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And I do think you&rsquo;re absolutely right that black and white</p>
<p>footage and black and white still pictures act as a kind of</p>
<p>barrier to our empathy, maybe because we just think old people</p>
<p>from history.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t kind of count in the same way that people do now.</p>
<p>Having said that, to return to your real point, I think in a</p>
<p>way your question is too kind to human nature because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically saying if we had incredibly picture perfect</p>
<p>imagery of, you know, the effects of a nuclear bomb, we</p>
<p>would learn, we would be chastened, we&rsquo;d be horrified and</p>
<p>we would, you know, mend our ways in some way.</p>
<p>But, you know, we had we had color imagery of the effects of</p>
<p>bombing in Vietnam, let&rsquo;s say, or so many wars since then, so</p>
<p>many atrocities and human beings haven&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>People have carried on fighting wars and disgracing themselves</p>
<p>in various ways.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t actually think even if it was in color, even if it</p>
<p>was so vivid and palpable, I don&rsquo;t think we would change.</p>
<p>I, I mean, I think that, say, I don&rsquo;t know, America and China</p>
<p>and Russia each had 10 nuclear missiles.</p>
<p>The only thing is that they would use them because it</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t mean the end of of them as countries and it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean the end of human civilization.</p>
<p>The reason that that we were all terrified of nuclear war and we</p>
<p>lived in its shadow was that it wasn&rsquo;t because we&rsquo;d seen that</p>
<p>the horror inflicted on Hiroshima.</p>
<p>I mean, just as much horror was inflicted on Dresden or Hamburg</p>
<p>or Tokyo or whatever.</p>
<p>It was the knowledge that human civilization would be destroyed</p>
<p>and perhaps life on Earth would be destroyed.</p>
<p>And that that hard core of scientific knowledge was then</p>
<p>played upon by filmmakers and science fiction writers in ways</p>
<p>that, because it was rooted in reality, certainly gave me</p>
<p>nightmares and I think gave gave an entire generation</p>
<p>nightmares.</p>
<p>So you had the day after in the United States, we had a we had</p>
<p>a series in Britain called Threads and the impact of this</p>
<p>was terrifying.</p>
<p>And I remember a science film of exactly the kind that you were</p>
<p>describing that that was themed around what would happen if a</p>
<p>nuclear bomb went off over St.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And I must have been about 10 when this went out.</p>
<p>And I still remember that they wanted to show what the impact</p>
<p>of flying glass would be.</p>
<p>And they put a pumpkin on a stick and then smashed the sent</p>
<p>the flying glass and the pumpkin was completely lacerated.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t sleep after that for for weeks and weeks and weeks.</p>
<p>And then at the end of Threads, the which tells a story of a</p>
<p>nuclear war that destroys Britain.</p>
<p>It showed the heroine, the woman who we&rsquo;d been following.</p>
<p>She gets raped and she gives birth to a child.</p>
<p>And the last still is her looking down to see what she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>born and she&rsquo;s screaming with horror.</p>
<p>And that was the thing that the film ended on.</p>
<p>But absolutely stays with me.</p>
<p>And it means that the very notion of nuclear war is a</p>
<p>shadow that hangs over me to this day.</p>
<p>I think that the interesting contrast is, say, with global</p>
<p>warming or climate change, which is often described as the</p>
<p>equivalent challenge facing people, the generations</p>
<p>younger than ours.</p>
<p>The problem with that is, firstly, that the science is</p>
<p>less absolutely grounded.</p>
<p>And secondly, that you can&rsquo;t sum it up with a kind of image</p>
<p>of a pumpkin being smashed to pieces by glass or a pregnant</p>
<p>woman looking down and seeing that she&rsquo;s given birth to some</p>
<p>monstrosity.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to images of that horror, even though in</p>
<p>the long run, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a climate scientist.</p>
<p>The results may be may be analogous.</p>
<p>So I.</p>
<p>I think that when you said that we we need to kind of reeducate</p>
<p>ourselves about nuclear nuclear weapons, I think you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>because essentially for what, 30 years now, the world has been</p>
<p>able to assume that it won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And part of what happened with Ukraine and part of what is a</p>
<p>kind of, you know, it&rsquo;s like the first onset of a migraine with</p>
<p>Taiwan.</p>
<p>Is the possibility that we might be plunged back into the kind of</p>
<p>scenarios that gave rise to those those terrifying films in</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t it interesting that on those films, I mean, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about us as the victims.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s held what held the world back.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s an excellent point about the if they&rsquo;d only</p>
<p>had a few nuclear weapons, they&rsquo;d have used them.</p>
<p>And I think the reason is because what deterred nuclear</p>
<p>war was not the fear of inflicting terrible, you know,</p>
<p>atrocities and damage, but it was the fear of incurring</p>
<p>what happened to us.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What happened to us?</p>
<p>It was if I would say human history shows that if people are</p>
<p>presented with an opportunity to inflict a horrendous horror on</p>
<p>their competitors, they will by and large take it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fear of incurring that that is that is held that held</p>
<p>the superpowers back in the Cold War.</p>
<p>Let me throw in a let me throw an angle in there, too, that</p>
<p>makes it, if not unique, then very unusual in military</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a belligerent to be a victim in</p>
<p>the nuclear conflict.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In other words, if you&rsquo;re India and you&rsquo;re going to be you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to be involved in this war, for example, it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter in a full on nuclear exchange.</p>
<p>People in India are going to suffer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s almost like all of a sudden real war, total war, as</p>
<p>we used to call it, is something that that involves everyone now.</p>
<p>And so so I mean, it&rsquo;s a fascinating way of looking at</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s been a human construct since civilization</p>
<p>first arose.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fight you.</p>
<p>But now if I fight you, maybe you could say that that that</p>
<p>the person right over the border is going to be affected</p>
<p>because, you know, refugees might stream over the border.</p>
<p>But now this is a you&rsquo;re going to be involving everyone in</p>
<p>your personal in your personal sort of conflict in a way that</p>
<p>I mean, there is no neutrals.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I remember I remember reading about it years ago.</p>
<p>But I mean, the polluted milk in Scandinavia from radiation</p>
<p>that I mean, you start to realize, OK, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>if we want to use all the weapons that are in our</p>
<p>arsenal, it&rsquo;s going to involve people that are not part of the</p>
<p>conflict at all.</p>
<p>What did Bertrand Russell say?</p>
<p>He said he talked about that it was unreasonable for a man to</p>
<p>expect to walk a tightrope.</p>
<p>You could walk a tightrope for a certain period of time, but it</p>
<p>was unreasonable to expect you to be able to do it forever.</p>
<p>And I feel like to piggyback on what Tom had said, we&rsquo;ve almost</p>
<p>forgotten that we&rsquo;re walking on that tightrope.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s it takes something like a Ukraine and nuclear powers</p>
<p>being angry with each other to potentially remind us that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re still on that tightrope.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just as dangerous as it&rsquo;s always been, if not more.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think that obviously having your city</p>
<p>pulverized is an utter horror.</p>
<p>But a deeper horror is to imagine that it&rsquo;s permanently</p>
<p>poisoned. So that&rsquo;s what you have with Chernobyl.</p>
<p>You see, it&rsquo;s happened decades and decades ago.</p>
<p>But people are going in there now in the war and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dying from going there.</p>
<p>And the idea that the whole world would be poisoned in that</p>
<p>way, I think, adds an extra dimension of terror.</p>
<p>And then in the 80s, scientists both in the Soviet Union and in</p>
<p>the West combined on a paper to argue of what was called a</p>
<p>nuclear winter, the idea that so much debris would be thrown up</p>
<p>that the sun would be blotted out.</p>
<p>And therefore, even if radioactivity weren&rsquo;t completely</p>
<p>lethal to life on Earth, sunlight would go and without</p>
<p>sun, crops would die and people would starve to death and the</p>
<p>whole world would starve to death.</p>
<p>And I remember that they, the scientists that presented that</p>
<p>paper, they chose a poem by Byron and a translation of it by</p>
<p>Pushkin to put at the head of the paper.</p>
<p>And Byron&rsquo;s poem, he wrote it in 1816, which was the year</p>
<p>without a summer, the same year that gave rise to Frankenstein,</p>
<p>the story of Mary Shelley&rsquo;s novel Frankenstein.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big volcano in that year, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. It was the year before, I think.</p>
<p>And it kind of spewed it up and so the sun was blotted out.</p>
<p>And actually, it was the last time of mass famine in Europe.</p>
<p>But in Byron&rsquo;s image, the whole everything just goes dark.</p>
<p>And the theme of it is, is that no one is responsible.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s to blame for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a curse that happens.</p>
<p>And the last thing is two people discover some wood.</p>
<p>They set light to it.</p>
<p>They realise they hate each other.</p>
<p>They kill each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the cheery note on which it ends.</p>
<p>The one thing we do know, interestingly, though, is that</p>
<p>these kind of things did have an effect on policymakers.</p>
<p>So we know, for example, that Ronald Reagan was really</p>
<p>interested in things like the day after.</p>
<p>He was strongly affected by them.</p>
<p>He was personally had a horror of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>I mean, the irony is that all the time, you know, his critics</p>
<p>were sort of calling him a gun-toting cowboy and stuff.</p>
<p>He was poised to start World War Three.</p>
<p>But we know now that Reagan read a lot of this stuff.</p>
<p>He was really interested in the day after and profoundly</p>
<p>affected by all of this.</p>
<p>So a responsible, you know, these these, I guess that that</p>
<p>bears out your point, Dan, that these reminders, if you like,</p>
<p>whether they be scientific reminders or fictional kind of</p>
<p>science fictional reminders, they mattered during the Cold</p>
<p>War and they they helped to instill, I guess you would say,</p>
<p>a kind of responsibility and restraint.</p>
<p>Let me explain for people who maybe don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about, we&rsquo;re old enough to remember that the day after</p>
<p>was a movie, right?</p>
<p>The day after at middle 1980s, it came out and the day after</p>
<p>was a dramatization of what would happen in a nuclear war.</p>
<p>And the story is, and I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s true, but I&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>it on in several different memoirs, was that Ronald Reagan</p>
<p>used to have movies screened in the White House and they</p>
<p>screened this movie for him.</p>
<p>And he was profoundly affected by it in a way.</p>
<p>Look, this is a man who had studied, you know, I mean, he</p>
<p>should have understood without having to see the movie.</p>
<p>But the movie made all the difference.</p>
<p>And it supposedly the story is that this led to him taking</p>
<p>Mikhail Gorbachev aside for a private conversation during a</p>
<p>summit which led to all I mean, one could argue that there were</p>
<p>a lot of dominoes starting to tumble right then that created</p>
<p>a lot of the world we live in right now.</p>
<p>And wouldn&rsquo;t that be amazing if you were the filmmaker that</p>
<p>made the day after if you could somehow tie your your artistic</p>
<p>decisions into something as monumental as that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another element to that, which is that some of your</p>
<p>listeners may know about the able archer.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>The near miss.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The near miss.</p>
<p>So when so this is a there was a NATO war game.</p>
<p>I think it was in the low countries and the Kremlin were</p>
<p>very worried that this was actually the prelude to war</p>
<p>because their own war games envisaged that NATO would strike</p>
<p>during a war game.</p>
<p>So they they, you know, they got in a terrible sort of state</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Oleg Gordievsky, the man who saved the world.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Who passes that he passes the story to his British handlers</p>
<p>and it finds its way to the White House.</p>
<p>And when Reagan heard this, he was really struck and</p>
<p>astonished because, of course, up to that point, Reagan</p>
<p>thought of the Soviet Union as the evil empire.</p>
<p>And he thought, you know, these guys are the villains.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out to kind of, you know, they&rsquo;re part of the great</p>
<p>the great conspiracy of international communism.</p>
<p>And for the you know, he he sort of I think he writes it in</p>
<p>his diary or his journal or something.</p>
<p>For the first time, he thinks they&rsquo;re just frightened old men</p>
<p>and they and he stunned by the idea that they think the West</p>
<p>would strike them first.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s such an interesting, you know, he had</p>
<p>never occurred to him before that, that the Russians were as</p>
<p>were as frightened of being nuked by him as he was by them.</p>
<p>Because to be afraid of nuclear war, you&rsquo;ve got to think that</p>
<p>someone who has his finger on the nuclear button would press</p>
<p>it. And that requires you to think quite dark thoughts about</p>
<p>people who may be your enemies.</p>
<p>And I think the people both in the West and in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>did think that about their adversaries.</p>
<p>And, you know, as Dominic says, that is was a crucial part in</p>
<p>opening Reagan to the notion that perhaps the evil empire</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t so evil.</p>
<p>But I also think that that is one of the reasons why people</p>
<p>are so unsettled by what&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine now, is</p>
<p>that Putin has the look of Dr.</p>
<p>Evil about him.</p>
<p>And he he has he has the kind of sheen of, you know, a super</p>
<p>villain in the kind of film where the villain is threatening</p>
<p>the world with nuclear blackmail.</p>
<p>And the fact that, you know, Russian propaganda has made</p>
<p>play with that, has kind of hinted at devastating responses,</p>
<p>kind of breaks a taboo, because actually even, you know, the</p>
<p>idea that you would threaten first use was something that</p>
<p>both sides, I think, is that right, Dominic, avoided during</p>
<p>the war?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, both sides always claimed that.</p>
<p>I mean, either side was doing that.</p>
<p>Of course, I mean, it&rsquo;s a slight difference, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Because Putin presumably is talking about tactical</p>
<p>battlefield nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not talking about incinerating.</p>
<p>Although his TV, his TV networks, you know, they.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, they&rsquo;re all that.</p>
<p>They really I mean, they&rsquo;re stuck.</p>
<p>This has got a huge airplay down in Britain because they.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a whole fascinating subject here about</p>
<p>how the Russians actually rather like the Iranians, they they</p>
<p>take the attitude that Britain is the real villain in and it</p>
<p>goes back to the 19th century.</p>
<p>Oh, I sure does.</p>
<p>The great game and all that.</p>
<p>The great game.</p>
<p>Britain is the real villain.</p>
<p>And Uncle Sam is the sort of rich, naive sort of cat&rsquo;s paw</p>
<p>for the British royal family, the Bank of England and the</p>
<p>other sinister conspirators who are really plotting to destroy</p>
<p>Russia or whatever.</p>
<p>And so that we are the Bond villains.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And so they have their images, their images.</p>
<p>I mean, they have they show again and again images of</p>
<p>nuclear weapons destroying Britain.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much so that they had a protest from the</p>
<p>Irish foreign ministry because those missiles also showed them</p>
<p>blowing up Ireland.</p>
<p>Well, they had and they had that they had that classic British,</p>
<p>the classic Bond villain thing where they were going to</p>
<p>detonate a nuclear missile in the North in the Atlantic and a</p>
<p>tsunami would wash over both Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s interesting, though, guys, is that is that</p>
<p>all it would take was for someone like Vladimir Putin to</p>
<p>to use a nuclear weapon in an out of the way place in the</p>
<p>middle of nowhere, blow up some factory out of and the taboo</p>
<p>would be broken.</p>
<p>And I mean, I believe that, you know, when we talk about needing</p>
<p>a reminder and we were talking about how long it&rsquo;s been since</p>
<p>these weapons were used, there&rsquo;s this sense that, OK, well, no</p>
<p>one would really use one.</p>
<p>And I think something like that would would you know, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>mean to to put ideas into someone&rsquo;s head, but certainly</p>
<p>the ideas are already there.</p>
<p>Something like that would be a game changer because it would</p>
<p>literally be the way of saying you think this could never</p>
<p>ever happen. We&rsquo;re going to show you that we&rsquo;re serious.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny because after the Soviet Union fell</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;d mentioned Abel Archer.</p>
<p>But I mean, the the last time we almost had a disaster was</p>
<p>during the Boris Yeltsin era where there was a mistake,</p>
<p>right, where somebody had misread radars or something.</p>
<p>And you turn around, you go, OK, when I was, I don&rsquo;t know, a</p>
<p>television news guy in my 20s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we thought a nuclear war might happen.</p>
<p>Right. No one would obviously go go and declare the third</p>
<p>World War. But these things I mean, there&rsquo;s a great book</p>
<p>called The Dead Hand, which is about the the the Soviet system</p>
<p>that was in place in case their entire command and control</p>
<p>structure were wiped out.</p>
<p>It could still launch a retaliatory strike.</p>
<p>And I think during the Yeltsin era, we thought, OK, the only</p>
<p>way this is going to happen now is is because of a mistake.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re back where we were 40 years ago, where you</p>
<p>could actually envision someone like Putin saying, OK, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to use a nuclear weapon in the middle of nowhere,</p>
<p>just to show everybody that they&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>We can use them and you&rsquo;re not safe from them.</p>
<p>But I mean, to be positive, to just to be cheery, that is</p>
<p>becoming a bit of a downer, a bit of a downer.</p>
<p>I mean, he has he he he&rsquo;s hinted at that and that this is</p>
<p>clearly what he&rsquo;s brilliant at, is making people&rsquo;s flesh creep</p>
<p>and, you know, menaces.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, kind of mafia type intimidation of shop</p>
<p>owners or whatever. I mean, that&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s very, very, very</p>
<p>good British shop owners.</p>
<p>Is that what the nation of shopkeepers is?</p>
<p>That what we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s kind of, you know, it would be awful if if you did</p>
<p>something and I had to, you know, do something terrible in</p>
<p>response without actually saying what the terrible nice</p>
<p>country you have here.</p>
<p>Be ashamed if something happened to it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But but actually there have been a kind of number of dogs</p>
<p>that have embarked in the night.</p>
<p>So obviously the use of a tactical nuclear missile</p>
<p>battlefield nuclear missile is one of them.</p>
<p>But also, and I don&rsquo;t know whether this is because our</p>
<p>cybersecurity is so good or because actually Russian cyber</p>
<p>attacks aren&rsquo;t as good as as we thought they were.</p>
<p>But there hasn&rsquo;t there haven&rsquo;t been kind of devastating</p>
<p>attacks on.</p>
<p>Western cyber infrastructure.</p>
<p>And you thought that perhaps there might be very, you know,</p>
<p>certainly a kind of defense institutions or whatever, and</p>
<p>that is a kind of the raft of hope that I cling to.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a reassuring element of shambles.</p>
<p>But I guess I guess you could say, though, Dan, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually not reassuring because it&rsquo;s out of incompetence and</p>
<p>chaos that mistakes are made and accidents happen.</p>
<p>So I suppose you can see that two ways.</p>
<p>You know, will a nuclear war start because a doctor or evil</p>
<p>thinks it&rsquo;s in their interests or will it start because people</p>
<p>are in a complete mess?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re frightened.</p>
<p>Everything is falling apart around their ears.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s probably the more likely</p>
<p>scenario, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Then then a villain starts, you know, Bond villain starting.</p>
<p>But I think the implication of the fact that these kind of</p>
<p>horror options haven&rsquo;t been taken up, I suspect must be</p>
<p>because there are channels of communication that remain open</p>
<p>between the Kremlin and the White House, between the</p>
<p>Pentagon and the Russian military establishment.</p>
<p>And it must have been intimated on both sides that there are</p>
<p>red lines beyond which you shouldn&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>But you guys know, you know that that sometimes dynamics get</p>
<p>ahead of decision making.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole First World War idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brings me back not to</p>
<p>change subjects radically.</p>
<p>But we called the series that we did on the First World War</p>
<p>blueprint for Armageddon because it was it was as Gwen Dyer,</p>
<p>the military historian, had said, you know, the the</p>
<p>entrance into the idea of total war that makes the Second World</p>
<p>War possible and the kinds of conversations we&rsquo;re having now</p>
<p>possible. Can I shift and ask you guys another question</p>
<p>similar to the one we did about the Romans and the Normans in</p>
<p>1066? But I want to ask you your views on First World War</p>
<p>Germany versus Second World War Germany.</p>
<p>And I had made the statement once that I thought, relative</p>
<p>to the other powers involved, that the First World War German</p>
<p>state was the stronger or more dangerous foe than the Second</p>
<p>World War one. Now, in the United States, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fascination with the Second World War, the Nazi state, the</p>
<p>technology is enticing and entrancing and all those kinds</p>
<p>of things. But it was my position that the First World</p>
<p>War was the more stable society, the more deep society with the</p>
<p>with the stronger foundation. Do you folks have any views on</p>
<p>that? Maybe you differ from each other. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I totally agree with you, Dan.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a complete heretic on this because I think we</p>
<p>discussed when you came on our podcast, I think Britain should</p>
<p>have fought on the other side of the First World War.</p>
<p>Did you really?</p>
<p>Which is not a view you&rsquo;ll often know.</p>
<p>No. So I&rsquo;m a great fan of, you know, I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah. I like a central European.</p>
<p>Those damn Belgians were asking for invasion.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>This was our chance, you know, to deal with the French once</p>
<p>and for all. And we we blew it.</p>
<p>Anyway, listen, I think I think I think I would say I agree</p>
<p>with you. Wilhelmine, Germany was in many ways, you know,</p>
<p>an infinitely, as you say, deeper, more stable, more secure</p>
<p>society than the Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you think I mean, Germany entering the 1910s,</p>
<p>highly educated, very high level of political participation,</p>
<p>very strong labor unions, for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obviously much less democratic than Britain or</p>
<p>France, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s in many ways remarkable, given</p>
<p>the forces arrayed against it by the end of 1914, that Germany</p>
<p>fights on as long and almost forces a draw, you know, could</p>
<p>force to draw conceivably in 1917 or 1918.</p>
<p>Nazi Germany, on the other hand, it&rsquo;s obviously led by somebody</p>
<p>who is descending as the war continues for deeper and deeper</p>
<p>into into paranoia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unstable.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have clear war aims.</p>
<p>Everything is being improvised, you know, as they go along.</p>
<p>It also has this distraction of its kind of anti anti-Semitic</p>
<p>mission, which they they feel more and more motivated to</p>
<p>accomplish as the war goes on.</p>
<p>And Hitler&rsquo;s sort of obsessive anti-Bolshevism as well, which</p>
<p>obviously leads him to invade the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a much more it&rsquo;s a more what&rsquo;s the word?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more dysfunctional, more hysterical kind of society.</p>
<p>So I would say, yeah, the 1910s Germany is a much more</p>
<p>formidable proposition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also got it&rsquo;s got I mean, the Austria-Hungary is not the</p>
<p>greatest ally in the world, but it&rsquo;s also got the Ottoman</p>
<p>Empire, you know, which which Britain makes a terrible mess</p>
<p>of fighting at first Gallipoli.</p>
<p>So, yeah, and I think, you know, that the First World War could</p>
<p>easily have entered in a draw, whereas there&rsquo;s a good argument,</p>
<p>I would say, that Hitler was always going to lose the Second</p>
<p>World War once he does not Britain out in 1940, and</p>
<p>especially once he invades the Soviet Union and then declares</p>
<p>war on the United States.</p>
<p>A draw is unthinkable from that point onwards, I would say.</p>
<p>I completely agree that Wilhelmine Germany economically,</p>
<p>culturally, militarily is formidably strong.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s probably with the United States a vision of</p>
<p>the future if you&rsquo;re standing there in 1910.</p>
<p>Britain already seems antiquated in comparison to both</p>
<p>those countries and and Wilhelmine Germany with its I</p>
<p>mean, it&rsquo;s kind of universities, you know, we&rsquo;ve said at the</p>
<p>beginning that technology and ability to innovate is</p>
<p>fundamental to military prowess and power.</p>
<p>And in that sense, Germany is absolutely cutting edge.</p>
<p>However, I mean, obviously, the one thing to say about Nazi</p>
<p>Germany is that ideas kill as well as tanks.</p>
<p>And the ideas that the Nazis embody are lethally dangerous</p>
<p>way off the scale compared to any of the competent powers in</p>
<p>the First World War.</p>
<p>And that has to be factored into, you know, I think any</p>
<p>any comparison of the two of the two Germanys that.</p>
<p>Six million.</p>
<p>People were destroyed for ideological reasons.</p>
<p>By Nazi Germany, and that simply wouldn&rsquo;t have happened even</p>
<p>had had the Kaiser won the First World War, nothing comparable</p>
<p>to that would have happened.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that being defeated by the Kaiser would</p>
<p>have been a pleasant experience, but it was, you know, it was</p>
<p>nothing comparable to being occupied by the Nazis.</p>
<p>Let me say that I think that plays a role into why the First</p>
<p>World War state was stronger than the Second World War state.</p>
<p>You go to the to the cemeteries in the First World War, the</p>
<p>German cemeteries, and you will come across the graves of Jewish</p>
<p>German patriots who fought for that regime.</p>
<p>And you look at the, for example, nuclear scientists who</p>
<p>defected from from the Nazi German state and then helped</p>
<p>the allies.</p>
<p>These are all people who conceivably in a less ideological,</p>
<p>less anti-Semitic sort of society would have perhaps been</p>
<p>fighting on the other side.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t that by its very nature, when you&rsquo;re when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking people who are members of your population.</p>
<p>And I mean, even at the end of the war, when the resources were</p>
<p>so strained, they&rsquo;re still sending, you know, the train</p>
<p>cars to the death camps.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And I agree with Dominic that basically the moment that Hitler</p>
<p>fails to knock Britain out of the war, he&rsquo;s going to lose the</p>
<p>war, I think.</p>
<p>But suppose he had knocked Britain out of the war, suppose</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d occupied Britain, suppose he had established a kind of</p>
<p>empire, a Reich over over continental Europe and Britain.</p>
<p>The the impact of that would have been immeasurably more</p>
<p>devastating than the allies in the First World War being</p>
<p>knocked out.</p>
<p>Do you even see that as you see when I look at it and maybe I</p>
<p>just lack imagination, I I can&rsquo;t imagine that happening.</p>
<p>I mean, Churchill talked about, you know, everybody, you could</p>
<p>always take one with you and all that.</p>
<p>But but was a cross-channel invasion.</p>
<p>And you guys know, I mean, I mean, simply I mean, a D-Day in</p>
<p>reverse seems to have been.</p>
<p>Well, again, I don&rsquo;t think that that there was ever any</p>
<p>prospect of an invasion, but I do think there was a prospect</p>
<p>of Britain suing for terms.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s which is why I think I think what is it, 10 days in</p>
<p>May, nine days in May, I can remember the John Lukacs book.</p>
<p>Yeah, brilliant analysis as the kind of the pivot of the 20th</p>
<p>century. This this this period while Dunkirk is happening in</p>
<p>the France is in the process of surrendering and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>possibility that Churchill will be toppled and that the British</p>
<p>government will open peace feelers to Italy and therefore</p>
<p>by extension to Germany in the very process of opening up</p>
<p>peace feelers would have crippled Britain&rsquo;s ability to</p>
<p>maintain morale and that perhaps there you would, you know,</p>
<p>Britain might not have been occupied, but it would have been</p>
<p>a kind of vicious regime.</p>
<p>And would the United States have become engaged then if it was</p>
<p>if it was a kind of continental Europe with this lethally</p>
<p>anti-Semitic racist regime that essentially was kind of</p>
<p>trampling pretty much every ideal that the modern</p>
<p>contemporary West holds sacred?</p>
<p>I I think I think that would have been possible.</p>
<p>I think the scenarios are interesting because let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>imagine that the Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany either wins.</p>
<p>I mean, it wins the First World War, I think, by Britain not</p>
<p>becoming engaged in the war.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s imagine the Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany wins the First World</p>
<p>War. The Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany is then hegemonic in continental</p>
<p>Europe in the 19 going into the 1920s.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a triumph.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s triumphalist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of strutting about it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s sort of preening.</p>
<p>But there are other there are still counterweights to it.</p>
<p>I mean, Britain is still a counterweight, presumably, but</p>
<p>also it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily I mean, the Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany at</p>
<p>that point has achieved its aim.</p>
<p>It is, you know, it has shored itself up against itself up</p>
<p>against Tsarist Russia.</p>
<p>It has put France very firmly in its box.</p>
<p>Presumably the Kaiser now has his place in the sun that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always wanted.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m guessing the Kaiser&rsquo;s Germany doesn&rsquo;t have many more</p>
<p>complicated war aims in the 1920s.</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s Germany, by contrast, is so unstable, is based on</p>
<p>constant conflict and constant chaos.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t see a Nazi New World, you know, that world of</p>
<p>the kind of the man in the high castle, the Amazon drama where</p>
<p>Nazi rule continues for decades.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really see that happening because I just think</p>
<p>that sort of that sort of furious sort of I use the word</p>
<p>hysterical before the almost hysterical dynamism at the heart</p>
<p>of the Nazi project would unravel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Eventually, I because I think that at the heart of Nazi</p>
<p>ideology is the idea that the strong have the right to not</p>
<p>only the right, but they have a kind of moral responsibility to</p>
<p>crush the weak.</p>
<p>I mean, the Nazis do what they do not because they want to be</p>
<p>evil, but because they think they&rsquo;re doing what&rsquo;s right for</p>
<p>their race.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;ve won a kind of victory, then that legitimates</p>
<p>that perspective and it only has to last for, say, you know,</p>
<p>a generation or two.</p>
<p>And that then becomes part of the fabric of the way that</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>Tom, you think people copy them?</p>
<p>You think people would?</p>
<p>You think Nazism would become ingrained in the way that I</p>
<p>know you think, because Tom, I mean, I&rsquo;m not going to make</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s a great argument for him, but Tom, one of Tom&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>themes is how even if we are not, you know, consciously</p>
<p>Christians, everything we do is sort of permeated with kind of</p>
<p>as it were, Christian ideology.</p>
<p>But you think that would have happened with Nazi ideology</p>
<p>after one generation?</p>
<p>I think that part of the reason why the Nazis in the</p>
<p>contemporary West serve as the embodiment of evil is that they</p>
<p>did kind of target some of the key kind of ideological</p>
<p>foundation stones of Christian Europe, of which obviously one</p>
<p>is the idea that the strong owe a duty of care to the weak.</p>
<p>The Nazis repudiated that.</p>
<p>And the other is the idea that all human beings have an</p>
<p>inherent dignity and that there is no Jew or Greek.</p>
<p>And again, the Nazis repudiated that.</p>
<p>The fact that they were defeated kind of has demonstrated, even</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s subliminally, the fact that those ideas are not just</p>
<p>morally wrong, but are kind of.</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re unsustainable, that you can&rsquo;t organise a society on</p>
<p>that basis, and that, I think, is very important to the way that</p>
<p>the West understands not just its politics, but the very</p>
<p>essence of human nature.</p>
<p>But it had the Nazis won.</p>
<p>Had they kind of enshrined that as their own victory, as</p>
<p>evidence that what they were saying was right, that their</p>
<p>race, the Nordic race, was superior to other races, and</p>
<p>that strength was more important than weakness, and that the</p>
<p>powerful did have a responsibility to crush the</p>
<p>powerless, and they could point to a prostrated Europe as</p>
<p>evidence for this, and they were not overthrown, they were not</p>
<p>humiliatingly defeated, they were not crushed, they were not</p>
<p>obliged to surrender unconditionally, then those</p>
<p>ideas would have had a currency in a way that they haven&rsquo;t, as</p>
<p>a result of what actually happened.</p>
<p>A world in which fascism was not conclusively defeated would be</p>
<p>one in which it continued to thrive, because it does play</p>
<p>with the way that lots of people do instinctively think, people</p>
<p>do instinctively, people are instinctively chauvinist, people</p>
<p>are instinctively inclined to think that the strong are more</p>
<p>important and better than the weak.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only kind of, you know, centuries and centuries of</p>
<p>Christian conditioning, really, in the context of Europe, that</p>
<p>has changed that view.</p>
<p>And if those values had been seen to be defeated, then I think</p>
<p>that the corollary of that would reverberate through the decades.</p>
<p>So this is going to be a strange transition.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to try to transition it this way.</p>
<p>One could make, certainly with the First World War Germans, one</p>
<p>could make a case that there&rsquo;s a colonialism aspect involved,</p>
<p>right, that the place in the sun question is much more open.</p>
<p>But even in the Second World War, strategic war aims of</p>
<p>Germany, that&rsquo;s a colonialism, too, in a sense, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to we&rsquo;re going to take over the Slavic lands and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to to rule over the Slavs and they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>the slaves for the Nazi state.</p>
<p>We had talked earlier about colonialism, and I&rsquo;m curious</p>
<p>about, you know, in the United States, we have certain figures</p>
<p>in history. One is Tecumseh, for example, who tried to unite the</p>
<p>native tribes against the United States at a certain point to try</p>
<p>to figure out how you could fight back against the colonial</p>
<p>powers and the colonial movements.</p>
<p>I find that if you go into the history of, say, Sub-Saharan</p>
<p>Africa, North America, Central Asia, South Asia, you have all</p>
<p>these attempts to try to fight back against the divide and</p>
<p>conquer strategy that&rsquo;s so important in the colonial</p>
<p>approach. I wanted to ask you guys if you had an opinion, which</p>
<p>region would you consider the greatest odds on favorite to</p>
<p>resist colonial subjugation if they were ever able to unite in</p>
<p>a Tecumseh-like way against the colonial powers?</p>
<p>So any any region of the world that was ended up being absorbed</p>
<p>into a European as part of the divide and conquer sort of</p>
<p>strategy? Yes.</p>
<p>No question, India.</p>
<p>The British conquest of India was was a kind of Anglo-Indian</p>
<p>conquest. I mean, it was it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for</p>
<p>the British to&hellip;</p>
<p>Because the numbers were so small.</p>
<p>The Indian company. Yeah. And, you know, it&rsquo;s a private company</p>
<p>taking over the whole subcontinent. I mean, there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>way that they could possibly have done that unless India was</p>
<p>completely fragmented and there were substantial segments of</p>
<p>Indian society and different states within the framework of</p>
<p>the whole subcontinent willing to work with the British and in</p>
<p>a way to use the British just as the British were using them.</p>
<p>So the Raj was it was a kind of Anglo-Indian condominium.</p>
<p>But I think that it was entirely possible in the 18th century for,</p>
<p>you know, say, in South India, the Sultanate of Hyderabad, of</p>
<p>Mysore, Tipu Sultan in Mysore was, I mean, he heroic fighter</p>
<p>against the British. Had Hyderabad, had Mysore, perhaps</p>
<p>had they allied with the Marathas, there&rsquo;s no way the</p>
<p>British could have could have conquered India.</p>
<p>So, you know, and the moment that the sense of a united</p>
<p>India came to be formed in the in the late 19th and 20th</p>
<p>century, it became obvious to everyone that the Raj was going</p>
<p>to end. I mean, even the most kind of died in the war</p>
<p>imperialist had to accept the moment that there was a kind of</p>
<p>Indian national consciousness emerging. There was no way that</p>
<p>the British could hold on to India because the mismatch was</p>
<p>too great.</p>
<p>I agree with Tom. But I think that the reason India works,</p>
<p>Tom, is because India had there had been empires in India. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s perfectly plausible to imagine that in the 18th, you</p>
<p>know, had history worked out differently, that there would</p>
<p>have been some dominant empire in India that would easily have</p>
<p>been able to see off the East India Company. Do you not think</p>
<p>I mean, but that&rsquo;s not the case in other parts of the world. So</p>
<p>if you I mean, that thing, all the colonial, I would say almost</p>
<p>every single colonial European colonial empire works, because</p>
<p>it works with local collaborators and local allies.</p>
<p>And that starts right at the beginning, when the Spaniards</p>
<p>arrive in the Valley of Mexico. And yes, when they when they</p>
<p>arrive in what&rsquo;s now Peru. So in both cases, that the</p>
<p>traditional view that we have is completely wrong. So the idea, a</p>
<p>tiny band of Spaniards pitch up, and through their amazing</p>
<p>technology, and the fact that everybody thinks they&rsquo;re gods,</p>
<p>are able to overcome colossally superior numbers. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just obviously nonsense. What happens is that in both</p>
<p>cases, they&rsquo;re working with lots of local allies, because the</p>
<p>societies in which they&rsquo;ve arrived, are deeply fragmented.</p>
<p>And would always have been fragmented. So, you know, the</p>
<p>the what we think of as the Aztecs, they have lots of local</p>
<p>rivals, I think, clash Carla, the, the most obvious ones, the</p>
<p>Spaniards ally with, and they&rsquo;re Spanish are only able to defeat</p>
<p>them because of their local, their local allies. Same thing</p>
<p>with the Incas, the Spaniards arrived, the Incas are divided</p>
<p>this, but they were probably always going to be divided</p>
<p>because they had a history of division. And there were lots</p>
<p>of people who resented the Incas. So that&rsquo;s slightly</p>
<p>different from India. Because I think in India, you&rsquo;d had hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you Tom, kind of big, powerful, rich, united civilizations that</p>
<p>could easily have seen off European intruders. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s true. In the Americas. It&rsquo;s impossible to</p>
<p>imagine, I think the Native Americans of North America,</p>
<p>forming this massive confederation, that would have</p>
<p>seen off the French and the British. I mean, that they had</p>
<p>no history of such a such alliances.</p>
<p>No, but here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s funny. They they imitated exactly what</p>
<p>you were talking about, right? They did it in reverse. So</p>
<p>someone like Tecumseh, for example, tried to use the</p>
<p>British to help him defeat the Americans in the same way that</p>
<p>before there was a United States, certain tribes allied</p>
<p>with the French or the British to try to see the other side.</p>
<p>In other words, that&rsquo;s almost the reverse of what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about, right?</p>
<p>But by that point, it&rsquo;s too late. It is too late.</p>
<p>But also, I mean, I think technology does matter. And</p>
<p>scale of size matters as well. But to go back to the</p>
<p>technology, I mean, Dan, you were saying, you know, why were</p>
<p>people, I don&rsquo;t know, beyond the frontiers of the Roman Empire</p>
<p>not able to replicate the legions? Because they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the society, the culture that had generated the legions.</p>
<p>And likewise, if you&rsquo;re going through a kind of an industrial</p>
<p>quantum leap, if you&rsquo;re going through the Industrial</p>
<p>Revolution, if you are developing weapons that are</p>
<p>fearsome and devastating on a scale beyond the imaginings of</p>
<p>people who don&rsquo;t have factories, who don&rsquo;t have steel mills, and</p>
<p>if you are a civilization that is able to feed vast numbers of</p>
<p>people and generate a huge population growth, then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no way you can resist it. And that essentially, you know,</p>
<p>going right the way back through the entire span of time, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why we all now have urban civilizations and we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>hunter-gatherers, is because ultimately, there are</p>
<p>technological, there are societal advances that will make</p>
<p>certain societies stronger, more powerful, more devastating,</p>
<p>more lethal than others. And when there is a total mismatch,</p>
<p>those who are the weaker will be, there&rsquo;s no way that they can</p>
<p>withstand. So I would say that I&rsquo;m sure that the Aztecs could</p>
<p>have seen off the Spaniards, but I don&rsquo;t think that there was</p>
<p>ever any prospect that the Native Americans of the Great</p>
<p>Plains could have seen off the United States. I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that there was ever any prospect of the native people in</p>
<p>Australia seeing off the settlers in the 19th and 20th</p>
<p>century. There was just no way it would ever have been</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ll make this the last question, but it&rsquo;s certainly a</p>
<p>trapdoor kind of question because it may. So one of the</p>
<p>things you get here in the United States, and I think you</p>
<p>get them all over the world, is this idea of that these</p>
<p>technologically superior or, I don&rsquo;t know what you would call</p>
<p>it, a logistically, infrastructurally superior</p>
<p>entities should not have done what they did, right? So for</p>
<p>example, the people who came from Europe should not have done</p>
<p>what they did in a broad sense. We&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>individual massacres or this, but in a broad sense should not</p>
<p>have done what they did. I find it in an almost, I find it</p>
<p>impossible to imagine the counterfactual in these</p>
<p>situations when you have societies that are so</p>
<p>dominating in terms of technological or, as we said,</p>
<p>logistical or infrastructural advantages. It&rsquo;s hard for me to</p>
<p>imagine, for example, the Europeans finding the new world</p>
<p>and then just saying, well, you know, we&rsquo;re just going to sit</p>
<p>aside and not do anything. I mean, in other words, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this wonderful open land. John Wayne once said it was okay for</p>
<p>the Europeans to take the land from the natives because they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t properly using it. I mean, is it one of those things</p>
<p>where are we assuming something that almost would be a defying</p>
<p>human nature to expect something like that to happen? Well, I</p>
<p>trapped your question emerges. So before you go, can I just,</p>
<p>you know what I&rsquo;m going to say? I know you&rsquo;re going to say it</p>
<p>and Tom will take a week to say it. So that&rsquo;s okay. We have it.</p>
<p>We have it. Well, it&rsquo;s your podcast, Dan. I mean, the</p>
<p>podcast, we have no time. Obviously, if you&rsquo;ve ever heard</p>
<p>me. So I would say whenever people tell this story and they</p>
<p>now Tom also knows what I&rsquo;m going to say, and it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>rolling his eyes. I think whenever people tell this story</p>
<p>and they start sort of, you know, as it were, I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to sound like I&rsquo;m a lunatic. So but but I will, when I start</p>
<p>sort of wringing their hands and saying this is dreadful</p>
<p>behavior, this is very awful. We should feel very sorry about</p>
<p>it. It&rsquo;s all this kind of stuff. I just think that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>historical. I think people behave in inverted commas badly</p>
<p>throughout history all the time. Reliably, big, rich,</p>
<p>technologically adept, aggressive societies will</p>
<p>behave aggressively. I think it&rsquo;s impossible. It is. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s literally impossible to imagine a scenario in which</p>
<p>Columbus sails west and then the Spanish don&rsquo;t do what they do</p>
<p>in the in in in Mexico and Peru, for example. I mean, they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t all behave badly because they&rsquo;re all villains.</p>
<p>They behave badly, I would say, because they&rsquo;re human and</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what people do. So I think the sort of</p>
<p>expressions of slight shock that we have now as 21st century</p>
<p>spectators looking at all this, which is sort of, oh, how could</p>
<p>the Spanish do what they did? How could the British behave so</p>
<p>meanly in India and Africa and all of this kind of stuff? We</p>
<p>should feel very sorry and kind of rend our garments and weep</p>
<p>and wail about it. I mean, again, I know some of your</p>
<p>listeners will probably think I&rsquo;m being too flippant, but I</p>
<p>think the story of history is that this this is part of being</p>
<p>human. I mean, as awful as that may seem to many of us. And I</p>
<p>know Tom will talk about why that seems awful to us and the</p>
<p>sort of ideological sort of coaching we&rsquo;ve had to think</p>
<p>that. And of course, we all have that because we want to think of</p>
<p>ourselves as nice people. But yeah, I completely agree with</p>
<p>you, Dan. I think it&rsquo;s impossible to imagine a</p>
<p>scenario in which Europeans can travel vast distances in great</p>
<p>numbers with, you know, with weapons, with firearms, with all</p>
<p>of their diseases as well, by the way, and in which they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>subjugate these places. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>something intrinsically wicked about early modern Europeans. I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s because to be brutal about it, that kind of</p>
<p>competitive, acquisitive, sort of exploitative strain is deep</p>
<p>inside human nature. And it&rsquo;s an interesting aspect of being a 21st</p>
<p>century, Westerner, that we shudder at that and we recoil</p>
<p>from it, even as we, as I think deep down, we can see it in</p>
<p>ourselves.</p>
<p>So Dan, what I would say to that is, you know, was it bad? Was</p>
<p>it good? What is the definition of bad? What&rsquo;s the definition of</p>
<p>good? What is wrong with going and conquering other people? What</p>
<p>is wrong with, if you&rsquo;re much more powerful, subjugating those</p>
<p>who are weaker than you? And they may sound kind of shocking</p>
<p>questions, but they&rsquo;re only shocking, because we take the</p>
<p>answer to those questions pretty much for granted. But if you</p>
<p>look at the vast sweep of history, it&rsquo;s not at all</p>
<p>self-evident that people regard, particularly in powerful and</p>
<p>aggressive civilizations, that they regard conquering people</p>
<p>who are weaker than them as something that is quote, unquote</p>
<p>wrong. So going right the way back to the beginning, if you</p>
<p>look at the Nama palette, which is kind of one of the</p>
<p>foundational emblems of ancient Egypt, it shows the figure of a</p>
<p>pharaoh combating the forces of chaos. And the images of people</p>
<p>on that frieze who are not Egyptian, who lie beyond the</p>
<p>borders of Egypt, makes it clear that they are the people who are</p>
<p>the object of the pharaoh&rsquo;s wrath and might, and that their</p>
<p>subjugation is the right thing to do. That this is a moral</p>
<p>positive, that this is the correct thing to do. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very difficult to think of an empire in antiquity that did not</p>
<p>see its conquests as in some way the expression of what either</p>
<p>the gods wanted or kind of moral abstractions were being worked</p>
<p>out. So whether it&rsquo;s the Assyrians or the Babylonians or</p>
<p>indeed even the Israelites, their conquests are mandated by</p>
<p>the divine. Same with the Persians, but the Persians</p>
<p>introduced this incredibly novel idea that the world is moral and</p>
<p>that their empire is the expression of kind of an abstract</p>
<p>force of truth and order that permeates itself throughout the</p>
<p>entire fabric of the universe. And that&rsquo;s an inheritance that</p>
<p>Christians and Muslims have inherited. So the caliphate, the</p>
<p>Arab conquests, they are justified by this is what God</p>
<p>wants. God wants the world to become Muslim. I think what</p>
<p>makes the thing that is slightly more complex is the Christian</p>
<p>attitude to this, because on the one hand, Christianity is a</p>
<p>missionary religion that, like Islam, sees itself as a gift</p>
<p>given to the whole of humanity. And therefore, Christians like</p>
<p>Muslims have a duty to spread their faith to the ends of the</p>
<p>world. But what makes Christianity more ambivalent in</p>
<p>its attitude to this kind of imperialism is the fact that</p>
<p>Christ himself dies the victim of a great empire, namely the</p>
<p>Romans. And of course, the cross is an emblem of the right of the</p>
<p>powerful to torture to death the powerless. And this becomes the</p>
<p>emblem of Christianity. It&rsquo;s the emblem that the Spaniards, for</p>
<p>instance, take to the new world. So when the Spaniards conquer</p>
<p>Mexico, of course, there is a sense of triumph. They are the</p>
<p>conquistadores. The idea that God has given them this world</p>
<p>and that it redounds to the glory of Spain, that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something to celebrate. Of course, that is an element of it.</p>
<p>But there is also a nagging sense that perhaps what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is offensive to God. And it&rsquo;s really summed up with the</p>
<p>kind of the great debate between two Spanish theologians, one of</p>
<p>whom, Bartolome Las Casas, argues that the Indians have</p>
<p>souls and that what the Spaniards are doing essentially</p>
<p>is not justified by God&rsquo;s law. And his opponents, when they</p>
<p>argue against this, have to draw on classical tradition to say</p>
<p>certain people are natural slaves. Of course, they should</p>
<p>be. They should be conquered. And I think that that</p>
<p>ambivalence towards empire. So, you know, if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>caught, if you&rsquo;re going out under the emblem of a cross, are</p>
<p>you playing the Romans or are you playing the guy who gets</p>
<p>tortured to death by the Romans? I think that that is an</p>
<p>ambivalence that has laid at the heart of the kind of the Western</p>
<p>conquest of the world, the hegemony that the West has</p>
<p>exercised over the world. And in a way, the fact that people</p>
<p>beyond the West have bought into this, the fact that they they</p>
<p>to kind of buy into the idea that there is a kind of dignity</p>
<p>in being oppressed, that victimhood brings its own</p>
<p>status. The paradox is, in a way, that is an expression of</p>
<p>continuing Western hegemony. I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing really</p>
<p>kind of more more Western than the idea of decolonization, for</p>
<p>instance, if you&rsquo;re decolonizing something, you are expressing</p>
<p>deeply, deeply Western ideas. But it&rsquo;s a kind of massive it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a kind of moral mobius strip. Are these ideas inherently</p>
<p>correct or are they do we think that they&rsquo;re correct because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all of us been weathered by the effects of empires that</p>
<p>believed that and were kind of the vectors for it? There&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>split the difference, though. There&rsquo;s a split the difference</p>
<p>in this. I mean, if you like when I was when you go read the</p>
<p>primary source materials from an era where people absolutely</p>
<p>believed that there is eternal damnation and eternal hellfire</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not saved by a by a religion, if you believe that</p>
<p>your conquest of, say, a native peoples who is who are pagan or</p>
<p>heathen or whatever word you would use, and because you have</p>
<p>you have shown them the way that you have saved them from an</p>
<p>eternity in hellfire, then whatever you did to them in this</p>
<p>one life is by comparison, meaningless. In other words,</p>
<p>how do good people justify this? I think that&rsquo;s how good people</p>
<p>tell themselves that they&rsquo;ve done a good deed by conquering</p>
<p>and enslaving other people, as long as you save them from an</p>
<p>eternal damnation. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>But what is good? But what is good? I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the definition of good? Because your definition of</p>
<p>goodness is constantly changing. Oh, sure. All right. I mean, so</p>
<p>I think, you know, the Aztecs, they were they were themselves</p>
<p>imperialists. Their extraordinary city, their</p>
<p>extraordinary civilization was itself founded on conquest. And</p>
<p>as far as I know, there was no one in Aztec society that</p>
<p>questioned that. There wasn&rsquo;t the kind of questioning of the</p>
<p>right of the powerful to conquer the powerless that, say, the</p>
<p>Spaniards brought, even though the paradox isn&rsquo;t the Spaniards</p>
<p>were infinitely more lethal and destructive.</p>
<p>I mean, I would say, Dan, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know whether Tom</p>
<p>agrees with this. I just think asking the question battle good</p>
<p>is the wrong question to ask about history. Well, unless</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a theologian. Yeah, I guess so. But I mean, some of</p>
<p>your listeners may well be thinking, well, what do you</p>
<p>expect? You know, you get two British guys on and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right. That&rsquo;s right. Excuses for colonialism. But I mean, one</p>
<p>way if they think that is to ask this. So some of the most</p>
<p>effective conquests in history with the Arab conquests. Yes.</p>
<p>And, you know, here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s a question. Were the Arabs wrong</p>
<p>to conquer Egypt? Was that bad? I mean, if you went to Cairo</p>
<p>today, and you proposed that argument, and you said, this was</p>
<p>a terrible thing. It was exploitative. It was aggressive.</p>
<p>It was unprovoked. It shouldn&rsquo;t have happened. The people who</p>
<p>did it were bad. And they were villainous. I&rsquo;m sure they did</p>
<p>it. They claim they were doing it for religious reasons. But no</p>
<p>doubt there was a lot of greed and cruelty and say all this</p>
<p>stuff. I mean, if you made that argument in the center of Cairo,</p>
<p>people would think you were demented. And I don&rsquo;t think and</p>
<p>feel and most people I think would feel very uneasy making</p>
<p>such an argument about the Arab conquests. Because we tend to</p>
<p>make those arguments about good and bad actually with relation</p>
<p>to Western colonialism, don&rsquo;t we? And we think of colonialism</p>
<p>as a purely Western phenomenon as a European phenomenon. But I</p>
<p>mean, imagine making that argument about the Ottoman</p>
<p>Empire, and saying, the Ottomans were wrong to have conquered</p>
<p>Constantinople, they were wrong to have taken. Well, the Greeks</p>
<p>certainly make that argument. Well, the Greeks would make that</p>
<p>argument. But then would you say the Greeks were wrong to have</p>
<p>landed in Sicily, and to have established their colony at</p>
<p>Syracuse or something? I mean, that would seem well, you know,</p>
<p>the argument to me, you know, my answer to that, I mean, good,</p>
<p>you know, right, and right and wrong, good, good and evil are</p>
<p>cultural constructs. Of course, they&rsquo;re generally agree with</p>
<p>you. I generally, generally are propagated by the powerful. And,</p>
<p>you know, the, the ideas of good and evil, or right or wrong, or</p>
<p>justified invasion, or whatever, are generally created to</p>
<p>sustain structures that have been created by the powerful,</p>
<p>because if they&rsquo;re not powerful, then they don&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, in the United States, you could say if, if, if</p>
<p>if we have a problem with the invasion of the Spaniards into</p>
<p>the New World, for example, and they come in, I mean, I mean,</p>
<p>the Comanches had a genocidal war against the Plains Apaches.</p>
<p>But that is beyond the pale of the sort of ethical discussions</p>
<p>we have about this sort of stuff. Because these are</p>
<p>indigenous peoples against other indigenous peoples. In other</p>
<p>words, it&rsquo;s like Gallic tribes fighting other Gallic tribes,</p>
<p>and then Caesar comes in. Is there any difference between</p>
<p>having an outsider?</p>
<p>Well, now your argument is who are outside? No, but surely your</p>
<p>argument here is who are outside? I mean, how far are</p>
<p>you allowed to travel to fight? Surely that&rsquo;s it? No, because</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take the example of the Aztecs. The Aztecs were not</p>
<p>indigenous to the Valley of Mexico, they had moved south. So</p>
<p>is it okay for them to move by land, but not okay for the</p>
<p>Spaniards to move by sea? I mean, I think the trouble is</p>
<p>these are you when you start to look into these, those sort of</p>
<p>moral boundaries, I think just begin to crumble. I mean, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think you can say it&rsquo;s fine for the Aztecs to come to</p>
<p>trudge over land and then start fighting people. But because</p>
<p>the Spaniards have come by ship and have paler skins, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not okay.</p>
<p>So unless you&rsquo;re a theologian, as a historian, I think you have</p>
<p>to regard morality as relative, as culturally conditioned, as</p>
<p>something that evolves and changes. In other words, not as</p>
<p>something absolute. Because if you&rsquo;re treating it as something</p>
<p>absolute, then you&rsquo;re engaging in a slightly different</p>
<p>discipline, I think. It isn&rsquo;t to say that discipline is wrong.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what theology and philosophy and ethics is all</p>
<p>about. But if you&rsquo;re looking at history, to talk about ideas of</p>
<p>right and wrong as absolutes, you have to recognise that the</p>
<p>sense of these as absolutes is culturally conditioned. So to</p>
<p>look at the Gauls, was it wrong for the Romans to conquer the</p>
<p>Gauls? I mean, to the Romans, no, and probably not to the</p>
<p>Gauls either, because the Gauls had sacked Rome, the Gauls were</p>
<p>constantly rampaging around, they were tribes, they were</p>
<p>endlessly attacking each other. The Romans conquered them and</p>
<p>the Gauls ended up kind of acknowledging the Romans as the</p>
<p>most powerful tribe of all. And that was kind of part of the</p>
<p>moral universe that both Romans and Gauls in the first century</p>
<p>BC inhabited. If we look now, say, Dan, the question you</p>
<p>asked, can white Americans sit in judgment and say that, say,</p>
<p>the Comanches were wrong to attack other Native American</p>
<p>peoples in the Great Plains? Inherent in that is the idea</p>
<p>that because Native Americans ended up being conquered and</p>
<p>subdued and subordinated to the power of the white settlers,</p>
<p>therefore they have a status as victims that that white settler</p>
<p>society privileges, because that white settler society brings</p>
<p>with it the idea that it&rsquo;s God suffered the death of a slave at</p>
<p>the hands of an imperial power. And even if people, you know,</p>
<p>particularly on the liberal wing and progressive wing in the</p>
<p>United States, are no longer overtly Christian, then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not denominationally Christian. Morally, in their hearts, they</p>
<p>remain Christian and they retain the conviction that there is a</p>
<p>status and a moral value in being a victim, that being a</p>
<p>victimizer, being an imperial power does not possess. And</p>
<p>that therefore people who come from a position of privilege are</p>
<p>not entitled to sit in judgment over those who are not</p>
<p>privileged. But that is a culturally conditioned</p>
<p>assumption that is bred of the distinctive character of</p>
<p>American history, I would argue. I mean, you could go further</p>
<p>and say, well, that&rsquo;s that is an absolute moral position. But if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that, you&rsquo;re no longer engaging in history. In</p>
<p>my opinion, you&rsquo;re engaging in philosophy or theology.</p>
<p>And for more on this, Tom Holland&rsquo;s book Dominion would</p>
<p>thank you very much. This all day, but it&rsquo;s about 115 degrees</p>
<p>in my studio right now. And I am melting. Where can people hear</p>
<p>your podcast?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s called The Rest is History. You can hear it on</p>
<p>Spotify. You can hear it on iTunes and you can hear it on</p>
<p>YouTube. And we do two episodes, pretty much do two episodes</p>
<p>every week, don&rsquo;t we, Tom?</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes a few more.</p>
<p>Covering everything. They&rsquo;re much, I have to say, compared</p>
<p>with Dan&rsquo;s, your opuses. I mean, these are mere pamphlets. Some</p>
<p>of them are only 45 or 50 minutes.</p>
<p>That is a great way to rationalize my lack of</p>
<p>productivity. Thank you. I appreciate that.</p>
<p>But no, we do two a week and we have a club called The Rest is</p>
<p>History Club. And if you join the club, you can have chats with</p>
<p>all the other club members and they all get very excited.</p>
<p>And they, Tom, basically, they do. They spend they basically</p>
<p>spend most of their time telling us how terrible our most recent</p>
<p>episode was or whatever. But yeah, so it&rsquo;s The Rest is</p>
<p>History. It&rsquo;s not as hardcore as hardcore history. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fair to say, isn&rsquo;t it, Tom?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s less epic and sweet, but we are kind of</p>
<p>inspired by you, Dan. We&rsquo;re upping our game. So we&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>done we&rsquo;ve just done a five part special on the American Civil</p>
<p>War. And you may be appalled at the idea that we could possibly</p>
<p>do the American Civil War in five episodes. But but when we</p>
<p>tell you that we did the whole French Revolution in, I think,</p>
<p>about an hour.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh. You&rsquo;ll see that we&rsquo;re doing better.</p>
<p>OK, well, you guys are delightful. I&rsquo;d love to have</p>
<p>another conversation with you someday. Thank you so much for</p>
<p>taking the time.</p>
<p>Thanks for having so much for having us.</p>
<p>My thanks to Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook for coming on</p>
<p>the program today. Their podcast The Rest is History is something</p>
<p>you should absolutely check out if you haven&rsquo;t already. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a long, hot summer full of challenges in, you know, the</p>
<p>family stuff and everything else. So it&rsquo;s been a while</p>
<p>since we&rsquo;ve spoken to you. Thank you for your patience. I know</p>
<p>many of you&rsquo;ve had similar summers, but I feel back in the</p>
<p>saddle again. So we should have some offerings on tap for you</p>
<p>before too long. And, you know, if I don&rsquo;t talk to you until</p>
<p>then, well, remember, we have a Twitter feed at Hardcore</p>
<p>History. Maybe you can hear from me in the interim. And I hope</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re all having a good summer and a good year. And here&rsquo;s to</p>
<p>hoping that things pick up and get better, you know, as the end</p>
<p>of the year rolls around. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s difficult times for a lot</p>
<p>of people, isn&rsquo;t it? And we hope you&rsquo;ll stay safe. Talk to you</p>
<p>soon, folks.</p>
