    <p>This episode is gonna piss a lot of people off, but you know what? I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Hi friends, this week we&rsquo;re talking about how lack of discipline makes you ugly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a couple of different ways I&rsquo;m gonna explain how it makes you ugly.</p>
<p>One is how other people see you and one is how you see yourself. We&rsquo;re gonna break</p>
<p>all that shit down. But basically when it comes to discipline and looking and</p>
<p>being attractive and feeling attractive, it all comes down to respect. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>core of it. Because even if someone&rsquo;s kind of ugly, if you respect them, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna want to fuck them a little more. But in all seriousness, when you respect</p>
<p>someone, you are more attracted to them. You find them more attractive. And when</p>
<p>you respect yourself, you feel more attractive. So I&rsquo;m very excited for this</p>
<p>episode. But one little thing I want to throw at you before we jump into all</p>
<p>this is the only way that you will begin to respect yourself is by going through</p>
<p>hard shit. There&rsquo;s no way around it. There&rsquo;s no way to get the sense of</p>
<p>competence and the sense of respect for yourself or for anyone to get it without</p>
<p>going through hard shit or doing some hard shit. It&rsquo;s just the way it goes.</p>
<p>Sorry babe. Sorry babe. I&rsquo;ve tried everything. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here to show</p>
<p>you what actually works. And this episode is probably gonna piss a lot of people</p>
<p>off. So if you&rsquo;re like a little sensitive, a little daffodil, like a little dandelion,</p>
<p>you can just be like fucked up with one little like blow away, click off now. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just gonna warn you. This is for the people who really want to grow and</p>
<p>change themselves. So you&rsquo;ve been warned. Okay so since this is about being</p>
<p>attractive, we&rsquo;re gonna start off with how other people see you and then we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get into your relationship with yourself and how you see yourself and how you</p>
<p>feel more attractive. So when it comes to how other people see you, first thing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about is your body and fitness. And I don&rsquo;t want to be that</p>
<p>motherfucker that preaches that shit all the time, but it&rsquo;s true. And there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much weight that&rsquo;s held to it. And my rings keep clinking. I bought two new</p>
<p>rings. If you haven&rsquo;t followed me on Instagram, why? But I bought two new rings.</p>
<p>If you want to go see them close up, go look. But having a nice body is just the</p>
<p>most unspoken silent flex you can fucking have. Because it&rsquo;s a silent way</p>
<p>to display certain character traits. Because if someone has a nice body and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re into fitness and they&rsquo;ve like built their body to look a certain way,</p>
<p>that takes a lot. And it reveals a lot about a person&rsquo;s character. Like someone</p>
<p>has to be very controlled. Emotionally, physically, they have to be willing to</p>
<p>endure pain and physical things that don&rsquo;t feel good. Like you think working</p>
<p>out is fun bitch? No. I hate it. It shows that someone is able to be consistent</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re able to work hard. And those are really really big character</p>
<p>traits that will make someone more attractive. So like just by having a nice</p>
<p>body, it&rsquo;s like people think having a Rolex is gonna like make people respect</p>
<p>you. They&rsquo;re gonna think, oh they got some money. They&rsquo;re not gonna respect you.</p>
<p>Being physically fit demands a certain respect you can&rsquo;t get. Like your best</p>
<p>accessory to an outfit is a nice body bitch. I hate to say it, but it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fucking truth. And I&rsquo;m not fat shaming. I&rsquo;m not fucking none of that. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>body shaming. But a little. Like when I was fat and overweight and all that, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like I didn&rsquo;t feel as good as I feel now. And physically looking a certain way</p>
<p>does help. And these are the things that I&rsquo;ve observed. And the big thing about</p>
<p>respect when you have a nice body, people kind of like immediately respect you</p>
<p>because you hold yourself in high regard. So it immediately makes someone</p>
<p>subconsciously hold you in a higher regard. Because people see it. Like if</p>
<p>they see the way that you treat yourself is good, they&rsquo;re gonna know that you</p>
<p>expect that from them. They know you&rsquo;re not gonna allow no fuck shit. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna allow you to mistreat them because they don&rsquo;t even mistreat</p>
<p>themselves. So it sets up this barrier of like respect and like, oh shit, like I</p>
<p>better come correct. So that&rsquo;s just something I&rsquo;ve really noticed and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking hot. Like it&rsquo;s really fucking hot. Like you don&rsquo;t have to say shit. Your</p>
<p>body just speaks for itself. And that&rsquo;s one of like the biggest things with</p>
<p>discipline is like having a nice body shows you are extremely disciplined. And</p>
<p>a lot of people are like, oh they&rsquo;re born with a good body. A lot of people with</p>
<p>good bodies are a lot more disciplined and put in a lot more effort than you</p>
<p>think. So people that grew up like genetically gifted, these motherfuckers,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to put in like that much work to maintain their body. Or they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s that much work. Every single person you see with a good</p>
<p>body has to do something for it. To maintain it. And to get it to look the</p>
<p>way that it does. Whether it&rsquo;s the way that they eat or the way that they</p>
<p>exercise. There is something they&rsquo;ve done to look the way that they look. People</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just look good by accident. I promise. People like to make it seem like</p>
<p>that. And the way people that look good and just have good genetics, you assume</p>
<p>that they just look that good on accident. Their daily habits and their</p>
<p>relationship with food or their relationship to being active might just</p>
<p>be different. So they don&rsquo;t look at it as effort. Or like they&rsquo;re having to try to</p>
<p>do things. They were just raised a certain way. They&rsquo;ve behaved a certain</p>
<p>way and done certain things to their body for so long. It&rsquo;s just their sense</p>
<p>of normal. So they don&rsquo;t look at it as effort. Whereas if you&rsquo;re someone who has</p>
<p>like a bad body and you were genetically fucked up like me, you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>put in a lot of effort to change those habits and behaviors and also the</p>
<p>genetics that you have to flip it. If that makes sense. And the other thing</p>
<p>with respect. If I was fat and ugly like I used to be. I say that so rough. But</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s the truth. It&rsquo;s like I used to look like shit. And I had a lot of</p>
<p>misplaced confidence. And I&rsquo;m gonna make a whole episode about that. Like I want</p>
<p>to write a book on misplaced confidence. Like that will probably be like my book</p>
<p>that I write. Like my first book is like the harsh truth. That&rsquo;s probably what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna name it. But if I looked now the way I used to look. Like out of shape.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t really take that good of care of myself. I wouldn&rsquo;t be taken serious. Like</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t take the things that I have to say seriously. Because when someone</p>
<p>just talks about shit. Like when they talk the talk but they don&rsquo;t walk the</p>
<p>walk. Their fucking opinion and all the things that they&rsquo;re saying are</p>
<p>immediately wiped out. It&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s so easily discredited. And I know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not always the case. But it adds to it. Like having discipline and having</p>
<p>a nice body makes you more credible. I hate that that&rsquo;s the way that it is. But</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it is. From someone that&rsquo;s been on both sides. Sorry. So for me to</p>
<p>talk about anything fitness related. It&rsquo;s more trustworthy. And it kind of holds</p>
<p>more weight. Because I have the body to show for it. Like I have the actual</p>
<p>experience and results a lot of people want. So I&rsquo;m more credible to talk about</p>
<p>it. Like I&rsquo;ve talked about before. If you go to a therapist who has just read</p>
<p>books and got through school and has a degree. Versus if you go to a therapist</p>
<p>who has been through the exact situations you&rsquo;ve been through. Who the</p>
<p>fuck do you think is gonna actually be able to help you? And who are you</p>
<p>actually gonna take the advice from? You&rsquo;re gonna take it from the one who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been where you are. And has actual experience with it. Because they&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>able to teach you the tips and things that will truly get you out of it and</p>
<p>resolve things. Versus someone who&rsquo;s read what&rsquo;s worked in a book. That shit</p>
<p>barely fucking works in real life. Why you think so many people are on</p>
<p>medication? They don&rsquo;t know how to actually help you bitch. They prescribe</p>
<p>you some shit. And I&rsquo;m not saying that people who are out of shape don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>value to share. I&rsquo;m just saying in the regards to fitness. But I do want to</p>
<p>bring that up. Like there are people who are out of shape that do know a lot. And</p>
<p>have so much value to contribute. Like you don&rsquo;t get to just write someone off</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t look a certain way. I don&rsquo;t like that shit. I&rsquo;m just saying it</p>
<p>holds more credibility. But there&rsquo;s plenty of fucking rich white men who</p>
<p>know how to make money who are fat pigs. I know a few. Does that mean that</p>
<p>everything they say should be written off? No. You can learn from everyone. These</p>
<p>men clearly know how to make money. Are they the guy to go to for diet advice? No.</p>
<p>Are they the guy to go to for about money? Yeah. You want to listen to them.</p>
<p>They have plenty of value to share. But when the package matches the amount of</p>
<p>value you can share, it&rsquo;s valued more and it&rsquo;s more credible. If that makes</p>
<p>sense. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about with the whole respect thing. And the</p>
<p>same thing goes. Like if I was a miserable fuck and I&rsquo;m over here sad</p>
<p>drinking every night and like doing drugs just to fucking get through the</p>
<p>day. If I&rsquo;m on here making a podcast sharing ways to like improve your life</p>
<p>and to feel better and to be happier. How much of that are you really gonna believe</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m living the opposite? You know? That kind of derailed for a minute but you</p>
<p>get my point with that. Now I want to jump into your relationship with food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big one and that one&rsquo;s a lot deeper than people realize. And from</p>
<p>someone who has had a very bad problem with binge eating in the past, I&rsquo;m free</p>
<p>to speak about it. Suck me. So typically when people have an issue with food, they</p>
<p>get emotional and they&rsquo;ll get upset and then they become very careless with the</p>
<p>food that they eat and how they treat themselves and what they do. So they get</p>
<p>upset and they want comfort. And they prioritize gaining comfort over</p>
<p>everything. So they will discard their goals, discard anything they&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>toward. They&rsquo;ll discard any of the consequences that are gonna come. Not</p>
<p>look at them, not pay attention to them, and just do right now what it takes to</p>
<p>feel comforted. Which is eat. And I used to do that a lot. But this is very off</p>
<p>putting. Very off putting to other people. And I kind of tie it with having the</p>
<p>nice body. But not being disciplined around food is very off putting. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the point I want to kind of hit. Because you can&rsquo;t trust yourself. Like</p>
<p>you cannot trust yourself if every time you get upset you just throw away all</p>
<p>discipline and all of your goals and everything that you want just for your</p>
<p>right now sense of comfort. Because that&rsquo;s what it is. So it proves that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t trust yourself. And other people are gonna see that. They&rsquo;re gonna see it</p>
<p>in your body. Or if you&rsquo;re someone that&rsquo;s skinny but still binge eats and has a</p>
<p>bad relationship with food, they&rsquo;re gonna see it in your behavior. And then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna think to themselves subconsciously, if they can&rsquo;t trust</p>
<p>themselves, they&rsquo;re willing to throw everything away for some comfort, why</p>
<p>should I trust them? Why would I expect not to be thrown away when they need</p>
<p>comfort? Because like if we&rsquo;re friends or we&rsquo;re dating and you prioritize comfort</p>
<p>and do not care about any of the consequences, it&rsquo;s human nature to assume</p>
<p>and to want to stay away from someone. Because I&rsquo;m immediately gonna think, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be subconscious, the way that you seek comfort and you don&rsquo;t care about</p>
<p>any of the consequences and you&rsquo;re willing to throw away everything that</p>
<p>you care about for comfort right now, if you get upset with me, you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>comfort yourself and you don&rsquo;t give a fuck if the way that you comfort</p>
<p>yourself hurts me. So you&rsquo;re a liability. And I know that&rsquo;s like reading too much</p>
<p>into shit but I&rsquo;m a Pisces. It&rsquo;s what I do. But this is something that will make</p>
<p>you seem less attractive because you&rsquo;re not safe to care about. You&rsquo;re not safe</p>
<p>to be with. If like you show that you prioritize comfort and don&rsquo;t care about</p>
<p>the consequences, what&rsquo;s to say that doesn&rsquo;t lead into your personal</p>
<p>relationships too? And I guarantee you it does, you&rsquo;re just not aware of it yet</p>
<p>because I used to. So my next thing with discipline is people are going to assess</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;ll treat them by watching how you treat yourself and by seeing how</p>
<p>committed you are to things and how much you care about things and what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to do for them. And that&rsquo;s just human fucking nature. We all do it. And</p>
<p>this determines how attractive they see you. Because the biggest thing with</p>
<p>humans is like the more people care about you, the more you care about them.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s this weird thing of like the more someone loves you, it makes you</p>
<p>think you love them more. Because like they&rsquo;re seeing the value in you and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, like it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the weirdest fucking shit. It&rsquo;s the weirdest shit. But it&rsquo;s someone</p>
<p>that you see value in. When they see the value in you, that&rsquo;s when you feel the</p>
<p>love. But like there&rsquo;s plenty of people who will be a goddamn simp and you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a fuck about them. But even with those, like there&rsquo;s someone like so</p>
<p>beneath your like standards, if they show appreciation to you, it makes you</p>
<p>think that you like them. Because it&rsquo;s like, oh you got good taste. So basically</p>
<p>with attractiveness, being controlled and being committed to something is hot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hottest fucking thing you can do. Because that means you&rsquo;re safe. And it</p>
<p>shows you&rsquo;re willing to do what it takes for something you care about. That can</p>
<p>unravel in a lot of different ways. But like however it just hits you is how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>needed to hit you. So whatever that just made you aware of, good. So the next thing</p>
<p>I want to talk about is achievements with how other people see you. Because to</p>
<p>achieve anything, whether it&rsquo;s socially recognized or not, like if you get a</p>
<p>title or a degree or you have some kind of accomplishment, that shows that you</p>
<p>have dedication. You&rsquo;re willing to work toward something. You&rsquo;re willing to</p>
<p>commit to something. And you&rsquo;re willing to be disciplined for it. People that</p>
<p>have achieved a lot of shit are more attractive. Like when the fuck have you</p>
<p>been attracted to someone who&rsquo;s like not done shit? Very rare. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because of what the achievements reflect about the person. Kind of like how having</p>
<p>a nice body and being fit makes you more attractive because of all of the silent</p>
<p>things that are reflected through it. Achievements are kind of the same thing.</p>
<p>Because people&rsquo;s entire judgment and opinion of me flips when they find out</p>
<p>that I am a nurse. I&rsquo;m an RN. I worked as an RN for three years. I graduated at 21</p>
<p>and became a nurse. I quit doing that because I&rsquo;m doing my own shit now and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s doing good. But that, just knowing I&rsquo;m a nurse, fucks with so many people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>heads and it puts me like in a higher place of respect in a lot of people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>minds. Because it&rsquo;s a reflection of the knowledge that I have, the skills that I</p>
<p>have, the dedication that I have, and the fucking drive. And also the humility.</p>
<p>Because it takes a very humble person and a very like down-to-earth person to</p>
<p>be a nurse and to take care of people at their worst. Because you have to do a</p>
<p>lot of disgusting shit and I&rsquo;m willing to fucking do it. And that right there is</p>
<p>just like a big communicator of things about my character that you wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>assume just by looking at me. And that makes someone more attractive. Like if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like a cute little face and I just like dance on TikTok and whatever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like okay cool. But when someone has the character reflected behind it and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so much more than what meets the eye and what they&rsquo;ve had to do took an</p>
<p>insane amount of discipline, you&rsquo;re ten times hotter. It makes you so much more</p>
<p>attractive. Like I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it. I&rsquo;m explaining it right now</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m saying it. I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it. You fucking get it.</p>
<p>You get it. We all get it. And another thing with like achievements, when you</p>
<p>see what I&rsquo;ve built for myself online, people immediately respect me more. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of like they hold you in a higher regard and like they, I don&rsquo;t want to say</p>
<p>they put you on a pedestal, but they kind of do. Because it&rsquo;s a silent</p>
<p>communicator. Like what I&rsquo;ve built online was not fucking easy. It took a lot of</p>
<p>time, a lot of fucking hard-ass work, a lot of internal work, and a lot of</p>
<p>courage to post myself online. A lot of people don&rsquo;t have that. A lot of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have what it takes. And you get this sense of respect for someone when</p>
<p>you see them do it. Like it&rsquo;s very very fucking hard and people are not gonna</p>
<p>tell you that. People make it seem like oh it&rsquo;s just easy you post a couple</p>
<p>videos. No bitch. It&rsquo;s a lot. It&rsquo;s a lot to try and like manage and grow and deal</p>
<p>with hate and then deal with yourself and then stay consistent and post more.</p>
<p>Prioritizing your time. Like oh my god. It&rsquo;s a Saturday night and I&rsquo;m recording</p>
<p>this podcast episode. You think I have a work-life balance? No. My life is work. And</p>
<p>sure there are guys and girls and whatever and like they&rsquo;s and them&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>get famous online just for being hot. But still you respect them a little more</p>
<p>because of what they&rsquo;ve had to do to get there. Sure they pop off fast and they</p>
<p>get a lot of followers but there&rsquo;s so much discipline that goes into the way</p>
<p>that they look and then there&rsquo;s discipline that goes into how much they</p>
<p>post and what they post and creating this image that everybody loves. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very hard to do. Like you can&rsquo;t deny the fact that you do respect someone more</p>
<p>off of their accomplishments that reflect their character. It&rsquo;s just how it</p>
<p>fucking goes. And what did I say about respect? The more you respect someone</p>
<p>the more attractive they are. Two plus two is four. Okay so now we&rsquo;re gonna jump</p>
<p>into how you see yourself and the whole thing with discipline and like feeling</p>
<p>attractive. Your character is what makes you beautiful. And no whoa I just got the</p>
<p>biggest fucking chills from that. Like it&rsquo;s the truth. Your character is what</p>
<p>makes you attractive or not. And I don&rsquo;t give a flying fuck what you look like.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re dealing with people who are truly with it and truly get it and can</p>
<p>truly appreciate you, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you look like. It&rsquo;s your inside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way that you make people feel. It&rsquo;s the way that you care for them. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your heart. It&rsquo;s your character that makes you more attractive. And that is</p>
<p>what breeds confidence in yourself. Because if your character is solid, you</p>
<p>feel solid. And when you just know you have good character, you don&rsquo;t give a</p>
<p>fuck about shit. You are so much more confident and there&rsquo;s nothing anyone can</p>
<p>do. It&rsquo;s like okay you called me ugly. Okay so what? But I&rsquo;m reliable. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>consistent. I&rsquo;m committed. I&rsquo;m disciplined and I&rsquo;m there for people I care about.</p>
<p>And what? So what if I&rsquo;m ugly? Everything about you that you don&rsquo;t like turns</p>
<p>into a so what when you have good character. And when someone has that</p>
<p>level of confidence, I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re a two. You&rsquo;re now an eight. Maybe a</p>
<p>ten. Maybe get a haircut or something. But like you can make that person so much</p>
<p>hotter physically. But that inside is what&rsquo;s gonna breed that confidence. And</p>
<p>confidence is attractive. And you&rsquo;re just gonna feel it. Like it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>what you look like on the outside. When you know you&rsquo;re solid inside, you feel</p>
<p>hot. You feel attractive. You feel fucking great. And your character is fully in</p>
<p>your control. That&rsquo;s one thing I want to say. You dictate your actions. You dictate</p>
<p>the way that you handle things. I know things happen and you can choose to</p>
<p>handle them a certain way or not. But your character is fully in your control.</p>
<p>And when you feel like your character is solid, you feel more attractive. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I wanted to bring this up. So something that will make you feel</p>
<p>unattractive is if you do not show up for yourself. Because you&rsquo;re showing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re unreliable. When someone&rsquo;s unreliable, it makes them ugly. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a fuck how hot you are. If you&rsquo;re unreliable, you lose hot points. You lose</p>
<p>a whole bunch of them. You get knocked down from like a 10 to a 5 real fast. And</p>
<p>you got one chance to have one other character flop. Boom! You&rsquo;re a 2. Or it</p>
<p>will just make someone that&rsquo;s very hot so unbearable to be around if they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the character to match it. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re hot. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>discredited. But showing up for yourself and doing what it takes to like reach</p>
<p>your goals and doing what it takes to get to what it is that you want basically</p>
<p>shows yourself that you will endure pain and discomfort for yourself. And that</p>
<p>breeds self-trust. And when you trust yourself, that is the most attractive</p>
<p>energy you can fucking walk around with. And when you finally do trust yourself, I</p>
<p>have a whole podcast episode about how to trust yourself. But when it comes to</p>
<p>discipline and showing up for yourself, when you are disciplined and you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna show the fuck up for yourself no matter what and you do it,</p>
<p>that relationship that gets built with yourself, that shit&rsquo;s gonna make you walk</p>
<p>taller. It&rsquo;s gonna make you feel different. It&rsquo;s gonna make you feel hot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the best shit. And that changes like the way that you present to others.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re fucking with someone who trusts themselves, they&rsquo;re hot. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care how ugly they are actually physically. Like they&rsquo;re hot inside which</p>
<p>makes their outside hotter. And that specifically will make you respect</p>
<p>yourself. Like when you can trust yourself and you know that you&rsquo;ll show</p>
<p>up no matter what, the trust breeds respect. And it&rsquo;s like, yeah I&rsquo;ll go</p>
<p>through hard shit for myself. And that&rsquo;s hot and you&rsquo;re gonna feel more attractive.</p>
<p>But the character and the self-trusting has me so confident I don&rsquo;t even care if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m up against someone hotter than me. I don&rsquo;t give a flying fuck. I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>intimidated. I&rsquo;m not nothing. Like if I&rsquo;m trying to date a dude and this is never</p>
<p>gonna happen because I would cut them off. Like I&rsquo;m never an option. If like a</p>
<p>guy was trying to pick between me or another guy who was a 10 and let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like not that cute, I don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;m a 10 or not. I feel like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>work to be done for me to be a 10. But let&rsquo;s say this guy I was interested in</p>
<p>was trying to pick between me and another guy. Even if the guy is hotter</p>
<p>than me, I&rsquo;m not intimidated because I know what the fuck&rsquo;s in here. I know how</p>
<p>I treat people. I know my character. I know how I trust myself. I know how I</p>
<p>feel about myself. I know the needs I can meet for people. I know the way my brain</p>
<p>fucking thinks. I know the way that I behave. And like I said, emphasis on that</p>
<p>character part. Like I know that&rsquo;s so strong and the people who are truly able</p>
<p>to see that will value it beyond comprehension. Like they&rsquo;ll choose me</p>
<p>over anyone once they see that character and once they see what the fuck is in</p>
<p>front of them. So once you establish that confidence with yourself and you get</p>
<p>that character set, bitch you&rsquo;re the most hot thing in the fucking world. Like it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if someone&rsquo;s hotter than you. It doesn&rsquo;t match internally. Most hot</p>
<p>people are stupid. Most hot people are just dumb. Like empty. Like they&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>based off their instinct, it&rsquo;s just annoying. Like if they&rsquo;re hungry, they eat.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re horny, they fuck. That&rsquo;s hot people. Typically. Like people get so</p>
<p>confused when they hear me speak and they understand that I know how much</p>
<p>that I know. Like the same thing I said about being a nurse. It just like fucks</p>
<p>with your brain a little bit. And the next part of this I want to talk about</p>
<p>is having discipline to take care of yourself. So when you&rsquo;re disciplined and</p>
<p>you do things that will better yourself, whether it&rsquo;s a fucking skincare routine</p>
<p>or you work out or you eat better or you work toward a goal business-wise or like</p>
<p>you make more money, whatever it is, if you take any step toward caring about</p>
<p>yourself and caring about what you want, when you invest energy into yourself, you</p>
<p>care about what you invest your energy into. So if you feel like you don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about yourself and you don&rsquo;t like yourself, as soon as you start putting</p>
<p>energy into yourself, you&rsquo;re gonna care about it more because you&rsquo;re invested.</p>
<p>You have things invested into it now. It&rsquo;s easy to just walk away from</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;ve put no effort into and you invested nothing into. So when you do</p>
<p>start investing into yourself, that shit&rsquo;s gonna flip. And you&rsquo;re gonna feel</p>
<p>like you care about yourself. And you&rsquo;re going to feel better. Like the thing you</p>
<p>invested in is gonna make you care about it more. And if that&rsquo;s yourself, perfect.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first fucking thing you should always invest in. But when you put</p>
<p>energy into taking care of something, you feel better about it. And you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>feel more attractive. So if you&rsquo;re doing things and putting effort into yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna feel more attractive. And you&rsquo;re gonna present more attractive.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re gonna gain this confidence that comes from that. Like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s truly how to flip it from like not liking yourself or not caring about</p>
<p>yourself. Just shut up and go through the actions and pretend like you care about</p>
<p>yourself and just do the actions that are caring. And you&rsquo;re immediately gonna</p>
<p>start feeling better because like I said you invested energy. You&rsquo;re gonna start</p>
<p>to care about yourself. There&rsquo;s no way around that bitch. Try it. But when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>disciplined like that and you put that effort into yourself and you show</p>
<p>yourself you&rsquo;re worth caring about, as you keep going through those actions,</p>
<p>things are just gonna get better and better. You&rsquo;re gonna look better. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna feel better. You&rsquo;re gonna achieve more. And then the confidence you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have from that alone. Bro, like I said before, you&rsquo;re gonna walk taller.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be the tallest motherfucker in the room. Like once you put that</p>
<p>fucking discipline towards yourself, like your fucking dick is gonna grow ten</p>
<p>inches and you&rsquo;re not gonna give a fuck about nothing. Like you&rsquo;re literally just</p>
<p>gonna be like so confident. And what is the most attractive thing? Confidence.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s misplaced, you know, if it&rsquo;s misplaced, it&rsquo;s ugly. But confidence, just</p>
<p>because you know that you&rsquo;ll take care of yourself. The way people walk around</p>
<p>that act like that, like me, bitch, it&rsquo;s just hot. It&rsquo;s so hot. And you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>feel hot because you&rsquo;re just confident. Like yeah, I take care of myself. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no better feeling. So if you&rsquo;re lacking the motivation to take care of yourself,</p>
<p>listen to my episode on motivation. I have a whole podcast episode about</p>
<p>motivation. I think it&rsquo;s on the audio version. So it&rsquo;s on Spotify and Apple</p>
<p>Podcasts. Just search up Aware and Aggravated. But you don&rsquo;t have to have</p>
<p>motivation to care about yourself and to do a skincare routine and to eat right.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t. You just got to have the willpower and the discipline to do it.</p>
<p>And that confidence I was talking about when you start to care about yourself, it</p>
<p>just comes from contentment. Because you know you will achieve things. Like when</p>
<p>you put your ass behind it, you just know you&rsquo;re gonna do it. And sometimes all you</p>
<p>can control is how committed you are to something and what you&rsquo;re willing to go</p>
<p>through for it. You can&rsquo;t control how a situation ends up or how things go. All</p>
<p>you can control is how committed you are and what you&rsquo;re willing to go through</p>
<p>for what it is that you want. So the discipline is gonna get you to a point</p>
<p>where you have courage as fuck. And what&rsquo;s hot? Courage! Courage is so</p>
<p>fucking hot. But courage makes you feel more attractive. Let&rsquo;s throw it to the</p>
<p>side how other people are looking at you. Of course other people are gonna look at</p>
<p>you like you&rsquo;re more attractive when you are courageous. But you&rsquo;re gonna feel</p>
<p>more attractive. And that&rsquo;s one driving point I wanted to throw in this episode.</p>
<p>Okay so the next thing is emotions with discipline and being controlled. When you</p>
<p>do not let your emotions dictate what you do or don&rsquo;t do, your life no longer</p>
<p>falls victim to the way that you feel. If you just do what needs to be done</p>
<p>regardless of the way that you feel, sure take your feelings into consideration. Be</p>
<p>there for yourself. Comfort yourself. But if you do not let being upset or being</p>
<p>tired sway what you need to get done, you&rsquo;re no longer gonna walk around this</p>
<p>earth feeling scared and uneasy. Because when you just live based off your</p>
<p>emotions like, oh I&rsquo;m gonna skip the gym today or I&rsquo;m gonna skip work today</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m tired. Whenever you have a goal for something, if you&rsquo;ve proven to</p>
<p>yourself every time you get tired you&rsquo;re gonna give up, you&rsquo;re gonna be uncertain</p>
<p>about everything in fucking life. Because you cannot control anything. If you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>control your actions even when you&rsquo;re feeling a different emotion, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>always gonna feel insecure. You&rsquo;ll never feel secure with yourself, with anything</p>
<p>you want, with what you&rsquo;re gonna get out of life. It&rsquo;s just this uneasy feeling</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m so fucking glad I got rid of. And you&rsquo;re gonna have that until you</p>
<p>just do what the fuck needs to be done. And you&rsquo;re gonna present with an energy</p>
<p>of certainty and stability. Those are another two very attractive traits. Like</p>
<p>when you can just feel that someone is certain and they&rsquo;re stable with</p>
<p>theirself because they know they&rsquo;ll do what needs to be done regardless. That</p>
<p>shit, again, hot. But this basically leads you to feeling impenetrable. Like if</p>
<p>nothing can stop you, it&rsquo;s more like unstoppable. Like if nothing can stop you,</p>
<p>bro, the way that&rsquo;s gonna make you fucking feel, I can&rsquo;t explain it. Like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just, you&rsquo;re gonna feel hot as fuck. Because like I said, how I go up</p>
<p>against someone that&rsquo;s hotter than me, I don&rsquo;t give a shit. Because I know that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have all the character that I have. When you have that character trait</p>
<p>specifically, being unstoppable, you know you&rsquo;ll accomplish anything you set your</p>
<p>mind to. Shit. There&rsquo;s no like beating that one. Okay, so now I&rsquo;m gonna talk</p>
<p>about something with motivation when it comes to discipline. And how to kind of</p>
<p>make motivation easier. Like I said, I have the whole episode of motivation but</p>
<p>this is just like a little nugget for this episode. So many times, most days out</p>
<p>of the week, I do not feel like going to the gym. Right now, I do not feel like</p>
<p>recording this podcast episode. I have a hundred fucking things to do. I&rsquo;m sick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired. I don&rsquo;t want to be doing it. But here I fucking am. I post on Sundays.</p>
<p>We got Sunday service with Leo. Literally, I post on Sundays. And if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna identify with that and claim that and state that, I gotta put my ass behind</p>
<p>it. But my point with the motivation is having a track record makes things so</p>
<p>much easier. So basically, it gets easier to do shit the more proof you have that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done it and that you can do it. So how I have like 60 something episodes</p>
<p>now, all the times I have been like, fuck, I don&rsquo;t want to record right now. But I</p>
<p>have to get the episode out by Sunday. Right now, I feel like I just don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to do it. And it&rsquo;s easy to let those emotions take over. But when you have a</p>
<p>track record and you can see the strength that you&rsquo;ve exuded so many</p>
<p>times, it gives you a sense of credibility and it assures you and it</p>
<p>kind of validates how strong you are. And it&rsquo;s very hard to feel incapable when</p>
<p>you have a fuck ton of proof to back up you will do what needs to be done. And</p>
<p>that is the biggest motivation. Because knowing I have posted for the last</p>
<p>Sunday, for the last like year and something, I&rsquo;m like, girl, what is this</p>
<p>Sunday? I&rsquo;ve been tired before. I&rsquo;ve not wanted to do it before. Huh, I could do it</p>
<p>right now and here I am. But the point I have with that is it&rsquo;s easier to go as</p>
<p>you go. Like it&rsquo;s easier to continue as you go and as you have more proof of</p>
<p>like times you&rsquo;ve done it. So if you&rsquo;re trying to go to the gym, if you can look</p>
<p>back and say, oh I&rsquo;ve been to the gym for the last two months. What the fuck, I</p>
<p>can go today too. It&rsquo;s just gonna stack on itself. So you have to get through that</p>
<p>first like brunt of like not having any proof to like look back and have proof.</p>
<p>You have to just do the hard shit and build that proof for yourself to be able</p>
<p>to look back on. And then shit gets so much easier. Like I used to have to fully</p>
<p>fight myself to make podcast episodes sometimes. But like tonight, having 64</p>
<p>episodes to look back on, I&rsquo;m like I got this shit. Like the more proof you have</p>
<p>of your strength, the easier it is to be reminded of it and see it and the easier</p>
<p>shit will feel. Just goddamn do it. And also with that, the more you invest in</p>
<p>something, the harder it is to quit. So how much I&rsquo;ve invested to this podcast</p>
<p>already, like how much time and effort and energy, 64 fucking episodes. You think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna fuck up now? Like I&rsquo;ve invested so much that I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m not fucking it</p>
<p>up. So that&rsquo;s my biggest trick. If you want to make sure you don&rsquo;t quit</p>
<p>something is invest so much into it that the pain of quitting is worse than the</p>
<p>pain of continuing. And that is truly what the fuck is gonna keep you on track</p>
<p>and kick you in the ass when you need it. The only time you feel the urge to quit</p>
<p>is when you feel like there&rsquo;s a relief from pain. But if you have so much pain</p>
<p>on the other side of quitting, you ain&rsquo;t choosing that. Like it&rsquo;s easier to just</p>
<p>continue forward. So one more thing about discipline and kind of like being more</p>
<p>attractive is the most endearing thing that you can do is look out for your</p>
<p>future self. It&rsquo;s to do something now to make sure you get where it is you want</p>
<p>to go or you feel good or you just do something you know you need to fucking</p>
<p>do. Like the most caring thing you can do is take care of your future self. Because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want your future self to have to deal with consequences. Like sure is</p>
<p>it easier to just lay in my bed right now? Yeah. But I&rsquo;m in front of this</p>
<p>camera doing this because it&rsquo;s in line with my goals and my values and what I</p>
<p>want to do. And also it&rsquo;s preventing me from tomorrow feeling regret and shame</p>
<p>and like fuck and feeling disappointment. Like I&rsquo;m preventing my future self from</p>
<p>feeling that way. So I&rsquo;m doing this now so tomorrow I get to have a good day. But</p>
<p>looking out for yourself and showing yourself how you can care for yourself</p>
<p>and take yourself into consideration. That&rsquo;s hot as fuck to other people and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna make you feel hot as fuck. Okay? That&rsquo;s one thing you can&rsquo;t deny.</p>
<p>Like just feeling how you can love someone is fucking beautiful. So for you</p>
<p>to give yourself that same love. Oh my god it just makes you feel so hot. Please.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m being very like superficial like oh it makes you feel hot. But like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very attractive and it makes you feel so good when like I said you</p>
<p>experience the love you have to give. So the way you take other people into</p>
<p>consideration take your future self into consideration. Experience that love that</p>
<p>you show toward yourself and it&rsquo;s gonna make you feel so much more beautiful</p>
<p>because you are. And on my final note the last thing I always tell myself before I</p>
<p>have to do some shit I don&rsquo;t want to fucking do is you&rsquo;re gonna be happy when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re done or you&rsquo;ll be happy tomorrow. Because right now I feel the biggest</p>
<p>sense of relief because I&rsquo;m done with this fucking episode and I&rsquo;m happy I did</p>
<p>it. I&rsquo;m so glad I just got this shit over with. So I hope this episode was</p>
<p>helpful. If you liked it leave it a thumbs up. If you&rsquo;re listening to the</p>
