    <p>The following is a conversation with Bobby Lee,</p>
<p>a standup comedian and podcaster,</p>
<p>and one of the funniest humans on the planet.</p>
<p>And just someone who brings joy to my heart</p>
<p>with a mix of non-sequitur absurdity,</p>
<p>darkness, and the singing voice of an angel.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, Bobby&rsquo;s just a beautiful human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of his for 20 years,</p>
<p>since his time on Matt TV,</p>
<p>to today with his podcast, Tiger Belly,</p>
<p>that he does with his other half,</p>
<p>the love of his life, Kalilah,</p>
<p>and the podcast, Bad Friends,</p>
<p>that he does with Andrew Santino.</p>
<p>Now, a quick two-second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Brave for web browsing,</p>
<p>GiveWell for charity,</p>
<p>Linode for cloud computing,</p>
<p>Onnit for supplements,</p>
<p>and Indeed for hiring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, on to the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by my favorite browser, Brave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fast, privacy-preserving.</p>
<p>It feels like Google Chrome,</p>
<p>but without the ads or the various kinds of tracking</p>
<p>that ads can do,</p>
<p>I love using it more than any other browser.</p>
<p>What can I say except the fact</p>
<p>that this thing is just fast, it&rsquo;s sexy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really great to see innovation in this space</p>
<p>after sort of decades of browser wars</p>
<p>that the man himself, Brendan Eich,</p>
<p>behind JavaScript and Mozilla,</p>
<p>would come again with this brilliant new challenge</p>
<p>to the big players,</p>
<p>reinvigorating the, I don&rsquo;t want to say browser wars,</p>
<p>but friendly browser competitions</p>
<p>and just being innovative in this space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, really exciting to see.</p>
<p>So I think you would love it as much as I do,</p>
<p>but even on top of that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just great to support this kind of innovation.</p>
<p>Get it at brave.com slash Lex,</p>
<p>and it might become your favorite browser as it is for me.</p>
<p>Another thing I should definitely mention</p>
<p>is they have their own Brave search engine.</p>
<p>Check it out, all at brave.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by GiveWell.</p>
<p>They research charitable organizations</p>
<p>and only recommend the highest impact</p>
<p>evidence-backed charities.</p>
<p>Over 50,000 donors have used GiveWell</p>
<p>to donate more than $750 million.</p>
<p>This idea of giving your money in an optimal way,</p>
<p>optimal meaning it does the most help for the world</p>
<p>or alleviates the most suffering in the world.</p>
<p>This idea is the idea of effective altruism.</p>
<p>When you look across space, when you look across time,</p>
<p>how do I make sure that my money, my time, my effort</p>
<p>is maximized in terms of the amount of help</p>
<p>I provide to the world?</p>
<p>GiveWell wants to empower people to make informed decisions</p>
<p>about their donations,</p>
<p>so they publish all of their research and recommendations</p>
<p>on their site for free, no signup required.</p>
<p>They allocate tax-deductible donations</p>
<p>to the charity of your choice without taking a cut.</p>
<p>Go to givewell.org, pick podcast,</p>
<p>and select this Lex Friedman podcast to check out.</p>
<p>They want me to tell you to make sure they know</p>
<p>that you heard about GiveWell from the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s givewell.org.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Linode,</p>
<p>Linux Virtual Machines.</p>
<p>Whenever I say Linux, whenever I think of Linode,</p>
<p>it brings a smile to my face.</p>
<p>It warms my heart</p>
<p>because I love computer infrastructure done well.</p>
<p>The interface, the customer support,</p>
<p>just the way it looks, the way it feels,</p>
<p>the options in terms of pricing and configurations</p>
<p>that are provided, how easy it is to change those options,</p>
<p>how easy it is to develop, deploy, scale,</p>
<p>whatever the applications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>I just love it when people do infrastructure,</p>
<p>cloud infrastructure well.</p>
<p>This is good for both personal projects,</p>
<p>like small personal projects,</p>
<p>or gigantic, huge, enormous, huge systems.</p>
<p>Lower cost than AWS, but more important to me</p>
<p>is the customer service, 24-7, 365.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>As they say, if it runs on Linux and it runs on Linode,</p>
<p>visit linode.com slash Lex</p>

<p>to get started with $100 in free credit.</p>
<p>This episode is also brought to you by Onnit,</p>
<p>a nutrition, supplement, and fitness company.</p>
<p>They make AlphaBrain, a supplement you may have heard of,</p>
<p>especially if you listened to the Joe Rogan experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nootropic that helps support memory,</p>
<p>mental speed, and focus.</p>
<p>I use it to boost my mind</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m going into a deep work session.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a particularly difficult</p>
<p>two, three, four-hour session</p>
<p>when I have to think through a problem,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take an AlphaBrain.</p>
<p>It helps me clear the mind and achieve focus.</p>
<p>When I know I&rsquo;m gonna go down difficult side roads</p>
<p>that potentially and often do lead to dead ends,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most frustrating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most difficult thinking I have to do</p>
<p>because then you have to backtrack</p>
<p>and return to the main road inside the mind.</p>
<p>That requires focus and patience</p>
<p>and persistence and perseverance.</p>
<p>AlphaBrain helps.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take it every day.</p>
<p>I take it when I really need it.</p>
<p>Go to lexfriedman.com slash Onnit</p>
<p>to get up to 10% off of AlphaBrain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s lexfriedman.com slash Onnit.</p>

<p>as who you surround yourself with.</p>
<p>That means relationship, that means friendship,</p>
<p>and that certainly means people at work.</p>

<p>some of the most meaningful things in your life</p>

<p>This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Bobby Lee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of yours for many, many years.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re one of the funniest people in the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan since Matt TV days 20 years ago</p>
<p>to today with Tiger Belly,</p>
<p>so given that, given your status as a world-class comedian,</p>
<p>how did it feel that you were not invited</p>
<p>to Andrew Schultz&rsquo;s wedding and I was?</p>
<p>What, you were there?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was there.</p>
<p>I was the least funny person there,</p>
<p>and the whole time I was thinking,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that funny that Bobby Lee&rsquo;s not here?</p>
<p>Yeah, all my life I always felt like people didn&rsquo;t like me</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t want to invite me to things.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fundamentally the reason why I do what I do,</p>
<p>so it really did hurt a lot, and I had resentments.</p>
<p>I did some revenge fantasies</p>
<p>about how I&rsquo;m going to get revenge on him and stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, on him specifically?</p>
<p>Him specifically.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like have a big wedding, invite everyone,</p>
<p>you know what I mean, except him, stuff like that,</p>
<p>and then just write him a letter like,</p>
<p>see, that&rsquo;s how it feels or whatever,</p>
<p>but instead of that, because I&rsquo;m in therapy and stuff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kind of like trying to let it go.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;d you do there?</p>
<p>This right here, why&rsquo;d you do that?</p>
<p>I forgot to start the timer.</p>
<p>And now it starts.</p>
<p>Do you want to start over?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s do this again.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it again.</p>
<p>Take two.</p>
<p>No, you still feel like an outsider?</p>
<p>Your exception is successful in many domains,</p>
<p>you still feel?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m doing a Netflix show tonight</p>
<p>with Andrew Santino at the Comedy Store and this and that,</p>
<p>but last night I just felt like I wasn&rsquo;t a part of,</p>
<p>in fact, on stage I go, I even mentioned it,</p>
<p>I go, Netflix, they don&rsquo;t like me, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I just say things like that, they&rsquo;re not true,</p>
<p>and this is something that I want to correct with myself</p>
<p>because I have this internal dialogue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s based on just the past,</p>
<p>and 99% of the things that go on in my mind aren&rsquo;t true,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just at a point in my life</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t want to live like that anymore.</p>
<p>Really, because I&rsquo;m the same way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply self-critical all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of an engine that drives you to do stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it doesn&rsquo;t give you</p>
<p>the kind of freedom that I would like.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you want to be truly free?</p>
<p>Free from your mind?</p>
<p>Free from negative thoughts?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m free part of the day,</p>
<p>but some of the day I spend being extremely self-critical,</p>
<p>and that drives you,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll become ultra-lazy otherwise,</p>
<p>because I love life, I love being comfortable,</p>
<p>I love just relaxing.</p>
<p>I need very few things in life,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll just get super-lazy.</p>
<p>Oh, are you a minimalist?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So if I went to your house in Austin, do you have a couch?</p>
<p>I recently got, this is the first couch I&rsquo;ve gotten ever,</p>
<p>because the guests were complaining,</p>
<p>because I also record the podcast there,</p>
<p>the guests were complaining there&rsquo;s nowhere to sit.</p>
<p>I have no chairs, no couch,</p>
<p>I sleep on the floor, a mattress is on the floor.</p>
<p>Not out of principle, I think,</p>
<p>out of some kind of minimalist momentum.</p>
<p>Minimalist, so we&rsquo;re the opposite in that way, then.</p>
<p>Oh, so you like stuff?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a hoarder, but, because I can throw things away,</p>
<p>but I have a shopping addiction, I think.</p>
<p>Like when I&rsquo;m on the road,</p>
<p>like I was in Oklahoma for two weeks,</p>
<p>I just, I bought a bunch of stuff, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>Oh my God, I went to Todd Snyder,</p>
<p>and I bought, I bought these shoes.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Because, you know, I-</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re wearing them,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re actually, you&rsquo;re using them,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re giving value to your life, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is the last time I&rsquo;m gonna wear these.</p>
<p>This is the one time?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>This is like a wedding, but it&rsquo;s a red carpet dress.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the designer, do you know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about it.</p>
<p>What are you wearing, Bobby?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m wearing,</p>
<p>but because I&rsquo;m on a native show</p>
<p>called Reservation Dogs, right?</p>
<p>I just wanna get into the spirit of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your, yeah, this is,</p>
<p>because if I was ever like native,</p>
<p>and I was in a tribe back in the day,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I would&rsquo;ve been a gatherer.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not a hunter.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna weave baskets with the ladies.</p>
<p>I wanna pick berries with the ladies.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be the chieftain.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>And I would make, after the hunt,</p>
<p>I would probably make some,</p>
<p>so some of the guys make love to me.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not because I&rsquo;m gay, just because,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m eating away.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I want them to like me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a power hierarchy,</p>
<p>and you gotta know your place in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re alpha male, then.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that means.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan is the definition of alpha male?</p>
<p>To me, yeah.</p>
<p>If there was a picture of alpha male in the dictionary,</p>
<p>it would be Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>It would be Joe Rogan?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you hoard stuff, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But you can throw,</p>
<p>when was the last time,</p>
<p>let me call you out on that,</p>
<p>when was the last time you threw away something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually valuable?</p>
<p>Valuable.</p>
<p>Like something valuable to you,</p>
<p>or valuable in general?</p>
<p>Most things that I buy aren&rsquo;t valuable to me.</p>
<p>There are things that are valuable to me</p>
<p>that are like keepsakes for my family and stuff</p>
<p>that I will keep forever.</p>
<p>So like in terms of like an old photo of my father</p>
<p>or whatnot,</p>
<p>so those kind of things I keep.</p>
<p>But when it comes to like, you know,</p>
<p>Aviator Nation sweats,</p>
<p>like if somebody came over to my house and goes,</p>
<p>hey, can I have six of those sweatshirts or whatever?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like, yeah, go take it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If my brothers come over to my house</p>
<p>and just done a clearance,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m gonna take this, this, this.</p>
<p>I generally really don&rsquo;t have a problem with it.</p>
<p>So the self-critical voice is serving no purpose</p>
<p>in terms of,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re pretty, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of yours,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re known to be a little bit lazy sometimes.</p>
<p>100% lazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the self-critical voice,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think that it&rsquo;s serving a purpose</p>
<p>in fighting off the laziness,</p>
<p>beating off the laziness?</p>
<p>The self-critical voice that I have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to compartment,</p>
<p>how do you say it?</p>
<p>Compartment.</p>
<p>Yeah, however you say it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re free.</p>
<p>Put it in a compartment, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m able to like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a good avoider.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good at avoidance.</p>
<p>So for instance, right now,</p>
<p>to avoid, I&rsquo;ve been playing Stardew Valley.</p>
<p>You know what that is?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a phone game or?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>you can play it on your Switch,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s on the Xbox</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a farming simulation game.</p>
<p>And so I like to farm,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And so in playing video games</p>
<p>and doing stuff like that,</p>
<p>distracts me from,</p>
<p>you know what really is going on.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ve mentioned elsewhere</p>
<p>in terms of video games,</p>
<p>Elder Scrolls.</p>
<p>Yeah, did you play that?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably my favorite game.</p>
<p>If I could live in a world,</p>
<p>you played Morrowind and Skyrim.</p>
<p>I played Oblivion.</p>
<p>Oblivion.</p>
<p>I played a little bit of Morrowind,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t like the graphics back then,</p>
<p>but I really played the,</p>
<p>can I swear on this podcast?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I played the fuck out of Oblivion and Skyrim.</p>
<p>Like, eight characters,</p>
<p>played it all the way through.</p>
<p>You have to do all the quests,</p>
<p>that type of thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite thing about those games?</p>
<p>Why did you spend so much time in that world?</p>
<p>Because I like games that you can grind.</p>
<p>What do you mean by grind?</p>
<p>So like Stardew Valley, for instance, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of-</p>
<p>Back to the farming simulation.</p>
<p>Back to farming, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing as Skyrim.</p>
<p>The reason why I like it</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a lot of like,</p>
<p>I have to collect a lot of these things.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I have to just constantly pick things up.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like for instance, in Skyrim,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a mushroom called blisterwort mushroom</p>
<p>that you can pick and then you can make it into</p>
<p>some sort of formula, right?</p>
<p>Potion.</p>
<p>Yeah, the potion, yep.</p>
<p>So I would spend like,</p>
<p>literally human 12 hour days</p>
<p>just going to every cave</p>
<p>and picking up as much blisterwort as I could.</p>
<p>Like that kind of grinding.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually,</p>
<p>the randomly generated quests</p>
<p>that those games do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s designed for people like you?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get bored.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fun for me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s always something to do.</p>
<p>And I find,</p>
<p>like when you play a game that&rsquo;s linear,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s certain games</p>
<p>where you have to go this way, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like games like that.</p>
<p>I like open world games where I can make choices</p>
<p>and I can grind if I want.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Would you stay in that world</p>
<p>if you could live in that world?</p>
<p>In the Elder Scrolls world?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I feel.</p>
<p>In reality or become like an animated thing in there?</p>
<p>Oh no, say like virtual reality.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re moving towards that direction.</p>
<p>If you look at Skyrim,</p>
<p>you mentioned graphics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s starting to get realistic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll sometimes just walk around.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been a while,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just walk around in Skyrim.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can, there&rsquo;s code you can turn off enemies</p>
<p>and you just walk around.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>You can just listen to music</p>
<p>and just walk around.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you did?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would do that.</p>
<p>When you do that,</p>
<p>would you do it with me?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>We would have a house together?</p>
<p>Oh, I mean live.</p>
<p>I thought walk around.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>If you and I were able to go into Skyrim, right?</p>
<p>And walk around and live together.</p>
<p>Would we make love?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, man.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Because we like girls, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not gay.</p>
<p>Well, you told me it&rsquo;s not gay.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>All right, so you and I would.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would hunt.</p>
<p>You would gather.</p>
<p>But in that world.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s no hunting.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there is hunting.</p>
<p>I would, because we don&rsquo;t have to find a bandits.</p>
<p>We have to fight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna gather a bandit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna hunt them.</p>
<p>But I thought you said it&rsquo;s all but the potion.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need the bandits.</p>
<p>Okay, well, we could do this.</p>
<p>You could be the guy that defends our place, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll gather all the blisterwort,</p>
<p>all the whitecaps, all the mushrooms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get all the food.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go to Whiterun.</p>
<p>Remember Whiterun?</p>
<p>Right, or Winterhold.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll do all the crusts that have nothing to do with.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So no dragons, though?</p>
<p>No dragons, but we would have a banquet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d invite the Dark Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The Fighters Guild, we&rsquo;d definitely invite them.</p>
<p>Mages Guild, we&rsquo;d invite them.</p>
<p>Are you a thief kind of guy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a thief guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a thief guy for life.</p>
<p>And you still wouldn&rsquo;t invite Andrew Schultz to that?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>But what a piece of shit, though, huh?</p>
<p>Because let me just say something, okay?</p>
<p>I just wanna get back to that, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, sure.</p>
<p>So I met him at the Montreal Comedy Festival,</p>
<p>and him and I are kindred souls.</p>
<p>We really connected.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he did my podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done it several times.</p>
<p>Done his.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve communicated on the phone, this and that.</p>
<p>And to me, and then he invites Whitney Cummings,</p>
<p>which Whitney is a good friend of mine.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is that I know Andrew</p>
<p>as well as Whitney knows him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that Whitney knows him more than I do, right?</p>
<p>What if it was a competition?</p>
<p>Like it was a tie, you know, NBA,</p>
<p>like a Bobby Lee versus Whitney?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In what way do you think she&rsquo;s better,</p>
<p>in what way do you think you&rsquo;re better?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all about gender optics.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Right, so she&rsquo;s a comedian.</p>
<p>She has all these alpha males coming,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, all right, I have one more seat left.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whitney or Bobby, but Bobby is,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t think there was a lot of Koreans there,</p>
<p>so he could&rsquo;ve used that card.</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>Right, but I think he went for,</p>
<p>you know, Whitney&rsquo;s a woman, it&rsquo;s better for optics.</p>
<p>Okay, so she was a diversity hire for the wedding.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>It was pretty fun.</p>
<p>I have to say, I don&rsquo;t, it was Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>His wife.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>And then Whitney.</p>
<p>Are those the only comedians that were there?</p>
<p>I spent the whole time talking to Joe,</p>
<p>so I think, no, I don&rsquo;t think there was that many comedians.</p>
<p>Some I&rsquo;m kind of joking about.</p>
<p>It was a pretty small wedding.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you talk to Joe about?</p>
<p>First of all, we&rsquo;re both grapplers,</p>
<p>so we talk a lot about jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a grappler.</p>
<p>Are you?</p>
<p>I was on the wrestling team in high school.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>I know this.</p>
<p>As a grappler, to you, if I don&rsquo;t know jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>is there only one kind of grappling that you like?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s levels to this game, I think.</p>
<p>I just talked out.</p>
<p>No, no, no, there&rsquo;s nothing more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a surprising fact that you&rsquo;ve dropped that.</p>
<p>It almost feels like a lie,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve said that before that you were a wrestler</p>
<p>in high school.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny that you say that,</p>
<p>because, and I&rsquo;m gonna cause a little controversy here.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But Joe Rogan, one time came to me,</p>
<p>when he lived in LA, this is years ago,</p>
<p>and he said, you&rsquo;re a liar, you&rsquo;ve never grappled.</p>
<p>And I go, yes, I did, you&rsquo;re a fucking liar,</p>
<p>no, you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And at that time, I didn&rsquo;t have any photos to prove it,</p>
<p>but if you look at my Instagram, I have photos.</p>
<p>That I was a grappler.</p>
<p>Of you as a young man dressed in a singlet, or what?</p>
<p>On the wrestling team.</p>
<p>If you go to the fucking, sorry,</p>
<p>if you go to my fucking high school,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right, I was on the wrestling team for three years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna go to your high school,</p>
<p>so is there actual photo evidence of you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m like, you know what,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being like Rogan right now,</p>
<p>and it really is.</p>
<p>How do we know it&rsquo;s not Photoshopped?</p>
<p>Oh, well, you be the judge then, dude.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is my brother and me</p>
<p>in high school on the wrestling team.</p>
<p>Which, oh, it&rsquo;s, you are, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the bottom, that&rsquo;s my brother to the left.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, to your right.</p>
<p>Oh, handsome.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not, that&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>How much do you weigh?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>At the time I weighed, I was on the 105 weight category.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, so I was also on the tennis team.</p>
<p>What people don&rsquo;t realize is that I&rsquo;m very athletic.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And I resent the fact that people think that I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m doughy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an athlete, so, which is very surprising to me.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>So I was invited to the wedding.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been on Joe Rogan&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a big fan of yours.</p>
<p>I know, I love Joe.</p>
<p>No, Joe, when Joe&rsquo;s, and I see each other,</p>
<p>we hug and stuff, we talk, I love him.</p>
<p>I just talked to him today, said I&rsquo;m talking to you.</p>
<p>This is hilarious.</p>
<p>So why, oh, you hug him, you just never?</p>
<p>It just hasn&rsquo;t worked out.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t wanna go like, hey,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want the rejection.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, if I go, hey, can I do it?</p>
<p>And he goes, I don&rsquo;t know, man, I&rsquo;m busy, man.</p>
<p>I got a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>So if he said, hey, are you available Thursday,</p>
<p>this day, fly out, do my podcast, I would 100% do it.</p>
<p>And that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>Why is it interesting?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, because you&rsquo;re, like I said,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re one of the funniest people in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a great conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just funny it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like this conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I just learned how to tell time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not like, I know how to write digital.</p>
<p>You showed up on time today.</p>
<p>No, digital.</p>
<p>I know how to write digital, obviously,</p>
<p>but in terms of the hand clock,</p>
<p>I just learned that six months ago.</p>
<p>How to operate a hand clock?</p>
<p>To read a hand clock.</p>
<p>Hand clock, okay.</p>
<p>Not that I, obviously, I&rsquo;ll be able</p>
<p>to absorb the information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those guys that just refuse to learn things</p>
<p>if I just.</p>
<p>What did you think it was before?</p>
<p>I would look at it, and I would try to sometimes,</p>
<p>like if I was at a train station,</p>
<p>and I would look at those old clocks,</p>
<p>I would look at it and try to guess,</p>
<p>and I would kind of go, I think this is the way,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But not fully, you know what I mean, really grasp.</p>
<p>So the way ancient people looked up at the sun</p>
<p>to try to tell time, you looked at a clock</p>
<p>to try to tell time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like, for instance, we don&rsquo;t look at the sun, right?</p>
<p>So to me, it was an obsolete information to me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m digital.</p>
<p>You already had digital.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s somehow comparable to you</p>
<p>going on the Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>And you, because it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know much about.</p>
<p>Podcasting?</p>
<p>No, podcasting I can, but in terms of like,</p>
<p>the singularity and all that stuff,</p>
<p>like I know what it is, you know what I mean,</p>
<p>when machines have consciousness.</p>
<p>When is that gonna happen?</p>
<p>Soon.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of robots?</p>
<p>See, if you were in Austin, I would show you some robots.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;d love to.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of robots?</p>
<p>No, I love it.</p>
<p>You love robots.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>In fact, I have this,</p>
<p>I think to me, unless they become hostile</p>
<p>and it becomes like the Terminator,</p>
<p>which I think could happen, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be a Skynet, we have to bring it down, whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely going to be autonomous weapon systems.</p>
<p>So a lot of the robotics research</p>
<p>is being conducted, funded by the military.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>You know, the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>I know what that is, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so a lot of the cutting edge research is done,</p>
<p>is funded by DOD, Department of Defense,</p>
<p>DARPA, and so on.</p>
<p>So a lot of the robots will be used in war.</p>
<p>But hopefully not most of consumer robotics</p>
<p>will be in the home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to terrify you.</p>
<p>No, no, no, but can I ask you this though?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re saying to me is that, as a lay person,</p>
<p>is that in my lifetime,</p>
<p>that machines will have consciousness.</p>
<p>Oh, that I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Computers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the people, well, depending,</p>
<p>you live dangerously,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know how long you&rsquo;re gonna live.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s put, but I believe that consciousness,</p>
<p>yes, could be engineered in a machine.</p>
<p>Or at least we can have machines that are human-like,</p>
<p>and we believe they have consciousness.</p>
<p>Can I ask one last question about it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But just one more.</p>
<p>Will they have the smoothness of skin,</p>
<p>and will they look realistic?</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m one of those people that believes</p>
<p>that visual appearance isn&rsquo;t the magic.</p>
<p>So if you close your, if you&rsquo;re blind,</p>
<p>you can still have a connection with a person.</p>
<p>People can fall in love with each other</p>
<p>through just letters.</p>
<p>So yeah, I know you&rsquo;re mocking me with your entire energy.</p>
<p>But yes, yes, I believe that part too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about sex bots</p>
<p>is what you&rsquo;re probably getting at.</p>
<p>Okay, intimacy.</p>
<p>Why would you?</p>
<p>Just friends, friends, but you wanna feel</p>
<p>the smoothness of their skin.</p>
<p>Yeah, like a guy, just go, what&rsquo;s up, dude,</p>
<p>and just rub his hands.</p>
<p>Just hug and kiss, like on both cheeks kind of thing.</p>
<p>I get what you&rsquo;re saying, though, right?</p>
<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;s no soul, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just curious to see.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, I was going with sex bots, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Have you seen Whitney Cummings&rsquo; robot?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>Okay, how did that make you feel?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t find her attractive.</p>
<p>The robot or Whitney?</p>
<p>I find the robot way more attractive.</p>
<p>Yeah, if I had the choice, robot.</p>
<p>So you were turned on by the robot.</p>
<p>See, I was surprised by the very thing you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which is the realism of the skit, like it was quite,</p>
<p>they did a really good job on that robot.</p>
<p>Oh, they did?</p>
<p>The life, when it&rsquo;s animated, the life is not quite there.</p>
<p>You can tell it&rsquo;s a robot, but just sitting there still,</p>
<p>it has a lot of human-like elements.</p>
<p>The texture, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite fascinating.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re getting there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting there.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But the funny thing about sex robots</p>
<p>is most people that get sex robots,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get it for the sex.</p>
<p>They get it for intimacy, not sexual intimacy,</p>
<p>but just somebody being there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the emotional connection, not the sexual.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I saw a long time ago</p>
<p>a documentary about real dogs and people marrying them.</p>
<p>Yeah, and what I was fascinated about is the cuddling.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And then watching TV together and stuff like that,</p>
<p>which I find, you know, I&rsquo;ve just been able</p>
<p>to find human girlfriends and stuff.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m good at it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really impressive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks, man.</p>
<p>Speaking of human girlfriends,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love your advice in this direction,</p>
<p>but you have an amazing relationship with Kalilah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you two are very different.</p>
<p>So you host the Tiger Bella podcast together,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s real love there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real connection.</p>
<p>What do you love most about Kalilah?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about love, Bobby Lee.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a really pretty deep,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really gone down this path.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna walk down that path together holding hands.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things where the first time I met her,</p>
<p>it was almost as if I had known her all my life.</p>
<p>It was really weird.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>There was a trust there, you know what I mean,</p>
<p>that was just fundamentally there that I could trust her</p>
<p>and that I could, you know,</p>
<p>when I look in the mirror</p>
<p>and I see all my character defects and stuff,</p>
<p>a lot of those things aren&rsquo;t necessarily things</p>
<p>I wanna share with people</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t wanna be judged or ridiculed.</p>
<p>But with her, I felt comfortable showing those things.</p>
<p>And I think she feels the same way about her.</p>
<p>And then secondly, she&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I mean, she made me laugh and she&rsquo;s hot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, you know what I mean, the perfect,</p>
<p>it was like a perfect combination of things.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>One night we were in bed and I forgot what the joke was,</p>
<p>but she really made me laugh one night.</p>
<p>She was living in an apartment in Long Beach</p>
<p>and I cackled, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And generally women don&rsquo;t make,</p>
<p>I mean, women I&rsquo;m dating, comics do,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make me cackle in that way.</p>
<p>And then thirdly, she&rsquo;s partly Asian.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, one time I dated a white girl</p>
<p>and I invited her to Koreatown.</p>
<p>Are you about to be a racist?</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And what I love about Asian girls</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ll eat something first and ask what it is after,</p>
<p>but white girls ask what it is before.</p>
<p>What is this, right?</p>
<p>But Kalilah would eat the eyeball,</p>
<p>eat everything and go, what did I just eat?</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, and it reminds me of my mom in that way,</p>
<p>in terms of like, my mom growing up just to scare us</p>
<p>and freak us out, we&rsquo;d have a fish</p>
<p>and she would eat the eyeball first to see a squirm.</p>
<p>And as a kid that you thought was gross</p>
<p>and weird and this and that, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, when Kalilah does it, it just kind of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it just makes me feel like at home.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In a weird way, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little act of fearlessness.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just put it in your mouth and figure it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I like.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day,</p>
<p>she also, out of all my girlfriends,</p>
<p>and this is gonna sound not strange,</p>
<p>but hard to admit, but my career when I met Kalilah</p>
<p>was in the shitbox.</p>
<p>I could not get anything going.</p>
<p>And this is at the time where Ken Jeong,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a very good friend of mine, very talented,</p>
<p>was getting everything.</p>
<p>And I just remember going, I can&rsquo;t even get an audition.</p>
<p>Like, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I would go on the road, Lex, and I would fill half the room.</p>
<p>I just couldn&rsquo;t sell tickets.</p>
<p>And when I met her, I was just kind of like,</p>
<p>maybe I have to find love and open up my world in that way.</p>
<p>And she was the first girlfriend that I ever had</p>
<p>that looked at me and saw the potential.</p>
<p>And she said, no, this doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so funny, and you&rsquo;re so relevant to me,</p>
<p>and this is what we&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>And so she started Tiger Belly.</p>
<p>You know, and then obviously I had the skillset to do it,</p>
<p>but once Tiger Belly happened,</p>
<p>and then Andrew was like, let&rsquo;s do Bad Friends,</p>
<p>and then now things are great.</p>
<p>You know, my career is, I&rsquo;m too busy almost,</p>
<p>in a weird way, you know?</p>
<p>And I feel like she had a lot to do with,</p>
<p>like, for instance, before I met her,</p>
<p>even if I would&rsquo;ve get an audition,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go because I just wouldn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>In my head, I was like, I&rsquo;m not gonna get this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone on a thousand of these,</p>
<p>and they just never hire me.</p>
<p>But she was, so I just didn&rsquo;t go on them for years.</p>
<p>And then she was the first girlfriend that said,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t care if you don&rsquo;t get it, right?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want you to be a pussy,</p>
<p>and I want you to walk through fear.</p>
<p>And so she would drag me to these fucking things,</p>
<p>and I, for some reason, would book them.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And so, you know, in that way.</p>
<p>She saw the potential of what you could be.</p>
<p>She loved you for who you are already.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But also loved you for the potential that you could become.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m lucky in that way, you know?</p>
<p>So on day one, you could show her,</p>
<p>you said you could show your flaws to her?</p>
<p>Like, you felt like you could be fragile with her?</p>
<p>Well, I accidentally farted.</p>
<p>Yeah, on day one?</p>
<p>On day one.</p>
<p>You know, because I just, I&rsquo;m a fart machine.</p>
<p>And I have loose cheeks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like how you, for the listeners,</p>
<p>you just winked at me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have loose cheeks, and-</p>
<p>But not in a gay way.</p>
<p>Not in a gay way, no.</p>
<p>And I was, we were on a couch, and we&rsquo;re talking,</p>
<p>and I kind of adjusted my body.</p>
<p>I ripped one by accident.</p>
<p>And she laughed, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t embarrassing, you know?</p>
<p>And also, I have a little penis.</p>
<p>I have a little penis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all relative.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a little.</p>
<p>But relative to an elephant.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s penis is little.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m not an elephant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a human, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So, relatively human, it&rsquo;s very small.</p>
<p>And so, when she saw it, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I thought she was gonna balk at it, right?</p>
<p>And she looked at it as if it was like an orphan.</p>
<p>Like, I wanna, you know, it&rsquo;s a lost child,</p>
<p>and I wanna, you know, take care of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cradle it.</p>
<p>Cradle it, yeah.</p>
<p>What about you, man?</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t met anybody like that?</p>
<p>Never met a girl, never seen one of them.</p>
<p>I hear they&rsquo;re nice.</p>
<p>When are the two of you getting married?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that something you would like?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This comes up sometimes.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re in couples counseling.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on some issues that we have.</p>
<p>Every relationship, even my friendships have issues.</p>
<p>And so, we&rsquo;re working through some issues,</p>
<p>and once we get to the end of it, we&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
<p>Would you like to be a father one day?</p>
<p>This is kind of couples counseling.</p>
<p>You know, yeah, I do.</p>
<p>I do, because I feel like,</p>
<p>you know, before I was very childlike.</p>
<p>You know, I play a lot of video games,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m irresponsible, I&rsquo;m lazy, this and that, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, to be honest with you, Lex,</p>
<p>in the last six months,</p>
<p>I really have come through some breakthroughs,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m in therapy, and I&rsquo;m doing a lot of things,</p>
<p>and really self-analyzing myself, and my behaviors,</p>
<p>and what I want, my desires,</p>
<p>and I think ultimately, yes, I really do,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a life experience that, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be an old man looking back and going,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve always was interested in,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s based on fear,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to scar my child</p>
<p>the way my parents scarred me,</p>
<p>but at the same time, my parents didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>the work on themselves like I am,</p>
<p>and they were never about self-improvement,</p>
<p>they were just about, they were immigrants, you know,</p>
<p>and they wanted to put food on the table,</p>
<p>and after that, they just went about their business,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not like that.</p>
<p>I would never be violent toward my kids</p>
<p>like my parents were.</p>
<p>My dad was very physically abusive, you know,</p>
<p>there was a lot of trauma and stuff,</p>
<p>and so, you know, as a kid, I thought,</p>
<p>you know, I just would never put my kid through this,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I never wanted it,</p>
<p>but I would completely do it differently, you know,</p>
<p>even yelling and those kind of things,</p>
<p>I would be very mindful about those things,</p>
<p>and I think that I have certain things,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m not a science-y guy like you,</p>
<p>but there are life things that I&rsquo;ve learned over the years</p>
<p>that I could teach a child, you know,</p>
<p>about living in the moment or walking through fear,</p>
<p>or, you know, things that, you know,</p>
<p>things will pass, and just different things,</p>
<p>you know, that I could, I would be a good listener,</p>
<p>and yeah, I would like to do that.</p>
<p>So your dad died in August of 2019.</p>
<p>Wow, yeah.</p>
<p>He did your research.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s on your Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you said some of it was rough,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your fondest memory of your dad?</p>
<p>Well, those memories happened later in life.</p>
<p>As a child, my fondest memory was my mom,</p>
<p>because he never spent time with us,</p>
<p>so my mom made him take me out one time,</p>
<p>one day, and he took me to a park.</p>
<p>Like, he doesn&rsquo;t, there was no baseball glove,</p>
<p>or baseball, or anything like that,</p>
<p>and we sat on a park bench, right?</p>
<p>And we just sat there for hours.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t talk, because he didn&rsquo;t know English that well,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Korean, so it&rsquo;s just very, you know,</p>
<p>basic, you know, information being, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>This is how we go, how are you doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay, you know?</p>
<p>Good, good, good.</p>
<p>That type of thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, for a long time.</p>
<p>For a long time, and then, but the day turned bad,</p>
<p>because I forgot my jacket there, and he yelled at me.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a bit of peace together.</p>
<p>At that time, yeah, there was peace.</p>
<p>But then what happened was, later in life,</p>
<p>when I got Matt TV, and I was doing, you know,</p>
<p>in my early years, you know, I&rsquo;d booked a couple of things,</p>
<p>like in 2000, I did The Tonight Show on Leno,</p>
<p>and then I did, I got Matt TV in 2000.</p>
<p>And, wow, that was over 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when my parents kind of went, huh, you know?</p>
<p>Because obviously, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some nepotism in Hollywood, right?</p>
<p>But in my case, my parents were straight up immigrants.</p>
<p>I had no connections to Hollywood.</p>
<p>And I came up here poor, you know, with no connections,</p>
<p>and I built it, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Through the years, you know?</p>
<p>And in that way, I&rsquo;m very proud of myself,</p>
<p>because I went through a lot of fucking hell,</p>
<p>and sadness, and desperation, and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And I persevered, and I did all that shit on my own, man.</p>
<p>I booked The Tonight Show on my own.</p>
<p>I got Matt TV on my own.</p>
<p>And when I did those things, my parents were very proud.</p>
<p>But before that, did they doubt you?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not funny.</p>
<p>You know, you never make me laugh, right?</p>
<p>And that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never gonna make it, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be poor all your life,</p>
<p>you know, and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But Matt TV, he was proud, your dad, your parents?</p>
<p>Well, you know, because it was a weekly show,</p>
<p>so on Saturday nights, they would watch it.</p>
<p>They would?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I would play characters</p>
<p>that they would understand.</p>
<p>Like I did Kim Jong-il at the time, right?</p>
<p>So they loved that, right?</p>
<p>They loved the things that I would do,</p>
<p>the physical comedy.</p>
<p>And they couldn&rsquo;t believe in their mind.</p>
<p>Imagine your parents from Korea coming here,</p>
<p>not knowing the language, having a child here, right?</p>
<p>And in their minds, that was never an option.</p>
<p>An option, right?</p>
<p>And so when they see their kid, I guess, on TV,</p>
<p>especially, there was no internet too at the time.</p>
<p>The internet had just started.</p>
<p>So to them, they were like, this is a miracle.</p>
<p>In fact, when I did The Tonight Show,</p>
<p>my dad called me the next day and asked me,</p>
<p>how much, he literally asked me this.</p>
<p>He goes, how much did you pay them to do it?</p>
<p>He thought that I had saved all my money.</p>
<p>He thought that Tom Cruise goes up there and goes,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a grand, thanks for having me on.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>No, I go, no, they asked me.</p>
<p>Conceptually, they were just shocked by it.</p>
<p>So when I got it and then they were watching me weekly,</p>
<p>MADtv, the producer was like, hey, have your dad on.</p>
<p>So my dad did two or three sketches on television.</p>
<p>So those memories, I also did a pilot for Comedy Central</p>
<p>and he was on my pilot.</p>
<p>A pilot for a show?</p>
<p>Yeah, a show.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t get picked up, but he was on the pilot.</p>
<p>He was in the show?</p>
<p>Yeah, he was in the pilot.</p>
<p>He was on MADtv too, on television.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so it&rsquo;s like, he would get residual checks.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>This changed everything.</p>
<p>There was nepotism in reverse.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was really nepotism in reverse.</p>
<p>And so he, those memories are very,</p>
<p>I have very fond memories because he had changed as well.</p>
<p>He was no longer that violent kind of a guy.</p>
<p>He had softened a lot, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But when he died is when those issues came up,</p>
<p>like a freight train.</p>
<p>The bad stuff.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.</p>
<p>It was really hard.</p>
<p>You miss him?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How often do you think about him?</p>
<p>Every day.</p>
<p>Obviously a lot of it&rsquo;s regrets, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like what kind of regrets?</p>
<p>Not having said something or not having had a conversation?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not regrets because even if he was still alive,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just things that are impossibilities</p>
<p>because of his culture and the way he was raised.</p>
<p>But my regret in life will always be having those types of,</p>
<p>even, because I was with my mom a couple of months ago</p>
<p>and I looked at her and I had tears in my eyes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at a Starbucks.</p>
<p>I go, mom, I just wanna let you know that I&rsquo;m so sorry</p>
<p>that you lived in that house and my dad,</p>
<p>you know, and dad hit you and you survived.</p>
<p>You stayed in the marriage because of us, right?</p>
<p>And you know what her response was?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to Book of the Pebble.</p>
<p>She wanted Italian food.</p>
<p>It was like there was no, there was nothing there, right?</p>
<p>And so my regret is that they just will never be able</p>
<p>to even grasp the concept of that kind of communication,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll never have it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sad to me, you know?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that callous that comes with the immigrant mentality,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even, that emotional connection is not even there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had, my grandmother, she,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called Holodomor,</p>
<p>which is starvation in Ukraine in the 1930s</p>
<p>that you had to live through.</p>
<p>She lived through World War II and there&rsquo;s nothing,</p>
<p>like the only way you survive that is the callous you bring.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>People that fought in major wars, they can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t, yeah.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>My mom, when she was 12 years old,</p>
<p>she walked her little sister, my aunt, to school, right?</p>
<p>She forgot a book.</p>
<p>So my mom goes to my little sister, my aunt,</p>
<p>stay here, I&rsquo;m gonna go get my book.</p>
<p>She ran up, she came back.</p>
<p>While she was gone, a military truck ran over my aunt</p>
<p>and my mom discovered her body split in half,</p>
<p>in trails, the whole thing.</p>
<p>And my mom and my uncles had to go and get rice bags</p>
<p>to pick up her, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And then bury my aunt.</p>
<p>When you live through something like that,</p>
<p>and also the guilt, because my mom believes deep down</p>
<p>that if she didn&rsquo;t forget that book,</p>
<p>that my aunt would still be alive, right?</p>
<p>So she carries all this guilt and this,</p>
<p>and to survive all that trauma, you have to build a callous.</p>
<p>Back then, they didn&rsquo;t have EMDR and therapists</p>
<p>and psychologists and any of that, right?</p>
<p>So they had to survive.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s who she is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad to me that, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;ll forever, she&rsquo;ll forever live in that torment.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Boy, what about your own?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been the darkest place you ever gone in your mind?</p>
<p>Oh my God, what the, you wrote that down?</p>
<p>In my mind?</p>
<p>In your mind.</p>
<p>You ever consider suicide?</p>
<p>Have you? I didn&rsquo;t write that down.</p>
<p>Have you considered it?</p>
<p>In the distance.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve distantly thought about it.</p>
<p>About four months ago, I was in a really bad place.</p>
<p>I was naked in a hotel room in Arizona.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t eaten in like almost a week.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t slept in over a week.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t slept, you know, and I thought I was dying.</p>
<p>I was coughing up blood and I was waiting</p>
<p>to go into a outpatient psychologist place,</p>
<p>you know what I mean, in Arizona.</p>
<p>I literally thought I was dying.</p>
<p>So recently I was in a very dark place.</p>
<p>How much was that connected to losing your father?</p>
<p>How much was that connected to rehab and that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Alcohol, drugs?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same thing, dude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same thing, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all from my childhood, right?</p>
<p>The reason why I do stand-up is because of my childhood.</p>
<p>The hating yourself or like being self-critical,</p>
<p>that has to do with your childhood?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the drugs and drinking is childhood?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s childhood.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about survival and protecting your heart,</p>
<p>you know, and there are ways that I did that as a kid,</p>
<p>like using humor as a defense mechanism</p>
<p>and also avoidance of all emotions, you know what I mean,</p>
<p>because I just wanted to feel.</p>
<p>And the reason why comedy is so good,</p>
<p>the reason why I was able to survive in comedy</p>
<p>is because I can withstand a lot of bullshit and pain,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like physical, emotional, spiritual pain, I can absorb it.</p>
<p>But now what&rsquo;s happened later in life</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m unwilling to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unwilling to absorb it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unwilling to carry this weight around with me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll kill me.</p>
<p>So I am doing everything I can</p>
<p>to free myself of all this baggage.</p>
<p>Okay, so how you&rsquo;re naked in Arizona in a hotel room,</p>
<p>face down or face up or on the side?</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s your favorite, when you go to a dark place?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>On the floor, on the bed or bathtub, shower?</p>
<p>A fetal position.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t lay on my stomach, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m not doing like a downward dog or yoga position</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m like.</p>
<p>On the bed, on the floor?</p>
<p>No, what happened was,</p>
<p>so I had a relapse.</p>
<p>So I was doing drinking all night long.</p>
<p>What was the first relapse?</p>
<p>What is the first thing you did?</p>
<p>Just drank, what, wine?</p>
<p>No, I took an edible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that opened the door?</p>
<p>To drinking, yeah.</p>
<p>And the combination&rsquo;s not good for me.</p>
<p>And the excess of the amount is not good for me.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t stop and I do it 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Were you alone?</p>
<p>Well, no, I was living with Kalilah.</p>
<p>No, I mean, at that moment when you did the edibles.</p>
<p>I was alone.</p>
<p>No, I took a flight because I was shooting Magnum,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a show called Magnum P.I.</p>
<p>So I was flying to Hawaii.</p>
<p>So I bought edibles.</p>
<p>And then right before I was gonna get on the plane,</p>
<p>I looked at my girlfriend and said, I&rsquo;m gonna relapse.</p>
<p>Oh, so you knew.</p>
<p>I knew.</p>
<p>So I got on the plane, I took it,</p>
<p>and then literally the last,</p>
<p>the next three months were like a blur.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you know?</p>
<p>Well, what gave you the sense that you&rsquo;re gonna relapse?</p>
<p>There was a couple of things that happened in my life</p>
<p>that were very shocking to me.</p>
<p>And I just, and I wasn&rsquo;t going to meetings</p>
<p>and I, you know, it&rsquo;s the same old story.</p>
<p>I was not connected to my sobriety brothers and sisters</p>
<p>and I was drifting away and I.</p>
<p>And something in your mind, it was just.</p>
<p>I just, the pain was too much.</p>
<p>So I did it.</p>
<p>And then, so what happened was now two and a half months in,</p>
<p>three months in, I started coughing up chunks of blood.</p>
<p>Right, so I was,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been a smoker since I was 17 years old, right?</p>
<p>And I was smoking so much weed and cigarettes</p>
<p>that I would just cough up blood.</p>
<p>But then simultaneously what happened was</p>
<p>Bob Sackett and Louie Anderson died, right?</p>
<p>And that week when I was coughing up blood</p>
<p>and because of, because I knew them, both of them,</p>
<p>I just in my head going, I&rsquo;m next.</p>
<p>Because to me, everything happens in threes.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;m like, and I had convinced myself</p>
<p>that I was gonna die and I was on the precipice of death.</p>
<p>And so I begged my people to put me</p>
<p>into this place in Arizona.</p>
<p>So, because I knew I needed to go</p>
<p>to a really rigorous psychology program</p>
<p>to get me out of where I was going through.</p>
<p>And also I was getting, at that time,</p>
<p>when I was in that hotel room,</p>
<p>I had not drank or even smoked a cigarette</p>
<p>or done drug in a week.</p>
<p>I had to wait in LA for this bed to open up, right?</p>
<p>So I was coughing up blood.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t slept, I hadn&rsquo;t eaten, right?</p>
<p>I was sober, but I was in so much pain.</p>
<p>And I slept naked by the door of this hotel room</p>
<p>because I thought it would be easier</p>
<p>for the maid to discover my body.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how fucked up I was.</p>
<p>I was just in this prison in my mind, you know?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m much better now.</p>
<p>Can you give some insights to how to get out of that place,</p>
<p>how you got out of that place?</p>
<p>I think getting sober, first of all, was very important,</p>
<p>but that still didn&rsquo;t do it completely.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I still was convinced that I was.</p>
<p>And then I went to this place and I did,</p>
<p>this place is a 12-hours-a-day psychotherapy place</p>
<p>where you do 12 hours, you see therapists all day long.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a 12-hour-long podcast every day?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But with professionals, and they call you on your shit,</p>
<p>and they tell you what&rsquo;s real, and they tell you,</p>
<p>you know what I mean, I&rsquo;m going,</p>
<p>also dealing with still my dad,</p>
<p>still some of these other things, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And the third thing that happened</p>
<p>was when I got back to LA after that place,</p>
<p>I got my lungs checked out, and I got my physical done,</p>
<p>and EKG, my heart, all of it, and I was completely fine.</p>
<p>And I quit smoking.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t smoked in almost four months.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t drank and done drugs since then, too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely a complete clarity.</p>
<p>And I have to also admit that this time around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just been completely different.</p>
<p>Is there still in the distance a fear of relapse</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Is that still?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So you feel good?</p>
<p>I feel great, yeah.</p>
<p>I feel better than I&rsquo;ve ever felt.</p>
<p>Even when hard shit happens?</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I no longer wanna be in that place.</p>
<p>And also, on top of it, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it would be a real shame,</p>
<p>because I worked so hard to get to this place in my life,</p>
<p>not just in my career, with all of it.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I have so much to lose.</p>
<p>I have so many people that love me.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to be there again, you know?</p>
<p>Let me ask you, sorry, you&rsquo;ve talked about this before,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Do you always wear a suit only for the podcast?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wear it in private, too.</p>
<p>Oh, you do?</p>
<p>Not always, no, because I get recognized, unfortunately,</p>
<p>so I have to be selective about how I wear.</p>
<p>Do you like it when being recognized, or no?</p>
<p>So because of podcasting, as you probably know,</p>
<p>the people that at least recognize me</p>
<p>happen to be amazing people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an immediate connection.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two things about that I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>So one, I fall in love with people,</p>
<p>and so the nature of interaction is like,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s gonna be short.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So you have to say goodbye, and I hate goodbyes.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then the other thing is just introversion.</p>
<p>I just, I&rsquo;m an introvert.</p>
<p>I have social anxiety.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nervous about talking to people, and so on, so.</p>
<p>So you have to always, I&rsquo;m walking around always</p>
<p>a little bit anxious that there&rsquo;ll be an interaction.</p>
<p>But ultimately, once it starts, it&rsquo;s fun, it&rsquo;s beautiful,</p>
<p>and then the goodbye is what hurts.</p>
<p>So both the hello and the goodbye is what hurts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the stuff in the middle that&rsquo;s delicious.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a beautiful thing, though,</p>
<p>for people like you and I, in a weird way,</p>
<p>because, number one, I don&rsquo;t know about you,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m an isolator.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really like any kind of social thing.</p>
<p>I like, even when I was doing drugs and drinking,</p>
<p>I never do it with people.</p>
<p>I do it privately in a garage, you know?</p>
<p>And secondly, you know, like I was,</p>
<p>my girlfriend and I watched The Northman,</p>
<p>the movie The Northman.</p>
<p>No, what is it?</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Tell me the plot line.</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t even heard of The Northman?</p>
<p>I have not heard of The Northman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Eggers.</p>
<p>He did a movie called The Witch.</p>
<p>He also did a movie called The Lighthouse.</p>
<p>You ever see The Lighthouse?</p>
<p>Okay, you watch movies?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never seen a movie?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen The Godfather.</p>
<p>Yeah, I bet your money you&rsquo;ve seen Dr. Zhivago.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You have?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, you like historical sweeping.</p>
<p>Schindler&rsquo;s List.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not historical or sweeping,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna like it.</p>
<p>All right, so how do I explain?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a Viking movie.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and one of the Skarsg√•rd,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Skarsg√•rd brothers is in it,</p>
<p>Bjork&rsquo;s in it, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a Viking revenge movie.</p>
<p>So why does it make you think about isolation?</p>
<p>No, because, no, what I was gonna say is</p>
<p>when we went to the movie theater, right,</p>
<p>afterwards, there was a kid sitting next to me,</p>
<p>and he just looks at me,</p>
<p>because I guess he didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I was sitting next to him or whatever,</p>
<p>and he just went, hey, dude,</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re sitting next to me,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re my hero,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing comedy, and it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>So I was able to give him some encouraging things,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s who I am, too, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I wanna help people,</p>
<p>and I also, you know, the idea that he likes me,</p>
<p>because he also spouted off specifics about my life,</p>
<p>about my comedy, and this and that,</p>
<p>so he definitely was a fan,</p>
<p>and I was able to, you know,</p>
<p>even if I become Joe Rogan famous or that big,</p>
<p>you know what I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always going to say hi to people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always gonna take photos with people.</p>
<p>I like that part of me.</p>
<p>It makes me feel also that I belong in a weird way,</p>
<p>because I felt so invisible before I did comedy.</p>
<p>You know what I mean, I felt invisible,</p>
<p>and it puts me in the game of life, I think,</p>
<p>in a weird way, you know?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s good for you, as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a little moment of experiencing love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it does feel like celebrating life together.</p>
<p>You smile at each other and so on.</p>
<p>Although you did say, I think in a recent podcast,</p>
<p>that, you know, people recognize you,</p>
<p>but recognize you incorrectly.</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the opposite of love.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, that I don&rsquo;t like, loved you in the hangover.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, or this is what I don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>this is why I hate this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Some guy will like me, right, I&rsquo;ll take a photo,</p>
<p>and then other people will go, huh, he&rsquo;s somebody,</p>
<p>and will walk up to me and go,</p>
<p>hey, so why did he take a photo?</p>
<p>You know what I mean, I want a photo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, no, would you do that?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>But I do like the experience where maybe there&rsquo;s a couple,</p>
<p>a guy and a girl, boyfriend and girlfriend,</p>
<p>and the guy is a fan, and the girlfriend has no idea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always a funny interaction.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because she&rsquo;s like trying to figure out</p>
<p>what is happening here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always beautiful to see.</p>
<p>But what if the guy, when the guy explains</p>
<p>to his girlfriend who you are,</p>
<p>do you feel uncomfortable about that?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It loads, the information is transferred quickly,</p>
<p>and she starts to understand,</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s not used to her boyfriend</p>
<p>being excited about a stranger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s happening here?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a fascinating little dynamic that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the spread of information happens right there</p>
<p>in real life, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly though, would you say that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably usually men that recognize you, or?</p>
<p>No, but men, the thing I&rsquo;ve discovered is</p>
<p>men are more likely to approach aggressively, right?</p>
<p>Women recognize you, they have a different way</p>
<p>of like double take.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to invade your space.</p>
<p>Guys are like, bro.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>They come in with a hug.</p>
<p>I had a, South by Southwest,</p>
<p>had a guy, I was just walking to a 7-Eleven,</p>
<p>I go to a 7-Eleven a lot, my favorite spot.</p>
<p>7-Eleven?</p>
<p>7-Eleven, yes.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Sugar-free slushie, I think, for happiness.</p>
<p>I like, I find happiness at a 7-Eleven.</p>
<p>So adorable.</p>
<p>Late at night.</p>
<p>And he came up and, you know what?</p>
<p>Can I tell you something that happened to me?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t told anybody.</p>
<p>This never happened to me before.</p>
<p>I was outside of a 7-Eleven in Austin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say which one,</p>
<p>and there was a gentleman that approached me,</p>
<p>this was at three or four at night,</p>
<p>which is usually when I go, I program all night,</p>
<p>and I just like to go and take a break.</p>
<p>He approached me in the way that maybe somebody</p>
<p>who recognized me approached me.</p>
<p>He did a double take, he walked past me,</p>
<p>and then walked back, and then looked at me,</p>
<p>and I went into the 7-Eleven, I thought, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>And then I came out with my slushie,</p>
<p>and then he approached me,</p>
<p>and he said, can I give you a blowjob?</p>
<p>So I have never.</p>
<p>I have never.</p>
<p>No, really?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the energy he put, I&rsquo;ve never had.</p>
<p>Were you wearing a suit?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I was wearing sweatpants,</p>
<p>and I was very hiding from the world type of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had anybody approach me that way,</p>
<p>but the energy he put, the love he had in the approach,</p>
<p>I thought he would be like.</p>
<p>Love you on Rogan?</p>
<p>Yeah, love, yeah.</p>
<p>Something like love, some kind of,</p>
<p>and then he just said, can I,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m forgetting the exact wording,</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t, the wording was such</p>
<p>that he wasn&rsquo;t, he wanted to make me happy.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to make himself happy,</p>
<p>he wanted to make me happy.</p>
<p>I forgot, can I give you a blowjob?</p>
<p>I think that was the thing.</p>
<p>Because if he said, can you give me a blowjob,</p>
<p>it would be very different.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, but I think there&rsquo;s a more aggressive way</p>
<p>of phrasing that, but he presented himself.</p>
<p>See, I forget, it was almost like gentle and poetic,</p>
<p>and I was like, I just stuttered and said,</p>
<p>no, no, thank you.</p>
<p>Moved past.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what everyone does.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No thank you to a blowjob proposition.</p>
<p>Well, no, I would probably stutter,</p>
<p>no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, thank you.</p>
<p>In my mind, I was like, is this a threat?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s Fortnite.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never experienced this.</p>
<p>I imagine this is what sort of women often experience,</p>
<p>that kind of the danger,</p>
<p>the constant threat all around you.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never, this just, it was a funny little moment.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That happened, and I go to that 7-Eleven often</p>
<p>looking for the guy.</p>
<p>Because now, now I would say yes, no.</p>
<p>There used to be a steam room in Beverly,</p>
<p>on Beverly Boulevard,</p>
<p>and my brother and I walked in there once,</p>
<p>and we walked in, and there was a man sitting there,</p>
<p>erection, and his dick was so big,</p>
<p>he was jerking it off with both hands.</p>
<p>And we kind of walked in, and he goes, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>And he just did it.</p>
<p>Kept going.</p>
<p>And we just sat there, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because it was not aggressive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe that was the same feeling.</p>
<p>You sensed that it wasn&rsquo;t an aggressive thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It was just a kind, he was just minding his own business,</p>
<p>and he threw it out.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t also, it wasn&rsquo;t sexual either.</p>
<p>It was like, it was like, it&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s like love or something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I felt like, it&rsquo;s almost like, can I give you a hug?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Then why don&rsquo;t you just take it?</p>
<p>I keep looking for it.</p>
<p>Next time I see it, but not in a gay way.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I just wanted to be clear about that.</p>
<p>Did you grow up in Russia or Ukraine?</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But your great-grandmother, your grandmother was in-</p>
<p>My father is Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Oh, your father is Ukrainian.</p>
<p>My grandmother is Ukrainian,</p>
<p>so if you just look at the full family tree,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about half and half is Russian.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of conflict with you right now.</p>
<p>Internally, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask, you&rsquo;ve talked about this before,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to sort of re-explore this,</p>
<p>is Carlos Mencia.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why go there again?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to do it, but do you like Carlos?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I&rsquo;m friends with Joe,</p>
<p>and I remember being a fan of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m outside of this whole world.</p>
<p>I remember thinking Carlos was funny.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So just as a fan, I was like, oh, funny.</p>
<p>I remember all this big controversy</p>
<p>about him stealing jokes,</p>
<p>and because I&rsquo;m a fan of yours,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such an interesting human dynamic,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a fan of friendship and loyalty,</p>
<p>and you had a great podcast conversation with him.</p>
<p>It was tense.</p>
<p>It was so tense.</p>
<p>It was very tense.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it was interesting,</p>
<p>and it kinda, well, it makes me think of you</p>
<p>talking to your father on that bench.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it, yeah, that&rsquo;s essentially what it was.</p>
<p>Some of it wasn&rsquo;t getting through,</p>
<p>but maybe, how do you feel about that whole thing,</p>
<p>about the guy?</p>
<p>I mean, he gave you, he&rsquo;s a friend.</p>
<p>He gave you a lot,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also a comedian,</p>
<p>so stealing jokes is no good,</p>
<p>but also there&rsquo;s like a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, all the tensions in your heart</p>
<p>about all that whole thing.</p>
<p>How do you feel about it?</p>
<p>Do you forgive him?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s just, let&rsquo;s go back to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very Shakespearean in a very weird way, why?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s some betrayal there.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of drama when it comes to that situation.</p>
<p>Again, also, I&rsquo;m a very loyal guy.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve had the same manager since the late 90s,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve had every gigantic manager wanna sign me,</p>
<p>even though my manager is great, right?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in a big company, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only so much she can do,</p>
<p>and maybe, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>My career would have been different</p>
<p>if I would have signed with a bigger management.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>But I will never leave her, you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never leave my agent, Matt, you know?</p>
<p>People go, well, you&rsquo;re at CAA, that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>The only reason why I&rsquo;m at CAA is because of Matt Blake,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>So there are certain loyalties that I have.</p>
<p>The Comedy Store, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, I generally play the Comedy Store mostly</p>
<p>because my loyalties are with them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a good trait,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just the way I am, right?</p>
<p>I admire that, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so when it comes to Carlos,</p>
<p>you know, in the mid-90s is when I met him.</p>
<p>I was a doorman at the La Jolla Comedy Store.</p>
<p>He brought me on the road.</p>
<p>He introduced me to Matt Blake, my agent, right?</p>
<p>And he bought me a car, you know?</p>
<p>When I couldn&rsquo;t pay rent, you know,</p>
<p>and I was really desperate,</p>
<p>I could always go to him for money, you know?</p>
<p>And he helped me out in so many different ways, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>Pauly did the same thing.</p>
<p>So anyway, and then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>and I always knew going on the road with him</p>
<p>that number one, I found it odd</p>
<p>that he never had a notebook, you know?</p>
<p>Usually, you know, comics riff with each other</p>
<p>and they write things down, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Me, I&rsquo;ll get together with people and write,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a new joke night because I&rsquo;m too scared</p>
<p>to try it in front of a packed room</p>
<p>or whatever it might be, okay?</p>
<p>He never did that, right?</p>
<p>And he had hours of material.</p>
<p>And, you know, a lot of it was derivative of other people&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He would sometimes hear a bit, change it to Mexican.</p>
<p>Like for instance, you know,</p>
<p>if Paul Mooney had a joke about black people,</p>
<p>he would change it, change it a bit.</p>
<p>But premise wise, it was always extremely too similar.</p>
<p>And there were examples on the internet.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s things that you can&rsquo;t really deny.</p>
<p>And so when that whole thing happened,</p>
<p>you know, it was like the Titanic.</p>
<p>I mean, I was either gonna sink with Carlos or survive.</p>
<p>And I did the worst, not the worst thing,</p>
<p>but I had made a difficult decision</p>
<p>and my decision was to cut ties.</p>
<p>And, you know, over the years,</p>
<p>I have felt very guilty about it in some respects,</p>
<p>but, you know, there is always in my mind,</p>
<p>I wanna help him, you know?</p>
<p>I wanna help him reestablish</p>
<p>some sort of a different, you know,</p>
<p>route for him to go in terms of his career and whatnot.</p>
<p>And so I had him on my podcast</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t go the way I wanted it to go.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, I&rsquo;ve always believed</p>
<p>if he just fully just was apologetic and said,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m sorry for stealing in general,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t know specifically,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s specifics, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna argue every case, you know?</p>
<p>So I thought the healthiest thing to do</p>
<p>was like in just in a broad way,</p>
<p>listen, I stole, I&rsquo;m so sorry,</p>
<p>these are the reasons why,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a different guy now,</p>
<p>but it just never happened in that way.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been difficult.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think he self-reflected looking in the mirror</p>
<p>about mistakes of the past at all?</p>
<p>Like, do you think he&rsquo;s aware?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s ego.</p>
<p>You know, I think that he,</p>
<p>for one reason or another,</p>
<p>because there are probably jokes</p>
<p>that he legitimately in his heart know that he wrote,</p>
<p>that people are accusing of stealing, right?</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s like, we don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, just apologize for all of it, right?</p>
<p>But he won&rsquo;t, he fights for every, you know, every point.</p>
<p>And, you know, I just think that that&rsquo;s not the route.</p>
<p>And he, I mean, he&rsquo;s always gonna make money.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, you know, but he&rsquo;s never gonna be what he should be,</p>
<p>which is, he&rsquo;s a powerful performer,</p>
<p>you know, in terms of laughs.</p>
<p>I mean, dude, I wouldn&rsquo;t wanna follow him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a crusher, you know?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s really, he can act.</p>
<p>He has all the skillsets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that, to me, he went about it in the wrong way,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sad to me.</p>
<p>But I still always love him,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve always will thank him</p>
<p>for all the help that he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>So you still got room in your heart for him?</p>
<p>I have room for my heart for a lot of people, man.</p>
<p>You know, Hitler.</p>
<p>All right, what was, returning back to Tiger Belly,</p>
<p>because you said Kalilah basically started it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the origin story of Tiger Belly?</p>
<p>You know, when I met her.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, for people listening,</p>
<p>in case you somehow don&rsquo;t know Tiger Belly is a podcast,</p>
<p>you do, it&rsquo;s an amazing podcast.</p>
<p>You also do Bad Friends with Andrew Santino.</p>
<p>Yeah. So on.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the plug.</p>
<p>Appreciate it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s content, it&rsquo;s not the plug.</p>
<p>Can I plug other things, though, since we&rsquo;re doing it?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>Oh, what&rsquo;s your?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a show called Red River.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s enough of that.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the name of the show you&rsquo;re on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a couple.</p>
<p>A couple shows?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s good for you.</p>
<p>Netflix?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on Sex and the City.</p>
<p>Sex and the City.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on Reservation Dogs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an FX show.</p>
<p>Wait, Sex and the City is not a joke?</p>
<p>No, I am actually on Sex and the City.</p>
<p>Wait, are they rebooting the show?</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called And Just Like That, Sex and the City.</p>
<p>Oh, and you&rsquo;re on it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is this not a joke?</p>
<p>You can Google it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Who do you play?</p>
<p>I play a podcaster on it.</p>
<p>On the show, Sarah Jessica Parker&rsquo;s Carrie has a podcast,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m her podcast partner.</p>
<p>Oh, got it.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also, now they&rsquo;ve, my storyline,</p>
<p>anyway, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Do you sleep with somebody on there?</p>
<p>I am married on the show.</p>
<p>Yeah, they showed my, I&rsquo;m married to a young lady on it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It felt like a joke.</p>
<p>I know, because you don&rsquo;t think doing it,</p>
<p>I look around going, are you sure I&rsquo;m supposed to be on this?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I do feel that, but lo and behold, I&rsquo;m on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you are.</p>
<p>I started this way.</p>
<p>My friend, David Cho, do you know him?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an artist.</p>
<p>He used to have a podcast, right, called DVD ASA,</p>
<p>and he used to have me on it,</p>
<p>and then Kalilah started doing it,</p>
<p>and then when DVD ASA ended,</p>
<p>Kalilah was just like, let&rsquo;s start our own,</p>
<p>and I was like, nah, it&rsquo;s not gonna work.</p>
<p>So she goes, well, fine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna just do it on my own then.</p>
<p>So she went and bought the equipment,</p>
<p>and we were living in a condo at the time in Hollywood,</p>
<p>and she would do them on her own.</p>
<p>She did probably three on her own,</p>
<p>and one day I was watching television.</p>
<p>The door was open to the podcast room,</p>
<p>and I looked, turned around,</p>
<p>and she was literally like this.</p>
<p>We had a table like this.</p>
<p>She had the mic and all that stuff,</p>
<p>and she was doing this.</p>
<p>She was slumped over like this,</p>
<p>and I just kind of went, fuck it.</p>
<p>So I walked in there, I go, all right, let&rsquo;s just do one,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how it started.</p>
<p>And then chemistry was there immediately.</p>
<p>Well, I already knew that she could do it</p>
<p>because of DVD ASA, right?</p>
<p>So I already knew that she had the skillset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s just all about,</p>
<p>even in this conversation that you and I had today,</p>
<p>there are gaps of like, oh,</p>
<p>what else should we talk about, right?</p>
<p>Or like, I don&rsquo;t know what direction, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all about the old improv rule, adding information.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re gonna say,</p>
<p>just fill the dead space with something.</p>
<p>Like, so if right now, if we had,</p>
<p>we stopped talking about something, I&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>like when I asked you,</p>
<p>did you grow up in Russia or Ukraine, right,</p>
<p>was one of those dead spaces where I was just like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just throw it out there, see where this goes, right?</p>
<p>And she has that ability to fill that dead space</p>
<p>with information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you need, right?</p>
<p>And she gets it in that way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like when we, you know, started doing it at DVDSA,</p>
<p>I just knew that she had the skillset.</p>
<p>So when we started doing it for Tiger Belly,</p>
<p>it was a given, you know, you know, she can do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had girlfriends that wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>You know, you have the skillset.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re a science-y guy.</p>
<p>You spend all night long, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>You know, doing whatever you&rsquo;re fucking doing, right?</p>
<p>But you have this innate ability to do it, right?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a talent.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a talent?</p>
<p>No, do you think you have talent?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re doing, not adding information.</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re doing, that&rsquo;s a good bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good bit.</p>
<p>I kept doing it and you kept filling the space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is true, huh?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re yes-ending yourself, which is great.</p>
<p>The improv thing, that was really impressive.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a guest on that didn&rsquo;t add information</p>
<p>and then you had to keep doing it?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but it&rsquo;s part of the magic too.</p>
<p>And sometimes I feel like they were actually giving me</p>
<p>a gift of silence and I was stepping on it.</p>
<p>Like for example, I had a conversation with Jocko,</p>
<p>Jocko Willink, and every question I would ask him</p>
<p>in the beginning, and I&rsquo;m now better friends with him.</p>
<p>It was the first time we met in that conversation.</p>
<p>And I would ask him these long questions</p>
<p>of mumble and meander and so on.</p>
<p>And he would answer with yes or no, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;d do it in a strong, Viking-like way.</p>
<p>And I kept trying to go full,</p>
<p>Bobby Lee style of create chaos</p>
<p>and just keep talking and talking and so on.</p>
<p>As opposed to, I think he was inviting me</p>
<p>more for the stoic type of silence,</p>
<p>short sentences, that kind of conversation.</p>
<p>So I fucked that up, I believe.</p>
<p>But yeah, not the adding information part,</p>
<p>but the adding chemistry part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually ego, where people don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a magic to be found between two humans.</p>
<p>Like genuinely, it&rsquo;s like a first date.</p>
<p>That to truly listen to each other</p>
<p>and to do the yes and thing and have fun with it.</p>
<p>When you have this energy, I&rsquo;m way too important</p>
<p>for this conversation that, yeah,</p>
<p>the information might be there, but the chemistry&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So you have to remember that a lot of the podcasts</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done are technical.</p>
<p>And so you could still say a lot of stuff</p>
<p>about what this project or whether it&rsquo;s physics</p>
<p>or robotics or biology, you could say informational stuff,</p>
<p>but the excitement, the magic is not there.</p>
<p>But I often blame myself because if I&rsquo;m excited,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be excited I&rsquo;ve learned this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m learning I&rsquo;m not allowed to have a bored face,</p>
<p>which my face naturally looks bored,</p>
<p>but on the inside, I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>So it might be a Russian thing, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Can I tell you why you&rsquo;re not boring?</p>
<p>Your face?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because you have crow&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Oh, this thing?</p>
<p>Yeah. Is that what the thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the reason why you have crow&rsquo;s feet</p>
<p>is you smile a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re very expressive.</p>
<p>I know white dudes, I don&rsquo;t trust white dudes, right,</p>
<p>with no crow&rsquo;s feet, right?</p>
<p>Because that means that they&rsquo;re not accessing</p>
<p>that part of their, you know what I mean, face.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is why I hate when,</p>
<p>this is an LA thing especially,</p>
<p>women have talked to me about Botox,</p>
<p>and they hate the crow,</p>
<p>they hate, not me, on themselves.</p>
<p>And they hate it because it&rsquo;s all wrinkles</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s like, no, that&rsquo;s where the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the magic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the magic, it really is, yeah.</p>
<p>So, okay, so the interesting thing about Tiger Belly</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s some weird aesthetic to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really unique, it&rsquo;s not just good, it&rsquo;s also unique.</p>
<p>Like in the way that Wes Anderson films are unique,</p>
<p>like Life Aquatic, I don&rsquo;t know if you know those films.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love those.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re my favorite films, yeah.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the chemistry between you and Koala,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, what is that?</p>
<p>Can you put a finger on it, or is it just like?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s essentially who I am.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my, all my houses have looked like that.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a collector of designer toys.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a collector of kind of weird artwork.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve always been like that.</p>
<p>You know, I like weird wallpaper.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll get, instead of like going to a wallpaper store,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;ll do is I&rsquo;ll get artwork that I like</p>
<p>from an artist, like, and go get the, you know,</p>
<p>get their approval, and go to a place</p>
<p>and make wallpaper out of their artwork.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like if I wanted a Lex Friedman, your face on my wall,</p>
<p>I would ask for your permission,</p>
<p>and I would probably put your face on a gigantic wall.</p>
<p>Like I would do stuff like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I.</p>
<p>Can you do that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You have my permission.</p>
<p>You know, I think I will.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I think I will just for the laugh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>But I would do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get it big, please.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, but my point is that I,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s essentially who I am on the inside, I guess,</p>
<p>in terms of like my, you know,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really, I&rsquo;ve never,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you said that,</p>
<p>because I never even thought about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just who you are.</p>
<p>You know, you just kind of do it,</p>
<p>like this, you know,</p>
<p>because all your podcasts have this black, ominous thing.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wearing a black suit.</p>
<p>You have a specific thing, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t really think,</p>
<p>people ask me like, why do you wear a suit?</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I just feel good in it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just who I am.</p>
<p>My podcast looks the way I do</p>
<p>is because I feel comfortable in that environment.</p>
<p>And it, you know, like you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t try to think too much about</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing on Tiger Belly,</p>
<p>or even Bad Friends, right?</p>
<p>Because when you start thinking about it,</p>
<p>and go, we should do this segment,</p>
<p>and I should, you know, do it this way,</p>
<p>or this podcast does it this way,</p>
<p>so why, you know.</p>
<p>No, I just show up,</p>
<p>I keep my mind open,</p>
<p>and I do the best I can.</p>
<p>I add information like we talked about,</p>
<p>and I just keep talking, right?</p>
<p>And I try to be authentically myself.</p>
<p>Like right now, you know,</p>
<p>I had this fear when I was,</p>
<p>I was, I shit in your fucking bathroom, man.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because I was so scared.</p>
<p>Out of fear, you shit out of fear.</p>
<p>Out of fear, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And like, you know, I was like kind of nervous,</p>
<p>because I, you know, this whole week,</p>
<p>it was anticipating coming here,</p>
<p>and I watched the Mark Normand one,</p>
<p>I watched the Giannis one to see,</p>
<p>you know, how tonally.</p>
<p>And last night, my girlfriend just looked at me</p>
<p>and just goes, just show up.</p>
<p>Yeah, Kalala knows who I am.</p>
<p>Dude, you think that, first of all,</p>
<p>let me ask you something.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You think I have the day,</p>
<p>you know how busy I am,</p>
<p>to drive all the way over here to West Hollywood?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To do your fucking thing?</p>
<p>Why would I do that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because we are well aware of who you are,</p>
<p>and we like you.</p>
<p>Thank you, man.</p>
<p>God, and we want you on ours.</p>
<p>I would love that, I would love that,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m doing this,</p>
<p>is just to get on your podcast.</p>
<p>You gotta get on it.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>because I just mentioned to you offline,</p>
<p>I got a chance to talk to Oliver Stone,</p>
<p>and he asked me this thing,</p>
<p>which is, you know, how many listeners does this thing get?</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even pay attention to that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I just don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>A little bit though you do?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I wrote extensions of my browsers</p>
<p>where I don&rsquo;t see the views, the number of views.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t pay attention.</p>
<p>Did you know that some of your YouTube videos</p>
<p>on interviews and stuff have over a million?</p>
<p>That I know.</p>
<p>I know loosely that it bleeds through,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not part of my conscious thing I think about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very, I&rsquo;ve just seen it destroy people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re no longer thinking creatively,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not, they don&rsquo;t feel good</p>
<p>if something they do doesn&rsquo;t get as much attention</p>
<p>as they thought it should.</p>
<p>It just can destroy you, even though it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>There could be great stuff you create</p>
<p>that nobody, everybody ignores.</p>
<p>But it was still great.</p>
<p>It is still great.</p>
<p>And sort of letting that negatively affect your mind</p>
<p>is a, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve seen it destroy people,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m very nervous about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that old saying, never live in the results.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if I podcast to make,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like initially, honestly, when I did Tigerbilly,</p>
<p>we made no money for the first couple of years.</p>
<p>Like not enough to put a dent,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t buy anything nice or anything.</p>
<p>It was just side money, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>I could buy some shoes once a month or whatever, right?</p>
<p>And like I said before, my career was in the shitter, right?</p>
<p>So Tigerbilly wasn&rsquo;t like, this is gonna be the thing,</p>
<p>it was just something to do</p>
<p>with my girlfriend creatively, you know?</p>
<p>And it just so happens that it did do</p>
<p>all these things for me, right, podcasting.</p>
<p>But yeah, I never, and still today,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do it for any of those things.</p>
<p>I do it because it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It is, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, since you say why you love Kalilah,</p>
<p>why do you love slash hate George Kimmel, your producer?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite thing about him, let&rsquo;s say that.</p>
<p>Positive thing, positive.</p>
<p>Oh God, I&rsquo;ve never been asked this question.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t want to give him compliments,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>Have you actually, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve publicly</p>
<p>ever said anything positive about George Kimmel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have either, so I&rsquo;m gonna give it a go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give it a real go here.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, when it comes to money,</p>
<p>when it comes to responsibility,</p>
<p>obviously this is a business now for you and me.</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s a side business, but it&rsquo;s a business.</p>
<p>And you want to be able to trust the people</p>
<p>that are running it.</p>
<p>And I have 100% trust in everything that he does</p>
<p>in terms of financial things, in terms of technical things,</p>
<p>in terms of all of it, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Merchandise, and I have 100% belief in him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s rare, to find someone like that.</p>
<p>Also, at the end of the day, I know his heart,</p>
<p>and he really is a great guy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing about him.</p>
<p>Like for instance, he was over the other day,</p>
<p>and I go, I bought this key wooden thing</p>
<p>that some native man made,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how to put it on the wall.</p>
<p>So I just, you know, I go, hey, can you figure this out?</p>
<p>And he goes, yeah, I got it.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s just that guy, you know?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also, but there is a part of me,</p>
<p>and this is probably wrong,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a part of me that feels like I kind of made him.</p>
<p>Yeah, he would be nothing without you.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the way I heard it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I meant.</p>
<p>Okay, but that&rsquo;s not what you said.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably wrong, right?</p>
<p>Because he did all the things that he has in his life,</p>
<p>he did on his own, right?</p>
<p>But still, for some reason-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be nothing without you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying, but that&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So basically, like, because when I met him,</p>
<p>I was a part of this YouTube studio called Maker Studios,</p>
<p>and he was just a producer there,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how I met him.</p>
<p>And when he left Maker, he came to us,</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t a podcast producer,</p>
<p>and now he has this big company.</p>
<p>He produces a bunch of podcasts,</p>
<p>and he has a bunch of employees,</p>
<p>and he has a nice business,</p>
<p>and I feel like I had a lot to do with it.</p>
<p>So both the competence and the good heart.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about Gilbert?</p>
<p>Yeah, Gilbert is a godsend as well.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if, because of, let me ask you this,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a science guy,</p>
<p>this is an interesting question for me.</p>
<p>Do you believe just that the universe</p>
<p>gives you certain things at the right moment,</p>
<p>at the right time?</p>
<p>Do you believe that there is a mechanism out there</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just, we&rsquo;re just a part of this machine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of like, almost as if things</p>
<p>are just happening the way it&rsquo;s supposed to happen?</p>
<p>Or do you think there&rsquo;s just these random things</p>
<p>that are occurring, and we&rsquo;re just, it&rsquo;s chaos in that way?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know from a science perspective,</p>
<p>because I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to explain it,</p>
<p>but I do believe, you mentioned karma,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a karma thing.</p>
<p>It just, if you put love out there in the world,</p>
<p>like certain doors open in a certain kind of way,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re almost waiting for you,</p>
<p>and then you walk through them.</p>
<p>So yes, in that way, I believe that it just,</p>
<p>it feels like not everything is like a basic</p>
<p>like billiard ball model of like,</p>
<p>you have to fight for everything.</p>
<p>You could just generally be cool to people,</p>
<p>and kind to people, and certain opportunities</p>
<p>just pop up at the right moment.</p>
<p>But more specifically, though, so for instance,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s suppose, like Gilbert, for instance,</p>
<p>he just showed up at my house one day.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know who he was.</p>
<p>I had a fight night, and a friend brought him.</p>
<p>This is right when Kalilah and I</p>
<p>were starting Tigerbelly, right?</p>
<p>And in conversation, he was like,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know how to engineer.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have an engineer for our podcast.</p>
<p>And that night, he was like, you know,</p>
<p>I know how to do it, right?</p>
<p>And if I hadn&rsquo;t met him that night, he just wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it would be as good.</p>
<p>It would be completely different.</p>
<p>And I really believe that we met him that night for a reason.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>I believe that for love and these kinds of things,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t believe that as much for building a team.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the engineering thing.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the artist in you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m less of an artist.</p>
<p>I think artists thrive in the chaos of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not only that you guys met at that time,</p>
<p>is you didn&rsquo;t probably ask in detail</p>
<p>about his qualifications,</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t go through a rigorous thing.</p>
<p>You just dove in and figured it out on the fly.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s sort of the artist ethic.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re doing a startup or engineering,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit more rigor in the selection process.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>I see what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Because the same with Rogan, Jamie just walked up to him.</p>
<p>Jamie Vernon.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know Jamie, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, he just walked up in the same kind of situation.</p>
<p>And then he made it, you know,</p>
<p>both of you have one of the best podcasts in the world.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, how did that, what?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I believe that-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very strange.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s strange.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s just like cool people</p>
<p>hang out with cool people.</p>
<p>So you kind of collide a lot.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true because they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Because with Bad Friends, for instance, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had 12 people before Andrew Santino</p>
<p>that had asked me to do one with me, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, they just wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t, didn&rsquo;t want to do it, you know?</p>
<p>With Andrew though, it happened kind of organically</p>
<p>and in a way that was almost like,</p>
<p>in my heart, meant to happen in a weird way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird combination, by the way.</p>
<p>So why did, why was that the sticky one?</p>
<p>Because you have a lot of comedian friends.</p>
<p>Why Andrew?</p>
<p>Because number one, we both know just instinctually,</p>
<p>without even talking about it,</p>
<p>that in many ways we&rsquo;re polar opposites</p>
<p>in terms of like energy, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s more aggressive.</p>
<p>I also know I respond good with alpha males,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m more of a follower, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Or sensitive in that way.</p>
<p>But in many ways, I am an alpha male</p>
<p>in certain areas of my life, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know, when it comes to Smashing Dot, what&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But, you know, so we both knew instinctually</p>
<p>that in that way our chemistry worked, right?</p>
<p>And also in terms of style and all that stuff</p>
<p>is completely just, it was just an organic given to us.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>But you trust yourself with power?</p>
<p>You play dictators.</p>
<p>What do you mean, do I?</p>
<p>Because I feel like you would be,</p>
<p>because you said you&rsquo;re not an alpha male.</p>
<p>But in many ways, when you smash what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>and you winked at me, what do you think about that?</p>
<p>If I give you absolute power, would you be able to,</p>
<p>what would you, how would you change?</p>
<p>What does absolute power mean?</p>
<p>Like you said to me, listen,</p>
<p>you are gonna be the dictator of planet Earth</p>
<p>and anything that you want is at your means?</p>
<p>Yeah, including violence, sex.</p>
<p>No, I would not.</p>
<p>Because even in my personal life now,</p>
<p>there are things that I could do, right?</p>
<p>That I have power, I guess, that I don&rsquo;t participate in.</p>
<p>Right, so why would I do it if I had ultimate power?</p>
<p>I mean, because there&rsquo;s always,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a moral and ethics that I have, right?</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with, right?</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t even enjoy it.</p>
<p>No, I mean, I think that there would be no,</p>
<p>if I had ultimate dictatorship on planet Earth,</p>
<p>there would be no violence.</p>
<p>I mean, I would not cause any wars, right?</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s an uprising, I&rsquo;d have to quell it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it starts, Bobby.</p>
<p>You quell it with a bit of a.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t uprise.</p>
<p>Right, but, so first you&rsquo;re gonna censor everybody</p>
<p>who wants to even suggest the idea of uprising.</p>
<p>And then one person gets out of line,</p>
<p>they run a red light, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you ever get angry in traffic?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I get rageful.</p>
<p>So if you could murder that person.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Nobody has to know.</p>
<p>No, I would give them cancer.</p>
<p>But I would not murder them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so much worse.</p>
<p>I would not.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, but here, no, this is an interesting thing</p>
<p>because I wanna elaborate.</p>
<p>All right, so the thing,</p>
<p>if I was the dictator of the planet Earth, right?</p>
<p>There would be a reason why people would uprise, right?</p>
<p>So give me a reason.</p>
<p>Because I would give them food, shelter, right?</p>
<p>And all the things I feel like people would desire, right?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, because you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think this is what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>So there are certain things that I do believe in, right?</p>
<p>Like for instance, it&rsquo;s a very controversial thing, right?</p>
<p>In terms of a woman&rsquo;s right, right?</p>
<p>In terms of abortion, right?</p>
<p>I feel like as a male, it&rsquo;s not my body,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t really even have an opinion</p>
<p>or I shouldn&rsquo;t even have a voice on it.</p>
<p>Because, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if they created laws,</p>
<p>if white people, men, created laws for Koreans in America.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t have the right to, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, so if I was a dictator, right?</p>
<p>I would just be like, yeah,</p>
<p>women have all the rights in the world, right?</p>
<p>And I think abortion should be legal</p>
<p>throughout the planet Earth, right?</p>
<p>But there will be people out there</p>
<p>that will believe that, no, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re pro-life.</p>
<p>So you would put them in jail just so.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So I think as a dictator,</p>
<p>there was no way to be able to please everyone.</p>
<p>So there will be an uprising.</p>
<p>So yeah, fuck it, I don&rsquo;t wanna do it.</p>
<p>Would you do it?</p>
<p>Uh, not, no.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several loaded questions.</p>
<p>Would I enjoy it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Would I do it?</p>
<p>No, because I don&rsquo;t trust my own mind under power.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m well aware that in situations where I have control,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as much a freedom as it is a burden.</p>
<p>Like it can change you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very nervous about that.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>How much the ego starts to flare up,</p>
<p>how much just like the less pleasant things</p>
<p>about your nature come up.</p>
<p>You know, I have a temper too.</p>
<p>Like I have all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And you have, I&rsquo;m sure you have a bit of a temper.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a temper, yeah.</p>
<p>And so when nobody&rsquo;s able to as clearly call you out</p>
<p>on your bullshit, that could be a problem.</p>
<p>Do you have this when you rage out and you have a temper,</p>
<p>is there like either a day later or a couple hours later,</p>
<p>is there a shame and regret that comes along with that</p>
<p>or no?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, no, no, of course, yeah.</p>
<p>During it.</p>
<p>Yeah, during it too, yeah, shame and regret.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I try to make sure it&rsquo;s like love and respect</p>
<p>are felt always underneath the whole thing.</p>
<p>But still, it&rsquo;s like human emotion.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t control it.</p>
<p>And if you give an absolute power,</p>
<p>you start to lose your sense of the world.</p>
<p>You start to be unable to see what is right and wrong.</p>
<p>You think everything is right.</p>
<p>You start to have a distorted view</p>
<p>of who is doing the wrong things in the world.</p>
<p>And then also distrust.</p>
<p>Well, that has to do more with how absolute power</p>
<p>is usually attained.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re in the seat of power,</p>
<p>everybody, first on the outside,</p>
<p>but then in your inner circle, you start to distrust them.</p>
<p>You start to believe that they&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>they want your power.</p>
<p>So the people you love,</p>
<p>the people that were source of so much beauty</p>
<p>for you previously, like even like your girlfriend, wife,</p>
<p>your closest lifelong friends, you start to suspect them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to live like that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re often right to suspect them.</p>
<p>Because you think they change a little bit too.</p>
<p>They change too.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>They start to get a little bit taste of that power.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is a bunch of people</p>
<p>in Hitler&rsquo;s inner circle at the very end</p>
<p>betrayed him in search of their own power.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, this power thing.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions real quick.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If you could be someone else for a day,</p>
<p>someone alive today who you haven&rsquo;t yet met,</p>
<p>who would you be?</p>
<p>For one day, you get to be, it could be female, male.</p>
<p>There have to be a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to see what a pop star was like.</p>
<p>Which one would you go?</p>
<p>Like Harry Styles.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Harry Styles, right?</p>
<p>I just want to see what it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>to go to the Beverly Center.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>As Harry Styles.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Or Coachella.</p>
<p>Just walk around Coachella as Harry Styles.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>But you get a lot of attention.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very specific kind of attention.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just want to see what that&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>I want to be able to,</p>
<p>because the thing is that I want to be able to see</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like in terms of how easy would it be</p>
<p>to get a hot chick.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you meant to get a table at a restaurant.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>That, you know, I can still do now as Bobby Lee,</p>
<p>you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But as Harry Styles, I want to see what it&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>and how that would go about,</p>
<p>like how easy it would be.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Could you just walk up to the hottest chick at Coachella</p>
<p>and start making out with them?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Just to see.</p>
<p>Just to see if you could.</p>
<p>Test the system.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because I know as Bobby Lee, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Could you?</p>
<p>No, you couldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Uh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting reason.</p>
<p>So if you were the last person on earth,</p>
<p>like everybody disappeared, everybody&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>What would your day look like?</p>
<p>What would your days look like?</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting because if I was able to figure out</p>
<p>the, you know, electricity,</p>
<p>I think my days would be like,</p>
<p>God, why didn&rsquo;t you learn about electricity?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You realize how little you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you learn about these things?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>Yeah, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I think the first thing obviously is,</p>
<p>no, let me ask you something.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re saying that I&rsquo;m the last person</p>
<p>on planet earth because there was an alien invasion</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s predators and things</p>
<p>that I have to fucking look out for, that&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m just all of a sudden I wake up</p>
<p>and just everyone&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>No, everyone&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no threat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no threat.</p>
<p>Then what I would do is I go,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s find a place to live.</p>
<p>Not probably my house, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d probably live in a place</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s closest to grocery stores, right?</p>
<p>So I would get food and stuff first, right?</p>
<p>And then secondly, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably go, you know what I thought about?</p>
<p>I would probably go to San Marcos, San Diego Vista</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where the real doll factory is.</p>
<p>And just fuck all of them?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I would have to grab like six of them</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m gonna get lonely.</p>
<p>Six of them for a variety.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be monogamous with one doll?</p>
<p>No, and I also would carry out like the,</p>
<p>the vagina parts, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>And all the accessories and stuff, right?</p>
<p>And then go back to LA probably.</p>
<p>Oh man, why do I stay down there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stay down there.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could stay in the factory.</p>
<p>No, yeah, maybe the stat factory.</p>
<p>And then, but I think thirdly,</p>
<p>I would run out of electricity, right?</p>
<p>And I think, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>My demise would come slowly.</p>
<p>Well, you could find sources of electricity</p>
<p>because nobody&rsquo;s using it.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know how to turn the machines on.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know how to go to the fucking,</p>
<p>what do you call it?</p>
<p>The place where, I don&rsquo;t even know what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>The place where, you know what I mean,</p>
<p>where it all, the energy&rsquo;s generated?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, the generators.</p>
<p>Like, where do I go?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s good questions.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Would you rather lose all your old memories</p>
<p>or never be able to make new ones?</p>
<p>The past or the future?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I can&rsquo;t lose my memories.</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>That makes me who I am.</p>
<p>But you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make new ones.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be, so you&rsquo;d be living in the moment,</p>
<p>nonstop with all the,</p>
<p>but you did say you&rsquo;re in a really good place.</p>
<p>So maybe this is a pretty good set of memories you got.</p>
<p>You got all the trauma.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you just, that&rsquo;s a nightmare.</p>
<p>You just created a nightmare for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nightmare.</p>
<p>The choice.</p>
<p>The choice is a nightmare.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re fucked either way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of death,</p>
<p>not being able to make new memories.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you got.</p>
<p>You get to relive the memories you have.</p>
<p>As a science guy, let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Are you afraid to die?</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Not of course.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I think about it every day.</p>
<p>Death.</p>
<p>Yeah, I meditate on my mortality all the time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrifying.</p>
<p>And because, are you terrified</p>
<p>because of the unknown</p>
<p>or because you believe it&rsquo;s nothingness?</p>
<p>The unknown, but my best guess</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s something like nothingness.</p>
<p>And that nothingness is-</p>
<p>So terrifying.</p>
<p>Yeah, the infinity of the nothingness.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But Ram Dass says,</p>
<p>and this is something that I always,</p>
<p>you know Ram Dass?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ram Dass says he believes that death</p>
<p>is like removing a tight shoe.</p>
<p>Like release.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, ah.</p>
<p>That could be it too.</p>
<p>I think maybe when we die,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s initially,</p>
<p>maybe the last feeling that we have is release.</p>
<p>And then if that happens and there&rsquo;s nothingness,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Well, no, that has to do more</p>
<p>with the actual feeling of death,</p>
<p>which I think some people are afraid of,</p>
<p>the experience to make sure it&rsquo;s one of release,</p>
<p>like you said.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the existential aspect that you no longer exist.</p>
<p>Like all the shit you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>kind of assumes you&rsquo;ll live forever.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>like all your career and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>you probably will be forgotten.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Like completely erased.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So all you have is a few moments in this life,</p>
<p>a few moments of joy,</p>
<p>a few moments of trauma,</p>
<p>of suffering, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re wasting your time today talking to me,</p>
<p>and then you have a few such moments.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll do a couple hundred more podcasts,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ll be dead.</p>
<p>No, because this right here, dude, right,</p>
<p>is human, number one,</p>
<p>I walked through a little fear today,</p>
<p>so I learned some things, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking to a science guy,</p>
<p>which I never thought I could.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the first scientist I&rsquo;ve ever talked to, right?</p>
<p>You get a diploma at the end of this.</p>
<p>Oh, good.</p>
<p>And I believe that there was a connection, right?</p>
<p>Not in a gay way.</p>
<p>Not in a gay way, non-gay connection, right?</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, I probably would blow you.</p>
<p>Would you?</p>
<p>In certain circumstances,</p>
<p>like if we were the last two people on planet Earth</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, those are probably the only ones,</p>
<p>or like somebody put a gun to my head,</p>
<p>you gotta blow, Lex!</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s kind of a turn on.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m turned on right now, I&rsquo;ll be honest.</p>
<p>Let me ask you one question.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>My fucking, that&rsquo;s the last one?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s the last one.</p>
<p>What do you think, why are we here?</p>
<p>Why are you here?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>Does any of it make sense to you?</p>
<p>I think ultimately,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s why I like life in general,</p>
<p>is what we talked about.</p>
<p>Like we view death, there is a mystery there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderment to it, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, when I walk outside,</p>
<p>and I look at the trees,</p>
<p>and I look at buildings that man made these buildings,</p>
<p>and I look at the universe,</p>
<p>and I look in the sky,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t really completely comprehend</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so, I&rsquo;m in awe of all of it, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have any answers, right?</p>
<p>But that, I think, is what the meaning of life is,</p>
<p>is to be in awe of it,</p>
<p>and the wonder of it all.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, just open your eyes to the wonder of it all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re still here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bobby, it&rsquo;s a huge honor to finally meet you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan for many, many years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor that you would even consider blowing me</p>
<p>in the correct kind of circumstances.</p>
<p>I think you would blow me in the right circumstances.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the definition of love.</p>
<p>Bobby, thanks so much for talking to me, brother.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Bobby Lee.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Kurt Vonnegut.</p>
<p>Laughter and tears are both responses</p>
<p>to frustration and exhaustion.</p>
<p>I, myself, prefer to laugh,</p>
<p>since there&rsquo;s less cleaning to do afterward.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
