    <p>I&rsquo;ve had it. I&rsquo;ve had it with the long camera set up. It&rsquo;s coming right out of the gates.</p>
<p>Okay. Clap one. One, two, three.</p>
<p>So are we supposed to start the podcast? You want to start?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<p>Okay. So I think the people kind of wanted us to do a podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of weird, but yeah, I&rsquo;m excited about it.</p>
<p>Especially our children. We&rsquo;re the biggest pushers.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true. Because they all wanted to be on it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of narcissists. Did we raise narcissists?</p>
<p>Oh, 100%.</p>
<p>Welcome to our podcast. This is I&rsquo;ve Had It. I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie, a.k.a. Pumps.</p>
<p>And we have a couple of producers in here, Jen, Neely,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re probably going to jump in because they&rsquo;re bossy and have strong opinions.</p>
<p>And then we have a really, really sweet sound producer, Richard, with us.</p>
<p>Glutton for punishment, working with all of us.</p>
<p>So what have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>Oh, yes. My number one thing I&rsquo;ve had it with as the last 24 hours is I bought a watermelon.</p>
<p>I did all the little tasks like knocking, flipping, clicking. It was a winner.</p>
<p>I was like, this is what all the YouTube videos say to do.</p>
<p>So I get it home and not only is it shitty watermelon, it had seeds.</p>
<p>Why do they even make watermelons with seeds anymore?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap our adventure of being a podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re competing on Instagram with like fucking kittens and dogs.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got watermelon with seeds? That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve had it with?</p>
<p>All right. Let me take over.</p>
<p>Take over.</p>
<p>So a strangest thing happened to me this week.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I go to Walgreens to get like some dental floss and some lipstick.</p>
<p>The beauty of shopping at a Walgreens is there&rsquo;s no salespeople.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And if you want a salesperson, you really have to hunt them down.</p>
<p>Get one that might be a little bit of a go-getter.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m looking at the lipstick color.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, this woman who is not wearing a Walgreens uniform,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like, well, can I help you pick out the right color?</p>
<p>I was so alarmed and thrown off guard.</p>
<p>Are we sure she was a sales associate?</p>
<p>Yes. And she had the little Walgreens tag.</p>
<p>And she was kind of manning the perfume counter.</p>
<p>I do like a good Walgreens perfume.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do. I get my perfume there.</p>
<p>Used to be at Dillard&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s cheaper.</p>
<p>Was this like Erica Kane, Susan Lucci?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s called Alien.</p>
<p>You wear a perfume called Alien?</p>
<p>Yes, I have for 100 years.</p>
<p>Is that why you stink all the time?</p>
<p>Fuck you, no.</p>
<p>I started wearing it when I smoked all the time.</p>
<p>And so it would like bathe me in the fragrance.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m nose blind to Alien because I&rsquo;ve never smelled perfume on you ever.</p>
<p>That can&rsquo;t be right.</p>
<p>My laundry soap and we&rsquo;re together all the time.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t smell it.</p>
<p>Nose blind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So anyway, by virtue of shopping at Walgreens,</p>
<p>I think that as a consumer, you have already said, I don&rsquo;t want to help her.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m going to Walgreens.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right. And so then I get ambushed.</p>
<p>And I mean, I had had it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy no lipstick.</p>
<p>Okay, let me tell you a story that I haven&rsquo;t told you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m driving in my car, minding my own business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at an intersection stop, stoplight.</p>
<p>I look around as you do at an intersection just to see what the other cars are, whatever.</p>
<p>So in a car, there&rsquo;s this guy in it.</p>
<p>He smiles real big.</p>
<p>And you know, I smile real big.</p>
<p>I mean, not like thinking one.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re flirting with a man.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not flirting with him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, he smiled and I smiled.</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So then he starts honking at me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I look over.</p>
<p>He had his dick out.</p>
<p>Wait, do you see the dick?</p>
<p>Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t like look, look, because I was so terrified.</p>
<p>I just went, I just saw kind of the turtle head.</p>
<p>And then I was like, knew what it was.</p>
<p>So I was like, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>And then he kept honking at me.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m just like, of course, just like looking away and like floored it when the light changed.</p>
<p>Did you call like 911 and say, hey, there&rsquo;s a flasher?</p>
<p>No, it never even occurred to me to call 911.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t think like, maybe we need to get this person pulled over and off the street since he&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>No, I never, I never thought about that.</p>
<p>So the Me Too movement just kind of passed right by you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I really thought about doing.</p>
<p>And it was after two lights later.</p>
<p>I wanted to, if I had it to do over again, I&rsquo;d stop my car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d roll down my window and go, let&rsquo;s go bend me over that fucking car right now.</p>
<p>Because I think he was just a flasher.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>He was just interested in the shock value.</p>
<p>So your biggest takeaway from.</p>
<p>Is that I should have sexually harassed him.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That was my takeaway.</p>
<p>Just kind of like to like call him out, like to shock him back.</p>
<p>Because I think he was doing it for shock.</p>
<p>So to shock him back and.</p>
<p>Okay, so let me ask you this.</p>
<p>What if he would have been like, okay, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Well, I would have run away.</p>
<p>I would have never actually done it.</p>
<p>I just wanted to be a big talk.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In my mind.</p>
<p>You know how those conversations happen after.</p>
<p>See, I think it would have been more helpful to society at large.</p>
<p>Had you called the police and said, there&rsquo;s a guy.</p>
<p>I would just want to apologize to the listeners for all the gurgling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just super loud.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think that more appropriate thing would have been to get that tag.</p>
<p>Call the police.</p>
<p>Because what if this guy&rsquo;s like a rapist?</p>
<p>What if he would be, would he be advertising?</p>
<p>Not big on fighting crime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I mean, he was in his car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he hurt me or touched me or whatever.</p>
<p>Just plus it would have made me late to my exercise class.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not me too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Me one.</p>
<p>Me one.</p>
<p>Me first.</p>
<p>Well, today I want to talk about a subject that I think you and I have felt for a very long time.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people might feel this, but they are scared to say it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nervous.</p>
<p>What are you going to say?</p>
<p>Do you think toddlers are assholes?</p>
<p>Of course toddlers are assholes.</p>
<p>I think the parents that say their toddlers aren&rsquo;t assholes are the assholes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Funny you should say that.</p>
<p>People like that.</p>
<p>Funny you should say that.</p>
<p>I remember it was probably around 2007.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You phoned me.</p>
<p>I say hello.</p>
<p>You immediately say, Emily is such a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>I cannot take it anymore.</p>
<p>Which was true.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Emily?</p>
<p>Emily is my daughter who&rsquo;s now almost 20.</p>
<p>How old was Emily at the time of this phone call?</p>
<p>She would have been five.</p>
<p>It started way before that though.</p>
<p>She had a mean streak from the job.</p>
<p>No, she totally did.</p>
<p>The biggest asshole toddler out of all five of our kids.</p>
<p>Emily, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not even close.</p>
<p>I remember a few things about Emily.</p>
<p>Remember we&rsquo;d drive around.</p>
<p>You had that white Suburban, which I affectionately refer to as the Petri dish.</p>
<p>It had all of our kids&rsquo; car seats in it.</p>
<p>We irritated the shit out of all of our fellow mom friends.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d go to Target together.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d take their kids to gymnastics together.</p>
<p>Lunch together.</p>
<p>Why do you give a shit?</p>
<p>Why do you give a shit?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be around us.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a win-win for them.</p>
<p>Yeah, really.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the only people who can tolerate each other.</p>
<p>Everyone hates us so much, really, of each other.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve got Dylan and Emily in the second row, and then the babies are in the back back.</p>
<p>Sam was like in kindergarten or something at the time.</p>
<p>And we pull up.</p>
<p>I go in to get some stamps at the post office.</p>
<p>You went into I Want Cards?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I come out.</p>
<p>Dylan is bawling, crying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s staring.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s so upset.</p>
<p>You are dying laughing.</p>
<p>Cannot breathe, you&rsquo;re laughing so hard.</p>
<p>Dylan had said, where&rsquo;s my mommy?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d my mommy go?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d my mommy go?</p>
<p>And Emily said, Dylan, your mommy gone, and she never coming back again.</p>
<p>Anytime anything didn&rsquo;t go her way.</p>
<p>I remember we were at a Mexican restaurant named Chica&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I think you had told her, straighten it up.</p>
<p>So then she would start crying.</p>
<p>She cried and vomited in that order.</p>
<p>Like she knew she was doing it.</p>
<p>Always happened.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in this restaurant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very small restaurant.</p>
<p>We are the table that everybody fucking hates.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Chips flying.</p>
<p>Chips me and our five kids, which we always refer to her kids and my kids when we&rsquo;re together</p>
<p>as our kids, because we kind of raise them together.</p>
<p>There were some respectable, civilized, dressed cute people in there.</p>
<p>On a date.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And Emily starts in, and it builds up to a projectile vomit.</p>
<p>There she starts the gagging, and I go, don&rsquo;t you vomit.</p>
<p>I will sprink your bottom if you vomit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, you are threatening her in front of a total restaurant full of people.</p>
<p>And of course she did vomit.</p>
<p>Right in the chip bowl.</p>
<p>No, she vomited right in the chip bowl.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just sitting there going, oh, mother fucker.</p>
<p>I mean, and I remember the people looking around at us because I wanted to be them.</p>
<p>I identify as them.</p>
<p>I did not identify as the out of control female with toddlers that you couldn&rsquo;t control that</p>
<p>projectile vomit over a dining table.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t identify as a person that that could happen.</p>
<p>I just want to say for the record, and I&rsquo;m not trying to be a bitch, or maybe I am.</p>
<p>When I took my kids out, just the two of us, they didn&rsquo;t vomit on the table.</p>
<p>Nobody ever vomited on the table?</p>
<p>No, it was always Emily.</p>
<p>No, but she would go from zero to meltdown in about 20 seconds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad those days are over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like teenagers better than toddlers.</p>
<p>This is why I think that people need to face it.</p>
<p>Toddlers are assholes.</p>
<p>Every time you&rsquo;re on a plane and somebody&rsquo;s kicking the back of your seat, who is it?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s doing it?</p>
<p>Childs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Fucking had it.</p>
<p>Had it overall with toddlers in general.</p>
<p>I found this blogger.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>And she puts this blog post under the hashtag mothering with heart and joy.</p>
<p>Does she have five nanny?</p>
<p>Let me just do a slight dramatic reading here to let you know what we&rsquo;re up against.</p>
<p>So the main topic I have to talk about again is how we speak to our small children online.</p>
<p>This is all caps.</p>
<p>Cap lock, Donald Trump 2 a.m. style cap lock.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s mad about it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s mad about it.</p>
<p>Stop calling your small children assholes.</p>
<p>If you are a parent and call your small child any cruel name off or online, trust me, they are not the asshole you are.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right.</p>
<p>Caps lock.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just she&rsquo;s just getting her toes wet.</p>
<p>She says last night before I went to bed, a friend showed me the latest funny viral photo that is making its rounds in the mummy community.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Mummy as in British mother.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Not zombies.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>This photo is of a small child I think is under two.</p>
<p>This little child was asleep with a baby bottle of milk laying beside him over the top of him.</p>
<p>One of his parents or caretakers had written, I&rsquo;m an asshole today in wooden little play blocks.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, high five to the parents that did it.</p>
<p>The baby, first and foremost, can&rsquo;t read or get on the Internet.</p>
<p>So how all of a sudden it&rsquo;s a victim of its parents that just had to do all the shit you have to do with a baby all day.</p>
<p>And none of this means you don&rsquo;t love your baby.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re venting online.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What this person needs is a part time job.</p>
<p>Richard, you&rsquo;ve got a couple of kids, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I got two.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought like, God, they&rsquo;re an asshole?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just into everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a constant deal.</p>
<p>You never get a break.</p>
<p>I mean, for anybody to say that their kid&rsquo;s never an asshole just proves to me how blind they are.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think is a larger point of all of this.</p>
<p>When did this come about that we are supposed to get like bicycle pumps and just pump rainbows and green clovers and fucking unicorns up their ass 24-7, 365?</p>
<p>I know it wasn&rsquo;t like that when we were young.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There was nothing like that.</p>
<p>The culture that every child, winners and losers don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Every child that participates is recognized and afforded a trophy.</p>
<p>What did we get?</p>
<p>We got honorable mention.</p>
<p>Honorable mention.</p>
<p>And that was only if you were.</p>
<p>It was like fourth or fifth place.</p>
<p>Sometimes you do a science project and you wouldn&rsquo;t get anything.</p>
<p>Am I not loud enough?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get shit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you lost something, you just lost.</p>
<p>But I recall also like the time that you called me.</p>
<p>I called you and I go, she&rsquo;s such a fucking bitch.</p>
<p>And you go, who?</p>
<p>And I said, Emily.</p>
<p>And I think you busted out laughing.</p>
<p>I did bust out laughing.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>But I do remember and I&rsquo;m not trying to point fingers here.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would never.</p>
<p>But I remember a time distinctly when your marriage was falling apart.</p>
<p>And I mean, I mean, Titanic style fucking sink with an airplane.</p>
<p>With like a nuclear power plant meltdown.</p>
<p>Total.</p>
<p>I mean, epic meltdown.</p>
<p>But I remember you crying on my front porch.</p>
<p>And audience, this has been like 15 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be that heartless because we&rsquo;re way past it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But you were bawling crying and you said,</p>
<p>My kids&rsquo; lives are supposed to be perfect.</p>
<p>You love jabbing that in.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t understand where you thought that somebody&rsquo;s life was supposed to be perfect.</p>
<p>I remember the conversation.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t deny it.</p>
<p>But you at some point had this.</p>
<p>I was the ringleader of the my kids&rsquo; lives have to be perfect movement.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>To the point of codependent enabler.</p>
<p>All all the letters.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How about at that same time?</p>
<p>I remember crying to you.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so terrible.</p>
<p>But at least I have my kids.</p>
<p>And if I remember correctly, you said, Oh, God, you would have kids with somebody else.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d love them just as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you know, that&rsquo;s not really the silver lining.</p>
<p>You think it is.</p>
<p>Empathy is not my strong suit at times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not advocating to tell your kid that to the face, it&rsquo;s an asshole unless they&rsquo;re over the age of 18.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think that at 18, you can say quit being an asshole.</p>
<p>Some parents are probably cringing right now.</p>
<p>But I just think there&rsquo;s a normal flow that you can do that.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve heard you tell your kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve called both my boys a dick before.</p>
<p>I remember Dylan, my oldest son, had a kid over.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll remember this story because I called you.</p>
<p>He has a friend over.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably second or third grade.</p>
<p>They want pizza.</p>
<p>I order Domino&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The kid comes to me, the friend, not my kid, but the friend who&rsquo;s spending the night.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably like eight.</p>
<p>Mrs. Welch, where did you order the pizza from?</p>
<p>I said, Domino&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He has a stage five meltdown that it&rsquo;s not Masio&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Starts banging my walls, freaking out.</p>
<p>Like that child could have benefited from being told, You&rsquo;re annoying.</p>
<p>You cannot behave that way.</p>
<p>Because nobody&rsquo;s ever said, You&rsquo;re so annoying.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that gurgling.</p>
<p>Is that bad?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, okay.</p>
<p>This podcast is going to tank.</p>
<p>Will you take it away?</p>
<p>Take it away.</p>
<p>Watermelon seeds and pumped down iced tea.</p>
<p>You guys shouldn&rsquo;t have come all the way from Los Angeles to do this.</p>
<p>Kiss my fat ass.</p>
<p>We were like latchkey kids.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And if I had my kids complain about what was being served to them at somebody else&rsquo;s house,</p>
<p>I would be livid.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, they would be in so much trouble.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think that there is this movement in parenting where,</p>
<p>I think it started with you on my porch when your divorce was going south,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to blame this whole movement on you when you said your kids&rsquo; lives were supposed to be perfect.</p>
<p>I infiltrated the rest of the world.</p>
<p>You recant that right now.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, obviously.</p>
<p>I should have recanted it immediately.</p>
<p>I think it starts with this generation with these fucking gender reveals.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having a boy or a girl.</p>
<p>Not a kangaroo.</p>
<p>Not a giraffe.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of two choices.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s popping out a hippo.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not the first one that&rsquo;s ever had one.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s this praising of normal activity.</p>
<p>Being good is praise.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just what you&rsquo;re supposed to fucking do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay, I have been hanging on to this for dear life.</p>
<p>Okay, so while you were in Italy, I go to a basketball game.</p>
<p>One of my girlfriends is sitting there.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got this real pretty pink top on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, my gosh, she looks so cute for a basketball game.</p>
<p>She goes, well, I&rsquo;m going to a baby shower after this.</p>
<p>And I said, oh, okay.</p>
<p>She goes, I had to go buy this shirt.</p>
<p>And I said, why?</p>
<p>She said, because the invitation said to wear pink because it&rsquo;s a girl.</p>
<p>So now not only do we have to all praise you for having a boy or a girl,</p>
<p>everybody has to go out and buy something new to go with the color.</p>
<p>I mean, I think she should have called that person and said,</p>
<p>listen to me, you little motherfucker.</p>
<p>Nobody gives a flying fuck if it&rsquo;s a boy or a girl.</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we just have cake and give you some presents?</p>
<p>Why do we have to make this big of a deal?</p>
<p>But, I mean, just the entitlement to think that anybody else gives a shit,</p>
<p>what your kid&rsquo;s going to be outside of the grandparents and the parents.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not a giraffe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Which would be a scientific miracle that should be celebrated.</p>
<p>We would celebrate that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If there was interspecies birth giving, I mean, I&rsquo;d be the first.</p>
<p>I would have a whole episode on that.</p>
<p>I would have a scientist in here that we&rsquo;d interview.</p>
<p>We get our guy, Neil.</p>
<p>Inside joke audience.</p>
<p>I made Pops listen to a podcast the other day in preparation for this.</p>
<p>And I said, which one did you listen to?</p>
<p>And she said, oh, with that guest, um, Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
<p>And she mispronounces everything.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a goddamn redneck from Oklahoma.</p>
<p>I am a small town girl.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an Oklahoma city girl.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is a city.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like a small town.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Million people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I mean, I.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a redneck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a redneck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Loud and proud.</p>
<p>But I.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So back.</p>
<p>The mother that had the shower where you had to dress.</p>
<p>That one.</p>
<p>That one.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the, here&rsquo;s the deal with the baby showers.</p>
<p>Number one, they&rsquo;re insufferable.</p>
<p>Thank you notes.</p>
<p>Everything about.</p>
<p>Nobody really wants to go.</p>
<p>And then the circle jerk where everybody&rsquo;s sitting around in a circle and you pull out a onesie and everybody goes, oh, I mean, put a sock in it.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>Nobody gives a shit.</p>
<p>People have been breeding literally since the beginning of our species and other species have done it prior to us.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>It is exciting.</p>
<p>I think baby showers, they need to be.</p>
<p>I think sometimes you need to take into account the feelings of the guest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very exciting time and people are like 15 minutes worth of excited.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t want to spend two hours on a Saturday being excited about somebody else&rsquo;s wedding or birthday.</p>
<p>So a hundred percent, you&rsquo;re not taking into the account guest, particularly a baby shower.</p>
<p>Cause I mean, I remember a friend of had a baby shower for Josh and me when I was pregnant with Dylan.</p>
<p>It was a couple&rsquo;s baby shower, which is better.</p>
<p>A hundred percent better.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m eight months pregnant, fatter than a goddamn pig.</p>
<p>I have to socialize and everybody is completely hammered.</p>
<p>And the only way that drunk people are tolerable is if you&rsquo;re drunk, you have to be drunk with the drunk people.</p>
<p>Otherwise you don&rsquo;t want to be around drunk people.</p>
<p>So at every turn, I see that probably the biggest gift that a person that&rsquo;s pregnant could give to those that love them is just to say,</p>
<p>in lieu of torturing you with a circle jerk of opening up onesies, diapers, booties, car seats.</p>
<p>We all know what the gifts are going to be.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s popping out a hooker and some cocaine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not happening at the baby shower, which would be really interesting.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so I think you could just say in lieu of, you know, having hosting the baby shower circle jerk, I&rsquo;m registered here.</p>
<p>Send a gift, send a gift.</p>
<p>And I would probably appoint that person for a Nobel peace prize.</p>
<p>I mean, truly, I think, I think it could really solve a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Well, what you&rsquo;ve got is people who like we&rsquo;re in the age now where we&rsquo;re going to graduations, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a time in your life where all you&rsquo;re doing every weekend is going to a wedding because that&rsquo;s where you are in your life.</p>
<p>And then all you&rsquo;re doing is going to baby showers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like if they gave you a wedding shower, you have to give them a wedding shower, baby shower.</p>
<p>It just the list goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tit for tat.</p>
<p>It is a tit for tat.</p>
<p>Fortress events.</p>
<p>But the number one most obnoxious thing about the whole thing is the gender reveal party.</p>
<p>We are going to elaborate on this in another episode.</p>
<p>If anybody even listens to this one, because I know everybody&rsquo;s glued to their seats about how Pubs had it with watermelons, seeds and a watermelon.</p>
<p>Do you guys or I mean, would that would that be something that you would have it with if you bought a watermelon with seeds?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s kind of expected.</p>
<p>I mean, yes.</p>
<p>Watermelons have seeds.</p>
<p>Apples have seeds.</p>
<p>I know, but they now like that&rsquo;s the first watermelon I bought like two years that had seeds.</p>
<p>So once the once you discovered the watermelon had seeds, what&rsquo;d you do?</p>
<p>I threw it away.</p>
<p>And you ate a?</p>
<p>Pineapple.</p>
<p>Tell the listener about what your theory is about pineapples.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always heard that pineapples are the universal sign that you want to be a swinger.</p>
<p>What did you think when you first found out about the swingers?</p>
<p>I mean, I was shocked.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s shocking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty shocking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then, of course, I immediately think, what if the wife&rsquo;s beautiful?</p>
<p>So your husband&rsquo;s all in and the husband&rsquo;s a complete fucking dog that you get stuck with.</p>
<p>I mean, that would be kind of my one and two.</p>
<p>Okay, so let me because this is the first time I ever heard this, that the pineapple.</p>
<p>I think everybody except you knows that.</p>
<p>Nellie, Nellie, pineapple international sign of swingers.</p>
<p>Yes or no.</p>
<p>First heard it or you known it your whole life?</p>
<p>First time hearing it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Jen Morton.</p>
<p>First time hearing it.</p>
<p>Zip it.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but I have to go with pumps.</p>
<p>You knew?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Are you a swinger?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Okay, bye.</p>
<p>But you have to be leery.</p>
<p>Like, they got pineapples all like in their house and pictures and all that stuff.</p>
<p>You got to be like, okay, let&rsquo;s not drink too much.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because they may be wanting to kick it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So if you came over to my house, if Josh and I were having a little shindig, and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say we were serving pineapple drinks, little pineapple appetizer, and had maybe some pineapple</p>
<p>accessories, you&rsquo;d immediately go, these two are swingers.</p>
<p>Is this an aggressive way of asking?</p>
<p>Are you trying to hit on me with your serving pineapple, pineapple drinks and pineapple</p>
<p>paraphernalia?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to jump in.</p>
<p>We have a couple who was a couple.</p>
<p>They have pineapples all over the house.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Several questions.</p>
<p>Several questions.</p>
<p>I am shocked.</p>
<p>And they are.</p>
<p>Heterosexual.</p>
<p>And they are swingers?</p>
<p>And they are.</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>It is true.</p>
<p>Look at you.</p>
<p>Pulp culture.</p>
<p>People drive down the street, beat off to you.</p>
<p>You absolutely are not victimized by it.</p>
<p>Goddamn slut.</p>
<p>I am so shocked right now.</p>
<p>Okay, so wait.</p>
<p>So these people, are they boy, girl?</p>
<p>Husband, wife.</p>
<p>Husband, wife, legally married.</p>
<p>Legally married.</p>
<p>Pineapples out the wazoo.</p>
<p>Pineapples everywhere.</p>
<p>The swinging is new.</p>
<p>The swinging is new.</p>
<p>Did the pineapples in the house predate the announcement to you all of the swinging?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So it was going on behind your back.</p>
<p>It was just new to you all.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If the pineapples were there.</p>
<p>No, she would have told me.</p>
<p>According to Pumps, maybe they were just, they had already outed themselves to the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a secret group.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You think swingers were assholes when they were toddlers?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think they were probably good sharers.</p>
<p>What adults, like a famous adult right now, are you like 100% was an asshole as a toddler?</p>
<p>Oh God, Larry David, of course.</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t you think he was just an obstinate child?</p>
<p>No, I think he was probably perfect.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love, I&rsquo;m not going to tolerate any sort of child abuse.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>Towards Larry David, first and foremost.</p>
<p>All our kids were assholes and we love them and think they&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>I think it would have made him a better toddler if he had that smart ass.</p>
<p>Probably not a great teenager though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I do remember though, if you don&rsquo;t have kids and somebody wants to talk about their kids</p>
<p>all the time or they bring their kid, that&rsquo;s a huge violation is when you&rsquo;re having an</p>
<p>adult night and they bring their kid and the whole complexion of the night changes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge violation when somebody waltzes in.</p>
<p>Huge.</p>
<p>We had a pool party not long ago.</p>
<p>Some friends that we invited texted and said, can we bring such and such and such and such,</p>
<p>which were their kids, because it was like a divorce situation.</p>
<p>I just said, no, do not come.</p>
<p>Do not bring your kids.</p>
<p>I am at the stage in my life where if I&rsquo;m going to be around kids, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be my kids, your kids, or kids that I shared DNA with.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Josh and I recently went over to some friend&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>We did not want to stay.</p>
<p>And I flat out told them like, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to stay for dinner.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already starving.</p>
<p>You guys eat late.</p>
<p>We played tennis for two hours.</p>
<p>I do not think that I can stay at this party.</p>
<p>And Josh looked at them and he goes, and we&rsquo;ve got to get home to our dogs.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better to say we just don&rsquo;t want to stay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided just to be honest.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was invited by these people to go to a dinner.</p>
<p>I was going to be in Italy.</p>
<p>And there are some people I do business with.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re Brazilians.</p>
<p>They make these beautiful cabinets.</p>
<p>And they said, we&rsquo;re going to send a car to pick you and Josh up to come to our dinner</p>
<p>in Milan.</p>
<p>And I was at Lake Como.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only like 30 minutes away.</p>
<p>So I was like, oh, that sounds great.</p>
<p>I told Josh, yeah, we&rsquo;re going to go to this bougie dinner in Milan.</p>
<p>So this gal sends the invitation over.</p>
<p>And it says that the dinner starts at nine.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re asleep by nine.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even try to come up with any excuse.</p>
<p>I said, reply all.</p>
<p>Dear such and such, thank you so, so much for the invitation.</p>
<p>However, that is past my bedtime.</p>
<p>And I have to get to bed early that night because I have tennis lessons the very</p>
<p>next morning.</p>
<p>I hope your event is a great success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even going to make up shit anymore.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re to the point now.</p>
<p>I think we can just say thank you so much for the invite.</p>
<p>I simply don&rsquo;t want to come to your party.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I will say, as we both hate group texters and people that abuse it,</p>
<p>the reply all was kind of a little bit of an abuse because nobody else on the</p>
<p>invitation list gives a fuck if you&rsquo;re coming or not.</p>
<p>That could have gone straight to the hostess.</p>
<p>No, they were all, they were a business of people that hosted the event.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, okay.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t just the hostess.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I thought you were making everybody on the invite list suffer,</p>
<p>suffer whether or not you were coming or not,</p>
<p>which they don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re coming or not.</p>
<p>So let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Do you think our kids are humiliated by this episode where we say that for</p>
<p>sure, when our kids were little, they were assholes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know because my kids already know I&rsquo;ve told them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve asked me if you, if we went back in time,</p>
<p>would you want to do that over again?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, absolutely not.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t ever want to go back to that little bitty baby stage,</p>
<p>the toddler where you have to do everything for them,</p>
<p>cut up their food.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>I was that stupid mother that said everything I said I wouldn&rsquo;t do as a</p>
<p>mother.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>So I was the number one, they&rsquo;re going to eat what I fix.</p>
<p>Like what if I make it, they&rsquo;re going to eat it by God.</p>
<p>And I remember one night I had macaroni and cheese going mashed potatoes</p>
<p>going and rice going because everybody wanted something else.</p>
<p>And I thought, who&rsquo;s the fucking problem here?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think mostly kids are normal if they&rsquo;re assholes.</p>
<p>I think the problem is the parents are really the assholes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think being a toddler and being an asshole are synonymous.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I think parents pointing it out to other parents are putting the blocks</p>
<p>online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just totally normal because your life has been hijacked.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>And the part of it is beautiful and awesome and amazing.</p>
<p>And you feel this love that you&rsquo;ve never felt before.</p>
<p>But this other part is like, Oh my God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a grind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a total grind.</p>
<p>And I think that we have to be able to tell our friends,</p>
<p>my kid was being an asshole today.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s some camaraderie.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Misery loves company.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Misery loves company.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this expectation that&rsquo;s put on parents that you&rsquo;re supposed to say</p>
<p>24-7, 365.</p>
<p>Being a parent is awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p>I think people have forgotten that you can have compound feelings.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You can have two feelings at the same time.</p>
<p>This is the very best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life.</p>
<p>But the day that Emily vomited in Chica&rsquo;s Mexican restaurant projectile,</p>
<p>and everybody looked at us, that was one of the worst days.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It was awful.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We could not get them to bed quick enough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m pretty lax about all the rules except 8 o&rsquo;clock bedtime.</p>
<p>I mean, 8 o&rsquo;clock bedtime at my house when the kids were little was like militant.</p>
<p>It was like military time.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s like, oh, my gosh, you do so good with bedtime.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;d go crazy if they were up for two more hours.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, their bedtime is for me.</p>
<p>I have a question.</p>
<p>So if Jen and I have a child, we can&rsquo;t come over for a pool party with our child?</p>
<p>If somebody says we&rsquo;re having some other couples over for an adult pool party</p>
<p>and you show up with a baby, I not only don&rsquo;t think you should come to my party,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want you producing the podcast, nor do I want you to be my friend.</p>
<p>Nobody does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>All I can say about that is, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
