    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Kyle Gillette.</p>
<p>Dr. Kyle Gillette is a dual board certified physician</p>
<p>in family medicine and obesity medicine,</p>
<p>and an expert in hormone optimization.</p>
<p>He is an MD, that is a medical doctor,</p>
<p>and he treats patients with a variety of backgrounds,</p>
<p>ages, and goals.</p>
<p>Today, we discuss male hormone optimization.</p>
<p>We discuss behavioral tools, nutrition-based tools,</p>
<p>supplement-based tools, prescription drug-based tools,</p>
<p>and their interactions in determining overall levels</p>
<p>of testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone,</p>
<p>estrogen growth hormone, thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>and many other hormones that impact mood,</p>
<p>libido, wellbeing, strength, cognition,</p>
<p>and various psychological factors.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve covered hormone optimization in both men and women</p>
<p>in previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>but today&rsquo;s discussion is different.</p>
<p>Dr. Kyle Gillette offers very specific recommendations</p>
<p>for people with different goals and of different ages,</p>
<p>and we get deep into the weeds of, for instance,</p>
<p>how does one know whether or not their testosterone</p>
<p>is optimized or not?</p>
<p>How often to test for specific hormones,</p>
<p>such as testosterone and other hormones,</p>
<p>and really how to gauge how good one should feel.</p>
<p>This is something that&rsquo;s often overlooked in discussions</p>
<p>about hormone optimization or health optimization</p>
<p>of any kind for that matter.</p>
<p>For instance, people will talk about reduced libido</p>
<p>and discuss whether or not testosterone levels are to blame,</p>
<p>but how does one calibrate their libido in the first place?</p>
<p>That is, how does one know whether or not their libido</p>
<p>is normal, too low, or too high?</p>
<p>We also discuss, for instance,</p>
<p>whether or not hormone optimization should be pursued</p>
<p>continually throughout the year, for instance,</p>
<p>whether or not you should cycle on and off supplements</p>
<p>and or prescription drugs</p>
<p>geared towards hormone optimization,</p>
<p>and we discuss the behavioral foundations</p>
<p>of optimal hormone function.</p>
<p>These are things that every male should be doing</p>
<p>and various things they should actively avoid</p>
<p>if their goal is to have healthy hormones</p>
<p>and to quote unquote optimize their levels of every hormone</p>
<p>from growth hormone to testosterone at any stage of life.</p>
<p>And while today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>is about male hormone optimization,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that we discuss all the various ages</p>
<p>for male hormone optimization.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are parents,</p>
<p>for those of you that are young,</p>
<p>those of you that are middle-aged or old or teenagers,</p>
<p>we explore adolescent, puberty, teen, and late teens,</p>
<p>early adulthood, adulthood, and into the late geriatric ages.</p>
<p>So regardless of your age</p>
<p>and whether or not you are male or female,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode ought to be of interest to you.</p>
<p>I should also point out</p>
<p>that we will soon also be hosting an expert guest</p>
<p>on female hormone optimization.</p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;m certain people of all ages</p>
<p>and biological sex will enjoy about today&rsquo;s conversation</p>
<p>is that we also get into descriptions</p>
<p>of how psychology and life events impact hormones</p>
<p>and how hormones impact our psychology</p>
<p>and the way that we show up to various life events.</p>
<p>So today is really a broad overview</p>
<p>that goes all the way down to fine details</p>
<p>about male hormone optimization.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certain that by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have an immense amount of new information</p>
<p>about how this endocrine,</p>
<p>that is hormone system in your body, works</p>
<p>and how it interacts with your brain and other tissues</p>
<p>and many, many actionable tools that you can pursue</p>
<p>regardless of stage of life.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public,</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram,</p>
<p>of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Kyle Gillette.</p>
<p>Dr. Gillette, great to have you back.</p>
<p>Great to be back, thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to begin with a question</p>
<p>about one of the most mysterious</p>
<p>and important phases of life, which is puberty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long wondered whether or not</p>
<p>how quickly somebody goes into puberty, so at what age,</p>
<p>and how long puberty takes,</p>
<p>so how brief or protracted that puberty is</p>
<p>for them to acquire</p>
<p>the so-called secondary sexual characteristics,</p>
<p>things like hair growth on the face for males,</p>
<p>changes in bone and muscle density and growth, et cetera.</p>
<p>When I was in middle school and high school,</p>
<p>I noticed that some people transitioned</p>
<p>into all that very fast,</p>
<p>and some people took a long time</p>
<p>to acquire those characteristics.</p>
<p>Can we learn anything about ourselves, our hormones,</p>
<p>and maybe even how long we&rsquo;re going to live</p>
<p>based on the time in which we enter puberty</p>
<p>and how long it takes us to progress through puberty?</p>
<p>I guess that also raises the question,</p>
<p>does puberty ever truly end?</p>
<p>There are many takeaways from puberty.</p>
<p>Some of the actionable items from it is,</p>
<p>yes, it can and does affect your adult height</p>
<p>and also stature and also body composition.</p>
<p>So puberty is a time,</p>
<p>and if we&rsquo;re talking specifically about males,</p>
<p>think of it as a time where if you have obesity as a child,</p>
<p>you could potentially use that time</p>
<p>to change your lifestyle and habits and reset things,</p>
<p>and it is a bit easier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a free injection of testosterone</p>
<p>and metabolism and drive and effort into your life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wide variation in how quickly puberty goes through.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s stages called tanner stages,</p>
<p>which we don&rsquo;t necessarily need to get into,</p>
<p>but if you enter puberty very early,</p>
<p>then it can decrease your adult height or stature.</p>
<p>So for a given male that enters puberty at 13</p>
<p>versus a male that enters puberty at 15,</p>
<p>can we say that the guy that entered puberty at 13</p>
<p>is going to be shorter than the guy</p>
<p>that entered puberty at 15,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not quite that straightforward?</p>
<p>If they are identical twins</p>
<p>and the individual who entered puberty at age 13</p>
<p>also finished puberty,</p>
<p>went all the way through the tanner stages,</p>
<p>and if you do a bone scan,</p>
<p>which I believe is usually done on the left wrist,</p>
<p>and it says, yes, your growth plates are mostly closed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna grow more</p>
<p>than a couple inches of height after that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Just a related question.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, it was thought,</p>
<p>or at least people would say,</p>
<p>that resistance training in particular,</p>
<p>lifting heavy weights could stunt one&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>Is that true or false?</p>
<p>It is false when you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about just lifting heavy weights.</p>
<p>Dirty bulking certainly has the potential</p>
<p>to stunt one&rsquo;s growth for two main mechanisms.</p>
<p>Could you define dirty bulking?</p>
<p>So dirty bulking is eating an excess of calories,</p>
<p>not just to acquire lean metabolically active body mass</p>
<p>or get stronger, but purposely acquiring body fat.</p>
<p>So purposely acquiring muscle and fat by overeating</p>
<p>and lifting weights can stunt one&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>Do I have that correct?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So it does two things.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing it as a very young child,</p>
<p>that fat can become leptin-resistant</p>
<p>and it can produce more leptin,</p>
<p>and that leptin can activate the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which activates the pituitary,</p>
<p>which releases gonadotropins,</p>
<p>which basically just increase testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen earlier than it otherwise would have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same mechanism behind</p>
<p>why childhood obesity causes early puberty.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I do remember a paper published in Science Magazine.</p>
<p>I believe it was focused mainly on females,</p>
<p>but showing that when enough body fat accumulates,</p>
<p>the hormone leptin is secreted</p>
<p>and that triggers the onset of puberty.</p>
<p>Given the increase in childhood obesity</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re observing now,</p>
<p>are we seeing an earlier onset of puberty</p>
<p>in males and females?</p>
<p>Yes, in both males and females.</p>
<p>Not to get too technical,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a G-protein coupled receptor</p>
<p>on the hypothalamus and leptin directly binds it.</p>
<p>So it does appear directly causatory</p>
<p>and not just correlation.</p>
<p>Okay, so, and if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying is for a young guy,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 13, 14,</p>
<p>who wants to really bulk up</p>
<p>and deliberately, excuse me, overeats</p>
<p>and is doing their squats and deadlifts and bench presses</p>
<p>and really trying to get big,</p>
<p>they will get big,</p>
<p>but only in the lateral dimension.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re effectively limiting their total height</p>
<p>and it can shut down the long bone growth of their limbs.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>The growth of the long bones</p>
<p>is mostly related to the estradiol alpha receptor.</p>
<p>So basically one of the receptors for estrogen,</p>
<p>which can be secondary to early puberty</p>
<p>and also is related to body fat</p>
<p>because you have that conversion</p>
<p>of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>So can we assume that if a young male</p>
<p>wants to get into resistance training,</p>
<p>that body weight exercises are probably okay</p>
<p>and maybe even some weight training, kettlebells, et cetera,</p>
<p>but that they should avoid doing so-called dirty bulking,</p>
<p>trying to deliberately gain weight up until what age?</p>
<p>Until puberty is over?</p>
<p>I would say an individual should limit</p>
<p>the amount of body,</p>
<p>abnormal body fat accumulation</p>
<p>or dirty bulking indefinitely</p>
<p>throughout their entire life.</p>
<p>So again, if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>that recommendation to avoid deliberate weight gain</p>
<p>or rapid weight gain is not just to allow an individual</p>
<p>to reach their maximum height,</p>
<p>but also to avoid laying down a lot of body fat cells.</p>
<p>Correct?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>The balance between that is</p>
<p>when you are going through puberty,</p>
<p>you are able to add a lot of lean body mass,</p>
<p>not just muscle mass,</p>
<p>but bone mass and other mass as well.</p>
<p>I started lifting weights when I was 16</p>
<p>and I confess I trained pretty heavy at times.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether or not</p>
<p>I would have been taller than I am now,</p>
<p>but when I started that training,</p>
<p>I had already reached what was at least close</p>
<p>to my predicted height.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I deliberately waited until I&rsquo;d grown.</p>
<p>It just so happened that I stumbled into the weight room</p>
<p>and found that I liked it at age 16,</p>
<p>at which point I was already the height that I am now.</p>
<p>So in any case,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m hearing is that laying down</p>
<p>a lot of excess body fat is not a good idea.</p>
<p>What if somebody grows up chubby or fat for whatever reason,</p>
<p>reasons related to the eating patterns in their family,</p>
<p>maybe even some genetic reasons,</p>
<p>is it safe and or wise for a young person?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say somebody who&rsquo;s around the age of puberty</p>
<p>or even younger or in their late teens</p>
<p>to be dieting and actively trying to lose body fat.</p>
<p>Is that safe?</p>
<p>Under the supervision of a physician,</p>
<p>it is certainly safe to change your body composition.</p>
<p>In pediatric obesity medicine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re often talking about a recomposition</p>
<p>or a re-normalization of the growth curve</p>
<p>compared to peers.</p>
<p>Great, thank you.</p>
<p>So as you may have sensed,</p>
<p>we started chronologically with puberty,</p>
<p>and I know that there&rsquo;s another puberty</p>
<p>that even precedes the puberty that we&rsquo;re all familiar with.</p>
<p>Maybe if you want to just briefly mention that,</p>
<p>because I was talking with you about this before we started,</p>
<p>the puberty that I&rsquo;m most familiar with,</p>
<p>and I think most people are most familiar with,</p>
<p>the acquisition of deepening of the voice,</p>
<p>growth of muscle and bone, body hair,</p>
<p>acquisition of libido and things like that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually the second puberty that we all go through.</p>
<p>Maybe just mention for us and educate us</p>
<p>on the first puberty.</p>
<p>I think most people will be hearing this</p>
<p>for the very first time.</p>
<p>The first puberty of everyone&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>is the first three months of their life.</p>
<p>You may notice that your baby has more acne</p>
<p>the first three months,</p>
<p>and that they also have, in general,</p>
<p>just more changes related to androgens and estrogens,</p>
<p>perhaps oilier skin, even more genital growth</p>
<p>during the first three months.</p>
<p>And this is mostly due to DHEA, which is an adrenal hormone.</p>
<p>The second puberty or the puberty that most people know of</p>
<p>actually starts that same way as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called adrenarche,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s when the adrenals kick in,</p>
<p>I guess, for the second time.</p>
<p>Is there a standard age or age range</p>
<p>in which the testicles descend in males?</p>
<p>Usually before birth.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to have one</p>
<p>or even two undescended testes,</p>
<p>but there is a risk of testicular cancer,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re not fixed early,</p>
<p>and also heat damage to the testes.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for that coverage of the two puberties.</p>
<p>So early in life.</p>
<p>I imagine some of our listeners</p>
<p>are probably still in one or the other puberty.</p>
<p>The ones that are in the first puberty,</p>
<p>obviously aren&rsquo;t aware that they&rsquo;re listening</p>
<p>to this podcast,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;ll be embedded in their subconscious.</p>
<p>But some listeners probably are still in puberty.</p>
<p>But I think everyone can remember back to their puberty</p>
<p>and roughly when they first entered puberty</p>
<p>and how quickly they aggregated</p>
<p>the secondary sex characteristics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to turn now to a general question</p>
<p>about what all males ought to do</p>
<p>in order to optimize their hormones.</p>
<p>So if you could just list off the things</p>
<p>that all males should do on a daily basis, weekly basis,</p>
<p>I mean, should guys in their teens and twenties</p>
<p>be getting their blood work done?</p>
<p>Should they be taking supplements?</p>
<p>We already talked about weight training.</p>
<p>What should they be doing?</p>
<p>What should they avoid doing</p>
<p>if the goal is to have a long arc</p>
<p>of healthy hormone optimization throughout the lifespan?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many things that you should do.</p>
<p>An analogy that I often make is</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a brand new car</p>
<p>that comes off the assembly line,</p>
<p>you do a full scope of diagnostic workup,</p>
<p>hook it up to the computer.</p>
<p>And I think we should do the same thing with humans as well.</p>
<p>During puberty, obviously you&rsquo;re a functioning human,</p>
<p>but I would say there&rsquo;s still development.</p>
<p>And I think that the human always develops.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think development ever ends,</p>
<p>but you wanna monitor that progress</p>
<p>across a person&rsquo;s lifespan.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>So for blood work,</p>
<p>what would be the earliest,</p>
<p>let me put it this way.</p>
<p>If blood work didn&rsquo;t cost anything</p>
<p>and everyone could get it,</p>
<p>when would you want to see everybody</p>
<p>get their blood work done for the first time?</p>
<p>Obviously individuals under the age of 18</p>
<p>should talk with their parents about this.</p>
<p>And as long as that the parents and the child kind of agree</p>
<p>and the parents are on board with this as well,</p>
<p>you can start getting blood work.</p>
<p>Often a child will come in with complaints</p>
<p>of either precocious puberty or delayed puberty.</p>
<p>And this individual might be nine</p>
<p>or this individual might be 15.</p>
<p>For a healthy child,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re going through kind of their later tanner stages,</p>
<p>which is four and five,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ve developed several</p>
<p>secondary sexual characteristics,</p>
<p>they might have hair growth</p>
<p>or starting to notice more beard growth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good time to do it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned with stature or height,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re not tracking along</p>
<p>where most members of your family have,</p>
<p>not just their height and stature,</p>
<p>but also the timing of their puberty,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s time to get labs.</p>
<p>Right, so if I could travel back in time,</p>
<p>I would have gotten my blood work done</p>
<p>for hormones and lipids and everything else at 18.</p>
<p>I unfortunately didn&rsquo;t know where and how to get that.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t have any pressing clinical issues.</p>
<p>And so I think the first time that I got my blood work done,</p>
<p>I was in my late 20s, maybe even my early 30s.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still dying to know what my blood work was</p>
<p>when, for instance, I was 17 and I felt a certain way.</p>
<p>And I confess that in many dimensions,</p>
<p>I actually feel better now, I&rsquo;ll be 47 soon,</p>
<p>at 47 than I did in my teens and 20s.</p>
<p>And I think it was more on the psychological side.</p>
<p>I think that, but in terms of just understanding</p>
<p>why we felt great or why we felt or feel terrible</p>
<p>or not so great, I think blood work</p>
<p>is extremely informative.</p>
<p>What do you think are the key things</p>
<p>to look for in blood work?</p>
<p>I mean, testosterone is always the topic that comes up</p>
<p>in the context of male hormone optimization,</p>
<p>but certainly there are a lot of other hormones</p>
<p>that are important as well.</p>
<p>And with testosterone, you want to get either testosterone</p>
<p>and SHBG or a free testosterone.</p>
<p>Could you define SHBG for our listeners, please?</p>
<p>It is sex hormone binding globulin.</p>
<p>It is the protein that binds up all androgens</p>
<p>and estrogen in the body.</p>
<p>So the stronger the androgen, the stronger it binds.</p>
<p>During puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT,</p>
<p>which is the strongest bioidentical androgen,</p>
<p>has a huge role, a prominent role</p>
<p>in secondary sexual characteristics.</p>
<p>And if your SHBG is very high,</p>
<p>then your DHT can run higher because it&rsquo;s not metabolized,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not quite as much free DHT.</p>
<p>So you want to balance between a high enough free DHT</p>
<p>and a high enough total DHT.</p>
<p>And obviously these blood tests are going to have</p>
<p>to be read and interpreted by a qualified physician.</p>
<p>Most people aren&rsquo;t going to be in a position</p>
<p>to evaluate them properly,</p>
<p>or at least not with the full depth that they could</p>
<p>if they had an MD like yourself looking at them.</p>
<p>Okay, so everyone should get blood work</p>
<p>as early as possible,</p>
<p>depending on their budget and availability.</p>
<p>What should everybody do in terms</p>
<p>of monitoring those markers?</p>
<p>So assuming that there&rsquo;s no major intervention,</p>
<p>how often do you recommend</p>
<p>that people get their blood work done?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, let&rsquo;s take an individual who just turned 18.</p>
<p>They just got their first set of blood work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll probably find something in it</p>
<p>that they may want to optimize</p>
<p>using shared decision-making with their physician.</p>
<p>Usually a good follow-up is about six months.</p>
<p>Okay, so twice a year getting blood work done</p>
<p>and having a physician evaluate it.</p>
<p>That sounds reasonable to me.</p>
<p>And for those that didn&rsquo;t initiate this at 18,</p>
<p>such as myself, I guess the best time to start then</p>
<p>would be as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In terms of the other things that all males should do,</p>
<p>meaning all males of all ages, puberty and beyond,</p>
<p>should do, what are some of those things?</p>
<p>So on a daily basis,</p>
<p>maybe you could just take us through the arc of a day</p>
<p>and push out some of the protocols that you use</p>
<p>or the things that you&rsquo;d like to see your male patients use</p>
<p>in order to try and optimize their hormone status.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll briefly touch on some of the lifestyle pillars to start.</p>
<p>Diet and exercise are the first two.</p>
<p>In puberty, sleep is particularly important, of course.</p>
<p>But with diet and exercise,</p>
<p>throughout a lifespan,</p>
<p>you want to not exclude things that are helping you.</p>
<p>For example, during puberty, if you&rsquo;re consuming dairy</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden you cut out all dairy,</p>
<p>dairy can help increase IGF-1 and free IGF-1.</p>
<p>And just again, for our audience,</p>
<p>maybe you just mentioned what having enough IGF-1</p>
<p>can do for us that&rsquo;s beneficial is?</p>
<p>It helps you grow.</p>
<p>It helps with genital development,</p>
<p>secondary sexual characteristics, and long bone growth,</p>
<p>skin growth, hair growth, a host of things.</p>
<p>So getting an array of nutrients that include dairy,</p>
<p>what other sorts of nutrients</p>
<p>are important during development?</p>
<p>You want to have adequate vitamin D.</p>
<p>Vitamin D helps with testosterone production.</p>
<p>It helps, again, with bone mineralization and stature.</p>
<p>After an age of about 25, and there&rsquo;s not a strict cutoff,</p>
<p>but up to about an age of 25,</p>
<p>optimizing your growth hormone and IGF-1</p>
<p>helps with bone density and bone growth.</p>
<p>So from the dietary standpoint,</p>
<p>you want to have enough free estrogen,</p>
<p>not too much when you&rsquo;re growing,</p>
<p>but you want to help basically stockpile bone</p>
<p>to prevent a risk of osteoporosis or thin bones fractures</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re older.</p>
<p>Well, as someone who broke his left foot five times</p>
<p>while in high school, I can say that whatever</p>
<p>young people can do to optimize their bone density</p>
<p>would be great.</p>
<p>That problem seems to have resolved itself over time,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, back then I was,</p>
<p>I did a short run as a vegetarian,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always been an omnivore.</p>
<p>I realized that some of this relates to ethics</p>
<p>and food allergies and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But would you say that on balance,</p>
<p>that most people would benefit from eating a combination</p>
<p>of quality proteins from animal sources</p>
<p>and non-animal sources, fruits, vegetables, and starches?</p>
<p>I mean, what do you think, for instance,</p>
<p>about people following a pure carnivore</p>
<p>or a very pure vegan diet in their 20s and 30s?</p>
<p>In their late 20s, it might be a reasonable option.</p>
<p>In early 20s and certainly teens,</p>
<p>it is a horrible idea because it is likely</p>
<p>to significantly decrease your free androgens.</p>
<p>So you will have less testosterone acting on receptors</p>
<p>through the body.</p>
<p>Are there any other micronutrients or macronutrients</p>
<p>that people in their 20s and 30s should emphasize?</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t really touched on fatty acids or fiber too much.</p>
<p>Fiber is going to be paramount in kind of like setting</p>
<p>your set point of your gut microbiome the rest of your life.</p>
<p>There is prebiotic fiber, which you could think of</p>
<p>as fish food for your good gut microbiome.</p>
<p>Your gut microbiome is kind of like an aquarium</p>
<p>or a fish tank.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just thinking about goldfish swimming around</p>
<p>and the goldfish eating people.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t eat goldfish, people.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Live or dead.</p>
<p>Yeah, but any fiber or food that you&rsquo;re putting in your gut,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either going to skew your gut microbiome</p>
<p>towards something that is more beneficial</p>
<p>or more detrimental.</p>
<p>And would you say that the prebiotic fiber</p>
<p>and getting essential fatty acids,</p>
<p>that would be important to do throughout the lifespan</p>
<p>or just for people in their 20s and 30s?</p>
<p>Throughout the lifespan, particularly important</p>
<p>in the teenage, 20s, 30s,</p>
<p>because it helps with brain development.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re certainly more of an expert than me</p>
<p>when it comes to brain development,</p>
<p>but it does continue to develop really throughout</p>
<p>the lifespan, but certainly through the 20s and 30s as well.</p>
<p>About taking a multivitamin while you&rsquo;re growing up,</p>
<p>so many people do that.</p>
<p>Is it necessary?</p>
<p>Is it useful?</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not necessary, is it safe to do anyway?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally safe to do anyway.</p>
<p>I do not think everybody needs a multivitamin.</p>
<p>The more exclusionary your diet is,</p>
<p>for example, if you have celiac disease</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re planning on fertility soon,</p>
<p>then perhaps it&rsquo;s more reasonable to take a multivitamin.</p>
<p>In a previous discussion of ours,</p>
<p>I asked you about caloric restriction and testosterone.</p>
<p>And if I recall correctly,</p>
<p>the idea was that if somebody is overweight,</p>
<p>they have excess fat, adipose tissue,</p>
<p>then getting rid of some of that adipose tissue</p>
<p>through caloric restriction and exercise,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s done not too fast in a healthy way,</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial for testosterone in the long run.</p>
<p>But that for individuals who are not carrying</p>
<p>an excess of body fat, caloric restriction</p>
<p>is actually going to lower testosterone.</p>
<p>First of all, do I have that correct?</p>
<p>And second, are there any addendums to that</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like to give us now?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>If you look at an individual in a caloric deficit,</p>
<p>several changes will happen.</p>
<p>One is that they&rsquo;ll have less building blocks for hormones.</p>
<p>Another is that they will be in a catabolic state more often</p>
<p>so that balance of anabolism and catabolism</p>
<p>will be different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll likely have less signaling</p>
<p>from growth hormone and IGF-1,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll also have the high SHBG</p>
<p>that we defined earlier as the binding protein,</p>
<p>so there are free androgens and free estrogens will go down.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Okay, so we touched on sleep being critical,</p>
<p>I would say, throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>Try and get enough quality sleep,</p>
<p>at least 80% of the nights of your life,</p>
<p>and the other 20% are just what happens</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s noise outside or you&rsquo;re stressed,</p>
<p>you have an exam or you&rsquo;re having a great time</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good reasons</p>
<p>to lose some sleep now and again as well.</p>
<p>But so we have sleep, we&rsquo;ve got nutrition,</p>
<p>and we touched on that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get back into supplementation.</p>
<p>Now, what are some of the other pillars</p>
<p>of creating the proper environment for hormone optimization?</p>
<p>Stress is probably the next one.</p>
<p>During both puberty, but also the 20s and 30s,</p>
<p>individuals are figuring out</p>
<p>how they want to cope with stress</p>
<p>and also figuring out what they want to choose</p>
<p>to put their effort into.</p>
<p>So if someone is overstressed,</p>
<p>then it can put all the other lifestyle pillars</p>
<p>and then they stop dieting well,</p>
<p>they stop exercising, and everything else can go askew.</p>
<p>There is also some degree of social component to this,</p>
<p>so perhaps I need to add a seventh pillar of social.</p>
<p>During your 20s and 30s,</p>
<p>you may be forming a family as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have children,</p>
<p>and the health of the family unit</p>
<p>is going to be vitally important.</p>
<p>Not necessarily directly for hormone optimization,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna throw everything else off if it&rsquo;s off.</p>
<p>And for people that are not starting their own families</p>
<p>in their 20s and 30s,</p>
<p>can that social connection be extended to friendships</p>
<p>and work relationships as well?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>In fact, if someone&rsquo;s not starting a family,</p>
<p>it is just as concerning, but for other reasons.</p>
<p>Each individual is gonna have</p>
<p>their close group of family and friends.</p>
<p>And if someone does not have one of those connections,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when things can potentially get bad,</p>
<p>not just for them individually, but also society.</p>
<p>So when you say stress,</p>
<p>you mean learn to manage your stress.</p>
<p>What does that look like?</p>
<p>I mean, if a patient has high blood pressure,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t, you just sense that they&rsquo;re stressed.</p>
<p>They have a lot of pressured speech,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not feeling well,</p>
<p>or communicating that they&rsquo;re not doing well.</p>
<p>What are some of the things that you recommend</p>
<p>in order to try and ameliorate that stress?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different mindfulness or relaxation techniques.</p>
<p>Going outside can often help with this as well.</p>
<p>Dietary changes and exercise can help with this too.</p>
<p>Some people like prayer or meditation.</p>
<p>And a lot of people like counseling or therapy,</p>
<p>or even just talking openly</p>
<p>with a family member or a friend.</p>
<p>What would be some of the other pillars</p>
<p>for hormone optimization?</p>
<p>Here, I feel like we&rsquo;re not just talking about people</p>
<p>in their 20s and 30s, but again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re wrapping our arms around basically puberty onward.</p>
<p>I mean, gosh, looking back,</p>
<p>I started meditating pretty early.</p>
<p>I started weight training and running early.</p>
<p>I gave some thought to my diet in high school,</p>
<p>but really it was in college that I started thinking more</p>
<p>about what I was ingesting and why,</p>
<p>and trying to do better there.</p>
<p>But people are coming to the table</p>
<p>at different stages of life</p>
<p>and trying to optimize for hormones.</p>
<p>So what would be some of the additional things</p>
<p>that everybody should do?</p>
<p>Everyone should get outside</p>
<p>and find a movement past time to last a lifetime.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get sunlight,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get some degree of heat and cold exposure,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re also just gonna move more.</p>
<p>Being in an artificial environment</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s artificial lights,</p>
<p>artificial air conditioning</p>
<p>is going to have many effects on your body.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s vital.</p>
<p>Another one is finding what your purpose is in life.</p>
<p>So I call this spirit,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really just the self-actualization component</p>
<p>of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs,</p>
<p>which is basically your physical needs, your mental needs,</p>
<p>and then your purpose in life, what you really like to do.</p>
<p>Picking some goal or target.</p>
<p>And I always say that you don&rsquo;t have to stick</p>
<p>to the same goal over time.</p>
<p>Certainly I haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>although I got started early in the science game</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still in it.</p>
<p>The idea is not to pick the end goal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to pick a goal.</p>
<p>And then once you reach that goal to assess</p>
<p>and then pick another goal and so on.</p>
<p>I think sometimes when people hear about picking a purpose,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, oh my goodness, I have to define,</p>
<p>sort of like naming oneself,</p>
<p>that you actually can change your goals</p>
<p>and purpose over time.</p>
<p>This is terrific.</p>
<p>Would you suggest that people actively use</p>
<p>or avoid supplementation</p>
<p>prior to doing all these other things?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody that likes to throw the kitchen sink at things,</p>
<p>but I also like to do things pretty systematically.</p>
<p>So I always say behaviors first,</p>
<p>then nutrition, then supplementation,</p>
<p>and then maybe, and if and only if there&rsquo;s a real need,</p>
<p>and of course working with a doctor, prescription drugs.</p>
<p>But there are probably people in their 20s or 30s,</p>
<p>maybe even in their 50s that aren&rsquo;t feeling great</p>
<p>and they want to do something</p>
<p>in order to be able to train more</p>
<p>or to feel more confident to seek out social connection.</p>
<p>They try and go about the whole business</p>
<p>from the other side as well.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>I see supplements and medications as very similar.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s prescribed and one&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>In general, medications have more side effects</p>
<p>or potentially stronger therapeutic with more efficacy,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just tools to reach an end goal.</p>
<p>So depending on the goal,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s an individual that&rsquo;s an athlete,</p>
<p>then certainly they should consider supplementation.</p>
<p>Or if someone desires optimal</p>
<p>or a very high level of cognitive performance,</p>
<p>they should also consider supplementation.</p>
<p>At the same time, food is medicine</p>
<p>and a lot of the benefits you can get in supplements,</p>
<p>you can get in food as well.</p>
<p>I guess it depends on how much time and energy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re willing to spend, and also finances.</p>
<p>You know, I know that when I was in college,</p>
<p>I could afford just a few supplements</p>
<p>and they were basically whey protein and some fish oil.</p>
<p>I was fortunate that I was pointing</p>
<p>in the direction of those things and some creatine.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t afford much else.</p>
<p>Over time, of course, I could afford more,</p>
<p>but it really does often depend on finances.</p>
<p>Before we get into some specific recommendations</p>
<p>to optimize testosterone, estrogen, thyroid,</p>
<p>growth hormone, et cetera,</p>
<p>I wanna ask you a question I&rsquo;ve been wondering about</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>You know, so often in the discussion</p>
<p>about male hormone optimization, people will say,</p>
<p>well, you know, if your libido is suffering,</p>
<p>you know, you might wanna be concerned about testosterone</p>
<p>or even estrogen, right?</p>
<p>Because we know that estrogen can impact libido as well.</p>
<p>Sometimes having estrogen too low</p>
<p>is detrimental for libido.</p>
<p>Or people will say, you&rsquo;re not recovering from workouts</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re feeling kind of depressed.</p>
<p>The problem is it&rsquo;s all subjective.</p>
<p>So how does one know whether or not</p>
<p>their recovery from workouts, their energy,</p>
<p>their confidence, their libido is within a healthy range?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously for people in a relationship,</p>
<p>they can know whether or not their libido matches</p>
<p>the sort of cadence of the relationship in their partner.</p>
<p>But how should people think about this?</p>
<p>And maybe even start to talk about it,</p>
<p>because one of the big differences I think</p>
<p>between males and females is that</p>
<p>because females have a monthly cycle,</p>
<p>they are familiar with the changes that occur</p>
<p>in their hormones over time.</p>
<p>Because every 28 days,</p>
<p>those hormones are changing dramatically</p>
<p>in ways that impact their physiology and psychology.</p>
<p>But for males, I feel like there&rsquo;s sort of a dearth</p>
<p>of language to get into the more subtle aspects of this.</p>
<p>It also has to do with privacy issues</p>
<p>and people feeling like they don&rsquo;t wanna overshare too much,</p>
<p>not knowing what&rsquo;s appropriate to share.</p>
<p>But when you talk to a patient who&rsquo;s in their 30s</p>
<p>or maybe even their 70s or 60s, doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>a male patient, what are you listening for?</p>
<p>And I know you&rsquo;re not a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>but what are your ears tuned to</p>
<p>in order to try and figure out</p>
<p>whether or not this person could really use some help</p>
<p>with hormone optimization or whether or not something else,</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;re just doing great and they don&rsquo;t realize it</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re placing demands on themselves</p>
<p>that are excessive?</p>
<p>You wanna use a lot of open-ended questions.</p>
<p>This process is called motivational interviewing.</p>
<p>And your goal is to listen to the patient</p>
<p>and not plant an idea in their mind that they can follow.</p>
<p>Because everybody is going to have a different goal.</p>
<p>Some people are better at reading their biofeedback</p>
<p>or telling how they feel on a daily basis.</p>
<p>There is screening questionnaires designed,</p>
<p>for example, an ADAM questionnaire</p>
<p>to look at men&rsquo;s health and hormone-related health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called an ADAM questionnaire?</p>
<p>ADAM questionnaire.</p>
<p>A-D-A-M?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Is it available online</p>
<p>that people could administer it to themselves?</p>
<p>Although we don&rsquo;t want people making clinical diagnoses</p>
<p>of themselves or anyone else.</p>
<p>Is it that sort of exam?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it is a clinically validated tool</p>
<p>like an ASCVD,</p>
<p>which is like a risk of heart attack and stroke tool</p>
<p>or many other tools.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one for depression.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one for anxiety.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called PHQ-9 and GAD-7, respectively.</p>
<p>But anyway, there&rsquo;s often an in the ADAM questionnaire</p>
<p>and what you hear from the patient,</p>
<p>if you are a very careful listener, is often different.</p>
<p>Can you give me an example of some of the questions</p>
<p>on this ADAM questionnaire</p>
<p>or the sorts of motivational interviewing that you might do?</p>
<p>So say I&rsquo;m your patient, we sit down,</p>
<p>what sorts of questions would you ask</p>
<p>to probe these kinds of dimensions of hormones?</p>
<p>Questions about libido,</p>
<p>questions about athletic performance,</p>
<p>questions about motivation.</p>
<p>And often the patient will answer one thing,</p>
<p>but what you hear from them subjectively is far different.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Can you give me an example of a question?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to be the guinea pig here.</p>
<p>A classic one is a guy comes in</p>
<p>and a lot of times they say,</p>
<p>oh no, the wife made me go to the doctor.</p>
<p>I go, once a year, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any medications.</p>
<p>Their screening questionnaires might be zeros</p>
<p>across the board.</p>
<p>So nothing, no issues.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re apparently in perfect health.</p>
<p>They talk to you for a while.</p>
<p>They get some rapport.</p>
<p>They like you.</p>
<p>And then right as you&rsquo;re finishing up the visit</p>
<p>and about to go out the room,</p>
<p>they mentioned that their libido isn&rsquo;t quite there</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re having a little bit of ED as well.</p>
<p>And perhaps they&rsquo;re even having</p>
<p>some chest pressure tightness.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So right as you&rsquo;re leaving the room,</p>
<p>a patient will tell you</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re having some sexual side effects</p>
<p>or not side effects,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re having some sexual challenges.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll mention chest pressure.</p>
<p>Is the chest pressure a sort of general decoy</p>
<p>for it&rsquo;s gotta be my heart</p>
<p>or is it related to the other things they&rsquo;re reporting?</p>
<p>It can be related.</p>
<p>In fact, erectile dysfunction</p>
<p>is known as the canary in the coal mine.</p>
<p>So coal miners would take the canary down</p>
<p>and the canary would die before the coal miners would have,</p>
<p>I believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>And often one of the causes of ED is plaque buildup,</p>
<p>which can happen in the coronaries as well.</p>
<p>But sometimes they notice the symptom</p>
<p>in the genitals before they do in the coronaries.</p>
<p>So for such a patient,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that patient was a young person</p>
<p>where plaque buildup in the arteries and veins</p>
<p>is not all that likely</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re let&rsquo;s say in their 20s or 30s,</p>
<p>what would be your next step of the interview at that point?</p>
<p>And what would you consider?</p>
<p>Would you immediately order labs for that person</p>
<p>to try and rule out any kind of</p>
<p>actual hormone level deficiency?</p>
<p>I certainly would order labs.</p>
<p>There are some individuals that are very similar</p>
<p>and they come in and they have the same symptoms.</p>
<p>And one individual might have a very, very high testosterone</p>
<p>and one individual might be severely hypogonadal.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a big difference between the subjective</p>
<p>and what the labs look like.</p>
<p>So I certainly order labs.</p>
<p>You also ask them about if it&rsquo;s situational or not.</p>
<p>You ask them if they have ED,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re asking about their habits,</p>
<p>you even ask about porn and masturbation</p>
<p>and all these issues.</p>
<p>And of course it&rsquo;s between the doctor and the patient.</p>
<p>And depending on what they tell you,</p>
<p>you can often determine if there is a situational component.</p>
<p>Some people call it psychogenic ED,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t love the term psychogenic ED</p>
<p>because it kind of puts some blame on the patient&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>But a lot of the time that is the case.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even a test, and this is very rarely ordered,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s called a nocturnal penile tumescence.</p>
<p>Yeah, because is it true that there are</p>
<p>periodic erections during sleep, correct?</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>So you basically put a cuff to see</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re having a normal sized erection during sleep.</p>
<p>And I believe about 90% of the time they do that test,</p>
<p>they are indeed having erections.</p>
<p>Which would point to this psychogenic origin</p>
<p>of whatever challenges they&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>in terms of sexual interactions.</p>
<p>You mentioned porn and masturbation.</p>
<p>This topic has come up a bunch of times on this podcast</p>
<p>and on other podcasts I&rsquo;ve gone on</p>
<p>because of the relationship between dopamine,</p>
<p>sexual motivation, and sexual behavior.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been of the pretty strong stance that</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m not judging porn or masturbation,</p>
<p>it can create a brain wiring situation</p>
<p>where males in particular essentially teach their brain</p>
<p>to be aroused by watching other people have sex</p>
<p>as opposed to being the first person actor</p>
<p>in sexual interactions.</p>
<p>So in that sense, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more about the brain wiring</p>
<p>and neuroplasticity and dopamine,</p>
<p>but what are your thoughts on porn and masturbation</p>
<p>as they relate to hormones?</p>
<p>I mean, this is a big debate on the internet.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the most common debates</p>
<p>is whether or not masturbation increases</p>
<p>or decreases testosterone in males.</p>
<p>Certainly it will decrease motivation</p>
<p>to go find sexual partners.</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>And there are more and more data on this all the time.</p>
<p>In terms of the effects of pornography and masturbation,</p>
<p>and here I suppose we need to be somewhat specific</p>
<p>and operationally define what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about porn and masturbation</p>
<p>to the point of ejaculation.</p>
<p>Because my understanding is that the ejaculation</p>
<p>and orgasm associated with it</p>
<p>causes an increase in prolactin,</p>
<p>which blunts libido for some period of time.</p>
<p>The duration of that will vary from person to person</p>
<p>and circumstance to circumstance.</p>
<p>But basically all of this points to the fact</p>
<p>that porn and masturbation can really limit libido</p>
<p>in the real world.</p>
<p>And to me, pornography and the screen</p>
<p>is not the real world.</p>
<p>Screens exist in the real world.</p>
<p>The real world doesn&rsquo;t exist in the screen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an accurate statement.</p>
<p>And prolactin does have a significant acute increase</p>
<p>after ejaculation.</p>
<p>It does to some degree after orgasm as well,</p>
<p>but prolactin acts on the pituitary</p>
<p>to inhibit the release of the hormones LH and FSH,</p>
<p>of which LH can increase testosterone.</p>
<p>So this may be one of the cases</p>
<p>where the dose makes the poison.</p>
<p>And if it is a very frequent habit,</p>
<p>certainly daily or more than once a day</p>
<p>would be very detrimental from a hormonal component,</p>
<p>not even taking into account the neural wiring.</p>
<p>Listen, I think it&rsquo;s terrific</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve actually defined frequency</p>
<p>because this is the problem.</p>
<p>On the internet or even in the doctor&rsquo;s office,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see descriptions about pornography being dangerous</p>
<p>for certain things or detrimental to hormones.</p>
<p>People say frequent, but what&rsquo;s frequent?</p>
<p>So you were saying daily or multiple times per day</p>
<p>would be potentially detrimental</p>
<p>to the hormone profile of a male of essentially any age.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just for masturbation.</p>
<p>With pornography, with porn use as well,</p>
<p>it would likely be worse.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Just the sort of dopaminergic drive of the stimulus,</p>
<p>just a really intense visual stimulus?</p>
<p>Dopamine sensitivity.</p>
<p>I think that using the analogy of a dopamine wave pool,</p>
<p>it would deepen the pool,</p>
<p>but not increase your supply of dopamine.</p>
<p>Maybe you could describe the dopamine wave pool</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s such a powerful way</p>
<p>of thinking about dopamine and what dopamine does.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve always credited you when I&rsquo;ve done it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve generally stolen your analogy</p>
<p>of the dopamine wave pool because it&rsquo;s so astute.</p>
<p>The dopamine wave pool describes the natural variation</p>
<p>of ups and downs in your dopamine or your motivation.</p>
<p>And in the wave pool, depending on how high the peak is,</p>
<p>you often have a deeper trough.</p>
<p>So you do not want too high of a peak.</p>
<p>In addition, if your peak is very, very high,</p>
<p>for example, when you&rsquo;re using many substances</p>
<p>like cocaine or like amphetamines,</p>
<p>your dopamine can go so high,</p>
<p>you lose almost all the water from the wave pool.</p>
<p>And then when you crash from that,</p>
<p>not only is the trough low,</p>
<p>you have less dopamine in the pool to begin with.</p>
<p>The dopamine receptor is extremely sensitive</p>
<p>as is the GABA receptor, which is an inhibitory receptor.</p>
<p>Whereas dopamine is technically a stimulant</p>
<p>more related to adrenaline or noradrenaline.</p>
<p>The depth of the pool can change very quick.</p>
<p>So you wanna have that happy medium</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re fairly near the top,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not so near the top</p>
<p>that the depth of the pool is gonna go down.</p>
<p>So if I interpret that in the context of this discussion</p>
<p>about libido, sex, porn, and masturbation,</p>
<p>if somebody has a very intense sexual experience,</p>
<p>here we&rsquo;re not necessarily talking about an intense orgasm,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about just a lot of intense visual.</p>
<p>So a lot of intense imagery or auditory input or both,</p>
<p>that is going to lead to a situation</p>
<p>where dopamine is going to be depleted afterwards.</p>
<p>A guest on this podcast before,</p>
<p>my colleague at Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an expert in addiction,</p>
<p>talked a bit about this as sort of a seesawing.</p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;re talking about a wave</p>
<p>and a crashing out of the water from the wave pool there.</p>
<p>It was a seesawing from pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a longer and deeper period</p>
<p>of lack of pleasure following that.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of people think, oh, well, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>They want the intense experience.</p>
<p>But if that intense experience is coming</p>
<p>from pornography and masturbation,</p>
<p>or I suppose coming from high adrenaline activities</p>
<p>like life-risking parkour</p>
<p>hanging off the side of a building,</p>
<p>it inevitably is going to lead to depressive episodes,</p>
<p>low libido episodes that follow.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>In a similar physiologic way</p>
<p>to withdrawal from stimulants like amphetamines.</p>
<p>Now, is sex with a partner different?</p>
<p>Because there are many people</p>
<p>who are chasing more and more intense experiences</p>
<p>with a partner as opposed to</p>
<p>through pornography and masturbation.</p>
<p>Again, here we&rsquo;re talking about all ages.</p>
<p>And I should always say,</p>
<p>anytime we&rsquo;re talking about sex with a partner,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking, the four conditions</p>
<p>that I always lay out on the Human Lab podcast</p>
<p>are that we&rsquo;re talking about consensual,</p>
<p>age-appropriate, context-appropriate,</p>
<p>species-appropriate interactions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this is also a case where the dose makes the poison.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>obviously meeting all those criteria,</p>
<p>if they have one preference</p>
<p>that for both of them is a positive experience,</p>
<p>then that is likely okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to be able to maintain dopamine</p>
<p>over a certain threshold for a long period of time.</p>
<p>So there very well may be a crash</p>
<p>from that experience as well.</p>
<p>And the crash may be different</p>
<p>in one partner than the other.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ll draw an analogy to food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be like, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to serve the banquet meal</p>
<p>seven nights of the week, maybe just two.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>And there are other delicious foods out there.</p>
<p>Can we use that analogy?</p>
<p>That is very reasonable.</p>
<p>Okay, not trying to be PG-13,</p>
<p>just trying to parsimony,</p>
<p>Occam&rsquo;s razor,</p>
<p>the ability to describe a lot of things in a few words.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to return to the key things that people should do,</p>
<p>or I should say the key things</p>
<p>that men should do to optimize their hormones.</p>
<p>So we talked about getting some movement,</p>
<p>getting some sunlight,</p>
<p>getting quality social connection one way or the other,</p>
<p>avoid excessively frequent masturbation</p>
<p>and viewing pornography.</p>
<p>And for some people,</p>
<p>zero might be the optimal number.</p>
<p>And I keep coming back to this-</p>
<p>For most people.</p>
<p>For most people, interesting.</p>
<p>I feel so fortunate to have grown up</p>
<p>prior to the availability of internet pornography.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a big consumer of pornography.</p>
<p>It just not been my thing,</p>
<p>but I hear so often from males of all ages</p>
<p>about their addiction to it, their affliction by it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a serious issue.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m grateful</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re willing to talk about this</p>
<p>in your clinical experience with these patients.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>In terms of exercise, you know, here&rsquo;s, again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it&rsquo;s great to get exercise,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m familiar with, you know, if I train an hour a day,</p>
<p>you know, 10 minutes of warmup</p>
<p>and 50 minutes to an hour of weight training</p>
<p>or 50 minutes to an hour of cardio, I feel great,</p>
<p>especially if once a week I take a complete day off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of my general schedule.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also familiar with when I go out</p>
<p>for runs that are excessively long, two-hour runs,</p>
<p>or I spend 90 minutes in the gym too frequently,</p>
<p>I start to feel like garbage.</p>
<p>Everything suffers.</p>
<p>My sleep starts to suffer.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much I eat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t seem to recover.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel well.</p>
<p>So I realize that recovery ability varies</p>
<p>between individuals, but what do you think</p>
<p>is a healthy, sustainable exercise regimen</p>
<p>that anyone can follow</p>
<p>that will also support their hormone status?</p>
<p>For really vigorous exercise,</p>
<p>around three to four times a week</p>
<p>is very sustainable over a long period of time.</p>
<p>On top of that, you could add in three or four more instances</p>
<p>of less vigorous exercise.</p>
<p>Okay, so for less vigorous,</p>
<p>what do you mean that, you know, zone two cardio</p>
<p>where you can hold a conversation,</p>
<p>but beyond which you can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>And for more vigorous, you&rsquo;re thinking weight training</p>
<p>or high-intensity interval-type training?</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>You can also weight train and have some benefit</p>
<p>even at a low to moderate intensity.</p>
<p>If you think about weight training where you have,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not necessarily related to the incidence of DOMS,</p>
<p>which is delayed onset muscle soreness,</p>
<p>but if you weight train lazy or easy from time to time,</p>
<p>obviously you wanna weight train very heavy</p>
<p>from time to time as well</p>
<p>because of more lean body mass growth.</p>
<p>But if you weight train lighter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be able to do it more often.</p>
<p>And it can still help with the hypertrophy of collagen,</p>
<p>for example, in tendons and ligaments.</p>
<p>So here again, I&rsquo;d like to perhaps drill into this notion</p>
<p>of intensity and lightweights,</p>
<p>because for me, some of the most brutal workouts</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever done were in what I would consider</p>
<p>a high repetition range, 15 to 50.</p>
<p>Actually, I went up to Oregon</p>
<p>to watch the International Track and Field Championships.</p>
<p>We went by Cameron Haynes&rsquo; place, the Cameron Haynes,</p>
<p>and he and his trainer put us through a workout</p>
<p>that was 25 to 50 repetitions per set,</p>
<p>and it was done in circuit and it was brutal.</p>
<p>So it was light.</p>
<p>I mean, those weights were nothing.</p>
<p>In some cases it was body weight,</p>
<p>but the number of repetitions was brutal.</p>
<p>So when you say limiting intensity,</p>
<p>are you talking about limiting the number of sets to failure?</p>
<p>Are you talking about really being</p>
<p>kind of a lazy bear in the gym?</p>
<p>I like to do that every once in a long, long rest,</p>
<p>that sort of thing.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on that</p>
<p>as it relates to hormone optimization?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll just mention, and then I&rsquo;ll let you answer.</p>
<p>I feel best overall when I&rsquo;m training</p>
<p>for 10 minute warmups and about 45 or 50 minutes</p>
<p>of weight training where I&rsquo;m pretty lazy between sets,</p>
<p>two to three minute rest,</p>
<p>training somewhere in the six to 10 rep range,</p>
<p>going to failure every once in a while,</p>
<p>but mostly getting that sort of last rep</p>
<p>before what I would think is failure.</p>
<p>No four straps, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And then jogging on the other days, nice and easy.</p>
<p>When I do that,</p>
<p>I feel fantastic in all other dimensions of life.</p>
<p>When I train more intensely than that,</p>
<p>even with lightweight, so faster cadence and lower rest,</p>
<p>I feel like garbage.</p>
<p>I get a headache, I&rsquo;m kind of ornery, everything suffers.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on kind of defining</p>
<p>a optimal exercise strategy for hormones?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never measured my hormones</p>
<p>in those two different contexts,</p>
<p>but I have to imagine that it&rsquo;s cortisol related.</p>
<p>When they study the effect of exercise,</p>
<p>specifically vigorous exercise,</p>
<p>one area that&rsquo;s been studied is vigorous exercise episodes</p>
<p>lasting longer than an hour.</p>
<p>And they usually track it by a rating of perceived exertion,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t perfect and it&rsquo;s not extremely actionable,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s helpful for clinical science.</p>
<p>But the takeaway from that is basically do not,</p>
<p>it is not hormonally helpful to train,</p>
<p>especially regularly train vigorously</p>
<p>for longer than an hour.</p>
<p>Great, so I&rsquo;m happy to hear that</p>
<p>because it sounds like for most people</p>
<p>that hours of work is really the threshold.</p>
<p>I think this is important for people to hear,</p>
<p>especially males,</p>
<p>because I think with all of the incredible examples</p>
<p>out there of people like Cam, like David Goggins,</p>
<p>people who are training for very long periods of time,</p>
<p>and leaving aside all issues of what people are doing</p>
<p>in order to optimize the recovery,</p>
<p>I think an hour a day of exercise is just a great program</p>
<p>that most anyone can follow.</p>
<p>And beyond an hour, you start running into challenges.</p>
<p>And the occasional 90 minute or two hour workout</p>
<p>is no big deal.</p>
<p>But if you start doing that more than once every two months,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re headed for trouble.</p>
<p>Have you seen that in people&rsquo;s blood work</p>
<p>and in their hormones?</p>
<p>Do you ever see people that are just badly over-trained</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just training too hard and too often?</p>
<p>Yes, when the blood work is particularly bad,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re often in a large caloric deficit as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a synergistic effect between a caloric deficit.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re maintaining adequate protein intake,</p>
<p>you might not be maintaining adequate iron intake</p>
<p>or adequate vitamin D.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re also just literally in a caloric deficit,</p>
<p>perhaps low carbs as well, very low free testosterone.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re simultaneously doing a lot of vigorous exercise.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I often hear, and I&rsquo;m starting to wonder whether or not</p>
<p>some of the quicker to results nutrition tactics,</p>
<p>things like dropping all carbohydrates,</p>
<p>or the quicker to results exercise habits,</p>
<p>starting to do six day a week, really intense workouts,</p>
<p>whether or not in the short run they work</p>
<p>because they cause the cosmetic changes</p>
<p>that people are seeking,</p>
<p>but that they really undermine the overall goal,</p>
<p>which is at least to me to have your hormones</p>
<p>maybe not optimized to the 100%,</p>
<p>but to always be aiming for 100%</p>
<p>and be close to it at every stage of life.</p>
<p>Consistency is key here.</p>
<p>If you are not consistent,</p>
<p>then the law of diminishing returns certainly applies.</p>
<p>So 80 or 90% of the benefit over many, many months</p>
<p>is far better than 100%, but only half the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, one thing that I&rsquo;ve found to be tremendously useful</p>
<p>is to finish the workout while I still have energy,</p>
<p>to not take myself to exhaustion.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m able to kind of talk about</p>
<p>the dopamine wave pool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to sort of ride that into the rest of the day,</p>
<p>feeling great.</p>
<p>I sort of save or bank some of the vigor from the training</p>
<p>to bring it into my work.</p>
<p>But then again, I&rsquo;m not an athlete.</p>
<p>I get paid to think and to speak,</p>
<p>not to lift weights or to run.</p>
<p>Another component of that is the balance</p>
<p>between your sympathetic,</p>
<p>which is your fight or flight nervous system,</p>
<p>and your parasympathetic,</p>
<p>which is your rest or digest nervous system.</p>
<p>There is an anecdote which is likely true</p>
<p>that many elite bodybuilders are very parasympathetic</p>
<p>besides while they&rsquo;re lifting weights.</p>
<p>You mean they&rsquo;re lazy and they like to eat a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The lazy bear in the gym kind of phenomenon.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But that being said,</p>
<p>after a very, very vigorous workout,</p>
<p>for example, one where you&rsquo;re trained to failure,</p>
<p>which bodybuilders and power lifters do all the time,</p>
<p>you feel the tiredness or you feel the strain</p>
<p>from that heavy sympathetic activity</p>
<p>when you are lifting a heavy weight.</p>
<p>And it can potentially affect</p>
<p>how you feel the rest of the day.</p>
<p>So many people who have a job that is highly cognitive</p>
<p>do not like to have an extremely vigorous workout</p>
<p>in the morning,</p>
<p>which is when a lot of people are able to exercise.</p>
<p>When I exercise early in the morning,</p>
<p>that is before 9 a.m.,</p>
<p>I have more energy all day long.</p>
<p>If I do it mid-morning,</p>
<p>I have experienced more of an afternoon crash.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably some circadian biology in there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also noticed,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve actually seen in my blood work,</p>
<p>that if I don&rsquo;t get out for a 45-minute jog</p>
<p>at least once a week,</p>
<p>all of my blood profiles suffer in the direction</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t want them to go.</p>
<p>In particular, testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>move in directions that are not conducive to my goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the approaches</p>
<p>that people can use in order to optimize hormones.</p>
<p>And these days, for better or for worse,</p>
<p>I think for worse,</p>
<p>younger guys are asking about</p>
<p>and using testosterone replacement therapy, so-called TRT.</p>
<p>And I just want to frame this up by saying</p>
<p>there is no strict cutoff for what is TRT.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people whose blood levels</p>
<p>of testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>are within the normal reference range</p>
<p>and decide to start doing these things.</p>
<p>Of course, they can limit fertility.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of issues,</p>
<p>even at non-quote-unquote steroidal</p>
<p>performance-enhancing dosages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to frame this up by first defining our terms,</p>
<p>because one of the challenges on the internet</p>
<p>is people talk about TRT,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll talk about performance-enhancing drugs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll talk about steroids.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all steroids, right?</p>
<p>I mean, testosterone and estrogen are both steroid hormones.</p>
<p>But what one considered replacement therapy</p>
<p>versus what one considers performance-enhancing</p>
<p>is going to depend, right?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my question.</p>
<p>Why in the world, why in the world</p>
<p>would any male in his teens or 20s</p>
<p>or even 30s whose blood levels of testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>are at the appropriate levels,</p>
<p>meaning within the normal reference range,</p>
<p>why would they take exogenous testosterone</p>
<p>given all the negative effects on fertility,</p>
<p>some of the challenges that it can present</p>
<p>if the dosages aren&rsquo;t quite right, et cetera?</p>
<p>Why would they do that,</p>
<p>certainly if they are not being paid</p>
<p>for a particular endeavor,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re not making money.</p>
<p>If they are playing a sport,</p>
<p>chances are they&rsquo;re not allowed to do that anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the banned substances list.</p>
<p>So to me, it just seems like a crazy idea.</p>
<p>But then again, I&rsquo;m of a generation</p>
<p>that really hasn&rsquo;t thought about doing that stuff</p>
<p>until people were in their 40s and 50s or even never.</p>
<p>So is there ever a case for somebody in their 20s or 30s</p>
<p>to take testosterone if their blood levels</p>
<p>are within the 300 to 900 nanograms</p>
<p>per deciliter reference range?</p>
<p>Not many cases.</p>
<p>The reason for any performance-enhancing drug,</p>
<p>whether or not it is a steroid, synthetic,</p>
<p>bioidentical or otherwise, it varies a lot.</p>
<p>Some individuals do it only for cosmetic reasons,</p>
<p>even if it can have deleterious effects</p>
<p>on the cosmetic appearance, for example,</p>
<p>of your skin in the long run.</p>
<p>But everyone has their different reason</p>
<p>as far as when does the benefit outweigh the detriment.</p>
<p>Not very often if you&rsquo;re in your 20s</p>
<p>and certainly almost hardly never.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always rare cases like Kalman syndrome</p>
<p>and whatnot, but almost never if you&rsquo;re very young.</p>
<p>Okay, so for people in their 20s, 30s and beyond,</p>
<p>40s, et cetera, whose testosterone and estrogen levels</p>
<p>are at the appropriate ratios</p>
<p>and within the normal reference range</p>
<p>and they feel pretty good, right?</p>
<p>We talked about the Adams Exam</p>
<p>or this sort of like feel pretty good</p>
<p>as sort of code for libido, energy recovery, et cetera,</p>
<p>are feeling at least workable for their lifestyle.</p>
<p>For those people, what can they do besides get great sleep,</p>
<p>train but not too hard or too often, et cetera, et cetera?</p>
<p>What are some of the things in the realm of supplementation</p>
<p>that can help them optimize their testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>without suppressing their own endogenous production</p>
<p>of testosterone and estrogen?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s mention creatine as the first one.</p>
<p>Creatine is interesting</p>
<p>because it has multiple different effects.</p>
<p>It helps with amino acid synthesis.</p>
<p>It also helps with oxidative stress.</p>
<p>It can also serve as the backup fuel tank</p>
<p>for your mitochondria.</p>
<p>So kind of holding backup ATP</p>
<p>and it does slightly increase total testosterone</p>
<p>and it also increases the conversion of testosterone</p>
<p>to dihydrotestosterone.</p>
<p>So potentially it&rsquo;s especially useful in men</p>
<p>in even their teenage years and their 20s.</p>
<p>You mentioned the conversion of testosterone</p>
<p>to dihydrotestosterone and there is mythology out there</p>
<p>that creatine can increase hair loss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing because there&rsquo;s at least one study</p>
<p>showing that creatine can increase DHT,</p>
<p>dihydrotestosterone and DHT is one of the primary hormones</p>
<p>that can promote male pattern baldness.</p>
<p>So the question therefore is,</p>
<p>does creatine supplementation</p>
<p>increase the rate of hair loss?</p>
<p>Theoretically it can, but in each individual,</p>
<p>preventing hair loss is a very poor reason to take creatine</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not going to take you</p>
<p>to a supraphysiologic level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to increase your androgens</p>
<p>to an unnormal level of binding.</p>
<p>So I feel like if that was a reason</p>
<p>to not take creatine for hair loss, then that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Sorry, you mean hair loss is not a reason</p>
<p>to avoid taking creatine?</p>
<p>Correct, hair loss is not a reason to avoid taking creatine.</p>
<p>Think of it as just bringing you</p>
<p>to what you are naturally inclined to have.</p>
<p>If your conversion of testosterone to DHT is already high,</p>
<p>then often creatine does not affect this.</p>
<p>It just kind of resets your balance</p>
<p>between testosterone being aromatized to estrogen</p>
<p>or being 5-alpha reduced DHT.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not going to speed up hair loss</p>
<p>more than just naturally being a male does.</p>
<p>So in some individuals, it will have no effect.</p>
<p>In some individuals, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>they have almost no 5-alpha reductase activity.</p>
<p>It will return them to natural or normal.</p>
<p>I see, well, I take five grams a day</p>
<p>of creatine monohydrate.</p>
<p>I do it for the tissue voluminizing effects,</p>
<p>for exercise benefits, but also for the cognitive effects.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s increasing my hair loss.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve got a little bit</p>
<p>of sort of a widow&rsquo;s peak type hair loss.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it is for me.</p>
<p>I suppose beard growth is associated with DHT too.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>What I learned, but then again,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been into this literature in a long time,</p>
<p>is that because of differences in receptors</p>
<p>that DHT causes hair growth on the face</p>
<p>and hair loss on the head.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yes, and the amount and the sensitivity</p>
<p>and density of those receptors is genetically determined.</p>
<p>And is it true that if your mother&rsquo;s father was bald,</p>
<p>that you will be bald in the same pattern?</p>
<p>And if that he wasn&rsquo;t, you won&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>That is a decent correlation.</p>
<p>Part of the proposed mechanism of this,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s several genes</p>
<p>and you can actually test your genes for hair loss.</p>
<p>You do get a decent amount of them from your mother.</p>
<p>The unique thing you get from your mother</p>
<p>that she may have gotten from her father,</p>
<p>that she got one of the copies from her father</p>
<p>is your X chromosome.</p>
<p>And the androgen receptor gene is on your X chromosome.</p>
<p>So all men got their androgen receptor gene</p>
<p>from their mother.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on their X chromosome, not on the Y chromosome.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Even though all of the sort of,</p>
<p>quote unquote, male promoting genes are on the Y chromosome,</p>
<p>like mullerian inhibiting, et cetera.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, so five grams a day of creatine</p>
<p>for most people should be fine.</p>
<p>Beneficial for tissue voluminizing.</p>
<p>So strength, bringing water into the muscles</p>
<p>and for the cognitive effects</p>
<p>and the clinical support for creatine,</p>
<p>I think is quite strong at the five gram per day dosage.</p>
<p>What other sorts of supplements can people benefit from?</p>
<p>We already talked about the omegas</p>
<p>and making sure that people are getting enough</p>
<p>prebiotic fiber to support the gut microbiome and vitamin D.</p>
<p>So what other supplement-based tools can people consider?</p>
<p>Another one we can loop in with creatine is betaine.</p>
<p>Some people are non-responders to creatine.</p>
<p>So you can increase that to 10 grams</p>
<p>or you can use its cousin betaine</p>
<p>to help with amino acid synthesis and shunting of energy.</p>
<p>Along with that, I would put L-carnitine,</p>
<p>which is actually the smallest peptide hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just two amino acids that are put together.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hormone.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not challenging it.</p>
<p>Peptides.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would call it a peptide more than a hormone.</p>
<p>So I would not call L-carnitine a hormone,</p>
<p>but I would call dopamine a hormone.</p>
<p>Yeah, a neuro hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to define things as transmitters</p>
<p>or hormones at some level.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>So L-carnitine, actually I should backtrack.</p>
<p>Betaine, do you recall what dosage</p>
<p>people typically would take</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re a creatine non-responder?</p>
<p>One to three grams per day.</p>
<p>Yeah, several versions of creatine have betaine mixed in</p>
<p>because it helps with the processing</p>
<p>of methionine and homocysteine.</p>
<p>So if somebody is already taking creatine</p>
<p>and likes it and responds to it,</p>
<p>I would raise my hand, such as myself.</p>
<p>Would adding betaine help</p>
<p>or is it redundant with creatine?</p>
<p>Only if their homocysteine is persistently elevated.</p>
<p>And homocysteine is kind of like an inflammatory marker</p>
<p>that can build up if you&rsquo;re not converting</p>
<p>enough of it downstream.</p>
<p>How would I know?</p>
<p>Just a blood test.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Or if you knew your MTHFR polymorphism,</p>
<p>which is basically how you add methyl groups</p>
<p>to many things in the body.</p>
<p>Great, any side effects of betaine</p>
<p>that people should be aware of?</p>
<p>Not that I know of.</p>
<p>Okay, people can look it up</p>
<p>and examine.com is a great site for that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll surely list it.</p>
<p>They just revamped their site, by the way,</p>
<p>and it was awesome before and it&rsquo;s platinum now.</p>
<p>So L-carnitine, what are the ways to take L-carnitine?</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s an oral form,</p>
<p>so capsules and there&rsquo;s injectables.</p>
<p>Injectables, I think you need a prescription,</p>
<p>is that right?</p>
<p>Correct, you need a prescription for the injectables</p>
<p>or you should really get a prescription for the injectables.</p>
<p>When you inject it, of course,</p>
<p>at the supervision of your doctor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually done intramuscularly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an aqueous solution,</p>
<p>so it does not have like an oil or a carrier oil in it</p>
<p>like testosterone esters do.</p>
<p>However, if you inject it too superficially,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna make or break anything.</p>
<p>Often it just burns if you inject it subcutaneously</p>
<p>and it does not disseminate throughout the body as well.</p>
<p>L-carnitine potentially has localized effects</p>
<p>if you inject it.</p>
<p>If you ingest it orally,</p>
<p>then it has a very low bioavailability, maybe only 10%.</p>
<p>Well, I think most people are going to be able</p>
<p>to get L-carnitine only in its capsule form.</p>
<p>So what are the dosages of L-carnitine</p>
<p>that one needs to ingest then if they wanna get a benefit</p>
<p>because if only 10% is being absorbed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably a lot of L-carnitine.</p>
<p>How much should people take per day?</p>
<p>Usually I recommend for oral L-carnitine</p>
<p>between 1,000 milligrams and up to four or 5,000 milligrams.</p>
<p>So one to four, maybe even five grams.</p>
<p>Correct, up to five grams a day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on that much,</p>
<p>especially if you have a dysregulated gut microbiome,</p>
<p>you should be concerned with TMAO,</p>
<p>which is a potential carcinogen</p>
<p>that both carnitine and choline can convert into.</p>
<p>And your gut microbiota determine how much that happens.</p>
<p>Is it true that I can offset any negative effects</p>
<p>of alpha-GPC choline, that is N-L-carnitine,</p>
<p>that I take by ingesting garlic?</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a compound in garlic called allicin.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s A-L-L-I-C-I-N.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also part of the scientific name,</p>
<p>the genus of types of garlic.</p>
<p>And this can help decrease the conversion to TMAO.</p>
<p>Berberine actually slightly decreases</p>
<p>the conversion to TMAO as well,</p>
<p>probably through alteration of the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>And then just optimizing your gut microbiome</p>
<p>can decrease conversion.</p>
<p>So not everyone needs allicin,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that you should certainly consider</p>
<p>if you were on a high dose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to continue to take the 600 milligrams of garlic</p>
<p>every time I take my L-carnitine,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to skip the berberine</p>
<p>because berberine gives me brutal headaches</p>
<p>and it makes me crave carbohydrates</p>
<p>because it drops my blood sugar.</p>
<p>It has many other effects, including the dawn phenomenon,</p>
<p>where it drops your blood sugar when you&rsquo;re sleeping</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t even realize it.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of berberine,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sorry for those of you that are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to offend anyone,</p>
<p>although frankly, if you&rsquo;re being offended</p>
<p>by my stance on berberine,</p>
<p>then maybe we should have another discussion.</p>
<p>In any case, injectable L-carnitine,</p>
<p>if one can get that through a doctor,</p>
<p>how much is absorbed and how much should one take?</p>
<p>Almost all of it&rsquo;s absorbed.</p>
<p>In general, you&rsquo;re taking between 500 milligrams up to,</p>
<p>you can take a pretty high dose, up to 2,000 milligrams.</p>
<p>Okay, and what we did not talk about</p>
<p>is what L-carnitine does.</p>
<p>So why should someone go through all of this?</p>
<p>Is it to optimize testosterone?</p>
<p>Is it working on the receptor side?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s L-carnitine doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shuttle.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s named carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A.</p>
<p>Basically, it just takes nutrients</p>
<p>from outside your mitochondria and puts them in.</p>
<p>It also has a unique effect.</p>
<p>Well, not too unique because Tadalafil</p>
<p>actually has this effect as well,</p>
<p>is that it increases the density of the androgen receptor</p>
<p>in the cytoplasm of your cells.</p>
<p>So even if your androgen receptor sensitivity doesn&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>and even if your testosterone does not change,</p>
<p>you will have more testosterone</p>
<p>binding to that increased number of receptors.</p>
<p>Does one need to cycle L-carnitine, creatine, betaine?</p>
<p>No reason to cycle any of those.</p>
<p>Okay, what other supplements can one use</p>
<p>to try and improve hormone profiles?</p>
<p>And here I realize we&rsquo;re using a very broad brush</p>
<p>because when we say improve hormone profiles,</p>
<p>what are we really talking about?</p>
<p>And for me, at least, I think about the subjective stuff.</p>
<p>Do people feel like they are going to have more energy</p>
<p>as a consequence of doing these things?</p>
<p>Are they going to have the more optimized libido?</p>
<p>Are they going to have more optimized</p>
<p>recovery from exercise?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not clear to me that taking one&rsquo;s testosterone</p>
<p>from 600 to 800 is always going to be a good thing,</p>
<p>especially if estrogen is increasing in parallel.</p>
<p>That could cause issues.</p>
<p>It could certainly make things better.</p>
<p>It could certainly make things worse, right?</p>
<p>So with that backdrop,</p>
<p>what are some of the other things people can take?</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll go back to this issue</p>
<p>of what really is optimization.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s briefly mention vitamin D, which is also a hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a sterol hormone.</p>
<p>And if you have deficient vitamin D and you replace it,</p>
<p>then you will optimize your testosterone.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also mention boron.</p>
<p>So if you have a very high SHBG,</p>
<p>boron can acutely help lower it,</p>
<p>usually in a dose of five to 12 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really a sustained effect,</p>
<p>but boron is depleted in soils.</p>
<p>In many countries, I believe it&rsquo;s very high in soils,</p>
<p>in Greece and Turkey.</p>
<p>So eating dates or raisins that are from those areas</p>
<p>potentially have more boron.</p>
<p>Boron also might be one of the reasons</p>
<p>why the reference range for testosterone</p>
<p>is much higher in those countries than other countries.</p>
<p>And just to remind people,</p>
<p>the SHBG, sex hormone binding globulin,</p>
<p>is attaching to the testosterone molecule</p>
<p>and limiting the amount of so-called free testosterone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s available to have its impact on cells.</p>
<p>When Dr. Peter Attia was on this podcast,</p>
<p>in fact, sitting in that very chair,</p>
<p>he said that the ideal level of free testosterone in males</p>
<p>should be about 2% of one&rsquo;s total testosterone.</p>
<p>Would you agree with that number or disagree?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Peter would be fine if you said either.</p>
<p>2% is a good rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Usually the reference range is between about one and 4%.</p>
<p>Some people do have genetic polymorphisms in SHBG,</p>
<p>a specific gene mutation where they have very low SHBGs.</p>
<p>Also men that have varicose veins in their testes,</p>
<p>also known as varicoceles, tend to have very high SHBGs.</p>
<p>So that percentage would likely be less than 2%.</p>
<p>So just because your percentage of free T to total T</p>
<p>is a little bit above or below 2%, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>We just need to figure out the reason why it is.</p>
<p>How would somebody know if they have varicose veins</p>
<p>in their testicles,</p>
<p>especially if their testicles</p>
<p>are still attached to their body?</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to tell.</p>
<p>There is several grades.</p>
<p>If you have a grade three or grade four varicocele,</p>
<p>it has what&rsquo;s called a bag of worms appearance.</p>
<p>So think about if you&rsquo;ve just resistance trained</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a really hot day</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re wearing very tight fitting clothing,</p>
<p>then if you feel it and it almost feels</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s worms in the scrotum.</p>
<p>The other way is to do-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scary visual.</p>
<p>Yeah, bag of worms.</p>
<p>Well, just that, yeah, anyway,</p>
<p>I think parasites when I hear that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about just the texture.</p>
<p>The best way for most people to check</p>
<p>is to valsalva for a long period of time.</p>
<p>When you valsalva, venous return will decrease.</p>
<p>Can you explain valsalva for people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bearing down, like you&rsquo;re lifting a weight</p>
<p>or having a bowel movement where you swallow.</p>
<p>And a lot of times you can almost see buildup</p>
<p>of blood in your like jugular veins as well.</p>
<p>So you have decreased blood return to the heart</p>
<p>and increased blood in the veins themselves.</p>
<p>Okay, so vitamin D3,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re talking about vitamin D3 specifically</p>
<p>when you say vitamin D</p>
<p>and then boron five to 12 milligrams per day, right?</p>
<p>And then what are some of the other things</p>
<p>to optimize testosterone that are in supplement form?</p>
<p>We can talk about things</p>
<p>that affect the steroidogenesis cascade.</p>
<p>So we could touch on tonkat-ali.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;ve talked about that a little bit before.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m guessing a number of people</p>
<p>probably haven&rsquo;t heard that conversation.</p>
<p>Also known as long jack</p>
<p>and that upregulates several different enzymes</p>
<p>in the steroidogenesis cascade.</p>
<p>And by that, what you mean if,</p>
<p>and this is another good thing to Google,</p>
<p>I think anybody interested in hormone optimization</p>
<p>should understand where sterol hormones come from.</p>
<p>They come usually from cholesterol</p>
<p>and they can be shunted off to vitamin D very easily.</p>
<p>They can be shunted off to testosterone or estrogens</p>
<p>or progestogens quite easily as well.</p>
<p>But tonkat helps with the conversion of multiple key steps</p>
<p>where you synthesize testosterone.</p>
<p>Another, think of it as like a coenzyme or a cofactor,</p>
<p>an up regulator of these steps is insulin and IGF-1.</p>
<p>So a good rule of thumb is if you are not expecting</p>
<p>as much growth hormone, insulin and IGF-1,</p>
<p>for example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to cut body fat or body weight,</p>
<p>then tonkat is going to be theoretically especially powerful.</p>
<p>What sorts of dosages of tonkat</p>
<p>do you recommend to your patients?</p>
<p>Anywhere from 300 to 1200 milligrams a day.</p>
<p>With tonkat, you need to be careful with the standardization</p>
<p>because, and if you&rsquo;re thinking about</p>
<p>a general tonkat supplement,</p>
<p>which is by far the most well-studied,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re looking at the uricomonone content,</p>
<p>which is a plant compound that is likely</p>
<p>the main active pharmacologic effect.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the compound that&rsquo;s having the effect on the body.</p>
<p>And if you standardize the uricomonone very, very high,</p>
<p>then theoretically you&rsquo;re having more effect</p>
<p>at a lower dose.</p>
<p>I take 400 milligrams of tongkat ali per day.</p>
<p>I take it early in the day</p>
<p>because it has a bit of a stimulant effect.</p>
<p>And if I take it after 2 p.m.,</p>
<p>it starts to inhibit my sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking it for years</p>
<p>and I rather like the effects.</p>
<p>It seems subtle, but consistent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never cycled it.</p>
<p>Do you recommend cycling it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason to cycle it.</p>
<p>There is a reason to cycle some supplements,</p>
<p>but no reason to cycle tongkat.</p>
<p>My blood work tells me that it causes an increase</p>
<p>in free testosterone for me,</p>
<p>and also a slight increase in luteinizing hormone for me.</p>
<p>What are some of the other effects on various hormones</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve observed in the blood work of your patients</p>
<p>taking tongkat ali?</p>
<p>Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA.</p>
<p>And if you have a very high SHBG,</p>
<p>again, that&rsquo;s the protein that binds up your androgens</p>
<p>and estrogens, an extremely important protein.</p>
<p>The higher your SHBG, the more it helps decrease it.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve studied tongkat in populations</p>
<p>with very normal SHBGs and it does nothing for SHBG.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Does that mean it does nothing for somebody overall?</p>
<p>So if somebody has SHBG that&rsquo;s in the normal range,</p>
<p>will taking tongkat benefit them in any other way?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll increase their total and free testosterone.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Okay, is it known to have effects on anything else</p>
<p>like thyroid hormone, growth hormone,</p>
<p>or is it purely in these steroid synthesis pathways?</p>
<p>Or steroid, I should say, synthesis and receptor</p>
<p>and modulation pathways.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no direct effect on those pathways.</p>
<p>However, anytime you alter your free androgen</p>
<p>or free estrogen,</p>
<p>particularly one without altering the other,</p>
<p>it will alter the binding protein</p>
<p>that binds thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>So any change you make,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s natural optimization or hormone replacement,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to slightly skew your thyroid hormone profile.</p>
<p>One common actionable example of this</p>
<p>that I see often clinically is someone starts,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, estrogen replacement or testosterone replacement.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re taking AI with their testosterone replacement.</p>
<p>Aromatase inhibitor.</p>
<p>Correct, an aromatase inhibitor,</p>
<p>which blocks the conversion to estrogen.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re taking testosterone</p>
<p>and they have very little estrogen,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to decrease the binding protein,</p>
<p>also known as thyroxine binding globulin,</p>
<p>which binds active thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>So if you start TRT</p>
<p>and you either have low aromatase activity</p>
<p>or no aromatase activity, no conversion to estrogen,</p>
<p>then your free thyroid hormones will go up,</p>
<p>even just acutely.</p>
<p>Usually feedback inhibition,</p>
<p>which is how the body talks to itself and says,</p>
<p>we need to make more of this or less of this.</p>
<p>But acutely, there&rsquo;s not always enough time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have very high thyroid hormones</p>
<p>and you can have tachycardia, which is a fast heart rate,</p>
<p>or you can feel kind of like overly fight or flight</p>
<p>due to increased thyroid hormone activity in the end tissue.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, so Tongali,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a broad range, 300 to 1,200 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>And I realized that the source matters there.</p>
<p>What are some of the other hormones</p>
<p>that you prescribe to your patients</p>
<p>who do not want to go on testosterone replacement therapy</p>
<p>or take exogenous DHEA or anything like that?</p>
<p>We can talk about Fidosia next.</p>
<p>Fidosia is interesting because it&rsquo;s a genus of plants.</p>
<p>Fidosia agrestis is one of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many others that are very interesting.</p>
<p>That species is likely the most well-studied</p>
<p>and it will increase LH.</p>
<p>So I would not consider it an LH mimetic,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t really mimic it,</p>
<p>but it increases the release of luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>from the pituitary.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hormone that binds to the leydig cell,</p>
<p>to the LH receptor, kind of like HCG does.</p>
<p>And it will increase the release of testosterone.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So I think for people that aren&rsquo;t familiar with HCG,</p>
<p>so human chorionic gonadotropin</p>
<p>is basically synthetic luteinizing hormone.</p>
<p>And luteinizing hormone is the hormone</p>
<p>released from the pituitary</p>
<p>that is going to travel down to the testes</p>
<p>to stimulate the production of sperm and testosterone,</p>
<p>but mainly testosterone.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Mostly correct.</p>
<p>Technically, synthetic LH is also known as little-r LH</p>
<p>or recombinant LH.</p>
<p>And HCG can be synthetic,</p>
<p>but often it is just refined</p>
<p>from the urine of pregnant ladies</p>
<p>since the placenta makes it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called chorionic gonadotropin.</p>
<p>So where are they getting all this pregnant women&rsquo;s urine?</p>
<p>I mean, is there a location?</p>
<p>I mean, not that I want to go there.</p>
<p>Donation, yeah.</p>
<p>Really, so there are women that are sending-</p>
<p>First trimester pregnant ladies, it&rsquo;s very high.</p>
<p>Donating their urine and then they&rsquo;re purifying it</p>
<p>and then men are injecting it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually the same for menopausal ladies.</p>
<p>So first trimester pregnant ladies,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you can make, you know, non-synthetic HCG.</p>
<p>And then for minotropins, which are also known,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple of different names for it, like minopure.</p>
<p>You have menopausal ladies that have very high LH and FSH,</p>
<p>and then you refine the FSH and LH.</p>
<p>Okay, so moving away from the sources and from urine,</p>
<p>phytogia agrestis,</p>
<p>what dosages do you have patients take?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of some potential toxicity</p>
<p>to the testicular cells.</p>
<p>There is one study, and this is a rat study,</p>
<p>but you can equate the dose of toxicity in rats and humans.</p>
<p>They did not give these rats any antioxidants,</p>
<p>but it increases a couple different,</p>
<p>like pro-inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>One is GGT, or gamma-glutamyl transferase,</p>
<p>comes from both the testes and the liver,</p>
<p>and one is alkaline phosphatase, also known as ALKFOS,</p>
<p>again, coming from both areas.</p>
<p>There are several different ways</p>
<p>that you can attenuate this increase,</p>
<p>and you can also just check to see if you have increased.</p>
<p>In the rat dose that equates with humans that had no effect,</p>
<p>so the safe dose, was an average of 300 milligrams a day.</p>
<p>So that would be 300 milligrams a day in humans</p>
<p>is the dosage that did not have toxicity, correct?</p>
<p>Correct, and often, even if there is toxicity in rats,</p>
<p>there is not toxicity in humans,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not directly equitable.</p>
<p>But to be safe, another regimen that I have people take</p>
<p>is 600 milligrams every other day,</p>
<p>or 600 milligrams three times a week,</p>
<p>often Monday, Wednesday, Friday.</p>
<p>This is very interesting and relevant</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been taking Fidogia for some period of time.</p>
<p>All my markers and tests indicate that there&rsquo;s no toxicity,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been taking 600 milligrams per day,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been cycling it for about eight to 12 weeks on,</p>
<p>and then a few weeks off.</p>
<p>Based on what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking maybe three times per week</p>
<p>or every other day might be better, is that right?</p>
<p>If you weren&rsquo;t gonna get any labs,</p>
<p>that is certainly the regimen that you want.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna check your GGT and ALKFOS,</p>
<p>or even take other things to prevent those from increasing,</p>
<p>then you can certainly be more aggressive</p>
<p>with your Fidogia dosing.</p>
<p>You can increase it quite a bit,</p>
<p>and it has a dose-dependent response</p>
<p>in both the activities associated with high testosterone</p>
<p>and also just LH and testosterone.</p>
<p>So the more aggressive regimen</p>
<p>would be 600 milligrams daily for a month,</p>
<p>and then take one to two weeks off.</p>
<p>Great, I think that&rsquo;s more or less what I&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<p>Okay, terrific.</p>
<p>In terms of other hormones,</p>
<p>what are some of the supplements</p>
<p>that can support growth hormone,</p>
<p>a hormone that&rsquo;s associated with tissue repair,</p>
<p>and in some cases, metabolism and fat loss?</p>
<p>What are some of the tools,</p>
<p>nutritional and or supplement-based,</p>
<p>one can do to tap on the growth hormone pathway?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s lump IGF-1 in there too,</p>
<p>since they&rsquo;re essentially working along the same dimensions.</p>
<p>A quick synopsis, growth hormone is a peptide hormone,</p>
<p>and it is released by the pituitary.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s growth hormone-releasing hormone</p>
<p>and ghrelin that stimulate the release.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also peptides</p>
<p>that are very analogous to these two things.</p>
<p>You have that pulsatile secretion of growth hormone</p>
<p>in a very fast half-life of just minutes,</p>
<p>and then it increases IGF-1.</p>
<p>There is both peripheral IGF-1 and central IGF-1 and IGF-2,</p>
<p>but no need to get into the specifics.</p>
<p>There is a happy medium</p>
<p>to where your growth hormone is at a adequate level,</p>
<p>and your IGF-1 is an adequate level.</p>
<p>Usually, those two are congruent.</p>
<p>So in most cases, we just check an IGF-1,</p>
<p>and occasionally, the binding peptides for IGF-1,</p>
<p>kind of like SHBG that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re estimating a free IGF-1.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of confusing because almost all hormones</p>
<p>have binding proteins to help regulate them,</p>
<p>but often, you wanna look at free testosterone,</p>
<p>free estradiol, free IGF-1, or at least estimate it,</p>
<p>free cortisol even, and free thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re talking about growth hormone and IGF-1,</p>
<p>usually, you don&rsquo;t need to do anything to optimize it.</p>
<p>If you are diabetic,</p>
<p>then depending on the type of diabetes,</p>
<p>your IGF-1 and growth hormone can be too high.</p>
<p>Specifically in type 1 diabetes,</p>
<p>your growth hormone is extremely high,</p>
<p>but your IGF-1 is low.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re in a dysregulated state or have pathology,</p>
<p>I would just talk to your doctor</p>
<p>about IGF-1 or growth hormone.</p>
<p>Taking amino acids before you go to bed</p>
<p>could potentially help with growth hormone release</p>
<p>just because most growth hormone is released while you sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that fasting can increase growth hormone,</p>
<p>and I know there are certain patterns of weight training</p>
<p>that can increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>Some of those regimens in the weight room</p>
<p>that increase growth hormone have been covered</p>
<p>by Dr. Duncan French, who is a guest on this podcast.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;ll refer people to that episode</p>
<p>for the specific protocols, these high-volume training.</p>
<p>During those training exercises,</p>
<p>it usually does it transiently for a period of a few hours.</p>
<p>And a lot of this IGF-1 is released by the muscle itself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily released by the liver.</p>
<p>IGF-1 that is released directly</p>
<p>due to growth hormone signaling,</p>
<p>usually the growth hormone comes from the pituitary</p>
<p>and binds to the liver,</p>
<p>where it usually has a half-life of about a week,</p>
<p>where the paracrine or autocrine,</p>
<p>think of it as like the peripherally acting</p>
<p>or acting in the muscles itself, which is also helpful,</p>
<p>is released and is not as concerning</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not related to insulin resistance,</p>
<p>but it is related to the training itself.</p>
<p>So fasting and growth hormone,</p>
<p>is it true that fasting can increase growth hormone?</p>
<p>And maybe as a little related tangent,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that limiting food intake for the two hours</p>
<p>before going to sleep can increase</p>
<p>the pulse of growth hormone</p>
<p>that one experiences during sleep.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone gets a pulse of growth hormone</p>
<p>during sleep, but especially carbohydrate-laden meals</p>
<p>can blunt that peak that occurs</p>
<p>during sleep quite substantially.</p>
<p>So two questions, does avoiding food intake</p>
<p>in the two hours prior to sleep</p>
<p>help increase growth hormone release?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s being overly neurotic.</p>
<p>Maybe people need to avoid food</p>
<p>in the four hours before sleep.</p>
<p>But regardless, what is the relationship</p>
<p>between fasting and growth hormone release?</p>
<p>I find this really interesting.</p>
<p>Fasting certainly potently increases growth hormone release.</p>
<p>However, the end binding to the receptor is less sensitive.</p>
<p>So although fasting does increase growth hormone,</p>
<p>the genes that are downstream to it,</p>
<p>both the growth hormone genes</p>
<p>and IGF-1 related gene transcription activity</p>
<p>will not be significantly higher.</p>
<p>However, if you are optimizing the growth hormone</p>
<p>that is released as pulsatile secretion,</p>
<p>it is helpful to avoid eating for two hours.</p>
<p>So the general rule of thumb is avoid eating</p>
<p>about two hours before bed.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s clinically significant and helpful,</p>
<p>but fasting otherwise specifically</p>
<p>for growth hormone optimization</p>
<p>in someone who already has normal growth hormone signaling</p>
<p>is not helpful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s extremely useful to hear</p>
<p>because one of the major reasons why people fast</p>
<p>is to get that growth hormone increase.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;re adjusting things on the backend</p>
<p>that negate that, well then no such luck.</p>
<p>Not that I have anything against fasting.</p>
<p>I do a pseudo intermittent fasting</p>
<p>mostly because I prefer to eat it</p>
<p>fairly regular times of day.</p>
<p>Okay, so it doesn&rsquo;t sound like there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>that people can take in supplement form</p>
<p>to improve growth hormone.</p>
<p>What about thyroid hormone?</p>
<p>What are some of the things that people can take or do</p>
<p>in order to make sure that their thyroid hormone levels</p>
<p>are appropriate?</p>
<p>You wanna have a balance of iodine</p>
<p>and you wanna have a good source of iodine.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some camps that say</p>
<p>you should use a huge high dose of iodine</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s protocols for it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some that say you should use</p>
<p>just barely enough iodine.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s like 200 micrograms per day,</p>
<p>but you wanna balance.</p>
<p>One of the things that I see that many people</p>
<p>do not talk about when it comes to iodine and thyroid</p>
<p>is there is compounds known as goitrogens</p>
<p>or goitrogens.</p>
<p>And these goitrogens are neither good nor evil,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually kind of a nice check and balance.</p>
<p>You need more iodine if you consume more goitrogens.</p>
<p>And some examples of these are some of my favorite foods,</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables, boron is also a goitrogen.</p>
<p>So higher goitrogens, higher iodine.</p>
<p>So ingesting iodine containing salt is useful, yes or no?</p>
<p>Iodized salt does prevent goiter,</p>
<p>but it is not necessarily the ideal form of iodine.</p>
<p>Good forms of iodine often come from the ocean.</p>
<p>If you look at a chart of hypothyroidism,</p>
<p>there is a tendency to have more hypothyroidism</p>
<p>the more inland you go.</p>
<p>So trying to eat some cruciferous vegetables each day</p>
<p>would be the best way to improve thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>Along with plenty of iodine.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want too much iodine signaling.</p>
<p>Many people are familiar with radioactive iodine tablets,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s basically an extremely high amount of iodine</p>
<p>to block out the, like the radioactive iodine</p>
<p>that comes from after, you know,</p>
<p>like a nuclear meltdown or whatnot.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got creatine, pyridine, L-carnitine</p>
<p>with allicin, garlic to offset the TMAO,</p>
<p>vitamin D3, boron, tonga, ale, fedogia, some fasting.</p>
<p>Love to talk to you about peptides.</p>
<p>So I can imagine a hierarchy.</p>
<p>Hierarchy starts with behaviors and nutrition.</p>
<p>Behaviors, of course, includes training and limiting stress</p>
<p>and all the things we talked about before,</p>
<p>sunshine, et cetera, and optimized nutrition.</p>
<p>Then we talked about supplements,</p>
<p>all the things we just listed off</p>
<p>to optimize testosterone.</p>
<p>And we can get into this, but estrogen as well,</p>
<p>which is important for libido and brain function</p>
<p>and tissue function and joints feeling good, et cetera.</p>
<p>But then we get into the realm where one might</p>
<p>or could consider exogenous hormones,</p>
<p>taking a small dose of testosterone</p>
<p>or taking a small dose of GH even,</p>
<p>if that were appropriate</p>
<p>and certainly only working with a doctor.</p>
<p>But in between, there&rsquo;s a step of so-called peptides.</p>
<p>And of course, there are many peptides.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already talked about some of them,</p>
<p>but when people talk about taking peptides,</p>
<p>the ones that I hear most often about</p>
<p>is a category that increases GH and IGF-1.</p>
<p>And those, to my knowledge,</p>
<p>go by the things like sermorelin,</p>
<p>ipermorelin, tesomorelin,</p>
<p>sort of a kit of things that are taken separately</p>
<p>or in combination to increase GH and IGF-1.</p>
<p>But then other people, for instance,</p>
<p>are taking peptides like BPC-157</p>
<p>to try and improve tissue healing and recovery.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of interest in peptides.</p>
<p>Please, if you would, tell us about what you know</p>
<p>about the safety of peptides in terms of their sourcing</p>
<p>and the utility of peptides.</p>
<p>Is this something that people should consider</p>
<p>before thinking about hormone replacement?</p>
<p>Should people be wary of these things?</p>
<p>I am very wary of particular sources that are sold online</p>
<p>that are not clean.</p>
<p>They contain contaminants and that could be dangerous.</p>
<p>I really would love your thoughts on peptides.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna sit back and let you riff on peptides.</p>
<p>But if you could touch on some of the ones</p>
<p>that I mentioned, I&rsquo;d be most grateful.</p>
<p>A peptide is just a chain of amino acids</p>
<p>between two and a couple hundred in length.</p>
<p>So I think of peptides as several different categories.</p>
<p>And the GHRPs that you mentioned, I would consider those,</p>
<p>and that stands for growth hormone-releasing peptide.</p>
<p>You have two main types.</p>
<p>The ghrelin agonist or they hit the ghrelin receptor</p>
<p>and it helps release growth hormone because of that.</p>
<p>And then also the GHRH-like peptides.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very similar to growth hormone-releasing hormone.</p>
<p>Often they just change a couple amino acids</p>
<p>and it acts like that.</p>
<p>Tesamoralin is one of them.</p>
<p>Cermoralin is another one.</p>
<p>And CJC is another common one.</p>
<p>I believe those are all in the class of GHRH-like peptides.</p>
<p>Whereas ipomerelin or ibutamorin,</p>
<p>which is also known as MK-677,</p>
<p>those two are in the class of ghrelin agonist.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re more like they hit the receptor</p>
<p>that ghrelin does,</p>
<p>whereas the other ones hit the GHRH receptor.</p>
<p>I think of ghrelin as making me hungry.</p>
<p>Hungry and angry.</p>
<p>Why would I wanna take something</p>
<p>that would increase ghrelin signaling?</p>
<p>Some people are trying to gain weight.</p>
<p>It also does increase your growth hormone.</p>
<p>So if your growth hormone is very low, you can consider it.</p>
<p>Ibutamorin is a long-acting,</p>
<p>so it has a long half-life, also known as MK-677.</p>
<p>It was studied mostly in growth hormone deficiency.</p>
<p>And do these people get angry also?</p>
<p>They can.</p>
<p>Many people report a side effect of anxiety</p>
<p>or significant hunger.</p>
<p>Most people take it in the evening</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t notice that hunger as much.</p>
<p>It can also greatly increase your blood glucose.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re insulin resistant or pre-diabetic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s especially concerning.</p>
<p>This is one of those rare moments</p>
<p>where I hear something and I think,</p>
<p>okay, even though there&rsquo;s this kit of compounds</p>
<p>that can increase GH and IGF-1,</p>
<p>based on everything you&rsquo;re telling me,</p>
<p>maybe just taking GH is the better option for those people</p>
<p>because growth hormone, at least it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>synthetic growth hormone is mimicking an endogenous hormone.</p>
<p>I mean, certainly not taking anything might be the ideal,</p>
<p>but for those that wanna increase growth hormone</p>
<p>and they wanna use pharmacology to do that,</p>
<p>it sounds like these peptides are pretty precarious.</p>
<p>Yeah, it kinda depends on the situation.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s an individual that struggles with hunger</p>
<p>and not eating enough, for example,</p>
<p>someone who has a very small stomach</p>
<p>or they just have a very low hunger drive,</p>
<p>sometimes you want more of that orexigenic signaling.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus, you have anorexigenic signaling,</p>
<p>which is kinda like anorexia and orexigenic signaling,</p>
<p>which is, I call it the hangry center of the hypothalamus</p>
<p>or the hangry center.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s an imbalance between those two,</p>
<p>then perhaps it&rsquo;d be helpful,</p>
<p>potentially theoretically helpful in anorexics,</p>
<p>of which the incidence of anorexia in men</p>
<p>is increasing significantly.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re telling me this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m remembering being 14 or 15 years old</p>
<p>and I would go into the kitchen sometimes</p>
<p>and I was so hungry,</p>
<p>I would just obliterate all the food.</p>
<p>And I do remember being,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a pretty high energy guy,</p>
<p>but having an immense amount of energy.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recall if it was a hangry feeling or not,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing that was growth hormone.</p>
<p>I grew one foot in a single academic year.</p>
<p>So I imagine that was at least in part</p>
<p>due to growth hormone.</p>
<p>In any case, sermorelin is the peptide</p>
<p>that I hear the most often about.</p>
<p>I admittedly tried a run of it.</p>
<p>I was researching a book</p>
<p>and decided to take it before sleep on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>It gave me a tremendous depth of sleep,</p>
<p>but that sleep was really truncated,</p>
<p>which is just nerd speak for saying deep, but short sleep.</p>
<p>I would wake up after very intense dreams.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that it helped me recover</p>
<p>from exercise that much.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t notice any additional fat loss or anything.</p>
<p>Sort of abandoned it, except for occasional use.</p>
<p>Again, this was prescribed by a doctor.</p>
<p>You know, I was trying to get the sense</p>
<p>that these peptides and their effects</p>
<p>are somewhat vague and distributed and highly individual.</p>
<p>Is that a fair way to describe them?</p>
<p>Part of the problem with the effect of peptides</p>
<p>is many people take them in levels</p>
<p>that are far above the physiologic range.</p>
<p>Even individuals who are checking their IGF-1</p>
<p>while they take these different GHRPs,</p>
<p>most of them do not check the binding peptides.</p>
<p>For example, IGF binding peptide one, two,</p>
<p>or three, and their free IGF-1 level</p>
<p>might be significantly different.</p>
<p>So the common doses that people will take these off-label</p>
<p>for as a supplement are often much greater</p>
<p>than the therapeutic or physiologic range.</p>
<p>Which for me just underscores the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s pretty precarious.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not coming in here as the referee</p>
<p>of what anyone should or shouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Just trying to gather and distribute information.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve heard, for instance,</p>
<p>that some companies where people can acquire these things</p>
<p>without prescription, those companies are not good</p>
<p>at cleaning out the lipopolysaccharide, the LPS,</p>
<p>which can cause an inflammatory response.</p>
<p>In other words, these are dirty compounds.</p>
<p>And that just sounds risky.</p>
<p>It just sounds, frankly,</p>
<p>it just sounds really dangerous to me.</p>
<p>LPS is a common additive in many companies</p>
<p>that are not pharmacies, but they&rsquo;re selling things</p>
<p>that people often use as human consumption.</p>
<p>One interesting note about lipopolysaccharide</p>
<p>is your gut microbiome actually makes a lot of it as well,</p>
<p>especially Prevotella, which is a specific species</p>
<p>that can have to do with your baseline body temperature.</p>
<p>So your baseline body temperature might also change</p>
<p>depending on if you&rsquo;re on a peptide that has LPS in it.</p>
<p>Yikes, yikes, and yikes.</p>
<p>But I tend to be pretty conservative</p>
<p>when it comes to taking anything exogenous.</p>
<p>But I do rely on many of the supplements</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>and I do try and optimize the behavioral things</p>
<p>and nutritional things for a long time.</p>
<p>Okay, so then leaving peptides behind,</p>
<p>we are now, I suppose, in the territory of exogenous hormone.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that somebody decides</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not concerned with fertility,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re going to bank sperm, or they already have kids,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re going to defer on this issue</p>
<p>of wanting to have kids.</p>
<p>My understanding is that nowadays,</p>
<p>a lot of people are using testosterone.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not even call it replacement therapy,</p>
<p>because some of these people have 600, 700,</p>
<p>or even 800 nanogram per deciliter reads.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not replacing anything that is diminished.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just trying to augment what&rsquo;s already there,</p>
<p>increase what&rsquo;s already there.</p>
<p>My understanding is that taking a low dose more frequently</p>
<p>is going to be more beneficial</p>
<p>than the kind of old school way of giving 100</p>
<p>or even 200 milligrams in a single injection</p>
<p>once every two weeks.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>And what do you do with your patients?</p>
<p>So let me give you a hypothetical.</p>
<p>Somebody comes into your office,</p>
<p>they do their blood work,</p>
<p>and they have blood levels of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say 600 nanograms per deciliter testosterone.</p>
<p>Their estrogen is also in normal range.</p>
<p>Everything else checks out,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re complaining of slightly diminished libido,</p>
<p>slightly poor recovery from workouts,</p>
<p>maybe reduced motivation and drive,</p>
<p>although no major depression.</p>
<p>And you come to the conclusion that testosterone therapy,</p>
<p>not replacement, but testosterone therapy</p>
<p>might be a good option to explore.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a typical dosage range</p>
<p>and frequency of administration range</p>
<p>that you might consider exploring?</p>
<p>And some of this depends on the SHBG</p>
<p>and free testosterone as well.</p>
<p>So if that same individual had a very high SHBG,</p>
<p>which again is the binding protein</p>
<p>that binds up the testosterone</p>
<p>and all androgens and estrogens,</p>
<p>if it is extremely high</p>
<p>and they have a free testosterone of two,</p>
<p>then they might need a different dose</p>
<p>because they need enough testosterone</p>
<p>in order to have a normal eugenital free testosterone.</p>
<p>But a general normal dosing range,</p>
<p>especially for someone starting,</p>
<p>is around 100 to 120 milligrams</p>
<p>divided over the course of a week,</p>
<p>usually either every other day or three times a week,</p>
<p>occasionally twice a week.</p>
<p>Many people with SHBG a bit higher</p>
<p>can get away pretty easily with twice a week.</p>
<p>This is assuming that the ester is cipionate or enanthate.</p>
<p>So 260 milligram injections</p>
<p>of testosterone cipionate per week.</p>
<p>Yeah, very common dosing.</p>
<p>To hit that 120 milligrams per week</p>
<p>as kind of the typical average, correct?</p>
<p>And I would consider this</p>
<p>like a physiologic eugenital dose.</p>
<p>For many people, even 200 milligrams a week</p>
<p>is far above the reference range.</p>
<p>All of this is said with the caveat</p>
<p>that testosterone is normally released</p>
<p>in a pulsatile manner.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s high in the morning, low in the evening.</p>
<p>Whereas if you&rsquo;re on testosterone therapy,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to have a steady state.</p>
<p>So your testosterone level is gonna be</p>
<p>pretty much the same even in the evening.</p>
<p>And in your experience, when patients do that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing they report the normal constellation</p>
<p>of positive effects, you know, improved mood,</p>
<p>improved energy, improved sleep, recovery, et cetera.</p>
<p>What are some of the hazards or things</p>
<p>that can crop up in blood work or just subjectively</p>
<p>that can be warning signs that even a dosage</p>
<p>of 120 milligrams divided into these two</p>
<p>or three dosages per week is too high?</p>
<p>Every organ system in the body.</p>
<p>So this is when you really have to be</p>
<p>at least well-versed in every organ system,</p>
<p>not just the genital system.</p>
<p>You need to have dermatology prowess.</p>
<p>Acne is a very common change.</p>
<p>Lots of different skin pathologies</p>
<p>or even bruising can be related to hormone replacement.</p>
<p>Hair loss is very common to see as well.</p>
<p>Mental status changes, it could occasionally</p>
<p>it even induces a manic or a bipolar episode</p>
<p>because testosterone is also dopaminergic.</p>
<p>And then cardiovascularly, not just in the heart,</p>
<p>but also concerns for like microvascular ischemic disease,</p>
<p>ferritin buildup because the estrogen also increases</p>
<p>and then fertility concerns as well.</p>
<p>And lipid concerns too.</p>
<p>So you really have to be a hematologist, dermatologist,</p>
<p>cardiologist, a lipidologist, the whole nine yards.</p>
<p>So another reason or set of reasons rather</p>
<p>to if one is considering using testosterone therapy</p>
<p>to really do this in close communication</p>
<p>with a really good physician,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a lot to monitor.</p>
<p>Knowing whether or not you have acne or not is one thing,</p>
<p>but knowing whether or not your LDL is going up,</p>
<p>your ApoB is going up, that&rsquo;s a whole other biz</p>
<p>and that needs to be done through blood work</p>
<p>is what I&rsquo;m hearing.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And if your physician that is managing</p>
<p>or prescribing your testosterone therapy</p>
<p>or your HRT is not well-versed in these systems,</p>
<p>you would want him or her to be part</p>
<p>of an interdisciplinary team where they have other experts</p>
<p>that can monitor those systems.</p>
<p>I skipped over a sort of still intermediate set of things,</p>
<p>prescription drugs, but maybe talking about testosterone</p>
<p>first was a bit of a mistake on my part</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m aware that there are,</p>
<p>actually I think there are companies,</p>
<p>but certainly groups out there that say,</p>
<p>no wait, don&rsquo;t go straight from nothing to supplements</p>
<p>to testosterone.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re doing behaviors</p>
<p>and optimizing nutrition supplements,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s forget peptides,</p>
<p>but instead of going straight to testosterone therapy,</p>
<p>one idea that many people are pursuing</p>
<p>is to take the prescription drugs</p>
<p>that trigger luteinizing hormones.</p>
<p>So taking HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin,</p>
<p>which my understanding is will increase testosterone,</p>
<p>but also estrogen,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll take things like clomiphene.</p>
<p>In fact, I think there are a bunch of companies</p>
<p>out there now that are, I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take testosterone, it shuts down spermatogenesis,</p>
<p>shuts down testosterone production,</p>
<p>clomiphene is the way to go.</p>
<p>Maybe you could educate us about the HCG monotherapy,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called, where you&rsquo;re just mono one,</p>
<p>just taking HCG and clomiphene as a,</p>
<p>and or clomiphene as a tool to ratchet up hormones.</p>
<p>So quick points on HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin,</p>
<p>made during especially the first trimester of pregnancy,</p>
<p>it has effects other than binding to the LH receptor.</p>
<p>It also binds to the TSH receptor in the thyroid.</p>
<p>So thyroid stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In fact, if you look at a molecule of HCG</p>
<p>and thyroid stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>they are extremely similar.</p>
<p>However, you need a relatively high dose of HCG</p>
<p>to bind to the TSH receptor.</p>
<p>This is the normal mechanism in pregnancy</p>
<p>that accounts for the increased need of thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>usually about 30 to 40%.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why if someone has hypothyroidism,</p>
<p>you need to increase their dose of thyroid</p>
<p>because the HCG is not gonna be doing it for you.</p>
<p>The clomid or clomiphene, there&rsquo;s two main,</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s diastereoisomers,</p>
<p>and one of them is N-clomiphene,</p>
<p>one of them is ZOO-clomiphene.</p>
<p>And these two work slightly differently.</p>
<p>N-clomiphene, I believe, has a faster half-life</p>
<p>and it is potentially slightly better tolerated.</p>
<p>However, they were studying it,</p>
<p>clomid is a very commonly prescribed drug,</p>
<p>and obviously there is plenty of N-clomiphene in clomid.</p>
<p>However, the drug, which was Andrazol, A-N-D-R-O-X-A-L,</p>
<p>did not go all the way through the FDA approval process,</p>
<p>despite clomid being FDA approved.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s clomid, which contains clomiphene,</p>
<p>but there are also,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re talking about male hormone optimization</p>
<p>this episode, there are males out there</p>
<p>who want to increase their testosterone</p>
<p>and other hormones, maybe growth hormone, et cetera,</p>
<p>who opt to not take exogenous testosterone,</p>
<p>so no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable, cipionate,</p>
<p>but decide to take clomiphene a couple of times a week.</p>
<p>My understanding, I&rsquo;ve never done this,</p>
<p>I would say if I had,</p>
<p>my understanding is that taking clomiphene,</p>
<p>maybe two 50 milligram tablets a week</p>
<p>is what I hear people are doing,</p>
<p>will increase what, luteinizing hormone,</p>
<p>the various estrogen receptor subunits.</p>
<p>Could you explain how clomiphene would benefit anyone?</p>
<p>And is this a good strategy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing that it&rsquo;s being done quite a lot now.</p>
<p>It will increase testosterone in a dose-dependent manner,</p>
<p>but it has many other pharmacodynamic effects,</p>
<p>which is the effect of the drug on the body,</p>
<p>other than its effect on the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and the pituitary.</p>
<p>So in the hypothalamus and the pituitary,</p>
<p>it does what&rsquo;s called negative feedback inhibition,</p>
<p>or it blocks the oxygen of estrogen,</p>
<p>so it crowds out estrogen from the estrogen receptor</p>
<p>on the hypothalamus and the pituitary.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the subjective effect that that would cause?</p>
<p>So my understanding and experience of estrogen</p>
<p>is that if I ever took,</p>
<p>and I did take a very low dose</p>
<p>of an aromatase inhibitor once, and I felt terrible.</p>
<p>Actually, reduced libido, joints felt achy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I discovered that, wow,</p>
<p>estrogen is actually really important</p>
<p>for your brain function, for joint function, and for libido.</p>
<p>And suppressing estrogen, for me,</p>
<p>just turned out to be the wrong idea.</p>
<p>But my levels indicate that it&rsquo;s within reference range.</p>
<p>Okay, so why would I want to take something</p>
<p>that would increase the activity of an estrogen receptor?</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t find the rationale for that.</p>
<p>The main rationale behind taking a CIRM</p>
<p>is as a very temporary measure</p>
<p>that is not going to suppress pituitary</p>
<p>or hypothalamic function</p>
<p>if your testosterone is just so drastically low</p>
<p>that it is unlikely to recover anyway.</p>
<p>So most of the time, it is not clinically useful,</p>
<p>and CIRM should not be prescribed very often,</p>
<p>certainly not as long-term testosterone replacement</p>
<p>or testosterone optimization in most individuals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always exceptions to everything,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s five different estrogen</p>
<p>and estrogen-related receptors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two main estrogen receptors in Clomid,</p>
<p>and every CIRM has a very unique profile</p>
<p>because they selectively inhibit some receptors</p>
<p>in some tissues, but not other receptors in other tissues.</p>
<p>For example, Clomid can inhibit receptors</p>
<p>that are in the eye,</p>
<p>and it can cause visual changes, blurry vision,</p>
<p>especially at higher doses.</p>
<p>And it also acts in every other tissue of the body.</p>
<p>So side effects from Clomid</p>
<p>and other selective estrogen receptor modifiers</p>
<p>are very common.</p>
<p>Hmm, so I&rsquo;m, at least by my mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pool them with peptides</p>
<p>and say it sounds precarious</p>
<p>and probably not ideal for most people.</p>
<p>Going back to testosterone therapy,</p>
<p>then again, notice, folks,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve deleted the replacement part</p>
<p>because I think so many people</p>
<p>are using testosterone therapy</p>
<p>without the sort of reference range need</p>
<p>to replace anything,</p>
<p>but rather are building on what they already have</p>
<p>for purposes of increasing vitality, et cetera.</p>
<p>Going back to that,</p>
<p>my understanding is that taking HCG</p>
<p>several times per week</p>
<p>can help maintain spermatogenesis and fertility</p>
<p>even while people are on testosterone,</p>
<p>but, and you and I were talking about this earlier,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s tremendous variation.</p>
<p>Some people will take a small amount of testosterone</p>
<p>and just crush their sperm count.</p>
<p>They just won&rsquo;t make any viable sperm.</p>
<p>Other people can maintain viable sperm production</p>
<p>while on testosterone,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re taking HCG.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many reasons for this.</p>
<p>Some of this has to do with heat damage to the testes.</p>
<p>So potentially cold therapy could be helpful for that.</p>
<p>Ice baths, cold showers,</p>
<p>and certainly avoiding sauna and hot tub.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Stopping the daily hot tub</p>
<p>can restore fertility in many people.</p>
<p>I know a number of people</p>
<p>that are trying to conceive children</p>
<p>that go into the sauna</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll just put a cold pack in their shorts</p>
<p>or between their legs,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not they&rsquo;re wearing shorts</p>
<p>or not when they go in,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll alternate ice and heat</p>
<p>in a way that maintains coolness</p>
<p>of the milieu in which the sperm live.</p>
<p>In other words, they&rsquo;re cooling their scrotum deliberately</p>
<p>in order to avoid killing the sperm.</p>
<p>Actually, I saw an interesting paper</p>
<p>that said that for every two degree increase</p>
<p>in temperature of the scrotum,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a 20% decrease in spermatogenesis</p>
<p>and viability of sperm.</p>
<p>And that actually, if you look at the difference</p>
<p>between people who stand a lot, sit a lot, and drive a lot,</p>
<p>what you see is a progressive decrease in sperm count.</p>
<p>Because when people are sitting,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an increase in temperature.</p>
<p>And then when they&rsquo;re sitting on the hot seat of the car,</p>
<p>or using the heated seats, actually it kills sperm.</p>
<p>I think there are good data on that.</p>
<p>Yeah, excellent data.</p>
<p>And anecdotally, you see it as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had several patients come in</p>
<p>for fertility consultations.</p>
<p>And all we do is, no medications, no supplements.</p>
<p>We change their several lifestyle things.</p>
<p>Very tight-fitting clothing is another one.</p>
<p>And soon they have fertility, and they&rsquo;re no longer,</p>
<p>they have sperm, whereas before they did not.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts.</p>
<p>But we have talked about a lot of do&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>things that one can do to optimize hormones.</p>
<p>Maybe we could just do sort of more rapid-fire Q&amp;A</p>
<p>on some of the don&rsquo;ts, and maybe throw in some science</p>
<p>where you feel it&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>
<p>Cannabis, marijuana, THC, yes or no,</p>
<p>it diminishes testosterone levels?</p>
<p>Smoked cannabis, I would say diminishes testosterone,</p>
<p>increases prolactin, that&rsquo;s a no.</p>
<p>Other cannabinoids, not particularly harmful.</p>
<p>So CBD?</p>
<p>CBD, not particularly harmful.</p>
<p>Smoked CBD, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>What about edible cannabis and THC?</p>
<p>As far as I know, edible cannabis and THC</p>
<p>does not significantly increase prolactin</p>
<p>to a point where it would be disruptive of hormones.</p>
<p>Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever you wanna call it,</p>
<p>increase gynecomastia, the growth of male breast tissue?</p>
<p>Yes, it certainly can.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a pretty good association</p>
<p>between smoked THC and gynecomastia.</p>
<p>What about nicotine and testosterone</p>
<p>and estrogen and other hormones, smoked nicotine?</p>
<p>Nicotine is particularly concerning,</p>
<p>not only for testosterone, but also for estrogen.</p>
<p>Part of it is, if you&rsquo;re talking about nicotine from tobacco,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many other carcinogens in it,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s smoked.</p>
<p>But nicotine, even if it is chewed in a dose-dependent</p>
<p>manner, so if you can use an extremely small amount</p>
<p>of nicotine, then it&rsquo;s not as concerning in the long run,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a vasoconstrictor,</p>
<p>and one of the main concerns with it</p>
<p>would be cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>or even microvascular ischemic disease</p>
<p>that can lead to neurodegenerative disease,</p>
<p>so like a type of dementia that can be partly due</p>
<p>to nicotine.</p>
<p>If you use nicotine for a very long period of time,</p>
<p>especially at a higher dose, it&rsquo;s a dose-dependent effect</p>
<p>on your hormone profile.</p>
<p>Is that also true for nicorette and nicotine,</p>
<p>other nicotine gums?</p>
<p>At high doses, if you can use an extremely low dose</p>
<p>of a nicotine gum, then theoretically,</p>
<p>that would be maintainable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna overload the nicotinic receptor.</p>
<p>You have acetylcholine and the cholinergic system</p>
<p>as one of your main nervous systems, of course,</p>
<p>and you have muscarinic receptors and nicotine receptors,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just better ways to optimize</p>
<p>your nicotinic receptor activity.</p>
<p>For example, acetylcholine precursors like alpha-GPC,</p>
<p>phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine.</p>
<p>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially natural ones,</p>
<p>potentially have a part as well, and then other alkaloids.</p>
<p>So nicotine is an alkaloid from the tobacco plant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other plants like cytosine</p>
<p>and that genus of plants,</p>
<p>and that alkaloid is also a nicotine receptor agonist.</p>
<p>Is it true that cycling for too long,</p>
<p>literally bicycling, sitting on a bike seat too long,</p>
<p>can damage the prostate?</p>
<p>Yes, it can be very concerning,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re seated while cycling,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re putting a lot of pressure</p>
<p>on the perineum.</p>
<p>Your core is kind of like a box</p>
<p>where your diaphragm sort of makes the top,</p>
<p>and your abs and serratus make the front and the sides.</p>
<p>Your back muscles make the back,</p>
<p>and then your pelvic floor makes the bottom of the box,</p>
<p>which is arguably the most important part of your core,</p>
<p>and that pressure can weaken</p>
<p>and even lead to incontinence and impotence.</p>
<p>So we were talking earlier today in the gym</p>
<p>about how heavy leg work, hack squats, deadlifts,</p>
<p>those kinds of things a lot of guys are doing</p>
<p>to increase their testosterone,</p>
<p>done correctly can actually augment</p>
<p>and build up the strength of the pelvic floor.</p>
<p>Done incorrectly can actually weaken the pelvic floor</p>
<p>and lead to all sorts of issues,</p>
<p>including sexual effects, negative sexual effects.</p>
<p>So how does one go about learning</p>
<p>whether or not their movements are being done properly</p>
<p>to support pelvic floor or to destruct pelvic floor?</p>
<p>The pelvic floor is a constellation of muscles</p>
<p>just like any other kind of like system in the body.</p>
<p>And form is important.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing the Valsalva maneuver,</p>
<p>which again is that kind of like bearing down</p>
<p>or deep breath where you feel all of your abs are tight,</p>
<p>you can also notice that your pelvic floor is tight as well.</p>
<p>If you have a history of an inguinal hernia,</p>
<p>which is a hole kind of like connecting the abdominal cavity</p>
<p>down through the pelvic floor,</p>
<p>or even the scrotum in some cases,</p>
<p>and that can be a sign that there is weakness in that area</p>
<p>and you might have to concentrate on it most</p>
<p>or even have a physiotherapist or a physical therapist</p>
<p>specifically target the pelvic floor.</p>
<p>Many exercises in which you Valsalva</p>
<p>or use your glutes or legs,</p>
<p>you can learn to squeeze them</p>
<p>and have that mind muscle connection</p>
<p>in order to help build up the pelvic floor.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other things,</p>
<p>many people are familiar with Kegels.</p>
<p>That is just one of the many different exercises</p>
<p>that can help your pelvic floor.</p>
<p>My understanding is that</p>
<p>while strengthening the pelvic floor is good,</p>
<p>excessive contraction of the pelvic floor</p>
<p>can actually limit blood flow to the pelvic area,</p>
<p>the penis and so forth.</p>
<p>So this is, again, it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t want guys out there</p>
<p>to just start doing endless number of Kegels every day</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re actually gonna constrict blood flow</p>
<p>to that area, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, and in fact,</p>
<p>the erection response is parasympathetic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a relaxed induced response, right?</p>
<p>So, you know, for the reason I chuckle is that, you know,</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;re talking about things,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have visuals or charts</p>
<p>and certainly it&rsquo;s hard to know</p>
<p>whether or not a given exercise like Kegels</p>
<p>are gonna be good or not good.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s excessive, what, you know,</p>
<p>how many sets and reps does it take</p>
<p>before it goes from good to bad?</p>
<p>Is there a kind of general rule of thumb</p>
<p>for people to think about this?</p>
<p>I mean, clearly blood flow to that area is key, right?</p>
<p>For sexual performance.</p>
<p>And yet when one trains the legs or even walks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting blood flow.</p>
<p>So my understanding is this,</p>
<p>that a combination of weight training</p>
<p>to stimulate the positive hormonal and muscular</p>
<p>and connective tissue growth is key,</p>
<p>provides not overtraining,</p>
<p>but so is casual exercise,</p>
<p>like walking and stretching and the sorts of things</p>
<p>that will then return blood flow to that area.</p>
<p>Is that an overly basic way to think about it</p>
<p>or will that suffice?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a good way to think about it.</p>
<p>I think the main point with Kegels</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re just a one of many different things.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re having some pelvic floor pathology certainly,</p>
<p>or even just concerned about your pelvic floor,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t just, you know, take the advice,</p>
<p>do Kegels and you&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>
<p>That is not near enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one of the many aspects.</p>
<p>Okay, so going back to the rapid Q&amp;A,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll come back to this issue of blood flow</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some interesting science</p>
<p>and protocols there.</p>
<p>Question I have is,</p>
<p>alcohol, does it increase aromatase,</p>
<p>the enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen or not?</p>
<p>And is there a dose dependence there?</p>
<p>It significantly does.</p>
<p>There is a dose dependence.</p>
<p>In general, I would not recommend more than</p>
<p>three to four, you know, standard drinks.</p>
<p>One huge glass of wine is probably five standard drinks,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d say every two weeks.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s consistent with what I discovered</p>
<p>researching alcohol in an episode we did on alcohol,</p>
<p>that no alcohol is definitely better</p>
<p>for all aspects of health than any alcohol.</p>
<p>And anyone that says that,</p>
<p>well, red wine contains these various things,</p>
<p>well, it doesn&rsquo;t contain enough of those positive things</p>
<p>to have a positive effect.</p>
<p>But that if people do opt to drink alcohol,</p>
<p>that two drinks per week,</p>
<p>and meaning 20 grams of alcohol,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s probably two 12 ounce beers</p>
<p>or two, you know, four ounce glasses of wine</p>
<p>is going to be the upper limit</p>
<p>beyond which you&rsquo;re gonna start seeing</p>
<p>all sorts of negative effects.</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind with alcohol</p>
<p>is it has a lot of calories,</p>
<p>seven kilocalories per gram,</p>
<p>almost as much as fat, which is nine.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s also very GABAergic.</p>
<p>So it can activate inhibitory neurotransmission.</p>
<p>And that can also affect how many,</p>
<p>how much LH and FSH is released.</p>
<p>So that can also decrease testosterone</p>
<p>almost kind of similar to how opiates</p>
<p>can decrease testosterone.</p>
<p>I feel very lucky that I don&rsquo;t enjoy alcohol,</p>
<p>never really did, can kind of take it or leave it.</p>
<p>Certainly don&rsquo;t like sedatives like Valium</p>
<p>or anything like that,</p>
<p>which as you just mentioned can suppress testosterone.</p>
<p>You said the word fat.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna pick up on that and say,</p>
<p>in order to optimize hormone production,</p>
<p>is it important to have some saturated fat in one&rsquo;s diet?</p>
<p>And what happens on very low fat diets</p>
<p>to testosterone, estrogen, and other steroid hormones?</p>
<p>Fat&rsquo;s interesting because there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>different beneficial fats, omega-3s.</p>
<p>Almost every American gets plenty of omega-6s</p>
<p>in any developed country really.</p>
<p>When it comes to saturated fat,</p>
<p>there is more of a correlation with hormone optimization.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating things with saturated fat,</p>
<p>those are things with more fat-soluble vitamins</p>
<p>and things that are very nutrient-dense otherwise,</p>
<p>but it is not vital.</p>
<p>In general, you want to eliminate any trans fat</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s trans fat from the ruminants.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always an exception to everything, right?</p>
<p>So there is healthy trans omega-3 fats,</p>
<p>which are formed in the stomach</p>
<p>of like grass-fed and finished ruminants.</p>
<p>But ingesting mostly olive oils,</p>
<p>maybe nut butters in limited amounts</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very calorie-dense,</p>
<p>but unless people are trying to increase their calories,</p>
<p>in which case they&rsquo;re a great source of calories.</p>
<p>Small amounts of butter or ghee, probably okay,</p>
<p>but not excessive amounts, is that the idea?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Fat is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Cholesterol has an interesting,</p>
<p>so cholesterol and in general phospholipids</p>
<p>make the bilayer that&rsquo;s around the cell,</p>
<p>but cholesterol is also a hormone in and of itself</p>
<p>because it binds to the estrogen-related receptor alpha.</p>
<p>So I consider that like in the estrogen receptor category</p>
<p>and that can help with metabolism,</p>
<p>but also potentially have concerns</p>
<p>for cancer and tumor risk.</p>
<p>I wanna go back to the prostate</p>
<p>and talk to you about something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a newer emerging trend.</p>
<p>I know that you&rsquo;ve talked to a little bit about this</p>
<p>in previous podcasts, that a number of men,</p>
<p>or I should say a number of physicians</p>
<p>are prescribing low dose Tadalafil,</p>
<p>also known as Cialis, to their male patients.</p>
<p>So in doses ranges of like 2.5 milligrams</p>
<p>to five milligrams per day,</p>
<p>but not for erectile dysfunction,</p>
<p>but rather for improving prostate health.</p>
<p>And presumably they get sort of a boost</p>
<p>in terms of blood flow to the genitalia as well.</p>
<p>But again, not specifically a deal with erectile dysfunction</p>
<p>but to deal with prostate health</p>
<p>and blood flow to the prostate.</p>
<p>Is that something that you sometimes often prescribe</p>
<p>to your patients and of what age?</p>
<p>Tadalafil is a very underrated medication.</p>
<p>The age would kind of depend on the indication.</p>
<p>So Tadalafil is also a blood pressure medication.</p>
<p>It can very slightly decrease blood pressure,</p>
<p>especially at higher doses.</p>
<p>At higher doses, a high dose would be 20 milligrams,</p>
<p>not 2.5 milligrams.</p>
<p>But consistently it can somewhat affect</p>
<p>with the cones in the eye</p>
<p>that have to do with red and green sight.</p>
<p>Although if you remove it, that effect is reversed.</p>
<p>So basically if you don&rsquo;t need really, really good</p>
<p>red green discrimination, you can take higher doses.</p>
<p>But in general, I recommend no higher</p>
<p>than 10 milligrams a day,</p>
<p>usually just two or five milligrams.</p>
<p>One other benefit or other use of Tadalafil</p>
<p>is that it increases the density of the androgen receptor,</p>
<p>similarly to L-carnitine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting benefit.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that if you give it to people</p>
<p>with nocturia, which is urinating at night in general,</p>
<p>it will cut the episodes in half.</p>
<p>So it could go from two to one,</p>
<p>which can make a big difference for your sleep,</p>
<p>which will secondarily make a big difference</p>
<p>for your growth hormone and testosterone optimization.</p>
<p>Interesting, so you said 2.5 to five milligrams per day</p>
<p>is kind of typical for these prostate enhancing effects.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you mentioned the potential side effects</p>
<p>on adjusting visual perception.</p>
<p>As a vision scientist, that rings in my mind.</p>
<p>But in terms of red green color discrimination,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing, unless you&rsquo;re gonna be a subject</p>
<p>in one of the experiments in my lab,</p>
<p>or you wanna be a fighter pilot,</p>
<p>chances are you can probably get away</p>
<p>with a little less red green color discrimination.</p>
<p>Correct, it&rsquo;s not considered clinically significant</p>
<p>unless someone is a commercial pilot.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So if someone&rsquo;s getting their like pilot exam,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the things we look for.</p>
<p>Okay, so commercial pilots aside,</p>
<p>you might wanna ask your doctor about low dose Tadalafil</p>
<p>for sake of enhancing prostate health.</p>
<p>Certainly monitoring PSA,</p>
<p>prostate-specific antigen is important.</p>
<p>I can give an anecdote there.</p>
<p>When I tried Cermoralin,</p>
<p>one of the surprising side effects that was not welcome</p>
<p>was a dramatic spike in my prostate-specific antigen.</p>
<p>No one could explain to me why that would happen.</p>
<p>But when I stopped taking Cermoralin,</p>
<p>it went back to normal.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one reason I avoid Cermoralin,</p>
<p>at least frequent use of Cermoralin.</p>
<p>PSA should be kept what below levels of,</p>
<p>you know, somewhere between one and four</p>
<p>is considered healthy, is that right?</p>
<p>It depends on the age.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a 20 year old, likely between zero and one.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a 40 year old, likely between one and three.</p>
<p>And then if there&rsquo;s an 80 year old,</p>
<p>it would not be abnormal to have a PSA of five</p>
<p>and have that be well within the reference range.</p>
<p>Another thing we should mention about PSAs,</p>
<p>if you do take a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor,</p>
<p>like finasteride or dutasteride,</p>
<p>often these will cut your PSA in half.</p>
<p>So if you, for example, if you have a PSA of six</p>
<p>and you start finasteride or dutasteride,</p>
<p>and then you recheck it in six months, and it&rsquo;s 6.5,</p>
<p>that is a huge concern because that&rsquo;s actually doubled.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you brought this up</p>
<p>because I almost overlooked the fact</p>
<p>that I get a lot of questions about drugs</p>
<p>to offset hair loss.</p>
<p>Most of those drugs are going to operate</p>
<p>through the DHT system, the dihydrotestosterone system,</p>
<p>for the reasons we talked about before,</p>
<p>DHT receptors being on the scalp</p>
<p>and causing beard growth on the face.</p>
<p>Is it the case that a number of people</p>
<p>taking things like Propecia and other things</p>
<p>to block the DHT or disrupt the DHT pathway</p>
<p>are going to experience diminished sex drive,</p>
<p>diminished kind of motivation and general vigor?</p>
<p>And if so, are there alternatives</p>
<p>like topical DHT antagonists that they might use</p>
<p>if they want to keep their hair</p>
<p>but not have those negative effects?</p>
<p>The way that I think about hair loss</p>
<p>is you have your fertilizers,</p>
<p>also known as a growth agonist,</p>
<p>and then you have your antiandrogens.</p>
<p>Whether they&rsquo;re systemic or topical, there is both,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the general layman&rsquo;s way to think about hair loss.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only putting fertilizer in your hair,</p>
<p>but you have androgenic alopecia or male pattern baldness,</p>
<p>then those hairs will still miniaturize,</p>
<p>and eventually you&rsquo;ll still have loss.</p>
<p>Such a great word, miniaturize.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enough to send anybody off to find a therapeutic.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s difficult to tell</p>
<p>if miniaturization is happening</p>
<p>unless you have a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>You can use it for that.</p>
<p>I almost didn&rsquo;t know, for a second there,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know whether or not you were making a joke.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about miniaturization of the hair follicle.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So what can reverse that miniaturization?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just a fun word to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna just keep saying it.</p>
<p>Each individual has, again,</p>
<p>we mentioned the androgen receptor.</p>
<p>Males only have one androgen receptor gene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on their X chromosome.</p>
<p>So depending on how sensitive that androgen receptor is</p>
<p>and depending on the density of the receptors</p>
<p>in the hair follicle,</p>
<p>you can have a arbitrary threshold</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know what this threshold is</p>
<p>until you start to have miniaturization and loss of hair.</p>
<p>But over the threshold, the follicle will die</p>
<p>and eventually the stem cell will leave.</p>
<p>But under the threshold, you&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>Every androgen binds to the same androgen receptor.</p>
<p>So there is nothing special about DHT.</p>
<p>DHT is just a stronger androgen.</p>
<p>So the higher your SHBG,</p>
<p>things that increase SHBG</p>
<p>are beneficial for hair loss prevention</p>
<p>because you have less binding of that receptor.</p>
<p>So if you think about hair loss,</p>
<p>specifically androgenic or male pattern baldness</p>
<p>in the terms of that androgen receptor</p>
<p>and everything in general binding to it,</p>
<p>not just DHT, but also testosterone, it&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that DHT is a huge battering ram</p>
<p>whereas the other androgens</p>
<p>are just light presses on the door.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So are some of the topical DHT receptor antagonists</p>
<p>going to be a better choice</p>
<p>for people that want to maintain their hair</p>
<p>or grow more hair if they wanna avoid side effects?</p>
<p>Likely so.</p>
<p>Some individuals benefit from systemic,</p>
<p>a systemic decrease in DHT for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One could be prostate</p>
<p>and then one could actually be hypertrophy</p>
<p>of the myocardium.</p>
<p>So DHT also disproportionately thickens the ventricle.</p>
<p>So for someone on TRT, that might be a benefit</p>
<p>that is prone to thickening of the ventricle at baseline.</p>
<p>However, many people that have just a bit of predisposition,</p>
<p>they can use things that are topical anti-androgens.</p>
<p>Ketoconazole is one of them.</p>
<p>Caffeine is actually another one.</p>
<p>Wait, drinking caffeine?</p>
<p>Topical caffeine.</p>
<p>Oh, I was gonna say, my hair tends to grow pretty fast</p>
<p>so it might be that, but I drink a lot of caffeine.</p>
<p>So topical caffeine, really rubbing coffee on their head</p>
<p>or taking caffeine tablets and how does it,</p>
<p>wait, you have to explain how this works.</p>
<p>How do people get caffeine into the hair follicle?</p>
<p>Topically, the caffeine enters the scalp</p>
<p>and crowds out, like somewhat crowds out the androgen.</p>
<p>It is a weak effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely just strong enough to be clinically significant.</p>
<p>Usually caffeine is put into formulations</p>
<p>with other things like ketoconazole</p>
<p>that are also weak anti-androgens.</p>
<p>Of note, spironolactone can be prescribed topically,</p>
<p>but it is absorbed systemically</p>
<p>because the size of the molecule.</p>
<p>So unless your doctor specifically prescribes that for you,</p>
<p>especially as a male, do not use topical spironolactone.</p>
<p>Topical finasteride is also a smaller molecule.</p>
<p>So it is also systemically absorbed,</p>
<p>but it is not extremely well systemically absorbed.</p>
<p>If you take topical finasteride,</p>
<p>then usually your systemic DHT will decrease by about 30%.</p>
<p>Topical dutasteride is likely a tiny bit</p>
<p>systemically absorbed, but it&rsquo;s unique</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s half-life is much faster at a lower dose.</p>
<p>So topical dutasteride will not affect</p>
<p>your systemic DHT at all.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen this anecdotally on many people</p>
<p>on topical dutasteride therapy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to get you back on here</p>
<p>and do an episode all about DHT</p>
<p>and hair loss and hair growth.</p>
<p>Again, not a topic that I focus on a lot for myself,</p>
<p>but that I get a lot of questions about for men and women.</p>
<p>One thing that we could mention,</p>
<p>I got a ton of questions about turmeric</p>
<p>and curcuminoids after last episode.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, but I had reported my own anecdotal experience</p>
<p>that taking turmeric really crushed my DHT levels</p>
<p>and I did not feel good.</p>
<p>I mean, it crushed all sorts of positive feelings</p>
<p>of vitality.</p>
<p>The moment I stopped taking turmeric, felt great again.</p>
<p>Many people report this.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing about turmeric</p>
<p>is most of it&rsquo;s beneficial action, not all of it.</p>
<p>Some people benefit from systemic turmeric</p>
<p>and some people that can tolerate it well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually great for the prostate.</p>
<p>But most of the action, it does not need to be bioavailable.</p>
<p>It acts on the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So you can take turmeric and if it is not absorbed,</p>
<p>some turmeric is put in special formulations</p>
<p>like micellar or liposomal or complexed,</p>
<p>but a lot of it is put with black pepper fruit extract,</p>
<p>which is also known as bio-purine,</p>
<p>which is actually also a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor</p>
<p>and it affects liver cytochromes.</p>
<p>And so many supplement companies</p>
<p>put this black pepper fruit extract,</p>
<p>bio-purine in almost everything.</p>
<p>So some people are on really high doses</p>
<p>and that could also be making most of the effect</p>
<p>of people who do not tolerate turmeric well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I avoid turmeric like the plague</p>
<p>based on that one previous experience</p>
<p>because it was clearly turmeric</p>
<p>that caused the negative effect coming off it,</p>
<p>everything reversed rapidly.</p>
<p>And the bio-purine, the black pepper extract,</p>
<p>I also avoid that like the plague</p>
<p>based on everything you just said.</p>
<p>I want my 5-alpha reductase, I want my DHT to be optimized</p>
<p>simply because my understanding is DHT</p>
<p>is the more powerful androgen</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the one that, yes,</p>
<p>it causes a little bit of hair loss</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve got a few patches here and there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m willing to live with that</p>
<p>based on all the other wonderful things</p>
<p>that DHT optimization does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll quickly mention a few other things.</p>
<p>One, salpalmetto is also a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor,</p>
<p>but only a couple of the isoenzymes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three main isoenzymes</p>
<p>and a lot of the problem is that you&rsquo;re inhibiting</p>
<p>a couple of the isoenzymes, but not the other one.</p>
<p>Finasteride inhibits one and two.</p>
<p>Dutasteride actually inhibits all three.</p>
<p>And finasteride inhibits the isoenzyme</p>
<p>that is in genital skin,</p>
<p>but not in the skin throughout the rest of your body.</p>
<p>So a lot of the side effects of finasteride,</p>
<p>which is loss of sensation and loss of erectile function</p>
<p>have to do with the disconcordance</p>
<p>between the sensitivity of the genital skin and the skin.</p>
<p>Again, another reason to not disrupt 5-alpha reductase.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll definitely get you back on here</p>
<p>to talk about, I think we should just do a whole episode</p>
<p>about DHT, because so often when people are thinking</p>
<p>about optimizing hormones,</p>
<p>especially males trying to optimize their hormones,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking testosterone, testosterone.</p>
<p>Maybe nowadays they think a little bit more</p>
<p>about free testosterone,</p>
<p>and maybe they think about estrogen</p>
<p>as also being important not to crush estrogen,</p>
<p>but DHT is, at least to my mind,</p>
<p>the linchpin of so many of the things</p>
<p>that subjectively people are really focused on,</p>
<p>libido, motivation, drive, et cetera.</p>
<p>I have one final question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a brief one,</p>
<p>but many of us have heard that the BPAs</p>
<p>that are present in plastic bottles</p>
<p>and even in certain aluminum cans,</p>
<p>and phthalates, a difficult word to pronounce,</p>
<p>but a fun one nonetheless,</p>
<p>phthalates and work by Dr. Shana Swan</p>
<p>has shown that phthalate exposure to the fetus,</p>
<p>to pregnant mothers and the fetuses,</p>
<p>very likely is negatively impacting sperm counts,</p>
<p>testosterone levels, and even changing genitalia size</p>
<p>for the worse.</p>
<p>In males nowadays, I saw a beautiful lecture</p>
<p>that Dr. Shana Swan did on this when I was in Copenhagen,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s negatively impacting the male fetus.</p>
<p>She was also on Joe Rogan&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>I hope to get her on this podcast.</p>
<p>However, what she couldn&rsquo;t answer for me</p>
<p>was whether or not phthalates and BPAs</p>
<p>and these things present in plastics,</p>
<p>and some people even claim in tap water,</p>
<p>are bad for males after they&rsquo;re born and after puberty.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on,</p>
<p>or I should just ask you,</p>
<p>do you drink water out of plastic bottles?</p>
<p>Do you avoid drinking out of cans</p>
<p>that are not specifically non-BPA containing cans?</p>
<p>And do you actively avoid phthalates?</p>
<p>My understanding is that phthalates</p>
<p>are most enriched in pesticides,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re seeing dramatic drops in sperm</p>
<p>and testosterone levels,</p>
<p>mainly in rural areas where they&rsquo;re dust cropping.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I do avoid drinking out of cans that,</p>
<p>or plastics that may have BPA or bisphenol A in them.</p>
<p>Bisphenol A is known to bind to</p>
<p>what I would consider the fifth estrogen receptor,</p>
<p>estrogen-related receptor gamma.</p>
<p>So I would consider it a xenoestrogen.</p>
<p>So phytoestrogens are estrogens from plants,</p>
<p>and in general, they&rsquo;re not concerning</p>
<p>or clinically significant,</p>
<p>and xenoestrogens are just other estrogens.</p>
<p>So I do avoid BPA, and I also test my water.</p>
<p>I use a water testing service,</p>
<p>and I test it both after it&rsquo;s through my water filter</p>
<p>and the tap water that my two boys drink almost every day.</p>
<p>And it was very interesting.</p>
<p>I only found one microplastic</p>
<p>just a bit over the reference range.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t a terrible tap score,</p>
<p>but even in developed countries, these are widely variable.</p>
<p>As far as phthalates, again,</p>
<p>very difficult and interesting to pronounce,</p>
<p>but I remember learning about these</p>
<p>because there was, I believe, a lawsuit</p>
<p>that had to do with mac and cheese.</p>
<p>And this was probably five years ago,</p>
<p>and I was coming up with my list of,</p>
<p>each provider that does obstetrics has a list</p>
<p>what to avoid for the pregnant lady,</p>
<p>sketchy deli meats or high mercury fish</p>
<p>like swordfish and salmon,</p>
<p>and I actually added processed mac and cheese to that list.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to extract your statement</p>
<p>that you avoid drinking out of plastic bottles</p>
<p>when possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re not neurotically attached to that.</p>
<p>If you were dying of thirst,</p>
<p>you might crack a plastic bottle of water to survive.</p>
<p>But listen, Kyle, Dr. Gillette, thank you so much.</p>
