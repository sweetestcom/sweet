    <p>The following is a conversation with Jim Keller,</p>
<p>his second time in the podcast.</p>
<p>Jim is a legendary microprocessor architect</p>
<p>and is widely seen as one of the greatest</p>
<p>engineering minds of the computing age.</p>
<p>In a peculiar twist of space time in our simulation,</p>
<p>Jim is also a brother in law of Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>We talk about this and about computing,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence, consciousness, and life.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that Jim is someone who,</p>
<p>on a personal level, inspired me to be myself.</p>
<p>There was something in his words, on and off the mic,</p>
<p>or perhaps that he even paid attention to me at all,</p>
<p>that almost told me, you&rsquo;re all right, kid.</p>
<p>A kind of pat on the back that can make the difference</p>
<p>between a mind that flourishes</p>
<p>and a mind that is broken down</p>
<p>by the cynicism of the world.</p>
<p>So I guess that&rsquo;s just my brief few words</p>
<p>of thank you to Jim, and in general,</p>
<p>gratitude for the people who have given me a chance</p>
<p>on this podcast, in my work, and in life.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Jim Keller.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the value and effectiveness</p>
<p>of theory versus engineering, this dichotomy,</p>
<p>in building good software or hardware systems?</p>
<p>Well, good design is both.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s pretty obvious.</p>
<p>By engineering, do you mean reduction of practice</p>
<p>of known methods?</p>
<p>And then science is the pursuit of discovering things</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Or solving unknown problems.</p>
<p>Definitions are interesting here,</p>
<p>but I was thinking more in theory,</p>
<p>constructing models that kind of generalize</p>
<p>about how things work.</p>
<p>And engineering is actually building stuff.</p>
<p>The pragmatic, like, okay, we have these nice models,</p>
<p>but how do we actually get things to work?</p>
<p>Maybe economics is a nice example.</p>
<p>Like, economists have all these models</p>
<p>of how the economy works,</p>
<p>and how different policies will have an effect,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s the actual, okay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call it engineering,</p>
<p>of like, actually deploying the policies.</p>
<p>So computer design is almost all engineering.</p>
<p>And reduction of practice of known methods.</p>
<p>Now, because of the complexity of the computers we built,</p>
<p>you know, you could think you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;ll just go write some code,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll verify it, and then we&rsquo;ll put it together,</p>
<p>and then you find out that the combination</p>
<p>of all that stuff is complicated.</p>
<p>And then you have to be inventive</p>
<p>to figure out how to do it, right?</p>
<p>So that definitely happens a lot.</p>
<p>And then, every so often, some big idea happens.</p>
<p>But it might be one person.</p>
<p>And that idea is in the space of engineering,</p>
<p>or is it in the space of&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>So one of the limits of computer performance</p>
<p>is branch prediction.</p>
<p>So, and there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of ideas</p>
<p>about how good you could predict a branch.</p>
<p>And people said, there&rsquo;s a limit to it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an asymptotic curve.</p>
<p>And somebody came up with a better way</p>
<p>to do branch prediction, it was a lot better.</p>
<p>And he published a paper on it,</p>
<p>and every computer in the world now uses it.</p>
<p>And it was one idea.</p>
<p>So the engineers who build branch prediction hardware</p>
<p>were happy to drop the one kind of training array</p>
<p>and put it in another one.</p>
<p>So it was a real idea.</p>
<p>And branch prediction is one of the key problems</p>
<p>underlying all of sort of the lowest level of software.</p>
<p>It boils down to branch prediction.</p>
<p>Boils down to uncertainty.</p>
<p>Computers are limited by&hellip;</p>
<p>Single thread computer is limited by two things.</p>
<p>The predictability of the path of the branches</p>
<p>and the predictability of the locality of data.</p>
<p>So we have predictors that now predict</p>
<p>both of those pretty well.</p>
<p>So memory is a couple hundred cycles away,</p>
<p>local cache is a couple cycles away.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re executing fast,</p>
<p>virtually all the data has to be in the local cache.</p>
<p>So a simple program says,</p>
<p>add one to every element in an array,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really easy to see what the stream of data will be.</p>
<p>But you might have a more complicated program</p>
<p>that says, get an element of this array,</p>
<p>look at something, make a decision,</p>
<p>go get another element, it&rsquo;s kind of random.</p>
<p>And you can think, that&rsquo;s really unpredictable.</p>
<p>And then you make this big predictor</p>
<p>that looks at this kind of pattern and you realize,</p>
<p>well, if you get this data and this data,</p>
<p>then you probably want that one.</p>
<p>And if you get this one and this one and this one,</p>
<p>you probably want that one.</p>
<p>And is that theory or is that engineering?</p>
<p>Like the paper that was written,</p>
<p>was it asymptotic kind of discussion</p>
<p>or is it more like, here&rsquo;s a hack that works well?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit of both.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s information theory in it, I think somewhere.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s actually trying to prove some kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But once you know the method,</p>
<p>implementing it is an engineering problem.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a flip side of this,</p>
<p>which is in a big design team,</p>
<p>what percentage of people think</p>
<p>their plan or their life&rsquo;s work is engineering</p>
<p>versus inventing things?</p>
<p>So lots of companies will reward you for filing patents.</p>
<p>Some, many big companies get stuck</p>
<p>because to get promoted,</p>
<p>you have to come up with something new.</p>
<p>And then what happens is everybody&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to do some random new thing,</p>
<p>99% of which doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And the basics get neglected.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a dichotomy, they think like the cell library</p>
<p>and the basic CAD tools or basic software validation methods,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s simple stuff.</p>
<p>They wanna work on the exciting stuff.</p>
<p>And then they spend lots of time</p>
<p>trying to figure out how to patent something.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s mostly useless.</p>
<p>But the breakthrough is on simple stuff.</p>
<p>No, no, you have to do the simple stuff really well.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building a building out of bricks,</p>
<p>you want great bricks.</p>
<p>So you go to two places that sell bricks.</p>
<p>So one guy says, yeah, they&rsquo;re over there in a ugly pile.</p>
<p>And the other guy is like lovingly tells you</p>
<p>about the 50 kinds of bricks and how hard they are</p>
<p>and how beautiful they are and how square they are.</p>
<p>Which one are you gonna buy bricks from?</p>
<p>Which is gonna make a better house?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re talking about the craftsman,</p>
<p>the person who understands bricks,</p>
<p>who loves bricks, who loves the varieties.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good word.</p>
<p>Good engineering is great craftsmanship.</p>
<p>And when you start thinking engineering is about invention</p>
<p>and you set up a system that rewards invention,</p>
<p>the craftsmanship gets neglected.</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe one perspective is the theory,</p>
<p>the science overemphasizes invention</p>
<p>and engineering emphasizes craftsmanship.</p>
<p>And therefore, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do,</p>
<p>theory, engineering. Well, everybody does.</p>
<p>Like read the tech ranks are always talking</p>
<p>about some breakthrough or innovation</p>
<p>and everybody thinks that&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>
<p>But the number of innovative ideas</p>
<p>is actually relatively low.</p>
<p>We need them, right?</p>
<p>And innovation creates a whole new opportunity.</p>
<p>Like when some guy invented the internet, right?</p>
<p>Like that was a big thing.</p>
<p>The million people that wrote software against that</p>
<p>were mostly doing engineering software writing.</p>
<p>So the elaboration of that idea was huge.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know Brendan Eich,</p>
<p>he wrote JavaScript in 10 days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting story.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder, and it was famously for many years</p>
<p>considered to be a pretty crappy programming language.</p>
<p>Still is perhaps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been improving sort of consistently.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing about that guy is,</p>
<p>you know, he doesn&rsquo;t get any awards.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get a Nobel Prize or a Fields Medal or.</p>
<p>For inventing a crappy piece of, you know, software code.</p>
<p>That is currently the number one programming language</p>
<p>in the world and runs,</p>
<p>now is increasingly running the backend of the internet.</p>
<p>Well, does he know why everybody uses it?</p>
<p>Like that would be an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Was it the right thing at the right time?</p>
<p>Cause like when stuff like JavaScript came out,</p>
<p>like there was a move from, you know,</p>
<p>writing C programs and C++ to what they call</p>
<p>managed code frameworks,</p>
<p>where you write simple code, it might be interpreted,</p>
<p>it has lots of libraries, productivity is high,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to be an expert.</p>
<p>So, you know, Java was supposed to solve</p>
<p>all the world&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>It was complicated.</p>
<p>JavaScript came out, you know,</p>
<p>after a bunch of other scripting languages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on it.</p>
<p>But was it the right thing at the right time?</p>
<p>Or was there something, you know, clever?</p>
<p>Cause he wasn&rsquo;t the only one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few elements.</p>
<p>And maybe if he figured out what it was,</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;d get a prize.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, maybe his problem is he hasn&rsquo;t defined this.</p>
<p>Or he just needs a good promoter.</p>
<p>Well, I think there was a bunch of blog posts</p>
<p>written about it, which is like,</p>
<p>wrong is right, which is like doing the crappy thing fast.</p>
<p>Just like hacking together the thing</p>
<p>that answers some of the needs.</p>
<p>And then iterating over time, listening to developers.</p>
<p>Like listening to people who actually use the thing.</p>
<p>This is something you can do more in software.</p>
<p>But the right time, like you have to sense,</p>
<p>you have to have a good instinct</p>
<p>of when is the right time for the right tool.</p>
<p>And make it super simple.</p>
<p>And just get it out there.</p>
<p>The problem is, this is true with hardware.</p>
<p>This is less true with software.</p>
<p>Is there&rsquo;s backward compatibility</p>
<p>that just drags behind you as, you know,</p>
<p>as you try to fix all the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>But the timing.</p>
<p>It was good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about that.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t accidental.</p>
<p>You have to like give yourself over to the,</p>
<p>you have to have this like broad sense</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s needed now.</p>
<p>Both scientifically and like the community.</p>
<p>And just like this, it was obvious that there was no,</p>
<p>the interesting thing about JavaScript</p>
<p>is everything that ran in the browser at the time,</p>
<p>like Java and I think other like Scheme,</p>
<p>other programming languages,</p>
<p>they were all in a separate external container.</p>
<p>And then JavaScript was literally</p>
<p>just injected into the webpage.</p>
<p>It was the dumbest possible thing</p>
<p>running in the same thread as everything else.</p>
<p>And like it was inserted as a comment.</p>
<p>So JavaScript code is inserted as a comment in the HTML code.</p>
<p>And it was, I mean, there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s either genius or super dumb, but it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Right, so it had no apparatus for like a virtual machine</p>
<p>and container, it just executed in the framework</p>
<p>of the program that&rsquo;s already running.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>And then because something about that accessibility,</p>
<p>the ease of its use resulted in then developers innovating</p>
<p>of how to actually use it.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t even know what to make of that,</p>
<p>but it does seem to echo across different software,</p>
<p>like stories of different software.</p>
<p>PHP has the same story, really crappy language.</p>
<p>They just took over the world.</p>
<p>I always have a joke that the random length instructions,</p>
<p>variable length instructions, that&rsquo;s always one,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re obviously worse.</p>
<p>Like nobody knows why.</p>
<p>X86 is arguably the worst architecture on the planet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most popular ones.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, isn&rsquo;t that also the story of risk versus,</p>
<p>I mean, is that simplicity?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about simplicity that us</p>
<p>in this evolutionary process is valued.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s simple, it spreads faster, it seems like.</p>
<p>Or is that not always true?</p>
<p>Not always true.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could be simple is good, but too simple is bad.</p>
<p>So why did risk win, you think, so far?</p>
<p>Did risk win?</p>
<p>In the long archivist tree.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s gonna win?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s risk, what&rsquo;s CISC, and who&rsquo;s gonna win in that space</p>
<p>in these instruction sets?</p>
<p>AI software&rsquo;s gonna win, but there&rsquo;ll be little computers</p>
<p>that run little programs like normal all over the place.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re going through another transformation, so.</p>
<p>But you think instruction sets underneath it all will change?</p>
<p>Yeah, they evolve slowly.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t matter very much.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t matter very much, okay.</p>
<p>I mean, the limits of performance are predictability</p>
<p>of instructions and data.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the big thing.</p>
<p>And then the usability of it is some quality of design,</p>
<p>quality of tools, availability.</p>
<p>Like right now, x86 is proprietary with Intel and AMD,</p>
<p>but they can change it any way they want independently.</p>
<p>ARM is proprietary to ARM,</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t let anybody else change it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a sole point.</p>
<p>And RISC 5 is open source, so anybody can change it,</p>
<p>which is super cool.</p>
<p>But that also might mean it gets changed</p>
<p>too many random ways that there&rsquo;s no common subset of it</p>
<p>that people can use.</p>
<p>Do you like open or do you like closed?</p>
<p>Like if you were to bet all your money on one</p>
<p>or the other, RISC 5 versus it?</p>
<p>No idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s case dependent?</p>
<p>Well, x86, oddly enough, when Intel first started</p>
<p>developing it, they licensed like seven people.</p>
<p>So it was the open architecture.</p>
<p>And then they moved faster than others</p>
<p>and also bought one or two of them.</p>
<p>But there was seven different people making x86</p>
<p>because at the time there was 6502 and Z80s and 8086.</p>
<p>And you could argue everybody thought Z80</p>
<p>was the better instruction set,</p>
<p>but that was proprietary to one place.</p>
<p>Oh, and the 6800.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like four or five different microprocessors.</p>
<p>Intel went open, got the market share</p>
<p>because people felt like they had multiple sources from it,</p>
<p>and then over time it narrowed down to two players.</p>
<p>So why, you as a historian, why did Intel win for so long</p>
<p>with their processors?</p>
<p>I mean, I mean.</p>
<p>They were great.</p>
<p>Their process development was great.</p>
<p>Oh, so it&rsquo;s just looking back to JavaScript</p>
<p>and what I like is Microsoft and Netscape</p>
<p>and all these internet browsers.</p>
<p>Microsoft won the browser game</p>
<p>because they aggressively stole other people&rsquo;s ideas</p>
<p>like right after they did it.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if Intel was stealing other people&rsquo;s ideas.</p>
<p>They started making.</p>
<p>In a good way, stealing in a good way just to clarify.</p>
<p>They started making RAMs, random access memories.</p>
<p>And then at the time</p>
<p>when the Japanese manufacturers came up,</p>
<p>you know, they were getting out competed on that</p>
<p>and they pivoted the microprocessors</p>
<p>and they made the first, you know,</p>
<p>integrated microprocessor grant programs.</p>
<p>It was the 4D04 or something.</p>
<p>Who was behind that pivot?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hell of a pivot.</p>
<p>Andy Grove and he was great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hell of a pivot.</p>
<p>And then they led semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>Like they were just a little company, IBM,</p>
<p>all kinds of big companies had boatloads of money</p>
<p>and they out innovated everybody.</p>
<p>Out innovated, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like marketing, it&rsquo;s not any of that stuff.</p>
<p>Their processor designs were pretty good.</p>
<p>I think the, you know, Core 2 was probably the first one</p>
<p>I thought was great.</p>
<p>It was a really fast processor and then Haswell was great.</p>
<p>What makes a great processor in that?</p>
<p>Oh, if you just look at it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s performance versus everybody else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, the size of it, the usability of it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not specific,</p>
<p>some kind of element that makes you beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like literally just raw performance.</p>
<p>Is that how you think about processors?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like raw performance?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a horse race.</p>
<p>The fastest one wins.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care how.</p>
<p>Just as long as it wins.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s the fastest in the environment.</p>
<p>Like, you know, for years you made the fastest one you could</p>
<p>and then people started to have power limits.</p>
<p>So then you made the fastest at the right PowerPoint.</p>
<p>And then when we started doing multi processors,</p>
<p>like if you could scale your processors</p>
<p>more than the other guy,</p>
<p>you could be 10% faster on like a single thread,</p>
<p>but you have more threads.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots of variability.</p>
<p>And then ARM really explored,</p>
<p>like, you know, they have the A series</p>
<p>and the R series and the M series,</p>
<p>like a family of processors</p>
<p>for all these different design points</p>
<p>from like unbelievably small and simple.</p>
<p>And so then when you&rsquo;re doing the design,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like this big pallet of CPUs.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re the only ones with a credible,</p>
<p>you know, top to bottom pallet.</p>
<p>What do you mean a credible top to bottom?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s people who make microcontrollers</p>
<p>that are small, but they don&rsquo;t have a fast one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who make fast processors,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t have a medium one or a small one.</p>
<p>Is that hard to do that full pallet?</p>
<p>That seems like a&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a lot of different.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference in the ARM folks and Intel</p>
<p>in terms of the way they&rsquo;re approaching this problem?</p>
<p>Well, Intel, almost all their processor designs</p>
<p>were, you know, very custom high end,</p>
<p>you know, for the last 15, 20 years.</p>
<p>So the fastest horse possible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In one horse race.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then architecturally they&rsquo;re really good,</p>
<p>but the company itself was fairly insular</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s going on in the industry with CAD tools and stuff.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this debate about custom design</p>
<p>versus synthesis and how do you approach that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say Intel was slow on getting to synthesize processors.</p>
<p>ARM came in from the bottom and they generated IP,</p>
<p>which went to all kinds of customers.</p>
<p>So they had very little say</p>
<p>on how the customer implemented their IP.</p>
<p>So ARM is super friendly to the synthesis IP environment.</p>
<p>Whereas Intel said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna make this great client chip or server chip</p>
<p>with our own CAD tools, with our own process,</p>
<p>with our own, you know, other supporting IP</p>
<p>and everything only works with our stuff.</p>
<p>So is that, is ARM winning the mobile platform space</p>
<p>in terms of process?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so in that, what you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>is why they&rsquo;re winning.</p>
<p>Well, they had lots of people doing lots</p>
<p>of different experiments.</p>
<p>So they controlled the processor architecture and IP,</p>
<p>but they let people put in lots of different chips.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of variability in what happened there.</p>
<p>Whereas Intel, when they made their mobile,</p>
<p>their foray into mobile,</p>
<p>they had one team doing one part, right?</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t 10 experiments.</p>
<p>And then their mindset was PC mindset,</p>
<p>Microsoft software mindset.</p>
<p>And that brought a whole bunch of things along</p>
<p>that the mobile world and the embedded world don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Do you think it was possible for Intel to pivot hard</p>
<p>and win the mobile market?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hell of a difficult thing to do, right?</p>
<p>For a huge company to just pivot.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so interesting to,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll talk about your current work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s clear that PCs were dominating</p>
<p>for several decades, like desktop computers.</p>
<p>And then mobile, it&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a leadership question.</p>
<p>Like Apple under Steve Jobs, when he came back,</p>
<p>they pivoted multiple times.</p>
<p>You know, they built iPads and iTunes and phones</p>
<p>and tablets and great Macs.</p>
<p>Like who knew computers should be made out of aluminum?</p>
<p>Nobody knew that.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super fun.</p>
<p>That was Steve?</p>
<p>Yeah, Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Like they pivoted multiple times.</p>
<p>And you know, the old Intel, they did that multiple times.</p>
<p>They made DRAMs and processors and processes</p>
<p>and I gotta ask this,</p>
<p>what was it like working with Steve Jobs?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t work with him.</p>
<p>Did you interact with him?</p>
<p>Twice.</p>
<p>I said hi to him twice in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>What did he say?</p>
<p>Hi?</p>
<p>He said, hey fellas.</p>
<p>He was friendly.</p>
<p>He was wandering around and with somebody,</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t find a table because the cafeteria was packed</p>
<p>and I gave him my table.</p>
<p>But I worked for Mike Colbert who talked to,</p>
<p>like Mike was the unofficial CTO of Apple</p>
<p>and a brilliant guy and he worked for Steve for 25 years,</p>
<p>maybe more and he talked to Steve multiple times a day</p>
<p>and he was one of the people who could put up with Steve&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, brilliance and intensity</p>
<p>and Steve really liked him and Steve trusted Mike</p>
<p>to translate the shit he thought up</p>
<p>into engineering products that work</p>
<p>and then Mike ran a group called Platform Architecture</p>
<p>and I was in that group.</p>
<p>So many times I&rsquo;d be sitting with Mike</p>
<p>and the phone would ring and it&rsquo;d be Steve</p>
<p>and Mike would hold the phone like this</p>
<p>because Steve would be yelling about something or other.</p>
<p>And then he would translate.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d translate and then he would say,</p>
<p>Steve wants us to do this.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Was Steve a good engineer or no?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He was a great idea guy.</p>
<p>Idea person.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a really good selector for talent.</p>
<p>Yeah, that seems to be one of the key elements</p>
<p>of leadership, right?</p>
<p>And then he was a really good first principles guy.</p>
<p>Like somebody would say something couldn&rsquo;t be done</p>
<p>and he would just think, that&rsquo;s obviously wrong, right?</p>
<p>But you know, maybe it&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s expensive to do.</p>
<p>Maybe we need different people.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like a whole bunch of,</p>
<p>if you want to do something hard,</p>
<p>you know, maybe it takes time.</p>
<p>Maybe you have to iterate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of things you could think about</p>
<p>but saying it can&rsquo;t be done is stupid.</p>
<p>How would you compare?</p>
<p>So it seems like Elon Musk is more engineering centric</p>
<p>but is also, I think he considers himself a designer too.</p>
<p>He has a design mind.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs feels like he&rsquo;s much more idea space,</p>
<p>design space versus engineering.</p>
<p>Just make it happen.</p>
<p>Like the world should be this way.</p>
<p>Just figure it out.</p>
<p>But he used computers.</p>
<p>You know, he had computer people talk to him all the time.</p>
<p>Like Mike was a really good computer guy.</p>
<p>He knew computers could do.</p>
<p>Computer meaning computer hardware?</p>
<p>Like hardware, software, all the pieces.</p>
<p>And then he would have an idea about</p>
<p>what could we do with this next.</p>
<p>That was grounded in reality.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like he was just finger painting on the wall</p>
<p>and wishing somebody would interpret it.</p>
<p>So he had this interesting connection</p>
<p>because he wasn&rsquo;t a computer architect or designer</p>
<p>but he had an intuition from the computers we had</p>
<p>to what could happen.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting you say intuition</p>
<p>because it seems like he was pissing off a lot of engineers</p>
<p>in his intuition about what can and can&rsquo;t be done.</p>
<p>Those, like the, what is all these stories</p>
<p>about like floppy disks and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, so in Steve, the first round,</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;d go into a lab and look at what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and hate it and fire people or ask somebody</p>
<p>in the elevator what they&rsquo;re doing for Apple.</p>
<p>And not be happy.</p>
<p>When he came back, my impression was</p>
<p>is he surrounded himself</p>
<p>with a relatively small group of people</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t really interact outside of that as much.</p>
<p>And then the joke was you&rsquo;d see like somebody moving</p>
<p>a prototype through the quad with a black blanket over it.</p>
<p>And that was because it was secret, partly from Steve</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t want Steve to see it until it was ready.</p>
<p>Yeah, the dynamic with Johnny Ive and Steve is interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t wanna,</p>
<p>he ruins as many ideas as he generates.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dangerous kind of line to walk.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of ideas,</p>
<p>like Gordon Bell was famous for ideas, right?</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t that the percentage of good ideas</p>
<p>was way higher than anybody else.</p>
<p>It was, he had so many ideas</p>
<p>and he was also good at talking to people about it</p>
<p>and getting the filters right.</p>
<p>And seeing through stuff.</p>
<p>Whereas Elon was like, hey, I wanna build rockets.</p>
<p>So Steve would hire a bunch of rocket guys</p>
<p>and Elon would go read rocket manuals.</p>
<p>So Elon is a better engineer, a sense like,</p>
<p>or like more like a love and passion for the manuals.</p>
<p>And the details.</p>
<p>The details, the craftsmanship too, right?</p>
<p>Well, I guess Steve had craftsmanship too,</p>
<p>but of a different kind.</p>
<p>What do you make of the,</p>
<p>just to stay in there for just a little longer,</p>
<p>what do you make of like the anger</p>
<p>and the passion and all of that?</p>
<p>The firing and the mood swings and the madness,</p>
<p>the being emotional and all of that, that&rsquo;s Steve.</p>
<p>And I guess Elon too.</p>
<p>So what, is that a bug or a feature?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feature.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a graph, which is Y axis productivity,</p>
<p>X axis at zero is chaos,</p>
<p>and infinity is complete order, right?</p>
<p>So as you go from the origin,</p>
<p>as you improve order, you improve productivity.</p>
<p>And at some point, productivity peaks,</p>
<p>and then it goes back down again.</p>
<p>Too much order, nothing can happen.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But the question is, how close to the chaos is that?</p>
<p>No, no, no, here&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>is once you start moving in the direction of order,</p>
<p>the force vector to drive you towards order is unstoppable.</p>
<p>Oh, so it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>And every organization will move to the place</p>
<p>where their productivity is stymied by order.</p>
<p>So you need a&hellip;</p>
<p>So the question is, who&rsquo;s the counter force?</p>
<p>Because it also feels really good.</p>
<p>As you get more organized, the productivity goes up.</p>
<p>The organization feels it, they orient towards it, right?</p>
<p>They hired more people.</p>
<p>They got more guys who couldn&rsquo;t run process,</p>
<p>you get bigger, right?</p>
<p>And then inevitably, the organization gets captured</p>
<p>by the bureaucracy that manages all the processes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, and then humans really like that.</p>
<p>And so if you just walk into a room and say,</p>
<p>guys, love what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but I need you to have less order.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have some force behind that,</p>
<p>nothing will happen.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you on how many levels that&rsquo;s profound, so.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a feature.</p>
<p>Now, could you be nicer about it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know any good examples</p>
<p>of being nicer about it.</p>
<p>Well, the funny thing is to get stuff done,</p>
<p>you need people who can manage stuff and manage people,</p>
<p>because humans are complicated.</p>
<p>They need lots of care and feeding that you need</p>
<p>to tell them they look nice and they&rsquo;re doing good stuff</p>
<p>and pat them on the back, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you tell me, is that needed?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Do humans need that?</p>
<p>I had a friend, he started a magic group and he said,</p>
<p>I figured it out.</p>
<p>You have to praise them before they do anything.</p>
<p>I was waiting until they were done.</p>
<p>And they were always mad at me.</p>
<p>Now I tell them what a great job they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>But then you get stuck in that trap,</p>
<p>because then when they&rsquo;re not doing something,</p>
<p>how do you confront these people?</p>
<p>I think a lot of people that had trauma</p>
<p>in their childhood would disagree with you,</p>
<p>successful people, that you need to first do the rough stuff</p>
<p>and then be nice later.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, but engineering companies are full of adults</p>
<p>who had all kinds of range of childhoods.</p>
<p>You know, most people had okay childhoods.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if&hellip;</p>
<p>Lots of people only work for praise, which is weird.</p>
<p>You mean like everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that interested in it, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re probably looking for somebody&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>Even still.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>I should think about that.</p>
<p>Maybe somebody who&rsquo;s no longer with us kind of thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I used to call up my dad and tell him what I was doing.</p>
<p>He was very excited about engineering and stuff.</p>
<p>You got his approval?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, a lot.</p>
<p>I was lucky.</p>
<p>Like, he decided I was smart and unusual as a kid</p>
<p>and that was okay when I was really young.</p>
<p>So when I did poorly in school, I was dyslexic.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t read until I was third or fourth grade.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>My parents were like, oh, he&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<p>So I was lucky.</p>
<p>That was cool.</p>
<p>Is he still with us?</p>
<p>You miss him?</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>He had Parkinson&rsquo;s and then cancer.</p>
<p>His last 10 years were tough and I killed him.</p>
<p>Killing a man like that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>The mind?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Parkinson&rsquo;s causes slow dementia</p>
<p>and the chemotherapy, I think, accelerated it.</p>
<p>But it was like hallucinogenic dementia.</p>
<p>So he was clever and funny and interesting</p>
<p>and it was pretty unusual.</p>
<p>Do you remember conversations?</p>
<p>From that time?</p>
<p>Like, do you have fond memories of the guy?</p>
<p>Yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p>Anything come to mind?</p>
<p>A friend told me one time I could draw a computer</p>
<p>on the whiteboard faster than anybody he&rsquo;d ever met.</p>
<p>I said, you should meet my dad.</p>
<p>Like, when I was a kid, he&rsquo;d come home and say,</p>
<p>I was driving by this bridge and I was thinking about it</p>
<p>and he pulled out a piece of paper</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d draw the whole bridge.</p>
<p>He was a mechanical engineer.</p>
<p>And he would just draw the whole thing</p>
<p>and then he would tell me about it</p>
<p>and then tell me how he would have changed it.</p>
<p>And he had this idea that he could understand</p>
<p>and conceive anything.</p>
<p>And I just grew up with that, so that was natural.</p>
<p>So when I interview people, I ask them to draw a picture</p>
<p>of something they did on a whiteboard</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Like, some people draw a little box</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll say, and then this talks to this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be like, oh, this is frustrating.</p>
<p>I had this other guy come in one time, he says,</p>
<p>well, I designed a floating point in this chip</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d really like to tell you how the whole thing works</p>
<p>and then tell you how the floating point works inside of it.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I do that?</p>
<p>And he covered two whiteboards in like 30 minutes</p>
<p>and I hired him.</p>
<p>Like, he was great.</p>
<p>This is craftsman.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the craftsmanship to that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but also the mental agility</p>
<p>to understand the whole thing,</p>
<p>put the pieces in context,</p>
<p>real view of the balance of how the design worked.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t understand it properly,</p>
<p>when you start to draw it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll fill up half the whiteboard</p>
<p>with like a little piece of it</p>
<p>and like your ability to lay it out in an understandable way</p>
<p>takes a lot of understanding, so.</p>
<p>And be able to, so zoom into the detail</p>
<p>and then zoom out to the big picture.</p>
<p>Zoom out really fast.</p>
<p>What about the impossible thing?</p>
<p>You see, your dad believed that you can do anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a weird feature for a craftsman.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It seems that that echoes in your own behavior.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not that anybody can do anything right now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that if you work at it, you can get better at it</p>
<p>and there might not be a limit.</p>
<p>And they did funny things like,</p>
<p>like he always wanted to play piano.</p>
<p>So at the end of his life, he started playing the piano</p>
<p>when he had Parkinson&rsquo;s and he was terrible.</p>
<p>But he thought if he really worked out in this life,</p>
<p>maybe the next life he&rsquo;d be better at it.</p>
<p>He might be onto something.</p>
<p>Yeah, he enjoyed doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty funny.</p>
<p>Do you think the perfect is the enemy of the good</p>
<p>in hardware and software engineering?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we were talking about JavaScript a little bit</p>
<p>and the messiness of the 10 day building process.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, creative tension, right?</p>
<p>So creative tension is you have two different ideas</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t do both, right?</p>
<p>And, but the fact that you wanna do both</p>
<p>causes you to go try to solve that problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the creative part.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re building computers,</p>
<p>like some people say we have the schedule</p>
<p>and anything that doesn&rsquo;t fit in the schedule we can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And so they throw out the perfect</p>
<p>because they have a schedule.</p>
<p>I hate that.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s other people who say</p>
<p>we need to get this perfectly right.</p>
<p>And no matter what, you know, more people, more money,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really clear idea about what you want.</p>
<p>Some people are really good at articulating it, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s call that the perfect, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, but that&rsquo;s also terrible</p>
<p>because they never ship anything.</p>
<p>You never hit any goals.</p>
<p>So now you have your framework.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t throw out stuff</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t get it done today</p>
<p>because maybe you&rsquo;ll get it done tomorrow</p>
<p>or the next project, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t, so you have to,</p>
<p>I work with a guy that I really like working with,</p>
<p>but he over filters his ideas.</p>
<p>Over filters?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d start thinking about something</p>
<p>and as soon as he figured out what was wrong with it,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d throw it out.</p>
<p>And then I start thinking about it</p>
<p>and you come up with an idea</p>
<p>and then you find out what&rsquo;s wrong with it.</p>
<p>And then you give it a little time to set</p>
<p>because sometimes you figure out how to tweak it</p>
<p>or maybe that idea helps some other idea.</p>
<p>So idea generation is really funny.</p>
<p>So you have to give your ideas space.</p>
<p>Like spaciousness of mind is key.</p>
<p>But you also have to execute programs and get shit done.</p>
<p>And then it turns out computer engineering is fun</p>
<p>because it takes 100 people to build a computer,</p>
<p>200 or 300, whatever the number is.</p>
<p>And people are so variable about temperament</p>
<p>and skill sets and stuff.</p>
<p>That in a big organization,</p>
<p>you find the people who love the perfect ideas</p>
<p>and the people that want to get stuffed on yesterday</p>
<p>and people like to come up with ideas</p>
<p>and people like to, let&rsquo;s say shoot down ideas.</p>
<p>And it takes the whole, it takes a large group of people.</p>
<p>Some are good at generating ideas, some are good at filtering ideas.</p>
<p>And then all in that giant mess, you&rsquo;re somehow,</p>
<p>I guess the goal is for that giant mess of people</p>
<p>to find the perfect path through the tension,</p>
<p>the creative tension.</p>
<p>But like, how do you know when you said</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people good at articulating</p>
<p>what perfect looks like, what a good design is?</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re sitting in a room</p>
<p>and you have a set of ideas</p>
<p>about like how to design a better processor,</p>
<p>how do you know this is something special here?</p>
<p>This is a good idea, let&rsquo;s try this.</p>
<p>Have you ever brainstormed an idea</p>
<p>with a couple of people that were really smart?</p>
<p>And you kind of go into it and you don&rsquo;t quite understand it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re working on it.</p>
<p>And then you start talking about it,</p>
<p>putting it on the whiteboard, maybe it takes days or weeks.</p>
<p>And then your brain starts to kind of synchronize.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>Like you start to see what each other is thinking.</p>
<p>And it starts to work.</p>
<p>Like you can see work.</p>
<p>Like my talent in computer design</p>
<p>is I can see how computers work in my head, like really well.</p>
<p>And I know other people can do that too.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re working with people that can do that,</p>
<p>like it is kind of an amazing experience.</p>
<p>And then every once in a while you get to that place</p>
<p>and then you find the flaw, which is kind of funny</p>
<p>because you can fool yourself.</p>
<p>The two of you kind of drifted along</p>
<p>in the direction that was useless.</p>
<p>That happens too.</p>
<p>Like you have to, because the nice thing</p>
<p>about computer design is always reduction in practice.</p>
<p>Like you come up with your good ideas</p>
<p>and I know some architects who really love ideas</p>
<p>and then they work on them and they put it on the shelf</p>
<p>and they go work on the next idea and put it on the shelf</p>
<p>and they never reduce it to practice.</p>
<p>So they find out what&rsquo;s good and bad.</p>
<p>Because almost every time I&rsquo;ve done something really new,</p>
<p>by the time it&rsquo;s done, like the good parts are good,</p>
<p>but I know all the flaws, like.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Would you say your career, just your own experience,</p>
<p>is your career defined mostly by flaws or by successes?</p>
<p>Like if&hellip;</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s great tension between those.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried hard, right?</p>
<p>And done something new, right?</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re not gonna be facing the challenges</p>
<p>when you build it.</p>
<p>Then you find out all the problems with it.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>But when you look back, do you see problems?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, when I look back?</p>
<p>What do you remember?</p>
<p>I think earlier in my career,</p>
<p>like EV5 was the second alpha chip.</p>
<p>I was so embarrassed about the mistakes,</p>
<p>I could barely talk about it.</p>
<p>And it was in the Guinness Book of World Records</p>
<p>and it was the fastest processor on the planet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it was, and at some point I realized</p>
<p>that was really a bad mental framework</p>
<p>to deal with doing something new.</p>
<p>We did a bunch of new things</p>
<p>and some worked out great and some were bad.</p>
<p>And we learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>And then the next one, we learned a lot.</p>
<p>That EV6 also had some really cool things in it.</p>
<p>I think the proportion of good stuff went up,</p>
<p>but it had a couple of fatal flaws in it that were painful.</p>
<p>And then, yeah.</p>
<p>You learned to channel the pain into like pride.</p>
<p>Not pride, really.</p>
<p>You know, just a realization about how the world works</p>
<p>or how that kind of idea set works.</p>
<p>Life is suffering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Well, I know the Buddha said that</p>
<p>and a couple other people are stuck on it.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s this kind of weird combination</p>
<p>of good and bad, you know, light and darkness</p>
<p>that you have to tolerate and, you know, deal with.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s definitely lots of suffering in the world.</p>
<p>Depends on the perspective.</p>
<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s way more darkness,</p>
<p>but that makes the light part really nice.</p>
<p>What computing hardware or just any kind,</p>
<p>even software design, do you find beautiful</p>
<p>from your own work, from other people&rsquo;s work?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just, we were just talking about the battleground</p>
<p>of flaws and mistakes and errors,</p>
<p>but things that were just beautifully done.</p>
<p>Is there something that pops to mind?</p>
<p>Well, when things are beautifully done,</p>
<p>usually there&rsquo;s a well thought out set of abstraction layers.</p>
<p>So the whole thing works in unison nicely.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And when I say abstraction layer,</p>
<p>that means two different components</p>
<p>when they work together, they work independently.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to know what the other one is doing.</p>
<p>So that decoupling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the famous one was the network stack.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a seven layer network stack,</p>
<p>you know, data transport and protocol and all the layers.</p>
<p>And the innovation was,</p>
<p>is when they really wrote, got that right.</p>
<p>Cause networks before that didn&rsquo;t define those very well.</p>
<p>The layers could innovate independently.</p>
<p>And occasionally the layer boundary would,</p>
<p>the interface would be upgraded.</p>
<p>And that let the design space breathe.</p>
<p>And you could do something new in layer seven</p>
<p>without having to worry about how layer four worked.</p>
<p>And so good design does that.</p>
<p>And you see it in processor designs.</p>
<p>When we did the Zen design at AMD,</p>
<p>we made several components very modular.</p>
<p>And, you know, my insistence at the top was</p>
<p>I wanted all the interfaces defined</p>
<p>before we wrote the RTL for the pieces.</p>
<p>One of the verification leads said,</p>
<p>if we do this right,</p>
<p>I can test the pieces so well independently</p>
<p>when we put it together,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t find all these interaction bugs</p>
<p>cause the floating point knows how the cache works.</p>
<p>And I was a little skeptical,</p>
<p>but he was mostly right.</p>
<p>That the modularity of the design</p>
<p>greatly improved the quality.</p>
<p>Is that universally true in general?</p>
<p>Would you say about good designs,</p>
<p>the modularity is like usually modular?</p>
<p>Well, we talked about this before.</p>
<p>Humans are only so smart.</p>
<p>Like, and we&rsquo;re not getting any smarter, right?</p>
<p>But the complexity of things is going up.</p>
<p>So, you know, a beautiful design can&rsquo;t be bigger</p>
<p>than the person doing it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know, their piece of it.</p>
<p>Like the odds of you doing a really beautiful design</p>
<p>of something that&rsquo;s way too hard for you is low, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s way too simple for you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, anybody could do that.</p>
<p>But when you get the right match of your expertise</p>
<p>and, you know, mental power to the right design size,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool, but that&rsquo;s not big enough</p>
<p>to make a meaningful impact in the world.</p>
<p>So now you have to have some framework</p>
<p>to design the pieces so that the whole thing</p>
<p>is big and harmonious.</p>
<p>But, you know, when you put it together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, sufficiently interesting to be used.</p>
<p>And, you know, so that&rsquo;s what a beautiful design is.</p>
<p>Matching the limits of that human cognitive capacity</p>
<p>to the module that you can create</p>
<p>and creating a nice interface between those modules</p>
<p>and thereby, do you think there&rsquo;s a limit</p>
<p>to the kind of beautiful complex systems</p>
<p>we can build with this kind of modular design?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, if we build increasingly</p>
<p>more complicated, you can think of like the internet.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s scale it down.</p>
<p>Or you can think of like social network,</p>
<p>like Twitter as one computing system.</p>
<p>But those are little modules, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s built on so many components</p>
<p>nobody at Twitter even understands.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if an alien showed up and looked at Twitter,</p>
<p>he wouldn&rsquo;t just see Twitter as a beautiful,</p>
<p>simple thing that everybody uses, which is really big.</p>
<p>You would see the network, it runs on the fiber optics,</p>
<p>the data is transported to the computers.</p>
<p>The whole thing is so bloody complicated,</p>
<p>nobody at Twitter understands it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what the alien would see.</p>
<p>So yeah, if an alien showed up and looked at Twitter</p>
<p>or looked at the various different network systems</p>
<p>that you could see on Earth.</p>
<p>So imagine they were really smart</p>
<p>and they could comprehend the whole thing.</p>
<p>And then they sort of evaluated the human</p>
<p>and thought, this is really interesting.</p>
<p>No human on this planet comprehends the system they built.</p>
<p>No individual, well, would they even see individual humans?</p>
<p>Like we humans are very human centric, entity centric.</p>
<p>And so we think of us as the central organism</p>
<p>and the networks as just the connection of organisms.</p>
<p>But from a perspective of an alien,</p>
<p>from an outside perspective, it seems like.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the ants and they&rsquo;d see the ant colony.</p>
<p>The ant colony, yeah.</p>
<p>Or the result of production of the ant colony,</p>
<p>which is like cities and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>in that sense, humans are pretty impressive.</p>
<p>The modularity that we&rsquo;re able to,</p>
<p>and how robust we are to noise and mutation</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s stress tested all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, you build all these cities with buildings</p>
<p>and you get earthquakes occasionally</p>
<p>and, you know, wars, earthquakes.</p>
<p>Viruses every once in a while.</p>
<p>You know, changes in business plans</p>
<p>or, you know, like shipping or something.</p>
<p>Like as long as it&rsquo;s all stress tested,</p>
<p>then it keeps adapting to the situation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a curious phenomenon.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s talk about Moore&rsquo;s Law a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the broad view of Moore&rsquo;s Law</p>
<p>was just exponential improvement of computing capability.</p>
<p>Like OpenAI, for example, recently published</p>
<p>this kind of papers looking at the exponential improvement</p>
<p>in the training efficiency of neural networks</p>
<p>for like ImageNet and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>We just got better on this purely software side,</p>
<p>just figuring out better tricks and algorithms</p>
<p>for training neural networks.</p>
<p>And that seems to be improving significantly faster</p>
<p>than the Moore&rsquo;s Law prediction, you know.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in the software space.</p>
<p>What do you think if Moore&rsquo;s Law continues</p>
<p>or if the general version of Moore&rsquo;s Law continues,</p>
<p>do you think that comes mostly from the hardware,</p>
<p>from the software, some mix of the two,</p>
<p>some interesting, totally,</p>
<p>so not the reduction of the size of the transistor</p>
<p>kind of thing, but more in the,</p>
<p>in the totally interesting kinds of innovations</p>
<p>in the hardware space, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s like a half a dozen things</p>
<p>going on in that graph.</p>
<p>So one is there&rsquo;s initial innovations</p>
<p>that had a lot of headroom to be exploited.</p>
<p>So, you know, the efficiency of the networks</p>
<p>has improved dramatically.</p>
<p>And then the decomposability of those and the use going,</p>
<p>you know, they started running on one computer,</p>
<p>then multiple computers, then multiple GPUs,</p>
<p>and then arrays of GPUs, and they&rsquo;re up to thousands.</p>
<p>And at some point, so it&rsquo;s sort of like</p>
<p>they were consumed, they were going from</p>
<p>like a single computer application</p>
<p>to a thousand computer application.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not really a Moore&rsquo;s Law thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an independent vector.</p>
<p>How many computers can I put on this problem?</p>
<p>Because the computers themselves are getting better</p>
<p>on like a Moore&rsquo;s Law rate,</p>
<p>but their ability to go from one to 10</p>
<p>to 100 to a thousand, you know, was something.</p>
<p>And then multiplied by, you know, the amount of computes</p>
<p>it took to resolve like AlexNet to ResNet to transformers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been quite, you know, steady improvements.</p>
<p>But those are like S curves, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the exactly kind of S curves</p>
<p>that are underlying Moore&rsquo;s Law from the very beginning.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the biggest, what&rsquo;s the most productive,</p>
<p>rich source of S curves in the future, do you think?</p>
<p>Is it hardware, is it software, or is it?</p>
<p>So hardware is going to move along relatively slowly.</p>
<p>Like, you know, double performance every two years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still&hellip;</p>
<p>I like how you call that slowly.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the slow version.</p>
<p>The snail&rsquo;s pace of Moore&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>Maybe we should trademark that one.</p>
<p>Whereas the scaling by number of computers, you know,</p>
<p>can go much faster, you know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure at some point Google had a, you know,</p>
<p>their initial search engine was running on a laptop,</p>
<p>you know, like.</p>
<p>And at some point they really worked on scaling that.</p>
<p>And then they factored the indexer from, you know,</p>
<p>this piece and this piece and this piece,</p>
<p>and they spread the data on more and more things.</p>
<p>And, you know, they did a dozen innovations.</p>
<p>But as they scaled up the number of computers on that,</p>
<p>it kept breaking, finding new bottlenecks</p>
<p>in their software and their schedulers,</p>
<p>and made them rethink.</p>
<p>Like, it seems insane to do a scheduler</p>
<p>across 1,000 computers to schedule parts of it</p>
<p>and then send the results to one computer.</p>
<p>But if you want to schedule a million searches,</p>
<p>that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the scaling by just quantity</p>
<p>is probably the richest thing.</p>
<p>But then as you scale quantity,</p>
<p>like a network that was great on 100 computers</p>
<p>may be completely the wrong one.</p>
<p>You may pick a network that&rsquo;s 10 times slower</p>
<p>on 10,000 computers, like per computer.</p>
<p>But if you go from 100 to 10,000, it&rsquo;s 100 times.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the things that happened</p>
<p>when we did internet scaling.</p>
<p>This efficiency went down, not up.</p>
<p>The future of computing is inefficiency, not efficiency.</p>
<p>But scale, inefficient scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s scaling faster than inefficiency bites you.</p>
<p>And as long as there&rsquo;s, you know, dollar value there,</p>
<p>like scaling costs lots of money.</p>
<p>But Google showed, Facebook showed, everybody showed</p>
<p>that the scale was where the money was at.</p>
<p>It was, and so it was worth the financial.</p>
<p>Do you think, is it possible that like basically</p>
<p>the entirety of Earth will be like a computing surface?</p>
<p>Like this table will be doing computing.</p>
<p>This hedgehog will be doing computing.</p>
<p>Like everything really inefficient,</p>
<p>dumb computing will be leveraged.</p>
<p>The science fiction books, they call it computronium.</p>
<p>Computronium?</p>
<p>We turn everything into computing.</p>
<p>Well, most of the elements aren&rsquo;t very good for anything.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re not gonna make a computer out of iron.</p>
<p>Like, you know, silicon and carbon have like nice structures.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ll see what you can do with the rest of it.</p>
<p>Like people talk about, well, maybe we can turn the sun</p>
<p>into computer, but it&rsquo;s hydrogen and a little bit of helium.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What I mean is more like actually just adding computers</p>
<p>to everything.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just converting all the mass of the universe</p>
<p>into computer.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>So not using.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be ironic from the simulation point of view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the simulator build mass, the simulates.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, ultimately this is all heading</p>
<p>towards a simulation.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think I might&rsquo;ve told you this story.</p>
<p>At Tesla, they were deciding,</p>
<p>so they wanna measure the current coming out of the battery</p>
<p>and they decided between putting the resistor in there</p>
<p>and putting a computer with a sensor in there.</p>
<p>And the computer was faster than the computer</p>
<p>I worked on in 1982.</p>
<p>And we chose the computer</p>
<p>because it was cheaper than the resistor.</p>
<p>So, sure, this hedgehog costs $13</p>
<p>and we can put an AI that&rsquo;s as smart as you</p>
<p>in there for five bucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll have one.</p>
<p>So computers will be everywhere.</p>
<p>I was hoping it wouldn&rsquo;t be smarter than me because.</p>
<p>Well, everything&rsquo;s gonna be smarter than you.</p>
<p>But you were saying it&rsquo;s inefficient.</p>
<p>I thought it was better to have a lot of dumb things.</p>
<p>Well, Moore&rsquo;s law will slowly compact that stuff.</p>
<p>So even the dumb things will be smarter than us.</p>
<p>The dumb things are gonna be smart</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re gonna be smart enough to talk to something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really smart.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Well, just remember, like a big computer chip.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like an inch by an inch</p>
<p>and, you know, 40 microns thick.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take very much, very many atoms</p>
<p>to make a high power computer.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And 10,000 of them can fit in a shoebox.</p>
<p>But, you know, you have the cooling and power problems,</p>
<p>but, you know, people are working on that.</p>
<p>But they still can&rsquo;t write compelling poetry or music</p>
<p>or understand what love is or have a fear of mortality.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re still winning.</p>
<p>Neither can most of humanity, so.</p>
<p>Well, they can write books about it.</p>
<p>So, but speaking about this,</p>
<p>this walk along the path of innovation</p>
<p>towards the dumb things being smarter than humans,</p>
<p>you are now the CTO of 10storrent as of two months ago.</p>
<p>They build hardware for deep learning.</p>
<p>How do you build scalable and efficient deep learning?</p>
<p>This is such a fascinating space.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So up until recently,</p>
<p>I thought there was two kinds of computers.</p>
<p>There are serial computers that run like C programs,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s parallel computers.</p>
<p>So the way I think about it is, you know,</p>
<p>parallel computers have given parallelism.</p>
<p>Like, GPUs are great because you have a million pixels,</p>
<p>and modern GPUs run a program on every pixel.</p>
<p>They call it the shader program, right?</p>
<p>So, or like finite element analysis.</p>
<p>You build something, you know,</p>
<p>you make this into little tiny chunks,</p>
<p>you give each chunk to a computer,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re given all these chunks,</p>
<p>you have parallelism like that.</p>
<p>But most C programs, you write this linear narrative,</p>
<p>and you have to make it go fast.</p>
<p>To make it go fast, you predict all the branches,</p>
<p>all the data fetches, and you run that.</p>
<p>More parallel, but that&rsquo;s found parallelism.</p>
<p>AI is, I&rsquo;m still trying to decide how fundamental this is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a given parallelism problem.</p>
<p>But the way people describe the neural networks,</p>
<p>and then how they write them in PyTorch, it makes graphs.</p>
<p>Yeah, that might be fundamentally different</p>
<p>than the GPU kind of.</p>
<p>Parallelism, yeah, it might be.</p>
<p>Because when you run the GPU program on all the pixels,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re running, you know, it depends,</p>
<p>this group of pixels say it&rsquo;s background blue,</p>
<p>and it runs a really simple program.</p>
<p>This pixel is, you know, some patch of your face,</p>
<p>so you have some really interesting shader program</p>
<p>to give you the impression of translucency.</p>
<p>But the pixels themselves don&rsquo;t talk to each other.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no graph, right?</p>
<p>So you do the image, and then you do the next image,</p>
<p>and you do the next image,</p>
<p>and you run eight million pixels,</p>
<p>eight million programs every time,</p>
<p>and modern GPUs have like 6,000 thread engines in them.</p>
<p>So, you know, to get eight million pixels,</p>
<p>each one runs a program on, you know, 10 or 20 pixels.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how they work, but there&rsquo;s no graph.</p>
<p>But you think graph might be a totally new way</p>
<p>to think about hardware.</p>
<p>So Rajagat Dori and I have been having this conversation</p>
<p>about given versus found parallelism.</p>
<p>And then the kind of walk,</p>
<p>because we got more transistors,</p>
<p>like, you know, computers way back when</p>
<p>did stuff on scalar data.</p>
<p>Now we did it on vector data, famous vector machines.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re making computers that operate on matrices, right?</p>
<p>And then the category we said that was next was spatial.</p>
<p>Like, imagine you have so much data</p>
<p>that, you know, you want to do the compute on this data,</p>
<p>and then when it&rsquo;s done, it says,</p>
<p>send the result to this pile of data on some software on that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s better to think about it spatially</p>
<p>than to move all the data to a central processor</p>
<p>and do all the work.</p>
<p>So spatially, you mean moving in the space of data</p>
<p>as opposed to moving the data.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have a petabyte data space</p>
<p>spread across some huge array of computers.</p>
<p>And when you do a computation somewhere,</p>
<p>you send the result of that computation</p>
<p>or maybe a pointer to the next program</p>
<p>to some other piece of data and do it.</p>
<p>But I think a better word might be graph.</p>
<p>And all the AI neural networks are graphs.</p>
<p>Do some computations, send the result here,</p>
<p>do another computation, do a data transformation,</p>
<p>do a merging, do a pooling, do another computation.</p>
<p>Is it possible to compress and say</p>
<p>how we make this thing efficient,</p>
<p>this whole process efficient, this different?</p>
<p>So first, the fundamental elements in the graphs</p>
<p>are things like matrix multiplies, convolutions,</p>
<p>data manipulations, and data movements.</p>
<p>So GPUs emulate those things with their little singles,</p>
<p>you know, basically running a single threaded program.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, you know, and NVIDIA calls it a warp</p>
<p>where they group a bunch of programs</p>
<p>that are similar together.</p>
<p>So for efficiency and instruction use.</p>
<p>And then at a higher level, you kind of,</p>
<p>you take this graph and you say this part of the graph</p>
<p>is a matrix multiplier, which runs on these 32 threads.</p>
<p>But the model at the bottom was built</p>
<p>for running programs on pixels, not executing graphs.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s emulation, ultimately.</p>
<p>So is it possible to build something</p>
<p>that natively runs graphs?</p>
<p>Yes, so that&rsquo;s what 10storrent did.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Where are we on that?</p>
<p>How, like, in the history of that effort,</p>
<p>are we in the early days?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>10storrent started by a friend of mine,</p>
<p>Labisha Bajek, and I was his first investor.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been, you know, kind of following him</p>
<p>and talking to him about it for years.</p>
<p>And in the fall when I was considering things to do,</p>
<p>I decided, you know, we held a conference last year</p>
<p>with a friend, organized it,</p>
<p>and we wanted to bring in thinkers.</p>
<p>And two of the people were Andre Carpassi and Chris Ladner.</p>
<p>And Andre gave this talk, it&rsquo;s on YouTube,</p>
<p>called Software 2.0, which I think is great.</p>
<p>Which is, we went from programmed computers,</p>
<p>where you write programs, to data program computers.</p>
<p>You know, like the future of software is data programs,</p>
<p>the networks.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And then Chris has been working,</p>
<p>he worked on LLVM, the low level virtual machine,</p>
<p>which became the intermediate representation</p>
<p>for all compilers.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s working on another project called MLIR,</p>
<p>which is mid level intermediate representation,</p>
<p>which is essentially under the graph</p>
<p>about how do you represent that kind of computation</p>
<p>and then coordinate large numbers</p>
<p>of potentially heterogeneous computers.</p>
<p>And I would say technically, Tens Torrents,</p>
<p>you know, two pillars of those two ideas,</p>
<p>software 2.0 and mid level representation.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in service of executing graph programs.</p>
<p>The hardware is designed to do that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s including the hardware piece.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then the other cool thing is,</p>
<p>for a relatively small amount of money,</p>
<p>they did a test chip and two production chips.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a super effective team.</p>
<p>And unlike some AI startups,</p>
<p>where if you don&rsquo;t build the hardware</p>
<p>to run the software that they really want to do,</p>
<p>then you have to fix it by writing lots more software.</p>
<p>So the hardware naturally does matrix multiply,</p>
<p>convolution, the data manipulations,</p>
<p>and the data movement between processing elements</p>
<p>that you can see in the graph,</p>
<p>which I think is all pretty clever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working on now.</p>
<p>So the, I think it&rsquo;s called the Grace Call Processor.</p>
<p>I introduced last year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s a bunch of measures of performance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about horses.</p>
<p>It seems to outperform 368 trillion operations per second.</p>
<p>It seems to outperform NVIDIA&rsquo;s Tesla T4 system.</p>
<p>So these are just numbers.</p>
<p>What do they actually mean in real world performance?</p>
<p>Like what are the metrics for you</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re chasing in your horse race?</p>
<p>Like what do you care about?</p>
<p>Well, first, so the native language of,</p>
<p>you know, people who write AI network programs</p>
<p>is PyTorch now, PyTorch, TensorFlow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple others.</p>
<p>Do you think PyTorch is one over TensorFlow?</p>
<p>Or is it just?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on that.</p>
<p>I know many people who have switched</p>
<p>from TensorFlow to PyTorch.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s technical reasons for it.</p>
<p>I use both.</p>
<p>Both are still awesome.</p>
<p>But the deepest love is for PyTorch currently.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s more love for that.</p>
<p>And that may change.</p>
<p>So the first thing is when they write their programs,</p>
<p>can the hardware execute it pretty much as it was written?</p>
<p>Right, so PyTorch turns into a graph.</p>
<p>We have a graph compiler that makes that graph.</p>
<p>Then it fractions the graph down.</p>
<p>So if you have big matrix multiply,</p>
<p>we turn it into right size chunks</p>
<p>to run on the processing elements.</p>
<p>It hooks all the graph up.</p>
<p>It lays out all the data.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of mid level representations of it</p>
<p>that are also simulatable.</p>
<p>So that if you&rsquo;re writing the code,</p>
<p>you can see how it&rsquo;s gonna go through the machine,</p>
<p>which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>And then at the bottom, it schedules kernels,</p>
<p>like math, data manipulation, data movement kernels,</p>
<p>which do this stuff.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t have to write a little program</p>
<p>to do matrix multiply,</p>
<p>because we have a big matrix multiplier.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no SIMD program for that.</p>
<p>But there is scheduling for that, right?</p>
<p>So one of the goals is,</p>
<p>if you write a piece of PyTorch code</p>
<p>that looks pretty reasonable,</p>
<p>you should be able to compile it, run it on the hardware</p>
<p>without having to tweak it</p>
<p>and do all kinds of crazy things to get performance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a lot of intermediate steps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s running directly as written.</p>
<p>Like on a GPU, if you write a large matrix multiply naively,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get five to 10% of the peak performance of the GPU.</p>
<p>Right, and then there&rsquo;s a bunch of people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve published papers on this,</p>
<p>and I read them about what steps do you have to do.</p>
<p>And it goes from pretty reasonable,</p>
<p>well, transpose one of the matrices.</p>
<p>So you do row ordered, not column ordered,</p>
<p>block it so that you can put a block of the matrix</p>
<p>on different SMs, groups of threads.</p>
<p>But some of it gets into little details,</p>
<p>like you have to schedule it just so,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have register conflicts.</p>
<p>So they call them CUDA ninjas.</p>
<p>CUDA ninjas, I love it.</p>
<p>To get to the optimal point,</p>
<p>you either use a prewritten library,</p>
<p>which is a good strategy for some things,</p>
<p>or you have to be an expert</p>
<p>in micro architecture to program it.</p>
<p>Right, so the optimization step</p>
<p>is way more complicated with the GPU.</p>
<p>So our goal is if you write PyTorch,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good PyTorch, you can do it.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s, as the networks are evolving,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve changed from convolutional to matrix multiply.</p>
<p>People are talking about conditional graphs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about very large matrices,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about sparsity,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re talking about problems</p>
<p>that scale across many, many chips.</p>
<p>So the native data item is a packet.</p>
<p>So you send a packet to a processor, it gets processed,</p>
<p>it does a bunch of work,</p>
<p>and then it may send packets to other processors,</p>
<p>and they execute in like a data flow graph</p>
<p>kind of methodology.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>We have a big network on chip,</p>
<p>and then the second chip has 16 ethernet ports</p>
<p>to hook lots of them together,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same graph compiler across multiple chips.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the scale comes in.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s built to scale naturally.</p>
<p>Now, my experience with scaling is as you scale,</p>
<p>you run into lots of interesting problems.</p>
<p>So scaling is the mountain to climb.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the hardware is built to do this,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re in the process of.</p>
<p>Is there a software part to this</p>
<p>with ethernet and all that?</p>
<p>Well, the protocol at the bottom,</p>
<p>we sent, it&rsquo;s an ethernet PHY,</p>
<p>but the protocol basically says,</p>
<p>send the packet from here to there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all point to point.</p>
<p>The header bit says which processor to send it to,</p>
<p>and we basically take a packet off our on chip network,</p>
<p>put an ethernet header on it,</p>
<p>send it to the other end to strip the header off,</p>
<p>and send it to the local thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Human to human interaction is pretty straightforward too,</p>
<p>but when you get a million of us,</p>
<p>we could do some crazy stuff together.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna be fun.</p>
<p>So is that the goal is scale?</p>
<p>So like, for example, I&rsquo;ve been recently</p>
<p>doing a bunch of robots at home</p>
<p>for my own personal pleasure.</p>
<p>Am I going to ever use 10th Story, or is this more for?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s small inference problems,</p>
<p>or small training problems, or big training problems.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the big goal?</p>
<p>Is it the big training problems,</p>
<p>or the small training problems?</p>
<p>Well, one of the goals is to scale</p>
<p>from 100 milliwatts to a megawatt, you know?</p>
<p>So like, really have some range on the problems,</p>
<p>and the same kind of AI programs</p>
<p>work at all different levels.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>The natural, since the natural data item</p>
<p>is a packet that we can move around,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s built to scale, but so many people have small problems.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>But the, you know.</p>
<p>Like, inside that phone is a small problem to solve.</p>
<p>So do you see 10th Story potentially being inside a phone?</p>
<p>Well, the power efficiency of local memory,</p>
<p>local computation, and the way we built it is pretty good.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a lot of efficiency</p>
<p>on being able to do conditional graphs and sparsity.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, for complicated networks</p>
<p>that wanna go in a small factor, it&rsquo;s gonna be quite good.</p>
<p>But we have to prove that, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun problem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the early days of the company, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a couple years, you said?</p>
<p>But you think, you invested, you think they&rsquo;re legit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so you joined.</p>
<p>Yeah, I joined.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting place to be.</p>
<p>Like, the AI world is exploding, you know.</p>
<p>And I looked at some other opportunities</p>
<p>like build a faster processor, which people want.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s more on an incremental path</p>
<p>than what&rsquo;s gonna happen in AI in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is kind of, you know,</p>
<p>an exciting place to be part of.</p>
<p>Yeah, the revolutions will be happening</p>
<p>in the very space that Tesla is.</p>
<p>And then lots of people are working on it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s lots of technical reasons why some of them,</p>
<p>you know, aren&rsquo;t gonna work out that well.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also the same problem</p>
<p>about getting the basics right.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;ve talked to customers about exciting features.</p>
<p>And at some point we realized that,</p>
<p>Labish and I were realizing they want to hear first</p>
<p>about memory bandwidth, local bandwidth,</p>
<p>compute intensity, programmability.</p>
<p>They want to know the basics, power management,</p>
<p>how the network ports work, what are the basics,</p>
<p>do all the basics work.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s easy to say, we&rsquo;ve got this great idea,</p>
<p>you know, the crack GPT3, but the people we talked to</p>
<p>want to say, if I buy the, so we have a PCI Express card</p>
<p>with our chip on it, if you buy the card,</p>
<p>you plug it in your machine to download the driver,</p>
<p>how long does it take me to get my network to run?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a real question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very basic question.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Is there an answer to that yet,</p>
<p>or is it trying to get to that?</p>
<p>Our goal is like an hour.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When can I buy a Tesla?</p>
<p>Pretty soon.</p>
<p>Or my, for the small case training.</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty soon.</p>
<p>Months.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>I love the idea of you inside the room</p>
<p>with the Carpathi, Andre Carpathi and Chris Ladner.</p>
<p>Very, very interesting, very brilliant people,</p>
<p>very out of the box thinkers,</p>
<p>but also like first principles thinkers.</p>
<p>Well, they both get stuff done.</p>
<p>They only get stuff done to get their own projects done.</p>
<p>They talk about it clearly.</p>
<p>They educate large numbers of people,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve created platforms for other people</p>
<p>to go do their stuff on.</p>
<p>Yeah, the clear thinking that&rsquo;s able to be communicated</p>
<p>is kind of impressive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of remarkable to, yeah, I&rsquo;m a fan.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask,</p>
<p>because I talk to Chris actually a lot these days.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been one of the, just to give him a shout out,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been so supportive as a human being.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s quite different.</p>
<p>Like great engineers are different,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s been like sensitive to the human element</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s been fascinating.</p>
<p>Like he was one of the early people</p>
<p>on this stupid podcast that I do to say like,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t quit this thing,</p>
<p>and also talk to whoever the hell you want to talk to.</p>
<p>That kind of from a legit engineer to get like props</p>
<p>and be like, you can do this.</p>
<p>That was, I mean, that&rsquo;s what a good leader does, right?</p>
<p>To just kind of let a little kid do his thing,</p>
<p>like go do it, let&rsquo;s see what turns out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty powerful thing.</p>
<p>But what do you, what&rsquo;s your sense about,</p>
<p>he used to be, no, I think stepped away from Google, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s at SciFive, I think.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really impressive to you</p>
<p>about the things that Chris has worked on?</p>
<p>Because we mentioned the optimization,</p>
<p>the compiler design stuff, the LLVM,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s also at Google worked at the TPU stuff.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s obviously worked on Swift,</p>
<p>so the programming language side.</p>
<p>Talking about people that work in the entirety of the stack.</p>
<p>What, from your time interacting with Chris</p>
<p>and knowing the guy, what&rsquo;s really impressive to you</p>
<p>that just inspires you?</p>
<p>Well, like LLVM became the defacto platform</p>
<p>for the defacto platform for compilers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And it was good code quality, good design choices.</p>
<p>He hit the right level of abstraction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of the right time, the right place.</p>
<p>And then he built a new programming language called Swift,</p>
<p>which after, let&rsquo;s say some adoption resistance</p>
<p>became very successful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that much about his work at Google,</p>
<p>although I know that that was a typical,</p>
<p>they started TensorFlow stuff and it was new.</p>
<p>They wrote a lot of code and then at some point</p>
<p>it needed to be refactored to be,</p>
<p>because its development slowed down,</p>
<p>why PyTorch started a little later and then passed it.</p>
<p>So he did a lot of work on that.</p>
<p>And then his idea about MLIR,</p>
<p>which is what people started to realize</p>
<p>is the complexity of the software stack above</p>
<p>the low level IR was getting so high</p>
<p>that forcing the features of that into the level</p>
<p>was putting too much of a burden on it.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s splitting that into multiple pieces.</p>
<p>And that was one of the inspirations for our software stack</p>
<p>where we have several intermediate representations</p>
<p>that are all executable and you can look at them</p>
<p>and do transformations on them before you lower the level.</p>
<p>So that was, I think we started before MLIR</p>
<p>really got far enough along to use,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re interested in that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really excited about MLIR.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his like little baby.</p>
<p>So he, and there seems to be some profound ideas on that</p>
<p>that are really useful.</p>
<p>So each one of those things has been,</p>
<p>as the world of software gets more and more complicated,</p>
<p>how do we create the right abstraction levels</p>
<p>to simplify it in a way that people can now work independently</p>
<p>on different levels of it?</p>
<p>So I would say all three of those projects,</p>
<p>LLVM, Swift, and MLIR did that successfully.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m interested in what he&rsquo;s gonna do next</p>
<p>in the same kind of way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>On either the TPU or maybe the Nvidia GPU side,</p>
<p>how does 10th Story think, or the ideas underlying it,</p>
<p>does it have to be 10th Story?</p>
<p>Just this kind of graph focused,</p>
<p>graph centric hardware, deep learning centric hardware,</p>
<p>beat NVIDIAs, do you think it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>for it to basically overtake NVIDIA?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that process look like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that journey look like, you think?</p>
<p>Well, GPUs were built to run shader programs</p>
<p>on millions of pixels, not to run graphs.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a hypothesis that says</p>
<p>the way the graphs are built</p>
<p>is going to be really interesting</p>
<p>to be inefficient on computing this.</p>
<p>And then the primitives is not a SIMD program,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s matrix multiply convolution.</p>
<p>And then the data manipulations are fairly extensive about,</p>
<p>like, how do you do a fast transpose with a program?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever written a transpose program.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re ugly and slow, but in hardware,</p>
<p>you can do really well.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>So when GPU accelerators first started doing triangles,</p>
<p>like, so you have a triangle</p>
<p>which maps on a set of pixels.</p>
<p>So you build, it&rsquo;s very easy,</p>
<p>straightforward to build a hardware engine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll find all those pixels.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of weird</p>
<p>because you walk along the triangle to get to the edge,</p>
<p>and then you have to go back down to the next row</p>
<p>and walk along, and then you have to decide on the edge</p>
<p>if the line of the triangle is like half on the pixel,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the pixel color?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s half of this pixel and half the next one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called rasterization.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that could be done in hardware?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s an example of that operation</p>
<p>as a software program is really bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a program that did rasterization.</p>
<p>The hardware that does it has actually less code</p>
<p>than the software program that does it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s way faster.</p>
<p>Right, so there are certain times</p>
<p>when the abstraction you have, rasterize a triangle,</p>
<p>you know, execute a graph, you know, components of a graph.</p>
<p>But the right thing to do in the hardware software boundary</p>
<p>is for the hardware to naturally do it.</p>
<p>And so the GPU is really optimized</p>
<p>for the rasterization of triangles.</p>
<p>Well, you know, that&rsquo;s just, well, like in a modern,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s a small piece of modern GPUs.</p>
<p>What they did is that they still rasterize triangles</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re running in a game, but for the most part,</p>
<p>most of the computation in the area of the GPU</p>
<p>is running shader programs.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re single threaded programs on pixels, not graphs.</p>
<p>I have to be honest, I&rsquo;d say I don&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>the math behind shader, shading and lighting</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what.</p>
<p>They look like little simple floating point programs</p>
<p>or complicated ones.</p>
<p>You can have 8,000 instructions in a shader program.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have a good intuition</p>
<p>why it could be parallelized so easily.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s because you have 8 million pixels in every single.</p>
<p>So when you have a light, right, that comes down,</p>
<p>the angle, you know, the amount of light,</p>
<p>like say this is a line of pixels across this table, right?</p>
<p>The amount of light on each pixel is subtly different.</p>
<p>And each pixel is responsible for figuring out what.</p>
<p>Figuring it out.</p>
<p>So that pixel says, I&rsquo;m this pixel.</p>
<p>I know the angle of the light.</p>
<p>I know the occlusion.</p>
<p>I know the color I am.</p>
<p>Like every single pixel here is a different color.</p>
<p>Every single pixel gets a different amount of light.</p>
<p>Every single pixel has a subtly different translucency.</p>
<p>So to make it look realistic,</p>
<p>the solution was you run a separate program on every pixel.</p>
<p>See, but I thought there&rsquo;s like reflection</p>
<p>from all over the place.</p>
<p>Every pixel. Yeah, but there is.</p>
<p>So you build a reflection map,</p>
<p>which also has some pixelated thing.</p>
<p>And then when the pixel is looking at the reflection map,</p>
<p>it has to calculate what the normal of the surface is.</p>
<p>And it does it per pixel.</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s boatloads of hacks on that.</p>
<p>You know, like you may have a lower resolution light map,</p>
<p>your reflection map.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all these, you know, tax they do.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s per pixel computation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so happening that you can map</p>
<p>graph like computation onto this pixel central computation.</p>
<p>You can do floating point programs</p>
<p>on convolutions and the matrices.</p>
<p>And Nvidia invested for years in CUDA.</p>
<p>First for HPC, and then they got lucky with the AI trend.</p>
<p>But do you think they&rsquo;re going to essentially</p>
<p>not be able to hardcore pivot out of their?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always interesting.</p>
<p>How often do big companies hardcore pivot?</p>
<p>Occasionally.</p>
<p>How much do you know about Nvidia, folks?</p>
<p>Some. Some?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m curious as well.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s ultimately, as a&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve innovated several times.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ve also worked really hard on mobile.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve worked really hard on radios.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re fundamentally a GPU company.</p>
<p>Well, they tried to pivot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting little game and play</p>
<p>in autonomous vehicles, right?</p>
<p>With, or semi autonomous, like playing with Tesla</p>
<p>and so on and seeing that&rsquo;s dipping a toe</p>
<p>into that kind of pivot.</p>
<p>They came out with this platform,</p>
<p>which is interesting technically.</p>
<p>But it was like a 3000 watt, you know,</p>
<p>3000 watt, $3,000 GPU platform.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s interesting technically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting philosophically.</p>
<p>Technically, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the execution</p>
<p>of the craftsmanship is there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t get a sense.</p>
<p>I think they were repurposing GPUs</p>
<p>for an automotive solution.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s not a real pivot.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t build a ground up solution.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like the chips inside Tesla are pretty cheap.</p>
<p>Like Mobileye has been doing this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing the classic work from the simplest thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, 40 square millimeter chips.</p>
<p>And Nvidia, their solution had 800 millimeter chips</p>
<p>and two 200 millimeter chips.</p>
<p>And, you know, like boatloads are really expensive DRAMs.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s a really different approach.</p>
<p>And Mobileye fit the, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>automotive cost and form factor.</p>
<p>And then they added features as it was economically viable.</p>
<p>And Nvidia said, take the biggest thing</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna go make it work.</p>
<p>You know, and that&rsquo;s also influenced like Waymo.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of autonomous startups</p>
<p>where they have a 5,000 watt server in their trunk.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s because they think, well, 5,000 watts</p>
<p>and, you know, $10,000 is okay</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s replacing a driver.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s approach was that port has to be cheap enough</p>
<p>to put it in every single Tesla,</p>
<p>whether they turn on autonomous driving or not.</p>
<p>Which, and Mobileye was like,</p>
<p>we need to fit in the bomb and, you know,</p>
<p>cost structure that car companies do.</p>
<p>So they may sell you a GPS for 1500 bucks,</p>
<p>but the bomb for that, it&rsquo;s like $25.</p>
<p>Well, and for Mobileye, it seems like neural networks</p>
<p>were not first class citizens, like the computation.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t start out as a&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a CV problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And did classic CV and found stoplights and lines.</p>
<p>And they were really good at it.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they never, I mean,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening now,</p>
<p>but they never fully pivoted.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the Nvidia thing.</p>
<p>And then as opposed to,</p>
<p>so if you look at the new Tesla work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like neural networks from the ground up, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and even Tesla started with a lot of CV stuff in it</p>
<p>and Andrei&rsquo;s basically been eliminating it.</p>
<p>Move everything into the network.</p>
<p>So without, this isn&rsquo;t like confidential stuff,</p>
<p>but you sitting on a porch, looking over the world,</p>
<p>looking at the work that Andrei&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>that Elon&rsquo;s doing with Tesla Autopilot,</p>
<p>do you like the trajectory of where things are going</p>
<p>on the hardware side?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re making serious progress.</p>
<p>I like the videos of people driving the beta stuff.</p>
<p>I guess taking some pretty complicated intersections</p>
<p>and all that, but it&rsquo;s still an intervention per drive.</p>
<p>I mean, I have autopilot, the current autopilot,</p>
<p>my Tesla, I use it every day.</p>
<p>Do you have full self driving beta or no?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So you like where this is going?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking longer than anybody thought.</p>
<p>You know, my wonder is, you know, hardware three,</p>
<p>is it enough computing off by two, off by five,</p>
<p>off by 10, off by a hundred?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I thought it probably wasn&rsquo;t enough,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re doing pretty well with it now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And one thing is the data set gets bigger,</p>
<p>the training gets better.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this interesting thing is you sort of train</p>
<p>and build an arbitrary size network that solves the problem.</p>
<p>And then you refactor the network down to the thing</p>
<p>that you can afford to ship, right?</p>
<p>So the goal isn&rsquo;t to build a network that fits in the phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to build something that actually works.</p>
<p>And then how do you make that most effective</p>
<p>on the hardware you have?</p>
<p>And they seem to be doing that much better</p>
<p>than a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Well, the one really important thing is also</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing well is how to iterate that quickly,</p>
<p>which means like it&rsquo;s not just about one time deployment,</p>
<p>one building, it&rsquo;s constantly iterating the network</p>
<p>and trying to automate as many steps as possible, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually the principles of the Software 2.0,</p>
<p>like you mentioned with Andre is it&rsquo;s not just,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what the actual,</p>
<p>his description of Software 2.0 is.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just high level philosophical or their specifics,</p>
<p>but the interesting thing about what that actually looks</p>
<p>in the real world is it&rsquo;s that what I think Andre calls</p>
<p>the data engine, it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s the iterative improvement</p>
<p>of the thing.</p>
<p>You have a neural network that does stuff,</p>
<p>fails on a bunch of things and learns from it</p>
<p>over and over and over.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re constantly discovering edge cases.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very much about like data engineering,</p>
<p>like figuring out, it&rsquo;s kind of what you were talking about</p>
<p>with TestTorrent is you have the data landscape.</p>
<p>And you have to walk along that data landscape</p>
<p>in a way that is constantly improving the neural network.</p>
<p>And that feels like that&rsquo;s the central piece of it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s two pieces of it.</p>
<p>Like you find edge cases that don&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>and then you define something that goes,</p>
<p>get your data for that.</p>
<p>But then the other constraint is whether you have</p>
<p>to label it or not.</p>
<p>Like the amazing thing about like the GPT3 stuff</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s unsupervised.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s essentially infinite amount of data.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s obviously infinite amount of data available</p>
<p>from cars of people successfully driving.</p>
<p>But the current pipelines are mostly running</p>
<p>on labeled data, which is human limited.</p>
<p>So when that becomes unsupervised,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll create unlimited amount of data,</p>
<p>which then they&rsquo;ll scale.</p>
<p>Now the networks that may use that data</p>
<p>might be way too big for cars,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;ll be the transformation from now</p>
<p>we have unlimited data, I know exactly what I want.</p>
<p>Now can I turn that into something that fits in the car?</p>
<p>And that process is gonna happen all over the place.</p>
<p>Every time you get to the place where you have</p>
<p>unlimited data, and that&rsquo;s what software 2.0 is about,</p>
<p>unlimited data training networks to do stuff</p>
<p>without humans writing code to do it.</p>
<p>And ultimately also trying to discover,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re saying, the self supervised formulation</p>
<p>of the problem.</p>
<p>So the unsupervised formulation of the problem.</p>
<p>Like in driving, there&rsquo;s this really interesting thing,</p>
<p>which is you look at a scene that&rsquo;s before you,</p>
<p>and you have data about what a successful human driver did</p>
<p>in that scene one second later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little piece of data that you can use</p>
<p>just like with GPT3 as training.</p>
<p>Currently, even though Tesla says they&rsquo;re using that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an open question to me, how far can you,</p>
<p>can you solve all of the driving</p>
<p>with just that self supervised piece of data?</p>
<p>And like, I think.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what Common AI is doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Common AI is doing,</p>
<p>but the question is how much data.</p>
<p>So what Common AI doesn&rsquo;t have is as good</p>
<p>of a data engine, for example, as Tesla does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the, like the organization of the data.</p>
<p>I mean, as far as I know, I haven&rsquo;t talked to George,</p>
<p>but they do have the data.</p>
<p>The question is how much data is needed,</p>
<p>because we say infinite very loosely here.</p>
<p>And then the other question, which you said,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you think it&rsquo;s still an open question is,</p>
<p>are we on the right order of magnitude</p>
<p>for the compute necessary?</p>
<p>That is this, is it like what Elon said,</p>
<p>this chip that&rsquo;s in there now is enough</p>
<p>to do full self driving,</p>
<p>or do we need another order of magnitude?</p>
<p>I think nobody actually knows the answer to that question.</p>
<p>I like the confidence that Elon has, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another funny thing is you don&rsquo;t learn to drive</p>
<p>with infinite amounts of data.</p>
<p>You learn to drive with an intellectual framework</p>
<p>that understands physics and color and horizontal surfaces</p>
<p>and laws and roads and all your experience</p>
<p>from manipulating your environment.</p>
<p>Like, look, there&rsquo;s so many factors go into that.</p>
<p>So then when you learn to drive,</p>
<p>like driving is a subset of this conceptual framework</p>
<p>that you have, right?</p>
<p>And so with self driving cars right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re teaching them to drive with driving data.</p>
<p>You never teach a human to do that.</p>
<p>You teach a human all kinds of interesting things,</p>
<p>like language, like don&rsquo;t do that, watch out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of stuff going on.</p>
<p>Well, this is where you, I think previous time</p>
<p>we talked about where you poetically disagreed</p>
<p>with my naive notion about humans.</p>
<p>I just think that humans will make</p>
<p>this whole driving thing really difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>I said, humans don&rsquo;t move that slow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ballistics problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a ballistics, humans are a ballistics problem,</p>
<p>which is like poetry to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that in driving</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re indeed purely a ballistics problem.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably the right way to think about it.</p>
<p>But I still, they still continue to surprise me,</p>
<p>those damn pedestrians, the cyclists,</p>
<p>other humans in other cars and.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s gonna be one of these compensating things.</p>
<p>So like when you&rsquo;re driving,</p>
<p>you have an intuition about what humans are going to do,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have 360 cameras and radars</p>
<p>and you have an attention problem.</p>
<p>So the self driving car comes in with no attention problem,</p>
<p>360 cameras right now, a bunch of other features.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll wipe out a whole class of accidents, right?</p>
<p>And emergency braking with radar</p>
<p>and especially as it gets AI enhanced</p>
<p>will eliminate collisions, right?</p>
<p>But then you have the other problems</p>
<p>of these unexpected things where</p>
<p>you think your human intuition is helping,</p>
<p>but then the cars also have a set of hardware features</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not even close to.</p>
<p>And the key thing of course is if you wipe out</p>
<p>a huge number of kind of accidents,</p>
<p>then it might be just way safer than a human driver,</p>
<p>even though, even if humans are still a problem,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard to figure out.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s probably what will happen.</p>
<p>Those autonomous cars will have a small number of accidents</p>
<p>humans would have avoided, but they&rsquo;ll wipe,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll get rid of the bulk of them.</p>
<p>What do you think about like Tesla&rsquo;s dojo efforts</p>
<p>or it can be bigger than Tesla in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the tense torrent trying to innovate,</p>
<p>like this is the dichotomy, like should a company</p>
<p>try to from scratch build its own</p>
<p>neural network training hardware?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I think it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So we need lots of experiments, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots of startups working on this</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re pursuing different things.</p>
<p>I was there when we started dojo and it was sort of like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the unconstrained computer solution</p>
<p>to go do very large training problems?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s fun stuff like, we said,</p>
<p>well, we have this 10,000 watt board to cool.</p>
<p>Well, you go talk to guys at SpaceX</p>
<p>and they think 10,000 watts is a really small number,</p>
<p>not a big number.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s brilliant people working on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to see how it&rsquo;ll come out.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell you, I know it pivoted</p>
<p>a few times since I left, so.</p>
<p>So the cooling does seem to be a big problem.</p>
<p>I do like what Elon said about it, which is like,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t wanna do the thing unless it&rsquo;s way better</p>
<p>than the alternative, whatever the alternative is.</p>
<p>So it has to be way better than like racks or GPUs.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the other thing is just like,</p>
<p>you know, the Tesla autonomous driving hardware,</p>
<p>it was only serving one software stack.</p>
<p>And the hardware team and the software team</p>
<p>were tightly coupled.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re building a general purpose AI solution,</p>
<p>then you know, there&rsquo;s so many different customers</p>
<p>with so many different needs.</p>
<p>Now, something Andre said is, I think this is amazing.</p>
<p>10 years ago, like vision, recommendation, language,</p>
<p>were completely different disciplines.</p>
<p>He said, the people literally couldn&rsquo;t talk to each other.</p>
<p>And three years ago, it was all neural networks,</p>
<p>but the very different neural networks.</p>
<p>And recently, it&rsquo;s converging on one set of networks.</p>
<p>They vary a lot in size, obviously, they vary in data,</p>
<p>vary in outputs, but the technology has converged</p>
<p>a good bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, these transformers behind GPT3,</p>
<p>it seems like they could be applied to video,</p>
<p>they could be applied to a lot of, and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all really simple.</p>
<p>And it was like they literally replace letters with pixels.</p>
<p>It does vision, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And then size actually improves the thing.</p>
<p>So the bigger it gets, the more compute you throw at it,</p>
<p>the better it gets.</p>
<p>And the more data you have, the better it gets.</p>
<p>So then you start to wonder, well,</p>
<p>is that a fundamental thing?</p>
<p>Or is this just another step to some fundamental understanding</p>
<p>about this kind of computation?</p>
<p>Which is really interesting.</p>
<p>Us humans don&rsquo;t want to believe that that kind of thing</p>
<p>will achieve conceptual understandings, you were saying,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ll figure out physics, but maybe it will.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Maybe it will.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s worse than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll understand physics in ways that we can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I like your Stephen Wolfram talk where he said,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s three generations of physics.</p>
<p>There was physics by reasoning.</p>
<p>Well, big things should fall faster than small things,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s reasoning.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s physics by equations.</p>
<p>Like, you know, but the number of programs in the world</p>
<p>that are solved with a single equation is relatively low.</p>
<p>Almost all programs have, you know,</p>
<p>more than one line of code, maybe 100 million lines of code.</p>
<p>So he said, then now we&rsquo;re going to physics by equation,</p>
<p>which is his project, which is cool.</p>
<p>I might point out there was two generations of physics</p>
<p>before reasoning habit.</p>
<p>Like all animals, you know, know things fall</p>
<p>and, you know, birds fly and, you know, predators know</p>
<p>how to, you know, solve a differential equation</p>
<p>to cut off a accelerating, you know, curving animal path.</p>
<p>And then there was, you know, the gods did it, right?</p>
<p>So, right.</p>
<p>So there was, you know, there&rsquo;s five generations.</p>
<p>Now, software 2.0 says programming things</p>
<p>is not the last step.</p>
<p>Data.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be a physics past Stephen Wolfram&rsquo;s con.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not explainable to us humans.</p>
<p>And actually there&rsquo;s no reason that I can see</p>
<p>well that even that&rsquo;s the limit.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s something beyond that.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re usually, like, usually when you have</p>
<p>this hierarchy, it&rsquo;s not like, well, if you have this step</p>
<p>and this step and this step and they&rsquo;re all qualitatively</p>
<p>different and conceptually different, it&rsquo;s not obvious why,</p>
<p>you know, six is the right number of hierarchy steps</p>
<p>and not seven or eight or.</p>
<p>Well, then it&rsquo;s probably impossible for us to,</p>
<p>to comprehend something that&rsquo;s beyond the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not explainable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But the thing that, you know, understands the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not explainable to us will conceive the next one.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;m not sure why there&rsquo;s a limit to it.</p>
<p>Click your brain hurts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sad story.</p>
<p>If we look at our own brain, which is an interesting</p>
<p>illustrative example in your work with test story</p>
<p>and trying to design deep learning architectures,</p>
<p>do you think about the brain at all?</p>
<p>Maybe from a hardware designer perspective,</p>
<p>if you could change something about the brain,</p>
<p>what would you change or do?</p>
<p>Funny question.</p>
<p>Like, how would you do it?</p>
<p>So your brain is really weird.</p>
<p>Like, you know, your cerebral cortex where we think</p>
<p>we do most of our thinking is what,</p>
<p>like six or seven neurons thick?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>Like all the big networks are way bigger than that.</p>
<p>Like way deeper.</p>
<p>So that seems odd.</p>
<p>And then, you know, when you&rsquo;re thinking if it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if the input generates a result you can lose,</p>
<p>it goes really fast.</p>
<p>But if it can&rsquo;t, that generates an output</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting, which turns into an input</p>
<p>and then your brain to the point where you mold things</p>
<p>over for days and how many trips</p>
<p>through your brain is that, right?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, you know, 300 milliseconds or something</p>
<p>to get through seven levels of neurons.</p>
<p>I forget the number exactly.</p>
<p>But then it does it over and over and over as it searches.</p>
<p>And the brain clearly looks like some kind of graph</p>
<p>because you have a neuron with connections</p>
<p>and it talks to other ones</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s locally very computationally intense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also does sparse computations</p>
<p>across a pretty big area.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of messy biological type of things</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s meaning like, first of all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s mechanical, chemical and electrical signals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the asynchronicity of signals.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s just a lot of variability</p>
<p>that seems continuous and messy</p>
<p>and just the mess of biology.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unclear whether that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a bad thing, because if it&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>that we need to run the entirety of the evolution,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re gonna have to start with basic bacteria</p>
<p>to create something.</p>
<p>So imagine we could control,</p>
<p>you could build a brain with 10 layers.</p>
<p>Would that be better or worse?</p>
<p>Or more connections or less connections,</p>
<p>or we don&rsquo;t know to what level our brains are optimized.</p>
<p>But if I was changing things,</p>
<p>like you can only hold like seven numbers in your head.</p>
<p>Like why not a hundred or a million?</p>
<p>Never thought of that.</p>
<p>And why can&rsquo;t we have like a floating point processor</p>
<p>that can compute anything we want</p>
<p>and see it all properly?</p>
<p>Like that would be kind of fun.</p>
<p>And why can&rsquo;t we see in four or eight dimensions?</p>
<p>Because 3D is kind of a drag.</p>
<p>Like all the hard mass transforms</p>
<p>are up in multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>So you could imagine a brain architecture</p>
<p>that you could enhance with a whole bunch of features</p>
<p>that would be really useful for thinking about things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the limitations you&rsquo;re describing</p>
<p>are actually essential for like the constraints</p>
<p>are essential for creating like the depth of intelligence.</p>
<p>Like that, the ability to reason.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say</p>
<p>because like your brain is clearly a parallel processor.</p>
<p>10 billion neurons talking to each other</p>
<p>at a relatively low clock rate.</p>
<p>But it produces something</p>
<p>that looks like a serial thought process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a serial narrative in your head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But then there are people famously who are visual thinkers.</p>
<p>Like I think I&rsquo;m a relatively visual thinker.</p>
<p>I can imagine any object and rotate it in my head</p>
<p>and look at it.</p>
<p>And there are people who say</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t think that way at all.</p>
<p>And recently I read an article about people</p>
<p>who say they don&rsquo;t have a voice in their head.</p>
<p>They can talk.</p>
<p>But when they, you know, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, what are you thinking?</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;ll describe something that&rsquo;s visual.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s curious.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>if we dedicated more hardware to holding information,</p>
<p>like, you know, 10 numbers or a million numbers,</p>
<p>like would that distract us from our ability</p>
<p>to form this kind of singular identity?</p>
<p>Like it dissipates somehow.</p>
<p>But maybe, you know, future humans</p>
<p>will have many identities</p>
<p>that have some higher level organization</p>
<p>but can actually do lots more things in parallel.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no reason, if we&rsquo;re thinking modularly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason we can&rsquo;t have multiple consciousnesses</p>
<p>in one brain.</p>
<p>Yeah, and maybe there&rsquo;s some way to make it faster</p>
<p>so that the, you know, the area of the computation</p>
<p>could still have a unified feel to it</p>
<p>while still having way more ability</p>
<p>to do parallel stuff at the same time.</p>
<p>Could definitely be improved.</p>
<p>Could be improved?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, well, it&rsquo;s pretty good right now.</p>
<p>Actually, people don&rsquo;t give it enough credit.</p>
<p>The thing is pretty nice.</p>
<p>The, you know, the fact that the right ends</p>
<p>seem to be, give a nice, like,</p>
<p>spark of beauty to the whole experience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it can be improved easily.</p>
<p>It could be more beautiful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how, I, what?</p>
<p>What do you mean, what do you mean how?</p>
<p>All the ways you can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>No, but that&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to,</p>
<p>the fact that I can imagine ways</p>
<p>in which it could be more beautiful means.</p>
<p>So do you know, you know, Ian Banks, his stories?</p>
<p>So the super smart AIs there live,</p>
<p>mostly live in the world of what they call infinite fun</p>
<p>because they can create arbitrary worlds.</p>
<p>So they interact in, you know, the story has it.</p>
<p>They interact in the normal world and they&rsquo;re very smart</p>
<p>and they can do all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>And, you know, a given mind can, you know,</p>
<p>talk to a million humans at the same time</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re very slow and for reasons,</p>
<p>you know, artificial, the story,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re interested in people and doing stuff,</p>
<p>but they mostly live in this other land of thinking.</p>
<p>My inclination is to think that the ability</p>
<p>to create infinite fun will not be so fun.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>Well, there are so many things to do.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to make a star move planets around.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but because we can imagine that</p>
<p>is why life is fun, if we actually were able to do it,</p>
<p>it would be a slippery slope</p>
<p>where fun wouldn&rsquo;t even have a meaning</p>
<p>because we just consistently desensitize ourselves</p>
<p>by the infinite amounts of fun we&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>And the sadness, the dark stuff is what makes it fun.</p>
<p>I think that could be the Russian.</p>
<p>It could be the fun makes it fun</p>
<p>and the sadness makes it bittersweet.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Fun could be the thing that makes it fun.</p>
<p>So what do you think about the expansion,</p>
<p>not through the biology side,</p>
<p>but through the BCI, the brain computer interfaces?</p>
<p>Yeah, you got a chance to check out the Neuralink stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>Like humans like our thoughts to manifest as action.</p>
<p>You know, like as a kid, you know,</p>
<p>like shooting a rifle was super fun,</p>
<p>driving a mini bike, doing things.</p>
<p>And then computer games, I think,</p>
<p>for a lot of kids became the thing</p>
<p>where they can do what they want.</p>
<p>They can fly a plane, they can do this, they can do this.</p>
<p>But you have to have this physical interaction.</p>
<p>Now imagine, you could just imagine stuff and it happens.</p>
<p>Like really richly and interestingly.</p>
<p>Like we kind of do that when we dream.</p>
<p>Like dreams are funny because like if you have some control</p>
<p>or awareness in your dreams,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s very realistic looking,</p>
<p>or not realistic looking, it depends on the dream.</p>
<p>But you can also manipulate that.</p>
<p>And you know, what&rsquo;s possible there is odd.</p>
<p>And the fact that nobody understands it, it&rsquo;s hilarious, but.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to expand</p>
<p>that capability through computing?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Is there some interesting,</p>
<p>so from a hardware designer perspective,</p>
<p>is there, do you think it&rsquo;ll present totally new challenges</p>
<p>in the kind of hardware required that like,</p>
<p>so this hardware isn&rsquo;t standalone computing.</p>
<p>Well, this is not working with the brain.</p>
<p>So today, computer games are rendered by GPUs.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right, so, but you&rsquo;ve seen the GAN stuff, right?</p>
<p>Where trained neural networks render realistic images,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no pixels, no triangles, no shaders,</p>
<p>no light maps, no nothing.</p>
<p>So the future of graphics is probably AI, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>AI is heavily trained by lots of real data, right?</p>
<p>So if you have an interface with a AI renderer, right?</p>
<p>So if you say render a cat, it won&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>well, how tall&rsquo;s the cat and how big it,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;ll render a cat.</p>
<p>And you might say, oh, a little bigger, a little smaller,</p>
<p>you know, make it a tabby, shorter hair.</p>
<p>You know, like you could tweak it.</p>
<p>Like the amount of data you&rsquo;ll have to send</p>
<p>to interact with a very powerful AI renderer</p>
<p>could be low.</p>
<p>But the question is brain computer interfaces</p>
<p>would need to render not onto a screen,</p>
<p>but render onto the brain and like directly</p>
<p>so that there&rsquo;s a bandwidth.</p>
<p>Well, it could do it both ways.</p>
<p>I mean, our eyes are really good sensors.</p>
<p>They could render onto a screen</p>
<p>and we could feel like we&rsquo;re participating in it.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re gonna have, you know,</p>
<p>like the Oculus kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be so good when a projection to your eyes,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re slowly solving those problems.</p>
<p>And I suspect when the renderer of that information</p>
<p>into your head is also AI mediated,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll be able to give you the cues that, you know,</p>
<p>you really want for depth and all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>Like your brain is partly faking your visual field, right?</p>
<p>Like your eyes are twitching around,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t notice that.</p>
<p>Occasionally they blank, you don&rsquo;t notice that.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Like you think you see over here,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t really see there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all fabricated.</p>
<p>Yeah, peripheral vision is fascinating.</p>
<p>So if you have an AI renderer that&rsquo;s trained</p>
<p>to understand exactly how you see</p>
<p>and the kind of things that enhance the realism</p>
<p>of the experience, it could be super real actually.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what the limits to that are,</p>
<p>but obviously if we have a brain interface</p>
<p>that goes inside your visual cortex</p>
<p>in a better way than your eyes do, which is possible,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of neurons, maybe that&rsquo;ll be even cooler.</p>
<p>Well, the really cool thing is that it has to do</p>
<p>with the infinite fun that you were referring to,</p>
<p>which is our brains seem to be very limited.</p>
<p>And like you said, computations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very plastic.</p>
<p>Very plastic, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s a interesting combination.</p>
<p>The interesting open question is the limits</p>
<p>of that neuroplasticity, like how flexible is that thing?</p>
<p>Because we haven&rsquo;t really tested it.</p>
<p>We know about that at the experiments</p>
<p>where they put like a pressure pad on somebody&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>and had a visual transducer pressurize it</p>
<p>and somebody slowly learned to see.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Especially at a young age, if you throw a lot at it,</p>
<p>like what can it, so can you like arbitrarily expand it</p>
<p>with computing power?</p>
<p>So connected to the internet directly somehow?</p>
<p>Yeah, the answer&rsquo;s probably yes.</p>
<p>So the problem with biology and ethics</p>
<p>is like there&rsquo;s a mess there.</p>
<p>Like us humans are perhaps unwilling to take risks</p>
<p>into directions that are full of uncertainty.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like. No, no.</p>
<p>90% of the population&rsquo;s unwilling to take risks.</p>
<p>The other 10% is rushing into the risks</p>
<p>unaided by any infrastructure whatsoever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where all the fun happens in society.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been huge transformations</p>
<p>in the last couple thousand years.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I got a chance to interact with this Matthew Johnson</p>
<p>from Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing this large scale study of psychedelics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming more and more,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to interact</p>
<p>with that community of scientists working on psychedelics.</p>
<p>But because of that, that opened the door to me</p>
<p>to all these, what do they call it?</p>
<p>Psychonauts, the people who, like you said,</p>
<p>the 10% who are like, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a science behind this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking this spaceship to,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m being the first on Mars, I&rsquo;ll be.</p>
<p>Psychedelics are interesting in the sense</p>
<p>that in another dimension, like you said,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a way to explore the limits of the human mind.</p>
<p>Like, what is this thing capable of doing?</p>
<p>Because you kind of, like when you dream, you detach it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly the neuroscience of it,</p>
<p>but you detach your reality from what your mind,</p>
<p>the images your mind is able to conjure up</p>
<p>and your mind goes into weird places and entities appear.</p>
<p>Somehow Freudian type of trauma</p>
<p>is probably connected in there somehow,</p>
<p>but you start to have these weird, vivid worlds that like.</p>
<p>So do you actively dream?</p>
<p>Do you, why not?</p>
<p>I have like six hours of dreams a night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like really useful time.</p>
<p>I know, I haven&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t for some reason.</p>
<p>I just knock out and I have sometimes anxiety inducing</p>
<p>kind of like very pragmatic nightmare type of dreams,</p>
<p>but nothing fun, nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing fun?</p>
<p>Nothing fun.</p>
<p>I try, I unfortunately have mostly have fun</p>
<p>in the waking world, which is very limited</p>
<p>in the amount of fun you can have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that limited either.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to talk.</p>
<p>Yeah, I need instructions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a manual for that.</p>
<p>You might wanna.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look it up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask Elon.</p>
<p>What would you dream?</p>
<p>You know, years ago when I read about, you know,</p>
<p>like, you know, a book about how to have, you know,</p>
<p>become aware of your dreams.</p>
<p>I worked on it for a while.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s this trick about, you know,</p>
<p>imagine you can see your hands and look out</p>
<p>and I got somewhat good at it.</p>
<p>Like, but my mostly, when I&rsquo;m thinking about things</p>
<p>or working on problems, I prep myself before I go to sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I pull into my mind all the things</p>
<p>I wanna work on or think about.</p>
<p>And then that, let&rsquo;s say, greatly improves the chances</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll work on that while I&rsquo;m sleeping.</p>
<p>And then I also, you know, basically ask to remember it.</p>
<p>And I often remember very detailed.</p>
<p>Within the dream.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or outside the dream.</p>
<p>Well, to bring it up in my dreaming</p>
<p>and then to remember it when I wake up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s more of a meditative practice.</p>
<p>You say, you know, to prepare yourself to do that.</p>
<p>Like if you go to, you know, to sleep,</p>
<p>still gnashing your teeth about some random thing</p>
<p>that happened that you&rsquo;re not that really interested in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll dream about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>But you can direct your dreams somewhat by prepping.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna have to try that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Like the most important, the interesting,</p>
<p>not like what did this guy send in an email</p>
<p>kind of like stupid worry stuff,</p>
<p>but like fundamental problems</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually concerned about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And interesting things you&rsquo;re worried about.</p>
<p>Or books you&rsquo;re reading or, you know,</p>
<p>some great conversation you had</p>
<p>or some adventure you want to have.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a lot of space there.</p>
<p>And it seems to work that, you know,</p>
<p>my percentage of interesting dreams and memories went up.</p>
<p>Is there, is that the source of,</p>
<p>if you were able to deconstruct like</p>
<p>where some of your best ideas came from,</p>
<p>is there a process that&rsquo;s at the core of that?</p>
<p>Like, so some people, you know, walk and think,</p>
<p>some people like in the shower, the best ideas hit them.</p>
<p>If you talk about like Newton, Apple hitting them on the head.</p>
<p>No, I found out a long time ago,</p>
<p>I process things somewhat slowly.</p>
<p>So like in college, I had friends who could study</p>
<p>at the last minute, get an A the next day.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do that at all.</p>
<p>So I always front loaded all the work.</p>
<p>Like I do all the problems early, you know,</p>
<p>for finals, like the last three days,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t look at a book because I want, you know,</p>
<p>cause like a new fact day before finals may screw up</p>
<p>my understanding of what I thought I knew.</p>
<p>So my goal was to always get it in and give it time to soak.</p>
<p>And I used to, you know,</p>
<p>I remember when we were doing like 3D calculus,</p>
<p>I would have these amazing dreams of 3D surfaces</p>
<p>with normal, you know, calculating the gradient.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like all come up.</p>
<p>So it was like really fun, like very visual.</p>
<p>And if I got cycles of that, that was useful.</p>
<p>And the other is, is don&rsquo;t over filter your ideas.</p>
<p>Like I like that process of brainstorming</p>
<p>where lots of ideas can happen.</p>
<p>I like people who have lots of ideas.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s a, yeah, I&rsquo;ll let them sit</p>
<p>and let it breathe a little bit</p>
<p>and then reduce it to practice.</p>
<p>Like at some point you really have to, does it really work?</p>
<p>Like, you know, is this real or not, right?</p>
<p>But you have to do both.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s creative tension there.</p>
<p>Like how do you be both open and, you know, precise?</p>
<p>Have you had ideas that you just,</p>
<p>that sit in your mind for like years before the?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting way to just generate ideas</p>
<p>and just let them sit, let them sit there for a while.</p>
<p>I think I have a few of those ideas.</p>
<p>You know, that was so funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>creativity this one or something.</p>
<p>For the slow thinkers in the room, I suppose.</p>
<p>As I, some people, like you said, are just like, like the.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much diversity in how people think.</p>
<p>You know, how fast or slow they are,</p>
<p>how well they remember or don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I&rsquo;m not super good at remembering facts,</p>
<p>but processes and methods.</p>
<p>Like in our engineering, I went to Penn State</p>
<p>and almost all our engineering tests were open book.</p>
<p>I could remember the page and not the formula.</p>
<p>But as soon as I saw the formula,</p>
<p>I could remember the whole method if I&rsquo;d learned it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a funny, where some people could, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d watch friends like flipping through the book,</p>
<p>trying to find the formula,</p>
<p>even knowing that they&rsquo;d done just as much work.</p>
<p>And I would just open the book</p>
<p>and I was on page 27, about half,</p>
<p>I could see the whole thing visually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know.</p>
<p>And you have to learn that about yourself</p>
<p>and figure out what would function optimally.</p>
<p>I had a friend who was always concerned</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t know how he came up with ideas.</p>
<p>He had lots of ideas, but he said they just sort of popped up.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;d be working on something, you have this idea,</p>
<p>like, where does it come from?</p>
<p>But you can have more awareness of it.</p>
<p>Like, how your brain works is a little murky</p>
<p>as you go down from the voice in your head</p>
<p>or the obvious visualizations.</p>
<p>Like, when you visualize something, how does that happen?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You know, if I say, you know, visualize a volcano,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to do, right?</p>
<p>And what does it actually look like when you visualize it?</p>
<p>I can visualize to the point where I don&rsquo;t see very much</p>
<p>out of my eyes and I see the colors</p>
<p>of the thing I&rsquo;m visualizing.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s a shape, there&rsquo;s a texture,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a color, but there&rsquo;s also conceptual visualization.</p>
<p>Like, what are you actually visualizing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re visualizing a volcano?</p>
<p>Just like with peripheral vision,</p>
<p>you think you see the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s a good way to say it.</p>
<p>You know, you have this kind of almost peripheral vision</p>
<p>of your visualizations, they&rsquo;re like these ghosts.</p>
<p>But if, you know, if you work on it,</p>
<p>you can get a pretty high level of detail.</p>
<p>And somehow you can walk along those visualizations</p>
<p>and come up with an idea, which is weird.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re thinking about solving problems,</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re putting information in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exercising the stuff you do know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sort of teasing the area that you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t know, but you can almost, you know,</p>
<p>feel, you know, that process happening.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s how I, like,</p>
<p>like, I know sometimes when I&rsquo;m working really hard</p>
<p>on something, like, I get really hot when I&rsquo;m sleeping.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s like, we got the blank throw,</p>
<p>I wake up, all the blanks are on the floor.</p>
<p>And, you know, every time it&rsquo;s, well,</p>
<p>I wake up and think, wow, that was great.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Are you able to reverse engineer</p>
<p>what the hell happened there?</p>
<p>Well, sometimes it&rsquo;s vivid dreams</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s just kind of, like you say,</p>
<p>like shadow thinking that you sort of have this feeling</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through this stuff, but it&rsquo;s not that obvious.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that so amazing that the mind</p>
<p>just does all these little experiments?</p>
<p>I never, you know, I always thought it&rsquo;s like a river</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re just there for the ride,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right, if you prep it.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s all understandable.</p>
<p>Meditation really helps.</p>
<p>You gotta start figuring out,</p>
<p>you need to learn language of your own mind.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s multiple levels of it, but.</p>
<p>The abstractions again, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat comprehensible and observable</p>
<p>and feelable or whatever the right word is.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re not alone for the ride.</p>
<p>You are the ride.</p>
<p>I have to ask you, hardware engineer,</p>
<p>working on neural networks now, what&rsquo;s consciousness?</p>
<p>What the hell is that thing?</p>
<p>Is that just some little weird quirk</p>
<p>of our particular computing device?</p>
<p>Or is it something fundamental</p>
<p>that we really need to crack open</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re to build good computers?</p>
<p>Do you ever think about consciousness?</p>
<p>Like why it feels like something to be?</p>
<p>I know, it&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, everything about it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s a half a second behind reality, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a post hoc narrative about what happened.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already done stuff</p>
<p>by the time you&rsquo;re conscious of it.</p>
<p>And your consciousness generally</p>
<p>is a single threaded thing,</p>
<p>but we know your brain is 10 billion neurons</p>
<p>running some crazy parallel thing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really big sorting thing going on there.</p>
<p>It also seems to be really reflective</p>
<p>in the sense that you create a space in your head.</p>
<p>Like we don&rsquo;t really see anything, right?</p>
<p>Like photons hit your eyes,</p>
<p>it gets turned into signals,</p>
<p>it goes through multiple layers of neurons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so curious that that looks glassy</p>
<p>and that looks not glassy.</p>
<p>Like how the resolution of your vision is so high</p>
<p>you have to go through all this processing.</p>
<p>Where for most of it, it looks nothing like vision.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no theater in your mind, right?</p>
<p>So we have a world in our heads.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re literally just isolated behind our sensors.</p>
<p>But we can look at it, speculate about it,</p>
<p>speculate about alternatives, problem solve, what if.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things going on</p>
<p>and that process is lagging reality.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s single threaded</p>
<p>even though the underlying thing is like massively parallel.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so curious.</p>
<p>So imagine you&rsquo;re building an AI computer.</p>
<p>If you wanted to replicate humans,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;d have huge arrays of neural networks</p>
<p>and apparently only six or seven deep, which is hilarious.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even remember seven numbers,</p>
<p>but I think we can upgrade that a lot, right?</p>
<p>And then somewhere in there,</p>
<p>you would train the network to create</p>
<p>basically the world that you live in, right?</p>
<p>So like tell stories to itself</p>
<p>about the world that it&rsquo;s perceiving.</p>
<p>Well, create the world, tell stories in the world</p>
<p>and then have many dimensions of like side shows to it.</p>
<p>Like we have an emotional structure,</p>
<p>like we have a biological structure.</p>
<p>And that seems hierarchical too.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re hungry, it dominates your thinking.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re mad, it dominates your thinking.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to consciousness or not,</p>
<p>but it certainly disrupts, intrudes in the consciousness.</p>
<p>Like so there&rsquo;s lots of structure to that.</p>
<p>And we like to dwell on the past.</p>
<p>We like to think about the future.</p>
<p>We like to imagine, we like to fantasize, right?</p>
<p>And the somewhat circular observation of that</p>
<p>is the thing we call consciousness.</p>
<p>Now, if you created a computer system</p>
<p>and did all things, create worldviews,</p>
<p>create the future alternate histories,</p>
<p>dwelled on past events, accurately or semi accurately.</p>
<p>Well, consciousness just spring up like naturally.</p>
<p>Well, would that look and feel conscious to you?</p>
<p>Like you seem conscious to me, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Off of the external observer sense.</p>
<p>Do you think a thing that looks conscious is conscious?</p>
<p>Like do you, again, this is like an engineering</p>
<p>kind of question, I think, because like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If we want to engineer consciousness,</p>
<p>is it okay to engineer something</p>
<p>that just looks conscious?</p>
<p>Or is there a difference between something that is?</p>
<p>Well, we evolve consciousness</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a super effective way to manage our affairs.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a social element, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, it gives us a planning system.</p>
<p>We have a huge amount of stuff.</p>
<p>Like when we&rsquo;re talking, like the reason</p>
<p>we can talk really fast is we&rsquo;re modeling each other</p>
<p>at a really high level of detail.</p>
<p>And consciousness is required for that.</p>
<p>Well, all those components together</p>
<p>manifest consciousness, right?</p>
<p>So if we make intelligent beings</p>
<p>that we want to interact with that we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>wondering what they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>looking forward to seeing them,</p>
<p>when they interact with them, they&rsquo;re interesting,</p>
<p>surprising, you know, fascinating, you know,</p>
<p>they will probably feel conscious like we do</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll perceive them as conscious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why not, but you never know.</p>
<p>Another fun question on this,</p>
<p>because from a computing perspective,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to create something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s humanlike or superhumanlike.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about aliens.</p>
<p>Aliens.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s intelligent alien civilizations</p>
<p>out there and do you think their technology,</p>
<p>their computing, their AI bots,</p>
<p>their chips are of the same nature as ours?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve got no idea.</p>
<p>I mean, if there&rsquo;s lots of aliens out there</p>
<p>that have been awfully quiet,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s speculation about why.</p>
<p>There seems to be more than enough planets out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s intelligent life on this planet</p>
<p>that seems quite different, you know,</p>
<p>like dolphins seem like plausibly understandable,</p>
<p>octopuses don&rsquo;t seem understandable at all.</p>
<p>If they lived longer than a year,</p>
<p>maybe they would be running the planet.</p>
<p>They seem really smart.</p>
<p>And their neural architecture</p>
<p>is completely different than ours.</p>
<p>Now, who knows how they perceive things.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the question is for us intelligent beings,</p>
<p>we might not be able to perceive other kinds of intelligence</p>
<p>if they become sufficiently different than us.</p>
<p>Yeah, like we live in the current constrained world,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s three dimensional geometry</p>
<p>and the geometry defines a certain amount of physics.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s like how time works seems to work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many things that seem like</p>
<p>a whole bunch of the input parameters to the, you know,</p>
<p>another conscious being are the same.</p>
<p>Yes, like if it&rsquo;s biological,</p>
<p>biological things seem to be</p>
<p>in a relatively narrow temperature range, right?</p>
<p>Because, you know, organics aren&rsquo;t stable,</p>
<p>too cold or too hot.</p>
<p>Now, so if you specify the list of things that input to that,</p>
<p>but as soon as we make really smart, you know, beings</p>
<p>and they go solve about how to think</p>
<p>about a billion numbers at the same time</p>
<p>and how to think in end dimensions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a funny science fiction book</p>
<p>where all the society had uploaded into this matrix.</p>
<p>And at some point, some of the beings in the matrix thought,</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there.</p>
<p>So they had to do a whole bunch of work to figure out</p>
<p>like how to make a physical thing</p>
<p>because their matrix was self sustaining</p>
<p>and they made a little spaceship</p>
<p>and they traveled to another planet when they got there,</p>
<p>there was like life running around,</p>
<p>but there was no intelligent life.</p>
<p>And then they figured out that there was these huge,</p>
<p>you know, organic matrix all over the planet</p>
<p>inside there where intelligent beings</p>
<p>had uploaded themselves into that matrix.</p>
<p>So everywhere intelligent life was,</p>
<p>soon as it got smart, it upleveled itself</p>
<p>into something way more interesting than 3D geometry.</p>
<p>Yeah, it escaped whatever this,</p>
<p>not escaped, uplevel is better.</p>
<p>The essence of what we think of as an intelligent being,</p>
<p>I tend to like the thought experiment of the organism,</p>
<p>like humans aren&rsquo;t the organisms.</p>
<p>I like the notion of like Richard Dawkins and memes</p>
<p>that ideas themselves are the organisms,</p>
<p>like that are just using our minds to evolve.</p>
<p>So like we&rsquo;re just like meat receptacles</p>
<p>for ideas to breed and multiply and so on.</p>
<p>And maybe those are the aliens.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Jordan Peterson has a line that says,</p>
<p>you know, you think you have ideas, but ideas have you.</p>
<p>Yeah, good line.</p>
<p>Which, and then we know about the phenomenon of groupthink</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many things that constrain us.</p>
<p>But I think you can examine all that</p>
<p>and not be completely owned by the ideas</p>
<p>and completely sucked into groupthink.</p>
<p>And part of your responsibility as a human</p>
<p>is to escape that kind of phenomenon,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s one of the creative tension things again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constructed by it, but you can still observe it</p>
<p>and you can think about it and you can make choices</p>
<p>about to some level, how constrained you are by it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s useful to do that.</p>
<p>And, but at the same time, and it could be by doing that,</p>
<p>you know, the group and society you&rsquo;re part of</p>
<p>becomes collectively even more interesting.</p>
<p>So, you know, so the outside observer will think,</p>
<p>wow, you know, all these Lexus running around</p>
<p>with all these really independent ideas</p>
<p>have created something even more interesting</p>
<p>in the aggregate.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know, those are lenses to look at the situation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll give you some inspiration,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re constrained.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>As a small little quirk of history,</p>
<p>it seems like you&rsquo;re related to Jordan Peterson,</p>
<p>like you mentioned.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going through some rough stuff now.</p>
<p>Is there some comment you can make</p>
<p>about the roughness of the human journey, the ups and downs?</p>
<p>Well, I became an expert in Benza withdrawal,</p>
<p>like, which is, you took Benza to Aspen&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and at some point they interact with GABA circuits,</p>
<p>you know, to reduce anxiety and do a hundred other things.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s actually no known list of everything they do</p>
<p>because they interact with so many parts of your body.</p>
<p>And then once you&rsquo;re on them, you habituate to them</p>
<p>and you have a dependency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re a drug dependency</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re trying to get high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a metabolic dependency.</p>
<p>And then if you discontinue them,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a funny thing called kindling,</p>
<p>which is if you stop them and then go,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;ll have a horrible withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>And if you go back on them at the same level,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t be stable.</p>
<p>And that unfortunately happened to him.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so deeply integrated</p>
<p>into all the kinds of systems in the body.</p>
<p>It literally changes the size and numbers</p>
<p>of neurotransmitter sites in your brain.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a process called the Ashton protocol</p>
<p>where you taper it down slowly over two years</p>
<p>to people go through that goes through unbelievable hell.</p>
<p>And what Jordan went through seemed to be worse</p>
<p>because on advice of doctors, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll stop taking these and take this.</p>
<p>It was the disaster.</p>
<p>And he got some, yeah, it was pretty tough.</p>
<p>He seems to be doing quite a bit better intellectually.</p>
<p>You can see his brain clicking back together.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time with him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen anybody suffer so much.</p>
<p>Well, his brain is also like this powerhouse, right?</p>
<p>So I wonder, does a brain that&rsquo;s able to think deeply</p>
<p>about the world suffer more through these kinds</p>
<p>of withdrawals, like?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched videos of people going through withdrawal.</p>
<p>They all seem to suffer unbelievably.</p>
<p>And, you know, my heart goes out to everybody.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some funny math about this.</p>
<p>Some doctor said, as best he can tell, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the standard recommendations.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take them for more than a month</p>
<p>and then taper over a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Many doctors prescribe them endlessly,</p>
<p>which is against the protocol, but it&rsquo;s common, right?</p>
<p>And then something like 75% of people, when they taper,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, half the people have difficulty,</p>
<p>but 75% get off okay.</p>
<p>20% have severe difficulty</p>
<p>and 5% have life threatening difficulty.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re one of those, it&rsquo;s really bad.</p>
<p>And the stories that people have on this</p>
<p>is heartbreaking and tough.</p>
<p>So you put some of the fault at the doctors.</p>
<p>They just not know what the hell they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those commonly prescribed things.</p>
<p>Like one doctor said, what happens is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re prescribed them for a reason</p>
<p>and then you have a hard time getting off,</p>
<p>the protocol basically says you&rsquo;re either crazy</p>
<p>or dependent and you get kind of pushed</p>
<p>into a different treatment regime.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a drug addict or a psychiatric patient.</p>
<p>And so like one doctor said, you know,</p>
<p>I prescribed them for 10 years thinking</p>
<p>I was helping my patients</p>
<p>and I realized I was really harming them.</p>
<p>And you know, the awareness of that is slowly coming up.</p>
<p>The fact that they&rsquo;re casually prescribed to people</p>
<p>is horrible and it&rsquo;s bloody scary.</p>
<p>And some people are stable on them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re on them for life.</p>
<p>Like once you, you know, it&rsquo;s another one of those drugs.</p>
<p>But benzos long range have real impacts on your personality.</p>
<p>People talk about the benzo bubble</p>
<p>where you get disassociated from reality</p>
<p>and your friends a little bit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really terrible.</p>
<p>The mind is terrifying.</p>
<p>We were talking about how the infinite possibility of fun,</p>
<p>but like it&rsquo;s the infinite possibility of suffering too,</p>
<p>which is one of the dangers of like expansion</p>
<p>of the human mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I wonder if all the possible experiences</p>
<p>that an intelligent computer can have,</p>
<p>is it mostly fun or is it mostly suffering?</p>
<p>So like if you brute force expand the set of possibilities,</p>
<p>like are you going to run into some trouble</p>
<p>in terms of like torture and suffering and so on?</p>
<p>Maybe our human brain is just protecting us</p>
<p>from much more possible pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Maybe the space of pain is like much larger</p>
<p>than we could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s in a balance.</p>
<p>You know, all the literature on religion and stuff is,</p>
<p>you know, the struggle between good and evil</p>
<p>is balanced for very finely tuned</p>
<p>for reasons that are complicated.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a long philosophical conversation.</p>
<p>Speaking of balance that&rsquo;s complicated,</p>
<p>I wonder because we&rsquo;re living through</p>
<p>one of the more important moments in human history</p>
<p>with this particular virus.</p>
<p>It seems like pandemics have at least the ability</p>
<p>to kill off most of the human population at their worst.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just fascinating</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many viruses in this world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many, I mean, viruses basically run the world</p>
<p>in the sense that they&rsquo;ve been around very long time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>They seem to be extremely powerful</p>
<p>in the distributed kind of way.</p>
<p>But at the same time, they&rsquo;re not intelligent</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not even living.</p>
<p>Do you have like high level thoughts about this virus</p>
<p>that like in terms of you being fascinated or terrified</p>
<p>or somewhere in between?</p>
<p>So I believe in frameworks, right?</p>
<p>So like one of them is evolution.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re evolved creatures, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And one of the things about evolution</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s hyper competitive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not competitive out of a sense of evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s competitive as a sense of there&rsquo;s endless variation</p>
<p>and variations that work better when.</p>
<p>And then over time, there&rsquo;s so many levels</p>
<p>of that competition.</p>
<p>Like multicellular life partly exists</p>
<p>because of the competition</p>
<p>between different kinds of life forms.</p>
<p>And we know sex partly exists to scramble our genes</p>
<p>so that we have genetic variation</p>
<p>against the invasion of the bacteria and the viruses.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s endless.</p>
<p>Like I read some funny statistic,</p>
<p>like the density of viruses and bacteria in the ocean</p>
<p>is really high.</p>
<p>And one third of the bacteria die every day</p>
<p>because a virus is invading them.</p>
<p>Like one third of them.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t know if that number is true,</p>
<p>but it was like the amount of competition</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on is stunning.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a theory as we age,</p>
<p>we slowly accumulate bacterias and viruses</p>
<p>and as our immune system kind of goes down,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what slowly kills us.</p>
<p>It just feels so peaceful from a human perspective</p>
<p>when we sit back and are able</p>
<p>to have a relaxed conversation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s wars going on out there.</p>
<p>Like right now, you&rsquo;re harboring how many bacteria?</p>
<p>And the ones, many of them are parasites on you</p>
<p>and some of them are helpful</p>
<p>and some of them are modifying your behavior</p>
<p>and some of them are, it&rsquo;s just really wild.</p>
<p>But this particular manifestation is unusual</p>
<p>in the demographic, how it hit</p>
<p>and the political response that it engendered</p>
<p>and the healthcare response it engendered</p>
<p>and the technology it engendered, it&rsquo;s kind of wild.</p>
<p>Yeah, the communication on Twitter that it led to,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, at every single level, yeah.</p>
<p>But what usually kills life,</p>
<p>the big extinctions are caused by meteors and volcanoes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one you&rsquo;re worried about</p>
<p>as opposed to human created bombs that we launch.</p>
<p>Solar flares are another good one.</p>
<p>Occasionally, solar flares hit the planet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nature.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all pretty wild.</p>
<p>On another historic moment, this is perhaps outside</p>
<p>but perhaps within your space of frameworks</p>
<p>that you think about that just happened,</p>
<p>I guess a couple of weeks ago is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re paying attention at all,</p>
<p>is the GameStop and Wall Street bets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super fun.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really fascinating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s kind of a theme to this conversation today</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like neural networks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cool how there&rsquo;s a large number of people</p>
<p>in a distributed way, almost having a kind of fun,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to take on the powerful elites,</p>
<p>elite hedge funds, centralized powers and overpower them.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts on this whole saga?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know enough about finance,</p>
<p>but it was like the Elon, Robinhood guy when they talked.</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;d you think about that?</p>
<p>Well, Robinhood guy didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how the finance system worked.</p>
<p>That was clear, right?</p>
<p>He was treating like the people</p>
<p>who settled the transactions as a black box.</p>
<p>And suddenly somebody called him up and say,</p>
<p>hey, black box calling you, your transaction volume</p>
<p>means you need to put out $3 billion right now.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t have $3 billion.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t even make any money on these trades.</p>
<p>Why do I owe $3 billion while you&rsquo;re sponsoring the trade?</p>
<p>So there was a set of abstractions</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think either, like now we understand it.</p>
<p>Like this happens in chip design.</p>
<p>Like you buy wafers from TSMC or Samsung or Intel,</p>
<p>and they say it works like this</p>
<p>and you do your design based on that.</p>
<p>And then chip comes back and doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And then suddenly you started having to open the black boxes.</p>
<p>The transistors really work like they said,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the real issue?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole set of things</p>
<p>that created this opportunity and somebody spotted it.</p>
<p>Now, people spot these kinds of opportunities all the time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been flash crashes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always short squeezes are fairly regular.</p>
<p>Every CEO I know hates the shorts</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to manipulate their stock</p>
<p>in a way that they make money</p>
<p>and deprive value from both the company</p>
<p>and the investors.</p>
<p>So the fact that some of these stocks were so short,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hilarious that this hasn&rsquo;t happened before.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, and I don&rsquo;t actually know why</p>
<p>some serious hedge funds didn&rsquo;t do it to other hedge funds.</p>
<p>And some of the hedge funds</p>
<p>actually made a lot of money on this.</p>
<p>So my guess is we know 5% of what really happened</p>
<p>and that a lot of the players don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
<p>And the people who probably made the most money</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t the people that they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Do you think there was something,</p>
<p>I mean, this is the cool kind of Elon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the same kind of conversationalist,</p>
<p>which is like first principles questions of like,</p>
<p>what the hell happened?</p>
<p>Just very basic questions of like,</p>
<p>was there something shady going on?</p>
<p>What, who are the parties involved?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the basic questions everybody wants to know about.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like we&rsquo;re in a very hyper competitive world,</p>
<p>but transactions like buying and selling stock</p>
<p>is a trust event.</p>
<p>I trust the company, represented themselves properly.</p>
<p>I bought the stock because I think it&rsquo;s gonna go up.</p>
<p>I trust that the regulations are solid.</p>
<p>Now, inside of that, there&rsquo;s all kinds of places</p>
<p>where humans over trust and this exposed,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say some weak points in the system.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s gonna get corrected.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we have close to the real story.</p>
<p>Yeah, my suspicion is we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And listen to that guy, he was like a little wide eyed</p>
<p>about and then he did this and then he did that.</p>
<p>And I was like, I think you should know more</p>
<p>about your business than that.</p>
<p>But again, there&rsquo;s many businesses</p>
<p>when like this layer is really stable,</p>
<p>you stop paying attention to it.</p>
<p>You pay attention to the stuff that&rsquo;s bugging you or new.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t pay attention to the stuff</p>
<p>that just seems to work all the time.</p>
<p>You just, sky&rsquo;s blue every day, California.</p>
<p>And every once in a while it rains</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s like, what do we do?</p>
<p>Somebody go bring in the lawn furniture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting wet.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s getting wet.</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t always work.</p>
<p>I was blue for like a hundred days and now it&rsquo;s, so.</p>
<p>But part of the problem here with Vlad,</p>
<p>the CEO of Robinhood is the scaling</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about is there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of unexpected things that happen with the scaling</p>
<p>and you have to be, I think the scaling forces you</p>
<p>to then return to the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting because when you buy and sell stocks,</p>
<p>the scaling is, the stocks don&rsquo;t only move</p>
<p>in a certain range and if you buy a stock,</p>
<p>you can only lose that amount of money.</p>
<p>On the short market, you can lose a lot more</p>
<p>than you can benefit.</p>
<p>Like it has a weird cost function</p>
<p>or whatever the right word for that is.</p>
<p>So he was trading in a market</p>
<p>where he wasn&rsquo;t actually capitalized for the downside.</p>
<p>If it got outside a certain range.</p>
<p>Now, whether something nefarious has happened,</p>
<p>I have no idea, but at some point,</p>
<p>the financial risk to both him and his customers</p>
<p>was way outside of his financial capacity</p>
<p>and his understanding how the system work was clearly weak</p>
<p>or he didn&rsquo;t represent himself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the person and when I listened to him,</p>
<p>it could have been the surprise question was like,</p>
<p>and then these guys called and it sounded like</p>
<p>he was treating stuff as a black box.</p>
<p>Maybe he shouldn&rsquo;t have, but maybe he has a whole pile</p>
<p>of experts somewhere else and it was going on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is one of the qualities</p>
<p>of a good leader is under fire, you have to perform.</p>
<p>And that means to think clearly and to speak clearly.</p>
<p>And he dropped the ball on those things</p>
<p>because and understand the problem quickly,</p>
<p>learn and understand the problem at this basic level.</p>
<p>What the hell happened?</p>
<p>And my guess is, at some level it was amateurs trading</p>
<p>against experts slash insiders slash people</p>
<p>with special information.</p>
<p>Outsiders versus insiders.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the insiders, my guess is the next time</p>
<p>this happens, we&rsquo;ll make money on it.</p>
<p>The insiders always win?</p>
<p>Well, they have more tools and more incentive.</p>
<p>I mean, this always happens.</p>
<p>Like the outsiders are doing this for fun.</p>
<p>The insiders are doing this 24 seven.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s numbers in the outsiders.</p>
<p>This is the interesting thing is it could be</p>
<p>a new chapter. There&rsquo;s numbers</p>
<p>on the insiders too.</p>
<p>Different kind of numbers, yeah.</p>
<p>But this could be a new era because, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>at least I didn&rsquo;t expect that a bunch of Redditors could,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s millions of people who can get together.</p>
<p>It was a surprise attack.</p>
<p>The next one will be a surprise.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think the crowd, the people are planning</p>
<p>the next attack?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>But it has to be a surprise.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be the same game.</p>
<p>And so the insiders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it could be there&rsquo;s a very large number</p>
<p>of games to play and they can be agile about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>The space of games, how restricted is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the system is so complicated</p>
<p>it could be relatively unrestricted.</p>
<p>And also during the last couple of financial crashes,</p>
<p>what set it off was sets of derivative events</p>
<p>where Nassim Taleb&rsquo;s thing is they&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to lower volatility in the short run</p>
<p>by creating tail events.</p>
<p>And the system&rsquo;s always evolved towards that</p>
<p>and then they always crash.</p>
<p>The S curve is the start low, ramp, plateau, crash.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100% effective.</p>
<p>In the long run.</p>
<p>Let me ask you some advice to put on your profound hat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of young folks who listen to this thing</p>
<p>for no good reason whatsoever.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students, maybe high school students,</p>
<p>maybe just young folks, a young at heart</p>
<p>looking for the next steps to take in life.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today</p>
<p>about life, maybe career, but also life in general?</p>
<p>Get good at some stuff.</p>
<p>Well, get to know yourself, right?</p>
<p>Get good at something that you&rsquo;re actually interested in.</p>
<p>You have to love what you&rsquo;re doing to get good at it.</p>
<p>You really gotta find that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste all your time doing stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just boring or bland or numbing, right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let old people screw you.</p>
<p>Well, people get talked into doing all kinds of shit</p>
<p>and racking up huge student debts</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so much crap going on.</p>
<p>And then drains your time and drains your energy.</p>
<p>The Eric Weinstein thesis that the older generation</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t let go and they&rsquo;re trapping all the young people.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s some truth to that?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Just because you&rsquo;re old doesn&rsquo;t mean you stop thinking.</p>
<p>I know lots of really original old people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an old person.</p>
<p>But you have to be conscious about it.</p>
<p>You can fall into the ruts and then do that.</p>
<p>I mean, when I hear young people spouting opinions</p>
<p>that sounds like they come from Fox News or CNN,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve been captured by groupthink and memes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to think on their own.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself repeating</p>
<p>what everybody else is saying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have a good life.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s not how the world works.</p>
<p>It seems safe, but it puts you at great jeopardy</p>
<p>for being boring or unhappy.</p>
<p>How long did it take you to find the thing</p>
<p>that you have fun with?</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fun person since I was pretty little.</p>
<p>So everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through a couple periods of depression in my life.</p>
<p>For a good reason or for a reason</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, like some things are hard.</p>
<p>Like you go through mental transitions in high school.</p>
<p>I was really depressed for a year</p>
<p>and I think I had my first midlife crisis at 26.</p>
<p>I kind of thought, is this all there is?</p>
<p>Like I was working at a job that I loved,</p>
<p>but I was going to work and all my time was consumed.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the escape out of that depression?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the answer to is this all there is?</p>
<p>Well, a friend of mine, I asked him,</p>
<p>because he was working his ass off,</p>
<p>I said, what&rsquo;s your work life balance?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s work, friends, family, personal time.</p>
<p>Are you balancing any of that?</p>
<p>And he said, work 80%, family 20%.</p>
<p>And I tried to find some time to sleep.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no personal time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no passionate time.</p>
<p>Like the young people are often passionate about work.</p>
<p>So I was certainly like that.</p>
<p>But you need to have some space in your life</p>
<p>for different things.</p>
<p>And that creates, that makes you resistant</p>
<p>to the whole, the deep dips into depression kind of thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you have to get to know yourself too.</p>
<p>Meditation helps.</p>
<p>Some physical, something physically intense helps.</p>
<p>Like the weird places your mind goes kind of thing.</p>
<p>Like, and why does it happen?</p>
<p>Why do you do what you do?</p>
<p>Like triggers, like the things that cause your mind</p>
<p>to go to different places kind of thing,</p>
<p>or like events like.</p>
<p>Your upbringing for better or worse,</p>
<p>whether your parents are great people or not,</p>
<p>you come into adulthood with all kinds of emotional burdens.</p>
<p>And you can see some people are so bloody stiff</p>
<p>and restrained, and they think the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fundamentally negative, like you maybe.</p>
<p>You have unexplored territory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or you&rsquo;re afraid of something.</p>
<p>Definitely afraid of quite a few things.</p>
<p>Then you gotta go face them.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the worst thing that can happen?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna die, right?</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>You might as well get over that.</p>
<p>Like 100%, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Like people are worried about the virus,</p>
<p>but you know, the human condition is pretty deadly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about embarrassment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve competed a lot in my life,</p>
<p>and I think the, if I&rsquo;m to introspect it,</p>
<p>the thing I&rsquo;m most afraid of is being like humiliated,</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, nobody cares about that.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re the only person on the planet</p>
<p>that cares about you being humiliated.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a really useless thought.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re all humiliated.</p>
<p>Something happened in a room full of people,</p>
<p>and they walk out, and they didn&rsquo;t think about it</p>
<p>one more second.</p>
<p>Or maybe somebody told a funny story to somebody else.</p>
<p>And then it dissipates it throughout, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I know it too.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been really embarrassed about shit</p>
<p>that nobody cared about myself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny thing.</p>
<p>So the worst thing ultimately is just.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s a cage,</p>
<p>and then you have to get out of it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like once you, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Once you find something like that,</p>
<p>you have to be determined to break it.</p>
<p>Because otherwise you&rsquo;ll just,</p>
<p>so you accumulate that kind of junk,</p>
<p>and then you die as a mess.</p>
<p>So the goal, I guess it&rsquo;s like a cage within a cage.</p>
<p>I guess the goal is to die in the biggest possible cage.</p>
<p>Well, ideally you&rsquo;d have no cage.</p>
<p>People do get enlightened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met a few.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve found a few?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few out there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Of course there are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Either that or it&rsquo;s a great sales pitch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enlightened people writing books</p>
<p>and doing all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good way to sell a book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never met somebody you just thought,</p>
<p>they just kill me.</p>
<p>Like they just, like mental clarity, humor.</p>
<p>No, 100%, but I just feel like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re living in a bigger cage.</p>
<p>They have their own.</p>
<p>You still think there&rsquo;s a cage?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a cage.</p>
<p>You secretly suspect there&rsquo;s always a cage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing outside the universe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing outside the cage.</p>
<p>You work in a bunch of companies,</p>
<p>you lead a lot of amazing teams.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve ever been</p>
<p>like in the early stages of a startup,</p>
<p>but do you have advice for somebody</p>
<p>that wants to do a startup or build a company,</p>
<p>like build a strong team of engineers that are passionate</p>
<p>and just want to solve a big problem?</p>
<p>Like, is there a more specifically on that point?</p>
<p>Well, you have to be really good at stuff.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to lead and build a team,</p>
<p>you better be really interested</p>
<p>in how people work and think.</p>
<p>The people or the solution to the problem.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two things, right?</p>
<p>One is how people work and the other is the&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, actually there&rsquo;s quite a few successful startups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear the founders</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know anything about people.</p>
<p>Like the idea was so powerful that it propelled them.</p>
<p>But I suspect somewhere early,</p>
<p>they hired some people who understood people</p>
<p>because people really need a lot of care and feeding</p>
<p>to collaborate and work together</p>
<p>and feel engaged and work hard.</p>
<p>Like startups are all about out producing other people.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re nimble because you don&rsquo;t have any legacy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a bunch of people</p>
<p>who are depressed about life just showing up.</p>
<p>So startups have a lot of advantages that way.</p>
<p>Do you like the, Steve Jobs talked about this idea</p>
<p>of A players and B players.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know this formulation.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>Organizations that get taken over by B player leaders</p>
<p>often really underperform their C players.</p>
<p>That said, in big organizations,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much work to do.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many people who are happy</p>
<p>to do what the leadership or the big idea people</p>
<p>would consider menial jobs.</p>
<p>And you need a place for them,</p>
<p>but you need an organization that both values and rewards</p>
<p>them but doesn&rsquo;t let them take over the leadership of it.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So you need to have an organization</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s resistant to that.</p>
<p>But in the early days, the notion with Steve</p>
<p>was that like one B player in a room of A players</p>
<p>will be like destructive to the whole.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen that happen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s like always true.</p>
<p>You run into people who are clearly B players</p>
<p>but they think they&rsquo;re A players</p>
<p>and so they have a loud voice at the table</p>
<p>and they make lots of demands for that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s other people who are like, I know who I am.</p>
<p>I just wanna work with cool people on cool shit</p>
<p>and just tell me what to do and I&rsquo;ll go get it done.</p>
<p>So you have to, again, this is like people skills.</p>
<p>What kind of person is it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met some really great people I love working with</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t the biggest ID people or the most productive</p>
<p>ever but they show up, they get it done.</p>
<p>They create connection and community that people value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty diverse so I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a recipe for that.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you about love.</p>
<p>I heard you&rsquo;re into this now.</p>
<p>Into this love thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, is this, do you think this is your solution</p>
<p>to your depression?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just trying to, like you said,</p>
<p>delighting people and occasionally trying to sell a book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing a book about love.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re writing a book about love?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I have a friend of mine, he&rsquo;s gonna,</p>
<p>he said you should really write a book</p>
<p>about your management philosophy.</p>
<p>He said it&rsquo;d be a short book.</p>
<p>Well, that one was thought pretty well.</p>
<p>What role do you think love, family, friendship,</p>
<p>all that kind of human stuff play in a successful life?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been exceptionally successful in the space</p>
<p>of running teams, building cool shit in this world,</p>
<p>creating some amazing things.</p>
<p>What, did love get in the way?</p>
<p>Did love help the family get in the way?</p>
<p>Did family help friendship?</p>
<p>You want the engineer&rsquo;s answer?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>But first, love is functional, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s functional in what way?</p>
<p>So we habituate ourselves to the environment.</p>
<p>And actually, Jordan Peterson told me this line.</p>
<p>So you go through life and you just get used to everything,</p>
<p>except for the things you love.</p>
<p>They remain new.</p>
<p>Like, this is really useful for, you know,</p>
<p>like other people&rsquo;s children and dogs and trees.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t pay that much attention to them.</p>
<p>Your own kids, you monitor them really closely.</p>
<p>Like, and if they go off a little bit,</p>
<p>because you love them, if you&rsquo;re smart,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna be a successful parent,</p>
<p>you notice it right away.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t habituate to just things you love.</p>
<p>And if you want to be successful at work,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t love it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna put the time in somebody else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somebody else that loves it.</p>
<p>Like, because it&rsquo;s new and interesting,</p>
<p>and that lets you go to the next level.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s just a function</p>
<p>that generates newness and novelty</p>
<p>and surprises, you know, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who figured out lots of frameworks for this.</p>
<p>Like, humans seem to go,</p>
<p>in partnership, go through interests.</p>
<p>Like, suddenly somebody&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re infatuated with them,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re in love with them.</p>
<p>And then you, you know, different people have ideas</p>
<p>about parental love or mature love.</p>
<p>Like, you go through a cycle of that,</p>
<p>which keeps us together,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s super functional for creating families</p>
<p>and creating communities and making you support somebody</p>
<p>despite the fact that you don&rsquo;t love them.</p>
<p>Like, and it can be really enriching.</p>
<p>You know, now, in the work life balance scheme,</p>
<p>if alls you do is work,</p>
<p>you think you may be optimizing your work potential,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t love your work</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t have family and friends</p>
<p>and things you care about,</p>
<p>your brain isn&rsquo;t well balanced.</p>
<p>Like, everybody knows the experience of,</p>
<p>he works on something all week.</p>
<p>He went home, took two days off, and he came back in.</p>
<p>The odds of you working on the thing,</p>
<p>you picking up right where you left off is zero.</p>
<p>Your brain refactored it.</p>
<p>But being in love is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like changes the color of the light in the room.</p>
<p>It creates a spaciousness that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>It helps you think.</p>
<p>It makes you strong.</p>
<p>Bukowski had this line about love being a fog</p>
<p>that dissipates with the first light of reality</p>
<p>in the morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s depressing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the other way around.</p>
<p>It lasts.</p>
<p>Well, like you said, it&rsquo;s a function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing that generates.</p>
<p>It can be the light that actually enlivens your world</p>
<p>and creates the interest and the power and the strength</p>
<p>to go do something.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like, that sounds like,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s like physical love, emotional love,</p>
<p>intellectual love, spiritual love, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it all the same thing, kind of?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>You should differentiate that.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s your problem.</p>
<p>In your book, you should refine that a little bit.</p>
<p>Is it different chapters?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s different chapters.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s these, aren&rsquo;t these just different layers</p>
<p>of the same thing, the stack of physical?</p>
<p>People, some people are addicted to physical love</p>
<p>and they have no idea about emotional or intellectual love.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re the same things.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>They could be different.</p>
<p>I guess the ultimate goal is for it to be the same.</p>
<p>Well, if you want something to be bigger and interesting,</p>
<p>you should find all its components and differentiate them,</p>
<p>not clump it together.</p>
<p>Like, people do this all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah, the modularity.</p>
<p>Get your abstraction layers right</p>
<p>and then you have room to breathe.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you can write the forward to my book</p>
<p>about love.</p>
<p>Or the afterwards.</p>
<p>And the after.</p>
<p>You really tried.</p>
<p>I feel like Lex has made a lot of progress in this book.</p>
<p>Well, you have things in your life that you love.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And they are, you&rsquo;re right, they&rsquo;re modular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quality.</p>
<p>And you can have multiple things with the same person</p>
<p>or the same thing.</p>
<p>But, yeah.</p>
<p>Depending on the moment of the day.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s, like what Bukowski described</p>
<p>is that moment when you go from being in love</p>
<p>to having a different kind of love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a transition.</p>
<p>But when it happens, if you read the owner&rsquo;s manual</p>
<p>and you believed it, you would have said,</p>
<p>oh, this happened.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different kind of love.</p>
<p>But maybe there&rsquo;s something better about that.</p>
<p>As you grow old, all you do is regret how you used to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You should have learned a lot of things</p>
<p>because like who you can be in your future self</p>
<p>is actually more interesting and possibly delightful</p>
<p>than being a mad kid in love with the next person.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s super fun when it happens.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, you know, 5% of the possibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more fun to be had in the long lasting stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, or meaning, you know, if that&rsquo;s your thing.</p>
<p>Which is a kind of fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deeper kind of fun.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s surprising.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s, like the thing I like is surprises.</p>
<p>You know, and you just never know what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>But you have to look carefully and you have to work at it</p>
<p>and you have to think about it and you know, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to see the surprises when they happen, right?</p>
<p>You have to be looking for it.</p>
<p>From the branching perspective, you mentioned regrets.</p>
<p>Do you have regrets about your own trajectory?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Yeah, some of it&rsquo;s painful,</p>
<p>but you wanna hear the painful stuff?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I would say, like in terms of working with people,</p>
<p>when people did stuff I didn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>especially if it was a bit nefarious,</p>
<p>I took it personally and I also felt it was personal</p>
<p>about them.</p>
<p>But a lot of times, like humans are,</p>
<p>you know, most humans are a mess, right?</p>
<p>And then they act out and they do stuff.</p>
<p>And the psychologist I heard a long time ago said,</p>
<p>you tend to think somebody does something to you.</p>
<p>But really what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing while they&rsquo;re in front of you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that much about you, right?</p>
<p>And as I got more interested in,</p>
<p>you know, when I work with people,</p>
<p>I think about them and probably analyze them</p>
<p>and understand them a little bit.</p>
<p>And then when they do stuff, I&rsquo;m way less surprised.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s bad, I&rsquo;m way less hurt.</p>
<p>And I react way less.</p>
<p>Like I sort of expect everybody&rsquo;s got their shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not about you as much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about me that much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, you do something</p>
<p>and you think you&rsquo;re embarrassed, but nobody cares.</p>
<p>Like, and somebody&rsquo;s really mad at you,</p>
<p>the odds of it being about you.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re getting mad the way they&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>because of some pattern they learned.</p>
<p>And you know, and maybe you can help them</p>
<p>if you care enough about it.</p>
<p>But, or you could see it coming and step out of the way.</p>
<p>Like, I wish I was way better at that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit of a hothead.</p>
<p>And in support of that.</p>
<p>You said with Steve, that was a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, he was using it as the counter force</p>
<p>to orderliness that would crush his work.</p>
<p>Well, you were doing the same.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I, I don&rsquo;t think my vision was big enough.</p>
<p>It was more like I just got pissed off and did stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the, yeah, you&rsquo;re telling me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it had the,</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t have the amazing effect</p>
<p>of creating the trillion dollar company.</p>
<p>It was more like I just got pissed off and left</p>
<p>and, or made enemies that I shouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Like, I didn&rsquo;t really understand politics</p>
<p>until I worked at Apple where, you know,</p>
<p>Steve was a master player of politics</p>
<p>and his staff had to be, or they wouldn&rsquo;t survive him.</p>
<p>And it was definitely part of the culture.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve been in companies where they say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s political, but it&rsquo;s all, you know,</p>
<p>fun and games compared to Apple.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that the people at Apple are bad people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, they operate politically at a higher level.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not like, oh, somebody said something bad</p>
<p>about somebody, somebody else, which is most politics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, they had strategies</p>
<p>about accomplishing their goals.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you know, over the dead bodies of their enemies.</p>
<p>You know, with sophistication, yeah,</p>
<p>more Game of Thrones than sophistication</p>
<p>and like a big time factor rather than a, you know.</p>
<p>Wow, that requires a lot of control over your emotions,</p>
<p>I think, to have a bigger strategy in the way you behave.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s effective in the sense</p>
<p>that coordinating thousands of people</p>
<p>to do really hard things where many of the people</p>
<p>in there don&rsquo;t understand themselves,</p>
<p>much less how they&rsquo;re participating,</p>
<p>creates all kinds of, you know, drama and problems</p>
<p>that, you know, our solution is political in nature.</p>
<p>Like how do you convince people?</p>
<p>How do you leverage them?</p>
<p>How do you motivate them?</p>
<p>How do you get rid of them?</p>
<p>How do you, you know, like there&rsquo;s so many layers</p>
<p>of that that are interesting.</p>
<p>And even though some of it, let&rsquo;s say, may be tough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not evil unless, you know, you use that skill</p>
<p>to evil purposes, which some people obviously do.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a skill set that operates, you know.</p>
<p>And I wish I&rsquo;d, you know, I was interested in it,</p>
<p>but I, you know, it was sort of like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an engineer, I do my thing.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s times</p>
<p>when I could have had a way bigger impact</p>
<p>if I, you know, knew how to,</p>
<p>if I paid more attention and knew more about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, about the human layer of the stack.</p>
<p>Yeah, that human political power, you know,</p>
<p>expression layer of the stack.</p>
<p>Just complicated.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s lots to know about it.</p>
<p>I mean, people are good at it, are just amazing.</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re good at it,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s say, relatively kind and oriented</p>
<p>in a good direction, you can really feel,</p>
<p>you can get lots of stuff done and coordinate things</p>
<p>that you never thought possible.</p>
<p>But all people like that also have some pretty hard edges</p>
<p>because, you know, it&rsquo;s a heavy lift.</p>
<p>And I wish I&rsquo;d spent more time like that when I was younger.</p>
<p>But maybe I wasn&rsquo;t ready.</p>
<p>You know, I was a wide eyed kid for 30 years.</p>
<p>Still a bit of a kid.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>What do you hope your legacy is</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a book like Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy,</p>
<p>and this is like a one sentence entry by Jim Waller</p>
<p>from like that guy lived at some point.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not many, you know,</p>
<p>not many people would be remembered.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the sparkling little human creatures</p>
<p>that had a big impact on the world.</p>
<p>How do you hope you&rsquo;ll be remembered?</p>
<p>My daughter was trying to get,</p>
<p>she edited my Wikipedia page</p>
<p>to say that I was a legend and a guru.</p>
<p>But they took it out, so she put it back in.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s 15.</p>
<p>I think that was probably the best part of my legacy.</p>
<p>She got her sister, and they were all excited.</p>
<p>They were like trying to put it in the references</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s articles and that on the title.</p>
<p>So in the eyes of your kids, you&rsquo;re a legend.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re pretty skeptical</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t be better than that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like dad.</p>
<p>So yeah, that kind of stuff is super fun.</p>
<p>In terms of the big legends stuff, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just an engineer.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about building a big pyramid.</p>
<p>So I had a debate with a friend</p>
<p>about whether pyramids or craters are cooler.</p>
<p>And he realized that there&rsquo;s craters everywhere,</p>
<p>but they built a couple of pyramids 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>And they remember you for a while.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still talking about it.</p>
<p>So I think that would be cool.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t easy to build.</p>
<p>Oh, I know.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t actually know how they built them,</p>
<p>which is great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either AGI or aliens could be involved.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out</p>
<p>quite a few more things than just</p>
<p>the basics of civil engineering.</p>
<p>So I guess you hope your legacy is pyramids.</p>
<p>That would be cool.</p>
<p>And my Wikipedia page, you know,</p>
<p>getting updated by my daughter periodically.</p>
<p>Like those two things would pretty much make it.</p>
<p>Jim, it&rsquo;s a huge honor talking to you again.</p>
<p>I hope we talk many more times in the future.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what you do with Tense Torrent.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to use it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for you to revolutionize</p>
<p>yet another space in computing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking to me.</p>
<p>This was fun.</p>
<p>See you next time.</p>
