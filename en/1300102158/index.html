<p>thing that people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appreciate if you came up in the old windows days</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s seamless</p>
<p>it always works</p>
<p>man i started out with windows 95</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure you probably</p>
<p>started way before that we&rsquo;re showing her</p>
<p>age dude yeah</p>
<p>windows 95 was the</p>
<p>first pc that i ever had</p>
<p>and i remember one time i somehow another</p>
<p>i did something</p>
<p>somehow or another i installed my operating</p>
<p>system onto</p>
<p>one of those big</p>
<p>drives who are</p>
<p>those big stupid</p>
<p>drives remember</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>no it was like</p>
<p>another step</p>
<p>above that zip</p>
<p>drive oh yeah</p>
<p>the slow ones</p>
<p>it was a big</p>
<p>one like it was probably like one megabyte or something</p>
<p>stupid it really</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that big</p>
<p>stone tablet yeah it was</p>
<p>giant this big fucking brick shiz</p>
<p>somehow or another</p>
<p>that became my</p>
<p>startup drive</p>
<p>i installed windows so</p>
<p>that it took</p>
<p>like four days for your computer to boot up</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t boot up it was just</p>
<p>chaos and so i had to</p>
<p>bring it into a guy who was a</p>
<p>pc expert who figured out what the fuck i</p>
<p>live retardation i that guy later was</p>
<p>found the geek</p>
<p>squad he&rsquo;s a billionaire now</p>
<p>yeah meanwhile</p>
<p>the technologies built</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s like money</p>
<p>right like anytime you have something like six months</p>
<p>later there&rsquo;s a new version that comes up like damn i</p>
<p>gotta upgrade this you know what</p>
<p>they say that but i don&rsquo;t see it that way i</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>exciting i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of like people are good sucks because you</p>
<p>know you know fucking the new shits coming out and they</p>
<p>build it that way</p>
<p>no they&rsquo;re just trying to</p>
<p>catch up with the ideas</p>
<p>i think technology is moving at such</p>
<p>a fucking insane rate i got guys at work they have kids</p>
<p>right now and my</p>
<p>buddy lee he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of our designers</p>
<p>he pulled his</p>
<p>daughter aside and he&rsquo;s like look</p>
<p>things have gotten pretty cool in my lifetime you have</p>
<p>absolutely no idea the</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;re in for</p>
<p>like where the world is</p>
<p>going like the</p>
<p>world in 10 15 years is</p>
<p>gonna be completely unrecognizable yeah i</p>
<p>agree it&rsquo;s like from</p>
<p>where we were as kids like you can&rsquo;t even imagine</p>
<p>right like with nanotechnology and</p>
<p>everything it&rsquo;s unbelievable</p>
<p>and you and i</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry you and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had this conversation a couple of times one of the</p>
<p>things you turn me on to is fucking</p>
<p>3d printers</p>
<p>the idea that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>able to have certain elements inside of a machine</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be able to</p>
<p>print objects we talked</p>
<p>about on the podcast before that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have to go to</p>
<p>stores to buy</p>
<p>things no more than you</p>
<p>have to go to</p>
<p>stores to get a</p>
<p>picture you can download a</p>
<p>picture i already hate</p>
<p>going to the</p>
<p>store now dude like you know you go to big box retail</p>
<p>it takes like 45 minutes to find what you want like</p>
<p>okay so now i use</p>
<p>amazon but if i can actually have a fabricator in my</p>
<p>house that can</p>
<p>print out a pen</p>
<p>like fine right because</p>
<p>you have the like</p>
<p>the wooden type ones</p>
<p>right now that kind of</p>
<p>printed out of kind of like a</p>
<p>like shaved material</p>
<p>right you can</p>
<p>just send them a 3d</p>
<p>studio object and then they have</p>
<p>metal ones where you can just</p>
<p>build your metal</p>
<p>object just</p>
<p>layer by layer</p>
<p>and then eventually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be everything glad</p>
<p>we got a way to manipulate</p>
<p>whatever atoms and molecules to</p>
<p>build whatever you want out of it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unbelievable</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s coming online man</p>
<p>and smart dust we were talking</p>
<p>about right yeah</p>
<p>that was another</p>
<p>thing that you sent me hip to</p>
<p>well explain the whole</p>
<p>thing for people who don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>smart dust is at a very high</p>
<p>level because</p>
<p>again i&rsquo;m a bit of a luddite despite</p>
<p>what i do for a living</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this kind of dust that they&rsquo;re able to sprinkle</p>
<p>out in the battlefield each one has a little bit of a</p>
<p>transmitter on it and</p>
<p>they can detect if anybody walks on it like any sort of</p>
<p>footstep patterns on it because it</p>
<p>essentially</p>
<p>creates a little network that then sends back to base</p>
<p>and then what happens is it can also kind of</p>
<p>catch in people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shoes and little bits of</p>
<p>their clothing you know</p>
<p>just like little dna bits you</p>
<p>would find with</p>
<p>pieces of hair in a</p>
<p>crime scene</p>
<p>and they can</p>
<p>track whoever actually has that on them</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>you combine where</p>
<p>technology is</p>
<p>going with the connectivity we have in the world</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>scary right we talk</p>
<p>about the end of privacy as we know it right</p>
<p>how big are</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re tiny</p>
<p>the size of a</p>
<p>small grain of sand</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know how many are actually out there yet</p>
<p>right about how much sand you get in your</p>
<p>shoes when you go to the beach</p>
<p>yeah i got a lot</p>
<p>you imagine</p>
<p>could you imagine</p>
<p>if all that&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>we already have</p>
<p>transmitters by</p>
<p>that right by the time we know about it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve always said</p>
<p>about by the time we hear</p>
<p>about it that&rsquo;s been in use for years</p>
<p>when they talk</p>
<p>about clones i&rsquo;m like by the time they tell you they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>cloned a person the guy telling you is probably a</p>
<p>clone yeah i wonder how</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actively</p>
<p>in use by the government that if if</p>
<p>your average person knew</p>
<p>about it would result in total</p>
<p>anarchy it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>axe body spray</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>it really is</p>
<p>the whole axe line</p>
<p>body sprays only for douchebags that&rsquo;s why they want to</p>
<p>track douchebag activity</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>thing when they step outside</p>
<p>of chimps when they do like medical studies on chimps</p>
<p>test out mascara on them and shit i</p>
<p>notice you&rsquo;re an old</p>
<p>spice guy there in the bathroom there by the way yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m an old spice guy or whatever is cheapest</p>
<p>yeah whatever gets a job</p>
<p>done and it has to be</p>
<p>white i need</p>
<p>white deodorant i don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>the blue kind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you go work</p>
<p>do you do the antiperspirant</p>
<p>yeah i do i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing for your body</p>
<p>i think i don&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry antiperspirant</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t i know i</p>
<p>stink sometimes but i don&rsquo;t mind</p>
<p>you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important to me what&rsquo;s important to me i don&rsquo;t clog my</p>
<p>pores up when they&rsquo;re trying to leak out sweat</p>
<p>if what is that</p>
<p>about you just</p>
<p>gumming up your pores so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>sweating them you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using some sort of fucking</p>
<p>nasty chemical that jacks your whole</p>
<p>system yeah</p>
<p>how many people</p>
<p>get armpit cancer if i got armpit cancer i&rsquo;d be like</p>
<p>thank god i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>first at something i&rsquo;m not scared of my sweat</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bother me i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sweaty all the time yeah but you</p>
<p>stink though i do</p>
<p>right yes that&rsquo;s the whole</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>problem once you</p>
<p>start working</p>
<p>smelling an a</p>
<p>bodies i&rsquo;m so hairy because my</p>
<p>chest is hairy too so it all funks in there</p>
<p>and it gets</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s good to get some sort of a bacteria</p>
<p>like dad had a</p>
<p>with your shirt off</p>
<p>not that bad</p>
<p>i shave it a lot of times too</p>
<p>because otherwise</p>
<p>starts itching and it gets caught in jujutsu</p>
<p>people pull your</p>
<p>chest hair so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t wear deodorant but you do shave your chest</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sexy as fuck you&rsquo;re just dude</p>
<p>when i when i shave my</p>
<p>chest man i look at myself in the man like damn</p>
<p>ready for the french riviera joe</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t shave my legs though</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve no excuse to shave my legs</p>
<p>i know some dudes who do because it gets you out of</p>
<p>submissions</p>
<p>gets you out of</p>
<p>submissions easier jujutsu guys want</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still hardcore</p>
<p>into that yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s fun yeah what do you</p>
<p>think this was a kraft maga the</p>
<p>the israeli</p>
<p>fighting technique well i</p>
<p>think if you wanted to just</p>
<p>learn it for</p>
<p>self defense</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>system because what they do is they incorporate</p>
<p>a lot of the best techniques in ground fighting</p>
<p>and they incorporate a lot of the best techniques to</p>
<p>stand up and for someone just looking to defend</p>
<p>themselves it gives you a pretty comprehensive view of</p>
<p>mixed of martial arts in</p>
<p>general you look it up on youtube man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like half the</p>
<p>videos are like how to get out of a gun situation</p>
<p>and half of them are like</p>
<p>legit guys who are fast the other half</p>
<p>would wind up dead</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s true but you know what at</p>
<p>least you have a chance you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>if you have an idea of what to do</p>
<p>and someone is trying to</p>
<p>get you with a gun most likely they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking</p>
<p>shoot you right</p>
<p>but at least you</p>
<p>have some sort of an idea if an opportunity presents</p>
<p>it yeah take control of it or not</p>
<p>right yeah i mean like that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>whole idea of martial arts is</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to beat people up you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to</p>
<p>fight it&rsquo;s like at</p>
<p>least you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>know what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like the scariest thing</p>
<p>about any sort of an altercation is</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t know how to defend</p>
<p>yourself you don&rsquo;t know what to do and i&rsquo;ve seen guys</p>
<p>i saw this guy get</p>
<p>knocked the fuck out once and it was</p>
<p>crazy talking</p>
<p>about like it was</p>
<p>a bar yeah yeah it was a bar and they got into a fight</p>
<p>and as they got into a fight</p>
<p>one guy was just</p>
<p>he just went into a full panic</p>
<p>and was just</p>
<p>swinging his hands</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t even making like a girl</p>
<p>yes yes full panic</p>
<p>swinging his hands</p>
<p>and a car got in</p>
<p>front of me</p>
<p>and as the car got in</p>
<p>front because</p>
<p>people were trying to get out of this parking lot</p>
<p>while this fight was going on</p>
<p>and as the car got in</p>
<p>front of me as the car passed</p>
<p>he was out cold on the ground</p>
<p>flattened out</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it was first</p>
<p>but there was a look in his eyes of complete</p>
<p>total panic</p>
<p>he had no idea what to do</p>
<p>he was locked into this situation so</p>
<p>it was on sunset</p>
<p>you understand i mean you doing what you do with</p>
<p>mma and everything and being involved in the</p>
<p>scene like and</p>
<p>i went to my</p>
<p>first mma fight</p>
<p>the one in charlotte right</p>
<p>sitting there</p>
<p>watching ufc and i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen it</p>
<p>on at bars and i&rsquo;m like okay this is cool and seeing</p>
<p>it in person getting a huge amount of respect for the</p>
<p>fighters and how</p>
<p>tremendous athletes</p>
<p>these guys are right but</p>
<p>whenever i you know</p>
<p>living in raleigh and seeing bar</p>
<p>fights which</p>
<p>break out in a regular basis</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not as bad as boston by the way we need to talk</p>
<p>about boston</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s the land of savages</p>
<p>12 30 hits of the</p>
<p>witching hour</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>many ugly angry</p>
<p>women and dudes are</p>
<p>pissed the sea hags man</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get there but</p>
<p>whenever i see</p>
<p>a fight in real life dude</p>
<p>unless the two guys who are</p>
<p>scrappers man you see</p>
<p>the one guy who picks a fight with</p>
<p>this guy doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really ugly shit man yeah you see act somebody actually</p>
<p>legitimately get hit and beaten up like that before the</p>
<p>staff and get to him that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty fucked up when someone knows how to</p>
<p>fight and the</p>
<p>other person</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t i try to make friends with the biggest</p>
<p>motherfuckers in town that&rsquo;s good so</p>
<p>hide behind people man</p>
<p>notice notice when the shit shits</p>
<p>about to hit the fan and know</p>
<p>where the door is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all important you can</p>
<p>smell it man</p>
<p>yeah and the thing</p>
<p>about someone who does</p>
<p>train in martial</p>
<p>arts most of the time you don&rsquo;t want to fight</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not the same</p>
<p>thing anymore</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a good</p>
<p>bouncer you know to defuse the situation</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re not looking to</p>
<p>crack skulls well it&rsquo;s not just that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not attractive</p>
<p>you know for</p>
<p>some guys the idea of beating someone&rsquo;s ass is like</p>
<p>attractive but</p>
<p>when you do martial arts all the time it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>attractive at all</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a</p>
<p>thing to do it seems like</p>
<p>what you wanna do is</p>
<p>avoid all that this is</p>
<p>stupid this</p>
<p>could get you can get hurt</p>
<p>like you don&rsquo;t have any need to</p>
<p>prove yourself physically</p>
<p>where a lot of people do</p>
<p>and unfortunately sometimes they just try to bluff</p>
<p>you know and they get called out on it</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know what to do they&rsquo;re already at step</p>
<p>nine they don&rsquo;t know how they got there because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drunk right</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>know and then they say why</p>
<p>would i fucking hit this guy</p>
<p>and they go to take a</p>
<p>swing and the horror upon horrors</p>
<p>is when you</p>
<p>throw a punch</p>
<p>at a guy and he moves like he actually knows how to</p>
<p>fight and he&rsquo;s sober</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re fucked</p>
<p>cause then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drunk and you did a douchebag</p>
<p>thing and some guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna light you up</p>
<p>but next thing you know you&rsquo;re on the side</p>
<p>of the street</p>
<p>blade and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bleeding from my</p>
<p>experience i mean there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>gonna be assholes that do</p>
<p>martial arts like there&rsquo;s assholes that do everything</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a much much</p>
<p>smaller number</p>
<p>so the odds of someone who wants to</p>
<p>fight actually being a martial artist</p>
<p>most of the</p>
<p>time they&rsquo;re not it&rsquo;s a big misconception like</p>
<p>these guys that are</p>
<p>fighting george cpr</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like one of the nicest</p>
<p>fucking guys you&rsquo;re ever gonna meet</p>
<p>and even josh</p>
<p>costcheck the guy who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting him this weekend</p>
<p>fucking great guy if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fighting i mean he likes to talk</p>
<p>a lot of shit and likes to like get inside guys heads</p>
<p>but a lot of that&rsquo;s pre</p>
<p>fight hype like outside of that is a very nice</p>
<p>a lot of those guys beat the shit out of each</p>
<p>other and then</p>
<p>they just the end they&rsquo;re just kind of like</p>
<p>yeah cause it&rsquo;s a mutually kind of assumed destruction</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re like okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going into this it&rsquo;s my profession</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s that and some guys get real</p>
<p>caught up in the shit talking and some guys</p>
<p>some guys they</p>
<p>drop it as soon as the</p>
<p>fight&rsquo;s over and you know you see them they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go out and have beers and shit it&rsquo;s like you know look</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>amount of stress involved this person&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>target there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be some animosity</p>
<p>you know but for the most</p>
<p>part they&rsquo;d like resolve it way better than boxers do</p>
<p>yeah you know boxers seem to be for the</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what it is</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like more douchebags in the boxing community i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not i&rsquo;m not exactly sure about</p>
<p>mma when it was like five</p>
<p>eight years ago and it was</p>
<p>consider that niche</p>
<p>thing and that&rsquo;s always the way with any sort</p>
<p>of new sport</p>
<p>right look at</p>
<p>snowboarding and yeah</p>
<p>that was all</p>
<p>the skiers look down i&rsquo;m like that&rsquo;s a joke that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never gonna be big now snowboarding is</p>
<p>freaking huge</p>
<p>right it happens with so many different sports</p>
<p>right well when i was</p>
<p>first involved in mma</p>
<p>it was almost</p>
<p>like telling people that i was involved in porn</p>
<p>really like yeah because i was working on news</p>
<p>radio right</p>
<p>and and by the</p>
<p>way i&rsquo;m not the only one who said this dana</p>
<p>white said the</p>
<p>exact same thing</p>
<p>he said the</p>
<p>exact he had the</p>
<p>exact same feeling you feel like you&rsquo;re doing something</p>
<p>sleazy i say</p>
<p>video games dude</p>
<p>no no way dude</p>
<p>when i was okay this is</p>
<p>my story i was on news</p>
<p>radio and i</p>
<p>started doing the backstage</p>
<p>anniversary the ufc</p>
<p>and this was 1997</p>
<p>so this is like we were in augusta georgia</p>
<p>and doth in alabama and</p>
<p>places like that and i</p>
<p>would tell them that i was off to go do commentary</p>
<p>for cage fighting they</p>
<p>would look at me like what the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you like this</p>
<p>is terrible for your career</p>
<p>you want people to know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>commentating on cage</p>
<p>fighting you know</p>
<p>it was almost</p>
<p>like i was doing girls gone wild or something</p>
<p>the video game analogy though</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s not a one to one</p>
<p>but at the same time it was one of the situations like</p>
<p>10 15 years ago</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>you want to do that it&rsquo;s like oh that&rsquo;s cute</p>
<p>my little son plays that in the basement right</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things you look at</p>
<p>everything from the 360 to the wii</p>
<p>to natal and oh i</p>
<p>see what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>right but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a negative connotation does it not it ever</p>
<p>used to now it&rsquo;s the coolest fucking job</p>
<p>it was used to it</p>
<p>was more of a frivolous connotation not a negative yeah</p>
<p>no it wasn&rsquo;t negative it was more of a</p>
<p>dismissive okay you run</p>
<p>along little</p>
<p>billy with your little</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>thing because he used to play pong</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>but now there&rsquo;s games like call of duty that make more</p>
<p>money way more than avatar and that like</p>
<p>that needs to sink into people&rsquo;s head they go it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>difference of a 60</p>
<p>day one versus you</p>
<p>know 10 bucks</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>it takes you know not as many people to do it</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>getting so good at</p>
<p>building up the hype for</p>
<p>these midnight launches</p>
<p>for all this right</p>
<p>i mean the big</p>
<p>issue right now is how much of that</p>
<p>money you think the actual developers are seeing</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>not necessarily a lot there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy</p>
<p>about call of duty i don&rsquo;t know if you</p>
<p>heard the whole</p>
<p>thing no please tell me</p>
<p>so basically the call of duty guys originally were</p>
<p>these guys from infinity ward</p>
<p>and jason and</p>
<p>vince real good guys and they</p>
<p>had originally</p>
<p>built this brand</p>
<p>after working on</p>
<p>medal of honor because they</p>
<p>built up medal of honor</p>
<p>and then that didn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>out for a number of reasons you can look all this up</p>
<p>they built the call of duty</p>
<p>brand up and then</p>
<p>basically modern</p>
<p>warfare hit</p>
<p>made a ton of money they</p>
<p>basically didn&rsquo;t see much of it and then they were like</p>
<p>screw you we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go do our old</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s a very controversial</p>
<p>thing with a lot of lawsuits and</p>
<p>everything like that</p>
<p>i just i stand on the site</p>
<p>generally of</p>
<p>the developers because i believe in developers</p>
<p>rights i believe paying people what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worth and when you create a</p>
<p>multi million dollar to potentially billion dollar</p>
<p>brand you deserve to be paid for it</p>
<p>right so the</p>
<p>issue is that</p>
<p>the people that finance it are getting the</p>
<p>majority of the</p>
<p>money the people</p>
<p>that are the</p>
<p>large studio</p>
<p>activision basically from what i can tell</p>
<p>again this is</p>
<p>second hand knowledge you</p>
<p>know the guys</p>
<p>basically did not feel that they were paid what</p>
<p>they were worth for because when they have contracts</p>
<p>once your studio</p>
<p>is purchased and you&rsquo;re part of a larger conglomerate</p>
<p>your game can make a billion dollars and they</p>
<p>could just give your studio</p>
<p>half a million to be like fine we own you like whatever</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t know what the numbers are but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re increasingly seeing in the</p>
<p>video game industry</p>
<p>people getting a lot of representation</p>
<p>people getting</p>
<p>agents people</p>
<p>getting proper accountants and lawyers</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actually negotiating this sort of thing so</p>
<p>people like warren spector who created deus</p>
<p>ex people like ken</p>
<p>levine who created bioshock</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>deals now they&rsquo;re making amazing games and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna make sure that they and their</p>
<p>staff are taking good care of</p>
<p>right i remember back in the day</p>
<p>when john romero</p>
<p>as how it was</p>
<p>broke off from id software and that was like the</p>
<p>first drama</p>
<p>in the game community</p>
<p>and this guy john romero who&rsquo;s the game designer</p>
<p>splits from this guy</p>
<p>john carmack</p>
<p>who is this fucking</p>
<p>super genius from another planet</p>
<p>lizard guy yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>this is very</p>
<p>few dudes when i&rsquo;m around them i get intimidated yeah</p>
<p>like when i&rsquo;m talking to john</p>
<p>carmack i&rsquo;m like why am i even talking yeah well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about talking</p>
<p>what i have to say to this guy did you ever</p>
<p>fucking alien yeah</p>
<p>this whole like</p>
<p>one in a billion type of personality</p>
<p>super genius alien code</p>
<p>right like it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>on another level than all of us and carmack</p>
<p>would sit in</p>
<p>front of the</p>
<p>computer for people who don&rsquo;t know who he is</p>
<p>16 hours a day code</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would go make rockets yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a rocket</p>
<p>scientist in his spare time</p>
<p>and he was involved in the x</p>
<p>prize he was like trying to win the x</p>
<p>prize yeah that&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>hobby and when he wasn&rsquo;t doing that he was</p>
<p>turbo charging ferraris</p>
<p>building turbochargers</p>
<p>for ferraris that&rsquo;s a big no no by the way</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like buying a mona lisa and then just</p>
<p>painting over it right</p>
<p>i guess but he just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have no reverence for any</p>
<p>objects he&rsquo;s like fuck you he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna upgrade this but he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>alien well the</p>
<p>rumor was that like</p>
<p>after he started doing that</p>
<p>that ferrari kind of was like dude what are you come on</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>undermining all of our engineers here</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>new ferrari stop fucking with our shit</p>
<p>he was making like</p>
<p>these 12 000</p>
<p>horsepower ferraris you know</p>
<p>fucking nuclear</p>
<p>energy die yeah oh</p>
<p>for sure well he</p>
<p>apparently was</p>
<p>a nutty thrill seeker</p>
<p>he used to really like to go really fast which</p>
<p>is yeah what happened was he not</p>
<p>expect he left id software the guys to do</p>
<p>right so this john romero guy to get back to the</p>
<p>story this john</p>
<p>romero guy was like the playboy character it was like</p>
<p>a rock star</p>
<p>and you know and then they left and what was that</p>
<p>crazy game that they came out with</p>
<p>afterwards when</p>
<p>they did an acronyx and dai katana</p>
<p>guy katana that was the one</p>
<p>so he leaves</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s like sort of a cult of personality</p>
<p>thing oh yeah you know and it was the big debate was</p>
<p>you know who was</p>
<p>the most important is it the game</p>
<p>designers the guy with the vision or is it the coder</p>
<p>and how easy</p>
<p>it is it to actually design the games</p>
<p>the game designers often the</p>
<p>chaos and the programmer or producers usually the order</p>
<p>yeah right it&rsquo;s a combination of</p>
<p>those two personnel it&rsquo;s like saying</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best part of the band is it the singers and</p>
<p>the drummers</p>
<p>and if you get the singer who</p>
<p>could be on</p>
<p>stage would be charismatic you know you get</p>
<p>david lee roth but you don&rsquo;t have any van</p>
<p>halen backing him up</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>right you don&rsquo;t have the magic</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>perfect example it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t balance</p>
<p>right yeah he wasn&rsquo;t van</p>
<p>halen on his own</p>
<p>yeah on his own he was just</p>
<p>david lee robert</p>
<p>well he&rsquo;s gone on here</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing some cool</p>
<p>stuff now man he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great guy i&rsquo;ve met him i met him at the</p>
<p>comic store it was one of the</p>
<p>fucking coolest celebrity meetings i&rsquo;ve ever had ever</p>
<p>but my point was that you know</p>
<p>as a group you know</p>
<p>those guys created</p>
<p>some pretty fucking dope games doom</p>
<p>you know doom they created as a group</p>
<p>and the idea was that it was all disguise</p>
<p>so this guy</p>
<p>leaves and he gets this</p>
<p>giant fucking deal is john romero</p>
<p>did you visit the</p>
<p>dallas office no but i</p>
<p>heard it was insane i</p>
<p>heard it was like</p>
<p>the top floor with</p>
<p>unbelievable views just stupid</p>
<p>crazy overhead</p>
<p>right this is legendary gaming history you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah well this is how much of a dork i am</p>
<p>about this shit</p>
<p>and he gets</p>
<p>crazy crazy</p>
<p>money and then to just lazy as fuck</p>
<p>and it is barely working man</p>
<p>what would happen</p>
<p>this game like</p>
<p>takes forever to</p>
<p>come out it comes out all wonky and shit and you walk</p>
<p>through walls</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an abbreviated version man but i mean the</p>
<p>thing is he assembled the team so fucking fast</p>
<p>and try to be so ambitious so</p>
<p>quick and that was with eidos&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>this is basically</p>
<p>the lara croft tomb raider paying for this</p>
<p>right and so once you</p>
<p>build a team that</p>
<p>quickly like you can&rsquo;t just overnight assemble a</p>
<p>bunch of people like in hollywood and have magic yeah</p>
<p>right and so half</p>
<p>not half but a good percentage</p>
<p>of the guys i work with my fucking art director</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s this amazingly talented awesome guy</p>
<p>bled out of the eyeballs to ship daikatana</p>
<p>and he went to work for romero</p>
<p>cause he thought</p>
<p>romero was a cool guy</p>
<p>he still tells me</p>
<p>stories about having</p>
<p>panic attacks working in</p>
<p>dallas and how he almost killed himself</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>and so like i always look at that people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize how much you guys work dude it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you look around a room right</p>
<p>every little bit somebody has to</p>
<p>work and build</p>
<p>every last little bit of it but</p>
<p>we visited you and you were talking</p>
<p>about when crunch time comes and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>right at the end and everybody&rsquo;s like basically</p>
<p>sleeping at the office</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all you</p>
<p>do is you work we all day it&rsquo;s gotten better than that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve figured out how to</p>
<p>make games better now like you get a producer who knows</p>
<p>his shit and it&rsquo;s kind of like okay we&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>gonna all work really hard hope it turns out</p>
<p>great we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna actually have a plan</p>
<p>right so if you say when it&rsquo;s done that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you really know what game you&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>right same time you need</p>
<p>to have a little bit of wiggle room because it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>definable process</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re penning for gold you&rsquo;re trying it&rsquo;s comedy</p>
<p>like comedy you iterate</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s so comprehensive though i mean people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what goes into making a game</p>
<p>that just the amount of</p>
<p>effort i remember we were exhausted leaving</p>
<p>thinking about the</p>
<p>hours that you</p>
<p>guys work yeah but i remember what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about remember</p>
<p>but dude you can&rsquo;t burn through people that much</p>
<p>right you can</p>
<p>maybe get with a few crunches like that so we&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>point where we&rsquo;ll do maybe</p>
<p>ten hours a day</p>
<p>twelve tops five days a week tops and then we</p>
<p>we call it we&rsquo;re like dude if we just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not worth that</p>
<p>smart you know because</p>
<p>people in the industry</p>
<p>over forty dude yeah</p>
<p>they just get</p>
<p>fried right yeah</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>about that daikatana</p>
<p>thing though even though it was like</p>
<p>a long time it was a fun game to play man deathmatch</p>
<p>deathmatch was</p>
<p>fun on it they had some cool the cool rocket</p>
<p>there was a crazy</p>
<p>weird rocket launcher</p>
<p>they had a shotgun</p>
<p>that had like 18 barrels or something like that yeah</p>
<p>they had some cool shit</p>
<p>romero was supposedly like he was into</p>
<p>first person</p>
<p>shooters and</p>
<p>deathmatch came</p>
<p>it was him and carmack and that</p>
<p>whole crew that just</p>
<p>the genre it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>lessons i tell the guys if you have a new camera angle</p>
<p>you can create a whole new</p>
<p>genre the first</p>
<p>quake was a fucking masterpiece for like</p>
<p>deathmatch brian</p>
<p>says you still hung up on it</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m still hung up on all games</p>
<p>but not really</p>
<p>quick to quick to</p>
<p>never really got me</p>
<p>quake one dude the only</p>
<p>thing that got me about</p>
<p>quake ii was the railgun that was very key because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when accuracy became very important</p>
<p>so was your problem</p>
<p>with quake ii</p>
<p>they actually balanced the weapons</p>
<p>no no i just didn&rsquo;t like the way it</p>
<p>it felt it just didn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>as good it wasn&rsquo;t as fast paced it was a little slower</p>
<p>whereas quake one you can move much quicker</p>
<p>it was much more like chaotic he</p>
<p>plays the numbers</p>
<p>slowed it down</p>
<p>it has to be</p>
<p>point seven</p>
<p>seconds and less you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s just my what it is is that i just really love</p>
<p>deathmatch that&rsquo;s what i really love that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>i really love that&rsquo;s all i playing call of duty yeah</p>
<p>team deathmatch</p>
<p>like anytime it comes up with any sort of</p>
<p>domination or ctf</p>
<p>mike i just want to</p>
<p>shoot people how do you feel</p>
<p>about those</p>
<p>things that hook up to a console and give you</p>
<p>a mouse and a keyboard are those good</p>
<p>i mean they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cool and all but do</p>
<p>you i mean the</p>
<p>thing about halo is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll no they</p>
<p>built the game of halo for that dual</p>
<p>stick controller</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re a pc guy</p>
<p>is used to that</p>
<p>level of accuracy it feels like you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>drunkenly using like a rubber hose to a</p>
<p>car but if you</p>
<p>build a game for it</p>
<p>it can work and that&rsquo;s what halo</p>
<p>did goldeneye</p>
<p>did it before that but you look at halo they</p>
<p>basically introduced</p>
<p>genre that was new to a whole</p>
<p>generation of kids i have this</p>
<p>whole 10 year role</p>
<p>where like the kids who played halo</p>
<p>most of them many of them didn&rsquo;t play a lot of quake</p>
<p>because they were like wait what is this new xbox</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;m gonna play this and then</p>
<p>they become hooked</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we talk</p>
<p>about vampires</p>
<p>on the way over it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>okay well all</p>
<p>these kids who love twilight don&rsquo;t know what buffy the</p>
<p>vampire slayer is</p>
<p>right so sad so but if you wait 10 years</p>
<p>right your kid who liked buffy the</p>
<p>vampire slayer</p>
<p>or your person who likes twilight</p>
<p>they were what like you know</p>
<p>six when buffy came out now they&rsquo;re 16</p>
<p>and so they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that so you can</p>
<p>basically wait</p>
<p>every 10 years</p>
<p>and find something that was old and make it new</p>
<p>and then if you can introduce it with new</p>
<p>technology you</p>
<p>might be good to go yeah</p>
<p>for people that don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>those hand controllers the consoles</p>
<p>when you have a console you have like an xbox or</p>
<p>playstation</p>
<p>what they are</p>
<p>most people are</p>
<p>listening on</p>
<p>itunes this ain&rsquo;t helping okay he&rsquo;s holding one up</p>
<p>but they have a</p>
<p>bunch of buttons on it and</p>
<p>with pcs when you play with a computer</p>
<p>when you play online especially</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using is a keyboard and a</p>
<p>mouse and what it is is</p>
<p>for whatever reason the keyboard and the</p>
<p>mouse you can</p>
<p>just control it better you&rsquo;re far more accurate</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re accurate with the keyboard as</p>
<p>far as your movement having four very specific buttons</p>
<p>right where your fingers are</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re much more accurate with your hand</p>
<p>as far as like aiming</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where it came into play with</p>
<p>games like quake</p>
<p>it was like aim</p>
<p>especially when the railgun</p>
<p>came about aim became very very important</p>
<p>so how do they optimize</p>
<p>these games for</p>
<p>these controllers do they have</p>
<p>auto aim or something</p>
<p>where you get</p>
<p>close you&rsquo;re in the neighborhood of it a little bit of</p>
<p>auto aim man</p>
<p>one of the things that halo did was they</p>
<p>kind of introduced this idea of friction and adhesion</p>
<p>what you do is if you</p>
<p>when you move</p>
<p>your console kind of</p>
<p>stick over the enemy</p>
<p>the game actually slows down a little bit like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like oh you want to hit him don&rsquo;t you and then</p>
<p>it provides a little bit of that kind of assistance</p>
<p>right that would</p>
<p>drive me crazy</p>
<p>whole generation loves it right now</p>
<p>those fucks</p>
<p>those lazy cunts</p>
<p>mark that&rsquo;s what it is they don&rsquo;t even want to aim</p>
<p>these fucking kids today</p>
<p>self righteous</p>
<p>entitled children</p>
<p>back when we were</p>
<p>kids we we had a</p>
<p>fucking aim it was a</p>
<p>pixel hunt dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it was</p>
<p>right yeah your</p>
<p>crosshair was this one</p>
<p>pixel and you had to</p>
<p>shoot that guy&rsquo;s itty bitty head across the map yeah</p>
<p>except for in</p>
<p>quake one where you had to just hit him</p>
<p>with a rocket launcher that had a radius of half a mile</p>
<p>well that was the cool</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>quake ii is a lot of people</p>
<p>would put their own</p>
<p>crosshairs in they</p>
<p>would build</p>
<p>their own crosshairs</p>
<p>quick three they came out of the box like a</p>
<p>bunch of cool ones yeah</p>
<p>like figure out what was the best for you</p>
<p>like i would have different ones</p>
<p>for the railgun different ones for the rocket launcher</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s all customization</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s insanity is what it is like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a constant subject on this fucking site dude trust</p>
<p>you have a whole</p>
<p>generation of whatever millions and</p>
<p>millions of kids that are perfectly fine with the two</p>
<p>sticks and yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna grow up pussies</p>
<p>we are we are</p>
<p>entering what i like to say we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>entering into the feedbackless</p>
<p>generation right</p>
<p>those kids growing up with</p>
<p>those consoles</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>last the fall of rome this is when they were getting</p>
<p>drunk and thrown up and trying to</p>
<p>get more food in</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s what it is gluttony</p>
<p>look can&rsquo;t even touch the</p>
<p>game joe look at</p>
<p>touchscreens look at</p>
<p>touchscreens look at connect</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting to a</p>
<p>point where people don&rsquo;t need buttons right now</p>
<p>um yeah i hear you</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s me is that what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen is it</p>
<p>gonna be like aiming with your fingers and shit like</p>
<p>pointing where you want to go</p>
<p>dude the key is</p>
<p>microsoft thing is</p>
<p>right isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>oh that&rsquo;s yeah that&rsquo;s a what is that called connect man</p>
<p>connect yeah you don&rsquo;t need a controller</p>
<p>and you stand in</p>
<p>front of it and move around i guess</p>
<p>have you heard much</p>
<p>about this this is now</p>
<p>not that much</p>
<p>i know this is</p>
<p>going to trip you out</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a camera</p>
<p>that can track your body movements</p>
<p>without anything on you you&rsquo;ve seen the motion capture</p>
<p>setups right you know the</p>
<p>tiger wood setup</p>
<p>where it wears a spandex and all that</p>
<p>this is a very</p>
<p>light version of that</p>
<p>where you just</p>
<p>stand in front of the tv</p>
<p>and it can procedurally form your</p>
<p>skeleton and then track that</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a dance game</p>
<p>dance central</p>
<p>which is a ton of fun i was playing with my</p>
<p>niece over the holidays</p>
<p>you literally just</p>
<p>dance right in</p>
<p>front of it it</p>
<p>tracks your movement it can</p>
<p>judge your score</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where it gets</p>
<p>weird there&rsquo;s a vo</p>
<p>like a microphone on it</p>
<p>so it can do</p>
<p>voice recognition</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got facial recognition on it</p>
<p>so once you do the facial recognition</p>
<p>thing which</p>
<p>makes you stay out of the room to kind of</p>
<p>build an aggregate of your face</p>
<p>you then can just walk in the room and it goes why</p>
<p>hello cliff</p>
<p>oh jesus fucking christ</p>
<p>i smoke too much weed for that dude i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>my computer talking</p>
<p>to me you know what i want to see i want to see imax</p>
<p>movies screens</p>
<p>where you walk in and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re all sitting there</p>
<p>in the video game so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like 500 people</p>
<p>all joining in playing this huge</p>
<p>video game in</p>
<p>front of you i told</p>
<p>you about heffron</p>
<p>right i told you</p>
<p>about heffron doing</p>
<p>stand up yeah</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>my friend john heffron has been doing</p>
<p>these conference</p>
<p>stand up things</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>front of it some new technology</p>
<p>where they get him in a room</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got all</p>
<p>these screens in</p>
<p>front of them</p>
<p>and they see him and he sees them live and he does</p>
<p>stand up really he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s doing a desk in</p>
<p>front of like all</p>
<p>these monitors</p>
<p>so he gets to see the reaction like there yeah</p>
<p>yeah yes two way</p>
<p>video so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching their reaction they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching him live</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s performing on</p>
<p>stage but he&rsquo;s nowhere near them</p>
<p>which is the shit i</p>
<p>would love that</p>
<p>if i could do shows from my</p>
<p>house and not have to</p>
<p>travel all the time that</p>
<p>would be so i mean you can</p>
<p>judge people&rsquo;s reactions</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right there yeah talking</p>
<p>about iteration</p>
<p>right and how much</p>
<p>we pan for gold and we try and find fun and we fail a</p>
<p>bunch before we figure out what it is talk about</p>
<p>jerry seinfeld&rsquo;s comedian</p>
<p>how much comedy</p>
<p>they go to the little dive bars and they</p>
<p>do a surprise appearance and they just bomb</p>
<p>and then they figure out okay this</p>
<p>joke worked that one didn&rsquo;t work this one did right</p>
<p>we find it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing with game development</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve known people in the restaurant business</p>
<p>that try new menus they figure out what works and</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s all iteration</p>
<p>very few people ever actually nail it</p>
<p>right the first time</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>early and fell</p>
<p>often which i</p>
<p>found is the key to so many instances of</p>
<p>success in life right</p>
<p>well you failed and you find out what you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>about what failed</p>
<p>yep you know and that&rsquo;s how you</p>
<p>learn absolutely</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>learn what you do and don&rsquo;t like and when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>something complicated there&rsquo;s a lot of failure involved</p>
<p>for sure the</p>
<p>keyboard to</p>
<p>mouse man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still relevant but</p>
<p>a lot it&rsquo;s the market</p>
<p>split man between</p>
<p>iphone between ds between</p>
<p>consoles i think</p>
<p>see no controller is very important i think</p>
<p>like making it so it</p>
<p>could be you</p>
<p>could do just sit there and do that</p>
<p>what i don&rsquo;t like though is when</p>
<p>a lot of times i just want to sit back and play a</p>
<p>video game in bed or on you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to get up and run</p>
<p>around come on</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just trying to run through the forest i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to like</p>
<p>sweat you know you just want</p>
<p>you want to</p>
<p>lay back and just sit there the controller just play</p>
<p>yeah right you don&rsquo;t have to jump around like an</p>
<p>idiot right</p>
<p>i could say</p>
<p>here go like this though like tron</p>
<p>style just move my hands like do do i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going through</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>any type stuff like</p>
<p>minority report</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be able to just kind</p>
<p>of like that so you don&rsquo;t have to like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>percentage of person a lot of them out there</p>
<p>especially girls</p>
<p>if you hand them a current console controller</p>
<p>they act like you handed them a flaming bag of dog shit</p>
<p>really like</p>
<p>really i&rsquo;m supposed to use this for what like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna play this and</p>
<p>granted there are some</p>
<p>exceptions but most people</p>
<p>parents who you hanging out with cliffy b</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your old girl</p>
<p>voice that sounds</p>
<p>annoying that&rsquo;s your old</p>
<p>girl that&rsquo;s your girl</p>
<p>i learned that by</p>
<p>watching youtube</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s your becky</p>
<p>voice oh my god yeah exactly</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re such an asshole you just play games</p>
<p>we have this</p>
<p>whole theory that there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>type of girl that somehow gets that</p>
<p>voice pre loaded into her with that bubble writing i</p>
<p>think they just imitate everybody else it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>why would anybody have</p>
<p>that fucking horrible boston accent yeah why because a</p>
<p>bunch of other people have and they just imitate it</p>
<p>still it&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>still miss it though dude</p>
<p>do you really how dare you</p>
<p>i dude i had a</p>
<p>great time growing</p>

<p>certain sections of the</p>
<p>northeast that just kind of</p>
<p>take something out of you</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the diet</p>

<p>tiredness that kind of</p>
<p>creeps in man i don&rsquo;t know what it is so weather</p>

<p>months it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna suck to be outside</p>
<p>for four months you grew up with it</p>
<p>right like i grew up</p>
<p>and i do a paper</p>
<p>route as a kid right</p>
<p>me too and they deliver it</p>
<p>and they deliver it in like</p>
<p>they deliver the</p>
<p>papers in november the snow</p>

<p>m to do my paper</p>
<p>route and they</p>
<p>all be plowed over and</p>

<p>papers from march</p>
<p>like a time capsule</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m sitting here</p>
<p>going is this how it is</p>
<p>cause my dad</p>
<p>loved him dearly but he was</p>
<p>super cheap</p>

<p>would freeze yep</p>
<p>so my dad had like this opening</p>
<p>underneath the</p>
<p>floor in the basement and he</p>
<p>would have to lift up this opening</p>
<p>and be sitting</p>
<p>there with a fucking hair dryer before anybody</p>
<p>could take a shower yeah</p>
<p>it was brutality it was retarded we grew</p>
<p>my dad decided one year he was</p>
<p>gonna buy a coal</p>

<p>gonna like take care of all this right</p>
<p>so he gets it installed and</p>
<p>literally like</p>
<p>one folly is two</p>
<p>tons of coal</p>
<p>put in the basement</p>
<p>right and we</p>
<p>literally have to go down there with a hopper</p>
<p>bring it up there and you have to hold your breath</p>
<p>otherwise you get</p>
<p>black long basically</p>
<p>and we come up and</p>
<p>this thing heated</p>
<p>two square feet of the</p>
<p>whole house</p>
<p>so if you wanted</p>
<p>to stay warm you stayed in the living room and just</p>
<p>hovered right in</p>
<p>front of that thing</p>

<p>heard that&rsquo;s pretty awesome</p>
<p>too it sits</p>
<p>the end was a little</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t say that then i got nothing to look forward</p>
<p>to frank darabont</p>
<p>fired the entire writing staff whoa</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s the guy who did</p>
<p>shawshank redemption</p>
<p>green mile right</p>
<p>wow fired the</p>
<p>whole staff</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to find fucking good writers that one</p>
<p>write your shit you know</p>
<p>yeah good writers want to</p>
<p>write their own shit yeah well let&rsquo;s say well we</p>
<p>have had people</p>
<p>approach me they&rsquo;re like hey we&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>new ip and we want epic to make the game i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>dude we do our own</p>
<p>stuff man like we can either</p>
<p>create our own</p>
<p>thing like years or we</p>
<p>could do like the star trek the</p>
<p>movie video game</p>
<p>what is gonna happen</p>
<p>right right look</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna run inspiring</p>
<p>nobody gives a fuck</p>
<p>about those</p>
<p>stupid movie</p>
<p>video games there&rsquo;s the occasional</p>
<p>exception that&rsquo;s a good one</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s hard to make like superman</p>
<p>for the nintendo sixty four</p>
<p>game every et</p>
<p>for atari to my face you know that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>desert right</p>
<p>they actually oh yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the craziest story</p>
<p>urban legend you know that</p>
<p>story no it was the et the video game right and that</p>
<p>atari 2600 and they basically assumed it</p>
<p>would sell millions of copies and it sold like five</p>
<p>oh my god decided to like</p>
<p>bury out in the new mexico desert and they actually</p>
<p>still out there</p>
<p>they buried it buried it</p>
<p>why did bury it</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t know i guess they could didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find somebody</p>
<p>better than yeah</p>
<p>whatever disposal the economics</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a huge landfill filled with that game and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that many of them</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t actually know you can look it up and we what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>urban legend though</p>
<p>well people</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>urban legend but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually true no but what is the the number in the</p>
<p>urban legends</p>
<p>millions millions</p>
<p>because they hired some programmer</p>
<p>and had to make the game over the course of a</p>
<p>month like oh it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>license we can</p>
<p>print it will make</p>
<p>money right</p>
<p>no you actually</p>
<p>have to make a good game like the new call of duty</p>
<p>was done by the</p>
<p>second team</p>
<p>which previously had made a very</p>
<p>solid one a couple years ago and it had made</p>
<p>a one a few years ago that wasn&rsquo;t as good</p>
<p>but they have really stepped it up this new one at like</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t play the campaign man you did you play it much</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;ve never played it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true you</p>
<p>should give it a go i know you have dual analog</p>
<p>fear can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>you have to try</p>
<p>you have to at</p>
<p>least give in sometime what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen with all the</p>
<p>shooters are like most</p>
<p>of a fuck i</p>
<p>guess i&rsquo;ll play pool</p>
<p>you have a table</p>
<p>imagine going like</p>
<p>this and playing pool you don&rsquo;t even need a pool table</p>
<p>no no no you need a pool</p>
<p>table bro that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>whole game and</p>
<p>the whole game is what</p>

<p>feel the ball contact the q it&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>feel the ball</p>
<p>and how much</p>

<p>things man i&rsquo;m not skydiving</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not climbing rocks</p>
<p>i skydived once that was all i needed to do</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>great story</p>
<p>about skydiving</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t is</p>
<p>that we tandem</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve said it a couple</p>
<p>of times but it&rsquo;s an interesting story</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell it because he&rsquo;s told it</p>
<p>twice his father</p>
<p>had a person at work that was always saying you</p>
<p>should go skydiving with me i go skydiving i love it</p>
<p>she used to go all the time</p>
<p>well she fucking died really she fell out of a</p>
<p>plane and her shit didn&rsquo;t work and her</p>
<p>second shit caught up in her</p>
<p>first shit that didn&rsquo;t work that&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>she fucking went</p>
<p>screaming to the ground from 10 000 feet in the sky</p>
<p>and slammed into the</p>
<p>earth ending her time here yeah</p>
<p>fuck that noise</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not that afraid of</p>
<p>death i&rsquo;m afraid of the</p>
<p>screaming before it yeah</p>
<p>knowing the</p>
<p>words going down</p>
<p>four not even four minutes how much time does it take</p>
<p>terminal velocity 10 000 feet i&rsquo;m sure you</p>
<p>could just figure it out</p>
<p>380 miles an hour</p>
<p>three minutes</p>
<p>three minutes</p>
<p>of last terror</p>
<p>yeah look up gears of war mad</p>
<p>world on youtube</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it was nobody</p>
<p>it seems like a lot of somebody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna have it on youtube</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you can just assume</p>
<p>that if something&rsquo;s out there it&rsquo;s on youtube now but</p>
<p>dude if you ever</p>
<p>actually want to find try and find somebody&rsquo;s official</p>
<p>music video good fucking luck</p>
<p>yeah cause what</p>
<p>people do is they upload a</p>
<p>video where it&rsquo;s like hey here&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think a nicki minaj&rsquo;s new song</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>nicki minaj official</p>
<p>video you click on it and they use the</p>
<p>thumbnail to make it look like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>video and then some guys</p>
<p>talking about you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>can i actually find this freaking</p>
<p>thing like usually and then the one that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>has millions of hits</p>
<p>is like the last one to actually appear what&rsquo;s up dog</p>
<p>this is it right here</p>
<p>this is the ad</p>
<p>damn i want to watch it man</p>
<p>tell these fuckers to go on youtube</p>
<p>it changed the game for a lot of</p>
<p>video game advertising fuck yeah dude dude</p>
<p>but also you guys</p>
<p>raised the bar so high as far as the</p>
<p>graphic appearance of game</p>
<p>when we were in your</p>
<p>we came into your office</p>
<p>i guess it was like two years before this came out</p>
<p>and you guys were deep deep in development you had all</p>
<p>these crazy</p>
<p>models and all these</p>
<p>it was mostly just demonstrations of the</p>
<p>technology but</p>
<p>you know i remember</p>
<p>asking you like what are you guys up to like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to take a big fat shit on doom</p>
<p>did not confirm or</p>
<p>deny saying that and then i went and i</p>
<p>wow and i watched it and</p>
<p>especially the</p>
<p>light like a</p>
<p>lot of the shit you had was like demonstrations of</p>
<p>how the flash how</p>
<p>many years ago</p>
<p>was that it was wow</p>
<p>it says think</p>
<p>about where</p>
<p>technology is</p>
<p>gonna be in a few years man it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be insane like if if</p>
<p>my sony and</p>
<p>microsoft getting around actually making next</p>
<p>generation consoles like imagine what that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like like what is the bottleneck oh</p>
<p>i want it personally i want i want some avatar quality</p>
<p>stuff real time</p>
<p>yeah like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where imax imax</p>
<p>theater imagine that</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s no concert</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>together in a concert</p>
<p>would be no</p>
<p>need to have a real life</p>
<p>world of warcraft</p>
<p>every day everyone</p>
<p>would just plug into</p>
<p>their fucking computer and be some sort of an elf we</p>
<p>just wander through the forest</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d all turn into the</p>
<p>apartment on</p>
<p>south park with the wow episode it&rsquo;s fucking dangerous</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;re doing here because we make games more</p>
<p>exciting and way fucking cooler than real life</p>
<p>it gets weird it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a meta brain that&rsquo;s getting hooked up</p>
<p>right well the</p>
<p>scary thing is what happens when</p>
<p>we can download consciousness into a computer singular</p>
<p>option is to</p>
<p>i want a bliven fucking avatar man</p>
<p>you know well you know</p>
<p>about the whole</p>
<p>thing about the singularity</p>
<p>right sure we</p>
<p>break her as well and all that</p>
<p>right like it&rsquo;s i</p>
<p>i have a feeling it&rsquo;s within our lifetime</p>
<p>for those of you that don&rsquo;t know</p>

<p>thing i it might</p>
<p>be a manhattan</p>

<p>boards that we can</p>
<p>meet and greet</p>
<p>other people that</p>

<p>board out there for girls who like to get</p>
<p>their pussy licked by dogs have you guys seen</p>
<p>this shit that pirate bays doing they&rsquo;re like attacking</p>
<p>visa and master card</p>
<p>because this wikileaks</p>
<p>thing yeah they are</p>
<p>they are attack master</p>
<p>hard for not hosting it master</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>mastercard you can make a donation to wikileaks</p>
<p>right now they&rsquo;re all attacking them</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that this wikileaks</p>
<p>thing is fucking</p>
<p>fascinating for people who don&rsquo;t know and i just</p>
<p>found this out today</p>
<p>ari brought</p>
<p>it up yesterday or day before when we had the podcast</p>
<p>and then was it yesterday yesterday</p>
<p>i already brought up yesterday at the podcast and then</p>
<p>today i went online and</p>
<p>started looking it up</p>
<p>the guy was arrested for</p>
<p>surprise sex</p>
<p>hi buddy the guy was arrested because his condom broke</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t tell her</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the crime and</p>
<p>apparently it&rsquo;s only a</p>
<p>crime in sweden</p>
<p>like this is nuts like they had an interpol</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re trying to get this guy and</p>
<p>bring him in for questioning but this is the charge i</p>
<p>know girls who</p>
<p>try to get married that way</p>
<p>but this woman that he did it with the woman</p>
<p>he had sex with</p>
<p>this chick has published websites</p>
<p>with a detailed list of how to get revenge on men</p>
<p>yeah how to get</p>
<p>this is craziness</p>
<p>i mean the idea that this is enough to</p>
<p>bring this guy into justice</p>
<p>the internet</p>
<p>is gonna stop that man</p>
<p>some shit is</p>
<p>gonna go down from this it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be this</p>
<p>easy it&rsquo;s really hard for</p>
<p>any organized</p>
<p>system to fight because somebody somewhere is</p>
<p>going to be willing to host something</p>
<p>and how many</p>
<p>places you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to break down and shut it down it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>on one hand of like wow this is fascinating</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s information i shouldn&rsquo;t be seeing that</p>
<p>maybe some of it needs to be exposed and on the</p>
<p>other hand i&rsquo;m like this</p>
<p>is national fucking security man like we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about serious</p>
<p>stuff that could really</p>
<p>put people&rsquo;s lives at risk so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on the fence so that i can see both sides of it i</p>
<p>can see both sides of it too but i can&rsquo;t see defending</p>
<p>against it you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right or don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s wrong but i can&rsquo;t see stopping it</p>
<p>from happening when you fuck with people that are that</p>
<p>powerful they</p>
<p>find some sort of way to get to you</p>
<p>i know but that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>about this is how</p>
<p>transparent it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredibly</p>
<p>transparent</p>
<p>that all of a</p>
<p>sudden this</p>
<p>woman who by the way has cia ties</p>
<p>follow my twitter just go to joe rogan there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of things that i tweeted</p>
<p>today when i started</p>
<p>researching</p>
<p>about it and i&rsquo;m not talking</p>
<p>about i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about like cnn</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>legit news sources and they&rsquo;re showing</p>
<p>how the connections are</p>
<p>what this guy is actually being</p>
<p>arrested for it&rsquo;s a fascinating thing man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re arresting him for having sex with no condom</p>
<p>this is consensual sex this is</p>
<p>not rape it&rsquo;s not assault</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s craziness</p>
<p>and this is something that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interpol</p>
<p>warning for him</p>
<p>searching for him all over the</p>
<p>place for having sex now you got</p>
<p>extra down oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s insane</p>
<p>did he did he get a shot from london to</p>
<p>sweden yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s craziness</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>shocked how</p>
<p>transparent these</p>
<p>things didn&rsquo;t happen sooner i remember sitting there</p>
<p>and i had a friend right</p>
<p>about the time we were working on unreal one this is</p>
<p>about 97 and i went over to his</p>
<p>house and he</p>
<p>was downloading like full high quality like hollywood</p>
<p>movies off of a website and this was 97</p>
<p>wow i&rsquo;m sitting here going</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s like bit torrent</p>
<p>is everywhere</p>
<p>right like and you have a</p>
<p>generation that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want to pay for shit</p>
<p>right right like the</p>
<p>scott pilgrim</p>
<p>movie did you see that</p>
<p>brian yes one of my favorite</p>
<p>movies amazing movie</p>
<p>out of nowhere i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe they pulled it off i thought it was amazing</p>
<p>edgar wright who did shaun of the dead</p>
<p>right is just</p>
<p>a great movie and what happened was</p>
<p>it bombed at the box office</p>
<p>but at the same time it was like a perfect</p>
<p>movie for the</p>
<p>gamer nerd generation</p>
<p>a hipster generation even right</p>
<p>and i saw somebody tweet</p>
<p>about it they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>scott pilgrim is the movie this</p>
<p>generation the problem is this</p>
<p>generation doesn&rsquo;t pay for shit</p>
<p>right i had a friend</p>
<p>of mine one time she posted on her facebook she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>oh i saw the lovely bones it was amazing</p>
<p>and it was two weeks before the film came out i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re posting this on your facebook did you get like a</p>
<p>screener from somebody in la or something she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no i torn to that shit</p>
<p>yeah people just</p>
<p>admit it right</p>
<p>just talk about it openly what&rsquo;s hollywood gonna be</p>
<p>looking at people&rsquo;s doors like the</p>
<p>music industry</p>
<p>right nobody wants to be the fucking</p>
<p>music industry right now</p>
<p>my words we have</p>
<p>to get rid of currency and make it likes because all</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>would have liked it and</p>
<p>and so then</p>
<p>you just want to collect likes like they&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the currency in the future just like</p>
<p>sixth grade</p>
<p>do you like him</p>
<p>or do you like me like me yeah but he&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>point i mean you know what i mean</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going towards and that&rsquo;s like the new currency</p>
<p>people are almost</p>
<p>everywhere that&rsquo;s actually a good idea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually i mean some sort of a revamped idea</p>
<p>have you ever actually</p>
<p>tried to unlike anything on facebook</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nightmare</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s how it</p>
<p>should be yeah</p>
<p>actually yeah right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to get in it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>calm down drama</p>
<p>queen just think</p>
<p>about this for a bit</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s used to deal with</p>
<p>crazy bitches</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>just like cupcakes really you know you like settle</p>
<p>down what&rsquo;s with the</p>
<p>thumbs down</p>

<p>thumbs down and 1 million</p>
<p>thumbs up who are you 32 people</p>
<p>i want to know who pays for like those like</p>
<p>things like gifts what</p>
<p>is that what they&rsquo;re called you&rsquo;re paying like 3</p>
<p>for a balloon to put on somebody&rsquo;s facebook</p>
<p>that was a part</p>
<p>of facebook</p>
<p>are you talking</p>
<p>about like the lidic you got a button or something yeah</p>
<p>buttons that&rsquo;s what it was dude</p>
<p>virtual goods are huge</p>
<p>yeah i heard</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not into it the whole rage</p>
<p>right now in the industry is they call freemium really</p>
<p>the game is free</p>
<p>which is a brilliant idea in a bad economy and so you</p>
<p>start playing it but hey you see that guy who</p>
<p>has the fancy cowboy hat</p>
<p>you could have that for a dollar</p>
<p>let me ask you what do you think</p>
<p>about this what do you think</p>
<p>about games</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like everquest and shit</p>
<p>where they sell the character</p>
<p>they like build up some crazy</p>
<p>superhuman character</p>
<p>and then they go sell it oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>digital farming yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great yeah there&rsquo;s people who</p>
<p>sell it tom</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s entire</p>
<p>places where they just they busted for</p>
<p>world of warcraft</p>
<p>where they sit there and they will</p>
<p>just farm yeah i</p>
<p>watched that</p>
<p>on tv man there was this couple there was all</p>
<p>about addiction</p>
<p>of gaming i don&rsquo;t know what the show was</p>
<p>but it was a sad sad couple man because they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t paying attention to their kid</p>
<p>their poor kid was like mommy</p>
<p>daddy they&rsquo;re like shut up</p>
<p>and play the world</p>
<p>no it was a real tv show</p>
<p>it was and one of the</p>
<p>things that they had is</p>
<p>all these people that were in</p>
<p>i think it was like russia or something like that</p>
<p>that were playing games</p>
<p>for americans they</p>
<p>build up their account they</p>
<p>play all day and then they sell it to them this is the</p>
<p>fundamental</p>
<p>trade off that you have</p>
<p>right now as you get to the certain</p>
<p>point you realize</p>
<p>people often talk in the industry</p>
<p>about kids versus adults</p>
<p>kids have no</p>
<p>money and all the time</p>
<p>adults have very little time and have the</p>
<p>money and so</p>
<p>which audience are you</p>
<p>right if you can have a person who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>can get paid you know the</p>
<p>equivalent of five cents an hour and</p>
<p>every hour you can earn a dollar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worth of gold</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a business</p>
<p>model for somebody</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think blizzard&rsquo;s a fan of that right</p>
<p>but once you have</p>
<p>eyes like i</p>
<p>often talk about the</p>
<p>seven deadly census</p>
<p>game design right</p>
<p>like i walk into this</p>
<p>world and i see you with your</p>
<p>fancy you know two girls one up</p>
<p>shirt on and i&rsquo;m like oh i want one of</p>
<p>those how do i get that</p>
<p>and then i envy you</p>
<p>right and then i wind up getting</p>
<p>greed so i can collect</p>
<p>money and then i want</p>
<p>getting too many to wind up with gluttony and then</p>
<p>just all these</p>
<p>start factoring into each</p>
<p>other and once you have eyes it&rsquo;s the way the</p>
<p>world works you see the guy with</p>
<p>a nice car it&rsquo;s like oh i envy him i want that nice car</p>
<p>you can apply that to the virtual</p>
<p>world exactly as you can apply it</p>
<p>to the real</p>
<p>world you know</p>
<p>blizzard and</p>
<p>world of warcraft</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>exact numbers but they had released a pet</p>
<p>whereas it was</p>
<p>like 25 actual dollars or something like that and</p>
<p>their servers</p>
<p>wound up getting</p>
<p>crashed with people lining up to buy it</p>
<p>just for like one little pet that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what they figured out how to do is</p>
<p>make it so that</p>
<p>the more you play the game the better you get</p>
<p>the better your life is the more</p>
<p>successful you are the more</p>
<p>powerful you are</p>
<p>the better the</p>
<p>experience is the more you have control of</p>
<p>other people in the game</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like the really</p>
<p>trippy thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a time thing they</p>
<p>locked you in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a show that you&rsquo;re totally hooked on</p>
<p>and it never ends</p>
<p>and it keeps getting crazier when</p>
<p>we do new people and</p>
<p>any blizzard</p>
<p>mark my words has created this mold that so many</p>
<p>other people in the position</p>
<p>gonna follow we got</p>
<p>this thing in the new gears and we have a calendar</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you play gears and it&rsquo;s like oh hey</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>trade in your game</p>
<p>cause in two</p>
<p>weeks there&rsquo;s like ticker tuesday or triple xp</p>
<p>thursdays right</p>
<p>and then your friends are playing on that same day</p>
<p>and you wanna keep</p>
<p>going right and</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>psychology trick there were like you know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t sell the game because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>thinking there</p>
<p>might be something coming up</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dungeon masters we&rsquo;re always like manipulating that</p>
<p>experience online to have new shit happen</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>crazy that it just keeps</p>
<p>going though</p>
<p>but i mean how</p>
<p>much did all</p>
<p>the average person have over their life</p>
<p>right so you</p>
<p>have a world</p>
<p>where you can</p>
<p>start gaining that control yeah</p>
<p>i think the biggest problem</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re young is</p>
<p>figuring out what you want to do when you grow up</p>
<p>right like thankfully i was</p>
<p>lucky and i saw games i was like boom that</p>
<p>right but so i&rsquo;ve talked to kids are like i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>school and i don&rsquo;t know what i want to do</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like dude pick something and be surgical about it</p>
<p>and decide that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be the best at that</p>
<p>yeah but the</p>
<p>problem is finding something for a lot of kids the real</p>
<p>issue is finding something i mean you got</p>
<p>lucky i got</p>
<p>lucky a lot of people did but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to find the</p>
<p>thing that you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna like say oh it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be this</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re doing it and then halfway into</p>
<p>it you like this fucking blow</p>
<p>okay so it&rsquo;s difficult to</p>
<p>find what that</p>
<p>thing is it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>asking it especially the</p>
<p>young age when you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you hardly know a lot</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in the</p>
<p>world around you</p>
<p>but at the same time</p>
<p>that opportunity now with the internet is</p>
<p>greater than ever</p>
<p>right like you</p>
<p>could shoot a</p>
<p>viral video you could</p>
<p>start a podcast you</p>
<p>could do anything and if you</p>
<p>start getting better and better at it you could</p>
<p>build community</p>
<p>right if that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>wanna do but what if you</p>
<p>wanna be a carpenter</p>
<p>or what if you</p>
<p>wanna be a painter you know there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>for kids the hardest</p>
<p>thing is finding the thing</p>
<p>finding whatever the fuck it is like</p>
<p>most kids don&rsquo;t get enough exposure</p>
<p>to interesting ideas between the schoolwork</p>
<p>when you go to</p>
<p>school when you think</p>
<p>about what you</p>
<p>gotta do you</p>
<p>gotta get up at fucking</p>
<p>seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>you gotta leave</p>
<p>catch a bus with a</p>
<p>bunch of other douchebags</p>
<p>do a bunch of shit that sucks all day</p>
<p>listen to a</p>
<p>bunch of people tell you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never gonna make anything out of your life</p>
<p>unless you pay attention to them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like listen</p>
<p>bitch you&rsquo;re teaching</p>
<p>school i know you don&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>money shut the fuck up don&rsquo;t you love it</p>
<p>oh life was so</p>
<p>great when you&rsquo;re a kid like no you</p>
<p>know yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>moments but it sucked so to find something that you</p>
<p>truly love in the</p>
<p>midst of all this like programming is what</p>
<p>school is no more than programming</p>
<p>it is education there is information that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna download you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna remember it</p>
<p>but the reality of what</p>
<p>it is is getting you programmed to get used to doing</p>
<p>things you don&rsquo;t wanna do</p>
<p>listening to people that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna hear you&rsquo;re out people you don&rsquo;t yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a buzzer</p>
<p>why does there have to be a buzzer stupid</p>
<p>well this is so important that we fucking</p>
<p>leave at a certain time and get there at a certain time</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re turning me into a robot</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re turning me into some worker asshole</p>
<p>that just goes and does the same goddamn</p>
<p>thing every day you&rsquo;re providing</p>
<p>order for a certain mind that</p>
<p>might otherwise</p>
<p>with the development of yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ways to educate people</p>
<p>have you hung</p>
<p>out with any</p>
<p>public school teachers</p>
<p>like my favorite</p>
<p>hobby is if i&rsquo;m out with friends and</p>
<p>it was out in san francisco with a</p>
<p>buddy and he had a date</p>

<p>story out there yeah</p>
<p>well you know they&rsquo;re all doing</p>
<p>crazy shit now too because of the internet</p>
<p>you hear like 13 year olds are talking</p>
<p>about making out with</p>
<p>other girls</p>

<p>other everybody</p>
<p>would say they were</p>
<p>gonna do something and you never knew</p>
<p>quite what it was</p>
<p>right and there was this kind of like</p>
<p>adult conspiracy to keep like</p>
<p>pornography away from you and</p>
<p>things like that you had to go in the woods and find</p>
<p>points we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this a hundred times on the podcast finding yeah</p>
<p>finding porn in</p>
<p>the woods that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny everyone&rsquo;s got the same</p>
<p>story everybody it&rsquo;s incredible that we didn&rsquo;t</p>

<p>to you dirty</p>
<p>stuff we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring this up to you and</p>
<p>everyone has the same goddamn</p>
<p>story you&rsquo;re in the woods we</p>
<p>should find a</p>
<p>magazine you</p>
<p>should make an</p>
<p>adult bookstore in the woods it&rsquo;d probably be the most</p>
<p>successful just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even tell have any science</p>
<p>in the middle</p>
<p>of the woods</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a johnny porno seed it looks like</p>

<p>giant sack of porn and it&rsquo;s like</p>

<p>going on here</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s terrifying yeah now</p>
<p>click of a button you can see two girls one cup yeah</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before</p>
<p>about how crazy it is how</p>
<p>how close all this stuff is</p>
<p>like someone can send you a twitter link and you</p>
<p>click on it and just give it to be the most horrible</p>
<p>thing ever mark my words if i ever have children</p>
<p>like they are not</p>
<p>gonna get a cell phone</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re maybe 13</p>
<p>yeah but you know what the</p>
<p>worst thing you</p>
<p>wanna have is an uninformed kid true true</p>
<p>when all the other kids</p>
<p>just talk to them and just</p>
<p>let them be</p>
<p>you know in the same</p>
<p>flow as everybody else</p>
<p>just let him know what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on while it&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>as long as that bass is there right</p>
<p>yeah yeah look</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s that old</p>
<p>expression the kids are</p>
<p>gonna be alright</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>they are they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be alright they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fine just like we&rsquo;re fine we&rsquo;re worried</p>
<p>about them you</p>
<p>know and i have</p>
<p>little daughters</p>
<p>and logically</p>
<p>you know i can say this and of course you know</p>
<p>paternally i</p>
<p>just want to protect them and nerf the fucking</p>
<p>world and all that</p>
<p>but i understand where</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from</p>
<p>these kids are</p>
<p>gonna be fine they&rsquo;re growing up with other</p>
<p>human beings for</p>
<p>some extent you want them to make</p>
<p>their own mistakes</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;ve known</p>
<p>parents yes</p>
<p>pad the house</p>
<p>up too much and it&rsquo;s like let them fall over once in a</p>
<p>while let them</p>
<p>learn have balance</p>
<p>right like well yeah but you know you</p>
<p>gotta be careful</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want them</p>
<p>i mean kids die</p>
<p>you know they fall yeah</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have a cold</p>
<p>stove in the middle</p>
<p>of the living room yeah</p>
<p>but i mean if you have hard</p>
<p>floors you know like i have marble</p>
<p>floors it&rsquo;s kind of tricky</p>
<p>you know you gotta</p>
<p>you gotta watch them</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>point the point is you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re growing up with</p>
<p>other people and i think</p>
<p>things always</p>
<p>get better and even though it seems like shit&rsquo;s worse</p>
<p>even though it seems like shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worse as far</p>
<p>as like the economy and all this craziness as far as</p>
<p>invasion of privacy and</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>the access to information that</p>
<p>we have and they&rsquo;re getting inundated with images and</p>
<p>videos and all this shit that we didn&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>until we were well</p>
<p>mature they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be fun</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just this is how they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>growing up now this is just how it is and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>the old people</p>
<p>that are just like our parents like you know kids</p>
<p>these days look at them</p>
<p>kids the same</p>
<p>video games it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like kids</p>
<p>these days with</p>
<p>their fucking ass</p>
<p>to mouth porn</p>
<p>you know they got ass to</p>
<p>mouth porn on</p>
<p>their fucking</p>
<p>iphone well that&rsquo;s just what it is it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>this is the new</p>
<p>world and the</p>
<p>world constantly</p>
<p>keeps getting more and more complex it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>world of ass to</p>
<p>mouths it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>world is always getting more and more fucked</p>
<p>up it&rsquo;s always getting more complicated more strange</p>
<p>more bizarre</p>
<p>where is it</p>
<p>going to the zombie</p>
<p>apocalypse well i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s always look i</p>
<p>think as long as there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>freedom of information the way we&rsquo;re expressing each</p>
<p>other right now</p>
<p>and communicating with each</p>
<p>other people are</p>
<p>going to be able to figure out</p>
<p>things quicker</p>
<p>you know and i</p>
<p>think kids are</p>
<p>gonna be able to figure out this</p>
<p>multi faceted fucked up chaotic world</p>
<p>far quicker than some fucking doofus from 1963</p>
<p>yeah you know you take some kid from 1963 you</p>
<p>could talk him in anything they didn&rsquo;t know shit</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>today kids are</p>
<p>gonna be more savvy more</p>
<p>aware more information</p>
<p>nobody needs to ask anybody anything anymore</p>
<p>yeah he was</p>
<p>the fuck it up</p>
<p>you find it</p>
<p>right you know wozniak was complaining</p>
<p>about this actually</p>
<p>there was steve wozniak one of the creators of</p>
<p>apple was doing an interview</p>
<p>where he was</p>
<p>saying back in my day you know</p>
<p>you had a question you had to find a</p>
<p>smart person and ask him</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s dumb</p>
<p>why would i</p>
<p>why are you complaining</p>
<p>about that there&rsquo;s not that many fucking</p>
<p>smart people</p>
<p>but i gotta seek out one dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s retarded i have</p>
<p>to go and talk to the professor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re so goddamn arrogant</p>
<p>about their information</p>
<p>thing about the mayans</p>
<p>right they used to control them by the you know all the</p>
<p>quote priests you know</p>
<p>figured out</p>
<p>science and figured out you know how the you know the</p>
<p>and how everything</p>
<p>would turn out and</p>
<p>like everyone</p>
<p>was like wow how do they know this it must be</p>
<p>magic or like huh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re controlling this through knowledge right</p>
<p>yeah well there&rsquo;s yeah but</p>
<p>now everything</p>
<p>to before the library</p>
<p>of alexandria burned down</p>
<p>i mean that</p>
<p>was the idea as well they kept all the knowledge</p>
<p>they had all this information</p>
<p>about all sorts of different</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>the delayed person was unaware of</p>
<p>now everybody can get it google bitch damn</p>
<p>we used to have to seek out a tim sweden</p>
<p>era john carmack yeah</p>
<p>right and hang on to them and</p>
<p>write them up to the top yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true now there&rsquo;s just fucking</p>
<p>a computer connection</p>
<p>to the internet and all your questions</p>
<p>answer but it&rsquo;s not always true dude not always</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s getting there</p>
<p>it really is getting</p>
<p>closer and closer it&rsquo;s getting to the point</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of disinformation but there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>a lot of information there&rsquo;s a lot of good information</p>
<p>and i think that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because i think it developed</p>
<p>just like we need to be able to</p>
<p>discern between bullshit and reality in the real world</p>
<p>we need to be able to discern</p>
<p>between bullshit and reality online</p>
<p>and people will sort it all out and figure it out you</p>
<p>know there&rsquo;s a lot of people that have there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>urban myths</p>
<p>about all sorts of different</p>
<p>things if you</p>
<p>drink a coke and take you know</p>
<p>fucking this with it you&rsquo;ll die</p>
<p>i mean how many different stories have we ever</p>
<p>heard oh yeah</p>
<p>and then you just go online</p>
<p>pop rocks growing up</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s what it was</p>
<p>it was mikey</p>
<p>from the life serial commercial died his stomach</p>
<p>exploded right</p>
<p>there was the</p>
<p>urban legend</p>
<p>about the girl who</p>
<p>stuck the hot dog in her pussy</p>
<p>and then had to go to the hospital you</p>
<p>never heard that one i</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t hear that one that was the other one</p>
<p>all the maggots were</p>
<p>starting coming out of your ass</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>about the lobster</p>
<p>that right you</p>
<p>heard that one</p>
<p>right what was that one</p>
<p>the girl apparently took a lot</p>
<p>to boston one it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>lobster lobster</p>
<p>put it in her then like lit a mash to make</p>
<p>its tail flip around turns out the lobster had like</p>
<p>like planted a</p>
<p>bunch of eggs in her and</p>
<p>then like three weeks</p>
<p>later she died at the top</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>could solely see that some</p>
<p>disgusting girl was shit breath telling me that story</p>
<p>it really seems like life is</p>
<p>going towards</p>
<p>having a matrix bubble</p>
<p>where you live in a bubble and your</p>
<p>whole life is like</p>
<p>she was such a whore</p>
<p>she took this lobster</p>
<p>she stuck it in her</p>
<p>pussy right</p>
<p>right she lighted it with a</p>
<p>little fire</p>
<p>it was on fire and a fucking lobster just</p>
<p>dropped all his eggs in a</p>
<p>snatch it was</p>
<p>a lobster fest</p>
<p>and two fucking lobsters</p>
<p>are crawling out of a</p>
<p>pussy what a whore</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s the case that life is</p>
<p>going towards</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be in a bubble and our</p>
<p>whole life is</p>
<p>going to be some kind of sit like</p>
<p>matrix style</p>
<p>cocoon where we&rsquo;re all working for the eyes i actually</p>
<p>think the people who actually have</p>
<p>people skills</p>
<p>will suddenly</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna know how</p>
<p>to be connected and how to get all this data right</p>
<p>but those who actually can interact in real life</p>
<p>will actually do pretty well if</p>
<p>you have the combination of that</p>
<p>we all know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>to try to like speculators to what exactly is</p>
<p>gonna happen but we all know that something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening and that&rsquo;s the most interesting thing</p>
<p>about this conversation</p>
<p>is that we all are just</p>
<p>admitting like everyone&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>well this is</p>
<p>gonna stop and</p>
<p>everything will</p>
<p>level off and then we&rsquo;ll just you know go fishing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going faster than ever though exponentially</p>
<p>right yeah it&rsquo;s moving in a</p>
<p>weird direction when you were talking</p>
<p>about that smart dust</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>the ability to</p>
<p>track you and little</p>
<p>particles that can hang on to you and 3d computers and</p>
<p>this whole wikileaks thing</p>
<p>the transparency</p>
<p>of the whole process now</p>
<p>seeing this guy get arrested for</p>
<p>not wearing a condom and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tracking him down like he&rsquo;s a killer</p>
<p>and that is this main</p>
<p>thing he&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>wrong he didn&rsquo;t wear a condom nobody knows what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>charging nobody knows anybody else involved it</p>
<p>though right he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s like willing to</p>
<p>stand up there</p>
<p>and take it on the chin is the face of this</p>
<p>whole operation i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the</p>
<p>whole story</p>
<p>i need to look into it more and i hesitate to</p>
<p>anytime anything involves anything political</p>
<p>i always just say you know what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like watching a tv show that&rsquo;s fucked me over</p>
<p>you know this this show sucks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting me</p>
<p>again i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna watch your</p>
<p>stupid show</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how i feel</p>
<p>about politics so i when anything like this</p>
<p>is in the news i&rsquo;m like fuck you my time is valuable</p>
<p>you guys are all</p>
<p>crazy you&rsquo;re all full of shit</p>
<p>kiss my ass i&rsquo;m not paying attention</p>
<p>but as this is getting further and further</p>
<p>along i&rsquo;m getting sucked in</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so surreal</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s so strange</p>
<p>well you know the only a certain percentage of the</p>
<p>cables were actually</p>
<p>released it was something like 20 000 out of like</p>
<p>300 000 or something they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>panicking man</p>
<p>these the politicians are</p>
<p>panicking they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna know all</p>
<p>these other nations are</p>
<p>gonna know what kind of shit we talked</p>
<p>about them you have a hard time containing</p>
<p>data though even in my business it&rsquo;s just like oh</p>
<p>suddenly something just appears as a</p>
<p>rumor on a website yeah it&rsquo;s like how the fuck</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>somebody profiting by this like as i</p>
<p>know in the gaming industry if you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>gonna leak something to like</p>
<p>you know a video game website you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna make money like</p>
<p>right and you</p>
<p>know you&rsquo;d hope somebody</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have two beers</p>
<p>at a pub and tell them something like and then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people run with it</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s one of the most fascinating</p>
<p>things about bit torrent</p>
<p>and all this</p>
<p>stuff it&rsquo;s almost like people feel compelled</p>
<p>to contribute</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s like a human</p>
<p>urge to put information and</p>
<p>stuff available online</p>
<p>like before people were getting chased down</p>
<p>people love the idea that you</p>
<p>could go to</p>
<p>their site and get a</p>
<p>bunch of shit yeah</p>
<p>you can get a</p>
<p>bunch of shit from them and they love to be yeah</p>
<p>they love to be distributors of it</p>
<p>you know it was so common there</p>
<p>were so many different sites that had illegal shit</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be like a</p>
<p>human nature</p>
<p>thing where you just want to like</p>
<p>share and host and have community</p>
<p>remember where&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where sites yeah of</p>
<p>course yeah i mean that&rsquo;s different than bit torn</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know there was these</p>
<p>weird fucking hidden sites</p>
<p>where you can go and download</p>
<p>layers with a z</p>
<p>yeah w a r e z</p>
<p>and you could</p>
<p>go and got this</p>
<p>with suarez</p>
<p>they got all shut down they</p>
<p>figured out how to stop them</p>
<p>but then this</p>
<p>whole peer to peer</p>
<p>thing came up and the peer to peer</p>
<p>thing is too confusing</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re downloading say if you&rsquo;re getting a</p>
<p>movie you&rsquo;re not getting it from one person</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>it from like a hundred people or more even</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting all</p>
<p>these files and</p>
<p>somehow another they&rsquo;re compiling who&rsquo;s your computer</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s craziness because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking all</p>
<p>these ones and zeros from like</p>
<p>thirty different places</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>final product is illegal</p>
<p>yeah like whoa what are you saying and</p>
<p>how do you track</p>
<p>right where did it come from somebody had it</p>
<p>if the one person</p>
<p>that had it there&rsquo;s one illegal copy right</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re all illegal but what if there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>legal one so here&rsquo;s the key is to provide</p>
<p>a service that people are willing to pay for why do you</p>
<p>think hollywood&rsquo;s betting on 3d so much right now</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like okay what are we on</p>
<p>what are we</p>
<p>gonna actually do</p>
<p>i think that&rsquo;s adding</p>
<p>the third dimension</p>
<p>the key to that is nfl i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s porn</p>
<p>and fell would be dope</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re filming all the</p>
<p>ufcs in three yep</p>
<p>you have seen 3d</p>
<p>that be genius right</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s an event</p>
<p>right like filmed</p>
<p>a bunch of them already</p>
<p>i want my 3d</p>
<p>to be an event i want to go see avatar i want</p>
<p>to see tron in 3d</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>go see like meet the fokker 6 in 3d i don&rsquo;t really care</p>
<p>right in my</p>
<p>house like you know i don&rsquo;t really need to see like</p>
<p>your average</p>
<p>rental in 3d but when there&rsquo;s an event there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fight there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>the super bowl i will i&rsquo;ll put my</p>
<p>glasses on and</p>
<p>watch out of my</p>
<p>house or a dope</p>
<p>movie something fucking bad</p>
<p>that some super like</p>
<p>the more i watch</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sorry the more</p>
<p>watch tv in 3d though it&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>about that i</p>
<p>think why they&rsquo;re trying to make all the</p>
<p>movies 3d and all the games 3d is to make it to the</p>
<p>point that what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going towards is like walls of</p>
<p>tvs or like i was saying the imax</p>
<p>movie theater</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a bubble aren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s at the 360</p>
<p>like i think i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>trying to push that that not the 3d part just the</p>
<p>depth part of it so that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going towards a bigger</p>
<p>screen do you</p>
<p>think that they</p>
<p>can do that eventually they&rsquo;ll be able to create an</p>
<p>image that looks</p>
<p>three dimensional without actually having to have</p>
<p>glasses have you</p>
<p>seen the nintendo</p>
<p>3ds yeah they already have it already have</p>
<p>does it look like remember when we went to that um</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t remember where the</p>
<p>place was we went to and we saw some some sort of a big</p>
<p>screen was in an austin</p>
<p>they had a big</p>
<p>screen that was</p>
<p>it it was a 3d</p>
<p>thing they have it now it was</p>
<p>super dope it was in best buy</p>
<p>somewhere in best buy oh yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah it was best</p>
<p>buy remember</p>
<p>it was incredible we were</p>
<p>watching that</p>
<p>monsters monster vs</p>
<p>aliens yeah yeah</p>
<p>it was insane</p>
<p>the depth was so fucking gripping</p>
<p>i was like this</p>
<p>is like giving me like a mental boner just to</p>
<p>watch it&rsquo;s like thrilling</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so alive with</p>
<p>visuals you know so your</p>
<p>story doesn&rsquo;t always have to be the most original</p>
<p>thing but if you can provide something so but</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s never seen before that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>we play games that&rsquo;s why we go to the</p>
<p>movies is to get away from the shitty day to day</p>
<p>monday in life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re people</p>
<p>who love avatar so much that are depressed when they</p>
<p>leave it right</p>
<p>cause they created this</p>
<p>whole virtual</p>
<p>world that just wanted to exist</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s me man i wanted to go there</p>
<p>and i wanted to lead</p>
<p>when i read</p>
<p>about that movie i&rsquo;m like this was pretty</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>okay so it&rsquo;s blue people meets fer and</p>
<p>gully and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like oh this is cool that was a perfect example of</p>
<p>depth though when you saw avatar for the</p>
<p>first time how</p>
<p>like that one</p>
<p>scene where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going down there</p>
<p>pulling out something like a dead body or something</p>
<p>it should like that long hallway</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s what it seems like</p>
<p>everything i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>watching regular tv in 3d for like a couple</p>
<p>months now and</p>
<p>even like regular tv shows that</p>
<p>they have like a reenaction that makes the tv</p>
<p>try to make it in 3d</p>
<p>that reenaction</p>
<p>recreation of trying to make it 3d</p>
<p>and even shows like that you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>watching tv and you&rsquo;re like wow this background</p>
<p>this really far back you know so it seems like</p>
<p>everything is</p>
<p>going for just</p>
<p>depth nowadays that</p>
<p>the technology</p>
<p>is going to be like us in a</p>
<p>pod and we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna sit there</p>
<p>and communicate</p>
<p>to get used to it that they can&rsquo;t go back right</p>
<p>exactly that&rsquo;s what it seems like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so used to it that what</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s how it is with hd for me</p>
<p>right now right but the</p>
<p>never underestimate how many people don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>money or don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>miss upgraded</p>
<p>conversation i ever said sorry</p>
<p>we know like we we can</p>
<p>track how many people have hd versus</p>
<p>standard definition</p>
<p>televisions and in our games</p>
<p>right based on</p>
<p>their settings</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>not as many people as you</p>
<p>think have hdtv</p>
<p>still to this day really there&rsquo;s still a</p>
<p>great percentage of rural america that</p>
<p>still doesn&rsquo;t have broadband</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>people that lag behind it because it&rsquo;s just not a</p>
<p>priority for them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll always get your</p>
<p>early adopters</p>
<p>guys like you who have 3d</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still tons of people out there</p>
<p>i stream all my</p>
<p>stuff on my xbox</p>
<p>like when i saw the red box you go to the</p>
<p>supermarket</p>
<p>where i live and like a friday</p>
<p>night near the college</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a line out the door</p>
<p>for the red box and i&rsquo;m like what is this</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blockbuster condensed</p>
<p>into one box that you can just rent</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s huge</p>
<p>not everybody has the</p>
<p>broadband and has an xbox</p>
<p>setup they can easily</p>
<p>stream everything from the comfort of the living room</p>
<p>right yeah but</p>
<p>not everybody had electricity 200 years ago</p>
<p>yeah i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s all oh we got to keep pushing forward</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>gonna it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s eventually</p>
<p>going in the same direction</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter how many of</p>
<p>these hillbilly</p>
<p>fucks don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>catch up and we</p>
<p>know broadband</p>
<p>two thousand ten i got no fucking time for you</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s silly you need to move stupid</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>need to fucking get your family out of the woods soon</p>
<p>come on buddy it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be carpenters anymore though it seems</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re saying like if you want to be a carpenter</p>
<p>like how is this person</p>
<p>gonna find like</p>
<p>his job and stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen there&rsquo;s not gonna be</p>
<p>houses anymore we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna live in pods</p>
<p>will we have gigantic 3d computers or 3d printers</p>
<p>that we set up that</p>
<p>build a house is that what it&rsquo;ll be there&rsquo;ll be some no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be like a cocoon</p>
<p>of a third dimension wall that wraps around your body</p>
<p>like the way</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to live like that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be able to live that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>a bomber style</p>
<p>but what if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>young and you</p>
<p>grew up with that you don&rsquo;t need that much</p>
<p>space and you prefer the</p>
<p>virtual world over the real</p>
<p>world right and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not you&rsquo;re perfectly comfortable running around a</p>
<p>virtual field over a real one</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;ll be inevitable</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;ll be get so dope that why</p>
<p>would you want to live in the real world</p>
<p>stupid right</p>
<p>maybe the the fake</p>
<p>world will be</p>
<p>so talk about</p>
<p>badass what if you just go and yeah like you</p>
<p>remember when</p>
<p>virtual reality was all the immortals</p>
<p>with a giant dick</p>
<p>eyes that can see through walls there&rsquo;s no racism</p>
<p>yeah no racism</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like you have all the</p>
<p>money that has ever been</p>
<p>printed it&rsquo;s all yours</p>
<p>yeah multi penises</p>
<p>and you could</p>
<p>just go to other</p>
<p>worlds you could</p>
<p>travel to other</p>
<p>worlds you could do anything it&rsquo;s not real</p>
<p>you can make</p>
<p>your own world</p>
<p>right yeah that&rsquo;s the million dollar</p>
<p>trillion dollar</p>
<p>prize everybody wants to go for for games it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be your</p>
<p>dream that you can</p>
<p>ultimately control</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s think</p>
<p>about this man i mean what</p>
<p>is imagination imagination is some sort of energy that</p>
<p>allows you to</p>
<p>think up something that isn&rsquo;t there and create</p>
<p>it and now it</p>
<p>becomes real it manifests itself in the real</p>
<p>three dimensional</p>
<p>world and you can</p>
<p>beat on it with a hammer it all comes from imagination</p>
<p>so imagination is like some real creating force</p>
<p>but nobody really ever knows</p>
<p>where that comes from is it comes</p>
<p>from your environment has come from</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re exposed to like what is it</p>
<p>well they also</p>
<p>the concept of the</p>
<p>muse that you&rsquo;re an antenna and that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tuning into all the energy that&rsquo;s out there and</p>
<p>you just sort</p>
<p>of some sort of another</p>
<p>process it just like</p>
<p>you know like a</p>
<p>satellite dish pulls it out of the sky</p>
<p>and makes these numbers ones and zeros in this image</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>i mean when you look at what imagination is i mean</p>
<p>it really is some sort of an energy something that</p>
<p>exists in the mind</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s ethereal</p>
<p>and then it becomes a</p>
<p>solid thing it becomes a miller lite</p>
<p>you know it becomes a computer it becomes a microphone</p>
<p>you know and this</p>
<p>this eventually</p>
<p>got to move</p>
<p>further right so</p>
<p>if the imagination of all</p>
<p>these thoughts</p>
<p>can become a real</p>
<p>thing by someone</p>
<p>getting out and sawing some wood and nailing some</p>
<p>things together</p>
<p>eventually it is</p>
<p>going to become something through code</p>
<p>where you can alter</p>
<p>things not with a hammer and nails</p>
<p>but you can use your mind to create a real world</p>
<p>that could be</p>
<p>100 real your imagination</p>
<p>applied operating</p>
<p>system that</p>
<p>tunes into neural interface and becomes a part of you</p>
<p>and you and this operating</p>
<p>system connect to some sort of a computer</p>
<p>or whatever</p>
<p>the fuck it is whether it&rsquo;s wireless or whatever</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden</p>
<p>you enter into a tangible</p>
<p>three dimensional</p>
<p>world that you control</p>
<p>then you upload into it</p>
<p>yeah what the fuck man</p>
<p>and we leave meat space</p>
<p>right space</p>
<p>but think about</p>
<p>what happens when the meat dies and you</p>
<p>just rot and then someone has to come along</p>
<p>clean you they have to recognize the hole in the</p>
<p>matrix and see you not find it</p>
<p>weird that is two thousand</p>
<p>ten we still</p>
<p>bury people in the ground</p>
<p>yes damn we</p>
<p>should dress</p>
<p>those people up and fucking</p>
<p>dance them around</p>
<p>like we get</p>
<p>it fall apart</p>
<p>you need to burn them</p>
<p>what are you talking</p>
<p>about stupid</p>
<p>i think that</p>
<p>should be a play it</p>
<p>should be the</p>
<p>the play of this</p>
<p>you go there</p>
<p>to respect for guy and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like six</p>
<p>months long</p>
<p>so crazy you</p>
<p>gotta burn them it&rsquo;s so dumb and it cost so much</p>
<p>money to bury people man</p>

<p>ghostly memorial to that person right</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s trippy</p>
<p>what happens when that person</p>
<p>starts responding</p>
<p>though and it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a twilight zone right</p>
<p>it starts with a poke</p>
<p>right hit my like button yeah</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like i</p>
<p>think the acid&rsquo;s kicking in</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>article in fast company talking</p>
<p>about how twitter</p>
<p>is kind of taking over in certain ways and how</p>
<p>basically during the vmas this year</p>
<p>they had like twitter projections in the wall</p>
<p>of like the number of hits like each artist got and</p>
<p>their headline feeds what people are saying</p>
<p>about each artist</p>
<p>and so we have a generation</p>
<p>right now that wants to interact 24 7</p>
<p>it started with the remote control</p>
<p>and now like it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>enough i know friends who&rsquo;ve been sitting there texting</p>
<p>other people</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll say something like hey do</p>
<p>you want to go to the</p>
<p>store and they&rsquo;ll be like did you actually hear</p>
<p>what i just said and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be like yeah you said you want to go to the store</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re in the middle of typing an email</p>
<p>the human mind is</p>
<p>adapting to this kind of</p>
<p>multi task ability</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just enough to sit down and</p>
<p>watch something</p>
<p>you need a ticker feed</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re playing an online game</p>
<p>and in between</p>
<p>rounds we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>tweeting at the same time</p>
<p>right you have</p>
<p>to keep doing something and doing multiple</p>
<p>things otherwise the</p>
<p>brain is bored</p>
<p>you know what i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it affects traffic as much</p>
<p>either because i think</p>
<p>the majority of people that have</p>
<p>the google maps live</p>
<p>traffic view</p>
<p>sorts it out</p>
<p>from people that are just sitting there twittering</p>
<p>their mom and driving slower like it cancels each</p>
<p>other out because now we have better</p>
<p>technology so we know where to</p>
<p>drive better and</p>
<p>where the traffic is</p>
<p>so that equals out the</p>
<p>other retards that are just sitting there</p>
<p>twittering and slowing down traffic a different way</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think about that</p>
<p>do you mount your</p>
<p>phone to the</p>
<p>center of your</p>
<p>steering wheel</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that you</p>
<p>should mount your</p>
<p>phone to the center of your</p>
<p>steering wheel no i just did the side straddle</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;d look down at the map i&rsquo;m like okay</p>
<p>i got to turn</p>
<p>right up you&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>point where like</p>
<p>you could feel the</p>
<p>tug of your</p>
<p>phone in your pocket sometimes oh yeah</p>
<p>just like i just want to look</p>
<p>you know having a twitter fan base and just</p>
<p>see you post something before you</p>
<p>leave the office or whatever and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>driving the road you just want to know what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna say right</p>
<p>right and you just want to</p>
<p>respond it&rsquo;s that in itself is having a community right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredibly addictive</p>
<p>totally you have an instant</p>
<p>response from</p>
<p>thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people</p>
<p>right like how can you not want to know what they&rsquo;re</p>

<p>half the time it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing and half the time it&rsquo;s something new</p>

<p>capitalizing on that</p>
<p>last comic standing</p>
<p>show he did it better than anybody man he just ran</p>
<p>destroyed like i said this on the podcast</p>
<p>i watch him destroy rooms like</p>
<p>people just howling</p>
<p>like on the show</p>
<p>yeah on the show</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what made me got into</p>
<p>thinking like wow he is</p>
<p>he is a real comic</p>
<p>right well he&rsquo;s an animal dude</p>
<p>dude i mean he might be</p>
<p>500 fucking</p>
<p>pounds or whatever he is but he&rsquo;s working yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s out there constantly huffing it i</p>
<p>heard he does like three</p>
<p>hours shows to</p>
<p>it sometimes really like he</p>
<p>does ridiculous shows i want to know is like</p>
<p>just doing a</p>
<p>lot of comedy man he&rsquo;s doing it constantly his feet</p>
<p>his feet must hurt though they must hurt</p>
<p>they must just</p>
<p>maybe he sits down</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>maybe he lays down and</p>
<p>maybe what he does is</p>
<p>the audience is on like it&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those music part rides they all</p>
<p>strap in and they</p>
<p>raise them up</p>
<p>over him so they&rsquo;re hanging from the ceiling and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lying on his back and that&rsquo;s how he does his comedy</p>
<p>what if he had a</p>
<p>water bed on stage</p>
<p>and just laid back in the</p>
<p>water bed and</p>
<p>there was this candles all around and then that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how he did his</p>
<p>whole show that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>kind of a cool fucking idea</p>
<p>how about just being in the tub</p>
<p>just in the tub with candles</p>
<p>and comedy oh totally that&rsquo;s actually not a bad</p>
<p>idea you had your opener in there</p>
<p>with you and they&rsquo;re just hanging out laying there no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>only with girls though you only had girl comedy and</p>
<p>they think that</p>
<p>they say so</p>
<p>you have one person is</p>
<p>funny one person who isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s you in that camp that</p>
<p>thinks girls aren&rsquo;t funny</p>
<p>most girls are not</p>
<p>funny is that not a</p>
<p>classic comedy</p>
<p>thing right like well there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch i mean</p>
<p>sarah silverman&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>funny so i shouldn&rsquo;t say most girls just</p>
<p>look most comics aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>funny either there&rsquo;s less girls doing comedy so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no esther&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny comedians that are women yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no esther&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny little</p>
<p>esther she&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>funny she&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>comic there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch that are really good</p>
<p>comics i mean i have a</p>
<p>bunch of friends that are</p>
<p>comics that are female</p>
<p>to joke but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>women that are terrible it&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>so did they have a different restrictions</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about as many</p>
<p>things that can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>win sarah silverman does but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such a rarity</p>
<p>you know most that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>what it takes</p>
<p>right like you look at richard</p>
<p>prior sort of</p>
<p>it has to be you it has to be you and so very few</p>
<p>women actually are that i mean</p>
<p>sarah silverman</p>
<p>the reason one</p>
<p>one of the reasons why she&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny and so brash and</p>
<p>dirty is like that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny to her</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s who she really is you know</p>
<p>and it has to really be you</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>for doing an act yeah for a lot of men that&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>men 90 of all men talk</p>
<p>about you know</p>
<p>a lot of the same situations and</p>
<p>you know that you can relate</p>
<p>to anyone even if they&rsquo;re on stage</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re like as extreme as like say joey diaz</p>
<p>or joey diaz will take it into</p>
<p>what the fuck</p>
<p>do rogan the average man really has no</p>
<p>but for most</p>
<p>women you know like</p>
<p>conversations like men don&rsquo;t want to hear you talk</p>
<p>about politics</p>
<p>men don&rsquo;t want to hear your opinions</p>
<p>men don&rsquo;t wanna hear you talking</p>
<p>about you getting laid</p>
<p>men don&rsquo;t wanna hear you talking</p>
<p>about what the fuck is this bitch</p>
<p>so what are they so they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>so limited they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>limited and they can&rsquo;t be the alpha</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t be the one who has this idea that</p>
<p>maybe everybody</p>
<p>should listen to</p>
<p>cause it makes</p>
<p>sense you can&rsquo;t be that person</p>
<p>the last thing any fucking asshole man wants to do</p>
<p>is be in the audience with some woman</p>
<p>smarter than him that&rsquo;s making a lot of</p>
<p>sense that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know saying some shit that he</p>
<p>should have thought up on his own</p>
<p>a good luck controlling that good luck</p>
<p>that yeah and good luck with the politics you know men</p>
<p>always oppose</p>
<p>women on political issues</p>
<p>i know a lot of men who</p>
<p>when women think one way they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>think the other way just because a</p>
<p>woman thinks that way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like you know it&rsquo;s just natural</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ingrained</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s ingrained to not</p>
<p>want a woman to control you so</p>
<p>so many comedians just rely upon the whole like</p>
<p>marriage sucks like unhappy american male type</p>
<p>thing man it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s sad</p>
<p>well you know what it is it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>first of all that is a lot of</p>
<p>what they are</p>
<p>i mean a lot of people</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shitty at relationships you don&rsquo;t know i mean</p>
<p>we know a lot of people that</p>
<p>have fucking terrible relationships</p>
<p>is what it is</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you know</p>
<p>they get programmed into</p>
<p>thinking that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>this is this is the</p>
<p>angle this is what everybody does</p>
<p>like oh my life</p>
<p>sucks like that so that&rsquo;s the way it is and</p>
<p>i feel sympathy for you</p>
<p>right yeah but</p>
<p>some people will come out with it and you know</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s real you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you the two people can talk</p>
<p>about the same subjects and</p>
<p>one it works and the</p>
<p>other one it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t and</p>
<p>the one it works it works</p>
<p>cause this shit is coming from a real</p>
<p>place yeah like that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the most important</p>
<p>thing with i</p>
<p>think any kind of art it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta come from a real place</p>
<p>to really resonate with people this has to actually</p>
<p>be what you</p>
<p>wanna do you and i</p>
<p>started watching</p>
<p>for about five</p>
<p>seconds on cable the</p>
<p>other night was polyshore is dead</p>

<p>don&rsquo;t need to go over</p>
<p>old stuff but</p>
<p>i saw the mountain line</p>
<p>though having you know</p>
<p>having little dogs like that is like you know</p>
<p>they really can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>protect themselves from anything foxes can jack them</p>
<p>you know i saw a fox with a little baby deer</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know like everybody was talking</p>
<p>about how foxes are like</p>
<p>sweet and all they&rsquo;re so cool look at the</p>
<p>things survive too man i saw a fox</p>
<p>dragging a fawn</p>
<p>and i was like oh this is real shit you</p>
<p>ever actually get to be around into the big cats man</p>
<p>well i saw this one mountain lion</p>
<p>that was in my yard</p>
<p>and it was about</p>
<p>sixty pounds seventy</p>
<p>pounds it was like a dog like a german shepherd&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t big like</p>
<p>like holy shit this is</p>
<p>gonna eat me</p>
<p>it was big like</p>
<p>whoa that&rsquo;s a mountain lion</p>
<p>it was like it was almost kind of like</p>
<p>more shocking that it was smaller</p>
<p>because then i knew it was real</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m saying like i</p>
<p>expected if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna see a mountain lion i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna see a full</p>
<p>grown mountain</p>
<p>lion walking through the woods</p>
<p>but something</p>
<p>about this small one</p>
<p>and i was like whoa like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>small ones too like how many of them are out there i</p>
<p>started thinking like</p>
<p>how many of</p>
<p>these fucking creatures</p>
<p>will live in the woods and just kill things off</p>
<p>i had a cat killed by a guy i</p>
<p>think it was a coyote</p>
<p>out in my mom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>place in california</p>
<p>one time you hear him at</p>
<p>night right you just hear all the howlings</p>
<p>start kicking in right yeah</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in my yard sometimes</p>
<p>where they used</p>
<p>to be i had to fix my yard so they couldn&rsquo;t get in</p>
<p>but they would</p>
<p>get in and they</p>
<p>would shit all over the place</p>
<p>they would shit over by my pool</p>
<p>and it was creepy man because</p>
<p>i stay up late dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m up to like four o&rsquo;clock in the morning</p>
<p>so while i&rsquo;m up writing</p>
<p>you know these fucking</p>
<p>monsters are wandering around my yard looking for</p>
<p>shit to kill yeah but if you&rsquo;re out there they probably</p>
<p>sense that you&rsquo;re there and they&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>avoid it right</p>
<p>you know yeah</p>
<p>but you know don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t fucking take a chance with a</p>
<p>small person if there&rsquo;s no one around</p>
<p>you i had a</p>
<p>chance people before</p>
<p>i had a chance to take my brother and my little uh</p>
<p>seven year old</p>
<p>niece of the san</p>
<p>diego zoo or the</p>
<p>wild animal park and kind of go behind the scenes and</p>
<p>check out the</p>
<p>whole cheetah</p>
<p>set up there</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s one cheetah</p>
<p>there that was hand raised</p>
<p>my brother and i got to go in and</p>
<p>pet the fucking thing</p>
<p>right and just hearing the</p>
<p>it sounds like a harley</p>
<p>davidson right in person</p>
<p>and you see this</p>
<p>the fur is actually really coarse</p>
<p>and they have a certain presence</p>
<p>about them just like don&rsquo;t fuck with me right</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m at that</p>
<p>point where i&rsquo;m like okay i&rsquo;ll go and i&rsquo;ll get my</p>
<p>photo up and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get the</p>
<p>hell out because i don&rsquo;t want to have my face</p>
<p>eaten like that baboon in that lady a</p>
<p>while ago right</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>one that&rsquo;s just pacing the cage and when she saw</p>
<p>my little niece</p>
<p>she stopped immediately made eye contact and my niece</p>
<p>could sense</p>
<p>that this creature</p>
<p>looked at her and wanted to eat her and just</p>
<p>completely ran behind my brother&rsquo;s legs because</p>
<p>the cheetah just saw her as food</p>
<p>right it was just that primal instinct just kicked in</p>
<p>yeah they can&rsquo;t help it</p>
<p>cheetahs can be domesticated</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re one of the few animals that you can</p>
<p>successfully domesticate</p>
<p>them they&rsquo;re actually in the low end of the cat food</p>
<p>chain in africa too</p>
<p>right is that</p>
<p>what it is yeah</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re actually somewhat</p>
<p>endangered yeah</p>
<p>yeah and people have actually kept them as pets and</p>
<p>trained them and shit i</p>
<p>guess they don&rsquo;t kill you</p>
<p>dude i mean</p>
<p>a few animals</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still not</p>
<p>gonna trust it</p>
<p>yeah it was a</p>
<p>smart move especially with your niece man</p>
<p>so she wasn&rsquo;t allowed in with them of course</p>
<p>right it doesn&rsquo;t matter i mean even you know having it</p>
<p>aware that that&rsquo;s food if you know it ever sees her</p>
<p>again it was</p>
<p>funny that it&rsquo;s creepy</p>
<p>that she just realizes it</p>
<p>right and then</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>he realized</p>
<p>those those</p>
<p>magic moments are like all</p>
<p>right this is something not to</p>
<p>mess with right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>scary shit dude big cats are the</p>
<p>scariest they say that the reason why we have scared</p>
<p>where people are afraid of</p>
<p>monsters like</p>
<p>every kid is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all just leftover dna from</p>
<p>monkeys getting jacked</p>
<p>yep like cats back when we were you know subhuman</p>
<p>hominoids the primal instinct to avoid</p>
<p>scary stuff man</p>
<p>right and like if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an old stephen king</p>
<p>thing in line i can&rsquo;t remember what it was from</p>
<p>where he was saying you know the lightning</p>
<p>crashes and the door</p>
<p>opens and you see a 40 foot bug there part of you is</p>
<p>happy because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>expecting a 60 foot bug</p>
<p>right like that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>alien worked</p>
<p>right cause</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see the full</p>
<p>alien right at the</p>
<p>beginning you see the little bit of the leg a little</p>
<p>bit of the tail you&rsquo;re imagining like what can this</p>
<p>thing possibly look like</p>
<p>yeah it was the most</p>
<p>screwed up awesome</p>
<p>hr geiger design</p>
<p>ever but at</p>
<p>the same time shit</p>
<p>in your head</p>
<p>it was still out there we rewatched</p>
<p>aliens recently</p>
<p>aliens is good but the problem with</p>
<p>aliens is that they establish an alien</p>
<p>that this thing is</p>
<p>super fucking intelligent</p>
<p>really fast gigantic</p>
<p>super resourceful</p>
<p>very crafty and sneaky</p>
<p>but then the</p>
<p>second one they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>shooting them left and</p>
<p>right and they&rsquo;re dying</p>
<p>that was the</p>
<p>whole movie the</p>
<p>first i mean</p>
<p>they needed one you know it was one alien</p>
<p>versus the truckers</p>
<p>they went too quick</p>
<p>they should have had less</p>
<p>aliens let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>who the fuck am i</p>
<p>movie designer</p>
<p>characters are</p>
<p>telling them</p>
<p>one of the greatest science fiction</p>
<p>movies of all time</p>
<p>still an amazing movie</p>
<p>but to me i was like wait a</p>
<p>minute you can just kill him that easy</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>running around shotguns i like two better than one</p>
<p>one is an exercise</p>
<p>in action one is an exercise in suspense</p>
<p>right one is the</p>
<p>tease of the leg the</p>
<p>other one&rsquo;s the full on</p>
<p>blown up porno</p>
<p>right and you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched the rewatch the</p>
<p>things there</p>
<p>was too many</p>
<p>cut the shit</p>
<p>scenes in the</p>
<p>second one like when she was battling</p>
<p>it with the exoskeleton on i was like why isn&rsquo;t it just</p>
<p>stabbing you in the heart</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got this</p>
<p>giant fucking</p>
<p>monster tail why isn&rsquo;t it just</p>
<p>scooping you out</p>
<p>like your camera and</p>
<p>sat down i want to see a fucking mac</p>
<p>versus an alien</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>point of creativity man</p>
<p>where you have to be like you know what</p>
<p>a gun with a</p>
<p>chainsaw makes</p>
<p>absolutely no</p>
<p>sense on it</p>
<p>like even look at the design if</p>
<p>you want to grab the gun you saw your finger off right</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>yeah but what i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about is cut the shit moments</p>
<p>suspension of disbelief</p>
<p>where you make me go in a</p>
<p>place where i</p>
<p>think you got lazy</p>
<p>are you did so why you making me go here</p>
<p>why is this your conclusion</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s this bitch</p>
<p>fighting this thing</p>
<p>all they had to do is</p>
<p>build a certain amount of but</p>
<p>they hadn&rsquo;t make it believable you got it you got a</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t like have to go oh well i</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s just really bad with its tail</p>
<p>today that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>argument that says</p>
<p>like lord of the rings why didn&rsquo;t they just grab</p>
<p>those you know</p>
<p>birds at the end of it and have</p>
<p>them fly over and drop the ring into the volcano</p>
<p>right like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always possible to find words don&rsquo;t listen to you</p>
<p>fucking bird they</p>
<p>were riding the birds at the end of the movie man</p>
<p>birds like doing</p>
<p>carrier pigeons</p>
<p>trust birds</p>
<p>birds are cunts</p>
<p>birds are all</p>
<p>forward dinosaurs that became something new that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the most evil bird ever is the african gray</p>
<p>the most evil bird you ever see a shoe bill</p>
<p>no there&rsquo;s a congo documentary from the bbc that</p>
<p>freaked me out once</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>five foot tall prehistoric fucking bird with this</p>
<p>giant bill that</p>
<p>jacks these fish</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating man the</p>
<p>thing that fascinates me most</p>
<p>about birds</p>
<p>is they really are dinosaurs</p>
<p>they really are you know</p>
<p>and they think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of theories that a lot of dinosaurs</p>
<p>had feathers</p>
<p>you know they just rotted</p>
<p>off and that we don&rsquo;t see the fossils of feathers</p>
<p>yeah the fossils were just placed there to test our</p>
<p>faith dude there&rsquo;s a dude that i</p>
<p>argue with on twitter all day</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t argue with him all day</p>
<p>but i read his</p>
<p>shit all day what is your threshold for</p>
<p>blocking people</p>
<p>oh i just they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>annoying just</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t just go on instinct if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>annoying me i just</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s a reply saying hey man</p>
<p>sorry the matchmaking</p>
<p>sucked in gears too we&rsquo;ve been working on fixing it</p>
<p>like something like that to win you over and if you do</p>
<p>then you could wind up with a fan for life</p>

<p>time and stop</p>
<p>that bus driver from fucking them in the ass</p>
<p>and roofing them</p>
<p>and giving them</p>
<p>moonshine you&rsquo;d have to do that and or find</p>

<p>those things like if you sit there like i say like</p>
<p>porn is like on the internet is like</p>
<p>a man who brought fractal</p>
<p>it just keeps</p>
<p>going and going and you can just keep the</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never ending like when we were</p>
<p>growing up it was like</p>
<p>asia carrera and like a</p>
<p>ginger lynn</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>james and and then jannah</p>

<p>like the same 15 actors just repeated with different</p>
<p>spoofs of movies right</p>

<p>an infinite amount of girls and you&rsquo;re like at what</p>
<p>point are you like alright so this is 1 000</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think anybody&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>gonna see this and</p>
<p>his reaction man i felt so bad for</p>
<p>him and of course i teased him like nobody&rsquo;s business</p>
<p>but i was like dude you&rsquo;re getting your</p>
<p>chasing amy type of</p>
<p>girl next door type moment right like</p>
<p>he was just kind of crestfallen</p>
<p>about they didn&rsquo;t even go out that long right</p>
<p>but the fact that you know at some</p>
<p>point he found this girl cool</p>
<p>thing hung out and then he finds a</p>
<p>video over on some</p>
<p>random internet site doing some bad cheerleader porn</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just coming back who is this you&rsquo;re talking about a</p>
<p>buddy of mine in town</p>
<p>you see people in a</p>
<p>in la i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a common</p>
<p>thing to like you know date a girl and then find out</p>
<p>later she&rsquo;s a porn girl or she&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>stuff like that but you know let&rsquo;s see it that often in</p>
<p>outside of that</p>
<p>and i had a friend of mine recently happened to you</p>
<p>imagine in the mix of feelings he came</p>
<p>like of comedy of crestfallen</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like i&rsquo;m like dude</p>
<p>did you rub one out to it</p>
<p>and he wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>admit to it</p>
<p>but the feeling he</p>
<p>would have of the like we were just saying to</p>
<p>brian about the chasing amy</p>
<p>girl next door type vibe</p>
<p>right or just like oh man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of funny</p>
<p>i blame joe francis</p>
<p>hey what&rsquo;s going on with the gears of war</p>
<p>movie they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still making that you guys</p>
<p>still making it</p>
<p>sorry it&rsquo;s goodbye</p>
<p>optimus still working on it</p>
<p>learn a lot about how</p>
<p>filmmaking and how hollywood</p>
<p>never in the business works</p>
<p>right i mean you</p>
<p>really realized that it is very much a business</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s annoying as fuck</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many people with so many different opinions and you</p>
<p>gotta listen</p>
<p>to all of them well and it&rsquo;s there people who just</p>
<p>might not even have an opinion but in</p>
<p>order to stay</p>
<p>relevant they</p>
<p>throw their money</p>
<p>here i&rsquo;m only hearing out of one side</p>
<p>one side let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>test test oh</p>
<p>you know what i</p>
<p>think it reconnected</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s just the base sorry</p>
<p>so what happens is it&rsquo;s a business</p>
<p>like any other business</p>
<p>right and people want to make money and</p>
<p>often the people who</p>
<p>make the decisions are</p>
<p>often very rearward looking</p>
<p>like well i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>looking at the last two years and according to this</p>
<p>movies with</p>
<p>monkeys and them do well so you need a</p>
<p>monkey and i&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s my personal</p>
<p>experience that&rsquo;s exactly what it is yeah</p>
<p>not for this</p>
<p>project but what happened was they had</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like okay want to do this big</p>
<p>you know we got</p>
<p>you know len wiseman attached</p>
<p>great guy amazing director</p>
<p>okay well great we you know we have a really good</p>
<p>script you know we</p>
<p>think we can dock this out</p>
<p>they looked at the</p>
<p>budget like okay so this is</p>
<p>120 million dollars estimated</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no real love</p>
<p>story in here</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be rated r</p>
<p>cause you know if i show up at comic con</p>
<p>and we have a clip that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have people getting cut in half</p>
<p>blood flying</p>
<p>everywhere they&rsquo;re gonna tear</p>
<p>us limb from limb</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s no little kid</p>
<p>jaden smith type</p>
<p>story in there like this just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t add up like this</p>
<p>has hit all the demographics</p>
<p>and i remember reading</p>
<p>story about</p>
<p>these guys who</p>
<p>kind of created a computer formula for it</p>
<p>where you could</p>
<p>literally plug in</p>
<p>the genre you</p>
<p>could plug in</p>
<p>the actors you plug the time of year it was</p>
<p>released the</p>
<p>various themes that are in it and they could</p>
<p>vegas type betting odds you could bet on whether or not</p>
<p>their production would actually make</p>
<p>money and they they make money doing this</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re at the</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>absolutely yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying well we won&rsquo;t get the</p>
<p>matrix we won&rsquo;t get the 300 out</p>
<p>of it but we&rsquo;ll get you know some sort of will ferrell</p>
<p>comedy that</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing a</p>
<p>wacky sport</p>
<p>and you get to the</p>
<p>point where</p>
<p>creativity sometimes</p>
<p>goes to die in that environment and for</p>
<p>now everybody wants to make a district 9</p>
<p>really like how</p>
<p>can we make something that only cost 60 million dollars</p>
<p>and then blows it out because everybody&rsquo;s conscious</p>
<p>about how much</p>
<p>money they spent it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basic economics right</p>
<p>so i mean we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>kind of redoubling</p>
<p>it doing something that&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>smaller we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>recycling the script</p>
<p>project&rsquo;s not dead man</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>are you doing it with live people</p>
<p>uh tbd man i mean</p>
<p>a lot of it depends on who gets attached as a director</p>
<p>things like that i mean i personally</p>
<p>would like to see live action</p>
<p>as little cg as possible</p>
<p>i would like cg people man</p>
<p>you know why your</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t look real</p>
<p>these motherfuckers their</p>
<p>giant heads what are you</p>
<p>gonna get brock</p>
<p>lesnar to play</p>
<p>every role dude</p>
<p>your dudes look like fake dudes they&rsquo;re</p>

<p>thicknet guys like that that have that</p>
<p>level of charisma</p>
<p>to hold up on over there a two hour i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna work you</p>
<p>gotta go cgi son</p>
<p>and get some little geek</p>
<p>voices yeah geek dudes who are</p>
<p>crazy like steve</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s up guys</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>closer with that but dude did</p>
<p>carry the guys don&rsquo;t have to be that jack dude</p>
<p>like but your guys are so jacked</p>
<p>in gears of</p>
<p>war everyone&rsquo;s jacked that&rsquo;s part of the cool</p>
<p>thing about</p>
<p>it diesel to your average person in</p>
<p>pitch black looks jacked and he&rsquo;s five foot two</p>
<p>and was maybe what</p>
<p>like when he</p>
<p>is now five two he&rsquo;s a lot bigger than that</p>
<p>when i&rsquo;ve seen him he was</p>
<p>short maybe i</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>six feet tall</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s friends of rico rodriguez</p>
<p>who used to be ufc</p>
<p>heavyweight</p>
<p>champion i met him at</p>

<p>him in a bad</p>
<p>angle way bigger than me seems</p>
<p>short when i saw a man well i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>short but he&rsquo;s bigger than me</p>
<p>but though the bottom line is dude it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>about charisma than is</p>
<p>about muscles you get it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>charismatic</p>
<p>correct look at the hulk</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have a lou</p>
<p>ferrigno doing the hulk in</p>

<p>that crazy hug</p>
<p>that fucking smack</p>
<p>dude there&rsquo;s a huge deal</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>deal between</p>
<p>marcus fenix and the hulk</p>
<p>his fists are as big as pickup the hulk&rsquo;s head is</p>
<p>this big compared to his body</p>
<p>marcus fenix is jacked but he&rsquo;s not like insanely</p>
<p>jacked he&rsquo;s not even as jacked as the guy that comes</p>
<p>over muscle and fitness</p>
<p>magazine yeah he is</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just as jacked and his head&rsquo;s</p>
<p>extra super wide</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s a double</p>
<p>alpha the armor is</p>
<p>part of it dude yeah but his fucking head is</p>
<p>giant and he&rsquo;s perfect</p>
<p>dude why fuck around man</p>

<p>why you could</p>
<p>do anything man the</p>
<p>monsters and</p>
<p>everything at all</p>
<p>exist in the same world</p>
<p>not insane shit good luck</p>
<p>doing that for 60 million</p>
<p>oh is it too expensive</p>
<p>dude you know much avatar cost</p>
<p>it was insane</p>
<p>how much they cost</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a better 200</p>
<p>million plus trod cost</p>
<p>150 million</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a better idea that</p>
<p>your in game footage</p>
<p>movies like in your</p>
<p>video game are so good you</p>
<p>should have like sitcoms with</p>
<p>those guys going home</p>
<p>after work like</p>
<p>having a relationship like them at</p>
<p>the bar right</p>
<p>fucking do king of</p>
<p>queens king</p>
<p>of queens yeah</p>
<p>he gets home it takes</p>
<p>20 minutes to take off his armor</p>
<p>right oh god</p>
<p>just do it in game footage</p>
<p>stuff i&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>you know like a sitcom with all your characters in it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all like family guy</p>
<p>style they&rsquo;re all friends they hang out and get</p>
<p>drunk it was a terrible</p>
<p>movie but it was</p>
<p>the moment you never get</p>
<p>seen a game</p>
<p>right yeah right</p>
<p>it was a terrible</p>
<p>movie but it was an interesting concept it was a</p>
<p>bruce willis</p>
<p>movie where</p>
<p>thing was called surrogate</p>
<p>did you say surrogates yeah it was really recent yeah</p>
<p>where everybody went up to</p>
<p>they they stayed at home</p>
<p>and then they had the younger version of them that all</p>
<p>exist in the</p>
<p>world yeah younger</p>
<p>perfect version they have this full head</p>
<p>of hair and perfect skin it was like kind of weird yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d him somehow</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re getting at the</p>
<p>point where they can kind of</p>
<p>track your body and then kind of cg over</p>
<p>in such an amazing way</p>
<p>right and i mean</p>
<p>you look at what they</p>
<p>were for tron</p>
<p>their recreating</p>
<p>kind of like jeff bridges</p>
<p>young right</p>
<p>yeah i was saying</p>
<p>looks a little bit more like gary oldman</p>
<p>than jeff i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t yet</p>
<p>to see this yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the look at all the posters for i mean</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m dying to see the film man like</p>
<p>jeff bridges to me i thought it was pretty cool</p>
<p>jeff bridges gets cooler looking the</p>
<p>older he gets</p>
<p>have you seen the</p>
<p>trailer for true grit have</p>
<p>you seen him</p>
<p>naked yeah that</p>
<p>trailer looks awesome his face is just</p>
<p>talking about his face very</p>
<p>scary from those</p>
<p>he looks so just like awesomely grizzled right</p>
<p>he just loses</p>
<p>know where the fuck this came from</p>
<p>things sagging why is this bleeding it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>like skin tags</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just breaking left and</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s got did you see the</p>
<p>trailer for true grit though yes i did i did i saw</p>
<p>crazy heart too</p>
<p>yeah that was good yeah that was an interesting</p>
<p>movie man it was kind of cool i like sad</p>
<p>right but dude what&rsquo;s sad but it was good</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the life lesson of being on the road that much right</p>
<p>loneliness right well it&rsquo;s also the</p>
<p>partying man you know i&rsquo;ve met</p>
<p>a million people that have problems with partying</p>
<p>with alcohol</p>
<p>especially but with coke and with a</p>
<p>bunch of different things</p>
<p>people that are performers they&rsquo;re performing</p>
<p>all the time and they need to get up to perform</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the respect i have</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done like the european</p>
<p>press tour for the games</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s five</p>
<p>european cities in five days and that just wrecks me</p>
<p>right i cannot imagine doing like</p>
<p>30 cities and 40 days</p>
<p>right like what it takes to</p>
<p>actually pull that off and to sit there and to show up</p>
<p>every night and to command a stadium</p>
<p>what does that do to you</p>
<p>how can you actually show up like that and then</p>
<p>at the end of</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an infinite amount of</p>
<p>partying or just girls line up to just do whatever</p>
<p>in a different city and new people</p>
<p>experience all</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re gone</p>
<p>you really have to get back to your</p>
<p>hotel because you got to get up in the morning and five</p>
<p>hours go to your flight that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>those are the ones you&rsquo;re responsible</p>
<p>right yeah well it&rsquo;s the reality is</p>
<p>those those two</p>
<p>like i only did one tour like that most of</p>
<p>time what i do with comedy is i go out on the weekends</p>
<p>and then i come home i go</p>
<p>out i go out for a couple days then i come home</p>
<p>but a lot of guys</p>
<p>will go out and they&rsquo;ll do like you know i can know</p>
<p>while masjir brani</p>
<p>were talking</p>
<p>about he goes</p>
<p>out and he goes out for like a couple of weeks</p>
<p>three four weeks</p>
<p>but one time we did this maxim tour</p>
<p>and we were gone for like a</p>
<p>month yeah like a whole</p>
<p>month of just constantly doing gigs</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>weird thing man it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>how many cities</p>
<p>i think we did</p>
<p>twenty two dot</p>
<p>twenty two cities</p>
<p>twenty two and three days</p>
<p>do you have like a comedy bus or you</p>
<p>both we took a bus some</p>
<p>places most of the time we flew</p>
<p>but it was brutal man it was</p>
<p>weird it was horrible</p>
<p>all you&rsquo;re doing is traveling</p>
<p>and then trying to get as much rest as possible</p>
<p>and getting on</p>
<p>stage and then</p>
<p>trying to get as much rest as possible and</p>
<p>traveling you</p>
<p>never get a full</p>
<p>night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re always flying you&rsquo;re always eating terrible food</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s fun your comedy gets tight you</p>
<p>should love</p>
<p>the way you</p>
<p>should love the waking up and</p>
<p>going where the fuck am i all the time yeah i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>still do that</p>
<p>i do that so</p>
<p>often because i</p>
<p>travel so much like i get up to pee</p>
<p>and i go where&rsquo;s this bathroom</p>
<p>where am i do you know my trick</p>
<p>leave the bathroom</p>
<p>light on close the door</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good because when you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where the hell you are and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re hey you</p>
<p>gotta go like you that</p>
<p>thing will be like this got the light</p>
<p>at the end of the</p>
<p>tunnel is a good</p>
<p>trick you learn</p>
<p>a little transport</p>
<p>motherfucker you</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve had that happen that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>worst feeling in the</p>
<p>world weird</p>
<p>thing man but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>hotel room you just pee on the</p>
<p>floor me and joe had like a</p>
<p>scare at a hotel</p>
<p>where we both thought we were</p>
<p>gonna die and we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about it before but that really</p>
<p>changed the</p>
<p>whole thing for</p>
<p>hotels for me i actually fear</p>
<p>hotel half the</p>
<p>hotel rooms always</p>
<p>check always look out the like somebody</p>
<p>knocks the door always</p>
<p>look out the little law the people and there was a fire</p>
<p>yeah wasn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>what you know what the problem was it was an old hotel</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t have been</p>
<p>nearly as much of a problem but there was a single file</p>
<p>staircase who</p>
<p>and we were on the</p>
<p>fifth i was on the 15th before you i was like</p>
<p>14th i think and</p>
<p>you know 12</p>
<p>and you could only get one person on the</p>
<p>staircase at a time and people were slow</p>
<p>as fuck and when</p>
<p>someone says</p>
<p>you feel that</p>
<p>you probably felt that people are</p>
<p>about to trample each other</p>
<p>at that threshold</p>
<p>right or just that instinct kicks in i was</p>
<p>like that kidding i&rsquo;m the fucking head of the pack</p>
<p>i was the one to be running on people&rsquo;s heads</p>
<p>i was seconds away from</p>
<p>sprinting through</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>people me too</p>
<p>people with</p>
<p>slippers on man all ambient</p>
<p>up you can tell they were fucked up from</p>
<p>sleeping pills</p>
<p>and shit and they were moving slow as shit</p>
<p>and the problem is the announcement</p>
<p>like the lady on the</p>
<p>things like please</p>
<p>evacuate a building</p>
<p>of building a fire has been detected</p>
<p>please evacuate the</p>
<p>building immediately what time does it</p>
<p>have like 3 in the morning 4 30 4</p>
<p>30 yeah and</p>
<p>especially not knowing</p>
<p>where the hell you are it was like a robot</p>
<p>voice that woke</p>
<p>cause i was like attention</p>
<p>attention but it wasn&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>hate your face it was a</p>
<p>woman it was a</p>
<p>woman talking because</p>
<p>while she was talking she was doing it so robotic</p>
<p>we were trying to</p>
<p>first of all we&rsquo;re so foggy</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to figure</p>
<p>out what why you know if this is really happening it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem like how you</p>
<p>would tell me</p>
<p>that the fucking</p>
<p>building&rsquo;s on fire what you mean</p>
<p>get the fuck</p>
<p>out exactly</p>
<p>so this this chicks</p>
<p>a fire has been detected in the</p>
<p>building please</p>
<p>evacuate immediately</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not sure if this</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>robot portal</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>robot or if it&rsquo;s a real person</p>
<p>to evacuate the building</p>
<p>until i hear in the</p>
<p>background we got to get</p>
<p>these people out of here</p>
<p>shut there was a guy in the back behind</p>
<p>her there must have been like you know behind the</p>
<p>counter with her it&rsquo;s like we got to get</p>
<p>these people out of here</p>
<p>and then what if it was</p>
<p>everybody like it was just a false</p>
<p>alarm and he&rsquo;s decided</p>
<p>to fuck with everybody like no no it&rsquo;s on the 12th</p>
<p>floor now we need to get him out i remember</p>
<p>thinking that i was</p>
<p>the same exact</p>
<p>thing as jokes we had talked</p>
<p>about it afterwards and i was</p>
<p>thinking the same</p>
<p>thing like i am</p>
<p>going to have to</p>
<p>start throwing people out of my way yeah</p>
<p>and then i looked at the windows like in the</p>
<p>stairways it was like</p>
<p>you see you</p>
<p>get off a plane</p>
<p>it just it just amazes</p>
<p>you and how</p>
<p>slow people can actually physically move like like that</p>
<p>plane that landed on the hudson a couple years ago like</p>
<p>i would have just crap my</p>
<p>pants over like get me off of this</p>
<p>right so many people dude are barely taking care of</p>
<p>their body barely</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re just barely barely</p>
<p>been next to that guy in the</p>
<p>plane he gives you the</p>
<p>extra elbow</p>
<p>rest yeah was</p>
<p>leaking over</p>
<p>under your seat mean we were thinking</p>
<p>about that when we were</p>
<p>we had ralphie on the podcast you mean</p>
<p>brian and ralphie barely sat in a</p>
<p>couch together</p>
<p>what happens if you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>southwest you</p>
<p>gotta sit next to him</p>
<p>no what&rsquo;s her saying it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about the lap band now</p>
<p>yeah what the fuck is the</p>
<p>laugh dude it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>everywhere it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>every billboard</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so gluttonous</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>you know there was a</p>
<p>picture from a long time ago that the beginning of the</p>
<p>the 18th century</p>
<p>or the 19th century there was like a carnival</p>
<p>and they had the fat man</p>
<p>you know in the carnival</p>
<p>like a sideshow</p>
<p>freak the bearded</p>
<p>woman the fat man</p>
<p>and the fat man wasn&rsquo;t nearly as big as</p>
<p>ralphime and</p>
<p>this guy was a</p>
<p>freak back then</p>
<p>because people had a fucking work</p>
<p>here there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not just that it&rsquo;s moving but it&rsquo;s also the average</p>
<p>american diet</p>
<p>the average american diet likes</p>
<p>three flavors fat</p>
<p>sugar and salt</p>
<p>right that everywhere you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trained we have an entire</p>
<p>generation of kids that will not eat food without</p>
<p>ketchup on it</p>
<p>like they just won&rsquo;t they just have to</p>
<p>catch up in the end and</p>
<p>catch up chicken fingers</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like dude heaven forbid you take them out like</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll give him some fish or try a</p>
<p>curry or something like this</p>
<p>no no it&rsquo;s just and then</p>
<p>you think about mcdonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>get him young</p>
<p>right yeah well the thing is</p>
<p>about like this lap band</p>
<p>thing what&rsquo;s really creepy</p>
<p>about is all you&rsquo;re doing is making the stomach</p>
<p>smaller so that you get full quicker</p>
<p>so all you have to do is just stop eating so much</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that simple but it&rsquo;s hitting your dopamine</p>
<p>receptors and you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>trained for that that&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>thing you know</p>
<p>we talk about</p>
<p>can you can</p>
<p>you but does the restaurant get a half portion</p>
<p>please like it&rsquo;s huge now</p>
<p>right but when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re filling up and you have this lap band</p>
<p>thing so you have this tiny baby fake stomach now</p>
<p>and that little</p>
<p>fake stomach&rsquo;s filling up do you does your dopamine</p>
<p>receptors go off do you get rewarded</p>
<p>those are the chemicals that say i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>full right and</p>
<p>what do they work and yeah</p>
<p>dude it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>every billboard</p>
<p>apparently the</p>
<p>surgery is not invasive enough that it&rsquo;s the point</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be like you</p>
<p>watch people get</p>
<p>their lap and installed in the mall like</p>
<p>laser eye surgery</p>
<p>right like i do that dental</p>
<p>wide and get your lap and</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re at it</p>
<p>right you know but isn&rsquo;t it like a</p>
<p>a shitty fix to a problem that&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>a lifestyle and diet problem somebody saw profit</p>
<p>right and yeah</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s true i mean obviously it&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>shake weight</p>
<p>yeah well huh</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s so weird though is like when</p>
<p>you talk to somebody that&rsquo;s like insanely obese they</p>
<p>act like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i know he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drunk she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drunk slut don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s not really</p>
<p>drinking it she&rsquo;s just licking the bottle</p>
<p>she licks the bottle</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s used to</p>
<p>licking cylindrical</p>
<p>things in your home</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like you talk to</p>
<p>these people and they&rsquo;re always like and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even know what the problem is it&rsquo;s thyroids it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m on a diet</p>
<p>but then you hear the</p>
<p>other stories</p>
<p>where like no dude he went to jack in the box and</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>ordered like 13</p>
<p>hamburgers i honestly</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing as the guy who just works out to the</p>
<p>point where he looks like he&rsquo;s just comedic</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s an addiction</p>
<p>yeah i honestly</p>
<p>think it is</p>
<p>yeah i guess so but that&rsquo;s a little more of that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a different kind of totally different kind of craziness</p>
<p>yeah you know the</p>
<p>crazy the fat craziness is just like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just trying to die or something</p>
<p>you know i have a friend who just i know</p>
<p>has like a massive</p>
<p>food addiction</p>
<p>and just anytime</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s around fast food</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t drive by a jack in the box</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna go in and just</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trained at a</p>
<p>young age to</p>
<p>enjoy those flavors also man it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>stealth calorie</p>
<p>thing also yeah</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s got enough</p>
<p>i mean he knows he&rsquo;s fat he&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>talks about it he&rsquo;s trying to do</p>
<p>things and never has done anything and</p>
<p>if you know in your head</p>
<p>that you should</p>
<p>stop doing this and you have a problem</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very strange that you can&rsquo;t rewire your brain</p>
<p>to recognize that like oh this is something i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>aware of now</p>
<p>now i just need to stop</p>
<p>so once people get set on a certain path</p>
<p>then at a certain</p>
<p>point they just go</p>
<p>right breaking that</p>
<p>cycle is the hardest</p>
<p>thing right but why does that</p>
<p>exist the big question is why is that in our system</p>
<p>why is it the same</p>
<p>thing that allows us to get obsessed with</p>
<p>things and get really good at things</p>
<p>is it like a bastardization how do</p>
<p>we all know what</p>
<p>hoarders are now my grandma was a hoarder when she died</p>
<p>my uncle wound up having to</p>
<p>clean out her</p>
<p>place i remember as a kid</p>
<p>going to visit her</p>
<p>and she would have</p>
<p>stacks of national geographic five feet high</p>
<p>with her goat paths we&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>navigate you go to the bathroom to pee</p>
<p>and her bathtub was used</p>
<p>to have bags of</p>
<p>clothes in it she like</p>
<p>never really</p>
<p>we always wondering why grandma</p>
<p>smelled sweaty you know</p>
<p>she wouldn&rsquo;t didn&rsquo;t wear deodorant joe my</p>
<p>grandmother was what</p>
<p>your your grandmother didn&rsquo;t wear deodorant</p>
<p>up clearly not why not</p>
<p>maybe she just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was okay to plug up her armpits with</p>
<p>stuff i&rsquo;m interested well i wear</p>
<p>deodorant i just don&rsquo;t wear antiperspirant</p>
<p>right i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>one thing is just</p>
<p>smell i was</p>
<p>just giving a shit man stopping the</p>
<p>my grandmother was</p>
<p>completely crazy</p>
<p>my grandmother when she died was exactly the same</p>
<p>thing they had</p>
<p>a they had a</p>
<p>clean out hurt my</p>
<p>uncle i think it&rsquo;s control</p>
<p>things our brother</p>
<p>right you ever</p>
<p>watch borders</p>
<p>yes usually the husband obsession</p>
<p>thing the husband some</p>
<p>train wreck and</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>south so it&rsquo;s this one thing that</p>
<p>they can control</p>
<p>in their life right</p>
<p>maybe but she was insane</p>
<p>about a bunch of different</p>
<p>things the whole</p>
<p>house was just</p>
<p>stacks of boxes and no one knew</p>
<p>where anything and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never anything</p>
<p>valuable it&rsquo;s usually just no she had a lot of</p>
<p>money that she didn&rsquo;t even probably know she had</p>
<p>like 30 000 were</p>
<p>stored in the</p>
<p>house some ridiculous number and they were broke</p>
<p>and it was really because she had</p>
<p>grown up in the recession and</p>
<p>when you grow</p>
<p>up in the recession you&rsquo;re like constantly</p>
<p>worried that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna run out of</p>
<p>money so yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our parents and our</p>
<p>grandparents are always like no you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna finish that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna take that home</p>
<p>yeah and this current</p>
<p>generations like a</p>
<p>screw it i don&rsquo;t need it</p>
<p>right she had an aneurysm she forgot where</p>
<p>everything was</p>
<p>so she had all</p>
<p>these fucking cans around the</p>
<p>house and nobody found</p>
<p>until she died</p>
<p>she was like 12 years</p>
<p>she was crazy</p>
<p>yeah they gave her 72</p>
<p>hours to live</p>
<p>she had a massive aneurysm and nobody</p>
<p>found her for a long time i</p>
<p>came outside and she was just jacked</p>
<p>and so they brought her into the hospital and</p>
<p>they were like you know</p>
<p>maybe she&rsquo;s got 72</p>
<p>hours maybe</p>
<p>she lived 12 years wow</p>
<p>sicilian peasant</p>
<p>jeans bro yeah</p>
<p>die harder yeah</p>
<p>karen rocks up hills</p>
<p>for generation</p>
<p>after generation josh ortega he</p>
<p>wrote a gears to had one</p>
<p>point where he was an</p>
<p>apartment manager at</p>
<p>apartment and he got a</p>
<p>phone call that this person had the strange</p>
<p>fluid like that they assumed there was a sewer leak</p>
<p>above them or something like that</p>
<p>dead person yeah yeah</p>
<p>he called in like it was a cop or some sort of</p>
<p>cleaner guy he touched it</p>
<p>smelled he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you got death</p>
<p>above you the</p>
<p>guy had died</p>
<p>and bloated</p>
<p>and actually soaked through boy</p>
<p>and once they took the body out josh actually had to</p>
<p>clean like all that out but you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t clean the ceiling you have to cut it out</p>
<p>does it suck through the fucking</p>
<p>plastic that</p>
<p>smell does not go away</p>
<p>right yeah it&rsquo;s in the wall</p>
<p>board yeah it&rsquo;s leaking through the wall</p>
<p>board you got a</p>
<p>body and your ceiling</p>
<p>would you live somewhere like a</p>
<p>place that that somebody&rsquo;s been murdered at</p>
<p>no you wouldn&rsquo;t no i don&rsquo;t think i</p>
<p>would and you know one of the reasons why i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i would</p>
<p>is i really honestly believe that there&rsquo;s something to</p>
<p>i think was rupert shell</p>
<p>drake who&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>evolutionary biologist</p>
<p>had this idea that</p>
<p>everything has some sort of a memory</p>
<p>i believe it was his idea</p>
<p>that memory</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>exist in the</p>
<p>human mind but that</p>
<p>objects and</p>
<p>things have memory and the</p>
<p>world around you</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one reason why you can come into certain</p>
<p>buildings and creepy shit has happened there</p>
<p>you know people are fucking</p>
<p>flakes man people will tell you they</p>
<p>could read their paw your palm or</p>
<p>i sense you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>a good person there&rsquo;s a lot of weirdos that talk</p>
<p>crazy spiritual talk</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something in</p>
<p>california there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for sure right everybody</p>
<p>out here wants to be special without working for it</p>
<p>but for sure there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>about feelings</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s some feels that you get for some</p>
<p>places and so many people have had</p>
<p>gone it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a house where someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been murdered and no one even has to tell them</p>
<p>and they feel terrible</p>
<p>about the house and the</p>
<p>house is a nice house</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been so many stories</p>
<p>about something like that i</p>
<p>just thought the wallpaper is</p>
<p>so bad that</p>
<p>somebody had a murder somebody in there</p>
<p>dude you know what i</p>
<p>think ghosts aren&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>potentially</p>
<p>these things that</p>
<p>exist around you i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s like a memory</p>
<p>right as far as a</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this awesome game</p>
<p>system shock 2</p>
<p>did you ever play it and</p>
<p>basically you had</p>
<p>these implants</p>
<p>that allowed you to see the memories of people</p>
<p>right before they died and you</p>
<p>come up it was a</p>
<p>great storytelling</p>
<p>thing because</p>
<p>there were ghosts</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t interfere with the cutscene you couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>shoot the guy before he did the thing</p>
<p>you just saw the last</p>
<p>eight seconds of his life play out</p>
<p>and he came up</p>
<p>this elevator</p>
<p>shaft and this guy in</p>
<p>front of you</p>
<p>standing there with a shotgun he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>the space station&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gone to hell i can&rsquo;t deal with this you know</p>
<p>ellie and the kids</p>
<p>forgive me you see him put the gun in his</p>
<p>mouth and it</p>
<p>phases out well</p>
<p>they use that throughout</p>
<p>right as an amazing</p>
<p>storytelling technique</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s a good idea</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s classic</p>
<p>stuff man right</p>
<p>that brought it back to gaming</p>
<p>right there did you see that mario kart</p>
<p>started that</p>
<p>with the ghost around the track yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what that was</p>
<p>now you compete</p>
<p>against yourself right</p>
<p>exactly dude</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>figuring out how to</p>
<p>basically have</p>
<p>different type of events happen online you know like</p>
<p>angry birds you were saying now they&rsquo;re doing like</p>
<p>the holiday</p>
<p>edition right</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re handling it</p>
<p>right too man</p>
<p>those people didn&rsquo;t charge anything</p>
<p>for that game and then they&rsquo;ve been updating it</p>
<p>you know patching it i would</p>
<p>if i finished</p>
<p>angry birds and then there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>screen come up this</p>
<p>came up and said hey you can have 30 more</p>
<p>levels for 30</p>
<p>bucks that would have been like yes yes</p>
<p>my first born please</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re treating it</p>
<p>right though and i mean is</p>
<p>is that how they do it yeah they make money see</p>
<p>they get it they sold the game</p>
<p>first they&rsquo;re giving a lot of weight for free</p>
<p>right now but</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>just saying that they have some like 99 cent</p>
<p>eagle that&rsquo;ll take out the</p>
<p>whole level for you that they&rsquo;ve been planning</p>
<p>but they have that and they also</p>
<p>had like the halloween pack and then they also have</p>
<p>this whole new christmas</p>
<p>pack and they&rsquo;re not giving you can&rsquo;t just play all the</p>
<p>levels it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an advent calendar soon you can only play one</p>
<p>level on each day right</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t just burn through them all in one</p>
<p>night but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>such a well designed game that you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna keep coming back</p>
<p>right totally</p>
<p>so simple perfect kind of ios</p>
<p>gamers do do do do do</p>
<p>definitely tap and</p>
<p>swipe baby that&rsquo;s the way to go</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s turning into applications too have you</p>
<p>noticed that nowadays</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not paying money for</p>
<p>magazines you&rsquo;re not paying for</p>
<p>money for this</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re now having applications and</p>
<p>apps are just</p>
<p>fancy programs</p>
<p>right that are just</p>
<p>that are just well</p>
<p>maintained well maintained</p>
<p>personal you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>these apps with you on the road a lot of people are</p>
<p>concerned though on the internet</p>
<p>right now that like it&rsquo;s not it no longer is a</p>
<p>series of linked websites it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>siege it&rsquo;s facebook it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>these various kind of silos of information</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>self contained</p>
<p>within that right</p>
<p>the thing that</p>
<p>again i like facebook i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s cool you know i like</p>
<p>stalking people i went to high</p>
<p>school with it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>at the same time</p>
<p>like the fact that</p>
<p>every website i go to now has like</p>
<p>facebook integrated now</p>
<p>right we&rsquo;re like i don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>want somebody knowing i go to one website accidentally</p>
<p>click like yeah</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>and then it broadcast</p>
<p>cuz you know</p>
<p>and comments you can make comments on these</p>
<p>oh absolutely</p>
<p>and you do it through your facebook</p>
<p>yeah log in your facebook i&rsquo;m like wait a minute</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s my password</p>
<p>going how do you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>never for you connecting</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m allowing you to connect through</p>
<p>my facebook so here&rsquo;s a question for you okay if you</p>
<p>could have perfect</p>
<p>memory like day to day you will remember</p>
<p>everything when you were 10 years old</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>but it had advertising in it</p>
<p>would you do it</p>
<p>it already did dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very good question so like you</p>
<p>can be like i</p>
<p>wanna go from august 4th 1974</p>
<p>3 pm they&rsquo;re like okay this is sponsored by gecko</p>
<p>who you know</p>
<p>go to gecko com and you&rsquo;re like fine fine whatever</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re like bam</p>
<p>now you have</p>
<p>that day in</p>
<p>front of you like on</p>
<p>video of course for sure</p>
<p>cause we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>about memories right</p>
<p>no doubt or that thought at</p>
<p>least you would</p>
<p>definitely but then you</p>
<p>would say well</p>
<p>where is this stored is this non</p>
<p>local no no no</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like divvik</p>
<p>circuit city yeah that&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>story on io</p>
<p>mine that pull up this shit on my own</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re able</p>
<p>to surgically kind of remove certain memories from mice</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>started to come through some of the</p>
<p>technology like</p>
<p>eternal sunshine</p>
<p>of the spotless mind so if you&rsquo;re a ptsd sufferer</p>
<p>and you have traumatic</p>
<p>events in afghanistan they can surgically remove the</p>
<p>stuff that happened to you so that you could</p>
<p>move on since</p>
<p>right yeah but</p>
<p>what if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some dude that you fucking hate in afghanistan all</p>
<p>sudden you&rsquo;re in new york and he sees you like</p>
<p>your mother fuck</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like i don&rsquo;t even know this dude</p>
<p>right you know that&rsquo;s not cool</p>
<p>yeah this guy</p>
<p>would hate you and he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be following you around you&rsquo;re like what is this dude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>deal or you</p>
<p>get out of a</p>
<p>bad relationship and you killed everyone he knows man</p>
<p>and he made me make the iron man outfit</p>
<p>right yeah you</p>
<p>get out of bad relationship and meanwhile she</p>
<p>still remembers you and she&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>sharpening up her daggers yeah she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>traveling over the country she&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>find you now the condom can</p>
<p>break to get you arrested for</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s got all sorts of outfit she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>blade and shit she&rsquo;s got a</p>
<p>trench coat filled with weapons</p>
<p>going to take you out</p>
<p>but i mean that</p>
<p>the fact that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to make</p>
<p>these breakthroughs right</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>breakthrough nanotechnology that happened i</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>about a year ago</p>
<p>where they were able to figure out</p>
<p>how to actually have</p>
<p>cells that were bonded in an ejection that</p>
<p>would actually then melt</p>
<p>a tumor that was a</p>
<p>tumorous growth</p>
<p>without any sort of radiation</p>
<p>treatment or</p>
<p>anything like that</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re right in the verge</p>
<p>right now right like</p>
<p>of so many diseases and</p>
<p>everything like that like it</p>
<p>might actually happen within our lifetimes and forget</p>
<p>about your kids and it&rsquo;s not just happening in</p>
<p>technology it&rsquo;s happening in space</p>
<p>like all the shit that they&rsquo;re finding out about</p>
<p>space as well are</p>
<p>you following</p>
<p>any of the astronauts in the international</p>
<p>space station on twitter</p>
<p>no there&rsquo;s that guy who</p>
<p>dig up his name</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been just tweeting</p>
<p>photos of like amazing like like sun</p>
<p>or you know</p>
<p>sunsets from from</p>
<p>space from the</p>
<p>space station like somehow</p>
<p>they hooked up you know as an internet</p>
<p>connection up there and he&rsquo;s like we</p>
<p>have wi fi in space</p>
<p>he does man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like hey look</p>
<p>at this look at</p>
<p>this is names</p>
<p>i guess that you</p>
<p>sound sochi</p>
<p>naguchi it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>oh yeah at astro</p>
<p>s o i c h i</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got three hundred thousand followers and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>hey look we&rsquo;re taking off and go to the</p>
<p>space station</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just got this following and like he&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>space travel cool</p>
<p>again right</p>
<p>whereas you joke</p>
<p>about kids who want to be</p>
<p>mma fighters</p>
<p>video game designers</p>
<p>now this guy&rsquo;s doing that for the job</p>
<p>right which i</p>
<p>think is really cool</p>
<p>what do you think</p>
<p>about space porn</p>
<p>yeah i actually</p>
<p>do follow that guy i have seen some of his cool</p>
<p>stuff i forgot i follow</p>
<p>so many people i forgot</p>
<p>they compile</p>
<p>it on the huffington post once in a</p>
<p>while you just look at it just</p>
<p>scroll through</p>
<p>just like this is amazing there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things that are just so</p>
<p>crazy that are</p>
<p>not even understood</p>
<p>about this world</p>
<p>the whole like</p>
<p>arsenic based life form</p>
<p>stuff that came out with three yeah</p>
<p>do you know what they</p>
<p>found out that that was bad science</p>
<p>really yeah that was very poorly written in that</p>
<p>nasa rushed</p>
<p>to try to get this</p>
<p>press conference or this</p>
<p>press release out there before it got</p>
<p>really reviewed by all the</p>
<p>right people</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>ton of criticism all over the internet</p>
<p>that what they did was</p>
<p>they drew some really unscientific</p>
<p>conclusions and</p>
<p>and kind of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not disproven</p>
<p>completely but it&rsquo;s not proven either</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not ready yet</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kinda like</p>
<p>the edge of</p>
<p>contact where they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>really sure if jodie foster really went to the other</p>
<p>world there&rsquo;s some nutty shit</p>
<p>going on man have you</p>
<p>heard about this new</p>
<p>object that they</p>
<p>found outside of</p>
<p>pluto that&rsquo;s jupiter sized</p>
<p>and really just out of nowhere</p>
<p>way the fuck out there</p>
<p>probably as far or more</p>
<p>from jupiter as we are from jupiter</p>
<p>or excuse me from</p>
<p>pluto rather as we are from pluto</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s outside of</p>
<p>pluto and it&rsquo;s gigantic</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know what it is they have no idea</p>
<p>where it is exactly</p>
<p>but they know there&rsquo;s something out there</p>
<p>pretty sure well i know you&rsquo;ve probably talked</p>
<p>about this in your</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re big on aliens the</p>
<p>whole idea of stephen</p>
<p>hawking was saying like</p>
<p>know if aliens actually find us</p>
<p>first then it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a situation</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re the native americans</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s everybody else coming over from europe</p>
<p>and that didn&rsquo;t turn out very well</p>
<p>or were monkeys</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not even native americans man</p>
<p>native americans were at</p>
<p>least human</p>
<p>you know i mean if</p>
<p>something is a million years more advanced than us it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like us collecting bugs</p>
<p>like i said</p>
<p>your kids are probably</p>
<p>gonna live to be</p>
<p>150 plus it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>to see the city not you</p>
<p>if not you yeah</p>
<p>who knows man who knows what the fuck is</p>
<p>going on the the</p>
<p>breakthroughs they&rsquo;re coming to live to one</p>
<p>fifty working</p>
<p>video games</p>
<p>would you stress</p>
<p>yeah maybe you&rsquo;ll just kick back and go jay z</p>
<p>style once you you know</p>
<p>compile all your</p>
<p>money do do do</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>because the developers</p>
<p>the people who have the</p>
<p>money are the people who put up the money</p>
<p>and those are the people that make all the</p>
<p>money is that what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>much harder for the developers to go jay z</p>
<p>style it is yeah</p>
<p>well you get to the</p>
<p>point where it&rsquo;s so hard for one person to really</p>
<p>break out and do something</p>
<p>especially the aaa space</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>where used games</p>
<p>and rentals are eating up so much of the market</p>
<p>that for somebody to spend</p>
<p>millions and millions of dollars to</p>
<p>make a game and then to actually launch it with all the</p>
<p>marketing is a huge risk and then so a lot</p>
<p>of people are running to mobile they&rsquo;re running to all</p>
<p>these different kind of</p>
<p>places right</p>
<p>but i would</p>
<p>think that at a certain</p>
<p>level like your level</p>
<p>when you have a certain</p>
<p>reputation behind you</p>
<p>that it might be easier for a</p>
<p>bunch of people to come to you and say listen man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a proven commodity why don&rsquo;t you get your team</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll give you guys a</p>
<p>cut of the publishing hypothetically i knew at an early</p>
<p>age that by doing the pr</p>
<p>and being able to have a little bit of a theater</p>
<p>background and go on</p>
<p>stage this stuff</p>
<p>would get me a certain amount of</p>
<p>leverage and then by working with</p>
<p>talent to people and making</p>
<p>great games i have</p>
<p>built a brand for myself</p>
<p>so hypothetically i</p>
<p>could probably go</p>
<p>knock on a lot of publishers</p>
<p>store tomorrow be like just give me a</p>
<p>bunch of money let me</p>
<p>build a team do whatever i want</p>
<p>the problem is</p>
<p>epic takes good care of me</p>
<p>and i work with everybody and i get do the shit i want</p>
<p>and i you know i&rsquo;ve got a</p>
<p>great setup so</p>
<p>why fuck with</p>
<p>it for something that may or may not work out right</p>
<p>that explosion was</p>
<p>brian fucking around in the background</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think that the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s coming to an end</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think the current</p>
<p>lifespan of the consoles are like</p>
<p>until the new we</p>
<p>for the first time ever in</p>
<p>video games we&rsquo;ve just gotten past the five year life</p>
<p>cycle yeah it seems like i think</p>
<p>a reason yet is</p>
<p>i think for</p>
<p>a lot of people graphics are cool good enough yeah</p>
<p>right and like</p>
<p>what if you were to put something new on tv that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what is the current</p>
<p>state of the art</p>
<p>versus the latest</p>
<p>playstation xbox game</p>
<p>would it pass the mom test</p>
<p>would your mom look</p>
<p>at that and go to that looks amazing compared to that</p>
<p>maybe maybe not give it a couple years yes</p>
<p>right so right now</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>enough you know you have all the motion controls and</p>
<p>everything like that they can kind of keep everybody</p>
<p>occupied what do you</p>
<p>think the next</p>
<p>thing is what do you</p>
<p>think is just</p>
<p>gonna be faster and bigger or do you</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be the 3d</p>
<p>more ingrainally yeah my personal</p>
<p>opinions fast as hell</p>
<p>avatar style</p>
<p>graphics avatar</p>
<p>level of graphics</p>
<p>something that is always connected to the internet</p>
<p>is it ever going to come to a time</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s easier to do than it is now</p>
<p>in regards to</p>
<p>technology building it creating it</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s ways that</p>
<p>you can procedurally create content</p>
<p>right like will wright did</p>
<p>spore where</p>
<p>like a lot of</p>
<p>the textures</p>
<p>were automatically created so we figured out what</p>
<p>an algorithm</p>
<p>would be for</p>
<p>grass and wood and</p>
<p>things like that and there&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>not a huge but there&rsquo;s a subset</p>
<p>of people that work in that</p>
<p>technology like</p>
<p>okay just hit a button and just generate</p>
<p>fifty types of wood for me so we don&rsquo;t actually have to</p>
<p>build it right</p>
<p>then you get</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a certain library of do i really need to remodel the</p>
<p>couch for the</p>
<p>eight billionth time</p>
<p>like work smarter not harder</p>
<p>right figure out ways to use modular architecture</p>
<p>do you really need</p>
<p>fifty columns of</p>
<p>different types or you can just spit them all out right</p>
<p>the key is gonna be</p>
<p>figuring out you know like</p>
<p>how to craft that within a certain</p>
<p>financial model</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the billion dollar question</p>
<p>how do you provide</p>
<p>aaa content that makes</p>
<p>sense right like how do you remain</p>
<p>profitable well there eventually you</p>
<p>think would be</p>
<p>software that</p>
<p>makes it easy like the average person can create games</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we do that&rsquo;s half of our business</p>
<p>you could go to</p>
<p>udk com and download the same</p>
<p>exact stuff we use to</p>
<p>build our games really for free</p>
<p>so anybody can for free go and take your</p>
<p>technology and make</p>
<p>their own game they can</p>
<p>the problem is of course if you</p>
<p>start making</p>
<p>money with it then you have to talk to us</p>
<p>about officially</p>
<p>licensing it wow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty fucking that&rsquo;s how it works actually</p>
<p>never really knew that but</p>
<p>the reason why this is smart</p>
<p>is because you have so many college campuses</p>
<p>out there that want to find a solution how do we</p>
<p>train college kids</p>
<p>to learn how to use this</p>
<p>technology but how</p>
<p>hard is it how hard is your</p>
<p>builder like</p>
<p>is it a hard</p>
<p>builder killed for</p>
<p>these tools when i was 17</p>
<p>yes that they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you know making games hard right like</p>
<p>stuff to know what to do but</p>
<p>if i was myself 17</p>
<p>i would have been able to do such</p>
<p>crazy shit i had to</p>
<p>learn visual</p>
<p>basic and get a programmer</p>
<p>the programmer</p>
<p>i did jazz jackrabbit with back in the day is the</p>
<p>guy who works on killzone now wow yeah it&rsquo;s just one of</p>
<p>those weird</p>
<p>professor act</p>
<p>magneto type situations right</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cool guy</p>
<p>great dutch dude</p>
<p>um but yeah like you can just go download it now and</p>
<p>start building a game so get</p>
<p>these kids to</p>
<p>tweet me all the time</p>
<p>how do we get</p>
<p>the business how do we get the business i&rsquo;m like go to</p>
<p>udk download it and</p>
<p>start building something</p>
<p>figure out what you&rsquo;re good at and work your</p>
<p>ass off and be better than everybody else we&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>playing that hard shaft</p>
<p>i mean my mine</p>
<p>shaft game that&rsquo;s on those</p>
<p>holy floridian</p>
<p>yeah slip there brian</p>
<p>kidding fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you son</p>
<p>a big black dog is it king kong</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s minecraft right</p>
<p>so have you been playing that at all i</p>
<p>heard that it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>first pc game i paid</p>
<p>money for in years really alright so we almost</p>
<p>got through this</p>
<p>whole episode without anybody talking</p>
<p>about big black dick wow</p>
<p>i apologize</p>
<p>that was a horrible slip</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those where</p>
<p>he brought up big</p>
<p>black dicks though it&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s impossible</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s embedded into our</p>
<p>system yeah</p>
<p>we attract dick talks</p>
<p>weave through</p>
<p>the dna the</p>
<p>black kind so is it</p>
<p>mineshaft how do i okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go from big</p>
<p>black clocks to minecraft</p>
<p>minecraft it&rsquo;s not even</p>
<p>shaft so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this game joe this kid</p>
<p>this kid decided to make this game out of his garage</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s making god</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know the numbers he&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>money handover fist</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s basically a</p>
<p>world where you</p>
<p>initially start off and you can</p>
<p>build cubes of different</p>
<p>materials in</p>
<p>front of you</p>
<p>and then build anything you want</p>
<p>basically so imagine</p>
<p>building 3d</p>
<p>pixels and there&rsquo;s people who have</p>
<p>built like the</p>
<p>earth in this game</p>
<p>right and then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this mode where</p>
<p>night time comes and</p>
<p>you have to eventually figure out how to survive your</p>
<p>first night and</p>
<p>start building like a workbench and</p>
<p>build all these different</p>
<p>things and it</p>
<p>starts getting deeper and deeper i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t gotten</p>
<p>too deep into it but it&rsquo;s become this kind of</p>
<p>phenomenon he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about valve</p>
<p>about doing something with it</p>
<p>and what you see</p>
<p>right now is</p>
<p>these kind of little</p>
<p>micro developers who are having</p>
<p>success right</p>
<p>the guy who did</p>
<p>braid jonathan blow you have the team who made portal</p>
<p>was like a handful</p>
<p>of kids who made an independent game that then they</p>
<p>started working with</p>
<p>valve right</p>
<p>the guy who did limbo</p>
<p>the team who did limbo they were at the independent</p>
<p>games festival we saw that and were like this game is</p>
<p>great and then</p>
<p>every time i love supporting</p>
<p>these indie kids</p>
<p>cause you never know</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come out of them</p>
<p>cause they can</p>
<p>often take risks that we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cause you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>in their garage and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>building in how</p>
<p>hard would it be for someone to make a</p>
<p>movie with your game engine</p>
<p>pretty easy</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>wow yeah whoa</p>
<p>they call it machinima</p>
<p>oh yeah mash</p>
<p>ma yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to the awards ceremony</p>
<p>yeah they call it</p>
<p>spell that i always call it mashima</p>
<p>but i don&rsquo;t know mash</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s the art of</p>
<p>the art of machinima</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the art of a</p>
<p>virtual camera</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s ch i</p>
<p>machina</p>
<p>ma s s l i t</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen some old ones</p>
<p>done with old game engines that looked really hokey</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good but the game engines of</p>
<p>today they&rsquo;re so sophisticated</p>
<p>yeah that was what red</p>
<p>vs blue was</p>
<p>right that was that whole web</p>
<p>series that became huge</p>
<p>these guys the</p>
<p>halo characters and they just made him talk of</p>
<p>these incredibly</p>
<p>funny situations</p>
<p>you need to have a sitcom of your characters having</p>
<p>wives and stuff in that form</p>
<p>we will absolutely do that in our</p>
<p>spare time yes no no</p>
<p>you just hired two</p>
<p>high school</p>
<p>and efforts and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hired two high</p>
<p>school kids</p>
<p>to do it yeah</p>
<p>when you give them</p>
<p>supervised a week</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have the</p>
<p>marine guys pulling</p>
<p>their assholes</p>
<p>apart and the goatse</p>
<p>pose you know</p>
<p>the beauty of so many of</p>
<p>those internet memes is i</p>
<p>could sit there eating a</p>
<p>giant bowl of cereal and just</p>
<p>watch it and not even</p>
<p>care because it&rsquo;s been sent to you so many times right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the other</p>
<p>thing you know we were talking</p>
<p>about kids getting</p>
<p>freaked out by</p>
<p>all the the the</p>
<p>input that they have today</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna get desensitize a little</p>
<p>quicker than us</p>
<p>if you can handle it kids can handle it just</p>
<p>gonna be trickier</p>
<p>trigger in the beginning but i will tell you</p>
<p>bringing it full circle like</p>
<p>every time i see real life like you</p>
<p>know violence in</p>
<p>front of me</p>
<p>see somebody get hit at a bar it makes me nauseous</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>it does my problem is i&rsquo;m you so used to it</p>
<p>right i see people get beat up and it&rsquo;s so normal</p>
<p>my wife cut her head</p>
<p>and she opened up</p>
<p>the back of her car you know</p>
<p>the hood and banged her head on it she accidentally</p>
<p>and she that</p>
<p>skull bled no it wasn&rsquo;t that bad but</p>
<p>started bleeding did i talk</p>
<p>about this already no</p>
<p>it started bleeding</p>
<p>and i just looked it</p>
<p>up yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well cut you</p>
<p>no for her it&rsquo;s like this traumatic thing</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like they&rsquo;re not even</p>
<p>gonna stop this</p>
<p>fight this is nothing</p>
<p>you know she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna tap out this is</p>
<p>ridiculous this is barely a cut</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s only got</p>
<p>facial wounds</p>
<p>bleed a lot you know i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>thinking shit i</p>
<p>might have to</p>
<p>take her to the hospital for this little baby cut</p>
<p>is she gonna</p>
<p>freak out or she</p>
<p>gonna let me</p>
<p>stick like crazy glue in there and glue it together</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i would do</p>
<p>those my head i&rsquo;d be like just drop some</p>
<p>crazy husband and</p>
<p>husband at least</p>
<p>that shit right here dude</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they do man quit crying you pansy</p>
<p>cuts when you get cuts they put</p>
<p>crazy people</p>
<p>on it they push it together it&rsquo;s a little one yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been some dinner granny</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>my point is i&rsquo;m so used to trauma</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so used to like dudes getting</p>
<p>punched in the face and well you have that kind of</p>
<p>fighting upbringing constantly dude</p>
<p>again it comes back to boston</p>
<p>once there&rsquo;s that but there&rsquo;s also working for the</p>
<p>ufc for over a thousand</p>
<p>fights being</p>
<p>three feet away from</p>
<p>these murderers</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>trained killers</p>
<p>punting each</p>
<p>other in the head</p>
<p>you know i mean i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen so many dudes just get fucking flatlined what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the what&rsquo;s the lifespan of a</p>
<p>fighter with the amount of head damage</p>
<p>everything right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good question</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think we know no i&rsquo;m not saying lifespan</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying as far as like how long can you actually</p>
<p>fight before it</p>
<p>starts to become an abuse</p>
<p>have you seen</p>
<p>quite as it</p>
<p>becomes like a visible</p>
<p>issue like you</p>
<p>start to see</p>
<p>things get a little off i have seen guys go from being</p>
<p>absolutely normal to</p>
<p>absolutely not normal yeah</p>
<p>absolutely normal to frightening</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen that i&rsquo;ve seen the full spectrum</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s very shocking</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve seen also guys like</p>
<p>randy couture</p>
<p>who get out of it with not a</p>
<p>not a single problem</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>randy is so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s super lucid</p>
<p>you talk to him he&rsquo;s very intelligent very</p>
<p>aware and he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>knocked out a couple of times he&rsquo;s recognized how to</p>
<p>build a brand though right</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s also he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>smart guy he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t take unnecessary punishment some guys</p>
<p>they try to be more</p>
<p>exciting so they&rsquo;ll take unnecessary punishment</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll like</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t fight strategically</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll fight like in an aggressive</p>
<p>style and an attempt to overwhelm</p>
<p>this person with</p>
<p>their physicality</p>
<p>and when you do that you know it makes for</p>
<p>exciting fights for the fans</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very dangerous for you it&rsquo;s very dangerous</p>
<p>for your long term mental health</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a management issue</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d assume i mean</p>
<p>fighters have</p>
<p>their managers who kind of advise them on</p>
<p>these impossible you can&rsquo;t tell a guy what to do</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not gonna listen to you if he&rsquo;s the guy who wears his</p>
<p>underwear when</p>
<p>he gets in that fucking cage and they shut that door</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna listen</p>
<p>yeah the fighters will</p>
<p>take they&rsquo;ll take direction as far as</p>
<p>coaching they&rsquo;ll take direction as far as technique</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll take direction as far as you</p>
<p>know they have a guy that they really</p>
<p>trust and he</p>
<p>raises them correctly and</p>
<p>trains them to be a good fighter</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll go out there</p>
<p>with a healthy respect for</p>
<p>the art form and they&rsquo;ll go out there and do it right</p>
<p>but if you get a guy</p>
<p>and he just that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how he develops he develops and like this is his style</p>
<p>and then you try to</p>
<p>coach him it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know good luck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>do tricks that</p>
<p>we so see some</p>
<p>fighters and all they want to do is brawl</p>
<p>and they brawl</p>
<p>every fight</p>
<p>and then you see</p>
<p>other fighters</p>
<p>where they skillfully</p>
<p>avoid strikes take the guy down strangle them</p>
<p>you never see</p>
<p>very rarely i</p>
<p>should say i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t say never</p>
<p>you very rarely</p>
<p>see someone go from being the meathead brawler</p>
<p>to being the</p>
<p>super intelligent</p>
<p>ultra skilled</p>
<p>technician that</p>
<p>gets through a</p>
<p>fight and takes</p>
<p>no damage yeah imagine you want to be surgical</p>
<p>about it right</p>
<p>you should yeah well you should</p>
<p>treat it like what it is it&rsquo;s a martial</p>
<p>art and it&rsquo;s a game and the game is do punishment</p>
<p>without getting punishment done to you be superior in</p>
<p>every single aspect of the game</p>
<p>be able to force your will</p>
<p>on that person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the intelligent part about it</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also when you get</p>
<p>fight of the</p>
<p>night bonuses</p>
<p>and you want to make the</p>
<p>crowd cheer</p>
<p>and get that adrenaline going</p>
<p>and a lot of guys</p>
<p>they love to say they finish</p>
<p>fights they go out there and they</p>
<p>put it on the line and it does make for a more exciting</p>
<p>fight that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely true</p>
<p>but i had this</p>
<p>exact conversation with a guy</p>
<p>named john donnaher</p>
<p>who is this</p>
<p>pretty infamous</p>
<p>jujutsu instructor</p>
<p>really super</p>
<p>super smart guy</p>
<p>and he and i both agreed that the most important</p>
<p>thing is even though it&rsquo;s good to be</p>
<p>exciting as a</p>
<p>fighter it&rsquo;s good to you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>please the crowd and it makes the</p>
<p>sport more popular and</p>
<p>everything i absolutely</p>
<p>agree with that too but</p>
<p>the most important</p>
<p>thing is to be</p>
<p>very skilled and to be the most</p>
<p>skilled and do the</p>
<p>exact right</p>
<p>thing that you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing in order to</p>
<p>apply damage but take little in return</p>
<p>and when you</p>
<p>take unnecessary risks and you do something in</p>
<p>an unsmart manner</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re degrading your art you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watering down your purpose you&rsquo;re doing something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>optimal way to do it it&rsquo;s not the artistic way to do it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not fighting it correctly</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like riding a wave</p>
<p>when you get off that wave what do you want</p>
<p>to do you want a face plan to the rocks of course not</p>
<p>no you want to</p>
<p>write you want to ride that</p>
<p>bitch and be perfect that&rsquo;s the way it does</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t speak of it man it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a world that set my own</p>
<p>so alien yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s alien to me and i&rsquo;ve done martial arts my</p>
<p>whole life but i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never fought in the ufc yeah</p>
<p>you know and being around</p>
<p>over at least a thousand</p>
<p>fights you know</p>
<p>yeah but we were talking about like</p>
<p>guys like you know like being used to</p>
<p>trauma i&rsquo;m way too used to</p>
<p>trauma yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m so normal</p>
<p>for me i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been at bars and dudes are beating the fuck out of each</p>
<p>other i&rsquo;m like yeah</p>
<p>these guys hit each other yeah</p>
<p>keep your hands up dude you know i&rsquo;m a fucking pussy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the irony</p>
<p>right is like you know we do</p>
<p>these games of these</p>
<p>for your badass guys</p>
<p>just you know tearing arms off be people</p>
<p>death of it and like</p>
<p>you see anything in real life and it&rsquo;s just like oh</p>
<p>jesus i get some getting sick right</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a good question man so like</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think about this</p>
<p>whole debate</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>this this i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty silly and</p>
<p>kind of like not</p>
<p>not well thought out</p>
<p>this idea that violent games make people violent</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true i think</p>
<p>whatever happened to crazy</p>
<p>first and foremost</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s a chris rocks kind of</p>
<p>thing about it</p>
<p>i honestly think it&rsquo;s a situation</p>
<p>that they relieve more stress than they cause yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cathartic</p>
<p>thing like and there&rsquo;s a certain</p>
<p>sick type of mind that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>drawn to a certain type of</p>
<p>entertainment that was just</p>
<p>predisposed to that</p>
<p>right yeah and that person sick period yeah</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get it&rsquo;s always the what violent games was</p>
<p>hitler playing</p>
<p>right that kind of</p>
<p>thing right it&rsquo;s just like dude i mean</p>
<p>right we cannot create a society</p>
<p>based upon a lowest common denominator of</p>
<p>entertainment thank you</p>
<p>right like a</p>
<p>scene or anything or anything it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s entertainment for kids is</p>
<p>entertainment for</p>
<p>adults and that&rsquo;s the way the</p>
<p>world works i mean it</p>
<p>should be that way with</p>
<p>everything access to information you know propaganda</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>program society</p>
<p>for the lowest common denominator</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>allowing intelligent people are not</p>
<p>going to be affected if you&rsquo;re trying to restrict</p>
<p>their access to</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>video games and i personally</p>
<p>think the market will bear</p>
<p>what the market will bear right like</p>
<p>you look at what we do with the stylized violence of</p>
<p>these big giant guys in</p>
<p>space armor ripping the arms off lizard men</p>
<p>if you there&rsquo;s a game</p>
<p>about a guy</p>
<p>on flatbush avenue with the yankees</p>
<p>hat pulling off the arm of somebody else with the red</p>
<p>sox hat like in it was depicted real like be kind like</p>
<p>but then the violence in</p>
<p>grand theft auto on the</p>
<p>other hand plays very</p>
<p>well because it&rsquo;s done within the context of the story</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>comedically</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re running over a hooker something like that</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>people if people are</p>
<p>but when you</p>
<p>say that the okay but</p>
<p>but what if</p>
<p>their government</p>
<p>steps in i mean there&rsquo;s been many times</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s been talk about</p>
<p>legislating</p>
<p>the content of</p>
<p>video games and making sure that there&rsquo;s rules</p>
<p>what you can and can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do there are already rules though that&rsquo;s the thing that</p>
<p>people forget is the fact that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rating system</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a rating</p>
<p>system there&rsquo;s a parental restrictions on the consoles</p>
<p>which are very easy to set</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also the fact that the games cost a certain amount of</p>
<p>money in order to get access to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s multiple gateways there that are in</p>
<p>place and on</p>
<p>top of all of that there is of course the parenting</p>
<p>issue but is there a situation like there is with</p>
<p>movies where they tell you hey you can&rsquo;t release this</p>
<p>unless you cut out</p>
<p>a bunch of shit or it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like x ray it is</p>
<p>that an x ray</p>
<p>it is reviewed right</p>
<p>it is viewed</p>
<p>by the effect</p>
<p>is there an</p>
<p>nc 17 or something</p>
<p>you can get an</p>
<p>adults only rating but it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>curse it&rsquo;s a kiss of</p>
<p>death much like the</p>
<p>nc 17 whereas you know you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna be at walmart you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna be in</p>
<p>you can mass</p>
<p>effect isn&rsquo;t that at walmart mass</p>
<p>effect or whatever the one with the prostitution and</p>
<p>add and that was</p>
<p>which will have</p>
<p>mass effect</p>
<p>mass effect</p>
<p>did have some</p>
<p>sex type question it but there&rsquo;s i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s prostitution in any mess now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of amazing that you can have</p>
<p>chainsaws in the end of your gun</p>
<p>where you can cut people in half but you can&rsquo;t fuck</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s well that&rsquo;s america that&rsquo;s amazing</p>
<p>that thing or something like that you think</p>
<p>all right we&rsquo;re back okay anyway</p>
