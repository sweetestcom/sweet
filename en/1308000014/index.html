    <p>Hey, everybody. Welcome back. Besties are back and it&rsquo;s a bestie Spacksgiving. Congratulations</p>
<p>to the queen of quinoa. His second company, David Freeberg, announces today, hours before</p>
<p>the taping of this special Thanksgiving pod, that he is taking Metro Mile public through</p>
<p>a SPAC and that besties see. And here is the quote that as only Chamath can tweet, Buffett</p>
<p>had Geico. I pick Metro Mile. I would just like to say that&rsquo;s how you move markets. LeBron</p>
<p>James has three rings. Freeberg, tell us what is Metro Mile. And well, this isn&rsquo;t a self</p>
<p>promoting podcast, is it? No, but I think it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s your second company. I started the</p>
<p>company in 2011 when I was running Climate, when I was the CEO there. Climate was offering</p>
<p>insurance at the time. We learned a lot about the insurance markets and figured like, hey,</p>
<p>telematics or connecting cars to the internet is going to be a big deal. And we&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>able to completely change the auto insurance industry. So we set up this company. I was the</p>
<p>chairman from the founding in 2011 and been chairman and I&rsquo;ve been an active investor in the</p>
<p>business in every round since then. So the business has built some really compelling value</p>
<p>proposition for customers and it&rsquo;s got really good unit economics and it&rsquo;s needed its last round of</p>
<p>capital to get profitable. And turns out, as we were thinking about that this summer, that a SPAC</p>
<p>was a really good path for the business given the inflection point it&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>And the basic premise of the business is, instead of paying for insurance by month or time period,</p>
<p>the innovation here is you pay per mile.</p>
<p>Yeah, insurance today is like, you know, you fill out a form and you get a price for insurance, you</p>
<p>pay that rate for six months of coverage. But you know, depending on when you&rsquo;re driving and how</p>
<p>much you&rsquo;re driving, you should be paying a different price, right? So we kind of changed the</p>
<p>model to a rate per mile. And so if you don&rsquo;t drive, you save, you know, so the average customer</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t drive a lot with Metro Mile, they save 47% over what they were paying with like Geico or</p>
<p>Progressive Reinsurance.</p>
<p>And you do that with that ODB port?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little plug in device. And increasingly, we&rsquo;re actually doing it directly by connecting to</p>
<p>cars, direct through Ford, and a couple other big automotive OEMs now have this ability to send the</p>
<p>data directly out of the car because they&rsquo;re all internet connected now. So that allows us to just</p>
<p>basically, you know, see how many miles you&rsquo;re driving. And the rate per mile is what we bill you</p>
<p>each month times the number of miles you drove on your on your car.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t mention how you drive. I think that was a controversial concept for a while. You know,</p>
<p>if you speed if you ride, we</p>
<p>roadmap or</p>
<p>yeah, that is part of it today. But frankly, 70% of the price difference you get in auto insurance is</p>
<p>from the number of miles you drive and only 30% is really in this variance around behavior. You know,</p>
<p>most people are generally pretty good drivers. So believe it or not. So the real variance in terms of,</p>
<p>you know, your risk to the insurance company is how many miles you drive. So that really is the</p>
<p>predominant factors if we can accurately track that. Now, what&rsquo;s interesting is like in a world of</p>
<p>autonomous cars, where you&rsquo;re like turning on the car to be autonomous or fully self driving at some</p>
<p>point, you know, it&rsquo;s on and off, you should be getting a different rate for those miles, right. So</p>
<p>if the car is if your Tesla on autopilot on the freeway, that should be safer than you on the</p>
<p>freeway, you shouldn&rsquo;t be paying as much, even better, you can kind of think about how this moves</p>
<p>into a world where everything is dynamically priced, and dynamically build, usage priced, usage</p>
<p>priced, and that and also fair. So you know, if you&rsquo;re a good driver, and you&rsquo;re driving well, or</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re using autonomous features, you shouldn&rsquo;t pay as much. And ultimately, that translates, you</p>
<p>know, into a truly kind of more dynamic service. And that&rsquo;s really where the world has to go.</p>
<p>Because those low mileage drivers, or those good drivers, or those drivers using autonomous</p>
<p>should be paying considerably less. So they&rsquo;ll start using our service. And that&rsquo;ll force the</p>
<p>other guys to raise their rates. And it creates this huge, you know, kind of market mode. Great.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in the we&rsquo;re in the we&rsquo;re in the very early days. I mean, it&rsquo;s like the first inning</p>
<p>still. So we&rsquo;re, you know, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re just getting going.</p>
<p>Chamath, you chose to do a pipe with the SPAC explain to the audience what a pipe is for people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know, and what you loved about metro mile.</p>
<p>Sure. I think the what is a pipe? A pipe is a private investment in a public enterprise. And</p>
<p>basically, what that means is that you&rsquo;re making the round bigger, right? So it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>Sequoia does your Series A and invest 10 million, I would come in and put another 10 million. And</p>
<p>now your Series A is 20 million. Same terms as the Sequoia&rsquo;s round, except you&rsquo;re now just grossing</p>
<p>up the amount of capital. Why are why is that helpful? Well, what it does is it allows somebody</p>
<p>to price the deal. So in this case, David SPAC sponsor price, the deal did the diligence and</p>
<p>decided to underwrite metro mile at that price. And then they came to me and said, Hey, you know,</p>
<p>do you want to come and join this round, essentially, and I got to know the business.</p>
<p>A lot of things that David said, basically are true. The thing that I will say is like,</p>
<p>everybody talks about the value of machine learning, right, and data oriented learning.</p>
<p>The most obvious thing that you can do is if you learn on top of a huge subset of data,</p>
<p>especially out in the real world, like driving data or any other kind of information is you</p>
<p>should be taking risk on top of it. And this is why sort of these next generation insurance</p>
<p>companies to me are so interesting, because it&rsquo;s probably where you&rsquo;re going to see</p>
<p>machine learning, be used that just massive, massive scale, because you&rsquo;re just going to</p>
<p>reprice risk, and make it as David said, much more dynamic. So anyways, they showed it to me,</p>
<p>I, I really like the product, the metrics are really amazing. And so I joined. It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited for I&rsquo;m really excited for Friedberg.</p>
<p>Yeah, congratulations. Great job. And I&rsquo;ve never worked on anything together. So it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing our first project here on the online podcast together.</p>
<p>All right. It sounds like a brilliant idea. And I&rsquo;m just pissed. I&rsquo;m not part of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I Jason, do you know about this? I don&rsquo;t know anything. I get out of it. I need to get</p>
<p>my beak wet. You too. You too. Narcissistic besties have been have been running around</p>
<p>touting every single unicorn you guys.</p>
<p>I miss my allocation in Robin Hood. I miss my allocation in Uber or whatever.</p>
<p>All right, new bestie rule, new bestie rule. Everybody gets a slice, even a little tasty poo.</p>
<p>Everybody gets their beak wet.</p>
<p>Like the old neighborhood, like the old neighborhood.</p>
<p>Back a little share.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s Jason, why don&rsquo;t you start an Angelus syndicate for every all in podcast listener?</p>
<p>Yes, all in podcast syndicate, it will be on the syndicate.com. I love Angelus. But yeah,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do it. We&rsquo;ll do the syndicate.com slash all in podcast. And then we&rsquo;ll aggregate all</p>
<p>these subscribers and I&rsquo;ll take a 20% carry and you guys can suggest ideas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do zero carry and we&rsquo;ll allow all the listeners to participate in our deals,</p>
<p>which I think would be pretty cool. Listen, I&rsquo;ve-</p>
<p>I love how every time you loop my business into this, whether it&rsquo;s podcasting or syndicates,</p>
<p>you take out the money and the profit. I tell you what, I have an idea. How about we SPAC</p>
<p>this week in startups and you do it for no participation?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the father of growth. You know how you grow? By making things free.</p>
<p>You want to maximize demand, just make it free. By the way, on this topic,</p>
<p>Saksipoo had this incredible tweet this week, which was basically like,</p>
<p>wow, this is like my 95th unicorn that filed to go public. I mean, literally every single</p>
<p>unicorn that filed this week to go public Saks was an angel investor, which is incredible.</p>
<p>Says how good he is as an investor. But the best follow-up tweet was Zach Weinberg,</p>
<p>the co-founder of Flatiron Health, whose tweet was,</p>
<p>I just want to congratulate myself on nothing for having not been a part of any of these companies.</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate myself for making no bets and taking no risk and getting no reward.</p>
<p>No, I thought Zach&rsquo;s tweet was the best.</p>
<p>Saks, don&rsquo;t you find it tiring? Like all these investments that you&rsquo;ve made,</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t these guys call you and want to do meetings and chat all the time?</p>
<p>You know, this has got to be a huge amount of effort, right?</p>
<p>Well, not really.</p>
<p>You just put the money in and turn around?</p>
<p>Well, you know, if you&rsquo;re not on the board, your obligation is basically to respond when somebody</p>
<p>asks you for something. And as an angel investor, it is a little different when you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>leading around and you&rsquo;re a board member.</p>
<p>I was making these investments back in 2012, 2013. That&rsquo;s when these seeds were planted.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>These were 50K, 100K, 250K checks, right? So the responsibility is proportional to the dollar</p>
<p>amount.</p>
<p>Somewhere a little bigger than that, actually. But I mean, I&rsquo;ve written checks, you know,</p>
<p>seven-figure checks in some of these companies.</p>
<p>Well, Saks, according to your personal balance sheet that</p>
<p>we got from your accountant this week.</p>
<p>Yeah, Phil Hellmuth sent it.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We see here a transaction for Howes. Is it true you did the Series B of Howes, the entire Series</p>
<p>B?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I heard.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I heard it was you led the Series B.</p>
<p>No, no. NEA led that round. I mean, I invested a lot as an individual. I did co-lead</p>
<p>the Series B or C of Adapar. That was one that I did as an individual.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible. Yeah, that&rsquo;s going to be huge.</p>
<p>I have no idea what that company is, but that sounds awesome.</p>
<p>They manage funds.</p>
<p>They do portfolio management software.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming up on, you know, $100 million a year.</p>
<p>That name sounds awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting pretty big.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding. I&rsquo;m totally kidding. I&rsquo;m totally kidding. Let&rsquo;s start the pod, Jekyll.</p>
<p>Where are we going to start?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think-</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve all self-promoted.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m just happy to hear that Jason was cut out of your deal as much as me.</p>
<p>When I read about it on Twitter, I&rsquo;m like, I better not be the only best to cut out of this</p>
<p>thing.</p>
<p>Are we all right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;re totally right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. You&rsquo;re right. It is getting awkward now because people who watch</p>
<p>this podcast assume that we do everything together.</p>
<p>Like literally, they&rsquo;re like, well, you guys go grocery shopping together.</p>
<p>You go on vacation together. You guys live in the same TikTok house.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>I think the first thing we should talk about is just this amazing moment in time when,</p>
<p>because of science, and this podcast started during the pandemic, we have had, as predicted</p>
<p>by Freeberg, who gets to take two victory laps, he said by the end of the year, we&rsquo;d have vaccines</p>
<p>and they would have, because of this mRNA, if I remember correctly, 90, 95% efficacy.</p>
<p>And sure enough, the week after Trump wins, I&rsquo;m sorry, loses, sorry, Sachs, he lost actually.</p>
<p>The week after Trump lost, I know you&rsquo;re doing both for him.</p>
<p>The week after he lost, Moderna, Pfizer, then the next week,</p>
<p>Moderna, and then the next week, Oxford.</p>
<p>And I understand Johnson &amp; Johnson is about to announce something.</p>
<p>And all of these have 90 to 95% efficacy.</p>
<p>And that there are going to be 40, 50, and 60 million doses in December, January, and February,</p>
<p>just from the first two in America alone.</p>
<p>So, Freeberg, if you were to put a number on when herd immunity hits, because probably 20 or 30%</p>
<p>of people have had it, 20, 30% of people have some natural immunity, how long is this going to take?</p>
<p>And could we be doing this from a Warriors game next year?</p>
<p>When are we going to be able to do this in person and not have to test?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if it was Fauci or someone that&rsquo;s closer to the operation</p>
<p>shared that they do think they can get 70% of Americans immunized by May.</p>
<p>So, by May, yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you&rsquo;ll remember a few podcasts ago, I think I tried to explain a big part of</p>
<p>the budget that went into this Operation Warp Speed was to parallelize production of these</p>
<p>vaccines while they were being tested.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve been scaling up the production and the manufacturing of these.</p>
<p>And if they weren&rsquo;t going to work, we&rsquo;re just going to crash them, right?</p>
<p>A couple billion dollars, who cares?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good option for the American people.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a ton of doses that have been produced.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about packaging and distribution now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, you know, supposed to be kind of underway with the plan to be that on December</p>
<p>11th or 12th, when they give the emergency use authorization, these doses start showing up.</p>
<p>We basically went all in blind.</p>
<p>Like we just shoved the chips in and said, we&rsquo;re going to make these vaccines even if</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like a spray and pray angel investment portfolio.</p>
<p>You know, we bought like four different things or five different things.</p>
<p>We made bets in all of them and hope that one of them pays off.</p>
<p>And it turns out they&rsquo;re all going to pay off.</p>
<p>So, you know, or a chunk of them are going to pay off.</p>
<p>And we get to have them ready, you know, in time to kind of make a difference here.</p>
<p>Now, all that being said, if you look at the case numbers in the US right now,</p>
<p>we could be as high as 30% of the American people have already been infected with coronavirus</p>
<p>based on some estimates.</p>
<p>So, as of the June 30th paper that was published from those dialysis patients,</p>
<p>and they did a pretty good statistical interpretation of looking at antibodies in</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s blood, they estimate 10% of the American population was infected by coronavirus as of June</p>
<p>30th.</p>
<p>And then if you look at the number of people that have been infected since then, and you apply the</p>
<p>similar sort of multiple that you would assume based on tests, you know, there&rsquo;s an estimate</p>
<p>that we could already be up to 30% of the US population has been infected.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And therefore immune.</p>
<p>And theoretically, mostly immune.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say that, right?</p>
<p>And so sure, there&rsquo;s anecdotes and so on.</p>
<p>But yeah, let&rsquo;s just say generally, yes, immune.</p>
<p>And so you combine that with these vaccines starting to roll out, and we get, you know,</p>
<p>a pretty kind of comfortable position in terms of the pandemic and hopefully a couple of months</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the market&rsquo;s going nuts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why everyone I mean, I don&rsquo;t know about you guys, but I got some conference</p>
<p>invites this last week for conferences for next year that have been canceled this year.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re really on hold.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Oh, wow.</p>
<p>People are starting to lean for what time frame third quarter or fourth quarter?</p>
<p>Summer, July.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So people are now assuming that and they&rsquo;re booking hotel spaces based on it.</p>
<p>That is extraordinary.</p>
<p>Sachs, you shared this New York Times story.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you summarize it for the audience?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to get your thoughts.</p>
<p>In addition to this, as to what this recovery might look like, if in fact, we have more</p>
<p>vaccine than we need.</p>
<p>And even, you know, a reasonable number of Americans take it and don&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a conspiracy theory by Bill Gates to control and the Illuminati and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this New York Times story is pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called politics, science and the remarkable race for coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>I think it just came out today in the New York Times.</p>
<p>Actually, sorry, it&rsquo;s published.</p>
<p>It published November 21st, updated November 24th.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>It describes the effort by Operation Warp Speed by the administration, by Pfizer, by</p>
<p>Moderna kind of gives you the behind the scenes play by play.</p>
<p>And reading the article, you have to come away thinking that the Trump administration</p>
<p>did a pretty good job with this whole Warp Speed project.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the New York Times realizes that it&rsquo;s making the Trump administration</p>
<p>look so good, or maybe they don&rsquo;t care anymore because he&rsquo;s lost the election.</p>
<p>But the article does make the administration look very good.</p>
<p>I mean, competent, very competent.</p>
<p>First of all, they shoveled money to the right people.</p>
<p>They, you know, they offered Pfizer money.</p>
<p>Pfizer didn&rsquo;t want it or need it.</p>
<p>But Moderna did.</p>
<p>So they got a few billion dollars from Moderna.</p>
<p>They parallel processed a bunch of different attempts here so that if one company failed,</p>
<p>the others might succeed.</p>
<p>There was sort of a Reaganite cutting of bureaucratic red tape wherever they could.</p>
<p>There were examples in the story of the drug company needing something, some supplies or</p>
<p>what have you.</p>
<p>And they would call the administration and they would make it happen.</p>
<p>And then finally, the administration didn&rsquo;t do anything to kind of mess with the science.</p>
<p>You know, in fact, they describe how this new experimental mRNA technique that they</p>
<p>used to generate the vaccine, they had the code for that within two days.</p>
<p>They actually had the vaccine sort of printed, if you will, within weeks.</p>
<p>And really what took all this time were the human trials, you know, the three stage human</p>
<p>trials, which the administration did not do anything to speed up.</p>
<p>And probably the irony of irony is the supreme irony is there&rsquo;s a story.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a bit in the story.</p>
<p>It actually begins with the this guy, Slowy, who&rsquo;s the head of the Trump administration&rsquo;s</p>
<p>effort to produce the vaccine.</p>
<p>He actually slowed down the Moderna human trials by about three weeks because they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>including enough minorities in the, you know, in the in the trial.</p>
<p>And that cost him three weeks.</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for those three weeks, Moderna&rsquo;s vaccine would have happened before Pfizer,</p>
<p>and it would have come out about a week before the election.</p>
<p>So you got to wonder like Trump has got to be pulling out his hair about what about about</p>
<p>about this twist of fate.</p>
<p>David, how does it attribute credit for warp speed?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going someplace with this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just asking you the question.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t the article is not trying to attribute credit.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just kind of describing the behind the scenes of how Pfizer Moderna came up with</p>
<p>their vaccines.</p>
<p>And it just but but in describing, you know, Pfizer, Moderna did the work of creating the</p>
<p>vaccine, but in describing the ways that warp speed contributed, they did things that were</p>
<p>only helpful and nothing that was harmful.</p>
<p>And so in that sense, it made the Trump administration look quite good.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the point is that the warp speed folks, which is probably the least well known</p>
<p>working group working on Coronavirus to the rest of the public is because it was a lot of</p>
<p>wonky insiders.</p>
<p>It was sign of almost proving the exact opposite of what Trump typically does, which is, you</p>
<p>know, some idiotic, nepotistic leaning where it&rsquo;s his daughter or it&rsquo;s his son in law running</p>
<p>around, you know, completely and effectively, you know, doing something where they become</p>
<p>sort of front and center for taking credit.</p>
<p>In this case, it was just a bunch of policy walks.</p>
<p>You never heard about the project.</p>
<p>We only know about warp speed, because a handful of us have talked about it.</p>
<p>And it turns out to actually have been good, because they knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>And they do enough to, to not try to seek the credit and just get out of the way.</p>
<p>I mean, it proves almost the antithesis of how the Trump campaign, you know, managed</p>
<p>their time in the White House.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I, you have a point where, you know, I was kind of reading this article</p>
<p>wondering, you know, where was Jared Kushner, because if Kushner knew about this, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no way he slows down the Moderna vaccine by three weeks.</p>
<p>I mean, that might have made the difference right there and whether Trump wins or not.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the effect on the election if the vaccine had come out one week before</p>
<p>November 3rd?</p>
<p>I think Trump would have won decidedly if he had a vaccine or two out with 90%.</p>
<p>But I think he had no credibility, even though Moderna and Pfizer were saying late November,</p>
<p>and he said the vaccines are around the corner.</p>
<p>His whole tenure was based on so much lying.</p>
<p>He was the boy who cried wolf.</p>
<p>He was the president who cried wolf by the time he told the truth.</p>
<p>And he was telling the truth about the vaccines.</p>
<p>It was like, oh, my Lord, he told the truth in the final three months.</p>
<p>Well, can I give you the opposite, David, of that, which is that if Moderna basically</p>
<p>says, hey, guys, we have a vaccine that works for white people and a disease that&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, disproportionately killing blacks and, you know, Hispanics and brown people, Native</p>
<p>Americans, and all of a sudden, people are like, wait, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Maybe they would have gone into Georgia, and they would have just crushed them even more.</p>
<p>And then you would have actually had the Senate flip, too.</p>
<p>So you could have had a whole kind of distribution of outcomes there in a different case, because</p>
<p>you could have had an angry reaction as well.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know, I guess, as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s ironic that an administration that was constantly accused</p>
<p>of white supremacy probably lost the election, because they slowed down this vaccine trial</p>
<p>group to include more minorities.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>But I think what we&rsquo;re saying is it wasn&rsquo;t the actual administration.</p>
<p>It was somebody that actually knows what they were doing.</p>
<p>We call that redemption in the movie when the person actually loses because they did</p>
<p>the right thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of redemption.</p>
<p>Freeberg, when you look at these mRNA vaccines, you were educating us about them last night.</p>
<p>And also for a long time.</p>
<p>Tell the audience just one more time how these work briefly, and what the potential for them</p>
<p>is in the future.</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of us now are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>This is going to be over.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to be at conferences or traveling to Europe or whatever it is next summer.</p>
<p>But we are all going to be scarred for life thinking, when is the next coronavirus?</p>
<p>Just like for a decade, we were on pins and needles.</p>
<p>When is the next 911?</p>
<p>So this is going to be scar tissue for a generation or two of people.</p>
<p>When the next COVID comes, how quickly will warp speed 2.0 go?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the right question.</p>
<p>Because our approach to doing vaccines may have just changed permanently.</p>
<p>So every cell has your DNA.</p>
<p>And DNA basically codes proteins.</p>
<p>Every three letters of DNA makes an amino acid codes for a specific amino acid.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 20 amino acids.</p>
<p>The way that DNA turns into proteins is through RNA.</p>
<p>So RNA is kind of like a mirror copy of your DNA.</p>
<p>It floats into these things called ribosomes in your cells and outcome proteins.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a printer, right?</p>
<p>And so those ribosomes make your proteins using those amino acid sequences coded by the RNA.</p>
<p>So the way that the vaccines work historically is you&rsquo;ll get a dead virus,</p>
<p>which is basically the protein of a virus.</p>
<p>Your immune system then learns to kill that or to remove that protein.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Jesus, my dog.</p>
<p>Your immune system then learns to remove that protein from your body.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you develop this memory, your immune memory to a specific protein.</p>
<p>And so they put this dead virus in your body,</p>
<p>and hopefully your immune system learns a good response to it.</p>
<p>mRNA basically puts the RNA in your body that codes for that protein.</p>
<p>Your cells then make that protein.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s making a lot more of the protein in a more consistent way,</p>
<p>theoretically, the idea is your body develops a much more robust immune memory and immune response</p>
<p>without it overloading your system with all the immune cells try and wipe that protein out right</p>
<p>away, and so on.</p>
<p>The challenge is you&rsquo;re putting RNA in your body.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve always been worried about we don&rsquo;t know what the side effects of mixing RNA in</p>
<p>your body would be.</p>
<p>Is it going to change your DNA?</p>
<p>Is it going to change your genetic makeup?</p>
<p>Is it going to cause other deleterious side effects?</p>
<p>So this technology, this capability, this knowledge has been around forever.</p>
<p>I mean, not forever, but for a long time.</p>
<p>And the idea has always been we could use RNA in this way.</p>
<p>But no one wanted it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve used it in animals.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve used it in plants.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen the capabilities of using RNA to do different things like this.</p>
<p>But this is a big leap.</p>
<p>And so we kind of leapt forward here, getting to the point that we felt comfortable with</p>
<p>RNA as a treatment like this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>So in theory, in the future, as Sax points out, you could take any virus or any bacteria.</p>
<p>You could read its DNA.</p>
<p>You could do that in an hour.</p>
<p>Then you could take chunks of that DNA and code RNA for it so that your body makes those</p>
<p>proteins that theoretically produce an immune response.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the science of how do you create a new vaccine.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the amazing part is the way it&rsquo;s described in this article is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like laser printing or 3D printing a vaccine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the equivalent of that.</p>
<p>You just take the genome of the virus and boom, you&rsquo;ve got the vaccine.</p>
<p>And then all the other delay is about human trials and testing of it.</p>
<p>But imagine if that there was the next coronavirus is 10 times as deadly, something that spreads</p>
<p>as contagiously as smallpox and is as deadly as Ebola or something like that.</p>
<p>We could have a vaccine the next day.</p>
<p>Like you could, we could have it very, very quickly.</p>
<p>Challenge David would be as we&rsquo;d have it the next day, like we did here, but we would be</p>
<p>going through this three phase trial.</p>
<p>And so I want to take a moment here and talk to Chamath about something, which is challenge</p>
<p>trials.</p>
<p>In the UK, they will start doing challenge trials for those people who don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>a challenge trial is.</p>
<p>Essentially, they expose you to something dangerous, i.e. a virus like COVID.</p>
<p>And then they give you the vaccine and then they give you the virus as opposed to how</p>
<p>we do a three phase trial, which is you give the vaccine to 30,000 people and a placebo</p>
<p>to 30,000.</p>
<p>And then you come back three months later and see how many people got infected.</p>
<p>And it takes time and money, whereas challenge trials only take risk on the individuals who</p>
<p>are part of it.</p>
<p>Chamath, hundreds of people in the science community signed a letter.</p>
<p>And in the UK, they&rsquo;re going to be doing the first challenge trials in January.</p>
<p>The United States is not doing these.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain China is.</p>
<p>Um, do you think it&rsquo;s a moment in time where we need to think about the ethics and morality</p>
<p>of challenge trials specifically?</p>
<p>And then if so, how do you execute them with that?</p>
<p>How do you execute a challenge trial without it being unfair, um, or too dangerous for</p>
<p>people?</p>
<p>Obviously, you&rsquo;re not going to just go into a prison and say, hey, anybody want to get</p>
<p>10 years off the sentence, join the challenge trial?</p>
<p>That seems morally bankrupt.</p>
<p>But we let people climb mountains without ropes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, I think this speaks to a whole bunch of other issues that we&rsquo;ve talked about on</p>
<p>the pod before.</p>
<p>You know, another example of this was section 230 before when we talked about it.</p>
<p>We had a body of law that was created at a moment of time that essentially was about</p>
<p>framing and understanding a specific pathway and a way to use technologies that today look</p>
<p>archaic.</p>
<p>And we have to rewrite the laws in order to just compensate and understand for where we</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>So if I if you double click on trials, as an example, you know, if you have a solution</p>
<p>for a rare disease, you can go in a specific pathway with the FDA and get breakthrough</p>
<p>and fast track approval.</p>
<p>But if you, for example, have, you know, a novel immunotherapy cancer drug, you probably</p>
<p>you cannot, you know, you have to do a multi phase trial, a typical three phase trial,</p>
<p>you have to solve for very typical things like fatigue, etc, etc.</p>
<p>All these things slow progress down.</p>
<p>Now, in a world where we were somewhat flying blind 40 or 50 years ago, we didn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>you know, things like CRISPR.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have, you know, a real understanding of the genome.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have delivery mechanisms like CAR T, you would say, Okay, yeah, we should be</p>
<p>really, really careful.</p>
<p>But I would say that the more you know, the more you can ease up on the rules, because</p>
<p>you can actually empower people with a lot of information.</p>
<p>And it shouldn&rsquo;t take a disaster scenario for us to be iterative and experimental.</p>
<p>So I think the challenge trial is really important.</p>
<p>I think the concept of them make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I think a lot of government should employ incentives to figure out who is eligible and</p>
<p>why.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a healthy adult, male or female, and you want to participate in a trial, for</p>
<p>whatever set of reasons, you should be allowed to do so.</p>
<p>And companies that want to run those trials should be allowed to run them.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you want to find a complementary pathway through regulatory agencies to get</p>
<p>drugs to the starting line, you should be able to do those two.</p>
<p>And I think what we have to do is multi path these compounds going forward, because I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you accelerate all these technologies is ability to actually solve these diseases.</p>
<p>Freiburg, why is it so controversial that a rocket ship company, or, you know, people</p>
<p>who want to climb on mountains without ropes, or a rocket ship company, like there are experimental</p>
<p>pilots, we have astronauts, they take unbelievable risk.</p>
<p>We send thousands of troops into harm&rsquo;s way, for many different reasons, many of which</p>
<p>sadly die.</p>
<p>And they volunteer for those activities.</p>
<p>Those people are volunteering and compensated.</p>
<p>But when we look at science, and we look at a challenge trial, scientists say this is</p>
<p>morally reprehensible to compensate somebody for taking risk.</p>
<p>When that&rsquo;s exactly what we do in the army, we do it with police officers, and we do it</p>
<p>with astronauts.</p>
<p>Help us understand how scientists think so differently than say war.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s scientists as much as it is, you know, regulatory framework like</p>
<p>the some people would call it a nanny state.</p>
<p>And, you know, there are things that the nanny state assumes individuals don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>capacity to understand the extent of the potential loss or the or the nature of the risk.</p>
<p>This is true for angel investing, right?</p>
<p>You have to be a qualified investor to invest in a private company without appropriate</p>
<p>disclosures.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true in a lot of other contexts.</p>
<p>So, you know, to give people the authority to make decisions like this, it seems like</p>
<p>my I have no point of view that I&rsquo;m kind of making here, but it seems like the government</p>
<p>assumes or the elected officials assume or the populace assumes that there are things</p>
<p>that people aren&rsquo;t really equipped to make decisions on because they can&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the risk because they&rsquo;re not qualified.</p>
<p>And that and they get excluded from those activities.</p>
<p>But sex is the sex.</p>
<p>How should we reframe this?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I think I should reframe it.</p>
<p>I think assumption of risk is, is a is a really good principle.</p>
<p>And it is a way for people to engage in potentially harmful behaviors, just because a behavior</p>
<p>is potentially harmful doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t get to do it.</p>
<p>In the United States, you&rsquo;re allowed to do things that are manifestly harmful to yourself,</p>
<p>like smoking.</p>
<p>Well, you know, you even worse if you&rsquo;re in Oregon, you can now do all kinds</p>
<p>of hard drugs.</p>
<p>I mean, you can assume that risk for yourself.</p>
<p>So, you know, if in Portland, Oregon, you can now take heroin openly in the street with</p>
<p>no consequence, but you can&rsquo;t participate in a trial that could basically cure a cancer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the flip side of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re allowed in Nevada to play roulette.</p>
<p>I mean, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s got a negative expected value statistically, factually for individuals,</p>
<p>but the individual doesn&rsquo;t have the capacity.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, that&rsquo;s playing roulette to recognize that every dollar they&rsquo;re spending</p>
<p>at the roulette table is likely going to be, you know, taken away from them, like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some percentage of that that&rsquo;s going to be taken away.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 5% edge for the house on that on that game.</p>
<p>And, and so we make the argument in some cases that people don&rsquo;t have the capacity to understand</p>
<p>risk.</p>
<p>But in other cases, it&rsquo;s okay for them to not have the capacity to take risk.</p>
<p>And I think that there is this notion of what some people call regulatory capture that probably</p>
<p>encompasses both of these, which is that there is some degree of profiteering that</p>
<p>has created some set of laws that kind of manifestly capture that system in a certain</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>So there are profitable casino enterprises that say, let&rsquo;s get people to spend their money</p>
<p>in a risky way that they don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And that becomes the law.</p>
<p>And then people in Nevada are allowed to do that.</p>
<p>There are also pharmaceutical companies that will say, we need to have huge regulatory</p>
<p>burdens.</p>
<p>So once we make that big investment, and we get patent approval, and we can lock in that</p>
<p>drug, we can charge a lot of money for it.</p>
<p>So I would argue to some extent that the regulatory capture associated with the profiteering</p>
<p>that happens on the back end, in pharmaceuticals has in large part driven the structure around</p>
<p>risk taking in, in drug trials, particularly in the US, I mean, you can go get whatever</p>
<p>drug you want over the counter in Mexico, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we have a very different system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also happens to be the most expensive in the world.</p>
<p>And the rationale is, well, you&rsquo;re the most protected, right?</p>
<p>Well, the drug, the drug infrastructure here has created to your point, because of regulation,</p>
<p>the entire, you know, CRO industry, which is a multi multi billion dollar industry,</p>
<p>which basically is essentially a retardant of R&amp;D velocity, right?</p>
<p>Its entire job is to slow things down, create these double blinded studies, by the way,</p>
<p>and so many of these studies are not even double blinded, they&rsquo;re not even actually</p>
<p>scientifically rigorous, they get basically blown apart after the fact.</p>
<p>So what are they really in the business of doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re exploiting a business model that was created by laws,</p>
<p>laws that were written by regulators, regulators that were in the hands of lobbyists.</p>
<p>None of those folks truly understood at the time, but especially today, what&rsquo;s really possible.</p>
<p>So, you know, it does not make sense in the United States of America, just writ large,</p>
<p>simply put that you can buy alcohol and drink yourself into the ground, buy cigarettes and</p>
<p>smoke yourself to death, you know, jump away your money, gamble away your money where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>negative Evie, or open, you know, openly do illicit drugs.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t participate in a thoughtful trial backed by scientific research.</p>
<p>In fairness to moth, you can get away with smoking fentanyl on in San Francisco and Oregon,</p>
<p>but it is illegal to use that plastic straw.</p>
<p>So be careful, folks, the laws are very clear here.</p>
<p>That plastic straw is going to get you in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the fine is, but it is.</p>
<p>I mean, it wouldn&rsquo;t it wouldn&rsquo;t be so crazy if it were true.</p>
<p>But to your point, like you would actually get arrested for having a plastic bag,</p>
<p>then you will for having fentanyl in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll arrest you for the bag that the fentanyl is in.</p>
<p>But Chesa Boudin will not arrest you for the fentanyl in the plastic bag.</p>
<p>Stacks, we&rsquo;ve totally lost the script.</p>
<p>But Chamath sort of bridge this with the 230 discussion of common carrier.</p>
<p>And hey, you know, we had great intent with this law, but nobody saw social networks becoming</p>
<p>this dominant, addictive, etc.</p>
<p>So we need to be more nimble as a government in changing these regulations, whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>straws, fentanyl, challenge trials, or 230.</p>
<p>You wrote a blog post about it.</p>
<p>After we had our 230 discussion, a lot of people started talking about it.</p>
<p>Have you come to some conclusion as to an exit ramp for 230 or a way to maintain it</p>
<p>without, you know, throwing the baby with the bathwater?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, OK, just kind of make one concluding thought on this last topic.</p>
<p>So the reason why innovations happen so fast on the Internet is because of, you know, one</p>
<p>word permissionless, right?</p>
<p>Permissionless innovation.</p>
<p>Nobody who has an idea for a startup needs to go get permission from someone in the government,</p>
<p>you know, repeatedly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what makes a difference.</p>
<p>You know, Mark Zuckerberg as a, you know, sophomore in college can just build his project.</p>
<p>Larry and Sergei as PhD students can just build their project, ship it, start, you know,</p>
<p>getting users, and they don&rsquo;t have to get the permission of a regulator, whose incentive,</p>
<p>by the way, is just typically not to get fired by approving something that might rebound</p>
<p>on them in some, you know, in some bad way.</p>
<p>And to keep their job, yeah.</p>
<p>Keep their job.</p>
<p>I mean, imagine if, you know, imagine just to take it like a random example, when Elon</p>
<p>launched Starman, remember when he put the, like, he launched the Tesla into space, and</p>
<p>there was like a astronaut in there, and it was like this kind of really cool moment.</p>
<p>I assume he just did it.</p>
<p>I assume he didn&rsquo;t get permission from anybody to do it.</p>
<p>But could a moment like that have really happened if he did have to get permission?</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be like making its way up through the chain.</p>
<p>No one would know what to think of it.</p>
<p>No one would know whether they could be the one to approve it.</p>
<p>And then what if something goes wrong?</p>
<p>What if the Tesla comes back down to Earth and, you know, turns into a meteor or whatever?</p>
<p>Those are the scenarios that&rsquo;d be running through their heads.</p>
<p>Nobody would have allowed it, right?</p>
<p>And so when you just let entrepreneurs do things, like good things happen, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve had so much progress on the internet.</p>
<p>And in so many of these other areas, we&rsquo;ve had much less progress because, you know,</p>
<p>what a system like that selects for is your ability to go lobby regulators,</p>
<p>as opposed to just building your project and shipping it.</p>
<p>I think that one of the things that maybe happens is that,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re all expecting, or maybe some of us, I have definitely</p>
<p>some version of a new deal and some grand bargain.</p>
<p>And I wonder maybe whether the new deal and our sort of like our version of FDR over the next,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 10 years is the person that actually says,</p>
<p>guys, we&rsquo;re going to have a wholesale rewrite of the regulatory infrastructure</p>
<p>to account for technology.</p>
<p>Just period.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to start someplace reasonable and small.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to make common sense reforms, just observing the times as they exist today.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to go and systematically try to make these industries a little bit more resilient,</p>
<p>a little bit more entrepreneurial, you know, a little bit less corrupted by regulatory</p>
<p>capture and lobbyists and laws that just don&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>100 years later,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;d be great if we could do that.</p>
<p>The reason we can&rsquo;t is because how do you reform the law without the lobbyists</p>
<p>getting their fingers in it?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And, and the problem is, there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no lobbyist for the company that doesn&rsquo;t exist yet.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>For the founder, for the entrepreneur who&rsquo;s got an idea in their head,</p>
<p>but they haven&rsquo;t built their company yet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nobody representing that person in Washington, right?</p>
<p>And what happens is you get new regulations in Washington, some agency gets created,</p>
<p>they reach out and touch an industry, but now every player that&rsquo;s affected</p>
<p>has to create their own lobbying, you know, organization.</p>
<p>Not true.</p>
<p>And David, what do you think about this?</p>
<p>What if the advocate for the entrepreneur or the uncreated company and uncreated product</p>
<p>is really the same as just individual civil liberties and rights?</p>
<p>How are they really that different?</p>
<p>Because really what it&rsquo;s doing is saying, the entrenched organizational infrastructure</p>
<p>that runs my life gets deconstructed, and then power gets pushed down to be the individual.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s tantamount to the same thing, I think.</p>
<p>Well, we, we have seen some, we have seen some pushback.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, there is some silver lining here.</p>
<p>If you look right now, the citizens of California, obviously people have been fleeing,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been talking about California and the one party system here causing so many problems.</p>
<p>But we did have Prop 22 pass.</p>
<p>And we now have 900,000 people have signed to recall Governor Newsom.</p>
<p>And these seem to be some pushback against this sort of nanny state</p>
<p>where people can&rsquo;t make decisions.</p>
<p>And then additionally, today, the SEC announced that they will allow gig working companies</p>
<p>to give stock to employees as part of their compensation, up to 15% of their compensation.</p>
<p>In fact, Hester, how do you pronounce her last name?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not Pierce.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pronounce the word Pierce?</p>
<p>Purse, Purse, Purse.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s spelled Pierce.</p>
<p>But Hester Purse is worth following on the Twitter, H-E-S-T-E-R-P-E-I-R-C-E.</p>
<p>Hester Purse, I had her on my podcast, This Week in Startups.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re really getting aggressive in changing the accreditation law.</p>
<p>So anybody is going to be able to be an accredited investor who&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>sophisticated through a testing mechanism.</p>
<p>And now they want to let gig workers get equity compensation.</p>
<p>But by the way, sorry, here&rsquo;s a perfect example of a regulatory body and infrastructure that</p>
<p>actually has changed with the times.</p>
<p>I think the SEC, in fact, I think maybe we talked about this a little bit the last time.</p>
<p>I actually think one of the best Trump appointees has been Jay Clayton.</p>
<p>And I actually think Jay Clayton has done an incredibly good job.</p>
<p>And a lot of what he&rsquo;s done is just deconstruct this kind of nanny state and say people can</p>
<p>become educated and make good decisions for themselves.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s in an area that&rsquo;s relatively benign, i.e. investing, people kind of just</p>
<p>let it happen without a lot of pushback.</p>
<p>And everybody kind of generally supports it.</p>
<p>Democrats support it.</p>
<p>Republicans support it.</p>
<p>And the outcomes are really good, to your point, Jason.</p>
<p>In a world of zero rates, how do you expect any just average, ordinary middle American</p>
<p>who just works a decent job to save for their retirement to actually make enough money?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re going to have to get educated and they&rsquo;re going to have to find a way of</p>
<p>putting their money to work in assets that have a better return, which literally was</p>
<p>illegal up until very recently.</p>
<p>You were systematically letting the rich stay rich.</p>
<p>And you were blocking the poor from having an opportunity to advance.</p>
<p>What if Apple Store employees could get their paycheck and say, I want to take my paycheck,</p>
<p>70% cash, 30% restricted stock units at this discount?</p>
<p>We could let Apple Store employees make a million dollars after five or 10 years of</p>
<p>working there, 10, 20 years from now and have generational wealth change.</p>
<p>David Sachs, you had a comment.</p>
<p>Well, I was going to ask Jermoth, do you think this type of deregulation is going to happen</p>
<p>in the Biden administration?</p>
<p>Because what you&rsquo;re discussing is like a very, really kind of classical Republican</p>
<p>Reaganite idea, right?</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s going to happen is I think you&rsquo;re going to continue to see deregulation</p>
<p>in areas that are benign and non-controversial.</p>
<p>So I think the SEC, the FCC, I think all of these places you&rsquo;ll see movement.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll probably actually see a lot more choice and deregulation effectively in</p>
<p>Medicare and CMMI.</p>
<p>I think those places will move first.</p>
<p>And then I think it&rsquo;ll be up to some leader politician to then really rally the troops</p>
<p>on some higher order bits.</p>
<p>And one of the biggest higher order bits would be sort of around the broader healthcare</p>
<p>infrastructure, social security.</p>
<p>Education.</p>
<p>Education.</p>
<p>Education is probably the biggest one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just too sacrosanct for the Democrats.</p>
<p>You cannot get elected without the teachers.</p>
<p>And so unless there is a startup that completely disrupts teacher pay and teacher compensation,</p>
<p>then the public school teachers unions will continue to dominate a lot of the federal</p>
<p>and state policy.</p>
<p>For the worst, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Freeberg, if you had one regulation or series of regulations or regulatory body you would</p>
<p>most like to see change for the good of humanity and Americans and the rest of humans on the</p>
<p>planet, what would it be?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably help.</p>
<p>Probably the drug process, the drug development process.</p>
<p>There was a gene editing program that ran and someone died.</p>
<p>This was, what year was this?</p>
<p>97, 99?</p>
<p>And they basically halted all gene editing programs for 13 years.</p>
<p>You know how many people died during that time?</p>
<p>It was fucking, it&rsquo;s a crazy, crazy fact where the one death is too many</p>
<p>rule basically doesn&rsquo;t take into account the kind of broader implications on the downside.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think that one&rsquo;s probably pretty important.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a good interview if you want to hear some interesting thoughts.</p>
<p>And again, not trying to be an advocate for any political point of view, but Charles Koch</p>
<p>goes on Tim Ferriss.</p>
<p>Have you guys heard this podcast interview?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to it, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he highlights a couple of really good examples about this regulatory capture</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re poor, and you want to become a hairdresser, and you know, start a salon</p>
<p>or go work in a salon and make money cutting hair, the cost and the burden for you to go</p>
<p>get the necessary approvals from the Cosmetician Association is too burdensome for you know,</p>
<p>the average person who&rsquo;s poor and needs to become a hairdresser.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just insane that you can&rsquo;t just go be a hairdresser.</p>
<p>The government needs to ensure that people don&rsquo;t get bad haircuts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse, it&rsquo;s worse.</p>
<p>You could, you don&rsquo;t need a license to be the engineer that writes the machine learning</p>
<p>code that either drives a car autonomously, or that, you know, helps propel disinformation</p>
<p>in a social network.</p>
<p>But you do need to have a license to give someone a buzz cut.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a bingo statement right there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, in fairness, I am checking out Saks&rsquo;s new haircut here.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m kind of thinking.</p>
<p>So there should be more regulation.</p>
<p>There might.</p>
<p>I was practicing without a license.</p>
<p>You were?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t see the result of this.</p>
<p>Saks, you&rsquo;re so white and pale.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re blending into the background shade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to see where your skin ends, your hair starts and the shade ends.</p>
<p>But I feel like the regulatory, if you think about the framework, you know, it extends</p>
<p>into education, too.</p>
<p>Like, you can&rsquo;t go get an entry level job without a quote unquote, college degree.</p>
<p>How fucking useful is a college philosophy degree to someone that&rsquo;s trying to get an</p>
<p>entry level job working at X, Y, or Z bank, right?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a bit absurd that the structure is set up so that there are whether it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, government or not, but there is effectively a hurdle, which is this alternative</p>
<p>to regulatory capture, but it&rsquo;s like, call it embedded system, you know, capture.</p>
<p>Like, there is a significant kind of hurdle that you have to get through that costs a</p>
<p>lot.</p>
<p>And the point of entry has gotten too high for most.</p>
<p>And it really stalls things out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to cause more damage than good.</p>
<p>Well, and it&rsquo;s also been completely disconnected from the reality of your employment potential.</p>
<p>People are going into debt for $200,000 in a liberal arts degree that provides no skill</p>
<p>that is valuable in the world.</p>
<p>Do we all agree that that makes sense?</p>
<p>Like, does anyone on this in this group argue for needing a bachelor&rsquo;s degree for everyone?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think, I think, I think it&rsquo;s useless.</p>
<p>What do you guys think of ISAs, income sharing agreements?</p>
<p>These have become kind of Lambda School does them, a bunch of other schools.</p>
<p>David, you saw a startup we just invested in that&rsquo;s doing them.</p>
<p>And I think you liked them at the demo day we did with Kraft.</p>
<p>Maybe, you know, this idea is who should take the risk for an education.</p>
<p>And when you look at an ISA, an income sharing agreement, what they&rsquo;re saying is,</p>
<p>the school takes the risk.</p>
<p>They let you come to school for free.</p>
<p>They give you what would be the equivalent of, let&rsquo;s say, a $15,000 coding camp or growth</p>
<p>marketer risk.</p>
<p>Then you pay double that amount over five, six, seven years as a percentage of your income.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t get income, if you don&rsquo;t break 50k a year, you don&rsquo;t have to pay it back.</p>
<p>And if you decide to go back to school or your income drops below 50, you don&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if a college had to make that promise?</p>
<p>They should do it.</p>
<p>They should start in college sports, but they should do it.</p>
<p>Imagine, you know, Duke basically went and recruited kids and said, listen, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to pay you to come to Duke.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to get you educated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to teach you how to play basketball better than anybody else.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to take 5% of your future earnings, yes or no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have to go to boosters.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have to take money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to have to do any of this stuff on the side.</p>
<p>But just be your best, learn to play the game.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get you a reasonable education.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll give you a good infrastructure.</p>
<p>And we take 5% of the backend.</p>
<p>With a cap.</p>
<p>So you could cap the upside, right?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s no cap.</p>
<p>But why do we always have to care about all of this?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s like, whatever, maybe it&rsquo;s 5% for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to pay the government 50%.</p>
<p>You get nothing in return.</p>
<p>So if you pay 5% and you get coach K to teach you how to shoot a jumper, it&rsquo;s better than that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So why isn&rsquo;t it possible?</p>
<p>And I remember how people had this unbelievably paternalistic, allergic reaction to income</p>
<p>sharing agreements when they were first talked about.</p>
<p>They called them indentured servitude, modern slavery.</p>
<p>And it was like, oh, my God.</p>
<p>So insulting to.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s no different than signing a contract with an agent to represent you when you first</p>
<p>start out in any industry, music or sports or film or whatever.</p>
<p>You could sign an agency agreement where the agent is your rep for 10, 20 years, right?</p>
<p>I mean, some of those agreements can have long tails on them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s effectively the same.</p>
<p>You know, look, it&rsquo;s even worse at a cap.</p>
<p>Look at look at we can talk about this in a second.</p>
<p>But like, you know, did you see what happened with Chappelle the last couple of days where</p>
<p>she let&rsquo;s go?</p>
<p>Did you watch the video?</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The video is incredible.</p>
<p>Video is incredible.</p>
<p>So the quick story on this is Chappelle basically did.</p>
<p>He had a request.</p>
<p>He went to Netflix and he said, take down Chappelle show.</p>
<p>Netflix took it down and he did a little stand up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on his Instagram.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 18 minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s fabulous.</p>
<p>As most Chappelle stuff.</p>
<p>Peek Chappelle.</p>
<p>Peek Chappelle.</p>
<p>And he basically told this story, which essentially the punchline is like, you know,</p>
<p>he signed a contract where he just got completely fucked.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, this is happening every single day in so many markets.</p>
<p>And so the idea that then you have actually a different market, which disrupts something</p>
<p>by actually creating transparency and something reasonable is all of a sudden completely immoral.</p>
<p>It makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s abuses happening all the time.</p>
<p>That is what the contract that Chappelle signed was indentured servitude.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t even have the rights to his name.</p>
<p>He cannot create his name and likeness.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you wanted to create the Dave Chappelle show again, you&rsquo;d have to call it the DC show.</p>
<p>But this is perfect.</p>
<p>Somebody owns his name.</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>In perpetuity, in all mediums and platforms.</p>
<p>This is a perfect tie back to the earlier statement about, you know, do you have the</p>
<p>appropriate kind of understanding of the risk you&rsquo;re taking or the benefit that you&rsquo;re getting?</p>
<p>I think Kanye has been doing this whole thing about he doesn&rsquo;t own the masters to his music</p>
<p>originally.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>At the moment that he signed that contract, when he signed over all the masters, you know,</p>
<p>master recordings and all the future revenue rights to his music, he was getting paid a ton</p>
<p>of money in his mind at that time.</p>
<p>He said, oh, my gosh, I&rsquo;m getting whatever it was.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s $5 million.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting $5 million.</p>
<p>Most amount of money I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It is absolutely worth me giving over the masters of this music and the future royalty</p>
<p>rights to this music for 12 songs or whatever it is for me to get $5 million today.</p>
<p>And I can live an amazing life and it&rsquo;ll change everything for me.</p>
<p>Who is to say that he was not, you know, of the appropriate sound mind and understanding</p>
<p>to decide in that moment to take that $5 million and give up all future royalties to his music?</p>
<p>Well, Chappelle&rsquo;s argument was the people who are in that ecosystem are all friends.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all working together and they&rsquo;ve commoditized the artist and they collude</p>
<p>to do this kind of upside limiting deals.</p>
<p>And I think what makes Silicon Valley so special is that we collude the other direction.</p>
<p>We want people to have equity participation and we want the social contract of Silicon</p>
<p>Valley is I&rsquo;m giving you equity.</p>
<p>I hope your penny stock becomes worth $1,500 and that you create multi-generational wealth</p>
<p>and you become an angel investor.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Look, if I&rsquo;m an angel investor or want to be an angel investor and some schmo tricks</p>
<p>me into investing in his shitty company and I just lose $20,000, but I didn&rsquo;t know how</p>
<p>to determine whether that company was shitty or not, because I&rsquo;ve never done investing</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>Read my book.</p>
<p>Is it for the government to regulate that circumstance and say, you know what, you need</p>
<p>to be a quote unquote qualified investor to be able to discern a good company for a bad</p>
<p>company or bullshit from not.</p>
<p>And the same for these contracts, right?</p>
<p>Like, I mean, so, you know, we&rsquo;re making the argument, I think, for the, you know,</p>
<p>the regulatory framework for preventing people from being able to have freedom of choice.</p>
<p>And I think like earlier, you know, the case was made, like people should be able to make</p>
<p>have freedom of choice at any point.</p>
<p>Why should the government kind of step in and make a decision for me?</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;m not advocating for government intervention.</p>
<p>My only point is that there are morally reprehensible things that are happening today</p>
<p>using contracts.</p>
<p>And that, you know, something like an income sharing agreement actually writes the ship</p>
<p>in so many ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely the burden of capitalism.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it devolves to that, right?</p>
<p>Where like, oh, you&rsquo;re sick, you have cancer, pay me a million dollars, I&rsquo;ll give you this</p>
<p>drug.</p>
<p>So Hollywood&rsquo;s a little bit of its own beast, where there&rsquo;s all these gatekeepers, and the</p>
<p>gatekeepers are always trying to get control over, you know, the creative product.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, like, you know, signing contracts with those sharks is always a dangerous thing</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>I think Silicon Valley is very different.</p>
<p>We have much more of a culture of equity.</p>
<p>I think the income sharing agreements are much more in that vein.</p>
<p>And I think they&rsquo;re a great idea for like any trade that demonstrably increases your</p>
<p>earning power, right?</p>
<p>So the beauty of Lambda School is they pay for you to get an education being a coder.</p>
<p>It then increases your salary, and they get a piece of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a win-win for everybody.</p>
<p>I think where this goes, if these ISAs are successful, is that every trade that&rsquo;s valuable</p>
<p>will get its own ISA type school.</p>
<p>And then that gets peeled out of a university education.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s left for colleges to do?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically, you know, all the stuff that doesn&rsquo;t add value.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re museums.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically like these monasteries again, right?</p>
<p>They go back to being monasteries, not places where you get skills.</p>
<p>We need to celebrate vocational capability.</p>
<p>Because I think like, you know, we have so celebrated this mythical bachelor&rsquo;s degree,</p>
<p>and it just means fucking nothing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it doesn&rsquo;t really learn a trade.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just as frankly, that should be as respected or more.</p>
<p>But in the American culture, you don&rsquo;t do that right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood that.</p>
<p>If you go, for example, to different countries around the world, Europe&rsquo;s a good example,</p>
<p>actually, of this, because it&rsquo;s the closest analog in terms of quality of living to America.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real celebration of people who choose vocational tradecraft, because there&rsquo;s an entire</p>
<p>educational infrastructure that you can onboard yourself into.</p>
<p>You can become a skilled person, and you can have a really good, decent life.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s pride in the work.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s pride in that work.</p>
<p>And in America, you know, you covet this piece of paper, the piece of paper is really</p>
<p>just a scam that allows, you know, administrators to basically pay themselves millions of dollars</p>
<p>and or run an asset management business as the Trojan horse of that purpose.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s I just think it&rsquo;s I just think</p>
<p>the most amazing thing about these companies, I&rsquo;ve been digging into them, because I&rsquo;m looking</p>
<p>for more to invest in.</p>
<p>And these companies, these companies that are the trade schools that are based themselves</p>
<p>on ISIS, and there are ones who are doing welding and plumbing and all kinds of different</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>And there are ISA platforms that are providing ISIS to any school that wants them and doing</p>
<p>like the sort of AWS of ISIS.</p>
<p>Anyway, these for what this firm told me was, inside of one of these trade schools, they</p>
<p>spend 50% of their time on placement 50% on education.</p>
<p>And that at a college, they spend 99 point x amount of time on the education and less</p>
<p>than 1% on placement, which kind of attracts right?</p>
<p>I mean, when we went to college, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s changed much.</p>
<p>But the Career Services Center was like this two person office, like in the worst part</p>
<p>of campus.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t, when you&rsquo;re doing an ISA, if you accept more people who are unqualified</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t, aren&rsquo;t ready for the education or not motivated for it, it works against</p>
<p>you because they&rsquo;re not going to pay back the ISA.</p>
<p>So you then get sharper, you know, you sharpen the blade of who gets accepted, you start</p>
<p>accepting the right people.</p>
<p>These colleges, they would accept anybody who would come in and take the loans.</p>
<p>That was your qualifier is did you pass your loan?</p>
<p>The ISA as a service idea is a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>I would invest in that.</p>
<p>I like that idea as an investment way better than running one of these schools, you know,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s basically issuing the ISIS themselves.</p>
<p>But how amazing is that, that we live in a country where people are willing to, you</p>
<p>know, as a movement now, people are willing to fund your education because they know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to increase your earning power and then they&rsquo;ll get paid on the back end.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like fantastic.</p>
<p>And like, that&rsquo;s all like happening.</p>
<p>All that innovation is happening right now without the government needing to get involved</p>
<p>or a big government loan program.</p>
<p>And the historical left is calling it indentured servitude.</p>
<p>Literally, like the Vox is in the New York Times of the world.</p>
<p>And I mean, servitude is having a $250,000 debt that you&rsquo;ve got to pay down.</p>
<p>You can never get rid of in bankruptcy for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s real indentured service.</p>
<p>I think the problem is that, you know, East Coast left leaning editorial publications.</p>
<p>They have to themselves justify their $190,000 bachelor philosophy from Oberlin College.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you, if you take that, you know, come up.</p>
<p>Oberlin is the number one listener base we have on this podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You just lost.</p>
<p>No, but you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve taken out every valuable trade and move them from a university where you</p>
<p>got to pay $100,000 a year to an ISA, where it costs you nothing, like what&rsquo;s left?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to be people studying.</p>
<p>Philosophy.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Intersectionality, intersectionality studies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be studying the past.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be studying the past.</p>
<p>What a disaster to collapse upon itself.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>As we wrap up here, let&rsquo;s just take a moment to think about what some people are calling</p>
<p>the big reset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>We have a change in management in the country, which is obviously polarizing.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll put that aside.</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s happened with these vaccines and science is truly miraculous.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>A lot of people, there&rsquo;s a lot of pain and suffering this year.</p>
<p>A lot of people lost their jobs.</p>
<p>A lot of people lost their restaurants.</p>
<p>A lot of people are suffering from mental illness.</p>
<p>Some people are having to take care of their kids and get to know them.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s been hard for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Sorry about that, Sax.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t directed at him.</p>
<p>David, do you know your children&rsquo;s names now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I do now.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it like to spend three hours with one of your children?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got flashcards in front of him right now.</p>
<p>There are pictures on the back.</p>
<p>The name&rsquo;s on the other side.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so brutal.</p>
<p>So anyway, I was trying to be sincere.</p>
<p>The kids would even occasionally run into my office during COVID, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they want to talk to you and hug you and show affection?</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m your father.</p>
<p>Actually, I am.</p>
<p>I thought I was just working from my office and all these kids show up and tell me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their home.</p>
<p>Well, I just wanted to announce to the all-in audience that we have upgraded Friedberg and</p>
<p>Sax&rsquo;s chips.</p>
<p>Just last week, Chamath and I pushed the update for the Joy 1.7 update.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it been going to the two Davids now that you have a third emotion?</p>
<p>We now have emotion of joy.</p>
<p>Do not use it for‚Äî</p>
<p>It feels good and warm inside body.</p>
<p>Do not use it all in same day.</p>
<p>Spread it out over a month.</p>
<p>Hey, David, did you think that Trump actually resigned two days ago?</p>
<p>Was that the equivalent of a‚Äîor the concession tweet?</p>
<p>It was acceptance of‚Äîyou&rsquo;re talking about when he authorized the GSA to release transition</p>
<p>funds to Biden?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that was his concession.</p>
<p>There, that&rsquo;s basically what you&rsquo;re going to get out of him.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his acceptance of the election result.</p>
<p>So after anger, he&rsquo;s now went into bargaining, and then he was depressed, and now he&rsquo;s accepting?</p>
<p>Well, what basically happened is you had Rudy and Sidney Powell and that legal team going</p>
<p>to court to try and challenge all these rules.</p>
<p>The whack pack.</p>
<p>Yeah, they tried to go to court to challenge all these rulings.</p>
<p>I think Rudy was like one in 35, meaning I think he won one ruling and lost 35.</p>
<p>So it was going very, very poorly.</p>
<p>So like you versus Alan Keating.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s a whole separate story we&rsquo;ll get into.</p>
<p>But the thing that really ended it was when Sidney Powell came out with this elaborate</p>
<p>conspiracy theory that actually Trump lost the election because communist code writers</p>
<p>had effectively infected this the software that was running the election.</p>
<p>And somehow Hugo Chavez was behind this, even though he&rsquo;s been dead for seven years.</p>
<p>Hugo got us again.</p>
<p>And the Republican governor of Georgia and Secretary of State were in on it.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was so wild and crazy that basically the narrative just cracked.</p>
<p>And so then you had like, Steve Schwarzman come out and then sort of the Republican business</p>
<p>community and and Pat to me, Republican senator from Pennsylvania came out and they all just</p>
<p>said, look, this is this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>And so that was the moment I think at which this narrative that the election was stolen</p>
<p>kind of cracked is and I think she kind of she did everyone a favor by being so like</p>
<p>off the reservation that it just brought the whole thing to like a meltdown.</p>
<p>Sidney Powell always whenever I see her, I always I just think that she&rsquo;s one second</p>
<p>away from her dentures flying out of her mouth and hitting the camera.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s your crazy aunt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the crazy aunt at Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>She said she was going to release the Kraken.</p>
<p>And I guess she meant the I think I was running down Rudy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I think it was the hair dye running down Rudy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the crack.</p>
<p>Rudy&rsquo;s the crack.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m glad that it was a total meltdown.</p>
<p>It was a total shit show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad the GOP finally, after Trump&rsquo;s defeat, decided with 55 days left to go that they</p>
<p>would take a stand against.</p>
<p>Well, let me let me tell you what I think is going to happen now is I think that this</p>
<p>New York Times article we talked about the top of the show about the fact this Operation</p>
<p>Warp Speed that it was a big success.</p>
<p>I think that the best narrative for Trump, if he wants to maintain this idea that he</p>
<p>was robbed, is not that he was sort of legally robbed with fake votes or fake voting software,</p>
<p>but rather just that if these pharma companies have put out the news a week earlier, yes,</p>
<p>it would have meaningfully changed.</p>
<p>And I think he has an amazing story there.</p>
<p>I would agree with that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, when you have like a major sporting event, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a bad call by the refs and all the fans basically said, oh, we were robbed.</p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t get that like result overturned.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>You lost, but you have a talking point forever that you lost.</p>
<p>I mean, if you go to St.</p>
<p>Louis or whatever, and you mention there&rsquo;s an asterisk, there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s an asterisk.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>When they suspended Draymond, when the National LeBron Association suspended Draymond and</p>
<p>that series, there are all these sporting events with asterisks by them.</p>
<p>I mean, like, you know, if you go to St.</p>
<p>Louis and mention the name Don Denkinger, you know, people will know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>I think the Cardinals lost the 85 World Series because of a first base umpires call, or at</p>
<p>least that&rsquo;s their view of it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so I think, you know, what what Trump can do is is say that, look, we were robbed</p>
<p>because we never got credit for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Now, if I do think the economy is going to bounce back really strong next year because</p>
<p>of the vaccines.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve got to say that if these vaccines and COVID in the next three, four,</p>
<p>five months, 2021 is going to be a great year.</p>
<p>So if Trump hands Biden these vaccines and the economy does well next year, but something</p>
<p>bad happens between now and four years from now, he&rsquo;ll say, I handed this guy everything</p>
<p>on a silver platter.</p>
<p>He screwed it up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll be his narrative for four years from now.</p>
<p>Could happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>What do you what do you think about what do you guys think about the pick so far?</p>
<p>Janet Yellen for Treasury Secretary is great.</p>
<p>Thank God it&rsquo;s not Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s out of the party.</p>
<p>Well, I do think the biggest challenge we&rsquo;re going to face is this monetary policy issue.</p>
<p>I mean, the dollar is, you know, in decline.</p>
<p>We printed 30% of the U.S. dollars in circulation in the last six months.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s cheering that the Dow is at 30,000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, you know, there&rsquo;s 30% more dollars.</p>
<p>So everything&rsquo;s going to inflate.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to have someone sitting in that seat who understands economic policy really</p>
<p>clearly and the tide of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think the picks so far have been have been really, really top notch.</p>
<p>Tony Blinken, friend of a couple of ours for Secretary of State.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a star.</p>
<p>Yellen&rsquo;s a dove, which I think is really good for just, you know.</p>
<p>Did you guys know the chief of staff, Sax?</p>
<p>Do you know who this guy?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been like Biden&rsquo;s aide for a long time.</p>
<p>Is that the deal?</p>
<p>Ron Klain.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the founder of Revolution with Steve Case.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He comes from a venture background.</p>
<p>All of Biden&rsquo;s picks have been people who&rsquo;ve been long time washing hands,</p>
<p>who he&rsquo;s had personal relationships with for a long time.</p>
<p>He really seems to value that personal loyalty.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve also been kind of, you know, nice and boring, safe experience picks.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s delivering on kind of what he promised to be, which is a president we can</p>
<p>forget about.</p>
<p>Tone it down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his motto.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to be a caretaker president.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do we do without Trump to talk about on this podcast?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s been about 34%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to need a new topic to rotate in here.</p>
<p>We might need to put in a little Netflix as we wrap here.</p>
<p>What are you thankful for?</p>
<p>And what are you most looking forward to next year?</p>
<p>Vis-a-vis just it&rsquo;s been a rough year.</p>
<p>I mean, listen, it&rsquo;s been nice for people&rsquo;s equity portfolios, of course.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really what do you hope for America, for humanity, for yourselves, your family,</p>
<p>for friends?</p>
<p>You know, what are you thankful for?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll let you, Friedberg, it looks like your processing unit has delivered a result.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>The emotion bank has been cleared.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t think that this year was any cup of tea for anyone.</p>
<p>So I think like everyone, you kind of value your friendships and your family.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been a year.</p>
<p>Going into COVID, I was in the office every day, spending more time at home, being closer</p>
<p>to my children.</p>
<p>I know their names, by the way, Sax.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll teach you how to learn them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been actually really special being at home a lot and being with the family a lot</p>
<p>and realizing how much that stuff matters and how being close to everyone matters.</p>
<p>Because when you&rsquo;re in the run of the life before you kind of get knocked back and just</p>
<p>put everything in perspective, you miss those moments.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been really special and important to me this year in a really kind of personal</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>And just having friendships, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s great for us to all be able to talk as we do every day and have people you</p>
<p>can kind of connect with, even if you&rsquo;re not sitting in person.</p>
<p>I do think that everyone realizes they need that.</p>
<p>So anyway, it&rsquo;s been an insightful year.</p>
<p>Money aside, I was fucking terrorized at the start of this year about money.</p>
<p>And at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a fucking roller coaster.</p>
<p>Sold the first company and now you got the second one.</p>
<p>Ip on.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Mazel.</p>
<p>Sax, has your processing unit overloaded with this question?</p>
<p>Or are you going to be able to articulate something you&rsquo;re thankful for and appreciate?</p>
<p>I agree with all the things that Freeberg said.</p>
<p>The flip side of working from home all this time is you do get to spend a lot more time</p>
<p>with the kids.</p>
<p>I personally have, I like this shift to remote work where I can do a meeting from anywhere.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t have to go to the office.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been kind of kind of nice upside, I think.</p>
<p>I think we probably all learned how self-sufficient we can be.</p>
<p>I have learned how to give myself a haircut.</p>
<p>Apparently, you guys don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve done a very good job with it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s better than long hair.</p>
<p>So yeah, but look, I mean, I&rsquo;m thankful for, you know, knock on wood, we all have our health</p>
<p>and, you know, and weirdly, the economy, Silicon Valley is doing still doing great</p>
<p>technology is doing great, still the future.</p>
<p>And I think the country is even though COVID is kind of at its worst right now, I do think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to get rapidly better as soon as these vaccines come to market.</p>
<p>So I do think we&rsquo;ll work.</p>
<p>I do think 2021 will be a much, much better year.</p>
<p>Chamath.</p>
<p>In this really crazy way, I actually now am pretty thankful for what I&rsquo;ve learned during</p>
<p>the pandemic.</p>
<p>I mean, I wish we didn&rsquo;t have to go through it.</p>
<p>But I think that it was the most psychologically stressful period of my life.</p>
<p>Just to be so isolated from everybody.</p>
<p>And I learned something about myself recently, which is that in psychology, it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>repetitive compulsion, which is sort of like, you know, you repeat the sins of your father</p>
<p>or in this way, you know, I repeat these tired ways of behavior from my teens and my 20s</p>
<p>that were just unproductive.</p>
<p>And in the day to day life of just running around and going to meetings, as David said,</p>
<p>flying around, go to a meeting, go to the office, go here, go there.</p>
<p>You can make a lot of excuses for shitty behaviors that you carry with you.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m really thankful for is in this lockdown, I&rsquo;ve been forced to really</p>
<p>find the things that I don&rsquo;t really like about myself and try to fix them.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m really thankful for that, because I think hopefully everybody has something</p>
<p>positive to look at at the end of this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s definitely one thing for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very touching and actually quite appropriate as we wrap here, because</p>
<p>Sachs and Freeberg and I had some things we don&rsquo;t like about you, Chamath, that we wanted</p>
<p>to bring up.</p>
<p>You kind of knocked one off the list already, so we&rsquo;ve only got four more to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good you&rsquo;re doing this work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>We were planning an intervention for this end of the pod, but you kind of opened the</p>
<p>door, so here we go.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll wrap up with just saying, you know, family and friends are the obvious,</p>
<p>you know, things that you appreciate at this time.</p>
<p>I am thankful also for the hope that we&rsquo;ve seen from, you know, what we can do collectively</p>
<p>as a society when we put our minds to something, Warp Speed comes to mind, these frontline</p>
<p>workers.</p>
<p>I mean, we really maybe have seen what a global, a challenging problem being solved can do,</p>
<p>and hopefully that can translate into something like nuclear disarmament, sustainable energy,</p>
<p>global warming, etc.</p>
<p>And so I think on a macro level, the most macro level is the species.</p>
<p>Us humans as a species have now had an enlightening moment, just like World Wars and, you know,</p>
<p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki kind of changed people&rsquo;s perspective of the entire world.</p>
<p>Jay and I were talking about that the other day, how people looked at the world differently</p>
<p>after those horrific bombs went off.</p>
<p>I think after this bomb goes off, we&rsquo;re going to look at the world and say, hey, we can</p>
<p>solve problems, right?</p>
<p>And maybe we can be proactive about that.</p>
<p>And then finally, I think for the people suffering from mental illness, who maybe I was callous</p>
<p>and made fun of, or maybe just didn&rsquo;t relate to, I can relate to now because I have felt</p>
<p>depressed, I have felt anxious, I have felt exhausted from this, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the first time in the 49 years I&rsquo;ve been on the planet that I ever would say I</p>
<p>felt depressed.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand what that meaning was when Sachs would tell me how depressed he</p>
<p>was.</p>
<p>I just never, it never hit me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>He never said that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a good joke.</p>
<p>I am joking.</p>
<p>But I, you know, I think for people suffering from mental illness, get help and, you know,</p>
<p>talk to people.</p>
<p>And I think this really opened my eyes to that.</p>
<p>And of course, this podcast, you know, and our friendship‚Äî</p>
<p>This podcast was the best thing that, and one of the best things in my life that came</p>
<p>out of this whole period.</p>
<p>I think for me too.</p>
<p>And, you know, I&rsquo;ve heard that from a lot of the people who listen to it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure if Sachs and Friedberg had a fourth emotion, they would agree with us too.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think this podcast has been doing nothing but costing me money.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Because I painted you as a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>God knows how many deals I&rsquo;ve lost‚Äî</p>
<p>You are not a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>Yeah, God knows how many deals I&rsquo;ve lost because Jason keeps trolling me as a Trump</p>
<p>supporter.</p>
<p>And then on top of it, I get cut out of the only good bestie deal.</p>
<p>If you would‚Äî</p>
<p>I thought at least I would get this bestie deal.</p>
<p>And you guys cut me out of it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Listen, I just want to be clear.</p>
<p>Sachs is a conservative and a Republican.</p>
<p>He is not a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>He did not vote for Trump.</p>
<p>This time he did not vote for Trump.</p>
<p>Last time, he does not support Trump&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t out what he&rsquo;s voting, dude.</p>
<p>Sorry, but he told me he didn&rsquo;t vote for him.</p>
<p>Well, he did.</p>
<p>Which one of us is going to try to hire Jared Kushner as a general partner?</p>
<p>No, definitely not.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re saying most likely, because now you&rsquo;re reinforcing the theme, that&rsquo;s‚Äî</p>
<p>Actually, if you had to pick a venture fund that is most likely to hire Jared Kushner as a GP.</p>
<p>And Jason Horowitz.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll do anything for business.</p>
<p>Are they still around?</p>
<p>Founders Fund.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Peter wants to share the spotlight.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go with Jason.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll do anything to get a press release.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that guy needs a fund to go work at.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;ll just go buy another‚Äî</p>
<p>You know, he did get three Middle East peace deals done.</p>
<p>So, but, you know.</p>
<p>By the way, by the way, I mean, talking about inheriting incredible dividends, but</p>
<p>is it the most incredible thing that you can come in and get Middle East peace done,</p>
<p>but if you really unpack Middle East peace,</p>
<p>do you think that Middle East peace would have happened</p>
<p>if the cost of solar was not cheaper than the cost of oil?</p>
<p>Honestly, like, if you didn&rsquo;t see an end in sight to oil,</p>
<p>do you think that the Middle East peace deal would have gotten done?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Well, I know what you&rsquo;re saying, which is that if the Middle East wasn&rsquo;t becoming</p>
<p>less strategically relevant to us, you know, that creates degrees of freedom, I think.</p>
<p>But, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s had profound benefits for Silicon Valley too, right?</p>
<p>I mean, all this money that went into the Vision Fund and the money from Qatar and the money from</p>
<p>like all these sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East has funded a lot of venture funds,</p>
<p>has gone into direct late-stage rounds in a lot of companies, and it&rsquo;s really been a great</p>
<p>boom for Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>People can make fun of the companies getting overfunded and the nonsense that&rsquo;s gone on all</p>
<p>they want.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better that than gold-plated Ferraris.</p>
<p>It filters out into more angel investing, it filters out into more venture LPs,</p>
<p>and it ultimately gives a big boost to this ecosystem.</p>
<p>So, I think that the damage to oil has been great for Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The most incredible dividend of climate change is peace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it has made radical Islam a failed startup, you know, a hyped Series A that</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t raise its Series B.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made, you know, sworn enemies over thousands of years cooperate together, all for what</p>
<p>reason?</p>
<p>Because you got to pull the oil out of the ground now and monetize it, because otherwise,</p>
<p>the cost of wind and the cost of solar‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And you have to diversify, yeah.</p>
<p>And you have to diversify, because otherwise, the cost of wind and the cost of solar is</p>
<p>going to make pulling the oil out of the ground economically infeasible within three or four</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you already can&rsquo;t do it offshore.</p>
<p>They took Saudi Aramco public, they started selling off the shares, and they invested</p>
<p>that capital in tech and other stuff around the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been helpful, but there is another factor at work, which is the fear of Iran is now</p>
<p>greater than on the part of Saudi Arabia and Israel.</p>
<p>Their fear of Iran is now greater than whatever mutual hostility they used to have.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s kind of bringing people together that way.</p>
<p>But you got to give Krishna credit for still getting those deals done.</p>
<p>You know, no one thought he could do it.</p>
<p>I remember everyone was mocking him.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a moron, and he&rsquo;s the opposite of an abrasive guy, and he&rsquo;s very thoughtful</p>
<p>and apparently very, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know him personally, but he&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to be very smart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that wherever he ends up next, he&rsquo;s going to do very well, and he&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>get invited to be in a lot of places.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s clear he did a very good job on the Middle East stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, how crazy is it that Trump delivers on hottest economy ever, peace in the Middle</p>
<p>East, and three vaccines for coronavirus, and he&rsquo;s still lost?</p>
<p>Who would have thought that?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it does go to tell you what people think of character.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you watch how he tweets, but he&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>He tweeted himself out of office.</p>
<p>If he acted normal, Sachs, he could actually take those victories.</p>
<p>If he stopped the personal attacks, if he stopped the grifting, he would have won.</p>
<p>He would have won.</p>
<p>He could have been, he actually, it would have been more than one.</p>
<p>He could have been Reagan.</p>
<p>If he came in, if he came, he could, it&rsquo;s exactly what I was thinking.</p>
<p>If he came in in 2016, calm, cool, and collected with a team where there was a dial down the</p>
<p>insecurity and dial up sort of the intensity of actually calling people out for not passing</p>
<p>progressive change, he would have been elected in a landslide.</p>
<p>People would have said, well, on the way in, we were afraid.</p>
<p>But after four years, the guy actually-</p>
<p>He could have been magnanimous, is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it was a real missed opportunity for him.</p>
<p>I still think much of Trump is he&rsquo;s a WWE superstar, and that&rsquo;s what people voted for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why Jesse Ventura got elected governor of Minnesota.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why Arnold Schwarzenegger got elected governor of California.</p>
<p>The average person that&rsquo;s looking at that guy versus the old dude that doesn&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>and saying some weird stuff about policy, it&rsquo;s like, oh, man, that guy looks awesome.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put him in office.</p>
<p>This is going to be fucking fun.</p>
<p>And if he turned it down when he got in office, he&rsquo;d be much less appealing, I think, to a</p>
<p>lot of people.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the caricature of himself that makes him so appealing.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d like to go on the record with my 15-year projection then, which is that The</p>
<p>Rock is going to run for president.</p>
<p>I think the Iran situation, just to put that in perspective, David, if you look at the</p>
<p>age distribution on the chart I just put in the chat, it is just extraordinary how young</p>
<p>that country is.</p>
<p>The median age is, I think, 28 or 29 years old, and they&rsquo;re barely holding on to power</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>And it is going to flip into a much more progressive society than it is now.</p>
<p>They are barely holding on.</p>
<p>When you look at how many 25-year-olds and 30-year-olds there are in that country who</p>
<p>are drinking and watching TV and VPNs, and they have the internet, and they&rsquo;re watching</p>
<p>porn, and they&rsquo;re gambling, I&rsquo;m sure, and buying Bitcoin and doing all this crazy stuff,</p>
<p>that country is barely holding on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a crazy civil war.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just hope they don&rsquo;t have nuclear bombs when that civil war happens.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys, guys, guys, being extremist, it&rsquo;s just a bad product market fit now.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not worth it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no money to fund it.</p>
<p>Nobody cares that much anymore.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s moved on.</p>
<p>Low NPS score.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Would you recommend extremism to a friend or family member?</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>All right, this has been another all-in podcast for Bestie C, the Rain Man David Sacks, and</p>
<p>the Queen of Quinoa on his coming out party today, IPO coming up for Metro Mile.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Friedberg.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Chamath on the pipe.</p>
<p>Sacks and I, we&rsquo;re going to have to figure out a way to lick our wounds and wet our beaks.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put our thinking caps on, and over the break, find a deal we can exclude these two</p>
<p>from because we got to get in early, get 30% of a company, and then we got to have Chamath,</p>
<p>Spackett, and Friedberg do the late stage deal with all this Metro Mile money.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the all-in podcast.</p>
<p>That was fucking great.</p>
<p>Best one yet.</p>
<p>You guys want to see something funny?</p>
<p>You guys see that video my wife just sent me?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a shit on your driveway, Sacks.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>I want to see that deuce.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a code 13 again.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one person who has a code 13.</p>
<p>Chamath, can you take a shit on his Model X?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;d all have code 13.</p>
<p>Oh, no, everybody.</p>
<p>Can we roll over the credits?</p>
