    <p>The following is a conversation with Stuart Russell. He&rsquo;s a professor of computer science at</p>
<p>UC Berkeley and a coauthor of a book that introduced me and millions of other people</p>
<p>to the amazing world of AI called Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach. So it was an</p>
<p>honor for me to have this conversation as part of MIT course in artificial general intelligence</p>
<p>and the artificial intelligence podcast. If you enjoy it, please subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>iTunes or your podcast provider of choice, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman</p>
<p>spelled F R I D. And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Stuart Russell.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned in 1975 in high school, you&rsquo;ve created one of your first AI programs</p>
<p>that play chess. Were you ever able to build a program that beat you at chess or another board</p>
<p>game? So my program never beat me at chess. I actually wrote the program at Imperial College.</p>
<p>So I used to take the bus every Wednesday with a box of cards this big and shove them into the</p>
<p>card reader. And they gave us eight seconds of CPU time. It took about five seconds to read the cards</p>
<p>in and compile the code. So we had three seconds of CPU time, which was enough to make one move,</p>
<p>you know, with a not very deep search. And then we would print that move out and then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have to go to the back of the queue and wait to feed the cards in again.</p>
<p>How deep was the search? Are we talking about one move, two moves, three moves?</p>
<p>No, I think we got an eight move, a depth eight with alpha beta. And we had some tricks of our</p>
<p>own about move ordering and some pruning of the tree. But you were still able to beat that program?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I was a reasonable chess player in my youth. I did an Othello program and a</p>
<p>backgammon program. So when I got to Berkeley, I worked a lot on what we call meta reasoning,</p>
<p>which really means reasoning about reasoning. And in the case of a game playing program,</p>
<p>you need to reason about what parts of the search tree you&rsquo;re actually going to explore because the</p>
<p>search tree is enormous, bigger than the number of atoms in the universe. And the way programs</p>
<p>succeed and the way humans succeed is by only looking at a small fraction of the search tree.</p>
<p>And if you look at the right fraction, you play really well. If you look at the wrong fraction,</p>
<p>if you waste your time thinking about things that are never going to happen,</p>
<p>moves that no one&rsquo;s ever going to make, then you&rsquo;re going to lose because you won&rsquo;t be able</p>
<p>to figure out the right decision. So that question of how machines can manage their own computation,</p>
<p>how they decide what to think about, is the meta reasoning question. And we developed some methods</p>
<p>for doing that. And very simply, the machine should think about whatever thoughts are going</p>
<p>to improve its decision quality. We were able to show that both for Othello, which is a standard</p>
<p>two player game, and for Backgammon, which includes dice rolls, so it&rsquo;s a two player game</p>
<p>with uncertainty. For both of those cases, we could come up with algorithms that were actually</p>
<p>much more efficient than the standard alpha beta search, which chess programs at the time were</p>
<p>using. And that those programs could beat me. And I think you can see the same basic ideas in Alpha</p>
<p>Go and Alpha Zero today. The way they explore the tree is using a form of meta reasoning to select</p>
<p>what to think about based on how useful it is to think about it. Is there any insights you can</p>
<p>describe with our Greek symbols of how do we select which paths to go down? There&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>two kinds of learning going on. So as you say, Alpha Go learns to evaluate board positions. So</p>
<p>it can look at a go board. And it actually has probably a superhuman ability to instantly tell</p>
<p>how promising that situation is. To me, the amazing thing about Alpha Go is not that it can</p>
<p>be the world champion with its hands tied behind his back, but the fact that if you stop it from</p>
<p>searching altogether, so you say, okay, you&rsquo;re not allowed to do any thinking ahead. You can just</p>
<p>consider each of your legal moves and then look at the resulting situation and evaluate it. So</p>
<p>what we call a depth one search. So just the immediate outcome of your moves and decide if</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good or bad. That version of Alpha Go can still play at a professional level.</p>
<p>And human professionals are sitting there for five, 10 minutes deciding what to do and Alpha Go</p>
<p>in less than a second can instantly intuit what is the right move to make based on its ability to</p>
<p>evaluate positions. And that is remarkable because we don&rsquo;t have that level of intuition about Go.</p>
<p>We actually have to think about the situation. So anyway, that capability that Alpha Go has is one</p>
<p>big part of why it beats humans. The other big part is that it&rsquo;s able to look ahead 40, 50, 60 moves</p>
<p>into the future. And if it was considering all possibilities, 40 or 50 or 60 moves into the</p>
<p>future, that would be 10 to the 200 possibilities. So way more than atoms in the universe and so on.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, very selective about what it looks at. So let me try to give you an intuition about</p>
<p>how you decide what to think about. It&rsquo;s a combination of two things. One is how promising</p>
<p>it is. So if you&rsquo;re already convinced that a move is terrible, there&rsquo;s no point spending a lot more</p>
<p>time convincing yourself that it&rsquo;s terrible because it&rsquo;s probably not going to change your mind. So</p>
<p>the real reason you think is because there&rsquo;s some possibility of changing your mind about what to do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that changing your mind that would result then in a better final action in the real world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the purpose of thinking is to improve the final action in the real world. So if you</p>
<p>think about a move that is guaranteed to be terrible, you can convince yourself it&rsquo;s terrible,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still not going to change your mind. But on the other hand, suppose you had a choice between</p>
<p>two moves. One of them you&rsquo;ve already figured out is guaranteed to be a draw, let&rsquo;s say. And then</p>
<p>the other one looks a little bit worse. It looks fairly likely that if you make that move, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to lose. But there&rsquo;s still some uncertainty about the value of that move. There&rsquo;s still some</p>
<p>possibility that it will turn out to be a win. Then it&rsquo;s worth thinking about that. So even though</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less promising on average than the other move, which is a good move, it&rsquo;s worth thinking</p>
<p>about on average than the other move, which is guaranteed to be a draw. There&rsquo;s still some</p>
<p>purpose in thinking about it because there&rsquo;s a chance that you will change your mind and discover</p>
<p>that in fact it&rsquo;s a better move. So it&rsquo;s a combination of how good the move appears to be</p>
<p>and how much uncertainty there is about its value. The more uncertainty, the more it&rsquo;s worth thinking</p>
<p>about because there&rsquo;s a higher upside if you want to think of it that way.</p>
<p>And of course in the beginning, especially in the AlphaGo Zero formulation, everything is shrouded</p>
<p>in uncertainty. So you&rsquo;re really swimming in a sea of uncertainty. So it benefits you to,</p>
<p>I mean, actually following the same process as you described, but because you&rsquo;re so uncertain</p>
<p>about everything, you basically have to try a lot of different directions.</p>
<p>Yeah. So the early parts of the search tree are fairly bushy that it will look at a lot</p>
<p>of different possibilities, but fairly quickly, the degree of certainty about some of the moves,</p>
<p>I mean, if a move is really terrible, you&rsquo;ll pretty quickly find out, right? You lose half</p>
<p>your pieces or half your territory and then you&rsquo;ll say, okay, this is not worth thinking</p>
<p>about anymore. And then so further down the tree becomes very long and narrow and you&rsquo;re following</p>
<p>various lines of play, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 moves into the future. And that again is something that</p>
<p>human beings have a very hard time doing mainly because they just lack the short term memory.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t remember a sequence of moves that&rsquo;s 50 moves long. And you can&rsquo;t imagine</p>
<p>the board correctly for that many moves into the future.</p>
<p>Of course, the top players, I&rsquo;m much more familiar with chess, but the top players probably have,</p>
<p>they have echoes of the same kind of intuition instinct that in a moment&rsquo;s time AlphaGo applies</p>
<p>when they see a board. I mean, they&rsquo;ve seen those patterns, human beings have seen those patterns</p>
<p>before at the top, at the grandmaster level. It seems that there is some similarities or maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s our imagination creates a vision of those similarities, but it feels like this kind of</p>
<p>pattern recognition that the AlphaGo approaches are using is similar to what human beings at the</p>
<p>top level are using.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s some truth to that, but not entirely. Yeah. I mean, I think the,</p>
<p>the extent to which a human grandmaster can reliably instantly recognize the right move</p>
<p>and instantly recognize the value of the position. I think that&rsquo;s a little bit overrated.</p>
<p>But if you sacrifice a queen, for example, I mean, there&rsquo;s these, there&rsquo;s these beautiful games of</p>
<p>chess with Bobby Fischer, somebody where it&rsquo;s seeming to make a bad move. And I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a perfect degree of calculation involved where they&rsquo;ve calculated all the possible things</p>
<p>that happen, but there&rsquo;s an instinct there, right? That somehow adds up to</p>
<p>Yeah. So I think what happens is you, you, you get a sense that there&rsquo;s some possibility in the</p>
<p>position, even if you make a weird looking move, that it opens up some, some lines of,</p>
<p>of calculation that otherwise would be definitely bad. And, and it&rsquo;s that intuition that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something here in this position that might, might yield a win.</p>
<p>And then you follow that, right? And, and in some sense, when a, when a chess player is</p>
<p>following a line and in his or her mind, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re mentally simulating what the other person</p>
<p>is going to do, what the opponent is going to do. And they can do that as long as the moves are kind</p>
<p>of forced, right? As long as there&rsquo;s, you know, there&rsquo;s a, a fort we call a forcing variation</p>
<p>where the opponent doesn&rsquo;t really have much choice how to respond. And then you follow that,</p>
<p>how to respond. And then you see if you can force them into a situation where you win.</p>
<p>You know, we see plenty of mistakes even, even in grandmaster games where they just miss some</p>
<p>simple three, four, five move combination that, you know, wasn&rsquo;t particularly apparent in,</p>
<p>in the position, but was still there. That&rsquo;s the thing that makes us human.</p>
<p>Yeah. So when you mentioned that in Othello, those games were after some matter reasoning</p>
<p>improvements and research was able to beat you. How did that make you feel?</p>
<p>Part of the meta reasoning capability that it had was based on learning and, and you could</p>
<p>sit down the next day and you could just feel that it had got a lot smarter, you know, and all of a</p>
<p>sudden you really felt like you&rsquo;re sort of pressed against the wall because it was, it was much more</p>
<p>aggressive and, and was totally unforgiving of any minor mistake that you might make. And, and</p>
<p>actually it seemed understood the game better than I did. And Gary Kasparov has this quote where</p>
<p>during his match against Deep Blue, he said, he suddenly felt that there was a new kind of</p>
<p>intelligence across the board. Do you think that&rsquo;s a scary or an exciting</p>
<p>possibility for, for Kasparov and for yourself in, in the context of chess, purely sort of</p>
<p>in this, like that feeling, whatever that is? I think it&rsquo;s definitely an exciting feeling.</p>
<p>You know, this is what made me work on AI in the first place was as soon as I really understood</p>
<p>what a computer was, I wanted to make it smart. You know, I started out with the first program</p>
<p>I wrote was for the Sinclair programmable calculator. And I think you could write a</p>
<p>21 step algorithm. That was the biggest program you could write, something like that. And do</p>
<p>little arithmetic calculations. So I think I implemented Newton&rsquo;s method for a square</p>
<p>roots and a few other things like that. But then, you know, I thought, okay, if I just had more</p>
<p>space, I could make this thing intelligent. And so I started thinking about AI and,</p>
<p>and I think the, the, the thing that&rsquo;s scary is not, is not the chess program</p>
<p>because, you know, chess programs, they&rsquo;re not in the taking over the world business.</p>
<p>But if you extrapolate, you know, there are things about chess that don&rsquo;t resemble</p>
<p>the real world, right? We know, we know the rules of chess.</p>
<p>The chess board is completely visible to the program where of course the real world is not</p>
<p>most, most of the real world is, is not visible from wherever you&rsquo;re sitting, so to speak.</p>
<p>And to overcome those kinds of problems, you need qualitatively different algorithms. Another thing</p>
<p>about the real world is that, you know, we, we regularly plan ahead on the timescales involving</p>
<p>billions or trillions of steps. Now we don&rsquo;t plan those in detail, but you know, when you</p>
<p>choose to do a PhD at Berkeley, that&rsquo;s a five year commitment and that amounts to about a trillion</p>
<p>motor control steps that you will eventually be committed to. Including going up the stairs,</p>
<p>opening doors, drinking water. Yeah. I mean, every, every finger movement while you&rsquo;re typing,</p>
<p>every character of every paper and the thesis and everything. So you&rsquo;re not committing in</p>
<p>advance to the specific motor control steps, but you&rsquo;re still reasoning on a timescale that</p>
<p>will eventually reduce to trillions of motor control actions. And so for all of these reasons,</p>
<p>you know, AlphaGo and Deep Blue and so on don&rsquo;t represent any kind of threat to humanity,</p>
<p>but they are a step towards it, right? And progress in AI occurs by essentially removing</p>
<p>one by one these assumptions that make problems easy. Like the assumption of complete observability</p>
<p>of the situation, right? We remove that assumption, you need a much more complicated</p>
<p>kind of computing design. It needs, it needs something that actually keeps track of all the</p>
<p>things you can&rsquo;t see and tries to estimate what&rsquo;s going on. And there&rsquo;s inevitable uncertainty</p>
<p>in that. So it becomes a much more complicated problem. But, you know, we are removing those</p>
<p>assumptions. We are starting to have algorithms that can cope with much longer timescales,</p>
<p>that can cope with uncertainty, that can cope with partial observability.</p>
<p>And so each of those steps sort of magnifies by a thousand the range of things that we can</p>
<p>do with AI systems. So the way I started in AI, I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time. I</p>
<p>wanted to understand the mind in high school and of course program and so on. And I showed up</p>
<p>University of Illinois to an AI lab and they said, okay, I don&rsquo;t have time for you,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s a book, AI and Modern Approach. I think it was the first edition at the time.</p>
<p>Here, go, go, go learn this. And I remember the lay of the land was, well, it&rsquo;s incredible that</p>
<p>we solved chess, but we&rsquo;ll never solve go. I mean, it was pretty certain that go</p>
<p>in the way we thought about systems that reason wasn&rsquo;t possible to solve. And now we&rsquo;ve solved</p>
<p>this. So it&rsquo;s a very&hellip; Well, I think I would have said that it&rsquo;s unlikely we could take</p>
<p>the kind of algorithm that was used for chess and just get it to scale up and work well for go.</p>
<p>And at the time what we thought was that in order to solve go, we would have to do something similar</p>
<p>to the way humans manage the complexity of go, which is to break it down into kind of sub games.</p>
<p>So when a human thinks about a go board, they think about different parts of the board as sort</p>
<p>of weakly connected to each other. And they think about, okay, within this part of the board, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how things could go in that part of board, here&rsquo;s how things could go. And then you try to sort of</p>
<p>couple those two analyses together and deal with the interactions and maybe revise your views of</p>
<p>how things are going to go in each part. And then you&rsquo;ve got maybe five, six, seven, ten parts of</p>
<p>the board. And that actually resembles the real world much more than chess does because in the</p>
<p>real world, we have work, we have home life, we have sport, different kinds of activities,</p>
<p>shopping, these all are connected to each other, but they&rsquo;re weakly connected. So when I&rsquo;m typing</p>
<p>a paper, I don&rsquo;t simultaneously have to decide which order I&rsquo;m going to get the milk and the</p>
<p>butter, that doesn&rsquo;t affect the typing. But I do need to realize, okay, I better finish this</p>
<p>before the shops close because I don&rsquo;t have anything, I don&rsquo;t have any food at home. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some weak connection, but not in the way that chess works where everything is tied into a</p>
<p>single stream of thought. So the thought was that to solve go, we&rsquo;d have to make progress on stuff</p>
<p>that would be useful for the real world. And in a way, AlphaGo is a little bit disappointing,</p>
<p>right? Because the program designed for AlphaGo is actually not that different from Deep Blue</p>
<p>or even from Arthur Samuel&rsquo;s checker playing program from the 1950s. And in fact, the two</p>
<p>things that make AlphaGo work is one is this amazing ability to evaluate the positions,</p>
<p>and the other is the meta reasoning capability, which allows it to</p>
<p>explore some paths in the tree very deeply and to abandon other paths very quickly.</p>
<p>So this word meta reasoning, while technically correct, inspires perhaps the wrong degree of</p>
<p>power that AlphaGo has, for example, the word reasoning is a powerful word. So let me ask you,</p>
<p>sort of, you were part of the symbolic AI world for a while, like AI was, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>excellent, interesting ideas there that unfortunately met a winter. And so do you think it reemerges?</p>
<p>So I would say, yeah, it&rsquo;s not quite as simple as that. So the AI winter</p>
<p>for the first winter that was actually named as such was the one in the late 80s.</p>
<p>And that came about because in the mid 80s, there was a really a concerted attempt to push AI</p>
<p>out into the real world using what was called expert system technology. And for the most part,</p>
<p>that technology was just not ready for primetime. They were trying, in many cases, to do a form of</p>
<p>uncertain reasoning, judgment, combinations of evidence, diagnosis, those kinds of things,</p>
<p>which was simply invalid. And when you try to apply invalid reasoning methods to real problems,</p>
<p>you can fudge it for small versions of the problem. But when it starts to get larger,</p>
<p>the thing just falls apart. So many companies found that the stuff just didn&rsquo;t work, and they</p>
<p>were spending tons of money on consultants to try to make it work. And there were other</p>
<p>practical reasons, like they were asking the companies to buy incredibly expensive</p>
<p>Lisp machine workstations, which were literally between $50,000 and $100,000 in 1980s money,</p>
<p>which would be like between $150,000 and $300,000 per workstation in current prices.</p>
<p>And then the bottom line, they weren&rsquo;t seeing a profit from it.</p>
<p>Yeah, in many cases. I think there were some successes, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that. But</p>
<p>people, I would say, overinvested. Every major company was starting an AI department, just like</p>
<p>now. And I worry a bit that we might see similar disappointments, not because the current technology</p>
<p>is invalid, but it&rsquo;s limited in its scope. And it&rsquo;s almost the duel of the scope problems that</p>
<p>expert systems had. So what have you learned from that hype cycle? And what can we do to</p>
<p>prevent another winter, for example? Yeah, so when I&rsquo;m giving talks these days,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the warnings that I give. So this is a two part warning slide. One is that rather</p>
<p>than data being the new oil, data is the new snake oil. That&rsquo;s a good line. And then the other</p>
<p>is that we might see a kind of very visible failure in some of the major application areas. And I think</p>
<p>self driving cars would be the flagship. And I think when you look at the history,</p>
<p>so the first self driving car was on the freeway, driving itself, changing lanes, overtaking in 1987.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s more than 30 years. And that kind of looks like where we are today, right? You know,</p>
<p>prototypes on the freeway, changing lanes and overtaking. Now, I think that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been made, particularly on the perception side. So we worked a lot on autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>in the early mid 90s at Berkeley. And we had our own big demonstrations. We put congressmen into</p>
<p>self driving cars and had them zooming along the freeway. And the problem was clearly perception.</p>
<p>At the time, the problem was perception. Yeah. So in simulation, with perfect perception,</p>
<p>you could actually show that you can drive safely for a long time, even if the other cars are</p>
<p>misbehaving and so on. But simultaneously, we worked on machine vision for detecting cars and</p>
<p>tracking pedestrians and so on. And we couldn&rsquo;t get the cars to do that. And so we had to do</p>
<p>that for pedestrians and so on. And we couldn&rsquo;t get the reliability of detection and tracking</p>
<p>up to a high enough level, particularly in bad weather conditions, nighttime,</p>
<p>rainfall. Good enough for demos, but perhaps not good enough to cover the general operation.</p>
<p>Yeah. So the thing about driving is, you know, suppose you&rsquo;re a taxi driver, you know,</p>
<p>and you drive every day, eight hours a day for 10 years, right? That&rsquo;s 100 million seconds of</p>
<p>driving, you know, and any one of those seconds, you can make a fatal mistake. So you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about eight nines of reliability, right? Now, if your vision system only detects 98.3% of the</p>
<p>vehicles, right, then that&rsquo;s sort of, you know, one in a bit nines of reliability. So you have</p>
<p>another seven orders of magnitude to go. And this is what people don&rsquo;t understand. They think,</p>
<p>oh, because I had a successful demo, I&rsquo;m pretty much done. But you&rsquo;re not even within seven orders</p>
<p>of magnitude of being done. And that&rsquo;s the difficulty. And it&rsquo;s not the, can I follow a</p>
<p>white line? That&rsquo;s not the problem, right? We follow a white line all the way across the country.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the weird stuff that happens. It&rsquo;s all the edge cases, yeah.</p>
<p>The edge case, other drivers doing weird things. You know, so if you talk to Google, right, so</p>
<p>they had actually a very classical architecture where, you know, you had machine vision which</p>
<p>would detect all the other cars and pedestrians and the white lines and the road signs. And then</p>
<p>basically that was fed into a logical database. And then you had a classical 1970s rule based</p>
<p>expert system telling you, okay, if you&rsquo;re in the middle lane and there&rsquo;s a bicyclist in the right</p>
<p>lane who is signaling this, then you do that, right? And what they found was that every day</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d go out and there&rsquo;d be another situation that the rules didn&rsquo;t cover. You know, so they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>come to a traffic circle and there&rsquo;s a little girl riding her bicycle the wrong way around</p>
<p>the traffic circle. Okay, what do you do? We don&rsquo;t have a rule. Oh my God. Okay, stop.</p>
<p>And then, you know, they come back and add more rules and they just found that this was not really</p>
<p>converging. And if you think about it, right, how do you deal with an unexpected situation,</p>
<p>meaning one that you&rsquo;ve never previously encountered and the sort of reasoning required</p>
<p>to figure out the solution for that situation has never been done. It doesn&rsquo;t match any previous</p>
<p>situation in terms of the kind of reasoning you have to do. Well, you know, in chess programs,</p>
<p>this happens all the time, right? You&rsquo;re constantly coming up with situations you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seen before and you have to reason about them and you have to think about, okay, here are the</p>
<p>possible things I could do. Here are the outcomes. Here&rsquo;s how desirable the outcomes are and then</p>
<p>pick the right one. You know, in the 90s, we were saying, okay, this is how you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>do automated vehicles. They&rsquo;re going to have to have a look ahead capability, but the look ahead</p>
<p>for driving is more difficult than it is for chess because there&rsquo;s humans and they&rsquo;re less</p>
<p>predictable than chess pieces. Well, then you have an opponent in chess who&rsquo;s also somewhat</p>
<p>unpredictable. But for example, in chess, you always know the opponent&rsquo;s intention. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to beat you, right? Whereas in driving, you don&rsquo;t know is this guy trying to turn left</p>
<p>or has he just forgotten to turn off his turn signal or is he drunk or is he changing the</p>
<p>channel on his radio or whatever it might be. You&rsquo;ve got to try and figure out the mental state,</p>
<p>the intent of the other drivers to forecast the possible evolutions of their trajectories.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got to figure out, okay, which is the trajectory for me that&rsquo;s going to be safest.</p>
<p>And those all interact with each other because the other drivers are going to react to your</p>
<p>trajectory and so on. So, you know, they&rsquo;ve got the classic merging onto the freeway problem where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of racing a vehicle that&rsquo;s already on the freeway and you&rsquo;re going to pull ahead of</p>
<p>them or you&rsquo;re going to let them go first and pull in behind and you get this sort of uncertainty</p>
<p>about who&rsquo;s going first. So all those kinds of things mean that you need a decision making</p>
<p>architecture that&rsquo;s very different from either a rule based system or it seems to me kind of an</p>
<p>end to end neural network system. So just as AlphaGo is pretty good when it doesn&rsquo;t do any</p>
<p>look ahead, but it&rsquo;s way, way, way, way better when it does, I think the same is going to be</p>
<p>true for driving. You can have a driving system that&rsquo;s pretty good when it doesn&rsquo;t do any look</p>
<p>ahead, but that&rsquo;s not good enough. And we&rsquo;ve already seen multiple deaths caused by poorly</p>
<p>designed machine learning algorithms that don&rsquo;t really understand what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah. On several levels, I think on the perception side, there&rsquo;s mistakes being made by those</p>
<p>algorithms where the perception is very shallow. On the planning side, the look ahead, like you</p>
<p>said, and the thing that we come up against that&rsquo;s really interesting when you try to deploy systems</p>
<p>in the real world is you can&rsquo;t think of an artificial intelligence system as a thing that</p>
<p>responds to the world always. You have to realize that it&rsquo;s an agent that others will respond to as</p>
<p>well. So in order to drive successfully, you can&rsquo;t just try to do obstacle avoidance.</p>
<p>Right. You can&rsquo;t pretend that you&rsquo;re invisible, right? You&rsquo;re the invisible car.</p>
<p>Right. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>I mean, but you have to assert yet others have to be scared of you. Just we&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this tension, there&rsquo;s this game. So if we study a lot of work with pedestrians,</p>
<p>if you approach pedestrians as purely an obstacle avoidance, so you&rsquo;re doing look ahead as in</p>
<p>modeling the intent that they&rsquo;re not going to, they&rsquo;re going to take advantage of you. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to respect you at all. There has to be a tension, a fear, some amount of uncertainty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we have created.</p>
<p>Or at least just a kind of a resoluteness. You have to display a certain amount of</p>
<p>resoluteness. You can&rsquo;t be too tentative. And yeah, so the solutions then become</p>
<p>pretty complicated, right? You get into game theoretic analyses. And so at Berkeley now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re working a lot on this kind of interaction between machines and humans.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>And so my colleague, Ankur Dragan, actually, if you formulate the problem game theoretically,</p>
<p>you just let the system figure out the solution. It does interesting unexpected things. Like</p>
<p>sometimes at a stop sign, if no one is going first, the car will actually back up a little,</p>
<p>right? And just to indicate to the other cars that they should go. And that&rsquo;s something it</p>
<p>invented entirely by itself. We didn&rsquo;t say this is the language of communication at stop signs.</p>
<p>It figured it out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting. So let me one just step back for a second. Just this beautiful</p>
<p>philosophical notion. So Pamela McCordick in 1979 wrote, AI began with the ancient wish to</p>
<p>forge the gods. So when you think about the history of our civilization, do you think</p>
<p>that there is an inherent desire to create, let&rsquo;s not say gods, but to create superintelligence?</p>
<p>Is it inherent to us? Is it in our genes? That the natural arc of human civilization is to create</p>
<p>things that are of greater and greater power and perhaps echoes of ourselves. So to create the gods</p>
<p>as Pamela said. Maybe. I mean, we&rsquo;re all individuals, but certainly we see over and over</p>
<p>again in history, individuals who thought about this possibility. Hopefully when I&rsquo;m not being too</p>
<p>philosophical here, but if you look at the arc of this, where this is going and we&rsquo;ll talk about AI</p>
<p>safety, we&rsquo;ll talk about greater and greater intelligence. Do you see that there in, when you</p>
<p>created the Othello program and you felt this excitement, what was that excitement? Was it</p>
<p>excitement of a tinkerer who created something cool like a clock? Or was there a magic or was</p>
<p>it more like a child being born? Yeah. So I mean, I certainly understand that viewpoint. And if you</p>
<p>look at the Lighthill report, which was, so in the 70s, there was a lot of controversy in the UK</p>
<p>about AI and whether it was for real and how much money the government should invest. And</p>
<p>there was a long story, but the government commissioned a report by Lighthill, who was a</p>
<p>physicist, and he wrote a very damning report about AI, which I think was the point. And he</p>
<p>said that these are frustrated men who are unable to have children would like to create and create</p>
<p>a life as a kind of replacement, which I think is really pretty unfair. But there is a kind of magic,</p>
<p>I would say, when you build something and what you&rsquo;re building in is really just, you&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>in some understanding of the principles of learning and decision making. And to see those</p>
<p>principles actually then turn into intelligent behavior in specific situations, it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>incredible thing. And that is naturally going to make you think, okay, where does this end?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s magical optimistic views of where it ends, whatever your view of optimism is,</p>
<p>whatever your view of utopia is, it&rsquo;s probably different for everybody. But you&rsquo;ve often talked</p>
<p>about concerns you have of how things may go wrong. So I&rsquo;ve talked to Max Tegmark. There&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of interesting ways to think about AI safety. You&rsquo;re one of the seminal people thinking about</p>
<p>this problem amongst sort of being in the weeds of actually solving specific AI problems. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also thinking about the big picture of where are we going? So can you talk about several elements</p>
<p>of it? Let&rsquo;s just talk about maybe the control problem. So this idea of losing ability to control</p>
<p>the behavior in our AI system. So how do you see that? How do you see that coming about?</p>
<p>What do you think we can do to manage it?</p>
<p>Well, so it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to realize that if you make something that&rsquo;s smarter than you,</p>
<p>you might have a problem. Alan Turing wrote about this and gave lectures about this in 1951.</p>
<p>He did a lecture on the radio and he basically says, once the machine thinking method starts,</p>
<p>very quickly they&rsquo;ll outstrip humanity. And if we&rsquo;re lucky, we might be able to turn off the power</p>
<p>at strategic moments, but even so, our species would be humbled. Actually, he was wrong about</p>
<p>that. If it&rsquo;s sufficiently intelligent machine, it&rsquo;s not going to let you switch it off. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually in competition with you. So what do you think is most likely going to happen?</p>
<p>What do you think is meant just for a quick tangent, if we shut off this super intelligent</p>
<p>machine that our species will be humbled? I think he means that we would realize that</p>
<p>we are inferior, right? That we only survive by the skin of our teeth because we happen to get</p>
<p>to the off switch just in time. And if we hadn&rsquo;t, then we would have lost control over the earth.</p>
<p>Are you more worried when you think about this stuff about super intelligent AI,</p>
<p>or are you more worried about super powerful AI that&rsquo;s not aligned with our values? So the</p>
<p>paperclip scenarios kind of&hellip; So the main problem I&rsquo;m working on is the control problem, the problem</p>
<p>of machines pursuing objectives that are, as you say, not aligned with human objectives. And</p>
<p>this has been the way we&rsquo;ve thought about AI since the beginning.</p>
<p>You build a machine for optimizing, and then you put in some objective, and it optimizes, right?</p>
<p>And we can think of this as the King Midas problem, right? Because if the King Midas put</p>
<p>in this objective, everything I touch should turn to gold. And the gods, that&rsquo;s like the machine,</p>
<p>they said, okay, done. You now have this power. And of course, his father,</p>
<p>his drink, and his family all turned to gold. And then he dies of misery and starvation. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a warning, it&rsquo;s a failure mode that pretty much every culture in history has had some story</p>
<p>along the same lines. There&rsquo;s the genie that gives you three wishes, and the third wish is always,</p>
<p>you know, please undo the first two wishes because I messed up. And when Arthur Samuel wrote his</p>
<p>checker playing program, which learned to play checkers considerably better than</p>
<p>Arthur Samuel could play, and actually reached a pretty decent standard.</p>
<p>Norbert Wiener, who was one of the major mathematicians of the 20th century,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s sort of the father of modern automation control systems. He saw this and he basically</p>
<p>extrapolated, as Turing did, and said, okay, this is how we could lose control.</p>
<p>And specifically, that we have to be certain that the purpose we put into the machine is the</p>
<p>purpose which we really desire. And the problem is, we can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>You mean we&rsquo;re not, it&rsquo;s a very difficult to encode,</p>
<p>to put our values on paper is really difficult, or you&rsquo;re just saying it&rsquo;s impossible?</p>
<p>So theoretically, it&rsquo;s possible, but in practice, it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely that we could</p>
<p>specify correctly in advance, the full range of concerns of humanity.</p>
<p>You talked about cultural transmission of values,</p>
<p>I think is how humans to human transmission of values happens, right?</p>
<p>Well, we learn, yeah, I mean, as we grow up, we learn about the values that matter,</p>
<p>how things should go, what is reasonable to pursue and what isn&rsquo;t reasonable to pursue.</p>
<p>You think machines can learn in the same kind of way?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think that what we need to do is to get away from this idea that</p>
<p>you build an optimising machine, and then you put the objective into it.</p>
<p>Because if it&rsquo;s possible that you might put in a wrong objective, and we already know this is</p>
<p>possible because it&rsquo;s happened lots of times, right? That means that the machine should never</p>
<p>take an objective that&rsquo;s given as gospel truth. Because once it takes the objective as gospel</p>
<p>truth, then it believes that whatever actions it&rsquo;s taking in pursuit of that objective are</p>
<p>the correct things to do. So you could be jumping up and down and saying, no, no, no,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re going to destroy the world, but the machine knows what the true objective is and is</p>
<p>pursuing it, and tough luck to you. And this is not restricted to AI, right? This is, I think,</p>
<p>many of the 20th century technologies, right? So in statistics, you minimise a loss function,</p>
<p>the loss function is exogenously specified. In control theory, you minimise a cost function.</p>
<p>In operations research, you maximise a reward function, and so on. So in all these disciplines,</p>
<p>this is how we conceive of the problem. And it&rsquo;s the wrong problem because we cannot specify</p>
<p>with certainty the correct objective, right? We need uncertainty, we need the machine to be</p>
<p>uncertain about what it is that it&rsquo;s supposed to be maximising.</p>
<p>Favourite idea of yours, I&rsquo;ve heard you say somewhere, well, I shouldn&rsquo;t pick favourites,</p>
<p>but it just sounds beautiful, we need to teach machines humility. It&rsquo;s a beautiful way to put it,</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>That they&rsquo;re humble, they know that they don&rsquo;t know what it is they&rsquo;re supposed to be doing,</p>
<p>and that those objectives, I mean, they exist, they&rsquo;re within us, but we may not be able to</p>
<p>we may not be able to explicate them, we may not even know how we want our future to go.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And the machine, a machine that&rsquo;s uncertain is going to be deferential to us. So if we say,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that, well, now the machines learn something a bit more about our true objectives,</p>
<p>because something that it thought was reasonable in pursuit of our objective,</p>
<p>turns out not to be, so now it&rsquo;s learned something. So it&rsquo;s going to defer because</p>
<p>it wants to be doing what we really want. And that point, I think, is absolutely central</p>
<p>to solving the control problem. And it&rsquo;s a different kind of AI when you take away this</p>
<p>idea that the objective is known, then in fact, a lot of the theoretical frameworks that we&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>familiar with, you know, Markov decision processes, goal based planning, you know,</p>
<p>standard games research, all of these techniques actually become inapplicable.</p>
<p>And you get a more complicated problem because now the interaction with the human becomes part</p>
<p>of the problem. Because the human by making choices is giving you more information about</p>
<p>the true objective and that information helps you achieve the objective better.</p>
<p>And so that really means that you&rsquo;re mostly dealing with game theoretic problems where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got the machine and the human and they&rsquo;re coupled together,</p>
<p>rather than a machine going off by itself with a fixed objective.</p>
<p>LW. Which is fascinating on the machine and the human level that we, when you don&rsquo;t have an</p>
<p>objective, means you&rsquo;re together coming up with an objective. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of philosophy</p>
<p>that, you know, you could argue that life doesn&rsquo;t really have meaning. We together agree on what</p>
<p>gives it meaning and we kind of culturally create things that give why the heck we are on this earth</p>
<p>anyway. We together as a society create that meaning and you have to learn that objective.</p>
<p>And one of the biggest, I thought that&rsquo;s where you were going to go for a second,</p>
<p>one of the biggest troubles we run into outside of statistics and machine learning and AI</p>
<p>and just human civilization is when you look at, I came from, I was born in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and the history of the 20th century, we ran into the most trouble, us humans, when there was a</p>
<p>certainty about the objective and you do whatever it takes to achieve that objective, whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about Germany or communist Russia. You get into trouble with humans.</p>
<p>I would say with, you know, corporations, in fact, some people argue that, you know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to look forward to a time when AI systems take over the world. They already have</p>
<p>and they call corporations, right? That corporations happen to be using people as</p>
<p>components right now, but they are effectively algorithmic machines and they&rsquo;re optimizing</p>
<p>an objective, which is quarterly profit that isn&rsquo;t aligned with overall wellbeing of the human race.</p>
<p>And they are destroying the world. They are primarily responsible for our inability to tackle</p>
<p>climate change. So I think that&rsquo;s one way of thinking about what&rsquo;s going on with corporations,</p>
<p>but I think the point you&rsquo;re making is valid that there are many systems in the real world where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve sort of prematurely fixed on the objective and then decoupled the machine from those that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to be serving. And I think you see this with government, right? Government is supposed to</p>
<p>be a machine that serves people, but instead it tends to be taken over by people who have their</p>
<p>own objective and use government to optimize that objective regardless of what people want.</p>
<p>Do you find appealing the idea of almost arguing machines where you have multiple AI systems with</p>
<p>a clear fixed objective. We have in government, the red team and the blue team, they&rsquo;re very fixed on</p>
<p>their objectives and they argue and they kind of may disagree, but it kind of seems to make it</p>
<p>work somewhat that the duality of it. Okay. Let&rsquo;s go a hundred years back when there was still was</p>
<p>going on or at the founding of this country, there was disagreements and that disagreement is where,</p>
<p>so it was a balance between certainty and forced humility because the power was distributed.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think that the nature of debate and disagreement argument takes as a premise,</p>
<p>the idea that you could be wrong, which means that you&rsquo;re not necessarily absolutely convinced</p>
<p>that your objective is the correct one. If you were absolutely convinced, there&rsquo;d be no point</p>
<p>in having any discussion or argument because you would never change your mind and there wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be any sort of synthesis or anything like that. I think you can think of argumentation as an</p>
<p>implementation of a form of uncertain reasoning. I&rsquo;ve been reading recently about utilitarianism</p>
<p>and the history of efforts to define in a sort of clear mathematical way,</p>
<p>if you like a formula for moral or political decision making. It&rsquo;s really interesting that</p>
<p>the parallels between the philosophical discussions going back 200 years and what you see now in</p>
<p>discussions about existential risk because it&rsquo;s almost exactly the same. Someone would say,</p>
<p>okay, well here&rsquo;s a formula for how we should make decisions. Utilitarianism is roughly each</p>
<p>person has a utility function and then we make decisions to maximize the sum of everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>utility. Then people point out, well, in that case, the best policy is one that leads to</p>
<p>the enormously vast population, all of whom are living a life that&rsquo;s barely worth living.</p>
<p>This is called the repugnant conclusion. Another version is that we should maximize</p>
<p>pleasure and that&rsquo;s what we mean by utility. Then you&rsquo;ll get people effectively saying, well,</p>
<p>in that case, we might as well just have everyone hooked up to a heroin drip. They didn&rsquo;t use those</p>
<p>words, but that debate was happening in the 19th century as it is now about AI that if we get the</p>
<p>formula wrong, we&rsquo;re going to have AI systems working towards an outcome that in retrospect</p>
<p>would be exactly wrong. Do you think there&rsquo;s, as beautifully put, so the echoes are there,</p>
<p>but do you think, I mean, if you look at Sam Harris, our imagination worries about the AI</p>
<p>version of that because of the speed at which the things going wrong in the utilitarian context</p>
<p>could happen. Is that a worry for you? Yeah. I think that in most cases, not in all, but if we</p>
<p>have a wrong political idea, we see it starting to go wrong and we&rsquo;re not completely stupid and so</p>
<p>we say, okay, maybe that was a mistake. Let&rsquo;s try something different. Also, we&rsquo;re very slow and</p>
<p>inefficient about implementing these things and so on. So you have to worry when you have</p>
<p>corporations or political systems that are extremely efficient. But when we look at AI systems</p>
<p>or even just computers in general, they have this different characteristic from ordinary</p>
<p>human activity in the past. So let&rsquo;s say you were a surgeon, you had some idea about how to do some</p>
<p>operation. Well, and let&rsquo;s say you were wrong, that way of doing the operation would mostly</p>
<p>kill the patient. Well, you&rsquo;d find out pretty quickly, like after three, maybe three or four</p>
<p>tries. But that isn&rsquo;t true for pharmaceutical companies because they don&rsquo;t do three or four</p>
<p>operations. They manufacture three or four billion pills and they sell them and then they find out</p>
<p>maybe six months or a year later that, oh, people are dying of heart attacks or getting cancer from</p>
<p>this drug. And so that&rsquo;s why we have the FDA, right? Because of the scalability of pharmaceutical</p>
<p>production. And there have been some unbelievably bad episodes in the history of pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>and adulteration of products and so on that have killed tens of thousands or paralyzed hundreds</p>
<p>of thousands of people. Now with computers, we have that same scalability problem that you can</p>
<p>sit there and type for I equals one to five billion do, right? And all of a sudden you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having an impact on a global scale. And yet we have no FDA, right? There&rsquo;s absolutely no controls</p>
<p>at all over what a bunch of undergraduates with too much caffeine can do to the world.</p>
<p>And we look at what happened with Facebook, well, social media in general and click through</p>
<p>optimization. So you have a simple feedback algorithm that&rsquo;s trying to just optimize click</p>
<p>through, right? That sounds reasonable, right? Because you don&rsquo;t want to be feeding people ads</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t care about or not interested in. And you might even think of that process as</p>
<p>simply adjusting the feeding of ads or news articles or whatever it might be</p>
<p>to match people&rsquo;s preferences, right? Which sounds like a good idea.</p>
<p>But in fact, that isn&rsquo;t how the algorithm works, right? You make more money,</p>
<p>the algorithm makes more money if it can better predict what people are going to click on,</p>
<p>because then it can feed them exactly that, right? So the way to maximize click through</p>
<p>is actually to modify the people to make them more predictable. And one way to do that is to</p>
<p>feed them information, which will change their behavior and preferences towards extremes that</p>
<p>make them predictable. Whatever is the nearest extreme or the nearest predictable point,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going to end up. And the machines will force you there.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a reasonable argument to say that this, among other things,</p>
<p>is contributing to the destruction of democracy in the world.</p>
<p>And where was the oversight of this process? Where were the people saying, okay,</p>
<p>you would like to apply this algorithm to 5 billion people on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Can you show me that it&rsquo;s safe? Can you show me that it won&rsquo;t have various kinds of negative</p>
<p>effects? No, there was no one asking that question. There was no one placed between</p>
<p>the undergrads with too much caffeine and the human race. They just did it.</p>
<p>But some way outside the scope of my knowledge, so economists would argue that the, what is it,</p>
<p>the invisible hand, so the capitalist system, it was the oversight. So if you&rsquo;re going to corrupt</p>
<p>society with whatever decision you make as a company, then that&rsquo;s going to be reflected in</p>
<p>people not using your product. That&rsquo;s one model of oversight.</p>
<p>We shall see, but in the meantime, but you might even have broken the political system</p>
<p>that enables capitalism to function. Well, you&rsquo;ve changed it.</p>
<p>We shall see.</p>
<p>Change is often painful. So my question is absolutely, it&rsquo;s fascinating. You&rsquo;re absolutely</p>
<p>right that there was zero oversight on algorithms that can have a profound civilization changing</p>
<p>effect. So do you think it&rsquo;s possible? I mean, I haven&rsquo;t, have you seen government? So do you</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s possible to create regulatory bodies oversight over AI algorithms, which are inherently</p>
<p>such cutting edge set of ideas and technologies?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think it takes time to figure out what kind of oversight, what kinds of controls.</p>
<p>I mean, it took time to design the FDA regime, you know, and some people still don&rsquo;t like it and</p>
<p>they want to fix it. And I think there are clear ways that it could be improved.</p>
<p>But the whole notion that you have stage one, stage two, stage three, and here are the criteria</p>
<p>for what you have to do to pass a stage one trial, right? We haven&rsquo;t even thought about what those</p>
<p>would be for algorithms. So, I mean, I think there are things we could do right now with regard to</p>
<p>bias, for example, we have a pretty good technical handle on how to detect algorithms that are</p>
<p>propagating bias that exists in data sets, how to de bias those algorithms, and even what it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to cost you to do that. So I think we could start having some standards on that. I think there are</p>
<p>things to do with impersonation and falsification that we could work on.</p>
<p>Fakes, yeah.</p>
<p>A very simple point. So impersonation is a machine acting as if it was a person.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see a real justification for why we shouldn&rsquo;t insist that machines self identify</p>
<p>as machines. Where is the social benefit in fooling people into thinking that this is really</p>
<p>a person when it isn&rsquo;t? I don&rsquo;t mind if it uses a human like voice, that&rsquo;s easy to understand,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine, but it should just say, I&rsquo;m a machine in some form.</p>
<p>And how many people are speaking to that? I would think relatively obvious facts.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there is actually a law in California that bans impersonation, but only in certain</p>
<p>restricted circumstances. So for the purpose of engaging in a fraudulent transaction and for the</p>
<p>purpose of modifying someone&rsquo;s voting behavior. So those are the circumstances where machines have</p>
<p>to self identify. But I think arguably, it should be in all circumstances. And</p>
<p>then when you talk about deep fakes, we&rsquo;re just at the beginning, but already it&rsquo;s possible to</p>
<p>make a movie of anybody saying anything in ways that are pretty hard to detect.</p>
<p>Including yourself because you&rsquo;re on camera now and your voice is coming through with high</p>
<p>resolution.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you could take what I&rsquo;m saying and replace it with pretty much anything else you</p>
<p>wanted me to be saying. And it&rsquo;s a very simple thing.</p>
<p>Take what I&rsquo;m saying and replace it with pretty much anything else you wanted me to be saying. And</p>
<p>even it would change my lips and facial expressions to fit. And there&rsquo;s actually not much</p>
<p>in the way of real legal protection against that. I think in the commercial area, you could say,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;re using my brand and so on. There are rules about that. But in the political sphere,</p>
<p>I think at the moment, anything goes. That could be really, really damaging.</p>
<p>And let me just try to make not an argument, but try to look back at history and say something dark</p>
<p>in essence is while regulation seems to be, oversight seems to be exactly the right thing to</p>
<p>do here. It seems that human beings, what they naturally do is they wait for something to go</p>
<p>wrong. If you&rsquo;re talking about nuclear weapons, you can&rsquo;t talk about nuclear weapons being dangerous</p>
<p>until somebody actually like the United States drops the bomb or Chernobyl melting. Do you think</p>
<p>we will have to wait for things going wrong in a way that&rsquo;s obviously damaging to society,</p>
<p>not an existential risk, but obviously damaging? Or do you have faith that&hellip;</p>
<p>I hope not, but I think we do have to look at history.</p>
<p>And so the two examples you gave, nuclear weapons and nuclear power are very, very interesting</p>
<p>because nuclear weapons, we knew in the early years of the 20th century that atoms contained</p>
<p>a huge amount of energy. We had E equals MC squared. We knew the mass differences between</p>
<p>the different atoms and their components. And we knew that</p>
<p>you might be able to make an incredibly powerful explosive. So HG Wells wrote science fiction book,</p>
<p>I think in 1912. Frederick Soddy, who was the guy who discovered isotopes, the Nobel prize winner,</p>
<p>he gave a speech in 1915 saying that one pound of this new explosive would be the equivalent</p>
<p>of 150 tons of dynamite, which turns out to be about right. And this was in World War I,</p>
<p>so he was imagining how much worse the world war would be if we were using that kind of explosive.</p>
<p>But the physics establishment simply refused to believe that these things could be made.</p>
<p>Including the people who are making it.</p>
<p>Well, so they were doing the nuclear physics. I mean, eventually were the ones who made it.</p>
<p>You talk about Fermi or whoever.</p>
<p>Well, so up to the development was mostly theoretical. So it was people using sort of</p>
<p>primitive kinds of particle acceleration and doing experiments at the level of single particles</p>
<p>or collections of particles. They weren&rsquo;t yet thinking about how to actually make a bomb or</p>
<p>anything like that. But they knew the energy was there and they figured if they understood it</p>
<p>better, it might be possible. But the physics establishment, their view, and I think because</p>
<p>they did not want it to be true, their view was that it could not be true. That this could not</p>
<p>not provide a way to make a super weapon. And there was this famous speech given by Rutherford,</p>
<p>who was the sort of leader of nuclear physics. And it was on September 11th, 1933. And he said,</p>
<p>anyone who talks about the possibility of obtaining energy from transformation of atoms</p>
<p>is talking complete moonshine. And the next morning, Leo Szilard read about that speech</p>
<p>and then invented the nuclear chain reaction. And so as soon as he invented, as soon as he had that</p>
<p>idea that you could make a chain reaction with neutrons, because neutrons were not repelled by</p>
<p>the nucleus, so they could enter the nucleus and then continue the reaction. As soon as he has that</p>
<p>idea, he instantly realized that the world was in deep doo doo. Because this is 1933, right? Hitler</p>
<p>had recently come to power in Germany. Szilard was in London and eventually became a refugee</p>
<p>and came to the US. And in the process of having the idea about the chain reaction,</p>
<p>he figured out basically how to make a bomb and also how to make a reactor. And he patented the</p>
<p>reactor in 1934. But because of the situation, the great power conflict situation that he could see</p>
<p>happening, he kept that a secret. And so between then and the beginning of World War II, people</p>
<p>were working, including the Germans, on how to actually create neutron sources, what specific</p>
<p>fission reactions would produce neutrons of the right energy to continue the reaction.</p>
<p>And that was demonstrated in Germany, I think in 1938, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>The first nuclear weapon patent was 1939 by the French. So this was actually going on well before</p>
<p>World War II really got going. And then the British probably had the most advanced capability</p>
<p>in this area. But for safety reasons, among others, and just resources, they moved the program</p>
<p>from Britain to the US and then that became Manhattan Project. So the reason why we couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any kind of oversight of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology</p>
<p>was because we were basically already in an arms race and a war.</p>
<p>LR But you mentioned then in the 20s and 30s. So what are the echoes? The way you&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>this story, I mean, there&rsquo;s clearly echoes. Why do you think most AI researchers,</p>
<p>folks who are really close to the metal, they really are not concerned about AI. They don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about it, whether it&rsquo;s they don&rsquo;t want to think about it. But why do you think that is,</p>
<p>is what are the echoes of the nuclear situation to the current AI situation? And what can we do</p>
<p>about it? BF I think there is a kind of motivated cognition, which is a term in psychology means</p>
<p>that you believe what you would like to be true, rather than what is true. And it&rsquo;s unsettling</p>
<p>to think that what you&rsquo;re working on might be the end of the human race, obviously. So you would</p>
<p>rather instantly deny it and come up with some reason why it couldn&rsquo;t be true. And I have,</p>
<p>I collected a long list of reasons that extremely intelligent, competent AI scientists have come up</p>
<p>with for why we shouldn&rsquo;t worry about this. For example, calculators are superhuman at arithmetic</p>
<p>and they haven&rsquo;t taken over the world. So there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about. Well, okay, my five year</p>
<p>old, you know, could have figured out why that was an unreasonable and really quite weak argument.</p>
<p>Another one was, while it&rsquo;s theoretically possible that you could have superhuman AI destroy the</p>
<p>world, it&rsquo;s also theoretically possible that a black hole could materialize right next to the</p>
<p>earth and destroy humanity. I mean, yes, it&rsquo;s theoretically possible, quantum theoretically,</p>
<p>extremely unlikely that it would just materialize right there. But that&rsquo;s a completely bogus analogy,</p>
<p>because, you know, if the whole physics community on earth was working to materialize a black hole</p>
<p>in near earth orbit, right? Wouldn&rsquo;t you ask them, is that a good idea? Is that going to be safe?</p>
<p>You know, what if you succeed? Right. And that&rsquo;s the thing, right? The AI community is sort of</p>
<p>refused to ask itself, what if you succeed? And initially I think that was because it was too hard,</p>
<p>but, you know, Alan Turing asked himself that, and he said, we&rsquo;d be toast, right? If we were lucky,</p>
<p>we might be able to switch off the power, but probably we&rsquo;d be toast. But there&rsquo;s also an aspect</p>
<p>that because we&rsquo;re not exactly sure what the future holds, it&rsquo;s not clear exactly,</p>
<p>so technically what to worry about, sort of how things go wrong. And so there is something,</p>
<p>it feels like, maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but there&rsquo;s something paralyzing about</p>
<p>worrying about something that logically is inevitable, but you have to think about it,</p>
<p>logically is inevitable, but you don&rsquo;t really know what that will look like.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a reasonable point and, you know, it&rsquo;s certainly in terms of</p>
<p>existential risks, it&rsquo;s different from, you know, asteroid collides with the earth, right? Which,</p>
<p>again, is quite possible, you know, it&rsquo;s happened in the past, it&rsquo;ll probably happen again,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know right now, but if we did detect an asteroid that was going to hit the earth</p>
<p>in 75 years time, we&rsquo;d certainly be doing something about it.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s got big rock and there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll probably have a meeting and see what do we do about the big rock with AI.</p>
<p>Right, with AI, I mean, there are very few people who think it&rsquo;s not going to happen within the</p>
<p>next 75 years. I know Rod Brooks doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to happen, maybe Andrew Ng doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s happened, but, you know, a lot of the people who work day to day, you know, as you say,</p>
<p>at the rock face, they think it&rsquo;s going to happen. I think the median estimate from AI researchers is</p>
<p>somewhere in 40 to 50 years from now, or maybe, you know, I think in Asia, they think it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be even faster than that. I&rsquo;m a little bit more conservative, I think it&rsquo;d probably take</p>
<p>longer than that, but I think, you know, as happened with nuclear weapons, it can happen</p>
<p>overnight that you have these breakthroughs and we need more than one breakthrough, but,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s on the order of half a dozen, I mean, this is a very rough scale, but sort of</p>
<p>half a dozen breakthroughs of that nature would have to happen for us to reach the superhuman AI.</p>
<p>But the, you know, the AI research community is vast now, the massive investments from governments,</p>
<p>from corporations, tons of really, really smart people, you know, you just have to look at the</p>
<p>rate of progress in different areas of AI to see that things are moving pretty fast. So to say,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s just going to be thousands of years, I don&rsquo;t see any basis for that. You know, I see,</p>
<p>you know, for example, the Stanford 100 year AI project, right, which is supposed to be sort of,</p>
<p>you know, the serious establishment view, their most recent report actually said it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>not even possible. Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Right. Which if you want a perfect example of people in denial, that&rsquo;s it. Because, you know,</p>
<p>for the whole history of AI, we&rsquo;ve been saying to philosophers who said it wasn&rsquo;t possible,</p>
<p>well, you have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. Of course it&rsquo;s possible, right? Give me an argument</p>
<p>for why it couldn&rsquo;t happen. And there isn&rsquo;t one, right? And now, because people are worried that</p>
<p>maybe AI might get a bad name, or I just don&rsquo;t want to think about this, they&rsquo;re saying, okay,</p>
<p>well, of course, it&rsquo;s not really possible. You know, imagine if, you know, the leaders of the</p>
<p>cancer biology community got up and said, well, you know, of course, curing cancer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really possible. There&rsquo;d be complete outrage and dismay. And, you know, I find this</p>
<p>really a strange phenomenon. So, okay, so if you accept that it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>and if you accept that it&rsquo;s probably going to happen, the point that you&rsquo;re making that,</p>
<p>you know, how does it go wrong? A valid question. Without that, without an answer to that question,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re stuck with what I call the gorilla problem, which is, you know, the problem that</p>
<p>the gorillas face, right? They made something more intelligent than them, namely us, a few million</p>
<p>years ago, and now they&rsquo;re in deep doo doo. So there&rsquo;s really nothing they can do. They&rsquo;ve lost</p>
<p>the control. They failed to solve the control problem of controlling humans, and so they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>lost. So we don&rsquo;t want to be in that situation. And if the gorilla problem is the only formulation</p>
<p>you have, there&rsquo;s not a lot you can do, right? Other than to say, okay, we should try to stop,</p>
<p>you know, we should just not make the humans, or in this case, not make the AI. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really hard to do. I&rsquo;m not actually proposing that that&rsquo;s a feasible course of</p>
<p>action. I also think that, you know, if properly controlled AI could be incredibly beneficial.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that there&rsquo;s a consensus that one of the major failure modes is this</p>
<p>loss of control, that we create AI systems that are pursuing incorrect objectives. And because</p>
<p>the AI system believes it knows what the objective is, it has no incentive to listen to us anymore,</p>
<p>so to speak, right? It&rsquo;s just carrying out the strategy that it has computed as being the optimal</p>
<p>solution. And, you know, it may be that in the process, it needs to acquire more resources to</p>
<p>increase the possibility of success or prevent various failure modes by defending itself against</p>
<p>interference. And so that collection of problems, I think, is something we can address. The other</p>
<p>problems are, roughly speaking, you know, misuse, right? So even if we solve the control problem,</p>
<p>we make perfectly safe controllable AI systems. Well, why? You know, why does Dr. Evil going to</p>
<p>use those, right? He wants to just take over the world and he&rsquo;ll make unsafe AI systems that then</p>
<p>get out of control. So that&rsquo;s one problem, which is sort of a, you know, partly a policing problem,</p>
<p>partly a sort of a cultural problem for the profession of how we teach people what kinds</p>
<p>of AI systems are safe. You talk about autonomous weapon system and how pretty much everybody</p>
<p>agrees that there&rsquo;s too many ways that that can go horribly wrong. This great slaughterbots movie</p>
<p>that kind of illustrates that beautifully. I want to talk about that. That&rsquo;s another,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another topic I&rsquo;m having to talk about. I just want to mention that what I see is the</p>
<p>third major failure mode, which is overuse, not so much misuse, but overuse of AI that we become</p>
<p>overly dependent. So I call this the WALL E problem. So if you&rsquo;ve seen WALL E, the movie,</p>
<p>all right, all the humans are on the spaceship and the machines look after everything for them,</p>
<p>and they just watch TV and drink big gulps. And they&rsquo;re all sort of obese and stupid and they</p>
<p>sort of totally lost any notion of human autonomy. And, you know, so in effect, right. This would</p>
<p>happen like the slow boiling frog, right? We would gradually turn over more and more of the</p>
<p>management of our civilization to machines as we are already doing. And this, you know, if this</p>
<p>if this process continues, you know, we sort of gradually switch from sort of being the masters</p>
<p>of technology to just being the guests. Right. So we become guests on a cruise ship, you know,</p>
<p>which is fine for a week, but not not for the rest of eternity. You know, and it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>irreversible. Right. Once you once you lose the incentive to, for example, you know, learn to be</p>
<p>an engineer or a doctor or a sanitation operative or any other of the infinitely many ways that we</p>
<p>maintain and propagate our civilization. You know, if you if you don&rsquo;t have the incentive to do any</p>
<p>of that, you won&rsquo;t. And then it&rsquo;s really hard to recover. And of course, as just one of the</p>
<p>technologies that could that third failure mode result in that there&rsquo;s probably other</p>
<p>technology in general detaches us from it does a bit. But the difference is that in terms of</p>
<p>the knowledge to to run our civilization, you know, up to now, we&rsquo;ve had no alternative but</p>
<p>to put it into people&rsquo;s heads. Right. And if you software with Google, I mean, so software in</p>
<p>general, so computers in general, but but the, you know, the knowledge of how, you know, how a</p>
<p>sanitation system works, you know, that&rsquo;s an AI has to understand that it&rsquo;s no good putting it</p>
<p>into Google. So, I mean, we we&rsquo;ve always put knowledge in on paper, but paper doesn&rsquo;t run our</p>
<p>civilization and only runs when it goes from the paper into people&rsquo;s heads again. Right. So we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>always propagated civilization through human minds. And we&rsquo;ve spent about a trillion person</p>
<p>years doing that. I literally write you, you can work it out. It&rsquo;s about right. There&rsquo;s about just</p>
<p>over 100 billion people who&rsquo;ve ever lived. And each of them has spent about 10 years learning</p>
<p>stuff to keep their civilization going. And so that&rsquo;s a trillion person years we put into this</p>
<p>effort. Beautiful way to describe all civilization. And now we&rsquo;re, you know, we&rsquo;re in danger of</p>
<p>throwing that away. So this is a problem that AI can&rsquo;t solve. It&rsquo;s not a technical problem. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know, if we do our job right, the AI systems will say, you know, the human race doesn&rsquo;t in the</p>
<p>long run want to be passengers in a cruise ship. The human race wants autonomy. This is part of</p>
<p>human preferences. So we, the AI systems are not going to do this stuff for you. You&rsquo;ve got to do</p>
<p>it for yourself. Right. I&rsquo;m not going to carry you to the top of Everest in an autonomous</p>
<p>helicopter. You have to climb it if you want to get the benefit and so on. So, but I&rsquo;m afraid that</p>
<p>because we are short sighted and lazy, we&rsquo;re going to override the AI systems. And, and there&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>amazing short story that I recommend to everyone that I talked to about this called The Machine</p>
<p>Stops, written in 1909 by E.M. Forster, who, you know, wrote novels about the British Empire and</p>
<p>sort of things that became costume dramas on the BBC. But he wrote this one science fiction story,</p>
<p>which is an amazing vision of the future. It has basically iPads, it has video conferencing,</p>
<p>it has MOOCs, it has computer induced obesity. I mean, literally it&rsquo;s what people spend their</p>
<p>time doing is giving online courses or listening to online courses and talking about ideas,</p>
<p>but they never get out there in the real world. They don&rsquo;t really have a lot of face to face</p>
<p>contact. Everything is done online, you know, so all the things we&rsquo;re worrying about now</p>
<p>were described in the story. And, and then the human race becomes more and more dependent on</p>
<p>the machine, loses knowledge of how things really run and then becomes vulnerable to collapse. And</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a pretty unbelievably amazing story for someone writing in 1909 to imagine all</p>
<p>this. So there&rsquo;s very few people that represent artificial intelligence more than you Stuart</p>
<p>Russell. If you say it&rsquo;s okay, that&rsquo;s very kind. So it&rsquo;s all my fault. Right. You&rsquo;re often brought</p>
<p>up as the person, well, Stuart Russell, like the AI person is worried about this. That&rsquo;s why you</p>
<p>should be worried about it. Do you feel the burden of that? I don&rsquo;t know if you feel that at all,</p>
<p>but when I talk to people like from, you talk about people outside of computer science,</p>
<p>when they think about this, Stuart Russell is worried about AI safety. You should be worried</p>
<p>too. Do you feel the burden of that? I mean, in a practical sense, yeah, because I get, you know,</p>
<p>a dozen, sometimes 25 invitations a day to talk about it, to give interviews, to write press</p>
<p>articles and so on. So in that very practical sense, I&rsquo;m seeing that people are concerned and</p>
<p>really interested about this. Are you worried that you could be wrong as all good scientists are?</p>
<p>Of course. I worry about that all the time. I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s always been the way that I,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked, you know, is like I have an argument in my head with myself, right? So I have,</p>
<p>I have some idea and then I think, okay, how could that be wrong? Or did someone else already have</p>
<p>that idea? So I&rsquo;ll go and, you know, search in as much literature as I can to see whether someone</p>
<p>else already thought of that or, or even refuted it. So, you know, I, right now I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m reading a</p>
<p>lot of philosophy because, you know, in, in the form of the debates over, over utilitarianism and,</p>
<p>and other kinds of moral, moral formulas, shall we say, people have already thought through</p>
<p>some of these issues. But, you know, what, one of the things I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not seeing in a lot of</p>
<p>these debates is this specific idea about the importance of uncertainty in the objective</p>
<p>that this is the way we should think about machines that are beneficial to humans. So this</p>
<p>idea of provably beneficial machines based on explicit uncertainty in the objective,</p>
<p>you know, it seems to be, you know, my gut feeling is this is the core of it. It&rsquo;s going to have to</p>
<p>be elaborated in a lot of different directions and there are a lot of beneficial. Yeah. But there,</p>
<p>there are, I mean, it has to be right. We can&rsquo;t afford, you know, hand wavy beneficial because</p>
<p>there are, you know, whenever we do hand wavy stuff, there are loopholes. And the thing about</p>
<p>super intelligent machines is they find the loopholes, you know, just like, you know, tax</p>
<p>evaders. If you don&rsquo;t write your tax law properly, people will find the loopholes and end up paying</p>
<p>no tax. And, and so you should think of it this way and, and getting those definitions right,</p>
<p>you know, it is really a long process, you know, so you can, you can define mathematical frameworks</p>
<p>and within that framework, you can prove mathematical theorems that yes, this will,</p>
<p>you know, this, this theoretical entity will be provably beneficial to that theoretical entity,</p>
<p>but that framework may not match the real world in some crucial way. So it&rsquo;s a long process,</p>
<p>thinking through it, iterating and so on. Last question. Yep. You have 10 seconds to answer it.</p>
<p>What is your favorite sci fi movie about AI? I would say interstellar has my favorite robots.</p>
<p>Oh, beats space. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, so Tars, the robots, one of the robots in interstellar is</p>
<p>the way robot should behave. And, uh, I would say ex machina is in some ways, the one,</p>
<p>the one that makes you think, uh, in a nervous kind of way about, about where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>Well Stuart, thank you so much for talking today. Pleasure.</p>
