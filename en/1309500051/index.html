    <p>hi friends how are you</p>
<p>today I hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re not having a wonderful day don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna get better</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rooting for real</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Syrian</p>
<p>and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s Murder Mystery</p>
<p>and Makeup Monday</p>
<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>hello how are you my name is Bailey Sarian</p>
<p>and on Mondays I sit down and I talk about a true</p>
<p>crime story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>not again and I do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true Crime and you like makeup</p>
<p>I would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m here for you on Mondays</p>
<p>but other than that I will stop yip yapping</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s talk about Louise</p>
<p>okay Louise</p>
<p>she was born September 30th 1880</p>
<p>but the crazy ones were in like the 1800s</p>
<p>early 1900s</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it was</p>
<p>something was in the water she was born in a</p>
<p>bennville Louisiana did I say that</p>
<p>right I probably did not bennville</p>
<p>Louisiana okay and her father was super wealthy oh yes</p>
<p>very wealthy man</p>
<p>he ran a newspaper company</p>
<p>and honestly it was very</p>
<p>clear to Louise</p>
<p>that she came from a very privileged life</p>
<p>at the age of 15 she</p>
<p>would go on to attend a private school</p>
<p>in New Orleans</p>
<p>New Orleans do you remember</p>
<p>a couple videos ago I said New Orleans I got</p>
<p>roasted in the comments</p>
<p>I get it so she goes to a private</p>
<p>school New Orleans um but she</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t last there too long because she was expelled</p>
<p>she got caught</p>
<p>stealing from her classmates</p>
<p>and then the</p>
<p>final nail in the coffin</p>
<p>was when she was caught engaging in some</p>
<p>sexual behavior with other boys in the</p>
<p>school you know so she got</p>
<p>kicked the heck out there&rsquo;s really not much information</p>
<p>about her upbringing like I was trying to figure out</p>
<p>where her mom was at and stuff and</p>
<p>again cause it&rsquo;s such an old story it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the look so some of the details are missing but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still a very interesting one</p>
<p>so she grows up very privileged family wealthy great</p>
<p>and then in 1903</p>
<p>Louise she marries her husband her first husband</p>
<p>his name is Henry Bosley</p>
<p>and he worked as a</p>
<p>traveling salesman</p>
<p>Louise seemed to like the fact that</p>
<p>Henry was away all the time you know</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>traveling salesman so he&rsquo;s like not home</p>
<p>and Louis like that</p>
<p>because while</p>
<p>he was away</p>
<p>Louise did indeed play if you know what I mean</p>
<p>she was having many affairs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not very nice Louise</p>
<p>anyways so after 4 years of marriage</p>
<p>Henry comes home one day from working</p>
<p>comes home early</p>
<p>he opens up the door and what does he find</p>
<p>Louise is inside with another man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s absolutely devastated</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s heartbroken</p>
<p>over this and because he walked in on Louise</p>
<p>the love of his life</p>
<p>cheating on him he</p>
<p>was he fell into like a really deep depression okay</p>
<p>and then soon</p>
<p>after he ended up committing suicide</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s rough in the</p>
<p>first 5 minutes I know</p>
<p>after her husband&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death Louise decides to move to</p>
<p>Shrevenport Louisiana</p>
<p>another part of Louisiana</p>
<p>so she moves</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s in need of a job</p>
<p>right she&rsquo;s got bills to pay</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s new in town</p>
<p>great so she</p>
<p>starts looking around for a job</p>
<p>and Louise figured the easiest job for her</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is</p>
<p>an easy job it she felt like it was an easy job for her</p>
<p>was to become like a high</p>
<p>class sex worker</p>
<p>but she could</p>
<p>make even more</p>
<p>money extra</p>
<p>money on top of that by simply</p>
<p>stealing some</p>
<p>money from her clients when they</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t looking so</p>
<p>she would you know when</p>
<p>they were like doing something else she was</p>
<p>sneaking off and like taking some</p>
<p>money from them</p>
<p>and Louise she pulled</p>
<p>these tricks for</p>
<p>about 2 years but decided she was over it</p>
<p>and then in 1911</p>
<p>Louise moved to Boston</p>
<p>where she wanted to</p>
<p>change her name for some reason she needed to rebrand</p>
<p>and she changed her name to Louise</p>
<p>M gold Louise when she&rsquo;s in Boston she gets a new scam</p>
<p>going and she</p>
<p>starts telling people that she&rsquo;s a 19 year old</p>
<p>heiress from</p>
<p>Dallas Texas</p>
<p>who has been confined to a convent</p>
<p>by her family</p>
<p>and she had run away she had escaped</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s no Internet back then or anything</p>
<p>right so it&rsquo;s like yeah sure you are</p>
<p>whoa you know</p>
<p>I know we don&rsquo;t know too much</p>
<p>about her upbringing but</p>
<p>we know that wasn&rsquo;t true it was fake</p>
<p>that was a lie</p>
<p>Louise is kind of</p>
<p>spinning this web of lies</p>
<p>while mixing and mingling</p>
<p>with the wealthier families of Boston</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s said that Louise was a very beautiful</p>
<p>woman and she was very charming</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not long before she manages to convince one of</p>
<p>these wealthy families to take her in like almost adult</p>
<p>adopting her</p>
<p>very bizarre but okay</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also not long before Louise is up to her old</p>
<p>tricks again okay</p>
<p>she decided she was</p>
<p>gonna start to scam the family she</p>
<p>would run up</p>
<p>large bills at some of the most</p>
<p>expensive stores in Boston</p>
<p>and she was also</p>
<p>stealing money</p>
<p>not only from the family she was staying with but also</p>
<p>their friends</p>
<p>and their employees</p>
<p>this is like the olden days</p>
<p>where you could be like put it on the card</p>
<p>put it on the Johnson</p>
<p>account you know and it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>could just pay</p>
<p>later or something no one</p>
<p>would let you</p>
<p>do that now but this at this time that was a</p>
<p>thing so she was doing that like put it on the tub</p>
<p>yeah she was</p>
<p>she was running up a big Bill</p>
<p>not having to pay anything now it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>clear how but</p>
<p>someone catches on to her lies and</p>
<p>like what she&rsquo;s really been up to</p>
<p>okay so they</p>
<p>tell the family that she&rsquo;s been staying with hey</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s lying to you</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t come from a wealthy family</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s been stealing money</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s been running up a Bill</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming it was something like that you know well</p>
<p>again this is</p>
<p>the olden days 1911 at the</p>
<p>time and the wealthy family she was staying with was</p>
<p>super embarrassed</p>
<p>that they were duped in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>their first thought was if anybody finds out</p>
<p>they would suffer</p>
<p>greatly from public embarrassment</p>
<p>okay and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the most important</p>
<p>thing public</p>
<p>embarrassment so they don&rsquo;t want that okay</p>
<p>so the families</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna press charges</p>
<p>but they tell Louise</p>
<p>if you go away</p>
<p>okay if you promise to</p>
<p>leave town we won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>press any charges</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>promise I mean what a deal</p>
<p>no lessons to be</p>
<p>learned there</p>
<p>sounds great so Louise</p>
<p>goes to Waco</p>
<p>Texas where</p>
<p>she meets right away a wealthy oil boss</p>
<p>named Joe Apple</p>
<p>now Joe loves</p>
<p>diamonds oh yes</p>
<p>he has diamonds on</p>
<p>everything rings belt buckles even the buttons on his</p>
<p>shirt had diamonds on them</p>
<p>and he loved</p>
<p>to flaunt his wealth to the peasants with</p>
<p>their basic belts and</p>
<p>shirts you know</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s just a douche</p>
<p>a rich douche</p>
<p>well Louise</p>
<p>sees the diamonds and she&rsquo;s like hell yeah sign me up</p>
<p>she goes straight to him</p>
<p>b line for that guy and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>her deal is but she&rsquo;s able to get a man very easily and</p>
<p>things between Joe and Louise they get pretty hot and</p>
<p>heavy pretty damn</p>
<p>quickly okay</p>
<p>um but the relationship itself is pretty</p>
<p>short lived</p>
<p>one week after they met</p>
<p>Joe was found</p>
<p>dead his cause of death</p>
<p>he was shot</p>
<p>but not only that</p>
<p>all of his diamond jewelry was missing</p>
<p>now many had seen Joe and Louise together so naturally</p>
<p>Louise was arrested</p>
<p>she was arrested for the crime</p>
<p>and she went all the way to</p>
<p>trial for the</p>
<p>crime because</p>
<p>it was believed she was the murderer but</p>
<p>again people just really seemed</p>
<p>to enjoy just like Louise I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>freaking know man she sat on the</p>
<p>stand and told the jury that Joe had</p>
<p>tried to rape her</p>
<p>so she killed him in</p>
<p>self defense</p>
<p>she had no diamonds in her</p>
<p>possession so</p>
<p>the jury they side with her</p>
<p>self defense</p>
<p>and they find her not guilty</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s all fine</p>
<p>and dandy you know</p>
<p>because like that does happen and</p>
<p>self defense is important but as we go on in the story</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll such a question</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s true or not</p>
<p>you know so Louise to science that was a pretty</p>
<p>close call I mean she went all the way to</p>
<p>court she almost got</p>
<p>in trouble for murder</p>
<p>she needs to move</p>
<p>again and rebrand</p>
<p>herself because now people know her in town</p>
<p>as you know this questionable</p>
<p>woman so in 1913</p>
<p>she picks up and she moves again</p>
<p>this time she goes to</p>
<p>Dallas Texas</p>
<p>look I don&rsquo;t know how she did it but she did</p>
<p>she would find a rich guy on day one it was</p>
<p>literally weeks</p>
<p>after being there</p>
<p>she meets and</p>
<p>marries a man</p>
<p>also named Henry</p>
<p>no no no no his name is Harry</p>
<p>sorry his name is Harry</p>
<p>he works as a</p>
<p>night clerk</p>
<p>at a hotel called</p>
<p>Saint George</p>
<p>in the 19 thirties</p>
<p>Saint George</p>
<p>would get like a</p>
<p>$100,000 makeover it was a really big deal</p>
<p>and the hotel</p>
<p>would be renamed as Hotel</p>
<p>Whitmore one</p>
<p>night Harry is working his his</p>
<p>night shift at the hotel</p>
<p>when a robbery happened</p>
<p>there was 20 000</p>
<p>worth of jewels</p>
<p>stolen out of the hotel safe</p>
<p>he tells Louise like there&rsquo;s been a robbery like all</p>
<p>these these</p>
<p>jewels are missing</p>
<p>and Louise is like oh my God</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>you know and so he calls up the police</p>
<p>and police come and they interrogate Harry</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s eventually</p>
<p>cleared of any involvement with the missing jewelry</p>
<p>because he doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have them investigators then look into Louise</p>
<p>right because she&rsquo;s been hanging with Henry like</p>
<p>maybe something&rsquo;s up with her</p>
<p>so they look into her thinking</p>
<p>maybe she did it</p>
<p>but at the end</p>
<p>of the day there was 0 evidence linking her to the</p>
<p>crime and none of them had the</p>
<p>jewels in their</p>
<p>possession so</p>
<p>it couldn&rsquo;t have been them now</p>
<p>sadly even though they had both been</p>
<p>cleared by police</p>
<p>Harry allegedly</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t able to like</p>
<p>really move past the embarrassment of being accused of</p>
<p>stealing from the hotel</p>
<p>and it was said he fell into a major</p>
<p>deep depression</p>
<p>leading him to</p>
<p>commit suicide there&rsquo;s a lot of speculation that</p>
<p>Harry did not actually commit suicide</p>
<p>rumors were</p>
<p>going around that Luis</p>
<p>actually was the one who pulled the</p>
<p>trigger but again</p>
<p>there was no evidence to actually</p>
<p>prove that this was true so</p>
<p>it was just all speculation and</p>
<p>rumors but ain&rsquo;t that little fishy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 3 boyfriends who are dead hmm</p>
<p>do you ever feel overwhelmed</p>
<p>by the amount of choices there are out there</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shopping for cereal or toilet paper</p>
<p>there are just</p>
<p>so many options it&rsquo;s hard to know what&rsquo;s best for you</p>
<p>when it comes</p>
<p>to finding skin care products that actually work</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even more overwhelming</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with some new</p>
<p>breakouts so I went online to find a product that</p>

<p>adult acne but even a</p>
<p>quick Google</p>
<p>search brings up tons of products and</p>
<p>brands that all</p>
<p>claim to help</p>
<p>but like how are you supposed to know it actually works</p>
<p>ugh finding skincare</p>

<p>this episode</p>
<p>so now Louise is done with</p>
<p>Texas and she decides that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to move to Denver</p>
<p>Colorado in 1915</p>
<p>and this once a</p>
<p>freaking again</p>
<p>she meets and marries a salesman his name is Richard</p>
<p>Pete so they get married these 2 they get</p>
<p>married and they go on and they have a daughter</p>
<p>named Francis Ann</p>
<p>they call her Betty for short</p>
<p>and this happens about a year after they meet</p>
<p>so like clockwork Luis</p>
<p>she seems to struggle with</p>
<p>married life which leads to the couple</p>
<p>to be constantly fighting disagreeing about stuff</p>
<p>and then 4 years later in 1920</p>
<p>the 2 decide its best to separate</p>
<p>so they do Louise seems to only have</p>
<p>about a 4 year threshold of people and</p>
<p>places because she then leaves her husband</p>
<p>and daughter</p>
<p>and then she moves to Los Angeles California</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how she&rsquo;s doing it I really don&rsquo;t okay</p>
<p>great so she moves to Los Angeles wow</p>
<p>and guess what</p>
<p>you probably guessed</p>
<p>right she meets a guy</p>
<p>named Jacob</p>
<p>Denton who was like a recent widower</p>
<p>and he had a teenage daughter</p>
<p>leaving her own</p>
<p>daughter to be a mother to someone else&rsquo;s child</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to be louise&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cup of tea you know she&rsquo;s like damn it no</p>
<p>but it turns out</p>
<p>Jacob is also a mining engineer who made millions</p>
<p>before he retired</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give it a whirl</p>
<p>you know she&rsquo;s whatever</p>
<p>she just sees dollar signs</p>
<p>their meet Cute love</p>
<p>story starts when</p>
<p>Louise inquires</p>
<p>about a 14 room mansion</p>
<p>she is hoping to rent</p>
<p>and what she wants a 14 room mansion for</p>
<p>we may never know</p>
<p>but she does</p>
<p>and Jacob the guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s renting it and he&rsquo;s asking</p>
<p>$350 a month</p>
<p>to rent his 14 bedroom mansion</p>
<p>and Louise is able to</p>
<p>sweet talk him all the way down to</p>
<p>$75 a month</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>$350 a month for a 14 room</p>
<p>mansion in Los Angeles</p>
<p>a tragedy on its own what the hell cannot</p>
<p>even come close</p>
<p>to relating Louis</p>
<p>350 for our 14 room mansion</p>
<p>I know that was a lot to them back then but still</p>
<p>anyways so Louise</p>
<p>sweet talks</p>
<p>him she gets him down to $75</p>
<p>great Louise</p>
<p>moves in on May</p>
<p>26 and then</p>
<p>she and Jacob</p>
<p>start hooking up</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t long</p>
<p>until Louise</p>
<p>she proposes</p>
<p>marriage to Jacob but</p>
<p>he turns her down saying that he was</p>
<p>going out of town for a</p>
<p>month and like</p>
<p>I just wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna work out</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t in a</p>
<p>schedule and when Louise hears this she is</p>
<p>quite upset</p>
<p>I mean she always</p>
<p>gets her way I mean nobody has told her no</p>
<p>so far you know</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s just really unsure what to do with</p>
<p>these new emotions no</p>
<p>huh you know</p>
<p>so now during this time</p>
<p>rumors are circulating around town as to what role</p>
<p>Louis plays in</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>is she really</p>
<p>his living girlfriend</p>
<p>like Louise</p>
<p>claim she is</p>
<p>is she the housekeeper is she the tenant</p>
<p>she never signed to Lee so who is she</p>
<p>you know people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t just talking gossiping trying to figure out</p>
<p>who this lady was living in this big old mansion and</p>
<p>where she came from</p>
<p>well a couple days</p>
<p>after louise&rsquo;s proposal</p>
<p>Jacob just poof</p>
<p>vanishes disappears</p>
<p>gone now he was supposed to go out of town for a month</p>
<p>but no one can confirm if he did indeed actually go</p>
<p>so Louise tells</p>
<p>the neighbors</p>
<p>that oh yeah he went away for the</p>
<p>month yes yes I saw him off don&rsquo;t worry like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just gone for business calm down girl</p>
<p>and like don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about it</p>
<p>cause they were kind of asking like</p>
<p>where is he it&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>while and then sometime goes on things</p>
<p>carry on but you know people</p>
<p>deep down are having that</p>
<p>funny feeling that something&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>right with Louis hmm</p>
<p>so a few days</p>
<p>later Louis</p>
<p>hires a gardener to come out to the</p>
<p>house and spruce it up</p>
<p>spruce it up a bit you know</p>
<p>so she brings</p>
<p>a gardener in and she&rsquo;s like hey can you come into the</p>
<p>house and unload a</p>
<p>bunch of dirt into the basement of the house</p>
<p>now the gardener is like</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s a very odd request what exactly</p>
<p>is a dirt for</p>
<p>in the basement</p>
<p>you know and Louise tells him that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>planning on growing</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s favorite kind of mushrooms</p>
<p>down there as a surprise so when he comes home he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be like oh my God</p>
<p>mushrooms my</p>
<p>house just what I always wanted you know</p>
<p>super strange</p>
<p>but she has money</p>
<p>and these gardeners are here to work so it&rsquo;s like meh</p>
<p>sheriff will do it makes enough sense</p>
<p>so they load in a</p>
<p>bunch of dirt into the basement</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s gonna grow some mushrooms I guess</p>
<p>then on June 5th</p>
<p>Louise shows up to the</p>
<p>local bank with a</p>
<p>permission slip from</p>
<p>Jacob to withdraw</p>
<p>$300 from his bank account</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also giving her access to his</p>
<p>safety deposit box</p>
<p>now the bank teller notice that</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s signature</p>
<p>it looks a little suspicious</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t look so</p>
<p>right you know</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of like this is off let me say something so she</p>
<p>points it out to Louise</p>
<p>like you know the signature doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>girl it&rsquo;s fake you know</p>
<p>and Louise is</p>
<p>she just gives the teller some</p>
<p>crazy story</p>
<p>about how she</p>
<p>had to help</p>
<p>Jacob write his signature with his left hand because</p>
<p>his right arm had to be amputated</p>
<p>after he got an argument with the mysterious and very</p>
<p>angry quote</p>
<p>Spanish looking</p>
<p>woman who shot him</p>
<p>super believable</p>
<p>super believable</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like yeah that&rsquo;s what happened this is a real</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s even better</p>
<p>about this whole nonsense</p>
<p>and the teller</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know I guess she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>oh wow that must like that does happen I hear</p>
<p>and she gives</p>
<p>Louise access to the money and the safety deposit box</p>
<p>she gets away with everything</p>
<p>but Louise seems to be having a hard time keeping her</p>
<p>story straight</p>
<p>maybe she just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t give a</p>
<p>rat&rsquo;s ass I don&rsquo;t really know but she retells the story</p>
<p>again when she comes back to the bank at a later time</p>
<p>but this time saying that the</p>
<p>woman cut off his arm</p>
<p>and his leg but this time with a</p>
<p>sword very dramatic situation</p>
<p>she then said that</p>
<p>Jacob was so</p>
<p>embarrassed by his amputated arm not the leg though</p>
<p>but just the arm that he had locked himself up in the</p>
<p>house and will only</p>
<p>speak to her</p>
<p>and her only</p>
<p>so as the weeks go by</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s friends neighbors and business associates</p>
<p>they start worrying and they&rsquo;re questioning</p>
<p>Louis a bit they&rsquo;re pushing a little bit harder</p>
<p>like where&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Jacob we haven&rsquo;t seen him</p>
<p>meow meow meow and Louise</p>
<p>she just always had an answer she</p>
<p>would tell him like oh his business trip got extended</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be back soon like don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about him he&rsquo;s totally okay</p>
<p>depending on who was asking her</p>
<p>story would</p>
<p>change sometime he lost an arm sometimes he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it just whatever</p>
<p>you know she&rsquo;s free balling it I think I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>using that term correctly free balling it anyway well</p>
<p>Jacob was out of town</p>
<p>air quotes Louise</p>
<p>seemed to be</p>
<p>quite happy running the show she was</p>
<p>spending his money</p>
<p>driving his Cadillac</p>
<p>renting out the rooms in his mansion and just</p>
<p>in turn she was pocketing the rent</p>
<p>money smart</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give her that</p>
<p>she bought 2 very expensive</p>
<p>dresses at a</p>
<p>local high end department</p>
<p>store under</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>while claiming to be his wife</p>
<p>she also pawned a</p>
<p>bunch of his jewelry</p>
<p>and more valuable possessions</p>
<p>I mean she is doing the most</p>
<p>and she wasn&rsquo;t worried</p>
<p>about damn thing</p>
<p>she was like doing it so confidently and very openly</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>secret you know this girl&rsquo;s bold I</p>
<p>think cause she knows she</p>
<p>could just pick up and</p>
<p>leave again she&rsquo;s not worried</p>
<p>about it Louise</p>
<p>found out that</p>
<p>Jacob had some rental properties out in Phoenix Arizona</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s able to contact the tenants</p>
<p>and she convinces them to</p>
<p>start making</p>
<p>their rent checks out to her</p>
<p>instead of Jacob wow you know</p>
<p>she was really doing it she was she was</p>
<p>professional</p>
<p>scammer okay so you know how I mentioned</p>
<p>earlier that</p>
<p>Jacob had a teenage</p>
<p>daughter okay well if you don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>he had a teenage</p>
<p>daughter and</p>
<p>while all of this was happening Louise</p>
<p>running around stealing</p>
<p>money and just being a shitty person</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>knows something is</p>
<p>up with this</p>
<p>shitty woman now</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s daughter she was living with Louise in the</p>
<p>house but my</p>
<p>guess is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a 14 bedroom mansion</p>
<p>so like you</p>
<p>probably really don&rsquo;t have to interact with one another</p>
<p>if your house is that big</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m imagining</p>
<p>right she&rsquo;s probably like on the left wing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on the</p>
<p>right wing and you</p>
<p>never really see each</p>
<p>other unless you have to</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>thinking she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like so concerned with the daughter</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really guessing but eventually the</p>
<p>daughter really</p>
<p>starts to question Louise</p>
<p>I mean her father</p>
<p>has been missing or gone for far too long by this</p>
<p>point so she&rsquo;s like you know what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not getting any straight answers from this Louise</p>
<p>woman let me hire a lawyer in hopes to</p>
<p>help find my father</p>
<p>so a lawyer comes out and questions Louise</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s Jacob</p>
<p>and she just kind of</p>
<p>blows him off saying that she really just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s on a business trip but whatever but she does</p>
<p>agree to give the lawyer</p>
<p>Jacobs financial</p>
<p>and business documents as soon as she can</p>
<p>it might be a few days</p>
<p>until she can gather that information</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;ll hand that over to make sure there wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>any unusual activity</p>
<p>going on you</p>
<p>know hopefully</p>
<p>track where he&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like yeah I&rsquo;ll get that</p>
<p>right over at this</p>
<p>point Louise had rented out</p>
<p>every room in the mansion</p>
<p>and she decides</p>
<p>this is her cue to go</p>
<p>okay she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>well my time has expired here and she packs up her</p>
<p>stuff and she ends up</p>
<p>going back to</p>
<p>Denver Colorado</p>
<p>what Louise</p>
<p>does is she goes crying back to her ex husband Richard</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s taking care of the baby</p>
<p>yeah she goes crying back to him like</p>
<p>take me back I want to be a family</p>
<p>again I miss you</p>
<p>just so messed up</p>
<p>and Richard is like dude I just been taking care of our</p>
<p>daughter for the last 4</p>
<p>months and trying</p>
<p>to figure it out and now you just want to come</p>
<p>waltzing right back in</p>
<p>okay so you know</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a good talker or something and she&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>you can come back you know</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s be a family</p>
<p>again she wants to be a wife now</p>
<p>but back at the Los Angeles mansion</p>
<p>now that Luis</p>
<p>is gone jacob&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter she decides that she is going to</p>
<p>search the house</p>
<p>up and down</p>
<p>and search for any type of clues</p>
<p>just anything</p>
<p>okay evidence</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>will help her figure out what the heck just happened</p>
<p>so the daughter is</p>
<p>searching the</p>
<p>house and on September 23rd 1920</p>
<p>she finds Jacobs or her father&rsquo;s decomposing body</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s tied up in like a number of</p>
<p>courts he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrapped up in</p>
<p>blankets and he&rsquo;s buried in the basement mm hmm</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s buried like in the basement</p>
<p>under some stairs</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure out if it was like in the dirt</p>
<p>maybe the dirt was preventing people from</p>
<p>going down there</p>
<p>cause he wasn&rsquo;t necessarily in the dirt he was</p>
<p>under the stairs</p>
<p>my understanding</p>
<p>either way he was dead</p>
<p>okay so the autopsy</p>
<p>report determined that</p>
<p>Jacob was shot in the head and strangled so</p>
<p>Louis is obviously</p>
<p>their number one suspect so the police try and</p>
<p>track her down they go out to</p>
<p>Denver to question her so they</p>
<p>knock knock</p>
<p>on louis&rsquo;s door</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re asking her hey</p>
<p>did you have anything to do with</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>and she has</p>
<p>a number of theories as what</p>
<p>might have happened to him</p>
<p>one of them involved the mysterious Spanish</p>
<p>woman who shot</p>
<p>Jacob causing his arm to be amputated</p>
<p>it must have been</p>
<p>her but no one was buying that theory anymore because</p>
<p>jacob&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>still had his arms and his legs attached so</p>
<p>no and then Louise</p>
<p>tries to change her story</p>
<p>again this time</p>
<p>claiming that</p>
<p>Jacob isn&rsquo;t dead at all</p>
<p>that the body they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>found inside the mansion oh nae nae that was not him</p>
<p>that was a double</p>
<p>who Jacob had killed himself</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like playing clue or something I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>she thinks this is a murder mystery dinner now at</p>
<p>first when I was researching this I was like let me</p>
<p>guess they believed her</p>
<p>right because like everyone seems to believe her</p>
<p>anyway so police are like what do you mean double</p>
<p>what do you mean</p>
<p>does he have a twin or a look alike or something and</p>
<p>Louis she had no answer for that specific question of</p>
<p>theirs so with that being said they placed her</p>
<p>under arrest for first degree murder and</p>
<p>dragged her ass back to LA now here&rsquo;s what you probably</p>
<p>think that those stories gonna end no</p>
<p>it does not it goes on and on and on</p>
<p>on and on and</p>
<p>on but okay</p>
<p>so Louise she does get arrested and she does get put on</p>
<p>trial for the murder of</p>
<p>Jacob Denton</p>
<p>which starts in January of 1921</p>
<p>and it was the hot gossip at the time</p>
<p>there was thousands of people lining up on the</p>
<p>Daily to watch Louise</p>
<p>walk into the courthouse</p>
<p>and see what she looked like what she was wearing and</p>
<p>stuff cause they were interested</p>
<p>they were super interested newspapers</p>
<p>were reporting on this</p>
<p>trial and they were selling like</p>
<p>crazy so the</p>
<p>media was loving it</p>
<p>cause it was selling newspapers</p>
<p>there was just something</p>
<p>about Louise that had many people captivated</p>
<p>anyhow so the trial</p>
<p>would only last</p>
<p>for a few weeks and then in February of 1921</p>
<p>Louise she was convicted of</p>
<p>first degree murder and she was sentenced to life</p>
<p>in prison now</p>
<p>great beautiful we love that she deserves it</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s more to the</p>
<p>story okay so during her</p>
<p>trial and her</p>
<p>first 2 years of her life sentence</p>
<p>louise&rsquo;s husband remember him Richard</p>
<p>he stayed super</p>
<p>loyal and supportive he pretty much</p>
<p>was the only one who believed that she was innocent</p>
<p>I mean she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>but she believed that she was Louise</p>
<p>she told him straight up listen</p>
<p>you should move on</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;ve been convicted</p>
<p>of murder you can be free to divorce me and remarry</p>
<p>like find yourself a nice</p>
<p>woman you deserve it this is what she&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>and now this was</p>
<p>heartbreaking to him but he agreed</p>
<p>and he was like fine I&rsquo;ll get a divorce but</p>
<p>he tells Louise</p>
<p>that he he was</p>
<p>gonna wait forever for her</p>
<p>cause he knew one day she&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>gonna get released and then they</p>
<p>could be together again</p>
<p>there was just no</p>
<p>other woman out there for him</p>
<p>and Louise was like yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah move or lose it bud</p>
<p>now something</p>
<p>super strange happens let me tell you</p>
<p>because as soon as the 2 of them divorced</p>
<p>Louise she stopped answering richard&rsquo;s</p>
<p>letters and she refused to see him when he came to</p>
<p>visit her at prison</p>
<p>well first of all Louise</p>
<p>claimed that</p>
<p>poor Richard felt so guilty over her conviction</p>
<p>and the fact that they&rsquo;re not together</p>
<p>that he committed suicide</p>
<p>I was trying to figure this one out</p>
<p>because we know that Louise didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>because she was in jail</p>
<p>great right</p>
<p>so my thought was like</p>
<p>maybe she put someone up to it but like why would she</p>
<p>you know I was like well</p>
<p>maybe he did commit suicide</p>
<p>but what are the odds that</p>
<p>every freaking</p>
<p>ex of yours</p>
<p>commits suicide like what is this</p>
<p>you know this lady is deadly</p>
<p>they are dropping</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it I just I don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>maybe he did and then I feel bad</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;m like yeah</p>
<p>okay so Louise</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s using this to her advantage</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>others in jail that no man can resist her charm</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s just kind of</p>
<p>using this to brag</p>
<p>about it all of</p>
<p>their husband&rsquo;s</p>
<p>deaths I guess I</p>
<p>guess maybe people are impressed by it I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know</p>
<p>well get this so Louis</p>
<p>started her sentence at San Quentin</p>
<p>State Prison before being</p>
<p>transferred to like a</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s institution</p>
<p>in California it wasn&rsquo;t far</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s there for a</p>
<p>while and she plays the</p>
<p>role of like this perfect prisoner she&rsquo;s like oh my God</p>
<p>hi I&rsquo;m so happy to be here</p>
<p>like using her</p>
<p>southern charm to make</p>
<p>those around her just</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s such a splendid</p>
<p>little lady</p>
<p>she maintained the prison&rsquo;s flower garden</p>
<p>she worked as a dental assistant</p>
<p>even wrote for the prison newspaper</p>
<p>now she would end up serving 18 years</p>
<p>before Louise was paroled for good behavior in 1939</p>
<p>yeah she&rsquo;s paroled for good behavior</p>
<p>at the age of 59</p>
<p>so she gets out</p>
<p>okay so there was this</p>
<p>woman named</p>
<p>Jesse Marcy</p>
<p>she was like</p>
<p>lobbying for</p>
<p>Louis Louis</p>
<p>louise&rsquo;s release when Louis</p>
<p>was released wow</p>
<p>she would go into</p>
<p>jesse&rsquo;s custody</p>
<p>but the deal was that Luis was</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>jesse&rsquo;s living</p>
<p>housekeeper okay</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the</p>
<p>connection between the 2 but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter because get this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>sweet deal but</p>
<p>Jessie ends up</p>
<p>dying of natural</p>
<p>causes like not even a week</p>
<p>after Luis is released</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s awkward</p>
<p>to Fauna in</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s ass</p>
<p>she has to be how is she doing this natural</p>
<p>causes where</p>
<p>either she is killing them</p>
<p>or people just are</p>
<p>dropping like</p>
<p>flies around her</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s not a coincidence</p>
<p>come on Luis</p>
<p>then she moves in with her probation officer</p>
<p>her name is Emily</p>
<p>so Emily takes her in</p>
<p>and Luis was like okay I&rsquo;ll work as your</p>
<p>housekeeper</p>
<p>and also as your nurse</p>
<p>and take care of her</p>
<p>cause she&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>older so this arrangement it didn&rsquo;t last long</p>
<p>because Emily died of a freaking</p>
<p>heart attack in 1943</p>
<p>I mean come</p>
<p>on why is everyone who comes in contact with this</p>
<p>woman just dropping dead it&rsquo;s so bizarre</p>
<p>for some reason police</p>
<p>never looked further into</p>
<p>these deaths</p>
<p>like since they died of natural</p>
<p>causes there wasn&rsquo;t much to look into</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also because this is the the thought here</p>
<p>that the local police they didn&rsquo;t look into Louise</p>
<p>is like Pastor</p>
<p>Louise at all because</p>
<p>they had no idea that she was on parole in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>because when she was released from prison Louise</p>
<p>changed her name to Anna</p>
<p>Lee yeah she</p>
<p>changed her name</p>
<p>to Anna Lee</p>
<p>lordy lordy lordy</p>
<p>Louise just has</p>
<p>everything all figured out she&rsquo;s one step</p>
<p>ahead so after</p>
<p>Emily died Luis</p>
<p>found another living arrangement</p>
<p>for herself this time it was with an old prison friend</p>
<p>named Margaret</p>
<p>and her husband Arthur</p>
<p>Logan now Margaret and Louise</p>
<p>were good friends</p>
<p>and she always thought Luis was innocent in the</p>
<p>first place</p>
<p>Margaret did</p>
<p>she thought Louise was innocent just a</p>
<p>sweetest little lady</p>
<p>so when she</p>
<p>heard that she was in</p>
<p>trouble she</p>
<p>wanted to help her out so she invites Louise to come</p>
<p>live with her</p>
<p>she was like</p>
<p>hey if you move in with me can you be my living</p>
<p>housekeeper in</p>
<p>trade you know</p>
<p>but also if she</p>
<p>could be a nurse</p>
<p>to Arthur who was suffering from dementia</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s like can you be his nurse</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine</p>
<p>where this is</p>
<p>gonna go but as we have</p>
<p>learned something is off with this</p>
<p>woman and Louis</p>
<p>starts telling neighbors</p>
<p>these rumors</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like hey Arthur</p>
<p>yeah he goes into terrible fits of rage</p>
<p>and he beats his wife Margaret</p>
<p>every night</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>everyone this</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s telling them this rumor</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know why well it&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>sense later</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s telling</p>
<p>everyone this and they&rsquo;re like oh my God like that</p>
<p>sounds so awful and</p>
<p>Louis is telling</p>
<p>the neighbors like don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t mention it to them or</p>
<p>Margaret because like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll just really upset them</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re believing it they&rsquo;re like oh my gosh</p>
<p>poor Margaret</p>
<p>is just in an abusive relationship okay so once</p>
<p>again in June of 1944 Margaret</p>
<p>disappears nobody&rsquo;s seen her nobody has any clue</p>
<p>where she she went</p>
<p>nothing 3 days</p>
<p>after Margaret goes</p>
<p>missing Louise</p>
<p>decides to put</p>
<p>Arthur in a</p>
<p>state hospital</p>
<p>oh yeah she</p>
<p>wheels them</p>
<p>right off the</p>
<p>state hospital</p>
<p>I think this</p>
<p>woman is the actual</p>
<p>devil Louis</p>
<p>moves herself full time into the house</p>
<p>my house now I cannot believe her</p>
<p>so of course the neighbors</p>
<p>are asking what happened to the Margaret and Arthur</p>
<p>and Louis is telling them like</p>
<p>oh my God you guys</p>
<p>Arthur attacked Margaret bit off her nose</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s so disfigured</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s like too embarrassed to come outside</p>
<p>mm hmm that&rsquo;s what she tells them the</p>
<p>cycle continues</p>
<p>but okay look</p>
<p>right before Margaret went missing</p>
<p>Louise had met a new guy he&rsquo;s a banker his name was Lee</p>
<p>and she met him</p>
<p>and they went on to get married</p>
<p>you know how</p>
<p>she does it so she left out that tiny detail</p>
<p>about being in jail for murder though</p>
<p>so he really had no idea</p>
<p>plus he thought her name was Anna</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;ve been dating Margaret</p>
<p>goes missing</p>
<p>and Lee had met Margaret once before</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s asking Louise like hey</p>
<p>what happened to Margaret like it&rsquo;s been a while</p>
<p>where she been you know just asking</p>
<p>just genuinely asking</p>
<p>so Louise repeats the same</p>
<p>story that she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>feeding to the neighbors</p>
<p>but adds that</p>
<p>after the attack Margaret went into isolation</p>
<p>and preparation</p>
<p>for plastic surgery</p>
<p>on her nose</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s weird because Lee and Louise are</p>
<p>actually living inside of Margaret and arthur&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>for about 6</p>
<p>months and he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t further wonder like what the hell is going on</p>
<p>where is Margaret</p>
<p>like he doesn&rsquo;t know or question or I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s believed that he didn&rsquo;t question anything</p>
<p>like what was</p>
<p>going on because Louise was 14 checks and</p>
<p>spending Margaret and arthur&rsquo;s</p>
<p>money on herself</p>
<p>and her new hubby</p>
<p>Lee like you want anything I&rsquo;ll buy it for you</p>
<p>so maybe that&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t care too much and didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>keep asking</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t know but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s believed</p>
<p>to be true so</p>
<p>the spending spree is cut</p>
<p>short when Arthur dies</p>
<p>in December of 1944</p>
<p>and the bank notices that</p>
<p>there are still</p>
<p>checks being cashed with his forge</p>
<p>signature and that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense because Arthur</p>
<p>passed away hmm</p>
<p>so how is a dead guy</p>
<p>signing checks</p>
<p>right so the bank teller calls up the police</p>
<p>who naturally</p>
<p>head over to</p>
<p>where Margaret and arthur&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house where Louise</p>
<p>and Lee are living</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re investigating they&rsquo;re just doing</p>
<p>their questioning</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like hey</p>
<p>you know we</p>
<p>gotta call your fortune</p>
<p>some checks whatever</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just getting a</p>
<p>funny feeling</p>
<p>about the couple</p>
<p>no arrests was made</p>
<p>I think Louise was telling the</p>
<p>police it must be Margaret but margaret&rsquo;s out of town</p>
<p>so the police was like okay we&rsquo;ll come back in a couple</p>
<p>of weeks when Margaret is back and we&rsquo;ll talk to her</p>
<p>so the police come back a couple of weeks</p>
<p>later to further ask questions and maybe even</p>
<p>speak to Margaret at this</p>
<p>point but margaret&rsquo;s been missing for 6 months</p>
<p>so they ask Luis</p>
<p>like okay you know what can we just look around the</p>
<p>house this is just</p>
<p>weird like what is really</p>
<p>going on here</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re looking around the house</p>
<p>and in the backyard they discover</p>
<p>a shallow grave</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s under an avocado tree</p>
<p>and in the shallow</p>
<p>grave is margaret&rsquo;s decomposing body</p>
<p>Louis is immediately arrested</p>
<p>this time only taking a couple of</p>
<p>hours for Louis to be</p>
<p>charged with murder</p>
<p>again so the autopsy report determined</p>
<p>that Margaret had been shot in the back of the neck</p>
<p>and she also had a fractured</p>
<p>skull so during questioning Luis</p>
<p>tells police</p>
<p>that Margaret was actually attacked</p>
<p>and shot to</p>
<p>death by her</p>
<p>husband Arthur</p>
<p>during one of his anger fits</p>
<p>of rage and that she had been telling the neighbors</p>
<p>about it and if they didn&rsquo;t believe her</p>
<p>they should go ask the neighbors because they knew all</p>
<p>about arthur&rsquo;s</p>
<p>abuse honestly</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give her a</p>
<p>point there</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda smart</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kinda</p>
<p>smart I&rsquo;ll give her that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s literally</p>
<p>thinking ahead</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t see that too</p>
<p>often with most killers like this much</p>
<p>so Louise admits to police that in a</p>
<p>panic she had buried Margaret</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t report the incident because she was afraid</p>
<p>that they would charge</p>
<p>her with murder because of her previous convictions</p>
<p>or you know</p>
<p>because maybe she murdered her</p>
<p>but she insisted</p>
<p>she was innocent she did not kill her</p>
<p>so louise&rsquo;s husband Lee</p>
<p>he was also arrested and</p>
<p>charged with murder</p>
<p>and like his wife</p>
<p>he also insisted that he was innocent</p>
<p>the murder charge</p>
<p>against him was</p>
<p>dropped because there wasn&rsquo;t enough evidence</p>
<p>so Lee was released but</p>
<p>his freedom was</p>
<p>short lived because</p>
<p>guess what happens</p>
<p>the very next day</p>
<p>Lee jumps to his</p>
<p>death off the 9th</p>
<p>floor of an office</p>
<p>building in Los Angeles</p>
<p>you guys this is too strange</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if people are just offing themselves</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be funny but</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the case or if they are being killed by</p>
<p>Louis Louise seem to be with in police custody so</p>
<p>maybe he did I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how this is happening I really don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>are they killing themselves or are they being killed</p>
<p>I wanna say that they&rsquo;re being killed</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know anyway so for the</p>
<p>first time Luis actually shows some emotion when she</p>
<p>learns about her new husband&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death and she openly cries</p>
<p>and she tells reporters</p>
<p>media and she felt she was the one to</p>
<p>blame for lee&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death that&rsquo;s because you are</p>
<p>I wonder if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some life insurance she&rsquo;s collecting on</p>
<p>these guys or what the deal really was because</p>
<p>again this is just bizarre</p>
<p>so louise&rsquo;s</p>
<p>3rd and final murder</p>
<p>trial begins on</p>
<p>April 23rd 1945 they get some</p>
<p>media attention</p>
<p>but nobody really cares as much as they did as like the</p>
<p>first time so the prosecution believe that Louise</p>
<p>killed Margaret in</p>
<p>order to gain control over the</p>
<p>Logan family finances</p>
<p>which makes the most sense</p>
<p>prosecution</p>
<p>thought that Louise got in an argument there</p>
<p>must have been an argument between her and Margaret</p>
<p>after she discovered</p>
<p>a check that Louise had forged</p>
<p>which then led to her</p>
<p>killing Margaret</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they believe</p>
<p>happened and it must have</p>
<p>been a very compelling argument because on May 31st</p>
<p>the jury found Louise guilty</p>
<p>of first degree murder again</p>
<p>but this time Louise received the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>okay not life in prison</p>
<p>this time she was</p>
<p>gonna be put down no more of her shenanigans</p>
<p>count was said during her sentencing Louise</p>
<p>sat calmly reading a book</p>
<p>of Chinese philosophy called The Importance of Living</p>
<p>and she only</p>
<p>looked up once to make some kind of mocking facial</p>
<p>expression before</p>
<p>going back to her</p>
<p>so over the next several years</p>
<p>Louise attempted to appeal several times she</p>
<p>maintained that she was innocent</p>
<p>but each appeal</p>
<p>failed her day of</p>
<p>execution finally</p>
<p>arrived April 11th</p>
<p>1948 exactly</p>
<p>8 years after she walked out from the</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s prison the</p>
<p>first time this lady has way too many coincidences</p>
<p>going on in her life huh</p>
<p>anyways Louise tells like</p>
<p>you know her friends in the jail or whatever that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ready she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ready to go she calmly like</p>
<p>walks from her cell to the gas chamber</p>
<p>and it was said she was smiling and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like yeah I don&rsquo;t know yeah and everyone&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>watching her as she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>entering the room now she had a really big</p>
<p>crowd of people</p>
<p>watching her</p>
<p>like one of</p>
<p>the most ever I forget how many it was like 80</p>
<p>I wanna say 80 people are</p>
<p>watching her</p>
<p>be put down</p>
<p>which is very unusual</p>
<p>as the guards left the chamber one of them offered a</p>
<p>final farewell saying</p>
<p>goodbye good luck</p>
<p>breathe deep and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight the gas thanks</p>
<p>and at 10 03 am the deadly gas</p>
<p>pellets dropped</p>
<p>and 10 minutes</p>
<p>later Luis was</p>
<p>declared dead</p>
<p>she was the</p>
<p>second woman in the</p>
<p>state of California to be executed</p>
<p>honestly good</p>
<p>she cost way too much</p>
<p>chaos my God oh my God and that my Friends is the</p>
<p>story of Louise</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what her name is because she</p>
<p>changed it what was her name Louise</p>
<p>Pete I don&rsquo;t even know Louise Pete</p>
<p>great so this</p>
<p>story it totally</p>
<p>sounds fake</p>
<p>it totally does</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a real</p>
<p>story she was</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna call her</p>
<p>crazy but she was crazy</p>
<p>something was off I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even have any words because it&rsquo;s like good there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>place for her I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry girl like you had many chances</p>
<p>oh a lot of chances</p>
<p>and you chose violence</p>
<p>over and over and over</p>
<p>again goodbye</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>but in cases like this totally makes</p>
<p>sense you know like she literally</p>
<p>proof that she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t want change</p>
<p>and women back then seem to be real different</p>
<p>real unique</p>
<p>passionate passionate killers I must say anyways</p>
