    <p>You got like moisturizer all over your face, are you moisturizing?</p>
<p>I am, my skin is so dry, I just got over having food poisoning, and I&rsquo;m like, I dehydrate.</p>
<p>Hold on, let me get this off camera.</p>
<p>Look at this guy, you got makeup on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not makeup, it&rsquo;s moisturizer, dipshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just as bad.</p>
<p>The reason you look like the fucking Crypt Keeper and I look shvi and young and shvelt,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because I do a little skincare routine, okay?</p>
<p>Give me a fucking break.</p>
<p>Look at him, he turned off his camera because he&rsquo;s embarrassed by whatever he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not embarrassed, I just don&rsquo;t need you telling me that shit.</p>
<p>Sacks is in a fucking good mood.</p>
<p>Just a lot of up 15 cents.</p>
<p>Why are you so fucking happy, dummy?</p>
<p>Well, the markets are closed today, it&rsquo;s Good Friday, so my stock portfolio can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be down because the markets are closed.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank Jesus.</p>
<p>Praise Jesus.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good Friday if the markets are closed, my portfolio can&rsquo;t go down anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly a good Friday.</p>
<p>Your portfolio will rise again.</p>
<p>It needs to be resurrected.</p>
<p>And instead, we open-sourced it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, S.I.C.</p>
<p>Queen of Kinwan.</p>
<p>Nowadays, he works in DNA, but in the 90s, all he cared about was the MDMA, the Duke</p>
<p>of DNA, the Titan of Tempe, the Shepherd of the Soy Boys.</p>
<p>He turns water into wine and dollars into dimes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Fulio for Coolio.</p>
<p>The Sultan of Science himself, David Freeburg.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>I have never done drugs, just for the record, but go on.</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>Of course, none of your behavioral problems in high school had to do.</p>
<p>Yeah, neither has Jason.</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Not this morning.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the VC who loves Brie.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll sell you the sleeves off your vestee.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s enthralled with Greenwall.</p>
<p>He eats uppers for supper.</p>
<p>The Rain Man himself, David Sachs.</p>
<p>All right, thank you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome, Dad.</p>
<p>All right, coming around the bend.</p>
<p>That timepiece, what does it do?</p>
<p>It reminds him of how much more money he has than you.</p>
<p>The sweater is worth six dimes.</p>
<p>Laura Piana is above his line.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a super villain with that 1985 Sasakaya.</p>
<p>He be chillin'.</p>
<p>There it is!</p>
<p>He loves SPACs just like junkies love crack.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s your dictator, Chamath Palihapiti.</p>
<p>That works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like becoming the Eminem of intros.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m rhyming shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really solid, bro, I gotta say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m workshopping it.</p>
<p>Shout out to Nick.</p>
<p>And one person on Twitter of 100 gave anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving into my spring sweater season.</p>
<p>My spring sweater collection.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, hold on a second.</p>
<p>I just got a call.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, confirm.</p>
<p>We know what he gives a fuck.</p>
<p>Fucking Christ.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the king of the inane.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s inane at all.</p>
<p>This matters to exactly one person.</p>
<p>No, the person selling you the sweaters.</p>
<p>I think if you took a poll on Twitter,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of people who silently hate it, but love it.</p>
<p>I think a lot more who hate it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to all the news.</p>
<p>So much news going on.</p>
<p>All the news.</p>
<p>Where should we start, Jason, on a Friday afternoon?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m trying to think about it.</p>
<p>Was there any news topic this week?</p>
<p>Because obviously the war in Ukraine has obviously got everybody in America.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, no, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not important anymore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on to the next thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one issue.</p>
<p>Elon put in a bid to buy Twitter outright on Thursday</p>
<p>and take the company private in a deal worth $43 billion.</p>
<p>The most breaking news when we&rsquo;re taping this on Fridays at 11am,</p>
<p>when we typically tape this, is that the board of directors,</p>
<p>you know, the professional board of directors</p>
<p>has decided they would like to get personally sued.</p>
<p>I mean, this is the most insane thing.</p>
<p>I woke up and read this and I was like,</p>
<p>OK, they&rsquo;re creating a poison pen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, a poison pill.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to give Twitter&rsquo;s existing shareholders the ability to buy</p>
<p>more shares if Elon hits 15% of the company at a discount.</p>
<p>Chamath, explain the concept of a poison pill, just generally speaking,</p>
<p>and then give us your, because everybody knows what&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>but like here we are in this whatever,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is the seventh or eighth inning of this saga,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the second.</p>
<p>But where do you think we are in this saga?</p>
<p>And then what happens on Monday?</p>
<p>And describe a poison pill.</p>
<p>A poison pill is basically a defensive maneuver</p>
<p>that a board of directors uses to prevent a hostile takeover.</p>
<p>And basically, the simple way it works is it allows the board</p>
<p>to create enormous amounts of new shares</p>
<p>and effectively dilute the potential hostile acquirer</p>
<p>so that it becomes economically unfeasible</p>
<p>for them to get enough shares to get control.</p>
<p>The way that they do that is that they basically give</p>
<p>everybody except a person that crosses a certain ownership threshold.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s use Twitter as an example.</p>
<p>So Twitter&rsquo;s poison pill basically says that if you get to 15%,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re essentially locked out from a right that then everybody else has</p>
<p>that effectively allows them to buy another share of stock</p>
<p>at I think it&rsquo;s a 50% discount.</p>
<p>And so what it does is it creates an incentive to essentially</p>
<p>almost double the fully diluted shares outstanding of the business.</p>
<p>And what that does is it makes it almost impossible</p>
<p>for the person with 15% to then go and acquire</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s necessary to get to 50%.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of poison pills.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things that you can do with debt.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things that you can do with equity.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing that Twitter did.</p>
<p>I think if anybody&rsquo;s interested in it,</p>
<p>Nick, maybe you can just bring it up,</p>
<p>but you can Google on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a phenomenal article called Revlon versus McAndrew and Forbes.</p>
<p>And McAndrew and Forbes was the holding company</p>
<p>of this very prolific dealmaker in the 70s, 80s, and 90s named Ronald Perlman.</p>
<p>And what happened was he was the CEO of a company called Pantry Pride.</p>
<p>And Pantry Pride made an unsolicited hostile takeover bid for Revlon,</p>
<p>which made makeup.</p>
<p>And basically, you know, there was like 40 to 45 bucks a share.</p>
<p>The board instituted all these poison pills.</p>
<p>The price kept escalating.</p>
<p>Then a private equity firm stepped in, also tried to compete for the asset.</p>
<p>All along the way, there was enough shenanigans</p>
<p>that essentially what Ronald Perlman did was sue Revlon,</p>
<p>which went to Delaware court.</p>
<p>And from it basically came the current framework of law</p>
<p>that we use in this situation.</p>
<p>And basically, what it means is that board directors</p>
<p>have these fiduciary obligations to their shareholders.</p>
<p>And in some cases, these are very broad fiduciary obligations,</p>
<p>meaning do the right thing.</p>
<p>But in some really narrow circumstances, all of that collapses</p>
<p>and their sole focus is to get the best price.</p>
<p>And what a director and a board of directors</p>
<p>typically wants to do in a situation like this</p>
<p>is not end up in that second bucket.</p>
<p>They want to keep all their options available.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t necessarily want to sell to one person.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably going to assume they&rsquo;re going to get fired from the board.</p>
<p>They want to stay on for different reasons, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so right now, what Twitter and their advisors are trying to do</p>
<p>is basically stay in that first bucket,</p>
<p>have all of the options available to them</p>
<p>and not be forced to run an auction.</p>
<p>And I think what Elon will try to do</p>
<p>is essentially use the public pressure that&rsquo;s going to build</p>
<p>and the existing shareholders who own stock at 40 some odd dollars,</p>
<p>a chance to basically get, you know, a 20% payday</p>
<p>by selling it to Elon for 54 bucks or 53, whatever the price was.</p>
<p>And the Twitter board now will have to justify</p>
<p>how whatever they come up with is better than this,</p>
<p>because then if they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re still exercising this broad fiduciary obligations,</p>
<p>you know, one thing I&rsquo;ll tell you as a public company director,</p>
<p>it is a horrendous process when you get sued.</p>
<p>And these guys will be in court for years.</p>
<p>And the incremental pressure that this Twitter board has</p>
<p>is that they can be held personally liable here.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s getting very complicated, very quickly.</p>
<p>Okay, on that note of personal liability,</p>
<p>you have director&rsquo;s insurance.</p>
<p>So how can that pierce through?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t cover it, doesn&rsquo;t cover it.</p>
<p>Have there been examples of this happening?</p>
<p>Yeah, DNO insurance is kind of like,</p>
<p>DNO insurance is their directory and officer insurance</p>
<p>is a layer of protection that we all have</p>
<p>as public company directors.</p>
<p>We actually also have it as private company directors.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah.</p>
<p>But the amount of coverage changes.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;ll tell you is DNO coverage</p>
<p>tends to be relatively nominal</p>
<p>because the risk profile doesn&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>you know, include these kinds of tail events.</p>
<p>And now what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is 10 to $15 billion of equity value</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to either get created</p>
<p>for existing shareholders or get taken away.</p>
<p>And typically what courts will do</p>
<p>is that they will look at the amount of money</p>
<p>and they will start to think about,</p>
<p>you know, compensatory and punitive damages</p>
<p>as a function of how much money was made or lost.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re talking about a realm of risk now</p>
<p>for these directors.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s well beyond what DNO insurance will cover.</p>
<p>So if a lawsuit did happen, Shamath,</p>
<p>you have to find damages.</p>
<p>So if the board found a better offer, great.</p>
<p>But if this thing goes down on Monday,</p>
<p>Elon sells the shares and it goes down to 30.</p>
<p>Now you have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Freeberg.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll say two things.</p>
<p>One is all in all these cases, by the way,</p>
<p>the board is indemnified by the company.</p>
<p>So the individual board members,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s ever been a point in history</p>
<p>when an individual board members</p>
<p>had to pay out of pocket for liability</p>
<p>associated with their actions as a board member</p>
<p>and as a fiduciary,</p>
<p>except when they&rsquo;ve done something</p>
<p>to benefit themselves outside of the company.</p>
<p>Now, in this case, the job of the board</p>
<p>is to use their best judgment</p>
<p>to do what they believe to be in the best interest</p>
<p>of creating the most value possible for the shareholders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple.</p>
<p>When the stock price is at 30</p>
<p>and someone says, I&rsquo;ll give you 50 bucks to say,</p>
<p>oh, well, obviously getting 50 bucks</p>
<p>is in the best interest of the shareholders.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume though that you&rsquo;re on that board</p>
<p>and you know about some super secret plan</p>
<p>that you believe in the next 30 days</p>
<p>is gonna get the stock price to 60.</p>
<p>And your belief in that plan</p>
<p>and your understanding of that plan</p>
<p>gives you a good rationale</p>
<p>for having a debate as a board</p>
<p>that this deal doesn&rsquo;t make sense at 50.</p>
<p>We should hold out until we finish our plan</p>
<p>over the next 30 days,</p>
<p>get the stock up to 60.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll see if someone comes in and says,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;ll give you even more than 60.</p>
<p>It could be something on the product roadmap, right?</p>
<p>This is the complicated point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the current share price.</p>
<p>And there was a history in the 80s and 90s,</p>
<p>early 90s when stocks would drop</p>
<p>tremendously for market volatility reasons</p>
<p>or various some bad news event</p>
<p>or someone quits the board macro.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden the stock price drops</p>
<p>and you have a hostile buyer that says,</p>
<p>oh my God, this company looks super cheap.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna come in and buy it while it&rsquo;s cheap.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll offer them a premium</p>
<p>to the current share price.</p>
<p>And the share price recently</p>
<p>may have been much higher</p>
<p>than the price that&rsquo;s being offered.</p>
<p>And the board says, you know what,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get back to that share price</p>
<p>because the market will pick up again.</p>
<p>The things we&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>are gonna grow us out of this hole.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very hard for us to sit here.</p>
<p>And I know that I want everyone here on the Zoom</p>
<p>to suspend your alliance to Elon</p>
<p>and belief that Elon will do a better job</p>
<p>just for one second.</p>
<p>And just think about the board members.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all been working on quarterly plans,</p>
<p>strategic plans, et cetera,</p>
<p>with the current CEO.</p>
<p>And as a board for Twitter,</p>
<p>that gives them a point of view that says,</p>
<p>may give them a point of view that says,</p>
<p>hey, you know what, we can get back</p>
<p>to 70 bucks a share.</p>
<p>So remember, it was only a few months ago,</p>
<p>Twitter stock was trading at 70.</p>
<p>The stock price dropped with market compression,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all experienced.</p>
<p>And then Elon&rsquo;s come along and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll offer you guys 54 bucks.</p>
<p>And the board&rsquo;s like, wait,</p>
<p>a few months ago, we were at 70.</p>
<p>We have all these great things we&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m just trying to paint the other side</p>
<p>for everyone that this is not just like</p>
<p>a clear cut, obvious deal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their judgment at this point</p>
<p>that they should get more for the stock,</p>
<p>given where they think the company&rsquo;s headed</p>
<p>and where the stock price will eventually get to.</p>
<p>All right, going to you, Sax.</p>
<p>You heard from Friedberg to suspend disbelief</p>
<p>that the greatest entrepreneur on the planet</p>
<p>running two of the most important companies</p>
<p>is not more qualified to run Twitter</p>
<p>than the current CEO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to suspend my disbelief.</p>
<p>Let me make the case for the clear cut,</p>
<p>for the clear cut case here.</p>
<p>Sorry, let me just say something.</p>
<p>He could be better at running this company.</p>
<p>Could be.</p>
<p>Okay, he will be better, Jason,</p>
<p>but the shareholders don&rsquo;t benefit from that.</p>
<p>Because he buys the whole company.</p>
<p>Of course they do.</p>
<p>Well, hold on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting $54 of cash.</p>
<p>They do not have any ownership in Twitter</p>
<p>after Elon takes over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the deal that&rsquo;s on the table.</p>
<p>So if I, as a shareholder, get $54 of cash,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if Elon does a better job</p>
<p>running Twitter down the road</p>
<p>because I have no interest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one fact check on that.</p>
<p>One fact check on that.</p>
<p>He said he wants to bring along</p>
<p>as many of the shareholders as possible.</p>
<p>JCal, that&rsquo;s a thing he said</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not actually in the proposal, right?</p>
<p>So as a board member,</p>
<p>I have to look at the proposal on the table,</p>
<p>which is I got to take $54 of cash</p>
<p>for my shares and give up all the upside.</p>
<p>Sax looks like he&rsquo;s going to explode.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Look, here&rsquo;s the reason</p>
<p>why fiduciary duties exist.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just explain where this concept comes from.</p>
<p>There is fundamentally a principal agent problem.</p>
<p>This is what it&rsquo;s known as</p>
<p>between stockholders</p>
<p>and the people running the company.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>the owners of the company</p>
<p>are the stockholders, okay?</p>
<p>They appoint agents, managers,</p>
<p>to run the company for them.</p>
<p>But those managers can be conflicted.</p>
<p>They have an incentive</p>
<p>not just to get the highest share price</p>
<p>for the stockholders,</p>
<p>but to pocket personally</p>
<p>as many benefits as they can.</p>
<p>And the whole reason</p>
<p>why fiduciary duty was invented</p>
<p>is to prevent that agency problem.</p>
<p>So if the board members</p>
<p>or the CEO of the company</p>
<p>are just looking out for themselves</p>
<p>and trying to pocket personal benefits,</p>
<p>excessive compensation,</p>
<p>or turning down an offer</p>
<p>to sell the company</p>
<p>for a much higher price,</p>
<p>that would be a breach</p>
<p>of their fiduciary duty</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re looking out for themselves.</p>
<p>Parag knows that if Elon buys this company,</p>
<p>he is out of a job.</p>
<p>His head is on the chopping block.</p>
<p>He is fired right away.</p>
<p>Elon has made that clear.</p>
<p>He said in this letter,</p>
<p>on this SEC filing on Thursday,</p>
<p>I have no confidence</p>
<p>in the management of the company.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m unable to buy the whole thing</p>
<p>and take it private,</p>
<p>I will dump all my shares.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all or nothing for him.</p>
<p>So Parag is interested</p>
<p>in preserving his job.</p>
<p>If Elon wins this battle,</p>
<p>Parag is going to have</p>
<p>the shortest executive career</p>
<p>since that pope who got poisoned, okay,</p>
<p>to borrow a line from Wall Street.</p>
<p>So he is incentivized</p>
<p>to fight this thing,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in the interest</p>
<p>of shareholders or not.</p>
<p>Now, what is the incentives</p>
<p>of the border?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re the same.</p>
<p>These are guys who love</p>
<p>the power they derive</p>
<p>from being on this board.</p>
<p>We know Twitter has</p>
<p>enormous cultural power.</p>
<p>These guys,</p>
<p>they enjoy all the benefits they get.</p>
<p>They probably do get some compensation</p>
<p>being on the board,</p>
<p>but they enjoy being</p>
<p>in this very exclusive club</p>
<p>that wields enormous power</p>
<p>over our culture.</p>
<p>And they have no incentive</p>
<p>to give that up.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>how much of the company</p>
<p>do they really own?</p>
<p>You know, not that much.</p>
<p>If you look at the wealth</p>
<p>of the people on Twitter&rsquo;s board,</p>
<p>and we know all the people</p>
<p>on Twitter&rsquo;s board,</p>
<p>their wealth is significantly greater</p>
<p>than whether Twitter stock</p>
<p>sells for 60 or 70.</p>
<p>So and I think that we all know</p>
<p>that these are all</p>
<p>sophisticated actors.</p>
<p>They are all high integrity people.</p>
<p>We all personally know</p>
<p>many of the people</p>
<p>on Twitter&rsquo;s board.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that,</p>
<p>you know, look,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s a variety</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re conflicted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with integrity.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is&hellip;</p>
<p>You could say the same</p>
<p>about any board, Sax, that it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>No, because it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Listen, when we&rsquo;re on a board,</p>
<p>OK, because I&rsquo;m on plenty of boards,</p>
<p>we own a huge percentage</p>
<p>of the company.</p>
<p>So when somebody makes</p>
<p>a takeover offer</p>
<p>to buy one of our companies,</p>
<p>we are thinking like stockholders.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re fundamentally aligned.</p>
<p>You have massive skin in the game.</p>
<p>We have massive skin in the game.</p>
<p>These people on the board,</p>
<p>what skin in the game do they have?</p>
<p>Most of them are these directors</p>
<p>who are disappointed.</p>
<p>And it is, it&rsquo;s like a club.</p>
<p>These guys, it&rsquo;s all big,</p>
<p>backscratching club.</p>
<p>These guys are all on a bunch of different boards.</p>
<p>So wait, you think they&rsquo;re motivated</p>
<p>by the influence of being</p>
<p>a Twitter board member?</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>That being a nexus of power.</p>
<p>Why do they serve on these boards?</p>
<p>And that is what this is shaping up to be,</p>
<p>is a nexus of power</p>
<p>and who controls the power.</p>
<p>By the way, none of them own much of Twitter.</p>
<p>None of them own much of Twitter.</p>
<p>I do 100% agree with Sax.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed</p>
<p>what I think Carl Icahn said</p>
<p>or whoever it was,</p>
<p>that the board should be represented</p>
<p>by the biggest shareholders,</p>
<p>the folks who actually</p>
<p>have skin in the game,</p>
<p>the folks who actually care</p>
<p>about the share price.</p>
<p>You know, having some nominal number of shares</p>
<p>issued to you as a board member</p>
<p>of a public company,</p>
<p>showing up, you know,</p>
<p>patting each other in the back,</p>
<p>it certainly, generally speaking,</p>
<p>leads to non-founder led companies</p>
<p>ultimately dying.</p>
<p>Because there is no motivation</p>
<p>and incentive and drive from anyone.</p>
<p>Let me take the other side partially.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re mostly right.</p>
<p>I would never join</p>
<p>a public company board</p>
<p>that I did not own</p>
<p>a significant piece of.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I have never.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, the reason to be</p>
<p>on a public company board</p>
<p>is that unlike a private company,</p>
<p>the single biggest advantage,</p>
<p>there are many disadvantages</p>
<p>of being public,</p>
<p>but the single biggest advantage</p>
<p>of being public</p>
<p>is that you have a lower cost of capital.</p>
<p>So if you have an ambitious company,</p>
<p>an ambitious leader</p>
<p>and an ambitious plan</p>
<p>to build and compound value,</p>
<p>you cannot do it privately forever.</p>
<p>You must do it in the public markets</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just an infinite</p>
<p>amount of capital that&rsquo;s available</p>
<p>and an infinite amount of ways</p>
<p>in which you can raise capital</p>
<p>relative to you being private.</p>
<p>So with that being said,</p>
<p>when you are public,</p>
<p>I think the best boards</p>
<p>are the ones that are sort of 50 50 split</p>
<p>between the biggest shareholders</p>
<p>and people who are very much experts</p>
<p>in a handful of things.</p>
<p>And I just want to be specific</p>
<p>in a company board.</p>
<p>You have to have a lot of focus these days</p>
<p>on things like governance audit,</p>
<p>because you have to attest</p>
<p>to these financial statements, right?</p>
<p>Cybersecurity becomes a huge one</p>
<p>because you have to disclose these risks.</p>
<p>And so I think that it really behooves</p>
<p>boards to have a few experts</p>
<p>who can chair those committees.</p>
<p>Compensation tends to be another one,</p>
<p>as David mentioned,</p>
<p>that can be a real hot button.</p>
<p>But there are experts you can find.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to own</p>
<p>a large piece of the company,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re going to do a really good job</p>
<p>of managing those things</p>
<p>that minimizes risk for the business</p>
<p>so that then the rest of all of the board,</p>
<p>which are the large shareholders,</p>
<p>can really use their influence</p>
<p>and strategic understanding of the business</p>
<p>to build a huge equity value.</p>
<p>When those things come together,</p>
<p>you have great outcomes.</p>
<p>But I really agree with you.</p>
<p>If you stack the board</p>
<p>and you know, we&rsquo;ve had this issue.</p>
<p>Public boards in America got perverted</p>
<p>over the last sort of last few decades</p>
<p>to being these little badges of status</p>
<p>that people would collect.</p>
<p>And now, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting to see a real pushback</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s called overboarding, right?</p>
<p>Where these distinguished folks</p>
<p>will pick up five, six, seven boards.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, that&rsquo;s the fastest way</p>
<p>to make three, four, five,</p>
<p>$6 million a year.</p>
<p>How can you sit on five or six company,</p>
<p>public company boards?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible and at any value.</p>
<p>Exactly. And do you think those people</p>
<p>get appointed to boards</p>
<p>by standing up to the CEO?</p>
<p>No, the opposite.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to be a safe vote for the CEO.</p>
<p>So let me ask you guys a question.</p>
<p>What do you think is the right thing to do</p>
<p>as companies that go public mature</p>
<p>and their ownership base disperses?</p>
<p>So, you know, in Europe and Asia,</p>
<p>many companies go public,</p>
<p>families own them for a very long period of time.</p>
<p>As you guys know,</p>
<p>they remain significant owners.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t sell off the shares.</p>
<p>In the US, traditionally,</p>
<p>as companies have gone public,</p>
<p>the shares, the founders,</p>
<p>the original investors,</p>
<p>because we have a lot of venture capital</p>
<p>in this country,</p>
<p>historically compared to other countries.</p>
<p>So those owners end up selling off their shares</p>
<p>and they get dispersed</p>
<p>and a long tail of owners end up</p>
<p>owning the bulk of the shares.</p>
<p>How do you think those companies</p>
<p>can be best represented on the board,</p>
<p>given that there isn&rsquo;t concentrated ownership</p>
<p>in public companies,</p>
<p>generally mature public companies</p>
<p>in the US like Twitter,</p>
<p>the largest owner is Vanguard</p>
<p>with 5 million other investments.</p>
<p>And then Jack Dorsey,</p>
<p>he only owns 2%.</p>
<p>What do you guys think is the right thing?</p>
<p>How do you create good alignment</p>
<p>with board members</p>
<p>that could be better placed</p>
<p>and better suited here?</p>
<p>Well, I think one of the ways that you do it</p>
<p>is that when somebody wants to step up</p>
<p>and acquire a concentrated position</p>
<p>because they have a plan for the company,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t stand in the way</p>
<p>and completely thwart that.</p>
<p>Your job isn&rsquo;t to assess their plan</p>
<p>because your job is to assess</p>
<p>the dollars you&rsquo;re getting paid today</p>
<p>for your shareholders.</p>
<p>And then whatever they&rsquo;re going to do with it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s their thing.</p>
<p>But are you getting a fair price?</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Elon is willing to put massive skin</p>
<p>in the game</p>
<p>in order to basically fix this company</p>
<p>and get the best value.</p>
<p>We all agree,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not about the shareholder sacks.</p>
<p>Like I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think Elon should own and run Twitter.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s evaluate this poison pill for a second.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Elon comes in,</p>
<p>he starts buying up the stock.</p>
<p>The premium he&rsquo;s proposing</p>
<p>is something like a 50 something percent premium</p>
<p>from when he started accumulating.</p>
<p>54 percent.</p>
<p>54 percent is like a 38 percent.</p>
<p>But a 40 percent discount.</p>
<p>From the time he basically made the offer.</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>the stock is going right back</p>
<p>to that previous level</p>
<p>if they turn down this proposal.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s made them a good offer.</p>
<p>Okay. Now,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be acceptable for the board to say,</p>
<p>okay, this offer is attractive,</p>
<p>but we need to shop this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to run a process</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to see who else is out there.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s nobody better,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t we take this?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s left over</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t mention.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s left over,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>They absolutely have a responsibility to shop it</p>
<p>and find the best price.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s left over is their judgment</p>
<p>that the company&rsquo;s stock price</p>
<p>will get above that level.</p>
<p>They have the ability and the right to do that.</p>
<p>And the responsibility to do that as a board.</p>
<p>This happens all the time.</p>
<p>The problem is,</p>
<p>the board can look at the deal</p>
<p>and they can say, you know what?</p>
<p>We believe that this business in the future</p>
<p>is going to be worth a lot more</p>
<p>than what we&rsquo;re being offered for cash today.</p>
<p>The problem they have some inside information.</p>
<p>The problem with that argument</p>
<p>is that this is what activist firms use</p>
<p>all the time in reverse.</p>
<p>The inverse of the argument is more powerful.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a director with purview</p>
<p>into all these confidential plans</p>
<p>that has effectively caused this company</p>
<p>to tread water for five years.</p>
<p>Why should we believe you now?</p>
<p>And that argument is way more credible</p>
<p>than actually you can really trust us this time.</p>
<p>Because if you look at the tenure of all these folks,</p>
<p>you know, the last sea change</p>
<p>that happened on the Twitter board</p>
<p>was when Elliott pushed to add,</p>
<p>I think, two or three directors.</p>
<p>But in the absence of that,</p>
<p>I think David is largely right.</p>
<p>These are status games.</p>
<p>And when status games ultimately play out over years,</p>
<p>they either play out in the stock price,</p>
<p>when one way or the other,</p>
<p>and in this case, what&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>is that this is a languishing stock</p>
<p>that has largely been going sideways,</p>
<p>independent of anything that&rsquo;s been happening.</p>
<p>What about the fact that less than 90 days ago,</p>
<p>it was trading at $70?</p>
<p>You mean during the COVID bump?</p>
<p>Yeah, everybody was betting stocks.</p>
<p>I mean, history Friedberg,</p>
<p>it was $69 guys.</p>
<p>You have to give some context.</p>
<p>January 3rd, 2014, the stock was trading at $69.</p>
<p>The fact that it got a ridiculous bump,</p>
<p>like the entire market did during the Robin Hood stonks,</p>
<p>you know, heyday during COVID means nothing.</p>
<p>That was market beta, not their performance.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I was going to say.</p>
<p>If you could actually point to some alpha,</p>
<p>meaning there was a strategic misstep</p>
<p>or something that happened that was fixable,</p>
<p>a better example would be,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say that Twitter instead</p>
<p>was not a technology company, but a pharma company.</p>
<p>This example would be easier to understand.</p>
<p>The stock is at $69,</p>
<p>and you get some interim results</p>
<p>from your phase three trial.</p>
<p>People misread it and the stock tanks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the stock market, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>is at the same level.</p>
<p>You could say, well, that negative alpha</p>
<p>can actually be fixed because of our strategic plan.</p>
<p>But what Sachs just said is more true in this case.</p>
<p>In this case, what&rsquo;s irrefutable</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s been a broad-based drawdown</p>
<p>in the markets.</p>
<p>There is nothing that you can point to</p>
<p>that says this is something inside of Twitter&rsquo;s control</p>
<p>to get the stock back to $69,</p>
<p>meaning 69 three months ago</p>
<p>is actually 38 or $40 today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re at an apples to apples even comparison.</p>
<p>So from there, the real question is</p>
<p>this 20 or 30% premium to this,</p>
<p>can you actually show a plan?</p>
<p>I think the right thing for Twitter&rsquo;s board to do,</p>
<p>just to be very precise, is the following.</p>
<p>They have to take Elon&rsquo;s offer</p>
<p>and they have to create a go shop.</p>
<p>I will go and try to get a better price.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t be able to.</p>
<p>And the reason they won&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>is not a single person who is capable</p>
<p>of stepping up with $43 billion</p>
<p>would ever get it through regulatory muster.</p>
<p>Not going to happen, in my opinion.</p>
<p>And anybody with the 43 billion who could buy it</p>
<p>will never take it on.</p>
<p>Meaning, could Comcast show up?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Could Disney show up?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll never even look at it.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re not interested.</p>
<p>The people for whom this asset is strategic,</p>
<p>Apple, Facebook, Google, can bite dance.</p>
<p>Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon could never get it done.</p>
<p>Nina Khan.</p>
<p>No, Brano.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably right, Shamath,</p>
<p>but there is a chance.</p>
<p>So I just want to finish.</p>
<p>I just want to finish.</p>
<p>From who?</p>
<p>So hold on, just let me finish.</p>
<p>Okay, finish, Shamath, yeah.</p>
<p>And then Sax, who?</p>
<p>So I think basically it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Elon, thank you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to create a Go shop.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try to find the best offer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any offer comes in.</p>
<p>But then I think what they can do, Freeberg,</p>
<p>is if there is this magical plan</p>
<p>to shoot rainbows up their ass,</p>
<p>they should actually put that to a shareholder vote</p>
<p>and let people decide.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a really fair thing to do</p>
<p>that also allows them the credibility</p>
<p>and the air cover to say,</p>
<p>look, we actually have been working on a plan.</p>
<p>We think that that will create</p>
<p>an amazing amount of shareholder value.</p>
<p>And we just want shareholders</p>
<p>to be able to see that,</p>
<p>compare it to Elon&rsquo;s offer,</p>
<p>and decide for themselves.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the white knight, if anybody?</p>
<p>I heard Comcast.</p>
<p>We know that big tech can&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>because of Alina Khan,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll go on to the next topic,</p>
<p>the next nuance here.</p>
<p>Sax, do you have anybody,</p>
<p>a financial player,</p>
<p>anybody who is a dark horse in your mind?</p>
<p>Somebody, you know.</p>
<p>I think it could be Disney.</p>
<p>Jack is on the board of Disney.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of relationships.</p>
<p>Sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>They tried to buy it.</p>
<p>Bob Iger said he bailed on it.</p>
<p>Listen, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of companies</p>
<p>that could be interested in Twitter.</p>
<p>And I think you create the period</p>
<p>to shop it, to see.</p>
<p>And by the way, listen,</p>
<p>I think this administration</p>
<p>does not want to see Twitter</p>
<p>become a free speech company again.</p>
<p>And so the political winds</p>
<p>will blow towards letting,</p>
<p>I think, Twitter be acquired</p>
<p>by a big tech company,</p>
<p>even if it means big tech gets bigger.</p>
<p>So I think they&rsquo;ll put Alina Khan on pause</p>
<p>to allow Google to buy this company,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what it comes down to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kidding me.</p>
<p>Your conspiracy theory is that</p>
<p>I will bet 100 to 1 against that.</p>
<p>Will you take 100 to 1 odds against that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying if it comes down to it.</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s going to whisper in Alina Khan&rsquo;s ear,</p>
<p>put your thumb on the scale</p>
<p>and let Google buy this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that the Dems can own it.</p>
<p>The Libs can still own Trump.</p>
<p>If it was a choice,</p>
<p>if it was a choice between.</p>
<p>What David&rsquo;s saying is my enemy&rsquo;s enemy</p>
<p>is my friend.</p>
<p>And so instead of having Elon&rsquo;s stated goal,</p>
<p>I guess what David is saying</p>
<p>is instead of having Elon&rsquo;s stated goal</p>
<p>of having a free speech platform</p>
<p>at scale exist on the Internet,</p>
<p>which they may believe</p>
<p>is even the bigger threat to political power,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d rather it go into the hands of companies</p>
<p>that will acquiesce to them,</p>
<p>at least on the margins.</p>
<p>But no question about it.</p>
<p>Biden would tell Alina Khan</p>
<p>to put her thumb on the scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>You believe that conspiracy theory?</p>
<p>From their point of view.</p>
<p>I do not personally,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just trying to explain.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m on a radio,</p>
<p>but go on here.</p>
<p>Listen, yeah, where&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>what is this all about?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my tinfoil hat?</p>
<p>And by the way, I just want I just just to go back.</p>
<p>What is this all about?</p>
<p>I just sent you guys.</p>
<p>Hold on one sec.</p>
<p>I just sent you guys the revenue chart for Twitter.</p>
<p>It may not be that impressive</p>
<p>relative to enterprise software companies and others.</p>
<p>But I want to be really clear.</p>
<p>I am not arguing against this deal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to give you guys the perspectives</p>
<p>that we all have a really kind of honest dialogue about this.</p>
<p>Why this board may actually stand on their own two feet</p>
<p>and win with shareholders</p>
<p>by saying, you know what,</p>
<p>look, our revenue has been going up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to grow revenue.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re continuing to grow usage on the platform.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got all these products that we&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real reason that we&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>more than $54 a share over the next 12 to 18 months</p>
<p>as we start to deliver this year&rsquo;s numbers</p>
<p>and we start to deliver these product features</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve all been sharing</p>
<p>and talking about in the progress we&rsquo;ve been seeing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s honestly,</p>
<p>I think the most likely kind of middle ground here</p>
<p>is that this board has enough to stand on</p>
<p>by looking at the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if the stock&rsquo;s gone up and down.</p>
<p>What matters is that they&rsquo;ve been in their minds,</p>
<p>steadily improving the business</p>
<p>and continuing to improve the business.</p>
<p>And it is an iconic asset that the market should own,</p>
<p>not a single person and yada, yada.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s going to be part of the case.</p>
<p>Let me make two points.</p>
<p>First, the problem with Freeberg&rsquo;s argument</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s no limiting principle to this.</p>
<p>Any board at any time could always claim</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve seen the magical plan.</p>
<p>And therefore they can reject the bid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem with it.</p>
<p>Okay, agreed.</p>
<p>And particularly in this case,</p>
<p>we have to look at the track record</p>
<p>of this management team,</p>
<p>which it barely exists,</p>
<p>but also this culture at Twitter, okay?</p>
<p>This is a company that&rsquo;s languished for years.</p>
<p>The culture, look, this culture, a decade.</p>
<p>This culture has been so inept</p>
<p>that in response to Elon&rsquo;s takeover offer,</p>
<p>they gave all the employees a day of rest because-</p>
<p>Oh no, that&rsquo;s a reoccurring monthly thing.</p>
<p>They have a day of rest.</p>
<p>No, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The employees were so stressed out.</p>
<p>The employees were so stressed out,</p>
<p>they told them to stay at home and take it easy.</p>
<p>Okay, this is, this is a weak-</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know the emotional labor it takes</p>
<p>to deal with this.</p>
<p>This team is weak, okay?</p>
<p>Soft.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s soft, okay?</p>
<p>Work isn&rsquo;t weak.</p>
<p>And Elon would give the whole company an enema</p>
<p>and fix this thing.</p>
<p>And that is why they don&rsquo;t want him taking over.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you are 100% right.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the question at hand.</p>
<p>But this is why you should not let this board</p>
<p>and this CEO invoke some magical plan</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have, that they never came up with,</p>
<p>and they would never come up with</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just a big excuse.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not out of a job.</p>
<p>Okay, but now let me go-</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>I never got a chance to make the second point.</p>
<p>Let me respond to the tinfoil hat thing.</p>
<p>So listen, what is this story really about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about free speech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about for Elon.</p>
<p>He said in this takeover,</p>
<p>and then at the speech that he gave at TED,</p>
<p>that listen, this is not about economics for me.</p>
<p>Twitter needs to be the open town square.</p>
<p>It is the marketplace for ideas.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to make it a free speech platform.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to open source the algorithm</p>
<p>so people know when they&rsquo;re being canceled,</p>
<p>they know why they were taken down.</p>
<p>Is that algorithmic?</p>
<p>Was that a human intervention?</p>
<p>This is what it&rsquo;s about for Elon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also what it&rsquo;s about-</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also what it&rsquo;s about for all the elites,</p>
<p>for everyone observing this,</p>
<p>for everyone who&rsquo;s criticizing it.</p>
<p>Listen, look at the reactions.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked at all about the hysterical reactions</p>
<p>to all of this news that happened.</p>
<p>There was a fantastic tweet here.</p>
<p>Business Insider said that</p>
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s attempt to buy Twitter</p>
<p>represents a chilling new threat.</p>
<p>Billionaire trolls taking over social media.</p>
<p>This is one problem.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, Business Insider&rsquo;s headline was</p>
<p>Billionaire Jeff Bezos,</p>
<p>Washington Post spy,</p>
<p>marks a fascinating cultural transition in America.</p>
<p>These guys are completely hypocritical.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s a billionaire that they like,</p>
<p>they praise it.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s a billionaire supporting free speech,</p>
<p>they oppose it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You had Jeff Jarvis with this insane-</p>
<p>Professor Jeff Jarvis?</p>
<p>Yes, saying today on Twitter feels like</p>
<p>the last evening in a Berlin nightclub</p>
<p>at the twilight of Weimar, Germany.</p>
<p>I mean, somehow these people think</p>
<p>that the re-institution,</p>
<p>the restoration of free speech</p>
<p>is somehow like the end of Weimar, Germany.</p>
<p>And then I think probably the best example</p>
<p>was this tweet by Max Boot,</p>
<p>where he says that for democracy to survive,</p>
<p>we need more content moderation,</p>
<p>i.e. censorship, not less.</p>
<p>So in the warped mind of all of these elites</p>
<p>and the media, the corporate media,</p>
<p>they think that for democracy to survive,</p>
<p>they need more censorship.</p>
<p>This is the worst thing the Democrats ever did</p>
<p>is give the Republican Party free speech.</p>
<p>That was our issue.</p>
<p>How we gave it to you guys is just insane.</p>
<p>By the way, this is your bias in evaluating this deal.</p>
<p>I want to point that out.</p>
<p>You talk about the board&rsquo;s bias,</p>
<p>but you do have a bias on,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not really the question at hand.</p>
<p>The question at hand is $54,</p>
<p>the fair price to pay for this company.</p>
<p>No, I know, but it is also about free speech.</p>
<p>There is another issue here at its core.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>Sorry, I agree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the deal,</p>
<p>but that is why Elon&rsquo;s buying the company.</p>
<p>I agree. I agree. I agree.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not doing it for profit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just pointing out that we all criticize the board</p>
<p>and we all criticize them for not taking the deal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re motivated generally</p>
<p>because we want to see the deal happen.</p>
<p>We want to see Elon do it.</p>
<p>I want to be, I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>First of all, the stock is basically the same price</p>
<p>it was in December of 2013.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what happened in the market during that time?</p>
<p>It went absolutely up and to the right in a violent manner.</p>
<p>Right. So if you had a strategy to not grow</p>
<p>and you deployed it,</p>
<p>could you actually achieve this performance?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just saying that&rsquo;s just an objective fact</p>
<p>that we have to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Whatever has happened has collectively not worked.</p>
<p>And it is, it is systematic,</p>
<p>meaning the underperformance is not a quarter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in a month,</p>
<p>but whatever has happened here collectively</p>
<p>inside this business</p>
<p>has not been working for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Okay. So just getting all the emotion out,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay. And so at some point people will say,</p>
<p>well, the devil I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>is better than the devil.</p>
<p>I do know because the devil I do know</p>
<p>is destroying money for me at a horrific rate,</p>
<p>which if you look at how the S and P is compounded</p>
<p>since 2013 versus now,</p>
<p>I mean, my gosh,</p>
<p>if you had done a spread trade of long,</p>
<p>the S and P and short Twitter,</p>
<p>you would have made a fortune.</p>
<p>How about long Tesla short Twitter?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m just trying to give the general market.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just trying to give you</p>
<p>the general market math, right?</p>
<p>Forget any individual.</p>
<p>Right. And look, Friedberg,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just ideological here.</p>
<p>I think we all agree on the correct economic thing</p>
<p>to have happened here,</p>
<p>which is that the Twitter board should run a process.</p>
<p>They should see if there&rsquo;s a better bid out there.</p>
<p>If there is, you play for the bigger bid,</p>
<p>make Elon come up on the price.</p>
<p>Okay. But if there&rsquo;s not a better bid,</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s offer is the best deal on the table.</p>
<p>I think you take it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what economically should happen,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>And the reason it&rsquo;s not going to happen</p>
<p>is not because of superior economics or a magical plan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be cause the,</p>
<p>the board members on this country club,</p>
<p>they call a board.</p>
<p>Their interest is to stay on that board.</p>
<p>Parag&rsquo;s interest to stay as CEO</p>
<p>and all the elite observers and the media,</p>
<p>all the people denouncing Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you guys some numbers.</p>
<p>Want censorship to remain in place.</p>
<p>That is what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Give me one second.</p>
<p>I want to ask one question.</p>
<p>You have a lot of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You have a decent amount of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Some.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s trading like 40,000.</p>
<p>If I said, I&rsquo;m going to buy out all your Bitcoin for 45,000,</p>
<p>would you take it?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a different situation</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t make an offer for that.</p>
<p>And by the way, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no, here&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no principal agent problem in that context.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fully decentralized currency.</p>
<p>You have a point of view on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>No, forget about the structure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming to you and I&rsquo;m saying, Hey,</p>
<p>sacks, I want to buy all your Bitcoin for 45,000.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your answer?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trading 40.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s not a share.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a share.</p>
<p>So then put it, put it to a vote.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m trading.</p>
<p>Then put it to a vote.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let every single shareholder decide,</p>
<p>then put it to a vote and we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, Freiburg,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no limits on your ability to go on the open market and buy Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So if you do want to try and acquire a hundred percent of Bitcoin,</p>
<p>go on the open market and acquire it.</p>
<p>I mean, there are people trying to build big positions.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So go do that.</p>
<p>But there are huge limits.</p>
<p>I just want to hold on.</p>
<p>There are big limits on the ability</p>
<p>of Elon to go on the open market and just keep buying up all of Twitter.</p>
<p>And the poison pill is now this poison pill.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve stopped it.</p>
<p>Do you agree with the poison pill, Freiburg?</p>
<p>J Cal, hang on.</p>
<p>I want to explain why that is,</p>
<p>because this is really important from a corporate governance perspective.</p>
<p>So people understand what you&rsquo;re saying is right.</p>
<p>But the job of the board is to look out for the interests of all shareholders,</p>
<p>particularly minority shareholders,</p>
<p>people that own a small stake in the company.</p>
<p>So if someone came along,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a private equity firm owned 60% of a public company,</p>
<p>the board can&rsquo;t just act in the interest of the private equity firm.</p>
<p>They have to protect the smaller shareholders.</p>
<p>And so their job is to say,</p>
<p>is there upside for the smaller shareholders that their vote should matter more?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we have a board to have that judgment debate and to decide.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not arguing against you as much as I&rsquo;m explaining</p>
<p>what goes on in the lawyers meetings with the board.</p>
<p>This is what they&rsquo;re telling.</p>
<p>I think basically your job is to look out for all shareholders.</p>
<p>So Elon can go out and buy a bunch of shares.</p>
<p>But if he doesn&rsquo;t have 30% of the shares,</p>
<p>the board has to represent the interest for those 30%.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think I think what the what also works and what normally good boards will do,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know whether Twitter will or will not do this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m assuming these are, you know, they&rsquo;ll do the right thing here.</p>
<p>Because we do know most of them, they should probably get a fairness opinion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Goldman is doing evaluation as we speak.</p>
<p>But again, when you factor in what&rsquo;s happened to this stock over the last decade,</p>
<p>and when you factor in the market beta today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I think you&rsquo;re going to have a very hard case to make</p>
<p>that there is a path to an outcome that&rsquo;s a lot bigger in an obvious way here.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s going to pass a lot of mustard.</p>
<p>And so the problem that this board will have is justifying</p>
<p>the alternative of not taking this.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be harder than you think.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s going to create an enormous amount of backlash where,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a probably a lot of shareholders</p>
<p>that would probably want to get out.</p>
<p>You have to understand, like, why are Vanguard and all these guys owning Twitter,</p>
<p>they have to own it through these ETS that they&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t necessarily have a point of view on the company.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>And so, you know, they&rsquo;re out to just basically,</p>
<p>so when you really boil it down, how many concerned interested shareholders are there?</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s Elon is clearly the largest there, you know, and then after that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably only 30 or 40% of the total outstanding equity.</p>
<p>I bet Jack has a really I bet Jack is the linchpin and what&rsquo;s going to happen here,</p>
<p>you know, his point of view on this transaction and whether or not Elon should be the steward</p>
<p>of this business going forward, and whether this is a fair price for him,</p>
<p>is going to sway a big part of how this process is going to go.</p>
<p>Jack owns 2%, Elon owns over 9%.</p>
<p>Yeah, but my point, my point is, I think Jack&rsquo;s going to be a big opinion setter</p>
<p>in that board discussion.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re, I think they&rsquo;re simpatico and they&rsquo;re friendly.</p>
<p>So just to give you guys a number to react to here, 2021 revenue is 5 billion.</p>
<p>They have 8000 employees back of the envelope $625,000 per employee in revenue.</p>
<p>Just looking at Google, which is the greatest business ever created,</p>
<p>perhaps in terms of efficiency, as we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>they have 135,000 employees and revenue is 257 billion,</p>
<p>which puts them at two close to 2 billion, 2 million per employee.</p>
<p>How many people sacks on an operational basis?</p>
<p>Does this business actually need to run efficiently?</p>
<p>8000.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could fire half those people or more,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be absolutely no impact to the business.</p>
<p>In fact, they probably run better because right now,</p>
<p>they probably got too many meetings happening with too many people.</p>
<p>We all know this.</p>
<p>That company culturally has been broken for a long time.</p>
<p>Elon comes to you and says, you&rsquo;re my guy, you did Yammer, you&rsquo;re in charge.</p>
<p>Would you run it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you take this?</p>
<p>No, of course he would.</p>
<p>Of course you see now guys, come on.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>You take the job for 10%.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a liar.</p>
<p>Would you take the job for 10%?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m done operating companies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of it.</p>
<p>What if?</p>
<p>What if your funds got?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like doing real work.</p>
<p>Wait, hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>I think I think I think this is time.</p>
<p>I think this is time where we where we can share.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too old.</p>
<p>I think it was six years ago, five years ago, I did approach Twitter with</p>
<p>another large investor, but it was more of a friendly activist thing.</p>
<p>And David was our nominated CEO.</p>
<p>Oh, that place apart.</p>
<p>Breaking news.</p>
<p>Much credit all in.</p>
<p>But now after that meeting, which which was a little heated,</p>
<p>their VP of engineering and CTO quit the next day.</p>
<p>I remember.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Just at the concept of reporting it to SACs, they quit.</p>
<p>They rage quit at the possibility.</p>
<p>You know, startups are like the NBA.</p>
<p>I mean, you get to a certain age, you&rsquo;re just, you know, you&rsquo;re too old.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the coach.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be Phil Jackson.</p>
<p>Guys, it&rsquo;s flattering, but I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done operating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of all that.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Zach, who do you think?</p>
<p>I go on Zoom calls a couple of times a day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great life.</p>
<p>Zach, Elon can&rsquo;t run it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a lot going on.</p>
<p>Who do you think should be the actual CEO, the day to day CEO there?</p>
<p>Well, I think Elon would figure.</p>
<p>I think he would go in and figure it out.</p>
<p>I mean, he is obviously an extremely competent operator.</p>
<p>But who would be on the ground?</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s got a lot of people he can probably plug in there.</p>
<p>You know, my understanding of the way that things work at Tesla and SpaceX is he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>some terrific young talent who he appoints to these sort of project manager or product</p>
<p>manager positions.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s got like 20 of them reporting to him.</p>
<p>And they run the company doing a whole sequence of projects in parallel.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So he has like a bench, like Elon is the new GE.</p>
<p>Remember when GE, when all the talent used to go there?</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s got so much incredible talent on his bench.</p>
<p>He could parachute in some amazing operators there and clean up that place.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, the AI team on that self driving team, which I&rsquo;ve met, and I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>their work, like, you know, in private, and it&rsquo;s so impressive that if he took one of</p>
<p>the AI people working on self driving, and drop them into Twitter, I&rsquo;m one, they would</p>
<p>solve the bot problem, the spam problem in 30 days with one, and if God forbid, he sent</p>
<p>three, they would solve it in the weekend.</p>
<p>The fact that they can&rsquo;t solve spam, and bots and other machine going on at that company</p>
<p>is crazy, right?</p>
<p>He would fix that, by the way, there would be less, sort of, there would be less problematic</p>
<p>content on that site with Elon running it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;ll be less harassment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be less harassment, because he gave her all the bots he&rsquo;d imposed.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s doing the brigading?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all these bot armies.</p>
<p>The problem is, they don&rsquo;t want the bots to go because the only sign of life in that</p>
<p>business is spammers and, you know, all these fake accounts being created.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re just scared to take that 20% hit.</p>
<p>But the site would be cleaner without it.</p>
<p>But look, Jason, I really think that part of the problem with our conversation today</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re viewing this whole Elon versus Twitter thing, purely in economic and to some</p>
<p>degree operational terms, when really, I think this is also an ideological and cultural battle</p>
<p>or struggle.</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;ll go to that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>And this is why it&rsquo;s really captured the imagination of the public.</p>
<p>There, look, what is the, if you were to sort of zoom out 30,000 foot view, the big struggle</p>
<p>of our time, politically and culturally, is populist versus elitist, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big battle that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Elon is one of the rare billionaires who is sort of anti-elitist.</p>
<p>He pokes fun at their pieties all the time.</p>
<p>This is why they call him a troll, okay?</p>
<p>He wants to restore free speech.</p>
<p>Somehow, the elites are now on the side of censorship.</p>
<p>Like Max Boot said, they believe that in order to protect democracy, they need more</p>
<p>censorship.</p>
<p>What they really mean is to protect their control over democracy.</p>
<p>They need censorship.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re greatly outnumbered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more populists than elitists.</p>
<p>So if the more democratic this country becomes, the more they are going to lose power and</p>
<p>be kicked out.</p>
<p>That is why they are so fiercely resisting the restoration of Twitter as a free speech</p>
<p>platform.</p>
<p>It means the end of their cultural power.</p>
<p>The Axios headline encapsulates that to a T.</p>
<p>I gave you guys the link, Nick.</p>
<p>You can show it.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s richest man, someone who used to be compared to Marvel&rsquo;s Iron Man, is increasingly</p>
<p>behaving like a movie supervillain, commanding seemingly unlimited resources with which to</p>
<p>finance his mischief making.</p>
<p>I mean, what a&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you really?</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>This is the same guy that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s journalism?</p>
<p>I mean, this is the same guy that&rsquo;s doing more on climate change and has been doing</p>
<p>it to, you know, 20 years ago when it wasn&rsquo;t popular and satellites.</p>
<p>But I said this before, and space travel, and I said this before, but I just want to</p>
<p>say it again.</p>
<p>I think if he does get a control of Twitter and there is a strong, reliable moral force</p>
<p>for free speech, I think that&rsquo;s actually going to be his biggest contribution to society.</p>
<p>Because independent of all these other things, you know, we want sort of this political philosophy</p>
<p>of democracy and capitalism to roughly work together.</p>
<p>And I think it sits on top of this fundamental idea that you can say what you think without</p>
<p>retribution.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only there you can actually seek out different opinions, and try different</p>
<p>ideas, and say things, and most importantly, make mistakes.</p>
<p>And right now, we have such a high cost for making mistakes that it just shuts so many</p>
<p>people down and out.</p>
<p>And if he does that, that&rsquo;s actually a really big deal.</p>
<p>I think, globally, you know what that Axios headline could have said, you&rsquo;re not that</p>
<p>could have said, Elon Musk spends significant portion of his fortune to restore trust in</p>
<p>public square by open sourcing, but you can&rsquo;t open or hold on open sourcing the API and</p>
<p>allowing transparent moderation.</p>
<p>No, Jason, what he said in his TED talk, Jason, they can&rsquo;t because they lose power.</p>
<p>If Elon wins and gets control of Twitter, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Look, the journalist like Axios, they don&rsquo;t make a lot of money, what they have is some</p>
<p>degree of status.</p>
<p>But more importantly, they have influence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they do those jobs.</p>
<p>And the fact the matter is, and their influences and hat enhance when other people don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the right to speak.</p>
<p>And the reason why Elon is a supervillain, in their eyes, is because he&rsquo;s going to give</p>
<p>the people their right to free speech back.</p>
<p>That is what this is really about.</p>
<p>And they are adamantly opposed to that.</p>
<p>Now, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, every member of the press would have defended the First</p>
<p>Amendment.</p>
<p>They saw freedom of speech, freedom of the press as synonymous and fundamental to our</p>
<p>republic.</p>
<p>Today, they don&rsquo;t believe that anymore.</p>
<p>History has been inverted.</p>
<p>Glenn Greenwald actually had a great paragraph about this.</p>
<p>If I could just, I know, Jason, in front of the fact that-</p>
<p>Here we go, in front of Glenn Greenwald.</p>
<p>Look, I mean, I&rsquo;m a Glenn Greenwald fan all the minute, but what he said is that somehow</p>
<p>these elites, they&rsquo;ve somehow inverted history.</p>
<p>So now they believe that it is not censorship that is the favored tool of fascist tyrants</p>
<p>and authoritarians.</p>
<p>Even though every fascist and despot in history used censorship as a key means for maintaining</p>
<p>power, but they instead believe that it is free speech, free discourse, and free thought</p>
<p>that are the instruments of repression.</p>
<p>So that is what it is about.</p>
<p>But the irony is that these elites now believe in the use of authoritarian tactics to preserve</p>
<p>their cultural power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the battle that&rsquo;s taking place right now.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re conflating harassment on a platform or hearing opinions they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>with actual censorship.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be harassment, sadly, in the world, and you can build tools to mitigate</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things I don&rsquo;t understand, I don&rsquo;t know if you know this feature they</p>
<p>added last year or so, where you can say, only your followers can reply.</p>
<p>All these people who are complaining about harassment, I never see any of them say,</p>
<p>my followers can reply.</p>
<p>If they did, they would never have anybody reply who they didn&rsquo;t want to reply.</p>
<p>The problem would be solved.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Lots more to come on this topic.</p>
<p>I want to just get five predictions.</p>
<p>That was a long topic for us.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it is the perfect topic for us because you have freedom of speech, you</p>
<p>have markets, you have governance.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just everything, entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>I just want to end with, we&rsquo;re here 30 days from now.</p>
<p>What is your majority case?</p>
<p>What is your majority probability here of what happens?</p>
<p>Give it a second.</p>
<p>What is the stock trading at?</p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s running the company in 30 days?</p>
<p>Sachs, you&rsquo;re first.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>This goes back to my tinfoil theory.</p>
<p>I think one of two things is going to happen.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, Elon is going to be thwarted by these folks.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not going to get control of this company.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the vested interest in stopping him by the board, by the new CEO, and by the corporate</p>
<p>media and the political elites is too great.</p>
<p>They will find a way to stop him.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And one of two things is going to happen.</p>
<p>Either the poison pill will win and Twitter stock will be down in the dumps 30 days from</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be the same price it was when Elon started accumulating around that price.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be back in the dumps.</p>
<p>And to Chamath&rsquo;s point, all these board members are going to be sued, justifiably so, because</p>
<p>they did not pursue the best deal of the company.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s one other possibility that they will find a buyer for Twitter.</p>
<p>And the way they will defeat Elon will be to find another buyer at the same or greater</p>
<p>price.</p>
<p>And they will place Twitter in the hands of another company who they regard as culturally</p>
<p>safer because that company buys into the regime of censorship.</p>
<p>And it might be Disney.</p>
<p>It might even be Google.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, I think that if Google were the company to step up, the administration</p>
<p>would ultimately support that deal rather than Elon getting the company.</p>
<p>And I think they would tell Lena Kahn to stand down in that instance and let it go through.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Lena Kahn, you have-</p>
<p>And we will find out.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m telling you, in 30 days, we will find out how rigged this game is and how deep the</p>
<p>corruption goes, because they will do anything to stop Elon from acquiring this company,</p>
<p>even if it means violating their fiduciary duty or violating antitrust law.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You got it, Alex Jones position.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go free bird.</p>
<p>I mean, I am not at all-</p>
<p>What is the majority case in 30 days?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at all conspiratorial as Sachs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that this is about-</p>
<p>I agree with your first part, Sachs.</p>
<p>Protect.</p>
<p>I think that we have a board of rational actors.</p>
<p>I really do.</p>
<p>I think that they&rsquo;re going to do what they think is in the best interest of shareholders</p>
<p>in terms of price per share.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re going to operate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all super smart, super ethical, high integrity people on that board.</p>
<p>Now, would I like to see Elon own and operate Twitter personally?</p>
<p>Yes, I would.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, I think he&rsquo;s going to be a better operator.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s going to make that product better.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s going to make the business better.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be-</p>
<p>Better product.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to have a much more rational view on moderation that I think has been lost over</p>
<p>the last couple of years.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;ll innovate in ways that we haven&rsquo;t seen in that business in many years.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be excited for him to own that business as a user of Twitter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that-</p>
<p>I think the board&rsquo;s going to act rationally.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to try and find the best price.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to reject his offer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s going to up the offer significantly to the point to get it done.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to go out and run a long strategic process.</p>
<p>Three months from now, we&rsquo;re still going to be running that process.</p>
<p>That process is not going to be done.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s going to have a real answer.</p>
<p>Elon&rsquo;s going to trail off and do something else.</p>
<p>And this whole thing will kind of fade into the sunset.</p>
<p>And stock will be trading where in three months?</p>
<p>35 bucks a share, 37 bucks a share.</p>
<p>What is the majority case here?</p>
<p>30 days, 90 days from now?</p>
<p>I think the 30 days is we&rsquo;re going to kind of still be here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think much is going to get figured out in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>In the next 90 days, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to see a better offer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anybody wants to buy this dumpster fire.</p>
<p>Because you have to understand this dumpster fire is twofold, right?</p>
<p>On the one hand, you have a whole user usage, bot, spam, harassment problem.</p>
<p>And then you have an internal issue around culture and monetization and all of this other stuff.</p>
<p>And so you have to be really prepared to step in and deal with both of these two</p>
<p>issues in a really definitive way.</p>
<p>I think that that I&rsquo;m not sure that corporate boards and</p>
<p>companies and CEOs have the stomach for all of that.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better bidder.</p>
<p>But I think within 90 days, they&rsquo;re going to probably first try to reject it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that that&rsquo;s in the best fiduciary interest of shareholders.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t think it is.</p>
<p>And I think to reject it would be more a sign of ego than a sign of logic.</p>
<p>And then I think they are going to get sued.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re going to be embroiled in lawsuits for years.</p>
<p>So no sale happens, the stock languishes again, stalemate, disaster.</p>
<p>Well, I think by saying it, look, I mean, if you look at the stock,</p>
<p>like a simple stock market analyst would say,</p>
<p>whenever there&rsquo;s a merger announced, right at like x price, right?</p>
<p>Like look at Microsoft and Activision.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a better example.</p>
<p>You know, Microsoft announces the stock was at like, you know, $57, $58 a share.</p>
<p>Microsoft says, we&rsquo;re going to buy Activision.</p>
<p>I think it was for $95 a share, right?</p>
<p>And if you notice, the stock hasn&rsquo;t gone to 95.</p>
<p>Now, typically merger arb, merger arbitrage,</p>
<p>what happens is that the stock goes to $1 or $2 of the acquisition price right away,</p>
<p>almost immediately.</p>
<p>Or it goes to within $5 or $10 or 5 or 10%.</p>
<p>And then it bleeds towards the M&amp;A price as the deal gets closer to certainty.</p>
<p>So when there&rsquo;s a big gap,</p>
<p>what the market is voting is that the deal is not going to happen.</p>
<p>And so when you look at the gap, Microsoft Activision,</p>
<p>it kind of says it&rsquo;s going to take a long time.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a risk that it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you look at this Twitter thing,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t it go to $53 a share?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because a lot of people think that the board&rsquo;s not going to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>The fix is in.</p>
<p>So conspiratorial.</p>
<p>Saks, do you listen to Alex Jones?</p>
<p>The fix is happening in plain sight, Freeberg.</p>
<p>Chamath just said it.</p>
<p>Why is the price below $54?</p>
<p>Listen, when a deal is going to go through,</p>
<p>the price goes right up to like below that price.</p>
<p>The price is well below $54.</p>
<p>I think the reason the price isn&rsquo;t going up is there is no buyer who wants this asset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be years to clean it up.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, Jason, Jason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a buyer who wants it.</p>
<p>Even if you thought that there was another buyer that was going to come at a higher price,</p>
<p>the money good thing to do</p>
<p>is for people to basically buy that equity to basically bleed into the acquisition price.</p>
<p>No, no, I get all that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so the fact that it didn&rsquo;t move at all, in my opinion,</p>
<p>is a concerted belief that the board is going to reject the offer.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Even if there was another offer.</p>
<p>And what they didn&rsquo;t want to do is buy the stock at $50,</p>
<p>have the thing all of a sudden get announced as, you know, we&rsquo;re not going to take it.</p>
<p>Elon dumps his shares.</p>
<p>All the people that bought the stock at $50 hoping it&rsquo;ll go to $54</p>
<p>would all of a sudden lose a lot of money because the stock would instead be at $34.</p>
<p>So the fact that the stock basically didn&rsquo;t move is essentially the market&rsquo;s way of voting.</p>
<p>This is a head fake.</p>
<p>You should take the offer.</p>
<p>The board&rsquo;s not going to and the stock&rsquo;s going to tank back to its other its original price.</p>
<p>My prediction is the board tries to fight it.</p>
<p>Stock collapses.</p>
<p>Nobody thinks it&rsquo;s going to get done.</p>
<p>Elon lowers his offer.</p>
<p>And he wins it by the end of the year.</p>
<p>And gives him a lower offer.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Always with the optimizer.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going 49.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very Michael Corleone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now the offer&rsquo;s 49.</p>
<p>And it goes down $2 every quarter until you guys acquiesce.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trading at 30.</p>
<p>I lower my offer.</p>
<p>Jason, if you want to just finish with this little quote of the Revlon story,</p>
<p>it was actually kind of cool.</p>
<p>Forsman Little comes in to try to basically give like a white knight bid.</p>
<p>And what Ronald Perlman did was basically say, I&rsquo;m just going to, you know, top tick every bid.</p>
<p>He was pretty baller.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m going to top tick every bid.</p>
<p>So Forsman would be at 51.</p>
<p>And then, you know, Perlman would be at 51.50.</p>
<p>They would go to 54, 55, you know.</p>
<p>And he exhausted Forsman Little.</p>
<p>And eventually they just threw their hands up.</p>
<p>They said, we can&rsquo;t do this anymore.</p>
<p>I want to make a couple of movie recommendations real quick.</p>
<p>Because I tweeted a couple of things.</p>
<p>Barbarians at the gate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Barbarians at the gate and Wall Street.</p>
<p>And, you know, I tweet these things and they get no likes.</p>
<p>So I think people just don&rsquo;t watch old movies.</p>
<p>These movies came out, they came out in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Wall Street is one of the all-time great movies.</p>
<p>All-time greats.</p>
<p>Probably the best movie a business has ever been made.</p>
<p>Oliver Stone directed it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying Wall Street is, yes.</p>
<p>Wall Street is.</p>
<p>Margin Call was pretty good.</p>
<p>I really like Margin Call, but yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>Barbarians at the gate was.</p>
<p>Better book, better book.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a TV movie with James Gardner.</p>
<p>It was good.</p>
<p>The book is excellent.</p>
<p>The book is excellent.</p>
<p>Next level.</p>
<p>I gotta go eat lunch.</p>
<p>All right, everybody.</p>
<p>Love you besties.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Back at you.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, we decided to split this epic episode into two parts.</p>
<p>One, two parts.</p>
<p>So we can get you all the Elon Twitter discussion out as soon as possible for your Friday night</p>
<p>viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for episode 76.5.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part two, coming out in just a few hours.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about the global food crisis, China&rsquo;s plan for food storage, geopolitics,</p>
<p>including the French election.</p>
<p>And we got a bunch of all in summit talk.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s heating up.</p>
<p>So stick with us.</p>
<p>This is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What about beef?</p>
<p>What about beef?</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
