Hello?
Sax.
Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll be ready in like two minutes.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go.
Splash some water on your face.
Take a couple of whatever you need, some and let&amp;rsquo;s go.
We&amp;rsquo;re waiting.
Okay.
Hurry up.
It&amp;rsquo;s your chance to get max airtime.
Listen, free birds out.
That means you&amp;rsquo;re going to get by default 33.3% of airtime.
It&amp;rsquo;s going to be your biggest week ever.
Fly.'>

    <p>Pick up your phone, dipshit.</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Sax.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll be ready in like two minutes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Splash some water on your face.</p>
<p>Take a couple of whatever you need, some and let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re waiting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hurry up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your chance to get max airtime.</p>
<p>Listen, free birds out.</p>
<p>That means you&rsquo;re going to get by default 33.3% of airtime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be your biggest week ever.</p>
<p>Fly.</p>
<p>Rain Man.</p>
<p>David Sax.</p>
<p>Hey everybody.</p>
<p>Hey everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to another episode of the all in podcast with us today the dictator himself, Chama Okay,</p>
<p>Papatia and the rain man, David Sax.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jay cow, and the queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>Quit the show.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not here.</p>
<p>He quit the show.</p>
<p>I think I think he quit.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re looking for a science person.</p>
<p>If you know anybody, email all science guy at the all in podcast calm if you want to</p>
<p>apply for the science position here.</p>
<p>No, he couldn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>He was moving.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s moving.</p>
<p>Yes, we can say that without invading his privacy, but he&rsquo;s not going to be able to</p>
<p>do a show anyway, because there&rsquo;s so much going on.</p>
<p>And I think we should start with this.</p>
<p>Do we want to start with the COVID stuff again for the third episode in a row?</p>
<p>Or do you want to start with China and then back into COVID?</p>
<p>Oh, fuck COVID.</p>
<p>I think we should just do COVID quickly.</p>
<p>Because I think, you know, as much as the audience complained about it, we got a lot</p>
<p>of comments saying, Why are you talking about COVID so much, we were ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m predicting this whole new delta wave.</p>
<p>You know, we told people what was coming.</p>
<p>I think it was a useful service.</p>
<p>So people might not want to hear it.</p>
<p>But it was, I think, I would say, we&rsquo;re probably two weeks ahead of the</p>
<p>it was very impressive.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;ve gotten a couple things actually right the a couple weeks ahead of</p>
<p>other people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, it was pretty obvious that this was going to race through the places</p>
<p>that had low vaccination.</p>
<p>And having the breakthrough cases is I don&rsquo;t think anybody anticipated that.</p>
<p>And the thing we didn&rsquo;t Yeah, over the last week on Twitter, I&rsquo;m seeing this big debate</p>
<p>on whether vaccinated people can spread the Delta variant.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, guys, didn&rsquo;t you see the show two weeks ago, we covered this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got it.</p>
<p>I was vaccinated.</p>
<p>I got it from someone who was vaccinated.</p>
<p>This is no, you know, the Delta variant has slipped the vaccine.</p>
<p>It still prevents the most serious cases, generally speaking, we need to see it as a</p>
<p>spectrum of protection, rather than completely binary.</p>
<p>But yeah, absolutely, you can get it and pass it on if you&rsquo;re vaccinated.</p>
<p>Like we know that and we said we told the audience that three weeks ago.</p>
<p>The other thing we predicted was, you know, that this is going to be incredibly disruptive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to create another debate of lock and potential lockdowns and mask mandates.</p>
<p>And most of all, we discussed and we you know, we had a I think a pretty vibrant debate between</p>
<p>all of us about under what circumstances does your decision to not get vaccinated impact</p>
<p>everybody else vis a vis the petri dish of the next variant that&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Hopefully that&rsquo;ll be less deadly, less contagious, which is tends to be how these things go.</p>
<p>But we also predicted some people are just going to start requiring vaccines, vaccine</p>
<p>cards. And we mentioned what&rsquo;s happening in France.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what examples you&rsquo;ve seen this week.</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought last week when you made vaccine passports, the main issue, I thought, well,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put it this way. I think that was actually turned out to be great moderation, because</p>
<p>what has been the big issue all over the world since the last episode, vaccine passports,</p>
<p>you saw it with Naftali Bennett in Israel, they are not taking any of this vaccine</p>
<p>hesitancy. There&rsquo;s 9 million people in that country, 8 million are vaccinated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re telling the last million, you got to go get vaccinated.</p>
<p>He has laid down the law saying enough is enough.</p>
<p>A billion people have gotten vaccinated.</p>
<p>It works. And for the last million of you who haven&rsquo;t gotten vaccinated, if you want</p>
<p>to attend any function with more than 100 people, if you want to go to synagogue, if</p>
<p>you want to go to a sports game, if you want to go to the mall, you have to be vaccinated</p>
<p>or you are going to get tested that day at your own expense.</p>
<p>Everywhere you go, it&rsquo;s going to be so they&rsquo;re going to make it a real pain in the ass until</p>
<p>you get vaccinated. You then separately had Roger Goodell basically doing the same thing</p>
<p>in the NFL, saying to players, you know, first of all, all the coaches have to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>There was an anti-vax coach who got fired and then they don&rsquo;t have as much power with</p>
<p>the players because the players have a union.</p>
<p>But Goodell said to them, listen, if you don&rsquo;t get vaccinated, you&rsquo;re going to get tested</p>
<p>every day that you go to work.</p>
<p>And if the team if there&rsquo;s an outbreak on the team and you guys miss a game, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to lose all of your salary.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to put up with apparently there&rsquo;s a game last year during the during</p>
<p>covid where it was a Ravens Steelers game.</p>
<p>And half of the one of those teams, the Ravens, half of the first string was out with</p>
<p>covid or they were in isolation protocol because they&rsquo;re around players.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you&rsquo;re in a locker room, one player gets everyone&rsquo;s going to be exposed.</p>
<p>Right. So it turned out to be like one of the worst games that the NFL put on last year</p>
<p>and Goodell saying we&rsquo;re not going to put out product like that anymore.</p>
<p>If you are the reason why the team misses a game, guess what?</p>
<p>You and all of your teammates are going to lose your salary.</p>
<p>And since there&rsquo;s only 17 games in NFL season, you&rsquo;re talking about real, real money.</p>
<p>So you had Goodell doing that.</p>
<p>And now you have Facebook and Google basically coming out saying in order to go back to</p>
<p>the office, you have to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a little bit of the soft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of more of the iron fist beneath the velvet glove because they are offering</p>
<p>testing. So if you don&rsquo;t get vaccinated, you can get a test every time you go to the</p>
<p>office. But unlike Israel, which is making you pay for it, you know, Facebook and Google</p>
<p>are so rich they&rsquo;re going to pay for it.</p>
<p>So basically what you&rsquo;re seeing here is that government is not in the U.S.</p>
<p>Biden is going to mandate federal workers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you have to get tested weekly.</p>
<p>This is beyond now debatable.</p>
<p>I think the funny thing is the Republicans, I think somewhere along the way, realized,</p>
<p>oh, my God, we&rsquo;re going to lose the midterm elections.</p>
<p>They have found a way to find a single modality and behavior to steal defeat from the jaws</p>
<p>of victory. You know, I think that the Republicans were probably trending to basically win</p>
<p>back the house. And now I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And you have a bunch of these red state governors who are literally flipping their shit</p>
<p>right now trying to figure out how to get their folks vaccinated.</p>
<p>Many of these people may not even be able to vote come midterms because they&rsquo;re either</p>
<p>going to be dead or still sick.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve learned a lot.</p>
<p>And at this point, you&rsquo;re being left with folks there again.</p>
<p>There are people who do it for religious reasons.</p>
<p>I get it. There are people that, you know, are going to sort of like live off the grid</p>
<p>and live by themselves. I get them, too.</p>
<p>But the folks that want to be a tax on the system or use public resources, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand. And they&rsquo;re basically going to get singled out and discriminated against.</p>
<p>And the carrot and the stick method here, I think, is going to work because we saw a</p>
<p>bunch of people sign up to get vaccinated in France once they said, listen, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go to a cafe or a bar.</p>
<p>And I think that a lot of the people who are not vaccinated are probably enjoying going</p>
<p>out and having a life.</p>
<p>Danny Meyer, the restaurateur in New York from Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern,</p>
<p>one of the most famous restaurateurs of all time, announced on CNBC this morning that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll be requiring vaccines for all staff and customers.</p>
<p>What do we think of that restaurant saying you&rsquo;ve got to show a Vaxcar on the way?</p>
<p>And if I love it, listen to me, if I&rsquo;m going to go in and I&rsquo;m going to spend two or</p>
<p>$3,000 on wine and then a couple thousand bucks on a tip, I don&rsquo;t want some asshole</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to get me sick there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that I still may get sick.</p>
<p>And by the way, Danny Myers restaurants are not like, you know, fucking, you know, Red</p>
<p>Robin. These are extremely high places.</p>
<p>The idea that you can get a communicable respiratory disease and spend $5,000 is</p>
<p>untenable, untenable, nonstarter.</p>
<p>Saks, I mean, listen, you you&rsquo;ve you very interesting last episode.</p>
<p>I felt like you were really trying to balance your belief in freedom and people being</p>
<p>able to make decisions themselves with, you know, the reality that we can&rsquo;t be close</p>
<p>forever. How has the last week changed your thinking and what do you think of the Danny</p>
<p>Meyer? I like what Danny Meyer did in this sense.</p>
<p>He wants to create a certain experience for his clientele, and he knows that his</p>
<p>clientele are more likely to go dine in his restaurants if there is a vaccine policy at</p>
<p>his restaurants. He&rsquo;s not saying a policy for the whole country.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s setting it for his establishment.</p>
<p>He has every right to be able to do that, and he believes that will help his bottom</p>
<p>line. And he&rsquo;s probably right about that.</p>
<p>Similarly, Roger Goodell, same thing.</p>
<p>I mean, he took a tough line because he knows that if he wants the NFL to put out a great</p>
<p>product every week, they can&rsquo;t be canceling games because of covid outbreaks.</p>
<p>You know, they can&rsquo;t have the first string players out with covid.</p>
<p>So he made a smart business decision.</p>
<p>I think people should have the freedom, the right to do that.</p>
<p>Now, I still have, let&rsquo;s call it a reservation about government requiring it, not</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t see the benefit.</p>
<p>I definitely see the health benefit, but just because I don&rsquo;t like giving government the</p>
<p>power to stick a stick, a needle in your arm.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a government employee, I do think the government has added power.</p>
<p>We talked about this last week.</p>
<p>They can make it a job requirement.</p>
<p>And, you know, what&rsquo;s interesting in California, California said, if you&rsquo;re a state</p>
<p>employee, you got to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>But the one group they singled out were the teachers, because, you know, Gavin Newsom</p>
<p>has no guts to stand up the teachers union whatsoever.</p>
<p>And I find it so ironic that early in the pandemic, we had this big debate about</p>
<p>whether the teachers would go back to school in the fall.</p>
<p>And the teachers union said we won&rsquo;t go back unless we&rsquo;re first in line for the</p>
<p>vaccine. Well, guess what?</p>
<p>They got that. Now they&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re not going to go back if you make us get</p>
<p>vaccinated. I mean, you can&rsquo;t win with moving the goalposts.</p>
<p>I mean, people in the goalposts, they want to work from home.</p>
<p>They it&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one group that needs to do it most.</p>
<p>And they should be the one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the army and teachers and health care workers.</p>
<p>They should be given a mandate.</p>
<p>If you want this job, you must be vaccinated.</p>
<p>You cannot be in the army and the military and not be vaccinated because we need you</p>
<p>in close quarters on a helicopter to go whack Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t have a COVID outbreak in the Navy SEALs when we</p>
<p>got to go. I&rsquo;m OK with that.</p>
<p>I think I think every employer has the right to require it if they believe it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>impact job performance. Now, I want to go back to the point that you made about the</p>
<p>midterm elections. I because I there&rsquo;s a part I agree with and a part I disagree</p>
<p>with. So the part I agree with is that the Republicans were cruising</p>
<p>to, you know, a midterm shellacking.</p>
<p>And now the the whole vaccine hesitancy</p>
<p>issue, I think there was a prospect of that causing damage</p>
<p>to the Republicans, not because most Republicans are vaccine</p>
<p>hesitant, but rather because Republican politicians were not out front</p>
<p>enough on getting vaccines. But look, there&rsquo;s a difference between reality and</p>
<p>perception. Here&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>Every single Republican governor, every single one has been vaccinated</p>
<p>and has supported the vaccine.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell is vaccinated, supports the vaccine.</p>
<p>Kevin McCarthy put out a statement.</p>
<p>You even have the House minority whip, Scalise, get vaccinated</p>
<p>on on live TV.</p>
<p>Why had he not been vaccinated? Because he already had COVID and he didn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>think he needed it, but he got the vaccine anyway to basically double down.</p>
<p>You had Sarah Huckabee Sanders come out and say that she was getting the</p>
<p>Trump. She called it the Trump vaccine.</p>
<p>Yes, please. If they put the Trump logo on it.</p>
<p>Right. I mean, she understands, right?</p>
<p>Like this is probably, you know, Operation Lightspeed or</p>
<p>Warp Speed or whatever was probably the biggest operation operation.</p>
<p>Fuck up the midterms. That&rsquo;s what the Republicans should call this.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, so look, I mean, the Republican politicians in the main</p>
<p>support vaccines. The problem is that they were being a little bit too quiet</p>
<p>about it. As a result of that, you have the fringe people, the Marjorie Taylor</p>
<p>Greene&rsquo;s and so forth.</p>
<p>They were occupying too much airspace around this issue.</p>
<p>And, you know, frankly, you know, right now, I think that I think the Democrats</p>
<p>are going to keep those.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t actually go that far, but because I think that</p>
<p>I think the Republican problem was not that their vaccine has done, but rather</p>
<p>that they were just being a little too quiet about it.</p>
<p>But now I think that&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>I mean, there is not a single major Republican politician</p>
<p>who isn&rsquo;t strongly in favor of vaccine.</p>
<p>If the Republicans can get their actual act together and actually get these,</p>
<p>you know, Jason does joke about it, but I do think he&rsquo;s right in a certain way.</p>
<p>Basically, like this, this group of Republicans largely</p>
<p>who refuse to get vaccinated, then they may be able to pull something out.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s going to have to require a little bit of backtracking</p>
<p>and showing up, as you said, by the mainstream Republican political groups.</p>
<p>And they just have not done a good job.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a really simple offering for them.</p>
<p>New information, new strain, new approach.</p>
<p>Listen, we didn&rsquo;t anticipate Delta would happen.</p>
<p>This is 10 times.</p>
<p>Yeah, it allows people to save face.</p>
<p>Basically, they can save face.</p>
<p>You got a perfect offer.</p>
<p>Listen, there&rsquo;s new information here.</p>
<p>This thing is even the CDC hasn&rsquo;t officially changed their policy yet.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s coming right.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve always been behind the curve.</p>
<p>We predicted the policy change on the show</p>
<p>anywhere from two weeks to two months before they actually do it.</p>
<p>But look on the vaccine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t discern a difference in position</p>
<p>on the vaccine itself between Republican governors and Democratic governors.</p>
<p>They both are advocating it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both allowing private organizations to require it.</p>
<p>But none of them, to my knowledge, have either had the guts</p>
<p>or the temerity, however you want to see it, to actually require it.</p>
<p>Oh, I love that word.</p>
<p>Temerity, temerity, not really used, not used enough.</p>
<p>And just putting a cap on this before we move on to what&rsquo;s going on in China.</p>
<p>We talked about implementing this.</p>
<p>And how do you implement it?</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t need to have a national registry.</p>
<p>People have vaccine cards.</p>
<p>You bring your vaccine card, you show it.</p>
<p>And then, of course, people go to, well, what happens if you create a fact?</p>
<p>Can anybody create a fake vaccine card?</p>
<p>Yes, of course you can.</p>
<p>But the FBI has put out</p>
<p>a statement now because of Lollapalooza, the music festival.</p>
<p>They are saying do not buy a fake vaccine card,</p>
<p>because if you want to have no mask at Lollapalooza,</p>
<p>you have to show your vaccine card.</p>
<p>And they said the FBI is tweeting about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s illegal. It endangers yourself and those around you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a federal crime that could lead to hefty fines or prison time.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Yeah.</p>
<p>So show us your papers.</p>
<p>Just get the vaccine and just get the vaccine, folks.</p>
<p>Why are we still dealing with this?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. It&rsquo;s quickly becoming a Darwin award.</p>
<p>This is quickly moving into Darwin award territory.</p>
<p>We are. I talked to my doctor and I was like, I want to get the Moderna or J&amp;J.</p>
<p>Which one should I get?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, you got the Pfizer already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I want to take a second.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s going to make a difference.</p>
<p>I was like, I think it&rsquo;s totally going to make a difference.</p>
<p>This is like when we got off the pod last week.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, yeah, I was like, well, just give me the third shot of Pfizer then.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, that&rsquo;s not necessary either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s not necessary. I want it.</p>
<p>Give me the third shot of Pfizer.</p>
<p>And then I open up Drudge Report yesterday.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like third shot of vaccine of Pfizer in Israel or whatever.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just going to start giving people a third shot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just want to get ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>But by the way, there&rsquo;s one other piece of news that came out</p>
<p>that I think is very positive on COVID, which is the availability</p>
<p>of these oral antivirals, the pills.</p>
<p>That you can take when you get an early case of it.</p>
<p>Right. So it&rsquo;s like what they have for Tamiflu with the flu.</p>
<p>Like no one should ever die of the flu because Tamiflu is like completely</p>
<p>effective at stopping it, provided you take Tamiflu early in the case.</p>
<p>So I think that, you know, with the reduced effectiveness of vaccine,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re going to have to do is supplement the vaccines and the boosters</p>
<p>with home testing and then, you know, these oral antivirals</p>
<p>so that you get you take a test, you discover you got COVID</p>
<p>and you immediately get prescribed, you know, one of these these pills.</p>
<p>And the pharma companies are coming out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like three different pharma companies coming out with these oral</p>
<p>and antivirals.</p>
<p>And if Freeberg were here, he could tell us all about it.</p>
<p>Freeberg, explain the science behind this.</p>
<p>You know what? The science can go fuck itself.</p>
<p>Hey, Danny Meyer, chill a great bottle of white burgundy because I&rsquo;m coming, baby.</p>
<p>Vaccinated.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go, baby.</p>
<p>Vaxxed and ready to go.</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The China situation has been perplexing to me.</p>
<p>You know, my position was always be careful</p>
<p>working in China or investing in China or investing in Chinese companies</p>
<p>because they could change the rules at any time and change the rules</p>
<p>they have in the past year.</p>
<p>We talked about, obviously, and financial and Jack Ma going MIA</p>
<p>ByteDance, a CEO and founder,</p>
<p>stepping down as CEO amid Chinese regulations and all the scrutiny.</p>
<p>And then we have Didi last week.</p>
<p>Being pulled from the App Store in an unprecedented penalty</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not allowed to download Didi and the existing users can use it.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, all the educational companies this week</p>
<p>were told that they cannot operate as for profit companies.</p>
<p>And these companies have gone public in Hong Kong and in the West.</p>
<p>And this has caused such an acute effect.</p>
<p>SoftBank is clearing a bunch of its Uber position</p>
<p>to cover their losses in Didi.</p>
<p>And then there is the story of Larry Chen, who is a Chinese education entrepreneur.</p>
<p>He was worth 15 billion in January.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s lost 99% of his net worth, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>He founded Gautu Teichido or Teichido, which is a Chinese online tutoring firm.</p>
<p>As we know, education is huge in China.</p>
<p>That company, Gautu, peaked at $142 a share in January</p>
<p>and has fallen to $3 a share.</p>
<p>Big sordid story there.</p>
<p>Tencent lost 100 billion in market cap in three days earlier this week</p>
<p>as China cracked down on what they call the monopoly in music rights.</p>
<p>So while we debate what happens with the monopolies here in the United States,</p>
<p>China just literally told them, and here&rsquo;s the quote from the BBC article,</p>
<p>the company and its affiliated businesses have been told that they can no longer</p>
<p>engage in exclusive deals over music rights</p>
<p>and must dissolve any existing agreements within 30 days.</p>
<p>I mean, this would be like Biden just saying,</p>
<p>the app store is now open, you have to let other app stores in Apple or,</p>
<p>you know, just coming down and saying to Amazon,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t sell Amazon Basics anymore in 30 days,</p>
<p>no more Amazon Basics at the site.</p>
<p>What do you think the end game is here?</p>
<p>Is this a because China seems like they are very deliberate,</p>
<p>and they plan in centuries, what is happening here?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the short term and the long term.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s happening in the short term is that the same thing that we are</p>
<p>talking about in the United States that sacks is, you know, very eloquently,</p>
<p>basically, I think, led most everybody in just really framing for a lot of people</p>
<p>is this idea that, you know, we have privatized free speech,</p>
<p>and we have put the distribution of information</p>
<p>into the hands of three or four founder CEO oligarchs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also true in China.</p>
<p>And when you look under the hood of the major internet companies,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s four or five guys that are in charge.</p>
<p>And so I think that in the United States,</p>
<p>politicians feel increasingly uneasy with those folks having power</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s applied indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Trump gets banned, Trump may not get banned, this person gets distribution,</p>
<p>this article is considered misinformation,</p>
<p>that article is considered disinformation, this article is suppressed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dangerous place to be.</p>
<p>And in China, they were just like, enough is enough.</p>
<p>So I think the short term as it relates to the internet companies</p>
<p>was basically a realization that we are not going to allow</p>
<p>any more devolution of power from the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>to and into the hands of these internet entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>So that was sort of like the&hellip;</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a move out of fear.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re scared they&rsquo;re going to lose their power base.</p>
<p>Not scared.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re just smart.</p>
<p>And they were like, we&rsquo;re not going to allow this to happen.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t have to deal with Section 230 or any law like that.</p>
<p>I think it was just a realization that we want them to understand who is boss.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so there was a wave of resignations.</p>
<p>There was now all of this market cap upheaval.</p>
<p>And this is now where we get to sort of like the appetizer.</p>
<p>And I think in the appetizer, what they&rsquo;re basically saying is,</p>
<p>we will control how money is made and who makes money.</p>
<p>And I think that that sets up the really difficult thing that I think happens,</p>
<p>which is about the long term.</p>
<p>So in this thing, what&rsquo;s happening right now is China very firmly telling everybody,</p>
<p>we are firmly in control.</p>
<p>There is no private market.</p>
<p>And there is no capital market without our approval.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a really big statement.</p>
<p>And in fact, it was such a big statement that I think the Chinese security authorities and</p>
<p>had like a conference call with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, all these folks were invited.</p>
<p>And you know, the vice chairman, basically, his quote was something to the effect of,</p>
<p>we promise that any more changes will at least let you know,</p>
<p>not a there&rsquo;s nothing, nothing to see here, or there&rsquo;s nothing more to come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more that as we decide new rules, we&rsquo;ll make sure that we give you guys enough warning.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very much firmly saying, we know exactly how money is made,</p>
<p>we will decide who makes money in what way.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to make sure that, you know, all of this wealth creation</p>
<p>happens under terms that we define.</p>
<p>And I think that the setup for the long term, the long term in China is complicated.</p>
<p>It is an enormous demographic time bomb.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</p>
<p>By the end of 2100.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s population will shrink from 1.1 1.2 billion people down to about 700 million people.</p>
<p>So they had very progressive, quote, unquote, under their framework,</p>
<p>laws of one child policy to basically make it economically viable in the 60s and 70s.</p>
<p>There was such a number of people, those people were able to get great jobs in the, you know,</p>
<p>80s and 90s and 2000s.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;ve realized, oh, wow, we made a huge miscalculation,</p>
<p>because now there is just not enough people.</p>
<p>And so China is going to shrink.</p>
<p>And I think that honestly, I think Xi Jinping probably thinks the simplest way to solve this</p>
<p>is to basically nationalize a lot of the economy over time.</p>
<p>And so I, if I was a betting man, which I am general, but I&rsquo;m not in China,</p>
<p>because I just don&rsquo;t understand the market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super, it&rsquo;s a great casino.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stupid place to bet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to say that.</p>
<p>I just think that I don&rsquo;t know the market.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, they change the rules of the game.</p>
<p>Hold on, let me just finish what I was saying.</p>
<p>I think that what we&rsquo;re starting, what we&rsquo;re starting to see is the beginning</p>
<p>of nationalizations.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s going to start in technology universe, because those are the critical assets</p>
<p>that the Chinese need to own for the future.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, in my opinion, what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>And, yeah,</p>
<p>Saks, when you look at this, we&rsquo;ve been talking about, you know, this, these two great competitors,</p>
<p>America and China, and who&rsquo;s going to win?</p>
<p>How does China win?</p>
<p>If this would seem not having a vibrant entrepreneurial, you know, socialist,</p>
<p>communist hybrid, is this the end of that experiment?</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s just going to go all national.</p>
<p>And then doesn&rsquo;t that make it easier for the West to win if China is just going to say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to, we&rsquo;re going to operate everything.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t have a competition of ideas.</p>
<p>If they go that far, I think it&rsquo;s really interesting, actually, to compare what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening in China with what&rsquo;s happening on the US, in the US, because on the surface,</p>
<p>both countries are having this debate about whether big tech needs to be reined in,</p>
<p>broken up, controlled.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having that debate in the US.</p>
<p>And obviously, they&rsquo;re having some version of it in China.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a little bit like the civil rights debate, right?</p>
<p>Where, you know, we have our civil rights issue in the US.</p>
<p>And, you know, they have Shenzhen, you know, they have the Uyghurs, you know, it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a whole order of magnitude different in terms of the way they react.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s, I would say there&rsquo;s three main differences here between the Chinese</p>
<p>approach and the US approach.</p>
<p>Number one, data privacy.</p>
<p>We have a concept of separation between private companies and the data they control, and the</p>
<p>data that the US government can get its hands on.</p>
<p>And the US government typically has to get a warrant and go through a court proceeding</p>
<p>to get that data.</p>
<p>What China is doing, they&rsquo;ve now passed a law, basically saying all these companies,</p>
<p>your data belongs to us.</p>
<p>If we want it, we get it, they&rsquo;re taking operational control over the data, and you</p>
<p>know, they&rsquo;re going to use it.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>Number two, I think that China seems to be really worried about these big tech companies,</p>
<p>not just in terms of whether they might engage in anti-competitive practices or consumer</p>
<p>harm, sort of those conventional antitrust concepts in the United States.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re concerned about these big tech moguls becoming power centers in China.</p>
<p>And you saw this with Jack Ma, right?</p>
<p>I mean, clearly, the CCP had a problem with the way that Jack Ma had become a figure,</p>
<p>that people rallied around him, they looked at him, they cared about what he had to say.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, yes, the ant IPO was put on hold, but it was more than that, right?</p>
<p>You know, this was not just like, you know, what the SEC would have done.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Jack Ma disappears.</p>
<p>He goes into some sort of house arrest.</p>
<p>He comes out three months later, looking kind of emaciated.</p>
<p>You know, they are putting the fear of God in, you know, these big tech moguls in a way</p>
<p>that we would never do in the US.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I don&rsquo;t want Tim Cook to engage in anti-competitive practices.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t want anything bad happening to Tim Cook.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the guy should be under house arrest.</p>
<p>If he wants to donate his money to political causes and speak out as a private citizen,</p>
<p>he has every right to do that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll defend his right to do that no matter, you know, how much I want, you know, Apple to</p>
<p>be reined in.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have that, again, that separate concept in China.</p>
<p>And I think the last thing that&rsquo;s going on here that&rsquo;s different is you saw China put</p>
<p>the kibosh on.</p>
<p>There were 34 IPOs of major Chinese tech companies that were scheduled to IPO in US markets.</p>
<p>And they have sort of shut that pipeline down.</p>
<p>And what it appears to be, they appear to be saying is that, you know, we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about reshoring strategic industries back to the US, like pharmaceutical manufacturing.</p>
<p>They seem to be saying we are going to reshore the IPO business.</p>
<p>We do not want you, big Chinese tech companies, IPOing on American markets, on American exchanges.</p>
<p>We are bringing that business back to China.</p>
<p>And that is why I think you&rsquo;re seeing, you know, giant ripple effects now.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, to Chamath&rsquo;s point about decoupling, we now, it looks like, are going</p>
<p>to be decoupling our financial markets.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re seeing, you know, gigantic hits to the valuation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, would you, would you agree with me that the decoupling of these financial</p>
<p>markets might be in the best interest of humanity, and ultimately, the decoupling of these two</p>
<p>economies, if we don&rsquo;t see eye to eye about human rights, and how to treat people, maybe</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good that we have a little more distance between the two markets.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to know if engagement is the better process.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the Chinese Communist Party wants to have anything to do with democracy,</p>
<p>anything to do with free markets, they want to control all the markets.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you could see, but you know, in a way, the product that the US was exporting</p>
<p>to China was, was our financial markets.</p>
<p>And not in, I think, a good way, right.</p>
<p>So that I think the bad version of this is when China is able to buy up ownership in</p>
<p>critical strategic centers in the US, and that affects people&rsquo;s speech rights over here.</p>
<p>But this is not China, buying up ownership in the US.</p>
<p>This was China acting as a consumer of US financial markets.</p>
<p>And, and I think, I think it&rsquo;s different, right?</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re selling products over there, that helps correct our trade balance, right?</p>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t have a problem with Elon selling cars over in China, he&rsquo;s helping our</p>
<p>trade balance.</p>
<p>Okay, but so but they&rsquo;re kind of canceling that they&rsquo;re kind of saying we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>this industry, we want to have a domestic, you know,</p>
<p>this is creating a mono economy, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s going to blur the lines between public and private ownership.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to basically make it one huge pot from which the Chinese government</p>
<p>can can take and put it back into as it deems fit for the broader success of China as a whole.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re a CEO, and they don&rsquo;t like you, you&rsquo;re going to resign, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a company, and they&rsquo;re worried about your propensity to be a little too frisky on</p>
<p>your own, they&rsquo;ll reign you in the law, they use cybersecurity law or something else.</p>
<p>But the point is that I think that we shouldn&rsquo;t take this as free market regulators having</p>
<p>their way.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t Lena Khan implementing, you know, some laws, this is a top down decision to</p>
<p>nationalize large parts of the economy, starting with technology.</p>
<p>And I know that for some people that may seem unfathomable.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m a betting man, which I am, that&rsquo;s what I would bet on that this is the beginning</p>
<p>of the beginning of an attempt to pull these companies in.</p>
<p>I mean, at the at what David said is true.</p>
<p>The Chinese government owns the data of Chinese companies.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, the Chinese government also owns the users,</p>
<p>and it also owns the revenues.</p>
<p>It just hasn&rsquo;t told you yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, in a way, it&rsquo;s like the Chinese government in our government is trying to</p>
<p>officiate the game fairly and create a really competitive, vibrant game.</p>
<p>And I think what the Chinese government just said is the game&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Like there is no game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s a game.</p>
<p>It just has, it just has one because it has an uber CEO, it made a bunch of CEOs,</p>
<p>general managers in a large corporation that report through a reporting chain to one person.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no more game in terms of building companies and investing in China.</p>
<p>Like, how is the West ever going to trust?</p>
<p>How is Goldman Sachs or Sequoia, you know, launching a venture firm there or</p>
<p>retail investors or hedge fund investors?</p>
<p>How are they ever going to want to participate in that market?</p>
<p>Because so look, for example, when you invest in China, right, or if you set up a fund,</p>
<p>you know, there are two pools of capital, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the local renminbi denominated investment vehicles.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the US dollar denominated investment vehicles.</p>
<p>And they do that to segregate where the capital comes from.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not too difficult for the Chinese government to basically say, you know what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to actually make a constraint on dollar inflows so that, you know,</p>
<p>the renminbi denominated investment funds that are from Chinese investors into Chinese</p>
<p>companies needs to be above a certain percentage, call it two thirds, right?</p>
<p>Or call it 80%.</p>
<p>They can make all these decisions, because these are all just rules that are completely</p>
<p>under the control.</p>
<p>So I think that people who don&rsquo;t think this is going to happen, are probably not looking</p>
<p>at the setup, the setup seems to be directing itself towards that outcome.</p>
<p>And by the way, it makes sense for what Xi Jinping wants to do.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not my question.</p>
<p>My question is, why would Masayoshi San or another entity ever invest in China?</p>
<p>Because you look through the risks, and you got completely enamored by the population</p>
<p>and the TAM.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying now is, why would they do it again?</p>
<p>Or are they not going to do it?</p>
<p>No, but there are there are boundary conditions, I would say that even before this, you would</p>
<p>have had to reconsider the population is shrinking.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different demand side pull that&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>Older people need different kinds of services than younger people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough younger people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many men, there&rsquo;s not enough women.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not enough couples, there&rsquo;s not that all of these demographic issues,</p>
<p>ultimately, will get reflected in the economic reality, which is that smart investors would</p>
<p>put money in China differently over time anyways.</p>
<p>But I think that this is a bigger thing, as David said, which is if that&rsquo;s coming to pass,</p>
<p>you want to control the pipes, because you want to control how that information is presented</p>
<p>to people, your citizens, so that they don&rsquo;t get pissed off.</p>
<p>And then you might as well just own the economy, own the business.</p>
<p>Anyway, I see this as being amazing for American tech companies, because I don&rsquo;t see who would</p>
<p>ever want to be an entrepreneur, whoever has a great idea and wants to pursue it in China.</p>
<p>Why would you do it?</p>
<p>No, I disagree with you.</p>
<p>And the reason I disagree with you is&hellip;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have access to their markets anyway, what company has access to their market?</p>
<p>The difference is young, smart Chinese people for decades have been staying in China,</p>
<p>in part because it was more, they could more relate culturally to Jack Ma than they could</p>
<p>to Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s just, I mean, that just makes sense.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And I understand that.</p>
<p>And then the second is, we, like a lot of, like, sorry, like the opposite of some other</p>
<p>Western countries that Canada closed our doors.</p>
<p>Why would the next Jack Ma start a company if they saw Jack Ma disappear?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my question.</p>
<p>Because you know what, if you&rsquo;re coming from China, and you can you can only make a billion</p>
<p>versus 45 billion, I think you still take the shot.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think J Cal is right.</p>
<p>In the sense, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be like a binary decision, where all of a sudden,</p>
<p>everyone just stops doing business in China, but they&rsquo;re gonna be hedging their bets.</p>
<p>I mean, if you were a Chinese billionaire looking at this landscape,</p>
<p>your, your, your priority has got to be to get some wealth outside the country beyond</p>
<p>the control of the CCP, you&rsquo;re gonna be buying Bitcoin, you&rsquo;re gonna be trying to get your</p>
<p>money overseas, you have got to be very nervous about what&rsquo;s happening in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I think what President Xi is doing is fundamentally redefining the bargain</p>
<p>between Chinese entrepreneurs and the government.</p>
<p>And here was the original bargain, right?</p>
<p>The great Chinese leader and economic reformer Deng Xiaoping basically set the bargain, you</p>
<p>know, 40 years ago, and what basically the bargain was this, we&rsquo;re going to open up the</p>
<p>economy and let you the entrepreneur get rich, we&rsquo;re going to keep all the political power.</p>
<p>So as long as you don&rsquo;t mess with us politically, you can get as rich as you want.</p>
<p>That was the original bargain.</p>
<p>Now President Xi is saying there&rsquo;s a new bargain, there&rsquo;s a new boss in town.</p>
<p>And here is the deal.</p>
<p>That economic interest in China will be subordinate to national interest.</p>
<p>Those national interests are defined by the CCP.</p>
<p>And I run the CCP for life.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that is what is happening.</p>
<p>And that is a big change.</p>
<p>They just got layered.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new CEO that they report to.</p>
<p>This actually makes me very hopeful.</p>
<p>Actually, I think this is going to be like a spiraling down of their economy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to spiral up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s going to invest in their economy?</p>
<p>Everybody, guess what?</p>
<p>Because if you want a shred of fucking lithium, if you want a battery, if you want nickel,</p>
<p>if you want anything to happen, you need to work with China.</p>
<p>They are incredibly smart and thoughtful.</p>
<p>They had been strategic.</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;ve been running around, you know, complaining, crying,</p>
<p>talking about the kindergarten soccer game.</p>
<p>They were doing the hard work.</p>
<p>They were doing it for decades.</p>
<p>And until we find solutions that can work around them, we need to work with them.</p>
<p>I think they just throttled innovation and they just shot themselves in both feet.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re going to regret this decision.</p>
<p>I would come out in the middle and say they&rsquo;ve just attached a discount rate that now every</p>
<p>investor has to consider political risk when they invest in China, because the future is</p>
<p>very uncertain.</p>
<p>The bargain is getting changed.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re an investor, you now have to take you&rsquo;re taking some</p>
<p>huge risk.</p>
<p>I agree with David.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a better way.</p>
<p>I would refine what I&rsquo;m saying by saying it&rsquo;s a distribution of risk where it&rsquo;s closer to</p>
<p>Russia now than it is to the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then I think there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s literally an act called the McGinskey Act.</p>
<p>McGinskey Act.</p>
<p>What is the act that Bill Broder&rsquo;s lawyer McGinskey?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Because basically, in Russia, they were just killing people and taking their businesses.</p>
<p>I mean, this feels like the equivalent in China.</p>
<p>I mean, literally, that was Bill Broder&rsquo;s lawyer who was tortured to death.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t see anybody wanting to invest there anymore.</p>
<p>And it just does make the Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it does look like they shut down Bitcoin a couple of months before making</p>
<p>these actions.</p>
<p>So your point, David, they probably anticipated that people would start shipping their money</p>
<p>out using Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And so they banned Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re banning CEOs from having too much power.</p>
<p>That was probably a sequential event.</p>
<p>That would be very smart on their part.</p>
<p>You know, can&rsquo;t leave.</p>
<p>Very smart.</p>
<p>What does this do to like, the Sequoia Capital, China, the Masayoshi San investing heavily</p>
<p>there, Tencent investing here.</p>
<p>All the Chinese have been very active in the United States investing in companies.</p>
<p>All the Chinese LPs are fine.</p>
<p>All the Chinese GPs are fine.</p>
<p>All the Chinese companies are fine.</p>
<p>I think David&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a discount factor.</p>
<p>I do think it affects global dollar flows.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s hard for a Western capital pool to allocate money to China without doing</p>
<p>a little bit more work and applying a higher discount rate.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to believe that the conversations happening in these firms that have made gobs</p>
<p>of money in China over the last couple of decades, it has to be are we living on borrowed</p>
<p>time?</p>
<p>How much more time do we have before China says that Chinese profits, Chinese return</p>
<p>on investment are going to go to Chinese individuals and companies under our control?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the direction it all seems to be headed.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And how quickly can I get out of these positions?</p>
<p>I mean, how do you even get out of these positions?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re going to reverse some IPOs, how does that mechanically happen?</p>
<p>Are they going to just say it&rsquo;s a buyout?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a second second transaction, and they&rsquo;ll just do like a buyout.</p>
<p>So if Masayoshi-san owns some amount of DD, they say, here&rsquo;s the price per share that</p>
<p>we pay you.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your cash.</p>
<p>Give us a share.</p>
<p>Ciao.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>A forced sale at whatever price they determine.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I mean, like, I think these things will operate more efficiently than that, because you have</p>
<p>a distributed shareholder base.</p>
<p>So, you know, China can&rsquo;t force a shareholder DD to sell the shares because it&rsquo;s listed</p>
<p>in an American stock exchange.</p>
<p>But if DD does go private, the way that the news reports are saying, somebody&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to have to backstop that capital.</p>
<p>I suspect it&rsquo;ll be a Chinese organization.</p>
<p>So they will take DD private again, and then buy out all of the shareholders who bought</p>
<p>from around the world.</p>
<p>By the way, if that does come to pass, I think that is an obvious signal that we&rsquo;re moving</p>
<p>into sort of a more nationalization of critical resources.</p>
<p>And China has determined that internet resources are critical.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If I was in their shoes, that&rsquo;s exactly what I would do as well.</p>
<p>Does this mean that we should be kicking out Chinese companies from operating in the US,</p>
<p>i.e. TikTok, etc?</p>
<p>No, but I do think that TikTok needs to get carved out of ByteDance and it needs to have</p>
<p>a completely American cap table.</p>
<p>But that shouldn&rsquo;t be a government edict.</p>
<p>That should be something that the ByteDance investors and board are scrambling to do right</p>
<p>now, because otherwise, that equity value may go to zero.</p>
<p>ByteDance should be a half a trillion dollar company.</p>
<p>It probably is a couple hundred billion dollar company now, which means that it probably</p>
<p>lost half of its market value.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a few things for us to worry about there.</p>
<p>I mean, I like the idea of out competing China by having freer and more open capital markets</p>
<p>and allowing anyone in the world to invest in our companies.</p>
<p>I think the issues with TikTok are more around data.</p>
<p>We know now that any data that ByteDance has belongs to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a TikTok issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s any company, any US company that&rsquo;s doing business in China.</p>
<p>Look, it applies to Zoom.</p>
<p>OK, look, Zoom, we&rsquo;re on Zoom right now.</p>
<p>Zoom is not a Chinese company, but it has a giant engineering team in China.</p>
<p>What are the data implications for that?</p>
<p>Yeah, they stopped routing their servers.</p>
<p>Remember, they had some servers routing through China.</p>
<p>But I do think they&rsquo;re going to have to shut down and sell off whatever their assets are</p>
<p>in China.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be untenable to have a communication platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like Huawei, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t allow Huawei to operate.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to have to do that with software, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a big CRISPR breakthrough.</p>
<p>65-year-old man named Patrick Daugherty was suffering with a disease in which his protein</p>
<p>was misshapen, building up in his body, destroying important tissues, such as nerves in his hands</p>
<p>and feet.</p>
<p>He watched the same disease kill his dad.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the quote, had watched others get crippled and die difficult deaths from this</p>
<p>disease.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a terrible prognosis.</p>
<p>He entered a trial utilizing CRISPR, the gene editing tool, and researchers reported the</p>
<p>data indicating that the experiment treatment worked well.</p>
<p>The study Daugherty volunteered for is the first in which doctors are simply infusing</p>
<p>the gene editor directly into patients and letting it find its own way to the right gene</p>
<p>in the right cells, in this case, the cells in the liver, making the destructive protein</p>
<p>the advance is being held not just as not just for amyloidosis patients, but also as</p>
<p>a proof of concept that CRISPR could be used to treat many other much more common diseases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new way of using the innovative technology to my thoughts.</p>
<p>I think this is a really important breakthrough.</p>
<p>And what it allows us to do now is see a world where, look, if you if you think about the</p>
<p>two different paths of the following idea, you&rsquo;re going to make a solution to a problem.</p>
<p>If the problem was an internet company, or you wanted to make a product, what you would</p>
<p>do is you would go to Amazon Web Services, you&rsquo;d be able to consume a whole set of abstractions.</p>
<p>And then you would build a light amount of programming, which is essentially like the</p>
<p>application logic of your app, right?</p>
<p>I think a lot of people listening understand that idea, because that&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>Here, what we&rsquo;re getting to a place is now soon, we&rsquo;re going to be able to view</p>
<p>biological problems in the same way.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re building all these small little building, I don&rsquo;t want to call them small,</p>
<p>but building these very important building blocks, that is very much akin to the building</p>
<p>blocks we needed to put together the first set of computers to put together ms dos, all</p>
<p>of that allowed us to create Windows, Windows allowed us to actually access the internet.</p>
<p>And there was this in seriatim development of things that happened.</p>
<p>And I think that we&rsquo;re on the verge of that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what these kinds of breakthroughs really show us, which is that you can view</p>
<p>so for example, you know, in a different company, they they&rsquo;ve created these MRNA</p>
<p>gate arrays, logic gate arrays.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re, you know, a chip designer, you would understand how to basically create</p>
<p>electrical function, in part using, you know, gate arrays.</p>
<p>But if you reduce a biological function to the same idea, now that same person has a</p>
<p>translational ability to solve a different problem that they didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>So I think what we&rsquo;re saying is that we&rsquo;re seeing this platformization, this AWSification</p>
<p>of a biological tool chain, with things like CRISPR, and all of the other modalities that</p>
<p>need to stack on top of it, so that the next person can view it as a programming problem.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s the really exciting path that accelerates a lot of this development.</p>
<p>But this is an enormously important breakthrough, because it validated a lot of what CRISPR was</p>
<p>beyond a lot of theoretical innovation that that up until now was basically what it was</p>
<p>known for.</p>
<p>And a lot of investment had gone into companies that were trying to do things.</p>
<p>But this is the first really important one.</p>
<p>The funny thing about Intelli is that it&rsquo;s been public for like, seven, eight years,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just been toiling, toiling, toiling, toiling.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the last little while, obviously, it&rsquo;s gone absolutely crazy because</p>
<p>of this breakthrough.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in related news, CRISPR creates its first genetically modified marsupials</p>
<p>after years of using the gene editing technique, CRISPR to genetically modify everything from</p>
<p>vegetables to lab, rodents.</p>
<p>Researchers have used it to edit one of the hardest targets yet, marsupials, the MIT</p>
<p>technology reports.</p>
<p>I guess it turns out they&rsquo;re very hard to edit.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now editing marsupials and changing things like their hair color.</p>
<p>So brave new world.</p>
<p>Freeberg was here.</p>
<p>The Freeberg ratio would be off the charts.</p>
<p>Wrapping up, we have pretty incredible, just just one thing to add to that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think what it what it shows is that these COVID vaccines are just the first product,</p>
<p>the first breakthrough product of this mRNA technology, there&rsquo;s going to be a lot more.</p>
<p>And what I wonder about is, you know, this, this category of vaccine has some people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of like, you know, in the, in the technology world, you have kind of a spectrum</p>
<p>of early adopters, late adopters, Luddites, you know, people are actively against technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, Luddites are even laggards.</p>
<p>And yeah, yeah, Luddites are even more violently opposed.</p>
<p>I think the original Luddites, they, I think the original Luddites were in England, they</p>
<p>lost their jobs at some factory.</p>
<p>And so they broke into the factory with sledgehammers to destroy all the machines that replaced</p>
<p>their jobs.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s clearly a spectrum.</p>
<p>And what I wonder about is that if you&rsquo;re on sort of the Luddite end of the spectrum</p>
<p>with respect to biotechnology, I mean, are you going to have a materially worse life</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not getting the benefits of all these vaccines and all these treatments?</p>
<p>And I mean, COVID could just be the first example of this.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you build on it, it&rsquo;s sort of like we&rsquo;re going to create a two class</p>
<p>society, one that is not only dealing with all the maladies and cancers and living longer,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t even started to think about, well, taking somebody who&rsquo;s already in great</p>
<p>health, and what can you do for them?</p>
<p>So, oh, you know what, you can be two inches taller, you could add 10 IQ points, you could</p>
<p>run faster, you could have higher blood oxygen, whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, we could, we could genetically modify people to stay underwater for 10 minutes and</p>
<p>be, you know, better processors of oxygen, like other mammals are, you could have super</p>
<p>humans.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s basically where this is going.</p>
<p>And that unlocks a whole nother level of ethical and moral considerations.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, there could be a group of people who are like, I don&rsquo;t want to touch</p>
<p>any of this.</p>
<p>And they die at 60, 70, 80 years old.</p>
<p>And then we got another class of people who embrace this, and they have 20 more IQ points,</p>
<p>then they live to 120.</p>
<p>No, I mean, it&rsquo;s, it sounds funny, but, and like science fiction, but that is in the realm</p>
<p>of possibility in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of great science fiction written about this whole sort of transhumanist idea.</p>
<p>A book series I really like is Nexus by Ramez Nam, who actually was a developer at Microsoft,</p>
<p>and, you know, then became a writer.</p>
<p>And he writes with, I&rsquo;d say, a high degree of sort of accuracy, accuracy and specificity</p>
<p>about these technologies and how they might evolve.</p>
<p>People should be sure to check out that book.</p>
<p>Jason, be honest, if you could actually increase anything in your body through this gene editing,</p>
<p>what would it be?</p>
<p>Just throw anything out there.</p>
<p>But the first thing to put anything out there, I would increase my muscle mass 100% increase</p>
<p>my muscle mass percentage of fat would go down, not in reality and absolute terms, but</p>
<p>just in percentages.</p>
<p>So this CRISPR thing was a public company called Intelli Therapeutics.</p>
<p>But I want to throw a shout out to another startup that seemingly I think may have had</p>
<p>a breakthrough this week called form energy.</p>
<p>And the reason why these guys are interesting is that they&rsquo;ve built this incredibly massive</p>
<p>long duration battery out of iron.</p>
<p>Now, why is that important?</p>
<p>We have really simple ways of harvesting iron from the earth.</p>
<p>It is literally everywhere, everywhere you look iron exists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so true for nickel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true for cobalt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true for manganese.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true for lithium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true for all of these other specialty chemicals that we need in order to build batteries.</p>
<p>But these guys have solved a very complicated technical challenge that will allow you to</p>
<p>store energy cheaply, which has huge implications for electricity and grids.</p>
<p>And so big shout out to these guys at form, because if it looks like what they said they</p>
<p>did is true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really important breakthrough that will have some important ramifications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, by the way, to see progress.</p>
<p>Now you wake up and you read these things.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just like, God, this is incredible that there are people working away on shit</p>
<p>that really matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if there&rsquo;s like, one group of people, we talked about cynicism in a previous</p>
<p>episode recently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one group of people, whether you&rsquo;re in the founder circles or capital allocator</p>
<p>or a journalist covering this space, who understands it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a technical, you know, explosion going on here, an innovation that is going to solve</p>
<p>a lot of problems.</p>
<p>And they have another group of people who think that all these problems are intractable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of looking at this, you know, what happened with COVID.</p>
<p>And I was talking to my wife about global warming.</p>
<p>And I was like, feels to me like we can solve global warming, like feels like it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>much in our control.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s another group of people who feel like it&rsquo;s over and don&rsquo;t have kids, because</p>
<p>the whole planet&rsquo;s gonna go on.</p>
<p>I mean, I think Elon tweeted this out.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve talked about this now with respect to China.</p>
<p>But you know, we have an enormous problem in the world in general, which is that unless</p>
<p>our birth rate is positive and accretive, it has huge implications to progress, right?</p>
<p>If you just like, if you eliminate, or you decrease the denominator of the global population,</p>
<p>the odds that there&rsquo;s another Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos that are created are just lower.</p>
<p>And so net of anything else, a declining population rate, particularly in Western</p>
<p>countries has huge detrimental effects to the world.</p>
<p>And so all the folks that think that they&rsquo;re going to solve the ecology of the world by</p>
<p>not having kids, it&rsquo;s a little misguided.</p>
<p>The thing to do is to actually have a positive birth rate, find technological solutions to</p>
<p>this problem, and allow what we&rsquo;ve been able to do, which is a rising populace to basically</p>
<p>be motivated to work and solve problems.</p>
<p>And I think that we have to be very careful about that.</p>
<p>Because if people don&rsquo;t get this right, they&rsquo;re going to take the wrong solution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be a solution at all.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to make the problems even worse.</p>
<p>Could you imagine if the population of the earth shrank in half what it would mean in</p>
<p>terms of productivity, services, the healthcare requirements that are needed, the cost of</p>
<p>providing those things, the economic viability of countries will go away, it would be a disaster.</p>
<p>Yet there is a group of people who feel we should do exactly that.</p>
<p>And not a small group of people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, they think that I think I think the mistake is in thinking that human consumption</p>
<p>is the problem.</p>
<p>And specifically with respect to climate change or global warming.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
<p>Because, look, humans, in order to exist, need to consume.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to emit carbon as part of that process.</p>
<p>The important thing to focus on is energy production.</p>
<p>Are you shifting to clean production?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re never going to shrink your consumption enough to basically eliminate</p>
<p>carbon emissions.</p>
<p>It has to be done on the production side.</p>
<p>And one of the interesting things that&rsquo;s happening now, I think we should talk about is</p>
<p>in Europe, they&rsquo;re creating this new carbon trading plan.</p>
<p>I think China is even trying to set up one of these markets.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re creating these new marketplaces to trade carbon permits.</p>
<p>And I think the most exciting part about this is that it gives an incentive for innovators</p>
<p>to create new technologies that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called negative emissions technologies.</p>
<p>Because what happens is if you have a technology to take carbon out of the atmosphere, you</p>
<p>can now sell a permit on the exchange that gives somebody else the right to emit that</p>
<p>carbon.</p>
<p>And now those technologies, those nets, the negative emission technologies, it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>whether they really exist yet, but no one&rsquo;s going to create them if there&rsquo;s not a customer</p>
<p>for them.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really cool about these new tradable permit schemes is they create</p>
<p>a buyer for those nets.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s ultimately how we&rsquo;re going to solve this problem of climate change.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to do it through reducing human consumption.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re gonna have to go back to the stone age if you don&rsquo;t want to emit carbon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about moving to clean production of energy and creating negative emission technologies.</p>
<p>Yeah, let me just build on that for a second.</p>
<p>Look, there&rsquo;s a bunch of cap and trade systems.</p>
<p>China basically has a carbon tax system in place.</p>
<p>The big thing that none of these folks have gotten to yet, but I think if you look at</p>
<p>the laws in Europe, they&rsquo;re going there is the idea of a carbon tariff.</p>
<p>And I think these carbon taxes, if they actually exist properly, will look like a tariff.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say you&rsquo;re Britain, and you want to import a Volkswagen from Germany.</p>
<p>If Britain has a carbon tariff, that says basically, you need to account for all of</p>
<p>the emissions that went into making this car.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to assess an import duty that basically maps to that.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s where the world is going.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably, David, to your point, it&rsquo;s going to be a really big value unlock,</p>
<p>because the amount of money that will get both made but also destroyed in that process</p>
<p>will be incredible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we have a chance to really reimagine consumption in a different way.</p>
<p>Like, there are just so many categories.</p>
<p>I saw this interesting stat, if you look at CPG companies, right, companies like Procter</p>
<p>and Gamble, Clorox, and you compare them to the places where they sell their goods, like</p>
<p>Walmart and Target, every single major big box retailer has basically declared a net</p>
<p>zero emission strategy in the next five to 10 years.</p>
<p>Not a single company on the CPG side has actually any plans to do anything meaningful, anywhere</p>
<p>near 2030 2045 2050.</p>
<p>And when you look under the hood, those companies like PNG and Clorox are enormous emitters,</p>
<p>enormous.</p>
<p>So even though you walk into a target in Amazon, and you try to make yourself feel good thinking,</p>
<p>thinking to yourself, I&rsquo;m buying something that zero emissions, it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically that Amazon will will bear the cost of getting to net zero.</p>
<p>But the products that you actually consume are horrible for the environment.</p>
<p>And the amount of you know, fossil fuels that went into it and the amount of plastic that</p>
<p>will then get put into the ocean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tremendous.</p>
<p>And so moving slightly more aggressively beyond these cap and trade systems into something</p>
<p>that looks more like a tariff, I think could be really important for the world.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to need to do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s and there are multiple ways to do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw Elon backed this the XPRIZE carbon sequestering sequestering</p>
<p>project, which is $100 million prize.</p>
<p>And you can do this in multiple ways.</p>
<p>You can do it at the factory.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the 1 trillion trees.org.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw that where they&rsquo;re trying to plant a trillion trees, because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the original way to sequester this carbon.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s going to be like three or four different ways to do this.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s an incentive to do it, yeah, that is going to help for sure.</p>
<p>Part of why there&rsquo;s such political disagreement over this is because you look at approaches</p>
<p>like the Green New Deal.</p>
<p>I mean, I think they understand the problem.</p>
<p>But what they&rsquo;re proposing is always on the consumption side is basically politicians</p>
<p>picking and choosing how people are going to consume carbon, whether it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>cracking down on private planes to factories.</p>
<p>I mean, again, taking us back to the Stone Age, nobody wants to know.</p>
<p>No one sane, I think, wants to support that kind of totalitarian principle that the politicians</p>
<p>get to tell us how to consume.</p>
<p>But this is why I think these market-based solutions where you say, look, carbon emissions</p>
<p>are obviously an externality.</p>
<p>If you want to emit, you need to basically pay the correct price for carbon emissions.</p>
<p>And we use the money that you pay as some sort of, whether it&rsquo;s a tax or whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>buying a permit, we use that money then offset into negative carbon emissions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a market-based system where the government controls the externality, but they don&rsquo;t dictate</p>
<p>how people get to consume carbon.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the right balance.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really have that type of balanced conversation in the US yet, because you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>kind of got one side that says they want to save the planet, but they want to control</p>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>And then you got the other side saying, well, look, I want to save the economy because your</p>
<p>plan, the Green New Deal is going to destroy it.</p>
<p>What we need is, again, a market-based solution to this.</p>
<p>And I guess the criticism of a market-based solution is you&rsquo;re basically giving people</p>
<p>a way to, the most cynical interpretation would be you can pay to pollute.</p>
<p>You can just, you can pollute all you want and just pay a fine, essentially.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the right way to look at it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually offsetting.</p>
<p>Somebody else is capturing what you put out there.</p>
<p>And depending on the rules of the road, if you had to capture 50% more than you put in,</p>
<p>you could create a formula there, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there could be some formula that over time&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of fraud in this market.</p>
<p>Like, you know, people sell these carbon credits from, you know, certain forests.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this joke, which is like, there&rsquo;s been a tree that&rsquo;s been sold like 80 billion</p>
<p>times, because it&rsquo;s like, you can&rsquo;t really verify, you can only really estimate the amount</p>
<p>of carbon sequestration that, you know, for example, a tree actually does in the first</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s been just a lot of, unfortunately, you know, flat by night, unreliable, non trustworthy</p>
<p>ways that this market has evolved.</p>
<p>People have been waiting for decades for this carbon trading market to really step into</p>
<p>high gear, which is why some folks think the more aggressive plan will just be introduced</p>
<p>tariffs and let the market, David, to your point, sort it out.</p>
<p>Chamath, what do you think the prospects are for these negative emission technologies?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that a solution as low tech as planting trees is going to solve the problem</p>
<p>of carbon.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So the question is, what do you what do you think, assuming we create the market, the</p>
<p>demand for negative emission technologies, the permits to emit?</p>
<p>What do you think the prospects are technologically that innovators are going to come up with</p>
<p>these solutions?</p>
<p>I do think that we are a couple of breakthroughs away from these things being non issues.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of examples.</p>
<p>If you look at like, I&rsquo;ll just use batteries as an example, because where I&rsquo;m spending</p>
<p>a lot of time, when you look back, and like you ask yourself, like, how did we decide</p>
<p>to make the batteries the way we make them?</p>
<p>You know, was it some like, you know, broad survey of every single chemical composition</p>
<p>and all these different structures.</p>
<p>And we realized that, you know, a composition of nickel and manganese and cobalt was the</p>
<p>right thing to do.</p>
<p>Or lithium and iron and phosphate was, it turned out that it was mostly like a handful</p>
<p>of people decided and we all just been iterating around the edges ever since.</p>
<p>So one of the solutions to a lot of these problems is to actually go back to first principles.</p>
<p>The problem is that as these industries get built up, and you know this, you have so much</p>
<p>PP&amp;E, like so much equipment, so much investment in physical capex that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>The idea of switching platforms is almost impossible, because it&rsquo;s not economically</p>
<p>viable.</p>
<p>So we are in this situation today where a bunch of solutions have been proposed, David,</p>
<p>to solve that problem, right?</p>
<p>The problem with carbon capture and other other things and negative emission technologies</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re extremely expensive, they&rsquo;re very inefficient, they require an enormous</p>
<p>amount of energy themselves, and it&rsquo;s not clear that they work.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>One is that there&rsquo;s been some pretty novel innovations in moving people past some of</p>
<p>these basic problems by looking at the periodic table to try to find different ways of solving</p>
<p>things like energy storage, which has huge implications to climate.</p>
<p>But the second is that we are pushing the boundaries of physics in different ways as</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where there&rsquo;s going to be the potential for an enormous breakthrough,</p>
<p>specifically around superconductors.</p>
<p>So what is a superconductor?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that allows an enormous amount of energy to basically trans through it.</p>
<p>Now, we have this issue, which is that you can actually create superconductors in highly</p>
<p>controlled environments that are extremely, extremely cold, but they have incredible</p>
<p>performance characteristics that would revolutionize power and energy transmission and</p>
<p>storage.</p>
<p>People have been innovating in bringing that up to room temperature.</p>
<p>In that breakthrough, which I think you will see in the next 20 to 30 years, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a complete sea change of how we think about this whole problem.</p>
<p>So I think the short term, we&rsquo;re innovating in the periodic table.</p>
<p>In the long term, we&rsquo;re figuring out how to bend the laws of physics.</p>
<p>And I think that those are those are probably the two most practical solutions to a lot</p>
<p>of these things that remove the constraints that we&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>And again, the constraints have been completely human defined, which is the sad thing.</p>
<p>They were not necessary from the start, we could have made very different decisions.</p>
<p>Had we known these problems were going to be as big as they were, you know, the way</p>
<p>that we make plastic didn&rsquo;t have to be this way.</p>
<p>Right, the amount of petroleum that we use, it didn&rsquo;t have to be in this specific way.</p>
<p>But this is where we are.</p>
<p>And there are direct air capture technologies DAC, which is basically an energy issue,</p>
<p>you can literally suck the carbon dioxide out of the air.</p>
<p>And again, another another issue of material science, because the the substrates that you</p>
<p>use tend to be relatively inefficient and sort of really activate them, you&rsquo;re pumping</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of energy through there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the issue is, can you get the energy?</p>
<p>And I think when we talked about the small reactors, the small modular nuclear reactors,</p>
<p>if energy is free, or it&rsquo;s solar based, you could you could kind of get a virtuous cycle</p>
<p>going here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what superconductors allows you to see is a world where you basically</p>
<p>have limitless, free energy.</p>
<p>It sounds like the thing that we all agree on is that this problem is ultimately going</p>
<p>to be solved by innovation.</p>
<p>And this is the problem I have with so many of the political proposals is, you know, our</p>
<p>ability to innovate is a function of the size and scope of our economy and the incentives</p>
<p>and rewards for innovation and the freedom for entrepreneurs to do their thing.</p>
<p>And if you crush that, yeah, you know, with government mandates, you won&rsquo;t get the innovation</p>
<p>we need to get out of this problem.</p>
<p>We can easily innovate our way out of it.</p>
<p>And it requires some individual to say, I want to dedicate my life to it.</p>
<p>And then what is the motivation to do that?</p>
<p>And who are the capital allocators who are going to give them the billion dollars to</p>
<p>create this?</p>
<p>I spent a bunch of time.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m the capital allocator that will give billions.</p>
<p>In fact, I did a survey of the superconductor space, as an example.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what I found of the of the four folks that I found, who are all each individually</p>
<p>doing things in superconductors that I think are incredible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all immigrants.</p>
<p>Every single one were not born in the United States.</p>
<p>You could you they are so fucking happy to be here.</p>
<p>They feel so lucky.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t understand why everybody complains all the fucking time.</p>
<p>Yeah, complaining is, there is a disease of constantly complaining about stuff.</p>
<p>And if you count the number of times you complain every day, and it&rsquo;s more than two or three</p>
<p>times a day, you need to get your head examined.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably just talking yourself into anxiety problems.</p>
<p>Stop complaining, start building.</p>
<p>I mean, these problems are solvable.</p>
<p>There is an immigrant in in the United States right now that will figure out how to conduct</p>
<p>electricity without resistance, it will transform the world.</p>
<p>And we are so fucking lucky that that guy came here to this country.</p>
<p>And we have the chance to give the guy a billion dollars.</p>
<p>One of my favorite movies is wag the dog with Rob De Niro.</p>
<p>And Dustin Hoffman plays this producer character.</p>
<p>And every time there&rsquo;s a setback, he&rsquo;s like, Oh, this is nothing.</p>
<p>I remember we made this movie and three out of the four lead actors died.</p>
<p>And we recast the movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s sort of his catchphrase is he&rsquo;s got this can do attitude where no</p>
<p>matter what setback happens, he just makes it it&rsquo;s like, Oh, this is nothing.</p>
<p>We got it.</p>
<p>And, you know, and that&rsquo;s kind of the attitude you need.</p>
<p>If you want to be an entrepreneur is there&rsquo;s gonna be so many setbacks, you got to be like,</p>
<p>Oh, this is nothing.</p>
<p>And you figure out a way around it.</p>
<p>Yeah, this one of the guys that are working on superconductors showed me his data for</p>
<p>the last 10 years.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting, David, to your point is he had a four year period where he took</p>
<p>a huge step back, where basically, like, you know, he had this superconductor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, it works at, you know, I&rsquo;m just going to use simple numbers here.</p>
<p>But like, you know, minus 300 Celsius, he got it all the way up to minus, you know,</p>
<p>100.</p>
<p>And then it went back to minus 200.</p>
<p>For four years, could you imagine the mental devastation?</p>
<p>And I said, How did you deal with it?</p>
<p>He goes, Ah, you know, basically, he&rsquo;s like, Ah, it&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>And thank God for that guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I just listened to Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s on a podcasting tour, because he&rsquo;s got a new</p>
<p>book, he wrote a novel out of the once upon a time in Hollywood characters.</p>
<p>And I just started listening to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>Listen on audible.</p>
<p>And Brian Koppelman from the moment interviewed Quentin, I listened to it yesterday on my</p>
<p>bike ride.</p>
<p>And he was just talking about how he just never gave up.</p>
<p>And he had written true romance.</p>
<p>And then he wrote, what was the other one he wrote?</p>
<p>At that time, natural born killers, natural killers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he was just talking about how the first movie nobody would do.</p>
<p>Then he wrote the two screenplays and nobody would do and then he got to Reservoir Dogs.</p>
<p>And, you know, they tried to scrape together $800,000.</p>
<p>And he kept asking me, Why didn&rsquo;t you quit?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you quit?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, Well, you know, I just, I figured it out.</p>
<p>Like, I figured out I had a voice.</p>
<p>And then nobody would buy my scripts, because I was trying to do something innovative.</p>
<p>And they were reading the scripts.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t understand what I was doing in terms of innovating on how a movie would</p>
<p>be with, you know, how he does with Pulp Fiction, he changes the time and tells the storytelling</p>
<p>in a nonlinear fashion.</p>
<p>They think nobody understood it.</p>
<p>But every time I read it, I realized I had a voice, it was my voice, it was getting better</p>
<p>and better.</p>
<p>And then people, you know, I sold those movies, and then he kept building them.</p>
<p>And it was very inspiring to think about that take of like, he just didn&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>And he just totally looked at the work and he found his he found his own value in his</p>
<p>own work, improving.</p>
<p>Even without the external, you know, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a fantastic story.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like one of those classic, you know, Hollywood entrepreneur stories.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s working at a video store for years.</p>
<p>And, you know, he would start, he was making his own movie.</p>
<p>And he would film on the weekends.</p>
<p>And then, you know, he made a few hundred dollars every week, basically.</p>
<p>And then he would rent the equipment on a Friday, because then they would only charge</p>
<p>him for one day because it was the weekend.</p>
<p>So he could basically record the entire weekend.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;d go off and record and, and then he&rsquo;d have to go back to work.</p>
<p>And he started making this movie, you know, one weekend at a time for like two or three</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>And then he finally put, he didn&rsquo;t even have the money to get the film developed.</p>
<p>So finally, after three years, he gets the film developed.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, unfortunately, it sucked.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t what he was expecting.</p>
<p>But during that time, he wrote True Romance, which then got bought.</p>
<p>He sold that screenplay.</p>
<p>That gave him a little bit of money.</p>
<p>Then he wrote Reservoir Dogs.</p>
<p>And then he met Lawrence Bender.</p>
<p>And, you know, Bender went out, read the script.</p>
<p>It was like, holy shit, this is amazing.</p>
<p>They raised the million or so bucks to make the movie.</p>
<p>And then that kind of launched everything.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s one of these, you know, amazing rags to riches stories.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re kind of rare.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re more rare in Hollywood.</p>
<p>They occur all the time in the tech industry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an interesting point.</p>
<p>He said, they&rsquo;re like, you would never let you make that movie now.</p>
<p>And you know, in another conversation, I think I listened to three podcasts with them.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan, Bredi Stenelis, and then Brian Koppelmans.</p>
<p>And all three of them are tremendous.</p>
<p>But I think in the Bredi Stenelis, in the Joe Rogan one, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, they would never let you make that movie.</p>
<p>He was like, bullshit, you can just make it.</p>
<p>I just made it.</p>
<p>Did you not see the last two films and how politically incorrect they were?</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t care what Bruce Lee&rsquo;s, you know, fans think of how I portray Bruce Lee.</p>
<p>He was a bad actor.</p>
<p>He was a terrible, you know, human being to these folks.</p>
<p>And his basic thing was everybody keeps waiting to ask for permission.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m just going to make my movies.</p>
<p>And let the chips fall where they may.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be censored.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to censor myself.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll make my 10 movies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Game over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell a rags to riches story.</p>
<p>I want to tell this poker story.</p>
<p>I get one last one on Tarantino and then you tell your story.</p>
<p>Tarantino&rsquo;s success with Reservoir Dogs.</p>
<p>I think it came out in 1991.</p>
<p>That really inspired me to want to make movies because I saw that somebody could make a movie</p>
<p>outside the system for so little money.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I made Thank You for Smoking.</p>
<p>And we have another independent movie coming out next year about Salvador Dali, which,</p>
<p>you know, finally got made after about 15 years.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, he&rsquo;s inspired a lot of people.</p>
<p>He shows what can be done.</p>
<p>This is a rags to riches story that involves Jake out.</p>
<p>So I get invited.</p>
<p>I get invited to the Harvard Business School to give a speech.</p>
<p>First and last time I was invited because I was disinvited, Jason.</p>
<p>After that, what happened?</p>
<p>But well, the back two rows walked out in the first five minutes.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It was incredible.</p>
<p>I get invited to do this thing.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s in Boston.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in wintertime, right, Jacob?</p>
<p>It was winter and it was Boston.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like not a great trip.</p>
<p>So I was like, OK, Jacob, what are we going to do to spice this trip up?</p>
<p>And we invite Big Al.</p>
<p>Oh, OK.</p>
<p>And we get on the plane and Big Al says, oh, you want to play a little poker?</p>
<p>I said, absolutely.</p>
<p>And I turned to Jacob and I said, Jason, do you want to play?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I said, you know, you guys can play against each other.</p>
<p>And I said, Jason, why don&rsquo;t you deal?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not interested in dealing.</p>
<p>And I said, Jacob, I&rsquo;ll give you 10% of whatever I win.</p>
<p>I was like, shuffle up.</p>
<p>He deals the game for fucking six hours from L.A. where we were.</p>
<p>Chinese poker to Boston.</p>
<p>I smashed Big Al.</p>
<p>I smashed Big Al.</p>
<p>Smash.</p>
<p>I smashed him.</p>
<p>And then we go into the thing.</p>
<p>We have like a nice dinner, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>We go out.</p>
<p>We have the thing at Harvard where I said something like, you know,</p>
<p>I think an NBA is basically worthless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good use of your time.</p>
<p>I think you should be out building things.</p>
<p>The back two rows walked out.</p>
<p>They were completely offended.</p>
<p>And I did the speech.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I get back on the plane and we&rsquo;re flying back.</p>
<p>And at some point, I realized I said, Jason, what&rsquo;s the tally?</p>
<p>And Jason says, I&rsquo;m up 40,000.</p>
<p>And I said, excuse me.</p>
<p>And it turned out that I was fucking smashing him.</p>
<p>Smashing.</p>
<p>Smashing.</p>
<p>Anyways, the long story short of it was that we circled for a few times</p>
<p>and then we finally landed.</p>
<p>And J Cal won $55,000.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s circling.</p>
<p>So you could win more.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Through the pack of cards at Jason and said, I never want to.</p>
<p>I never want to see you ever again.</p>
<p>I never want to have you fucking play poker ever again.</p>
<p>I went to the pilots and I told them,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you five grand if you can make this flight last another hour.</p>
<p>And they were like, yeah, we got a circle.</p>
<p>They got it.</p>
<p>And we just kept circling for an hour.</p>
<p>I was like, I got to get another hour.</p>
<p>And he lost $550,000 on a fucking stupid trip.</p>
<p>He never even wanted to come.</p>
<p>He just came.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to go to the best Michelin star restaurant in Boston.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>In Boston.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fucking stuffy, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so stuffy and so stuffy.</p>
<p>They take themselves so seriously.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to, you know, bring, you know, 18 courses to us.</p>
<p>And, you know, Big Al&rsquo;s a big guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s called Big Al for a reason.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a linebacker.</p>
<p>And they say to Big Al.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll take this.</p>
<p>I want a steak.</p>
<p>What do you got?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh, there&rsquo;s a steak included in the prefect.</p>
<p>You should do the tasting menu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, you&rsquo;re tasting money.</p>
<p>Fuck it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put more truffles on it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, it&rsquo;s not truffle season.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, OK, well, make it truffle season.</p>
<p>Anyway, he started bringing the food and he wants to eat a steak.</p>
<p>And they bring him.</p>
<p>I kid you not.</p>
<p>You know one of those funny scenes in a movie where, like, they pull the tin</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a small piece of meat that&rsquo;s like giant plate.</p>
<p>Schaefer comes flying off a piece of parsley and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>The steak was the size of a pack of Wrigley&rsquo;s gum.</p>
<p>I am not kidding.</p>
<p>They took like a beautiful steak and they just made a little rectangle out of it.</p>
<p>He takes his fork.</p>
<p>He puts it on it.</p>
<p>He holds it up to the woman.</p>
<p>He goes, where&rsquo;s my steak?</p>
<p>And he puts the whole steak in his mouth.</p>
<p>She goes, sir, that was your steak.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I want a steak.</p>
<p>He starts screaming.</p>
<p>I want a steak.</p>
<p>I want a steak.</p>
<p>The whole restaurant.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I ordered a steak.</p>
<p>This is not a steak.</p>
<p>If you ask him about this trip, he&rsquo;s like, I lost so much money.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I didn&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>It was cold in Boston.</p>
<p>It was cold.</p>
<p>It was the worst trip ever.</p>
<p>It was a horrible trip ever.</p>
<p>And he is like, the woman&rsquo;s like, well, how can we make you happy?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, bring me a steak.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, well, sir, we gave you a steak.</p>
<p>The steak came.</p>
<p>How many steaks?</p>
<p>How many steaks are you going to afford now that Robinhood just went public?</p>
<p>Congrats for JK.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s right now it&rsquo;s my third biggest win, Ubercom.</p>
<p>And then this one and, you know, time in market, I think Robinhood going out at 30 billion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chance this could go 10, 20, 30 X from here.</p>
<p>I think it could be a trillion dollar company someday.</p>
<p>22 million members, even through all the craziness that we talked about on this podcast,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re learning, they&rsquo;re fixing things.</p>
<p>And 22 million people using the product, and they&rsquo;re going to launch so many other</p>
<p>products as part of it.</p>
<p>And all these young people getting financially literate.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a double edged sword, but I kind of feel like this generation balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s better balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I mean, can you imagine if we were in our 20s trading derivatives and options and just</p>
<p>trading stocks all day?</p>
<p>I wanted to do that.</p>
<p>But it was too hard.</p>
<p>You had to get a broker.</p>
<p>It was $35 a trade when I started trading and you had to call Charles Schwab and put</p>
<p>it in order.</p>
<p>Of all the things of all the things I could have done online in my 20s and 30s trading</p>
<p>stocks, what didn&rsquo;t end up being high on the list?</p>
<p>But I mean, a lot of cards, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what these kids are doing.</p>
<p>Like for them, this is, you know, in the same zone.</p>
<p>A lot of them as sports betting, wagering, playing poker for money.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you feel about it, David.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you make a lot of mistakes early in your career, when you&rsquo;re making $100</p>
<p>bets or buying a 10th of a stock, you know, it&rsquo;s small stakes and you&rsquo;re going to learn</p>
<p>a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>So I think the education part is you can only learn by doing right, Saks?</p>
<p>I mean, you can&rsquo;t learn in a in a thing.</p>
<p>OK, listen, it&rsquo;s been an amazing episode, even without Freeberg.</p>
<p>We miss you, Freeberg.</p>
<p>Come back next week.</p>
<p>Let the conspiracy theories abound.</p>
<p>But Freeberg just was busy.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>And we all wanted to.</p>
<p>We missed each other.</p>
<p>So we wanted to see our besties.</p>
<p>We love you, Freeberg.</p>
<p>I love you, Freeberg.</p>
<p>We love you, Freeberg.</p>
<p>Back at you, Freeberg.</p>
<p>Back at you, Freeberg.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>My dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that we just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What the beep beep?</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
