    <p>Welcome to the History of English podcast, a podcast about the history of the English</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>This is episode 16, The Rise of Rome and Latin.</p>
<p>In this episode, we&rsquo;re going to look at the emergence of Rome from a small city near the</p>
<p>western coast of Italy to the dominant political and military power of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And this will set the stage for the expansion of Latin throughout the western world.</p>
<p>In this episode, I&rsquo;m going to provide a brief overview of the rise of Rome.</p>
<p>There have been millions of words written about this subject, and there are some great</p>
<p>podcasts out there that deal exclusively with the history of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>But for our purposes, I think it&rsquo;s important to understand the basic events which led to</p>
<p>the rise of Roman power and the spread of the Roman language throughout Western Europe.</p>
<p>And along the way, we can look at some of the Latin words which have passed into English.</p>
<p>And again, since Latin has had such a tremendous influence on English, I&rsquo;m only going to look</p>
<p>at a few of the modern English words which originated during this period.</p>
<p>In fact, from this point forward in the story of English, I&rsquo;ll be introducing more and more</p>
<p>Latin words.</p>
<p>Because from this point on, the Latin words are constantly filtering into English.</p>
<p>They come in during the late Roman period when the Romans encountered the Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>They come in when the Romans conquered southern Britain.</p>
<p>They come in with the spread of the church into Britain.</p>
<p>And they come in with the Norman French.</p>
<p>And they come in during and after the Renaissance in a variety of academic and scientific and</p>
<p>legal borrowings.</p>
<p>So Latin is going to be a constant part of the story of English as we move forward.</p>
<p>And the fact that Latin is so pervasive is itself a testament to the overall power and</p>
<p>influence of the Romans.</p>
<p>We live with the Roman legacy every day in the words we use and the alphabet we use to</p>
<p>write those words.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s pick up the story where we left off in the last episode.</p>
<p>As you may recall, Indo-European tribes had settled into what is today modern Italy.</p>
<p>And a group of Indo-European tribes had settled in a region which extended from the Tiber</p>
<p>River southward, which was called Latium.</p>
<p>And the dialect of these tribes was eventually called Latin after the name of that region.</p>
<p>And a group of these people had begun to settle in and around the hilly region along the Tiber</p>
<p>River, which eventually became known as Rome.</p>
<p>But this early Roman village was initially controlled by Etruscan kings from northern</p>
<p>Italy.</p>
<p>And this is a very important point.</p>
<p>North of the Tiber was the Latium region occupied mainly by Latin speakers with a culture descended</p>
<p>from the original Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>But north of the Tiber was the early Etruscan civilization, which spoke a completely different</p>
<p>language.</p>
<p>And Rome lied on the Tiber River, which was the dividing line between these two regions.</p>
<p>The people who lived there were Latin-speaking people with an Indo-European ancestry.</p>
<p>But they were ruled by Etruscan kings from the Etruscan culture to the north.</p>
<p>Now as I said, Rome was home to only a portion of the Latin-speaking peoples in the region.</p>
<p>And during this early period, tribal warfare was a constant.</p>
<p>There were wars between these Latin-speaking tribes and wars between those tribes and other</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>And early Rome had to deal with these conflicts and the warring tribes all around it.</p>
<p>But the hills of Rome afforded it some protection during that period.</p>
<p>And eventually, as Rome began to grow and as it began to borrow more and more from the</p>
<p>Etruscans, including Etruscan military practices, Rome started to become a powerful city-state</p>
<p>in its own right.</p>
<p>And it soon became more aggressive in its relationship with the surrounding Latin tribes.</p>
<p>Rome began to wage war against its Latin neighbors and it began to conquer them.</p>
<p>And as Roman power grew, the overall power and influence of the Etruscans to the north</p>
<p>began to wane.</p>
<p>As you may recall from the last episode, the Etruscan territory was a collection of independent</p>
<p>city-states with a common language and culture.</p>
<p>But there wasn&rsquo;t a centralized government.</p>
<p>And furthermore, they were primarily interested in trade and commerce.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t empire builders.</p>
<p>And they also found themselves at war not only with surrounding tribes in the north</p>
<p>of Italy, but also with the Greeks who had expanded into the northern Mediterranean as</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>And all of this took a toll on the Etruscan civilization, which was beginning to experience</p>
<p>a period of decline.</p>
<p>And this was occurring at the same time that Roman power was growing at a faster and faster</p>
<p>rate.</p>
<p>The Romans had become much more organized and militaristic.</p>
<p>And the tipping point in this relationship was late in the 6th century BC.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve noted, Rome was initially ruled by Etruscan kings.</p>
<p>And later Roman historians alleged that those early Etruscan kings were cruel and harsh</p>
<p>rulers.</p>
<p>The authority of these kings was symbolized by a bundle of rods with an axe.</p>
<p>And it was called a phascus.</p>
<p>And that is actually the origin of the term fascism.</p>
<p>In the late 6th century BC, the Romans began to rise up against their Etruscan rulers.</p>
<p>And around 509 or 510 BC, the Romans drove out the last Etruscan king, named Tarquinius,</p>
<p>or sometimes called Tarquin the Proud.</p>
<p>And at this point, Rome became a republic.</p>
<p>After the loss of Rome, the Etruscans continued to lose their grip on other cities in northern</p>
<p>Italy, and increasingly, the loss of Etruscan power was replaced by Roman power.</p>
<p>So we now have a completely independent Rome, occupied by Latin-speaking Romans, and now</p>
<p>governed by Romans.</p>
<p>And again, this is around 509 BC, which is the date the Romans themselves used as the</p>
<p>date when Rome began.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why this date is used as the date for the beginning of the Roman Republic</p>
<p>is because a treaty was signed between Rome and Carthage in 508 BC, though some historians</p>
<p>argue over the accuracy of that date.</p>
<p>And that particular treaty doesn&rsquo;t mention a Roman king, so that suggests that Rome was</p>
<p>no longer being ruled by kings, which would have been those Etruscan kings.</p>
<p>So again, now we have an independent Roman Republic, but life was not easy for Rome during</p>
<p>this period.</p>
<p>As soon as the Etruscans were expelled from Rome, the city came under attack from its</p>
<p>neighbors, and Rome had to fight for survival.</p>
<p>But Roman power eventually allowed Rome to take the upper hand, and the city was ultimately</p>
<p>able to establish an alliance with the other Latin-speaking tribes in Latium to the south</p>
<p>of Rome, and Rome eventually came to dominate that alliance.</p>
<p>During this period, the culture of Rome became more and more distinct from the Etruscan</p>
<p>culture to the north.</p>
<p>Around this time, the Romans built the first temple to the Roman gods Jupiter, Juno, and</p>
<p>Minerva.</p>
<p>And this temple is sometimes called the Temple of Jupiter, but it was actually a single structure</p>
<p>with three different sections for each of the three gods, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.</p>
<p>And this temple was built on one of the seven hills of Rome.</p>
<p>And according to tradition, when the foundation of the temple was being laid, the Romans found</p>
<p>a human skull buried in the ground, and the Romans took this as a positive sign.</p>
<p>They interpreted this head as a sign that Rome was destined to be the head of all of</p>
<p>Italy.</p>
<p>Now, the Latin word for head was coppet, and if you have a good memory, you may remember</p>
<p>that I talked about that word in the episode on Grimm&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>Remember that Jacob Grimm had studied the Germanic languages, which includes English,</p>
<p>and he had identified the specific sound changes which had occurred within the Germanic</p>
<p>language family, which distinguish the Germanic languages from the other Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>And two of the specific changes which he observed were a shift in the K sound to the H sound,</p>
<p>and a shift of the P sound to the F sound.</p>
<p>And I gave this Latin word coppet as an example because it includes both of those changes.</p>
<p>Remember that the Romans almost always used the letter C for the K sound, so the word</p>
<p>coppet was spelled C-A-P-U-T, and this word is apparently very similar to the original</p>
<p>Indo-European word for head.</p>
<p>Now in the Germanic languages, the initial K sound had shifted to an H sound, and the</p>
<p>middle P sound had shifted to an F sound under Grimm&rsquo;s Law, so in Old English we have the</p>
<p>word hafud, and that was the original version of the modern word head.</p>
<p>Over time, the middle consonant F had fallen out, and the word was shortened to the modern</p>
<p>word head.</p>
<p>So, I just wanted to make that connection again for you.</p>
<p>Well, the Romans found this head, this coppet, as they were building the temple to Jupiter.</p>
<p>And based upon this discovery, they determined that they were destined to be the head of</p>
<p>Italy.</p>
<p>So they called this particular hill where the temple was being built the Capitoline</p>
<p>Hill, and that produced the word capital, which has come down to us in modern English.</p>
<p>And that word still means the head place or primary place.</p>
<p>And it can also refer to a specific building in which government business is conducted.</p>
<p>And of course, in the United States, we have our own Capitol Hill, and this reflects the</p>
<p>influence which the Romans had on the founding fathers of the United States.</p>
<p>So we have the Capitoline Hill, and in the last episode I mentioned the first Latin-speaking</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans had settled on the Palatine Hill in Rome.</p>
<p>So these are two of the so-called Seven Hills of Rome.</p>
<p>And many of the leaders and prominent families of Rome lived on the Palatine Hill.</p>
<p>So around this time, the Romans decided to drain the valley between these two hills.</p>
<p>And at that site, in the drained valley, the Roman Forum was constructed.</p>
<p>And the Forum was the marketplace of Rome.</p>
<p>It was the center of civic life, and it contained temples, law courts, the Senate House, and</p>
<p>other public forums.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of arguing and debate in the Forum, and the word forum has given</p>
<p>us the word forensic, meaning something related to the law or the courts.</p>
<p>So forensic science, which seems to dominate prime-time television these days, it means</p>
<p>science related to proving a case in court, like someone&rsquo;s guilt or innocence.</p>
<p>Now after the Forum was constructed, the Romans placed a large stone there.</p>
<p>The Romans then placed additional markers on the roads leading out of Rome, and each</p>
<p>marker was placed at a distance of 1,000 paces.</p>
<p>Since a pace was approximately five feet, 1,000 paces was approximately 5,000 feet in</p>
<p>modern measurements.</p>
<p>And since the unit of length was 1,000 paces, the Romans called the distance a mila, which</p>
<p>was the Latin word for 1,000.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve taken that measurement in modern English as the word mile.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also why a modern mile comes from the Latin word for 1,000, but actually represents</p>
<p>a measurement of slightly more than 5,000 feet in modern measurements.</p>
<p>By the way, each of these markers was called a miliarium, and this word comes into English</p>
<p>as milestone.</p>
<p>So as you traveled in or out of Rome, you passed a miliarium every 1,000 paces.</p>
<p>So this was a mark indicating how far you had come or how far you had to go.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in this sense that we&rsquo;ve inherited the term milestone, to refer to a level of</p>
<p>achievement or accomplishment.</p>
<p>And of course the Latin word mila, meaning 1,000, appears in many other modern English</p>
<p>words.</p>
<p>We have it, for example, in words like millipede and millimeter, and the word million, which</p>
<p>actually means 1,000 thousands.</p>
<p>So Rome had emerged as a powerful republic, independent from its earlier Etruscan overlords.</p>
<p>Now over the next century, Rome continued to expand its territory, and the Etruscan</p>
<p>territory continued to shrink.</p>
<p>And in the 4th century BC, two back-to-back events occurred, which would have a tremendous</p>
<p>influence on the development of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>First, in 396 BC, the Romans finally defeated the chief Etruscan city of Veii after a ten-year</p>
<p>siege.</p>
<p>And after the capture of Veii, the Romans quickly consumed the entirety of the Etruscan</p>
<p>territory within the emerging Roman Republic.</p>
<p>So we see the emerging Roman Republic expanding at a rapid rate, and basically consuming its</p>
<p>formal rivals in the Italian peninsula.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really interesting at this point, is how the Romans treated the Etruscan culture</p>
<p>which had been so influential in its early history.</p>
<p>At this point, Etruscan influences may have been as great if not greater than Greek influences.</p>
<p>But the Romans apparently wanted nothing to do with these Etruscan influences.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because Rome didn&rsquo;t want to acknowledge or admit that it had begun as</p>
<p>basically an Etruscan city.</p>
<p>Maybe it resented the Etruscan kings.</p>
<p>But regardless, the Romans largely discarded the Etruscan contributions to the early Roman</p>
<p>culture.</p>
<p>And instead, they gave the credit to the Greeks, or to mythological stories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s believed that the Romans may have actively destroyed Etruscan writings, which may have</p>
<p>presented an alternate view of history.</p>
<p>We know that the Etruscans had writing because the Romans had borrowed the alphabet from</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>Yet, we have very few traces of the Etruscan language today.</p>
<p>Only a few artifacts and inscriptions exist.</p>
<p>And that is partly why we know so little about the Etruscan language.</p>
<p>Many Roman historians believe that this scarcity of Etruscan writings and artifacts is due</p>
<p>to the intentional purge by the later Romans.</p>
<p>Now as I mentioned, there were two back-to-back events which happened around this time in</p>
<p>Roman history.</p>
<p>First was the complete victory over the Etruscans.</p>
<p>But the other event, which only happened about six years later, would have the exact opposite</p>
<p>impact on Rome, at least in the short term.</p>
<p>And this event was the invasion of Celtic-speaking Gauls from the north who sacked Rome in 390</p>
<p>BC.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m going to take a much closer look at the early Celtic-speaking tribes in the</p>
<p>next episode.</p>
<p>But for now, it&rsquo;s just important to understand that much of central Europe, north of Italy,</p>
<p>was occupied by a variety of tribes which had a similar culture and who spoke closely</p>
<p>related Celtic languages.</p>
<p>You may recall from the last episode that many language historians believe that the</p>
<p>linguistic ancestors of the Celtic tribes may have once lived with or in very close</p>
<p>proximity to the ancestors of the Latin speakers in southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>And this is because there are some strong similarities between those two language families.</p>
<p>And this view holds that the Celtic ancestors traveled into central and western Europe where</p>
<p>they came to dominate the entire region.</p>
<p>The region north of Italy and generally west of the Rhine is known today as France.</p>
<p>But at this time, the region was called Gaul and it was dominated by these Celtic-speaking</p>
<p>tribes.</p>
<p>Around 391 BC, a group of these Celtic-speaking tribes crossed the Alps from the north and</p>
<p>began to settle into northern Italy.</p>
<p>Of course, this was the Etruscan territory which was in the process of falling to the</p>
<p>Romans in the south.</p>
<p>So the Romans sent ambassadors to arbitrate between the Gauls and the Etruscans in the</p>
<p>north of that territory.</p>
<p>But the Romans committed a diplomatic no-no by dropping their neutrality and joining the</p>
<p>Etruscans against the Gauls.</p>
<p>The Gauls were so offended by this breach of military etiquette that they decided to</p>
<p>march on Rome itself.</p>
<p>But the important part of this story is what happened when the Celtic-speaking Gauls arrived</p>
<p>in Rome.</p>
<p>Simply stated, they defeated the Roman army and they occupied and sacked and burned the</p>
<p>city.</p>
<p>They occupied and ruled over the city for seven months before eventually being afflicted</p>
<p>by malaria and other diseases and they finally agreed to leave after the Romans paid them</p>
<p>a massive ransom of gold.</p>
<p>When the Gauls finally abandoned Rome, many Romans returned to find the city almost uninhabitable.</p>
<p>Many Romans thought that it would be best to abandon the city altogether and move to</p>
<p>the Etruscan city of Veii, which they had recently conquered.</p>
<p>But the decision was made to stay put and to rebuild Rome.</p>
<p>Now the consequences of this event cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Up to this point, everything had been going Rome&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>They were beginning to think of themselves as invincible.</p>
<p>But all of that changed with the sack of Rome by the Gauls.</p>
<p>It was a very traumatic event for the Romans and it severely affected their psyche.</p>
<p>It shaped their view of the Celtic tribes to the north and the way the Romans interacted</p>
<p>with them in the future.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an important backdrop to the Roman invasion of Gaul under Julius Caesar, which</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at in the next episode.</p>
<p>But it also made the Romans refocus and redouble their efforts to dominate the region.</p>
<p>The Romans would remember being sacked by the Gauls for many generations and they remained</p>
<p>apprehensive of the Celtic threat to the north, even as they were conquering the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In fact, this invasion of Celtic-speaking Gauls was the last time a foreign invader</p>
<p>would sack Rome until the fall of the Roman Empire many centuries later.</p>
<p>Now in the aftermath of the invasion by the Gauls and Rome&rsquo;s period of rebuilding, several</p>
<p>Latin tribes around Rome took the opportunity to declare independence.</p>
<p>And after a period of revolts and border wars, Rome finally subjugated almost all of the</p>
<p>Latin tribes in 338 BC.</p>
<p>The Latin League, which had been established by these communities in Rome, was dissolved</p>
<p>and it was replaced by a federation of Latin colonies which owed their loyalty to Rome.</p>
<p>Now even though the other Latin cities theoretically retained their freedom and retained many of</p>
<p>the rights as citizens of Rome, the Romans still established garrisons throughout the</p>
<p>Latin cities to maintain order.</p>
<p>And this is the basic model which Rome followed as it conquered one territory after another.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also very important to the overall spread of the Latin language.</p>
<p>Now unlike other empires or armies, the Romans didn&rsquo;t just invade and conquer and loot new</p>
<p>territories.</p>
<p>They basically offered each new, defeated territory a deal.</p>
<p>If the newly defeated territory accepted Roman rule, they could become part of Rome.</p>
<p>They could even become Roman citizens.</p>
<p>They could share in the wealth of the Roman civilization and they could enjoy the civilizing</p>
<p>influence of Roman culture.</p>
<p>But if the territory rejected Roman rule, the consequences would be severe.</p>
<p>So it was either Romanization or repression.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many chose Romanization.</p>
<p>But that process of Romanization meant the spread of Roman culture, and specifically</p>
<p>the Roman language, Latin.</p>
<p>And as these new territories were added to the Roman Empire, Latin became the lingua</p>
<p>franca.</p>
<p>It quickly replaced the native languages in many of these territories.</p>
<p>And we will especially see this trend in Western Europe in the next episode.</p>
<p>So since we&rsquo;re talking about the spread of the early Roman Empire throughout Italy, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk about the Roman military.</p>
<p>Now you probably won&rsquo;t be surprised to learn that we get a lot of military-related terms</p>
<p>from the Romans.</p>
<p>And actually we get many Latin-derived military terms from the French-speaking Normans after</p>
<p>1066.</p>
<p>But we can see the roots of the words by looking at the Romans themselves.</p>
<p>For example, the wooden bar that links two animals together when pulling a wagon or plow</p>
<p>is called a yoke.</p>
<p>And you may remember that the word yoke has been traced all the way back to the original</p>
<p>Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>Well, when the Romans defeated an opposing army, they would sometimes make the defeated</p>
<p>troops pass underneath a homemade yoke.</p>
<p>And the yoke was made by sticking two spears in the ground and placing a third one across</p>
<p>the top.</p>
<p>And this ritual symbolized Roman victory and Roman domination over the defeated troops.</p>
<p>In Latin, a yoke was called a yugum.</p>
<p>And the ritual of marching defeated troops under the yugum was called sub-yugum, meaning</p>
<p>under the yoke.</p>
<p>In later French, the y sound shifted to a j sound in many words.</p>
<p>So sub-yugum evolved from French into English as subjugate.</p>
<p>So subjugate literally means under the yoke in the original Roman military sense.</p>
<p>The Romans valued salt for both preservative value and its use in flavoring.</p>
<p>The Romans adopted a rule that Roman soldiers would receive a salt allowance or an amount</p>
<p>of money to purchase a specific amount of salt.</p>
<p>And the Latin word for salt was sal, so the salt allowance or payment to soldiers was</p>
<p>called a salarium for the Roman word for salt.</p>
<p>And this became the root of the word salary, which we have in modern English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the basis of the phrase worth his salt or worth one&rsquo;s salt.</p>
<p>Now Roman soldiers were also issued very specific military equipment, including a sword, a shield,</p>
<p>and a helmet.</p>
<p>And the helmet was one of the most important pieces of equipment since it protected the</p>
<p>soldier&rsquo;s head in battle.</p>
<p>And this gave the Romans an advantage against barbarian tribes that didn&rsquo;t use helmets.</p>
<p>And the fastener of the helmet&rsquo;s chin strap was located near the soldier&rsquo;s cheek and was</p>
<p>called a buccula, which meant little cheek.</p>
<p>Over time, the term was used to refer to any type of fastener, and the term became buckle</p>
<p>after it was adopted into English.</p>
<p>The word infantry can also be traced back to the Romans.</p>
<p>And speaking of infantry, have you ever wondered if there was a connection between the words</p>
<p>infant and infantry?</p>
<p>Well, unless you visualize an army of babies, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much of a connection</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>But, as you might imagine, there is a connection.</p>
<p>What do infants and an infantry have in common?</p>
<p>Well, at least theoretically, they&rsquo;re both supposed to listen and obey their elders or</p>
<p>superiors.</p>
<p>And the connection here has to do with speech, or actually, in this case, the lack of speech.</p>
<p>It also affords me one of these occasional opportunities to digress into some interesting</p>
<p>etymology.</p>
<p>The Latin word for baby or small child was infans, which literally meant not speaking</p>
<p>since babies were not able to speak yet.</p>
<p>And of course, the modern English word infant comes to us directly from the Latin word infants.</p>
<p>In the Roman military, the newest soldiers were not ready for cavalry or advanced responsibilities,</p>
<p>so they were relegated to duty on foot.</p>
<p>Since they were the inexperienced soldiers, and since they were to obey orders and not</p>
<p>speak unless spoken to, the term infans was used to create the term infantry.</p>
<p>And speaking of youth, the Latin term aliscara, meaning to grow, is derived from an original</p>
<p>Indo-European root word, which meant the same thing, to grow or nourish.</p>
<p>Now the Romans put the prefix ad-, meaning to, in front of the word aliscara to form</p>
<p>the word adolescara, meaning to grow up.</p>
<p>This is the root of the word adolescent, in other words, one who is growing up.</p>
<p>The past participle of adolescara was adultus, which is the root of adult, in other words,</p>
<p>one who has already grown up.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s go back to the Latin word infans for a second.</p>
<p>As I said, this word gave us infant and infantry, but buried within that word is a very basic</p>
<p>root which appears in lots of modern English words.</p>
<p>That root is fa-, which refers to anything going into or coming out of the mouth.</p>
<p>So it could refer to words, or it could refer to food.</p>
<p>So in- was a Latin prefix meaning not, like incapable meaning not capable, or insensitive</p>
<p>meaning not sensitive.</p>
<p>So since fa- referred to speech or words, infans meant unable to speak.</p>
<p>And as I said, infantry referred to young soldiers and those who were supposed to listen</p>
<p>and obey, not speak, like infants.</p>
<p>So Latin fa- came from the Greek word pha-, which was spelled with the Greek letter phi.</p>
<p>So the Greek root is spelled p-h-a in the modern alphabet.</p>
<p>Now both Latin fa- spelled f-a and Greek pha- spelled p-h-a both meant the same thing.</p>
<p>And we see this root in words like esophagus.</p>
<p>We also see it in the root of the word face, f-a-c-e, since the mouth is the largest opening</p>
<p>in the face.</p>
<p>We also see the root fa- in the word fame from the Latin word fama, which is based upon</p>
<p>your reputation or things people say about you.</p>
<p>Many Romans felt that your fama or fame impacted you and ultimately how your life played out.</p>
<p>This created the word fata, which is the root of the modern English word fate.</p>
<p>The root word fa- also produced the word fes, which is found in modern English expressions</p>
<p>like fess up, meaning to speak the truth about yourself.</p>
<p>Another word for this is confess, and its noun version confession, again both based</p>
<p>on the same fa- root.</p>
<p>We also see it in profess.</p>
<p>Pro- could mean in front of or on behalf of something.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m going to speak on behalf of something, I&rsquo;m going to profess it.</p>
<p>That would make me a professor.</p>
<p>And something I can talk about in great detail and with great expertise is my profession.</p>
<p>That might make me a professional.</p>
<p>And if the connection between speech and profession seems like a bit of a stretch, well then what</p>
<p>about your vocation, which shares the same root as vocal.</p>
<p>So there.</p>
<p>And by the way, a place where you offered prayers or made oaths was called a fonam in</p>
<p>Latin, again with the same fa- root.</p>
<p>So since you offered prayers there, a fonam came to refer to a religious or holy place.</p>
<p>And the words profane and profanity come from the combination of pro and fonam.</p>
<p>This may seem a bit odd at first.</p>
<p>If you are pro-fonam, then it may seem like you&rsquo;re speaking in favor of something religious</p>
<p>or holy.</p>
<p>But pro also meant before or in front of.</p>
<p>So if you were speaking pro-fonam, you were speaking in front of or outside of the fonam,</p>
<p>not inside of it.</p>
<p>So pro-fonam came to refer to things outside of the holy place.</p>
<p>They were therefore not holy.</p>
<p>They were common or vulgar.</p>
<p>In other words, they were profane.</p>
<p>So we can see how a common Greek or Latin root word like fa produced a multitude of</p>
<p>modern English words.</p>
<p>By the way, I got a lot of these fa words from the book The Words of the Day by Professor</p>
<p>Stephen M. Cerruti, so I wanted to acknowledge that book for this brief digression.</p>
<p>And since I&rsquo;ve talked about words which came from the original Latin word related to speech,</p>
<p>let me mention a couple of things about writing.</p>
<p>The Romans didn&rsquo;t have books in the sense that we know them today.</p>
<p>Instead, they wrote with ink on parchment.</p>
<p>And the parchment was rolled up for easy handling.</p>
<p>When writing with ink, the Romans would often use a feather for writing.</p>
<p>And the Latin word for feather was penna.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the source of the modern English word pen.</p>
<p>And you may remember from an earlier episode that Latin penna and English feather are actually</p>
<p>cognate.</p>
<p>Both words came from an original Indo-European word.</p>
<p>And again, between penna and feather, we see that shift from the p sound to the f sound</p>
<p>in the Germanic languages which Jacob Grimm had identified.</p>
<p>On addition to parchment, some Romans also wrote on small wooden boards covered with</p>
<p>a thin coat of wax.</p>
<p>They would take a stylus and write on the wax.</p>
<p>And they called these tabulae.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the origin of the word tablet.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to think of ancient Romans walking around with tablets and writing</p>
<p>on them with a stylus.</p>
<p>Because in the modern world of iPads and iPhones and other digital tablets, we&rsquo;re sort</p>
<p>of mimicking what those original Romans were doing over 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s turn our attention back to the growing Roman Republic, soon to become the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>And I want to conclude this episode by looking at the expansion of the Roman Republic beyond</p>
<p>the Italian Peninsula into the Mediterranean, including North Africa, Greece, and the Middle</p>
<p>East.</p>
<p>Now it was very possible at this early date, around the 4th century BC, that Rome&rsquo;s sphere</p>
<p>of influence could have basically been contained to Italy itself, because beyond the shores</p>
<p>of Italy to the south was a major regional power, with a lineage that stretched back</p>
<p>to the Phoenicians, and it was the city-state of Carthage.</p>
<p>I mentioned Carthage in an earlier episode when I discussed the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>And you may recall that the Phoenicians were a collection of city-states in and around</p>
<p>modern-day Lebanon, who spoke a Semitic language, and who used an early form of the alphabet</p>
<p>which the Greeks later borrowed, and which was the original form of the alphabet we still</p>
<p>use today.</p>
<p>You may also recall that the Phoenicians traded throughout the Mediterranean, and they established</p>
<p>colonies along the way, especially along the North African coast.</p>
<p>And one of those colonies was Carthage in what is modern-day Tunisia.</p>
<p>And as the power and influence of the Phoenicians began to disappear in the East, the power</p>
<p>of Carthage became greater and greater in the West.</p>
<p>And the language of the Carthaginians was inherited directly from the Phoenicians, and</p>
<p>it was called Punic by the Romans, again a direct reference to the original Phoenicians.</p>
<p>The Latin word for Phoenician was Punic, and in fact the Romans generally thought of Carthage</p>
<p>as a Phoenician city speaking a Phoenician language.</p>
<p>And as Carthage grew, its biggest rival early on was Greece.</p>
<p>Remember the Greeks were the only people who could challenge the trading and shipping prowess</p>
<p>of the early Phoenicians.</p>
<p>And when the Phoenician city-states were consumed by other regional powers, that left Carthage</p>
<p>to deal with the Greeks.</p>
<p>And Carthage had briefly entered into an alliance with the Etruscans to fend off the Greeks.</p>
<p>And Carthage expanded its sphere of influence by taking control of what is today southern</p>
<p>Spain.</p>
<p>So Carthage now extended from North Africa into southern Europe.</p>
<p>In turn, the Greeks intensified their position in southern Gaul, remember that&rsquo;s modern France.</p>
<p>And also remember that modern cities like Marseille and Nice were once Greek colonies.</p>
<p>And these Greek port cities in southern Gaul allowed the Greeks to maintain access to trade</p>
<p>routes which extended into the heart of Western Europe.</p>
<p>So what resulted was an unstable and very delicate balance of power between the Greeks,</p>
<p>the Carthaginians, and the Etruscans.</p>
<p>And this balance of power was disrupted by the ultimate rise of Rome.</p>
<p>It was probably inevitable that Rome and Carthage would collide as Rome&rsquo;s sphere of influence</p>
<p>spread southward and Carthage&rsquo;s sphere of influence spread northward.</p>
<p>Initially, direct conflict between these two powers was avoided because Greek colonies</p>
<p>were located in between Rome and Carthage, in parts of southern Italy and Sicily.</p>
<p>So those Greek colonies provided a bit of a buffer zone.</p>
<p>A non-aggression treaty had been negotiated between Rome and Carthage in 348 BC, which</p>
<p>allowed Rome to actually advance south.</p>
<p>And it was only a matter of time before Rome was eyeing those Greek cities in southern</p>
<p>Italy and Sicily.</p>
<p>And those cities were in a state of decline and headed for conflict with Carthage when</p>
<p>Rome intervened on behalf of the Greek cities.</p>
<p>As Rome&rsquo;s intentions were clearly spreading to the southern part of Italy, it led to direct</p>
<p>conflict with Carthage in southern Italy in 264 BC.</p>
<p>This initiated the first in three Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage to determine who</p>
<p>would rule the Mediterranean world.</p>
<p>Remember the Latin word for Phoenician was Punic, so that&rsquo;s the source of the name of</p>
<p>these wars.</p>
<p>The first war was fought over control of the island of Sicily.</p>
<p>And the first Punic War was actually a naval war primarily.</p>
<p>This was something the Romans were not accustomed to, and the Romans actually had to build a</p>
<p>navy to fight the Carthaginians, but they proved successful and won control of Sicily</p>
<p>from Carthage.</p>
<p>In the second Punic War, the famous Carthaginian leader Hannibal decided to avoid a fight at</p>
<p>sea and he surprised the Romans by mounting an armed expedition from Spain and he traveled</p>
<p>northward through southern France and famously crossed the Alps with a contingent of war</p>
<p>elephants and engaged the Romans from the north.</p>
<p>Hannibal actually defeated the Romans in battle after battle, but he was not able to or wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>willing to actually invade Rome itself.</p>
<p>He apparently expected an uprising from within Italy by the various peoples who had been</p>
<p>conquered by the Romans.</p>
<p>He thought that these people would join his effort to overthrow and defeat the Romans,</p>
<p>but that never really happened, and the fact that there was no such uprising is another</p>
<p>indication of the success of the Romanization process I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>At least Rome offered the benefits of Roman citizenship and Roman civilization, so a popular</p>
<p>uprising within Italy never happened.</p>
<p>As I said, at various points Hannibal could have headed straight for Rome, but for whatever</p>
<p>reason he held back, and some language historians note at this point that had Hannibal not</p>
<p>held back, had he actually gone to Rome and defeated the Roman army and took control</p>
<p>of the city, then much of modern Western Europe might be speaking some version of Phoenician</p>
<p>today rather than a version of Latin.</p>
<p>But of course that&rsquo;s not what happened.</p>
<p>Instead of bringing a decisive end to the war, Hannibal fought an inconclusive war in</p>
<p>Italy for sixteen years.</p>
<p>Given a perhaps unintended reprieve by Hannibal, Rome put a general named Scipio in charge</p>
<p>of the army, and Rome began to build up its naval fleet.</p>
<p>And as Rome began to rebuild its army and navy, the tides started to shift in favor</p>
<p>of Rome.</p>
<p>Under Scipio, Rome defeated and took control of the Carthage territories in Spain, which</p>
<p>interrupted Hannibal&rsquo;s supply lines.</p>
<p>And Rome finally gathered its rebuilt army and navy, but rather than attack Hannibal</p>
<p>directly in Italy, they decided instead to head southward across the Mediterranean for</p>
<p>Carthage itself.</p>
<p>And this caused Hannibal to return to North Africa to engage the Romans there.</p>
<p>And Hannibal was finally defeated by the Romans in Carthage to end the Second Punic War.</p>
<p>And a few decades passed before Rome put the final nail in Carthage&rsquo;s coffin with the</p>
<p>third and final Punic War.</p>
<p>Rome was able to assume control of North Africa in this process.</p>
<p>And Rome burned the city of Carthage to the ground, and according to historical legend,</p>
<p>Rome sowed the fields of Carthage with salt to make sure nothing would ever grow there.</p>
<p>Most modern historians don&rsquo;t believe the fields were actually salted, but there&rsquo;s no doubt</p>
<p>that the devastation was massive.</p>
<p>Carthage was never able to recover from the Punic Wars.</p>
<p>And with Carthage removed as a threat to Rome, the Roman Empire was able to expand its influence</p>
<p>across the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>And by the end of the Third Punic War, Rome had extended its control to Greece.</p>
<p>And with Carthage out of the way, Egypt and much of the Middle East would also fall to</p>
<p>the Roman armies.</p>
<p>The entire Mediterranean was soon under the control of Rome.</p>
<p>So with the Mediterranean under its control, Rome&rsquo;s attention soon turned to the north,</p>
<p>to the vast region occupied by those hated Gauls who had sacked Rome a few centuries</p>
<p>earlier.</p>
<p>It would take an ambitious and shrewd military and political leader to conquer that region.</p>
<p>And Rome happened to have just such a person.</p>
<p>His name was Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>And Caesar&rsquo;s expeditions to the north brought the Romans into direct contact with the Celtic-speaking</p>
<p>tribes of Central and Western Europe, and eventually brought the Romans into contact</p>
<p>with the Germanic-speaking tribes of Northern Europe.</p>
<p>Caesar&rsquo;s expeditions also saw the first attempt by Rome to colonize southern Britain.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now at the point where we need to begin looking at the Celts, the Germanic tribes,</p>
<p>and early Roman Britain.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re getting very close to the period of Old English, but we&rsquo;re not quite there</p>
<p>yet.</p>
<p>Next time, I&rsquo;m going to focus on the Celtic tribes who occupied much of Europe during</p>
<p>this period.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to look at Caesar&rsquo;s expeditions to conquer those continental Celts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to continue to look at Latin and its influence as it began to spread into</p>
<p>Western Europe.</p>
<p>So until next time, thanks for listening to the History of English Podcast.</p>
