    <p>Jake out. Do you have intros today? No, I don&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>for intros. Oh, come on. Alright, fine. He started as a</p>
<p>nerd with no followers on Twitter. Now, he&rsquo;s a nerd that</p>
<p>gets recognized when leaving the shitter. He turned water into</p>
<p>wine. He just wants to please us. Now, he&rsquo;s a mixture of</p>
<p>Kermit the Frog and a science nerd Jesus. He&rsquo;s the man with</p>
<p>the stands, the queen of the Sultan of Science, the prince</p>
<p>of Prozac, the lord of Lexapro. He gets stops for selfies all</p>
<p>over town. My producer fee gave him a mental breakdown. The</p>
<p>Zoltan of Zoloft, Mr. David Rehberg. It&rsquo;s true. It did give</p>
<p>me a breakdown. It&rsquo;s true. But you&rsquo;re over it now. You just</p>
<p>name dropped three SSRIs in that intro. It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Well, I talked to his, I talked to his psychiatrist. He said</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s working on the cocktail. Yeah, save some for me. Oh, oh,</p>
<p>you? Speaking of you, he&rsquo;s got very quick wit and impeccable</p>
<p>grammar. Known for building beautiful products that don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work. Oh my god. Like Colin and Yammer. He used to invest in</p>
<p>sass quite a lot. Now, he&rsquo;s fighting a brigade of Ukraine</p>
<p>bots. He&rsquo;s spending so much time in his bunker. It&rsquo;s starting to</p>
<p>get smelly. We see him only three times a week. All in</p>
<p>Tucker and Megyn Kelly. He&rsquo;d invest in your startup if you</p>
<p>had the knack. But right now, he needs that cash for his GOP</p>
<p>super pack. The world&rsquo;s biggest asshole, the rain man himself,</p>
<p>Mr. David Sacks. That&rsquo;s a repeat joke. That&rsquo;s not. I know</p>
<p>but it kills every time. So, I&rsquo;m gonna keep repeating it</p>
<p>until you stop laughing. His wardrobe cost so much, he can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get into a scuffle. He bought all his friends with his white</p>
<p>truffles. He scaled Facebook to a billy. That wine collection,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just **** silly. He&rsquo;s on the world tour meeting with</p>
<p>princes and kings. Is he talking luxury sweaters or maybe</p>
<p>bigger things? The dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
<p>That was really nice actually. Wow, I mean, I appreciate you.</p>
<p>You were obviously trying to get invited to dinner tonight.</p>
<p>Exactly. I&rsquo;m trying to get off the alternate list. He&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to get off the alternate. The email was harsh. Nine was</p>
<p>alternate. I know you would troll me. I know I have a seat.</p>
<p>As for me, I&rsquo;m the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator who can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>take a note. Compared to these guys, I&rsquo;m just a millionaire</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s broke. The all-in summit almost killed us but we came</p>
<p>back from death&rsquo;s door. I knew we peaked when Freeberg took</p>
<p>over the dance floor. We love the fans but we love each other</p>
<p>more. Thanks for the first 100 fellas. Here&rsquo;s to 100 more.</p>
<p>Really good. Wow. That&rsquo;s really really good. Look at you</p>
<p>touching him. Surprisingly, you became prepared today. First</p>
<p>time. He fought after 100 episodes. He finally figured</p>
<p>out he has to prepare. So, that was the note. Just prepare. Just</p>
<p>do your job. Just do your job. Do your job. Do your job. Do</p>
<p>your unremunerated job. Do your job. Speaking of</p>
<p>unremunerated, we heard that somebody&rsquo;s grifting off the pod.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. So, good point. What we heard, Sax, is that you got</p>
<p>a big care package for Moncler. Yeah, that&rsquo;s true. What? What I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re all gonna declare today is that we all wanna wet</p>
<p>our beak and if Moncler sends each of us a care package, we</p>
<p>will all wear Moncler gear at episode 101. Moncler&rsquo;s my brand.</p>
<p>Google your own brand. Yeah, we decided to. Jamas got Laura</p>
<p>Piano. I got Moncler. You go get like, you know, Izod or</p>
<p>something. I don&rsquo;t know. Actually, I got Izod too. You</p>
<p>have to do this. I have Uniclo. I got Uniclo. We got Gap Kids</p>
<p>for J Cal. Sax, you didn&rsquo;t you didn&rsquo;t declare your Moncler</p>
<p>gift package by the way. No, I did. That was the discovery we</p>
<p>made this weekend. So, I wanna thank I wanna thank the folks</p>
<p>at there&rsquo;s a company called and they sent me this gift.</p>
<p>Actually, this hoodie, this Moncler hoodie which I never</p>
<p>seen before. What is this plug you? They send you a hoodie for</p>
<p>$1200 and they get a $50,000 plug? There are several other</p>
<p>things that I&rsquo;ll bring you guys each a shirt from Moncler. Oh,</p>
<p>we get the shirt. Yeah. These guys are getting hundreds of</p>
<p>thousands of dollars of revenue. Yeah. How bad is your</p>
<p>portfolio that you&rsquo;re grifting? Did you put this Moncler stuff</p>
<p>onto like eBay after you got it? I was already wearing it and</p>
<p>they sent me more. So, I&rsquo;m gonna wear this hoodie. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty cool. What can I say? I&rsquo;m not gonna. It&rsquo;s three cents</p>
<p>and all of a sudden, you&rsquo;re grifting. I just for everyone</p>
<p>listening, I&rsquo;m looking for a wardrobe. Okay, just send my</p>
<p>package to my office. Let me tell you something. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>upgrade that&rsquo;s gonna help Freeberg. I think you&rsquo;re ****</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m gonna bring you guys Moncler shirts to the poker</p>
<p>game tonight. Gee, thanks, Sax. Appreciate that. How did how</p>
<p>did you guys even find out that he got this gift? We&rsquo;re at his</p>
<p>Fleet Week party and there was a Blue Angels party and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>someone there who started telling me like, did you hear</p>
<p>that Sax got this whole thing? Oh, somebody. There&rsquo;s a rat?</p>
<p>There was a rat. I&rsquo;m not telling you. Oh, there&rsquo;s a rat.</p>
<p>But someone told me. He&rsquo;s got a mole. Yeah. We were talking</p>
<p>about the podcast. We were talking about Sax&rsquo;s hat. 100%</p>
<p>it was Woolway. 100%. No, no, it wasn&rsquo;t Woolway. No. 100%.</p>
<p>Was it Jeff? No, one of my one of my friends was in the man</p>
<p>cave and he saw this like care package from Moncler and he</p>
<p>really admired this like jacket. It was like a puffer</p>
<p>jacket but with like wool sleeves or something. Oh, so you</p>
<p>gave it to him? And I gave it to him. He liked it so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, here, you take it. He&rsquo;s not even on the pod. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even on the pod. Give it to producer Nick. So, he was</p>
<p>walking around with it. He was really appreciative. So, maybe</p>
<p>he said something or or what? I can&rsquo;t believe this. The grift</p>
<p>is crazy. Let&rsquo;s just say there was a lot of conversations</p>
<p>going on about your care package, Sax. Well, and it</p>
<p>makes us wonder, Sax. Are there other care packages that have</p>
<p>come in and like. Or Chamath. Have you been promoting other</p>
<p>stuff on here? So, who makes the couch behind you? Magazines</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to read. Chamath, how much of your</p>
<p>Loro Piano have you actually paid for over the past year?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s. 100%. I would never, I would never accept it for free.</p>
<p>Oh. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s important. Look, wait, no, all joking aside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard if you&rsquo;re running a clothing business especially if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like a small niche provider of stuff. So, you know,</p>
<p>you have a responsibility to pay for this stuff not to grift</p>
<p>and get it for free. No, I know. When I was at the Loro</p>
<p>Piano store on 57th Street in Manhattan, the 18,000 square</p>
<p>foot store, I was thinking the same thing. These poor people,</p>
<p>how do they survive? Well, Loro Piano. 270 dollars square foot</p>
<p>rent. How are they making it? I would. Purveyors Friedberg.</p>
<p>Exploiting poor baby goats. Well, whatever. I mean, the fact</p>
<p>is the market&rsquo;s down. There&rsquo;s gonna be a little grifting on</p>
<p>the margins. It&rsquo;s understandable. Let your</p>
<p>winners ride. Rain Man David Saxon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in. Freeberg, he loves to produce every</p>
<p>seventeenth episode. He does a great job. Oh, no, I like to</p>
<p>prepare or at least know what the heck we&rsquo;re gonna talk about</p>
<p>when we get together. And here are some prompts. He he got</p>
<p>these prompts because he&rsquo;s not doing his job. Yeah. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Sorry. Oh god. Alright. So, first up on Freeberg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>curiousness. This is Freeberg. This is how you&rsquo;re gonna do it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s skip ahead to the next section. Come on. No, no, no.</p>
<p>Okay. So, go, go, go. Why do you think Chamath people love</p>
<p>the podcast? Why do you think they listen? Why do you think</p>
<p>they love it? What what is the the phenomenon? What what</p>
<p>lightning has been captured in this bottle? First is I think</p>
<p>that they appreciate our friendship. It&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>odd and quirky. And I think a lot of, you know, it maps to</p>
<p>like relationships that they have amongst their own friends.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s what makes it relatable. But the second is</p>
<p>that all of us uniquely have a point of view about stuff that</p>
<p>matters more and more in the world. I think that&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>basics of it. Like, it&rsquo;s not like technology&rsquo;s going away.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s impact in the world is going away. And</p>
<p>the more it becomes mainstream, the more it&rsquo;s important for a</p>
<p>lot of folks to understand what&rsquo;s happening. And I think</p>
<p>we provide a pretty unfiltered view of it. And we do it where</p>
<p>and this is a lot of credit to Sax more than anyone else on</p>
<p>this show, has to take a counterpoint and steel man, what</p>
<p>would otherwise be controversial views. And if he</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have his three friends around him, that would make the</p>
<p>pod meaningfully worse, I think. Can you explain for people who</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what steel manning is what that means? Well, just</p>
<p>it just means like to have intellectual honesty around a</p>
<p>point of view, and actually put your best foot forward and</p>
<p>trying to explain it even when it&rsquo;s not orthodox, even when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not what the mainstream would say is right. And so what</p>
<p>it actually does is it creates a contrast against every other</p>
<p>alternative that you have to learn about things, which you</p>
<p>find incrementally is biased. And I think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>gotten right. We are for friends that have a reasonable point of</p>
<p>view rooted in some amount of success. And I think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>important because it gives us credibility. And we take all</p>
<p>sides of issues. Yeah. And oftentimes, it is not the</p>
<p>obvious, simple, reductive answer. And I think that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where it really shines. Just so people know about the steel man</p>
<p>arguments, want to make sure people credit. I think most</p>
<p>people refer to it as the act of presenting the other argument</p>
<p>in the strongest way possible to be intellectually honest, like</p>
<p>the opposite. Exactly. Because the way the way the debate</p>
<p>happens on Twitter, and so forth is it&rsquo;s almost like the</p>
<p>intellectual debate is being attacked, using opposition</p>
<p>research tactics, like it were a political campaign. So in</p>
<p>other words, they go back through anything you might have</p>
<p>said or written, take the the thing that was most wrong, or</p>
<p>least justifiable, or the thing they can even just take out of</p>
<p>context. And then they&rsquo;ll try to make it about that as opposed</p>
<p>to the argument you&rsquo;re actually making. And we just see this</p>
<p>tactic over and over again. And it&rsquo;s not an intellectually</p>
<p>rigorous way of having a debate about something, you don&rsquo;t learn</p>
<p>anything. Right. And deep down inside, you know that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>contrived. And that is the in a nutshell. So it does. It almost</p>
<p>in many ways has less to do with how good we are. But frankly,</p>
<p>how bad all the alternatives are. So even if you wanted to</p>
<p>learn about tech, and you go up and you sign up for these</p>
<p>newsletters, or if you look at some of these tech sites,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really terrible. And they have done an increasingly</p>
<p>terrible job over the last five years in telling the most</p>
<p>important things, the truth and everything in between. And so if</p>
<p>you can find a source for an hour a week, that is trying to</p>
<p>tell you how basically the world is going to come together in a</p>
<p>really integrated multifaceted way. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like we know better than other people. In fact,</p>
<p>many times, a lot of the criticism I get is, how dare you</p>
<p>talk about x, or how dare you talk about y? Because it makes</p>
<p>people who are experts in that field, you know, feel like, how</p>
<p>dare you come into my realm and even have an opinion on, you</p>
<p>know, what Russian politics was like in the 1980s. And those</p>
<p>things really annoy these folks, because they feel that those</p>
<p>opinions and that knowledge should be cordoned off and held</p>
<p>tightly as this secret that only they are allowed to talk about</p>
<p>into the world. And this is the point where with the internet,</p>
<p>all this knowledge is accessible. So the value of that</p>
<p>knowledge, in my opinion, is the least it&rsquo;s ever been. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>interpretation that&rsquo;s valuable. And it&rsquo;s the ability to actually</p>
<p>like think narratively around how all these things connect. And</p>
<p>this is where I give a lot of credit. I think you guys do an</p>
<p>incredible job. I think the way Freedbrook thinks is super</p>
<p>unique. I think the way that saxes thinks is unique. I think</p>
<p>J Cal, your courage to basically fight back is very special. All</p>
<p>of it together is a really unique recipe. It works. And</p>
<p>what I will tell you consistently is the number of</p>
<p>people that listen to this of import and influence. I am</p>
<p>constantly shocked. And if you are not sure of it, you need to</p>
<p>get out of this stupid little echo chamber of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>go to New York, go around the world. And if you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>right meetings, it&rsquo;s incredible how folks are getting educated</p>
<p>using this pot. And I think that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s really amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I think there&rsquo;s like, been a tendency in, like</p>
<p>what we call media today, historically, kind of, you know,</p>
<p>communication amongst humans. It was very slow for a</p>
<p>communication cycle to go from beginning to end to close</p>
<p>because we had print and books and then telegraphs and</p>
<p>telephones and then television and radio. And the internet, I</p>
<p>think, has really changed the cycle, the loop cycle to the</p>
<p>point that, you know, a story iterates and proliferates very</p>
<p>quickly. And a lot of people talk about the news cycle being</p>
<p>very short nowadays. And what that means is that there is a</p>
<p>group think approach to resolving to a point of view on</p>
<p>what the news is. So the news comes out, everyone iterates on</p>
<p>it, they form their point of view, and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s on the same point of view. And so there is no room</p>
<p>for dissent, or debate or discussion, because the cycle</p>
<p>closes so quickly, and everyone coalesces around the same point</p>
<p>of view. And nowadays, I think we see not just that unipolar</p>
<p>behavior, but we see this bipolar behavior, where everyone</p>
<p>coalesces on their point of view, and how their point of</p>
<p>view is, is the opposite of the other side. And everyone has</p>
<p>their own heuristic for what the other side is. There&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>populism versus elitism siding, there&rsquo;s this red versus blue</p>
<p>siding, there&rsquo;s this us versus them siding, US versus China</p>
<p>siding, everything is now bipolar. And so you very quickly</p>
<p>coalesce around what your poll says, and what your poll is</p>
<p>instructing you to believe. And that is what is fundamentally</p>
<p>wrong with how the system is working today. And I think what</p>
<p>people find refreshing about a discourse that doesn&rsquo;t succumb</p>
<p>to that bipolarity, as a standard, is that it provides</p>
<p>people the ability to have a real rational, out of sync point</p>
<p>of view, that maybe changes one&rsquo;s point of view and changes</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s mind in a meaningful way. And I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really missing today. And I think maybe sometimes we do a</p>
<p>good job, and we touch on that. And so that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>strive to do is to always try and avoid that bipolarity on</p>
<p>everything. You know, the Zen Buddhists call it dualistic</p>
<p>thinking, you know, the human brain, and generally, the</p>
<p>universe seems to evolve into this kind of dualism on</p>
<p>everything. And it&rsquo;s not really always the case that there are</p>
<p>shades of gray, that there is nuance, that there is a</p>
<p>complex dimensionality to things that I think people</p>
<p>really, if they take the time to understand, recognize that</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not left and right. Maybe it&rsquo;s not elite and</p>
<p>populism. Maybe it&rsquo;s not all black and white. And that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>important, hopefully framing that maybe we can bring, bring</p>
<p>bring to light through through our diagnosis of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in things right now. Yeah, I like to add to that. I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a ton of great journalism going out there. We</p>
<p>see it. There&rsquo;s a ton of great sub sacks out there. People go</p>
<p>deep, there&rsquo;s other great podcasts out there. And right</p>
<p>now, it&rsquo;s a tumultuous time for media journalism and getting</p>
<p>information and do what trust what sources do we actually</p>
<p>trust, who actually is thinking in a crisp way, and informing</p>
<p>people. And, you know, having been a former journalist, when</p>
<p>we were journalists, we knew that we would get 10 2030 40%</p>
<p>of a story, we would publish it, and we would try our best. But</p>
<p>journalism has changed dramatically in the last 20</p>
<p>years. And I can tell you journalism is dead. Sorry. Okay,</p>
<p>just I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. There&rsquo;s some great journalism</p>
<p>occurring. It&rsquo;s on the margins. It&rsquo;s irrelevant. And I&rsquo;ll tell</p>
<p>you why. Because the facts are known instantaneously, on</p>
<p>Twitter, and through the internet, we don&rsquo;t need people</p>
<p>to relay facts, we need people to wrap facts in context, and</p>
<p>allow us to come to our own conclusions. That&rsquo;s why I think</p>
<p>journalism isn&rsquo;t what it used to be. That&rsquo;s why people who are</p>
<p>historically journalists struggle, because now they</p>
<p>actually have to create context and narrative and have an</p>
<p>opinion. But when you publish that into the Wall Street</p>
<p>Journal, or the New York Times, it becomes very confusing. They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s what they were supposed to do. That&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>what they used to do. That&rsquo;s not how Pulitzer Prizes were</p>
<p>were historically given out. And that&rsquo;s why everybody then, you</p>
<p>know, rants and rails kind of going is, you know, if you if</p>
<p>you look at it, as journalists, people don&rsquo;t know this, but</p>
<p>journalists are being compensated, their little</p>
<p>salaries, in many cases are based on their follower</p>
<p>counts, they&rsquo;re based on what audience they&rsquo;re bringing to the</p>
<p>table. And you see this in Substack, Substack just said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to hire the top journalists on who have the most</p>
<p>followers on Twitter.</p>
<p>But you have to change the word so that you change how people</p>
<p>think about it. These people are not journalists. These people</p>
<p>are opinion makers.</p>
<p>Okay, in some cases, they&rsquo;re doing journalism. In some cases,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not. No, no, there are some cases where they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually doing real journalism. There are people doing</p>
<p>investigative reporting still, it&rsquo;s not the majority of what</p>
<p>you see, but it still exists. It&rsquo;s just a very much smaller</p>
<p>percentage. But putting that aside, if you think about but</p>
<p>wrap a virtuous blanket around every 1000 people because of the</p>
<p>acts of one, I&rsquo;m not and I&rsquo;m not I said, there&rsquo;s a range here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small percentage, but this there&rsquo;s what do you think</p>
<p>that percentage of content creation, I put it at 5%. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one out of 20. I&rsquo;m shocked. Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s less</p>
<p>than 1%. But let me just finish this one thought here. You know,</p>
<p>if you are going to be hired, and compensated, and we talk</p>
<p>about systems here a lot. So just thinking from first</p>
<p>principles, if you&rsquo;re a journalist, if you&rsquo;re a writer,</p>
<p>opinion writer, whatever you produce content for Wall Street</p>
<p>Journal for podcasts, etc. Today, let this sink in your</p>
<p>follower count is what your book advances, it&rsquo;s what your</p>
<p>compensation is. It&rsquo;s who hires you. Now, if that&rsquo;s the truth,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not all the time, but I think the majority of time</p>
<p>point at that your job is not to relay facts, we can get facts.</p>
<p>Exactly. Let me finish my thought here. And so then what</p>
<p>happens is how his follower account on Twitter actually</p>
<p>derived? How do you get that follower count by being tribal?</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s happened is journalists have became tribal,</p>
<p>they get big followings, they give spicy takes, they pick</p>
<p>aside, and then their compensation follows it. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why New York Times said, Can we all stop on Twitter, and</p>
<p>they literally put an edict out. Then you look at this</p>
<p>podcast. I think people look at us as you know, in their</p>
<p>mixture, podcasting long form, taking the time week after week</p>
<p>to spend 90 minutes chopping these things up. I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what to the original question, Friedberg you had is what people</p>
<p>find so great. I, when people ask me, I say it&rsquo;s really about</p>
<p>the fact that there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a friendships here. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny, but it&rsquo;s also informative. And it&rsquo;s insightful.</p>
<p>And at times, as you pointed out, Chamath, you know, random</p>
<p>acts of bravery and taking positions that are not popular.</p>
<p>And to think that you and Friedberg almost blew this up</p>
<p>over a few 100k. I didn&rsquo;t. Yeah, no, the two of you equally</p>
<p>should share. I wouldn&rsquo;t classify it that way. By the</p>
<p>way, here we go. Now the bad feelings are ready getting</p>
<p>spicy. I&rsquo;m more of an ethical framework. But yeah, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fine. Go ahead. Oh, even worse. Look at Chamath stirring the</p>
<p>pot. Just to chime in on this point. I mean, I think I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>violent agreement with you guys, but I&rsquo;d frame it a little</p>
<p>differently. I think the reason why people seek out our</p>
<p>podcasts and other podcasts and sub stacks is, and sort of this</p>
<p>kind of independent journalism and are willing to pay for it</p>
<p>is because the mainstream media has become totally</p>
<p>devoid of substance. It&rsquo;s as partisan and ideology and</p>
<p>ideologize as it&rsquo;s ever been. Reporters are extremely</p>
<p>ideological. You look at the New York Times, the Washington</p>
<p>Post, the, you know, major television networks, it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>kind of the same thing. And yeah, there is like, you know,</p>
<p>a little bit of an echo chamber problem in terms of the</p>
<p>partisan politics. But the mainstream media is the most</p>
<p>ideologize it&rsquo;s ever been. I mean, just to give you one</p>
<p>small example that we talked about in the pod, the you know,</p>
<p>we had two quarters of negative GDP growth, which the media is</p>
<p>always considered to be the definition of recession. And</p>
<p>then all of a sudden, they said, No, we can&rsquo;t know what a</p>
<p>recession is anymore, because they know that&rsquo;d be a horrible</p>
<p>headline for Biden right before the midterm elections. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>more of a partisan version, I think on the, you know, a more</p>
<p>ideological version would be just around this Ukraine war. I</p>
<p>mean, it&rsquo;s just incredible how biased the coverage is, they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even present the other side of the story, like this</p>
<p>called the Mearsheimer take about how we got to this point</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re in. So the American people just aren&rsquo;t being</p>
<p>informed at all. I, you know, we love to talk about how the</p>
<p>people of all these other countries are being</p>
<p>propagandized by their governments, we never talk about</p>
<p>how propagandized the American people are, the media does not</p>
<p>present the other side of the story at all, on how we got</p>
<p>into the Ukraine war, and how we&rsquo;re now at the brink of what</p>
<p>Biden calls Armageddon. Yeah. So how are we gonna get out of</p>
<p>it? How are we gonna get out of it? Any topic, by the way, I</p>
<p>just said that was my punch. So many topics that we see, you</p>
<p>know, effectively short form and short form, meaning it can</p>
<p>be presented in a soundbite or on a tick tock clip, or in a</p>
<p>couple paragraphs, where someone&rsquo;s attention span before</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s attention span lapses out, always misses the</p>
<p>dimensionality that got us to that point. And so there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>perspective, one point of view, on one dimension, and the</p>
<p>dimension like Saks is talking about, about the time and the</p>
<p>history of the dynamics of all the countries and all the</p>
<p>people and all the interactions that have happened for the past</p>
<p>couple of decades, that led up to this moment. But then this</p>
<p>moment is taken in its context alone, and reclassified as</p>
<p>being something that is good versus evil. It completely</p>
<p>misses the entire storyline of what happened. It&rsquo;s like going</p>
<p>to the end of a fairy tale and saying, here&rsquo;s this moment of</p>
<p>what happened. And all the buildup and all the things that</p>
<p>occurred are often missing and all the different sides of the</p>
<p>story are missing. And I think that that&rsquo;s really what makes</p>
<p>it so difficult today to feel like you can trust authority,</p>
<p>and that you can trust the media that&rsquo;s presented to you as a</p>
<p>consumer, not just in the US or in the West, but around the</p>
<p>world. Because there&rsquo;s so much that&rsquo;s left out and manipulated</p>
<p>and kept away. And what people are waking up to is the fact as</p>
<p>Chamath points out that so much of that information, the direct</p>
<p>information is available now. And so this investigation, this</p>
<p>ability to uncover the data, and the storylines and the</p>
<p>perspectives that are typically missing from one form of media</p>
<p>is making people realize that there&rsquo;s so much that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>left out the live 100% 100%. And I think in this podcast,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really shocking to people nowadays. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes maybe to some degree, hold our conversations</p>
<p>a little more appealing. I&rsquo;ll drop to you in a second there,</p>
<p>sex. But I did see this happen in three specific topics that we</p>
<p>discussed here. If you remember, we talked about abortion. And we</p>
<p>were on that topic very early. And no one wanted to talk. I</p>
<p>remember when we started talking about the number of weeks, maybe</p>
<p>how Europe looks at this. That wasn&rsquo;t part of the popular</p>
<p>conversation. It was always just are you against choice? Are you</p>
<p>for killing babies? It was like a very two dimensional. Look at</p>
<p>it. immigration, same thing. Nobody would talk about the</p>
<p>numbers. Nobody talked about recruitment. Nobody talked about</p>
<p>the point systems used in other countries. It was almost like</p>
<p>those basic things were not allowed to be discussed. Why</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t the media discuss those nuances and freedom of speech is</p>
<p>I think the biggest one, and the search for truth. You know,</p>
<p>nobody wants to talk about the fact that the ACLU used to</p>
<p>actually protect unpopular speech and unpopular speech is</p>
<p>you know, the hardest thing in the world to protect. But how</p>
<p>did that become something we can&rsquo;t even talk about now?</p>
<p>Right? And just the snap silencing of any opinion,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Chappelle, or, you know, pick a topic and freedom</p>
<p>of speech, Trump, etc. You know, who gets protection for freedom</p>
<p>of speech? And we&rsquo;ll talk about it later on the news with Alex</p>
<p>Jones, obviously, a very controversial topic as well.</p>
<p>Go ahead, sex, you want to add something to it?</p>
<p>Well, I think just to take this Ukraine situation as an example,</p>
<p>I think the media&rsquo;s biggest power is the power to define</p>
<p>when time begins on an issue. So well, like, right with</p>
<p>Ukraine, we&rsquo;re part of an escalatory spiral that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>going on for well, more than eight or nine months. This</p>
<p>issue has been going on since 2000 decade. Yeah, he&rsquo;s over a</p>
<p>decade. So in other words, if you come in, in like the seventh</p>
<p>inning, okay, so to Freeworks point, you come in at the end of</p>
<p>the story, and it&rsquo;s been an escalatory spiral. But the media</p>
<p>just pretends like time begins on February 24. Of course,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a certain kind of view on the subject. Whereas</p>
<p>if you know the history of the situation, if you know that back</p>
<p>in the 1990s, you had people like George Kennan, who was the</p>
<p>architect of our Cold War containment policy, you had</p>
<p>William J. Perry was Bill Clinton&rsquo;s Defense Secretary, you</p>
<p>had Henry Kissinger, you had john Mearsheimer all warn that</p>
<p>bringing NATO right up to Russia&rsquo;s front porch was</p>
<p>extremely provocative to them that they would see that as a</p>
<p>provocation, it would eventually lead to a moment of crisis.</p>
<p>When that moment of crisis finally came, you know, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not told that this was predicted. We&rsquo;re told that</p>
<p>anyone who says that this war has anything to do with NATO</p>
<p>expansion is basically a Putin apologist and is spouting Putin</p>
<p>talking points. All right, let&rsquo;s not let&rsquo;s not let&rsquo;s save some of</p>
<p>that for the Ukraine talk we&rsquo;re going to talk about. No, but I</p>
<p>get your point. You could agree or disagree with that take. But</p>
<p>the point is, the media doesn&rsquo;t even portray it. They really</p>
<p>just pick a side. And they I think I like your analogy of</p>
<p>like just coming in for the last 15 minutes of the game. And</p>
<p>just describing that, you know, we need to have a deeper</p>
<p>discussion of how did we get here? How did we get here on</p>
<p>immigration? Why don&rsquo;t we have a point system? Why do we look</p>
<p>at people suddenly coming from south of the border differently</p>
<p>than we did just 20 years ago? How did that become a</p>
<p>politicized issue? What&rsquo;s the right solution here? Especially</p>
<p>if we can&rsquo;t hire people for basic jobs in the United States?</p>
<p>Everybody wants to know this question, what&rsquo;s your favorite</p>
<p>you have a favorite moment, or a least favorite moment, a great</p>
<p>moment in the show history. And then I guess we&rsquo;ll move on</p>
<p>maybe to some audience questions here. But let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s get this</p>
<p>one because an embarrassing moment, your favorite moment,</p>
<p>your least favorite moment of a moment now you look back on and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re particularly proud of tomorrow.</p>
<p>I love the cold opens. I think that they are unbelievably human</p>
<p>and funny and normalizing. They are by far the best part of the</p>
<p>pod in life. And yeah, that&rsquo;s my that&rsquo;s my absolute favorite</p>
<p>part by by like, miles and miles.</p>
<p>Ah, it&rsquo;s actually got a favorite moment other than Ukraine.</p>
<p>Other than Ukraine. I know you got Ukraine on the brain.</p>
<p>Probably when you started talking like Joe Pesci.</p>
<p>The Joe Pesci voice.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do it on command. I&rsquo;m not your monkey sacks. Don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>talk to me like that. I&rsquo;ll get a fucking bad idea.</p>
<p>No, seriously, you have any other favorite moments?</p>
<p>Or things you&rsquo;re particularly proud of things that people tell</p>
<p>you, you know, hey, I love what do you I love this part of the</p>
<p>show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also proud that we we were able to air our dirty laundry a</p>
<p>little bit in public and still get over ourselves and our own</p>
<p>egos. And we&rsquo;re still here. I think that takes a lot of</p>
<p>courage and a little bit of a little bit of maturity that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not in public visibility all the time. In the media.</p>
<p>I like I like that sentiment a lot. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>pressure. Yeah, they were uncomfortable about it. You know,</p>
<p>I I think there&rsquo;s a lot of personal growth that&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>here for all of everybody involved. Yeah.</p>
<p>Freeberg, you got a favorite moment other, you know, I like</p>
<p>it when you and sex fight. That&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s your least</p>
<p>favorite moment when we are literally turn I turn my</p>
<p>headphones off and I like do some emailing. It really is just</p>
<p>it really is just this political thing. But yeah, it does come</p>
<p>up. You know, I don&rsquo;t like the fact the moments I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>interrupted by you that like that just happened five seconds</p>
<p>ago. Like, you know, those are usually pretty tough. Go ahead.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I what I did enjoy. I did enjoy meeting</p>
<p>people at the summit who shared that this has been like a really</p>
<p>important thing for them to listen to. I think I was at a</p>
<p>Pete&rsquo;s coffee in the city and some guy came up to me. This was</p>
<p>early after early when we were doing the podcast. And he was</p>
<p>like, listening to you guys has really helped me get through</p>
<p>COVID. And he was like locked in his apartment. And he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a lot of friends. And he didn&rsquo;t have a lot of people to</p>
<p>talk with. And just being able to hear through, you know, kind</p>
<p>of a good conversation around when&rsquo;s this going to end? How&rsquo;s</p>
<p>COVID gonna? You know, what&rsquo;s going to change in the city and</p>
<p>hearing our friendship really made a big difference for him.</p>
<p>And it was actually really interesting. That was off the</p>
<p>show. But it made me realize that the show actually is</p>
<p>impactful, and helpful and made gave me kind of the energy to</p>
<p>keep going, even though I&rsquo;ve had frustrations in the past. So I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know. I like I like those moments a lot, to be honest.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s real value here for people. I also I thought the</p>
<p>summit was a lot of fun. I mean, I had a good time.</p>
<p>But you know, it&rsquo;s, I think we&rsquo;re steering towards, I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re steering towards summit 2023. That was me starting the</p>
<p>pot a little bit. Towards 2021. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, you do</p>
<p>it, you produce it or you hire a producer, I&rsquo;ll show up. I&rsquo;m, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to make a producer fee, you can do it, you can take</p>
<p>the producer fee, whatever it is. All right, guys, I got a</p>
<p>couple of questions here from the audience. You guys see this</p>
<p>list? Yeah, we stand out for you guys. Well, you pick you pick.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a question. We got it over email from Nathan. And</p>
<p>Nathan said, we know the reasons. The reason you guys</p>
<p>started the pod, what is the motivation of each bestie to</p>
<p>continue doing it every week?</p>
<p>Now I ask myself that every week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about taking a break, not because I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>doing it, but it is time consuming. And I do want time to</p>
<p>get back to doing some business writing. I was on a pretty good</p>
<p>track to publish a book about SAS. Before we started doing the</p>
<p>pod, I had written a lot of business blogs. And this is</p>
<p>kind of taking a break. What? How many weeks? 10 weeks? What</p>
<p>are you thinking? Maybe like a month or something? Yeah. Oh,</p>
<p>four weeks. You can take that&rsquo;s no big deal. Maybe I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>for the time. I&rsquo;ve got like a right now. It&rsquo;s like doing</p>
<p>jumping jacks in his backyard and put me in the game. Well, we</p>
<p>could do that. I mean, I&rsquo;ve got like five half written business</p>
<p>blogs in my hopper that I really want to finish. And so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>The show does take a lot of cognitive energy is what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying. It takes a lot of those</p>
<p>out of your time each week, sex.</p>
<p>I mean, as you guys know, the taping is only a couple hours,</p>
<p>but then it&rsquo;s just keeping track of all the issues. And then,</p>
<p>you know, if I&rsquo;m preparing takes for this pod, I also turn some</p>
<p>of those takes into articles. This is like for Newsweek, or</p>
<p>the American conservative, whatever. So I&rsquo;m responding a</p>
<p>lot and responding, responding, and then I&rsquo;m tweeting takes as</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming up with them.</p>
<p>This is my point, which is, I think the, the load for sacks,</p>
<p>because he is the most heterodox is the heaviest. And this is</p>
<p>like poorly understood. It&rsquo;s easy to just basically be on the</p>
<p>side of the current conventional wisdom, or to not have an</p>
<p>opinion and to talk about things that are orthogonal. But David</p>
<p>is consistently the one that wades into the middle of the</p>
<p>ocean. And it is, I can, I can understand why you find it</p>
<p>exhausting. No, because he gets dragged under. No, Jason, he has</p>
<p>to be more prepared than the rest of us.</p>
<p>Yes, because he is more open to the attacks from all of these</p>
<p>nitwits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true. I mean, you know, on every day on Twitter, I&rsquo;m being</p>
<p>told these are these are like uninformed nitwits, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the cancer, the cancer of people who comment on Twitter</p>
<p>is the following. They suffer from the worst kind of cancer,</p>
<p>which is a lack of belief in themselves. And so what they do</p>
<p>is they point to other people and try to convince yet more</p>
<p>people to not believe in them. But that has nothing to do with</p>
<p>anything. It&rsquo;s just misdirection from their core</p>
<p>problem, which is they don&rsquo;t believe in themselves. And so,</p>
<p>you know, David has to fight all of that stuff off, but he has</p>
<p>to fight it off with logic, which must be exhausting. You</p>
<p>know, my approach has just been to turn off comments and to not</p>
<p>start. This is the single biggest problem, I think, with</p>
<p>social media is it&rsquo;s at this heightened point, where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this virulent strain of a lack of belief in oneself that</p>
<p>manifests in this hatred that you direct to anybody else that</p>
<p>believes in interesting, interesting theory.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I would just just to add to that, you know, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like I haven&rsquo;t heard any of the arguments that they&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>No, I guarantee you, they have not heard the arguments I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>making. But I&rsquo;ve heard all the arguments are 100% I&rsquo;m totally</p>
<p>familiar with 1938, Munich, Neville Chamberlain, all this</p>
<p>kind of stuff. I just don&rsquo;t think that is the correct</p>
<p>understanding of what&rsquo;s happening right now. I think the</p>
<p>correct historical analogy is either 1914 with World War One</p>
<p>and the blank check guarantee, or is 1962, the Cuban Missile</p>
<p>Crisis, the people on the other side, generally don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand that they are just kind of part of this, like</p>
<p>Twitter mob, who&rsquo;s buying into the current thing and whatever</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re told by the media. So it is it is a little bit</p>
<p>exhausting. I think that that&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t realize is,</p>
<p>you know, you when this thing got very popular, the two or</p>
<p>three days after an episode comes out becomes your texts,</p>
<p>your email, your DMS, and your replies become filled,</p>
<p>especially again, I would I would encourage you to keep</p>
<p>doing this thing. And just to turn off comments and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look back. Yeah, it&rsquo;s hard for them. It&rsquo;s hard for the first</p>
<p>few weeks. And then you realize 99% of people who comment have</p>
<p>nothing important or useful or interesting to say, like zero,</p>
<p>like negative zero. And you forget that there&rsquo;s like 99.999%</p>
<p>of the world that just reads your content, and couldn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>care about their comments. Yeah, and I would just I would</p>
<p>focus on what you have to say is the point and ignore and</p>
<p>ignore all these other Twitter agree that would make it less</p>
<p>exhausting, but it would still be time consuming. There is a</p>
<p>bunch of business blogs I want to get done. So I mean, I said</p>
<p>you take two weeks off, you come back and see how you feel. I</p>
<p>mean, you can do it week by week to I mean, just take one</p>
<p>week off and see it. See, I think you&rsquo;ll I think you&rsquo;ll I</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;ll be back. He&rsquo;ll be back. Great. Great. Great</p>
<p>question from Nathan. Thank you for your participation. Yes,</p>
<p>Nathan. Next question. I actually like this one. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to pull it out. It&rsquo;s an email question from Juan T.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, want to want to build girly recently put out a piece</p>
<p>explaining how this might be as good a time as in a decade to</p>
<p>build a company. How are you guys seeing your own portfolio</p>
<p>companies trying to take advantage of the situation? And</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll add Do you guys agree? And how do you think</p>
<p>about this as a moment for company building?</p>
<p>I could take that one. I am seeing a lot of the companies</p>
<p>that were you had done a great job racing around seed round</p>
<p>series a never got product market fit now wrap it up,</p>
<p>right? They&rsquo;re shutting down. They&rsquo;re doing the wind down</p>
<p>process. And then we&rsquo;re seeing lists of very talented people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about this before on the show, the</p>
<p>consolidation of talent behind the winning ideas, the</p>
<p>experiments that actually worked products that got some</p>
<p>traction are now having an easier time hiring talent. And</p>
<p>so to Bill&rsquo;s point, he&rsquo;s got a lot more experience in this than</p>
<p>the four of us put together is absolutely right when you build</p>
<p>in this down market. Yeah, it&rsquo;s harder to raise money, of</p>
<p>course. But talent is what makes great products and products</p>
<p>that delight customers get the flywheel going. And if you</p>
<p>survive through this, and you have that talent, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to face 20 copycats. And there&rsquo;s not 50 new products</p>
<p>coming out a day, people have more time to actually engage and</p>
<p>try a product, which they&rsquo;ve been burnt out on and the</p>
<p>peanut butter spreading, you know, we have this thin layer of</p>
<p>peanut butter talent. Now it&rsquo;s getting consolidated in the</p>
<p>winter. So absolutely a great time for five CEOs and founders</p>
<p>or, you know, 10 founders across five companies to</p>
<p>consolidate down to two, do those tuck in acquisitions and</p>
<p>get focused and build really good teams and cut the weakest</p>
<p>people on the teams. There&rsquo;s a lot of weak talent that have</p>
<p>been overpaid, and aren&rsquo;t actually contributing to these</p>
<p>teams, and they need to get cut. And then you pull in the</p>
<p>all stars. It&rsquo;s a fantastic time. He&rsquo;s 100% right.</p>
<p>All of the if you look back in history, since 2000, all of the</p>
<p>best performing funds of all times were the ones that were</p>
<p>formed right in the middle of the downturns. Oh 3080 909.</p>
<p>These are the vintages that have always been the best. And what</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s a proxy for investing, which is, it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>hardest time right now. It&rsquo;s when you have the shakiest hand</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re writing the check. But it&rsquo;ll probably be where</p>
<p>all of the real money is made or the real generational wealth</p>
<p>both for the entrepreneurs who have the courage to start, and</p>
<p>the investors who have the courage to invest. There was a</p>
<p>story that I heard in New York, I was talking to a really well</p>
<p>known hedge fund, or family office. And they were talking</p>
<p>about how they were meeting with a CEO of a fintech unicorn,</p>
<p>very well known fintech unicorn. And they said they left</p>
<p>the meeting and they said, this person had an unbelievable</p>
<p>disrespect for money. And it was the most arrogant interaction</p>
<p>that they had ever heard and they said under no circumstances</p>
<p>would we invest in this guy in this company at any price. And</p>
<p>you know, lo and behold, a year later, that company is now</p>
<p>visibly going through a bunch of hiccups. And it just reminds</p>
<p>me that Jason we&rsquo;ve always had two problems when times are</p>
<p>good. Problem number one is that there&rsquo;s never been a check</p>
<p>and balance on that kind of behavior, a lack of respect for</p>
<p>capital, and a almost a disregard for business models,</p>
<p>which is just inexcusable. And I think it&rsquo;s partly the fault of</p>
<p>a very young entrepreneur, but it&rsquo;s also partly the fault of a</p>
<p>board who doesn&rsquo;t know how to direct that person enablement</p>
<p>Israel. Yeah. But then the second, the second thing is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve always had this, you know, this big tech put on the table</p>
<p>where every time you would try to really hone in on running a</p>
<p>lean, highly efficient organization, the alternative</p>
<p>would be to go work at, you know, Google, Facebook, Apple,</p>
<p>Amazon, Microsoft, where the terms are just completely</p>
<p>different to what the experience was, you know, at a</p>
<p>startup. And the bigger the gap, the harder it was for you to be</p>
<p>able to hire and retain good people without just copying</p>
<p>them. And now that that&rsquo;s also coming off the table, that is a</p>
<p>key moment. So Gurley is 100% right. There is no longer the</p>
<p>big tech put those are the generals that are about to get</p>
<p>shot over the next eight to 12 months, in my opinion, in the</p>
<p>public markets, in terms of market cap and employment and</p>
<p>perks. And then second is that these really thoughtful</p>
<p>investors who felt pretty deeply disrespected, will now be able</p>
<p>to call the shots. And these founders will have to come back</p>
<p>hat in hand and either apologize or just completely find a</p>
<p>different religion. And I think in that you&rsquo;ll have a lot of</p>
<p>amazing opportunities to build companies.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s well said tax. What are you saying?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s right. I mean, look, when times are as</p>
<p>frothy as they were, a lot of bad ideas get funded, and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of bad behavior that occurs. I don&rsquo;t think all</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s intentional. Some of it is just the lack of discipline</p>
<p>that when capital is so freely available, people are building</p>
<p>their businesses in ways that were optimizing solely for one</p>
<p>variable, which was top line growth, they just weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>paying enough attention to gross margins or burn. And when</p>
<p>you then have a downturn, and capital is not so available,</p>
<p>you have to build your business in a much more capital</p>
<p>efficient way. And you can&rsquo;t create fake businesses where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re buying growth. That&rsquo;s not economically justified, you</p>
<p>know, where you&rsquo;ve got negative unit economics around the</p>
<p>growth. So I think that this downturn is going to create a</p>
<p>shakeout, it&rsquo;s gonna weed out bad ideas, bad practices, and,</p>
<p>and a lack of focus, bad boards, and</p>
<p>or, or no boards,</p>
<p>one trick ponies, you know, there&rsquo;s just a lot of one trick</p>
<p>ponies out there who&rsquo;ve optimized growth, but don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a real business. And it&rsquo;s going to require, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>require entrepreneurs to, to play sort of more like</p>
<p>multivariable calculus or math, not just single variable,</p>
<p>it is extremely difficult to convert TVPI to DPI. You know,</p>
<p>the value of paper values into actual distributions, and that</p>
<p>takes a skilled hand. And I think that a lot of young folks</p>
<p>were hired into venture that fundamentally did not know what</p>
<p>they were doing. They&rsquo;ve neither ever built a company or</p>
<p>helped build a company or actually learned how to</p>
<p>generate returns. But they became very good at buying, you</p>
<p>know, free call options on companies. You know, I remember</p>
<p>like a lot of people, the way that you, these young people, I</p>
<p>remember I heard a story that you would sell against girly,</p>
<p>right? So let&rsquo;s just say you were trying to do a deal and</p>
<p>Bill gives you a term sheet from benchmark and you get, you</p>
<p>know, somebody else, the young folks were like, Oh, Bill&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>negative, and he doesn&rsquo;t get it. And they would try to</p>
<p>convince these entrepreneurs that, you know, these rainy days</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t happen. My experience with girly is he is the most</p>
<p>sophisticated investor of our generation. And what I mean by</p>
<p>that is, you know, he was trained as an equity analyst</p>
<p>that really understood business models and cost of capital. And</p>
<p>so in a moment like this, the way that girly would help you on</p>
<p>a board is meaningfully more important than how some, you</p>
<p>know, middling VP at some random startup who&rsquo;s now a, you</p>
<p>know, junior partner at a venture firm, because that</p>
<p>person has literally no clue. And so these companies are going</p>
<p>to go through a very difficult moment, which again, is the</p>
<p>reason why a good steady hand who knows what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>will make a ton of money in this next cycle. And for people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know TV pi, let me just give you a quick</p>
<p>definition. This is the total value divided by the paid in</p>
<p>capital. So total value is distributions, like, hey, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your Robin Hood stock, here&rsquo;s your Uber stock, here&rsquo;s cash,</p>
<p>plus the net asset value, what&rsquo;s that fancy word for the value of</p>
<p>the shares of the companies that haven&rsquo;t had an exit. And so you</p>
<p>divide those two numbers, you get a ratio 1.5 1.2, etc. But to</p>
<p>Schmott&rsquo;s point, net asset value is debatable in some of these</p>
<p>right and distributions are what matter, you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>the the IRR, you got to you got to eat the stuff that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>distributed. Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s keep going. I&rsquo;ll do one more. I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>skip over. Well, I&rsquo;ll just the question on Twitter that got the</p>
<p>most votes was what&rsquo;s the exact net worth of each bestie, I</p>
<p>would make the case that that&rsquo;s probably not the best way to</p>
<p>measure oneself. And, you know, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna do it.</p>
<p>I also would argue that we&rsquo;re probably all exposed to a lot of</p>
<p>fuzzy math with private assets that we own. And in terms of</p>
<p>companies, we&rsquo;re in Paris, like, how does that correlate with</p>
<p>happiness in life? It doesn&rsquo;t, right? So it doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>question. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a big focus in terms of</p>
<p>objectives. I&rsquo;ll say the next one that got a lot of votes,</p>
<p>which I really like, it&rsquo;s a lagging indicator and a</p>
<p>byproduct of what we do. There are moments when what we do</p>
<p>reflects in value that frankly, where we are over earning. And</p>
<p>then there are periods where what we do is under reflected,</p>
<p>and we are under earning. And so the through line has to be</p>
<p>that you need to survive in both good times and bad times,</p>
<p>which means you got to like what you&rsquo;re doing. And if you get</p>
<p>caught up in a numerical number, there&rsquo;s all kinds of math you</p>
<p>can do to make it look a lot bigger than it is. But it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>meaningless. Yeah, I would argue you&rsquo;re as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actively developing yourself, over time, the weighing machine</p>
<p>will do its job. Somebody told me in my 20s. When I was at AOL,</p>
<p>he said, you know, if you&rsquo;re good, because at the time, I,</p>
<p>you know, I grew up on welfare, I thought the goal was to make</p>
<p>money. I didn&rsquo;t know any better. I&rsquo;ve learned later that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot more leading indicators of happiness and things that</p>
<p>actually cashier, create happiness, white truffles,</p>
<p>white truffles. I was gonna say friendship, my family, but yeah,</p>
<p>friendship and family laughs. I define it as laughs and</p>
<p>friendships, you know, friendships. But uh, but but he</p>
<p>said to me, you know, your goal should be to just be in the</p>
<p>upper few percent of your age bracket. And just enjoy what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing. And he said, let time take care of everything</p>
<p>else. Because as long as you find something you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>you decently enjoy and are good at, you&rsquo;ll just get better and</p>
<p>better at that thing. And then at some point, you know, you</p>
<p>will lose track of what the, you know, measurement of that is</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just too caught up in how much you enjoy doing</p>
<p>the thing. And I thought that he had no idea what he was talking</p>
<p>about. And now 25 years later, I can tell you he was totally</p>
<p>right. Totally right. Yeah. By the way, this, this was a</p>
<p>question I was trying to skip over. So no, but it led to a</p>
<p>good fork. Yeah. Okay. What is happiness? Yeah. Yeah. I think</p>
<p>after, you know, observing outcomes for 25 years in tech,</p>
<p>what I would say is that if you&rsquo;re smart, hardworking, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have behaviors that sabotage yourself, and you know, take</p>
<p>intelligent risks, you will be successful in this business. I</p>
<p>mean, technology is such a wind at your backs. It&rsquo;s such an</p>
<p>engine of wealth creation, how can you not do well, but the</p>
<p>exact magnitude of how well you do, I think is ultimately it is</p>
<p>substantially affected by timing. And, you know, like if</p>
<p>you were employee, whatever number x at Google, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to do better than most founders, even of a unicorn</p>
<p>company. And when you found your company, and then when you</p>
<p>exit what the market is doing, those things have a huge impact</p>
<p>on the act on the magnitude. So, you know, whether you end up</p>
<p>being, you know, a billionaire, a centimillionaire, you know, a</p>
<p>decamillionaire, whatever you want, those things are very</p>
<p>affected by timing and chance, but not whether you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be successful at a substantial level. And so it just, you</p>
<p>know, be smart, be hardworking, don&rsquo;t sabotage yourself, you</p>
<p>know, get into tech, and you will do well.</p>
<p>Trust the process, trust the exact amount of how well you do</p>
<p>will be dependent on some, you know, stochastic factors, but</p>
<p>not the fact that you&rsquo;re going to do well, we are enormous</p>
<p>beneficiaries of having been born when we were, because we</p>
<p>were a bunch of late 40 and early 50 somethings, that in the</p>
<p>prime of our career in tech, the Federal Reserve took rates to</p>
<p>zero. And we had no idea a priori how important that would</p>
<p>be in all of our outcomes. But they were, and even more</p>
<p>importantly, PCs, internet and mobile happened, all of that</p>
<p>hard work was done beforehand by an entire court of people</p>
<p>that had to fight much stronger headwinds than we had to fight.</p>
<p>So, you know, David, I just want to build on that, like we</p>
<p>were extraordinarily lucky. And so don&rsquo;t get caught up in that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all these factors you don&rsquo;t you cannot</p>
<p>control. I&rsquo;ll say one more thing that I think is the most</p>
<p>important observation I&rsquo;ve made, in terms of whatever it</p>
<p>is building wealth over time is to make sure you&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>equity in yourself. If you&rsquo;re in a services business, and every</p>
<p>day, and whether that&rsquo;s serving the clients of the company you</p>
<p>work for, or just serving clients on behalf of yourself,</p>
<p>and everything you do is a transaction. And that</p>
<p>transaction doesn&rsquo;t build on itself doesn&rsquo;t compound value in</p>
<p>some way, then you&rsquo;re missing out on an opportunity every year</p>
<p>that goes by that you&rsquo;re earning income, where you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>building equity is is a non compounding year. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>compounding equity value that I think ultimately pays off for</p>
<p>you as an individual. And I can give a lot of examples of this.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re in a, let&rsquo;s say a brokerage business, and you just</p>
<p>do deals, and you might make have a good year, you might have</p>
<p>a bad year, the real question you need to ask yourself is,</p>
<p>what is compounding? Are you growing a client base? Are you</p>
<p>growing your skill set? Are you next year able to do more</p>
<p>things or have more options than you had this year? And if the</p>
<p>number of options you have is declining or static every year,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re limiting your equity value. And that ultimately will</p>
<p>translate into limited wealth creation.</p>
<p>Can I chime in on that point around equity? So yeah, when I</p>
<p>discovered what equity was, this was when I was in law school.</p>
<p>And actually, the guy who explained to me was Antonio</p>
<p>Gracias. A light bulb really went off for me because my dad</p>
<p>is a doctor, and I was on a path to becoming a lawyer. And in</p>
<p>both those cases, you&rsquo;re a professional, the way you get</p>
<p>paid is you more or less charge an hourly rate. And so the</p>
<p>amount of money you can make is capped, right? Just take the</p>
<p>number of hours in the day and in the week, multiply it by your</p>
<p>rate, and that&rsquo;s the most money you can make in a year. And the</p>
<p>difference between that and equity is with equity, you own a</p>
<p>piece of a business. And that business could be ultimately</p>
<p>worth, you know, any amount. And so your equity could</p>
<p>therefore be worth virtually any amount. And so you&rsquo;re uncapped.</p>
<p>And so just, you know, if you want to have outside success,</p>
<p>you have to have equity in something. I think that is</p>
<p>exactly right. If you&rsquo;re just basically working for wages, you</p>
<p>even if you are the best at what you do, and you get paid an</p>
<p>insane hourly rate, you again, you can be successful, but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to be uncapped. And so that is the beauty.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of Silicon Valley is all these companies</p>
<p>offer equity to everybody.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just shares in something, you can actually get</p>
<p>equity and create leverage in your life. In this era, more</p>
<p>than any human has ever had in any era prior, because of</p>
<p>software and computing and automation, you can create a</p>
<p>website that prints cash for you every day, if you want it to,</p>
<p>you can create a service that you get leverage out of. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s equity value in that. And I think that&rsquo;s really key,</p>
<p>because then you can go build another one, another one, and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building value over time. And that&rsquo;s just the most</p>
<p>simplistic example of how technology today provides</p>
<p>leverage that can really allow anyone to pursue a path of</p>
<p>equity.</p>
<p>And I think you made a good point about what are you getting</p>
<p>leverage off of? Yeah, so there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a bunch of</p>
<p>different things.</p>
<p>It used to be labor, right?</p>
<p>So the old way was leverage off labor. And I guess if you were</p>
<p>to own like a consulting firm, that or like some sort of</p>
<p>factory, then the more people you have working, the more</p>
<p>money you&rsquo;d make. The other way would be like, you can get</p>
<p>leverage off capital, like a fund manager, or you can get</p>
<p>leverage off of technology, because software can basically</p>
<p>create these super scaled outcomes. So you need to figure</p>
<p>out like, what is it you&rsquo;re getting leverage off of?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll go. So I&rsquo;ll do the last one, which I thought was a</p>
<p>really good question. And it got a lot of votes from Marcos</p>
<p>Ortiz. If you had to start from scratch, no money, no</p>
<p>connections, only the knowledge you have right now, and 100</p>
<p>bucks, what would you build in 2022?</p>
<p>I would build something in energy transition or in life</p>
<p>sciences with $100.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would build a startup incubator, venture fund of some</p>
<p>type, a way to fund entrepreneurs and just be a</p>
<p>capital allocator much earlier in my career.</p>
<p>I would create a b2b software company that actually, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>already creating it. So I haven&rsquo;t unveiled it yet. But</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m incubating right now.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,</p>
<p>your beak. What is going on here? I haven&rsquo;t gotten the I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t gotten the subscription. Have you raised</p>
<p>money? I&rsquo;m not raised money yet. When I got my subscription</p>
<p>documents, sir, it&rsquo;s you can think of this idea as Yammer</p>
<p>2.0. So Jacob, you&rsquo;re not in because you criticize Yammer.</p>
<p>But it was a joke. I gave you the I let you win TechCrunch</p>
<ol start="50">
<li>I put the fucking fix it for you, David, just to put my</li>
</ol>
<p>pitch in. I ran aim and ICQ help Facebook was an investor</p>
<p>in Yammer was the series A investor in slack. So I&rsquo;m ready</p>
<p>for you. Yeah, you were there. You were there for us. And we</p>
<p>needed you back at Yammer days. Unlike J Cal.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? Your wife came to my mind.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, okay, you&rsquo;re all in. Saks has to win TechCrunch</p>
<ol start="50">
<li>Let me in. Let me do the round. You guys are in. Let me</li>
</ol>
<p>lead it. Let us do the pre round. We want to do the pre</p>
<p>round. Pre round. Pre round. Thank you. Did you just agree</p>
<p>on TV? Yes. Well, assuming on there&rsquo;s one thing you have to</p>
<p>do, which is you&rsquo;ve got to rip out slack and use this instead.</p>
<p>Yes. 100% 100% I will just say, you know, but I&rsquo;m gonna be very</p>
<p>honest with you. The day I left Facebook, I stopped using it.</p>
<p>The day we sold we distributed slack stopped using it. So don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about me. I am right. I am 100% aligned with you. I&rsquo;m all</p>
<p>in. I&rsquo;m all in. Absolutely. All right. Let&rsquo;s do the show. Let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>do the show. freeberg. You didn&rsquo;t answer that question.</p>
<p>What would you do? Well, actually, I would get some water</p>
<p>vaporizers and then I would get some molecule. So and I would</p>
<p>make a new super protein that was made out of guts. Sorry.</p>
<p>Keep going. I like it. I think it&rsquo;d be something with the</p>
<p>protein slurry. You&rsquo;d make some kind of steak that tastes</p>
<p>better than a slurry. It&rsquo;s something I would definitely</p>
<p>build a business again. I think the you know, the challenge is</p>
<p>as you move past that stage in your career where you know, you</p>
<p>have the willingness and the time to be 120% building one</p>
<p>product every day. It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s really hard to go back to that.</p>
<p>And I think if I was in a position again, where I had no</p>
<p>money and had no. I think that&rsquo;s the key part of the</p>
<p>question, not the $100 part. Yeah, I think I would go back to</p>
<p>building something. I do think the intersection of life</p>
<p>sciences with software creates this era of opportunity. It</p>
<p>would probably be something in the realm of AI ML meets life</p>
<p>sciences, where you can actually work in a leveraged way with</p>
<p>software to drive outcomes in these important markets. So I</p>
<p>would actually create free and I could have been we can get</p>
<p>started something. Maybe we can still. Oh, not too late. The</p>
<p>co founders,</p>
<p>sacks will let you in the pre round if you let us in your</p>
<p>pre round. Okay, sounds good. All right. You want to take us</p>
<p>forward? Should we go forward? Okay, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s on the</p>
<p>docket. We&rsquo;ve got Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. You had</p>
<p>Biden last week saying we&rsquo;re facing the risk of Armageddon.</p>
<p>How is that not the top story? Go taxi poop. Go take it. All</p>
<p>right, here we go. Let me just queue it up for sacks by last</p>
<p>week. So we&rsquo;re facing risk Armageddon. That&rsquo;s your tip.</p>
<p>Okay, we got and then and then Leon Panetta just let&rsquo;s teed</p>
<p>up Jake out. We don&rsquo;t need everyone knows what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Then you Leon Panetta just who was the former Secretary of</p>
<p>Defense and Director of Central Intelligence wrote an op ed for</p>
<p>Politico saying that intelligence analysts have now</p>
<p>raised the probability of a use of a tactical nuclear weapon in</p>
<p>Ukraine from one to 5% at the beginning of the war to 20 to</p>
<p>25%. Now is what he says. So and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d be saying</p>
<p>that. If this wasn&rsquo;t pretty much conventional wisdom in</p>
<p>Washington. Now, I mean, Panetta is sort of a very</p>
<p>respectable figure in the beltway. So you said it right</p>
<p>for the first time, I said that we&rsquo;re facing the most dangerous</p>
<p>situation and the highest risk of nuclear war since the Cuban</p>
<p>Missile Crisis. He called it the risk of Armageddon. The</p>
<p>problem is that nobody is willing to say what we should be</p>
<p>doing differently to avoid this situation. So you know, people</p>
<p>are always attacking us for having a point of view on foreign</p>
<p>policy. First of all, this affects us. I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not allowed to have a point of view. But you know, in</p>
<p>our business thinking where there&rsquo;s an existential issue,</p>
<p>you have the attitude of drop everything and figure this out.</p>
<p>If somebody told you that there&rsquo;s a 25% chance of your</p>
<p>company blowing up, maybe in the next few weeks, you would drop</p>
<p>everything and focus on that problem. But it&rsquo;s like, you</p>
<p>know, after the Armageddon comments, it&rsquo;s like, the media</p>
<p>just passed over it. It&rsquo;s like, oh, this is like, crazy Biden</p>
<p>or whatever it was minimized, it was contextualized, the White</p>
<p>House walked it back. Nobody&rsquo;s really focusing on this and what</p>
<p>we should be doing differently. And in fact, what Panetta</p>
<p>recommends, and Petraeus said the same thing, is that if Russia</p>
<p>uses attack nuke in Ukraine, then we should respond by</p>
<p>attacking Russia directly. Now, if we do that, we are literally</p>
<p>in World War Three. And remember, at the beginning of</p>
<p>the war, Biden was really clear that we weren&rsquo;t going to get</p>
<p>directly involved. He vetoed the idea correctly of the no fly</p>
<p>zone, which would have required us to shoot down Russian planes.</p>
<p>Biden, remember, he was asked in the press conference at the</p>
<p>beginning of the war by Lester Holt, he said, Holt said, you</p>
<p>know, Mr. President, what if Americans are trapped behind</p>
<p>enemy lines in Ukraine, would you send in American troops to</p>
<p>go get them? Biden said no, I think very properly said no,</p>
<p>because he said, listen, we do not want to risk World War Three.</p>
<p>But now because of mission creep and a slippery slope, and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all gotten more involved in this war, we&rsquo;ve gotten more</p>
<p>emotionally committed, you now have Panetta and Petraeus</p>
<p>calling for us to directly attack Russia and get in World</p>
<p>War Three, the Russians almost certainly would respond with</p>
<p>nuclear because that&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;ve got. They don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>conventional forces to stand up to us. So look at how close we</p>
<p>have now gotten to the brink of a nuclear showdown. And has</p>
<p>anybody reassessed? Is anyone calling for us to reevaluate?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the conversation which we&rsquo;re having right now.</p>
<p>And Freeberg, this brings up two points that I think you can</p>
<p>comment on Naval, actually, the founder of angel list angel</p>
<p>investor, and just public thinker, I would say public</p>
<p>intellectual, he came on to call him with the two of you. And he,</p>
<p>you know, outlined, like, who does get to have an opinion on</p>
<p>Ukraine and other issues, which has dovetailed with this, like</p>
<p>who gets to be an expert in the world today. And of course, at</p>
<p>the same time, not only sacks has been commenting on, hey,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the off ramp here? Elon has been talking about, hey, you</p>
<p>know, how do we get out of this? Do we have some votes? You know,</p>
<p>by these regions that have been annexed or that are in dispute?</p>
<p>AOC now is getting criticized on investor people shouting her</p>
<p>down at a public event today or yesterday, that she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>warmonger, and she won&rsquo;t speak out against war. How do you</p>
<p>frame the public dialogue about this freeberg? And then do you</p>
<p>see a potential off ramp here other than Putin leaves Russia,</p>
<p>which is I think the public stance by a lot of folks, you</p>
<p>know, Putin can end this, he just has to leave Ukraine in</p>
<p>order for this to end. So two questions there for you,</p>
<p>Freiberg, it&rsquo;s very hard to have good dialogue about any</p>
<p>situation where an argument could be made on the grounds of</p>
<p>morality, in an absolute sense, making it really difficult to</p>
<p>have a discourse around what the right thing to do is,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t agree fundamentally on the objective</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re shooting for. One side says the objective is to</p>
<p>preserve the integrity of democracy, and the freedom of</p>
<p>people. And the other side says the objective should be to</p>
<p>secure the interests of the West and the United States and</p>
<p>preserve the world from nuclear holocaust. I think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>makes this a challenging conversation. The objective can</p>
<p>be reframed. And then from that objective, each side can make</p>
<p>their own case without being forced to take in the point of</p>
<p>view of the other side. And it&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re at a bit of a</p>
<p>standstill. And it&rsquo;s also why it&rsquo;s so easy to get swept up in</p>
<p>a mass point of view, a coalesce point of view of the</p>
<p>masses that makes one feel good about what may end up being a</p>
<p>very bad situation. It feels good to say I&rsquo;m doing this for</p>
<p>freedom of the people, I&rsquo;m doing this to save lives. And</p>
<p>the end of the day, it may cause a nuclear war. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay, because I feel good going into this debate, that this is</p>
<p>the right thing. It&rsquo;s the morally superior thing to do.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s very hard is that we can&rsquo;t actually say, as a group,</p>
<p>our objective should be to preserve the integrity of</p>
<p>democracies around the world, to an extent, and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>nuanced point of view, to an extent means I&rsquo;m willing to</p>
<p>preserve the democracies through certain actions, but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>willing to cross a certain line. And absolutism doesn&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>come into play. That&rsquo;s what I think is making this such a very</p>
<p>difficult conversation. And it&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so hard to actually</p>
<p>have a conversation around it. And it&rsquo;s really, I would argue,</p>
<p>the most poignant and the most dramatic moment in what we</p>
<p>talked about earlier, which is this deep seated kind of, you</p>
<p>know, bipolarity. And once you&rsquo;re sitting on your pole, you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to come off and you don&rsquo;t realize that so much of</p>
<p>the dialogue is in this middle. And we have to come to some</p>
<p>point of view that maybe this isn&rsquo;t about an absolute outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not absolutely going to be nuclear war. And it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>absolutely going to be the end of democracy. There&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>conversation in the middle that&rsquo;s very difficult to have.</p>
<p>And people that work somewhere in the world, hopefully,</p>
<p>ambassadors, foreign policy people, State Department people,</p>
<p>hopefully are having the more nuanced critical conversation</p>
<p>about how do we resolve to the maximal outcome that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily take us to an absolute end.</p>
<p>Chamath to that point, it&rsquo;s going to be an imperfect outcome</p>
<p>here. I think this is much, much simpler than all of this.</p>
<p>Leon Panetta is a senior counselor to this defense</p>
<p>contracting agency called beacon global strategies who works on</p>
<p>behalf of Raytheon. I found that out while Friedberg was</p>
<p>talking in a two second Google search. I suspect that if you</p>
<p>looked for Petraeus is conflicts of interest, you would find</p>
<p>that through some Byzantine set of, you know, strategic</p>
<p>consulting organizations and whatnot. He also works on behalf</p>
<p>of the defense industry. So you have these people who will</p>
<p>generate more revenue and more profit if there is a massive</p>
<p>war. And those people have been trying to push us into a land</p>
<p>war in Europe since this whole thing started. And so this is</p>
<p>just yet another attempt. It&rsquo;s just the most final way of doing</p>
<p>it. So I would just encourage people whenever you see all</p>
<p>these folks clamoring for war, it&rsquo;s just to keep in mind that</p>
<p>they are riddled with conflict and that you can find it out.</p>
<p>Again, this information is sitting in plain sight on the</p>
<p>internet, and you can figure out whether this person is is</p>
<p>really advocating a truth that makes sense or they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>paid to shill a revenue generating mechanism for some</p>
<p>part of the military industrial sex, how much of this is people</p>
<p>talking their book, their book being the military industrial</p>
<p>complex in your mind?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big part of it. I think all these Washington</p>
<p>think tanks are funded by defense contractors. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s short sighted, obviously, because if it leads to a nuclear</p>
<p>war, there&rsquo;s no defense industry, there won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>anything left. So but look, I think that I think that</p>
<p>Washington is wired for war in part, because there&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>lobby for it for all these defense contractors. And what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the lobby for peace? I mean, there&rsquo;s no one really arguing</p>
<p>for peace.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Elon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s lobbying for peace. And I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>connect what may seem to disparate ideas together. But</p>
<p>the single biggest thing I think that will prevent nuclear war</p>
<p>is the inflation that we&rsquo;re feeling. And the reason is</p>
<p>because it allows the Fed, in my opinion, for the first time,</p>
<p>really, in the last 15 years, to act properly. And if they</p>
<p>hold the line, and they take interest rates to four or 5%,</p>
<p>I think one non obvious outcome of all of that is it becomes</p>
<p>extremely expensive, next to impossible to finance military</p>
<p>adventurism abroad. And that&rsquo;s a practical economic outcrop of</p>
<p>really, you know, meaningfully high rates greater than zero.</p>
<p>And so I actually think the reality is that for a lot of</p>
<p>these governments, the more that inflation sticks around, the</p>
<p>stickier it is, the higher rates are in general, the bigger the</p>
<p>problems at home are, and the less prone they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>likely, I actually think that explains that explains the</p>
<p>escalation of this rhetoric, because people want to try to</p>
<p>make this issue and put it on the table. But you understand</p>
<p>that, you know, these folks don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a 90% likelihood,</p>
<p>they go from 1% to 25%, which if you understand probabilities</p>
<p>is effectively a left tail risk that&rsquo;s effectively the same. And</p>
<p>the reason they&rsquo;re trying to do it is they&rsquo;re trying to get it</p>
<p>back, David, as you say, to timestamp it, to get it in front</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s perspectives to make it important, in a moment where</p>
<p>everybody increasingly, not just in the United States, but in the</p>
<p>UK, in Europe, are looking internally, and trying to figure</p>
<p>out how to keep their economies in a reasonably functioning way,</p>
<p>and how to make sure that their financial and other</p>
<p>infrastructure keeps working. So you&rsquo;re saying and that is not</p>
<p>necessarily a priority when rates are zero, but when rates</p>
<p>are 4%, I mean, just by the way, if you guys saw what happened</p>
<p>today, it was the competing of two narratives this week, there</p>
<p>was the financial narrative of the UK having to bail out their</p>
<p>pension system, right, of all of a sudden, the pensions being</p>
<p>forced sellers of those four sellers now, you know, spilling</p>
<p>into the United States debt markets around CLOs, and</p>
<p>collateralized loan obligations and junk debt, which then could</p>
<p>theoretically spill as a contagion to other parts of the</p>
<p>market, that was narrative one. And, and all of that, by the way,</p>
<p>is a result of hiding inflation, and the, you know, Fed moving up</p>
<p>rates, and, you know, other countries being forced to attack</p>
<p>inflation with higher rates and creating all these dislocations,</p>
<p>narrative one, versus narrative two, which is, hey, all of a</p>
<p>sudden, we have to put the nuclear risk on the table. And</p>
<p>if you actually saw the print that was spilled, the</p>
<p>disproportionate amount of the rhetoric actually focused on the</p>
<p>former narrative and not the latter. And so I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the these folks are escalating the rhetoric, in</p>
<p>order to kind of create an equality so that they get enough</p>
<p>print, they want that version of the outcome, what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is, you have the world saying, we can&rsquo;t afford to have this</p>
<p>conflict, we are broke, we&rsquo;ve got too many chaotic issues,</p>
<p>the world is saying, we are increasingly under enormous</p>
<p>domestic pressure. And as a result, we cannot spend on</p>
<p>things abroad, we can&rsquo;t afford this. And then the other side</p>
<p>saying, well, we need you to afford this. So nuclear is going</p>
<p>to happen, there&rsquo;s going to be a nuclear annihilation, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>small strain attention to this, there&rsquo;s a small strain of folks</p>
<p>who would economically benefit. Yes, we&rsquo;re now ratcheting up</p>
<p>their rhetoric so that that second path interesting more and</p>
<p>more on the table. What do you think of this? Freeberg this</p>
<p>analysis that Schmott has these two polar, these these two</p>
<p>groups vying for the attention and or budget of the world?</p>
<p>The military industrial complex?</p>
<p>Versus Yeah, citizens saying our country can&rsquo;t afford this, we</p>
<p>need to focus inward, not citizens, the central banks.</p>
<p>Okay, but I think the central banks influenced by citizens,</p>
<p>right? Like this is a whole system here we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>people are, you know, watching their pensions go away, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching jobs get cut.</p>
<p>If I was a betting man, I spent the I would guess that the next</p>
<p>half a trillion to $1 trillion that is spent in Western world</p>
<p>economies will be to subsidize something that&rsquo;s broken</p>
<p>internally inside of one of our countries, whether it&rsquo;s the UK</p>
<p>pension system, or whether it&rsquo;s the high yield credit markets,</p>
<p>and it will not be to finance military adventurism in Russia,</p>
<p>just to just hold on that point. So there&rsquo;s an article today in</p>
<p>the Washington Post about how the US government&rsquo;s debt service</p>
<p>is going to be around 570 billion this year, which is a 45%</p>
<p>increase. Biden&rsquo;s budget for 2023 is only 1.6 trillion. So</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about something like over a third now of the</p>
<p>official budget is already going to debt service,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not a variable, right? It&rsquo;s a variable, right?</p>
<p>Exactly. Because so much of it is, is, it&rsquo;s not locked in a</p>
<p>long term rate. So because interest rates have gone up so</p>
<p>much, the debt service gone up, and interest rates are still</p>
<p>going up. And so, you know, Druckenmiller had those points</p>
<p>around how the debt services within a decade is going to eat</p>
<p>up practically the whole federal budget. So Chamath is</p>
<p>right that we&rsquo;ve never really had to choose between guns and</p>
<p>butter before in the past. It was just let&rsquo;s just do both. And</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll rack up more national debt, I do think there will be</p>
<p>more and more pressure to question this type of spending</p>
<p>and why we&rsquo;ve already given Ukraine $80 billion in</p>
<p>handouts, when we can&rsquo;t afford to basically pay for, you know,</p>
<p>major entitlements at home. So I think there&rsquo;ll be more</p>
<p>pressure. Now, I think I don&rsquo;t know if that pressure is going</p>
<p>to come in time, though, to de escalate this, you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not and that&rsquo;s what concerns me. And just to just to cut to the</p>
<p>chase on this, I think where the rubber meets the road on</p>
<p>Ukraine is Crimea. It&rsquo;s and why because the Russians have a</p>
<p>major naval base there at Sevastopol, it&rsquo;s the home of</p>
<p>the Black Sea fleet. And they will never give that up. They</p>
<p>are willing to use nukes, I believe, to basically protect</p>
<p>that asset. It&rsquo;s a vital interest of theirs. Hold on. 80%</p>
<p>of the population of Crimea, they&rsquo;re Russian, and three</p>
<p>quarters of them, according to polling that was done by Gallup</p>
<p>and by a German polling firm, so not Russian polls, indicated</p>
<p>that they see themselves as Russian and want to be part of</p>
<p>Russia. So if we supported self determination, we&rsquo;d be fine</p>
<p>with Crimea being part of Russia. But here&rsquo;s the rub.</p>
<p>Ukrainian nationalism demands that every square inch of</p>
<p>Crimea goes back to Ukraine. And it is State Department policy</p>
<p>right now that we will never recognize Crimea as being</p>
<p>Russian will never recognize the annexation, which happened</p>
<p>back in 2014. So something&rsquo;s got to give here something&rsquo;s got to</p>
<p>give either we have to sit down Zelensky and say to him, listen,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting back Crimea, we&rsquo;re going to make that part of</p>
<p>a peace deal, or we are going to back the Ukrainians in their</p>
<p>military effort to retake Crimea, with the result that I</p>
<p>think is quite likely that the Russians will be willing to use</p>
<p>a tactical nuke to prevent their total defeat. So at some</p>
<p>point, we&rsquo;re gonna have to choose here, which these</p>
<p>outcomes do you want? Do you want to basically go for a</p>
<p>negotiated settlement, which means telling the Ukrainians</p>
<p>they cannot have everything they want? Or do you really want</p>
<p>to risk a nuclear war to take back Crimea, which is Russian</p>
<p>and the people there see themselves as Russian. So we</p>
<p>need to make a choice here.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Ilan put out a tweet for and got savage for it. And</p>
<p>he outlined sort of what you&rsquo;re saying here. So do you think his</p>
<p>plan he said, redo elections of annexed regions under UN</p>
<p>supervision, Russia leaves, if that is the will of the people.</p>
<p>And then he says, Crimea, formerly part of Russia, as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been since 1783, water supply to Crimea, a short as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying, Ukraine remains neutral. Should the West force</p>
<p>Ukraine to accept these type of terms, essentially, elections,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know why Crimea wouldn&rsquo;t be part of that</p>
<p>election process. Do you think UN supervised elections in those</p>
<p>regions should occur, and we should force the landscape to</p>
<p>do that. So he who pays the piper calls the tune, of course,</p>
<p>we need to have a point of view on how this war should be</p>
<p>resolved. We force him to do that. Listen, it&rsquo;s not about</p>
<p>force, they can fight on and do whatever they want, as long as</p>
<p>they want. Hold on with our American weapons, American</p>
<p>weapons. So you think he should do that? We should hold the</p>
<p>American weapons if he doesn&rsquo;t, if Zelensky wants our weapons</p>
<p>and support, which appear to be infinite, we should not give</p>
<p>him a blank check guarantee. The blank check is what started</p>
<p>World War One, the German Kaiser gave Austria blank check</p>
<p>guarantee and it led to World War One. That is how great</p>
<p>powers get pulled into the wars of minor powers. And we</p>
<p>absolutely have to have a point of view on how we do not get</p>
<p>pulled into this. And I think our one of our lines should be</p>
<p>that we are not going to fund the Ukrainians in retaking</p>
<p>Crimea. Got it. So just to put a to clear this, so we can move</p>
<p>on to the next topic. You&rsquo;re in support of removing are not</p>
<p>giving further weapons support to the Ukraine. Unless they</p>
<p>negotiate this, it&rsquo;s not going to come to that we need to have</p>
<p>a point of view on how you are in support of all stopping our</p>
<p>support if they don&rsquo;t sit down and negotiate a settlement here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you would do. America needs to have a point of</p>
<p>view of what is in its own interest. What is in our</p>
<p>interest is for this to get resolved diplomatically at some</p>
<p>point through negotiated settlement, not for to escalate</p>
<p>into a nuclear war that we could get pulled into. The only way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to happen, okay, is if Crimea goes back to Russia,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, they will be willing to pull out all the</p>
<p>stops. And by the way, they could even use tech nukes before</p>
<p>Crimea. But you answer the question, though, that I asked</p>
<p>three times, would you remove American support in weapons if</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t accept that if Ukraine doesn&rsquo;t accept that</p>
<p>would you be comfortable taking away our support in well, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to come to that. But yes, we should be</p>
<p>willing to threaten that. Okay, that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m just trying to</p>
<p>get you to answer that one. Hold on a second. They are a</p>
<p>client state of the US. They do not call the shots. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>America. We call the shots. We&rsquo;re the big dog here. All</p>
<p>right. That&rsquo;s the bottom line. And you really want to get</p>
<p>pulled into a nuclear war because I do not. I just wanted</p>
<p>you to answer that one question. We should pull our</p>
<p>weapons if they don&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s get real. Okay, this is about</p>
<p>our future. You know, we are American nationalists. At least</p>
<p>I am. I&rsquo;m not a Ukrainian nationalist. I support self</p>
<p>rule. I think we accomplished something by preventing Kiev</p>
<p>from getting toppled. But I want to support self rule for</p>
<p>the people of Korea. It&rsquo;s time for a settlement in Saxony. I</p>
<p>think the most important thing that we can all be thankful for</p>
<p>which I think will prevent a lot of wars in the next 10 or 20</p>
<p>years is inflation, and non zero interest rates, it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>going to be really tough. Like, you know, the UK cannot do</p>
<p>anything right now other than make sure that they have</p>
<p>foreign currency reserves to back up the pound, which they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really have that much. They&rsquo;re going to need money to</p>
<p>bail out their pension system. Whoever thought it was a good</p>
<p>idea to allow pensions to run levered risk was it&rsquo;s obviously</p>
<p>insane. Could you imagine if it turned out that the teacher&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pensions and the firefighters pensions in America were running</p>
<p>levered long? I mean, oh, they are. They&rsquo;re not. They&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>having to get resolved now. I mean, it&rsquo;s just we&rsquo;re at a</p>
<p>breaking point. Yeah, it&rsquo;s clear. You know what a pension</p>
<p>is. I know. I&rsquo;m not trying to sound fancy. Yeah, it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>dead instrument. I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s all it is. I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use some fancy intellectual argument. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying practically speaking, the treasurer is not allowed to</p>
<p>call Goldman Sachs and say, I&rsquo;m going to run two turns of</p>
<p>leverage on this money. That is not allowed to happen in the</p>
<p>United States. Okay. I get in some fancy way. It could be</p>
<p>thought of as levered long with, you know, all kinds of</p>
<p>indirection, but that is not how the world works today.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, it is how the UK works. A treasurer in a</p>
<p>UK pension system is allowed to call an investment bank and</p>
<p>actually run levered. That is insane. Okay. So my point is</p>
<p>when rates are non zero, all of that jig is up. Governments are</p>
<p>forced to batten down the hatches and you know, husband</p>
<p>cash for god knows what will break in the system and I think</p>
<p>that that is and and and as disruptive as that is, it may</p>
<p>actually be the bulwark against war. The jig is up, folks. I</p>
<p>mean, I think that&rsquo;s what we should take away from this is</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t afford this and the United States is funding it. We</p>
<p>have to force a settlement here and it will be a profile and</p>
<p>that may be the silver lining of inflation. Okay, Andy</p>
<p>Jassy&rsquo;s had an all hands meeting. Amazon is freezing</p>
<p>hiring for corporate roles in its retail business. Almost 90</p>
<p>VPs or higher level execs have left Amazon since 2021. Early</p>
<p>this week, there was an all hands presentation. The slides</p>
<p>were leaked to business insider. Some of them constraints</p>
<p>breed resourcefulness, self sufficiency and innovation.</p>
<p>There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size</p>
<p>or fixed expense. The slide instructed employees to</p>
<p>accomplish more with less sounds familiar sounds like</p>
<p>something the US needs to do and foreign policy needs to do.</p>
<p>Amazon leadership team urged employees to double down on</p>
<p>frugality. Jassy also spoke in the meeting, just a couple of</p>
<p>quotes, and then I&rsquo;ll get your thoughts. Chamath. It&rsquo;s on a lot</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s minds. And of course, none of us know for sure</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen. But there are a lot of signs that</p>
<p>point to this being a difficult and rough economy ahead of us.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how long that&rsquo;ll last. But I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the things that we are thinking about. And we decided</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to be more streamlined in how we expand in</p>
<ol start="2023">
<li>Good companies that last a long period of time who are</li>
</ol>
<p>thinking about the long term always have this push and pull.</p>
<p>Chamath, what do you read into this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say three quick things. One is that today, Thursday,</p>
<p>October 13, we had an inflation print, which was worse than</p>
<p>expected. And the markets are materially higher, right? So you</p>
<p>know, strange why? Well, I you know, we talked about this a few</p>
<p>weeks ago, but you know, my thought then and same is, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the same that I think now is that we&rsquo;ve effectively seen the</p>
<p>near term bottom and we&rsquo;re now consolidating. And so every</p>
<p>opportunity people have to justify that most of the news is</p>
<p>behind them, they take and they use that as a reason to buy.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s number one, which is that we are sort of</p>
<p>near the end. The second, however, is that if we do see</p>
<p>another leg down, there&rsquo;s really only one cohort of company that</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been really whacked. And I&rsquo;ll summarize it very quickly</p>
<p>by saying it&rsquo;s Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Google, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it. Even Facebook has now been sort of put into the bucket of</p>
<p>everybody else, where you know, we&rsquo;ve been crushed 60 70 80% in</p>
<p>those companies. So, so, so what does that mean? Well, those</p>
<p>four companies are now being identified for what they may be,</p>
<p>which in capitalism is called over earning. Okay, they are</p>
<p>making more money than we think is appropriate. This letter from</p>
<p>Andy Jassy is his way of effectively telling his major</p>
<p>shareholders that he is now moving the business to become</p>
<p>more of a cash cow business. Tim Cook made this incredible</p>
<p>decision in 2016 1718 that effectively did the same thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when Buffett came in. That&rsquo;s when he established a huge</p>
<p>ownership in the stock. That&rsquo;s when the stock absolutely ripped</p>
<p>because it moved into a different bucket in people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>minds. It became growth at a pretty reasonable price. And I</p>
<p>think Andy is making the case that Amazon is going to become</p>
<p>one of these GARP stocks growth at a reasonable price. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to generate a ton of cash flow. He&rsquo;s going to keep</p>
<p>expenses nominal. He&rsquo;s going to return a ton of cash to</p>
<p>shareholders with buybacks. That&rsquo;s the reading in between</p>
<p>the lines of that letter. I think it&rsquo;s a really profound</p>
<p>statement and a very smart move because you haven&rsquo;t seen that</p>
<p>letter or a version of that letter yet from Microsoft and</p>
<p>you started to see hints of that letter from Sundar where</p>
<p>he said, you know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s and he&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s saber rattling.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not there yet. He&rsquo;s in the appetizer part. You know, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the amuse bouche where he&rsquo;s like, oh, you know, guys, you</p>
<p>gotta work harder. Hey, guys, let&rsquo;s create some fancy</p>
<p>acronyms but Sundar&rsquo;s got courage. No, no, no, but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got courage. He is going to rip the bandaid off too and so I</p>
<p>think what it means is these three and maybe these four</p>
<p>companies are going to draw a hard line in the sand and say</p>
<p>we are not over earning. Do not abandon this stock. That again</p>
<p>will help put in a bottom in the stock market. What do you</p>
<p>think Freeberg? You worked at this company and you know, the</p>
<p>principles across the board, the saber rattling will turn</p>
<p>into saber swinging in Q4 Q1 you think Google Apple cuts</p>
<p>coming? Amazon is affected in a different way because they</p>
<p>operate this physical supply chain business. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>delivering goods to people&rsquo;s homes that people are buying.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, they really have to change their</p>
<p>trajectory very quickly. It was incredible. You guys remember</p>
<p>when COVID hit, you try to place an order on Amazon, it was like</p>
<p>three weeks to deliver because the infrastructure wasn&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>to do it. So they actually were seeing more orders than their</p>
<p>system had predicted. And they did massive build out, they</p>
<p>hired what a million people or something in their network to</p>
<p>meet demand. And then over the next year, earnings went through</p>
<p>the roof, their infrastructure and employee headcount went</p>
<p>through the roof. And now we&rsquo;re obviously coming back down the</p>
<p>other side of a mountain. And they&rsquo;re having to shift strategy</p>
<p>and shift their operating model. Yet again, there&rsquo;s a broader</p>
<p>set. And that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re in the direct commerce</p>
<p>business. Microsoft, Google, and other kind of software</p>
<p>companies, some of which benefit from advertising, which is</p>
<p>almost like a first derivative on the consumer market, or a</p>
<p>first derivative on the spending of companies that sell to</p>
<p>consumers have a little bit of a different calculus. They&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>much higher margin business 30% EBITDA kind of business with</p>
<p>EBITDA margin business with a very distinct kind of set of</p>
<p>challenges on how advertising revenue is going to be affected</p>
<p>over the next couple of quarters, and balancing that</p>
<p>against their cloud platform, which is sold to enterprises,</p>
<p>and their media consumption platform, which is generally</p>
<p>like YouTube, at Google&rsquo;s case, which is less affected. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not as much of a direct calculus, I will say what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened over the past decade, which we&rsquo;re now seeing change,</p>
<p>is these companies have had extraordinary growth, hiring</p>
<p>people to no end, there&rsquo;s always been, you know, kind of this</p>
<p>extended expense on capital on human capital. And that expense</p>
<p>on human capital has driven the average cost per employee</p>
<p>through the roof. And it&rsquo;s not just the salaries, it&rsquo;s the cost</p>
<p>of the RSUs, it&rsquo;s the cost of the facilities and the free</p>
<p>ice cream and the gyms and all the other stuff that&rsquo;s gone on</p>
<p>to compete. That&rsquo;s now changing. And so it really is creating a</p>
<p>different model for operating that hasn&rsquo;t existed for the last</p>
<p>decade, where everything has been, you know, how many more</p>
<p>things can we throw in the kitchen, you know, throw like</p>
<p>the kitchen sink at this problem to get all the human capital</p>
<p>here. And I think that&rsquo;s really, you know, what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>kind of structurally change in the valley. It&rsquo;s not as acute as</p>
<p>what Amazon is dealing with.</p>
<p>It does feel like that is those are the last</p>
<p>cities to falter off.</p>
<p>They are the ones they are the ones that take the index to 3200.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re going to try to do it, there&rsquo;s only one place to look</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve whacked everybody else, everything is down, you know,</p>
<p>50 to 90% in some cases.</p>
<p>So and then finally, you know, and by the way, sorry, just just</p>
<p>at the end of last year, a quarter of every s&amp;p dollar was</p>
<p>crowded in those names a quarter. So you got to go there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, and also they&rsquo;re automatically bought, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re automatically bought by these index funds. And so who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>at the wheel saying, we&rsquo;re not we&rsquo;re going to take the money</p>
<p>out of them, right? Who who in their right mind is taking money</p>
<p>out of Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft? Where do you put it?</p>
<p>I guess is everybody&rsquo;s question, right? Your mouth like if you</p>
<p>take it out of there, where do you put it?</p>
<p>Well, no, I think I think it&rsquo;s just that when, when you have</p>
<p>patterns of selling, typically, as I&rsquo;ve seen it, my experience</p>
<p>is that initially, it&rsquo;s the algorithms that really start to</p>
<p>push a market in a direction, then you have, you know, the</p>
<p>more traditional fund complexes, that&rsquo;s the hedge funds and the</p>
<p>long only they follow suit. And then the last group tends to be</p>
<p>retail. And it works in reverse the other way as well. And so,</p>
<p>you know, obviously, there&rsquo;s exceptions to all of these, but</p>
<p>as a general rule, so if retail starts bailing on Amazon, and</p>
<p>they are right now and Apple, yeah, they&rsquo;re, they are sellers</p>
<p>now, but again, time to buy it. But again, this is this is where</p>
<p>sort of organized capital now is finding a bottom again, like,</p>
<p>when you start to shake, just think about the psychology of</p>
<p>like, being delivered bad news after bad news, you go through</p>
<p>the cycles, right? There&rsquo;s denial, there&rsquo;s anger, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>depression, there&rsquo;s bargaining, but then at some point, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>acceptance. And in that acceptance phase, you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right, things are bad. But when you see a market</p>
<p>rally into a print like this, it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s really, really</p>
<p>interesting, psychological turning point.</p>
<p>As a proof point to what you&rsquo;re saying, sacks, Chamath and</p>
<p>sacks, I want to get your comment on this venture capital</p>
<p>firms, like Sequoia, Excel, and others that have now changed</p>
<p>their status as you know, just private companies, but also</p>
<p>dabbling in public are buying public equities, which basically</p>
<p>means they see more opportunity in public, underpriced tech</p>
<p>stocks, growth stocks, etc, than they do in late stage, private</p>
<p>companies, correct. And you saw the Wall Street Journal story,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming sacks.</p>
<p>I saw that.</p>
<p>What is what do you read what you read into that? And they is</p>
<p>it overblown? Or is it indicative of something?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably overblown, because Sequoia created that</p>
<p>fund that is a hedge fund, and Andreessen Horowitz became a</p>
<p>registered investment advisor, so they could buy public</p>
<p>securities. So look, I don&rsquo;t think most venture funds are all</p>
<p>of a sudden investing in public markets. We aren&rsquo;t even allowed</p>
<p>to do that, as far as I know, nor would we ever try to. So I</p>
<p>think probably it&rsquo;s exactly</p>
<p>You have to give up sacks, your VC exemption, but you could do</p>
<p>it. Yeah, yeah, I mean, we wouldn&rsquo;t want to, but it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>of the point. But look, I can&rsquo;t explain why the market did what</p>
<p>it did today. It could have, like Jamal said, it could have</p>
<p>been some sort of algorithmic, you know, buying or selling. But</p>
<p>I just think that the overall news today was the economic</p>
<p>news was just another really bad report. I mean, just look at</p>
<p>these headlines from the New York Times today. Okay, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to read you the headlines on a single sort of scrolling</p>
<p>page here. Number one, inflation came in much faster than</p>
<p>expected. Bad news for the Fed. Takeaways from another painful</p>
<p>inflation report. Three, disappointing inflation data</p>
<p>keeps Democrats on defense at a midterm elections for food</p>
<p>prices climb again, weighing on household budgets. Five, rent</p>
<p>inflation remain tepid, a troubling sign. Six, used car</p>
<p>prices aren&rsquo;t declining as much as the Congress of the House.</p>
<p>Slow down, slow down. Give Freeberg a chance to take some</p>
<p>Xanax. Take his Xanax, Freeberg. Gas prices fall slightly, but</p>
<p>overall energy costs are soon expected to rise. And eight,</p>
<p>retirees are getting an 8.7% social security cost of living</p>
<p>rates, the biggest in decades. I guess that one is sort of</p>
<p>positive, but it&rsquo;s like literally negative headline</p>
<p>after headline in the New York Times. But can I reinterpret</p>
<p>that for you? I think I think the way to think about it is</p>
<p>this gives the Fed the resolve it needs. It&rsquo;s going to go by</p>
<ol start="75">
<li>It&rsquo;s probably going to go another 75. We&rsquo;re going to have</li>
</ol>
<p>rates by four to 450 to 5% probably within Q1, which means</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to figure out where the bottom is, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>roughly now ish. And so that&rsquo;s why you see smart money David</p>
<p>shaking this thing off and starting to enter the market.</p>
<p>And so again, and the other version interpretation is, when</p>
<p>rates are four or 5%, the cost of servicing United States debt</p>
<p>is so meaningful as a percentage of their budget, the</p>
<p>incremental spend that they would need to make to enter a</p>
<p>new war is too much. I think I love this point. I love this</p>
<p>point where we&rsquo;re weaving all these things together. Do we</p>
<p>want to look at you? So right, so on the economics page of the</p>
<p>New York Times, you it&rsquo;s just disastrous headline after</p>
<p>disasterous headline, then you turn to the foreign policy</p>
<p>page, you got Tom Friedman, writing a column here, saying</p>
<p>we are suddenly taking on China and Russia at the same time.</p>
<p>And Tom Friedman historically has been a huge hawk. And he</p>
<p>is even saying he&rsquo;s saying pump the brakes on the brakes,</p>
<p>never fight Russia and China at the same time. So he says we</p>
<p>are in uncharted waters. I just hope these are not our new</p>
<p>forever wars. It&rsquo;s like, whoa. So basically, look, our</p>
<p>economic base, our economy is crumbling at home, at the same</p>
<p>time that we are doing unprecedented saber rattling</p>
<p>abroad. This does not compute we need to take a time out my</p>
<p>prediction. But my prediction is that we will not enter a new</p>
<p>war with rates flexing up as aggressively as they are.</p>
<p>I love it. I love weaving these two stories together. I think</p>
<p>it makes a lot of sense. We didn&rsquo;t have time for Alex Jones.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll save that for another episode. Gentlemen, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our best episode ever. It&rsquo;s an honor and a privilege to spend</p>
<p>this hour or so with you every week. I love you like brothers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a great 100 episodes. I look forward to 100</p>
<p>more sacks if you need a mental health break. Dr. Friedberg</p>
<p>Psychiatrist got him David, David, David will be back next</p>
<p>Friday. I just want to say replies, David, don&rsquo;t read your</p>
<p>replies. Get off of that. I just want to say how much I love</p>
<p>you guys. And I&rsquo;m really proud of what we&rsquo;ve created. And I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really excited to get to the next 100. And I&rsquo;ll see you guys</p>
<p>tonight. I&rsquo;ll break out the white. So we&rsquo;re all you want to</p>
<p>keep going. That&rsquo;s the news today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in for a hundy. I&rsquo;m in for a hundy. I love you. I will say</p>
<p>that Jake house moderation has been a lot better since he got</p>
<p>brigaded. That is his way of saying he&rsquo;ll be he&rsquo;ll see you</p>
<p>next Friday.</p>
<p>I love you. I love you, Friedberg. Let&rsquo;s see if we can</p>
<p>get sacks to do it. It&rsquo;s been 100 episodes. He hasn&rsquo;t said it</p>
<p>yet. But I love you, David. Are you coming tonight? Are you</p>
<p>coming? Yeah, I&rsquo;ll come. You&rsquo;re coming. Oh, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Let me check. I&rsquo;ll get back to you offline. Jesus Christ. God.</p>
<p>Jesus. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. sacks. I love you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can just say it. Okay, I love you. Back at you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to go around the horn. Can you say I love you? Can you</p>
<p>say I see you? I see you. I love you. Freeberg. I love you.</p>
<p>Appreciate you. I appreciate you. You guys. That&rsquo;s 100. We&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see you. Episode two. I love you too much. I&rsquo;ll see you</p>
<p>tonight. Bye bye.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge</p>
<p>orgy because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like</p>
<p>sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>you</p>
