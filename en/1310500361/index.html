    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Paul Conti,</p>
<p>a psychiatrist and a brilliant scholar of human nature.</p>
<p>My friend, Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>told me that Paul and I absolutely must meet and talk,</p>
<p>not just about the topic of trauma,</p>
<p>which Paul wrote an amazing book about,</p>
<p>but broadly about human nature,</p>
<p>about narcissism, sociopathy, psychopathy,</p>
<p>good and evil, hate and love, happiness and envy.</p>
<p>As usual, Andrew was right.</p>
<p>This was a fascinating conversation.</p>
<p>As the old meme goes,</p>
<p>one does not simply doubt the advice of Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>Allow me to also quickly mention</p>
<p>that I disagree with Paul a bunch in this episode,</p>
<p>as I do in other episodes, even with experts,</p>
<p>in part for fun and in part because I think</p>
<p>the tension of ideas in conversation</p>
<p>is what creates insights and wisdom.</p>
<p>My goal is to always empathize, understand</p>
<p>and explore ideas of the person sitting across from me.</p>
<p>Disagreement is just one of the ways</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fun to do just that,</p>
<p>as long as I do so from a place of curiosity and compassion.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got NetSuite for business management,</p>
<p>Indeed for hiring, and InsightTracker for bio-monitoring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to work with our amazing team,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always hiring.</p>

<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I find those annoying.</p>
<p>I try to make these interesting,</p>
<p>but if you skip them, please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by NetSuite,</p>
<p>an all-in-one cloud business management system.</p>
<p>They take care of all the messy</p>
<p>but critical things that make a business run.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of incredible.</p>
<p>Human civilization, together,</p>
<p>has been able to collaborate,</p>
<p>first in a small village for hunting and gathering,</p>
<p>and therefore agriculture,</p>
<p>then to build and build and build</p>
<p>into more and more complex entities</p>
<p>where each individual human is operating,</p>
<p>doing each different roles,</p>
<p>like the mitochondria in a cell.</p>
<p>Together, the cells make up organs,</p>
<p>and the organs make up the human body.</p>
<p>In the same way, humans together come together</p>
<p>to make a company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Those companies build gigantic physical architectures.</p>
<p>They build gigantic software architectures.</p>
<p>They connect us.</p>
<p>They give us services.</p>
<p>They enable the quality of life</p>
<p>that is observed in the developed world</p>
<p>and that the developing world is reaching towards.</p>
<p>I mean, this is just incredible.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not just the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the engineers or the product people</p>
<p>that make a company work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the whole thing.</p>
<p>Everything is needed, just like in the human body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of messy things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things like human resources,</p>
<p>management of inventory and e-commerce,</p>
<p>if you have an online presence of selling your products,</p>
<p>all of that, the financial stuff, that whole mess.</p>
<p>You should use the best tools for the job for that,</p>
<p>and NetSuite is just that.</p>
<p>For the new year, NetSuite has a new financing program</p>
<p>for those ready to upgrade at netsuite.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s netsuite.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Indeed,</p>
<p>a hiring website.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, we&rsquo;re always hiring.</p>
<p>Indeed is part of the toolbox that I use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the main service I use</p>
<p>outside of my own putting together crappy webpages.</p>
<p>When I actually want to use a tool</p>
<p>that does a lot of the work for you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I use Indeed.</p>
<p>You can post jobs there.</p>
<p>They have the instant match tool.</p>
<p>It gets the high-quality candidates right away,</p>
<p>so that first stage.</p>
<p>But it takes you through all the stages.</p>
<p>And ultimately, of course, in the end,</p>
<p>the most important, the most difficult stage</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t help with, that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>just the face-to-face conversation</p>
<p>between two human beings,</p>
<p>trying to understand if there&rsquo;s a fit.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is to get you there</p>
<p>as quickly as possible, and that&rsquo;s what Indeed does.</p>
<p>Indeed knows when you&rsquo;re growing your own business,</p>
<p>every dollar counts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why with Indeed, you only pay</p>

<p>This show, finally, is also brought to you</p>
<p>by InsideTracker, our old friends at InsideTracker.</p>
<p>Old friends that represent the distant future.</p>
<p>A big step towards the amazing future</p>
<p>when everything we do is based on data</p>
<p>that comes from our own body.</p>
<p>So InsideTracker tracks biological data</p>
<p>from blood tests that give you all kinds of information,</p>
<p>and then they use machine learning algorithms</p>
<p>on the blood data, DNA data, and the fitness tracker data</p>
<p>to give you recommendations for diet, for lifestyle.</p>
<p>And like I said, in the future,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be all kinds of really high-resolution,</p>
<p>high-bandwidth recommendations.</p>
<p>First of all, the data is going to get bigger and bigger</p>
<p>and bigger coming from your own body.</p>
<p>And second of all, you&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to have all kinds of recommendations.</p>
<p>First of all, high-resolution recommendations</p>
<p>on lifestyle changes, which is the backbone</p>
<p>of a happy life, right?</p>
<p>Diet, lifestyle, just getting your sleep right,</p>
<p>getting your exercise, all of that,</p>
<p>figuring that whole mess out in a data-driven way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s super powerful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for that future.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Paul Conte.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Do you see psychiatry as fundamentally a study</p>
<p>of the human mind and not just a set of tools</p>
<p>for treating psychological maladies?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I think psychiatry is our best way</p>
<p>to understand who we are as people.</p>
<p>I mean, it looks at our biology.</p>
<p>How does our brain work?</p>
<p>How does it connect the parts with one another?</p>
<p>How does the chemistry in it work?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the very foundational aspects of who we are,</p>
<p>and then it manifests as psychology.</p>
<p>What do we think?</p>
<p>What do we feel?</p>
<p>What are our strivings?</p>
<p>What are our fears?</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think psychiatry provides tools</p>
<p>that we can use to help each other,</p>
<p>but those tools come through it being</p>
<p>a discipline of understanding.</p>
<p>So, with every patient you see,</p>
<p>with every mind you explore,</p>
<p>are you picking up a deeper understanding</p>
<p>of the human mind?</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m trying to.</p>
<p>I think we should learn,</p>
<p>should be able to take something away</p>
<p>from everything we do,</p>
<p>every interaction to some small degree.</p>
<p>Every conversation.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a patient.</p>
<p>Just anywhere.</p>
<p>At Starbucks, getting a coffee.</p>
<p>You can learn something from that little experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, even if you just reinforce</p>
<p>sort of gentle kindness and gratitude</p>
<p>and decent human interaction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reinforcement of that,</p>
<p>that even if we don&rsquo;t take away memories</p>
<p>or lessons, so to speak,</p>
<p>we can reinforce who we choose to be.</p>
<p>So, understanding ourselves from those interactions, too.</p>
<p>Not just the general sort of philosophical human mind,</p>
<p>but understanding our own mind.</p>
<p>Introspect on how our own mind works.</p>
<p>Yeah, because everything we understand</p>
<p>about anyone or anything else</p>
<p>is coming through here, right?</p>
<p>So, yeah, we&rsquo;re understanding others</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re also understanding ourselves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all feeding through us.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s a tricky thing to step away</p>
<p>and look at your own mind</p>
<p>and understand that it&rsquo;s just a machine.</p>
<p>You can kind of control the way the machine processes</p>
<p>the external environment</p>
<p>and the way that machine converts</p>
<p>the things it perceives into actual emotions.</p>
<p>Like how it interprets the things it perceives.</p>
<p>You just sort of step away and analyze it in that way</p>
<p>and then you can control it.</p>
<p>You can oil the machine.</p>
<p>You can control how it actually interprets the perceptions</p>
<p>in order to generate positive emotions</p>
<p>and be like a, what is it,</p>
<p>like a mechanic for the gears in the machine.</p>
<p>I mean, I think to some degree.</p>
<p>To some degree, but the difference, I think,</p>
<p>at least as I understand,</p>
<p>I think of machines as not being inscrutable, right?</p>
<p>That if there&rsquo;s enough study,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s enough acumen applied</p>
<p>that we can understand whatever it is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to figure out.</p>
<p>Whereas part of understanding ourselves</p>
<p>is understanding that there are things we can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s indispensably important</p>
<p>to health and happiness</p>
<p>and also to having enough humility</p>
<p>to see how people can be different from us,</p>
<p>how we can be different from ourselves at times.</p>
<p>So knowing that we don&rsquo;t know a lot</p>
<p>and having some idea of what that might be,</p>
<p>I think is an indispensable part of the process,</p>
<p>which I think is different from machines, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, the machines, you&rsquo;re basically saying</p>
<p>machines generally because they&rsquo;re engineered from a design,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually going to be simpler,</p>
<p>therefore understandable.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying the complexity of the human mind</p>
<p>is, at least from our perspective, nearly infinite.</p>
<p>Is there a meta-phenomenon?</p>
<p>What sometimes gets described</p>
<p>as sort of levels of emergence</p>
<p>where at increasing levels of complexity,</p>
<p>you have novelty evolve that you can&rsquo;t predict</p>
<p>from lower levels of complexity,</p>
<p>like for example, atoms to molecules,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one example.</p>
<p>I think neurons to consciousness, consciousness to culture,</p>
<p>that there are meta-phenomenon</p>
<p>that separate from the phenomenon underneath of them</p>
<p>and thereby add an entire aspect of novelty.</p>
<p>So I think we are, I mean, I really think this is true,</p>
<p>that we are all infinitely fascinating</p>
<p>because these levels of emergence, of novelty,</p>
<p>that are inscrutable because you can&rsquo;t predict</p>
<p>from one level to the next or understand fully</p>
<p>are what make us, and not just us,</p>
<p>but I think sentient creatures, human beings,</p>
<p>but sentient creatures, inestimably more interesting</p>
<p>than creatures that aren&rsquo;t sentient.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, I think when we think</p>
<p>about machine learning and artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s that that we&rsquo;re trying to create,</p>
<p>the levels of emergence that now</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t fully understand anymore,</p>
<p>which I guess is both exciting and maybe scary too.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you start at the physics of atoms,</p>
<p>quantum mechanics, go into chemistry, go into biology.</p>
<p>From the biology, you have the functional phenomenon,</p>
<p>especially as manifested in the human brain,</p>
<p>and then multiple brains connecting together</p>
<p>through consciousness and intelligence</p>
<p>creates civilizations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Where do you think the magic is?</p>
<p>At which layer of the cake?</p>
<p>Every layer, because every time you emerge</p>
<p>from one thing to another, I see it as an analog,</p>
<p>like the concept of the dialectic, right,</p>
<p>where I think it was Hegel, right, who realized,</p>
<p>hey, when you have like thing A and thing B</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re complicated and they come together,</p>
<p>you know, you don&rsquo;t get a hybrid of A and B, right?</p>
<p>You end up getting something that&rsquo;s new, that&rsquo;s novel.</p>
<p>And I think that describes to some degree</p>
<p>what emergence is, except there&rsquo;s a whole new,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a universe of novelty, right,</p>
<p>that comes at each layer of emergence</p>
<p>that allows infinite possibilities</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t possible before.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so complicated,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re, our functional neuroscience, right,</p>
<p>which I think is psychology, right,</p>
<p>our ability to think about ourselves,</p>
<p>about others, to be reflective,</p>
<p>is sitting on top of so many layers of emergence,</p>
<p>like the idea of standing on the shoulders of giants,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re, you know, each of us,</p>
<p>our consciousness is standing on the shoulder</p>
<p>of a giant of many, many, many levels of emergence,</p>
<p>of novelty, so many of which we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s subatomic particles,</p>
<p>everything that quantum physics means,</p>
<p>you know, when does time become important, right,</p>
<p>as opposed to things happening outside of time</p>
<p>and outside of space,</p>
<p>when do we slot into one temporal perspective,</p>
<p>and then the complexity just, I think,</p>
<p>grows and grows and grows.</p>
<p>Yeah, the interesting word you use is novelty.</p>
<p>If true, this really blows my mind.</p>
<p>In some, either shallow or deep sense, it is true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know something about cellular automata,</p>
<p>is this very simple mathematical objects</p>
<p>where you have rules that govern each individual little cell</p>
<p>and they interact locally, and that, you know,</p>
<p>you understand the very simple operation</p>
<p>of those individual cells,</p>
<p>but at another layer of abstraction,</p>
<p>when you just kind of zoom out with blurry vision,</p>
<p>these meta-objects starts appearing,</p>
<p>that function, you can build a Turing machine with it,</p>
<p>you can build an arbitrary complexity of computation</p>
<p>on top of this kind of very simple object.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question whether that was always there.</p>
<p>The atoms somehow know about love, right?</p>
<p>Like, about consciousness,</p>
<p>about war and violence and evil and hate and all that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s already laden in the possibility of that,</p>
<p>the capacity for that, it&rsquo;s already in the atoms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already in the physics, it&rsquo;s already in the,</p>
<p>in all the different chemistry that builds up.</p>
<p>Like, even the origin of life, still a mystery.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s known, that&rsquo;s in the physics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s known to the universe,</p>
<p>the basic background physics in the universe.</p>
<p>Because if that&rsquo;s not the case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, where does that come from?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s that magic?</p>
<p>And how many layers can the cake possibly have?</p>
<p>How many are we gonna keep building?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s all, if there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re constantly through this process of abstraction,</p>
<p>of adding a layer to the cake, adding novel things,</p>
<p>like, where&rsquo;s the ceiling?</p>
<p>As we expand out into the cosmos,</p>
<p>if we successfully can do that,</p>
<p>are we gonna keep building, like,</p>
<p>more miraculous, complex objects?</p>
<p>And then the brain is just, like, a middle layer thing?</p>
<p>We tend to think of ourselves as truly, truly special</p>
<p>manifestations of what&rsquo;s possible in the universe.</p>
<p>But maybe we&rsquo;re just, like, the basic, like,</p>
<p>tiny building block of something much, much, much bigger.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the early days of being a brick</p>
<p>in a very large building.</p>
<p>Sure, I think that&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the only emergent thing, so to speak,</p>
<p>that we build is culture, right?</p>
<p>The aggregation of us.</p>
<p>So you have individual human minds,</p>
<p>which are entirely unique.</p>
<p>I mean, even the fact that time is different</p>
<p>for you and me, right?</p>
<p>It may be by picoseconds, right?</p>
<p>But we can engage because our perceptions of time</p>
<p>are parallel enough.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re close enough, right?</p>
<p>That we can share a reality, right?</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re all living in a different dimension of time,</p>
<p>right, I mean, we know that, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re unique in that way.</p>
<p>And then the unique individuals that we are,</p>
<p>just like the cells, right, start to create</p>
<p>not just one thing, not just a culture,</p>
<p>but culture on top of our individuality, right?</p>
<p>Our uniqueness, our even dimensional uniqueness</p>
<p>of time and experience and consciousness.</p>
<p>So we create cultures on top of us,</p>
<p>but what could be beyond culture, right?</p>
<p>And what is different from us,</p>
<p>either on underlying levels, like quantum physics</p>
<p>or chemistry or biology,</p>
<p>or entirely different and unconceived, I think is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an immense question.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s one that should create humility in us,</p>
<p>right, that look how much we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and then how reckless we are with ourselves,</p>
<p>with our resources, with human life.</p>
<p>And I think there it&rsquo;s important to say,</p>
<p>I mean, think about how entropy rules</p>
<p>the universe around us.</p>
<p>I mean, how over selected are we?</p>
<p>How many, not just hundreds or thousands of times,</p>
<p>but how many millions of times</p>
<p>does there have to be a selection branch point</p>
<p>before we get into a sort of eddy pool of counter entropy,</p>
<p>where you can begin to create,</p>
<p>which I think is why you say,</p>
<p>okay, do the atoms know about love, right?</p>
<p>The fact that anything is being created</p>
<p>means there&rsquo;s this over selection for counter entropy</p>
<p>where there can be a building of greater complexity,</p>
<p>of ultimately of novelty.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t often think about that,</p>
<p>of how far removed we are, maybe light years, so to speak,</p>
<p>from any other location,</p>
<p>temporally, physically in the universe</p>
<p>where this could happen.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t think about what does that mean?</p>
<p>Everything that you said, love,</p>
<p>everything is a counter entropy,</p>
<p>goes against the way, the basic physics of the universe.</p>
<p>So maybe actually the atoms</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t like what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They want us to stop.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been trying really hard to stop.</p>
<p>And despite that, we somehow started this whole bacteria</p>
<p>thing for like a billion years, and now we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>I actually think of it kind of the other way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any purpose to purposelessness, right?</p>
<p>So why would anything be here</p>
<p>if the drive weren&rsquo;t towards creativity, right?</p>
<p>If the drive weren&rsquo;t towards those subatomic particles,</p>
<p>not being nothingness that blips in and out of existence,</p>
<p>right, like we think is going on in empty space,</p>
<p>for light years upon light years, right?</p>
<p>But is there a design, either natural or intentional,</p>
<p>for a schema, right?</p>
<p>A scenario that allows for the incredibly rare,</p>
<p>but not non-existent eddy pool of counter entropy</p>
<p>where good can happen, right?</p>
<p>Where creativity can happen,</p>
<p>where ultimately something can grow,</p>
<p>something novel can happen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no novelty in the vastness of space,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s not nothing there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s novelty here,</p>
<p>because I think the layers of emergence</p>
<p>start stacking very, very, very high</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in a place of counter entropy,</p>
<p>which then could provide even thoughts</p>
<p>about like good and evil, right?</p>
<p>The idea that creating, that preserving is good, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we build upon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we get to the eddy pool of counter entropy, right?</p>
<p>So then destruction is not good.</p>
<p>What good comes of aggression and destruction, right?</p>
<p>Unless we&rsquo;re protecting,</p>
<p>or even you can think of outlying cases,</p>
<p>but just think in general concepts, right?</p>
<p>Destruction destroys.</p>
<p>It brings us towards a state of entropy,</p>
<p>towards a state of nothingness,</p>
<p>whereas goodness, commonality, collaboration, right?</p>
<p>Nurturing, right, brings novelty.</p>
<p>It brings new existence into the universe.</p>
<p>And I think we don&rsquo;t think about that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the middle of something so vast</p>
<p>and built on top of so many layers,</p>
<p>and I think it leads us to be cavalier</p>
<p>with human life, including often our own.</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s an underlying creative force</p>
<p>to the universe that might even have</p>
<p>a kind of built-in morality to it,</p>
<p>where creating is better than destroying,</p>
<p>and then that somehow maps onto our society,</p>
<p>where we kind of try to figure out</p>
<p>what that actually means in terms of good and evil.</p>
<p>So something is there like that,</p>
<p>but it has to be, it&rsquo;s like so nice,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so perfect, because it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sufficiently rare where we have our own space,</p>
<p>like you can close the door,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, I need to be alone right now,</p>
<p>as our human civilization, to work on my thing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sufficiently rare</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not other alien civilizations</p>
<p>that are just constantly knocking on our door,</p>
<p>destroying us, but it still exists.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fantastically improbable</p>
<p>that I think we should be very respectful of it.</p>
<p>And I think you said there&rsquo;s a creative force</p>
<p>that values creativity.</p>
<p>Things would be, well, sure,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a creative force, its existence,</p>
<p>its ability to exist and to create</p>
<p>comes from something other than entropy,</p>
<p>something other than so much dispersion</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s nothingness.</p>
<p>So the creative force will value the sanctity of things,</p>
<p>keeping things together, not destroying things,</p>
<p>building novelty, including novelty of knowledge,</p>
<p>novelty of sentience.</p>
<p>I mean, it fits with the idea that we&rsquo;re not nothing,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s incredibly improbable,</p>
<p>and that there are these many, many layers of emergence</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re standing upon.</p>
<p>And I think it tells us something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not doing ourselves a service to ignore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a jump to saying,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s a religious answer to everything.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s saying science isn&rsquo;t a god either, right?</p>
<p>So if we think of science as a tool</p>
<p>and not as an endpoint in and of itself,</p>
<p>what is the science telling us?</p>
<p>I remember showing up at medical school,</p>
<p>and it really is true.</p>
<p>I mean, I knew so little about the human body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d only been in hospitals to visit people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d taken pre-med classes,</p>
<p>but sort of intensely at once</p>
<p>after I didn&rsquo;t take any and I was working in business.</p>
<p>I knew next to nothing.</p>
<p>And I had this idea that was so naive in retrospect</p>
<p>that I was gonna learn so much, right?</p>
<p>I was gonna answer these questions</p>
<p>because I was gonna learn what&rsquo;s going on in the body.</p>
<p>What are these organs doing?</p>
<p>What are these cells?</p>
<p>And what I learned was there was so much more</p>
<p>that was amazing and mysterious and seemingly impossible,</p>
<p>like even how a cell functions, right?</p>
<p>Like what is going on inside of a cell,</p>
<p>the transport mechanisms and energy functions</p>
<p>and diffusion functions.</p>
<p>And then you can go down to smaller levels than that.</p>
<p>But when you come back out and you say,</p>
<p>how will those cells make a kidney?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not explanatory.</p>
<p>I remember asking the OB who had delivered my first child.</p>
<p>I was so amazed.</p>
<p>And I asked him like, what do you think?</p>
<p>Like, what do you know?</p>
<p>You do this, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing this life created.</p>
<p>And his thought was nothing.</p>
<p>I just marvel.</p>
<p>I mean, I get to do this, but I just marvel at it.</p>
<p>And I think the more we know about us,</p>
<p>the more we respectfully marvel.</p>
<p>And we should do that.</p>
<p>We should proactively marvel at every aspect,</p>
<p>at every layer that where the novelty emerges.</p>
<p>Yes, we&rsquo;d be a lot less likely to say,</p>
<p>hey, I don&rsquo;t like you because of something,</p>
<p>whatever it is, race, religion, culture,</p>
<p>sexuality, gender identity, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Or I wanna say, I want rights that you don&rsquo;t have, right?</p>
<p>Or I want what you have, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so much of this.</p>
<p>And I understand it&rsquo;s driven by scarcity</p>
<p>and by human insecurity and envy and all of these things</p>
<p>that I think drive us towards destruction.</p>
<p>But all of that recklessness comes from</p>
<p>not having this initial appreciation and respect</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re referring to and just marveling at.</p>
<p>Like, wow, okay, we&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with that.</p>
<p>But if we marvel at this whole thing,</p>
<p>the human project, the human condition,</p>
<p>all the different kinds of human beings that are possible,</p>
<p>what do you then make of that</p>
<p>some humans do evil onto the world?</p>
<p>First of all, are all human beings capable of evil?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re in the process,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;ve got a little bit of momentum</p>
<p>in terms of marveling the layers of the cake.</p>
<p>Should we also marvel at the capacity for evil in all of us?</p>
<p>Is that capacity there?</p>
<p>I believe that it is, yes.</p>
<p>So what do we understand about the psychology of evil?</p>
<p>Where does that originate in the human mind?</p>
<p>Is it there in the neurobiology?</p>
<p>Is it there in the environment, in the upbringing?</p>
<p>Can I clarify first?</p>
<p>I think the capacity for evil, I do believe, is in all of us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between enacting evil</p>
<p>and a sort of preset, followed, developed plan of evil.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that all of us are capable of doing</p>
<p>what the people who perpetrate the most evil do.</p>
<p>But I do believe that we&rsquo;re capable of perpetrating evil.</p>
<p>And the thought, one thought would be</p>
<p>that there are drives in us.</p>
<p>I mean, there certainly seem to be drives in us</p>
<p>towards survival, towards gratification,</p>
<p>in some ways towards pleasure.</p>
<p>And that can get very complicated</p>
<p>because pleasure inside can be relief of distress.</p>
<p>So if I feel very badly about myself</p>
<p>and I can feel a little better about myself</p>
<p>by making you feel worse about yourself,</p>
<p>which that plays out in a lot of human beings,</p>
<p>is that an indirect way of bringing pleasure?</p>
<p>So it gets very complicated what&rsquo;s going on inside of us.</p>
<p>And sometimes the perpetration of evil things</p>
<p>can be through misunderstandings, anger, impulsivity.</p>
<p>I mean, there are things that we can have in us.</p>
<p>And other times there can be other things going on</p>
<p>which are through the lens of unhealthy human psychology.</p>
<p>So for example, the psychology of envy,</p>
<p>which I think drives the lion&rsquo;s share</p>
<p>of the orchestrated evil, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between impulsive, reflexive evil</p>
<p>and highly orchestrated evil,</p>
<p>which I think is driven by envy.</p>
<p>Highly orchestrated evil,</p>
<p>are we talking about a scale of societies</p>
<p>like totalitarianism?</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re thinking about somebody like Hitler?</p>
<p>So at scale, orchestration of evil, envy driving that.</p>
<p>So I mean, that&rsquo;s really interesting to think about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear more about it.</p>
<p>So there might be some psychological forces</p>
<p>that are in tension with each other.</p>
<p>So one is, if you look at somebody like Hitler,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to know what was going on in his mind,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s possible to imagine</p>
<p>if you just look at dictators throughout history,</p>
<p>that he thought he was doing good,</p>
<p>not just for himself,</p>
<p>but for the people he believed have value.</p>
<p>So one way you can achieve what we consider as evil</p>
<p>is by devaluing some group of people.</p>
<p>And that could be all group of people.</p>
<p>So it could have sort of a narcissistic type of idea</p>
<p>that you basically don&rsquo;t care about other human beings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Envy is different.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe they can collaborate together,</p>
<p>or even like you mentioned,</p>
<p>you can actually enjoy doing bad to others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like different</p>
<p>because if all it is is like narcissism,</p>
<p>you disregard, you don&rsquo;t care how others feel,</p>
<p>then you can just make cold, calculated,</p>
<p>military, almost economic decisions.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t care if a million people die here or there.</p>
<p>But if you actually enjoy some aspect of that,</p>
<p>or there is like a resentment that fuels it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just cold calculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like fueled by some kind of personal</p>
<p>or cultural resentment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all fueled by that.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all fueled by that.</p>
<p>I think the idea that say,</p>
<p>Hitler thought he was doing good, right?</p>
<p>It is like that is such a thin facade</p>
<p>that it flies away like a handkerchief in a hurricane, right?</p>
<p>That&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wow, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built upon, like it says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain, logical lies, right?</p>
<p>Because people can build lies upon specious logic, right?</p>
<p>So the idea that, okay, I am doing good</p>
<p>because I believe that this ethnicity of people is good,</p>
<p>and this is bad, and now I&rsquo;m going to do this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna make the world different,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna bring better to the world,</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m raising armies,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m building concentration camps,</p>
<p>and I think this is all in the service of good,</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t think anyone ever thinks that, right?</p>
<p>Or they think that, but with,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re living in the surface patina, right?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re not allowing the hurricane in</p>
<p>that blows away the handkerchief,</p>
<p>and says like, this is all evil, right?</p>
<p>I mean, how do you decide that some group of people is good</p>
<p>and some is bad?</p>
<p>And like, what is it that you take upon yourself</p>
<p>to play God or make decisions about the world?</p>
<p>And I think what really is going on</p>
<p>is that people are not doing that, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something cobbled together to say like,</p>
<p>why this is right, and this is okay, right?</p>
<p>And this is even good, right?</p>
<p>But it is all a lie, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lie that&rsquo;s adorning the,</p>
<p>what I believe is the fact, I believe,</p>
<p>that what&rsquo;s going on is the gratification of envy</p>
<p>inside of the person.</p>
<p>And whether someone says, oh, I think this is good,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s okay if a million people die,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna enjoy that a million people die,</p>
<p>I think is the same.</p>
<p>I think the enjoyment, the gratification</p>
<p>of the orchestrated evil is there,</p>
<p>and that it all comes from vulnerability and insecurity.</p>
<p>It all comes from deficits in the sense of self, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to process that.</p>
<p>My slow penny and PC is processing that,</p>
<p>so envy underlies all of it.</p>
<p>The psychological concept of envy, what is that?</p>
<p>I keep putting myself in the mind of Hitler, I guess.</p>
<p>That has nothing to do,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to do with Jews or Slavic people.</p>
<p>Does it have to do with specific amorphous other</p>
<p>in his mind that he&rsquo;s envious of?</p>
<p>I think it has all to do with him, all to do with him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a love of the people with whom he allied,</p>
<p>or even a sense of the people who he persecuted</p>
<p>were worse than him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all projections out of what was going on inside of him,</p>
<p>which was an intense sense of inadequacy,</p>
<p>a rage at being someone he perceived as lesser than.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>We can define words in different ways,</p>
<p>even within psychology,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say we take the definition here</p>
<p>of jealousy as being sort of benign, right?</p>
<p>The idea that, oh, I might see something</p>
<p>that you have that I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and I might think, I&rsquo;d like that.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll work harder to get it, right?</p>
<p>Or maybe I can&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re younger than I am.</p>
<p>I say, okay, you have that and I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, I have other things too, I&rsquo;m okay anyway.</p>
<p>But I might want those things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very benign, the jealousy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to be younger, I&rsquo;d like to be richer,</p>
<p>whatever it is that we people think, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just a thought,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a thought that can result in strivings</p>
<p>or acceptance, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely different than envy,</p>
<p>which is destructive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thought of, I see something that you have</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t have, right?</p>
<p>And instead of me working for it</p>
<p>or accepting that I don&rsquo;t have it,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;d like to do then is bring you down,</p>
<p>take you down to where I am,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll feel better, right?</p>
<p>Because from the perspective of envy,</p>
<p>it is all relative.</p>
<p>So is jealousy a kind of,</p>
<p>is it because he said completely different,</p>
<p>but is jealousy potentially like a gateway drug to envy?</p>
<p>Is it a slippery slope?</p>
<p>I think no, I think that jealousy is a natural,</p>
<p>just part of the human phenomenon that we go through life,</p>
<p>and we see like, oh, I&rsquo;d like to have that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably part of our incentives, right?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m farming and I have one row of crops</p>
<p>and I look over and I see that you&rsquo;re working harder</p>
<p>and you have two and I&rsquo;d like to have two,</p>
<p>that can make me work harder to have two.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a slippery slope</p>
<p>from one to the other to,</p>
<p>at first you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;d like to work harder,</p>
<p>but then you keep failing and the weather sucks</p>
<p>and you keep failing and the other person</p>
<p>becomes more successful, plus he&rsquo;s got a new hot wife now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a nice tractor, there&rsquo;s a field that&rsquo;s all working,</p>
<p>and then you get this idea that, you know what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna steal all this stuff, I&rsquo;m gonna murder him,</p>
<p>and that, don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s just like a leap</p>
<p>of the same phenomenon?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, because I think there are things</p>
<p>that are in us as humans, right?</p>
<p>So the things that just by being human,</p>
<p>like we can, for example, feel,</p>
<p>we can feel compassion, right?</p>
<p>We can feel interest, right?</p>
<p>We can feel jealousy in that benign sense,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s all part of just being human.</p>
<p>If we start going from, hey, you have more crops</p>
<p>than I have and now it seems like I actually</p>
<p>have a better life in a lot of ways than I have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna kill you, that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>that is not a progression of something benign, right?</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>But wait a minute, but that is a human leap</p>
<p>of the same thing, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re drawing a line, stuff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying like, this human stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s regular life, it&rsquo;s benign,</p>
<p>but it feels like this benign thing</p>
<p>is just a low magnitude thing,</p>
<p>version of the thing that&rsquo;s not benign.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s probably a gray area</p>
<p>where it stops being, but like jealousy,</p>
<p>you can have like healthy jealousy,</p>
<p>you can have a little bit, slightly unhealthy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, I think Jealous Guy,</p>
<p>this John Lennon song that I love,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just beautiful.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s like, this jealousy inside relationships</p>
<p>can make you feel like, you know,</p>
<p>you could take your minds in all kinds of silly directions,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s crazy, but like it feels like that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a next door neighbor to like,</p>
<p>being really crazy and toxic</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff inside relationships.</p>
<p>And then that feels like a next door neighbor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like an apartment building,</p>
<p>that feels like a next door neighbor</p>
<p>that eventually gets to Hitler</p>
<p>with envy and resentment of an entire population of people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right in that there&rsquo;s a causal,</p>
<p>there can be a causal chain, right?</p>
<p>Like if I&rsquo;m not feeling jealous,</p>
<p>maybe I won&rsquo;t ever feel envious, right?</p>
<p>So you can see, okay, so it can kind of lead,</p>
<p>it can open gates to, huh,</p>
<p>like how much do I dislike</p>
<p>that you have things that I don&rsquo;t have, right?</p>
<p>So yes, in that sense, but,</p>
<p>and I think this is the part that I think is so important,</p>
<p>that I think there is a disjunction, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an asymptotic shift, right,</p>
<p>from one thing to another, because it is very-</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re speaking my language, mathematically.</p>
<p>Yeah. Asymptotic leap, yep.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a way to convey, right,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s entirely different,</p>
<p>because if I start thinking, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna try and make things better, right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like instead to harm you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s qualitatively different.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s almost like, you know what it is?</p>
<p>It could be, I don&rsquo;t know what you think about this,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in which direction your motivation is pointing.</p>
<p>So if in the response to the feeling of jealousy,</p>
<p>your sort of, the motivation says,</p>
<p>okay, I understand this feeling,</p>
<p>I wanna do less of it.</p>
<p>I think there must be a threshold</p>
<p>to which you actually wanna do more of it,</p>
<p>like it becomes a vicious downward cycle.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what envy becomes.</p>
<p>Like the first feeling, this idea</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m gonna kill the farmer,</p>
<p>turns into like more and more and more,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t sleep, and you&rsquo;re visualizing the farmer,</p>
<p>and he becomes the devil, and like you have this very,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s basically a thing</p>
<p>that builds into the negative direction,</p>
<p>versus returns to the stable center.</p>
<p>Now a person is cultivating evil, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying, hey, there can be seeds of evil</p>
<p>in all of us.</p>
<p>Let me take that seed out, dust it off,</p>
<p>plant it, nurture it, right,</p>
<p>and then grow that seed of evil,</p>
<p>which will affect all other parts of the person&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>right, they won&rsquo;t behave the same</p>
<p>towards others in their life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll become different as they nurture fantasies of evil,</p>
<p>as they begin to create inside of themselves</p>
<p>the motivation and the will, right, to enact evil.</p>
<p>The Hitler analogy would say,</p>
<p>look, you take someone who had a bad childhood, right,</p>
<p>who was not loved, who was taught and told</p>
<p>that he was less than.</p>
<p>Okay, like that, we know that happens.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why child abuse is so evil, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling children the worst possible wrong lessons,</p>
<p>right, they&rsquo;re not good enough, they&rsquo;ll always be hurt,</p>
<p>you know, they can&rsquo;t keep themselves safe,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t deserve safety, right?</p>
<p>So then you take someone who then nurtures</p>
<p>that seed of evil, which is a choice,</p>
<p>and this is why I can&rsquo;t paint well enough,</p>
<p>and no one appreciates me, and I don&rsquo;t like how I look,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t fit in with the people I wanna fit in with,</p>
<p>and then, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a hatred of self through that lens of misery,</p>
<p>of just being repulsed by the self,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s unacceptable to the self.</p>
<p>So, oh, it has to be someone else&rsquo;s fault, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my fault, whose fault is it, right?</p>
<p>And then you see en masse the inaction of evil</p>
<p>towards groups of people who somehow,</p>
<p>in this person&rsquo;s mind, right,</p>
<p>are responsible for his misery,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the justification of evil,</p>
<p>and then all the, you know, whether it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>this will be better for the economy,</p>
<p>this will be good, this will be that,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s all lies built to justify the evil.</p>
<p>Those are surface-level narratives.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And the envy is the deep-down mechanism that enables.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the endpoint that&rsquo;s being served.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s being served is destruction, right,</p>
<p>which is why it always brings more destruction, right?</p>
<p>I mean, how many times do wars that were started</p>
<p>for purposes that we would look and say,</p>
<p>like, those were evil purposes,</p>
<p>like how many times does good come of that?</p>
<p>Even if we look at the modern world,</p>
<p>what comes of it is more evil, is more destruction.</p>
<p>You know, Hitler&rsquo;s outward destruction</p>
<p>eventually came inward, and, you know,</p>
<p>you see pictures of what Berlin looked like</p>
<p>after the Second World War, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just destruction perpetrated outward,</p>
<p>as awful as that is, it&rsquo;s catchy, right?</p>
<p>Like people used to worry if you, you know,</p>
<p>before the, during the time of the Manhattan Project,</p>
<p>right, if you start this chain reaction,</p>
<p>you know, will you blow the whole world up, right?</p>
<p>Or will it stop within this bomb or not?</p>
<p>And we see, okay, the chain reaction of evil</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t yet blown the whole world up,</p>
<p>but look at the, look at how the catastrophe spreads.</p>
<p>And you think 50 to 60 million people</p>
<p>dead in the Second World War,</p>
<p>what truly was a world war,</p>
<p>what destruction was spread around the globe.</p>
<p>And this is something that can&rsquo;t be stopped</p>
<p>once the chain reaction starts.</p>
<p>Like if Hitler was successful,</p>
<p>like it would just keep going.</p>
<p>If he had been, think about it.</p>
<p>On his personal psychological level, I mean.</p>
<p>Right, because if we think</p>
<p>from the perspective of destruction,</p>
<p>success would have needed,</p>
<p>led to the need to conquer more,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s factions and infighting,</p>
<p>and then eventually you get the same mass destruction, right?</p>
<p>And never does the inaction of evil</p>
<p>satisfy what the person is initially seeking.</p>
<p>Like people want to feel better about themselves, right?</p>
<p>We, you know, like Winnicott,</p>
<p>who was a British pediatrician</p>
<p>who wrote about children and adults</p>
<p>from very deep perspectives.</p>
<p>He wrote about the idea of good enough, right?</p>
<p>And then you can sort of extrapolate that</p>
<p>to like we all want to feel good enough.</p>
<p>Like not just limp over the line good enough,</p>
<p>but I want to feel good enough</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m a decent person in the world,</p>
<p>and like what I do matters,</p>
<p>and you know, I can have an impact on people,</p>
<p>and you know, people can like me and care about me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a simplicity there that people want</p>
<p>that when people don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s certain other factors,</p>
<p>maybe there are temperamental factors</p>
<p>or historical factors,</p>
<p>can lead to trying to soothe that deficit, right?</p>
<p>Through envy, and I think it starts with that,</p>
<p>and it often starts in childhood, not always,</p>
<p>but it often starts in childhood</p>
<p>when the child&rsquo;s brain and psychology are so vulnerable,</p>
<p>and you know, you see salient child abuse.</p>
<p>If you look at what was Hitler&rsquo;s background</p>
<p>and what was Stalin&rsquo;s background,</p>
<p>and I mean, you could look at almost anyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s perpetrated evil,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re serial killers or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>The majority, not everyone,</p>
<p>but the majority had these lessons in childhood</p>
<p>that said you&rsquo;re not good enough,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t keep yourself safe,</p>
<p>no one cares about you,</p>
<p>and in a subset of people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna generate envy,</p>
<p>and you know, that seed of evil</p>
<p>then gets planted and nurtured.</p>
<p>As a fighter jet roars above us.</p>
<p>The sound of a fighter jet above us.</p>
<p>Been good if I had orchestrated that.</p>
<p>You forget, you quickly forget</p>
<p>the comfort of being in a peaceful place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing I saw in Ukraine,</p>
<p>is, hey, you quickly get comfortable here.</p>
<p>The whole trip back,</p>
<p>I was thinking it&rsquo;s so damn good to be in America.</p>
<p>Just the whole like, it&rsquo;s like a three-day trip back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good to be American.</p>
<p>We might take that for granted as a population,</p>
<p>but I do agree.</p>
<p>So the destruction never alleviates the envy.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Are all humans capable of envy?</p>
<p>I believe the answer is yes.</p>
<p>If you think, do we all have the possibility of evil in us?</p>
<p>I think the answer to that is yes.</p>
<p>But we have free will, we have choice.</p>
<p>We can choose what we do with that.</p>
<p>Which is why, just because someone is a sociopath,</p>
<p>you know, for example,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re not responsible.</p>
<p>I mean, our medical legal jurisprudence</p>
<p>has absolutely borne that out,</p>
<p>that legally, medically, we think,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re responsible,</p>
<p>presuming we&rsquo;re healthy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not unhealthy in other ways</p>
<p>that eliminates our ability to be circumspect,</p>
<p>but that we&rsquo;re responsible for what we do</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t nurture inside of us.</p>
<p>I mean, there are plenty of things</p>
<p>we could decide to nurture anger and hatred about.</p>
<p>You know, I could think of slight difficulties,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s something someone else has done to me,</p>
<p>or I could blame fate,</p>
<p>or I could be mad at God or the world.</p>
<p>We can all make those choices</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re responsible for them,</p>
<p>or for recognizing things in us that are like,</p>
<p>oh, you know, I too have that in me,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to nurture that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to foster that,</p>
<p>or do I choose to nurture and foster that?</p>
<p>And I think ultimately,</p>
<p>you know, our subject of Hitler as evil,</p>
<p>if Hitler had kept winning and winning, right,</p>
<p>I think ultimately,</p>
<p>he would have been the only person on earth.</p>
<p>Right, and I really do believe that.</p>
<p>Ultimately, everyone, everything else would be killed</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such destruction, right?</p>
<p>Destroy everything, right?</p>
<p>And probably when that didn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s the destruction of the self, right?</p>
<p>Because nothing soothes envy</p>
<p>that is stoked by the sort of flames of evil.</p>
<p>And what you see is more and more anger</p>
<p>and more and more frustration,</p>
<p>which is why I really do believe someone like that,</p>
<p>who nurtured evil in themselves that way,</p>
<p>ultimately would destroy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be like him and one other person,</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;d kill the other person.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really powerfully said.</p>
<p>But even just to return to the jealousy versus envy,</p>
<p>I still think that it&rsquo;s the same flame.</p>
<p>And envy is just the bigger version of it.</p>
<p>So I think, I just, in my own personal life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve felt jealousy towards others.</p>
<p>Like you said, like, oh, this person has a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a cooler thing, trinket,</p>
<p>whatever trinket I cared about.</p>
<p>And usually it&rsquo;s when somebody&rsquo;s really close</p>
<p>to the trinket you&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>And I, early on, like in my teens,</p>
<p>I realized that just empirically speaking,</p>
<p>that jealousy over a period of a week</p>
<p>just doesn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not productive.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help me build a better trinket.</p>
<p>Or it does if I turn it not into jealousy</p>
<p>towards another person,</p>
<p>but into a love for building a better trinket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, cool.</p>
<p>Almost, you know what, like proactively speaking,</p>
<p>and later in life, people like Joe Rogan</p>
<p>actually have been really powerful in this for me</p>
<p>just as a fan of his, to celebrate other people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost as opposed to ignoring</p>
<p>that other person with a cool trinket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like celebrating their awesomeness, in my mind.</p>
<p>Just saying how awesome that humans are able to do that.</p>
<p>And actually just how awesome is that exact person</p>
<p>at being able to do that?</p>
<p>And that somehow made me more capable</p>
<p>to build my own trinket better.</p>
<p>And it feels good also.</p>
<p>Like it makes me feel happy.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re not jealous anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not jealous anymore.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s why I think jealousy is different, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a week of jealousy.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t like this, right, I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>But if you take that in a way that says,</p>
<p>wait a second, actually, this is awesome.</p>
<p>This is fabulous, and this person did this.</p>
<p>That person&rsquo;s awesome, right?</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re not raining on anyone&rsquo;s parade, right?</p>
<p>And in not doing that, even inside your own mind,</p>
<p>you gain a greater cognizance of your own capability, right?</p>
<p>Well, if he can do that or she can do that, why can&rsquo;t I too?</p>
<p>Like I wanna make the better trinket too, right?</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re thinking creatively.</p>
<p>Nowhere in there was the emergence of evil.</p>
<p>I just disagree with that.</p>
<p>I think there was a choice made,</p>
<p>where I looked at my, if my life was darker,</p>
<p>more difficult, I think it has nothing to do</p>
<p>with the actual little flame of jealousy I felt.</p>
<p>I think it has to do a lot more with the other context.</p>
<p>If I, if my life were more difficult,</p>
<p>there was more abuse, there was more challenges,</p>
<p>I think that decision, I could have made that decision</p>
<p>in a different direction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;ve written brilliantly about trauma.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a bit more trauma as the background noise</p>
<p>of my decision-making, I&rsquo;ll be more likely</p>
<p>to not be able to pull away from the gravitational field</p>
<p>of that jealousy and it would build and build</p>
<p>and build and build.</p>
<p>So I think, not to disagree with a brilliant person,</p>
<p>but I feel like that flame has the capacity</p>
<p>to engulf the whole world.</p>
<p>I guess the initial flame of jealousy,</p>
<p>the little bit, like especially the younger you are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a habit that you get to build</p>
<p>in either direction.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve early on built the habit of saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to channel that jealousy into productivity</p>
<p>and into celebrating other people</p>
<p>and that jealousy disappears.</p>
<p>That was like a little discovery for me.</p>
<p>I discovered that.</p>
<p>I get it, that doesn&rsquo;t come, nobody tells that to you.</p>
<p>You kind of discover that little thing.</p>
<p>I could have easily not discovered it.</p>
<p>I could have easily discovered that it kind of feels good</p>
<p>to mess with that other person,</p>
<p>to think shitty thoughts, think negative thoughts,</p>
<p>do negative things to that other person.</p>
<p>Because that could also, I just think the capacity</p>
<p>in that initial feeling is there.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a decision we make.</p>
<p>Because otherwise, I think it dissolves responsibility</p>
<p>like, well, surely I&rsquo;m not Hitler.</p>
<p>Therefore, this jealousy is normal.</p>
<p>No, I just feel like every jealousy</p>
<p>is the capacity to turn into, maybe not Hitler,</p>
<p>but a toxicity that destroys, in a small way,</p>
<p>in your own little private life, but it could destroy.</p>
<p>I agree that jealousy brings us,</p>
<p>can bring us dangerously close to envy.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe, let&rsquo;s see if a heuristic we could agree on.</p>
<p>Right, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, okay, if we look at the terrain</p>
<p>of the mind as geography, right?</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m feeling happy, satisfied, proud,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m pretty far from envy land, right?</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m feeling jealousy now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming kind of closer to that border, right?</p>
<p>And I still, I think there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big thing to go over the border, right?</p>
<p>That the border isn&rsquo;t a gray area, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a border to go over.</p>
<p>And I think that you&rsquo;re, I agree completely,</p>
<p>one, certainly about trauma,</p>
<p>that the more trauma there is,</p>
<p>because then the more misunderstandings there are</p>
<p>about self and feelings that I&rsquo;m not good enough,</p>
<p>and then that can be anger about why,</p>
<p>and who might be oppressing me,</p>
<p>and, you know, I hate myself,</p>
<p>and everyone else who seems to be better.</p>
<p>Like, so trauma can drive us in these negative directions,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re still crossing over something, right?</p>
<p>So if you have the trinket, and I think, that&rsquo;s awesome,</p>
<p>I want that, I wanna work harder.</p>
<p>You know what I could do, though,</p>
<p>is I could sneak in tonight when no one&rsquo;s around,</p>
<p>and I could move something, right?</p>
<p>No, no way, I don&rsquo;t wanna do that, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, I came over the border a little bit,</p>
<p>and I thought, maybe that&rsquo;s a better way,</p>
<p>but then I came back, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re responsible for that, right?</p>
<p>Because it is a choice to say, I don&rsquo;t wanna work hard,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already working how hard,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna make my trinket better,</p>
<p>I wanna think mine&rsquo;s the best one,</p>
<p>I could destroy yours, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, we&rsquo;re letting our mind go over that border,</p>
<p>and do we say, right, run that forward, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s run that forward, and put people around us</p>
<p>who feel the same way, and start doing it</p>
<p>so we think less of ourselves, and we debase ourselves.</p>
<p>Do we run headlong in, or do we come over that boundary,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s maybe the capacity for evil in us,</p>
<p>that we come over that boundary, all of us, right, at times.</p>
<p>But do we come over it, and then say,</p>
<p>no, that&rsquo;s not my choice, that&rsquo;s not my self-definition,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m coming back.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m trying to justify,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s certain other sociological forces</p>
<p>that help us cross the border, too.</p>
<p>So in Nazi Germany, we&rsquo;ve been talking about Hitler,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s also the German people.</p>
<p>And so maybe when there&rsquo;s a bit of a mass hysteria,</p>
<p>so all these effects of, like, combination of propaganda</p>
<p>with the small jealousies and resentments</p>
<p>of the people that don&rsquo;t cross the border,</p>
<p>together they can, with great charismatic leaders</p>
<p>that sort of really fuel that fire</p>
<p>that we feel when we&rsquo;re part of the crowd.</p>
<p>So maybe those individual kind of psychological barriers</p>
<p>we have to take that leap from jealousy to envy,</p>
<p>those can be made easier.</p>
<p>The leap can be catalyzed through this mass hysteria.</p>
<p>100%, 100%.</p>
<p>I think that, to me, is a massive point.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about layers of emergence, right?</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s individual consciousness,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s culture, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re products of the soup we swim in, so to speak.</p>
<p>People would say that when I was growing up, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re products of the soup we swim in.</p>
<p>So if the soup that we&rsquo;re swimming in</p>
<p>is the soup of hatred, right?</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s gonna foster all of those things.</p>
<p>So then you think about,</p>
<p>just in a painting with a very broad brush,</p>
<p>the culture created in Germany prior to the Second World War</p>
<p>and what was the impact of the reparations</p>
<p>after the First World War, right?</p>
<p>Of the punishing reparations, impoverishment,</p>
<p>and basically humiliation that people were feeling.</p>
<p>Okay, there were a whole bunch of decisions</p>
<p>that impacted that cultural perspective, right?</p>
<p>Then there must have been aspects,</p>
<p>just like I see in many ways parallels in America now,</p>
<p>of what are our standards</p>
<p>for what we&rsquo;re communicating to others, right?</p>
<p>How is the media deciding what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not real?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s true, what&rsquo;s not true?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s hatred that is only gonna do evil</p>
<p>versus what&rsquo;s hatred that&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>because I might sell something by putting it out there?</p>
<p>I mean, we know that was going on in Germany</p>
<p>during the rise of the Nazis.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a parallel to,</p>
<p>do we value truth?</p>
<p>Can we stand together and say,</p>
<p>no matter how much I might disagree with you politically,</p>
<p>we can still understand that there&rsquo;s right and there&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s truth and there&rsquo;s lies, right?</p>
<p>So I think those are just two examples</p>
<p>of determinants of culture.</p>
<p>And then the culture is a determinant of,</p>
<p>is someone like Hitler marginalized?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s a crazy evil person.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, like, whoa, right?</p>
<p>Or is that someone who gains a greater following</p>
<p>and more adherence and then there starts to be a momentum?</p>
<p>Because why?</p>
<p>Because what do demagogues do?</p>
<p>I think they have a giant lasso</p>
<p>and they harness the envy</p>
<p>of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, you feel worse about yourself too?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter what the reasons are.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s your childhood.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s job failings.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s professional.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s personal.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You have envy too?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it together and do some destruction</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;ll make us feel better, which is a lie.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about envy.</p>
<p>Where does, from the leader perspective,</p>
<p>things like narcissism or sociopathy,</p>
<p>psychopathy come into play?</p>
<p>What can you make of the world we live in,</p>
<p>maybe the leaders that run the world</p>
<p>from the perspective, from the lens of narcissism?</p>
<p>So I am struck, 20 years of doing what I do now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a psychiatrist for 20 years</p>
<p>and I practice in so many different settings</p>
<p>and I consult in different settings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to have a very wide purview</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in people and in the world around us.</p>
<p>And I am struck with amazement</p>
<p>that of all the things I see that are, say, abnormal,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, from the mental health perspective,</p>
<p>this could be depression, panic attacks,</p>
<p>hearing voices, addiction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many things that cover everything</p>
<p>that narcissism is not frequent</p>
<p>compared to a lot of other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s small in terms of, say, a narcissistic diagnosis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much less than many other things.</p>
<p>But it causes the lion&rsquo;s share.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just mean the most compared to anything else.</p>
<p>But I think more than 50%, the majority of bad things,</p>
<p>evil things, destructive things</p>
<p>that I see in the world around us.</p>
<p>I think narcissists are wildly destructive</p>
<p>because they are driven completely,</p>
<p>they are lodged completely in the lane of envy.</p>
<p>Can you try to sneak up,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t wanna be lost in definitions,</p>
<p>but can you try to sneak up to a definition,</p>
<p>non-clinical definition of narcissism</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>So narcissism is a deep,</p>
<p>pervasive and unquestioned sense of inadequacy</p>
<p>in the self that comes along with anger</p>
<p>and fear and vulnerability,</p>
<p>fear of destruction, fear of annihilation</p>
<p>that is compensated for by aggression,</p>
<p>by the mechanics of envy,</p>
<p>by trying to make the self</p>
<p>seem better at the expense of others,</p>
<p>by taking from others,</p>
<p>by being completely cavalier</p>
<p>to the thoughts and feelings of others,</p>
<p>that narcissism is not arrogance.</p>
<p>Narcissism is the opposite of arrogance.</p>
<p>There is such a deep sense of inadequacy</p>
<p>and incompetence in the self</p>
<p>that the defensive structure around that</p>
<p>becomes dominated by rocket-fueled envy.</p>
<p>So the machinery of narcissism is envy,</p>
<p>but what do you make of the kind of</p>
<p>more popularly discussed kind of symptom of narcissism,</p>
<p>which is a seeming not caring about other people,</p>
<p>sort of a very inward-facing focus</p>
<p>in terms of the calculation you make</p>
<p>when making decisions about the world?</p>
<p>Narcissistic people definitely care about other people.</p>
<p>People who are schizoid say that</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily register other people.</p>
<p>But narcissism, people care about other people,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s entirely vis-a-vis the self.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m schizoid, I don&rsquo;t really notice</p>
<p>or care much who you are.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m narcissistic, I absolutely care,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m watching every last detail of you.</p>
<p>What might you have that&rsquo;s better than me?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly intense focus</p>
<p>upon individuals and demographics of people,</p>
<p>but the priority, the goal is entirely about the self,</p>
<p>which is why it can become easy to say,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t care if a million people die.</p>
<p>How different is that from going out</p>
<p>and destroying one person or a million people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the same category of those people only,</p>
<p>their existence is only meaningful in how it relates to me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still meaningful.</p>
<p>It just seems like a very difficult leap to take</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t care that a million people die</p>
<p>that seems to be, even with envy,</p>
<p>that seems to be a big feeling and thought to have</p>
<p>if you at all care about them.</p>
<p>Are other people, I guess,</p>
<p>tools for alleviation of your sense of inadequacy?</p>
<p>Right, I mean, I don&rsquo;t even care about</p>
<p>in that being caring at all.</p>
<p>I mean, caring about in that noticing</p>
<p>that a person exists, right?</p>
<p>I mean, someone who wants money</p>
<p>and notices that there&rsquo;s a $100 bill out cares about that.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t care about the $100 bill</p>
<p>and that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their thoughts and feelings,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s gonna attract attention.</p>
<p>They care about it because it&rsquo;s something that they want,</p>
<p>right, the same way people will care about others,</p>
<p>but only from the perspective of</p>
<p>do you have things that I want</p>
<p>or can I feel better about myself</p>
<p>by taking something from you,</p>
<p>by making things worse for you?</p>
<p>People often talk about narcissism</p>
<p>as like the opposite of empathy.</p>
<p>But sort of empathy, again, depends how you define it,</p>
<p>but is a careful consideration</p>
<p>of the mental space of another person,</p>
<p>of how the other person sees the world.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re kind of saying that narcissistic people</p>
<p>would also be very good at that</p>
<p>in order to understand how maybe the other person</p>
<p>can be manipulated or something</p>
<p>to alleviate your sense of inadequacy.</p>
<p>Right, so there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>between the mechanics of empathy.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, and we can define things different ways,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say empathic attunement</p>
<p>is the ability to be attuned and to think,</p>
<p>okay, what&rsquo;s going on in you?</p>
<p>What might you be thinking?</p>
<p>What might you be feeling?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people who have a lot of empathic attunement,</p>
<p>but we could look at that as mechanistic, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t equate to care, right?</p>
<p>An empathic attunement can come along with empathy or not.</p>
<p>Right, so yes, people who are narcissistic,</p>
<p>they can mentalize well.</p>
<p>So you mentalize, meaning the ability to understand</p>
<p>or to consider thoughts, feelings, motivations</p>
<p>in other people, right?</p>
<p>So people who are narcissistic</p>
<p>can have empathic attunement or mentalization,</p>
<p>depending upon how we want to describe those things,</p>
<p>but that has nothing to do with care,</p>
<p>with actual empathy or kindness or consideration.</p>
<p>So in that sense, empathy, usually popularly used,</p>
<p>means that you care, like your happiness is aligned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, I need to read this book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read so little science fiction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been one of my goals for this year,</p>
<p>to catch up on some science fiction.</p>
<p>So Robert Highland from Stranger in a Strange Land</p>
<p>has this quote about love, which is,</p>
<p>love is that condition where another person&rsquo;s happiness</p>
<p>is essential to your own.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good definition, I guess, of empathy,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re very sensitive,</p>
<p>so mechanistically very sensitive</p>
<p>to the state of another person&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>and your goal is to maximize their happiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like essential to your own happiness.</p>
<p>So the happinesses are aligned,</p>
<p>and when that&rsquo;s elevated to its highest forms,</p>
<p>you can call that love, romantic love,</p>
<p>friendship, and so on.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more thing about the narcissist.</p>
<p>Some people can be sort of benign narcissists,</p>
<p>where they want great things for themselves,</p>
<p>but if they have enough great things,</p>
<p>they can sort of tolerate others being happy too.</p>
<p>And these are people who sometimes</p>
<p>are actually quite highly liked,</p>
<p>because they have to have the most money,</p>
<p>the most power, the most of anything,</p>
<p>anything more than anyone else could challenge.</p>
<p>But as long as I have that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay that you have some too,</p>
<p>and then that can make you happy</p>
<p>and can make you like me.</p>
<p>So benign narcissists can be well-liked</p>
<p>from that perspective,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still all about them,</p>
<p>and that can change if, for example,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a scarcity of resources now, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re generally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not people who are being overtly destructive,</p>
<p>although that, they&rsquo;re over the border</p>
<p>into the envy territory, right?</p>
<p>Malignant narcissists are very different,</p>
<p>where they then want to have everything.</p>
<p>So even if I have 1,000 times more than you,</p>
<p>do I still envy you what you have,</p>
<p>because I want to have,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can feel good enough about myself</p>
<p>unless I have everything.</p>
<p>And once I have everything,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t feel good enough about myself either,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have to have more, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s malignant narcissism,</p>
<p>which we think of as sociopathy, right?</p>
<p>We can define these words in different ways,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re very, very negative concepts.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s profound sociopathy,</p>
<p>malignant narcissism, you know, envy writ large.</p>
<p>So sociopathy is malignant narcissism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a convenient way to think about it.</p>
<p>No, because we can do sort of sociopathic things,</p>
<p>but not be sociopathic,</p>
<p>like, well, you know, you tell a white lie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sort of sociopathy on steroids, right,</p>
<p>is then, you know, envy writ large is malignant narcissism.</p>
<p>Well, just like you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s empathic attunement, as you said.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the mechanistic aspect of empathy and sociopathy,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the big label you get attached</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just doing that thing regularly, I guess.</p>
<p>Living your life through that lens, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And is there a nice spectrum</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like narcissism, sociopathy, and psychopathy?</p>
<p>Is it all the same kind of nice stroll</p>
<p>through the woods off the cliff, or?</p>
<p>Not really, because the words don&rsquo;t have clear definitions</p>
<p>like psychopathy and sociopathy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no real definition of psychopath or psychopathy,</p>
<p>or does that mean someone&rsquo;s sociopathic but psychotic?</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s really not a,</p>
<p>we end up using those words colloquially, right,</p>
<p>which is why, you know, concepts that we can define,</p>
<p>like envy, empathic attunement, narcissism,</p>
<p>even though there might be nuances and definitions,</p>
<p>like we can define them in ways that are widely accepted,</p>
<p>including within psychology and psychiatry.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s nice to just think about this broad umbrella</p>
<p>of narcissism and the levels to which it&rsquo;s benign</p>
<p>or malignant, and then also separating</p>
<p>into the different mechanisms,</p>
<p>like interaction by interaction,</p>
<p>which sometimes can be narcissistic,</p>
<p>but broadly speaking, do you do everything</p>
<p>through the lens of malignant narcissism</p>
<p>that makes you a sociopath or a malignant narcissist?</p>
<p>Yes, and the thing I would add to that</p>
<p>is the thought about culture, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how does the cultures we&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the culture of a household, right,</p>
<p>the culture of a community,</p>
<p>the culture of a nation or the world,</p>
<p>how does that impact what unfolds in that person,</p>
<p>and then how does what unfolds in that person</p>
<p>impact that culture?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the question is,</p>
<p>what unfolds in that person,</p>
<p>yeah, how does culture affect it,</p>
<p>but how does your own psychological development unfold that?</p>
<p>Because narcissism in leaders</p>
<p>is the most impactful thing, right?</p>
<p>Who are the most impactful individuals?</p>
<p>Well, what is the most impact of individual psychology?</p>
<p>We have, it&rsquo;s usually leaders of countries</p>
<p>or leaders of major organizations and so on.</p>
<p>And one of the things you mentioned with benign narcissism,</p>
<p>that seems to be aligned with success, right?</p>
<p>If you care about your own success,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more likely to have narcissistic tendencies,</p>
<p>I suppose.</p>
<p>And so my question is,</p>
<p>when you follow that thread of narcissism</p>
<p>to become the leader of a country,</p>
<p>now you have a lot of new,</p>
<p>interesting psychological complexities to deal with,</p>
<p>like power, that old cliche that power corrupts.</p>
<p>Is it possible for power to corrupt the human mind</p>
<p>to where it pushes you farther and farther</p>
<p>into malignant narcissism,</p>
<p>into this destructive envy?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on power,</p>
<p>like the effect of power in the human mind?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think power is,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say an accentuator, right?</p>
<p>An intensifier, right?</p>
<p>So I think it is true that there are people</p>
<p>who can be sort of in a gray area</p>
<p>where there are malignant narcissistic tendencies</p>
<p>and behaviors, but there are also ways</p>
<p>in which that person can think outside of themselves</p>
<p>and think in a broader way</p>
<p>and think sort of kindly about others.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re sort of trying to navigate,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re aware or not,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to navigate between one and the other.</p>
<p>And then the allure of power is,</p>
<p>well, just look, just exercise that power</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll feel better, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll show you that you&rsquo;re good enough.</p>
<p>Look at the power you have.</p>
<p>And whatever may be going on in the person&rsquo;s mind,</p>
<p>that then power, yes, can corrupt, yes.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why we have to have checks and balances,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re all inscrutable to ourselves,</p>
<p>let alone to others, so we must have checks and balances</p>
<p>and we should always have them on ourselves</p>
<p>as well as on others.</p>
<p>We should want that for the health of ourselves</p>
<p>and the world around us.</p>
<p>So I think all of that is true,</p>
<p>but there are also people who don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>become corrupted by power, right?</p>
<p>There can be an understanding and a grounding</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a steward of power, right?</p>
<p>You know, a shepherd.</p>
<p>I mean, there are ways people describe utilizing power</p>
<p>and utilizing it in a benign way</p>
<p>that then fosters the healthy aspects of self, right?</p>
<p>Gratitude and humility, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if we could add a healthy dose of gratitude</p>
<p>and humility to everyone or to our society,</p>
<p>there would be a sea change, right?</p>
<p>But how do you feel gratitude?</p>
<p>How do you feel humility?</p>
<p>Those things are incompatible with narcissism, envy, right?</p>
<p>With really the bad pole of things that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>And part of the reason I&rsquo;m so focused in my work</p>
<p>and in really what runs through all of my thoughts</p>
<p>about life is the impact of trauma, right?</p>
<p>Because trauma creates these false lessons</p>
<p>and it walls us off from truth.</p>
<p>And it starts to point towards the unhealthy ways</p>
<p>of trying to feel better about ourselves.</p>
<p>But we have the health in us too.</p>
<p>We have those seeds of health too</p>
<p>that can grow into being a steward of power</p>
<p>and sharing power, being considerate and kind.</p>
<p>And we see a lot of that in the world too, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all just the evil.</p>
<p>We see plenty of people who do good</p>
<p>and who are generous of spirit.</p>
<p>And we have both in us, and it is,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re talking about our culture</p>
<p>and the seeds that we sow and the climate that we set,</p>
<p>including putting governors and boundaries around.</p>
<p>How do we rein in or say that the more aggressive,</p>
<p>the more envious or destructive is unacceptable, right?</p>
<p>How do we foster the part that&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>and considerate and reflective and slow to judge?</p>
<p>Of like, hey, let&rsquo;s learn a little bit more.</p>
<p>How do we foster that?</p>
<p>And I think a lot of that comes back</p>
<p>to early childhood education.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we don&rsquo;t do nearly enough</p>
<p>to protect children.</p>
<p>And as a corollary to that,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t do nearly enough to educate children.</p>
<p>I mean, say I wanna write a book.</p>
<p>Second book I write is gonna be</p>
<p>everything I needed to know about life</p>
<p>I learned as a second year postgraduate psychiatry resident.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why?</p>
<p>Why then did I learn so much about unconscious motivation,</p>
<p>about the impact of trauma,</p>
<p>about how we can be envious and how we can act out,</p>
<p>even about how our emotions trump logic in us?</p>
<p>Like, why don&rsquo;t we teach these things</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re young enough to understand?</p>
<p>Like, why is that other kid bullying me, right?</p>
<p>Or why, just because I&rsquo;m a little bit bigger,</p>
<p>do I wanna go thump that other kid on the head?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s going on that we don&rsquo;t do those things?</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re tripping ahead of ourselves</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t stop and think.</p>
<p>How are we using our resources?</p>
<p>How are we shepherding forward the next generation,</p>
<p>which, by the way, is a generation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna determine our fates too, right,</p>
<p>as we get older, but we don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>I often think of, like, in the Olympics,</p>
<p>you know, you see these great sprinters, right,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve gotta come out of the blocks perfectly, right?</p>
<p>So if they come out of the blocks a little bit too fast,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna fall over, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna just fall forward,</p>
<p>and I often see that in my head about us as humans</p>
<p>and as a culture, that we&rsquo;re rushing so far forward,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t stop and say, wait, let&rsquo;s keep the basics here,</p>
<p>the basic techniques of, like,</p>
<p>how are we navigating forward in life?</p>
<p>Or do we just throw all those away</p>
<p>because I can get some benefit by saying that you&rsquo;re bad</p>
<p>even though what&rsquo;s being leveled against you is wrong, right?</p>
<p>Like, why, do I take that?</p>
<p>Or do I say, no, there&rsquo;s something more important here</p>
<p>that we wanna shepherd forward in ourselves as a culture,</p>
<p>and I think preventing childhood trauma</p>
<p>and changing the ways that we educate children and adults</p>
<p>could, again, make a sea change</p>
<p>and maybe set us on a course towards,</p>
<p>you know, even towards a greater likelihood</p>
<p>of survival as a species.</p>
<p>Yeah, so talking to, like, people in elementary school</p>
<p>about human nature and teaching them</p>
<p>so how people can be resentful and envious</p>
<p>and how to deal with your emotions,</p>
<p>how to, yeah, these basic interaction things</p>
<p>about human relationships, about friendships,</p>
<p>about betrayal, about love, about all those things.</p>
<p>Like, it just, it&rsquo;s actually strange that we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we kind of hope the parents talk about that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But then the parents often, you know,</p>
<p>need therapy themselves.</p>
<p>The parents didn&rsquo;t learn it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the parents didn&rsquo;t learn it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not joking that I was mad,</p>
<p>you know, second year after medical school,</p>
<p>like, how is it?</p>
<p>Like, I think of even things in my own life,</p>
<p>and, you know, how I, you know,</p>
<p>how much shame I felt after my brother&rsquo;s suicide.</p>
<p>Like, I was already an adult, right?</p>
<p>I was a young adult, but I felt so much shame.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, like, I had no understanding that,</p>
<p>that, oh, it&rsquo;s a reflex to trauma, right,</p>
<p>to feel guilt and shame,</p>
<p>and that, of course, I was feeling that.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t mean it was true because I felt it,</p>
<p>but I mapped the fact that I felt ashamed</p>
<p>to the fact that I should have felt guilty and ashamed,</p>
<p>and it, like, led to some very negative things in my life</p>
<p>that I had to sort of pull myself back from</p>
<p>and recover from, and, like, I didn&rsquo;t know that, right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the automaticity of the reflex</p>
<p>and how pervasive it can be</p>
<p>and how it can put blinders on us,</p>
<p>and, I mean, it&rsquo;s just one example,</p>
<p>but, you know, it&rsquo;s an example of something big</p>
<p>that happens to people that we don&rsquo;t learn about,</p>
<p>and I find myself sometimes</p>
<p>having conversations with a person.</p>
<p>So, you know, I still do a lot of clinical care</p>
<p>of having conversations with a person after a tragedy</p>
<p>and, actually, I can&rsquo;t believe, right,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;m saying the things that this person didn&rsquo;t learn</p>
<p>in elementary school because, like, none of us did, right?</p>
<p>And then look at the misery and the suffering,</p>
<p>and then I think this is one person</p>
<p>among how many millions among us</p>
<p>who, you know, try and go about their way</p>
<p>without knowing things that are easily knowable</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re knowable</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t teach them to ourselves.</p>
<p>So, how to deal with trauma,</p>
<p>that trauma happens, first of all,</p>
<p>that suffering can happen,</p>
<p>and small trauma and big trauma, all of it can happen,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s natural ways to deal with it.</p>
<p>So, in the case of trauma, as you write about,</p>
<p>and we can also just talk about</p>
<p>some more of the details of that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s good to bring it to the surface,</p>
<p>to talk about it, to not be ashamed,</p>
<p>to hide it inside, to be some kind of secret,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of positive things to say here,</p>
<p>at least from my perspective.</p>
<p>One is it&rsquo;s discussing trauma</p>
<p>and dealing with trauma together with other human beings</p>
<p>by talking about it is a path to deep friendship</p>
<p>and intimacy with those people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dark aspect to trauma, to war,</p>
<p>that communicating it or sharing it bonds you.</p>
<p>So, like, the other side of trauma is, like, love,</p>
<p>you need that hardship, not you don&rsquo;t need it,</p>
<p>but hardship and trauma can often be a catalyst</p>
<p>for a deep human connection,</p>
<p>if you bring it to the surface,</p>
<p>as opposed to kind of hide it on the inside.</p>
<p>I mean, if we can just linger on it,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve been through a few</p>
<p>very traumatic events in your life.</p>
<p>When you were 25 years old, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>your brother committed suicide.</p>
<p>What did that event teach you about life,</p>
<p>about death, and about the human mind?</p>
<p>What certainly brought me face-to-face</p>
<p>with the truths of life and death,</p>
<p>because I had not had a major trauma before then,</p>
<p>so there wasn&rsquo;t a major trauma</p>
<p>sort of in my developmental years,</p>
<p>that what can carry forward</p>
<p>is a sort of omnipotence defense, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the thought is that when we&rsquo;re toddlers,</p>
<p>we all have, like, an omnipotence defense,</p>
<p>which is like, I can just try and get up</p>
<p>and run and move, and if I run into something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get up and do it again, right?</p>
<p>That we kind of have to,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s partly the protection of the parent, et cetera,</p>
<p>but we think we can get out there in the world</p>
<p>and do things, and we just do,</p>
<p>and if we don&rsquo;t have major traumas,</p>
<p>we can sort of carry through the,</p>
<p>oh, like, bad things aren&rsquo;t gonna happen to me, you know?</p>
<p>Like, I know that they&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>and I know they happen to people,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t happen to me, right?</p>
<p>And sometimes what will happen</p>
<p>is being confronted with such a tragedy</p>
<p>wipes that away very, very quickly,</p>
<p>and then the person feels extremely exposed,</p>
<p>like, oh, I thought that I was gonna be okay,</p>
<p>and now I know that I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>and that can start to lead to, well, what does that mean?</p>
<p>And now, is this all coming for me now?</p>
<p>You know, did I get so lucky for 25 years,</p>
<p>nothing bad happened,</p>
<p>and now nothing but bad things are gonna be happening?</p>
<p>Am I cursed?</p>
<p>Is my family cursed, right?</p>
<p>And I think that leads to, you say,</p>
<p>what the learning about the human mind,</p>
<p>in retrospect, I think I understood at the time</p>
<p>to some degree, but not like I do now.</p>
<p>I can put words to it now, right,</p>
<p>of how incredibly important, powerful,</p>
<p>powerfully important negative emotion is, right?</p>
<p>That how a sense of guilt and shame and vulnerability</p>
<p>can just pervade our entire life perspective.</p>
<p>So all of a sudden, we&rsquo;re swimming in a very different soup,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a frightening soup, and it&rsquo;s a toxic soup,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m most struck by that,</p>
<p>and that goes along with the idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not taught that emotion always beats logic.</p>
<p>You know, like I think the idea of Descartes,</p>
<p>Daniel, the idea that we&rsquo;re rational creatures,</p>
<p>you know, that kind of comes down to us</p>
<p>through Western thought, is like completely not true.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re rational creatures</p>
<p>only if there is an emotion grabbing for our attention,</p>
<p>right, like, you know, we&rsquo;re attending to one another,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re being very logical, right, what we&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
<p>If we heard a frightening noise right outside the door,</p>
<p>like, we&rsquo;d be entirely different, right?</p>
<p>The emotion would trump everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, stop paying attention to this, right?</p>
<p>Now safety is at stake, and we&rsquo;d think differently,</p>
<p>feel differently, behave differently, right?</p>
<p>And this is what happens to us, not just in situations</p>
<p>where something yanks us from one emotional state</p>
<p>to another, but it can be very, very pervasive.</p>
<p>So my sense of anger, frustration, inadequacy,</p>
<p>and then soothing in unhealthy ways,</p>
<p>you know, soothing by drinking too much,</p>
<p>and then kind of hating myself in the first place,</p>
<p>and then hating the world around me,</p>
<p>and then, you know, starting to think,</p>
<p>well, who cares, you know, what happens?</p>
<p>Like, you know, there&rsquo;s some very dark thoughts</p>
<p>and choices that came from a changed perspective</p>
<p>of self in the world.</p>
<p>So what do you do when that, because of trauma,</p>
<p>again, small or large, you find yourself swimming</p>
<p>or drowning in a soup of negative emotion.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>What do you do with that emotion?</p>
<p>I mean, we don&rsquo;t have to even talk about trauma.</p>
<p>I think the interesting thing is, you know,</p>
<p>any one of us throughout the day can find ourselves</p>
<p>taking a bit of a dip in the pool of negative emotion.</p>
<p>What do we do with that?</p>
<p>The first thing is to separate how we feel</p>
<p>from what&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t do a good job of that as humans.</p>
<p>If I feel bad about myself, it&rsquo;s very easy to,</p>
<p>then I conclude, like, I&rsquo;m bad, right?</p>
<p>If I feel ashamed of myself, I conclude</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a terrible person who&rsquo;s shameful, right?</p>
<p>This is the, you know, there&rsquo;s an old psychodynamic concept</p>
<p>of what they used to call an observing ego.</p>
<p>It still gets called that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ego in the sense of arrogance, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ability to step outside and to see ourselves, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what lets us keep the difference</p>
<p>between our feelings, right, and what we know to be true.</p>
<p>Like, we can be very angry at someone.</p>
<p>So I think that person&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>I think that person&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>I think that right now because, like,</p>
<p>something negative just passed between us.</p>
<p>This inside of me, it&rsquo;s just because of how I feel.</p>
<p>Like, when I can separate that,</p>
<p>how do I actually think about that person, right?</p>
<p>And, you know, we get driven so, so frequently</p>
<p>by how we feel because how we think,</p>
<p>therefore what we believe, right,</p>
<p>just kind of comes on its heels</p>
<p>as if the feeling is dragging it along.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been struck by that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that has struck me so,</p>
<p>the most, right, among the very most</p>
<p>in 20 years of working as a psychiatrist</p>
<p>is how we are led by our feelings, our emotions,</p>
<p>as if they are truth.</p>
<p>And then they create truth</p>
<p>because we embrace what they&rsquo;re telling us as true.</p>
<p>And that is, I think, incredibly,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s how people learn prejudice.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s how people learn self-hatred.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s how we learn so many destructive behaviors.</p>
<p>And then the blinders on us come in</p>
<p>more and more and more and more.</p>
<p>So separate, you know, we&rsquo;re driven by what we feel</p>
<p>unless we understand that what we feel</p>
<p>is different from what we know to be true</p>
<p>or what we can decide on one way or another.</p>
<p>And that requires realizing</p>
<p>and catching the emotions themselves,</p>
<p>realizing that it&rsquo;s an emotion.</p>
<p>A feeling comes into your mind, overtakes you,</p>
<p>a feeling of anger, dislike, hatred, all of that,</p>
<p>it just comes in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why did that person just cut me off in traffic</p>
<p>or something like that, that feeling.</p>
<p>So what, you just kind of take it as a feeling</p>
<p>and realize it&rsquo;s a feeling that doesn&rsquo;t represent</p>
<p>some deep reality about the world that&rsquo;s fundamental,</p>
<p>or you, that you just kind of watch it and let it pass,</p>
<p>which is the natural way of things.</p>
<p>Or decide if it means anything.</p>
<p>You know, if I&rsquo;m mad, right, someone cut me off</p>
<p>and I feel hatred and I want to destroy them, right,</p>
<p>to stop and think, look, I&rsquo;ve got that in me.</p>
<p>Are the stressors running too high in my life?</p>
<p>Like, is it really good?</p>
<p>Should I be on this road 10 minutes behind schedule?</p>
<p>Like, what am I really doing?</p>
<p>So we can learn, but yes, it&rsquo;s an observation skill, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an observation skill that we can develop.</p>
<p>I often think of something called the tapestry theory,</p>
<p>which I think initially was a theodicy of explaining,</p>
<p>I believe this is true, I&rsquo;m not sure of this,</p>
<p>but the idea was that, oh, we don&rsquo;t see God&rsquo;s plan</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re up too close to it, right?</p>
<p>Like, as if there was a beautiful tapestry on the wall</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re standing right up it,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re only gonna see one part of it.</p>
<p>We need to stand back from it.</p>
<p>And I remember learning that in a religion studies class,</p>
<p>being really fascinated with that at the time.</p>
<p>And I think that there are a lot of things</p>
<p>we do that about, right?</p>
<p>And in training ourselves to have an observing ego,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re saying is, hey, just the busyness of life</p>
<p>or my own impulses or the pool of emotions</p>
<p>are trying to pull me up right close</p>
<p>to whatever tapestry there is there.</p>
<p>And I want to sort of resist that.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m better off if I really stay further behind it,</p>
<p>and then I make a choice if I want to come close to it.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s some really positive emotion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s friendship or it&rsquo;s love or it&rsquo;s nurturing,</p>
<p>you know what, let me come right up to this, right?</p>
<p>But I want to choose when I&rsquo;m doing that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want some drive I didn&rsquo;t decide</p>
<p>to take me by the back of the head</p>
<p>and put me up against that tapestry.</p>
<p>So the interesting exercise for me,</p>
<p>and I think for a lot of people in modern civilization</p>
<p>is the internet with social media,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost like going to the gym</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s the way I see it.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a bunch of forces on social media</p>
<p>that are trying to make you feel things.</p>
<p>Most of it is kind of in the negative space of feelings.</p>
<p>Because there is actually a strong gravity pull</p>
<p>to negative feelings for some reason.</p>
<p>And so the, and the brain notices them more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that pull is, but it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>And you get to observe it on social media.</p>
<p>Like if you actually just scroll through social media,</p>
<p>you feel the gravitational pull of negative emotions.</p>
<p>And I just see it as a kind of exercise of like,</p>
<p>you feel the pull, just like when you go to the gym,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a resistance.</p>
<p>And I practice like stepping away</p>
<p>to look at the tapestry, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different mechanisms</p>
<p>I think all of us have to learn.</p>
<p>For me, there&rsquo;s a kind of,</p>
<p>you mentioned gratitude and humility.</p>
<p>So like if somebody, if it&rsquo;s me personally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently gotten attacked a few places here and there.</p>
<p>You know, if they&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re much smarter than me,</p>
<p>I practice kind of humility, like you mentioned.</p>
<p>And I kind of imagine that they are smarter than me.</p>
<p>Those things like help me to kind of like pull away.</p>
<p>Like, and then maybe they have a lesson to teach me.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t take their sort of negative comments to heart,</p>
<p>but I imagine the human being</p>
<p>and like that they might have a lesson to teach me.</p>
<p>And in general, when it&rsquo;s more amorphous</p>
<p>kind of negative feeling,</p>
<p>I think the other thing is the gratitude.</p>
<p>Just like different versions,</p>
<p>almost meme-ifiable versions of like,</p>
<p>oh, this is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Like we got a thing going here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like human civilization,</p>
<p>like bickering and having a little fun,</p>
<p>like lunch, food fight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Like we get to interact in this way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bit of humor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
<p>Like if you, like Thanksgiving dinner,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re arguing about politics,</p>
<p>it can feel like really intense.</p>
<p>Like, I can&rsquo;t believe you said this,</p>
<p>but if you zoom out, it&rsquo;s like family.</p>
<p>This is like, this is amazing.</p>
<p>So that kind of feeling really helps.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, it really is like going to the gym.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like building up a muscle</p>
<p>to be able to pull away from those emotions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I get to practice that kind of emotion</p>
<p>in regular day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Because like, you can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s hard to get those reps.</p>
<p>On social media, you can really get the reps in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the way I see social media</p>
<p>is a chance to sort of practice that stoicism</p>
<p>of like, of gratitude, of humility,</p>
<p>of loving other people in the face</p>
<p>of this negative emotion, all that.</p>
<p>Yes, and, you know, there&rsquo;s a certain kind of psychotherapy</p>
<p>that talks a lot about this idea that like,</p>
<p>oh, everything is as it should be, right?</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t mean from some moral or justice point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that often if you look at things,</p>
<p>one thing leads to another to another to another</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s actually very, very predictable,</p>
<p>even though we might be surprised about it, right?</p>
<p>And so an example, so I would say that gratitude</p>
<p>often does come along with a healthy pride, right?</p>
<p>So you could say, in the example you gave,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m being assailed on social media, okay?</p>
<p>So you could say, well, you know,</p>
<p>there was a time I sat at, I set forth to impact people,</p>
<p>to be able to reach people and to impact them, right?</p>
<p>And look, I feel a sense of both gratitude and pride</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done that, right?</p>
<p>Because look, you did it because of your effort, right?</p>
<p>Your work, your intelligence, your thoughts.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re responsible for it, right?</p>
<p>But also you feel gratitude because any one of us</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s here and has any opportunity</p>
<p>has reason to feel immense gratitude, right?</p>
<p>So then you can say, okay, what&rsquo;s actually going on here</p>
<p>is something successful.</p>
<p>I set out to do something and I&rsquo;m doing it, right?</p>
<p>And what it brings with it</p>
<p>absolutely includes being assailed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no surprise there, right?</p>
<p>That because people who have anything good</p>
<p>serve as lightning rods for envy.</p>
<p>So then, yes, there will be people who wanna make up lies</p>
<p>or whatever they wanna do</p>
<p>because you become a lightning rod for envy</p>
<p>by having succeeded at the thing you set out to do</p>
<p>about which you can feel a healthy pride and gratitude,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And then I think that kind of puts it in its place.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re still gonna make decisions about it,</p>
<p>but it makes sense then.</p>
<p>Like, you have a mechanism of understanding it</p>
<p>that not only makes sense to you,</p>
<p>but reflects the truth of what you actually have done</p>
<p>and achieved and what&rsquo;s going on in the world around you.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder if we&rsquo;re all kind of</p>
<p>a little bit unique in this.</p>
<p>Because for me, I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s useful</p>
<p>to kind of talk through my own experience of it,</p>
<p>is for me, I try to avoid,</p>
<p>especially in those situations, to feel pride</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just looking empirically.</p>
<p>I feel way happier if I focus on humility.</p>
<p>If I ever think of like, oh yeah,</p>
<p>when you do something meaningful</p>
<p>or you become more popular,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to experience these kinds of,</p>
<p>I feel the attacks more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like me versus the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the feeling that you start getting.</p>
<p>And that does not create a pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>So to me, the pleasant feeling is like stepping away,</p>
<p>like kind of laughing at it all,</p>
<p>like with a smile and not like in a negative,</p>
<p>like laughing at people,</p>
<p>but just like laughing at the theater of it,</p>
<p>the circus of it,</p>
<p>like this whole absurd existence we&rsquo;ve got going on.</p>
<p>And then just having a humility in like,</p>
<p>everybody has a lesson to teach me.</p>
<p>It just makes me feel good.</p>
<p>The pride thing, I do like feeling</p>
<p>when in a positive pool of emotion.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m building a trinket and I finish it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like really happy with myself.</p>
<p>Like I finished this thing.</p>
<p>And I usually actually like to do that alone.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t need an audience for pride.</p>
<p>I like to sit there and just like,</p>
<p>ooh, this is cool.</p>
<p>I did that, you know?</p>
<p>But I just, I find that in social interactions,</p>
<p>pride is just a danger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dangerous drug for me</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a small,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a small step away from then losing all the humility.</p>
<p>And then you start getting very defensive</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not going to,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just, it starts you on a spiral of negative emotion.</p>
<p>But I also, I mean, with everybody,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve mentioned this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll probably sneak up to it in different directions.</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s different brains that we all have.</p>
<p>My brain is exceptionally self-critical,</p>
<p>like nonstop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an engine that&rsquo;s always there.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to zoom out and have gratitude.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s like two brains</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like cohabitating happily.</p>
<p>And I can, the better I get at this,</p>
<p>the more I can use the one that&rsquo;s self-critical</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m trying to be productive</p>
<p>because naturally I&rsquo;m super lazy.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying not to be less lazy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be self-critical.</p>
<p>And then when I&rsquo;m not being lazy,</p>
<p>when I just, there&rsquo;s a special moment,</p>
<p>I want to enjoy that moment,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll turn on the gratitude engine.</p>
<p>I feel like generic advice that people would give,</p>
<p>if your brain is self-critical, that&rsquo;s not a good thing.</p>
<p>Like you should probably get rid of that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>Because it seems to be working.</p>
<p>Like I kind of like it.</p>
<p>I kind of like this grumpy old man that&rsquo;s in there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, that thing you did, that really sucked.</p>
<p>I was like, and I kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a movie, Grumpy Old Man.</p>
<p>I like that grumpy boy, the grumpy cat is in there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s nice, but yeah, it can have bad effects</p>
<p>on relationships and on maybe my wellbeing,</p>
<p>maybe as you get older and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So you have to monitor all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know which one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, because you&rsquo;ve kind of highlighted,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to have gratitude and humility,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also good to have a little bit of pride.</p>
<p>I wonder what that like set of ingredients</p>
<p>for a healthy life looks like for each of us.</p>
<p>Whether we have to customize and figure out what that is.</p>
<p>Some of the cake is already baked is the problem.</p>
<p>And because of the trauma, like if I was like eight years old</p>
<p>maybe I could be a little more flexible.</p>
<p>But at this point, like you got the thing you got</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to like fix it.</p>
<p>You could do a lot with it.</p>
<p>You could.</p>
<p>It may not be easy, but there&rsquo;s a lot of plasticity</p>
<p>and a lot of pliability there across all ages.</p>
<p>Again, people are different and there may be idiosyncrasies</p>
<p>of why one person is in a different place.</p>
<p>But as a general rule, I think the answer is absolutely yes.</p>
<p>I mean, people have evolved and I&rsquo;ve worked with people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve really changed themselves</p>
<p>and broadened their conception and understanding.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re in their 80s or,</p>
<p>I think we can do it at any stage of life.</p>
<p>And I would make a case for intrapsychic.</p>
<p>So not between people necessarily, right?</p>
<p>But inside of oneself for the feeling of pride.</p>
<p>And maybe if we call it self-esteem, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we call it self-esteem, right?</p>
<p>Or we could call it healthy pride.</p>
<p>We could put either word to it.</p>
<p>But if you think about what we&rsquo;re trying to avoid,</p>
<p>is say a sense of inadequacy,</p>
<p>then it is good to sort of own what&rsquo;s ours.</p>
<p>We can put ourselves a little bit out of balance</p>
<p>either in terms of building up resentments</p>
<p>or in terms of decreasing self-confidence, right?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re not owning everything that&rsquo;s ours, right?</p>
<p>So a thought I would have about,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say about some pride or some self-esteem, right?</p>
<p>Is it can work against vulnerability, right?</p>
<p>Which we know can also in some situations</p>
<p>push us towards jumping the boundary into envy</p>
<p>and all of that.</p>
<p>So just think about vulnerability.</p>
<p>If you conceive, okay, people are assailing me</p>
<p>and you just go to a place of gratitude,</p>
<p>it can send a message that, okay, I&rsquo;m just lucky</p>
<p>and I hope I continue to get lucky</p>
<p>as opposed to like, that&rsquo;s not true, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s ability inside of me</p>
<p>and discernment inside of me that tells me</p>
<p>I can have a greater sense of confidence</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll navigate what comes my way, right?</p>
<p>So because the pride or the self-esteem part</p>
<p>is owning what we&rsquo;ve contributed</p>
<p>to the goodness we&rsquo;ve created, right?</p>
<p>Which does in a sense helps us feel better about ourselves.</p>
<p>And it also helps us feel armed against, say,</p>
<p>the slings and arrows of whatever outrageous fortune</p>
<p>may come next.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Again, disagreeing with an expert here.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s generally good advice</p>
<p>but I think you mentioned vulnerability.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ve just been doing a lot of research</p>
<p>on rocket engines and rocket fuel.</p>
<p>And speaking of fuel, I just think I get a lot</p>
<p>from being vulnerable.</p>
<p>Because vulnerable leads to intimacy</p>
<p>in friendships and relationships.</p>
<p>I get a lot from being intimately close with human beings</p>
<p>just on a friendship, on like a ideal level</p>
<p>in conversations and so on.</p>
<p>And so I would rather err on the side of vulnerability.</p>
<p>To me, pride is destructive.</p>
<p>I think I already,</p>
<p>I already have a pretty good engine that says like,</p>
<p>life is awesome.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need help for that, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That one is working.</p>
<p>I just feel like the way to face the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s full of uncertainty, that could be full of cruelty</p>
<p>is with humility and gratitude.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, this pride thing, it feels like,</p>
<p>I know that for a lot of people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really important to really work on pride</p>
<p>to make sure they don&rsquo;t crumble under the pressure</p>
<p>of like, they don&rsquo;t give in to this insecurity</p>
<p>that destroys them.</p>
<p>But I just, for me, empirically speaking,</p>
<p>I seem to be happier facing the world with humility</p>
<p>and just being grateful.</p>
<p>The pride, I&rsquo;m really worried about.</p>
<p>It feels more destructive than anything.</p>
<p>See, what I think, as you&rsquo;re telling me that,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t wanna be presumptuous,</p>
<p>but I make some thoughts or some conclusions</p>
<p>that tell me, hey, you&rsquo;re in a pretty healthy place, right?</p>
<p>And the reason I say that is because</p>
<p>I agree completely about vulnerability.</p>
<p>I mean, think about humility and gratitude</p>
<p>make us vulnerable, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like, wow, I&rsquo;m grateful, thank you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for you, we could get shot down</p>
<p>or something bad could happen,</p>
<p>something could make us feel bad.</p>
<p>So yes, we need vulnerability.</p>
<p>If we try and eliminate vulnerability,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living miles into the envy land, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re describing a healthy vulnerability,</p>
<p>but then my brain says that&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>on the other side of the seesaw, so to speak,</p>
<p>has to be a healthy sense of self,</p>
<p>whether we call it self-esteem or healthy pride.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll cite what I think is the evidence for that</p>
<p>is you described the negative voice</p>
<p>as like the grumpy cat, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a good negative voice to have, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s telling you like, hey, that wasn&rsquo;t your best.</p>
<p>Like, come on, do better, or, right?</p>
<p>Like, you can do better.</p>
<p>Like, there&rsquo;s a negative voice in some ways,</p>
<p>but it believes in you, right?</p>
<p>Where that voice could be,</p>
<p>it could be a negative voice that says,</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t do that well because you suck.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t deserve anything good, right?</p>
<p>Why should you even be alive, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the negative voice</p>
<p>that can gain so much force</p>
<p>if there isn&rsquo;t a balance of healthy self-esteem.</p>
<p>So I think because you&rsquo;re well-balanced,</p>
<p>you have what you need,</p>
<p>and then having more of it seems like,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s not so good.</p>
<p>But there are people whose negative voice</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the grumpy cat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hateful, right?</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s a person who needs</p>
<p>to bring that into greater balance.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think my negative voice is like a grumpy cat</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a French existentialist,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit of a nihilist,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just kind of-</p>
<p>Sartre&rsquo;s cat.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sartre&rsquo;s cat, so it doesn&rsquo;t get hateful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a Hitler cat, so it&rsquo;s a little more,</p>
<p>yeah, I guess there is kind of like this line</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve come across a couple of times</p>
<p>between the benign and the malignant.</p>
<p>But of course, you have to monitor that line.</p>
<p>I think you have to be careful</p>
<p>when you face really difficult situations</p>
<p>of as you go on through life, more and more difficult,</p>
<p>so you face a lot of loss and suffering,</p>
<p>especially later in life.</p>
<p>You have to be careful with that voice.</p>
<p>That grumpy cat can get awfully confident,</p>
<p>and then if you don&rsquo;t have any source</p>
<p>of positive emotions in your life,</p>
<p>you can become too heavy of a burden.</p>
<p>Yes, which I think this leads us to,</p>
<p>what I think is a really important fact,</p>
<p>that there are some people,</p>
<p>like a significant subset of people,</p>
<p>who get happier as they get older.</p>
<p>They have more contentment, a stronger sense of self.</p>
<p>You might think, how could that ever happen?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting closer to death.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re accumulating insults.</p>
<p>Everything hurts a little bit more,</p>
<p>and we have less energy,</p>
<p>and we accumulate losses and traumas.</p>
<p>Why would anyone be healthier across time,</p>
<p>be happier across time?</p>
<p>And what we see is it&rsquo;s linked</p>
<p>to the things that we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s linked to, let&rsquo;s say, vulnerability versus pride.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good balance there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of humility.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of self-esteem.</p>
<p>The person is spending a lot of time</p>
<p>standing back from the tapestry and looking at it.</p>
<p>And what can come into people</p>
<p>is in sort of a sense of equanimity.</p>
<p>I sort of understand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being the best person I can be.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not always even great.</p>
<p>And there are things that I don&rsquo;t feel great about,</p>
<p>even while I&rsquo;m trying to do that.</p>
<p>But look, I&rsquo;m being who I&rsquo;m choosing to be.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t have to be in some big way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that means any one specific thing.</p>
<p>That can mean the person who&rsquo;s taking care of their cat</p>
<p>and tending their garden.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>We have to have love,</p>
<p>the ability to put good things out in the world,</p>
<p>and to put our ability to work</p>
<p>to make things different out into the world</p>
<p>and make things better.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re doing that,</p>
<p>we get happier across time</p>
<p>because we come to a sense of peace with ourselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not supposed to be everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not supposed to do everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not supposed to fix everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not supposed to suffer all the time</p>
<p>for the things I haven&rsquo;t gotten right.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m kind of, and it leads back to Winnicott,</p>
<p>the British physician, I&rsquo;m good enough.</p>
<p>And that seems to help people feel happy,</p>
<p>you know, contentment,</p>
<p>and be generative and productive into later life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s what we all should be wanting.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s even, it&rsquo;s kind of an afterthought,</p>
<p>though, some people are like that</p>
<p>as opposed to, wait a second, right?</p>
<p>Like, what&rsquo;s going on with them?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s do all of that.</p>
<p>Albert Camus writes in Myth of Sisyphus, quote,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only one real serious philosophical problem,</p>
<p>and that is suicide.</p>
<p>Deciding whether or not life is worth living</p>
<p>is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy.</p>
<p>All other questions follow from that.</p>
<p>So basically, to be or not to be.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a truth to that statement?</p>
<p>This question of why live at all?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s truth to that statement</p>
<p>being a really, really important question for us to answer?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the answer?</p>
<p>I think the answer is yes.</p>
<p>And I think Camus answered it, yes, too.</p>
<p>I love his writing, and I think there was</p>
<p>a streak of nihilism that I think grew</p>
<p>in his writing over the years,</p>
<p>and the thought is, I think, that Camus died by suicide.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re not sure of that</p>
<p>because it was a car accident.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always read that as the primary scholarly opinion.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s interesting that after his death,</p>
<p>a book called The First Man was published,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know if he had intended to publish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the specifics about it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s about him as a child, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, the first man.</p>
<p>He was the first man in his existence, right?</p>
<p>The most, the one that felt and experienced everything.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s sadness and distress and all in that book,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a beauty of life and living and experience.</p>
<p>And I think to compare that beauty, like that&rsquo;s life,</p>
<p>even if something&rsquo;s difficult and scary and sad,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s something beautiful around the corner</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s a kind person and a new discovery,</p>
<p>you know, more what was in him as a child.</p>
<p>And I think that we can get jaded,</p>
<p>as you and I were just talking about a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>We can accentuate the negative and foster the negative</p>
<p>and come to a place where we&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>for some in-depth philosophical answer,</p>
<p>you know, some thick book, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna explain all that to us</p>
<p>instead of the simplicity that we&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>I think humility, gratitude,</p>
<p>helps us have just simple positive experiences,</p>
<p>feelings of contentment, feelings of connection</p>
<p>with another person, learning, discovery.</p>
<p>And I think the answer to Caymu&rsquo;s question is yes,</p>
<p>and I think it lies in his writing</p>
<p>about when he was a child,</p>
<p>which I think he saw as less important</p>
<p>than his later writings and the intellectual heaviness</p>
<p>when I think maybe he had lost his way a little bit</p>
<p>from the things he understood when he was younger.</p>
<p>So another way to talk about it,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d love to hear what you think,</p>
<p>is about these broad categories,</p>
<p>let me be started with Kierkegaard,</p>
<p>of existentialism, absurdism, and nihilism.</p>
<p>And I think Caymu considered himself an absurdist,</p>
<p>not actually an existentialist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a middle ground where I think existentialist,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to characterize it in the wrong way,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of different definitions,</p>
<p>but I think existentialists ultimately do think</p>
<p>that there is meaning in pursuing the passion of life,</p>
<p>like pursuing the, in living life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you discover the meaning</p>
<p>at that individual level of fully embracing life.</p>
<p>And I think nihilism is, again, it&rsquo;s kind of like a spectrum</p>
<p>where nihilism basically says there&rsquo;s no meaning,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter, nothing matters.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know, but somehow that lands you</p>
<p>in a place that&rsquo;s totally uninspired.</p>
<p>Maybe nihilists would disagree with that.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a way to live a creative life</p>
<p>in a nihilistic mindset.</p>
<p>And I think absurdism is somewhere in the middle</p>
<p>where pursuing meaning at all is not a good idea.</p>
<p>So kind of, I think existentialists say</p>
<p>you should be looking for meaning,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s to be discovered in your own actions,</p>
<p>in your own life, in the moment.</p>
<p>And absurdism says life is absurd, nothing makes sense.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look for the meaning, just live, just be.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of the later Caymu kind of philosophy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can sort of comment</p>
<p>on these kind of nuanced ideas here.</p>
<p>If there is no religious guide to your life,</p>
<p>what do you think about this kind of search for meaning?</p>
<p>Do you see that there&rsquo;s some wisdom</p>
<p>in the existentialist perspective of discovering it</p>
<p>in your own life, in this passion,</p>
<p>in this kind of day-to-day existence,</p>
<p>in the moments of your life that bring you joy,</p>
<p>that kind of thing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re bringing different sort of perspectives</p>
<p>and trying to tease apart, like,</p>
<p>well, wait, what are the differences</p>
<p>in those perspectives, right?</p>
<p>And I think what it points out is that,</p>
<p>okay, we tend to conflate things as human beings, right,</p>
<p>and to take two different things</p>
<p>and try and make them into one,</p>
<p>but we also, I think, on the other end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>get very overly reductionist.</p>
<p>And I think that when we get too overly reductionist,</p>
<p>we lose the ability to learn from anything</p>
<p>or to generate meaning, right?</p>
<p>I mean, think about Sartre,</p>
<p>who the thought of existentialism</p>
<p>is so consistent with him, right,</p>
<p>who, on the one hand, wrote about very clear terms,</p>
<p>like this is what it is and this is what it isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re gonna make your meaning</p>
<p>in a very academically proscribed way,</p>
<p>but he also wrote short stories like The Wall, right,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s something totally absurd happens, right,</p>
<p>as part of the story, right?</p>
<p>So I think what ends up happening</p>
<p>is people either reduce themselves</p>
<p>or get associated with something</p>
<p>that, by being overly reductionist,</p>
<p>takes us away from meaning, right?</p>
<p>The idea that, look, we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if there is an overarching religious meaning</p>
<p>or what we call a religious meaning or purpose,</p>
<p>like we don&rsquo;t know that, right?</p>
<p>So, okay, if we take that as a given</p>
<p>that people who say that they know are having faith,</p>
<p>like how Spinoza described faith, right?</p>
<p>Faith is that you don&rsquo;t know, but you believe anyway, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because you have faith now you know something,</p>
<p>right, because I think that&rsquo;s a slippery slope</p>
<p>to the persecution of others, right?</p>
<p>So if we say, okay, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re left either deciding,</p>
<p>okay, well, then to hell with everything,</p>
<p>you know, like there&rsquo;s that movie,</p>
<p>A Strange Brew, right,</p>
<p>that Bob and Doug McKenzie were like,</p>
<p>the brakes don&rsquo;t work on the car,</p>
<p>and one of them says, oh, why bother steering, right?</p>
<p>So if we don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s meaning,</p>
<p>like why bother steering?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just give up the ghost, right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s even what the nihilists said.</p>
<p>I mean, I think Bakunin said we should get rid of everything</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve ever created except Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth Symphony</p>
<p>and start over from there.</p>
<p>But so even people who are very nihilistic</p>
<p>or associated with that,</p>
<p>a lot of them were just not liking what we had built, right?</p>
<p>So if we accept that a lot of what we have built</p>
<p>as humans inside of us and outside of us</p>
<p>is really counterproductive and doesn&rsquo;t help us,</p>
<p>and that absurd things happen in the world, right?</p>
<p>And that often the way social structures</p>
<p>and systems build up,</p>
<p>you build themselves up is absurd.</p>
<p>I think our healthcare system</p>
<p>operates in a way that&rsquo;s absurd, right?</p>
<p>So if we accept that there are absurdities</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s truth,</p>
<p>then what are we left with?</p>
<p>But like, well, let&rsquo;s try and make meaning, right?</p>
<p>Ortega y Gasset said,</p>
<p>yo soy yo en mi circunstancia, right?</p>
<p>I am myself in my circumstances, right?</p>
<p>Which is like, look, we can&rsquo;t control everything.</p>
<p>We live in circumstances around us,</p>
<p>but within those circumstances,</p>
<p>we can make decisions and define ourselves.</p>
<p>And I think the brilliance of that,</p>
<p>and I think tying it all together, right,</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s not trying to be,</p>
<p>in a sense it ties it all together</p>
<p>by not trying to answer everything concisely,</p>
<p>that yes, we can make meaning.</p>
<p>Like we see that if someone trips in front of me,</p>
<p>I could walk around them or I could help them up.</p>
<p>I mean, no one can tell me that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I do.</p>
<p>I absolutely reject the idea that,</p>
<p>oh, I could step over them or on them,</p>
<p>or I could help them up and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, try being the person on the ground, right?</p>
<p>So we create meaning, but we live in our circumstances,</p>
<p>and there are absurdities both within us</p>
<p>and outside of us in our social structures.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of things</p>
<p>that pretend to have meaning that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the shades of nihilism,</p>
<p>but ultimately there&rsquo;s something going on here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s doing the best we can</p>
<p>in the context of just not knowing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I tend to see, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s genetic,</p>
<p>I think I tend to think just observing the internet,</p>
<p>the number of memes there are.</p>
<p>I think many other people are like me.</p>
<p>I tend to see the humor in the absurdity.</p>
<p>I tend to enjoy it from that kind of angle.</p>
<p>I see the Kafkaesque nature of society,</p>
<p>of different aspects of society,</p>
<p>and just kind of notice the magic with a smile.</p>
<p>And just laugh at the circus of it all.</p>
<p>Because it is magical that the circus all comes together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little bit out of sync,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a guy playing trombone,</p>
<p>but overall it&rsquo;s pretty good, it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>And we can look at that and just kind of marvel,</p>
<p>and go, huh, which I think is a relation</p>
<p>to at least a lot of what we, in the Western world,</p>
<p>think of as Eastern, as non-attachment.</p>
<p>Because then if there&rsquo;s something absurd,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not good for me, then I accept that too,</p>
<p>instead of getting angry about it, and railing about it,</p>
<p>or seeing some cosmic meaning in it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s also a healthy non-attachment</p>
<p>in what you&rsquo;re saying too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, you mentioned Eastern thought,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, but also Buddha,</p>
<p>have kind of spoke of life as suffering.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s truth to that,</p>
<p>that suffering is a fundamental part of life?</p>
<p>I think it is a fundamental part of life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that means that life is suffering, right?</p>
<p>If we say, well, life is suffering, then what am I doing?</p>
<p>That I&rsquo;m trying to erase from my mind</p>
<p>the birth of my children, right?</p>
<p>Things that were filled with joy, right?</p>
<p>Life is not entirely suffering,</p>
<p>but life brings a lot of suffering.</p>
<p>And for some people, it brings such disproportionate</p>
<p>suffering, and the people don&rsquo;t survive the suffering.</p>
<p>And I think when people are conscientious and empathic,</p>
<p>that really bothers us, right?</p>
<p>The suffering in our own lives,</p>
<p>and the fact that others at times could seem</p>
<p>to be so overwhelmed by suffering</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t even get a chance to see good.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s, I do think there&rsquo;s truth to that,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s sadness and distress to that,</p>
<p>but to say, therefore, life is suffering,</p>
<p>I think is just completely untrue.</p>
<p>And it ignores the fact that someone even made a trombone,</p>
<p>right, let alone that there&rsquo;s a little bit out of sync,</p>
<p>and someone&rsquo;s playing the trombone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool, there&rsquo;s elements of the absurd</p>
<p>that you said are neat and interesting.</p>
<p>And if we start accepting that we can&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>or control everything, then we can accept,</p>
<p>and I think really love and foster the beauty in our lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the word suffering</p>
<p>is doing a little bit too much work,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s probably referring</p>
<p>to the philosophical concept of that,</p>
<p>yeah, that it&rsquo;s absurd, the absurdity,</p>
<p>that stuff just happens randomly.</p>
<p>Evil people succeed, good people fail.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a seeming random injustice on occasion,</p>
<p>and on occasion there&rsquo;s justice in, yeah,</p>
<p>all of it that feels like,</p>
<p>and maybe because often there&rsquo;s a lot of loss,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a kind of matching complimentary aspect</p>
<p>to any good feeling that all comes crashing down,</p>
<p>like every hello from a physics perspective</p>
<p>ends in a goodbye.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really sad thing.</p>
<p>You know, all the amazing people I get to meet in my life,</p>
<p>all the amazing experiences, eventually they have to end,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of what makes them amazing.</p>
<p>But why is that sad?</p>
<p>Is it because we&rsquo;re taught to think?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, look, at some point</p>
<p>you and I are gonna say goodbye today.</p>
<p>Like, I hope we&rsquo;re richer for it,</p>
<p>and then we take that goodness off with us.</p>
<p>Like, I wanna celebrate that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all part of the goodness.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re taught to think, oh, that&rsquo;s so bad,</p>
<p>and it equates to death and misery,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s often not that way.</p>
<p>I think there is a sadness to it,</p>
<p>but I also don&rsquo;t think that sadness is a negative thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different way to celebrate a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a melancholic nature to it,</p>
<p>something passing of it leaving.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s that old Louis C.K. thing</p>
<p>that I go back to over and over from his show, Louis,</p>
<p>where he was all heartbroken that he just broke up</p>
<p>with somebody he loved,</p>
<p>and he told about that to an old man,</p>
<p>and the old man said, you&rsquo;re a fool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best part.</p>
<p>I miss that part, where you sort of are lingering</p>
<p>in that loss.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling the pain of that loss,</p>
<p>because that lasts the longest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most intense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most reliable,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a kind of celebration of the love you had.</p>
<p>Losing the love is still a celebration of the love.</p>
<p>I think you don&rsquo;t want to over-romanticize that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some aspect of truth to that.</p>
<p>That melancholic feeling of remembering a beautiful time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s no longer there is a kind of celebration of it,</p>
<p>and is a kind of joyful experience,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s very easy to experience it</p>
<p>as a negative emotion.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just like you said.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s up to our mind to determine</p>
<p>how that emotion is really felt,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a tricky one,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like heartbreak to experience that</p>
<p>as a positive thing.</p>
<p>People can reminisce at funerals and laugh,</p>
<p>because people can be very, very, very sad</p>
<p>and perceive that this person has died</p>
<p>and perceive the sadness of it,</p>
<p>but in perceiving that and really living in it,</p>
<p>then you can have people who want to remember that person</p>
<p>by telling a funny story.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because each of those people carries that with them,</p>
<p>so I think what you&rsquo;re saying is consistent</p>
<p>with healthy function as human beings,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna encounter sadness and loss.</p>
<p>What do we do with that,</p>
<p>and do we do things that ultimately create some redemption</p>
<p>or even reparation inside of us?</p>
<p>Reparation&rsquo;s a big word in psychology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we repair damage and loss,</p>
<p>so if we lose someone and we&rsquo;re sad,</p>
<p>can we, by telling funny stories about that person,</p>
<p>remind ourselves that, hey, they&rsquo;re still inside of us.</p>
<p>Whether they&rsquo;re out there looking at me, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I can call that person to mind inside of us,</p>
<p>and then we have something that&rsquo;s good and beautiful</p>
<p>that comes of that, too.</p>
<p>In the introduction to your book on trauma,</p>
<p>Lady Gaga wrote it.</p>
<p>She wrote the foreword, the intro.</p>
<p>She said this about you, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can now say with certainty</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;that this man saved my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He made life worth living.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This goes to our discussion</p>
<p>about the mythosisyphus Camus question</p>
<p>about why I live.</p>
<p>So I think, at least to me,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s one of the most brilliant and unique artists ever,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a difficult question, but a question of creativity.</p>
<p>What role does trauma play in somebody like that,</p>
<p>in this artist that has created some incredible things?</p>
<p>What positive, constructive role does trauma serve,</p>
<p>and what limiting role does it serve</p>
<p>in preventing that person from flourishing more?</p>
<p>Trauma can certainly drive us to creativity,</p>
<p>even to push against or to protest against</p>
<p>what the trauma tells us.</p>
<p>Trauma tells us lessons, like nothing matters,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t matter, and nothing will ever be good,</p>
<p>and nothing is beautiful.</p>
<p>And we can push against trauma.</p>
<p>They know there is life in me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something, there&rsquo;s goodness for me</p>
<p>to spread in the world, to express and spread.</p>
<p>So I think trauma fuels creativity in many, many, many ways.</p>
<p>Trauma also shuts down creativity, right?</p>
<p>The people who are, it&rsquo;s one example,</p>
<p>trauma that escalates to the point</p>
<p>where now the person is soothing it with alcohol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one example.</p>
<p>And now the impact of the alcohol</p>
<p>shuts down any creativity.</p>
<p>So can people be creative</p>
<p>and outward-thinking without trauma?</p>
<p>I think sometimes, if I remember correctly,</p>
<p>people will use Immanuel Kant as an example,</p>
<p>someone who I think hadn&rsquo;t traveled much</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have trauma, and like, look at what he knew.</p>
<p>So okay, there are gonna be exceptions, right?</p>
<p>But a lot of our creativity is in some ways</p>
<p>fueled by our suffering, although it&rsquo;s complicated</p>
<p>because it comes from generative places in us, right?</p>
<p>So those places are there, they&rsquo;re not created by suffering,</p>
<p>but maybe suffering makes an incentive</p>
<p>or a passion inside of us.</p>
<p>And a person, Stephanie, who you referred to,</p>
<p>is just such an incredible, astounding creative force.</p>
<p>And sure, some of that comes from trauma,</p>
<p>some of it comes from trauma</p>
<p>fueling the generative, creative places in her.</p>
<p>But what I helped her to do,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s very generous with her words,</p>
<p>but what I helped her to do was to see</p>
<p>all that she is and all that the creativity in her is</p>
<p>and all that there is to create through love</p>
<p>and caring and compassion and to, again, see that.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of time, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing clinically.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s what good psychiatrists</p>
<p>or mental health professionals do</p>
<p>is we help people see the beauty that is there, right?</p>
<p>Because oftentimes, we&rsquo;re way too close up to that tapestry</p>
<p>and what brings us close is often the sad thing.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re up close and all we see is the negative.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s easy then to get classically nihilistic,</p>
<p>but by helping someone take a step back</p>
<p>and to see who they are and what&rsquo;s in them,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how people get better</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s how people re-engage in life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a difficult thing</p>
<p>because if you were to, from studying human beings,</p>
<p>it seems like the optimal trajectory</p>
<p>is having some trauma that doesn&rsquo;t destroy you</p>
<p>that forces you early in life to really struggle</p>
<p>with the intricacies of the human condition</p>
<p>and then later in life, as you form</p>
<p>and you build an expertise around and mastery,</p>
<p>start to do exactly what you said,</p>
<p>which is step back and look at the tapestry.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t have the trauma,</p>
<p>it seems like, just empirically speaking,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, of course, just a huge amount of data</p>
<p>and all kinds of anecdotal evidence,</p>
<p>and I wanna be careful here</p>
<p>because maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing hardship,</p>
<p>but it does seem that hardship in childhood,</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t break you, can be constructive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you said, having that trauma,</p>
<p>one of the ways to fight it is to say,</p>
<p>I am worth something.</p>
<p>David Goggins talks about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is, I am somebody.</p>
<p>I can be somebody special, and I&rsquo;m gonna prove it to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do this big thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this engine that drives you forward.</p>
<p>Yeah, comment on that because from a parent&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>you want a child to have an easy life, right?</p>
<p>You want them to not have hardship,</p>
<p>certainly not have trauma, but that&rsquo;s such a difficult dance</p>
<p>because in some ways, a little bit of hardship</p>
<p>and a gradually increasing amount of hardship</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t break you can really develop you</p>
<p>into a really interesting, complicated person,</p>
<p>and it helps you flourish as a creative being.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a question.</p>
<p>I just keep saying random things.</p>
<p>No, look, I think it makes good sense to me.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;re trying to get at,</p>
<p>we need trauma, and how are we defining it, right?</p>
<p>Because we say trauma, hardship, difficulties.</p>
<p>I mean, we could set aside, we could set apart, say,</p>
<p>and differentiate things that are difficult</p>
<p>but that are overcomable, right?</p>
<p>Versus things that we could use trauma,</p>
<p>the word trauma this way if we chose to,</p>
<p>that are just entirely negative,</p>
<p>like someone saying, oh, you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll never succeed because what?</p>
<p>And then they tell you something about yourself,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re from here, or you&rsquo;re this race, religion,</p>
<p>whatever it is, right?</p>
<p>We think, well, that could make someone say,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m gonna show you, I&rsquo;m gonna overcome, right?</p>
<p>But then they&rsquo;re overcoming something bad, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s nothing good or helpful about that, right,</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s saying that.</p>
<p>So the person has to overcome it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different than something</p>
<p>that is placed in front of a person</p>
<p>where the whole conception of it is something positive</p>
<p>that you can make through effort, right?</p>
<p>So I remember, I don&rsquo;t know, I think I was 15 years old,</p>
<p>there was some rule where you could then go,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was picking raspberries or blueberries,</p>
<p>right, and I think, and my parents wanted me to see,</p>
<p>like, hey, go see how that works,</p>
<p>and now you got 50 cents at the end of it, right?</p>
<p>And then you think about that</p>
<p>when you wanna buy baseball cards,</p>
<p>or you think about it, and you work hard.</p>
<p>And I can remember it was hard,</p>
<p>and I was sweating, and I was tired,</p>
<p>but I learned from it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the reason I remember it today.</p>
<p>So yes, parents might want their kids</p>
<p>to have, like, a good life, right,</p>
<p>but not necessarily an easy life, you know?</p>
<p>And I think that was done, they took me to do that</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;d have a greater sense of responsibility</p>
<p>and a sense of, like, hard work is meaningful,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And I think that that kind of thing is good,</p>
<p>but if we separate that from something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just denigrating, prejudicial,</p>
<p>like, I think those things aren&rsquo;t good,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re unavoidable.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not necessarily that, oh, is some trauma good?</p>
<p>I would look at it more that some trauma&rsquo;s unavoidable.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to, how do you go through life</p>
<p>and not have any losses or anything negative</p>
<p>or anything sad?</p>
<p>And then people are people.</p>
<p>There may be people who have not a lot of that,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a sort of complacency,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t do as much as they could</p>
<p>or feel as good as they could.</p>
<p>You know, then there&rsquo;s other people</p>
<p>who have a highly attuned emotional,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s people with very highly attuned</p>
<p>emotional compasses for which a little bit</p>
<p>of trauma becomes so intrusive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s so much of it is person-driven,</p>
<p>but I do want to distinguish between things</p>
<p>that are just purely bad, that we might overcome</p>
<p>or find some fire in our belly about,</p>
<p>or whatever the case may be,</p>
<p>and things that may be boundaries or barriers,</p>
<p>either purposely placed or not,</p>
<p>that in a sense invite us or inform us</p>
<p>of the possibility of striving and overcoming.</p>
<p>Finally, attuned emotional compasses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true that there is, that&rsquo;s a component of it, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost genetic, how sensitive you are</p>
<p>to a particular trauma, so little things</p>
<p>can have a huge impact, or gigantic things,</p>
<p>serious abuse in childhood can be,</p>
<p>by some people, overcome more easily.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just what&rsquo;s the trauma,</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s the trauma that makes certain problems?</p>
<p>You have to match the trauma to the person,</p>
<p>and a big part of what you&rsquo;re matching to</p>
<p>is that genetically-based characteristic</p>
<p>of how finely attuned is that</p>
<p>empathic attunement to that compass.</p>
<p>So when you think about, let&rsquo;s just return to childhood.</p>
<p>When you think about trauma in childhood,</p>
<p>what can we say about the impact of child abuse</p>
<p>on the development of a human being?</p>
<p>I think the impact of it is so disproportionately</p>
<p>bad and hurtful compared to things</p>
<p>that happen when we&rsquo;re not children,</p>
<p>and I want to be very careful about how I&rsquo;m saying that,</p>
<p>because people can, through their strength</p>
<p>and resilience and human interconnectedness,</p>
<p>can overcome that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say that anyone who&rsquo;s experienced</p>
<p>those things can&rsquo;t make it through it or over it.</p>
<p>That part is not true, but it is true</p>
<p>that the impact is so disproportionate</p>
<p>to anything else that can happen,</p>
<p>because the brain is formulating, right?</p>
<p>So if we say psychology is like applied neurobiology,</p>
<p>and we look at both of those as different ends,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s a lot of gray in the middle,</p>
<p>the neurobiology is changed.</p>
<p>So just one example of a much greater salience</p>
<p>of vigilance mechanisms, of mechanisms of self-protection,</p>
<p>mechanisms that can make a person feel more fear</p>
<p>and more insecurity and hide themselves away from the world</p>
<p>and not trust the world.</p>
<p>And I mean not trust the world even enough</p>
<p>that, oh, I&rsquo;d like to have a better job,</p>
<p>and another one is here that I could take,</p>
<p>but maybe it could be worse,</p>
<p>and then being afraid of that, right?</p>
<p>There are all sorts of ways in which the changes</p>
<p>to those pathways impact someone,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just one of, we could bring trauma experts</p>
<p>together that could talk about that for days, right?</p>
<p>What is the impact upon the brain biology?</p>
<p>So that then gets changed inside the person,</p>
<p>and from the perspective of those changes,</p>
<p>the psychology on top of it changes.</p>
<p>Like what do I think about myself?</p>
<p>Do I think that I&rsquo;m worthwhile?</p>
<p>Even in my mid-20s, without formative traumas</p>
<p>and a pretty strong sense of self and some achievements,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big trauma then with the death of my brother,</p>
<p>and I start questioning, am I cursed?</p>
<p>Am I worth anything?</p>
<p>I mean, I was 20-something years old</p>
<p>and doing reasonably well at the time.</p>
<p>You know, how does this impact a child</p>
<p>of six, seven, 10, 12 years old, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sending such powerful messages</p>
<p>that then change conception of self,</p>
<p>and that negatively changed conception</p>
<p>sits upon the negatively changed neurobiology,</p>
<p>and I think if we really thought,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s do the best we can just for humans in general,</p>
<p>for the human race, for species in general,</p>
<p>is we would handle children</p>
<p>and caring for children so much differently</p>
<p>in terms of protection mechanisms, intervention mechanisms.</p>
<p>How many times do you see where,</p>
<p>where like now there&rsquo;s been some tragedy</p>
<p>and the child gets a little bit of support,</p>
<p>and they had some therapy that was provided</p>
<p>by some insurance carrier that they got once a week</p>
<p>for 16 weeks or whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, we should be wrapping our societal resources</p>
<p>around children, but we don&rsquo;t use our resources well.</p>
<p>You know, I was just reading, it&rsquo;s a little bit of an aside,</p>
<p>but about 300 and something billion dollars a year</p>
<p>in cost to the U.S. economy just from schizophrenia.</p>
<p>And you think, it costs a fraction,</p>
<p>what do we actually put into caring</p>
<p>for people who have schizophrenia?</p>
<p>So first there&rsquo;s a moral imperative,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say we put that aside,</p>
<p>and we only care about the economy, right?</p>
<p>Because there are mechanisms of thinking</p>
<p>that look at it that way.</p>
<p>How could we not amend that, right?</p>
<p>But we are so reckless with our resources,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re tripping ahead of ourselves</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t think, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>there is no better place on God&rsquo;s earth</p>
<p>for prevention than here,</p>
<p>prevention in terms of human suffering,</p>
<p>and also where do people like that go?</p>
<p>I mean, more often, people like that go</p>
<p>to a place of increased suffering,</p>
<p>inability to take care of themselves,</p>
<p>or to be in supportive relationships.</p>
<p>Okay, we know there&rsquo;s a higher prevalence of that,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also creating the pool of people</p>
<p>through which the envy, the narcissism,</p>
<p>the sociopathy, the destruction arises.</p>
<p>So again, if we care about people,</p>
<p>we would be so focused on that.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t care about other people,</p>
<p>and just ourselves, or just economic costs,</p>
<p>we would still be so focused.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not, and we tend to just kind of call it good</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t see anything disastrous</p>
<p>happening at the moment.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a societal negligence there,</p>
<p>to the shame, really, of all of us,</p>
<p>when child abuse and the impact neurobiologically</p>
<p>and psychologically is potentially</p>
<p>the greatest cause of suffering directly</p>
<p>and indirectly on the face of the planet.</p>
<p>How much does trauma of that kind,</p>
<p>and later in life affect your ability</p>
<p>to love another human being, say, inside a relationship,</p>
<p>connect with another human being?</p>
<p>It can impact it a lot.</p>
<p>And again, I wanna say, can people overcome</p>
<p>and be as loving to a partner, or a child,</p>
<p>or anyone else, yes.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re talking across society, right?</p>
<p>How are we setting the odds, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re setting the odds towards a higher sense of vigilance,</p>
<p>a decreased sense of self-confidence,</p>
<p>an increased sense of vulnerability, right?</p>
<p>A decreased comfort interacting with others, right?</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re pushing towards isolation</p>
<p>and misery and depression and resentment.</p>
<p>I mean, those factors push towards that.</p>
<p>We know that the research is so strong</p>
<p>that adverse childhood experiences,</p>
<p>that these things that happen,</p>
<p>the more the worse, the more prolonged,</p>
<p>the more that person is up against</p>
<p>as they try and navigate life.</p>
<p>And I suppose one of the elements of intimacy,</p>
<p>like what we&rsquo;re talking about, is vulnerability.</p>
<p>And maybe there&rsquo;s a, is there a fear of being vulnerable,</p>
<p>of being hurt again?</p>
<p>Is that ultimately the barrier to intimacy?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you&rsquo;re taught a lesson that says,</p>
<p>the world is not safe,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not good enough for someone to keep safe,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not strong enough to keep yourself safe,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a final common pathway</p>
<p>of the vast majority of child abuse,</p>
<p>is telling those lessons to people.</p>
<p>Then how can that not change the lay of the land</p>
<p>against openness, against the ability</p>
<p>to rationally consider trust and mutuality</p>
<p>and to protect oneself, but also take chances</p>
<p>and do the things that we have to do</p>
<p>to create the greatest happiness in our lives?</p>
<p>We set the odds so much against that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another pathway,</p>
<p>which I think is really interesting</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve seen it in people,</p>
<p>is this kind of ability to detach yourself</p>
<p>from feeling any emotions, to protect yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re not quite there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a word for it, isolation of affect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Isolation of affect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that a common way, another common way</p>
<p>to deal with trauma?</p>
<p>Well, isolation of affect can cut both ways.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s been a major trauma,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say someone has seen something terrible</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re isolated from their affect.</p>
<p>At one time, it was thought, well, maybe that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not hysterical, they&rsquo;re not distraught,</p>
<p>but we see that is not good</p>
<p>because what needs to be held, processed,</p>
<p>we need to get our arms around in some way, shape or form</p>
<p>has just been separated off.</p>
<p>So we know that is not good,</p>
<p>but isolation of affect can also serve us very well.</p>
<p>When I think back to being an intern,</p>
<p>a medical intern in the hospital,</p>
<p>and you might have to go and pronounce someone dead</p>
<p>with hysterical family members,</p>
<p>and then 10 minutes later, five minutes later,</p>
<p>maybe two minutes later, really,</p>
<p>you have to go to another room</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got to maybe do some procedure</p>
<p>that involves having your focus on a certain thing</p>
<p>and making sure your hand movements are the right way</p>
<p>or talking to a person in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very different than where you just came from,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very hopeful.</p>
<p>So then you have to isolate the affect</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on around you.</p>
<p>And it happens not just in, it&rsquo;s just one example,</p>
<p>but we have to do it in life</p>
<p>so that we can put affect aside to process later</p>
<p>or not feel the full weight of affect</p>
<p>where we know the meaning.</p>
<p>Like I knew the meaning of the tragedy</p>
<p>of the person I just pronounced dead,</p>
<p>but I want to separate that from myself</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m also aware that it&rsquo;s not my tragedy</p>
<p>so that I can then, okay, put that affect aside</p>
<p>and go do the next thing that I have to do.</p>
<p>So that, I think, can cut both ways.</p>
<p>Right, but then you have to reattach it,</p>
<p>understand that it&rsquo;s good to be close with emotion,</p>
<p>even painful emotion, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the human experience.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I feel like if you build up a skill</p>
<p>that you can detach yourself from emotion,</p>
<p>I think that can become its own kind of,</p>
<p>yeah, it becomes too easy to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, and to reinforce.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when people are suffering too much</p>
<p>over too long a period of time,</p>
<p>then, you know, we&rsquo;re creatures of habit, right?</p>
<p>And even though our brains are,</p>
<p>you talk about our brains are sitting on the shoulders</p>
<p>of the giant of the maybe thousand levels of emergence</p>
<p>that come underneath of them,</p>
<p>our brains are also,</p>
<p>also work in very simple habit-based ways.</p>
<p>Like if you and I chose a word right now</p>
<p>and said it 500 times,</p>
<p>we would know it&rsquo;s just a silly experiment,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;d both be saying it tonight, right?</p>
<p>Because our brains are also creatures of habit.</p>
<p>So if you over and over and over</p>
<p>have to isolate yourself from affect</p>
<p>and you develop those mechanisms,</p>
<p>well, you develop those mechanisms</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t go away any easier</p>
<p>than if we said the word 500 times and decided to forget.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t forget no matter what we decided.</p>
<p>So how do we find our way back?</p>
<p>How do we overcome trauma?</p>
<p>What are the different pathways?</p>
<p>The first thing, the very first thing</p>
<p>is to acknowledge to ourselves and often to others,</p>
<p>which might be one other person,</p>
<p>it might be in words, spoken, it might be written,</p>
<p>what the trauma has been, right?</p>
<p>Because the lessons of trauma,</p>
<p>the evil lessons of trauma,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll use the example of my own life,</p>
<p>the lesson that told me that I was shameful,</p>
<p>cursed, and hopeless, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very evil lesson, right?</p>
<p>But my brain will say it over and did say it</p>
<p>over and over and over to me.</p>
<p>And if that just sits inside, that&rsquo;s how trauma festers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how trauma hijacks our thoughts, our emotions.</p>
<p>So being able to say to ourselves and to another,</p>
<p>like, this is what&rsquo;s happened, right?</p>
<p>Okay, this is what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re built to massage words</p>
<p>and to create meaning through words, right?</p>
<p>Like, we don&rsquo;t massage pictures, right, images.</p>
<p>We talk and massage meaning with words.</p>
<p>So when I finally went to see a therapist</p>
<p>and I could say, you know,</p>
<p>my brother, whatever words I would have said,</p>
<p>like, he killed himself and I can&rsquo;t accept it</p>
<p>or I can&rsquo;t imagine it and like, I let it happen.</p>
<p>Like, so I had to say those things, right?</p>
<p>So then I could begin to bring some sense of truth to it,</p>
<p>you know, and it was a long time ago,</p>
<p>but the therapist probably said something like,</p>
<p>okay, probably sees on you, you let it happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your fault, right?</p>
<p>Because you got to get at those things</p>
<p>so that one can begin to bring into focus</p>
<p>what does the trauma mean and what does it not mean?</p>
<p>I mean, a classic example is the,</p>
<p>what would you say to someone else example?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ll say, well, I,</p>
<p>now, how many times have I,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just, I could cry if I stop and think about it enough.</p>
<p>Stop and talk to someone who is sexually assaulted</p>
<p>through no fault of their own,</p>
<p>who comes in and tells the story</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been telling themselves about how it&rsquo;s their fault.</p>
<p>They should have walked home a different way,</p>
<p>they should have dressed differently,</p>
<p>they should have left earlier, right?</p>
<p>I wrote about it in the book over and over and over.</p>
<p>Now, you have a person who,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you take a person who&rsquo;s intelligent,</p>
<p>engaged in the world, who&rsquo;s capable of understanding</p>
<p>lots and lots and lots of things,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t understand that, right?</p>
<p>If it were someone else,</p>
<p>that person would understand in a moment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not that person&rsquo;s fault, right?</p>
<p>So what you wanna do is overcome the fact</p>
<p>that the negative emotions,</p>
<p>the hijacked emotion systems of trauma</p>
<p>are telling that person a lie,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re telling them so strongly</p>
<p>and so awfully, so meanly,</p>
<p>that the person just takes it inside</p>
<p>and starts to see it as true, right?</p>
<p>So you begin to hold that up to the light of day.</p>
<p>And again, one example could be,</p>
<p>okay, so someone, the person who&rsquo;s coming in next</p>
<p>has actually been through something similar, right?</p>
<p>And do you mind, can you stay</p>
<p>and just tell her how it&rsquo;s her fault, right?</p>
<p>And like, oh my God, no, oh,</p>
<p>because I could never, like, then they see, right?</p>
<p>And again, this is not always how you do it,</p>
<p>but sometimes you can get a person to see,</p>
<p>like, well, that would be the most horrible.</p>
<p>How could you do that?</p>
<p>Right, and the person can maybe commit</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing it to themselves.</p>
<p>So you begin to put words in a structure</p>
<p>and say, okay, let&rsquo;s look at what&rsquo;s going on inside of you.</p>
<p>Like, you don&rsquo;t have to be scared</p>
<p>of anything you&rsquo;re thinking and feeling.</p>
<p>In fact, the fear is in not exposing it</p>
<p>to the light of day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where it gets the best of us.</p>
<p>And now, like, everything is different.</p>
<p>And whether that involves use of medications</p>
<p>for intrusive thoughts and depression,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s no medicines needed, but it&rsquo;s all reframing.</p>
<p>Like, whatever it may be that comes next,</p>
<p>the whole world has changed</p>
<p>when the person has acknowledged what&rsquo;s happened,</p>
<p>exposed it to themselves and to trusted others around them,</p>
<p>and begun to look at it in some way</p>
<p>other than the stuffed-in-an-evil-box place</p>
<p>that the trauma initially puts us</p>
<p>through the refluxes it creates in us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that there&rsquo;s power</p>
<p>to just saying it out loud.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So first, saying your perception of it out loud.</p>
<p>Then in that case, that might be your fault.</p>
<p>And then working out loud,</p>
<p>working through that it may not be.</p>
<p>Any experienced therapist will tell you this,</p>
<p>that every now and then it will happen</p>
<p>that someone will come, and they&rsquo;ll say something.</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s very early on in the process.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say something they&rsquo;ve never said before,</p>
<p>and they immediately are in an entirely different place,</p>
<p>and they may have been for decades.</p>
<p>Right, and I can remember a person saying</p>
<p>that a coach had raped him, and just saying it.</p>
<p>This was decades before, and everything was different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying everything is now as perfect,</p>
<p>but his life was in a different place.</p>
<p>As soon as he said it, he could see.</p>
<p>How dare, he thought that person did that to this child.</p>
<p>The child was me.</p>
<p>He never thought it until he said it out loud,</p>
<p>because his mind was going over and over</p>
<p>with why it was his fault, what he did to deserve it,</p>
<p>how he kept going back, so it must be his fault.</p>
<p>It was in it.</p>
<p>As soon as he put words to it, he saw the truth of it,</p>
<p>and it was a bifurcation in the path of life then.</p>
<p>And any therapist has stories like that,</p>
<p>which just shows the immense power</p>
<p>that it can even be that just uttering the words</p>
<p>makes just a cascade of change all at once.</p>
<p>Just saying those words to another human being,</p>
<p>it makes you wonder about that compulsive loop</p>
<p>that happens in our heads,</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s brought to the surface.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Entirely nonproductive, the loops,</p>
<p>and sometimes even if we put, what would I say to another?</p>
<p>Let me write it down, it can get rid of those loops</p>
<p>in our brains.</p>
<p>Any even thought of outward expression</p>
<p>is the enemy of those internal,</p>
<p>persecutory negative thought loops.</p>
<p>How do you find a good therapist?</p>
<p>I tend to think of, listen, I&rsquo;m a fan of podcasts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of conversations.</p>
<p>It feels like a, it&rsquo;s like finding a good friend</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>It feels like a difficult journey.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong in that, but it just feels like such a,</p>
<p>it feels like a partnership, a journey together</p>
<p>versus like some very simple clinical procedure.</p>
<p>Well, the first thing I would say is</p>
<p>to change the entire paradigm.</p>
<p>Like most people, like okay, I need a therapist.</p>
<p>So people feel often like they&rsquo;re in a weakened position</p>
<p>because they need, you know, quote unquote, a therapist.</p>
<p>Then therapists are rationed, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you hear how many insurance panels</p>
<p>have lists a mile long of qualified therapists</p>
<p>who could be on that insurance panel,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a certification process.</p>
<p>Like these just make no sense, right?</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s already certified the person, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many barriers to entry</p>
<p>that now we&rsquo;re rationing this resource,</p>
<p>which we should all stop and pause for a second</p>
<p>and think like we&rsquo;re okay with that as a society.</p>
<p>And by the way, everything else is like that too</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re trying to get help for our health.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s step back from that for a second.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a resource that&rsquo;s not in great supply.</p>
<p>And then a person begins to think, you know,</p>
<p>essentially I&rsquo;ll take what I can get.</p>
<p>Like I just gotta get somebody</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know enough to know anyway, right?</p>
<p>And those are very disempowering thoughts</p>
<p>as opposed to saying, look,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be an empowered consumer</p>
<p>and I need to choose someone who gets over</p>
<p>just some basic hurdles of what I think</p>
<p>are reasonable human interaction, right?</p>
<p>So like is the person making eye contact?</p>
<p>Do they seem interested, right?</p>
<p>Like these are basic points about any human interaction,</p>
<p>including a therapist, right?</p>
<p>Then you can say, okay, is there word of mouth?</p>
<p>Anyone else who has something good?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing better than a word of mouth recommendation</p>
<p>from someone you trust, right?</p>
<p>Or anybody can have a good website,</p>
<p>but you say, let me look at the website.</p>
<p>What is it saying if there is one, right?</p>
<p>Does it resonate with me or not, right?</p>
<p>But after all of that, then you go to see the person</p>
<p>with the idea that you&rsquo;re interviewing them, right?</p>
<p>The idea that, yeah, I hope this person can help me</p>
<p>and if so, great, I&rsquo;m with the program,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m thinking about it.</p>
<p>Do I want this person?</p>
<p>Do I feel heard?</p>
<p>Do I feel cared for?</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t mean, is it easy, right?</p>
<p>It might mean, is it hard?</p>
<p>And I leave and I feel like emotional for a couple of days,</p>
<p>but I see that I&rsquo;m facing new things.</p>
<p>No, this process of assessment</p>
<p>so that one isn&rsquo;t settling for something</p>
<p>that is formulaic, over-packaged,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not trying to be overly critical of therapists.</p>
<p>I mean, there are people everywhere who do their jobs well</p>
<p>and people who don&rsquo;t do their jobs well,</p>
<p>but most therapists are working in systems</p>
<p>that push against doing the job well, right?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re rationing care</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of number of sessions</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s enough and such time before a person can return.</p>
<p>And so often it&rsquo;s an uphill battle</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re trying to be helped</p>
<p>within systems we&rsquo;ve created and tolerate</p>
<p>that are pushing against helping us.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that interview process is tricky.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re in a rough place mentally,</p>
<p>just like with any kind of interview,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard not to think that a failed interaction,</p>
<p>failed interview, there&rsquo;s something wrong with you.</p>
<p>Sure, right.</p>
<p>There is an authority to a therapist, I think,</p>
<p>where you think like, they&rsquo;ve got it all figured out.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a mess and therefore if there&rsquo;s something off,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all my fault, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very tricky and it&rsquo;s easy to then give up</p>
<p>because that step to try to get a therapist,</p>
<p>the first step to get help, forget therapist,</p>
<p>like any kind of help, that&rsquo;s a big leap to take,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re in a rough place.</p>
<p>I agree completely.</p>
<p>We should not make people swim against such a strong current</p>
<p>to get their needs met.</p>
<p>I mean, we see this in such obvious places</p>
<p>where an elderly homebound person</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t get their medicine</p>
<p>because, oh, there&rsquo;s been some change</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t put the new number into the form</p>
<p>or Lord knows what.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible how we force people</p>
<p>to swim against strong currents</p>
<p>to get things that are just basic</p>
<p>at times for their survival.</p>
<p>And with that in mind, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of respect</p>
<p>for where healthcare is at or where mental health is at.</p>
<p>The field that I work in has accepted</p>
<p>all sorts of aspects of how things go.</p>
<p>Someone else controlling how long the interaction can go on,</p>
<p>how the interaction is bounded,</p>
<p>what can be said and done,</p>
<p>what medicines can be prescribed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many external controls in the systems we work in</p>
<p>that we, and I say me included,</p>
<p>like all of us in the field,</p>
<p>have let it get to a place</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s obscenely difficult to get help,</p>
<p>obscenely difficult.</p>
<p>And we should say that&rsquo;s not okay.</p>
<p>I think psychiatrists and therapists</p>
<p>and master&rsquo;s level social workers, psychologists,</p>
<p>and you name it, I think we should all say this is not okay.</p>
<p>And then we as a society should be saying this is not okay.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>which is I think completely true,</p>
<p>will only become worse as there&rsquo;s more and more barriers</p>
<p>to getting the help a person needs.</p>
<p>And each time a person isn&rsquo;t helped,</p>
<p>it sets the odds against them getting more help.</p>
<p>I should say here that when I started working,</p>
<p>there were times I would send people to an emergency room,</p>
<p>if there was some emergency in their mental health</p>
<p>and they were at risk.</p>
<p>And there were times I&rsquo;d send somebody to an emergency room</p>
<p>where if you stopped and looked,</p>
<p>it would have been malpractice not to do that.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not just me who has an incredibly high threshold</p>
<p>for sending someone to an emergency room</p>
<p>because you send someone who&rsquo;s in a lot of distress</p>
<p>and oftentimes they&rsquo;re sitting on a gurney in a hallway</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re locked in a small white room</p>
<p>and all they had was depression.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just scared when they go in</p>
<p>and 36 hours later, oh, they&rsquo;re feeling a little better.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re desperate to get out of there</p>
<p>and someone sends them home.</p>
<p>I mean, so our systems have shifted so much</p>
<p>that we tolerate now en masse</p>
<p>what is egregious to the individual.</p>
<p>So you are a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>In terms of doing therapy, psychotherapy,</p>
<p>what does the successful interaction look like?</p>
<p>Perhaps a fun question.</p>
<p>Perhaps not.</p>
<p>What do you think of the psychiatrist</p>
<p>Sean and Goodwill Hunting played by Robin Williams?</p>
<p>So what is the full range of interesting interactions?</p>
<p>Can there be an intimacy, a friendship,</p>
<p>a kind of varied interaction that kind of blends the lines</p>
<p>of 30 minute session once a week or whatever</p>
<p>versus like a really kind of deliberate long-term project</p>
<p>that cares about the wellbeing of a person</p>
<p>across the months and years?</p>
<p>Or what can you say about a successful interaction</p>
<p>between therapist and patient?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re much better served by the latter.</p>
<p>Right, and again, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be over years.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe a person might need that over weeks.</p>
<p>They might need it over months.</p>
<p>They might need it over years.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m understanding correctly,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re describing something that is</p>
<p>like a real human engagement.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I work in a field that for years and years and years,</p>
<p>the patient didn&rsquo;t get to see,</p>
<p>the therapist was sitting in a place,</p>
<p>sitting behind the person, right?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not, of course, the only tradition</p>
<p>and there are aspects of that tradition</p>
<p>that can be very humanized.</p>
<p>But the idea that we&rsquo;re supposed to not be human,</p>
<p>I mean, this medicine is shot through with this, right?</p>
<p>That the doctor&rsquo;s supposed to be God</p>
<p>and it protects the doctor.</p>
<p>And that makes its way into therapy.</p>
<p>And the idea of the superiority,</p>
<p>the therapist knows more.</p>
<p>I mean, in some ways, yes,</p>
<p>but the idea is to know more about mechanical things,</p>
<p>right, to know more about facts and knowledge,</p>
<p>not as a human being, right?</p>
<p>If we approach therapy as a collaborative human endeavor,</p>
<p>right, where if we&rsquo;re gonna do it together,</p>
<p>of course I&rsquo;m gonna learn from you too, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re two human beings</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about things that are deep</p>
<p>and personal and intimate and I&rsquo;m not gonna participate</p>
<p>in a way that makes it about me as much as it&rsquo;s about you,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re two humans and what&rsquo;s going on in me</p>
<p>may have relevance and sharing it may have relevance.</p>
<p>And at times, you doing something back for me</p>
<p>may have relevance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you an example of a person</p>
<p>who would not let me help him.</p>
<p>It was a young man.</p>
<p>So when I was in training, he was very, very sick</p>
<p>and needed to change certain choices and habits</p>
<p>or he was not gonna survive.</p>
<p>And I had no ability to help him whatsoever.</p>
<p>And I went and I saw a supervisor</p>
<p>who was existentially trained,</p>
<p>where here it&rsquo;s different from existentialism</p>
<p>in the classic sense,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s about really human connection, right?</p>
<p>And the guy was always wanting to teach me something, right?</p>
<p>Because I can get by in Spanish,</p>
<p>but he was fluent in Spanish.</p>
<p>And he wanted, oh, you traveled here</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d say a word to see if I knew.</p>
<p>And I was always directing back</p>
<p>to what I was supposed to do, right?</p>
<p>And the supervisor, I&rsquo;ll never forget,</p>
<p>he said, let him teach you Spanish.</p>
<p>Like, okay, come on.</p>
<p>So we had a couple sessions where if you look</p>
<p>from the outside, you say, what is going on there?</p>
<p>Like, right, like they were Spanish lessons to me, right?</p>
<p>And then at some point he brought in his mother</p>
<p>and we hadn&rsquo;t brought her in yet.</p>
<p>And he was in part showing off</p>
<p>that he taught me something, right?</p>
<p>And I said a couple things and he felt more powerful.</p>
<p>Like he was younger than me</p>
<p>and he felt sick and disempowered,</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t feel that way once he taught me something</p>
<p>and we showed it off to his mother, right?</p>
<p>And his behavior started to change.</p>
<p>He started taking better care of himself.</p>
<p>He could see a little more what I was saying.</p>
<p>It was like, you&rsquo;re a wonderful person.</p>
<p>Look, you love your mother and your aunt and they love you.</p>
<p>And like, he could start seeing that about himself.</p>
<p>But that came from humanness.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the way we help people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why we don&rsquo;t do everything that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;re two humans,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re doing something for me,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s something, you have an expertise and I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re doing it for me.</p>
<p>The reverse could be true,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re not just two humans</p>
<p>doing something together.</p>
<p>And the healthcare system and the legal system</p>
<p>should not get in the way of that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s liability and all these kinds of things</p>
<p>that can get in the way of the humanness.</p>
<p>I mean, some of that is justified.</p>
<p>You have to be careful.</p>
<p>You have to make sure there&rsquo;s irresponsible,</p>
<p>but a little too much can destroy the humanness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use it where I don&rsquo;t usually say something is insane.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not consistent with sanity.</p>
<p>And the presence of the legal system,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for, of course, physicians have to be held,</p>
<p>we have to be responsible and everybody makes mistakes</p>
<p>and people have to be accountable for their mistakes.</p>
<p>I understand all of that.</p>
<p>But what we see now, it&rsquo;s so absurd that,</p>
<p>oh, like everyone is frightened, right?</p>
<p>Everyone is frightened and just looking to like,</p>
<p>how do I slot into the box,</p>
<p>check the boxes of what I&rsquo;m supposed to do</p>
<p>and not get in trouble.</p>
<p>People get sued because someone was at that hospital</p>
<p>and that doctor touched their care.</p>
<p>This happens in the VA system.</p>
<p>It happens in other systems too.</p>
<p>So you might&rsquo;ve touched their care</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s even saying you did anything wrong,</p>
<p>but they say the next person did.</p>
<p>Oh, someone settled on your behalf</p>
<p>and now you have a malpractice.</p>
<p>Ding and maybe you can&rsquo;t get a license somewhere else.</p>
<p>Like doctors are terrified and they&rsquo;re terrified for good,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re terrified for good reason</p>
<p>because the same society that has given doctors</p>
<p>in many ways too much power over time</p>
<p>and treated doctors maybe too much like gods,</p>
<p>now is I think enacting some of society&rsquo;s anger</p>
<p>and envy out on the physicians.</p>
<p>Even the idea that like a person would know what medicine,</p>
<p>like I saw a couple of TV commercials, give me this.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s interesting, right?</p>
<p>Because even if, let&rsquo;s say I take myself out of it,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t feel good, obviously,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, wow, I went to school</p>
<p>for like eight years for this</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t even want to hear my opinion, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not taking good care of yourself, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you should think my opinion is gospel</p>
<p>because I said it, but people then don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>an understanding of like, what is expertise?</p>
<p>What do people learn?</p>
<p>How can people help us understand</p>
<p>and make better decisions?</p>
<p>It kind of goes out with the wash</p>
<p>and then the position of the expert,</p>
<p>I mean, a lot has been written about this, right?</p>
<p>Gets diminished over time very much to our own peril.</p>
<p>And then often with aggression in the medical world</p>
<p>coming back towards the alleged expert.</p>
<p>Yeah, expertise is a tricky one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a tricky thing because</p>
<p>coupled with expertise, the attention is this arrogance</p>
<p>that can come with expertise.</p>
<p>The arrogance can make the expert feel</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re more of an expert and it&rsquo;s a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>And then the arrogance in the current, in the 21st century,</p>
<p>especially with the internet,</p>
<p>the arrogance can completely force the public</p>
<p>to distrust the expert</p>
<p>because all they see is the arrogance versus the expertise.</p>
<p>So ultimately you have to have,</p>
<p>I think the greatest experts and masters I know</p>
<p>are the ones that have complete humility.</p>
<p>Right, humility and gratitude.</p>
<p>And gratitude.</p>
<p>Leads us back.</p>
<p>Which is usually a really good sign</p>
<p>that somebody is at the top of their field.</p>
<p>Right, and they&rsquo;ll acknowledge</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t know everything.</p>
<p>Right, which is hilarious, right?</p>
<p>So the best experts I know are the ones</p>
<p>that will say that they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They will not call themselves an expert.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very confusing.</p>
<p>Or know that they know a lot</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t know the answer to this.</p>
<p>You see that a lot in medicine.</p>
<p>That person knows they&rsquo;re an expert surgeon</p>
<p>but they also acknowledge they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if this is the right time to operate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you get to the best answer</p>
<p>instead of someone who is an expert</p>
<p>and always knows the answer.</p>
<p>Yeah, if we actually rewind</p>
<p>to the beginning of our conversation,</p>
<p>we talked about, you mentioned something</p>
<p>I wanted to return to.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s layers that are,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an emergent novelty.</p>
<p>And you mentioned that we as human beings</p>
<p>and we introspect on our own mind,</p>
<p>we really can&rsquo;t know most of it.</p>
<p>Which of course makes me think of this,</p>
<p>the unconscious mind, subconscious mind,</p>
<p>and Carl Jung.</p>
<p>How much is hiding there in the shadows?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve investigated a lot of trauma.</p>
<p>How much is there in our mind</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not directly accessible to us?</p>
<p>Like what can you say maybe philosophically</p>
<p>about how much is there lurking in the Jungian shadow?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount there.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t immediately go to</p>
<p>an ominous perspective, right?</p>
<p>Because if it&rsquo;s lurking there, right,</p>
<p>it can come get us, right?</p>
<p>And to some extent, that&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>So the seeds of evil are there</p>
<p>if we want to plant and nurture them.</p>
<p>You think good things can&rsquo;t lurk?</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>I was being poetic.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And the Jungian shadow is supposed to</p>
<p>not just be dark things, it&rsquo;s supposed to be everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be a lot of positive things as well, yeah.</p>
<p>Right, which I think brings us to self-knowledge,</p>
<p>to truth, where I think the opposite of envy,</p>
<p>narcissism, sociopathy, I do think</p>
<p>is all rooted in truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both the truth of the good things about us</p>
<p>or the ways we&rsquo;re not blameworthy</p>
<p>for the things we&rsquo;re blaming ourselves for, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the self-knowledge and the truth</p>
<p>and getting away from the reflex of anger,</p>
<p>frustration, envy, shame, what I think happens then</p>
<p>is all of that underneath the surface.</p>
<p>If we look at the consciousness as the top of the iceberg,</p>
<p>you know, outside the top, outside the water.</p>
<p>So is what&rsquo;s underneath like shifting</p>
<p>and it can pull the top under, right?</p>
<p>Or is it supporting the top?</p>
<p>And really I believe is honesty, truth,</p>
<p>self-knowledge, humility, gratitude, all this simple stuff.</p>
<p>Good mental health is always consistent with simplicity.</p>
<p>You know, humility, gratitude are easy things to say.</p>
<p>Like we know what that is, right?</p>
<p>We understand what that is.</p>
<p>Soothing envy by having immense power</p>
<p>and subjugating others is getting very, very complicated.</p>
<p>What that is and how that plays out.</p>
<p>So if we are in touch with ourselves,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re honest with ourselves, if we own what&rsquo;s ours,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t try and own what&rsquo;s not ours, right?</p>
<p>What happens then is something isn&rsquo;t waiting inside of us</p>
<p>to sort of jump us with some new fact of self</p>
<p>or challenge of self, right?</p>
<p>Then I think what happens are phenomena</p>
<p>like intrinsic learning,</p>
<p>like the way that so much happens inside of us</p>
<p>automatically, right?</p>
<p>How people who have high levels of expertise</p>
<p>know the answer to complex questions more rapidly, right?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take them longer to think through it,</p>
<p>but they have more knowledge to think through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that more happens rapidly and unconsciously.</p>
<p>So they know the more complex answer</p>
<p>more quickly and readily, right?</p>
<p>And we can build that in ourselves,</p>
<p>not just in terms of factual knowledge,</p>
<p>but in terms of how we respond to things, right?</p>
<p>If I make a mistake, do I respond with reflexive shame, right?</p>
<p>If I see someone has something I&rsquo;d like,</p>
<p>how do I respond?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more in accord with ourselves</p>
<p>and then the automaticity in us is serving us better.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s in the positive.</p>
<p>Do you think, do you draw some wisdom</p>
<p>from the early pioneers of psychotherapy</p>
<p>like Freud and Jung?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s some repressed,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some stuff to work through</p>
<p>that is in the unconscious mind.</p>
<p>Yes, I think there&rsquo;s always like 100% of the time,</p>
<p>if you have a living human,</p>
<p>you have things to work through in the unconscious mind,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much that goes on around us</p>
<p>that we might find unacceptable and suppress, right?</p>
<p>There can be smaller but important examples, right?</p>
<p>Someone who feels that they&rsquo;re not a good enough parent</p>
<p>and they, I don&rsquo;t know, they drop the child&rsquo;s plate, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a feeling about that of badness in them</p>
<p>that the person can&rsquo;t tolerate and pushes away, right?</p>
<p>And maybe they become a little bit less confident,</p>
<p>a little bit less assertive.</p>
<p>Those small examples are important</p>
<p>because they may be low valence</p>
<p>but there can be many, many, many, many, many of them, right?</p>
<p>Then you can look at the opposite end of the spectrum</p>
<p>where someone, for example, feels,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re repressing their sexuality, right, unconsciously.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that is so important,</p>
<p>say, to how a person feels about themselves,</p>
<p>to whether they can seek fulfillment,</p>
<p>to how they feel about their ability to interact</p>
<p>and engage with others in ways that are loving</p>
<p>and generative over time.</p>
<p>So from smaller things that accumulate often at rapid pace</p>
<p>to really big things,</p>
<p>we are pushing things into the unconscious</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not acceptable and we need to explore,</p>
<p>like, well, why is that not acceptable?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s an unacceptable urge</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really not acceptable to me, right?</p>
<p>Like a violent urge.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s an unacceptable urge</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m actually listening to the lies</p>
<p>society is telling me about what&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s not okay, right?</p>
<p>So in exploring those things,</p>
<p>yes, we become happier and healthier</p>
<p>and that could mean if we&rsquo;re already happy and healthy,</p>
<p>it gets better.</p>
<p>We get more insulated against the negative</p>
<p>or it can mean the person who&rsquo;s really nurturing</p>
<p>some of those seeds of evil and envy</p>
<p>does that less or steps away from it.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s good or it&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in there inside of us</p>
<p>and we benefit from understanding</p>
<p>that idea of the observing ego, right?</p>
<p>Like you said, the part that can stop and say,</p>
<p>hey, this is what&rsquo;s, I see what&rsquo;s going on in me.</p>
<p>What have you learned about exploring the human mind</p>
<p>about the art of conversation?</p>
<p>Because ultimately, therapy is conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is there something you can put into words?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like what makes a good conversation?</p>
<p>I think language is among the most amazing gifts we have</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s also one of the most like clunky routes</p>
<p>to misunderstanding, right?</p>
<p>I think of like, there&rsquo;s a concept of facticity,</p>
<p>you know, things that are like, I guess,</p>
<p>unnecessary evils and from the religious perspective,</p>
<p>I think is where the word started,</p>
<p>but of language being like a facticity, right?</p>
<p>That we need to communicate with one another,</p>
<p>we wanna communicate, so we develop words</p>
<p>and we have these amazing brains that can have language</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all well and good,</p>
<p>but our fantasy would be more like Mr. Spock, right?</p>
<p>You know, the Vulcan mind meld was like,</p>
<p>I communicate with you</p>
<p>because we put our hands on one another</p>
<p>and we know, you know, by doing this,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re thinking and what we&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>and we won&rsquo;t have misunderstanding.</p>
<p>So because I think we can approximate that,</p>
<p>we can come kind of close with language, right?</p>
<p>Or we can be so far away from it</p>
<p>that we can say the same word and have opposite meanings</p>
<p>and have it generate immediate animosity, right?</p>
<p>That we need to be very, very careful with language,</p>
<p>with communication, with conversations.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve come to understand that much, much more</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve gotten older, both in terms of how hurtful,</p>
<p>you know, reckless speech is,</p>
<p>which is why I&rsquo;m horrified by so much of what we see</p>
<p>in our political discourse, right?</p>
<p>The slurs, the negativity that&rsquo;s attached to something,</p>
<p>to some word, you know, how one can utter something</p>
<p>and it can go into another person&rsquo;s just into the ear,</p>
<p>but then goes through so many parts</p>
<p>of the meaning of the brain</p>
<p>that that person feels a pervasive sense of shame</p>
<p>or beleagueredness, right?</p>
<p>So yes, reckless language absolutely hurts people</p>
<p>and we see that all the time in ways</p>
<p>that I think are just atrocious.</p>
<p>And also how bad miscommunication harms us.</p>
<p>I mean, I really learned that through a lot</p>
<p>of different ways, but in the work as a therapist</p>
<p>of like really wanting to make sure</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m really understanding you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re really understanding me.</p>
<p>And a lot of work goes into that communication.</p>
<p>I think people, we can get into a rhythm of it</p>
<p>and then it happens more easily.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a life and death difference</p>
<p>at times, you know, lots of times, right,</p>
<p>in the world around us between clear</p>
<p>and accurate communication.</p>
<p>And just so I said a word because like,</p>
<p>I think you know what I mean or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so to that, I mean, there&rsquo;s the Camus quote</p>
<p>that I like, as much unhappiness has come into the world</p>
<p>because of things left unsaid.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>So that has to do with clear communication.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a dance to a conversation,</p>
<p>a poetry to it.</p>
<p>There is ambiguity to language.</p>
<p>And if you have a kind of awareness of that ambiguity</p>
<p>and you play with it, that&rsquo;s where wit and humor come in.</p>
<p>That allows you to sneak up to difficult topics</p>
<p>without sort of trampling on them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s an art to it as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an art to the silence, you know,</p>
<p>just allowing both human beings.</p>
<p>One of the most intimate things you can share</p>
<p>with a human being is silence.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s communication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different communication,</p>
<p>but at times more powerful.</p>
<p>Yeah, giving a person space to accumulate,</p>
<p>to integrate, to make sense of their thoughts,</p>
<p>enough to say a word.</p>
<p>Maybe a memory sparks so they can think about that memory</p>
<p>and process that memory.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just words, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just words, right?</p>
<p>Because now you&rsquo;re talking about communication</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s body language, it&rsquo;s expressions of empathy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s movements, it&rsquo;s pauses, right?</p>
<p>The communication process is very,</p>
<p>very complicated and deep.</p>
<p>Yeah, and some of that is building trust,</p>
<p>but also challenging a person.</p>
<p>I wonder about that whole process</p>
<p>with strangers, for example.</p>
<p>Of how you do that successfully.</p>
<p>Like you and I just met today,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of our interaction is very free.</p>
<p>We can get to know each other in any way we want.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few conversations I have coming up in general</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of other pressures and constraints</p>
<p>on those conversations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a danger to it, there&rsquo;s risks,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s political forces involved.</p>
<p>Not from my perspective, but probably from my,</p>
<p>as well, of how do you say this thing?</p>
<p>What are the words that are going to offend?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re learning that about a stranger at the same time,</p>
<p>you know, and you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting dance because you have to walk</p>
<p>carefully but deliberately, right?</p>
<p>Carefully because, I&rsquo;ve learned this about myself,</p>
<p>about others, there&rsquo;s certain words</p>
<p>that can trigger a person,</p>
<p>that can make a person feel poorly.</p>
<p>Like, shitty about themselves.</p>
<p>So you can push, you can challenge a person about something</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re totally okay with it,</p>
<p>but if you use a certain word to do it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna, maybe it maps to some childhood thing</p>
<p>that their father or mother used to say</p>
<p>or something like this.</p>
<p>And I mean, part of the art of conversation</p>
<p>is actually being a little bit free in using those words,</p>
<p>but being extremely sensitive in detecting</p>
<p>when a person reacts to a particular word</p>
<p>and, like, storing that away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, we might want to return to that later</p>
<p>because there might be an interesting,</p>
<p>that could be a tip of an iceberg</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually representing something beautiful.</p>
<p>Or you might want to just, it&rsquo;s a nothing word</p>
<p>that you just want to avoid because it&rsquo;s a distraction.</p>
<p>And so all of that kind of has to be integrated</p>
<p>into the dance of language.</p>
<p>This is really interesting,</p>
<p>especially when the stakes are really high.</p>
<p>When you get one conversation,</p>
<p>when you sit down, you have one conversation,</p>
<p>and it makes the difference between,</p>
<p>like, say you had one conversation with a patient.</p>
<p>This is the only conversation you get to help.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is the case, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, this is pretty high stakes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>I guess you get over, and like, over time,</p>
<p>I guess you get used to the high stakes nature of it.</p>
<p>When you develop an ability,</p>
<p>and all that unconscious processing, right?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>All that part of the iceberg that&rsquo;s underneath the surface</p>
<p>is doing all of that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reading behavioral cues, verbal cues,</p>
<p>and recognizing the primacy of emotion over logic, right?</p>
<p>If it were all logic, it&rsquo;d be different.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re gonna talk about this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say things, you say things back,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s politically contentious sayings.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re just gonna talk logically.</p>
<p>But you know, that&rsquo;s not the case, right?</p>
<p>There could be a word that raises a certain emotion,</p>
<p>and you know you don&rsquo;t wanna tread there</p>
<p>because the emotion will color</p>
<p>the person&rsquo;s ability to engage.</p>
<p>And so, you&rsquo;re aware of all of this.</p>
<p>And then, I think, from the perspective of all of that,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like standing on the shoulders</p>
<p>of your own internal giant, right?</p>
<p>That understands language, and emotions,</p>
<p>and body language, and attunement,</p>
<p>and history, and triggering, and all of that.</p>
<p>And then, on top of that,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re standing up on those shoulders,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to be effective, right?</p>
<p>And then, I think that&rsquo;s where effectiveness</p>
<p>can be unilateral, or it can be together.</p>
<p>I mean, I think some of what emerged</p>
<p>from Viktor Frankl&rsquo;s writing after the Second World War</p>
<p>was how much shared humanness means to us,</p>
<p>how much of that can be an incentive</p>
<p>for survival beyond all others, right?</p>
<p>So, the idea of are we doing something,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re communicating unilateral,</p>
<p>like I want information from you,</p>
<p>or I want you to do a certain thing</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re done talking, right?</p>
<p>Right, done communicating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very unilateral type of effectiveness,</p>
<p>which can make sense.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I want information out of a patient</p>
<p>because I want to know what to do next, right?</p>
<p>So, it doesn&rsquo;t have to always be negative,</p>
<p>but it can also be a tool of manipulation, right?</p>
<p>If someone is coming from envy or narcissism,</p>
<p>I want to communicate with you in a way</p>
<p>that makes you do what I want you to do, right?</p>
<p>Different from that is where it&rsquo;s a shared communication,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s like an umbrella, so to speak, over us,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing something that can only happen together</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re us, we&rsquo;re each person, right?</p>
<p>And we come together to do something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a shared effectiveness,</p>
<p>like I think we&rsquo;re doing now of elucidating</p>
<p>and pursuing thoughts and getting ideas out.</p>
<p>And I think the best situations</p>
<p>are shared effectiveness situations</p>
<p>because you call upon the resourcefulness</p>
<p>and the internal resources of both people.</p>
<p>But you, especially with strangers,</p>
<p>especially when it&rsquo;s not labeled a therapy session,</p>
<p>you kind of actually stumble into that cooperative state.</p>
<p>Like, you have to organically develop a trust together</p>
<p>and almost lose yourself.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I do, I think you put it really nice.</p>
<p>I think successful conversations,</p>
<p>even when it&rsquo;s with, like, even if it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>with world leaders or logicians,</p>
<p>people that operate in the space of reason,</p>
<p>the most successful conversation will ultimately be</p>
<p>in the layer, in the landscape of emotion.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s where the interesting stuff will happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll discover anything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you get to actually meet,</p>
<p>to start getting an understanding of each other,</p>
<p>or what you actually mean, even by the statements</p>
<p>that are supposed to be kind of rationally based.</p>
<p>You lose yourself.</p>
<p>You lose yourself in the way you do</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re children and you&rsquo;re just shooting the shit</p>
<p>about whatever topic, and you just forget yourself,</p>
<p>forget the things you&rsquo;re supposed to say.</p>
<p>You lose yourself in the context, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, where you kind of plug</p>
<p>into the unconscious mind a little bit,</p>
<p>and you get to speak, maybe indirectly,</p>
<p>but to the things that really drive you,</p>
<p>to the thing that really, to the things,</p>
<p>to the emotions, I suppose, that underlie your worldview.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s where productive conversation</p>
<p>can happen, whether it&rsquo;s a patient</p>
<p>or just a stranger you&rsquo;re talking to at a bar</p>
<p>about geopolitics.</p>
<p>You mentioned Viktor Frankl.</p>
<p>What do you make of his work, Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning?</p>
<p>What are the lessons you draw from his work,</p>
<p>of him as a psychologist, but also from that,</p>
<p>very powerful work that reflects on his experience</p>
<p>in a Nazi concentration camp?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that it was almost a profound,</p>
<p>reinvention of humanness, right?</p>
<p>After something so awful, so bleak, and so despairing,</p>
<p>to speak anew about shared humanness, human connection,</p>
<p>meaning, compassion, that I think it was</p>
<p>an intellectual direction that was adorned</p>
<p>with all of the emotions that we need</p>
<p>to adorn the logic with in order</p>
<p>to make real change in the world.</p>
<p>And I think that his work has fueled so many branches</p>
<p>have come from his work, the existential psychotherapy</p>
<p>and its place in helping human activities today, right?</p>
<p>A trend away from the idea that we&rsquo;re all quite isolated</p>
<p>and that what&rsquo;s going on between us</p>
<p>is all very transactional, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting something out and you take it in,</p>
<p>you put something out, I take it in, right?</p>
<p>The idea that no, there&rsquo;s a difference,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a shared humanness that creates a meaning</p>
<p>beyond the transactional, kind of like you were just saying,</p>
<p>the logical stuff isn&rsquo;t really that interesting</p>
<p>because the logic is, there&rsquo;s an answer</p>
<p>to whatever logic is, we can do math, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where does the surprises come in, right?</p>
<p>Either in terms of wonderful behavior</p>
<p>or destructive behavior, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming from people&rsquo;s emotions,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s what we want to understand,</p>
<p>and that occurs in the context of a person</p>
<p>and other humans, even if it&rsquo;s the conception</p>
<p>of someone and other humans as enemy,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s the conception of two people sitting together,</p>
<p>the idea that there&rsquo;s a shared humanness</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not all transactional</p>
<p>and that he could take that out of</p>
<p>a pinnacle of human tragedy and utilize it</p>
<p>in a way that informs us being better</p>
<p>as a species going forward,</p>
<p>that I think is really monumental.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of emotion</p>
<p>in the human mind, in the human condition?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;ve talked several times in different ways</p>
<p>that emotion matters and it&rsquo;s a big part of who we are,</p>
<p>but why is it there?</p>
<p>Why is it useful?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s good about it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve almost said it&rsquo;s almost like a negative thing</p>
<p>that we just have to live with,</p>
<p>but why is it also maybe a beautiful thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, well I think you said, what&rsquo;s the role of emotion?</p>
<p>Emotion is the king, if we want to use that analogy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the CEO, if we want to use that analogy.</p>
<p>Emotion rules all.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taught that we&rsquo;re logical creatures,</p>
<p>but we have innumerable pieces of data,</p>
<p>even over the course of just a day,</p>
<p>let alone a human experience,</p>
<p>to tell us that is not the truth.</p>
<p>Is it ever logical to run into a burning building?</p>
<p>No, right?</p>
<p>I mean, logic&rsquo;s never gonna tell one to do that.</p>
<p>Okay, someone you love is in the building.</p>
<p>The person&rsquo;s already sprinted halfway to the building.</p>
<p>Emotion rules us, and so the thought, a thought,</p>
<p>is some of that is evolutionary,</p>
<p>that strong negative emotion stays with us</p>
<p>very, very profoundly.</p>
<p>So example I&rsquo;ll give is if we&rsquo;re hunter-gatherers</p>
<p>and I find a new berry and it tastes good</p>
<p>and it seems nutritious, and it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be good to remember that, right?</p>
<p>But if I find a new berry and it tastes good</p>
<p>and it seems nutritious and we both eat it</p>
<p>and almost die of sickness, we better remember that, right?</p>
<p>So the primacy of emotion is in us</p>
<p>for reasons that are about survival,</p>
<p>that the emotion of it&rsquo;s my child in that building</p>
<p>or my loved one is why I don&rsquo;t give a damn about logic</p>
<p>and run into the building, right?</p>
<p>The emotion of I thought that was good</p>
<p>and I got really sick and I better never forget</p>
<p>is also about survival.</p>
<p>And the same applies to humans.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re from different tribes back then,</p>
<p>and in my tribe, when you put your hand out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a greeting.</p>
<p>In your tribe, if someone puts their hand out,</p>
<p>it means, hey, I&rsquo;m gonna attack you and take your stuff.</p>
<p>Then I put my hand out and you slug me, right?</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s like, I better remember that, right?</p>
<p>But you see how that can lead into</p>
<p>are the constructs around that.</p>
<p>I say, oh, people in your tribe are violent, right?</p>
<p>We start then to make stories around that.</p>
<p>But the primacy of emotion, whether it&rsquo;s berries</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s humans who might threaten us</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s humans we love, I think it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to even look at that anthropological,</p>
<p>psychological literature, to look at what&rsquo;s out there</p>
<p>and I think the face validity, that&rsquo;s part of survival,</p>
<p>right, it&rsquo;s part of survival.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool that you get also things like love,</p>
<p>which are not often rational or grounded in logic and so on.</p>
<p>If you look from a transactional perspective,</p>
<p>a lot of times falling in love or whether it&rsquo;s with friends</p>
<p>or friendship or romantic love, it doesn&rsquo;t really make sense.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m still not sure what the hell it is</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like, I mean, it&rsquo;s the thing that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the things, or love for your kids</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re born, like that love, the parental love,</p>
<p>what is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so cool that we get to have the,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re looking for the, in the menu of items</p>
<p>that give life meaning, that seems like a pretty good one.</p>
<p>Yeah, so my response, you said that it gives life meaning.</p>
<p>My response initially was gonna be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the meaning of life, right?</p>
<p>Because saying, okay, emotion is about survival,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one part, right, and it&rsquo;s a very important part,</p>
<p>right, if we don&rsquo;t survive, then we&rsquo;re not there</p>
<p>to have emotions, right?</p>
<p>So yes, it&rsquo;s about survival, but as important as that is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the small part of it, right?</p>
<p>I think it is about the meaning of life</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s about the beyond self,</p>
<p>and I think it relates back to what we talked,</p>
<p>we were talking about at the very beginning</p>
<p>and the sort of levels of emergence, right?</p>
<p>And when we feel love, we feel happiness</p>
<p>because that person feels happiness, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s so generative,</p>
<p>so creative about that, like we wanna bring order to things</p>
<p>and happiness is consistent with simplicity, right?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re healthy, there&rsquo;s nothing negative</p>
<p>to say about our health, right?</p>
<p>If we have health problems, there&rsquo;s a lot to say, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s emotion that pushes us towards the goodness</p>
<p>that I think makes all the meaning for us.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting, actually I was wondering</p>
<p>your thoughts about this as a scientist, right?</p>
<p>Because we accept it by and large that we have free will,</p>
<p>right, we feel that we have free will,</p>
<p>but then we get upset that there&rsquo;s not justice, right?</p>
<p>But how is it like if we have free will,</p>
<p>I could act in an unjust way and then you&rsquo;re surprised</p>
<p>or vice versa, why, right?</p>
<p>We have these thoughts because I think</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re rooted, we want logic to rule,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a way in which I can understand logic,</p>
<p>I can manage it, I can manipulate it,</p>
<p>we sort of want it to be that way,</p>
<p>so then we glorify logic and then we misapply it,</p>
<p>like ideas like, oh, I know we have free will,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m now shaking my fist at the heavens</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no justice, right?</p>
<p>And I think maybe what we&rsquo;re looking for is</p>
<p>we should go back and look at the givens,</p>
<p>like why is there there&rsquo;s only goodness if there&rsquo;s justice?</p>
<p>I mean, that doesn&rsquo;t make, I think the goodness,</p>
<p>why does the goodness have to be tied to that, right?</p>
<p>Maybe it goes back to the counter entropy</p>
<p>and the fact that when there is something,</p>
<p>there is not nothing, right?</p>
<p>And where there is something, there can be awareness,</p>
<p>there can be goodness, there can be compassion, right?</p>
<p>Is it that what&rsquo;s really going on is not about justice?</p>
<p>Yes, we have free will, but it&rsquo;s that goodness,</p>
<p>creating, shoring up, making better,</p>
<p>that is the meaning, that is the good, right?</p>
<p>And that the evil is the destruction</p>
<p>as evidenced by the fact that it&rsquo;s overdetermined</p>
<p>probably a million times that we&rsquo;re in this eddy current</p>
<p>of counter entropy and we could destroy that quite readily,</p>
<p>right, and then we&rsquo;re nothingness like everything else</p>
<p>that we know of that&rsquo;s not us,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to do something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creative or constructive.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that that&rsquo;s the answer</p>
<p>and I think that our science really tells us</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s the answer.</p>
<p>And I think it beckons us with ideas,</p>
<p>like we know that things happen outside of space and time,</p>
<p>right, I mean, they&rsquo;re physics experiments, right?</p>
<p>Like we know this from the science of it,</p>
<p>yet we don&rsquo;t stop and look and say, wait, is that?</p>
<p>The magic of the idea, Einstein said,</p>
<p>God doesn&rsquo;t play dice with the universe.</p>
<p>I think, okay, maybe God doesn&rsquo;t play dice with the universe,</p>
<p>that quantum indeterminacy and all of that</p>
<p>is not just a flip of the coin, so to speak,</p>
<p>but maybe it&rsquo;s in that indeterminacy</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re given the opportunity to assert ourselves,</p>
<p>right, to make something one way or another.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not God playing dice with the universe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s God loading the dice in our favor</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;ll only listen to truth,</p>
<p>the truth that being destructive</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t help pursue anything,</p>
<p>even in the person who thinks it will for themselves,</p>
<p>and that creativity and generativeness</p>
<p>and kindness and compassion,</p>
<p>like this is, doesn&rsquo;t that seem sort of analogous</p>
<p>to the eddy current of counter-entropy</p>
<p>that has us here in the first place?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where I pin meaning,</p>
<p>and that meaning then, going back to the initial question,</p>
<p>right, is generated in us through emotion,</p>
<p>through what we feel that leads us to feel something</p>
<p>that is mysterious, I don&rsquo;t know why I feel it.</p>
<p>Yeah, in some sense, emotion is kind of the fuel</p>
<p>of that creative imperative we have.</p>
<p>But if you step back and look at the tapestry a little bit,</p>
<p>it does seem that the destruction,</p>
<p>the creation and the destruction</p>
<p>are the yin and yang of life,</p>
<p>that it all works only if the main engine</p>
<p>is towards creativity,</p>
<p>but destruction also makes way for new things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the, this kind of struggle,</p>
<p>it seems like life is struggle</p>
<p>between the different forces</p>
<p>that make up the individual human,</p>
<p>that make up society, all these tensions</p>
<p>are necessary for growth, for development,</p>
<p>this kind of inner conflict and outer conflict</p>
<p>are necessary for growth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, I mean, in some sense,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from the logic aspect,</p>
<p>you kind of want everything to be perfect and just,</p>
<p>for nobody to suffer, for everything to be perfect,</p>
<p>but just like we talked about with trauma,</p>
<p>it just seems like it&rsquo;s such a big, giant mess.</p>
<p>What is it, Bukowski said,</p>
<p>find what you love and let it kill you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect of,</p>
<p>the negative aspect of passion and pursuit and obsession</p>
<p>and the turmoil of the pursuit of happiness,</p>
<p>of the creative pursuits and all of that,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of life as well.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that</p>
<p>from an individual perspective</p>
<p>in terms of figuring out how do you live a good life?</p>
<p>How do you live a healthy life?</p>
<p>Because it does seem that a bit of hardship</p>
<p>or sometimes a lot of hardship</p>
<p>can make a pretty interesting life.</p>
<p>I think it brings us back to the discussion</p>
<p>that we were having sort of before</p>
<p>about like what does it mean,</p>
<p>like the challenges of trauma, right, and of overcoming.</p>
<p>And I think here we gotta be careful with the language,</p>
<p>because I would then say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take destruction and separate it into two things.</p>
<p>One is, you say destruction is like the breaking down,</p>
<p>the tearing down of something,</p>
<p>versus a process that has malice in it.</p>
<p>So just like when we were talking about trauma</p>
<p>and setbacks, things to overcome,</p>
<p>we might say, okay, if you say,</p>
<p>hey, you have it harder than the next person</p>
<p>and you have more to overcome,</p>
<p>or someone put a barrier in front of you</p>
<p>for you to overcome,</p>
<p>that there can be a lot of growth in that,</p>
<p>including the times when you don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>gosh, can I do this, right, can I get over it, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying like that&rsquo;s challenge</p>
<p>and something to overcome that&rsquo;s very positive.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re saying, but there&rsquo;s no benefit</p>
<p>of like throwing a racial slur in there, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re saying because that&rsquo;s all bad.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s not, even if the person says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m angry about that and I&rsquo;m gonna overcome that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that didn&rsquo;t need to be,</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t make anything better.</p>
<p>If the person sees that and says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna overcome that,</p>
<p>it makes things less worse, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no good to something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s created as destructive.</p>
<p>We might look at forest fires,</p>
<p>like look, controlled burns.</p>
<p>You say there&rsquo;s a forest burning down,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s, okay, there&rsquo;s some destruction there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tearing down there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in the service of the next fire</p>
<p>not running through the community,</p>
<p>the town that&rsquo;s on the other side of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very different than a forest fire,</p>
<p>say, started by arson, right?</p>
<p>So you might say they&rsquo;re both a tearing down,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re a tearing down of the forest,</p>
<p>but one is in the service of goodness</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s hurting the animals</p>
<p>and the plants, it&rsquo;s not all good, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in the service of something</p>
<p>as opposed to something else that&rsquo;s wantonly destructive.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no good to the racial slur,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no good to the arson, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s destruction in a way that&rsquo;s incorporating,</p>
<p>I think, the malice of envy,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s really purely,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a yin and yang,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the destructive, that&rsquo;s the badness end.</p>
<p>So racial slurs is a surface wave of a deeper thing.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, the reason I bring that up is like,</p>
<p>all right, well, you have these discussions of censorship,</p>
<p>but what good does allowing racial slurs</p>
<p>in public communication do, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, our communication would surely be better</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t say bad things to each other.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, it seems like the truth is</p>
<p>our communication will be better</p>
<p>if the amount of bad things</p>
<p>is a small fraction of communication.</p>
<p>That seems to be more true.</p>
<p>Because another aspect of human nature with power,</p>
<p>the moment you start censoring and removing bad words</p>
<p>that everyone agrees are bad words,</p>
<p>then the people at the top that are doing the censoring</p>
<p>start getting greedy, it starts expanding.</p>
<p>And this is the giant mess of human civilization</p>
<p>where we can&rsquo;t, the nice piles you created</p>
<p>are kind of overlapping.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the gray area, that&rsquo;s the problem with it.</p>
<p>No, I agree completely, the control of language,</p>
<p>there are slippery slopes there,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a very big problem there.</p>
<p>So I agree, I think, again, split parsing out the language,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying, hey, we shouldn&rsquo;t have racial slurs</p>
<p>as if like, let&rsquo;s stop saying the words.</p>
<p>I mean, the idea is the premise behind it, right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, the prejudices,</p>
<p>if we could eliminate the prejudice behind it.</p>
<p>I was struck, as I said, I do almost nothing about medicine.</p>
<p>I get to medical school and start with anatomy, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s remarkable as, you know,</p>
<p>to see as the bodies are being dissected</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all humans, it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>any of these things on the outside.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true, not just in our bodies,</p>
<p>but in our minds, part of the person that&rsquo;s not there,</p>
<p>right, because now we&rsquo;re trying to learn from the body.</p>
<p>And, you know, it shows how ridiculous it is</p>
<p>if you think that we&rsquo;re 99 point how many nines,</p>
<p>you know, percent all alike genetically.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s only like take another 10th off</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all orangutans, right?</p>
<p>But somehow we have to see these differences between us,</p>
<p>right, and where does that come from?</p>
<p>And I think that I believe that all comes from envy</p>
<p>in that classical sense that if I don&rsquo;t feel good enough,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna want someone to feel better about.</p>
<p>And sure, there can be visual things</p>
<p>that that person looks different, right?</p>
<p>Or you think about the, you know,</p>
<p>I spent some time in Great Britain</p>
<p>and where there&rsquo;s a lot of conflict</p>
<p>between Northern Ireland and Ireland, right?</p>
<p>And you thought, wow, there&rsquo;s not even a look difference,</p>
<p>right, it&rsquo;s the same general religious umbrella,</p>
<p>same ethnicity, right, but now there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some religious difference.</p>
<p>And I thought, it&rsquo;s not me trying to be denigrating,</p>
<p>you know, around the Irish conflicts,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s human of, oh, there&rsquo;s no actual difference</p>
<p>between us, if I don&rsquo;t feel good about myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna find one, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that that I believe could go away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s driven by maybe the trauma of just being alive</p>
<p>in the world and things can happen to us,</p>
<p>but we certainly promote in the human-created trauma,</p>
<p>people feeling not good enough, finding differences,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a place for the envy to attach,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re off to the races of, you know, wars.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about the Second World War</p>
<p>and we think, well, what have we learned since then?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take us a day to map out all the wars since then,</p>
<p>right, let alone, for goodness sakes,</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s salient right now.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not pretty, we&rsquo;re not good at learning</p>
<p>from what seem to be some very salient lessons.</p>
<p>I should mention one thing is that I also know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re interested in Russian culture a little bit.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Churchill said, I cannot forecast to you</p>
<p>the action of Russia.</p>
<p>It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery</p>
<p>inside an enigma.</p>
<p>So what to you are some interesting differences</p>
<p>between, so this Eastern part of the world</p>
<p>of Russia, Ukraine, the Slavic countries,</p>
<p>the former Soviet Union, all of that,</p>
<p>versus sort of the U.S. culture?</p>
<p>What stands out to you from the literature,</p>
<p>from the music, from the science, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s so much intensity.</p>
<p>Intensity, and I guess I would say fearlessness</p>
<p>of expression that I see in a Slavic culture,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s across cultures,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a different way that expression occurs.</p>
<p>We say, oh, it&rsquo;s different in the French than the Spanish,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s different than in parts of Africa.</p>
<p>And I think when you take that part of the world</p>
<p>for whatever reason, and maybe it&rsquo;s just totally random,</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s aspects of geography and experience</p>
<p>and migration, but there&rsquo;s such an intensity.</p>
<p>And I remember listening to Tchaikovsky very early on,</p>
<p>maybe not for the very first time,</p>
<p>but early on in my life, or reading Dostoyevsky,</p>
<p>and feeling like, oh, Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s willingness,</p>
<p>his ability, and his willingness to express</p>
<p>and create such powerful, aberrant states</p>
<p>of human experience.</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky in his music, the depths of suffering</p>
<p>that it expresses, has always stood out to me</p>
<p>as a way that if that&rsquo;s the brightest light,</p>
<p>so to speak, communicating information,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a place to look.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also a place that resonated with me so strongly,</p>
<p>because I think for some people who are informative years</p>
<p>and having very difficult feelings, right,</p>
<p>of a depth of feeling, of fear,</p>
<p>and how&rsquo;s the world gonna be?</p>
<p>Am I gonna be annihilated?</p>
<p>What do I even want?</p>
<p>What do I feel inside of me?</p>
<p>To encounter that being expressed so intensely,</p>
<p>I found to be very, very moving.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a good answer or not,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s an intensity of expression</p>
<p>and a fearlessness.</p>
<p>You know, Dostoyevsky wrote about terrible things.</p>
<p>You know, what happens in the person?</p>
<p>Is there a person who is brilliant intellectually</p>
<p>and very persuasive and very capable of being effective</p>
<p>who also just chooses to be a child rapist, right?</p>
<p>I mean, he wrote about that.</p>
<p>He wrote about the truth of this is what we can be</p>
<p>as humans, and I think there&rsquo;s so many lessons,</p>
<p>including the truth.</p>
<p>Like, people will tend to think,</p>
<p>oh, evil&rsquo;s not very bright or not very intelligent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a way to let evil propagate, right?</p>
<p>Evil can be effective and attractive and very compelling,</p>
<p>but evil nonetheless.</p>
<p>And I just think there&rsquo;s a fearless willingness</p>
<p>to look at that and to describe it</p>
<p>that I see primarily I&rsquo;ve studied in Russian culture.</p>
<p>Yeah, the fearless exploration of this whole human drama,</p>
<p>definitely Dostoyevsky and others</p>
<p>since in the 20th century and the 19th century</p>
<p>have done an incredible job of that.</p>
<p>Some of that, just like you said,</p>
<p>is the language, the culture.</p>
<p>I think that intense romanticism is there.</p>
<p>That is almost an overdramatic exploration of human nature.</p>
<p>It can err on the side or falter</p>
<p>when it goes into a kind of cynical view of life.</p>
<p>You know, life is suffering.</p>
<p>I think that also has to do with the way you deal</p>
<p>with the trauma of the World Wars and so on.</p>
<p>This is something the different nations throughout Europe</p>
<p>had to deal with that in different ways.</p>
<p>Some of them have channeled into envy and resentment.</p>
<p>Some of them channeled into a kind of nihilism</p>
<p>or a cynicism, and ultimately,</p>
<p>the intensity of feeling is there,</p>
<p>which is sort of interesting to see</p>
<p>and interesting how that manifests itself</p>
<p>in the kind of governments it builds up.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s more authoritarianism</p>
<p>in that part of the world versus the Western world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more focused on the individual versus the collective,</p>
<p>and when more focused on the individual,</p>
<p>you have a propensity to value individual rights</p>
<p>with democracy and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to watch and, yeah,</p>
<p>to reconstruct how that all came to be.</p>
<p>Is it in the blood?</p>
<p>Is it in the mind?</p>
<p>Is it in some kind of thing that&rsquo;s more ethereal,</p>
<p>a collective set of ideas that we pass</p>
<p>from generation to generation between each other,</p>
<p>sort of the collective of it?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see, but now reinvigorated</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s conflict in that part of the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also thought about the Cold War.</p>
<p>What lessons about the human mind,</p>
<p>about psychiatry, psychology,</p>
<p>and about looking at the Cold War</p>
<p>can we take forward in the 21st century</p>
<p>so that we can avoid World War III,</p>
<p>a major cold or hot war in the 21st century?</p>
<p>Well, I think unspoken animosities</p>
<p>are very, very, very dangerous.</p>
<p>I mean, right, it was a Cold War.</p>
<p>There was fighting through proxies, right?</p>
<p>The superpowers were fighting surrogate wars through proxies,</p>
<p>which, of course, in and of itself causes immense suffering,</p>
<p>but it becomes the opposite of an exchange of ideas</p>
<p>or an exchange of thought.</p>
<p>You know, I remember even Khrushchev, right,</p>
<p>not believing that the kitchen could look like it did</p>
<p>at the World&rsquo;s Fair, right?</p>
<p>And some of the misconceptions here</p>
<p>of like what things were like in Russia, right?</p>
<p>It was an utter, it was a thought</p>
<p>that those other people are not actually people, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an enemy society of evil,</p>
<p>which then paints with a broad brush</p>
<p>in a way that makes it easy, too easy for the Cold War,</p>
<p>for the war to go from being cold, right,</p>
<p>to having boiling over into utter destruction.</p>
<p>And, you know, I wrote, it was really a true story</p>
<p>that when I was in, it was still the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>but it was right around the time</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union coming to an end,</p>
<p>and I had gone on a trip for students from England,</p>
<p>and we got to go places that people hadn&rsquo;t gone.</p>
<p>You know, foreigners hadn&rsquo;t gone in many, many years.</p>
<p>It was just kind of the right timing to experience that,</p>
<p>and it really is true that someone said on short notice</p>
<p>to these poor kids that these group of Americans</p>
<p>were coming, and I have a picture somewhere</p>
<p>of the kid in a gas mask, like as they went under their desks</p>
<p>and put on a gas mask, and they felt right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what, I mean, that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taught to think about us,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re taught to think about them,</p>
<p>and like now we&rsquo;re back in an us-them, right?</p>
<p>When, you know, we&rsquo;re all trying to survive,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all such, human life is so delicate, right?</p>
<p>You know, let alone human happiness,</p>
<p>and we make these divisions, and we create this aggression,</p>
<p>and latent aggression.</p>
<p>I mean, during the Cold War, we developed, right,</p>
<p>the ability to destroy the Earth, right?</p>
<p>And then just sat looking at one another, you know,</p>
<p>with further growing misunderstanding,</p>
<p>and the opportunity for the proxy fights,</p>
<p>like when they said the Cuban Missile Crisis,</p>
<p>which I know wasn&rsquo;t a war, but it&rsquo;s an aspect of that,</p>
<p>where we just have ourselves wildly, you know,</p>
<p>at risk of destruction without any mutual understanding.</p>
<p>And again, I would argue that that is the opposite</p>
<p>of the counter-entropy, right?</p>
<p>Like we are setting everything up for less,</p>
<p>lack of communication, lack of understanding.</p>
<p>How do those feelings of love and shared humanness happen?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>If you separate people, and then we push ourselves</p>
<p>more and more and more towards reinstating</p>
<p>the state of entropy that&rsquo;s present</p>
<p>in the rest of the universe.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people</p>
<p>that are fighting entropy with all their might?</p>
<p>So young people, and people that are wondering</p>
<p>how to find their way in life,</p>
<p>what advice would you give, how to have a career,</p>
<p>how to have a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>I think starting off with sort of first principles.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, what are my values, right?</p>
<p>How do I want to live life?</p>
<p>Because, you know, I&rsquo;m in my early 50s,</p>
<p>and when I was a kid, you know, we waited for the,</p>
<p>the newspaper came in the afternoon,</p>
<p>and then, you know, and then we&rsquo;d see something.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s going on in the world?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d learn something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d get the West Coast baseball scores, right?</p>
<p>And learn about, oh, here&rsquo;s what happened</p>
<p>in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>And by and large, I and everyone else there,</p>
<p>adult or child, were like living in a reality</p>
<p>that was largely, our conception was largely</p>
<p>what was around us, right?</p>
<p>And now, in many ways, it is,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s entirely negative, of course,</p>
<p>that we have more information.</p>
<p>We can sort of think globally, so to speak, right?</p>
<p>But the other side of that is so much</p>
<p>of the world&rsquo;s problems are on us all the time, right?</p>
<p>Like here&rsquo;s this awful thing that happened.</p>
<p>How many awful things happen each day,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re right in front of us,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s such an immediacy to it all</p>
<p>that I think it can be, it can like paralyze us</p>
<p>with terror, right?</p>
<p>And for someone who&rsquo;s young and trying to make their way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, how do you figure your way out in this world</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re worried isn&rsquo;t even gonna exist, right?</p>
<p>And then you see how profligate</p>
<p>the generations before you are, right?</p>
<p>In so many ways, and there can become, I think,</p>
<p>a push towards extremes, either nihilism,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna change everything, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, how about, let&rsquo;s start from</p>
<p>how do I wanna behave in my own community, right?</p>
<p>Which starts with how do I wanna behave in my household,</p>
<p>what kind of neighbor do I wanna be?</p>
<p>I mean, it might seem like things like that</p>
<p>are silly or small in comparison to the big things,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think they are.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how we start building foundations</p>
<p>that lets us tackle the big things.</p>
<p>And then I do find myself saying,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m working with, sometimes doing therapy</p>
<p>with younger people, of helping them</p>
<p>kind of bring back their thoughts, their strivings,</p>
<p>their decisions more to themselves,</p>
<p>and living with and around themselves more</p>
<p>instead of in something that becomes very theoretical</p>
<p>and therefore very threatening and unnerving.</p>
<p>So focusing on the people around them,</p>
<p>taking one small step at a time</p>
<p>to form deeper connections to build something locally.</p>
<p>Yeah, how do I wanna be today?</p>
<p>If I go into the grocery store</p>
<p>and the person in front of me drops something,</p>
<p>I can scowl, because I&rsquo;m in a rush, right?</p>
<p>And I can be like that, right?</p>
<p>I can be like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been that way many, many times in my life, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s never done anyone a damn bit of good,</p>
<p>including me, right?</p>
<p>Or I can realize, like,</p>
<p>the 10 seconds aren&rsquo;t gonna matter.</p>
<p>Can I help pick that thing up?</p>
<p>Or just smile.</p>
<p>These are the seemingly small things</p>
<p>that I think make the tenor of our lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, I moved, I think I mentioned to you offline,</p>
<p>one of the, really the main reason I moved to Austin, Texas,</p>
<p>I just remember deciding it when I went to Walmart</p>
<p>and a lady said,</p>
<p>you look handsome in that tie,</p>
<p>or in that suit and tie, whatever.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s ever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an older lady, she was very sweet,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s kindness in her eyes,</p>
<p>she said that, I don&rsquo;t think anyone ever said</p>
<p>anything like that to me in my entire life.</p>
<p>And it was just, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it was like, wow, there&rsquo;s kindness in this world.</p>
<p>I know it sounds ridiculous, but like-</p>
<p>Does not sound ridiculous to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like those, you could be that for somebody.</p>
<p>Go walk around in Walmarts.</p>
<p>Right, the thing about, you remember that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pivotal, you&rsquo;re citing it as,</p>
<p>hey, that was a big part of me moving here.</p>
<p>So the thing about the branch point in your life</p>
<p>that comes from the simple kindness, right,</p>
<p>of a person who had goodness to give, right?</p>
<p>And wasn&rsquo;t scared that you&rsquo;re gonna be upset by it,</p>
<p>or whatever, right?</p>
<p>Took the risk.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>She probably didn&rsquo;t have the thought</p>
<p>that you could be assailing, right?</p>
<p>Probably she looks at you, she&rsquo;s got goodness to give,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simple to give it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple, and it&rsquo;s beautiful,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s worth more to you than like,</p>
<p>how many studies would be on where&rsquo;s the right to live,</p>
<p>or this and that.</p>
<p>None of that matters.</p>
<p>What mattered was-</p>
<p>It was just that.</p>
<p>The freedom to be kind.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s emotion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not logic at all.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s purely just human emotion,</p>
<p>and a little bit of humanness,</p>
<p>that little bit of connection.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s what makes life great.</p>
<p>Which is why it&rsquo;s not a bad idea, right?</p>
<p>That you moved here that way, instead of,</p>
<p>one could say, well, I can&rsquo;t believe you did that,</p>
<p>instead of looking at all the data,</p>
<p>and hiring consultants of what&rsquo;s the best place to live.</p>
<p>But that would be wrong, right?</p>
<p>Like, you made a good decision, right?</p>
<p>Like, that was good data.</p>
<p>It was impactful data,</p>
<p>even in your thoughts about how you&rsquo;re happy living here.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s not that, oh, you discount,</p>
<p>you shortchange yourself by not relying</p>
<p>on all the logic, right?</p>
<p>You felt something about the place,</p>
<p>and you felt it as symbolized in a person,</p>
<p>and that made the choice for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a balance, of course,</p>
<p>but you also have to know yourself a little bit.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can find stability and comfort</p>
<p>in kind of reasoning things out a little bit.</p>
<p>Maybe, as people close to me have sometimes criticized,</p>
<p>in that I&rsquo;m a little bit too romantic,</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ll just follow the feeling.</p>
<p>And, you know, life, you know, there&rsquo;s physics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reality to this world.</p>
<p>Sometimes reality doesn&rsquo;t allow you to flourish,</p>
<p>if you just follow your feelings,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a dance there.</p>
<p>And happiness is ultimately found in that landscape</p>
<p>of feeling and emotion versus facts and reason and logic.</p>
<p>As you said, have their place, right?</p>
<p>Everything, yeah.</p>
<p>They have their place,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not the be-all and end-all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>Andrew Huberman is a friend of yours.</p>
<p>He said, you absolutely must talk.</p>
<p>Karl Deisseroth, the number of people you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just incredible people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just this group of folks</p>
<p>that somehow helped each other flourish and grew together,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m so happy you exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy you&rsquo;re doing the work you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for your second book.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>This was really cool.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to be among the group of people that you cited,</p>
<p>proud to be their friend,</p>
<p>and proud that you&rsquo;ve had me on today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you, Paul.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Paul Conte.</p>

<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Viktor Frankl.</p>
<p>Everything can be taken from a man,</p>
<p>but the last of the human freedoms,</p>
<p>to choose one&rsquo;s attitude in any given set of circumstances.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
