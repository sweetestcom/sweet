    <ul>
<li>Well, good evening, everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ann Harrison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the Dean of Berkeley Haas. - Hi, Ann</p>
<ul>
<li>And I&rsquo;d like to welcome you</li>
</ul>
<p>to tonight&rsquo;s Dean&rsquo;s Speaker Series.</p>
<p>So I have the privilege of introducing you,</p>
<p>our speaker, very well known.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never had this venue as packed as it is tonight.</p>
<p>Jensen Huang.</p>
<p>So Jensen founded Nvidia in 1993.</p>
<p>He served since its inception as president,</p>
<p>chief executive officer,</p>
<p>and a member of the board of directors.</p>
<p>Nvidia is said to be</p>
<p>the world&rsquo;s last computer graphics company</p>
<p>to have been founded,</p>
<p>but with Jensen&rsquo;s diligence and perseverance,</p>
<p>Nvidia survived and outstripped the competition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to skip most of the accolades,</p>
<p>but I will point out that Jensen-</p>
<ul>
<li>[Jensen] No, that&rsquo;s the best part.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay. - No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Okay, I won&rsquo;t skip them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jensen has received- - I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Oh, no, this is gonna be excruciating.</p>
<ul>
<li>No, no.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do the short version. - Don&rsquo;t skip me.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jensen has received numerous awards,</li>
</ul>
<p>including the Semiconductor Industry</p>
<p>Association&rsquo;s highest honor,</p>
<p>the Robert N. Noyce Award IEEE Founders Medal,</p>
<p>and the Dr. Morris Chang Exemplary Leadership Award.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been named the World&rsquo;s best CEO</p>
<p>by Harvard Business Review and Brand Finance,</p>
<p>as well as Fortune&rsquo;s Business Person of the Year,</p>
<p>and one of Time Magazine&rsquo;s 100 Most Influential People.</p>
<p>So, Jensen, thank you so much for braving that terrible ride</p>
<p>from San Francisco.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to speak to us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sold out.</p>
<p>The students are all very excited to hear you.</p>
<p>First, Jensen, I think you&rsquo;ll say a few words</p>
<p>to our audience,</p>
<p>and then our MBA students, Ryan Tan and Renee Yao,</p>
<p>will moderate today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wow. (audience applauding)</li>
</ul>
<p>What to say?</p>
<p>Well, I thought everything that was most important to say</p>
<p>she did so nicely say.</p>
<p>First of all, thanks for the introduction</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s great to be here.</p>
<p>I am now, I think, the longest running</p>
<p>tech CEO working today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in tech for 30 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly, incredibly fun job, I can tell you that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I do it.</p>
<p>it is a incredibly&hellip;</p>
<p>Incredibly good job and it&rsquo;s a privilege to do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re surrounded by amazing people.</p>
<p>In our case, we had the benefit of pioneering</p>
<p>a new way of doing computing.</p>
<p>This new way of doing computing has solved and is solving</p>
<p>some of the world&rsquo;s greatest challenges.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really pleased to be working in digital biology,</p>
<p>to climate sciences, to artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>to robotics, to video games.</p>
<p>Just&hellip;</p>
<p>If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind,</p>
<p>how many of you have played video games</p>
<p>on Nvidia GeForce?</p>
<p>And so, I wanna thank you for that.</p>
<p>And how many of you are AI researchers or developers</p>
<p>that have used our GPUs for developing AI models?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really terrific.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s great to see that.</p>
<p>It is a rare privilege to be part of a company</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t just a good business,</p>
<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s good business for sure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good business</p>
<p>that also makes a great impact on the world.</p>
<p>And the work that you do</p>
<p>is really important to other people.</p>
<p>And so the combination of running a good business</p>
<p>and the skills of doing that,</p>
<p>I had to learn along the way.</p>
<p>A purpose of a company that could make such great impact</p>
<p>on the industry and markets around the world and society</p>
<p>is a great privilege.</p>
<p>And then also to have done something</p>
<p>that the world&rsquo;s never done before</p>
<p>and do it for the first time.</p>
<p>Singularly, the company that invented</p>
<p>this field of computing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just incredible, incredible fun.</p>
<p>And so hopefully tonight we&rsquo;ll get to share</p>
<p>some of the learnings that I&rsquo;ve gained along the way.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have the benefit, you did,</p>
<p>which is learning a business in a formal way.</p>
<p>I learned business in the way of doing it.</p>
<p>And all along the way, I discovered and realized</p>
<p>that there was a lot to learn.</p>
<p>Some of the things that that I&rsquo;ve learned along the way,</p>
<p>I try to pass along to all the leaders of our company.</p>
<p>But the business part of our company,</p>
<p>the strategy part of our company,</p>
<p>is some of the hardest things that we do.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is it&rsquo;s so ambiguous.</p>
<p>And it is not just about what you do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about what everybody else does in return.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what the competition does,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about what the industry does,</p>
<p>what the customers do.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s an incredibly hard problem to simulate</p>
<p>and incredibly hard thing to learn how to do.</p>
<p>But I had the benefit of learning it</p>
<p>over the course of 30 years,</p>
<p>and so hopefully tonight we&rsquo;ll get to talk</p>
<p>about some of those things, okay?</p>
<p>All right, glad to be here.</p>
<p>(audience applauding)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you so much, Jensen.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;re all really excited for you to be here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ryan, I&rsquo;m a second year MBA student,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m honored to co-moderate this discussion with you,</p>
<p>with Renee.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>So our first question is on starting Nvidia.</p>
<p>So in the crowd,</p>
<p>we have many aspiring tech entrepreneurs</p>
<p>that are close in age when you first founded Nvidia.</p>
<p>Can you tell us a bit on how you came to start Nvidia?</p>
<p>What was the spark</p>
<p>that led you to start this amazing journey?</p>
<p>Do you have some advice</p>
<p>for some of the entrepreneurs in the crowd</p>
<p>who plan on starting their own journeys one day?</p>
<ul>
<li>Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t start a graphics company.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>The Nvidia being the last&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that Nvidia was the last</p>
<p>computer graphics company founded,</p>
<p>and that says something about strategy.</p>
<p>We were one of a hundred computer graphics companies,</p>
<p>and also the last one founded.</p>
<p>How is it possible that we&rsquo;re the largest in the world today</p>
<p>and the only one remaining?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a strategy study in there somewhere,</p>
<p>and that suggests that being first</p>
<p>is not necessarily the best.</p>
<p>You could argue that being the first 99 isn&rsquo;t the best.</p>
<p>And sometimes being last is not necessarily even the worst.</p>
<p>But I do hope that we are the last,</p>
<p>if you get what I mean.</p>
<p>The battle between two computer architectural approaches</p>
<p>over the course of time using processors on the one hand,</p>
<p>which is general purpose,</p>
<p>writing software that does anything that runs on a computer,</p>
<p>versus an acceleration method,</p>
<p>has gone on for a very long time.</p>
<p>And about 30 years ago, Chris and Curtis,</p>
<p>the two other founders of Nvidia,</p>
<p>wanted to do something different</p>
<p>and they wanted me to join them.</p>
<p>I was really happy with my job</p>
<p>and we had two great kids and great dog</p>
<p>and we had a great family,</p>
<p>and so I was perfectly happy doing what we were doing.</p>
<p>But they insisted I join them to do something.</p>
<p>And so the three of us met on a regular basis at Denny&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and then we conceived of what Nvidia is today,</p>
<p>an accelerated computing company.</p>
<p>And that was really as simple</p>
<p>as the beginning as anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that startups need to form</p>
<p>out of extraordinary angst or incredible opportunity.</p>
<p>We were three good friends, and we been good friends today,</p>
<p>and there was an opportunity to work together</p>
<p>and we had to go figure out what to do.</p>
<p>And so I think that entrepreneurial approach</p>
<p>to solving problems, looking for opportunities,</p>
<p>persisted to this day.</p>
<p>It could be a random Tuesday</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re trying to think of something new to go do</p>
<p>or something we can do with something that we know,</p>
<p>or an opportunity where to arise</p>
<p>that we can go take advantage of,</p>
<p>and the company is reinventing itself all the time.</p>
<p>So this basic method of seeing problems</p>
<p>or seeing opportunities, or just happens to be Tuesday,</p>
<p>creating something out of nothing</p>
<p>is a skill that I think everybody, every company,</p>
<p>or every startup needs to have.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve applied and we apply</p>
<p>that basic method all the time.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to reinvent ourselves during a tough day,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to reinvent ourselves</p>
<p>because an opportunity arise,</p>
<p>we invent ourselves because we do.</p>
<p>And so just the energy of looking for something new</p>
<p>and a new way of doing something is always, always there.</p>
<p>What was&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a compounded question of a lot of complexity.</p>
<p>(Ryan laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advice for entrepreneurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The what? - Advice for entrepreneurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advice?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only done it&hellip;</p>
<p>You guys, I&rsquo;ve only done it once.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna set the expectation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna get any wisely, sagely advice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only done this once and I&rsquo;m still learning on the job,</p>
<p>and I kind of feel like that&rsquo;s the wisdom.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I was no different than you guys except less prepared.</p>
<p>And everything I did, I did on the job.</p>
<p>I still remember it was about about February or March &lsquo;93,</p>
<p>and it occurred to us we need the money,</p>
<p>and the place to go get it is venture capitalist,</p>
<p>and the way you do that, apparently,</p>
<p>is to write a business plan.</p>
<p>And so I bought a book.</p>
<p>I mean, the obvious thing to do is you buy a book.</p>
<p>And so I bought a book and it says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How to Write a Business Plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, back then, how to write a business plan</p>
<p>is not a TikTok video.</p>
<p>I wish it was. (audience laughing)</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t even a YouTube video,</p>
<p>but it was like 490 pages written by Gordon Bell.</p>
<p>And Gordon Bell is this fantastic guy.</p>
<p>He was the founder of DEC.</p>
<p>He was the chief architect, chief technical officer,</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s a fellow now in Microsoft,</p>
<p>and just an incredible, incredible guy.</p>
<p>And so anyways&hellip;</p>
<p>And he started Ardent Computer,</p>
<p>and then I met some amazing people at Ardent Computer,</p>
<p>Jon Rubinstein for one.</p>
<p>And so anyways,</p>
<p>he wrote a book on how to build a company,</p>
<p>how to start a company,</p>
<p>and it was like 490 pages or something like that.</p>
<p>And if I would&rsquo;ve read the whole book,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way Nvidia would be in business today.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>And so I glanced through it,</p>
<p>kind of skimmed through it,</p>
<p>and tried to write my business plan.</p>
<p>The truth be told, Nvidia never finished the business plan</p>
<p>because I never could finish it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not really even too sure how to finish one today.</p>
<p>And so I do remember this,</p>
<p>our VC, Sequoia Capital and Sutter,</p>
<p>incredible venture capitalist,</p>
<p>they asked for a business plan,</p>
<p>and so we put a business plan together.</p>
<p>And I could tell you that our forecast was off by so much.</p>
<p>I think, I could imagine guessing..</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s no way to guess even worse than that.</p>
<p>And so we were off by so much.</p>
<p>Nobody would&rsquo;ve expected the market to be this large.</p>
<p>Nobody would&rsquo;ve expected our company</p>
<p>to have taken so long to have gotten off the ground</p>
<p>and for the CEO to takes so long to figure it out.</p>
<p>And so all of that stuff was really, really hard to predict.</p>
<p>And so your question is probably, why are we here?</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>So, I hope I can figure that out tonight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia is a great company.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for those who I haven&rsquo;t met yet, my name is Renee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working at Nvidia-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jensen] Oh, I was gonna give him an advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, yes. - Just get to it, yeah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Ryan laughing) - Just get to it.</p>
<p>Yes, great advice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working at Nvidia for coming up seven years,</p>
<p>and I lead 2,000 healthcare AI startups</p>
<p>that are in our inception program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Renee is amazing. - Thank you, Jensen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nvidia is a fantastic place to work.</p>
<p>So for those who may not know a lot about Nvidia,</p>
<p>Nvidia is actually not built</p>
<p>like many of the large organizations in the industry</p>
<p>with no regular P&amp;L,</p>
<p>no business units like many others</p>
<p>you can see in Google or Microsoft and others,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an extremely flat organization.</p>
<p>Between me and Jensen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only three other executives in between.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very, very flat.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no org chart.</p>
<p>We are volunteers that reports to mission.</p>
<p>And many people think we&rsquo;re a graphics company</p>
<p>or a gaming company,</p>
<p>but Nvidia is actually a full stack companies</p>
<p>for all industries you can think of.</p>
<p>Retail, finance, oil and gas, manufacturing.</p>
<p>And more interestingly,</p>
<p>we are a fabulous semiconductor company,</p>
<p>a cloudless cloud company,</p>
<p>a manufacturing company</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have our own manufacturing.</p>
<p>Jensen.</p>
<ul>
<li>That sounds like a company I wanna join.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t- - Right?</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How did you-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just think the expectation tonight is way too high.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>And that could very well be the wisdom you take away.</p>
<p>You know, there is&hellip;</p>
<p>There is a belief that CEOs are extraordinary amazing,</p>
<p>really knowledgeable, really skilled people,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>It is not true.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not incompetent, uninformed,</p>
<p>really super lazy people either.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you to think that either.</p>
<p>However, I hope the one thing</p>
<p>that I convey to you guys today is that, in fact,</p>
<p>you probably have everything you need</p>
<p>to be a great CEO already.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s anything that I inspire you to do tonight</p>
<p>is just to go do it,</p>
<p>but just don&rsquo;t start a graphics company.</p>
<p>But what was your question?</p>
<p>How did I do it?</p>
<ul>
<li>It was more like how did you decide</li>
</ul>
<p>on such a model for Nvidia?</p>
<ul>
<li>That question is so loaded and it&rsquo;s hard to answer,</li>
</ul>
<p>but let me tear it apart.</p>
<p>Okay, let me tear it apart.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a part about what does the company do,</p>
<p>what does the company do,</p>
<p>and for what reason it does it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really, really hard thing to figure out.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to figure it on one day</p>
<p>or you have the feelings for it,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t know how to put into words.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is because, probably 30 years ago,</p>
<p>the concept of cloud computing didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Maybe 30 years ago, nobody would&rsquo;ve believed</p>
<p>artificial intelligence was possible</p>
<p>or accelerated computing was a thing.</p>
<p>And so until these words come into existence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay that you don&rsquo;t have the words to describe it,</p>
<p>but you need to know what does the company do</p>
<p>and for what reason it does it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the second part, which is,</p>
<p>in what environment does this company exist?</p>
<p>What kind of environment is it?</p>
<p>Is it a nurturing, stable environment?</p>
<p>Is it a hostile, volatile, dynamic environment?</p>
<p>Because by understanding what environment</p>
<p>your company&rsquo;s going to be in,</p>
<p>i.e., the industry and the technology that governs it,</p>
<p>the fundamental dynamics of the industry,</p>
<p>by understanding some of these things,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the reason why</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in the technology industry,</p>
<p>having technical sensibility is really important.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be ignorant of the fundamental dynamics</p>
<p>of the vehicle you&rsquo;re trying to build,</p>
<p>the fleet you&rsquo;re trying to build,</p>
<p>the ship you&rsquo;re trying to build.</p>
<p>And so understanding the fundamental dynamics</p>
<p>of the industry is really important.</p>
<p>Now, based on those dynamics,</p>
<p>it causes you to think about</p>
<p>how to architect this machine, this machinery.</p>
<p>This machinery is essentially what Nvidia is.</p>
<p>Nvidia is a machine that builds a bunch of other machines</p>
<p>that other people would call products.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a machine.</p>
<p>And this machine has to be architected in a thoughtful way.</p>
<p>That is the fundamental job of the CEO.</p>
<p>And then the next part of it</p>
<p>is how do you operate this machine.</p>
<p>What are the rules that governs</p>
<p>the operations of this machine?</p>
<p>Because there will be many conflicting requirements</p>
<p>of this machine,</p>
<p>and this machine will be dealing with all of those conflicts</p>
<p>in a really distributed way</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t possibly</p>
<p>be governing everything overnight, all by yourself,</p>
<p>and so you have to empower amazing people like Renee</p>
<p>to be able to do some of these things.</p>
<p>And so what are the values that you encode</p>
<p>in all of the people that you empowered?</p>
<p>What are the principles by which they operate?</p>
<p>What are the operating manual, if you will, of this machine?</p>
<p>And some people call that culture,</p>
<p>some people say those are procedures and processes</p>
<p>and best-known methods.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to describe some of these things.</p>
<p>But basically is, what is this thing that we&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>what is it doing for what reason,</p>
<p>what is the architecture of the machine and why,</p>
<p>and then how do you operate it?</p>
<p>In a very large sense,</p>
<p>all CEOs have to work those things out.</p>
<p>Now, the thing that I optimized for</p>
<p>is our industry at some point,</p>
<p>for the vast majority of my computer industry experience,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been largely governed by Moore&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>but we knew that Moore&rsquo;s law was gonna run out of steam.</p>
<p>And at some point, the type of problems you wanna solve,</p>
<p>and in our case, the type of problems we wanna solve</p>
<p>are the ones that either Moore&rsquo;s law can&rsquo;t solve,</p>
<p>or in the time of Moore&rsquo;s law, it&rsquo;s barely possible.</p>
<p>And so we came up with this way of doing something</p>
<p>called accelerated computing.</p>
<p>Well, our world requires deep invention</p>
<p>and a lot of discovery that hasn&rsquo;t been done before</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re the only company that&rsquo;s done it.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t know exactly what the recipe is,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know exactly what the framework&rsquo;s gonna be,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know exactly how to go do that,</p>
<p>and we architected a company that optimizes</p>
<p>for a lot of innovation to happen,</p>
<p>optimizes for a lot of agility to happen.</p>
<p>So for example, if we discovered,</p>
<p>hey, this is a great new path,</p>
<p>this is gonna work,</p>
<p>we could swarm the company towards it,</p>
<p>we could shift it, pivot the company to it.</p>
<p>And to be able to do that,</p>
<p>you need a company that allows you to do it.</p>
<p>And these are some of the things that you&rsquo;ll learn</p>
<p>as you operate large companies,</p>
<p>is that the CEO needs to create a system</p>
<p>that allows the CEO,</p>
<p>your will or the collective will of the organization,</p>
<p>to change the course of the company.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>How do you change the course of a company?</p>
<p>At Nvidia, I can change the course of the company,</p>
<p>of course, with the support</p>
<p>of all the leaders that work there</p>
<p>and all the amazing people that help me realize</p>
<p>that we need to change the course of the company,</p>
<p>but I can change the course of the company within an email</p>
<p>over a weekend.</p>
<p>No large organizations have to change.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to change your reporting structure,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to change your boss,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to change your office.</p>
<p>In these days, you don&rsquo;t have to change where you live</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re working at home.</p>
<p>And so we created an architecture for the company</p>
<p>that allows for maximum agility</p>
<p>in the event we discover something great.</p>
<p>We also invented a company</p>
<p>that allows us to create a new type of computing.</p>
<p>And if you wanna create a new type of computing&hellip;</p>
<p>Nothing exists,</p>
<p>and you have to create everything from scratch.</p>
<p>So everything from the architecture of the chips,</p>
<p>to the way the chips are designed,</p>
<p>to the way the systems are built</p>
<p>and the system software that runs on it,</p>
<p>and the algorithms that runs on it,</p>
<p>and even more than that,</p>
<p>the applications or the industries that use it,</p>
<p>all had to be invented from scratch.</p>
<p>And so here we are sitting in the middle of nowhere,</p>
<p>we were in Fremont, we had three people,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re imagining this new world,</p>
<p>and everything from computer graphics,</p>
<p>to scientific computing would be solved.</p>
<p>And how would you go about creating a company</p>
<p>that has such an influence across the entire stack</p>
<p>and such influence across the entire industry?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the part that we had to go invent.</p>
<p>And as a result, if you look at Nvidia&rsquo;s architecture,</p>
<p>the organization,</p>
<p>and I show Nvidia&rsquo;s org chart all the time,</p>
<p>it just doesn&rsquo;t look like an org chart,</p>
<p>it looks like a computer stack,</p>
<p>and the company is actually architected</p>
<p>like a computer stack.</p>
<p>And so why would you do such a thing?</p>
<p>Why would you build a machine, a company,</p>
<p>a machinery, a company,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s organization looks like a computer?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s more sensible to me</p>
<p>than to create a company whose architecture</p>
<p>looks like the military.</p>
<p>If you think about it for a second,</p>
<p>business units, divisions, maximizing autonomy.</p>
<p>But more importantly, what managers really wanna do</p>
<p>is maximizing accountability</p>
<p>as if you really can control the outcome of your business,</p>
<p>they hold you accountable.</p>
<p>I think those are really quite antiquated ideas.</p>
<p>They might work in some large companies.</p>
<p>Other&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re not a small company either.</p>
<p>They might work in other companies.</p>
<p>But I never felt that making somebody promise</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna do something</p>
<p>will optimize the ability for them to do it.</p>
<p>And because you know that I don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>anybody should fail alone,</p>
<p>just because somebody says,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;ll do a billion, whatever,</p>
<p>a billion whatever, and I promise to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sign up for my compensation.</p>
<p>If I do better than that, I&rsquo;m paid more than that,</p>
<p>I do less than that, I&rsquo;ll get paid less than that,</p>
<p>and they sign up for that,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t give me any comfort at all.</p>
<p>And because there&rsquo;s so many other people that depends on it,</p>
<p>that should give nobody comfort.</p>
<p>And so I decided to build a company</p>
<p>that maximizes for collaboration,</p>
<p>reuse of the things that we build, leverage.</p>
<p>And as a result, we minimized&hellip;</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t minimize, I guess,</p>
<p>we probably diminished the ability for somebody that say</p>
<p>hold somebody accountable through business units</p>
<p>and financial results and divisions and autonomy</p>
<p>and all of those things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just a fundamentally different way</p>
<p>of thinking about the architecture.</p>
<p>And the way that I would advise,</p>
<p>and maybe close with an advice</p>
<p>is that we always think about the problem</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to solve from first principles.</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s the company we&rsquo;re trying to build,</p>
<p>the product we&rsquo;re trying to build,</p>
<p>or the organization we wanna try to build,</p>
<p>you have to go back to,</p>
<p>what is it that we are optimizing for,</p>
<p>and what do you want this machine to do,</p>
<p>and what do you want the behavior of this machinery to be,</p>
<p>this organization to be,</p>
<p>in the event of external circumstances,</p>
<p>changing circumstances?</p>
<p>And so by doing that,</p>
<p>we came up with the architecture we have today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you, Jensen.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s very comprehensive.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you had mentioned some Moore&rsquo;s law,</li>
</ul>
<p>interesting problems we&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>And so I wanna touch upon Nvidia&rsquo;s role</p>
<p>in solving the world&rsquo;s greatest problems.</p>
<p>So Nvidia&rsquo;s technologies</p>
<p>is involved in some pretty innovative projects</p>
<p>from healthcare, to sustainability, and more.</p>
<p>Some interesting projects include carbon capture AI,</p>
<p>decoding the COVID spike protein,</p>
<p>speeding DNA sequencing to a single day,</p>
<p>predicting extreme weather.</p>
<p>Can you tell us what are some of your favorite projects</p>
<p>that Nvidia is involved in,</p>
<p>and are there any other projects that we should be aware of</p>
<p>but may not have heard of yet?</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Renee] Large language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funny you should ask.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to share that with you all day.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>I wrote a list.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>You know, the&hellip;</p>
<p>I said earlier that it&rsquo;s great to have a company</p>
<p>that does good business,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s able to also make an impact.</p>
<p>We do good business so that we can make an impact.</p>
<p>That should be the purpose of all companies.</p>
<p>Business making a lot of money,</p>
<p>generating a lot of cash,</p>
<p>creating a lot of value,</p>
<p>gives you the opportunity to be able to do great things.</p>
<p>Great things that otherwise would probably not get done.</p>
<p>And so you mentioned a lot of good ones.</p>
<p>I mean, the work that we do</p>
<p>in digital biology and healthcare,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do without a company of our scale.</p>
<p>And you have to be a company of our scale</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s willing to leverage</p>
<p>a lot of the technology that we built for some other purpose</p>
<p>to direct it and channel it at this really important cause.</p>
<p>Because without us doing something like that,</p>
<p>being clever about taking something that has a day job</p>
<p>and channeling it towards healthcare or climate science,</p>
<p>materials science is another really important areas,</p>
<p>without us doing something like that,</p>
<p>this area of science would not be big enough</p>
<p>to be able to support the level of investment</p>
<p>that we put into it,</p>
<p>the virtual investment that we put into it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the part of the cleverness of the company</p>
<p>to find ways to leverage what otherwise has a day job</p>
<p>playing computer games,</p>
<p>but realize that the architecture with new algorithms</p>
<p>is really fantastic at climate science.</p>
<p>And so for us to adapt this platform in this way</p>
<p>allows us to both drive a great business,</p>
<p>but also drive great impact.</p>
<p>And so that gives us a lot of pleasure.</p>
<p>And when I mentioned earlier a company with great business,</p>
<p>but also a great sense of purpose,</p>
<p>this is really at the heart of that.</p>
<ul>
<li>And talking about well-run business,</li>
</ul>
<p>one of your favorite books is &ldquo;The Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hopefully, many of you guys have read that book.</p>
<p>And the lesson learned that most people got from that book</p>
<p>is that a well-run business can&rsquo;t afford</p>
<p>to switch to a new approach</p>
<p>that ultimately will replace the current business model</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>And you mentioned actually on one of the VC panel</p>
<p>at GTC a couple years back</p>
<p>that Nvidia almost went out of business seven times.</p>
<p>Many people probably don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that they turned the company around</p>
<p>over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Could you share with us that experience?</p>
<p>And perhaps looking forward,</p>
<p>what are some of the market indicators are you looking for</p>
<p>to continue to time ahead of the market transitions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, in the beginning,</li>
</ul>
<p>(indistinct) just better our jobs.</p>
<p>And I just&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how else to say it.</p>
<p>The first five years of our company,</p>
<p>really talented people working super, super hard.</p>
<p>But building a company is a new skill.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no nowhere in any books that would properly describe</p>
<p>the circumstances that you&rsquo;re gonna be in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna learn a lot about just building</p>
<p>with so few resources, number one.</p>
<p>Number two, the immense resources of the competition&hellip;</p>
<p>If your company is a hundred million large</p>
<p>and your competitor is 10 billion large,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible for them to give away the product</p>
<p>to keep you at zero.</p>
<p>And so the question is,</p>
<p>how do you break into an industry</p>
<p>that by the time that we showed up was relatively mature?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to tackle exactly one at the moment,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of it has to do</p>
<p>with simultaneously learning how to be a company,</p>
<p>learning how to build products,</p>
<p>a whole bunch of strangers coming together</p>
<p>for the first time,</p>
<p>dealing with competition that is really quite immense,</p>
<p>trying to build a new product</p>
<p>that the customer didn&rsquo;t even realize they wanted,</p>
<p>and an industry that does know</p>
<p>how to value the product that you built.</p>
<p>The list of issues for our startup is just immense.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s any code to share with you</p>
<p>aside from you&rsquo;ve just gotta get to it.</p>
<p>And I think that that ignorance</p>
<p>was not realizing it was impossible to do.</p>
<p>You know, looking back at Nvidia,</p>
<p>I would say building Nvidia doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>The fact that we would build</p>
<p>one of the world&rsquo;s most important computing models,</p>
<p>approaches, in the world that we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>and built up ecosystems all over the world</p>
<p>from all of the industries that you&rsquo;ve mentioned,</p>
<p>and being such a small company&hellip;</p>
<p>Still, we&rsquo;re only 28,000 people large,</p>
<p>and you know how large the computer industry is,</p>
<p>and many of the companies were a fraction</p>
<p>of just anybody&rsquo;s company,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of hard to imagine.</p>
<p>And I think the thing that&hellip;</p>
<p>It never occurred to me that it wasn&rsquo;t possible</p>
<p>when I was at your age.</p>
<p>If you asked me to do it today,</p>
<p>I would tell you flat out it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>Building the next Nvidia is just not possible.</p>
<p>And for a lot of reasons, I&rsquo;ll tell you it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>But at the time,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that it wasn&rsquo;t possible,</p>
<p>and that is your great gift.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, I think you wanna stay in that naive state</p>
<p>for quite a long time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean naive and uninformed.</p>
<p>I was naive and constantly learning</p>
<p>and constantly reading.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite books,</p>
<p>one of them is &ldquo;Positioning,&rdquo; Al Ries I think it is.</p>
<p>Is it Jack Trout, Al Ries?</p>
<p>Really fantastic book.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Renee] &ldquo;Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I read every single page of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read the one that have the sidebar footnote</p>
<p>that tells you years later what happened to those leaders</p>
<p>in the making the decisions.</p>
<p>We actually&hellip;</p>
<p>Nvidia, learned a lot from that.</p>
<p>Like, less is more and-</p>
<ul>
<li>See, I read that when I was in my thirties</li>
</ul>
<p>and it was really good book and it taught me a lot.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is because during a board meeting,</p>
<p>during board meeting,,</p>
<p>one of one of our amazing board members, Harvey Jones,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s asked me a simple question.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;A really simple question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time, I had no idea how simple it was,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it was impossible for me to answer</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>And I was 30 years old at the time, and Harvey said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jensen, how would you position this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t asking about features and benefits.</p>
<p>He was asking, how would you position this?</p>
<p>Where in the world would you&hellip;</p>
<p>Where in the mind, in the context of the ecosystem,</p>
<p>in the context of competition,</p>
<p>how would you position this?</p>
<p>It was a simple question.</p>
<p>The answer is supremely deep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll spend your whole career answering that question.</p>
<p>But the sooner you realize that that question exists,</p>
<p>the sooner you realize that that question exists,</p>
<p>the better off you&rsquo;re gonna be.</p>
<p>And so my question is,</p>
<p>whatever idea you wanna start, partly is what does it do,</p>
<p>but partly how are you gonna position it?</p>
<p>And so if you start answering that question today,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<ul>
<li>So you mentioned some of the headwinds</li>
</ul>
<p>that Nvidia has overcome,</p>
<p>and so I wanna pivot to over the short term outlook</p>
<p>of the tech industry.</p>
<p>So a lot of MBA students choose to come to Haas</p>
<p>because of its strong role in tech and tech recruiting.</p>
<p>However, in recent months,</p>
<p>the tech industry has been hit hard with massive layoffs</p>
<p>announced across almost all major tech companies.</p>
<p>Nvidia has not, and will not,</p>
<p>has not announced any. (audience laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>I had to be careful what I said.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to be careful what I said.</p>
<p>(Jensen laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>Boy, the electricity in the room changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>While the students in the crowd are afraid to admit,</li>
</ul>
<p>but many MBA- - There was a nervous&hellip;</p>
<p>And the CEO had a nervous laugh.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>And his eyes became shifty.</p>
<p>He started moving about in his chair.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So, many of the NBA students are afraid of-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He became less animated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>Generally more reserved.</p>
<p>Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, what was your question, man?</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry about that.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>So many MBA students here are afraid to admit,</p>
<p>but they are-</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re in our quiet period.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding. (audience laughing)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in our quiet period.</p>
<ul>
<li>So many of the students here</li>
</ul>
<p>are nervous about their employment prospects.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? - Wow.</p>
<p>This question is gonna be hard to answer.</p>
<p>Go ahead, what is it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not hiring.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your thoughts on the recent headwinds</li>
</ul>
<p>in the tech industry,</p>
<p>and do you have any advice for current MBA students</p>
<p>who were once considering the tech industry</p>
<p>and maybe having second thoughts?</p>
<ul>
<li>No, the tech industry is great.</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are so compound, don&rsquo;t you guys think?</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>And ambiguous.</p>
<p>The tech industry is fantastic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what could be a more important industry</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>And the reason for that</p>
<p>is because influence is so many industries.</p>
<p>You could argue Nvidia is in the pure tech industry.</p>
<p>There are some tech companies</p>
<p>that are in the internet services industry.</p>
<p>Obviously, they&rsquo;re not in healthcare</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not in forestry</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not in manufacturing or so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But we are in the pure tech industry.</p>
<p>And I could tell you</p>
<p>that the pure tech industry is incredible.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is because, obviously,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at the core and foundation of every single industry,</p>
<p>and every industry is gonna be a tech industry in the future</p>
<p>to utilize the technology we create.</p>
<p>And I love the work that we do.</p>
<p>The environment is challenging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very tough.</p>
<p>The environment is very tough, obviously.</p>
<p>And there are friends that have been laid off,</p>
<p>there are colleagues that have been laid off,</p>
<p>there are spouses have been laid off,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s tough out there, but it will pass.</p>
<p>The size of the tech industry</p>
<p>is one tenth of what it&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>100th of what it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>And so I think this is one</p>
<p>of the most vibrant industries in the world,</p>
<p>most exciting industries in the world and most impactful,</p>
<p>and so I would encourage all of you to consider it.</p>
<p>And with respect to the advice in the near term,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gotta be resilient to be great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one thing&hellip;</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways you could describe me,</p>
<p>but resilient has to be on top of that list.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of tough things</p>
<p>and the company has been on its back multiple times</p>
<p>as Renee said.</p>
<p>And we have challenges from the environment,</p>
<p>from the economy, from competition,</p>
<p>from all kinds of places.</p>
<p>but you just have to keep a positive outlook</p>
<p>and just keep walking past it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always moving forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ever moving forward too fast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m always, always moving forward.</p>
<p>And people ask me, &ldquo;Hey, how&rsquo;s your day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I usually say, &ldquo;Good enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lot of people say, &ldquo;Incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not incredible, but it&rsquo;s good enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough for me to wanna keep on going everyday</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m loving it plenty much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I wish it was better some days,</p>
<p>some days it&rsquo;s better than I thought it would be,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all good enough.</p>
<p>And I think this even keeled attitude,</p>
<p>resilience towards into the future</p>
<p>has really served Nvidia well.</p>
<p>And we have leaders in our company</p>
<p>that have been there for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>30 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there for 30 years</p>
<p>and there are are others that have been there for 30 years,</p>
<p>and my hope is that we work together</p>
<p>for as long as we shall live.</p>
<p>This attitude about building companies</p>
<p>instead of revolving doors,</p>
<p>and somebody makes a mistake</p>
<p>or misses a quarter, and poof, they&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>Or they miss a commitment, poof, they&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>I think that way of building a company</p>
<p>is really not very productive</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not very long-term-minded.</p>
<p>And my advice to you guys is, it&rsquo;s a bad year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be the only bad year</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re ever gonna enjoy,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t even tell you</p>
<p>this is going to be the worst year,</p>
<p>but your attitude should be, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you. - Your attitude should be,</li>
</ul>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter. - Thank you. Jensen.</p>
<p>Would you be willing to take some questions</p>
<p>from our incredibly resilient students and community?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yeah, yeah, sorry about that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Ann] So some of you&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to ask a question,</p>
<p>can you please go to the mic in the back of the room</p>
<p>and identify yourself,</p>
<p>and remember to make it not a compound question,</p>
<p>but a simple one question would be great.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, Jensen.</li>
</ul>
<p>My name&rsquo;s Garv.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an undergraduate here,</p>
<p>majoring in electrical engineering,</p>
<p>computer science and business.</p>
<p>And my father&rsquo;s been working at Nvidia for five years.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been a senior compiler verification engineer with CUDA,</p>
<p>so I thought that was really interesting.</p>
<p>And maybe a bit on the nose,</p>
<p>but understanding a bit about my dad&rsquo;s job prospects.</p>
<p>I keep thinking about the future of CUDA.</p>
<p>I wonder if the trend we see in other industries</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re moving towards like much more specialized chips,</p>
<p>is the death of the general purpose GPU coming?</p>
<p>Will we see a move away from CUDA into things like FPGAs</p>
<p>to run all of those things like healthcare, ML, AI?</p>
<p>Where is the future of CUDA in this?</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a tension</li>
</ul>
<p>between general purposeness and acceleration.</p>
<p>General purposeness has the benefit,</p>
<p>it does everything obviously,</p>
<p>but it does everything poorly.</p>
<p>Acceleration has the benefit</p>
<p>of doing something incredibly well,</p>
<p>maybe a thousand times better,</p>
<p>but it can only do one thing.</p>
<p>And, you know, inside a computer,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just do one thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just run one thing.</p>
<p>And so the question is, how do you&hellip;</p>
<p>And if you only do one thing,</p>
<p>that one thing&rsquo;s market size is only so big.</p>
<p>And if that one thing&rsquo;s market size is only so big,</p>
<p>you can only invest so much in it.</p>
<p>So for example, if the market size</p>
<p>is a hundred million dollars for that one thing,</p>
<p>how much can you possibly invest</p>
<p>in that hundred million dollars?</p>
<p>Less than a hundred million dollars?</p>
<p>But if you have the ability to do more than one thing,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, it&rsquo;s still acceleration,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a hundred things</p>
<p>and they share a lot of characteristics,</p>
<p>by aggregating a hundred things in multiple domains,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s fluids, maybe it&rsquo;s particles,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s beams, maybe it&rsquo;s raised,</p>
<p>whatever it is, whatever the domain is, okay?</p>
<p>If you could aggregate a lot of these,</p>
<p>then your investment ability is gonna be much greater.</p>
<p>Makes sense, right?</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s a really slippery slope.</p>
<p>If you become completely general purpose,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not good at anything anymore.</p>
<p>And so we created a model,</p>
<p>a computing approach called accelerated computing</p>
<p>where these two chips come together.</p>
<p>CUDA is about, part of the work being done on a CPU,</p>
<p>part of the work being done on the GPU on CUDA.</p>
<p>And so the ability for us to spread that work</p>
<p>and use the right processor for the right job</p>
<p>and still be able to engage,</p>
<p>solve the needs of sufficiently large markets,</p>
<p>our ability to invest is gonna be greater,</p>
<p>the technology can advance greater, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Does it makes sense?</p>
<p>So this is the fundamental tension that you described,</p>
<p>and this is at the essence of almost everything that we do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sounds good.</li>
</ul>
<p>Glad to hear my dad will still have a job.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jensen] He&rsquo;s gonna have a great job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Jensen. - Hi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My name is Nevo, EW student here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for being here.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Speaking for everybody here,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great to have a CEO of a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s making a global impact talking to us.</p>
<p>So really appreciate you being here.</p>
<p>So I think my question is, so a manager at your level,</p>
<p>your scope cuts across finance, marketing, technology,</p>
<p>et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>At your level, how do you manage to keep a high level view</p>
<p>of where the company&rsquo;s going, where the industry&rsquo;s going,</p>
<p>and also getting to the details of like, technology,</p>
<p>what innovations you guys need,</p>
<p>people strategy, thinking through lay layoffs</p>
<p>or not laying people off, stuff like that.</p>
<p>How do you balance your time out</p>
<p>so that you have a high level view,</p>
<p>but also, like, get in the weeds of the work</p>
<p>your teams are doing? - All of our best leaders&hellip;</p>
<p>All of our best leaders are deep and wide.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be the deepest</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have to be the widest,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re deep and wide.</p>
<p>And so the only way to do so is, one,</p>
<p>to have deep interest in the work of others.</p>
<p>You really wanna be able to make a difference.</p>
<p>You have to have the attitude.</p>
<p>And I have the attitude</p>
<p>that if I&rsquo;m sitting with the finance team,</p>
<p>I can make a contribution in finance.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m sitting with the legal team,</p>
<p>I can make a contribution in legal, our legal activities.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m sitting with HR,</p>
<p>I can make a contribution with HR.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m sitting with the architects,</p>
<p>I can make a contribution with the architects.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m sitting with our research team,</p>
<p>I can make a contribution to our research team.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta believe that,</p>
<p>you have to strive for that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t always necessarily contribute as much as you like,</p>
<p>but you really have to strive for that.</p>
<p>As a CEO, you just have to strive for that.</p>
<p>Now, the best leaders in our company, all can do that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all quite broad in their understanding</p>
<p>of the issues at hand,</p>
<p>and that just takes experience.</p>
<p>Just, after you work for a long time,</p>
<p>if you stay with the company for a long time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna learn how things work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in the 10-year tenure.</p>
<p>I believe that you&rsquo;re just barely figuring it out</p>
<p>after 10 years,</p>
<p>hopefully they give you another 20, 30 years.</p>
<p>And so I think the dedication to the craft matters.</p>
<p>Being CEO, being a leader,</p>
<p>being an entrepreneur, it&rsquo;s a craft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no different than cooking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no different than gardening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a craft,</p>
<p>and you have to decide to dedicate yourself to the craft.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any easy answer</p>
<p>aside from that,</p>
<p>but you have to have curiosity,</p>
<p>you have deep empathy for other people&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>you have to really&hellip;</p>
<p>I genuinely care for the success of my engineering team,</p>
<p>my business team, my marketing team,</p>
<p>my HR team, my finance team.</p>
<p>I genuinely care for their success</p>
<p>and I genuinely believe</p>
<p>that I can bring some perspective to help them today.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s the way to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Nevo] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Jensen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Grant, a part-time EW student working in sustainability.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just really inspired to hear your part</p>
<p>about not just benefiting shareholders,</p>
<p>but also society and having impact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s huge for us at Berkeley.</p>
<p>I guess in that line, I also saw in your CSR report</p>
<p>a lot of things you discussed</p>
<p>about climate modeling, et cetera.</p>
<p>Really inspiring, and I guess also being in the field,</p>
<p>I noticed that with y&rsquo;all being innovators,</p>
<p>kind of like AMD and other competitors,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve also set a really high bar on this impact space</p>
<p>in terms of product energy efficiency</p>
<p>kind of at the heart of what you do every day.</p>
<p>I think AMD is like a 30 by 25 goal</p>
<p>for 30 times energy efficiency improvement in their chips</p>
<p>and has set an SBTi target for climate change,</p>
<p>(indistinct) Scope 3.</p>
<p>And I was wondering, maybe some of those things</p>
<p>are coming in your next CSR report,</p>
<p>but I guess could you maybe give a taste</p>
<p>of where you see this ESG field</p>
<p>and kind of your impact going,</p>
<p>probably to the heart of your business,</p>
<p>kind of like AMD and others.</p>
<p>Just wondering if you could speak to that for a bit.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&rsquo;t speak on their behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing a lot of great things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a great company</p>
<p>and they have excellent people</p>
<p>and we enjoy working with them.</p>
<p>Our approach is really very different.</p>
<p>Our approach goes&hellip;</p>
<p>Our approach is not just about building chips</p>
<p>that we hope somebody would use to solve climate science.</p>
<p>Our approach isn&rsquo;t to build chips</p>
<p>that we hope somebody would buy from a computer company</p>
<p>that would then someday translates</p>
<p>to discovering some material.</p>
<p>Our approach is engaging the science</p>
<p>and doing basic research on the science itself.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, I think, the only pure tech company</p>
<p>that have climate research scientists, roboticists,</p>
<p>people who are doing fundamental work</p>
<p>in digital biology, you name it.</p>
<p>And so we engage the science directly,</p>
<p>we do basic research,</p>
<p>and we find a way to make a contribution</p>
<p>in a way that nobody in the industry is currently doing.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s our approach.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s much more direct,</p>
<p>much more intentional, and much less passive.</p>
<p>The idea that we would just build chips</p>
<p>and somebody would use it</p>
<p>for discovering the next great breakthrough</p>
<p>that leads to a Nobel Prize</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re a computer company,</p>
<p>I would just have to say, no, duh.</p>
<p>If we absolutely don&rsquo;t care about it at all</p>
<p>and we just make chips,</p>
<p>that will obviously happen</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re in the computer industry.</p>
<p>You could say that if you&rsquo;re a DRAM company.</p>
<p>But we decided fairly early on</p>
<p>that we would engage the science very directly,</p>
<p>and we have some amazing research</p>
<p>that comes out of our company.</p>
<p>Thank you. - Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, (indistinct),</li>
</ul>
<p>and I currently work under Renee as a high school intern.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jensen] Yay, Good job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And I just wanted to thank you</p>
<p>for all your insightful information</p>
<p>that you shared with me today.</p>
<p>And although there&rsquo;s economic downturn right now,</p>
<p>you still supported myself</p>
<p>and the nine other Cristo Rey students</p>
<p>that Nvidia sponsors from Cristo Rey High School.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to thank you</p>
<p>for all the opportunities you&rsquo;ve given me,</p>
<p>and as well as getting leadership from Renee as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jensen] Don&rsquo;t let his questions scare you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But because I&rsquo;m going to like college soon,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I just wanted to know what are some of the opportunities</p>
<p>that you experienced now</p>
<p>that you wished you would&rsquo;ve witnessed beforehand,</p>
<p>that helped shaped you become the person you are today?</p>
<ul>
<li>I can only tell you the great piece of advice I got</li>
</ul>
<p>when I was growing up.</p>
<p>Be a doctor.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>Also&hellip;</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s absolutely right,</p>
<p>my father was absolutely right.</p>
<p>Be a chemical engineer</p>
<p>because chemistry is always important.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t my path,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t because they were wrong.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re perfectly good careers,</p>
<p>it just wasn&rsquo;t my path.</p>
<p>And you just gotta figure out your path.</p>
<p>Where do I think the next amazing revolution&rsquo;s gonna come?</p>
<p>And this is going to be flat out</p>
<p>one of the biggest ones ever.</p>
<p>And I told you I was gonna tell you,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no question that digital biology is gonna be it.</p>
<p>For the very first time in our history, in human history,</p>
<p>biology has the opportunity to be engineering, not science.</p>
<p>When something becomes engineering, not science,</p>
<p>it becomes less sporadic and exponentially improving.</p>
<p>It can compound on the benefits</p>
<p>of the previous years.</p>
<p>And every company&rsquo;s contribution,</p>
<p>every research&rsquo;s contributions,</p>
<p>compound on each other.</p>
<p>For the very first time, we know how to represent biology,</p>
<p>understand the language of biology,</p>
<p>we can represent the language of chemistry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never happened before.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very proud to say that Nvidia</p>
<p>is at the center of all of that</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve made it possible</p>
<p>for some of this breakthrough to happen.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re gonna have incredible tools</p>
<p>that brings the world of biology,</p>
<p>which is very chaotic and random&hellip;</p>
<p>Or not random, but very chaotic,</p>
<p>and constantly changing</p>
<p>and very diverse and complex obviously,</p>
<p>and bring it into the world of computer science.</p>
<p>And that is going to be profound.</p>
<p>And so if you happen to love this intersection,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be rich with opportunities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a giant industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Great, thank you so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey, Jansen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for your time today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Nehal, I&rsquo;m a first year undergrad here at Haass.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an exciting time right now for autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>particularly for Nvidia&rsquo;s business with Mercedes</p>
<p>and their L3 approval.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to ask you</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re thinking about prioritizing</p>
<p>the autonomous business over the next 10 years</p>
<p>relative to other segments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our strategy is not to build a self-driving car only,</li>
</ul>
<p>but our strategy is to enable the entire world</p>
<p>to make everything that moves</p>
<p>be fully autonomous or partly autonomous.</p>
<p>And so the way we approach this problem</p>
<p>is to try to understand, first of all,</p>
<p>what does autonomous computing computer look like?</p>
<p>And we built the world&rsquo;s first robotics computer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called AGX Xavier,</p>
<p>and it was the first robotics computer ever made.</p>
<p>And it was very odd</p>
<p>and it was sensor rich in the type of processing it does.</p>
<p>Very common sense now,</p>
<p>but at the time, it looked very different</p>
<p>than a personal computer.</p>
<p>It looked very different than an iPhone for example.</p>
<p>So the computer chip was something that we said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, it&rsquo;s gonna be a new type of processing,</p>
<p>new type of algorithms,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take a new type of computer,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and we built that.</p>
<p>The second thing that we did</p>
<p>was we built the entire software stack</p>
<p>to go figure out what are the algorithms that it would take</p>
<p>to sense what&rsquo;s happening in the environment,</p>
<p>perceive its environment,</p>
<p>reason about where it is and where it wants to go,</p>
<p>and then take the appropriate actions and plans</p>
<p>to get there.</p>
<p>And so that robotic stack,</p>
<p>we started to build it so that we understand better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different than Windows and Excel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a robotic stack that is real time,</p>
<p>and safety is involved,</p>
<p>and its ability to reason about where it is</p>
<p>and perceive where it is is really important.</p>
<p>And so that computing stack had to be invented,</p>
<p>so we started working on that.</p>
<p>And then of course, developing software for a robot</p>
<p>is very different than software for Excel and other things.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t program it into existence.</p>
<p>You have to use this technique called machine learning.</p>
<p>So you have to build a computer</p>
<p>that constantly learns from examples</p>
<p>to write software by itself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called deep learning.</p>
<p>And so using a computer to automatically write software</p>
<p>with our coaching and our guidance</p>
<p>to write a piece of code</p>
<p>that would then ultimately run on this computer</p>
<p>requires a data center and a whole bunch of new tools,</p>
<p>and we went and built that.</p>
<p>And then, of course, all of this is great.</p>
<p>We have to go find partners that we can work with</p>
<p>to build their cars with them.</p>
<p>And then secondarily, we open up the platform</p>
<p>so that if you wanna buy our chips, terrific.</p>
<p>If you wanna buy our chips and algorithms, terrific.</p>
<p>If you wanna use the operating system, terrific.</p>
<p>Or you just wanna use</p>
<p>our Omniverse virtual world simulator</p>
<p>so that you can do synthetic data generation</p>
<p>and test your robot in this virtual world, fantastic.</p>
<p>However you want do it is fantastic.</p>
<p>And so we opened up the platform,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got customers working with us</p>
<p>in all these different areas.</p>
<p>Our fundamental goal,</p>
<p>notice, the strategy I just described,</p>
<p>the work that we did,</p>
<p>the strategy I just described,</p>
<p>reflects the vision that we started with,</p>
<p>which is, in the beginning I said,</p>
<p>what is your vision,</p>
<p>what are we trying to do?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s not just build a self-driving car.</p>
<p>We could do more than that for the world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go build a computing platform end-to-end full stack</p>
<p>so that everybody in the world</p>
<p>who wants to build anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s autonomous that moves can.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re Caterpillar, if you&rsquo;re Komatsu,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a Little Nero, if you&rsquo;re robotaxi,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re commercial car, a shuttle, a bus,</p>
<p>we got stuff all over that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It makes everything&hellip;</p>
<p>It makes everything safer,</p>
<p>things that are autonomous never lose concentration.</p>
<p>Of course, the technology&rsquo;s hard,</p>
<p>but our approach reflects our vision.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Thanks. - Awesome, thank you, Jansen.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Jensen] Yeah, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, my name is Simeon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a first year EW MBA student.</p>
<p>You talked about the importance</p>
<p>of adaptability in architecture,</p>
<p>and like your ability to be able to change</p>
<p>the course of the company over the weekend in email.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could speak at all</p>
<p>to any downsides to adaptability</p>
<p>and how it might compromise quality of a product?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, there are two systems, really good.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two systems that every company needs to have.</p>
<p>In the beginning of a startup,</p>
<p>I would recommend your mostly adaptive.</p>
<p>Agility is your only instrument.</p>
<p>And the reason for that</p>
<p>is because there are too many unknowns.</p>
<p>To set up some kind of a rigid organization</p>
<p>with org charts and empires for people to protect</p>
<p>and organizations and people they have to go protect,</p>
<p>and they talk about my people,</p>
<p>my people this, my people that,</p>
<p>as if the people belong to them,</p>
<p>you wanna avoid that as long as you can.</p>
<p>But at some point, the machinery that you create</p>
<p>needs to be systematic and consistent as well.</p>
<p>And the reason for that</p>
<p>is because customers need to depend on you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>In our company&rsquo;s case, our product is not the final product,</p>
<p>our product has a whole bunch of other products</p>
<p>built on top of it and with it.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve got their plan</p>
<p>and they need to be able to depend on us</p>
<p>time in and time out.</p>
<p>And so that execution machine is really important.</p>
<p>So the company you wanna build at some point</p>
<p>evolves to essentially having a execution engine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>and a innovation engine that&rsquo;s adaptable,</p>
<p>and you have to find the way to create these two systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no different than most computers have these days.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s parts of the computer that&rsquo;s real time, isochronous,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s parts of the computer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interrupt driven, best effort, okay?</p>
<p>And so not everything in the computer</p>
<p>can isochronous, and always continuously running,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t have everything</p>
<p>being interrupt driven as well.</p>
<p>And so, but you need to have both.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Simeon] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, Jansen, my name is Kai.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a first year EW MBA student.</p>
<p>And you mentioned that you have two great kids</p>
<p>and a great dog and a great wife,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re comfortable with where you work.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m wondering what make you</p>
<p>make the final decision to switch?</p>
<p>I feel it&rsquo;s very hard,</p>
<p>especially when we are already feeling comfortable,</p>
<p>make good money,</p>
<p>and that you had to sacrifice,</p>
<p>give up everything else and make a switch.</p>
<p>And is it because you truly believe your friends,</p>
<p>envision a good team,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re already envision a good technology,</p>
<p>or just because of random Tuesday.?</p>
<ul>
<li>I believed in them and I believed in myself</li>
</ul>
<p>to be able to build something.</p>
<p>Now, the question is, at the time,</p>
<p>do we really&hellip;</p>
<p>Our vision about what we&rsquo;re gonna build,</p>
<p>did it really manifest?</p>
<p>The answer is, not really.</p>
<p>But I believed in them,</p>
<p>and I believed in myself.</p>
<p>I also believed that even though</p>
<p>we had a family and our kids were young,</p>
<p>they were just one and two,</p>
<p>we had a lot of responsibility and we were young parents.</p>
<p>And I could say that that could cause us</p>
<p>to be quite risk averse,</p>
<p>but I was never concerned</p>
<p>about being able to do something else if it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>And so I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t risking anything.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s too careless by some other standards,</p>
<p>but I really believed in it.</p>
<p>I believe that we weren&rsquo;t putting our family in harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>And if things don&rsquo;t work out,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be an even better job for me somewhere, someday.</p>
<p>And so on the one hand,</p>
<p>the opportunity to do something great</p>
<p>with people that I really respected and loved to this day,</p>
<p>and confidence that we&rsquo;ll be able to do something great,</p>
<p>and not really feeling that we&rsquo;re losing anything.</p>
<p>And we were young.</p>
<p>Lori and I were young,</p>
<p>so it wasn&rsquo;t a decision that was so difficult, per se,</p>
<p>was probably even less than a dinner conversation</p>
<p>and maybe even less than that, you know?</p>
<p>And so I think all of you are young and bright,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so much opportunity out there.</p>
<p>I genuinely don&rsquo;t believe that when you make a decision</p>
<p>to start a company or join a startup, frankly,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is a horribly difficult life decision.</p>
<p>The only thing that really matters is,</p>
<p>in my estimation is,</p>
<p>are you gonna love the people that you work with?</p>
<p>Are you gonna love the work that you&rsquo;re gonna do?</p>
<p>Are you gonna love it so much</p>
<p>that all the pain and suffering that&rsquo;s gonna come your way,</p>
<p>which I promise you will be lots,</p>
<p>the pain and suffering and the setbacks</p>
<p>and the disappointments, the list of bad days,</p>
<p>if you were to pile them all together</p>
<p>into one moment for me, like Renee was trying to do earlier,</p>
<p>the seven times you almost went out of business</p>
<p>and pile it onto one instance, you might blow up.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t answer it.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too painful.</p>
<p>And so as you know,</p>
<p>great athletes and great achievers</p>
<p>all have this one characteristic.</p>
<p>They have the ability to forget the last moment.</p>
<p>That was the last point.</p>
<p>That was the last down.</p>
<p>That was the last, whatever.</p>
<p>That was the last game.</p>
<p>The ability to forget.</p>
<p>And, boy, I gotta tell you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got incredible ability to forget.</p>
<p>And so you just gotta let the past be the past,</p>
<p>and that helps you with your resilience.</p>
<p>And so long as you love the work that you do,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to keep on carrying on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hundred percent of the wisdom.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Ann] Thank you so much.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have time for one more question?</p>
<ul>
<li>[Jensen] Yeah, I&rsquo;m happy.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m here all night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here all night. (audience laughing)</p>
<p>I made you guys wait.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the punishment.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re late in business,</p>
<p>you gotta earn your way back in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, Jensen, this is Dave.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a master&rsquo;s in financial engineering student at Haas.</p>
<p>Thank you for the great session.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been super interesting and helpful for us.</p>
<p>So, Nvidia is like a market leader for AI processing</p>
<p>and ChatGPT is going super viral</p>
<p>in the past three to six months.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of speculation in the market</p>
<p>to what it could potentially be</p>
<p>for the semiconductor industry in general,</p>
<p>but would love to be hearing what&rsquo;s your take</p>
<p>on like Nvidia&rsquo;s long-term sustainability</p>
<p>and what do you think about ChatGPT as a technology?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, again,</li>
</ul>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of different questions in there,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tear it apart.</p>
<p>First of all, ChatGPT is a very, very big deal.</p>
<p>Just think about it.</p>
<p>In just a few days, handful of days,</p>
<p>it has now reached tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more than five, it&rsquo;s probably less than 30.</p>
<p>And the amazing thing is this,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s using it for different reasons</p>
<p>and everybody finds it delightful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s its miracle.</p>
<p>When was the last time that we saw a piece of technology</p>
<p>that is so versatile that it can solve problems</p>
<p>and surprise people in so many ways so often?</p>
<p>It can write poem, of course,</p>
<p>it can write&hellip;</p>
<p>You guys shouldn&rsquo;t use it yet,</p>
<p>not unless you get permission.</p>
<p>It could fill out a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>It could do a SQL query.</p>
<p>It could write a SQL query and do a SQL query.</p>
<p>It could write Python code as you know.</p>
<p>It could write Verilog you know?</p>
<p>And so if it can&rsquo;t do it today,</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;ll be able to do it Sunday.</p>
<p>And so the fact that you have this tool</p>
<p>that can do all these different things</p>
<p>has really surprised a lot of people around the world.</p>
<p>Now, for a lot of people in the industry</p>
<p>that have been working on this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been waiting for this moment.</p>
<p>This is the iPhone moment, if you will,</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>This is the time when all of the big ideas</p>
<p>about mobile computing and all that,</p>
<p>it all came together in a product</p>
<p>that everybody just kind of, I see it.</p>
<p>I see it.</p>
<p>I can now use this as an API,</p>
<p>and I connect to a spreadsheet,</p>
<p>I connect it to PowerPoint,</p>
<p>I connect it to a drawing program,</p>
<p>I connect it to a photo editing program,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll make everything better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make everything better.</p>
<p>And so we now know that this is going to be a monumental</p>
<p>impact on technology.</p>
<p>And now the question is,</p>
<p>how quickly would the technology diffuse?</p>
<p>And I think that the last 60 days</p>
<p>kind of tells us something.</p>
<p>The rate of technology diffusion could be quite high.</p>
<p>For example, since ChatGPT came out,</p>
<p>probably some 500 startups have already happened.</p>
<p>And not only that, in about two weeks time,</p>
<p>they created applications</p>
<p>that are really delightful and useful</p>
<p>in a couple weeks time.</p>
<p>This is no different than when browsers were created</p>
<p>and somebody, boom, overnight wrote JavaScript,</p>
<p>and bam, you&rsquo;ve got a website</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really quite surprising,</p>
<p>or when the iPhone came out,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden, somebody wrote something,</p>
<p>took about a couple of weekends,</p>
<p>and bam, they have piece of software</p>
<p>they can download from the app store.</p>
<p>And before you know it, it&rsquo;s something like Spotify.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty amazing, right?</p>
<p>And so these kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>This is gonna happen now.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s really exciting to me is that,</p>
<p>that this basic technology</p>
<p>can now be applied to a whole bunch of other industries</p>
<p>that have never enjoyed the benefit of technology.</p>
<p>Think about this idea.</p>
<p>For the last 40 years,</p>
<p>for the entire 40 years that I&rsquo;ve been in the industry,</p>
<p>we have done nothing but make computers</p>
<p>harder and harder for people to program,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why the technology divide has been so large.</p>
<p>And the technology divide is getting larger and larger,</p>
<p>except till one day.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, everybody can program a computer.</p>
<p>Literally, everyone can program a computer.</p>
<p>We have democratized computing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a farmer,</p>
<p>a doctor, a nurse, a frontline worker, assistant,</p>
<p>a travel agent, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>a small business, a restaurant owner, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Everybody is now a programmer, isn&rsquo;t that right?</p>
<p>You just have to prompt this thing</p>
<p>to write a program for you,</p>
<p>to do something for you, automate something for you.</p>
<p>We have just&hellip;</p>
<p>We have done what OpenAI has done</p>
<p>and what the team over there has done.</p>
<p>Genuinely, it&rsquo;s one of the greatest things</p>
<p>that has ever been done for computing.</p>
<p>We have democratized computing in a very, very large way,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;m very, very excited about that.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m excited about the prospects of it,</p>
<p>of course, as you can tell.</p>
<p>Now the question is, how is it gonna impact healthcare?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it gonna impact transportation?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it gonna impact retail, logistics?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it gonna impact manufacturing?</p>
<p>The other hundred trillion dollar industry</p>
<p>that is today largely not served by technology.</p>
<p>Computing industry is tiny compared to the world&rsquo;s industry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a hundred trillion dollars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s giant.</p>
<p>And so we could do something now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Dave] Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Merich] Hi, Jensen, thank you for talking to us tonight.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m Merich, French business student.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Ann] This will be the last question, I promise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Merich] All right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stand here afterwards because I&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So they can turn off the lights and I&rsquo;ll just&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer the rest of your questions.</p>
<p>I owe it to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>So, yeah, I wanted to know what was, in your opinion,</li>
</ul>
<p>your biggest mistake and how did you overcome it</p>
<p>in your business life?</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t wanna disappoint you,</li>
</ul>
<p>but the number of mistakes that I&rsquo;ve made is so many</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard for me to really say,</p>
<p>wow, you&rsquo;re the champion.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>And the reason for that is,</p>
<p>right now, as you&rsquo;re asking the question,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t make that many mistakes,</p>
<p>then one kind of stands out.</p>
<p>Do you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>If you make mistakes all the time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time picking one out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of loving all of them.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>I love all my children.</p>
<p>Because when it&rsquo;s a success,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s a mistake, it&rsquo;s yours, okay?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve made strategy mistakes.</p>
<p>However, it led to something really great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made execution mistakes.</p>
<p>However, I learned more deeply about the craft,</p>
<p>which then led me to become better at managing that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made&hellip;</p>
<p>Walked away from business I shouldn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken business I shouldn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not exactly sure</p>
<p>what I learned from either one of those.</p>
<p>And so I think the list&hellip;</p>
<p>The only thing that I will tell you about that</p>
<p>is you have to learn how to estimate opportunity cost.</p>
<p>One of the things that most people don&rsquo;t do very well</p>
<p>is estimating opportunity cost, only cost.</p>
<p>Because when you look at your P&amp;L,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t ever describe opportunity cost.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>It only describes the things that you did do</p>
<p>and the cost that incurred as a result of that.</p>
<p>It turns out, most of life is about the things</p>
<p>that you could have done, but you didn&rsquo;t have time to do.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re the CEO of the company,</p>
<p>the company&rsquo;s resources, that&rsquo;s what you manage,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really important not to squander that.</p>
<p>And Renee heard me said it a hundred times</p>
<p>that my fundamental job</p>
<p>is to create the conditions by which the company succeeds</p>
<p>and do their best work</p>
<p>and selecting projects that are worthy of our company,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really about what to choose</p>
<p>and what not to choose.</p>
<p>And what not to choose is really, really important</p>
<p>because we only have 28,000 people.</p>
<p>And if you kind of loaded your plate</p>
<p>with nothing but salad and fruit at the buffet line,</p>
<p>when you walk up to that ribeye and that fried chicken,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be tough, you know?</p>
<p>And so&hellip;</p>
<p>(Jensen laughs)</p>
<p>Okay, that was just CEO joke, CEO joke.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s going&hellip;</p>
<p>But everybody here is vegetarian.</p>
<p>(audience laughing)</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thank you very much. - Yup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So I just wanna give a huge shout out to Renee and to Ryan,</p>
<p>(audience applauding) and especially the Jensen.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Jensen] Okay, the session&rsquo;s over,</li>
</ul>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll keep answering your question.</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead.</p>
