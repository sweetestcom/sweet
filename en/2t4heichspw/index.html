<p>been like what three months now and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like on and off it comes and it keeps on</p>
<p>coming and going so I just wanted to</p>
<p>know if intermittent fasting and keto</p>
<p>diet would it be really helpful like if</p>
<p>we go into an organ like I would it help</p>
<p>me or like anybody who&rsquo;s suffering from</p>
<p>like the perennial allergic</p>
<p>conductivitis around there</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>so just so I can clarify</p>
<p>um have you isolated uh exactly what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allergic to</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>okay so that that might be helpful to</p>
<p>get a Baseline and you can you know you</p>
<p>know how to do that you would test for</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re allergic to but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>interesting thing about the allergies</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know you have</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>certain methods of avoiding allergies</p>
<p>for a period of time</p>
<p>to hopefully</p>
<p>then reintroduce it in a very very small</p>
<p>level but really allergies are created</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>some glitch in your immune system</p>
<p>and so the most powerful thing you can</p>
<p>do to fix that the immune system is um</p>
<p>is to do fasting and not just regular</p>
<p>intermittent fasting but</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting so if you</p>
<p>were to go this is what I would do if I</p>
<p>were you I would definitely introduce uh</p>
<p>keto for sure because that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>just speed things up and then add</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and probably maybe</p>
<p>your pattern should be starting out six</p>
<p>six hour eating window with an 18 hour</p>
<p>fast okay so you do that and then</p>
<p>um every two weeks do a 48 hour fast</p>
<p>okay for like one month the second month</p>
<p>if you can do this</p>
<p>every week do a 48 hour fast so now we</p>
<p>just we put a lot of fasting in there</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s gonna happen is your immune</p>
<p>system</p>
<p>is going to be forced to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>heal itself because</p>
<p>when you fast you&rsquo;re basically sending</p>
<p>signals to your genes and to heal and</p>
<p>repair because our bodies way long ago</p>
<p>have adapted to not eating since the</p>
<p>because of all the times that we starve</p>
<p>so these bodies are really robust and</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>um to survive we had to adapt and create</p>
<p>these genes to help us survive without</p>
<p>food and so now</p>
<p>if we go back to that we can kick in</p>
<p>these genetic DNA things to</p>
<p>to get rid of inflammatory conditions to</p>
<p>regrow your brain but especially to</p>
<p>repair your immune system and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking like your gut too that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>where a lot of allergies start but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I would do as the the best</p>
<p>thing so many people have gotten rid of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>allergies especially in the skin area</p>
<p>dermatitis just from doing</p>
<p>periodic prolonged fasting and you know</p>
<p>you might want to also include longer</p>
<p>fast somewhere in there as well but I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;d be you&rsquo;re going to be quite</p>
<p>shocked to see the results when you do</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>in a good way</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>okay that started in my regimen and get</p>
<p>back to the two meals or something</p>
<p>that sounds great that&rsquo;s terrific well</p>
<p>thank you so much uh ananya I hope you</p>
<p>can get some rest and yes she made an</p>
<p>important Point anybody that comes on</p>
<p>with us or anybody in social media that</p>
<p>Dr Byrd you know lends a consult we&rsquo;d</p>
<p>love to hear back from all of you to see</p>
<p>and I know he does</p>
<p>to find out whether his research is</p>
<p>solid and if not he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s not shy to</p>
<p>amend it and come up with the latest</p>
<p>deal in health for everyone so let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we go to social media and</p>
<p>start off with Mary from YouTube I have</p>
<p>a friend who went full keto and now has</p>
<p>been bruising very easily and very often</p>
<p>what would cause this change</p>
<p>well usually when you bruise</p>
<p>that could be a problem with the liver</p>
<p>right that could also be a problem with</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>an imbalance in certain nutrients like a</p>
<p>lack of calcium can create bruising</p>
<p>believe it or not and the lack of iron</p>
<p>can create bruising a lack of vitamin K1</p>
<p>can create bruising so so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing intermittent fasting or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing um keto and you start bruising</p>
<p>chances are you&rsquo;re missing a nutrient so</p>
<p>I would start</p>
<p>increasing certain nutrients like</p>
<p>vitamin K1 maybe some iron and calcium</p>
<p>and see if that bruising doesn&rsquo;t go away</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s related to</p>
<p>more likely because everything else is</p>
<p>going to improve your liver function is</p>
<p>going to improve so you wouldn&rsquo;t bruise</p>
<p>unless there was something missing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s terrific okay our happy customer</p>
<p>Rhonda from YouTube I tried vegan for</p>
<p>two years vegetarianism for one year and</p>
<p>flexitarian haven&rsquo;t heard that one for</p>
<p>eight months then I found your Healthy</p>
<p>keto and have been on it for 10 months I</p>
<p>love it so that&rsquo;s great just more great</p>
<p>news from the field let&rsquo;s go to Merrell</p>
<p>from YouTube my father has been</p>
<p>diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas</p>
<p>and abdominal area and is going through</p>
<p>chemotherapy I read your PDF on cancer</p>
<p>protocols is there any other information</p>
<p>that you would offer to my father and</p>
<p>our condolences by the way for his</p>
<p>illness I would watch I would watch</p>
<p>every single video I have on cancer</p>
<p>especially the success stories with</p>
<p>people with stage four and the the key</p>
<p>is that fasting that prolonged fasting</p>
<p>you have to do it</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s the most powerful thing for</p>
<p>cancer and so you&rsquo;ll see why these I</p>
<p>mean you take someone from stage four</p>
<p>to to getting rid of their cancer in a</p>
<p>relatively short period of time by doing</p>
<p>fasting is mind-blowing I would jump on</p>
<p>that immediately and start doing it I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t honestly I don&rsquo;t even think you</p>
<p>can</p>
<p>cure cancer without fasting so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really important thing and you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s I just have to say this about</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>um yeah it&rsquo;s not a diet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pattern of eating and not eating</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s finally putting your control</p>
<p>putting you over control over your Foods</p>
<p>because I know this might sound</p>
<p>off base feet but people have been out</p>
<p>of control with food in the past a</p>
<p>little bit never heard</p>
<p>food is so it&rsquo;s created so much Insanity</p>
<p>I mean like the worst question you can</p>
<p>ask yourself is</p>
<p>what is my body in the mood for today</p>
<p>especially if your blood sugars are up</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re always going to get the</p>
<p>wrong answers you&rsquo;re going to get it</p>
<p>insane like my blood sugars are off if</p>
<p>you if I ask myself that I would want a</p>
<p>jelly donut and or M M&rsquo;s I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like putting someone that is insane</p>
<p>in the driver&rsquo;s seat and you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>back seat and you&rsquo;re letting your body</p>
<p>run your health you&rsquo;re going to go off a</p>
<p>cliff every single time so when you do</p>
<p>fasting you&rsquo;re putting back you in</p>
<p>charge over your body and you&rsquo;re telling</p>
<p>it when it you&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s going to eat and</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not going to eat and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of power that&rsquo;s putting</p>
<p>sanity back in your house and uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s um this this food has been it&rsquo;s out</p>
<p>of control with a lot of people just</p>
<p>crazy it sure is and I think I represent</p>
<p>the portion of the audience that</p>
<p>demonstrates the least control</p>
<p>historically so when I say and by the</p>
<p>way intermittent fasting but full</p>
<p>disclosure I started drifting farther in</p>
<p>the evening so three to six is my</p>
<p>Windows 7 uh just one more of these</p>
<p>piece of cheese and I brought it back</p>
<p>again and it so quickly</p>
<p>um negates my appetite I mean I can</p>
<p>think about something fun but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>pulling me and I can easily sidestep it</p>
<p>and not eat when I am intermittent</p>
<p>fasting it is again the most miraculous</p>
<p>single thing that&rsquo;s ever happened to me</p>
<p>which then puts me in control so if I</p>
<p>want to go more keto I&rsquo;m not constantly</p>
<p>worrying in every waking hour about what</p>
<p>I can or can&rsquo;t have and it&rsquo;s just just a</p>
<p>much much better more satisfying</p>
<p>satisfying excuse me way of life so</p>
<p>thank you Dr bird from that and I know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another a whole bunch of outer</p>
<p>controllers out there that agree with me</p>
<p>and you so why don&rsquo;t we go to our first</p>
<p>quiz question which is right here</p>
<p>all right what is the only carbohydrate</p>
<p>that will not trigger insulin</p>
<p>all right there&rsquo;s only one interesting</p>
<p>figure it out all right uh and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>figure out who is joining us this</p>
<p>morning a good morning to all of our</p>
<p>viewers uh from the UK we have one</p>
<p>coming on shortly Canada Jordan Poland</p>
<p>South Africa Albania Mexico Pakistan the</p>
<p>Netherlands Morocco France Bermuda</p>
<p>Norway Jamaica Chile Sweden Bolivia</p>
<p>India Qatar uh Belgium Australia</p>
<p>Cameroon Croatia Serbia Romania China</p>
<p>the Bahamas on point China&rsquo;s got some</p>
<p>folks listening that&rsquo;s great the Bahamas</p>
<p>Aruba Bangladesh Nigeria Argentina</p>
<p>Antigua Switzerland Algeria Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>New Zealand Germany Italy Ghana uh</p>
<p>Meritus I think I said that right Iraq</p>
<p>Ethiopia the Czech Republic Hong Kong</p>
<p>Uganda Ireland Egypt Trinidad and Tobago</p>
<p>Colombia and all across these United</p>
<p>States of America so thanks everybody so</p>
<p>much for making the Show and Dr Burke&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great work a 6 success</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go back to</p>
<p>social media and uh Man Down is his</p>
<p>handle man down from YouTube in my</p>
<p>second week of chemo and radiation for</p>
<p>colorectal cancer and still feeling</p>
<p>great because I&rsquo;ve been following your</p>
<p>advice on if and cruciferous veggies and</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s made a big impact on my</p>
<p>health thank you so that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>encouraging news we&rsquo;re going to Rita</p>
<p>from YouTube that&rsquo;s fantastic question</p>
<p>and one thing about cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables um</p>
<p>um apparently it triggers uh this</p>
<p>process in your liver where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>turning</p>
<p>carcinogens</p>
<p>poisons into harmless particles so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making these fat soluble poisons</p>
<p>into water-soluble particles that can be</p>
<p>eliminated through the body so</p>
<p>um just goes to show you like the power</p>
<p>of certain foods and definitely</p>
<p>cruciferous like arugula the the radish</p>
<p>the broccoli the Brussels sprouts really</p>
<p>important to put that in back in your</p>
<p>diet if you um ferment the cruciferous</p>
<p>that just takes it to the next level</p>
<p>like fermenting cabbage and sauerkraut</p>
<p>kimchi very potent uh for because now</p>
<p>you actually can um especially for what</p>
<p>you have that would be really good for</p>
<p>your gut because it has not only the</p>
<p>prebiotics but the probiotics plus it</p>
<p>has the cruciferous and uh</p>
<p>even sauerkraut has the most vitamin C</p>
<p>it has like 700 milligrams per cup</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really cool stuff</p>
<p>very good okay here&rsquo;s an interesting</p>
<p>question John from YouTube our apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar tablets and capsules as</p>
<p>effective as a liquid how many should I</p>
<p>take daily to have the same</p>
<p>Effectiveness as the liquid not</p>
<p>mentioning any brands</p>
<p>it it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s harder to get the quantity</p>
<p>but you sure can you can take um you</p>
<p>know I would look on the dosage it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>tell you how it is equivalent to</p>
<p>teaspoons and things like that but yes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be the same thing you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>this powdered acetic acid with all the</p>
<p>other benefits that comes with apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar but</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s one really</p>
<p>powerful thing about apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>anti</p>
<p>diabetic on steroids it just helps lower</p>
<p>the blood sugars and I recently released</p>
<p>a video on this</p>
<p>um that even if someone not they would</p>
<p>ever cheat on the on the keto but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say they were forced to at gunpoint they</p>
<p>had to go off the program for a while</p>
<p>and they had the outside of vinegar they</p>
<p>would actually improve their blood</p>
<p>sugars even if they&rsquo;re eating not great</p>
<p>stuff</p>
<p>so you can have the effects of the lower</p>
<p>insulin it kind of buffers the response</p>
<p>and this I just realized no I did not</p>
<p>release this video yet but uh it will be</p>
<p>coming up uh in the next week or so or</p>
<p>or maybe even two but I&rsquo;m going to show</p>
<p>you how to</p>
<p>um buffer or reduce the side effects</p>
<p>when when you&rsquo;re forced to eat</p>
<p>carbohydrates</p>
<p>or alcohol</p>
<p>so that way we can minimize the damage</p>
<p>control</p>
<p>all right speaking of damage love Korea</p>
<p>from YouTube what&rsquo;s the best supplement</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d recommend to help get my husband</p>
<p>off his cigarette habit</p>
<p>yeah this is I don&rsquo;t know if a vitamin</p>
<p>is going to do it</p>
<p>um but I think that I would go for maybe</p>
<p>the reason why people smoke is something</p>
<p>connected to reducing stress possibly</p>
<p>other than the addiction</p>
<p>um so uh to reduce stress then we then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re talking about B1 vitamin B1</p>
<p>for nutritional yeast that will help</p>
<p>greatly reduce stress but if you think</p>
<p>about it when people smoke</p>
<p>um they almost like they can breathe</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>they can I finally breathe better</p>
<p>because then we&rsquo;re getting more but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breathing in smoke but it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a stress relief</p>
<p>and uh stress builds up and then you</p>
<p>kind of calm yourself down with a</p>
<p>cigarette but um comes with a package</p>
<p>Steve and I think you know that no I</p>
<p>sure do 34 years ago I quit and it was</p>
<p>not fun but well worth it okay awesome</p>
<p>kids from YouTube could fasting hinder</p>
<p>growth in young children</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good question</p>
<p>um yeah I&rsquo;m sure if you&rsquo;re five years</p>
<p>old probably don&rsquo;t do fasting very much</p>
<p>but the type of thing the type of</p>
<p>fasting that I would recommend for</p>
<p>children would be just three meals a day</p>
<p>no snacks that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p>
<p>and make sure it&rsquo;s nutrient dense</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so I wouldn&rsquo;t unless there&rsquo;s like I mean</p>
<p>there were some patients who came in</p>
<p>that were like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know puberty or maybe 13 14</p>
<p>years old and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>they were like severely overweight okay</p>
<p>then we do maybe two meals a day</p>
<p>but we want to make sure for that child</p>
<p>that they have this all the nutrients in</p>
<p>their diet that meal has to be nutrient</p>
<p>dense that&rsquo;s the most important time of</p>
<p>your life is when you&rsquo;re younger to get</p>
<p>the nutrients but of course the average</p>
<p>child is on Ultra processed junk food</p>
<p>with tons of added sugar</p>
<p>if you calculate the amount of sugar</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting from</p>
<p>the hidden sugars from the carbs like</p>
<p>the breads the pasta cereal crackers it</p>
<p>comes out to if I&rsquo;m not mistaken on</p>
<p>average</p>
<p>275 grams of sugar</p>
<p>so that is</p>
<p>about I don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m not good with</p>
<p>math but it could be close to</p>
<p>68 teaspoons of sugar if I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>mistaken per day</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>if you calculate all the other the carbs</p>
<p>that turn into sugar</p>
<p>I mean if you&rsquo;re eating if you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>bread it&rsquo;s eventually going to turn into</p>
<p>sugar so let&rsquo;s count those sugars too</p>
<p>makes sense all right well the audience</p>
<p>uh left on the question which asked what</p>
<p>is the only carbohydrate that will not</p>
<p>trigger insulin and 90 say fiber or</p>
<p>vegetable fibers and 10 say arrowroot or</p>
<p>leafy greens any winners okay every most</p>
<p>people are right it is fiber</p>
<p>the fiber won&rsquo;t trigger that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>more uh</p>
<p>you add the more you eat foods with</p>
<p>fiber the less insulin response so</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s just compare something that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty fibrous like celery or salad or</p>
<p>broccoli okay that has a lot of fiber</p>
<p>versus uh you know like um</p>
<p>pineapple for example it has a lot of</p>
<p>sugar</p>
<p>some Fiber but more sugar than celery</p>
<p>terrific okay and whenever we mention</p>
<p>the people listening around the world we</p>
<p>always have some outliers that want to</p>
<p>make sure that they are recognized and</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s some more from Kenya Israel</p>
<p>Singapore Armenia Syria Libya and Samoa</p>
<p>and welcome to you folks glad you are</p>
<p>watching why don&rsquo;t we kick out another</p>
<p>question here you go doc</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>with calorie intake being the same</p>
<p>which will make you gain more weight egg</p>
<p>whites or whole eggs</p>
<p>okay and to clarify that so you would</p>
<p>have the equal amount of calories with</p>
<p>each</p>
<p>correct so 100 calories of this or 100</p>
<p>calories that</p>
<p>right yep beep on that audience and why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we go back over to our uh green</p>
<p>room and uh the second farthest person</p>
<p>away is Amber in the UK so Amber if you</p>
<p>would unmute yourself you are</p>
<p>successfully on with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi</p>
<p>hi my question is what is the impact of</p>
<p>being on and off against veto constantly</p>
<p>you know a few months on a few months</p>
<p>off falling off the wagon is it a case</p>
<p>of anything is better than nothing or</p>
<p>does it actually have more of a</p>
<p>detrimental impact than your hormones</p>
<p>weight loss efforts all that kind of</p>
<p>stuff</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>better than not doing anything at all</p>
<p>for sure because the times when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on low low carb you&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>these really cool benefit but I will say</p>
<p>that um there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>one of the one of the researchers who</p>
<p>came to my Summit and spoke uh does all</p>
<p>these experiments and so he he went off</p>
<p>keep keto purposely and he started doing</p>
<p>carbs and then he measured the thickness</p>
<p>of his carotid arteries within a short</p>
<p>period of time and they just swole right</p>
<p>up so I think the more a person</p>
<p>understands like what happens when they</p>
<p>go off keto the more they won&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;ve given given the choice I</p>
<p>would uh definitely something is better</p>
<p>than nothing so</p>
<p>um you may find that every time you go</p>
<p>back on to keto it&rsquo;s you might not see</p>
<p>the results like you had before it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>harder and harder to</p>
<p>um get those results because then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with this insulin resistance</p>
<p>um the other thing about um</p>
<p>keto is kind of like one of those things</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like almost all or nothing you</p>
<p>you have to drop your carbs below a</p>
<p>certain level to have it work you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re in 300 carbs and you go</p>
<p>down to 200 carbs that&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>get you into ketosis even slightly so</p>
<p>you have to go all the way down to like</p>
<p>50 or or maybe 40 or 30 but um yeah so</p>
<p>I think I think that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure like um and I think you</p>
<p>said you&rsquo;re from England so they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>good thing they don&rsquo;t have a lot of</p>
<p>sugar there to eat anyway so I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re safe I think you&rsquo;re safe your</p>
<p>environment is very healthy and so we</p>
<p>can easily avoid those Temptations</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great well thank you so much</p>
<p>Amber I think we&rsquo;ve got a little delay</p>
<p>there uh but uh we appreciate you uh</p>
<p>coming on board with us all right let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see let&rsquo;s go back to uh go back to</p>
<p>social media</p>
<p>and oh my goodness quiz question number</p>
<p>two has already been answered</p>
<p>and it asks which with caloric which</p>
<p>caloric intake excuse me with caloric</p>
<p>intake being the same which will make</p>
<p>you gain more weight egg whites or the</p>
<p>whole a</p>
<p>and 88 of our respondents say egg whites</p>
<p>and 12 percent say it&rsquo;s the whole egg</p>
<p>which sounds counter intuitive to me</p>
<p>well the majority is right because</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s something called the insulin</p>
<p>index and and this is based on the fact</p>
<p>that of guidance physiology which I</p>
<p>could probably</p>
<p>pull out right now and show you</p>
<p>um when insulin is higher you lose less</p>
<p>weight and you gain more weight you</p>
<p>store more fat okay so if we look at the</p>
<p>insulin index and compare egg white to</p>
<p>the whole egg</p>
<p>um egg whites</p>
<p>are leaner in protein less fat which</p>
<p>means they&rsquo;re higher on the insulin</p>
<p>scale because the fat</p>
<p>buffers or slows down the instant</p>
<p>response so pure fat</p>
<p>does not trigger insulin too much if at</p>
<p>all so</p>
<p>this is why the whole egg is better for</p>
<p>weight loss than egg whites</p>
<p>yum</p>
<p>okay Monica from YouTube my husband had</p>
<p>a heart scan it indicates he has plaque</p>
<p>buildup he has no pain but his physician</p>
<p>wants to put him on Lipitor is there any</p>
<p>more natural way to reverse this</p>
<p>condition</p>
<p>yeah of course my disclaimer</p>
<p>um I can&rsquo;t tell him not to do anything</p>
<p>that encounters that advice I would</p>
<p>research in the area of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>this whole</p>
<p>you know the side effects of statins</p>
<p>um which basically really destroys your</p>
<p>muscles</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>statins also will lower</p>
<p>cholesterol because it blocks the</p>
<p>production with a lot of side effects</p>
<p>but it raises</p>
<p>uh the type of LDL that you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>in your body which is this the type of</p>
<p>LDL we talked about this I think last</p>
<p>week on this the small dense particles</p>
<p>versus the large buoyant type of LDL you</p>
<p>make this shift and</p>
<p>um we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>um more of the small dents that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>real truly bad type of cholesterol so</p>
<p>that increases with statins so the real</p>
<p>problem with the arteries is the carbs</p>
<p>not the fat not the cholesterol so now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to lower they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>focus on the wrong thing and create a</p>
<p>lot of side effects and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>end up I think in worse shape down the</p>
<p>road</p>
<p>so read some of the books and statins</p>
<p>written by medical doctors so you can</p>
<p>get the full scoop on that and then make</p>
<p>up your mind but um we need we need to</p>
<p>make sure that we get the right problem</p>
<p>you know rather than the symptom</p>
<p>because people are</p>
<p>have a lot of confusions about</p>
<p>cholesterol uh unfortunately</p>
<p>I got it okay Liz feels she has a</p>
<p>problem and she&rsquo;s coming to us from</p>
<p>Facebook I don&rsquo;t have a gallbladder</p>
<p>anymore and I&rsquo;m on keto and if do I have</p>
<p>enough enzymes to break down proteins if</p>
<p>not what should she be doing or taking</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>typically when you remove the</p>
<p>gallbladder now we no longer have the</p>
<p>quantity of concentrated bile because</p>
<p>the gallbladder is supposed to</p>
<p>concentrate concentrate the bile so you</p>
<p>can so it&rsquo;s a lot stronger so now we</p>
<p>have a less concentrated amount of bile</p>
<p>and sometimes a deficiency of bile which</p>
<p>then shows up as a deficiency of vitamin</p>
<p>A d e k</p>
<p>omega-3 fatty acids so now we have we</p>
<p>have to look out for those things so I</p>
<p>would take uh</p>
<p>either my gallbladder formula or another</p>
<p>bile salt product to start to um help</p>
<p>you with that now let&rsquo;s say you want to</p>
<p>know when do I have enough that I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need any more bile if you start to have</p>
<p>loose stools or maybe even diarrhea then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve taken too much</p>
<p>so too much bile will cause excess</p>
<p>elimination too little bile tends to</p>
<p>cause constipation so you want that</p>
<p>happy medium</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see uh</p>
<p>Stephen from Facebook can you offer any</p>
<p>recommendation for someone suffering</p>
<p>from Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of videos on this</p>
<p>um I would ins I mean immediately start</p>
<p>fasting right away</p>
<p>right away you know people say well you</p>
<p>know I mean you know what food is going</p>
<p>to nourish my body and heal my disease</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be the the absence of food</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to make a big difference</p>
<p>but I have done a lot of different</p>
<p>videos on Parkinson&rsquo;s and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different remedies like even B3 niacin</p>
<p>is really good for Parkinson&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dealing with the part of the brain</p>
<p>that regulates</p>
<p>coordination muscle coordination and and</p>
<p>I talk about like what deficiencies That</p>
<p>Could set you up for that what to avoid</p>
<p>what you should start taking because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a terrible situation to be</p>
<p>in that so um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to recommend</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want to just tell you</p>
<p>one remedy and then have it not work I</p>
<p>want you to do the whole eating plan the</p>
<p>fasting and the whole thing so watch</p>
<p>those videos especially the recent ones</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly</p>
<p>updating videos so um I have a whole</p>
<p>series of updated videos</p>
<p>um that I&rsquo;ll be releasing in the next</p>
<p>four weeks that I&rsquo;ve been working on</p>
<p>just because there&rsquo;s new information and</p>
<p>I want you to have um</p>
<p>the superior information so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great and we&rsquo;ll talk a little</p>
<p>later about your big adventure and doing</p>
<p>lots of research uh you know in terms of</p>
<p>our schedule and we&rsquo;re all excited for</p>
<p>that we will miss you Dr Berg but know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re out doing some great</p>
<p>research that will benefit us all uh do</p>
<p>you want to have a word about that now</p>
<p>maybe so this is our last show yeah for</p>
<p>about five five to ten years and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know yeah I&rsquo;ll be gone for like about</p>
<p>four weeks uh I&rsquo;m gonna be doing some</p>
<p>research and I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ll surprise you when I come back as</p>
<p>far as what I find but um</p>
<p>um when you&rsquo;re traveling and then I have</p>
<p>all these this testing equipment</p>
<p>and uh we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>test some things and figure things out</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll share with you</p>
<p>um in a series of videos of what what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve done and what we&rsquo;re gonna what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re planning so I&rsquo;ll leave that as a</p>
<p>mystery to you you&rsquo;ll have to</p>
<p>wait until I come back but so this will</p>
<p>be the last</p>
<p>um show for about four weeks but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be releasing videos each day so I</p>
<p>have some really great new videos coming</p>
<p>up so</p>
<p>definitely check those out but just the</p>
<p>live show will be postponed great we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have time to catch up on that let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>um Louise from Ireland on YouTube</p>
<p>greetings from Ireland love your very</p>
<p>informative videos you&rsquo;re the best now I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to rain on her parade but</p>
<p>Ireland of course is adjacent to</p>
<p>Scotland which has hagas and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most disgusting food I&rsquo;ve ever heard</p>
<p>about so I know it&rsquo;s none of my business</p>
<p>but haggis is absolutely terrible but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re absolutely delighted that people</p>
<p>in Ireland are watching and getting the</p>
<p>benefit and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some people</p>
<p>in Scotland too do you know what hagas</p>
<p>is what what is I think it&rsquo;s a sheep</p>
<p>stomach stuffed with lungs and some high</p>
<p>carb grains and so on and I uh and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s nasty in a friend of mine said</p>
<p>that he actually got hagas from a fast</p>
<p>food store like a gas station store in</p>
<p>uh Scotland and reported it was an awful</p>
<p>experience so hagas</p>
<p>oh my well I guess if it&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>lungs in the stomach then that would be</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t it if you leave out the ground</p>
<p>yes so no it&rsquo;s a turtle they&rsquo;re well on</p>
<p>the way so keto hagas coming up all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we go back to</p>
<p>the uh green room and this time we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go to Kathy and she&rsquo;s from New</p>
<p>Jersey and Kathy hang on just a moment</p>
<p>let me unmute you and you are now on</p>
<p>with Dr Berg</p>
<p>hi Dr Burke can you hear me yes</p>
<p>perfectly okay</p>
<p>um so I have IC and I I take something</p>
<p>called pre-leaf before I eat something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s acidic and I wanted to try apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar before meals like I</p>
<p>suggest and I was wondering if that</p>
<p>pre-leaf negates it</p>
<p>that you know it&rsquo;s washing it out also</p>
<p>electrolytes would that bother my</p>
<p>bladder if I&rsquo;m fasting and there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>food in my stomach because I take</p>
<p>supplements</p>
<p>but I usually have food with it</p>
<p>good question I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to bother you</p>
<p>excuse me</p>
<p>I think you should try it out um</p>
<p>I think the opposite of vinegar</p>
<p>will help to fortify I mean like you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think the um one of the</p>
<p>byproducts of these microbes is to make</p>
<p>acetic acid so they&rsquo;re making acetic</p>
<p>acid</p>
<p>as far as a part of the small chain</p>
<p>fatty acids so I think I would try it</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>the key with what you have is going to</p>
<p>be keeping your sugars as low as</p>
<p>possible because you don&rsquo;t want to feed</p>
<p>any microbes</p>
<p>but um I have</p>
<p>um I did a video on that you should</p>
<p>check it out</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>the other thing that I would try would</p>
<p>be a a wheatgrass juice powder because</p>
<p>that tends to</p>
<p>heal and soothe all the inner tissues of</p>
<p>the body from top to bottom all the way</p>
<p>down and that seems to have some really</p>
<p>great effects</p>
<p>um in the bladder area the ureters and</p>
<p>the bowel the esophagus so um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing that I would attempt to</p>
<p>try</p>
<p>would I take that while I&rsquo;m fasting or</p>
<p>no just water while I&rsquo;m fasting I would</p>
<p>take it when you&rsquo;re fasting because you</p>
<p>want an empty stomach and have it go all</p>
<p>the way through and not be interfered or</p>
<p>diluted with the food</p>
<p>so um and it&rsquo;s not going to break your</p>
<p>fast I mean it&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a half a calorie in it so</p>
<p>preserving so I think you&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>fine</p>
<p>and what about the pre-leaf should I um</p>
<p>take that with the Apple I think I would</p>
<p>keep doing that and it&rsquo;s not going to</p>
<p>negate be negated from the outside of</p>
<p>vinegar I think that&rsquo;s a great remedy</p>
<p>but uh</p>
<p>um I would do them both</p>
<p>both in the same time</p>
<p>can I ask one more thing I um</p>
<p>when I fast</p>
<p>at night I take some of your um things</p>
<p>your adrenal and cortisol support and I</p>
<p>taking some magnesium and some um</p>
<p>your sleep aid but because of my</p>
<p>interstitial satis I&rsquo;m up 10 to 15 times</p>
<p>a night to urinate which</p>
<p>I do right on the side of the bed and</p>
<p>try to get back to bed to sleep</p>
<p>but my doctor had given me some sleeping</p>
<p>pills and then you know I realized</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a controlled substance and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want to do that and then my</p>
<p>daughter gave me some gummies that she</p>
<p>bought that have H or THC infused</p>
<p>am I still okay to fast and take those</p>
<p>things yeah I don&rsquo;t I I definitely don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like the THC uh remedy but I think</p>
<p>um what I what I would recommend that</p>
<p>you do</p>
<p>is I would um</p>
<p>you know we just like it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>minimizing</p>
<p>the uh the problem so if you could like</p>
<p>these supplements you take</p>
<p>at night maybe only ones that actually</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re natural and they actually help</p>
<p>you sleep but everything else as far as</p>
<p>supplements go that don&rsquo;t have to be</p>
<p>taken at night</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t take those past like seven</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock at night and that includes any</p>
<p>water too so that way we uh we could</p>
<p>just minimize the amount of fluid inside</p>
<p>your body the other thing that you might</p>
<p>want to attempt which</p>
<p>might actually help you think about it</p>
<p>potassium is a kind of a diuretic but</p>
<p>sodium it tends to retain fluid so if</p>
<p>you were to</p>
<p>have more sea salt</p>
<p>in the evening</p>
<p>you may actually have less urination</p>
<p>through the night</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to help you retain</p>
<p>certain things this is something to try</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um I understand that&rsquo;s a this is a</p>
<p>very irritating problem I&rsquo;ll have to</p>
<p>also you just kind of I&rsquo;m just putting</p>
<p>this on a list of doing some more Deep</p>
<p>dive into that topic to see if I can</p>
<p>come up with better Solutions because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible to be getting up that time</p>
<p>that that many times at night I mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s just crazy it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>really interference with your sleep and</p>
<p>your energy during the day I could</p>
<p>imagine yeah that stinks so Kathy thanks</p>
<p>so much for coming on we&rsquo;re gonna need</p>
<p>to move along here uh but please do let</p>
<p>us know uh how you&rsquo;re doing after</p>
<p>adjusting your regime okay let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>the next Quiz question and</p>
<p>um here it is Dr Earth</p>
<p>all right puffy eyes are a symptom of</p>
<p>which organ problem in the body</p>
<p>all right I bet haggis can do that too</p>
<p>okay jump on that uh audience and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see why don&rsquo;t we go back to social media</p>
<p>Eva from Facebook what are your thoughts</p>
<p>on car blockers</p>
<p>everybody</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time thinking</p>
<p>about it but I think</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the way to</p>
<p>do it to try to block carbohydrates in</p>
<p>the body you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I looked at them at one time there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of side effects I mean it&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>healthy thing I I think the best car</p>
<p>blocker would be to not eat carbs or</p>
<p>reduce your carbs</p>
<p>but that being said in this video that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do I&rsquo;ll talk about a lot of</p>
<p>other things you can do to minimize the</p>
<p>damage from carbohydrates and the</p>
<p>collateral damage and the complications</p>
<p>and reduce the insulin Spike from carbs</p>
<p>but they actually block the digestion of</p>
<p>carbs I I don&rsquo;t like that I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that so um that strategy because it</p>
<p>comes with a package</p>
<p>all right sounds terrific let&rsquo;s see I</p>
<p>just passed by one I am so uh by the way</p>
<p>admiring of the women in the world they</p>
<p>have more moving Parts in the skies and</p>
<p>they bear the world&rsquo;s children but one</p>
<p>thing they don&rsquo;t have is a prostate and</p>
<p>you should be glad because they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>real pain in the butt Ziggy from</p>
<p>Facebook what is your advice for someone</p>
<p>with prostatitis will the keto diet have</p>
<p>any effect on the prostate</p>
<p>yeah I think it will because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>um ketones are anti-inflammatory so if</p>
<p>you combine intermittent fasting you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to reduce inflammation throughout</p>
<p>the body whether you have an autoimmune</p>
<p>disease or a prostate inflammatory</p>
<p>condition but I think um one big culprit</p>
<p>for this prostate inflammation is the</p>
<p>dairy</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you get Dairy out of the diet with</p>
<p>people with prostate problems the</p>
<p>swelling goes down because there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of hormonal estrogenic effects some</p>
<p>other things I would avoid if you have a</p>
<p>prostate is especially the soy protein</p>
<p>isolate</p>
<p>um estrogenic effects so we don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to add more inflammatory things as well</p>
<p>as the</p>
<p>things like pro-inflammatory</p>
<p>omega-6 corn oil soy oil canola</p>
<p>cottonseed oil</p>
<p>instead do fish oils cod liver oil for</p>
<p>that prostate enlargement</p>
<p>um zinc very important</p>
<p>to help to stabilize in a large prostate</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a lot more on the</p>
<p>topic and uh I have videos on it so you</p>
<p>can watch those</p>
<p>wonderful okay the audience is lightning</p>
<p>fast as usual</p>
<p>they were asked puffy eyes are a symptom</p>
<p>of which organ problem</p>
<p>and uh our audience said 80 percent of</p>
<p>them at least respondents say it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>liver that&rsquo;s the culprit ten percent say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the kidneys five percent say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the heart and the last five percent say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the thyroid is anyone uh on track</p>
<p>well I guess everyone is is to somewhat</p>
<p>correct but the one that really creates</p>
<p>the puffiness is the kidney it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called periorbital edema and you</p>
<p>got these puffy eyes lower and higher</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ll be releasing another video on</p>
<p>that shortly but um but you know once</p>
<p>you identify some of these things all of</p>
<p>a sudden you see people with this</p>
<p>problem all over the place they know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like wow</p>
<p>that person has Perry Perry orbital</p>
<p>edema and so you just have to withhold</p>
<p>that temptation to go up to them and say</p>
<p>have you ever been checked for Perry</p>
<p>orbital edema because they&rsquo;ll look at</p>
<p>you very strange and you&rsquo;ll be uh</p>
<p>socially rejected</p>
<p>so awful well anyway ten percent of the</p>
<p>respondents said it was the kidney so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very bright and I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>evaluate the rest of them but they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have another chance on an upcoming uh</p>
<p>question meantime let&rsquo;s stick with all</p>
<p>our friends on social media uh</p>
<p>you already did that one</p>
<p>uh Abraham from Facebook what do you</p>
<p>suggest for someone who gets bloated</p>
<p>from cruciferous veggies also what would</p>
<p>be a good alternative to the keto diet</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>I think I would switch the type of</p>
<p>vegetables some more salad to see if you</p>
<p>still get the bloating</p>
<p>um chances are there&rsquo;s a lot of um</p>
<p>other things in cruciferous that can</p>
<p>bloat you and create gas</p>
<p>um but there&rsquo;s also this this thing of</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>sibo small intestinal bacterial</p>
<p>overgrowth where you have too many back</p>
<p>too much bacteria in your small</p>
<p>intestine so if you have any fiber and</p>
<p>you blow then we know it&rsquo;s probably that</p>
<p>and the solution to that would be to</p>
<p>take of course butane had a chloride</p>
<p>increase the acid but also bile salts on</p>
<p>an empty stomach because the normal um</p>
<p>function of bile salts that go beyond</p>
<p>just the absorption of the fat cell</p>
<p>nutrients</p>
<p>is that it helps kill microbes in the</p>
<p>wrong place it helps kill</p>
<p>microbes in your small intestine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why</p>
<p>the bile salts released into the small</p>
<p>intestine goes down and gets reabsorbed</p>
<p>at the the distal part or the last part</p>
<p>of that small intestine and gets</p>
<p>reabsorbed so so if you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough bile you can&rsquo;t kill up the</p>
<p>microbes now we get small intestinal</p>
<p>bacterial overgrowth and then we get</p>
<p>bloating especially when we eat fiber</p>
<p>interesting okay let&rsquo;s fire up another</p>
<p>question you&rsquo;re so fast at it there you</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>all right which hormone is behind</p>
<p>pattern hair loss</p>
<p>okay gang get on that and by the way we</p>
<p>have uh TJ who is from California is</p>
<p>coming to us on the phone so to speak TJ</p>
<p>can you hear us</p>
<p>yes good go ahead with your question for</p>
<p>Dr Byrd</p>
<p>okay uh first of all uh Dr bird I would</p>
<p>like to thank you for your uh a public</p>
<p>this great public service for sharing us</p>
<p>with us your uh wealth of United States</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>experiences observations</p>
<p>and uh the info that we get is not only</p>
<p>life-changing but it&rsquo;s also life-saving</p>
<p>thank you doctor</p>
<p>so I just had my lipid panel test done</p>
<p>and all my levels my little</p>
<p>levels have a significantly increased</p>
<p>compared to my lipid lap than a year ago</p>
<p>I know that uh doing keto increases LDL</p>
<p>cholesterol and so forth but should I be</p>
<p>concerned about the big jump</p>
<p>in all my limited levels since I have</p>
<p>been on keto and in intermittent fasting</p>
<p>for only six weeks</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>no if you if your carbs are low you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not you shouldn&rsquo;t be concerned because I</p>
<p>would um also first of all from now on I</p>
<p>would always always do an advanced lipid</p>
<p>profile you want to see not just</p>
<p>um the the normal values but you want to</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>um especially LDL P it&rsquo;s the particle</p>
<p>sizes so you want to see if it&rsquo;s large</p>
<p>buoyant or small dents if it&rsquo;s large</p>
<p>buoyant those are harmless they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re large packages of cholesterol</p>
<p>floating through the body and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not invading the arteries</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re you just switched from</p>
<p>carbs to</p>
<p>um more fat and we&rsquo;ve got to mobilize</p>
<p>all this fat around your body so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a problem</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I think um</p>
<p>you should watch my recent video on the</p>
<p>two different types of LDL</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s not not anything to be</p>
<p>concerned because you&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>that your small dense lipoproteins are</p>
<p>low but let&rsquo;s say for example you have a</p>
<p>genetic</p>
<p>problem with cholesterol</p>
<p>and uh you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s things are</p>
<p>just way too high well</p>
<p>then maybe</p>
<p>continue to do what you&rsquo;re doing but</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t add additional fat like the</p>
<p>MCT oil don&rsquo;t add that don&rsquo;t add the</p>
<p>keto desserts don&rsquo;t add a lot of extra</p>
<p>fat just have the fat that&rsquo;s normally</p>
<p>within the food</p>
<p>um the other thing you can do</p>
<p>for those people I would you could take</p>
<p>bile salts which bile is the major</p>
<p>route</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>getting rid of excessive cholesterol</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one of its purposes to get</p>
<p>rid of the extra cholesterol so it could</p>
<p>mean you just don&rsquo;t have enough bile to</p>
<p>eliminate this extra cholesterol</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying like heck to get people to</p>
<p>understand this complex topic so I think</p>
<p>these next couple videos I release</p>
<p>will do it because I keep looking at how</p>
<p>can I break this down further but</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>been severely indoctrinated into</p>
<p>thinking the cholesterol is bad it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hard to undo that</p>
<p>interesting okay well the audience has</p>
<p>done it again rapid fire question</p>
<p>answering which hormone is behind uh I</p>
<p>guess is male pattern baldness usually</p>
<p>or I guess pattern baldness email too it</p>
<p>could be a female as well okay so uh 55</p>
<p>of them say it&rsquo;s estrogen speaking of</p>
<p>females 30 percent say DHT and 15 say</p>
<p>testosterone</p>
<p>okay so the answer is DHT what is that</p>
<p>that is a a powerful form of androgens</p>
<p>male hormone in women and men and so</p>
<p>with women you&rsquo;ll see more of this</p>
<p>pattern like thinning all over and then</p>
<p>they might notice uh the top of their</p>
<p>head the back of the head start</p>
<p>um they&rsquo;re losing hair with men they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to start seeing receding hair and</p>
<p>then the crown of their head is going to</p>
<p>start to disappear</p>
<p>so um there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons for this</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of things you can do to</p>
<p>kind of stop it if you get it in time</p>
<p>but if you look very closely at the</p>
<p>hairs they&rsquo;re just growing really slowly</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really tiny and um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of nutrients you can feed</p>
<p>your scalp and the salt Palmetto is a</p>
<p>really good remedy that I have in my</p>
<p>care formula that I</p>
<p>made sure I put that in there as well as</p>
<p>the Korean ginseng both of them are they</p>
<p>help block the DHT</p>
<p>one of the uh one of the things I really</p>
<p>want to research</p>
<p>is about over over 50 of all well</p>
<p>actually I think it&rsquo;s close to 60 of all</p>
<p>drugs work by inhibiting certain enzymes</p>
<p>so what I want to do is I&rsquo;m going to do</p>
<p>research on</p>
<p>looking for natural Inhibitors of those</p>
<p>enzymes and just give people</p>
<p>kind of like a document that they can</p>
<p>look up what would be the most potent</p>
<p>natural inhibitor of a certain enzyme to</p>
<p>create a certain effect</p>
<p>that way you could actually um create</p>
<p>some cool effects with all these side</p>
<p>effects so that&rsquo;s another project I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working on because if you look at like</p>
<p>ace2 Inhibitors calcium channel blockers</p>
<p>all these things are Inhibitors uh</p>
<p>including mechanisms of certain</p>
<p>chemotherapy</p>
<p>so I think um</p>
<p>that would be a very</p>
<p>um great research project that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to dive into very soon</p>
<p>terrific we&rsquo;ve got one patient person</p>
<p>left in the green room and it&rsquo;s Ellen</p>
<p>who is coming from the southern border</p>
<p>of Texas Harley Quinn or Harlequin I</p>
<p>guess anyway uh you are unmute yourself</p>
<p>dear and you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg thanks</p>
<p>for being so patient with us</p>
<p>thank you Dr Byrd</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>um went and had a I went and had a CAC</p>
<p>score and it was 1200.</p>
<p>I do have a family history of um heart</p>
<p>problems and</p>
<p>um I want to know I don&rsquo;t have any kind</p>
<p>of symptoms or anything I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>really good on my keto and intermittent</p>
<p>fasting the last six weeks but and I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>taken some supplements but I wanted to</p>
<p>know how much like a rotate tube how</p>
<p>much do I take how much of with the B3</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m confused</p>
<p>so so for everyone that um is not</p>
<p>familiar with the CAC it&rsquo;s a coronary</p>
<p>artery calcification test that measures</p>
<p>the calcium in the arteries which is one</p>
<p>of the best predictors for heart</p>
<p>problems and you want a score of zero</p>
<p>hers is 1200 so that&rsquo;s on the high side</p>
<p>so and she has no symptoms which is</p>
<p>fascinating and this is one of the</p>
<p>things that it&rsquo;s kind of a silent</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a lot of like for a lot of</p>
<p>problems there&rsquo;s no symptoms at first</p>
<p>even with like</p>
<p>kidney disease or liver disease there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no symptoms so how do you know you have</p>
<p>it so I&rsquo;m glad you took this test</p>
<p>because now we have a Baseline and then</p>
<p>in another</p>
<p>two or three months you take another</p>
<p>test and we want it to come down we want</p>
<p>to see Improvement to pull you out of</p>
<p>that you know risk zone so with vitamin</p>
<p>K2 which helps to decalcify the arteries</p>
<p>I would take um</p>
<p>probably per day I would take</p>
<p>500 micrograms</p>
<p>of the of the uh M7 version of K2</p>
<p>um I would also get a</p>
<p>distiller of not not alcohol but of</p>
<p>water and so you can actually drink your</p>
<p>own distilled water that you make from</p>
<p>stainless steel and glass jugs and so</p>
<p>why why am I recommending that because</p>
<p>that way you can put certain minerals</p>
<p>back in there like electric powder and</p>
<p>and it can help to suck some of the the</p>
<p>calcium out that you don&rsquo;t need in the</p>
<p>in the in the body</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also another supplement called</p>
<p>EDTA it&rsquo;s a chelator it&rsquo;s a natural</p>
<p>chelator you want to take that on empty</p>
<p>stomach maybe with that distilled water</p>
<p>and then add the minerals you want later</p>
<p>in the day because we want to start to</p>
<p>heal the arteries another really</p>
<p>important one will be tocatrinals which</p>
<p>will help</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s a very powerful form of vitamin</p>
<p>E that will help reduce the um</p>
<p>the the heat the reason why you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>building up this calcium in the first</p>
<p>place</p>
<p>the other little piece of the puzzle and</p>
<p>this is fascinating data</p>
<p>they have found that in these</p>
<p>calcium</p>
<p>plaquing in the arteries there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>biofilms what is that well it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Tartar and your teeth there&rsquo;s microbes</p>
<p>in there</p>
<p>so what does that mean</p>
<p>it means that</p>
<p>you need to do some things to help</p>
<p>reduce</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>those microbes and I I list a whole</p>
<p>series of things in other videos</p>
<p>um like</p>
<p>um colloidal silver garlic a lot of</p>
<p>garlic would be really good</p>
<p>um oregano oil things like that and then</p>
<p>over time as you keep a real low carb</p>
<p>diet and do a lot of fasting</p>
<p>I I think that your arteries are gonna</p>
<p>um keep improving over time but I&rsquo;m glad</p>
<p>you have the Baseline now</p>
<p>um because now you can do something</p>
<p>about it because if you didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>was going on I mean it could be a</p>
<p>problem you wrote</p>
<p>well thank you so much Ellen and thanks</p>
<p>for coming on and look forward to</p>
<p>hearing from you later as things</p>
<p>progress and we&rsquo;ve got uh I think time</p>
<p>for one last question here you go doc</p>
<p>all right the best natural remedy for</p>
<p>tartar on your teeth is what</p>
<p>audience I know you&rsquo;re going to get on</p>
<p>it we&rsquo;re going to get it out before the</p>
<p>show ends and let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>availability of your terrific products</p>
<p>around the world and remind people</p>
<p>chiming in from all these different</p>
<p>places that they may be able to get it a</p>
<p>little cheaper in shipping</p>
<p>if you are in other places other than</p>
<p>the U.S</p>
<p>we now have ways of getting it to you</p>
<p>faster and easier and less expensive so</p>
<p>there should be a link down below that</p>
<p>you can order these products so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>constantly working on that</p>
<p>um right now we&rsquo;re trying to get more uh</p>
<p>into Indian India because um</p>
<p>you know um I looked at who&rsquo;s watching</p>
<p>my YouTube channel the most</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>by City</p>
<p>and it went like La no surprise New York</p>
<p>no surprise London which is number third</p>
<p>and also the largest city in India so we</p>
<p>want to be there so if people</p>
<p>um need to get the products so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>available so we&rsquo;re working on that</p>
<p>fantastic well here&rsquo;s a kindred spirit</p>
<p>from YouTube Kimberly a shout out to Dr</p>
<p>Berg for his nutritional yeast</p>
<p>supplements I use uh to be constantly</p>
<p>tired and these supplements have helped</p>
<p>me with feeling much better being more</p>
<p>active and happier thank you and I</p>
<p>concur I love those not only because of</p>
<p>their benefit uh with within themselves</p>
<p>but also it just helps me curb an</p>
<p>appetite if I pop one or two of those in</p>
<p>my mouth and crunch them up I feel sort</p>
<p>of sated and then I can move on uh to</p>
<p>The Next Period of eating properly</p>
<p>without much struggle so thank you</p>
<p>Kimberly you and I uh fist bump and so</p>
<p>on on that uh and let&rsquo;s see it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting interesting a little comment</p>
<p>on the nutritional eats I was in my</p>
<p>practice there&rsquo;s a couple that came in</p>
<p>that were fighting in the waiting room</p>
<p>so I came over there and I put them in</p>
<p>separate rooms and go to your room and</p>
<p>then I treated them separately and then</p>
<p>um I gave them both some nutritional</p>
<p>yeast</p>
<p>within about four or five minutes all of</p>
<p>a sudden they just felt chilled out</p>
<p>they were back in communication problem</p>
<p>solved but that nutritional yeast</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re deficient in B1 you may be</p>
<p>grouchy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just because you&rsquo;re low in B1</p>
<p>because you ate too much sugar or carbs</p>
<p>or something like that so a little</p>
<p>nutritional yeast can go a long way and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>help you be a little less grouchy</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s terrific okay well as uh as I</p>
<p>promised our audience has come through</p>
<p>and the final question of the day in</p>
<p>fact the final question of the month the</p>
<p>best natural remedy for tartar on your</p>
<p>teeth is</p>
<p>and 60 of our respondents say coconut</p>
<p>oil 30 say baking soda and ten percent</p>
<p>say hydrogen peroxide</p>
<p>the answer is hydrogen peroxide</p>
<p>hydrogen peroxide don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>drinking gallons of this stuff</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m just talking about putting your</p>
<p>mouth as a mouthwash maybe um you know</p>
<p>food grade you know and um you may want</p>
<p>to dilute it with water but the point is</p>
<p>that uh that hydrogen peroxide can</p>
<p>penetrate biofilms</p>
<p>and guess what</p>
<p>um the bacteria that are forming the</p>
<p>biofilms which are calcium little igloos</p>
<p>they actually release hydrogen peroxide</p>
<p>so other microbes that can&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>them it&rsquo;s like a whole this whole</p>
<p>universe that&rsquo;s going on in your mouth</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s always there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>naturally your cells are making hydrogen</p>
<p>peroxide so if you add a little bit more</p>
<p>especially in the early forms of that</p>
<p>formation of biofilm you will prevent</p>
<p>that formation because they</p>
<p>they kill them off and then you can you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t have to dig out that tartar but um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>um remedy naturally for biofilms in</p>
<p>general so</p>
<p>um I mean you think about it you put</p>
<p>hydrogen peroxide on a on a table and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll sterilize any microbe right</p>
<p>um why couldn&rsquo;t you use it in the mouth</p>
<p>too you know</p>
<p>or topically for various things</p>
<p>uh I will be releasing some videos on</p>
<p>that as well but um</p>
<p>again hydrogen peroxide if it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>strong and you drink it could be a big</p>
<p>problem so</p>
<p>um you never want to drink straight</p>
<p>um hydrogen peroxide okay final question</p>
<p>for the month uh speaking of supplements</p>
<p>Cindy from Facebook are there any</p>
<p>supplements that I could take for severe</p>
<p>depression and PTSD I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through that I just can&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>straight or make it through the day</p>
<p>anymore</p>
<p>yes yes absolutely uh I my mind</p>
<p>immediately goes to vitamin D3 at least</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>000 international units so don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>take a little bit take a lot and um that</p>
<p>will help the other thing you want to</p>
<p>take is the D1 nutritional yeast that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really good one uh you want to be out</p>
<p>in the sun because the light therapy</p>
<p>make sure you get enough sun on your</p>
<p>eyes and your face several times a day</p>
<p>the best Sun would be early morning and</p>
<p>even late night as the sun sets if you</p>
<p>can get that because then you get the</p>
<p>infrared</p>
<p>um version</p>
<p>um and then the other thing too is like</p>
<p>adaptogens ashwagandha is really good</p>
<p>lemon balm tea is really essential</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I have done a lot of videos on</p>
<p>depression and um</p>
<p>um the gut the gut is a huge connection</p>
<p>so if you start taking a probiotic with</p>
<p>fermented vegetables like the sauerkraut</p>
<p>the kimchi that type of thing and maybe</p>
<p>even some kefir</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you that&rsquo;s going to really</p>
<p>help you tremendously so these are all</p>
<p>just things that I would recommend</p>
<p>um to pull you out of it</p>
<p>versus uh you know the drugs that they</p>
<p>give have</p>
<p>so many side effects I mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>you know recently they came out and said</p>
<p>well you know what we found out there</p>
<p>was no um evidence that that depression</p>
<p>is a chemical imbalance sorry about that</p>
<p>but you know we put millions of people</p>
<p>on drugs and created a lot of side</p>
<p>effects but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so anyway the key is</p>
<p>um if you&rsquo;re gonna solve a problem do it</p>
<p>with things that don&rsquo;t create bigger</p>
<p>problems good well Dr Berger uh sure</p>
<p>speak for the audience we&rsquo;re all tearing</p>
<p>up slightly but to remind everybody they</p>
<p>can get that new app and look at all</p>
<p>your videos while you&rsquo;re gone and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be posting some uh during your</p>
<p>travel so we&rsquo;re also grateful to you Dr</p>
<p>Berg and we&rsquo;ll continue to scrub through</p>
<p>drberg.com for great uh counsel while</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gone and with that the last word</p>
<p>is yours</p>
<p>well I think I would just download the</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um the app and that way you um have a</p>
<p>backup if you need it if you&rsquo;re around</p>
<p>somewhere and you just keep downloading</p>
<p>my videos and I have also the audio</p>
<p>version of the video so you can be</p>
<p>driving your car listening to it so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to watch the video which is a</p>
<p>cool little thing and then um also um so</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t be doing the live shows for the</p>
<p>next four weeks but after that we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>resume but of course every single day I</p>
<p>will release another video so check that</p>
<p>out again I appreciate your incredible</p>
<p>kind words and your intention thank you</p>
<p>and have a great next four weeks</p>
